the transport of Brownian particles in a two-dimensional\npotential under the action of a uniform external force. The potential is\nperiodic in one direction and confines the particle to a narrow channel of\nvarying cross-section in the other direction. We apply the standard long-wave\nasymptotic analysis in the narrow dimension and show that the leading order\nterm is equivalent to that obtained previously from a direct extension of the\nFick-Jacobs approximation. We also show that the confining potential has\nsimilar effects on the transport of Brownian particles to those induced by a\nsolid channel. Finally, we compare the analytical results with Brownian\ndynamics simulations in the case of a sinusoidal variation of the width of the\nparabolic potential in the cross-section. We obtain excellent agreement for the\nmarginal probability distribution, the average velocity of the Brownian\nparticles and the asymptotic dispersion coefficient, over a wide range of\nPeclet numbers.\n", "  Supersymmetry is deeply related to division algebras. Nonabelian Yang-Mills\nfields minimally coupled to massless spinors are supersymmetric if and only if\nthe dimension of spacetime is 3, 4, 6 or 10. The same is true for the\nGreen-Schwarz superstring. In both cases, supersymmetry relies on the vanishing\nof a certain trilinear expression involving a spinor field. The reason for\nthis, in turn, is the existence of normed division algebras in dimensions 1, 2,\n4 and 8: the real numbers, complex numbers, quaternions and octonions. Here we\nprovide a self-contained account of how this works.\n", "  When particles suspended in a fluid are driven through a regular lattice of\ncylindrical obstacles, the particle motion is usually not simply in the\ndirection of the force, and in the high Peclet number limit particle\ntrajectories tend to lock along certain lattice directions. By means of\nmolecular dynamics simulations we show that this effect persists in the\npresence of molecular diffusion for nanoparticle flows, provided the Peclet\nnumber is not too small. We examine the effects of varying particle and\nobstacle size, the method of forcing, solid roughness, and particle\nconcentration. While we observe trajectory locking in all cases, the degree of\nlocking varies with particle size and these flows may have application as a\nseparation technique.\n", "  We report on recent VLBA/VERA/IVS observational tests of General Relativity.\nFirst, we will summarize the results from the 2005 VLBA experiment that\ndetermined gamma with an accuracy of 0.0003 by measuring the deflection of four\ncompact radio sources by the solar gravitational field. We discuss the limits\nof precision that can be obtained with VLBA experiments in the future. We\ndescribe recent experiments using the three global arrays to measure the\naberration of gravity when Jupiter and Saturn passed within a few arcmin of\nbright radio sources. These reductions are still in progress, but the\nanticipated positional accuracy of the VLBA experiment may be about 0.01 mas.\n", "  Wavelets offer significant advantages for the analysis of problems in quantum\nmechanics. Because wavelets are localized in both time and frequency they avoid\ncertain subtle but potentially fatal conceptual errors that can result from the\nuse of plane wave or delta function decomposition. Morlet wavelets are\nparticularly well-suited for this work: as Gaussians, they have a simple\nanalytic form and they work well with Feynman path integrals. To take full\nadvantage of Morlet wavelets we need an explicit form for the inverse Morlet\ntransform and a manifestly covariant form for the four-dimensional Morlet\nwavelet. We supply both here.\n", "  We investigate the average velocity of Brownian particles driven by a\nconstant external force when constrained to move in two-dimensional,\nweakly-corrugated channels. We consider both the geometric confinement of the\nparticles between solid walls as well as the soft confinement induced by a\nperiodic potential. Using perturbation methods we show that the leading order\ncorrection to the marginal probability distribution of particles in the case of\nsoft confinement is equal to that obtained in the case of geometric\nconfinement, provided that the (configuration) integral over the cross-section\nof the confining potential is equal to the width of the solid channel. We then\ncalculate the probability distribution and average velocity in the case of a\nsinusoidal variation in the width of the channels. The reduction on the average\nvelocity is larger in the case of soft channels at small P\\'eclet numbers and\nfor relatively narrow channels and the opposite is true at large P\\'eclet\nnumbers and for wide channels. In the limit of large P\\'eclet numbers the\nconvergence to bulk velocity is faster in the case of soft channels. The\nleading order correction to the average velocity and marginal probability\ndistribution agree well with Brownian Dynamics simulations for the two types of\nconfinement and over a wide range of P\\'eclet numbers.\n", "  We present $d+1-$dimensional pure magnetic Yang-Mills (YM) black strings (or\n$1-$branes) induced by the $d-$dimensional Einstein-Yang-Mills-Dilaton black\nholes. Born-Infeld version of the YM field makes our starting point which goes\nto the standard YM field through a limiting procedure. The lifting from black\nholes to black strings, (with less number of fields) is by adding an extra,\ncompact coordinate. This amounts to the change of horizon topology from\n$S^{d-2}$ to a product structure. Our black string in $5-$dimensions is a\nrather special one, with uniform Hawking temperature and non-asymptotically\nflat structure. As the YM charge becomes large the string gets thinner to tend\ninto a breaking point and transform into a $4-$% dimensional black hole.\n", "  We reexamine the behaviour of particles at Ultra Highe energies in the\ncontext of the fact that the LHC has already touched an energy of $7 TeV$ and\nis likely to attain $14 TeV$ by 2013/2014.Consequences like a possible new\nshortlived interaction within the Compton scale are discussed.\n", "  I fumetti, come i film, spesso utilizzano idee scientifiche \"fantasiose\". Non\nci riferiamo qui alla violazione implicita delle leggi della fisica, cosa\npermessa in un mondo di fantasia, quanto piuttosto all'uso di spiegazioni\nfisiche errate che vengono usate in buona fede perch\\'e a riflettono\nconvinzioni molto diffuse, ma sbagliate, sull'interpretazione di fenomeni a\npartire dai principi fisici. D'altra parte questi errori possono servire a\nillustrare la corretta applicazione della fisica in una maniera molto pi\\`u\naccattivante rispetto alla modalit\\'a tradizionale di presentazione.\nAnalizziamo qui l'avventura Paperone ed il deposito sotterraneo di Pezzin e\nCavezzano.\n  -----\n  Comics and cartoon movies sometimes exploit fictitious scientific ideas. It\nis often the case that these ideas, althought wrong, actually reflect the\npopular vision of some natural phenomenon. We do not refer here to the implicit\nviolation of physical laws in fictions, a practice allowed by the underlining\n\"poetic licence\" of comics. However, sometimes wrong scientific \"explanations\"\nare proposed, and those may be accepted by the public without further\ninspection. On the other hand, these errors may be a good starting point for a\ndidactic illustration of physical principles. We analyse here the comics\nPaperone ed il deposito sotterraneo (Uncle Scrooge and the underground money\nbin) by Perrin e Cavezzano.\n", "  We have found a novel symmetry for XPM(Cross Phase Modulation) systems .We\nprove that this symmetry is a necessary condition for a single multiphoton\nprocess to be visible in more than one field.We have found, two\nEIT(Electromagnetically Induced Transparency) systems that show cases of this\nsymmetry.The above process has the possibility of leading to strong sources of\ntemporally entangled photons of different frequency. For cases that do not show\nthis symmetry,more than one \"species\" of multiphoton processes can take place\nand each one is visible in one field only. When there is a symmetry, we predict\ncross field noise correlations for the scattered fields.Cross field noise\ncorrelations have recently been seen in a different situation that can provide\ninteresting variation to our study,namely the generated fields in FWM(Four Wave\nMixing). We postulate or conjecture the existence of two types of asymmetric\nmultiphoton processes.We show only one of these is possible. One of systems we\nuse for this purpose generates a $\\chi^{(9)}$ absorption resonance that is\nobservable on the same trace that shows linear features, in an experiment\ndescribed in a previous work but the order of nonlinearity newly interpreted\nusing this work.This high order nonlinearity should be very sensitive to cross\nfield correlations.We show how it can be used to test our conjecture of\nasymmetric processes.\n  We also come across an important $\\chi^{(5)}$ absorption,comparable to linear\nabsorption, that is anomalous.The anomaly is that the Imaginary part of this\nXPM nonlinearity can cause squeezing.We give a qualitative argument which shows\nthat we don't expect the Imaginary part of the XPM nonlinearities we usually\ncome across, to cause squeezing.This promising source of squeezing, is\nqualitatively different from the other sources hitherto known.\n", "  General Relativistic calculations in the linear regime have been made for\nelectromagnetic beams of radiation known as optical vortices. These exotic\nbeams of light carry a physical quantity known as optical orbital angular\nmomentum (OAM). It is found that when a massive spinning neutral particle is\nplaced along the optical axis, a phenomenon known as inertial frame dragging\noccurs. Our results are compared with those found previously for a ring laser\nand an order of magnitude estimate of the laser intensity needed for a\nprecession frequency of 1 Hz is given for these \"steady\" beams of light.\n", "  In the study of open quantum systems, the polaron transformation has recently\nattracted a renewed interest as it offers the possibility to explore the strong\nsystem-bath coupling regime. Despite this interest, a clear and unambiguous\nanalysis of the regimes of validity of the polaron transformation is still\nlacking. Here we provide such a benchmark, comparing second order perturbation\ntheory results in the original untransformed frame, the polaron frame and the\nvariational extension with numerically exact path integral calculations of the\nequilibrium reduced density matrix. Equilibrium quantities allow a direct\ncomparison of the three methods without invoking any further approximations as\nis usually required in deriving master equations. It is found that the second\norder results in the original frame are accurate for weak system-bath coupling,\nthe full polaron results are accurate in the opposite regime of strong\ncoupling, and the variational method is capable of interpolating between these\ntwo extremes. As the bath becomes more non-Markovian (slow bath), all three\napproaches become less accurate.\n", "  We study quantum stability bound on the mass of scalaron in generic theories\nof $f(R)$ gravity. We show that in these scenarios, the scalaron mass increases\nfaster with local density of the environment than one loop quantum correction\nto it thereby leading to violation of quantum bound on the chameleon mass. The\nintroduction of quadratic curvature corrections in the action are shown to\nstabilize the model.\n", "  We investigate a model based on a generalised version of the Fourier\ntransform for curved space-time manifolds. This model is possible if the metric\nhas an asymptotic flat region which allows a duality to be implement between\ncoordinates and momenta, hence, the models's name, trans-Planckian. The theory\nand the action are based on the postulate of the absolute egalitarian relation\nbetween coordinates $x$ and momenta $p$. We show how to implement this\nconstruction in a cosmological setting, on a Friedman-Robertson-Walker metric\nbackground, where the asymptotic time infinity plays the role of the required\nasymptotic flat region. We discuss the effect of gravity, and, in particular,\nof the Hubble expansion of the universe scale factor on the Fourier map. The\ndual inflationary stage is responsible for making the dual sector of the action\ninaccessible at ordinary low energies. We propose a scenario in which an\neffective positive cosmological constant is caused by how the dual sector of\nthe theory affects the equation of state for matter particles.\n", "  In this article we have used the recently introduced redefined Hawking\ntemperature on the event horizon and investigated whether the generalised\nsecond law of thermodynamics (GSLT) and thermodynamic equilibrium holds for\nboth the event and the apparent horizons. Here we have considered FRW universe\nand examined the GSLT and thermodynamic equilibrium with three examples.\nFinally, we have concluded that from the thermodynamic viewpoint, the universe\nbounded by the event horizon is more realistic than that by the apparent\nhorizon at least for some examples.\n", "  Classically, a spin structure on the loop space of a manifold is a lift of\nthe structure group of the looped frame bundle from the loop group to its\nuniversal central extension. Heuristically, the loop space of a manifold is\nspin if and only if the manifold itself is a string manifold, against which it\nis well-known that only the if-part is true in general. In this article we\ndevelop a new version of spin structures on loop spaces that exists if and only\nif the manifold is string, as desired. This new version consists of a classical\nspin structure plus a certain fusion product related to loops of frames in the\nmanifold. We use the lifting gerbe theory of Carey-Murray, recent results of\nStolz-Teichner on loop spaces, and some own results about string geometry and\nBrylinski-McLaughlin transgression.\n", "  We study the geometric properties of a $2m$-dimensional complex manifold\n$\\mathcal{M}$ admitting a holomorphic reduction of the frame bundle to the\nstructure group $P \\subset \\mathrm{Spin}(2m,\\mathbb{C})$, the stabiliser of the\nline spanned by a pure spinor at a point. Geometrically, $\\mathcal{M}$ is\nendowed with a holomorphic metric $g$, a holomorphic volume form, a spin\nstructure compatible with $g$, and a holomorphic pure spinor field $\\xi$ up to\nscale. The defining property of $\\xi$ is that it determines an almost null\nstructure, ie an $m$-plane distribution $\\mathcal{N}_\\xi$ along which $g$ is\ntotally degenerate.\n  We develop a spinor calculus, by means of which we encode the geometric\nproperties of $\\mathcal{N}_\\xi$ corresponding to the algebraic properties of\nthe intrinsic torsion of the $P$-structure. This is the failure of the\nLevi-Civita connection $\\nabla$ of $g$ to be compatible with the $P$-structure.\nIn a similar way, we examine the algebraic properties of the curvature of\n$\\nabla$.\n  Applications to spinorial differential equations are given. In particular, we\ngive necessary and sufficient conditions for the almost null structure\nassociated to a pure conformal Killing spinor to be integrable. We also\nconjecture a Goldberg-Sachs-type theorem on the existence of a certain class of\nalmost null structures when $(\\mathcal{M},g)$ has prescribed curvature.\n  We discuss applications of this work to the study of real pseudo-Riemannian\nmanifolds.\n", "  Prices in financial markets exhibit extreme jumps far more often than can be\naccounted for by external news. Further, magnitudes of price changes are\ncorrelated over long times. These so called stylized facts are quantified by\nscaling laws similar to, for example, turbulent fluids. They are believed to\nreflect the complex interactions of heterogenous agents which give rise to\nirrational herding. Therefore, the stylized facts have been argued to provide\nevidence against the efficient market hypothesis which states that prices\nrapidly reflect available information and therefore are described by a\nmartingale. Here we show, that in very simple bidding processes efficiency is\nnot opposed to, but causative to scaling properties observed in real markets.\nThereby, we link the stylized facts not only to price efficiency, but also to\nthe economic theory of rational bubbles. We then demonstrate effects predicted\nfrom our normative model in the dynamics of groups of real human subjects\nplaying a modified minority game. An extended version of the latter can be\nplayed online at seesaw.neuro.uni-bremen.de.\n", "  We present the numerical study of dynamical instability of a\npressure-supported relativistic torus, rotating around the black hole with a\nconstant specific angular momentum on a fixed space-time background, in case of\nperturbation by a matter coming from the outer boundary. Two dimensional\nhydrodynamical equations are solved at equatorial plane using the HRSCS to\nstudy the effect of perturbation on the stable systems. We have found that the\nperturbed torus creates an instability which causes the gas falling into the\nblack hole in a certain dynamical time. All the models indicate an oscillating\ntorus with certain frequency around their instant equilibrium. The dynamic of\nthe accreted torus varies with the size of initial stable torus, black hole\nspin and other variables, such as Mach number, sound speed, cusp location of\nthe torus, etc. The mass accretion rate is slightly proportional to the\ntorus-to-hole mass ratio in the black hole-torus system, but it strongly\ndepends on the cusp location of the torus. The cusp located in the\nequipotential surfaces of the effective potential moves outwards into the\ntorus. The dynamical change of the torus increases the mass accretion rate and\ntriggers the Papaloizou-Pringle instability. It is also observed that the\ngrowth of the $m=1$ mode of the Papaloizou-Pringle instability occurs for a\nwide range of fluid and hydrodynamical parameters and a black hole spin. We\nhave also computed the QPOs from the oscillating relativistic torus.\n", "  We measure the spatial density of F turnoff stars in the Sagittarius dwarf\ntidal stream, from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data, using statistical\nphotometric parallax. We find a set of continuous, consistent parameters that\ndescribe the leading Sgr stream's position, direction, and width for 15 stripes\nin the North Galactic Cap, and 3 stripes in the South Galactic Cap. We produce\na catalog of stars that has the density characteristics of the dominant leading\nSgr tidal stream that can be compared with simulations. We find that the width\nof the leading (North) tidal tail is consistent with recent triaxial and\naxisymmetric halo model simulations. The density along the stream is roughly\nconsistent common disruption models in the North, but possibly not in the\nSouth. We explore the possibility that one or more of the dominant Sgr streams\nhas been mis-identified, and that one or more of the `bifurcated' pieces is the\nreal Sgr tidal tail, but we do not reach definite conclusions. If two dwarf\nprogenitors are assumed, fits to the planes of the dominant and `bifurcated'\ntidal tails favor an association of the Sgr dwarf spheroidal galaxy with the\ndominant Southern stream and the `bifurcated' stream in the North. In the North\nGalactic Cap, the best fit Hernquist density profile for the smooth component\nof the stellar halo is oblate, with a flattening parameter q = 0.53, and a\nscale length of r_0 = 6.73. The Southern data for both the tidal debris and the\nsmooth component of the stellar halo do not match the model fits to the North,\nalthough the stellar halo is still overwhelmingly oblate. Finally, we verify\nthat we can reproduce the parameter fits on the asynchronous Milkyway@home\nvolunteer computing platform.\n", "  Neutrino emission significantly affects the evolution of the accretion tori\nformed in black hole-neutron star mergers. It removes energy from the disk,\nalters its composition, and provides a potential power source for a gamma-ray\nburst. To study these effects, simulations in general relativity with a hot\nmicrophysical equation of state and neutrino feedback are needed. We present\nthe first such simulation, using a neutrino leakage scheme for cooling to\ncapture the most essential effects and considering a moderate mass (1.4\nM_{\\odot} neutron star, 5.6 M_{\\odot} black hole), high spin (black hole\nJ/M^2=0.9) system with the K_0=220 MeV Lattimer-Swesty equation of state. We\nfind that about 0.08 M_{\\odot} of nuclear matter is ejected from the system,\nwhile another 0.3 M_{\\odot} forms a hot, compact accretion disk. The primary\neffects of the escaping neutrinos are (i) to make the disk much denser and more\ncompact, (ii) to cause the average electron fraction Y_e of the disk to rise to\nabout 0.2 and then gradually decrease again, and (iii) to gradually cool the\ndisk. The disk is initially hot (T~6 MeV) and luminous in neutrinos\n(L_{\\nu}~10^{54} erg s^{-1}), but the neutrino luminosity decreases by an order\nof magnitude over 50 ms of post-merger evolution.\n", "  The Large Observatory For X-ray Timing (LOFT), currently in an assessment\nphase in the framework the ESA M3 Cosmic Vision programme, is an innovative\nmedium-class mission specifically designed to answer fundamental questions\nabout the behaviour of matter, in the very strong gravitational and magnetic\nfields around compact objects and in supranuclear density conditions. Having an\neffective area of ~10 m^2 at 8 keV, LOFT will be able to measure with high\nsensitivity very fast variability in the X-ray fluxes and spectra. A good\nknowledge of the in-orbit background environment is essential to assess the\nscientific performance of the mission and optimize the design of its main\ninstrument, the Large Area Detector (LAD). In this paper the results of an\nextensive Geant-4 simulation of the instrument will be discussed, showing the\nmain contributions to the background and the design solutions for its reduction\nand control. Our results show that the current LOFT/LAD design is expected to\nmeet its scientific requirement of a background rate equivalent to 10 mCrab in\n2-30 keV, achieving about 5 mCrab in the most important 2-10 keV energy band.\nMoreover, simulations show an anticipated modulation of the background rate as\nsmall as 10% over the orbital timescale. The intrinsic photonic origin of the\nlargest background component also allows for an efficient modelling, supported\nby an in-flight active monitoring, allowing to predict systematic residuals\nsignificantly better than the requirement of 1%, and actually meeting the 0.25%\nscience goal.\n", "  The understanding of the relationship between excitation parameters\nandoscillation regimes is a classical topic concerning bowed stringinstruments.\nThe paper aims to study the case of reed woodwinds and attemptsto find\nconsequences on the ease of playing.In the minimum model of clarinet-like\ninstruments, three parameters areconsidered: i) the mouth pressure, ii) the\nreed opening at rest, iii) thelength of the resonator \\ assumed to be\ncylindrical. Recently asupplementary parameter was added: the loss parameter of\nthe resonator(using the \\textquotedblleft Raman model\\textquotedblright, that\nconsidersresonator losses to be independent of frequency). This allowed\nexplainingthe extinction of sound when the mouth pressure becomes very large.\nThepresent paper presents an extension of the paper by Dalmont et al\n(JASA,2005), searching for a diagram of oscillation regimes with respect to\nthereed opening and the loss parameter. An alternative method is used,\nwhichallows easier generalization and simplifies the calculation. The emphasis\nis done on the emergencebifurcation: for very strong losses, it can be inverse,\nsimilarly to theextinction one for weak losses. The main part of the\ncalculations areanalytical, giving clear dependence of the parameters. An\nattempt to deducemusical consequences for the player is given.\n", "  We investigate analytically and numerically the existence of stationary\nsolutions converging to zero at infinity for the incompressible Navier-Stokes\nequations in a two-dimensional exterior domain. More precisely, we find the\nasymptotic behaviour for such solutions in the case where the net force on the\nboundary of the domain is non-zero. In contrast to the three dimensional case,\nwhere the asymptotic behaviour is given by a scale invariant solution, the\nasymptote in the two-dimensional case is not scale invariant and has a wake. We\nprovide an asymptotic expansion for the velocity field at infinity, which shows\nthat, within a wake of width $|\\boldsymbol{x}|^{2/3}$, the velocity decays like\n$|\\boldsymbol{x}|^{-1/3}$, whereas outside the wake, it decays like\n$|\\boldsymbol{x}|^{-2/3}$. We check numerically that this behaviour is accurate\nat least up to second order and demonstrate how to use this information to\nsignificantly improve the numerical simulations. Finally, in order to check the\ncompatibility of the present results with rigorous results for the case of zero\nnet force, we consider a family of boundary conditions on the body which\ninterpolate between the non-zero and the zero net force case.\n", "  The decay $B_c\\rightarrow J/\\psi K^+ K^- \\pi^+$ is observed for the first\ntime, using proton-proton collisions collected with the LHCb detector\ncorresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3fb$^{-1}$. A signal yield of\n$78\\pm14$ decays is reported with a significance of 6.2 standard deviations.\nThe ratio of the branching fraction of $\\B_c \\rightarrow J/\\psi K^+ K^- \\pi^+$\ndecays to that of $B_c \\rightarrow J/\\psi \\pi^+$ decays is measured to be\n$0.53\\pm 0.10\\pm0.05$, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the\nsecond is systematic.\n", "  We reconsider thermal production of axions in the early universe, including\naxion couplings to all Standard Model (SM) particles. Concerning the axion\ncoupling to gluons, we find that thermal effects enhance the axion production\nrate by a factor of few with respect to previous computations performed in the\nlimit of small strong gauge coupling. Furthermore, we find that the top Yukawa\ncoupling induces a much larger axion production rate, unless the axion couples\nto SM particles only via anomalies.\n", "  The feasibility of obtaining exact analytical results in the realm of QED in\nthe presence of a background electromagnetic field is almost exclusively\nlimited to a few tractable cases, where the Dirac equation in the corresponding\nbackground field can be solved analytically. This circumstance has restricted,\nin particular, the theoretical analysis of QED processes in intense laser\nfields to within the plane-wave approximation even at those high intensities,\nachievable experimentally only by tightly focusing the laser energy in space.\nHere, within the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) or eikonal approximation, we\nconstruct analytically single-particle electron states in the presence of a\nbackground electromagnetic field of general space-time structure in the\nrealistic assumption that the initial energy of the electron is the largest\ndynamical energy scale in the problem. The relatively compact expression of\nthese states opens, in particular, the possibility of investigating\nanalytically strong-field QED processes in the presence of spatially focused\nlaser beams, which is of particular relevance in view of the upcoming\nexperimental campaigns in this field.\n", "  Risks threatening modern societies form an intricately interconnected network\nthat often underlies crisis situations. Yet, little is known about how risk\nmaterializations in distinct domains influence each other. Here we present an\napproach in which expert assessments of risks likelihoods and influence\nunderlie a quantitative model of the global risk network dynamics. The modeled\nrisks range from environmental to economic and technological and include\ndifficult to quantify risks, such as geo-political or social. Using the maximum\nlikelihood estimation, we find the optimal model parameters and demonstrate\nthat the model including network effects significantly outperforms the others,\nuncovering full value of the expert collected data. We analyze the model\ndynamics and study its resilience and stability. Our findings include such risk\nproperties as contagion potential, persistence, roles in cascades of failures\nand the identity of risks most detrimental to system stability. The model\nprovides quantitative means for measuring the adverse effects of risk\ninterdependence and the materialization of risks in the network.\n", "  This work deals with a detailed study of the dynamics of the apparent, event\nand particle horizons in the background of the inhomogeneous LTB spacetime. The\ncomparative study among these horizons shows a distinct character for apparent\nhorizon compared to the other horizons. The apparent horizon will be a trapping\nhorizon if its acceleration is positive. The Kodama vector is also defined and\nits causal character is found to be similar to that in the FRW model.\n", "  Swelling of uranium dioxide with ingrowth of defects by irradiation is not\nfully understood. Experimental and theoretical groups have attempted to explain\nthis phenomenon with various complex theories. In this study, experimental\nlattice expansion and super saturation of the lattice were well reproduced by\nmolecular dynamics simulation method. From the resemblance with the\nexperimental data, here it is manifested that only oxygen frenkel pairs were\ncreated in the fission induced lattice while alpha particle radiation causes\nboth oxygen and considerable amount of uranium defects. Moreover, in this work,\ndefects are divided into two sub-groups as obstruction and distortion and it is\nshown that obstruction type frenkel pairs merely responsible for the lattice\nswelling for both fission and alpha particle radiation. Evidently relative\nlattice expansion varies linearly with the obstruction type of survived uranium\ndefects. Additionally, at high concentrations, some of the obstruction type\nuranium frenkel pairs forming double or triple structures with oxygens in their\noctahedral cages which increase the slope of the linear dependence.\n", "  In the present work, particle creation mechanism has been employed to the\nUniverse as a thermodynamical system. The Universe is considered to be a\nspatially flat FRW model and cosmic fluid is chosen as a perfect fluid with a\nbarotropic equation of state -- $p = (\\gamma -1)\\rho$. By proper choice of the\nparticle creation rate, expressions for the entropy and temperature have been\ndetermined at various stages of evolution of the Universe. Finally, using the\ndeceleration parameter $q$ as a function of the redshift parameter $z$ based on\nrecent observations, the particle creation rate has been evaluated and its\nvariation at different epochs have been shown graphically.\n", "  In this note, we give a practical solution to the problem of determining the\nmaximal period of matrix generators of pseudo-random numbers which are based on\nan integer-valued unimodular matrix of size NxN known as MIXMAX and arithmetic\ndefined on a Galois field GF[p] with large prime modulus p. The existing theory\nof Galois finite fields is adapted to the present case, and necessary and\nsufficient condition to attain the maximum period is formulated. Three\nefficient algorithms are presented. First, allowing to compute the\nmultiplication by the MIXMAX matrix with O(N) operations. Second, to\nrecursively compute the characteristic polynomial with O(N^2) operations, and\nthird, to apply skips of large number of steps S to the sequence in O(N^2\nlog(S)) operations. It is demonstrated that the dynamical properties of this\ngenerator dramatically improve with the size of the matrix N, as compared to\nthe classes of generators based on sparse matrices and/or sparse characteristic\npolynomials. Finally, we present the implementation details of the generator\nand the results of rigorous statistical testing.\n", "  New explicit solutions to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in\n$\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\setminus\\left\\{ \\boldsymbol{0}\\right\\}$ are determined, which\ngeneralize the scale-invariant solutions found by Hamel. These new solutions\nare invariant under a particular combination of the scaling and rotational\nsymmetries. They are the only solutions invariant under this new symmetry in\nthe same way as the Hamel solutions are the only scale-invariant solutions.\nWhile the Hamel solutions are parameterized by a discrete parameter $n$, the\nflux $\\Phi$ and an angle $\\theta_{0}$, the new solutions generalize the Hamel\nsolutions by introducing an additional parameter $a$ which produces a rotation.\nThe new solutions decay like $\\left|\\boldsymbol{x}\\right|^{-1}$ as the Hamel\nsolutions, and exhibit spiral behavior. The new variety of asymptotes induced\nby the existence of these solutions further emphasizes the difficulties faced\nwhen trying to establish the asymptotic behavior of the Navier-Stokes equations\nin a two-dimensional exterior domain or in the whole plane.\n", "  We analyze the trajectory of suspended spherical particles moving through a\nsquare array of obstacles, in the deterministic limit and at zero Reynolds\nnumber. We show that, in the dilute approximation of widely separated\nobstacles, the average motion of the particles is equivalent to the trajectory\nfollowed by a point particle moving through an array of obstacles with an\neffective radius. The effective radius accounts for the hydrodynamic as well as\nshort-range repulsive non-hydrodynamic interactions between the suspended\nparticles and the obstacles and is equal to the critical offset at which\nparticle trajectories become irreversible. Using this equivalent system we\ndemonstrate the presence of directional locking in the trajectory of the\nparticles and derive an inequality that accurately describes the Devil's\nstaircase type of structure observed in the migration angle as a function of\nthe forcing direction. Finally, we use these results to determine the optimum\nresolution in the fractionation of binary mixtures using deterministic lateral\ndisplacement separation microfluidic systems.\n", "  We present a computational investigation of the mechanism governing\nsize-based particle separation in microfluidic pinched flow fractionation. We\nstudy the behavior of particles moving through a pinching gap (i.e., a\nconstriction in the aperture of a channel) in the Stokes regime as a function\nof particle size. The constriction aperture is created by a plane wall and\nspherical obstacle, and emulates the pinching segment in pinched flow\nfractionation devices. The simulation results show that the distance of closest\napproach between the particle and obstacle surfaces (along a trajectory)\ndecreases with increasing particle size. We then use the distance of closest\napproach to investigate the effect of short-range repulsive non-hydrodynamic\ninteractions (e.g., solid-solid contact). We define a critical trajectory as\nthe one in which the minimum particle-obstacle separation is equal to the range\nof the non-hydrodynamic interactions. The results further show that the initial\noffset of the critical trajectory (defined as the critical offset) increases\nwith particle size. We interpret the variation of the critical offset with\nparticle size as the basis for size-based microfluidic separation in pinched\nflow fractionation. We also compare the effect of different driving fields on\nthe particle trajectories; we simulate a constant force driving the particles\nin a quiescent fluid as well as a freely suspended particles in a\npressure-driven flow. We observe that the particles driven by a constant force\napproach closer to the obstacle than those suspended in a flow (for the same\ninitial offset). On the other hand, the increment in the critical offset (as a\nfunction of particle size) is larger in the pressure-driven case than in the\nforce-driven case. Thus, pressure-driven particle separation using pinched flow\nfractionation would prove more effective than its force-driven counterpart.\n", "  We present a microfluidic platform for the continuous separation of suspended\nparticles based on their size and settling velocity. The separation method\ntakes advantage of the flow field in the vicinity and inside a parallel array\nof slanted open cavities. These cavities induce flow along them, which deflects\nthe suspended particles to a different degree depending on the extent to which\nthey penetrate into the cavities. The cumulative deflection in the periodic\narray ultimately leads to vector chromatography, with the different species in\nthe sample moving in different directions. We demonstrate density and size\nbased separation over a range of flow rates by separating polystyrene and\nsilica particles and show that purities nearing 100% can be achieved for\nmulticomponent mixtures. We also demonstrate the potential of the platform to\nseparate biological cells by fractionating different blood components. We\ndiscuss the presence of two regimes, which can be distinguished depending on\nthe ratio between the settling velocity and the velocity of the particles\nacross the open cavities. The proposed platform could also integrate additional\nseparative force fields in the direction normal to the plane of the cavities to\nfractionate specific mixtures based on the distinguishing properties of the\ncomponent species.\n", "  We investigate the motion of suspended particles past a single line of\nequally spaced cylindrical posts that is slanted with respect to the driving\nforce. We show that such a one-dimensional array of posts can fractionate\nparticles according to their size, with small particles permeating through the\nline of posts but larger particles being deflected by the steric barrier\ncreated by the posts, even though the gaps between posts are larger than the\nparticles. We perform characterization experiments driving monodisperse\nsuspensions of particles of different size past the line of posts over the\nentire range of forcing orientations and present both the permeation\nprobability through the individual gaps between the posts as well as the\nfraction of permeating particles through the one-dimensional array. In both\ncases, we observe a sharp transition from deflection to permeation mode that is\na function of particle size, thus enabling separation. We then drive binary\nmixtures at selected orientations of the line of posts and demonstrate high\npurity and efficiency of separation.\n", "  We investigate the motion of a suspended non-Brownian sphere past a fixed\ncylindrical or spherical obstacle in the limit of zero Reynolds number for\narbitrary particle-obstacle aspect ratios. We consider both a suspended sphere\nmoving in a quiescent fluid under the action of a uniform force as well as a\nuniform ambient velocity field driving a freely suspended particle. We\ndetermine the distribution of particles around a single obstacle and solve for\nthe individual particle trajectories to comment on the transport of dilute\nsuspensions past an array of fixed obstacles. First, we obtain an expression\nfor the probability density function governing the distribution of a dilute\nsuspension of particles around an isolated obstacle, and we show that it is\nisotropic. We then present an analytical expression -- derived using both\nEulerian and Lagrangian approaches -- for the minimum particle-obstacle\nseparation attained during the motion, as a function of the incoming impact\nparameter, i.e. the initial offset between the line of motion far from the\nobstacle and the coordinate axis parallel to the driving field. Further, we\nderive the asymptotic behaviour for small initial offsets and show that the\nminimum separation decays exponentially. Finally we use this analytical\nexpression to define an effective hydrodynamic surface roughness based on the\nnet lateral displacement experienced by a suspended sphere moving past an\nobstacle.\n", "  The OPERA long-baseline neutrino-oscillation experiment has observed the\ndirect appearance of $\\nu_\\tau$ in the CNGS $\\nu_\\mu$ beam. Two large muon\nmagnetic spectrometers are used to identify muons produced in the $\\tau$\nleptonic decay and in $\\nu_\\mu^{CC}$ interactions by measuring their charge and\nmomentum. Besides the kinematic analysis of the $\\tau$ decays, background\nresulting from the decay of charmed particles produced in $\\nu_\\mu^{CC}$\ninteractions is reduced by efficiently identifying the muon track. A new method\nfor the charge sign determination has been applied, via a weighted angular\nmatching of the straight track-segments reconstructed in the different parts of\nthe dipole magnets. Results obtained for Monte Carlo and real data are\npresented. Comparison with a method where no matching is used shows a\nsignificant reduction of up to 40\\% of the fraction of wrongly determined\ncharges.\n", "  The paper deals with the mechanism of particle creation in the framework of\nirreversible thermodynamics. The second order non-equilibrium thermodynamical\nprescription of Israel and Stewart has been presented with particle creation\nrate, treated as the dissipative effect. In the background of a flat FRW model,\nwe assume the non-equilibrium thermodynamical process to be isentropic so that\nthe entropy per particle does not change and consequently the dissipative\npressure can be expressed linearly in terms of the particle creation rate. Here\nthe dissipative pressure behaves as a dynamical variable having a non-linear\ninhomogeneous evolution equation and the entropy flow vector satisfies the\nsecond law of thermodynamics. Further, using the Friedmann equations and by\nproper choice of the particle creation rate as a function of the Hubble\nparameter, it is possible to show (separately) a transition from the\ninflationary phase to the radiation era and also from matter dominated era to\nlate time acceleration. Also, in analogy to analytic continuation, it is\npossible to show a continuous cosmic evolution from inflation to late time\nacceleration by adjusting the parameters. It is found that in the de Sitter\nphase, the comoving entropy increases exponentially with time, keeping entropy\nper particle unchanged. Subsequently, the above cosmological scenarios has been\ndescribed from field theoretic point of view by introducing a scalar field\nhaving self interacting potential. Finally, we make an attempt to show the\ncosmological phenomenon of particle creation as Hawking radiation, particularly\nduring the inflationary era.\n", "  Low-inclination, low altitude Earth orbits (LEO) are of increasing importance\nfor astrophysical satellites, due to their low background environment. Here,\nthe South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) is the region with the highest amount of\nradiation. We study the radiation environment in a LEO (500-600 km altitude, 4\ndegrees inclination) through the particle background measured by the Particle\nMonitor (PM) experiment onboard the BeppoSAX satellite, between 1996 and 2002.\nUsing time series of particle count rates measured by PM we construct intensity\nmaps and derive SAA passage times and fluences. The low-latitude SAA regions\nare found to have an intensity strongly decreasing with altitude and dependent\non the magnetic rigidity. The SAA extent, westward drift and strength vs\naltitude is shown.\n", "  We introduce a framework for model reduction of chain models for dissipative\nparticle dynamics (DPD) simulations, where the characteristic size of the\nchain, pressure, density, and temperature are preserved. The proposed\nmethodology reduces the number of degrees of freedom required to represent a\nparticular system with complex molecules (e.g., linear polymers). Based on\ngeometrical considerations we map fine-grained models to a reference state\nthrough a consistent scaling of the system, where short length and fast time\nscales are disregarded while the properties governing the phase equilibria are\npreserved. Following this coarse graining process we consistently represent\nhigh molecular weight DPD chains (i.e., >200 beads per chain) with a\nsignificant reduction in the number of particles required (i.e., > 20 times the\noriginal system).\n", "  An electrokinetically-driven deterministic lateral displacement (e-DLD)\ndevice is proposed for the continuous, two-dimensional fractionation of\nsuspensions in microfluidic platforms. The suspended species are driven through\nan array of regularly spaced cylindrical posts by applying an electric field\nacross the device. We explore the entire range of orientations of the driving\nfield with respect to the array of obstacles and show that, at specific\nforcing-angles, particles of different size migrate in different directions,\nthus enabling continuous, two-dimensional separation. We discuss a number of\nfeatures observed in the kinetics of the particles, including directional\nlocking and sharp transitions between migration angles upon variations in the\ndirection of the force, that are advantageous for high-resolution\ntwo-dimensional separation. A simple model based on individual\nparticle-obstacle interactions accurately describes the migration angle of the\nparticles depending on the orientation of the driving field, and can be used to\nre-configure driving field depending on the composition of the samples.\n", "  The silicon drift detectors are at the basis of the instrumentation aboard\nthe Large Observatory For x-ray Timing (LOFT) satellite mission, which\nunderwent a three year assessment phase within the \"Cosmic Vision 2015 - 2025\"\nlong-term science plan of the European Space Agency. Silicon detectors are\nespecially sensitive to the displacement damage, produced by the non ionising\nenergy losses of charged and neutral particles, leading to an increase of the\ndevice leakage current and thus worsening the spectral resolution.\n  During the LOFT assessment phase, we irradiated two silicon drift detectors\nwith a proton beam at the Proton Irradiation Facility in the accelerator of the\nPaul Scherrer Institute and we measured the increase in leakage current. In\nthis paper we report the results of the irradiation and we discuss the impact\nof the radiation damage on the LOFT scientific performance.\n", "  The standard perturbation theory in QFT and lattice models leads to\nasymptotic expansions. However, an appropriate regularization of the path or\nlattice integrals allows one to construct convergent series with an infinite\nradius of the convergence. In the earlier studies this approach was applied to\nthe purely bosonic systems. Here, using bosonization, we develop the convergent\nperturbation theory for a toy lattice model with interacting fermionic and\nbosonic fields.\n", "  We derive a luminosity distance formula for the varying speed of light (VSL)\ntheory which involves higher order characteristics of expansion such as jerk,\nsnap and lerk which can test the impact of varying $c$ onto the evolution of\nthe universe. We show that the effect of varying $c$ is possible to be isolated\ndue to the relations connecting observational parameters already by measuring\nthe second-order term in redshift $z$ unless there is a redundancy between the\ncurvature and an exotic fluid of cosmic strings scaling the same way as the\ncurvature.\n", "  The computation of renormalized one-loop amplitudes in quantum field theory\nrequires not only the knowledge of the Lagrangian density and the corresponding\nFeynman rules, but also that of the ultraviolet counterterms. More in general,\nand depending also on the methods used in the actual computation of the\none-loop amplitudes, additional interactions might be needed. One example is\nthat of the R2 rational terms in the OPP method. In this paper, we argue that\nthe determination of all elements necessary for loop computations in arbitrary\nmodels can be automated starting only from information on the Lagrangian at the\ntree-level. In particular, we show how the R2 rational and ultraviolet\ncounterterms for any renormalizable model can be computed with the help of a\nnew package, which we name NLOCT and builds upon FeynRules and FeynArts. To\nshow the potential of our approach, we calculate all additional rules that are\nneeded to promote a Two Higgs Doublet Model Lagrangian to one-loop computations\nin QCD and electroweak couplings.\n", "  We study the transport of Brownian particles under a constant driving force\nand moving in channels that present a varying centerline but have constant\naperture width. We investigate two types of channels, {\\it solid} channels in\nwhich the particles are geometrically confined between walls and {\\em soft}\nchannels in which the particles are confined by a periodic potential. We\nconsider the limit of narrow, slowly-varying channels, i.e., when the aperture\nand the variation in the position of the centerline are small compared to the\nlength of a unit cell in the channel (wavelength). We use the method of\nasymptotic expansions to determine both the average velocity (or mobility) and\nthe effective diffusion coefficient of the particles. We show that both solid\nand soft-channels have the same effects on the transport properties up to\n$O(\\epsilon^2)$. We also show that the mobility in a solid-channel at\n$O(\\epsilon^4)$ is smaller than that in a soft-channel. Interestingly, in both\ncases, the corrections to the mobility of the particles are independent of the\nP\\'eclet number and, as a result, the Einstein-Smoluchowski relation is\nsatisfied. Finally, we show that by increasing the solid-channel width from\n$w(x)$ to $\\sqrt{6/\\pi}w(x)$, the mobility of the particles in the\nsolid-channel can be matched to that in the soft-channel up to $O(\\epsilon^4)$.\n", "  In this paper, we show that the theory of high $T_c$ superconductivity based\non a microscopic model with $d$-density wave (DDW) scenario in the pseudogap\nphase is able to reproduce some of the most important features of the recent\nexperimentally discovered hidden charge order in several families of Cuprates.\nIn particular, by computing and comparing energies of charge orders of\ndifferent modulation directions derived from a full microscopic theory with\n$d$-density wave scenario, the axial charge order $\\phi_{X(Y)}$ with wavevector\n$\\mathbf{Q}=(Q_0,0)((0,Q_0))$ is shown to be unambiguously energetically more\nfavorable over the diagonal charge order $\\phi_{X\\pm Y}$ with wavevector\n$\\mathbf{Q}=(Q_0,\\pm Q_0)$ at least in commensurate limit, to be expected also\nto hold even to more general incommensurate case, in agreement with experiment.\nThe two types of axial charge order $\\phi_X$ and $\\phi_Y$ are degenerate by\nsymmetry. We find that within the superconducting background, biaxial\n(checkerboard) charge order is energetically more favorable than uniaxial\n(stripe) charge order, and therefore checkerboard axial charge order should be\nthe one observed in experiments, assuming a single domain of charge ordered\nstate on each CuO$_2$ plane.\n", "  We give the automata which describe time evolution rules of the box-ball\nsystem (BBS) with a carrier. It can be shown by use of tropical geometry, such\nsystems are ultradiscrete analogues of KdV equation. We discuss their relation\nwith the lamplighter group generated by an automaton. We present spectral\nanalysis of the stochastic matrices induced by these automata, and verify their\nspectral coincidence.\n", "  The Bakamjian-Thomas relativistic quark model for hadron current matrix\nelements, while non-covariant at finite mass, is successful in the heavy quark\nlimit : form factors are covariant and satisfy Isgur-Wise scaling and\nBjorken-Uraltsev sum rules. Motivated by the so-called \"1/2 vs. 3/2 puzzle\" in\nB decays to positive parity D**, we examine the implications of the model at\nfinite mass. In the elastic case 1/2^- -> 1/2^-, the HQET constraints for the\nO(1/m_Q) corrections are analytically fulfilled. A number of satisfying\nregularities is also found for inelastic transitions. We compute the form\nfactors using the wave functions given by the Godfrey-Isgur potential. For\n1/2^- \\to 3/2^+ the departures from the heavy quark limit are small, but we\nfind a strong enhancement in 1/2^- -> 1/2^+ (for 0^- -> 0^+). This enhancement\nis linked to a serious difficulty of the model at finite mass for the inelastic\ntransitions, namely a violation of the HQET constraints at zero recoil\nformulated by Leibovich et al. These are nevertheless satisfied in the\nnon-relativistic limit for the light quark. We conclude that these HQET\nrigorous constraints are crucial in the construction of a sensible relativistic\nquark model of inelastic form factors.\n", "  Low-noise, position-sensitive Silicon Drift Detectors (SDDs) are particularly\nuseful for experiments in which a good energy resolution combined with a large\nsensitive area is required, as in the case of X-ray astronomy space missions\nand medical applications. This paper presents the experimental characterization\nof VEGA, a custom Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) used as the\nfront-end electronics for XDXL-2, a large-area (30.5 cm^2) SDD prototype. The\nASICs were integrated on a specifically developed PCB hosting also the\ndetector. Results on the ASIC noise performances, both stand-alone and bonded\nto the large area SDD, are presented and discussed.\n", "  The Particle-In-Cell (PIC) method is widely used in relativistic particle\nbeam and laser plasma modeling. However, the PIC method exhibits numerical\ninstabilities that can render unphysical simulation results or even destroy the\nsimulation. For electromagnetic relativistic beam and plasma modeling, the most\nrelevant numerical instabilities are the finite grid instability and the\nnumerical Cherenkov instability. We review the numerical dispersion relation of\nthe electromagnetic PIC algorithm to analyze the origin of these instabilities.\nWe rigorously derive the faithful 3D numerical dispersion of the PIC algorithm,\nand then specialize to the Yee FDTD scheme. In particular, we account for the\nmanner in which the PIC algorithm updates and samples the fields and\ndistribution function. Temporal and spatial phase factors from solving\nMaxwell's equations on the Yee grid with the leapfrog scheme are also\nexplicitly accounted for. Numerical solutions to the electrostatic-like modes\nin the 1D dispersion relation for a cold drifting plasma are obtained for\nparameters of interest. In the succeeding analysis, we investigate how the\nfinite grid instability arises from the interaction of the numerical 1D modes\nadmitted in the system and their aliases. The most significant interaction is\ndue critically to the correct represenation of the operators in the dispersion\nrelation. We obtain a simple analytic expression for the peak growth rate due\nto this interaction.\n", "  We investigate bounds on decoherence in quantum mechanics by studying $B$ and\n$D$-mixing observables, making use of many precise new measurements,\nparticularly from the LHC and B factories. In that respect we show that the\nstringent bounds obtained by a different group in 2013 rely on unjustified\nassumptions. Finally, we point out which experimental measurements could\nimprove the decoherence bounds considerably.\n", "  Water-ice-poor, 5-$\\mu$m-bright material on Saturn's moon Titan has\npreviously been geomorphologically identified as evaporitic. Here we present a\nglobal distribution of the occurrences of the 5-$\\mu$m-bright spectral unit,\nidentified with Cassini's Visual Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) and\nexamined with RADAR when possible. We explore the possibility that each of\nthese occurrences are evaporite deposits. The 5-$\\mu$m-bright material covers\n1\\% of Titan's surface and is not limited to the poles (the only regions with\nextensive, long-lived surface liquid). We find the greatest areal concentration\nto be in the equatorial basins Tui Regio and Hotei Regio. Our interpretations,\nbased on the correlation between 5-$\\mu$m-bright material and lakebeds, imply\nthat there was enough liquid present at some time to create the observed\n5-$\\mu$m-bright material. We address the climate implications surrounding a\nlack of evaporitic material at the south polar basins: if the south pole basins\nwere filled at some point in the past, then where is the evaporite?\n", "  Applying a multiphoton-subtraction technique to two-color macroscopic\nsqueezed vacuum state of light generated via high-gain parametric down\nconversion we conditionally prepare a new state of light: bright multi-mode\nlow-noise twin beams. The obtained results demonstrate up to 8-fold suppression\nof noise in each beam while preserving and even moderately improving the\nnonclassical photon number correlations between the beams. The prepared\nlow-noise macroscopic state, containing up to 2000 photons per mode, is not\namong the states achievable through nonlinear optical processes. The proposed\ntechnique substantially improves the usefulness of twin beams for quantum\ntechnologies.\n", "  We apply the Hartle formalism to study equilibrium configurations in the\nframework of Newtonian gravity. This approach allows one to study in a simple\nmanner the properties of the interior gravitational field in the case of static\nas well as stationary rotating stars in hydrostatic equilibrium. It is shown\nthat the gravitational equilibrium conditions reduce to a system of ordinary\ndifferential equations which can be integrated numerically. We derive all the\nrelevant equations up to the second order in the angular velocity. Moreover, we\nfind explicitly the total mass, the moment of inertia, the quadrupole moment,\nthe polar and equatorial radii, and the eccentricity of the rotating body. We\nalso present the procedure to calculate the gravitational Love number. We test\nthe formalism in the case of white dwarfs and show its compatibility with the\nknown results in the literature.\n", "  XQCAT (eXtra Quark Combined Analysis Tool) is a tool aimed at determining\nexclusion confidence levels for scenarios of new physics characterised by the\npresence of one or multiple heavy extra quarks which interact through Yukawa\ncouplings with any of the Standard Model quarks. The code uses a database of\nefficiencies for pre-simulated processes of QCD-induced pair production of\nextra quarks and their subsequent on-shell decays. In the version 1.2 of XQCAT\nthe efficiencies have been computed for a set of seven publicly available\nsearch results by the CMS experiment. The input for the code is a text file in\nwhich masses, branching ratios and dominant chirality of the couplings of the\nnew quarks are provided. The output of the code is the exclusion confidence\nlevels of the test point for each implemented experimental analysis considered\nindividually and, when possible, in statistical combination.\n", "  In this paper we present a second-order and continuous interpolation\nalgorithm for cell-centered adaptive-mesh-refinement (AMR) grids. Continuity\nrequirement poses a non-trivial problem at resolution changes. We develop a\nclassification of the resolution changes, which allows us to employ efficient\nand simple linear interpolation in the majority of the computational domain.\nThe benefit of such approach is higher efficiency. The algorithm is well suited\nfor massively parallel computations. Our interpolation algorithm allows\nextracting jump-free interpolated data distribution along lines and surfaces\nwithin the computational domain. This capability is important for various\napplications, including kinetic particles tracking in three dimensional vector\nfields, visualization (i.e. surface extraction) and extracting variables along\none-dimensional curves such as field lines, streamlines and satellite\ntrajectories, etc. Particular examples of the latter are models for\nacceleration of solar energetic particles (SEPs) along magnetic field-lines. As\nsuch models are sensitive to sharp gradients and discontinuities the capability\nto interpolate the data from the AMR grid to be passed to the SEP model without\nproducing false gradients numerically becomes crucial. The code implementation\nof our algorithm is publicly available as a Fortran 90 library.\n", "  The development of quantum information processing has traditionally followed\ntwo separate and not immediately connected lines of study. The main line has\nfocused on the implementation of quantum bit (qubit) based protocols whereas\nthe other line has been devoted to implementations based on high-dimensional\nGaussian states (such as coherent and squeezed states). The separation has been\ndriven by the experimental difficulty in interconnecting the standard\ntechnologies of the two lines. However, in recent years, there has been a\nsignificant experimental progress in refining and connecting the technologies\nof the two fields which has resulted in the development and experimental\nrealization of numerous new hybrid protocols. In this Review, we summarize\nthese recent efforts on hybridizing the two types of schemes based on discrete\nand continuous variables.\n", "  We introduce a new self-consistent structure finding algorithm that parses\nlarge scale cosmological structure into clusters, filaments and voids. This\nstructure finding algorithm probes the cosmological structure at multiple\nscales and clas- sifies the appropriate regions with the most probable\nstructure type and size. We show that it reproduces key observational results,\nincluding the baryon fraction of ICM, and average temperatures and densities\nfor the different structures.\n", "  We introduce a fully tuneable entangling gate for continuous-variable one-way\nquantum computation. We present a proof-of-principle demonstration by\npropagating two independent optical inputs through a three-mode linear cluster\nstate and applying the gate in various regimes. The genuine quantum nature of\nthe gate is confirmed by verifying the entanglement strength in the output\nstate. Our protocol can be readily incorporated into efficient multi-mode\ninteraction operations in the context of large-scale one-way quantum\ncomputation, as our tuning process is the generalisation of cluster state\nshaping.\n", "  In this work we analyse three quantum communication schemes for the\ngeneration of Gaussian entanglement between two ground stations. Communication\noccurs via a satellite over two independent atmospheric fading channels\ndominated by turbulence-induced beam wander. In our first scheme the\nengineering complexity remains largely on the ground transceivers, with the\nsatellite acting simply as a reflector. Although the channel state information\nof the two atmospheric channels remains unknown in this scheme, the Gaussian\nentanglement generation between the ground stations can still be determined. On\nthe ground, distillation and Gaussification procedures can be applied, leading\nto a refined Gaussian entanglement generation rate between the ground stations.\nWe compare the rates produced by this first scheme with two competing schemes\nin which quantum complexity is added to the satellite, thereby illustrating the\ntrade-off between space-based engineering complexity and the rate of\nground-station entanglement generation.\n", "  We develop a renormalization group approach for analyzing Fr\\\"ohlich polarons\nand apply it to a problem of impurity atoms immersed in a Bose-Einstein\ncondensate of ultra cold atoms. Polaron energies obtained by our method are in\nexcellent agreement with recent diagrammatic Monte Carlo calculations for a\nwide range of interaction strengths. We calculate the effective mass of\npolarons and find a smooth crossover from weak to strong coupling regimes.\nPossible experimental tests of our results in current experiments with ultra\ncold atoms are discussed.\n", "  We demonstrate tunable solid state and flexible graphene field effect devices\n(FEDs) fabricated using a poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) and lithium fluoride\n(LiF) composite dielectric. Increasing the concentration of LiF in the\ncomposite dielectric reduces the operating gate voltages significantly from 10\nV to 1 V required leading to a decrease in resistance. Electron and hole\nmobility of 350 and 310 cm2/Vs at VD = -5 V are obtained for graphene FEDs with\n10 % LiF concentration in the composite. Using composite dielectric also\nenabled excellent performance on flexible substrates without any significant\nchange in mobility and resistance. Flexible FEDs with only 5 % and 12 %\nvariation in mobility for 300 and 750 bending are obtained.\n", "  We present a highly optimized implementation of a Monte Carlo (MC) simulator\nfor the three-dimensional Ising spin-glass model with bimodal disorder, i.e.,\nthe 3D Edwards-Anderson model running on CUDA enabled GPUs. Multi-GPU systems\nexchange data by means of the Message Passing Interface (MPI). The chosen MC\ndynamics is the classic Metropolis one, which is purely dissipative, since the\naim was the study of the critical off-equilibrium relaxation of the system. We\nfocused on the following issues: i) the implementation of efficient access\npatterns for nearest neighbours in a cubic stencil and for\nlagged-Fibonacci-like pseudo-Random Numbers Generators (PRNGs); ii) a novel\nimplementation of the asynchronous multispin-coding Metropolis MC step allowing\nto store one spin per bit and iii) a multi-GPU version based on a combination\nof MPI and CUDA streams. We highlight how cubic stencils and PRNGs are two\nsubjects of very general interest because of their widespread use in many\nsimulation codes. Our code best performances ~3 and ~5 psFlip on a GTX Titan\nwith our implementations of the MINSTD and MT19937 respectively.\n", "  We investigate the migration of particles of different geometrical shapes and\nsizes in a scaled-up model of a gravity-driven deterministic lateral\ndisplacement (g-DLD) device. Specifically, particles move through a square\narray of cylindrical posts as they settle under the action of gravity. We\nperformed experiments that cover a broad range of orientations of the driving\nforce (gravity) with respect to the columns (or rows) in the square array of\nposts. We observe that as the forcing angle increases particles initially\nlocked to move parallel to the columns in the array begin to move across the\ncolumns of obstacles and migrate at angles different from zero. We measure the\nprobability that a particle would move across a column of obstacles, and define\nthe critical angle {\\theta}c as the forcing angle at which this probability is\n1/2. We show that critical angle depends both on particle size and shape, thus\nenabling both size- and shape-based separations. Finally, we show that using\nthe diameter of the inscribed sphere as the characteristic size of the\nparticles the corresponding critical angle becomes independent of particle\nshape and the relationship between them is linear. This linear and possibly\nuniversal behavior of the critical angle as a function of the diameter of the\ninscribed sphere could provide guidance in the design and optimization of g-DLD\ndevices used for shape-based separation.\n", "  Recent work has established that large informatics graphs such as social and\ninformation networks have non-trivial tree-like structure when viewed at\nmoderate size scales. Here, we present results from the first detailed\nempirical evaluation of the use of tree decomposition (TD) heuristics for\nstructure identification and extraction in social graphs. Although TDs have\nhistorically been used in structural graph theory and scientific computing, we\nshow that---even with existing TD heuristics developed for those very different\nareas---TD methods can identify interesting structure in a wide range of\nrealistic informatics graphs. Our main contributions are the following: we show\nthat TD methods can identify structures that correlate strongly with the\ncore-periphery structure of realistic networks, even when using simple greedy\nheuristics; we show that the peripheral bags of these TDs correlate well with\nlow-conductance communities (when they exist) found using local spectral\ncomputations; and we show that several types of large-scale \"ground-truth\"\ncommunities, defined by demographic metadata on the nodes of the network, are\nwell-localized in the large-scale and/or peripheral structures of the TDs. Our\nother main contributions are the following: we provide detailed empirical\nresults for TD heuristics on toy and synthetic networks to establish a baseline\nto understand better the behavior of the heuristics on more complex real-world\nnetworks; and we prove a theorem providing formal justification for the\nintuition that the only two impediments to low-distortion hyperbolic embedding\nare high tree-width and long geodesic cycles. Our results suggest future\ndirections for improved TD heuristics that are more appropriate for realistic\nsocial graphs.\n", "  We report an approach of realization and characterization of a novel\nplasmonic-photonic hybrid nanodevice. The device comprises a plasmonic\nnano-antenna (NA) and a defect mode based PC cavity, and were fabricated based\non a multi-step electron-beam lithography. The laser emission of the devices\nwas demonstrated and the coupling conditions between the NA and PC cavity were\ninvestigated in near-field level.\n", "  Parametric downconversion (PDC) in semiconductor Bragg-reflection waveguides\n(BRW) is routinely exploited for photon-pair generation in the\ntelecommunication range. Contrary to many conventional PDC sources, BRWs offer\npossibilities to create spectrally broadband but nevertheless indistinguishable\nphoton pairs in orthogonal polarizations that simultaneously incorporate high\nfrequency entanglement. We explore the characteristics of co-propagating twin\nbeams created in a type-II ridge BRW. Our PDC source is bright and efficient,\nwhich serves as a benchmark of its performance and justifies its exploitation\nfor further use in quantum photonics. We then examine the coalescence of the\ntwin beams and investigate the effect of their inevitable multi-photon\ncontributions on the observed photon bunching. Our results show that BRWs have\na great potential for producing broadband indistinguishable photon pairs as\nwell as multi-photon states.\n", "  The aim of this paper is to study the formation of anisotropic compact stars\nin modified $f(R)$ theory of gravity, which is the generalization of the\nEinstein's gravity. To this end, we have used the solution of Krori and Barua\nto the anisotropic distribution of matter in $f(R)$ gravity. Further, we have\nmatched the interior solution with the exterior solution to determine the\nconstants of Krori and Barua solution. Finally the constant have been\ndetermined by using the data of compact compact stars like 4$U1820-30, Her X-1,\nSAX J 1808-3658$. Using the evaluated form of the solutions, we have discussed\nthe regularity of matter components at the center as well as on the boundary,\nenergy conditions, anisotropy, stability analysis and mass-radius relation of\nthe compact stars 4$U1820-30$, $Her X-1$, $SAX J 1808-3658.$\n", "  We perform molecular dynamics simulations to understand the translational and\nrotational diffusion of Janus nanoparticles at the interface between two\nimmiscible fluids. Considering spherical particles with different affinity to\nfluid phases, both their dynamics as well as the fluid structure around them\nare evaluated as a function of particle size, amphiphilicity, fluid density,\nand interfacial tension. We show that as the particle amphiphilicity increases\ndue to enhanced wetting of each side with its favorite fluid, the rotational\nthermal motion decreases. Moreover, the in-plane diffusion of nanoparticles at\nthe interface becomes slower for more amphiphilic particles, mainly due to\nformation of a denser adsorption layer. The particles induce an ordered\nstructure in the surrounding fluid that becomes more pronounced for highly\namphiphilic nanoparticles, leading to increased resistance against nanoparticle\nmotion. A similar phenomenon is observed for homogeneous particles diffusing in\nbulk upon increasing their wettability. Our findings can provide fundamental\ninsight into the dynamics of drugs and protein molecules with anisotropic\nsurface properties at biological interfaces including cell membranes.\n", "  The Monte Carlo integrator HAWK provides precision predictions for Higgs\nproduction at hadron colliders in vector-boson fusion and Higgs strahlung, i.e.\nin production processes where the Higgs boson is Attached to WeaK bosons. The\nfully differential predictions include the full QCD and electroweak\nnext-to-leading-order corrections. Results are computed as integrated cross\nsections and as binned distributions for important hadron-collider observables.\n", "  Within the MNPBEM toolbox, developed for the simulation of plasmonic\nnanoparticles using a boundary element method approach, we show how to include\nsubstrate and layer structure effects. We develop the methodology for solving\nMaxwell's equations using scalar and vector potentials within the inhomogeneous\ndielectric environment of a layer structure. We show that the implementation of\nour approach allows for fast and efficient simulations of plasmonic\nnanoparticles situated on top of substrates or embedded in layer structures.\nThe new toolbox provides a number of demo files which can also be used as\ntemplates for other simulations.\n", "  Quantum mechanics is an outstandingly successful description of nature,\nunderpinning fields from biology through chemistry to physics. At its heart is\nthe quantum wavefunction, the central tool for describing quantum systems. Yet\nit is still unclear what the wavefunction actually is: does it merely represent\nour limited knowledge of a system, or is it an element of reality? Recent no-go\ntheorems argued that if there was any underlying reality to start with, the\nwavefunction must be real. However, that conclusion relied on debatable\nassumptions, without which a partial knowledge interpretation can be maintained\nto some extent. A different approach is to impose bounds on the degree to which\nknowledge interpretations can explain quantum phenomena, such as why we cannot\nperfectly distinguish non-orthogonal quantum states. Here we experimentally\ntest this approach with single photons. We find that no knowledge\ninterpretation can fully explain the indistinguishability of non-orthogonal\nquantum states in three and four dimensions. Assuming that some underlying\nreality exists, our results strengthen the view that the entire wavefunction\nshould be real. The only alternative is to adopt more unorthodox concepts such\nas backwards-in-time causation, or to completely abandon any notion of\nobjective reality.\n", "  Pure quantum states play a central role in applications of quantum\ninformation, both as initial states for many algorithms and as resources for\nquantum error correction. Preparation of highly pure states that satisfy the\nthreshold for quantum error correction remains a challenge, not only for\nensemble implementations like NMR or ESR but also for other technologies.\nHeat-Bath Algorithmic Cooling is a method to increase the purity of set of\nqubits coupled to a bath. We investigated the achievable polarization by\nanalyzing the state when no more entropy can be extracted. In particular we\ngive an analytic form for the maximum polarization of the purified qubit and\ncorresponding state of the whole system for the case when the initial state of\nthe qubits is totally mixed. It is however possible to reach higher\npolarization while starting with other states with higher polarization, thus\nour result provides an achievable lower bound. We also give an upper bound of\nthe number of steps needed to get a certain required polarization.\n", "  The parton and hadron cascade model PACIAE 2.1 (cf. Comput. Phys. Commun.184\n(2013) 1476) has been upgraded to the new issue of PACIAE 2.2. By this new\nissue the lepton-nucleon and lepton-nucleus (inclusive) deep inelastic\nscatterings can also be investigated. As an example, the PACIAE 2.2 model is\nenabled to calculate the specific charged hadron multiplicity in the $e^-$+p\nand $e^-$+D semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering at 27.6 GeV electron beam\nenergy. The calculated results are well comparing with the corresponding HERMES\ndata. Additionally, the effect of model parameters \\alpha and \\beta in the Lund\nstring fragmentation function on the multiplicity is studied.\n", "  We use field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) to investigate\nthe growth of palladium colloids over the surface of thin films of WO3/glass.\nThe film is prepared by Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) at different\ntemperatures. A PdCl2 (aq) droplet is injected on the surface and in the\npresence of steam hydrogen the droplet is dried through a reduction reaction\nprocess. Two distinct aggregation regimes of palladium colloids are observed\nover the substrates. We argue that the change in aggregation dynamics emerges\nwhen the measured water drop Contact Angel (CA) for the WO3/glass thin films\npasses a certain threshold value, namely CA = 46 degrees, where a crossover in\nkinetic aggregation of palladium colloids occurs. Our results suggest that the\nmass fractal dimension of palladium aggregates follows a power-law behavior.\nThe fractal dimension (Df) in the fast aggregation regime, where the measured\nCA values vary from 27 up to 46 degrees, according to different substrate\ndeposition temperatures, is Df = 1.75 (0.02). This value of Df is in excellent\nagreement with kinetic aggregation of other colloidal systems in fast\naggregation regime. Whereas for the slow aggregation regime, with CA = 58\ndegrees, the fractal dimension changes abruptly to Df=1.92 (0.03). We have also\nused a modified Box-Counting method to calculate fractal dimension of\ngray-level images and observe that the crossover at around CA = 46 degrees\nremains unchanged.\n", "  Quantum discord is a manifestation of quantum correlations due to\nnon-commutativity rather than entanglement. Two measures of quantum discord by\nthe amount of non-commutativity via the trace norm and the Hilbert-Schmidt norm\nrespectively are proposed in this paper. These two measures can be calculated\neasily for any state with arbitrary dimension. It is shown by several examples\nthat these measures can reflect the amount of the original quantum discord.\n", "  We present a general model of interacting metric fields with the sum of\nmassless non-interacting spin 2 fields as the linear limit. In the\nnon-interacting limit the model is reduced to a sum of general relativity\nactions, with the usual Einstein-Hilbert kinetic term for each metric field.\nUntil now the accepted view was that such theories are inconsistent since it\nhas been proven that ghost terms and/or discontinuity in the number of degrees\nof freedom at the zero interaction limit, are unavoidable. We do not refute\nthese results, but instead prove by construction that they do not necessarily\nlead to inconsistencies. In particular, our suggested theories are: 1.\nEnergetically stable, i.e. their Hamiltonian is bounded from below and the\nmulti-Minkowski metric configuration is the unique ground state. 2. Continuous\nin the zero interaction limit so that general relativity solutions are restored\nsmoothly. 3. Include no higher than two derivative Lagrangian terms. In\naddition, the dominant energy condition is maintained with respect to all\nmetric fields for all field configurations.\n", "  We study the breakdown of a Mott insulator with the thermodynamic imbalance\ninduced by an applied bias voltage. By analyzing the instabilities of the\nmagnetic susceptibility, we describe a rich non-equilibrium phase diagram,\nobtained for different applied voltages, that exhibits phases with a spatially\npatterned charge gap. For a finite voltage, smaller than the value of the\nequilibrium Mott gap, the formation of patterns coincides with the emergence of\nmid-gap states contributing to a finite steady-state conductance. We discuss\nthe experimental implications of this new scenario of Mott breakdown.\n", "  Supercooling of water can be easily studied with a simple apparatus suitable\nfor the student laboratory. We describe such an apparatus and its capabilities.\nThe parameters influencing supercooling include the initial temperature of the\nwater and the temperature and the type of chilling medium. We correlate the\noccurrence of supercooling with the ability of the chilling medium to promptly\nnucleate ice; if it nucleates promptly, the layer of ice crystals formed on the\nboundary will initiate freezing of the bulk water without supercooling. If the\nchilling medium is unable to nucleate ice promptly, ice nucleation is delayed\nand the water supercools. Students can study and compare supercooling of\ndistilled and natural water. Even quite dirty river water may be supercooled by\nas much as 5 C.\n", "  We discuss the usage and applicability of deflation methods for the overlap\nlattice Dirac operator, focussing on calculating the eigenvalues using a method\nsimilar to the eigCG algorithm used for other Dirac operators. The overlap\noperator, which contains several theoretical advantages over other formulations\nof lattice Quantum Chromodynamics, is more computationally expensive because it\nrequires the computation of the matrix sign function. The principle change made\ncompared to deflation methods for other formulations of lattice QCD is that it\nis necessary for best performance to tune or relax the accuracy of the matrix\nsign function as the computation proceeds.\n  We adapt the eigCG algorithm for two inversion algorithms for overlap\nfermions, GMRESR(relCG) and GMRESR(relSUMR). Before deflation, the rate of\nconvergence of these routines in terms of iterations is similar, but, since the\nShifted Unitary Minimal Residual (SUMR) algorithm only requires one call to the\nmatrix sign function compared to the two calls required for Conjugate Gradient\n(CG), SUMR is usually preferred for single inversions of the Dirac operator. We\nconstruct bounds for the required accuracy of the matrix sign function during\nthe eigenvalue calculation. For the SUMR algorithm, we use a Galerkin\nprojection to perform the deflation; while for the CG algorithm, we are able to\nuse a considerably superior spectral pre-conditioner. The superior performance\nof the spectral preconditioner, and its need for less accurate eigenvalues,\nalmost erodes SUMR's advantage over CG as an inversion algorithm.\n  We see factor of three gains for the inversion algorithm from the deflation\non our small test lattices. There is, however, a significant cost in the\neigenvalue calculation because we cannot relax the accuracy of the matrix sign\nfunction as aggressively when calculating the eigenvalues as we do while\nperforming the inversions.\n", "  The quantum criticality of the two-lead two-channel pseudogap Anderson model\nis studied. Based on the non-crossing approximation, we calculate both the\nlinear and nonlinear conductance of the model at finite temperatures with a\nvoltage bias and a power-law vanishing conduction electron density of states,\n$\\propto |\\omega-\\mu_F|^r$ ($0<r<1$) near the Fermi energy. Equilibrium and\nnon-equilibrium quantum critical properties at the two-channel Kondo (2CK) to\nlocal moment (LM) phase transition are addressed by extracting universal\nscaling functions in both linear and non-linear conductances, respectively.\nClear distinctions are found on the critical exponents between linear and\nnon-linear conductance. The implications of these two distinct quantum critical\nproperties for the non-equilibrium quantum criticality in general are\ndiscussed.\n", "  We experimentally demonstrate how coherent population trapping (CPT) for\ndonor-bound electron spins in GaAs results in autonomous feedback that prepares\nstabilized states for the spin polarization of nuclei around the electrons. CPT\nwas realized by excitation with two lasers to a bound-exciton state.\nTransmission studies of the spectral CPT feature on an ensemble of electrons\ndirectly reveal the statistical distribution of prepared nuclear spin states.\nTuning the laser driving from blue to red detuned drives a transition from one\nto two stable states. Our results have importance for ongoing research on\nschemes for dynamic nuclear spin polarization, the central spin problem and\ncontrol of spin coherence.\n", "  Using first-principles calculations, we have systematically investigated the\nstructural, electronic, and magnetic properties of facial (fac-) and meridional\n(mer-) tris(8-hydroxyquinoline)iron(III) (Feq3) molecules and their interaction\nwith ferromagnetic substrate. Our calculation results show that for the\nisolated Feq3, mer-Feq3 is more stable than the fac-Feq3; and both Feq3 isomers\nhave a high spin-state of 5 {\\mu}B as the ground state when an on-site\nHubbard-U term is included to treat the highly localized Fe 3d electrons; while\nthe standard DFT calculations produce a low spin-state of 1 {\\mu}B. These\nmagnetic behaviors can be understood by the octahedral ligand field splitting\ntheory. Furthermore, we found that fac-Feq3 has a stronger bonding to the Co\nsurface than mer-Feq3 and an anti-ferromagnetic coupling was discovered between\nFe and Co substrate, originating from the superexchange coupling between Fe and\nCo mediated by the interface oxygen and nitrogen atoms. These findings suggest\nthat Feq3 molecular films may serve as a promising spin-filter material in\nspintronic devices.\n", "  An important and continuing theme of modern solid state physics is the\nrealization of exotic excitations in materials (e.g. quasiparticles) that have\nno analogy (or have not yet been observed) in the actual physical vacuum of\nfree space. Although they are not fundamental particles, such quasiparticles do\nconstitute the most basic description of the excited states of the \"vacuum\" in\nwhich they reside. In this regard the magnetic textures of the excited states\nof spin ices, magnetic pyrochlore oxides with dominant Ising interactions, are\nproposed to be modeled as effective magnetic charge monopoles. Recent inelastic\nneutron scattering experiments have established the pyrochlore material\nYb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ (YbTO) as a quantum spin ice, where in addition to the Ising\ninteractions there are substantial transverse terms that may induce quantum\ndynamics and - in principle - coherent monopole motion. Here we report a\ncombined time domain terahertz spectroscopy (TDTS) and microwave cavity study\nof YbTO to probe its complex dynamic magnetic susceptibility. We find that the\nform of the susceptibility is consistent with monopole motion and a magnetic\nmonopole conductivity can be defined and measured. Using the unique phase\nsensitive capabilities of these techniques, we observe a sign change in the\nreactive part of the magnetic response. In generic models of monopole motion\nthis is only possible through introducing inertial effects, e.g. a mass\ndependent term, to the equations of motion. Analogous to conventional electric\ncharge systems, measurement of the conductivity's spectral weight allows us to\nderive a value for the magnetic monopole mass, which we find to be\napproximately 1800 electron masses. Our results establish the magnetic\nmonopoles of quantum spin ice as true coherently propagating quasiparticles of\nthis system.\n", "  We propose a predictive model based on the $SU(3)_{C}\\otimes SU(3)_{L}\\otimes\nU(1)_{X}$ gauge group supplemented by the $A_{4}\\otimes Z_{3}\\otimes\nZ_{4}\\otimes Z_{6}\\otimes Z_{16}$ discrete group, which successfully describes\nthe SM fermion mass and mixing pattern. The small active neutrino masses are\ngenerated via inverse seesaw mechanism with three very light Majorana\nneutrinos. The observed charged fermion mass hierarchy and quark mixing pattern\nare originated from the breaking of the $Z_{4}\\otimes Z_{6}\\otimes Z_{16}$\ndiscrete group at very high scale. The obtained values for the physical\nobservables for both quark and lepton sectors are in excellent agreement with\nthe experimental data. The model predicts a vanishing leptonic Dirac CP\nviolating phase as well as an effective Majorana neutrino mass parameter of\nneutrinoless double beta decay, with values $m_{\\beta \\beta }=$ 2 and 48 meV\nfor the normal and the inverted neutrino mass hierarchies, respectively.\n", "  We consider the dynamics of the scalar and pseudoscalar glueballs in the\nQuark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). By using the instanton model for the QCD vacuum we\ngive the arguments that the nonperturbative gluon-gluon interaction is\nqualitatively different in the confinement and deconfinement phases. Based on\nthis observation it is shown that above $T_c$ the values of the scalar and\npseudoscalar glueball masses might be very small. The estimation of the\ntemperature of scale invariance restoration, at which the scalar glueball\nbecomes massless, is given. We also discuss the Bose-Einstein condensation of\nthe glueballs and the superfluidity of the glueball matter in QGP.\n", "  We study the properties and symmetries governing the hydrodynamic interaction\nbetween two identical, arbitrarily shaped objects, driven through a viscous\nfluid. We treat analytically the leading (dipolar) terms of the pair-mobility\nmatrix, affecting the instantaneous relative linear and angular velocities of\nthe two objects at large separation. We prove that the instantaneous\nhydrodynamic interaction linearly degrades the alignment of asymmetric objects\nby an external time-dependent drive [Moths and Witten, Phys. Rev. Lett. 110,\n028301 (2013)]. The time-dependent effects of hydrodynamic interactions are\nexplicitly demonstrated through numerically calculated trajectories of model\nalignable objects composed of four stokeslets. In addition to the orientational\neffect, we find that the two objects usually repel each other. In this case the\nmutual degradation weakens as the two objects move away from each other, and\nfull alignment is restored at long times.\n", "  We present an optimization algorithm to construct pseudopotentials and use it\nto generate a set of Optimized Norm-Conserving Vanderbilt (ONCV)\npseudopotentials for elements up to Z=83 (Bi) (excluding Lanthanides). We\nintroduce a quality function that assesses the agreement of a pseudopotential\ncalculation with all-electron FLAPW results, and the necessary plane-wave\nenergy cutoff. This quality function allows us to use a Nelder-Mead\noptimization algorithm on a training set of materials to optimize the input\nparameters of the pseudopotential construction for most of the periodic table.\nWe control the accuracy of the resulting pseudopotentials on a test set of\nmaterials independent of the training set. We find that the automatically\nconstructed pseudopotentials provide a good agreement with the all-electron\nresults obtained using the FLEUR code with a plane-wave energy cutoff of\napproximately 60 Ry.\n", "  A hybrid Maxwell solver for fully relativistic and electromagnetic (EM)\nparticle-in-cell (PIC) codes is described. In this solver, the EM fields are\nsolved in $k$ space by performing an FFT in one direction, while using finite\ndifference operators in the other direction(s). This solver eliminates the\nnumerical Cerenkov radiation for particles moving in the preferred direction.\nMoreover, the numerical Cerenkov instability (NCI) induced by the\nrelativistically drifting plasma and beam can be eliminated using this hybrid\nsolver by applying strategies that are similar to those recently developed for\npure FFT solvers. A current correction is applied for the charge conserving\ncurrent deposit to correctly account for the EM calculation in hybrid Yee-FFT\nsolver. A theoretical analysis of the dispersion properties in vacuum and in a\ndrifting plasma for the hybrid solver is presented, and compared with PIC\nsimulations with good agreement obtained. This hybrid solver is applied to both\n2D and 3D Cartesian and quasi-3D (in which the fields and current are\ndecomposed into azimuthal harmonics) geometries. Illustrative results for laser\nwakefield accelerator simulation in a Lorentz boosted frame using the hybrid\nsolver in the 2D Cartesian geometry are presented, and compared against results\nfrom 2D UPIC-EMMA simulation which uses a pure spectral Maxwell solver, and\nfrom OSIRIS 2D lab frame simulation using the standard Yee solver. Very good\nagreement is obtained which demonstrates the feasibility of using the hybrid\nsolver for high fidelity simulation of relativistically drifting plasma with no\nevidence of the numerical Cerenkov instability.\n", "  The family of generalized Pseudo-Spectral Time Domain (including the\nPseudo-Spectral Analytical Time Domain) Particle-in-Cell algorithms offers\nsubstantial versatility for simulating particle beams and plasmas, and well\nwritten codes using these algorithms run reasonably fast. When simulating\nrelativistic beams and streaming plasmas in multiple dimensions, they are,\nhowever, subject to the numerical Cherenkov instability. Previous studies have\nshown that instability growth rates can be reduced substantially by modifying\nslightly the transverse fields as seen by the streaming particles . Here, we\noffer an approach which completely eliminates the fundamental mode of the\nnumerical Cherenkov instability while minimizing the transverse field\ncorrections. The procedure, numerically computed residual growth rates (from\nweaker, higher order instability aliases), and comparisons with WARP\nsimulations are presented. In some instances, there are no numerical\ninstabilities whatsoever, at least in the linear regime.\n", "  In this paper a numerical procedure to simulate low diffusivity scalar\nturbulence is presented. The method consists of using a grid for the advected\nscalar with a higher spatial resolutions than that of the momentum. The latter\nusually requires a less refined mesh and integrating both fields on a single\ngrid tailored to the most demanding variable, produces an unnecessary\ncomputational overhead. A multiple resolution approach is used also in the time\nintegration in order to maintain the stability of the scalars on the finer\ngrid. The method is the more advantageous the less diffusive the scalar is with\nrespect to momentum, therefore it is particularly well suited for large Prandtl\nor Schmidt number flows. However, even in the case of equal diffusivities the\npresent procedure gives CPU time and memory occupation savings. The reason is\nthat the absence of the pressure term in the scalar equation leads to much\nsteeper gradients in the scalar field as compared to the velocity field.\n", "  In this work we discuss the possibility to reduce the computational\ncomplexity of modal methods, i.e. methods based on eigenmodes expansion, from\nthe third power to the second power of the number of eigenmodes. The proposed\napproach is based on the calculation of the eigenmodes part by part by using\nshift-and-invert iterative technique and by applying the iterative approach to\nsolve linear equations to compute eigenmodes expansion coefficients. As\npractical implementation, the iterative modal methods based on polynomials and\ntrigonometric functions as well as on finite-difference scheme are developed.\nAlternatives to the scattering matrix (S-matrix) technique which are based on\npure iterative or mixed direct-iteractive approaches allowing to markedly\nreduce the number of required numerical operations are discussed. Additionally,\nthe possibility of diminishing the memory demand of the whole algorithm from\nsecond to first power of the number of modes by implementing the iterative\napproach is demonstrated. This allows to carry out calculations up to hundreds\nof thousands eigenmodes without using a supercomputer.\n", "  We propose a new family of matrix models whose 1/N expansion captures the\nall-genus topological string on toric Calabi-Yau threefolds. These matrix\nmodels are constructed from the trace class operators appearing in the\nquantization of the corresponding mirror curves. The fact that they provide a\nnon-perturbative realization of the (standard) topological string follows from\na recent conjecture connecting the spectral properties of these operators, to\nthe enumerative invariants of the underlying Calabi-Yau threefolds. We study in\ndetail the resulting matrix models for some simple geometries, like local P^2\nand local F_2, and we verify that their weak 't Hooft coupling expansion\nreproduces the topological string free energies near the conifold singularity.\nThese matrix models are formally similar to those appearing in the Fermi-gas\nformulation of Chern-Simons-matter theories, and their 1/N expansion receives\nnon-perturbative corrections determined by the Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit of\nthe refined topological string.\n", "  Models for supernovae (SNe) arising from thermonuclear explosions of white\ndwarfs (WDs) have been extensively studied over the last few decades, mostly\nfocusing on the single degenerate (accretion of material of a WD) and double\ndegenerate (WD-WD merger) scenarios. In recent years it was suggested that\nWD-WD direct collisions provide an additional channel for such explosions. Here\nwe extend the studies of such explosions, and explore the role of Helium-shells\nin affecting the thermonuclear explosions. We study both the impact of low-mass\nhelium ($\\sim0.01$ M$_{\\odot})$ shells, as well as high mass shells ($\\ge0.1$\nM$_{\\odot}$). We find that detonation of the massive helium layers precede the\ndetonation of the WD Carbon-Oxygen (CO) bulk during the collision and can\nchange the explosive evolution and outcomes for the cases of high mass\nHe-shells. In particular, the He-shell detonation propagates on the WD surface\nand inefficiently burns material prior to the CO detonation that later follows\nin the central parts of the WD. Such evolution leads to larger production of\nintermediate elements, producing large yields of $^{44}{\\rm Ti}$ and $^{48}{\\rm\nCr}$ relative to the pure CO-CO WD collisions. Collisions of WDs with a\nlow-mass He-shell do not give rise to helium detonation, but helium burning\ndoes precede the CO bulk detonation. Such collisions produce a high velocity,\nlow-mass of ejected burned material enriched with intermediate elements, with\nsmaller changes to the overall explosion outcomes. The various effects arising\nfrom the contribution of low/high mass He layers change the kinematics and the\nmorphological structure of collision-induced SNe and may thereby provide unique\nobservational signatures for such SNe, and play a role in the chemical\nenrichment of galaxies and the production of intermediate elements and\npositrons from their longer-term decay.\n", "  In the framework of the approximation of slowly varying amplitudes a\nmultiwave dynamical theory of neutron diffraction on a moving phase grating was\ndeveloped. The influence of the velocity of the grating, its period and height\nof the slits on the discrete energy spectrum and intensity of various\ndiffraction orders was analyzed.\n", "  A method for finding minimum energy paths of transitions in magnetic systems\nis presented and used to determine the mechanism and estimate the activation\nenergy of skyrmion and antivortex annihiliation in nano-systems. The path is\noptimized with respect to orientation of the magnetic vectors while their\nmagnitudes are fixed or obtained from separate calculations. The curvature of\nthe configuration space is taken into account by: (1) using geodesics to\nevaluate distances and displacements of the system during the optimization, and\n(2) projecting the path tangent and the magnetic force on the tangent space of\nthe manifold defined by all possible orientations of the magnetic vectors. The\nmethod, named geodesic nudged elastic band (GNEB), and its implementation are\nillustrated with calculations of complex transitions involving annihilation and\ncreation of skyrmion and antivortex states. The lifetime of the latter was\ndetermined within harmonic transition state theory using a noncollinear\nextension of the Alexander-Anderson model.\n", "  Scaling-up from prototype systems to dense arrays of ions on chip, or vast\nnetworks of ions connected by photonic channels, will require developing\nentirely new technologies that combine miniaturized ion trapping systems with\ndevices to capture, transmit and detect light, while refining how ions are\nconfined and controlled. Building a cohesive ion system from such diverse parts\ninvolves many challenges, including navigating materials incompatibilities and\nundesired coupling between elements. Here, we review our recent efforts to\ncreate scalable ion systems incorporating unconventional materials such as\ngraphene and indium tin oxide, integrating devices like optical fibers and\nmirrors, and exploring alternative ion loading and trapping techniques.\n", "  We develop an underlying relationship between the theory of rational\napproximations and that of isomonodromic deformations. We show that a certain\nduality in Hermite's two approximation problems for functions leads to the\nSchlesinger transformations, i.e. transformations of a linear differential\nequation shifting its characteristic exponents by integers while keeping its\nmonodromy invariant. Since approximants and remainders are described by\nblock-Toeplitzs determinants, one can clearly understand the determinantal\nstructure in isomonodromic deformations. We demonstrate our method in a certain\nfamily of Hamiltonian systems of isomonodromy type including the sixth Painleve\nequation and Garnier systems; particularly, we present their solutions written\nin terms of iterated hypergeometric integrals. An algorithm for constructing\nthe Schlesinger transformations is also discussed through vector continued\nfractions.\n", "  In this work, we analyzed an anomalous effect verified from symmetrical\ncapacitor devices, working in very high electric potentials. The mastery of\nthat effect could mean in the future the possible substitution of propulsion\ntechnology based on fuels by single electrical propulsion systems. From\nexperimental measurements, we detected small variations of the device inertia\nthat cannot be associated with known interactions, so that the raised force\napparently has not been completely elucidated by current theories. We measured\nsuch variations within an accurate range and we proposed that the experimental\nresults can be explained by relations like Clausius-Mossotti one, in order to\nquantify the dipole forces that appear in the devices. The values of the weight\nlosses in the capacitors were calculated by means of the theoretical proposal\nand indicated good agreement with our experimental measurements for 7kV and\nwith many other experimental works.\n", "  A technically simple and physically clear method is suggested for the direct\nmeasurement of brightness temperature of two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in\nthe channel of a high electron mobility transistor (HEMT). The usage of the\nmethod was demonstrated with the pseudomorphic HEMT as a specimen. The optimal\nHEMT dc regime, from the point of view of the \"back action\" problem, was found\nto belong to the unsaturated area of the static characteristics possibly\ncorresponding to the ballistic electron transport mode. The proposed method is\nbelieved to be a convenient tool to explore the ballistic transport, electron\ndiffusion, 2DEG properties and other electrophysical processes in the\nheterostructures.\n", "  We have previously described a way of describing the relation between\nunintegrated and integrated vertex operators in AdS5xS5 which uses the\ninterpretation of the BRST cohomology as a Lie algebra cohomology and\nintegrability properties of the AdS background. Here we clarify some details of\nthat description, and develop a similar approach for an arbitrary curved\nbackground with nondegenerate RR bispinor. For an arbitrary curved background,\nthe sigma-model is not integrable. However, we argue that a similar\nconstruction still works using an infinite-dimensional Lie algebroid.\n", "  For decades, the Vlasov-Darwin model has been recognized to be attractive for\nparticle-in-cell (PIC) kinetic plasma simulations in non-radiative\nelectromagnetic regimes, to avoid radiative noise issues and gain computational\nefficiency. However, the Darwin model results in an elliptic set of field\nequations that renders conventional explicit time integration unconditionally\nunstable. Here, we explore a fully implicit PIC algorithm for the Vlasov-Darwin\nmodel in multiple dimensions, which overcomes many difficulties of traditional\nsemi-implicit Darwin PIC algorithms. The finite-difference scheme for Darwin\nfield equations and particle equations of motion is space-time-centered,\nemploying particle sub-cycling and orbit-averaging. The algorithm conserves\ntotal energy, local charge, canonical-momentum in the ignorable direction, and\npreserves the Coulomb gauge exactly. An asymptotically well-posed fluid\npreconditioner allows efficient use of large time steps and cell sizes, which\nare determined by accuracy considerations, not stability, and can be orders of\nmagnitude larger than required in a standard explicit electromagnetic PIC\nsimulation. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency properties of the\nalgorithm with various numerical experiments in 2D-3V.\n", "  Simulations are carried out based on the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT)\nin order to investigate the properties of correlated thin films for various\nvalues of the chemical potential, temperature, interaction strength, and\napplied transverse electric field. Application of a sufficiently strong field\nto a thin film at half-filling leads to the appearance of conducting regions\nnear the surfaces of the film, whereas in doped slabs the application of a\nfield leads to a conductivity enhancement on one side of the film and a gradual\ntransition to the insulating state on the opposite side. In addition to the\ninhomogeneous DMFT, an independent layer approximation (ILA) is considered, in\nwhich the properties of each layer are approximated by a homogeneous bulk\nenvironment. A comparison between the two approaches reveals that the less\nexpensive ILA results are in good agreement with the DMFT approach, except\nclose to the metal-to-insulator transition points and in the layers immediately\nat the film surfaces. The hysteretic behavior (memory effect) characteristic of\nthe bulk doping driven Mott transition persists in the slab.\n", "  An implicit formula for the spectrum of the two-photon Rabi model was\npresented by Travenec in Phys. Rev. A 85, 043805 (2012) in analogy to the\nmethod of Braak [Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 100401 (2011)]. The spectrum is given by\ncommon zeros of four functions $G_c(z, E)$ taken with a fixed value of\n$z\\in\\mathbb{C}$. We point out that all the $G_c(z,E)$ functions defined by\nTravenec are identically zero, thus the spectrum is not in fact given by their\nroots.\n", "  Future galaxy surveys require one percent precision in the theoretical\nknowledge of the power spectrum over a large range including very nonlinear\nscales. While this level of accuracy is easily obtained in the linear regime\nwith perturbation theory, it represents a serious challenge for small scales\nwhere numerical simulations are required. In this paper we quantify the\nprecision of present-day $N$-body methods, identifying main potential error\nsources from the set-up of initial conditions to the measurement of the final\npower spectrum. We directly compare three widely used $N$-body codes, Ramses,\nPkdgrav3, and Gadget3 which represent three main discretisation techniques: the\nparticle-mesh method, the tree method, and a hybrid combination of the two. For\nstandard run parameters, the codes agree to within one percent at $k\\leq1$\n$h\\,\\rm Mpc^{-1}$ and to within three percent at $k\\leq10$ $h\\,\\rm Mpc^{-1}$.\nWe also consider the bispectrum and show that the reduced bispectra agree at\nthe sub-percent level for $k\\leq 2$ $h\\,\\rm Mpc^{-1}$. In a second step, we\nquantify potential errors due to initial conditions, box size, and resolution\nusing an extended suite of simulations performed with our fastest code\nPkdgrav3. We demonstrate that the simulation box size should not be smaller\nthan $L=0.5$ $h^{-1}\\rm Gpc$ to avoid systematic finite-volume effects (while\nmuch larger boxes are required to beat down the statistical sample variance).\nFurthermore, a maximum particle mass of $M_{\\rm p}=10^{9}$ $h^{-1}\\rm\nM_{\\odot}$ is required to conservatively obtain one percent precision of the\nmatter power spectrum. As a consequence, numerical simulations covering large\nsurvey volumes of upcoming missions such as DES, LSST, and Euclid will need\nmore than a trillion particles to reproduce clustering properties at the\ntargeted accuracy.\n", "  A powerful method to measure the mass profile of a galaxy is through the\nvelocities of tracer particles distributed through its halo. Transforming this\nkind of data accurately to a mass profile M(r), however, is not a trivial\nproblem. In particular, limited or incomplete data may substantially affect the\nanalysis. In this paper we develop a Bayesian method to deal with incomplete\ndata effectively; we have a hybrid-Gibbs sampler that treats the unknown\nvelocity components of tracers as parameters in the model. We explore the\neffectiveness of our model using simulated data, and then apply our method to\nthe Milky Way using velocity and position data from globular clusters and dwarf\ngalaxies. We find that in general, missing velocity components have little\neffect on the total mass estimate. However, the results are quite sensitive to\nthe outer globular cluster Pal 3. Using a basic Hernquist model with an\nisotropic velocity dispersion, we obtain credible regions for the cumulative\nmass profile M(r) of the Milky Way, and provide estimates for the model\nparameters with 95 percent Bayesian credible intervals. The mass contained\nwithin 260 kpc is 1.37x10^12 solar masses, with a 95 percent credible interval\nof (1.27,1.51)x10^12 solar masses. The Hernquist parameters for the total mass\nand scale radius are 1.55 (+0.18/-0.13)x10^12 solar masses and 16.9 (+4.8/-4.1)\nkpc, where the uncertainties span the 95 percent credible intervals. The code\nwe developed for this work, Galactic Mass Estimator (GME), will be available as\nan open source package in the R Project for Statistical Computing.\n", "  Aims. The aim of the study is to constrain the physics of gamma-ray bursts\n(GRBs) by analysing the multi-wavelength afterglow data set of GRB 121024A that\ncovers the full range from radio to X-rays. Methods. Using multi-epoch\nbroad-band observations of the GRB 121024A afterglow, we measured the three\ncharacteristic break frequencies of the synchrotron spectrum. We used six\nepochs of combined XRT and GROND data to constrain the temporal slopes, the\ndust extinction, the X-ray absorption, and the spectral slope with high\naccuracy. Two more epochs of combined data from XRT, GROND, APEX, CARMA, and\nEVLA were used to set constraints on the break frequencies and therefore on the\nmicro-physical and dynamical parameters. Results. The XRT and GROND light\ncurves show a simultaneous and achromatic break at around 49 ks. As a result,\nthe crossing of the synchrotron cooling break is no suitable explanation for\nthe break in the light curve. The multi wavelength data allow us to test two\nplausible scenarios explaining the break: a jet break, and the end of energy\ninjection. The jet-break scenario requires a hard electron spectrum, a very low\ncooling break frequency, and a non-spreading jet. The energy injection avoids\nthese problems, but requires $\\epsilon_e > 1 (k = 2)$, spherical outflow, and\n$\\epsilon_B < 10^{-9}$. Conclusions. In light of the extreme microphysical\nparameters required by the energy-injection model, we favour a jet-break\nscenario where $\\nu_m < \\nu_{sa}$ to explain the observations. This scenario\ngives physically meaningful microphysical parameters, and it also naturally\nexplains the reported detection of linear and circular polarisation.\n", "  Here I indulge in wide-ranging speculations on the shape of physics, and\ntechnology closely related to physics, over the next one hundred years. Themes\ninclude the many faces of unification, the re-imagining of quantum theory, and\nnew forms of engineering on small, intermediate, and large scales.\n", "  Counter to intuition, the images of an extended galaxy lensed by a moving\ngalaxy cluster should have slightly different spectra in any metric gravity\ntheory. This is mainly for two reasons. One relies on the gravitational\npotential of a moving lens being time-dependent (the $\\text{Moving}$\n$\\text{Cluster}$ $\\text{Effect}$, $\\text{MCE}$). The other is due to uneven\nmagnification across the extended, rotating source (the $\\text{Differential}$\n$\\text{Magnification}$ $\\text{Effect}$, $\\text{DME}$). The time delay between\nthe images can also cause their redshifts to differ because of cosmological\nexpansion. This Differential Expansion Effect is likely to be small. Using a\nsimple model, we derive these effects from first principles.\n  One application would be to the Bullet Cluster, whose large tangential\nvelocity may be inconsistent with the $\\Lambda CDM$ paradigm. This velocity can\nbe estimated with complicated hydrodynamic models. Uncertainties with such\nmodels can be avoided using the MCE. We argue that the MCE should be observable\nwith ALMA.\n  However, such measurements can be corrupted by the DME if typical spiral\ngalaxies are used as sources. Fortunately, we find that if detailed spectral\nline profiles were available, then the DME and MCE could be distinguished. It\nmight also be feasible to calculate how much the DME should affect the mean\nredshift of each image. Resolved observations of the source would be required\nto do this accurately.\n  The DME is of order the source angular size divided by the Einstein radius\ntimes the redshift variation across the source. Thus, it mostly affects nearly\nedge-on spiral galaxies in certain orientations. This suggests that observers\nshould reduce the DME by careful choice of target, a possibility we discuss in\nsome detail.\n", "  We revisit the \"state-dependence\" of the map that we proposed recently\nbetween bulk operators in the interior of a large AdS black hole and operators\nin the boundary CFT. By refining recent versions of the information paradox, we\nshow that this feature is necessary for the CFT to successfully describe local\nphysics behind the horizon --- not only for single-sided black holes but even\nin the eternal black hole. We show that state-dependence is invisible to an\ninfalling observer who cannot differentiate these operators from those of\nordinary quantum effective field theory. Therefore the infalling observer does\nnot observe any violations of quantum mechanics. We successfully resolve a\nlarge class of potential ambiguities in our construction. We analyze states\nwhere the CFT is entangled with another system and show that the ER=EPR\nconjecture emerges from our construction in a natural and precise form. We\ncomment on the possible semi-classical origins of state-dependence.\n", "  In this short note we clarify some aspects of the impact that the Weak\nGravity Conjecture has on models of (generalized) natural inflation. We address\nin particular certain technical and conceptual concerns recently raised\nregarding the stringent constraints and conclusions found in our previous work\n(arXiv:1503.04783). We also point out the difficulties faced by attempts to\nevade these constraints. These new considerations improve the understanding of\nthe quantum gravity constraints we found and further support the conclusion\nthat it remains challenging for axions to drive natural inflation.\n", "  We investigate the motion of a sedimenting spherical drop in the presence of\nan applied uniform electric field in an otherwise arbitrary direction in the\nlimit of low surface charge convection. We analytically solve the electric\npotential in and around the leaky dielectric drop, and solve for the Stokesian\nvelocity and pressure fields. We obtain the drop velocity through perturbations\nin powers of the electric Reynolds number which signifies the importance of the\ncharge relaxation time scale as compared to the convective time scale. We show\nthat in the presence of electric field either in the sedimenting direction or\northogonal to it, there is a change in the drop velocity only in the direction\nof sedimentation due to an asymmetric charge distribution in the same\ndirection. However, in the presence of an electric field applied in both the\ndirections, and depending on the permittivities and conductivities of the two\nfluids, we obtain a non-intuitive lateral migration of drop in addition to the\nbuoyancy driven sedimentation. These dynamical features can be effectively used\nfor manipulating drops in a controlled electro-fluidic environment.\n", "  We study the anapole moment of the lightest neutralino in the constrained\nMinimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (cMSSM). The electromagnetic anapole is\nthe only allowed electromagnetic form factor for Majorana fermions, such as the\nneutralino. Since the neutralino is the LSP in many versions of the MSSM and\ntherefore a candidate for dark matter, its characterization through its\nelectromagnetic properties is important both for particle physics and for\ncosmology. We perform a scan in the parameter space of the cMSSM and find that\nthe anapole moment is different from zero albeit very small ($< 10^{-3}$\nGeV$^{-2}$). Combined with experimental constraints like the Higgs mass and the\nDM relic density, the allowed region of parameter space lies within the reach\nof future direct DM searches. Thus, the anapole moment could be used as a\ncomplementary constraint when studying the parameter space of the cMSSM and\nother similar models.\n", "  We consider the quantum version of Arnold's generalisation of a rigid body in\nclassical mechanics. Thus, we quantise the motion on an arbitrary Lie group\nmanifold of a particle whose classical trajectories correspond to the geodesics\nof any one-sided-invariant metric. We show how the derivation of the spectrum\nof energy eigenstates can be simplified by making use of automorphisms of the\nLie algebra and (for groups of Type I) by methods of harmonic analysis. We show\nhow the method can be extended to cosets, generalising the linear rigid rotor.\nAs examples, we consider all connected and simply-connected Lie groups up to\ndimension 3. This includes the universal cover of the archetypical rigid body,\nalong with a number of new exactly-solvable models. We also discuss a possible\napplication to the topical problem of quantising a perfect fluid.\n", "  Since the negative result of Lo (Physical Review A, 1997), it has been left\nopen whether there exist some functions that can be securely computed in\ntwo-party setting in quantum domain when one of the parties is malicious. In\nthis paper, we for the first time, show that there are some functions for which\nsecure two-party quantum computation is indeed possible for non-simultaneous\nchannel model. This is in sharp contrast with the impossibility result of Ben\n-Or et al. (FOCS, 2006) in broadcast channel model. The functions we study are\nof two types - one is any function without an embedded XOR, and the other one\nis a particular function containing an embedded XOR. Contrary to classical\nsolutions, security against adversaries with unbounded power of computation is\nachieved by the quantum protocols due to entanglement. Further, in the context\nof secure multi-party quantum computation, for the first time we introduce\nrational parties, each of whom tries to maximize its utility by obtaining the\nfunction output alone. We adapt our quantum protocols for both the above types\nof functions in rational setting to achieve fairness and strict Nash\nequilibrium.\n", "  Surface waves on both superfluid 3He and 4He were examined with the premise,\nthat these inviscid media would represent ideal realizations for this fluid\ndynamics problem. The work on 3He is one of the first of its kind, but on 4He\nit was possible to produce much more complete set of data for meaningful\ncomparison with theoretical models. Most measurements were performed at the\nzero temperature limit, meaning T < 100 mK for 4He and T ~ 100 {\\mu}K for 3He.\nDozens of surface wave resonances, including up to 11 overtones, were observed\nand monitored as the liquid depth in the cell was varied. Despite of the wealth\nof data, perfect agreement with the constructed theoretical models could not be\nachieved.\n", "  We find that a uniformly accelerated particle detector coupled to the vacuum\ncan cool down as its acceleration increases, due to relativistic effects. We\nshow that in (1+1)-dimensions, a detector coupled to the scalar field vacuum\nfor finite timescales (but long enough to satisfy the KMS condition) has a KMS\ntemperature that decreases with acceleration, in certain regimes. This\ncontrasts with the heating that one would expect from the Unruh effect.\n", "  The majority of studies performed on the formation of surface features by\nfemtosecond laser radiation focuses on single scan procedures, i.e. solely\nmanipulating the laser beam once over the target area to fabricate different\nsurface topographies. In this work, the effect of scanning stainless steel 304\nmultiple times with femtosecond laser pulses is thoroughly investigated over a\nwide range of fluences. The resultant laser-induced surface topographies can be\ncategorized into two different regimes. In the low fluence regime\n$(F_{{\\Sigma}line,max} < 130 ~J/cm^2)$, ellipsoidal cones (randomly distributed\nsurface protrusions covered by several layers of nanoparticles) are formed.\nBased on chemical, crystallographic, and topographical analyses, we conclude\nthat these ellipsoidal cones are composed of unablated steel whose conical\ngeometry offers a significant degree of fluence reduction (35-52%). Therefore,\nthe rest of the irradiated area is preferentially ablated at a higher rate than\nthe ellipsoidal cones. The second, or high fluence regime\n$(F_{{\\Sigma}line,max} > 130~ J/cm^2)$ consists of laser-induced surface\npatterns such as columnar and chaotic structures. Here, the surface topography\nshowed little to no change even when the target was scanned repeatedly. This is\nin stark contrast to the ellipsoidal cones in the first regime, which evolve\nand grow continuously as more laser passes are applied.\n", "  The relation of quarteting and clustering in atomic nuclei is discussed based\non symmetry-considerations. This connection enables us to predict a complete\nhigh-energy cluster spectrum from the description of the low-energy quartet\npart. As an example the $^{28}$Si nucleus is considered, including its\nwell-established ground-state region, the recently proposed superdeformed band,\nand the high-lying molecular resonances.\n", "  We probe quantum Hall effect in a tunable 1-D lateral superlattice (SL) in\ngraphene created using electrostatic gates. Lack of equilibration is observed\nalong edge states formed by electrostatic gates inside the superlattice. We\ncreate strong local electric field at the interface of regions of different\ncharge densities. Crossed electric and magnetic fields modify the wavefunction\nof the Landau Levels (LLs) - a phenomenon unique to graphene. In the region of\ncopropagating electrons and holes at the interface, the electric field is high\nenough to modify the Landau levels resulting in increased scattering that tunes\nequilibration of edge states and this results in large longitudinal resistance.\n", "  The theory of cosmological fluctuations assumes that the pre-inflationary\nstate of the universe was the quantum vacuum of a scalar field(s) coupled to\ngravity. The observed cosmic microwave background fluctuations are then\ninterpreted as quantum fluctuations. Here we consider alternate interpretations\nof the classic calculations of scalar and tensor power spectra by replacing the\nBunch-Davies quantum vacuum with a classical statistical distribution, which\nmay have been the consequence of a pre-inflationary process of decoherence as\nin the quantum cosmology literature. Mathematically they are essentially\nidentical calculations. However if one takes the latter interpretation then one\nmight replace the Planck length by for instance the fundamental length scale of\nstring theory. In particular this changes the relation between the scale of\ninflation and the scalar power spectrum but leaves the parameter(s)\ncharacterizing the bi-spectrum unchanged at leading order. Differences will\noccur however at higher order in the loop expansion. We also discuss the\nrelation to theories with low sound speed and/or a period of dissipation during\ninflation (warm inflation).\n", "  The early stages of drop impact onto a solid surface are considered. Detailed\nnumerical simulations and detailed asymptotic analysis of the process reveal a\nself-similar structure both for the velocity field and the pressure field. The\nlatter is shown to exhibit a maximum not near the impact point, but rather at\nthe contact line. The motion of the contact line is furthermore shown to\nexhibit a 'tank treading' motion. These observations are apprehended at the\nlight of a variant of Wagner theory for liquid impact. This framework offers a\nsimple analogy where the fluid motion within the impacting drop may be viewed\nas the flow induced by a flat rising expanding disk. The theoretical\npredictions are found to be in very close agreement both qualitatively and\nquantitatively with the numerical observations for about three decades in time.\nInterestingly the inviscid self-similar impact pressure and velocities are\nshown to depend solely on the self-similar variables $(r/\\sqrt{t},z/\\sqrt{t})$.\nThe structure of the boundary layer developing along the wet substrate is\ninvestigated as well, and is proven to be formally analogous to that of the\nboundary layer growing in the trail of a shockwave. Interestingly, the boundary\nlayer structure only depends on the impact self-similar variables. This allows\nto construct a seamless uniform analytical solution encompassing both impact\nand viscous effects. The depiction of the different dynamical fields enables to\nquantitatively predict observables of interest, such as the evolution of the\nintegral viscous shearing force and of the net normal force.\n", "  We derive an extension to the quantum regression theorem which facilitates\nthe calculation of two-time correlation functions and emission spectra for\nsystems undergoing non-Markovian evolution. The derivation exploits projection\noperator techniques, with which we obtain explicit equations of motion for the\ncorrelation functions, making only a second order expansion in the\nsystem--environment coupling strength, and invoking the Born approximation at a\nfixed initial time. The results are used to investigate a driven semiconductor\nquantum dot coupled to an acoustic phonon bath, where we find the non-Markovian\nnature of the dynamics has observable signatures in the form of phonon\nsidebands in the resonance fluorescence emission spectrum. Furthermore, we use\nrecently developed non-Markovianity measures to demonstrate an associated flow\nof information from the phonon bath back into the quantum dot exciton system.\n", "  Transport phenomena on a quantum scale appear in a variety of systems,\nranging from photosynthetic complexes to engineered quantum devices. It has\nbeen predicted that the efficiency of quantum transport can be enhanced through\ndynamic interaction between the system and a noisy environment. We report the\nfirst experimental demonstration of such environment-assisted quantum\ntransport, using an engineered network of laser-written waveguides, with\nrelative energies and inter-waveguide couplings tailored to yield the desired\nHamiltonian. Controllable decoherence is simulated via broadening the bandwidth\nof the input illumination, yielding a significant increase in transport\nefficiency relative to the narrowband case. We show integrated optics to be\nsuitable for simulating specific target Hamiltonians as well as open quantum\nsystems with controllable loss and decoherence.\n", "  We study $SO(d+1)$ invariant solutions of the classical vacuum Einstein\nequations in $p+d+3$ dimensions. In the limit $d \\to \\infty$ with $p$ held\nfixed we construct a class of solutions labelled by the shape of a membrane\n(the event horizon), together with a `velocity' field that lives on this\nmembrane. We demonstrate that our metrics can be corrected to nonsingular\nsolutions at first sub-leading order in $\\frac{1}{d}$ if and only if the\nmembrane shape and `velocity' field obey equations of motion which we\ndetermine. These equations define a well posed initial value problem for the\nmembrane shape and this `velocity' and so completely determinethe dynamics of\nthe black hole. They may be viewed as governing the non-linear dynamics of the\nlight quasi normal modes of Emparan, Suzuki and Tanabe.\n", "  The notion of equality between two observables will play many important roles\nin foundations of quantum theory. However, the standard probabilistic\ninterpretation based on the conventional Born formula does not give the\nprobability of equality between two arbitrary observables, since the Born\nformula gives the probability distribution only for a commuting family of\nobservables. In this paper, quantum set theory developed by Takeuti and the\npresent author is used to systematically extend the standard probabilistic\ninterpretation of quantum theory to define the probability of equality between\ntwo arbitrary observables in an arbitrary state. We apply this new\ninterpretation to quantum measurement theory, and establish a logical basis for\nthe difference between simultaneous measurability and simultaneous\ndeterminateness.\n", "  Thanks to the large collecting area (3 x ~1500 cm$^2$ at 1.5 keV) and wide\nfield of view (30' across in full field mode) of the X-ray cameras on board the\nEuropean Space Agency X-ray observatory XMM-Newton, each individual pointing\ncan result in the detection of hundreds of X-ray sources, most of which are\nnewly discovered. Recently, many improvements in the XMM-Newton data reduction\nalgorithms have been made. These include enhanced source characterisation and\nreduced spurious source detections, refined astrometric precision, greater net\nsensitivity and the extraction of spectra and time series for fainter sources,\nwith better signal-to-noise. Further, almost 50\\% more observations are in the\npublic domain compared to 2XMMi-DR3, allowing the XMM-Newton Survey Science\nCentre (XMM-SSC) to produce a much larger and better quality X-ray source\ncatalogue. The XMM-SSC has developed a pipeline to reduce the XMM-Newton data\nautomatically and using improved calibration a new catalogue version has been\nproduced from XMM-Newton data made public by 2013 Dec. 31 (13 years of data).\nManual screening ensures the highest data quality. This catalogue is known as\n3XMM. In the latest release, 3XMM-DR5, there are 565962 X-ray detections\ncomprising 396910 unique X-ray sources. For the 133000 brightest sources,\nspectra and lightcurves are provided. For all detections, the positions on the\nsky, a measure of the quality of the detection, and an evaluation of the X-ray\nvariability is provided, along with the fluxes and count rates in 7 X-ray\nenergy bands, the total 0.2-12 keV band counts, and four hardness ratios. To\nidentify the detections, a cross correlation with 228 catalogues is also\nprovided for each X-ray detection. 3XMM-DR5 is the largest X-ray source\ncatalogue ever produced. Thanks to the large array of data products, it is an\nexcellent resource in which to find new and extreme objects.\n", "  We study two generalizations of the asymmetric simple exclusion process with\ntwo types of particles. Particles of type 1 can jump over particles of type 2,\nwhile particles of type 2 can only influence the jump rates of particles of\ntype 1. We prove that the processes are self-dual and explicitly write the\nduality function. As an application, an expression for the r-th moment of the\nexponentiated current is written in terms of r-particle evolution.\n  The construction and proofs of duality are accomplished using symmetry of the\nquantum groups $U_q(\\mathfrak{gl}_3)$ and $U_q(\\mathfrak{sp}_4)$, with each\nnode in the Dynkin diagram corresponding to a particle type, and the number of\nedges corresponding to the jump rates.\n", "  One of the important function in optical communication system is the\ndistribution of information encoded in an optical beam. It is not a problem to\naccomplish this in a classical system since classical information can be copied\nat will. However, challenges arise in quantum system because extra quantum\nnoise is often added when the information content of a quantum state is\ndistributed to various users. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a quantum\ninformation tap by using a fiber optical parametric amplifier (FOPA) with\ncorrelated inputs, whose noise is reduced by the destructive quantum\ninterference through quantum entanglement between the signal and the idler\ninput fields. By measuring the noise figure of the FOPA and comparing with a\nregular FOPA, we observe an improvement of 0.7+-0.1 dB and 0.84+-0.09 dB from\nthe signal and idler outputs, respectively. When the low noise FOPA functions\nas an information splitter, the device has a total information transfer\ncoefficient of Ts+Ti=1.47+-0.2, which is greater than the classical limit of 1.\nMoreover, this fiber based device works at the 1550 nm telecom band, so it is\ncompatible with the current fiber-optical network.\n", "  The Kleinmann-Low nebula in Orion (Orion-KL) is the nearest example of a\nhigh-mass star-forming environment. For the first time, we complemented 1.3 mm\nSubmillimeter Array (SMA) interferometric line survey with IRAM 30 m\nsingle-dish observations of the Orion-KL region. Covering a 4 GHz bandwidth in\ntotal, this survey contains over 160 emission lines from 20 species (25\nisotopologues), including 11 complex organic molecules (COMs).\n  At a spatial resolution of 1200 AU, the continuum substructures are resolved.\nExtracting the spectra from individual substructures and providing the\nintensity-integrated distribution map for each species, we studied the\nsmall-scale chemical variations in this region. Our main results are: (1) We\nidentify lines from the low-abundance COMs CH3COCH3 and CH3CH2OH, as well as\ntentatively detect CH3CHO and long carbon-chains C6H and HC7N. (2) We find that\nwhile most COMs are segregated by type, peaking either towards the hot core\n(e.g., N-bearing species) or the compact ridge (e.g., O-bearing species like\nHCOOCH3 and CH3OCH3), while the distributions of others do not follow this\nsegregated structure (e.g., CH3CH2OH, CH3OH, CH3COCH3). (3) We find a second\nvelocity component of HNCO, SO2, 34SO2, and SO lines, which may be associated\nwith a strong shock event in the low-velocity outflow. (4) Temperatures and\nmolecular abundances show large gradients between central condensations and the\noutflow regions, illustrating a transition between hot molecular core and\nshock-chemistry dominated regimes.\n  Our observations of spatially resolved chemical variations in Orion-KL\nprovide the nearest reference source for hot molecular core and outflow\nchemistry, which will be an important example for interpreting the chemistry of\nmore distant HMSFRs.\n", "  Due to potential level of energy intensity 178m2Hf is an extremely\ninteresting isomer. One possible way to produce this isomer is irradiation of\nnat-Ta or nat-W samples with high energy protons. Irradiation of nat-Ta and\nnat-W samples performed for other purposes provides an opportunity to study the\ncorresponding reactions. This paper pre-sents the 178m2Hf independent\nproduction cross sections for both targets measured by the gamma-ray\nspectrometry method. The reaction excitation functions have been obtained for\nthe proton energies from 40 up to 2600 MeV. The experimental results were\ncompared with calculations by various versions of the intranuclear cascade\nmodel in the well-known codes: ISABEL, Bertini, INCL4.5+ABLA07, PHITS,\nCASCADE07 and CEM03.02. The isomer ratio for the nat-Ta(p,x)178m2Hf reaction is\nevaluated on the basis of the available data.\n", "  The dynamical behavior of open quantum systems plays a key role in many\napplications of quantum mechanics, examples ranging from fundamental problems,\nsuch as the environment-induced decay of quantum coherence and relaxation in\nmany-body systems, to applications in condensed matter theory, quantum\ntransport, quantum chemistry and quantum information. In close analogy to a\nclassical Markov process, the interaction of an open quantum system with a\nnoisy environment is often modelled by a dynamical semigroup with a generator\nin Lindblad form, which describes a memoryless dynamics leading to an\nirreversible loss of characteristic quantum features. However, in many\napplications open systems exhibit pronounced memory effects and a revival of\ngenuine quantum properties such as quantum coherence and correlations. Here,\nrecent results on the rich non-Markovian quantum dynamics of open systems are\ndiscussed, paying particular attention to the rigorous mathematical definition,\nto the physical interpretation and classification, as well as to the\nquantification of memory effects. The general theory is illustrated by a series\nof examples. The analysis reveals that memory effects of the open system\ndynamics reflect characteristic features of the environment which opens a new\nperspective for applications, namely to exploit a small open system as a\nquantum probe signifying nontrivial features of the environment it is\ninteracting with. This article further explores the various physical sources of\nnon-Markovian quantum dynamics, such as structured spectral densities, nonlocal\ncorrelations between environmental degrees of freedom and correlations in the\ninitial system-environment state, in addition to developing schemes for their\nlocal detection. Recent experiments on the detection, quantification and\ncontrol of non-Markovian quantum dynamics are also discussed.\n", "  Light transport in a metal with two-dimensional hole arrays is considered.\nAnalytical expression for a transmission coefficient in periodic, isolated and\ndisordered cases are derived, assuming the existence of waveguide modes\ntransverse tunneling in two-dimensional plane perpendicular to traveling\ndirection of light. The one dimensional case of periodic holes, due to its\nsimplicity, is investigated in detail. In the dilute metal regime, when metal\nfraction is small, our numerical study of the transmission coefficient of\ncentral diffracted wave indicates the existence of a minimum which is\ncompletely independent of an incident wavelength. Further increasing of metal\nfraction leads to the unusual monotonic increasing of central diffracted wave\ntransmission. The role of the surface plasmons is discussed.\n", "  Nuclear energy released by splitting Uranium and Thorium isotopes into two,\nthree, four, up to eight fragments with nearly equal size are studied. We found\nthat the energy released come from equally splitting the $^{235,238}$U and\n$^{230,232}$Th nuclei into to three fragments is largest. The statistical\nmultifragmentation model is employed to calculate the probability of different\nbreakup channels for the excited nuclei. Weighing the the probability\ndistributions of fragments multiplicity at different excitation energies for\nthe $^{238}$U nucleus, we found that an excitation energy between 1.2 and 2\nMeV/u is optimal for the $^{235}$U, $^{238}$U, $^{230}$Th and $^{232}$Th nuclei\nto release nuclear energy of about 0.7-0.75 MeV/u.\n", "  In this paper we show an application of the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)\nclustering method to the high-energy gamma-ray sky observed at energies higher\nthan 10 GeV in 6.3 years by the Fermi-Large Area Telescope. We report the\ndetection of 19 new high-energy gamma-ray clusters with good selection\nparameters whose centroid coordinates were found matching the positions of\nknown BL Lac objects in the 5th Edition of the Roma-BZCAT catalogue. A brief\nsummary of the properties of these sources is presented.\n", "  We have developed experimental methods for the generation of chirped laser\npulses of controlled frequency evolution in the nanosecond pulse length range\nfor coherent atomic interaction studies. The pulses are sliced from the\nradiation of a cw external cavity diode laser while its drive current, and\nconsequently its frequency, are sinusoidally modulated. By the proper choice of\nthe modulation parameters, as well as of the timing of pulse slicing, we can\nproduce a wide variety of frequency sweep ranges during the pulse. In order to\nobtain the required frequency chirp, we need to stabilize the center frequency\nof the modulated laser and to measure the resulting frequency evolution with\nappropriate temporal resolution. These tasks have been solved by creating a\nbeat signal with a reference laser locked to an atomic transition frequency.\nThe beat signal is then analyzed, as well as its spectral sideband peaks are\nfed back to the electronics of the frequency stabilization of the modulated\nlaser. This method is simple and it has the possibility for high speed\nfrequency sweep with narrow bandwidth that is appropriate, for example, for\nselective manipulation of atomic states in a magneto-optical trap.\n", "  Recently, the perovskite BiCoO$_3$ has been shown experimentally to be\nisostructural with PbTiO$_3$, while simultaneously the $d^6$ Co$^{3+}$ ion has\na high spin ground state with $C$-type antiferromagnetic ordering. Using hybrid\ndensity functional calculations, we investigate the atomic, electronic and\nmagnetic structure of BiCoO$_3$ to elucidate the origin of the multiferroic\nstate. To begin with, we perform a qualitative trend sudy of the role of $d$\nelectrons in affecting the tendency for perovskite materials to exhibit a\nferroelectric distortion; this work initially explores a qualitative trend\nstudy in artificial cubic and tetragonal LaBO$_3$ perovskites. We choose La as\nthe A-cation so as to remove the effects of Bi $6s$ hybridization. Through\nfirst-principles calculations of the LaBO$_3$ series, where B is a $d^0 - d^8$\ncation from the $3d$-block, the trend study reveals that increasing the $d$\norbital occupation initially removes the tendency for a polar distortion, as\nexpected. However, for high spin $d^5-d^7$ and $d^8$ cations a strong\nferroelectric instability is recovered. We explained this effect in terms of\nthe pseudo Jahn-Teller theory for ferroelectricity. It is shown that, in some\ncases, unpaired electron spins actually drive ferroelectricity, rather than\ninhibit it, which represents a shift in the understanding of how\nferroelectricity and magnetism interact in perovskite oxides. It follows, that\nfor the case of BiCoO$_3$, the Co$^{3+}$ ion plays a major role in the\nferroelectric lattice instability. Importantly, the ferroelectric polarization\nis greatly enhanced when the Co$^{3+}$ ion is in the high spin state, when\ncompared to the nonmagnetic, low spin state, and a large coupling of the\nelectrical and magnetic polarization is present. Importantly, it is\ndemonstrated that the ground spin state is switched by reducing the internal\nferroelectric polarization.\n", "  The overall characteristics of the solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillation\nare approximately consistent with a tribimaximal form of the mixing matrix $U$\nof the lepton sector. Exact tribimaximal mixing leads to $\\theta_{13}=0$.\nHowever, recent results from Daya Bay and RENO experiments have established a\nnonzero value for $\\theta_{13}$. Keeping the leading behavior of $U$ as\ntribimaximal, we use a generalized Fridberg-Lee neutrino mass model along with\na complementary ansatz to incorporate a nonzero $\\theta_{13}$ along with CP\nviolation. We generalize this model in two stages: In the first stage we assume\n$\\mu-\\tau$ symmetry and add imaginary components which leads to nonzero phases.\nIn the second stage we add a perturbation with real components which breaks the\n$\\mu-\\tau$ symmetry and this leads to a nonzero value for $\\theta_{13}$. The\ncombination of these two generalizations leads to CP violation. Using only two\nof the experimental data, we can fix all of the parameters of our model and\npredict not only values for the other experimental data, which agree well with\nthe available data, but also the masses of neutrinos and the CP violating\nphases and parameters. These predictions include the following: $\\langle\nm_{\\nu_e} \\rangle\\approx(0.033-0.037)~eV$, $\\langle m_{\\nu_\\mu}\n\\rangle\\approx(0.043-0.048)~ eV$, $\\langle m_{\\nu_\\tau}\n\\rangle\\approx(0.046-0.051)~ eV$, and $59.21^{\\circ}\\lesssim \\delta\\lesssim\n59.34^{\\circ}$\n", "  We study the probability that two directed polymers in the same random\npotential do not intersect. We use the replica method to map the problem onto\nthe attractive Lieb-Liniger model with generalized statistics between\nparticles. We obtain analytical expressions for the first few moments of this\nprobability, and compare them to a numerical simulation of a discrete model at\nhigh-temperature. From these observations, several large time properties of the\nnon-crossing probabilities are conjectured. Extensions of our formalism to more\ngeneral observables are discussed.\n", "  Spin-polarised radio-frequency currents, whose frequency is equal to that of\nthe gyrotropic mode, will cause an excitation of the core of a magnetic vortex\nconfined in a magnetic tunnel junction. When the excitation radius of the\nvortex core is greater than that of the junction radius, vortex core expulsion\nis observed, leading to a large change in resistance, as the layer enters a\npredominantly uniform magnetisation state. Unlike the conventional spin-torque\ndiode effect, this highly tunable resonant effect will generate a voltage which\ndoes not decrease as a function of rf power, and has the potential to form the\nbasis of a new generation of tunable nanoscale radio-frequency detectors.\n", "  The widths, dispersion measures, dispersion indices and fluences of Fast\nRadio Bursts (FRB) impose coupled constraints that all models must satisfy.\nObservation of dispersion indices close to their low density limit of $-2$ sets\na model-independent upper bound on the electron density and a lower bound on\nthe size of any dispersive plasma cloud. The non-monotonic dependence of burst\nwidths (after deconvolution of instrumental effects) on dispersion measure\nexcludes the intergalactic medium as the location of scattering that broadens\nthe FRB in time. Temporal broadening far greater than that of pulsars at\nsimilar high Galactic latitudes implies that scattering occurs close to the\nsources, where high densities and strong turbulence are plausible. FRB\nenergetics are consistent with supergiant pulses from young, fast, high-field\npulsars at cosmological distances. The distribution of FRB dispersion measures\nis inconsistent with expanding clouds (such as SNR). It excludes space-limited\ndistributions (such as the local supercluster), but agrees with a homogeneous\ncosmological distribution with intergalactic dispersion. The FRB\n$\\log{N}$--$\\log{S}$ relation also indicates a cosmological distribution, aside\nfrom the anomalously bright Lorimer burst.\n", "  The main contribution of this paper is to derive an explicit expression for\nthe fundamental precision bound, the Holevo bound, for estimating any\ntwo-parameter family of qubit mixed-states in terms of quantum versions of\nFisher information. The obtained formula depends solely on the symmetric\nlogarithmic derivative (SLD), the right logarithmic derivative (RLD) Fisher\ninformation, and a given weight matrix. This result immediately provides\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for the following two important classes of\nquantum statistical models; the Holevo bound coincides with the SLD Cramer-Rao\nbound and it does with the RLD Cramer-Rao bound. One of the important results\nof this paper is that a general model other than these two special cases\nexhibits an unexpected property: The structure of the Holevo bound changes\nsmoothly when the weight matrix varies. In particular, it always coincides with\nthe RLD Cramer-Rao bound for a certain choice of the weight matrix. Several\nexamples illustrate these findings.\n", "  We study a class of two-dimensional ${\\cal N}=(0, 4)$ quiver gauge theories\nthat flow to superconformal field theories. We find dualities for the\nsuperconformal field theories similar to the 4d ${\\cal N}=2$ theories of class\n${\\cal S}$, labelled by a Riemann surface ${\\cal C}$. The dual descriptions\narise from various pair-of-pants decompositions, that involves an analog of the\n$T_N$ theory. Especially, we find the superconformal index of such theories can\nbe written in terms of a topological field theory on ${\\cal C}$. We interpret\nthis class of SCFTs as the ones coming from compactifying 6d ${\\cal N}=(2, 0)$\ntheory on $\\mathbb{CP}^1 \\times {\\cal C}$\n", "  We study an ensemble of random walkers carrying internal noisy phase\noscillators which are synchronized among the walkers by local interactions. Due\nto individual mobility, the interaction partners of every walker change\nrandomly, hereby introducing an additional, independent source of fluctuations,\nthus constituting the intrinsic nonequilibrium nature of the temporal dynamics.\nWe employ this paradigmatic model system to discuss how the emergence of order\nis affected by motion of individual entities. In particular, we consider both,\nnormal diffusive motion and superdiffusion. A non-Hamiltonian field theory\nincluding multiplicative noise terms is derived which describes the\nnonequilibrium dynamics at the macroscale. This theory reveals a\ndefect-mediated transition from incoherence to quasi long-range order for\nnormal diffusion of oscillators in two dimensions, implying a power-law\ndependence of all synchronization properties on system size. In contrast,\nsuperdiffusive transport suppresses the emergence of topological defects,\nthereby inducing a continuous synchronization transition to long-range order in\ntwo dimensions. These results are consistent with particle-based simulations.\n", "  Screening is one of the most important concepts in the study of charged\nsystems. Near a dielectric interface, the ion distribution in a salt solution\ncan be highly nonuniform. Here, we develop a theory that self-consistently\ntreats the inhomogeneous screening effects. At higher concentrations when the\nbulk Debye screening length is comparable to the Bjerrum length, the double\nlayer structure and interfacial properties are significantly affected by the\ninhomogeneous screening. In particular, the depletion zone is considerably\nwider than that predicted by the bulk screening approximation or the WKB\napproximation. For asymmetric salts, the inhomogeneous screening leads to\nenhanced charge separation and surface potential.\n", "  It is shown that whenever the multiplicative normalization of a fitting\nfunction is not known, least square fitting by $\\chi^2$ minimization can be\nperformed with one parameter less than usual by converting the normalization\nparameter into a function of the remaining parameters and the data.\n", "  We present a physical model for electronic switching in cantilever based\nnano-electro-mechanical field effect transistors, focusing on the steepness of\nits switching curve. We find that the subthreshold swing of the voltage\ntransfer characteristic is governed by two separate considerations - the\nability of the charges to correlate together through dipolar interactions and\namplify the active torque, versus the active pull-in forces that drive an\nabrupt phase transition and close the air gap between the tip of the cantilever\nand the drain. For small sized relays, dipolar and short-range Van Der Waals\n'sticking' forces dominate, while for longer cantilevers the capacitive energy\nacquires a major role. The individual pull-in and pull-out phases demonstrate a\nremarkably low subthreshold swing driven by the capacitive forces, sharpened\nfurther by dipolar correlation. The sharp switching, however, comes at the\nexpense of strong hysteresis as the metastable and stable states interchange\nalong the forward and reverse phases of the voltage scan.\n", "  The analysis of all published results on electrons and holes impact\nionization coefficients in 4H-SiC at 300K have been performed. It is shown that\nthe most plausible approximation of dependencies $\\alpha_{n,p}$ on the electric\nfield strength $E$ have a conventional kind\n$\\alpha_{n,p}=a_{n,p}\\exp(-E_{n,p}/E)$ with the values of the fitting\nparameters $a_n=38.6\\cdot 10^6$ 1/cm, $E_n=25.6$ MV/cm, $a_p=5.31\\cdot 10^6$\n1/cm, $E_p=13.1$ MV/cm. These dependencies $\\alpha_{n,p}(E)$ have been used to\ncalculate the maximum field strength $E_b$ and the thickness of the space\ncharge region $w_b$ at the breakdown voltage $U_b$. A set of new formulas are\npresented for calculation of $\\alpha_{n,p}(E)$ from results of avalanche\nmultiplication coefficients and excess noise factor measurements at one-side\nlighting of photodiodes with stepped doping.\n", "  We propose a convex variational approach to compute localized density\nmatrices for both zero temperature and finite temperature cases, by adding an\nentry-wise $\\ell_1$ regularization to the free energy of the quantum system.\nBased on the fact that the density matrix decays exponential away from the\ndiagonal for insulating system or system at finite temperature, the proposed\n$\\ell_1$ regularized variational method provides a nice way to approximate the\noriginal quantum system. We provide theoretical analysis of the approximation\nbehavior and also design convergence guaranteed numerical algorithms based on\nBregman iteration. More importantly, the $\\ell_1$ regularized system naturally\nleads to localized density matrices with banded structure, which enables us to\ndevelop approximating algorithms to find the localized density matrices with\ncomputation cost linearly dependent on the problem size.\n", "  A functional method for calculating averages of the time-ordered exponential\nof a continuous isotropic random $N\\times N$ matrix process is presented. The\nprocess is not assumed to be Gaussian. In particular, the Lyapunov exponents\nand higher correlation functions of the T-exponent are derived from the\nstatistical properties of the process.\n  The approach may be of use in a wide range of physical problems. For example,\nin theory of turbulence the account of non-gaussian statistics is very\nimportant since the non-Gaussian behavior is responsible for the time asymmetry\nof the energy flow.\n", "  In this work, we consider complementary lattice arrays in order to enable a\nbroader range of designs for coded aperture imaging systems. We provide a\ngeneral framework and methods that generate richer and more flexible designs\nthan existing ones. Besides this, we review and interpret the state-of-the-art\nuniformly redundant arrays (URA) designs, broaden the related concepts, and\nfurther propose some new design methods.\n", "  One of the great challenges of electronic structure theory is the quest for\nthe exact functional of density functional theory. Its existence is proven, but\nit is a complicated multivariable functional that is almost impossible to\nconceptualize. In this paper, the asymmetric two-site Hubbard model is studied,\nwhich has a two-dimensional universe of density matrices. The exact functional\nbecomes a simple function of two variables whose three dimensional energy\nlandscape can be visualized and explored. A walk on this unique landscape,\ntilted to an angle defined by the one-electron Hamiltonian, gives a valley\nwhose minimum is the exact total energy. This is contrasted with the landscape\nof some approximate functionals, explaining their failure for electron transfer\nin the strongly correlated limit. We show concrete examples of pure-state\ndensity matrices that are not $v$-representable due to the underlying\nnon-convex nature of the energy landscape. For the first time, the exact\nfunctional is calculated for all numbers of electrons, including fractional,\nallowing the derivative discontinuity to be visualized and understood. The\nfundamental gap for all possible systems is obtained solely from the\nderivatives of the exact functional.\n", "  Rotationally coherent Lagrangian vortices are formed by tubes of deforming\nfluid elements that complete equal bulk material rotation relative to the mean\nrotation of the deforming fluid volume. We show that initial positions of such\ntubes coincide with tubular level surfaces of the Lagrangian-Averaged Vorticity\nDeviation (LAVD), the trajectory integral of the normed difference of the\nvorticity from its spatial mean. LAVD-based vortices are objective, i.e.,\nremain unchanged under time-dependent rotations and translations of the\ncoordinate frame. In the limit of vanishing Rossby numbers in geostrophic\nflows, cyclonic LAVD vortex centers are precisely the observed attractors for\nlight particles. A similar result holds for heavy particles in anticyclonic\nLAVD vortices. We also establish a relationship between rotationally coherent\nLagrangian vortices and their instantaneous Eulerian counterparts. The latter\nare formed by tubular surfaces of equal material rotation rate, objectively\nmeasured by the Instantaneous Vorticity Deviation (IVD). We illustrate the use\nof the LAVD and the IVD to detect rotationally coherent Lagrangian and Eulerian\nvortices objectively in several two- and three-dimensional flows.\n", "  We propose and theoretically investigate an unambiguous Bell measurement of\natomic qubits assisted by multiphoton states. The atoms interact resonantly\nwith the electromagnetic field inside two spatially separated optical cavities\nin a Ramsey-type interaction sequence. The qubit states are postselected by\nmeasuring the photonic states inside the resonators. We show that if one is\nable to project the photonic field onto two coherent states on opposite sites\nof phase space, an unambiguous Bell measurement can be implemented. Thus our\nproposal may provide a core element for future components of quantum\ninformation technology such as a quantum repeater based on coherent multiphoton\nstates, atomic qubits and matter-field interaction.\n", "  Electron spin takes critical role in almost all novel phenomena discovered in\nmodern condensed matter physics (High-temperature superconductivity, Kondo\neffect, Giant Magnetoresistance, topological insulator, quantum anomalous Hall\neffect, etc.). However, the measurements for electron spin is of poor quality\nwhich blocks the development of material sciences because of the low efficiency\nof spin polarimeter. Here we show an imaging type exchange-scattering spin\npolarimeter with 5 orders more efficiency compared with a classical Mott\npolarimeter. As a demonstration, the fine spin structure of electronic states\nin bismuth (111) is investigated, showing the strong Rashba type spin splitting\nbehavior in both bulk and surface states. This improvement pave the way to\nstudy novel spin related phenomena with unprecedented accuracy.\n", "  Recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements of Co-doped\nLiFeAs report a large and robust superconducting gap on the $\\Gamma$-centered\nhole band that lies 8 meV below the Fermi level. We show that, unlike a\nconventional superconductor described by BCS theory, a multiband system with\nstrong interband Coulomb interactions can explain these observations. We model\nLiFeAs with a five-band model in which the shallow hole band is coupled with\nthe other bands by only Coulomb interactions. Using Eliashberg theory, we find\nreasonable interaction parameters that reproduce the $T_c$ and all five gaps of\nLiFeAs. The energy independence of the Coulomb interactions then ensures the\nrobustness of the gap induced on the shallow band. Furthermore, due to the\nrepulsive nature of the Coulomb interactions, the gap changes sign between the\nshallow band and the other hole pockets, corresponding to an unconventional\n$s_{\\pm}$ gap symmetry. Unlike other families of iron-based superconductors,\nthe gap symmetry of LiFeAs has not been ascertained experimentally. The\nexperimental implications of this sign-changing state are discussed.\n", "  The physics impact of a staged approach for double-beta decay experiments\nbased on Ge-76 is studied. The scenario considered relies on realistic time\nschedules envisioned by the GERDA and the MAJORANA collaborations, which are\njointly working towards the realization of a future larger scale Ge-76\nexperiment. Intermediate stages of the experiments are conceived to perform\nquasi background-free measurements, and different data sets can be reliably\ncombined to maximize the physics outcome. The sensitivity for such a global\nanalysis is presented, with focus on how neutrino flavor models can be probed\nalready with preliminary phases of the experiments. The synergy between theory\nand experiment yields strong benefits for both sides: the model predictions can\nbe used to sensibly plan the experimental stages, and results from intermediate\nstages can be used to constrain whole groups of theoretical scenarios. This\nstrategy clearly generates added value to the experimental efforts, while at\nthe same time it allows to achieve valuable physics results as early as\npossible.\n", "  We discuss a new mechanism in which non-perturbative quantum gravity effects\ndirectly generate a Majorana mass for the neutron. In particular, in string\ntheory, exotic instantons can generate an effective six quark operator by\ncalculable mixed disk amplitudes. In a low string scale scenario, with\n$M_{S}\\simeq 10\\div 10^{5}\\, \\rm TeV$, a neutron-antineutron oscillation can be\nreached in the next generation of experiments. we argue that protons and\nneutralinos are not destabilized and that dangerous FCNCs are not generated. We\nshow an example of quiver theories, locally free by tadpoles and anomalies,\nreproducing MSSM plus a Majorana neutron and a Majorana neutrino. These models\nnaturally provide a viable baryogenesis mechanism by resonant RH neutrino\ndecays, as well as a stable WIMP-like dark matter. We also discuss how LHC data\nwill provide useful inputs for our model, in the immediate future, testing\nseveral different regions of the parameter space. Such a mechanism represents a\nsimple and calculable counter-example to the Wilsonian UV completion of\neffective non-renormalizable operators.\n", "  We study an analog of the well-known Gel'fand Pinsker Channel which uses\nquantum states for the transmission of the data. We consider the case where\nboth the sender's inputs to the channel and the channel states are to be taken\nfrom a finite set (cq-channel with state information at the sender). We\ndistinguish between causal and non-causal channel state information at the\nsender. The receiver remains ignorant, throughout. We give a single-letter\ndescription of the capacity in the first case. In the second case we present\ntwo different regularized expressions for the capacity. It is an astonishing\nand unexpected result of our work that a simple change from causal to\nnon-causal channel state information at the encoder causes the complexity of a\nnumerical computation of the capacity formula to change from trivial to\nseemingly difficult. Still, even the non-single letter formula allows one to\ndraw nontrivial conclusions, for example regarding continuity of the capacity\nwith respect to changes in the system parameters. The direct parts of both\ncoding theorems are based on a special class of POVMs which are derived from\northogonal projections onto certain representations of the symmetric groups.\nThis approach supports a reasoning that is inspired by the classical method of\ntypes. In combination with the non-commutative union bound these POVMs yield an\nelegant method of proof for the direct part of the coding theorem in the first\ncase.\n", "  Evaluation of link prediction methods is a hard task in very large complex\nnetworks because of the inhibitive computational cost. By setting a lower bound\nof the number of common neighbors (CN), we propose a new framework to\nefficiently and precisely evaluate the performances of CN-based similarity\nindices in link prediction for very large heterogeneous networks. Specifically,\nwe propose a fast algorithm based on the parallel computing scheme to obtain\nall the node pairs with CN values larger than the lower bound. Furthermore, we\npropose a new measurement, called self-predictability, to quantify the\nperformance of the CN-based similarity indices in link prediction, which on the\nother side can indicate the link predictability of a network.\n", "  Odlyzko has computed a data set listing more than $10^9$ successive Riemann\nzeros, starting at a zero number beyond $10^{23}$. The data set relates to\nrandom matrix theory since, according to the Montgomery-Odlyzko law, the\nstatistical properties of the large Riemann zeros agree with the statistical\nproperties of the eigenvalues of large random Hermitian matrices. Moreover,\nKeating and Snaith, and then Bogomolny and collaborators, have used $N \\times\nN$ random unitary matrices to analyse deviations from this law. We contribute\nto this line of study in two ways. First, we point out that a natural process\nto apply to the data set is to thin it by deleting each member independently\nwith some specified probability, and we proceed to compute empirical two-point\ncorrelation functions and nearest neighbour spacings in this setting. Second,\nwe show how to characterise the order $1/N^2$ correction term to the spacing\ndistribution for random unitary matrices in terms of a second order\ndifferential equation with coefficients that are Painlev\\'e transcendents, and\nwhere the thinning parameter appears only in the boundary condition. This\nequation can be solved numerically using a power series method. Comparison with\nthe Riemann zero data shows accurate agreement.\n", "  We present an experiment using a sample of laser-cooled Rb atoms to show that\ncross-phase modulation schemes continue to benefit from\nelectromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) even as the transparency window\nis made narrower than the signal bandwidth (i.e., for signal pulses much\nshorter than the response time of the EIT system). Addressing concerns that\nnarrow EIT windows might not prove useful for such applications, we show that\nwhile the peak phase shift saturates in this regime, it does not drop, and the\ntime-integrated effect continues to scale inversely with EIT window width. This\nintegrated phase shift is an important figure of merit for tasks such as the\ndetection of single-photon-induced cross phase shifts.\n", "  Nonclassicality cannot be a single-observable property since the statistics\nof any quantum observable is compatible with classical physics. We develop a\ngeneral procedure to reveal nonclassical behavior from the joint measurement of\nmultiple observables. This requires enlarged spaces and couplings with\nauxiliary degrees of freedom so it must be followed by an inversion procedure\nto infer system properties from the observed statistics. In particular this\ndiscloses nonclassical properties of standard examples of classical-like\nbehavior, such as SU(2) and Glauber coherent states. Moreover, when combined\nwith other criteria it would imply that every quantum state would be\nnonclassical.\n", "  In this paper we investigate the entropy of gravitational Chern-Simons terms\nfor the horizon with non-vanishing extrinsic curvatures, or the holographic\nentanglement entropy for arbitrary entangling surface. In 3D we find no anomaly\nof entropy appears. But the squashed cone method can not be used directly to\nget the correct result. For higher dimensions the anomaly of entropy would\nappear, still, we can not use the squashed cone method directly. That is\nbecasuse the Chern-Simons action is not gauge invariant. To get a reasonable\nresult we suggest two methods. One is by adding a boundary term to recover the\ngauge invariance. This boundary term can be derived from the variation of the\nChern-Simons action. The other one is by using the Chern-Simons relation\n$d\\bm{\\Omega_{4n-1}}=tr(\\bm{R}^{2n})$. We notice that the entropy of\n$tr(\\bm{R}^{2n})$ is a total derivative locally, i.e. $S=d s_{CS}$. We propose\nto identify $s_{CS}$ with the entropy of gravitational Chern-Simons terms\n$\\Omega_{4n-1}$. In the first method we could get the correct result for Wald\nentropy in arbitrary dimension. In the second approach, in addition to Wald\nentropy, we can also obtain the anomaly of entropy with non-zero extrinsic\ncurvatures. Our results imply that the entropy of a topological invariant, such\nas the Pontryagin term $tr(\\bm{R}^{2n})$ and the Euler density, is a\ntopological invariant on the entangling surface.\n", "  We study the impact of three stochastic parametrizations in the ocean\ncomponent of a coupled model, on forecast reliability over seasonal timescales.\nThe relative impacts of these schemes upon the ocean mean state and ensemble\nspread are analyzed. The oceanic variability induced by the atmospheric forcing\nof the coupled system is, in most regions, the major source of ensemble spread.\nThe largest impact on spread and bias came from the Stochastically Perturbed\nParametrization Tendency (SPPT) scheme - which has proven particularly\neffective in the atmosphere. The key regions affected are eddy-active regions,\nnamely the western boundary currents and the Southern Ocean. However, unlike\nits impact in the atmosphere, SPPT in the ocean did not result in a significant\ndecrease in forecast error. Whilst there are good grounds for implementing\nstochastic schemes in ocean models, our results suggest that they will have to\nbe more sophisticated. Some suggestions for next-generation stochastic schemes\nare made.\n", "  The quantum relative entropy between two states satisfies a monotonicity\nproperty meaning that applying the same quantum channel to both states can\nnever increase their relative entropy. It is known that this inequality is only\ntight when there is a \"recovery map\" that exactly reverses the effects of the\nquantum channel on both states. In this paper we strengthen this inequality by\nshowing that the difference of relative entropies is bounded below by the\nmeasured relative entropy between the first state and a recovered state from\nits processed version. The recovery map is a convex combination of rotated Petz\nrecovery maps and perfectly reverses the quantum channel on the second state.\nAs a special case we reproduce recent lower bounds on the conditional mutual\ninformation such as the one proved in [Fawzi and Renner, Commun. Math. Phys.,\n2015]. Our proof only relies on elementary properties of pinching maps and the\noperator logarithm.\n", "  Actin and myosin assemble into a thin layer of a highly dynamic network\nunderneath the membrane of eukaryotic cells. This network generates the forces\nthat drive cell and tissue-scale morphogenetic processes. The effective\nmaterial properties of this active network determine large-scale deformations\nand other morphogenetic events. For example,the characteristic time of stress\nrelaxation (the Maxwell time)in the actomyosin sets the time scale of\nlarge-scale deformation of the cortex. Similarly, the characteristic length of\nstress propagation (the hydrodynamic length) sets the length scale of slow\ndeformations, and a large hydrodynamic length is a prerequisite for long-ranged\ncortical flows. Here we introduce a method to determine physical parameters of\nthe actomyosin cortical layer (in vivo). For this we investigate the relaxation\ndynamics of the cortex in response to laser ablation in the one-cell-stage {\\it\nC. elegans} embryo and in the gastrulating zebrafish embryo. These responses\ncan be interpreted using a coarse grained physical description of the cortex in\nterms of a two dimensional thin film of an active viscoelastic gel. To\ndetermine the Maxwell time, the hydrodynamic length and the ratio of active\nstress and per-area friction, we evaluated the response to laser ablation in\ntwo different ways: by quantifying flow and density fields as a function of\nspace and time, and by determining the time evolution of the shape of the\nablated region. Importantly, both methods provide best fit physical parameters\nthat are in close agreement with each other and that are similar to previous\nestimates in the two systems. We provide an accurate and robust means for\nmeasuring physical parameters of the actomyosin cortical layer.It can be useful\nfor investigations of actomyosin mechanics at the cellular-scale, but also for\nproviding insights in the active mechanics processes that govern tissue-scale\nmorphogenesis.\n", "  Spin-orbit torque (SOT)-induced magnetization switching shows promise for\nrealizing ultrafast and reliable spintronics devices. Bipolar switching of\nperpendicular magnetization via SOT is achieved under an in-plane magnetic\nfield collinear with an applied current. Typical structures studied so far\ncomprise a nonmagnet/ferromagnet (NM/FM) bilayer, where the spin Hall effect in\nthe NM is responsible for the switching. Here we show that an\nantiferromagnet/ferromagnet (AFM/FM) bilayer system also exhibits a SOT large\nenough to switch the magnetization of FM. In this material system, thanks to\nthe exchange-bias effect of the AFM, we observe the switching under no applied\nfield by using an antiferromagnetic PtMn and ferromagnetic Co/Ni multilayer\nwith a perpendicular easy axis. Furthermore, tailoring the stack achieves a\nmemristor-like behaviour where a portion of the reversed magnetization can by\ncontrolled in an analogue manner. The AFM/FM system is thus a promising\nbuilding block for SOT devices as well as providing an attractive pathway\ntowards neuromorphic computing.\n", "  We consider a Schroediner operator in a periodic system of strip-like domains\ncoupled by small windows. As the windows close, the domain decouples into an\ninfinite series of identical domains. The operator similar to the original one\nbut on one copy of these identical domains has an essential spectrum. We show\nthat once there is a virtual level at the threshold of this essential spectrum,\nthe windows turns this virtual level into the spectral bands for the original\noperator. We study the structure and the asymptotic behavior of these bands.\n", "  This paper reports on a theoretical analysis of the rich variety of\nspatio-temporal patterns observed recently in inclined layer convection at\nmedium Prandtl number when varying the inclination angle $\\gamma$ and the\nRayleigh number $R$. The present numerical investigation of the inclined layer\nconvection system is based on the standard Oberbeck-Boussinesq equations. The\npatterns are shown to originate from a complicated competition of\nbuoyancy-driven and shear-flow driven pattern forming mechanisms. The former\nare expressed as \\rm{longitudinal} convection rolls with their axes oriented\nparallel to the incline, the latter as perpendicular \\rm{transverse} rolls.\nAlong with conventional methods to study roll patterns and their stability, we\nemploy direct numerical simulations in large spatial domains, comparable with\nthe experimental ones. As a result, we determine the phase diagram of the\ncharacteristic complex 3D convection patterns above onset of convection in the\n$\\gamma-R$ plane, and find that it compares very well with the experiments. In\nparticular we demonstrate that interactions of specific Fourier modes,\ncharacterized by a resonant interaction of their wavevectors in the layer\nplane, are key to understanding the pattern morphologies.\n", "  The Mars flyby of C/2013 A1 (Siding Spring) represented a unique opportunity\nfor imaging a long-period comet and resolving its nucleus and rotation period.\nBecause of the small encounter distance and the high relative velocity, the\ngoal of successfully observing C/2013 A1 from the Mars orbiting spacecrafts\nposed strict accuracy requirements on the comet's ephemerides. These\nrequirements were hard to meet, as comets are known for being highly\nunpredictable: astrometric observations can be significantly biased and\nnongravitational perturbations affect comet trajectories. Therefore, even prior\nto the encounter, we remeasured a couple of hundred astrometric images obtained\nwith ground-based and Earth-orbiting telescopes. We also observed the comet\nwith the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's High Resolution Imaging Science\nExperiment (HiRISE) camera on 2014 October 7. In particular, these HiRISE\nobservations were decisive in securing the trajectory and revealed that\nout-of-plane nongravitational perturbations were larger than previously\nassumed. Though the resulting ephemeris predictions for the Mars encounter\nallowed observations of the comet from the Mars orbiting spacecrafts,\npost-encounter observations show a discrepancy with the pre-encounter\ntrajectory. We reconcile this discrepancy by employing the Rotating Jet Model,\nwhich is a higher fidelity model for nongravitational perturbations and\nprovides an estimate of C/2013 A1's spin pole.\n", "  We prove that the bound state energies of the two-dimensional massive Dirac\noperator with dipole type potentials accumulate with exponentials rate at the\nband edge. In fact we prove a corresponding formula of De Martino et al (2014).\n", "  We continue our systematic development of noncommutative and nonassociative\ndifferential geometry internal to the representation category of a\nquasitriangular quasi-Hopf algebra. We describe derivations, differential\noperators, differential calculi and connections using universal categorical\nconstructions to capture algebraic properties such as Leibniz rules. Our main\nresult is the construction of morphisms which provide prescriptions for lifting\nconnections to tensor products and to internal homomorphisms. We describe the\ncurvatures of connections within our formalism, and also the formulation of\nEinstein-Cartan geometry as a putative framework for a nonassociative theory of\ngravity.\n", "  We investigate the mass and residue of the $\\Sigma$, $\\Lambda$ and $\\Xi$\nhyperons at finite temperature in the framework of thermal QCD sum rules. In\nour calculation, we take into account the additional operators coming up at\nfinite temperature. We find the temperature-dependent continuum threshold for\neach hyperon using the obtained sum rules for their mass and residue. The\nnumerical results demonstrate that the mass and residue of the particles under\nconsideration remain stable up to a certain temperature, after which they\ndecrease by increasing the temperature.\n", "  When vortices are displaced in Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC), the Magnus\nforce gives the system a momentum transverse in the direction to the\ndisplacement. We show that Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) in long channels\nwith vortices exhibit a quantization of the current response with respect to\nthe spatial vortex distribution. The quantization originates from the\nwell-known topological property of the phase around a vortex --- it is an\ninteger multiple of $ 2 \\pi $. In a similar way to the integer quantum Hall\neffect, the current along the channel is related to this topological phase, and\ncan be extracted from two experimentally measurable quantities: the total\nmomentum of the BEC and the spatial distribution. The quantization is in units\nof $ m/2h $, where $ m $ is the mass of the atoms and $ h $ is Planck's\nconstant. We derive an exact vortex momentum-displacement relation for BECs in\nlong channels under general circumstances. Our results presents the possibility\nthat the configuration described here can be used as a novel way of measuring\nthe mass of the atoms in the BEC using a topological invariant of the system.\nIf an accurate determination of the plateaus are experimentally possible, this\ngives the possibility of a topological quantum mass standard and precise\ndetermination of the fine structure constant.\n", "  We propose a self-consistent theoretical approach capable to describe the\npeculiarities of the anisotropic nanodomain formation induced by a charged AFM\nprobe on non-polar cuts of ferroelectrics. The proposed semi-phenomenological\napproach accounts for the difference of the threshold fields required for the\ndomain wall motion along non-polar X- and Y - cuts, and polar Z - cut of\nLiNbO3. The effect steams from the fact, that the minimal distance between the\nequilibrium atomic positions of domain wall and the profile of lattice pinning\nbarrier appeared different for different directions due to the crystallographic\nanisotropy. Using relaxation-type equation with cubic nonlinearity we\ncalculated the polarization reversal dynamics during the probe-induced\nnanodomain formation for different threshold field values. The different\nvelocity of domain growth and consequently equilibrium domain sizes on X-, Y-\nand Z-cuts of LiNbO3 originate from the anisotropy of the threshold field. Note\nthat the smaller is the threshold field the larger are the domain sizes, and\nthe fact allows explaining several times difference in nanodomain length\nexperimentally observed on X- and Y-cuts of LiNbO3. Obtained results can give\ninsight into the nanoscale anisotropic dynamics of polarization reversal in\nstrongly inhomogeneous electric field.\n", "  We present a generalization of the complete intersection in products of\nprojective space (CICY) construction of Calabi-Yau manifolds. CICY three-folds\nand four-folds have been studied extensively in the physics literature. Their\nutility stems from the fact that they can be simply described in terms of a\n`configuration matrix', a matrix of integers from which many of the details of\nthe geometries can be easily extracted. The generalization we present is to\nallow negative integers in the configuration matrices which were previously\ntaken to have positive semi-definite entries. This broadening of the complete\nintersection construction leads to a larger class of Calabi-Yau manifolds than\nthat considered in previous work, which nevertheless enjoys much of the same\ndegree of calculational control. These new Calabi-Yau manifolds are complete\nintersections in (not necessarily Fano) ambient spaces with an effective\nanticanonical class. We find examples with topology distinct from any that has\nappeared in the literature to date. The new manifolds thus obtained have many\ninteresting features. For example, they can have smaller Hodge numbers than\nordinary CICYs and lead to many examples with elliptic and K3-fibration\nstructures relevant to F-theory and string dualities.\n", "  We discuss applications of the theory of Quantum Chaos to one of the paradigm\nmodels of many-body quantum physics -- the Bose-Hubbard model, which describes,\nin particular, interacting ultracold Bose atoms in an optical lattice. After\npreliminary, pure quantum analysis of the system we introduce the classical\ncounterpart of the Bose-Hubbard model and the governing semiclassical equations\nof motion. We analyze these equations for the problem of Bloch oscillations of\ncold atoms where a number of experimental results are available. The review is\nwritten for non-experts and can be viewed as an introduction to the field.\n", "  In this paper, a lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE) model is proposed for\nbinary fluids based on a quasi-incompressible phase-field model [J. Shen et al,\nComm. Comp. Phys. 13, 1045 (2013)]. Compared with the other incompressible LBE\nmodels based on the incompressible phase-field theory, the quasi-incompressible\nmodel conserves mass locally. A series of numerical simulations are performed\nto validate the proposed model, and comparisons with an incompressible LBE\nmodel [H. Liang et al, Phys. Rev. E 89, 053320 (2014)] are also carried out. It\nis shown that the proposed model can track the interface accurately, and the\npredictions by the quasi-incompressible and incompressible models agree\nqualitatively well as the distribution of chemical potential is uniform,\notherwise differ significantly.\n", "  The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) attempts to bridge the gap\nbetween quantum mechanical and statistical mechanical descriptions of isolated\nquantum systems. Here, we define unbiased measures for how well the ETH works\nin various regimes, by mapping general interacting quantum systems on regular\nlattices onto a single particle living on a high-dimensional graph. By\nnumerically analyzing deviations from ETH behavior in the non-integrable Ising\nmodel, we propose a quantity that we call the $n$-$weight$ to democratically\ncharacterize the average deviations for all operators residing on a given\nnumber of sites, irrespective of their spatial structure. It appears to have a\nsimple scaling form, that we conjecture to hold true for all non-integrable\nsystems. A closely related quantity, that we term the $n$-$distinguishability$,\ntells us how well two states can be distinguished if only $n$-site operators\nare measured. Along the way, we discover that complicated operators on average\nare worse than simple ones at distinguishing between neighboring eigenstates,\ncontrary to the naive intuition created by the usual statements of the ETH that\nfew-body (many-body) operators acquire the same (different) expectation values\nin nearby eigenstates at finite energy density. Finally, we sketch heuristic\narguments that the ETH originates from the limited ability of simple operators\nto distinguish between quantum states of a system, especially when the states\nare subject to constraints such as roughly fixed energy with respect to a local\nHamiltonian.\n", "  Chondrule formation remains one of the most elusive early Solar System\nevents. Here, we take the novel approach of employing numerical simulations to\ninvestigate chondrule origin beyond purely cosmochemical methods. We model the\ntransport of generically-produced chondrules and dust in a 1D viscous\nprotoplanetary disk model, in order to constrain the chondrule formation\nevents. For a single formation event we are able to match analytical\npredictions of the memory chondrule and dust populations retain of each other\n(complementarity), finding that a large mass accretion rate ($\\gtrsim\n10^{-7}$~M$_\\odot$~yr$^{-1}$) allows for delays on the order of the disk's\nviscous timescale between chondrule formation and chondrite accretion. Further,\nwe find older disks to be severely diminished of chondrules, with accretion\nrates $\\lesssim 10^{-9}$~M$_\\odot$~yr$^{-1}$ for nominal parameters. We then\ncharacterize the distribution of chondrule origins in both space and time, as\nfunctions of disk parameters and chondrule formation rates, in runs with\ncontinuous chondrule formation and both static and evolving disks. Our data\nsuggest that these can account for the observed diversity between distinct\nchondrite classes, if some diversity in accretion time is allowed for.\n", "  We use neutron resonance spin echo and Larmor diffraction to study the effect\nof uniaxial pressure on the tetragonal-to-orthorhombic structural ($T_s$) and\nantiferromagnetic (AF) phase transitions in iron pnictides\nBaFe$_{2-x}$Ni$_{x}$As$_{2}$ ($x=0,0.03,0.12$), SrFe$_{1.97}$Ni$_{0.03}$As$_2$,\nand BaFe$_2$(As$_{0.7}$P$_{0.3}$)$_2$. In antiferromagnetically ordered\nBaFe$_{2-x}$Ni$_{x}$As$_{2}$ and SrFe$_{1.97}$Ni$_{0.03}$As$_2$ with $T_N$ and\n$T_s$ ($T_N\\leq T_s$), a uniaxial pressure necessary to detwin the sample also\nincreases $T_N$, smears out the structural transition, and induces an\northorhombic lattice distortion at all temperatures. By comparing temperature\nand doping dependence of the pressure induced lattice parameter changes with\nthe elastoresistance and nematic susceptibility obtained from transport and\nultrasonic measurements, we conclude that the in-plane resistivity anisotropy\nfound in the paramagnetic state of electron underdoped iron pnictides depends\nsensitively on the nature of the magnetic phase transition and a strong\ncoupling between the uniaxial pressure induced lattice distortion and\nelectronic nematic susceptibility.\n", "  Energies and lifetimes are reported for the eight Br-like ions with 43 $\\le$\nZ $\\le$ 50, namely Tc ~IX, Ru~X, Rh~XI, Pd~XII, Ag~XIII, Cd~XIV, In~XV, and\nSn~XVI. Results are listed for the lowest 375 levels, which mostly belong to\nthe 4s$^2$4p$^5$, 4s$^2$4p$^4$4$\\ell$, 4s4p$^6$, 4s$^2$4p$^4$5$\\ell$,\n4s$^2$4p$^3$4d$^2$, 4s4p$^5$4$\\ell$, and 4s4p$^5$5$\\ell$ configurations.\nExtensive configuration interaction among 39 configurations (generating 3990\nlevels) has been considered and the general-purpose relativistic atomic\nstructure package ({\\sc grasp}) has been adopted for the calculations.\nRadiative rates are listed for all E1, E2, M1, and M2 transitions involving the\nlowest 375 levels. Previous experimental and theoretical energies are available\nfor only a few levels of three, namely Ru~X, Rh~XI and Pd~XII. Differences with\nthe measured energies are up to 4\\% but the present results are an improvement\n(by up to 0.3 Ryd) in comparison to other recently reported theoretical data.\nSimilarly for radiative rates and lifetimes, prior results are limited to those\ninvolving only 31 levels of the 4s$^2$4p$^5$, 4s$^2$4p$^4$4d, and\n4s4p$^6$configurations for the last four ions. Moreover, there are generally no\ndiscrepancies with our results, although the larger calculations reported here\ndiffer by up to two orders of magnitude for a few transitions.\n", "  Based on the interaction between different spatial modes, semiconductor\nBragg-reflection waveguides provide a highly functional platform for non-linear\noptics. Therefore, the control and engineering of the properties of each\nspatial mode is essential. Despite the multimodeness of our waveguide, the\nwell-established Fabry-Perot technique for recording fringes in the optical\ntransmission spectrum can successfully be employed for a detailed linear\noptical characterization when combined with Fourier analysis. A prerequisite\nfor the modal sensitivity is a finely resolved transmission spectrum that is\nrecorded over a broad frequency band. Our results highlight how the features of\ndifferent spatial modes, such as their loss characteristics and dispersion\nproperties, can be separated from each other allowing their comparison. The\nmode-resolved measurements are important for optimizing the performance of such\nmultimode waveguides by tailoring the properties of their spatial modes.\n", "  We introduce the Mathematica package SummerTime for arbitrary-precision\ncomputation of sums appearing in the results of DRA method. So far these\nresults include the following families of the integrals: 3-loop onshell\nmassless vertices, 3-loop onshell mass operator type integrals, 4-loop QED-type\ntadpoles, 4-loop massless propagators. The package can be used for\nhigh-precision numerical computation of the expansion coefficients of the\nintegrals from the above families around arbitrary space-time dimension. In\naddition, this package can also be used for calculation of multiple zeta\nvalues, harmonic polylogarithms and other transcendental numbers expressed in\nterms of nested sums with factorized summand.\n", "  We consider the genesis and dynamics of interfacial instability in gas-liquid\nflows, using as a model the two-dimensional channel flow of a thin falling film\nsheared by counter-current gas. The methodology is linear stability theory\n(Orr-Sommerfeld analysis) together with direct numerical simulation of the\ntwo-phase flow in the case of nonlinear disturbances. We investigate the\ninfluence of three main flow parameters (density contrast between liquid and\ngas, film thickness, pressure drop applied to drive the gas stream) on the\ninterfacial dynamics. Energy budget analyses based on the Orr-Sommerfeld theory\nreveal various coexisting unstable modes (interfacial, shear, internal) in the\ncase of high density contrasts, which results in mode coalescence and mode\ncompetition, but only one dynamically relevant unstable internal mode for low\ndensity contrast. The same linear stability approach provides a quantitative\nprediction for the onset of (partial) liquid flow reversal in terms of the gas\nand liquid flow rates. A study of absolute and convective instability for low\ndensity contrast shows that the system is absolutely unstable for all but two\nnarrow regions of the investigated parameter space. Direct numerical\nsimulations of the same system (low density contrast) show that linear theory\nholds up remarkably well upon the onset of large-amplitude waves as well as the\nexistence of weakly nonlinear waves. In comparison, for high density contrasts\ncorresponding more closely to an air-water-type system, although the linear\nstability theory is successful at determining the most-dominant features in the\ninterfacial wave dynamics at early-to-intermediate times, the short waves\nselected by the linear theory undergo secondary instability and the wave train\nis no longer regular but rather exhibits chaotic dynamics and eventually, wave\noverturning.\n", "  We propose a spectral Particle-In-Cell (PIC) algorithm that is based on the\ncombination of a Hankel transform and a Fourier transform. For physical\nproblems that have close-to-cylindrical symmetry, this algorithm can be much\nfaster than full 3D PIC algorithms. In addition, unlike standard\nfinite-difference PIC codes, the proposed algorithm is free of numerical\ndispersion. This algorithm is benchmarked in several situations that are of\ninterest for laser-plasma interactions. These benchmarks show that it avoids a\nnumber of numerical artifacts, that would otherwise affect the physics in a\nstandard PIC algorithm - including the zero-order numerical Cherenkov effect.\n", "  We find that several thresholds can contribute to the enhancements of the\nnewly observed heavy pentaquark candidates $P_c^+(4380)$ and $P_c^+(4450)$ via\nthe anomalous triangle singularity (ATS) transitions in the specific kinematics\nof $\\Lambda_b\\to J/\\psi K^- p$. Apart from the observed two peaks we find that\nanother peaks around 4.5 GeV can also be produced by the ATS. We also show that\nthe $\\Sigma_c^{(*)}$ can be produced at leading order in $\\Lambda_b$ decay.\nThis process is different from the triangle diagram and its threshold\nenhancement only appears as CUSP effects if there is no pole structure or the\nATS involved. The threshold interaction associated with the presence of the ATS\nturns out to be a general phenomenon and plays a crucial role in the\nunderstanding of candidates for exotic states.\n", "  We answer a question of Ahlberg and Steif (2014) by finding the tail\nbehaviour of the crossing probability in near-critical planar percolation.\nInterestingly, this superexponentially small behaviour is different from the\ncase of dynamical percolation, where the analogous tail probability was proved\nto be at least exponential and at most superpolynomial by Hammond, Mossel and\nPete (2012). The proof is simple, given the scale covariance established by\nGarban, Pete and Schramm (2013).\n", "  We prove analytically that both fermionic and bosonic uniform d-dimensional\nlattices can be reduced to a set of independent one-dimensional modes. This\nreduction leads to the conclusion that the dynamics in uniform fermionic and\nbosonic lattices is always ballistic. By the use of the Jordan-Wigner\ntransformation we extend our analysis to spin lattices, proving the existence\nof both ballistic and non-ballistic subspaces in any dimension and for any\nsystem size. We then relate the nature of transport with the number of\nexcitations in the spin lattice, indicating that a single excitation propagates\nalways ballistically and that the non-ballistic behavior of uniform spin\nlattices is a consequence of the interaction between different excitations.\n", "  We study the physics of singular limits of $G_2$ compactifications of\nM-theory, which are necessary to obtain a compactification with non-abelian\ngauge symmetry or massless charged particles. This is more difficult than for\nCalabi-Yau compactifications, due to the absence of calibrated two-cycles that\nwould have allowed for direct control of W-boson masses as a function of\nmoduli. Instead, we study the relationship between gauge enhancement and\nsingular limits in $G_2$ moduli space where an associative or coassociative\nsubmanifold shrinks to zero size; this involves the physics of topological\ndefects and sometimes gives indirect control over particle masses, even though\nthey are not BPS. We show how a lemma of Joyce associates the class of a\nthree-cycle to any $U(1)$ gauge theory in a smooth $G_2$ compactification. If\nthere is an appropriate associative submanifold in this class then in the limit\nof nonabelian gauge symmetry it may be interpreted as a gauge theory\nworldvolume and provides the location of the singularities associated with\nnon-abelian gauge or matter fields. We identify a number of gauge enhancement\nscenarios related to calibrated submanifolds, including Coulomb branches and\nnon-isolated conifolds, and also study examples that realize them.\n", "  Two-component second and third-order Burgers type systems with nondiagonal\nconstant matrix of leading order terms are classified for higher symmetries.\nNew symmetry integrable systems with their master symmetries are obtained. Some\nthird order systems are observed to possess conservation laws. Bi-Poisson\nstructures of systems possessing conservation laws are given.\n", "  Searches for fermionic top partners at the TeV scale will bring forward a new\nfinal state kinematic regime and event topologies, where Run I search\nstrategies will inevitably fail. We propose concrete search strategies for\nsingly produced charge 2/3 fermionic top partners ($T'$) adequate for LHC Run\nII. Our analysis spans over all of the $T'$ decay modes ($i.e.$ $tZ$, $th$ and\n$Wb$) where we present detailed discussion of the search performances, signal\nefficiencies and backgrounds rates. Our LHC Run II search proposals utilize\nsignatures with large missing energy and leptons, as well as jet substructure\nobservables for tagging of boosted heavy SM states, customized $b$-tagging\ntactics and forward jet tagging. We analyze the prospects for discovery and\nexclusion of $T'$ models within the framework of partially composite quarks at\nthe LHC Run II. Our results show that the LHC Run II has good prospects for\nobserving $T'$ models which predict single production cross section of\n$\\sigma_{T'} \\sim 70 -140 \\, (30 -65)$ fb for $M_{T'} = 1\\, (1.5)$~TeV\nrespectively with 100 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity, depending on the\nbranching ratios of the $T'$. Similarly, we find that cross sections of\n$\\sigma_{T'} \\sim 27 -60\\, (13 - 24)$ fb for $M_{T'} = 1\\, (1.5)$ TeV\nrespectively can be excluded with the same amount of data. Our results are\nminimally model dependent and can be applied to most $T'$ models where\n$\\Gamma_{T'} \\ll M_{T'}$.\n", "  Pauli-spin blockade (PSB) is a transport phenomenon in double quantum dots\nthat allows for a type of spin to charge conversion often used to probe\nfundamental physics such as spin relaxation and singlet-triplet coupling. In\nthis paper we theoretically explore Pauli-spin blockade as a function of\nmagnetic field B applied parallel to the substrate. In the well-studied low\nmagnetic field regime, where PSB occurs in the forward $(1,1)\\rightarrow(0,2)$\ntunneling direction, we highlight some aspects of PSB that are not discussed in\ndetail in existing literature, including the change in size of both bias\ntriangles measured in the forward and reverse biasing directions as a function\nof B. At higher fields we predict a crossover to \\reverse PSB\" in which current\nis blockaded in the reverse direction due to the occupation of a spin singlet\nas opposed to the traditional triplet blockade that occurs at low fields. The\nonset of reverse PSB coincides with the development of a tail like feature in\nthe measured bias triangles and occurs when the Zeeman energy of the polarized\ntriplet equals the exchange energy in the (0,2) charge configuration. In Si\nquantum dots these fields are experimentally accessible; thus, this work\nsuggests a way to probe singlet to triplet relaxation mechanisms in quantum\ndots when both electrons occupy the same quantum dot.\n", "  We derive Ginzburg - Landau (GL) expansion in disordered attractive Hubbard\nmodel within the combined Nozieres - Schmitt-Rink and DMFT+Sigma approximation.\nRestricting ourselves to the case of homogeneous expansion, we analyze disorder\ndependence of GL expansion coefficients on disorder for the wide range of\nattractive potentials U, from weak BCS coupling region to the strong coupling\nlimit, where superconductivity is described by Bose - Einstein condensation\n(BEC) of preformed Cooper pairs. We show, that for the case of semi - elliptic\n\"bare\" density of states of conduction band, disorder influence on GL\ncoefficients A and B before quadratic and fourth -- order terms of the order\nparameter, as well as on the specific heat discontinuity at superconducting\ntransition, is of universal nature at any strength of attractive interaction\nand is related only to the general widening of the conduction band by disorder.\nIn general, disorder growth increases the values of coefficients A and B,\nleading either to the suppression of specific heat discontinuity (in the weak\ncoupling limit), or to its significant growth (in the strong coupling region).\nHowever, this behavior actually confirms the validity of the generalized\nAnderson theorem, as disorder dependence of superconducting critical\ntemperature T_c, is also controlled only by disorder widening of conduction\nband (density of states).\n", "  The process of liquid silicon infiltration is investigated for channels with\nradii from $0.25$ to $0.75$ [mm] drilled in compact carbon preforms. The\nadvantage of this setup is that the study of the phenomenon results to be\nsimplified. For comparison purposes, attempts are made in order to work out a\nframework for evaluating the accuracy of simulations. The approach relies on\ndimensionless numbers involving the properties of the surface reaction. It\nturns out that complex hydrodynamic behavior derived from second Newton law can\nbe made consistent with Lattice-Boltzmann simulations. The experiments give\nclear evidence that the growth of silicon carbide proceeds in two different\nstages and basic mechanisms are highlighted. Lattice-Boltzmann simulations\nprove to be an effective tool for the description of the growing phase. Namely,\nessential experimental constraints can be implemented. As a result, the\nexisting models are useful to gain more insight on the process of reactive\ninfiltration into porous media in the first stage of penetration, i.e. up to\npore closure because of surface growth. A way allowing to implement the\nresistance from chemical reaction in Darcy law is also proposed.\n", "  Digital radio detection of cosmic rays has made tremendous progress over the\npast decade. It has become increasingly clear where the potential --- but also\nthe limitations --- of the technique lie. In this article, we discuss roads\nthat could be followed in future radio detection efforts and try to evaluate\nthe associated prospects and challenges.\n", "  We study classical and quantum dynamics on the Euclidean Taub-NUT geometry\ncoupled to an abelian gauge field with self-dual curvature and show that, even\nthough Taub-NUT has neither bounded orbits nor quantum bound states, the\nmagnetic binding via the gauge field produces both. The conserved Runge-Lenz\nvector of Taub-NUT dynamics survives, in a modified form, in the gauged model\nand allows for an essentially algebraic computation of classical trajectories\nand energies of quantum bound states. We also compute scattering cross sections\nand find a surprising electric-magnetic duality. Finally, we exhibit the\ndynamical symmetry behind the conserved Runge-Lenz and angular momentum vectors\nin terms of a twistorial formulation of phase space.\n", "  Dispersive shock waves (DSWs) in the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation and\ntwo dimensional Benjamin-Ono (2DBO) equation are considered using parabolic\nfront initial data. Employing a front tracking type ansatz exactly reduces the\nstudy of DSWs in two space one time (2+1) dimensions to finding DSW solutions\nof (1+1) dimensional equations. With this ansatz, the KP and 2DBO equations can\nbe exactly reduced to cylindrical Korteweg-de Vries (cKdV) and cylindrical\nBenjamin-Ono (cBO) equations, respectively. Whitham modulation equations which\ndescribe DSW evolution in the cKdV and cBO equations are derived in general and\nRiemann type variables are introduced. DSWs obtained from the numerical\nsolutions of the corresponding Whitham systems and direct numerical simulations\nof the cKdV and cBO equations are compared with excellent agreement obtained.\nIn turn, DSWs obtained from direct numerical simulations of the KP and 2DBO\nequations are compared with the cKdV and cBO equations, again with remarkable\nagreement. It is concluded that the (2+1) DSW behavior along parabolic fronts\ncan be effectively described by the DSW solutions of the reduced (1+1)\ndimensional equations.\n", "  Quantum nonlocality can be revealed \"via local contextuality\" in qudit-qudit\nentangled systems with $d > 2$, that is, through the violation of inequalities\ncontaining Alice-Bob correlations that admit a local description, and\nAlice-Alice correlations (between the results of sequences of measurements on\nAlice's subsystem) that admit a local (but contextual) description. A\nfundamental question to understand the respective roles of entanglement and\nlocal contextuality is whether nonlocality via local contextuality exists when\nthe parties have only qubit-qubit entanglement. Here we respond affirmatively\nto this question. This result further clarifies the connection between\ncontextuality and nonlocality and opens the door for observing nonlocality via\nlocal contextuality in actual experiments.\n", "  Aggregates immersed in a plasma or radiative environment will have charge\ndistributed over their extended surface. Previous studies have modeled the\naggregate charge using the monopole and dipole terms of a multipole expansion,\nwith results indicating that the dipole-dipole interactions play an important\nrole in increasing the aggregation rate and altering the morphology of the\nresultant aggregates. This study examines the effect that including the\nquadrupole terms has on the dynamics of aggregates interacting with each other\nand the confining electric fields in laboratory experiments. Results are\ncompared to modeling aggregates as a collection of point charges located at the\ncenter of each spherical monomer comprising the aggregate.\n", "  We show that parity-time and partial parity-time symmetries are particular\ncases of antiunitary symmetry. This point is illustrated by means of a recently\ndiscussed system of non-Hermitian coupled harmonic oscillators that also\nexhibits other types of antiunitary symmetries. We also show that a combination\nof group and perturbation theory is a useful tool for predicting broken\nantiunitary symmetry.\n", "  We present a complete census of all Herschel-detected sources within the six\nmassive lensing clusters of the HST Frontier Fields (HFF). We provide a robust\nlegacy catalogue of 263 sources with Herschel fluxes, primarily based on\nimaging from the Herschel Lensing Survey (HLS) and PEP/HerMES Key Programmes.\nWe optimally combine Herschel, Spitzer and WISE infrared (IR) photometry with\ndata from HST, VLA and ground-based observatories, identifying counterparts to\ngain source redshifts. For each Herschel-detected source we also present\nmagnification factor (mu), intrinsic IR luminosity and characteristic dust\ntemperature, providing a comprehensive view of dust-obscured star formation\nwithin the HFF. We demonstrate the utility of our catalogues through an\nexploratory overview of the magnified population, including more than 20\nbackground sub-LIRGs unreachable by Herschel without the assistance\ngravitational lensing.\n", "  We consider beyond the standard model embedding of inert Higgs doublet\nfields. We argue that inert Higgs doublets can arise naturally in grand unified\ntheories where the necessary associated $Z_2$ symmetry can occur automatically.\nSeveral examples are discussed.\n", "  We study the magnetically-induced phonon splitting in cubic ACr$_2$O$_4$\n(A=Mg, Zn, Cd, Hg) spinels from first principles, and demonstrate that the sign\nof the splitting, which is experimentally observed to be opposite in\nCdCr$_2$O$_4$ compared to ZnCr$_2$O$_4$ and MgCr$_2$O$_4$, is determined solely\nby the particular magnetic ordering pattern observed in these compounds. We\nfurther show that this interaction between magnetism and phonon frequencies can\nbe fully described by the previously proposed spin-phonon coupling model that\nincludes only the nearest neighbor exchange. Finally, using this model with\nmaterials specific parameters calculated from first principles, we provide\nadditional insights into the physics of spin-phonon coupling in this intriguing\nfamily of compounds.\n", "  The centrality dependence of the mean charged-particle multiplicity as a\nfunction of pseudorapidity is measured in approximately 1 $\\mu$b$^{-1}$ of\nproton--lead collisions at a nucleon--nucleon centre-of-mass energy of\n$\\sqrt{s_{_{\\rm{NN}}}} = 5.02$ TeV using the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron\nCollider. Charged particles with absolute pseudorapidity less than 2.7 are\nreconstructed using the ATLAS pixel detector. The $p$+Pb collision centrality\nis characterised by the total transverse energy measured in the Pb-going\ndirection of the forward calorimeter. The charged-particle pseudorapidity\ndistributions are found to vary strongly with centrality, with an increasing\nasymmetry between the proton-going and Pb-going directions as the collisions\nbecome more central. Three different estimations of the number of nucleons\nparticipating in the $p$+Pb collision have been carried out using the Glauber\nmodel as well as two Glauber--Gribov inspired extensions to the Glauber model.\nCharged-particle multiplicities per participant pair are found to vary\ndifferently for these three models, highlighting the importance of including\ncolour fluctuations in nucleon--nucleon collisions in the modelling of the\ninitial state of $p$+Pb collisions.\n", "  Chromatic aberration in optical systems arises from the wavelength dependence\nof a glass's refractive index. Polychromatic rays incident upon an optical\nsurface are refracted at slightly different angles and in traversing an optical\nsystem follow distinct paths creating images displaced according to color.\nAlthough arising from dispersion, it manifests as a spatial distortion\ncorrectable only with compound lenses with multiple glasses and accumulates in\ncomplicated imaging systems. While chromatic aberration is measured with\ninterferometry, simple methods are attractive for their ease of use and low\ncost. In this letter we retrieve the longitudinal chromatic focal shift of high\nnumerical aperture (NA) microscope objectives from the extinction spectra of\nmetallic nanoparticles within the focal plane. The method is accurate for high\nNA objectives with apochromatic correction, and enables rapid assessment of the\nchromatic aberration of any complete microscopy systems, since it is\nstraightforward to implement\n", "  A silicon-compatible light source is the final missing piece for completing\nhigh-speed, low-power on-chip optical interconnects. In this paper, we present\na germanium-based light emitter that encompasses all the aspects of potential\nlow-threshold lasers: highly strained germanium gain medium, strain-induced\npseudo-heterostructure, and high-Q optical cavity. Our light emitting structure\npresents greatly enhanced photoluminescence into cavity modes with measured\nquality factors of up to 2,000. The emission wavelength is tuned over more than\n400 nm with a single lithography step. We find increased optical gain in\noptical cavities formed with germanium under high (>2.3%) tensile strain.\nThrough quantitative analysis of gain/loss mechanisms, we find that free\ncarrier absorption from the hole bands dominates the gain, resulting in no net\ngain even from highly strained, n-type doped germanium.\n", "  Following similar analysis to that in Lacoin (PTRF 159, 777-808, 2014), we\ncan show that the quenched critical point for self-avoiding walk on random\nconductors on the d-dimensional integer lattice is almost surely a constant,\nwhich does not depend on the location of the reference point. We provide its\nupper and lower bounds that are valid for all dimensions.\n", "  We discuss the existence of monodromies associated with the singular points\nof the eigenvalue problem for the Rabi model. The complete control of the full\nmonodromy data requires the taming of the Stokes phenomenon associated with the\nunique irregular singular point. The monodromy data, in particular the\ncomposite monodromy, are written in terms of the parameters of the model via\nthe isomonodromy method and the tau-function of the Painlev\\'e V. These data\nprovide a systematic way to obtain the quantized spectrum of the Rabi model.\n", "  The interaction of optical and mechanical modes in nanoscale optomechanical\nsystems has been widely studied for applications ranging from sensing to\nquantum information science. Here, we develop a platform for cavity\noptomechanical circuits in which localized and interacting 1550 nm photons and\n2.4 GHz phonons are combined with photonic and phononic waveguides. Working in\nGaAs facilitates manipulation of the localized mechanical mode either with a\nradio frequency field through the piezo-electric effect, or optically through\nthe strong photoelastic effect. We use this to demonstrate a novel acoustic\nwave interference effect, analogous to coherent population trapping in atomic\nsystems, in which the coherent mechanical motion induced by the electrical\ndrive can be completely cancelled out by the optically-driven motion. The\nability to manipulate cavity optomechanical systems with equal facility through\neither photonic or phononic channels enables new device and system\narchitectures for signal transduction between the optical, electrical, and\nmechanical domains.\n", "  A wide range of thermoreversible gels are prepared by cooling down to ambient\ntemperature hot aqueous polymer solutions. During the sol-gel transition, such\nmaterials may experience a volume contraction which is traditionally overlooked\nas rheological measurements are usually performed in geometries of constant\nvolume. In this article, we revisit the formation of 1.5\\% wt. agar gels\nthrough a series of benchmark rheological experiments performed with a\nplate-plate geometry. We demonstrate on that particular gel of polysaccharides\nthat the contraction associated with the sol/gel transition cannot be\nneglected. Indeed, imposing a constant gap width during the gelation results in\nthe strain hardening of the sample, as evidenced by the large negative normal\nforce that develops. Such hardening leads to the slow drift in time of the gel\nelastic modulus $G'$ towards ever larger values, and thus to an erroneous\nestimate of $G'$. As an alternative, we show that imposing a constant normal\nforce equals to zero during the gelation, instead of a constant gap width,\nsuppresses the hardening as the decrease of the gap compensates for the sample\ncontraction. Using normal force controlled rheology, we then investigate the\nimpact of thermal history on 1.5\\% wt. agar gels. We show that neither the\nvalue of the cooling rate, nor the introduction of a constant temperature stage\nduring the cooling process influence the gel elastic properties. Instead, $G'$\nonly depends on the terminal temperature reached at the end of the cooling\nramp, as confirmed by direct imaging of the gel microstructure by cryoelectron\nmicroscopy. The present work offers an extensive review of the technical\ndifficulties associated with the rheology of hydrogels and paves the way for a\nsystematic use of normal force controlled rheology to monitor non-isochoric\nprocesses.\n", "  The Lieb-Oxford bound, a nontrivial inequality for the indirect part of the\nmany-body Coulomb repulsion in an electronic system, plays an important role in\nthe construction of approximations in density functional theory. Using the\nwavefunction for strictly-correlated electrons of a given density, we turn the\nsearch over wavefunctions appearing in the original bound into a more\nmanageable search over electron densities. This allows us to challenge the\nbound in a systematic way. We find that a maximizing density for the bound, if\nit exists, must have compact support. We also find that, at least for particle\nnumbers $N\\le 60$, a uniform density profile is not the most challenging for\nthe bound. With our construction we improve the bound for $N=2$ electrons that\nwas originally found by Lieb and Oxford, we give a new lower bound to the\nconstant appearing in the Lieb-Oxford inequality valid for any $N$, and we\nprovide an improved upper bound for the low-density uniform electron gas\nindirect energy.\n", "  This paper is a review containing new original results on the finite order\nvariational sequence and its different representations with emphasis on\napplications in the theory of variational symmetries and conservation laws in\nphysics.\n", "  We study the five-body decays $\\mu^- \\to e^- e^+ e^- \\nu_{\\mu} \\bar{\\nu}_{e}$\nand $\\tau^- \\to \\ell^- \\ell'^+\\ell'^-\\nu_{\\tau}\\bar{\\nu}_{\\ell}$ for $\\ell,\n\\ell'=e, \\mu$ within the Standard Model (SM) and in a general effective field\ntheory description of the weak interactions at low energies. We compute the\nbranching ratios and compare our results with two previous, mutually\ndiscrepant, SM calculations. By assuming a general structure for the weak\ncurrents we derive the expressions for the energy and angular distributions of\nthe three charged leptons when the decaying lepton is polarized, which will be\nuseful in precise tests of the weak charged current at Belle II. In these\ndecays, leptonic $\\mathbf{T}$-odd correlations in triple products of spin and\nmomenta --which may signal time reversal violation in the leptonic sector-- are\nsuppressed by the tiny neutrino masses. Therefore, a measurement of such\n$\\mathbf{T}$-violating observables would be associated to neutrinoless lepton\nflavor violating (LFV) decays, where this effect is not extremely suppressed.\nWe also study the backgrounds that the SM five-lepton lepton decays constitute\nto searches of LFV $L^- \\to \\ell^- \\ell'^+\\ell'^-$ decays. Searches at high\nvalues of the invariant mass of the $\\ell'^+\\ell'^-$ pair look the most\nconvenient way to overcome the background.\n", "  We investigate the infinite volume limit of quantized photon fields in\nmultimode coherent states. We show that for states containing a continuum of\ncoherent modes, it is mathematically and physically natural to consider their\nphases to be random and identically distributed. The infinite volume states\ngive rise to Hilbert space representations of the canonical commutation\nrelations which we construct concretely. In the case of random phases, the\nrepresentations are random as well and can be expressed with the help of It\\^o\nstochastic integrals.\n  We analyze the dynamics of the infinite state alone and the open system\ndynamics of small systems coupled to it. We show that under the free field\ndynamics, initial phase distributions are driven to the uniform distribution.\nWe demonstrate that coherences in small quantum systems, interacting with the\ninfinite coherent state, exhibit Gaussian time decay. The decoherence is\nqualitatively faster than the one caused by infinite thermal states, which is\nknown to be exponentially rapid only. This emphasizes the classical character\nof coherent states.\n", "  We investigate energy dissipation and the distribution of particle velocities\nat the jamming transition for overdamped shear-driven frictionless disks in two\ndimensions at zero temperature. We find that the dissipation is caused by the\nfastest particles and that the fraction of particles responsible for the\ndissipation decreases towards zero as jamming is approached. These particles\nbelong to an algebraic tail of the velocity distribution that approaches $\\sim\nv^{-3}$ as jamming is approached. We further find that different measures of\nthe velocity diverge differently, which means that concepts like \"typical\nvelocity\" may no longer be used---a finding that should have implications for\nanalytical approaches to shear-driven jamming.\n", "  We propose a scheme for performing quantum key distribution (QKD) which has\nthe potential to beat schemes based on the direct transmission of photons\nbetween the communicating parties. In our proposal, the communicating parties\nexchange photons with two quantum memories placed between them. This is a very\nsimple quantum repeater scheme and can be implemented with currently available\ntechnology. Ideally, its secret key rate scales as the square root of the\ntransmittivity of the optical channel, which is superior to QKD schemes based\non direct transmission because key rates for the latter scale at best linearly\nwith transmittivity. Taking into account various imperfections in each\ncomponent of our setup, we present parameter regimes in which our protocol\noutperforms protocols based on direct transmission.\n", "  The existence of multidimensional lattice compactons in the discrete\nnonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation in the presence of fast periodic time\nmodulations of the nonlinearity is demonstrated. By averaging over the period\nof the fast modulations, a new effective averaged dynamical equation arises\nwith coupling constants involving Bessel functions of the first and zeroth\nkind. These terms allow one to solve, at this averaged level, for exact\ndiscrete compacton solution configurations in the corresponding stationary\nequation. We focus on seven types of compacton solutions: single site and\nvortex solutions are found to be always stable in the parametric regimes we\nexamined. Other solutions such as double site in- and out-of-phase, four site\nsymmetric and anti-symmetric, and a five site compacton solution are found to\nhave regions of stability and instability in two-dimensional parametric planes,\ninvolving variations of the strength of the coupling and of the nonlinearity.\nWe also explore the time evolution of the solutions and compare the dynamics\naccording to the averaged with those of the original dynamical equations\nwithout the averaging. Possible observation of compactons in the BEC loaded in\na deep two-dimensional optical lattice with interactions modulated periodically\nin time is discussed.\n", "  The COBRA collaboration operates a demonstrator setup at the underground\nfacility LNGS (Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, located in Italy) to prove\nthe technological capabilities of this concept for the search for neutrinoless\ndouble beta-decay. The setup consists of 64 $(1\\times\\!1\\times\\!1)$ cm$^{3}$\nCZT detectors in CPG configuration. One purpose of this demonstrator is to test\nif reliable long-term operation of CZT-CPG detectors in such a setup is\npossible. The demonstrator has been operated under ultra low-background\nconditions since more than three years and collected data corresponding to an\nexposure of 218 kg$\\cdot$days. The presented study focuses on the long-term\nstability of CZT detectors by analyzing the intrinsic, fourfold forbidden\nnon-unique $^{113}$Cd single beta-decay. It can be shown that CZT detectors can\nbe operated stably for long periods of time and that the $^{113}$Cd single\nbeta-decay can be used as an internal monitor of the detector performance\nduring the runtime of the experiment.\n", "  Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD), which is\nimmune to all detector side-channel attacks, is the most promising solution to\nthe security issues in practical quantum key distribution systems. Though\nseveral experimental demonstrations of MDI QKD have been reported, they all\nmake one crucial but not yet verified assumption, that is there are no flaws in\nstate preparation. Such an assumption is unrealistic and security loopholes\nremain in the source. Here we present, to our knowledge, the first MDI-QKD\nexperiment with state preparation flaws taken into consideration. By applying a\nnovel security proof by Tamaki \\textit{et al} (Phys. Rev. A 90, 052314 (2014)),\nwe distribute secure keys over fiber links up to 40 km with imperfect sources,\nwhich would not have been possible under previous security proofs. By closing\nloopholes in both the sources and the detectors, our work shows the feasibility\nof secure QKD with practical imperfect devices.\n", "  We initially consider two simple situations where inflationary slow roll\nparameters are large and modes no longer freeze out shortly after exiting the\nhorizon, treating both cases analytically. We then consider applications to\ntransient phases where the slow roll parameters can become large, especially in\nthe context of the common `fast-roll' inflation frequently used as a mechanism\nto explain the anomalously low scalar power at low $l$ in the CMB. These\ntransient cases we treat numerically. We find when $\\epsilon$, the first slow\nroll parameter, and only $\\epsilon$ is large, modes decay outside the horizon,\nand when $\\delta$, the second slow roll parameter, is large, modes grow outside\nthe horizon. When multiple slow roll parameters are large the behavior in\ngeneral is more complicated, but we nevertheless show in the 'fast-roll'\ninflation case, modes grow outside the horizon.\n", "  While bare diagrammatic series are merely Taylor expansions in powers of\ninteraction strength, dressed diagrammatic series, built on fully or partially\ndressed lines and vertices, are usually constructed by reordering the bare\ndiagrams, which is an a priori unjustified manipulation, and can even lead to\nconvergence to an unphysical result [Kozik, Ferrero and Georges, PRL 114,\n156402 (2015)]. Here we show that for a broad class of partially dressed\ndiagrammatic schemes, there exists an action $S^{(\\xi)}$ depending analytically\non an auxiliary complex parameter $\\xi$, such that the Taylor expansion in\n$\\xi$ of correlation functions reproduces the original diagrammatic series. The\nresulting applicability conditions are similar to the bare case. For fully\ndressed skeleton diagrammatics, analyticity of $S^{(\\xi)}$ is not granted, and\nwe formulate a sufficient condition for converging to the correct result.\n", "  The polar phase of superfluid $^3$He is stable in \"nematically ordered\"\ndensed aerogel. A rotating vessel with the polar superfluid can be filled\neither by an array of the single quantum vortices or by an array of the\nhalf-quantum vortices.\n  It is shown that the inhomogeneous distribution of the spin part of the order\nparameter arising in an array of half-quantum vortices in strong enough\nmagnetic field tilted to the average direction of aerogel strands leads to the\nappearance of a satellite in the NMR signal shifted in the negative direction\nwith respect to the Larmor frequency. The satellite is absent in the case of an\narray of single quantum vortices what allows to distinguish these two\nconfigurations. The polar state in the anisotropic aerogel with lower density\ntransforms at lower temperatures to the axipolar state. The array of\nhalf-quantum vortices created in the polar phase keeps its structure under\ntransition to the axipolar state. The temperature dependence of the\nvortex-satellite NMR frequency is found to be slower below the transition\ntemperature to the axipolar state.\n", "  The two particle interferometry method to determine the size of the emitting\nsource after a heavy ion collision is extended. Following the extension of the\nmethod to spherical expansion dynamics, here we extend the method to rotating\nsystems. It is shown that rotation of a cylindrically symmetric system leads to\nmodifications, which can be perceived as spatial asymmetry by the \"azimuthal\nHBT\" method.\n  We study an exact rotating and expanding solution of the fluid dynamical\nmodel of heavy ion reactions. We consider a source that is azimuthally\nsymmetric in space around the axis of rotation, and discuss the features of the\nresulting two particle correlation function. This shows the azimuthal asymmetry\narising from the rotation. We show that this asymmetry leads to results similar\nto those given by spatially asymmetric sources.\n", "  We consider reflection and transmission of interfaces which implement\nrenormalisation group flows between conformal fixed points in two dimensions.\nSuch an RG interface is constructed from the identity defect in the ultraviolet\nCFT by perturbing the theory on one side of the defect line. We compute\nreflection and transmission coefficients in perturbation theory to third order\nin the coupling constant and check our calculations against exact constructions\nof RG interfaces between coset models.\n", "  If new phenomena beyond the Standard Model will be discovered at the LHC, the\nproperties of the new particles could be determined with data from the\nHigh-Luminosity LHC and from a future linear collider like the ILC. We discuss\nthe possible interplay between measurements at the two accelerators in a\nconcrete example, namely a full SUSY model which features a small stau_1-LSP\nmass difference. Various channels have been studied using the Snowmass 2013\ncombined LHC detector implementation in the Delphes simulation package, as well\nas simulations of the ILD detector concept from the Technical Design Report. We\ninvestigate both the LHC and ILC capabilities for discovery, separation and\nidentification of various parts of the spectrum. While some parts would be\ndiscovered at the LHC, there is substantial room for further discoveries at the\nILC. We finally highlight examples where the precise knowledge about the lower\npart of the mass spectrum which could be acquired at the ILC would enable a\nmore in-depth analysis of the LHC data with respect to the heavier states.\n", "  Strongly disordered and strongly interacting quantum critical points are\ndifficult to access with conventional field theoretic methods. They are,\nhowever, both experimentally important and theoretically interesting. In\nparticular, they are expected to realize universal incoherent transport. Such\ndisordered quantum critical theories have recently been constructed\nholographically by deforming a CFT by marginally relevant disorder. In this\npaper we find additional disordered fixed points via relevant disordered\ndeformations of a holographic CFT. Using recently developed methods in\nholographic transport, we characterize the thermal conductivity in both sets of\ntheories in 1+1 dimensions. The thermal conductivity is found to tend to a\nconstant at low temperatures in one class of fixed points, and to scale as\n$T^{0.3}$ in the other. Furthermore, in all cases the thermal conductivity\nexhibits discrete scale invariance, with logarithmic in temperature\noscillations superimposed on the low temperature scaling behavior. At no point\ndo we use the replica trick.\n", "  We investigate the analytic continuation of wave equations into the complex\nposition plane. For the particular case of electromagnetic waves we provide a\nphysical meaning for such an analytic continuation in terms of a family of\nclosely related inhomogeneous media. For bounded permittivity profiles we find\nthe phenomenon of reflection can be related to branch cuts in the wave that\noriginate from poles of the permittivity at complex positions. Demanding that\nthese branch cuts disappear, we derive a large family of inhomogeneous media\nthat are reflectionless for a single angle of incidence. Extending this\nproperty to all angles of incidence leads us to a generalized form of the\nPoschl Teller potentials. We conclude by analyzing our findings within the\nphase integral (WKB) method.\n", "  The future of quantum repeater networking will require interoperability\nbetween various error correcting codes. A few specific code conversions and\neven a generalized method are known, however, no detailed analysis of these\ntechniques in the context of quantum networking has been performed. In this\npaper, we analyze a generalized procedure to create Bell pairs encoded\nheterogeneously between two separate codes used often in error corrected\nquantum repeater network designs. We begin with a physical Bell pair, then\nencode each qubit in a different error correcting code, using entanglement\npurification to increase the fidelity. We investigate three separate protocols\nfor preparing the purified encoded Bell pair. We calculate the error\nprobability of those schemes between the Steane [[7,1,3]] code, a distance\nthree surface code and single physical qubits by Monte Carlo simulation under a\nstandard Pauli error model, and estimate the resource efficiency of the\nprocedures. A local gate error rate of $10^{-3}$ allows us to create\nhigh-fidelity logical Bell pairs between any of our chosen codes. We find that\na postselected model, where any detected parity flips in code stabilizers\nresult in a restart of the protocol, performs the best.\n", "  For systems in nonequilibrium steady states, a novel modulated Gaussian\nprobability distribution is derived to incorporate a new phenomenon of biased\ncurrent fluctuations, discovered by recent laboratory experiments and confirmed\nby molecular dynamics simulations. Our results consistently extend\nOnsager-Machlup fluctuation theory for systems in thermal equilibrium.\nConnections with the principles of Statistical Mechanics due to Boltzmann and\nGibbs are discussed. At last, the modulated Gaussian distribution is of\npotential interest for other statistical disciplines, which make use of the\nLarge Deviation theory.\n", "  Estimation of channel parameters is important for extending the range and\nincreasing the key rate of continuous variable quantum key distribution\nprotocols. We propose a new estimator for the channel noise parameter based on\nthe method of moments. The method of moments finds an estimator from the\nmoments of the output distribution of the protocol. This estimator has the\nadvantage of being able to use all of the states shared between Alice and Bob.\nOther estimators are limited to a smaller publicly revealed subset of the\nstates. The proposed estimator has a lower variance for high loss channel than\nwhat has previously been proposed. We show that the method of moments estimator\nincreases the key rate by up to an order of magnitude at the maximum\ntransmission of the protocol.\n", "  We derive various important thermodynamic relations of the inner and outer\nhorizon in the background of Taub-NUT(Newman-Unti-Tamburino) black hole in four\ndimensional \\emph{Lorentzian geometry}. We compare these properties with the\nproperties of Reissner Nordstr{\\o}m black hole. We compute \\emph{area product,\narea sum, area minus and area division} of black hole horizons. We show that\nthey all are not universal quantities. Based on these relations, we compute the\narea bound of all horizons. From area bound, we derive entropy bound and\nirreducible mass bound for both the horizons. We further study the stability of\nsuch black hole by computing the specific heat for both the horizons. It is\nshown that due to negative specific heat the black hole is thermodynamically\nunstable. All these calculations might be helpful to understanding the nature\nof black hole entropy both \\emph{interior} and exterior at the microscopic\nlevel.\n", "  We investigate a class of models of topological inflation in which a\nsuper-Hubble-sized global monopole seeds inflation. These models are attractive\nsince inflation starts from rather generic initial conditions, but their not so\nattractive feature is that, unless symmetry is again restored, inflation never\nends. In this work we show that, in presence of another nonminimally coupled\nscalar field, that is both quadratically and quartically coupled to the Ricci\nscalar, inflation naturally ends, representing an elegant solution to the\ngraceful exit problem of topological inflation. While the monopole core grows\nduring inflation, the growth stops after inflation, such that the monopole\neventually enters the Hubble radius, and shrinks to its Minkowski space size,\nrendering it immaterial for the subsequent Universe's dynamics. Furthermore, we\nfind that our model can produce cosmological perturbations that source CMB\ntemperature fluctuations and seed large scale structure statistically\nconsistent (within one standard deviation) with all available data. In\nparticular, for small and (in our convention) negative nonminimal couplings,\nthe scalar spectral index can be as large as $n_s\\simeq 0.955$, which is about\none standard deviation lower than the central value quoted by the most recent\nPlanck Collaboration.\n", "  The ground and low-lying collective states of a rotating system of $N=3$\nbosons harmonically confined in quasi-two-dimension and interacting via\nrepulsive finite-range Gaussian potential is studied in weakly to moderately\ninteracting regime. The $N$-body Hamiltonian matrix is diagonalized in\nsubspaces of quantized total angular momenta $0\\le L \\le 4N$ to obtain the\nground and low-lying eigenstates. Our numerical results show that breathing\nmodes with $N$-body eigenenergy spacing of $2\\hbar\\omega_{\\perp}$, known to\nexist in strictly 2D system with zero-range ($\\delta$-function) interaction\npotential, may as well exist in quasi-2D system with finite-range Gaussian\ninteraction potential. To gain an insight into the many-body states, the von\nNeumann entropy is calculated as a measure of quantum correlation and the\nconditional probability distribution is analyzed for the internal structure of\nthe eigenstates. In the rapidly rotating regime the ground state in angular\nmomentum subspaces $L=\\frac{q}{2}N\\left(N-1\\right)$ with $q=2, 4$ is found to\nexhibit the anticorrelation structure suggesting that it may variationally be\ndescribed by a Bose-Laughlin like state. We further observe that the first\nbreathing mode exhibits features similar to the Bose-Laughlin state in having\neigenenergy, von Neumann entropy and internal structure independent of\ninteraction for the three-boson system considered here. On the contrary, for\neigenstates lying between the Bose-Laughlin like ground state and the first\nbreathing mode, values of eigenenergy, von Neumann entropy and internal\nstructure are found to vary with interaction.\n", "  Understanding the decoherence of electron spins in semiconductors due to\ntheir interaction with nuclear spins is of fundamental interest as they realize\nthe central spin model and of practical importance for using electron spins as\nqubits. Interesting effects arise from the quadrupolar interaction of nuclear\nspins with electric field gradients, which have been shown to suppress\ndiffusive nuclear spin dynamics. One might thus expect them to enhance electron\nspin coherence. Here we show experimentally that for gate-defined GaAs quantum\ndots, quadrupolar broadening of the nuclear Larmor precession can also reduce\nelectron spin coherence due to faster decorrelation of transverse nuclear\nfields. However, this effect can be eliminated for appropriate field\ndirections. Furthermore, we observe an additional modulation of spin coherence\nthat can be attributed to an anisotropic electronic $g$-tensor. These results\ncomplete our understanding of dephasing in gated quantum dots and point to\nmitigation strategies. They may also help to unravel unexplained behaviour in\nrelated systems such as self-assembled quantum dots and III-V nanowires.\n", "  We introduce a special class of random matrices (DUE) whose spectral\nstatistics corresponds to statistics of microscopical quantities detected in\nvehicular flows. Comparing the level spacing distribution (for ordered\neigenvalues in unfolded spectra of DUE matrices) with the time-clearance\ndistribution extracted from various areas of the flux-density diagram\n(evaluated from original traffic data measured on Czech expressways with high\noccupancies) we demonstrate that the set of classical systems showing an\nuniversality associated with Random Matrix Ensembles can be extended by traffic\nsystems.\n", "  This article provides an attempt to extend concepts from the theory of\nRiemannian manifolds to piecewise linear spaces. In particular we propose an\nanalogue of the Ricci tensor, which we give the name of an Einstein vector\nfield. On a given set of piecewise linear spaces we define and discuss\n(normalized) Ricci flows. Piecewise linear Einstein metrics are defined and\nexamples are provided. Criteria for flows to approach Einstein metrics are\nformulated. Second variations of the total scalar curvature at a specific\nEinstein space are calculated.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the agegraphic dark energy (ADE) model by\nincluding the sign-changeable interaction between ADE and dark matter in\nnon-flat universe. It is shown that the interaction induces an energy flow of\nwhich the direction is first from dark matter to ADE and then from ADE to dark\nmatter. The phase space analysis is made and the critical points are found, one\nof which is the accelerated scaling attractor solution. So, the coincidence\nproblem can be alleviated. Furthermore, we show the evolution of the density\nparameter $\\Omega$, the deceleration parameter $q$ and the equation of state\n(EoS) parameter $w_{d}$ of ADE. We also find that our model is consistent with\nthe observational data.\n", "  Within the background-field framework we present a path integral derivation\nof the splitting Ward identity for the one-particle irreducible effective\naction in the presence of an infrared regulator, and make connection with\nearlier works on the subject. The approach is general in the sense that it does\nnot rely on how the splitting is performed. This identity is then used to\naddress the problem of background dependence of the effective action at an\narbitrary energy scale. We next introduce the modified master equation and\nemphasize its role in constraining the effective action. Finally, application\nto general gauge theories within the geometric approach is discussed.\n", "  We tabulate the atomic mass excesses and binding energies, ground-state\nshell-plus-pairing corrections, ground-state microscopic corrections, and\nnuclear ground-state deformations of 9318 nuclei ranging from $^{16}$O to\n$A=339$. The calculations are based on the finite-range droplet macroscopic\nmodel and the folded-Yukawa single-particle microscopic model. Relative to our\nFRDM(1992) mass table in {\\sc Atomic Data and Nuclear Data Tables} [{\\bf 59}\n185 (1995)], the results are obtained in the same model, but with considerably\nimproved treatment of deformation and fewer of the approximations that were\nnecessary earlier, due to limitations in computer power. The more accurate\nexecution of the model and the more extensive and more accurate experimental\nmass data base now available allows us to determine one additional\nmacroscopic-model parameter, the density-symmetry coefficient $L$, which was\nnot varied in the previous calculation, but set to zero. Because we now realize\nthat the FRDM is inaccurate for some highly deformed shapes occurring in\nfission, because some effects are derived in terms of perturbations around a\nsphere, we only adjust its macroscopic parameters to ground-state masses. The\nvalues of ten constants are determined directly from an optimization to fit\nground-state masses of 2149 nuclei ranging from $^{16}$O to $^{265}_{106}$Sg\nand $^{264}_{108}$Hs. The error of the mass model is 0.5595~MeV. We also\nprovide masses in the FRLDM, which in the more accurate treatments now has an\nerror of 0.6618 MeV. But in contrast to the FRDM, it is suitable for studies of\nfission and has been extensively so applied elsewhere, with FRLDM(2002)\nconstants. The FRLDM(2012) fits 31 fission barrier heights from $^{70}$Se to\n$^{252}$Cf with a root-mean-square deviation of 1.052 MeV.\n", "  Zitterbewegung, as it was originally described by Schr\\\"odinger, is an\nunphysical, non-observable effect. We verify whether the effect can be observed\nin non-inertial reference frames/curved spacetimes, where the ambiguity in\ndefining particle states results in a mixing of positive and negative frequency\nmodes. We explicitly demonstrate that such a mixing is in fact necessary to\nobtain the correct classical value for a particle's velocity in a uniformly\naccelerated reference frame, whereas in cosmological spacetime a particle does\nindeed exhibit Zitterbewegung.\n", "  In this note, I recollect a two-week period in September 1968 when I\nfactorized the Veneziano model using string variables in Chicago. Professor\nYoichiro Nambu went on to calculate the N-particle dual resonance model and\nthen to factorize it on an exponential degeneracy of states. That was in 1968\nand the following year 1969 he discovered the string action. I also include\nsome other reminiscences of Nambu who passed away on July 5, 2105.\n", "  We have analyzed effects of the hyperfine interaction on electric dipole spin\nresonance when the amplitude of the quantum-dot motion becomes comparable or\nlarger than the quantum dot's size. Away from the well known small-drive\nregime, the important role played by transverse nuclear fluctuations leads to a\ngaussian decay with characteristic dependence on drive strength and detuning. A\ncharacterization of spin-flip gate fidelity, in the presence of such additional\ndrive-dependent dephasing, shows that vanishingly small errors can still be\nachieved at sufficiently large amplitudes. Based on our theory, we analyze\nrecent electric-dipole spin resonance experiments relying on spin-orbit\ninteractions or the slanting field of a micromagnet. We find that such\nexperiments are already in a regime with significant effects of transverse\nnuclear fluctuations and the form of decay of the Rabi oscillations can be\nreproduced well by our theory.\n", "  Many new physics models predict sizable modifications to the SM Zbb\ncouplings, while the corresponding measurements at LEP and SLC exhibit some\ndiscrepancy with the SM predictions. After updating the current results on the\nZbb coupling constraints from global fits, we list the observables that are\nmost important for improving the Zbb coupling constraints and estimate the\nexpected precision reach of three proposed future e+e- colliders, CEPC, ILC and\nFCC-ee. We consider both the case that the results are SM-like and the one that\nthe Zbb couplings deviate significantly from the SM predictions. We show that,\nif we assume the value of the Zbb couplings to be within 68% CL of the current\nmeasurements, any one of the three colliders will be able to rule out the SM\nwith more than 99.9999% CL (5 sigma). We study the implications of the improved\nZbb coupling constraints on new physics models, and point out their\ncomplementarity with the constraints from the direct search of new physics\nparticles at the LHC, as well as with Higgs precision measurements. Our results\nprovide a further motivation for the construction of future e+e- colliders.\n", "  We present a new model of composite Higgs based on a gauged SU(N) group with\n4 Dirac fermions in the fundamental representation. At low energy, the model\nhas a global symmetry SU(4)$\\times$SU(4) broken to the diagonal SU(4),\ncontaining 2 Higgs doublets in the coset. We study in detail the generation of\nthe top mass via 4-fermion interactions, and the issue of the vacuum alignment.\nIn particular, we prove that, without loss of generality, the vacuum can always\nbe aligned with one doublet. Under certain conditions on the top pre-Yukawas,\nthe second doublet, together with the additional triplets, is stable and can\nthus play the role of Dark Matter. This model can therefore be an example of\ncomposite inert-2HDM model.\n", "  The discovery of the charge-density-wave formation in the high-$T_c$ cuprate\nsuperconductors has activated intensive theoretical studies for the pseudogap\nstates. However, the microscopic origin of the charge-density-wave state has\nbeen unknown so far since the many-body effects beyond the mean-field-level\napproximations, called the vertex corrections, are essential. Toward solving\nthis problem, we employ the recently developed functional renormalization-group\nmethod, by which we can calculate the higher-order vertex corrections in a\nsystematic and unbiased way with high numerical accuracy. We discover the\ncritical development of the $p$-orbital-density-wave ($p$-ODW) instability in\nthe strong-spin-fluctuation region. The obtained $p$-ODW state possesses the\nkey characteristics of the charge ordering pattern in Bi- and Y-based\nsuperconductors, such as the wave vector parallel to the nearest Cu-Cu\ndirection, and the $d$-symmetry form factor with the antiphase correlation\nbetween $p_x$ and $p_y$ orbitals in the same unit cell. In addition, from the\nobservation of the beautiful scaling relation between the spin susceptibility\nand the $p$-ODW susceptibility, we conclude that the main driving force of the\ndensity wave is the Aslamazov-Larkin vertex correction that becomes very\nsingular near the magnetic quantum-critical point.\n", "  Nickel orthoborate $Ni_{3}(BO_{3})_{2}$ having a complex orthorhombic\nstructure $P_{nnm}$ (#58, Z=2) of the kotoite type is known for quite a long\ntime as an antiferromagnetic material below $T_{N}$ = 46 K, but up to now its\nphysical properties including the lattice dynamics have not been explored. Six\nmagnetic nickel $Ni^{2+}$ ions (S=1) in the unit cell are distributed over the\n2a and 4f positions in the centers of distorted $[O_{6}]$ octahedra. The\n$[NiO_{6}]$ units are linked via rigid $[BO_{3}]$ groups and these structural\nparticularities impose restrictions on the lattice dynamics and spin-phonon\ninteractions. We performed the symmetry analysis of the phonon modes at the\ncenter of the Brillouin zone. The structural parameters and phonon modes were\ncalculated using Dmol3 program. We report and analyze results of infrared and\nRaman studies of phonon spectra measured in all required polarizations. Most of\nthe even and odd phonons predicted on the basis of the symmetry analysis and\ntheoretical calculations were reliably identified in the measured spectra.\nAbsorption measurements in the infrared region showed emergence of several very\nnarrow and weak phonons at the magnetic ordering temperature $T_{N}$. This\nobservation proves the existence of a structural phase transition not reported\nbefore which is evidently coupled intrinsically with the magnetic dynamics of\n$Ni_{3}(BO_{3})_{2}$. A clear evidence of spin-phonon interaction was observed\nfor some particular phonons below $T_{N}$.\n", "  We address the task of switching off the Hamiltonian of a system by removing\nall internal and system-environment couplings. We propose dynamical decoupling\nschemes, that use only bounded-strength controls, for quantum many-body systems\nwith local system Hamiltonians and local environmental couplings. To do so, we\nintroduce the combinatorial concept of balanced-cycle orthogonal arrays (BOAs)\nand show how to construct them from classical error-correcting codes. The\nderived decoupling schemes may be useful as a primitive for more complex\nschemes, e.g., for Hamiltonian simulation. For the case of $n$ qubits and a\n$2$-local Hamiltonian, the length of the resulting decoupling scheme scales as\n$O(n \\log n)$, improving over the previously best-known schemes that scaled\nquadratically with $n$. More generally, using balanced-cycle orthogonal arrays\nconstructed from families of BCH codes, we show that bounded-strength\ndecoupling for any $\\ell$-local Hamiltonian, where $\\ell \\geq 2$, can be\nachieved using decoupling schemes of length at most $O(n^{\\ell-1} \\log n)$.\n", "  We present in this paper the SOSpin library, which calculates an analytic\ndecomposition of the Yukawa interactions invariant under any SO(2N) group in\nterms of an SU(N) basis. We make use of the oscillator expansion formalism,\nwhere the SO(2N) spinor representations are expressed in terms of creation and\nannihilation operators of a Grassmann algebra. These noncommutative operators\nand their products are simulated in SOSpin through the implementation of\ndoubly-linked-list data structures. These data structures were determinant to\nachieve a higher performance in the simplification of large products of\ncreation and annihilation operators. We illustrate the use of our library with\ncomplete examples of how to decompose Yukawa terms invariant under SO(2N) in\nterms of SU(N) degrees of freedom for N=2 and 5. We further demonstrate, with\nan example for SO(4), that higher dimensional field-operator terms can also be\nprocessed with our library. Finally, we describe the functions available in\nSOSpin that are made to simplify the writing of spinors and their interactions\nspecifically for SO(10) models.\n", "  The scheme recently proposed in [M. Scala et al., Phys Rev Lett 111, 180403\n(2013)], where a gravity-dependent phase shift is induced on the spin of a\nnitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in a trapped nanodiamond by the interaction\nbetween its magnetic moment and the quantized motion of the particle, provides\na way to detect spatial quantum superpositions by means of spin measurements\nonly. Here, the effect of unwanted coupling with other motional degrees of\nfreedom is considered and we show that it does not affect the validity of the\nscheme. Both this coupling and the additional error source due to misalignment\nbetween the quantization axis of the NV center spin and the trapping axis are\nshown not to change the qualitative behavior of the system, so that a proof-of-\nprinciple experiment can be neatly performed. Our analysis, which shows that\nthe scheme retains the important features of not requiring ground state cooling\nand of being resistant to thermal fluctuations, can be useful for the several\nschemes which have been proposed recently for testing macroscopic\nsuperpositions in trapped microsystems.\n", "  We present the new nCTEQ15 set of nuclear parton distribution functions with\nuncertainties. This fit extends the CTEQ proton PDFs to include the nuclear\ndependence using data on nuclei all the way up to 208^Pb. The uncertainties are\ndetermined using the Hessian method with an optimal rescaling of the\neigenvectors to accurately represent the uncertainties for the chosen tolerance\ncriteria. In addition to the Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) and Drell-Yan (DY)\nprocesses, we also include inclusive pion production data from RHIC to help\nconstrain the nuclear gluon PDF. Furthermore, we investigate the correlation of\nthe data sets with specific nPDF flavor components, and asses the impact of\nindividual experiments. We also provide comparisons of the nCTEQ15 set with\nrecent fits from other groups.\n", "  We present results on the pseudoscalar meson masses from a fully dynamical\nsimulation of QCD+QED. We concentrate particularly on violations of isospin\nsymmetry. We calculate the $\\pi^+$-$\\pi^0$ splitting and also look at other\nisospin violating mass differences. We have presented results for these isospin\nsplittings in arXiv:1508.06401 [hep-lat]. In this paper we give more details of\nthe techniques employed, discussing in particular the question of how much of\nthe symmetry violation is due to QCD, arising from the different masses of the\n$u$ and $d$ quarks, and how much is due to QED, arising from the different\ncharges of the quarks. This decomposition is not unique, it depends on the\nrenormalisation scheme and scale. We suggest a renormalisation scheme in which\nDashen's theorem for neutral mesons holds, so that the electromagnetic\nself-energies of the neutral mesons are zero, and discuss how the self-energies\nchange when we transform to a scheme such as $\\bar{MS}$, in which Dashen's\ntheorem for neutral mesons is violated.\n", "  We study the necessary conditions for preserving N=(4,4) supersymmetry on\ncurved 2d backgrounds, following the strategy of Dumitrescu, Festuccia, and\nSeiberg. We derive the transformation laws and invariant action for off-shell\nAbelian vector multiplets. An explicit solution of the supersymmetry conditions\nis found on the round two-sphere.\n", "  Various distributions over the angles of the emitted photon, especially over\nthe azimuthal angle, in the one-meson radiative decay of the polarized $\\tau$\nlepton, $\\tau^-\\to\\pi^-\\gamma\\nu_{\\tau}$, have been investigated. In connection\nwith this, the photon phase space is discussed in more detail since in the case\nof the polarized $\\tau$ lepton it is not trivial. The decay matrix element\ncontains both the inner bremsstrahlung and the resonance (structural)\ncontributions. The azimuthal dependence of some observables have been\ncalculated. They are the asymmetry of the differential decay width caused by\nthe $\\tau$ lepton polarization, the Stokes parameters of the emitted photon\nitself and the correlation parameters describing the influence of $\\tau$-lepton\npolarization on the photon Stokes parameters. The numerical estimation was done\nin the $\\tau$ lepton rest frame for arbitrary direction of the $\\tau$ lepton\npolarization 3-vector. The vector and axial-vector form factors describing the\nstructure-dependent part of the decay amplitude are determined using the chiral\neffective theory with resonances (R$\\chi$T). It was found that the features of\nthe azimuthal distributions allows to separate various terms in the\nspin-dependent contribution. The so-called up-down and right-left asymmetries\nare also calculated.\n", "  We present a multimode Hamiltonian formulation for the problem of\nopto-acoustic interactions in optical waveguides. We establish a Hamiltonian\nrepresentation of the acoustic field and then introduce a full system with a\nsimple opto-acoustic coupling that includes both photoelastic/electrostrictive\nand radiation pressure/moving boundary effects. The Heisenberg equations of\nmotion are used to obtain coupled mode equations for quantized envelope\noperators for the optical and acoustic fields. We show that the coupling\ncoefficients obtained coincide with those established earlier, but our\nformalism provides a much simpler demonstration of the connection between\nradiation pressure and moving boundary effects than in previous work [C. Wolff\net al, Physical Review A 92, 013836 (2015)].\n", "  We study the thermodynamic properties of the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC)\nin the context of the quantum field theory with non-commutative target space.\nOur main goal is to investigate in which temperature and/or energy regimes the\nnon-commutativity can characterize some influence in the BEC properties\ndescribed by a relativistic massive non-commutative boson gas. The\nnon-commutativity parameters play a key role in the modified dispersion\nrelations of the non-commutative fields, leading to a new phenomenology. We\nhave obtained the condensate fraction, internal energy, pressure and specific\nheat of the system and taken ultra-relativistic (UR) and non-relativistic\nlimits (NR). The non-commutative effects in the thermodynamic properties of the\nsystem are discussed. We found that there appear interesting signatures around\nthe critical temperature.\n", "  We present calculations of nuclear structure effects to the Lamb shift in\nlight muonic atoms. We adopt a modern ab-initio approach by combining\nstate-of-the-art nuclear potentials with the hyperspherical harmonics method.\nOur calculations are instrumental to the determination of nuclear charge radii\nin the Lamb shift measurements, which will shed light on the proton radius\npuzzle.\n", "  We have investigated the magnetic and magnetocaloric properties of\nantiferromagnetic Ising spin chain CoV$_{2}$O$_{6}$ by magnetization and heat\ncapacity measurements. Both monoclinic $\\alpha$-CoV$_{2}$O$_{6}$ and triclinic\n$\\gamma$-CoV$_{2}$O$_{6}$ exhibit field-induced metamagnetic transition from\nantiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic state via an intermediate ferrimagnetic\nstate with 1/3 magnetization plateau. Due to this field-induced metamagnetic\ntransition, these systems show large conventional as well as inverse\nmagnetocaloric effects. In $\\alpha$-CoV$_{2}$O$_{6}$, we observe field-induced\ncomplex magnetic phases and multiple magnetization plateaux at low temperature\nwhen the field is applied along $c$ axis. Several critical temperatures and\nfields have been identified from the temperature and field dependence of\nmagnetization, magnetic entropy change and heat capacity to construct the\n$H$-$T$ phase diagram. As compared to $\\alpha$-CoV$_{2}$O$_{6}$,\n$\\gamma$-CoV$_{2}$O$_{6}$ displays a relatively simple magnetic phase diagram.\nDue to the large magnetic entropy change and adiabatic temperature change at\nlow or moderate applied magnetic field, $\\gamma$-CoV$_{2}$O$_{6}$ may be\nconsidered as a magnetic refrigerant in the low-temperature region.\n", "  We report the first identification of a compact dense galaxy overdensity at\n$z\\sim8$ dubbed A2744z8OD. A2744z8OD consists of eight $Y$-dropout galaxies\nbehind Abell 2744 that is originally pinpointed by Hubble Frontier Fields\nstudies. However, no studies have, so far, derived basic physical quantities of\nstructure formation or made comparisons with theoretical models. We obtain a\nhomogeneous sample of dropout galaxies at $z\\sim8$ from eight field data of\nHubble legacy images that are as deep as the A2744z8OD data. Using the sample,\nwe find that a galaxy surface overdensity value of A2744z8OD is very high\n$\\delta\\simeq130$, where $\\delta$ is defined by an overdensity in a small\ncircle of $6\"$ ($\\simeq30$ physical kpc) radius. Because there is no such a\nlarge $\\delta$ value reported for high-$z$ overdensities to date, A2744z8OD is\na system clearly different from those found in previous high-$z$ overdensity\nstudies. In the galaxy+structure formation models of Henriques et al. (2015),\nthere exist a very similar overdensity, Modelz8OD, that is made of eight model\ndropout galaxies at $z\\sim8$ in a $6\"$-radius circle. Modelz8OD is a progenitor\nof a today's $10^{14}M_\\odot$ cluster, and more than a half of the seven\nModelz8OD galaxies are merged into the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) of the\ncluster. If Modelz8OD is a counterpart of A2744z8OD, the models suggest that\nA2744z8OD would be a part of a forming cluster core of a today's\n$10^{14}M_\\odot$ cluster that started star formation at $z>12$.\n", "  LiOsO$_3$ has been recently identified as the first unambiguous\n\"ferroelectric metal\", experimentally realizing a prediction from 1965 by\nAnderson and Blount. In this work, we investigate the metallic state in\nLiOsO$_3$ by means of infrared spectroscopy supplemented by Density Functional\nTheory and Dynamical Mean Field Theory calculations. Our measurements and\ntheoretical calculations clearly show that LiOsO$_3$ is a very bad metal with a\nsmall quasiparticle weight, close to a Mott-Hubbard localization transition.\nThe agreement between experiments and theory allows us to ascribe all the\nrelevant features in the optical conductivity to strong electron-electron\ncorrelations within the $t_{2g}$ manifold of the osmium atoms.\n", "  We explore the relationship between the nonlinear matter power spectrum and\nthe various Lagrangian and Standard Perturbation Theories (LPT and SPT). We\nfirst look at it in the context of one dimensional (1-d) dynamics, where 1LPT\nis exact at the perturbative level and one can exactly resum the SPT series\ninto the 1LPT power spectrum. Shell crossings lead to non-perturbative effects,\nand the PT ignorance can be quantified in terms of their ratio, which is also\nthe transfer function squared in the absence of stochasticity. At the order of\nPT we work, this parametrization is equivalent to the results of effective\nfield theory (EFT), and can thus be expanded in terms of the same parameters.\nWe find that its radius of convergence is larger than the SPT loop expansion.\nThe same EFT parametrization applies to all SPT loop terms and, if\nstochasticity can be ignored, to all N-point correlators. In 3-d, the LPT\nstructure is considerably more complicated, and we find that LPT models with\nparametrization motivated by the EFT exhibit running with $k$ and that SPT is\ngenerally a better choice. Since these transfer function expansions contain\nfree parameters that change with cosmological model their usefulness for\nbroadband power is unclear. For this reason we test the predictions of these\nmodels on baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) and other primordial\noscillations, including string monodromy models, for which we ran a series of\nsimulations with and without oscillations. Most models are successful in\npredicting oscillations beyond their corresponding PT versions, confirming the\nbasic validity of the model.\n", "  We calculate the electro- and chromomagnetic dipole coefficients\n$C_{7\\gamma,8g}$ and $\\tilde C_{7\\gamma,8g}$ in the context of the minimal\nRandall-Sundrum (RS) model with a Higgs sector localized on the IR brane using\nthe five-dimensional (5D) approach, where the coefficients are expressed in\nterms of integrals over 5D propagators. Since we keep the full dependence on\nthe Yukawa matrices, the integral expressions are formally valid to all orders\nin $v^2/M_{\\rm KK}^2$. In addition we relate our results to the expressions\nobtained in the Kaluza-Klein (KK) decomposed theory and show the consistency in\nboth pictures analytically and numerically, which presents a non-trivial\ncross-check. In Feynman-'t Hooft gauge, the dominant corrections from virtual\nKK modes arise from the scalar parts of the $W^\\pm$-boson penguin diagrams,\nincluding the contributions from the scalar component of the 5D gauge-boson\nfield and from the charged Goldstone bosons in the Higgs sector. The size of\nthe KK corrections depends on the parameter $y_\\ast$, which sets the upper\nbound for the anarchic 5D Yukawa matrices. We find that for $y_\\ast\\gtrsim1$\nthe dominant KK corrections are proportional to $y_\\ast^2$. We discuss the\nphenomenological implications of our results for the branching ratio ${\\rm\nBr}(\\bar B\\to X_s\\gamma)$, the time-dependent CP asymmetry $S_{K^*\\gamma}$, the\ndirect CP asymmetry $A_{\\rm CP}^{b\\to s\\gamma}$ and the CP asymmetry difference\n$\\Delta A_{\\rm CP}^{b\\to s\\gamma}$. We can derive a lower bound on the first KK\ngluon resonance of $3.8\\,$TeV for $y_\\ast=3$, requiring that at least $10\\%$ of\nthe RS parameter space covers the experimental $2\\sigma$ error margins. We\nfurther discuss the branching ratio ${\\rm Br}(\\bar B\\to X_sl^+l^-)$ and compare\nour predictions for $C_{7\\gamma,9,10}$ and $\\tilde C_{7\\gamma,9,10}$ with\nphenomenological results derived from model-independent analyses.\n", "  We consider Euclidean Conformal Field Theories perturbed by quenched\ndisorder, namely by random fluctuations in their couplings. Such theories are\nrelevant for second-order phase transitions in the presence of impurities or\nother forms of disorder. Theories with quenched disorder often flow to new\nfixed points of the renormalization group. We begin with disorder in free field\ntheories. Imry and Ma showed that disordered free fields can only exist for\nd>4. For d>4 we show that disorder leads to new fixed points which are not\nscale-invariant. We then move on to large-N theories (vector models or gauge\ntheories in the `t Hooft limit). We compute exactly the beta function for the\ndisorder, and the correlation functions of the disordered theory. We generalize\nthe results of Imry and Ma by showing that such disordered theories exist only\nwhen disorder couples to operators of dimension \\Delta > d/4. Sometimes the\ndisordered fixed points are not scale-invariant, and in other cases they have\nunconventional dependence on the disorder, including non-trivial effects due to\nirrelevant operators. Holography maps disorder in conformal theories to\nstochastic differential equations in a higher-dimensional space. We use this\ndictionary to reproduce our field theory results. We also study the leading 1/N\ncorrections, both by field theory methods and by holography. These corrections\nare particularly important when disorder scales with the number of degrees of\nfreedom.\n", "  We unveil novel spin textures in an itinerant fermion model on a frustrated\ntriangular lattice in the limit of low electronic density. Using hybrid Monte\nCarlo simulations on finite clusters we identify two type of nanoscale spin\ntextures in the background of 120 degree order : (i) a planar ferromagnetic\ncluster, and (ii) and a non-coplanar cluster with spins oriented perpendicular\nto the 120 degree plane. Both these textures lead to localization of the\nelectronic wavefunctions and are in-turn stabilized by the concomitant charge\nmodulations. The non-coplanar spin texture is accompanied by an unusual scalar\nchirality pattern. A well defined electric charge and magnetic moment\nassociated with these textures allow for their easy manipulation by external\nelectric and magnetic fields - a desirable feature for data storage. We\nidentify a localization-delocalization behavior for electronic wavefunctions\nwhich is unique to frustrated magnets, and propose a general framework for\nstabilizing similar spin textures in spin-charge coupled systems.\n", "  This article presents new features of the MCSANC v.1.20 program, a Monte\nCarlo tool for calculation of the next-to-leading order electroweak and QCD\ncorrections to various Standard Model processes. The extensions concern\nimplementation of Drell--Yan-like processes and include a systematic treatment\nof the photon-induced contribution in proton--proton collisions and electroweak\ncorrections beyond NLO approximation. There are also technical improvements\nsuch as calculation of the forward-backward asymmetry for the neutral current\nDrell--Yan process. The updated code is suitable for studies of the effects due\nto EW and QCD radiative corrections to Drell--Yan (and several other) processes\nat the LHC and for forthcoming high energy proton--proton colliders.\n", "  We demonstrate a solid state spin-wave optical memory based on stopped light\nin a spectral hole. A long lived narrow spectral hole is created by optical\npumping in the inhomogeneous absorption profile of a Pr$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$\ncrystal. Optical pulses sent through the spectral hole experience a strong\nreduction of their group velocity and are spatially compressed in the crystal.\nA short Raman pulse transfers the optical excitation to the spin state before\nthe light pulse exits the crystal, effectively stopping the light. After a\ncontrollable delay, a second Raman pulse is sent, which leads to the emission\nof the stored photons. We reach storage and retrieval efficiencies for bright\npulses of up to $39\\,\\%$ in a $5 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$-long crystal. We also show that\nour device works at the single photon level by storing and retrieving\n$3\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s}$-long weak coherent pulses with efficiencies up to $31\\,\\%$,\ndemonstrating the most efficient spin-wave solid state optical memory at the\nsingle-photon level so far. We reach an unconditional noise level of\n$(9\\pm1)\\times 10^{-3}$ photons per pulse in a detection window of\n$4\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s}$ leading to a signal-to-noise ratio of $33 \\pm 4$ for an\naverage input photon number of 1, making our device promising for long-lived\nstorage of non-classical light.\n", "  The two long-baseline experiments T2K and NO$\\nu$A have recently presented\nnew findings. T2K has shown the first $\\bar \\nu_e$ appearance data while\nNO$\\nu$A has released the first $\\nu_e$ appearance results. These data are of\nparticular importance because they allow us to probe for the first time in a\ndirect (or manifest) way the leptonic CP-violation. In fact, it is the first\ntime that a hint of CP-violation arises from the comparison of the observations\nof neutrinos and antineutrinos. We consider the implications of such new\nresults both for the standard 3-flavor framework and for the non-standard 3+1\nscheme involving one sterile neutrino species. The 3-flavor analysis shows a\nconsolidation of the previous trends, namely a slight preference for $\\sin\n\\delta <0$, disfavoring CP conservation ($\\delta =0, \\pi$) with a statistical\nsignificance close to $90\\%$ C.L., and a mild preference (at more than 68\\%\nC.L.) for the normal hierarchy. In a 3+1 framework, the data constrain two\nCP-phases ($\\delta_{13} \\equiv \\delta$ and $\\delta_{14}$), which exhibit a\nslight preference for the common value $\\delta_{13} \\simeq \\delta_{14} \\simeq\n-\\pi/2 $. Interestingly, in the enlarged four neutrino scheme the preference\nfor the normal hierarchy found within the 3-flavor framework completely\ndisappears. This indicates that light sterile neutrinos may constitute a\npotential source of fragility in the capability of the two LBL experiments of\ndiscriminating the neutrino mass hierarchy.\n", "  We calculate total and differential cross sections for $J/\\psi$\nphotoproduction in ultrarelativistic lead-lead collisions at the LHC energy\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$ TeV. In the present approach we use a simple model based\non vector dominance picture and multiple scattering of the hadronic ($c \\bar\nc$) state in a cold nucleus as an example. In our analysis we use both the\nclassical mechanics and quantum (Glauber) formulae for calculating\n$\\sigma_{tot}(J/\\psi Pb)$ which is a building block of our model. We compare\nour UPC results with ALICE and CMS data. For semi-central collisions\n($b<R_A+R_B$) a modification of the photon flux seems necessary. We discuss\ndifferent physics motivated approximations. We try to estimate the cross\nsections for different centrality bins and for $J/\\psi$ mesons emitted in\nforward rapidity range ($2.5<y<4$) corresponding to recent ALICE experimental\nresults. Reasonable results are obtained but open questions are discussed.\n", "  Contrary to standard coupled cluster doubles (CCD) and Brueckner doubles\n(BD), singlet-paired analogues of CCD and BD (denoted here as CCD0 and BD0) do\nnot break down when static correlation is present, but neglect substantial\namounts of dynamic correlation. In fact, CCD0 and BD0 do not account for any\ncontributions from multielectron excitations involving only same-spin electrons\nat all. We exploit this feature to add---without introducing double counting,\nself-interaction, or increase in cost---the missing correlation to these\nmethods via meta-GGA density functionals (TPSS and SCAN). Furthermore, we\nimprove upon these CCD0+DFT blends by invoking range separation: the short- and\nlong-range correlations absent in CCD0/BD0 are evaluated with DFT and the\ndirect random phase approximation (dRPA), respectively. This corrects the\ndescription of long-range van der Waals forces. Comprehensive benchmarking\nshows that the combinations presented here are very accurate for weakly\ncorrelated systems, while also providing a reasonable description of strongly\ncorrelated problems without resorting to symmetry breaking.\n", "  In stochastic systems with weak noise, the logarithm of the stationary\ndistribution becomes proportional to a large deviation rate function called the\nquasi-potential. The quasi-potential, and its characterization through a\nvariational problem, lies at the core of the Freidlin-Wentzell large deviations\ntheory%.~\\cite{freidlin1984}.In many interacting particle systems, the particle\ndensity is described by fluctuating hydrodynamics governed by Macroscopic\nFluctuation Theory%, ~\\cite{bertini2014},which formally fits within\nFreidlin-Wentzell's framework with a weak noise proportional to $1/\\sqrt{N}$,\nwhere $N$ is the number of particles. The quasi-potential then appears as a\nnatural generalization of the equilibrium free energy to non-equilibrium\nparticle systems. A key physical and practical issue is to actually compute\nquasi-potentials from their variational characterization for non-equilibrium\nsystems for which detailed balance does not hold. We discuss how to perform\nsuch a computation perturbatively in an external parameter $\\lambda$, starting\nfrom a known quasi-potential for $\\lambda=0$. In a general setup, explicit\niterative formulae for all terms of the power-series expansion of the\nquasi-potential are given for the first time. The key point is a proof of\nsolvability conditions that assure the existence of the perturbation expansion\nto all orders. We apply the perturbative approach to diffusive particles\ninteracting through a mean-field potential. For such systems, the variational\ncharacterization of the quasi-potential was proven by Dawson and Gartner%.\n~\\cite{dawson1987,dawson1987b}. Our perturbative analysis provides new explicit\nresults about the quasi-potential and about fluctuations of one-particle\nobservables in a simple example of mean field diffusions: the\nShinomoto-Kuramoto model of coupled rotators%. ~\\cite{shinomoto1986}. This is\none of few systems for which non-equilibrium free energies can be computed and\nanalyzed in an effective way, at least perturbatively.\n", "  We present here a relationship among massive self-dual models for spin-3\nparticles in $D=2+1$ via the master action procedure. Starting with a first\norder model (in derivatives) $S_{SD(1)}$ we have constructed a master action\nwhich interpolates among a sequence of four self-dual models $S_{SD(i)}$ where\n$i=1,2,3,4$. By analyzing the particle content of mixing terms, we give\nadditional arguments that explain why it is apparently impossible to jump from\nthe fourth order model to a higher order model. We have also analyzed\nsimilarities and differences between the fourth order $K$-term in the spin-2\ncase and the analogous fourth order term in the spin-3 context.\n", "  In general, classical measurement statistics of a quantum measurement is\ndisturbed by performing an additional incompatible quantum measurement\nbeforehand. Using this observation, we introduce a state-independent definition\nof disturbance by relating it to the distinguishability problem between two\nclassical statistical distributions --- one resulting from a single quantum\nmeasurement and the other from a succession of two quantum measurements.\nInterestingly, we find an error-disturbance trade-off relation for any\nmeasurements in two-dimensional Hilbert space and for measurements with\nmutually unbiased bases in any finite-dimensional Hilbert space. This relation\nshows that error should be reduced to zero in order to minimize the sum of\nerror and disturbance. We conjecture that a similar trade-off relation can be\ngeneralized to any measurements in an arbitrary finite-dimensional Hilbert\nspace.\n", "  With the upgrade of the LHC, the couplings of the observed Higgs particle to\nfermions and gauge bosons will be measured with a much higher experimental\naccuracy than current measurements, but will still be limited by an order 10%\ntheoretical uncertainty. In this paper, we re-emphasize the fact that the ratio\nof Higgs signal rates into two photons and four leptons, $D_{\\gamma \\gamma}=\n\\sigma(pp\\to H \\to \\gamma \\gamma)/\\sigma(pp\\to H \\to ZZ^* \\to 4\\ell^\\pm)$ can\nbe made free of these ambiguities. Its measurement would be limited only by the\nstatistical and systematic errors, which can in principle be reduced to the\npercent level at a high-luminosity LHC. This decay ratio would then provide a\npowerful probe of new physics effects in addition to high precision electroweak\nobservables or the muon g-2. As an example, we show that the Higgs couplings to\ntop quarks and vector bosons can be constrained at the percent level and that\nnew Higgs or supersymmetric particles that contribute to the H$\\gamma\\gamma$\nloop can be probed up to masses in the multi-TeV range and possibly larger than\nthose accessible directly.\n", "  We consider a system consisting of a large individual quantum dot with\nexcitonic resonance coupled to a single mode photonic cavity in the nonlinear\nregime when exciton- exciton interaction becomes important. We show that in the\npresence of time-modulated external coherent pumping the system demonstrates\nessentially non classical behavior reflected in sub-Poissonian statistics of\nexciton- and photon-modes and the Wigner functions with negative values in\nphase-space for time-intervals exceeding the characteristic time of dissipative\nprocesses, $t\\gg\\gamma^{-1}$. It is shown that these results are cardinally\ndifferent from the analogous results in the regime of the monomode\ncontinues-wave (cw) excitation.\n", "  We study a model of resonant point-contact tunneling of a single\nLuttinger-liquid lead, using the boundary state formulation. The model is\ndescribed by a single chiral Fermion in one dimensional space with one point\ncontact interaction at the origin. It is the simplest model of this type. By\nfolding the infinite line we map the model onto a non-chiral model on the half\ninfinite line and transcribe the point-contact tunneling interaction into a\nboundary interaction. The tunneling interaction yields a non-local effective\naction at the boundary. We explicitly construct the boundary state and evaluate\nthe current correlation functions. The contact interaction is shown to act on\nthe lower frequency modes more strongly.\n", "  We consider the hadroproduction of W gauge bosons in their leptonic decay\nmode. Starting from the leading-order expressions, we show that by defining a\nsuitable scaling variable the centre-of-mass dependence of the cross sections\nat the LHC energies can be essentially described by a simple power law. The\nscaling exponent is directly linked to the small-$x$ behaviour of parton\ndistribution functions (PDF) which, at the high virtualities involved in W\nproduction, is largely dictated by QCD evolution equations. This entails a\nparticularly simple scaling law for the lepton charge asymmetry and also\npredicts that measurements in different collision systems (p-p, p-$\\bar{\\rm\np}$, p-Pb Pb-Pb) are straightforwardly related. The expectations are compared\nwith the existing data and a very good overall agreement is observed. It is\nshown that the PDF uncertainty in certain cross-section ratios between nearby\ncentre-of-mass energies can be significantly reduced by taking the ratios at\nfixed value of scaling variable instead of fixed rapidity.\n", "  We derive and interpret solutions of time-harmonic Maxwell's equations with a\nvertical and a horizontal electric dipole near a planar, thin conducting film,\ne.g. graphene sheet, lying between two unbounded isotropic and non-magnetic\nmedia. Exact expressions for all field components are extracted in terms of\nrapidly convergent series of known transcendental functions when the ambient\nmedia have equal permittivities and both the dipole and observation point lie\non the plane of the film. These solutions are simplified for all distances from\nthe source when the film surface resistivity is large in magnitude compared to\nthe intrinsic impedance of the ambient space. The formulas reveal the\nanalytical structure of two types of waves that can possibly be excited by the\ndipoles and propagate on the film. One of these waves is intimately related to\nthe surface plasmon-polariton of transverse-magnetic (TM) polarization of plane\nwaves.\n", "  The spatial distribution of the internal pressure of an electron fluid, which\nspontaneously arises at the formation of a molecule or a crystal, is linked to\nthe main features of chemical bonding in molecular crystals. The local pressure\nis approximately expressed in terms of the experimental electron density and\nits derivatives using the density functional formalism and is applied to\nidentify the bonding features in benzene, formamide and chromium hexacarbonyl.\nWe established how the spatial regions of compression and stretching of the\nelectron fluid in these solids reflect the typical features of chemical bonds\nof different types. Thus, the internal electronic pressure can serve as a\nbonding descriptor, which has a clear physical meaning and reveals the specific\nfeatures of variety of the chemical bonds expressing them in terms of the\nelectron density.\n", "  We prove that any symmetric Hamiltonian that is a quadratic function of the\ncoordinates and momenta has a pseudo-Hermitian adjoint or regular matrix\nrepresentation. The eigenvalues of the latter matrix are the natural\nfrequencies of the Hamiltonian operator. When all the eigenvalues of the matrix\nare real, then the spectrum of the symmetric Hamiltonian is real and the\noperator is Hermitian. As illustrative examples we choose the quadratic\nHamiltonians that model a pair of coupled resonators with balanced gain and\nloss, the electromagnetic self-force on an oscillating charged particle and an\nactive LRC circuit.\n", "  One simplified black hole model constructed from a semiclassical analysis of\nloop quantum gravity (LQG) is called self-dual black hole. This black hole\nsolution depends on a free dimensionless parameter P known as the polymeric\nparameter and also on the $a_{0}$ area related to the minimum area gap of LQG.\nIn the limit of P and $a_{0}$ going to zero, the usual Schwarzschild-solution\nis recovered. Here we investigate the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of massless\nscalar perturbations in the self-dual black hole background. We compute the QN\nfrequencies using the sixth order WKB approximation method and compare them\nwith numerical solutions of the Regge-Wheeler equation. Our results show that\nas the parameter P grows, the real part of the QN frequencies suffers an\ninitial increase and then starts to decrease while the magnitude of the\nimaginary one decreases for fixed area gap $a_{0}$. This particular feature\nmeans that the damping of scalar perturbations in the self-dual black hole\nspacetimes are slower, and their oscillations are faster or slower according to\nthe value of P.\n", "  The scores obtained by students that have performed the ENEM exam, the\nBrazilian High School National Examination used to admit students at the\nBrazilian universities, is analyzed. The average high school's scores are\ncompared between different disciplines through the Pearson correlation\ncoefficient. The results show a very large correlation between the performance\nin the different subjects. Even thought the students' scores in the ENEM due to\nthe standardization form a Gaussian, we show that the high schools' scores form\na bimodal distribution that can not be used to evaluate and compare performance\nover time. We also show that this high schools distribution reflects the\ncorrelation between school performance and economic level of the students. The\nENEM's scores are compared with a Brazilian non standardized exam, the entrance\nexam at the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul. The comparison of the\nperformance of the same individuals in both tests is compared showing that the\ntwo tests not only select different abilities but chooses a different set of\nindividuals. Our results indicates that standardized exams might be an\ninteresting tool to compare performance over the years but only of individuals\nand not of institutions.\n", "  Turbulence is ubiquitous in molecular clouds (MCs), but its origin is still\nunclear because MCs are usually assumed to live longer than the turbulence\ndissipation time. Interstellar medium (ISM) turbulence is likely driven by SN\nexplosions, but it has never been demonstrated that SN explosions can establish\nand maintain a turbulent cascade inside MCs consistent with the observations.\nIn this work, we carry out a simulation of SN-driven turbulence in a volume of\n(250 pc)$^3$, specifically designed to test if SN driving alone can be\nresponsible for the observed turbulence inside MCs. We find that SN driving\nestablishes a velocity scaling consistent with the usual scaling laws of\nsupersonic turbulence, suggesting that previous idealized simulations of MC\nturbulence, driven with a random, large-scale volume force, were correctly\nadopted as appropriate models for MC turbulence, despite the artificial\ndriving. We also find that the same scaling laws extend to the interior of MCs,\nand that the velocity-size relation of the MCs selected from our simulation is\nconsistent with that of MCs from the Outer-Galaxy Survey, the largest MC sample\navailable. The mass-size relation and the mass and size probability\ndistributions also compare successfully with those of the Outer Galaxy Survey.\nFinally, we show that MC turbulence is super-Alfv\\'{e}nic with respect to both\nthe mean and rms magnetic-field strength. We conclude that MC structure and\ndynamics are the natural result of SN-driven turbulence.\n", "  We investigate the geodesics in the entire class of nonexpanding impulsive\ngravitational waves propagating in an (anti-)de Sitter universe using the\ndistributional form of the metric. Employing a 5-dimensional embedding\nformalism and a general regularisation technique we prove existence and\nuniqueness of geodesics crossing the wave impulse leading to a completeness\nresult. We also derive the explicit form of the geodesics thereby confirming\nprevious results derived in a heuristic approach.\n", "  The pseudoscalar resonance or \"A-funnel\" in the Minimal Supersymmetric\nStandard Model~(MSSM) is a widely studied framework for explaining dark matter\nthat can yield interesting indirect detection and collider signals. The\nwell-known Galactic Center excess (GCE) at GeV energies in the gamma ray\nspectrum, consistent with annihilation of a $\\lesssim 40$ GeV dark matter\nparticle, has more recently been shown to be compatible with significantly\nheavier masses following reanalysis of the background. In this paper, we\nexplore the LHC and direct detection implications of interpreting the GCE in\nthis extended mass window within the MSSM A-funnel framework. We find that\ncompatibility with relic density, signal strength, collider constraints, and\nHiggs data can be simultaneously achieved with appropriate parameter choices.\nThe compatible regions give very sharp predictions of 200-600 GeV CP-odd/even\nHiggs bosons at low tan$\\beta$ at the LHC and spin-independent cross sections\n$\\approx 10^{-11}$ pb at direct detection experiments. Regardless of\nconsistency with the GCE, this study serves as a useful template of the strong\ncorrelations between indirect, direct, and LHC signatures of the MSSM A-funnel\nregion.\n", "  We comment on the paper \"Dark Matter collisions with the Human Body\" by K.\nFreese and C. Savage (Phys. Lett. B 717, 25 (2012) [arXiv:1204.1339]) and\ndescribe a dark matter model for which the results of the previous paper do not\nquite apply. Within this mirror dark matter model, potentially hazardous\nobjects, mirror micrometeorites, can exist and may lead to diseases triggered\nby multiple mutations, such as cancer, though with very low probability.\n", "  A detailed description of the baryon direct Urca processes A: $n\\rightarrow\np+e+\\bar{\\nu}_{e}$, B: $\\Lambda\\rightarrow p+e+\\bar{\\nu}_{e}$, C:\n$\\Xi^{-}\\rightarrow\\Lambda+e+\\bar{\\nu}_{e}$ related to the neutron star cooling\nis given in the relativistic mean field approximation.The contributions of the\nreactions B and C on the neutrino luminosity are calculated by means of the\nrelativistic expressions of the neutrino energy losses.Our results show that\nthe total neutrino luminosities of the reactions A, B, C within the mass range\n1.603-2.067$M_{\\odot}$ (1.515-1.840$M_{\\odot}$ for TM1 model) for GM1 model are\nlarger than the corresponding values for neutron stars in npe$\\mu$ matter.\nAlthough the hyperon direct Urca processes B and C reduce the neutrino\nemissivity of the reaction A, it illustrates the reactions B and C still make\nthe total neutrino luminosity enhancement in the above mentioned\nareas.Furthermore, when we only consider the $^{1}S_{0}$ proton superfluidity\nin neutron star cooling, we find that although the neutrino emissivity of the\nreactions A and B is suppressed with the appearance of $^{1}S_{0}$ proton\nsuperfluidity, the total contribution of the reactions A, B, C can still\nquicken a massive neutron star cooling.These results could be used to help\nprove appearing hyperons in PSR J1614-2230 and J0348+0432 from neutron star\ncooling perspective.\n", "  Minimal absent words (MAW) of a genomic sequence are subsequences that are\nabsent themselves but the subwords of which are all present in the sequence.\nThe characteristic distribution of genomic MAWs as a function of their length\nhas been observed to be qualitatively similar for all living organisms, the\nbulk being rather short, and only relatively few being long. It has been an\nopen issue whether the reason behind this phenomenon is statistical or reflects\na biological mechanism, and what biological information is contained in absent\nwords. In this work we demonstrate that the bulk can be described by a\nprobabilistic model of sampling words from random sequences, while the tail of\nlong MAWs is of biological origin. We introduce the novel concept of a core of\na minimal absent word, which are sequences present in the genome and closest to\na given MAW. We show that in bacteria and yeast the cores of the longest MAWs,\nwhich exist in two or more copies, are located in highly conserved regions the\nmost prominent example being ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs). We also show that while\nthe distribution of the cores of long MAWs is roughly uniform over these\ngenomes on a coarse-grained level, on a more detailed level it is strongly\nenhanced in 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) and, to a lesser extent, also in 5'\nUTRs. This indicates that MAWs and associated MAW cores correspond to\nfine-tuned evolutionary relationships, and suggest that they can be more widely\nused as markers for genomic complexity.\n", "  Within the resolved Pomeron model of hard diffractive scattering, we compute\nprompt photon production in double-Pomeron-exchange events in proton-proton\ncollisions. Using specific kinematical constraints chosen according to the\nacceptances of the forward proton detectors of experiments at the Large Hadron\nCollider, we provide estimates for inclusive and isolated photon production.\nThis is done using the JetPhox program. We find that next-to-leading order\ncorrections to the hard process are important and must be included in order to\ncorrectly constrain the quark and gluon content of the Pomeron from such\nprocesses at the LHC.\n", "  In the Yule-Simon process, selection of words follows the preferential\nattachment mechanism, resulting in the power-law growth in the cumulative\nnumber of individual word occurrences. This is derived using mean-field\napproximation, assuming a continuum limit of both the time and number of word\noccurrences. However, time and word occurrences are inherently discrete in the\nprocess, and it is natural to assume that the cumulative number of word\noccurrences has a certain fluctuation around the average behavior predicted by\nthe mean-field approximation. We derive the exact and approximate forms of the\nprobability distribution of such fluctuation analytically and confirm that\nthose probability distributions are well supported by the numerical\nexperiments.\n", "  We consider a one-dimensional, weakly asymmetric, boundary driven exclusion\nprocess on the interval $[0,N]\\cap Z$ in the super-diffusive time scale $N^2\n\\epsilon^{-1}_N$, where $1\\ll \\epsilon^{-1}_N \\ll N^{1/4}$. We assume that the\nexternal field and the chemical potentials, which fix the density at the\nboundaries, evolve smoothly in the macroscopic time scale. We derive an\nequation which describes the evolution of the density up to the order\n$\\epsilon_N$.\n", "  Optical tweezers that utilize a highly focused, linearly polarized laser beam\nexhibit strong trap stiffness asymmetry, which originates from the anisotropic\nfield distribution in the transverse plane. Based on the previous study of\npolarization-dependent focused field distribution, we explore its manifestation\nin optical trap in terms of trap stiffness asymmetry. Our results demonstrate\nthat polarization control provides a versatile tuning knob for tailoring\noptical potential landscape even in case of a strongly modified focused field\nin the presence of dielectric spheres larger than the wavelength of a trap\nbeam.\n", "  Strong decay constants of the heavy tensor to heavy pseudoscalar (vector) and\nlight pseudoscalar mesons are estimated within the light cone QCD sum rules. It\nis obtained that the values of these coupling constants are very strongly\ndependent on the choice of the Lorentz structure. Moreover, using these strong\ncoupling constants the corresponding decay widths are calculated.\n", "  We present a study of the clustering and halo occupation distribution of BOSS\nCMASS galaxies in the redshift range 0.43 < z < 0.7 drawn from the Final\nSDSS-III Data Release. We compare the BOSS results with the predictions of a\nHalo Abundance Matching (HAM) clustering model that assigns galaxies to dark\nmatter halos selected from the large BigMultiDark $N$-body simulation of a flat\n$\\Lambda$CDM Planck cosmology. We compare the observational data with the\nsimulated ones on a light-cone constructed from 20 subsequent outputs of the\nsimulation. Observational effects such as incompleteness, geometry, veto masks\nand fiber collisions are included in the model, which reproduces within\n1-$\\sigma$ errors the observed monopole of the 2-point correlation function at\nall relevant scales: from the smallest scales, 0.5 $h^{-1}$ Mpc, up to scales\nbeyond the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation feature. This model also agrees\nremarkably well with the BOSS galaxy power spectrum (up to $k\\sim1$ $h$\nMpc$^{-1}$), and the Three-point correlation function. The quadrupole of the\ncorrelation function presents some tensions with observations. We discuss\npossible causes that can explain this disagreement, including target selection\neffects. Overall, the standard HAM model describes remarkably well the\nclustering statistics of the CMASS sample. We compare the stellar to halo mass\nrelation for the CMASS sample measured using weak lensing in the CFHT Stripe 82\nSurvey with the prediction of our clustering model, and find a good agreement\nwithin 1-$\\sigma$. The BigMD-BOSS light-cone including properties of BOSS\ngalaxies and halo properties is made publicly available.\n", "  BaH (and its isotopomers) is an attractive molecular candidate for laser\ncooling to ultracold temperatures and a potential precursor for the production\nof ultracold gases of hydrogen and deuterium. The theoretical challenge is to\nsimulate the laser cooling cycle as reliably as possible and this paper\naddresses the generation of a highly accurate ab initio $^{2}\\Sigma^+$\npotential for such studies. The performance of various basis sets within the\nmulti-reference configuration-interaction (MRCI) approximation with the\nDavidson correction (MRCI+Q) is tested and taken to the complete basis set\nlimit. It is shown that the calculated molecular constants using a 46 electron\nEffective Core-Potential (ECP), the augmented polarized core-valence quintuplet\nbasis set (aug-pCV5Z-PP) but only including three active electrons in the MRCI\ncalculation are in close agreement with the available experimental values. The\npredicted dissociation energy D$_e$ for the X$^2\\Sigma^+$ state (extrapolated\nto the complete basis set (CBS) limit) is 16895.12 cm$^{-1}$ (2.094 eV), which\nagrees within 0.1$\\%$ of a revised experimental value of $<$16910.6 cm$^{-1}$,\nwhile the calculated r$_e$ is within 0.03 pm of the experimental result.\n", "  We translate the quantum teleportation protocol into a sequence of coherent\noperations involving three degrees of freedom of a classical laser beam. The\nprotocol, which we demonstrate experimentally, transfers the polarisation state\nof the input beam to the transverse mode of the output beam. The role of\nquantum entanglement is played by a non-separable mode describing the path and\ntransverse degrees of freedom. Our protocol illustrates the possibility of new\noptical applications based on this intriguing classical analogue of quantum\nentanglement.\n", "  Polymers in confined spaces lose conformational entropy. This induces a net\nrepulsive entropic force on the walls of the confining space. A model for this\nphenomenon is a lattice walk between confining walls, and in this paper a model\nof an adsorbing partially directed walk is used. The walk is placed in a half\nsquare lattice $L^2_+$ with boundary $\\partial L^2_+$, and confined between two\nvertical parallel walls, which are vertical lines in the lattice, a distance\n$w$ apart. The free energy of the walk is determined, as a function of $w$, for\nwalks with endpoints in the confining walls and adsorbing in $\\partial L^2_+$.\nThis gives the entropic force on the confining walls as a function of $w$. It\nis shown that there are zero force points in this model and the locations of\nthese points are determined, in some cases exactly, and in other cases\nasymptotically.\n", "  While the properties of the signal that was discovered in the Higgs searches\nat the LHC are consistent so far with the Higgs boson of the Standard Model\n(SM), it is crucial to investigate to what extent other interpretations that\nmay correspond to very different underlying physics are compatible with the\ncurrent results. We use the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model\n(NMSSM) as a well-motivated theoretical framework with a sufficiently rich\nHiggs phenomenology to address this question, making use of the public tools\nHiggsBounds and HiggsSignals in order to take into account comprehensive\nexperimental information on both the observed signal and on the existing limits\nfrom Higgs searches at LEP, the TeVatron and the LHC. We find that besides the\ndecoupling limit resulting in a single light state with SM-like properties,\nseveral other configurations involving states lighter or quasi-degenerate with\nthe one at about 125 GeV turn out to give a competitive fit to the Higgs data\nand other existing constraints. We discuss the phenomenology and possible\nfuture experimental tests of those scenarios, and compare the features of\nspecific scenarios chosen as examples with those arising from a more global\nfit.\n", "  We present a dual-species effusive source and Zeeman slower designed to\nproduce slow atomic beams of two elements with a large mass difference and with\nvery different oven temperature requirements. We demonstrate this design for\nthe case of $^6$Li and $^{85}$Rb and achieve MOT loading rates equivalent to\nthat reported in prior work on dual species (Rb+Li) Zeeman slowers operating at\nthe same oven temperatures. Key design choices, including thermally separating\nthe effusive sources and using a segmented coil design to enable computer\ncontrol of the magnetic field profile, ensure that the apparatus can be easily\nmodified to slow other atomic species. By performing the final slowing using\nthe quadruple magnetic field of the MOT, we are able to shorten our Zeeman\nslower length making for a more compact system without compromising\nperformance. We outline the construction and analyze the emission properties of\nour effusive sources. We also verify the performance of the source and slower,\nand we observe sequential loading rates of $8 \\times 10^8$ atoms/s for a Rb\noven temperature of $120\\,^{\\circ}$C and $1.5 \\times 10^8$ atoms/s for a Li\nreservoir at $450\\,^{\\circ}$C, corresponding to reservoir lifetimes for\ncontinuous operation of 10 and 4 years respectively.\n", "  Dynamics of ordering in Ising model, following quench to zero temperature,\nhave been studied via Glauber spin-flip Monte Carlo simulations in space\ndimensions $d=2$ and $3$. One of the primary objectives has been to understand\nphenomena associated with the persistent spins, viz., time decay in the number\nof unaffected spins, growth of the corresponding pattern and its fractal\ndimensionality, for varying correlation length in the initial configurations,\nprepared at different temperatures, at and above the critical value. It is\nobserved that the fractal dimensionality and the exponent describing the\npower-law decay of persistence probability are strongly dependent upon the\nrelative values of nonequilibrium domain size and the initial equilibrium\ncorrelation length. Via appropriate scaling analyses, these quantities have\nbeen estimated for quenches from infinite and critical temperatures. The above\nmentioned dependence is observed to be less pronounced in higher dimension. In\naddition to these findings for the local persistence, we present results for\nthe global persistence as well. Further, important observations on the standard\ndomain growth problem are reported. For the latter, a controversy in $d=3$,\nrelated to the value of the exponent for the power-law growth of the average\ndomain size with time, has been resolved.\n", "  The peak of the heavy quark pair entropy at the deconfinement transition,\nobserved in lattice QCD, suggests that the transition is effectively driven by\nthe increase of the entropy of bound states. The growth of the entropy with the\ninter-quark distance leads to the emergent entropic force that induces\ndissociation of quarkonium states. Since the quark-gluon plasma around the\ntransition point is a strongly coupled system, we use the gauge-gravity duality\nto study the entropy of heavy quarkonium and the real-time dynamics of its\ndissociation. In particular, we employ the Improved Holographic QCD model as a\ndual description of large $N_c$ Yang Mills theory. Studying the dynamics of the\nfundamental string between the quarks placed on the boundary, we find that the\nentropy peaks at the transition point. We also study the real-time dynamics of\nthe system by considering the holographic string falling in the black hole\nhorizon where it equilibrates. In the vicinity the deconfinement transition,\nthe dissociation time is found to be less than a fermi, suggesting that the\nentropic destruction is the dominant dissociation mechanism in this temperature\nregion.\n", "  Invariant solutions of shear flows have recently been extended from spatially\nperiodic solutions in minimal flow units to spatially localized solutions on\nextended domains. One set of spanwise-localized solutions of plane Couette flow\nexhibits homoclinic snaking, a process by which steady-state solutions grow\nadditional structure smoothly at their fronts when continued parametrically.\nHomoclinic snaking is well understood mathematically in the context of the\none-dimensional Swift-Hohenberg equation. Consequently, the snaking solutions\nof plane Couette flow form a promising connection between the largely\nphenomenological study of laminar-turbulent patterns in viscous shear flows and\nthe mathematically well-developed field of pattern-formation theory. In this\npaper we present a numerical study of the snaking solutions, generalizing\nbeyond the fixed streamwise wavelength of previous studies. We find a number of\nnew solution features, including bending, skewing, and finite-size effects. We\nshow that the finite-size effects result from the shift-reflect symmetry of the\ntraveling wave and establish the parameter regions over which snaking occurs. A\nnew winding solution of plane Couette flow is derived from a strongly skewed\nlocalized equilibrium.\n", "  We demonstrate an ultralow-noise microrod-resonator based laser that\noscillates on the gain supplied by the stimulated Brillouin scattering optical\nnonlinearity. Microresonator Brillouin lasers are known to offer an outstanding\nfrequency noise floor, which is limited by fundamental thermal fluctuations.\nHere, we show experimental evidence that thermal effects also dominate the\nclose-to-carrier frequency fluctuations. The 6-mm diameter microrod resonator\nused in our experiments has a large optical mode area of ~100 {\\mu}m$^2$, and\nhence its 10 ms thermal time constant filters the close-to-carrier optical\nfrequency noise. The result is an absolute laser linewidth of 240 Hz with a\ncorresponding white-frequency noise floor of 0.1 Hz$^2$/Hz. We explain the\nsteady-state performance of this laser by measurements of its operation state\nand of its mode detuning and lineshape. Our results highlight a mechanism for\nnoise that is common to many microresonator devices due to the inherent\ncoupling between intracavity power and mode frequency. We demonstrate the\nability to reduce this noise through a feedback loop that stabilizes the\nintracavity power.\n", "  After the neutrino mixing angle $\\theta_{13}$ has been precisely measured by\nthe reactor antineutrino experiments, one of the most important open questions\nleft in neutrino physics is the neutrino mass hierarchy. Jiangmen Underground\nNeutrino Observatory (JUNO) is designed to determine the neutrino mass\nhierarchy (MH) without exploring the matter effect. The JUNO site location is\noptimized to have the best sensitivity for the mass hierarchy determination.\nJUNO will employ a 20 kton liquid scintillator detector located in a laboratory\n700 meters underground. The excellent energy resolution and PMT coverage will\ngive us an unprecedented opportunity to reach a 3-4 $\\sigma$ precision. In this\npaper, the JUNO detector design and simulation work will be presented. Also,\nRENO-50, another medium distance reactor antineutrino experiment, will do a\nsimilar measurement. With the efforts of these experiments, it is very likely\nthat the neutrino mass hierarchy will be determined in the next 10 years.\n", "  We propose a high-order finite difference weighted ENO (WENO) method for the\nideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations. The proposed method is\nsingle-stage, single-step, maintains a discrete divergence-free condition on\nthe magnetic field, and has the capacity to preserve the positivity of the\ndensity and pressure. To accomplish this, we use a Taylor discretization of the\nPicard integral formulation (PIF) of the finite difference WENO method proposed\nin [SINUM, 53 (2015), pp. 1833--1856], where the focus is on a high-order\ndiscretization of the fluxes (as opposed to the conserved variables). We use\nthe version where fluxes are expanded to third-order accuracy in time, and for\nthe fluid variables space is discretized using the classical fifth-order finite\ndifference WENO discretization. We use constrained transport in order to obtain\ndivergence-free magnetic fields, which means that we simultaneously evolve the\nmagnetohydrodynamic and magnetic potential equations, and set the magnetic\nfield to be the (discrete) curl of the magnetic potential after each time step.\nIn this work, we compute these curls to fourth-order accuracy. In order to\nretain a single-stage, single-step method, we develop a novel Lax-Wendroff\ndiscretization for the evolution of the magnetic potential, where we start with\ntechnology used for Hamilton-Jacobi equations in order to construct a\nnon-oscillatory magnetic field. Positivity preservation is realized by\nintroducing a parameterized flux limiter that considers a linear combination of\nhigh and low-order numerical fluxes. This positivity limiter lacks energy\nconservation. However, this limiter can be dropped for problems where the\npressure does not become negative. We present two and three dimensional\nnumerical results for several standard test problems. These results assert the\nrobustness and verify the high-order of accuracy of the proposed scheme.\n", "  We present an approach for exponentially enhancing the single-photon coupling\nstrength in an optomechanical system using only additional linear resources. It\nallows one to reach the quantum nonlinear regime of optomechanics, where\nnonlinear effects are observed at the single photon level, even if the bare\ncoupling strength is much smaller than the mechanical frequency and cavity\ndamping rate. Our method is based on using a large amplitude, strongly detuned\nmechanical parametric drive to amplify mechanical zero-point fluctuations and\nhence enhance the radiation pressure interaction. It has the further benefit of\nallowing time-dependent control, enabling pulsed schemes. For a two-cavity\noptomechanical setup, we show that our scheme generates photon blockade for\nexperimentally accessible parameters, and even makes the production of photonic\nstates with negative Wigner functions possible. We discuss how our method is an\nexample of a more general strategy for enhancing boson-mediated two-particle\ninteractions and nonlinearities.\n", "  We ask to what extent are the higher-derivative corrections of string theory\nconstrained by T-duality. The seminal early work by Meissner tests T-duality by\nreduction to one dimension using a distinguished choice of field variables in\nwhich the bosonic string action takes a Gauss-Bonnet-type form. By analyzing\nall field redefinitions that may or may not be duality covariant and may or may\nnot be gauge covariant we extend the procedure to test T-duality starting from\nan action expressed in arbitrary field variables. We illustrate the method by\nshowing that it determines uniquely the first-order $\\alpha'$ corrections of\nthe bosonic string, up to terms that vanish in one dimension. We also use the\nmethod to glean information about the ${\\cal O}(\\alpha'^2)$ corrections in the\ndouble field theory with Green-Schwarz deformation.\n", "  The scattering of electrons off nuclei is one of the best methods of probing\nnuclear structure. In this paper we focus on electron scattering off nuclei\nwith spin and isospin zero within the Skyrme model. We consider two distinct\nmethods and simplify our calculations by use of the Born approximation. The\nfirst method is to calculate the form factor of the spherically averaged\nSkyrmion charge density; the second uses the Patterson function to calculate\nthe scattering intensity off randomly oriented Skyrmions, and spherically\naverages at the end. We compare our findings with experimental scattering data.\nWe also find approximate analytical formulae for the first zero and first\nstationary point of a form factor.\n", "  Emission from high-$z$ galaxies must unquestionably contribute to the\nnear-infrared background (NIRB). However, this contribution has so far proven\ndifficult to isolate even after subtracting the resolved galaxies to deep\nlevels. Remaining NIRB fluctuations are dominated by unresolved low-$z$\ngalaxies on small angular scales, and by an unidentified component with unclear\norigin on large scales ($\\approx 1000''$). In this paper, by analyzing mock\nmaps generated from semi-numerical simulations and empirically determined\n$L_{\\rm UV} - M_{\\rm h}$ relations, we find that fluctuations associated with\ngalaxies at $5 < z < 10$ amount to several percent of the unresolved NIRB flux\nfluctuations. We investigate the properties of this component for different\nsurvey areas and limiting magnitudes. In all cases, we show that this signal\ncan be efficiently, and most easily at small angular scales, isolated by\ncross-correlating the source-subtracted NIRB with Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs)\ndetected in the same field by {\\tt HST} surveys. This result provides a fresh\ninsight into the properties of reionization sources.\n", "  We consider dissipation in a recently proposed nonlinear Klein-Gordon\ndynamics that admits soliton-like solutions of the power-law form\n$e_q^{i(kx-wt)}$, involving the $q$-exponential function naturally arising\nwithin the nonextensive thermostatistics [$e_q^z \\equiv [1+(1-q)z]^{1/(1-q)}$,\nwith $e_1^z=e^z$]. These basic solutions behave like free particles, complying,\nfor all values of $q$, with the de Broglie-Einstein relations $p=\\hbar k$,\n$E=\\hbar \\omega$ and satisfying a dispersion law corresponding to the\nrelativistic energy-momentum relation $E^2 = c^2p^2 + m^2c^4 $. The dissipative\neffects explored here are described by an evolution equation that can be\nregarded as a nonlinear version of the celebrated telegraphists equation,\nunifying within one single theoretical framework the nonlinear Klein-Gordon\nequation, a nonlinear Schroedinger equation, and the power-law diffusion\n(porous media) equation. The associated dynamics exhibits physically appealing\nsoliton-like traveling solutions of the $q$-plane wave form with a complex\nfrequency $\\omega$ and a $q$-Gaussian square modulus profile.\n", "  We discuss phase-locking phenomena at low-level of quanta for parametrically\ndriven nonlinear Kerr resonator (PDNR) in strong quantum regime. Oscillatory\nmode of PDNR is created in the process of a degenerate down-conversion of\nphotons under interaction with a train of external Gaussian pulses. We\ncalculate the Wigner functions of cavity mode showing two-fold symmetry in\nphase space and analyse formation of phase-locked states in the regular as well\nas the quantum chaotic regime.\n", "  We introduce a class of causal manifolds which contains the globally\nhyperbolic spacetimes and we prove global propagation theorems for sheaves on\nsuch manifolds. As an application, we solve globally the Cauchy problem for\nhyperfunction solutions of hyperbolic systems.\n", "  We present direct numerical simulations of Taylor-Couette flow with grooved\nwalls at a fixed radius ratio $\\eta=r_i/r_o=0.714$ with inner cylinder Reynolds\nnumber up to $Re_i=3.76\\times10^4$, corresponding to Taylor number up to\n$Ta=2.15\\times10^9$. The grooves are axisymmetric V-shaped obstacles attached\nto the wall with a tip angle of $90^\\circ$. Results are compared to the smooth\nwall case in order to investigate the effects of grooves on Taylor-Couette\nflow. We focus on the effective scaling laws for the torque, flow structures,\nand boundary layers. It is found that, when the groove height is smaller than\nthe boundary layer thickness, the torque is the same as that of the smooth wall\ncases. With increasing $Ta$, the boundary layer thickness becomes smaller than\nthe groove height. Plumes are ejected from the tips of the grooves and\nsecondary circulations between the latter are formed. This is associated to a\nsharp increase of the torque and thus the effective scaling law for the torque\nvs. $Ta$ becomes much steeper. Further increasing $Ta$ does not result in an\nadditional slope increase. Instead, the effective scaling law saturates to the\n\"ultimate\" regime effective exponents seen for smooth walls. It is found that\neven though after saturation the slope is the same as for the smooth wall case,\nthe absolute value of torque is increased, and the more the larger size of the\ngrooves.\n", "  High formal valence Os-based double perovskites are a focus of current\ninterest because they display strong interplay of large spin orbit coupling and\nstrong electronic correlation. Here we present the electronic and magnetic\ncharacteristics of a sequence of three cubic Os based double perovskites\nBa$_{2}$$A$OsO$_{6}$, ($A=$Na, Ca, Y), with formal valences (charge states) of\nOs$^{+7}~(d^{1})$, Os$^{+6}(d^{2})$, Os$^{+5}(d^{3})$. For these first\nprinciples based calculations we apply an ``exact exchange for correlated\nelectrons'' functional, with exact exchange applied in a hybrid fashion solely\nto the Os($5d$) states. While Ba$_{2}$NaOsO$_{6}$ is a ferromagnetic Dirac-Mott\ninsulator studied previously, the other two show antiferromagnetic ordering\nwhile all retain the cubic (undistorted) structure. For comparison purposes we\nhave investigated only the ferromagnetic ordered phase. A metal-insulator\ntransition is predicted to occur upon rotating the direction of magnetization\nin all three materials, reflecting the central role of spin orbit coupling in\nthese small gap osmates. Surprises arising from comparing formal charge states\nwith the radial charge densities are discussed. Chemical shielding factors and\norbital susceptibilities are provided for comparison with future nuclear\nmagnetic resonance data.\n", "  By using the dimension-free Harnack inequality and the integration by parts\nformula for the associated diffusion semigroup, we prove the central limit\ntheorem, the moderate deviation principle, and the logarithmic iteration law\nfor the sample entropy production rate of stochastic differential equations\nwith Lipschitz continuous and dissipative drifts.\n", "  A wide range of natural and engineered phenomena rely on large networks of\ninteracting units to reach a dynamical consensus state where the system\ncollectively operates. Here we study the dynamics of self-organizing systems\nand show that for generic directed networks the collective frequency of the\nensemble is {\\it not} the same as the mean of the individuals' natural\nfrequencies. Specifically, we show that the collective frequency equals a\nweighted average of the natural frequencies, where the weights are given by an\nout-flow centrality measure that is equivalent to a reverse PageRank\ncentrality. Our findings uncover an intricate dependence of the collective\nfrequency on both the structural directedness and dynamical heterogeneity of\nthe network, and also reveal an unexplored connection between synchronization\nand PageRank, which opens the possibility of applying PageRank optimization to\nsynchronization. Finally, we demonstrate the presence of collective frequency\nvariation in real-world networks by considering the UK and Scandinavian power\ngrids.\n", "  It has been recently claimed that radio observations of nearby spiral\ngalaxies essentially rule out a dark matter source for the galactic haze. Here\nwe consider the low energy thermal emission from a quark nugget dark matter\nmodel in the context of microwave emission from the galactic centre and radio\nobservations of nearby Milky Way like galaxies. We demonstrate that observed\nemission levels do not strongly constrain this specific dark matter candidate\nacross a broad range of the allowed parameter space in drastic contrast with\nconventional dark matter models based on the WIMP paradigm.\n", "  We show that the Quantum Spectral Curve (QSC) formalism, initially formulated\nfor the spectrum of anomalous dimensions of all local single trace operators in\nN=4 SYM, can be extended to the generalized cusp anomalous dimension for all\nvalues of the parameters. We find that the large spectral parameter asymptotics\nand some analyticity properties have to be modified, but the functional\nrelations are unchanged. As a demonstration, we find an all-loop analytic\nexpression for the first two nontrivial terms in the small |phi \\pm theta|\nexpansion. We also present nonperturbative numerical results at generic angles\nwhich match perfectly 4-loop perturbation theory and the classical string\nprediction.\n  The reformulation of the problem in terms of the QSC opens the possibility to\nexplore many open questions. We attach to this paper several Mathematica\nnotebooks which should facilitate future studies.\n", "  We present analysis of observations of CO2 and OI emission in three comets to\nmeasure the CO2 abundance and evaluate the possibility of employing\nobservations of OI emission in comets as a proxy for CO2. We obtained NIR\nimaging sensitive to CO2 of comets C/2012 K1 (PanSTARRS), C/2012 K5 (LINEAR),\nand 290P/Jager with the IRAC instrument on Spitzer. We acquired observations of\nOI emission in these comets with the ARCES echelle spectrometer mounted on the\n3.5-meter telescope at Apache Point Observatory and observations of OH with the\nSwift observatory (PanSTARRS) and with Keck HIRES (Jager). The CO2/H2O ratios\nderived from the Spitzer images are 12.6 +/- 1.3% (PanSTARRS), 28.9 +/- 3.6%\n(LINEAR), and 31.3 +/- 4.2% (Jager). These abundances are derived under the\nassumption that contamination from CO emission is negligible. The CO2 abundance\nfor PanSTARRS is close to the average abundance measured in comets at similar\nheliocentric distance to date, while the abundances measured for LINEAR and\nJager are significantly larger than the average abundance. From the coma\nmorphology observed in PanSTARRS and the assumed gas expansion velocity, we\nderive a rotation period for the nucleus of about 9.2 hours. Comparison of H2O\nproduction rates derived from ARCES and Swift data, as well as other\nobservations, suggest the possibility of sublimation from icy grains in the\ninner coma. We evaluate the possibility that the OI emission can be employed as\na proxy for CO2 by comparing CO2/H2O ratios inferred from the OI lines to those\nmeasured directly by Spitzer. We find that for PanSTARRS we can reproduce the\nobserved CO2 abundance to an accuracy of ~20%. For LINEAR and Jager, we were\nonly able to obtain upper limits on the CO2 abundance inferred from the OI\nlines. These upper limits are consistent with the CO2 abundances measured by\nSpitzer.\n", "  The coherent electronic transport phenomena through quantum devices is\ndifficult to observe due to thermal smearing and dephasing, the latter induced\nby inelastic scattering by phonons or impurities. In other wave systems, the\ntemperature and dephasing may not destroy the coherence and can then be used to\nobserve the underlying wave behaviour of the coherent quantum phenomena. Here,\nwe observe coherent transmission of mechanical waves through a two-dimensional\nelastic Sinai billiard with two waveguides. The flexural-wave transmission\nperformed by non-contact means, shows the transmission quantization when a new\nmode becomes open. In contrast with the quantum counterpart, these measurements\nagree with the theoretical predictions of the simplest model at zero\ntemperature highlighting the universal character of the transmission\nfluctuations.\n", "  In this work we explore for the first time the applicability of using\n$\\gamma$-ray imaging in neutron capture measurements to identify and suppress\nspatially localized background. For this aim, a pinhole gamma camera is\nassembled, tested and characterized in terms of energy and spatial performance.\nIt consists of a monolithic CeBr$_3$ scintillating crystal coupled to a\nposition-sensitive photomultiplier and readout through an integrated circuit\nAMIC2GR. The pinhole collimator is a massive carven block of lead. A series of\ndedicated measurements with calibrated sources and with a neutron beam incident\non a $^{197}$Au sample have been carried out at n_TOF, achieving an enhancement\nof a factor of two in the signal-to-background ratio when selecting only those\nevents coming from the direction of the sample.\n", "  We systematically compute the annihilation rate for winos and higgsinos into\nthe final state relevant for indirect detection experiments, gamma + X. The\nradiative corrections to this process receive enhancement from the large\nBloch-Nordsieck-Violating Sudakov logarithm, log(2 M_chi/M_W). We resum the\ndouble logs and include single logs to fixed order using a formalism that\ncombines nonrelativistic and soft-collinear effective field theories. For the\nwino case, we update an earlier exclusion adapting results of the HESS\nexperiment. At the thermal relic mass of 3 TeV, LL' corrections result in a\n~30% reduction in rate relative to LL. Nonetheless, single logs do not save the\nwino, and it is still excluded by an order of magnitude. Experimental cuts\nproduce an endpoint region which, our results show, significantly effects the\nhiggsino rate at its thermal-relic mass near 1 TeV and is deserving of further\nstudy.\n", "  We suggest that the \"Big Bang\" may be a result of the first-order phase\ntransition driven by changing scalar curvature of the 4D space-time in\nexpanding cold Universe, filled with nonlinear scalar field $\\phi $ and neutral\nmatter with equation of state $p=\\nu \\varepsilon $ (where $p$ and $\\varepsilon\n$ are pressure and energy density of matter). We consider a Lagrangian for\nscalar field in curved space-time with nonlinearity $\\phi ^{4} $, which along\nwith the quadratic term $-\\xi R\\left|\\phi \\right|^{2} $ (where $\\xi $ is the\ninteraction constant and $R$ is scalar curvature) contains a term $\\sim \\xi\nR\\left(\\phi +\\phi ^{+} \\right)$ linear in $\\phi $. Due to this term the\ncondition for the extrema of the potential energy of scalar field is given by a\ncubic equation. Provided $\\nu > 1/3$ the scalar curvature $R=[\\kappa (3\\nu\n-1)\\varepsilon -4\\Lambda ]$ (where $\\kappa $ and $\\Lambda $ are Einstein's\ngravitational and cosmological constants) decreases along with decreasing\n$\\varepsilon $ in the process of the Universe's expansion, and at some critical\nvalue $R_{c} < 0$ a first-order phase transition occurs, induced by an\n\"external field\" parameter proportional to $R$. Given certain conditions the\ncritical radius of the early Universe at the point of the first-order phase\ntransition may reach arbitrary large values, so this scenario of unrestricted\n\"inflation\" of the Universe may be called \"hyperinflation\". Beyond the point of\nphase transition the system is rolling down into the potential minimum with the\nrelease of the potential energy of scalar field, accompanied by oscillations of\nits amplitude $\\phi $. The powerful heating of the Universe in the course of\nattenuation of these oscillations plays the role of \"Big Bang\".\n", "  In the context of a renormalizable supersymmetric SO(10) Grand Unified\nTheory, we consider the fermion mass matrices generated by the Yukawa couplings\nto a $\\mathbf{10} \\oplus \\mathbf{120} \\oplus \\bar{\\mathbf{126}}$ representation\nof scalars. We perform a complete investigation of the possibilities of\nimposing flavour symmetries in this scenario; the purpose is to reduce the\nnumber of Yukawa coupling constants in order to identify potentially predictive\nmodels. We have found that there are only 14 inequivalent cases of Yukawa\ncoupling matrices, out of which 13 cases are generated by $Z_n$ symmetries,\nwith suitable $n$, and one case is generated by a $Z_2 \\times Z_2$ symmetry. A\nnumerical analysis of the 14 cases reveals that only two of them---dubbed A and\nB in the present paper---allow good fits to the experimentally known fermion\nmasses and mixings.\n", "  Results on two-particle angular correlations for charged particles produced\nin pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV are presented. The data\nwere taken with the CMS detector at the LHC and correspond to an integrated\nluminosity of about 270 inverse nanobarns. The correlations are studied over a\nbroad range of pseudorapidity (abs(eta) < 2.4) and over the full azimuth (phi)\nas a function of charged particle multiplicity and transverse momentum (pt). In\nhigh-multiplicity events, a long-range (abs(Delta eta) > 2.0), near-side (Delta\nphi approximately 0) structure emerges in the two-particle Delta eta-Delta phi\ncorrelation functions. The magnitude of the correlation exhibits a pronounced\nmaximum in the range 1.0 < pt < 2.0 GeV/c and an approximately linear increase\nwith the charged particle multiplicity, with an overall correlation strength\nsimilar to that found in earlier pp data at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV. The present\nmeasurement extends the study of near-side long-range correlations up to\ncharged particle multiplicities of N[ch] approximately 180, a region so far\nunexplored in pp collisions. The observed long-range correlations are compared\nto those seen in pp, pPb, and PbPb collisions at lower collision energies.\n", "  We study Yang-Baxter sigma models with deformed 4D Minkowski spacetimes\narising from classical $r$-matrices associated with $\\kappa$-deformations of\nthe Poincar\\'e algebra. These classical $\\kappa$-Poincar\\'e $r$-matrices\ndescribe three kinds of deformations: 1) the standard deformation, 2) the\ntachyonic deformation, and 3) the light-cone deformation. For each deformation,\nthe metric and two-form $B$-field are computed from the associated $r$-matrix.\nThe first two deformations, related to the modified classical Yang-Baxter\nequation, lead to T-duals of dS$_4$ and AdS$_4$\\,, respectively. The third\ndeformation, associated with the homogeneous classical Yang-Baxter equation,\nleads to a time-dependent pp-wave background. Finally, we construct a Lax pair\nfor the generalized $\\kappa$-Poincar\\'e $r$-matrix that unifies the three kinds\nof deformations mentioned above as special cases.\n", "  In a recent detailed research program we proposed to study the complex\nphysics of topological phases by an all optical implementation of a\ndiscrete-time quantum walk. The main novel ingredient proposed for this study\nis the use of non-linear parametric amplifiers in the network which could in\nturn be used to emulate intra-atomic interactions and thus analyze many-body\neffects in topological phases even when using light as the quantum walker. In\nthis paper, and as a first step towards the implementation of our scheme, we\nanalize the interplay between quantum walk lattice topology and spatial\ncorrelations of bi-photons produced by spontaneous parametric down-conversion.\nWe also describe different detection methods suitable for our proposed\nexperimental scheme.\n", "  The Loschmidt echo is a measure of quantum irreversibility and is determined\nby the fidelity amplitude of an imperfect time-reversal protocol. Fidelity\namplitude plays an important role both in the foundations of quantum mechanics\nand its applications, such as time-resolved electronic spectroscopy. We derive\nan exact path integral formula for the fidelity amplitude and use it to obtain\na series of increasingly accurate semiclassical approximations by truncating an\nexact expansion of the path integral exponent. While the zeroth-order expansion\nresults in a remarkably simple, yet nontrivial approximation for the fidelity\namplitude, the first-order expansion yields an alternative derivation of the\nso-called \"dephasing representation\", circumventing the use of semiclassical\npropagator as in the original derivation. We also obtain approximate expression\nfor fidelity based on the second-order expansion, which resolves several\nshortcomings of the dephasing representation. The rigorous derivation from the\npath integral permits the identification of sufficient conditions under which\nvarious approximations obtained become exact.\n", "  We develop a new approach to extracting model-independent information from\nobservations of strong gravitational lenses. The approach is based on the\ngeneric properties of images near the fold and cusp catastrophes in caustics\nand critical curves. Observables used are the relative image positions, the\nmagnification ratios and ellipticities of extended images, and time delays\nbetween images with temporally varying intensity. We show how these observables\nconstrain derivatives and ratios of derivatives of the lensing potential near a\ncritical curve. Based on these measured properties of the lensing potential,\nclasses of parametric lens models can then easily be restricted to such\nparameter values compatible with the measurements, thus allowing fast scans of\nlarge varieties of models. Applying our approach to a representative galaxy\n(JVAS B1422+231) and a galaxy-cluster lens (MACS J1149.5+2223), we show which\nmodel-independent information can be extracted in those cases and demonstrate\nthat the parameters obtained by our approach for known parametric lens models\nagree well with those found by detailed model fitting.\n", "  We present a model for multi-wavelength mixing in semiconductor optical\namplifiers (SOAs) based on coupled-mode equations. The proposed model applies\nto all kinds of SOA structures, takes into account the longitudinal dependence\nof carrier density caused by saturation, it accommodates an arbitrary\nfunctional dependencies of the material gain and carrier recombination rate on\nthe local value of carrier density, and is computationally more efficient by\norders of magnitude as compared with the standard full model based on\nspace-time equations. We apply the coupled-mode equations model to a recently\ndemonstrated phase-sensitive amplifier based on an integrated SOA and prove its\nresults to be consistent with the experimental data. The accuracy of the\nproposed model is certified by means of a meticulous comparison with the\nresults obtained by integrating the space-time equations.\n", "  We analyze the dynamics of weakly coupled finite temperature $U(N)$ gauge\ntheories on $S^3$ by studying a class of effective unitary matrix model.\nSolving Dyson-Schwinger equation at large $N$, we find that different phases of\ngauge theories are characterized by gaps in eigenvalue distribution over a unit\ncircle. In particular, we obtain no-gap, one-gap and two-gap solutions at large\n$N$ for a class of matrix model we are considering. The same effective matrix\nmodel can equivalently be written as a sum over representations (or Young\ndiagrams) of unitary group. We show that at large $N$, Young diagrams\ncorresponding to different phases can be classified in terms of discontinuities\nin number of boxes in two consecutive rows. More precisely, the representation,\nwhere there is no discontinuity, corresponds to no-gap and one-gap solution,\nwhere as, a diagram with one discontinuity corresponds to two-gap phase,\nmentioned above. This observation allows us to write a one to one relation\nbetween eigenvalue distribution function and Young tableaux distribution\nfunction for each saddle point, in particular for two-gap solution. We find\nthat all the saddle points can be described in terms of free fermions with a\nphase space distribution for no-gap, one-gap and two-gap phases.\n", "  Compressing a porous material will decrease the volume of the pore space,\ndriving fluid out. Similarly, injecting fluid into a porous material can expand\nthe pore space, distorting the solid skeleton. This poromechanical coupling has\napplications ranging from tissue mechanics to hydrogeology. The classical\ntheory of linear poroelasticity captures this coupling by combining Darcy's law\nwith Terzaghi's effective stress and linear elasticity in a linearized\nkinematic framework. Linear poroelasticity is a good model for very small\ndeformations, but it becomes increasingly inappropriate for moderate to large\ndeformations, which are common in the context of phenomena such as swelling and\ndamage, and for soft materials such as gels and tissues. The well-known theory\nof large-deformation poroelasticity combines Darcy's law with Terzaghi's\neffective stress and nonlinear elasticity in a rigorous kinematic framework.\nThis theory has been used extensively in biomechanics to model large elastic\ndeformations in soft tissues, and in geomechanics to model large elastoplastic\ndeformations in soils. Here, we first provide an overview and discussion of\nthis theory with an emphasis on the physics of poromechanical coupling. We\npresent the large-deformation theory in an Eulerian framework to minimize the\nmathematical complexity, and we show how this nonlinear theory simplifies to\nlinear poroelasticity under the assumption of small strain. We then compare the\npredictions of linear poroelasticity with those of large-deformation\nporoelasticity in the context of two uniaxial model problems: Fluid outflow\ndriven by an applied mechanical load (the consolidation problem) and\ncompression driven by a steady fluid throughflow. We use these problems to\nexplore the steady and dynamical errors associated with the linear model in\nboth situations, as well as the impact of introducing a deformation-dependent\npermeability.\n", "  We consider periodically-driven arrays of weakly coupled wires with\nconduction and valence bands of Rashba type and study the resulting Floquet\nstates. This non-equilibrium system can be tuned into non-trivial phases such\nas of topological insulators, Weyl semimetals, and dispersionless zero-energy\nedge mode regimes. In the presence of strong electron-electron interactions, we\ngeneralize these regimes to the fractional case, where elementary excitations\nhave fractional charges $e/m$ with $m$ being an odd integer.\n", "  Effective and controlled drug delivery systems with on-demand release and\ntargeting abilities have received enormous attention for biomedical\napplications. Here, we describe a novel enzyme-based cap system for mesoporous\nsilica nanoparticles (MSNs) that is directly combined with a targeting ligand\nvia bio-orthogonal click chemistry. The capping system is based on the\npH-responsive binding of an aryl-sulfonamide-functionalized MSN and the enzyme\ncarbonic anhydrase (CA). An unnatural amino acid (UAA) containing a norbornene\nmoiety was genetically incorporated into CA. This UAA allowed for the\nsite-specific bio-orthogonal attachment of even very sensitive targeting\nligands such as folic acid and anandamide. This leads to specific\nreceptor-mediated cell and stem cell uptake. We demonstrate the successful\ndelivery and release of the chemotherapeutic agent Actinomycin D to KB cells.\nThis novel nanocarrier concept provides a promising platform for the\ndevelopment of precisely controllable and highly modular theranostic systems.\n", "  We present a systematic study of the non-thermal electron-proton plasma and\nits emission processes in starburst galaxies in order to explain the\ncorrelation between the luminosity in the radio band and the recently observed\ngamma luminosity. In doing so, a steady state description of the cosmic ray\nelectrons and protons within the spatially homogeneous starburst is considered\nwhere continuous momentum losses are included as well as catastrophic losses\ndue to diffusion and advection. The primary source of the relativistic cosmic\nrays, e.g. supernova remnants, provides a quasi-neutral plasma with a power law\nspectrum in momentum where we account for rigidity dependent differences\nbetween the electron and proton spectrum. We examine the resulting leptonic and\nhadronic radiation processes by synchrotron radiation, inverse Compton\nscattering, Bremsstrahlung and hadronic pion production. Finally, the\nobservations of NGC 253, M82, NGC 4945 and NGC 1068 in the radio and gamma-ray\nband as well as the observed supernova rate are used to constrain a best-fit\nmodel. In the case of NGC 253, M82, NGC 4945 our model is able to accurately\ndescribe the data, showing that: (i) Supernovae are the dominant particle\naccelerators for NGC 253, M82 and NGC 4945, but not in the case of NGC 1068.\n(ii) All considered starburst galaxies are poor proton calorimeters in which\nfor NGC 253 the escape is predominantly driven by the galactic wind, whereas\nthe diffusive escape dominates in NGC 4945 and M82 (at energies > 1TeV). (iii)\nSecondary electrons from hadronic pion production are important to model the\nradio flux, but the associated neutrino flux is below the current observation\nlimit.\n", "  Two-Higgs-Doublet Models (2HDMs) are amongst the simplest extensions of the\nStandard Model. Such models allow for tree-level CP Violation (CPV) in the\nHiggs sector. We analyse a class of CPV 2HDM (of Type-I) in which only one of\nthe two Higgs doublets couples to quarks and leptons, avoiding dangerous\nFlavour Changing Neutral Currents. We provide an up to date and comprehensive\nanalysis of the constraints and Large Hadron Collider (LHC) predictions of such\na model. Of immediate interest to the LHC Run 2 is the golden channel where all\nthree neutral Higgs bosons are observed to decay into gauge boson pairs, $WW$\nand $ZZ$, providing a smoking gun signature of the CPV 2HDM.\n", "  This study focuses on hard diffractive events produced in proton-proton\ncollision at LHC exhibiting one intact proton in the final state which can be\ntagged by forward detectors. We report prospective results on the W boson\ncharge asymmetry measured for such events, which allow to constrain the quark\ndiffractive density functions in the Pomeron.\n", "  V-T theory is constructed in the many-body Hamiltonian formulation, and\ndiffers at the foundation from current liquid dynamics theories. In V-T theory\nthe liquid atomic motion consists of two contributions, normal mode vibrations\nin a single representative potential energy valley, and transits, which carry\nthe system across boundaries between valleys. The mean square displacement time\ncorrelation function (the MSD) is a direct measure of the atomic motion , and\nour goal is to determine if the V-T formalism can produce a physically sensible\naccount of this motion. We employ molecular dynamics (MD) data for a system\nrepresenting liquid Na, and find the motion evolves in three successive time\nintervals: On the first \"vibrational\" interval, the vibrational motion alone\ngives a highly accurate account of the MD data; on the second \"crossover\"\ninterval, the vibrational MSD saturates to a constant while the transit motion\nbuilds up from zero; on the third \"random walk\" interval, the transit motion\nproduces a purely diffusive random walk of the vibrational equilibrium\npositions. This motional evolution agrees with, and adds refinement to, the MSD\natomic motion as described by current liquid dynamics theories.\n", "  A parametric beam lattice model is formulated to analyse the propagation\nproperties of elastic in-plane waves in an auxetic material based on a\nhexachiral topology of the periodic cell, equipped with inertial local\nresonators. The Floquet-Bloch boundary conditions are imposed on a reduced\norder linear model in the only dynamically active degrees-offreedom. Since the\nresonators can be designed to open and shift band gaps, an optimal design,\nfocused on the largest possible gap in the low-frequency range, is achieved by\nsolving a maximization problem in the bounded space of the significant\ngeometrical and mechanical parameters. A local optimized solution, for a the\nlowest pair of consecutive dispersion curves, is found by employing the\nglobally convergent version of the Method of Moving asymptotes, combined with\nMonte Carlo and quasi-Monte Carlo multi-start techniques.\n", "  We introduce the computer program MPL for computations with homotopy\ninvariant iterated integrals on moduli spaces $\\mathcal{M}_{0,n}$ of curves of\ngenus 0 with $n$ ordered marked points. The program is an implementation of the\nalgorithms presented in [13], based on Maple. It includes the symbol map and\nprocedures for the analytic computation of period integrals on\n$\\mathcal{M}_{0,n}.$ It supports the automated computation of a certain class\nof Feynman integrals.\n", "  Modeling a nonlinear anisotropic magnetodielectric medium with\nspatial-temporal dispersion by two continuum collections of three dimensional\nharmonic oscillators, a fully canonical quantization of the electromagnetic\nfield is demonstrated in the presence of such a medium. Some coupling tensors\nof various ranks are introduced that couple the magnetodielectric medium with\nthe electromagnetic field. The polarization and magnetization fields of the\nmedium are defined in terms of the coupling tensors and the oscillators\nmodeling the medium. The electric and magnetic susceptibility tensors of the\nmedium are obtained in terms of the coupling tensors. It is shown that the\nelectric field satisfy an integral equation in frequency domain. The integral\nequation is solved by an iteration method and the electric field is found up to\nan arbitrary accuracy.\n", "  The interplay of electricity and magnetism, one of the cornerstones of modern\nphysics, takes a special form in solids in such phenomena as magnetoelectricity\nand the possibility of multiferroic behaviour. In this paper I give a short\nsurvey of the main notions of this field, paying special attention to\nmicroscopic aspects. Some related phenomena, such as electric activity of\nmagnetic domain walls, etc., are also shortly discussed.\n", "  We have determined the detailed star formation history and total mass of the\nglobular clusters in the Fornax dwarf spheroidal using archival HST WFPC2 data.\nColour magnitude diagrams are constructed in the F555W and F814W bands and\ncorrected for the effect of Fornax field star contamination, after which we use\nthe routine Talos to derive the quantitative star formation history as a\nfunction of age and metallicity. The star formation history of the Fornax\nglobular clusters shows that Fornax 1, 2, 3 and 5 are all dominated by ancient\n(>10 Gyr) populations. Cluster Fornax 1,2 and 3 display metallicities as low as\n[Fe/H]=-2.5 while Fornax 5 is slightly more metal-rich at [Fe/H]=-1.8,\nconsistent with resolved and unresolved metallicity tracers. Conversely, Fornax\n4 is dominated by a more metal-rich~([Fe/H]=-1.2) and younger population at 10\nGyr, inconsistent with the other clusters. A lack of stellar populations\noverlapping with the main body of Fornax argues against the nucleus cluster\nscenario for Fornax 4. The combined stellar mass in globular clusters as\nderived from the SFH is (9.57$\\pm$0.93)$\\times$10$^{5}$ M$_{\\odot}$ which\ncorresponds to 2.5$\\pm$0.2 percent of the total stellar mass in Fornax. The\nmass of the four most metal-poor clusters can be further compared to the\nmetal-poor Fornax field to yield a mass fraction of 19.6$\\pm$3.1 percent.\nTherefore, the SFH results provide separate supporting evidence for the\nunusually high mass fraction of the GCs compared to the Fornax field\npopulation.\n", "  A systematic nonperturbative scheme is implemented to calculate the ground\nstate energy for a wide class of strongly correlated fermion models. The scheme\nincludes: (a) method of automatic calculations of the cumulants of the model\nHamiltonian; (b) method of the ground state energy calculation from these\ncumulants using the $t$-expansion proposed by Horn and Weinstein [Phys. Rev. D\n\\textbf{30}, 1256 (1984)] with new procedure of its extrapolation to\n$t\\rightarrow\\infty$. As an example of application of the method all cumulants\nup to the 8-th order for spinless fermion model are calculated exactly, and\nconverging sequences of approximations to the ground state energy are obtained\nfor one-, two- and three-dimensional versions of the model.\n", "  Stochastic density functional theory is applied to analyze the conductivity\nof strong two species electrolytes at arbitrary field strengths. The\ncorresponding stochastic equations for the density of the electrolyte species\nare solved by linearizing them about the mean density of ionic species,\nyielding an effective Gaussian theory. The non-equilibrium density-density\ncorrelation functions are computed and the conductivity of the electrolyte is\ndeduced. In the bulk, our results give a simple derivation of the results of\nOnsager and coworkers who used very different methods. The method developed\nhere can also be used to study electrolytes confined in one and two dimensions\nand interacting via either the three dimensional Coulomb interaction or the\nCoulomb interaction corresponding to that dimension of space.\n", "  Properties of thin films of geometrically frustrated ABC stacked\nantiferromagnetic kagome layers are examined using Metropolis Monte Carlo\nsimulations. The impact of having an easy-axis anisotropy on the surface layers\nand cubic anisotropy in the interior layers is explored. The spin structure at\nthe surface is shown to be different from that of the bulk 3D fcc system, where\nsurface axial anisotropy tends to align spins along the surface [111] normal\naxis. This alignment tendency then propagates only weakly to the interior\nlayers through exchange coupling. Results are shown for the specific heat,\nmagnetization and sub-lattice order parameters for both surface and interior\nspins in three and six layer films as a function of increasing axial surface\nanisotropy. Relevance to the exchange bias phenomenon in IrMn$_3$ thin films is\ndiscussed.\n", "  The $\\sun1$ WZW model is constructed on a n-sheeted branched torus, which\nallows the investigation of the R\\'enyi entropy for a single interval at finite\ntemperature. The small and large interval limits, as well as the low\ntemperature expansion are presented for this theory.\n", "  This article reports on a search for dark matter pair production in\nassociation with a Higgs boson decaying to a pair of bottom quarks, using data\nfrom $20.3 fb^{-1}$ of $pp$ collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV\ncollected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The decay of the Higgs boson is\nreconstructed as a high-momentum $b\\bar{b}$ system with either a pair of\nsmall-radius jets, or a single large-radius jet with substructure. The observed\ndata are found to be consistent with the expected Standard Model backgrounds.\nModel-independent upper limits are placed on the visible cross-sections for\nevents with a Higgs boson decaying into $b\\bar{b}$ and large missing transverse\nmomentum with thresholds ranging from 150 GeV to 400 GeV. Results are\ninterpreted using a simplified model with a $Z^\\prime$ gauge boson decaying\ninto different Higgs bosons predicted in a two-Higgs-doublet model, of which\nthe heavy pseudoscalar Higgs decays into a pair of dark matter particles.\nExclusion limits are also presented for the mass scales of various effective\nfield theory operators that describe the interaction between dark matter\nparticles and the Higgs boson.\n", "  We report a new version of fermion coupled coherent states method (FCCS-II)\nto simulate two-electron systems based on a self-symmetrized six-dimensional\n(6D) coherent states grid. Unlike the older fermion coupled coherent states\nmethod (FCCS-I), FCCS-II does not need any new equations in comparison with the\ncoupled coherent states method. FCCS-II uses a simpler and more efficient\napproach for symmetrizing the spatial wave function in the simulation of\nfermionic systems. This method, has significantly increased the speed of\ncomputations and give us the capability to simulate the quantum systems with\nthe larger CS grids. We apply FCCS-II to simulate the Helium atom and the\nHydrogen molecule based on grids with a large numbers of coherent states.\nFCCS-II with a relatively low number of CS gives a potential energy curve for\nH2 that is very close to the exact potential curve. Moreover, we have\nre-derived all the important equations of the FCCS-I method.\n", "  Artificial square spin ices are structures composed of magnetic elements\narranged on a geometrically frustrated lattice and located on the sites of a\ntwo-dimensional square lattice, such that there are four interacting magnetic\nelements at each vertex. Using a semi-analytical approach, we show that square\nspin ices exhibit a rich spin wave band structure that is tunable both by\nexternal magnetic fields and the configuration of individual elements. Internal\ndegrees of freedom can give rise to equilibrium states with bent magnetization\nat the edges leading to characteristic excitations; in the presence of\nmagnetostatic interactions these form separate bands analogous to impurity\nbands in semiconductors. Full-scale micromagnetic simulations corroborate our\nsemi-analytical approach. Our results show that artificial square spin ices can\nbe viewed as reconfigurable and tunable magnonic crystals that can be used as\nmetamaterials for spin-wave-based applications at the nanoscale.\n", "  We address the electron transport characteristics in bulk half-Heusler alloys\nwith their compositions tuned to the borderline between topologically\nnontrivial semi-metallic and trivial semiconducting phases. The precise\nfirst-principles calculations based on the coherent potential approximation\n(CPA) reveal that all the studied systems exhibit sets of dispersionless\nimpurity-like resonant levels, with one of them being located right at the\nDirac point. By means of the Kubo formalism we reveal that the residual\nconductivity of these alloys is strongly suppressed by impurity scattering,\nwhereas the spin Hall conductivity exhibits a large value which is comparable\nto that of Pt, thereby leading to divergent spin Hall angles.\n", "  We present and test chemical models for three-dimensional hydrodynamical\nsimulations of galaxies. We explore the effect of changing key parameters such\nas metallicity, radiation and non-equilibrium versus equilibrium metal cooling\napproximations on the transition between the gas phases in the interstellar\nmedium. The microphysics is modelled by employing the public chemistry package\nKROME and the chemical networks have been tested to work in a wide range of\ndensities and temperatures. We describe a simple H/He network following the\nformation of H$_2$, and a more sophisticated network which includes metals.\nPhotochemistry, thermal processes, and different prescriptions for the H$_2$\ncatalysis on dust are presented and tested within a one-zone framework. The\nresulting network is made publicly available on the KROME webpage. We find that\nemploying an accurate treatment of the dust-related processes induces a faster\nHI--H$_2$ transition. In addition, we show when the equilibrium assumption for\nmetal cooling holds, and how a non-equilibrium approach affects the thermal\nevolution of the gas and the HII--HI transition. These models can be employed\nin any hydrodynamical code via an interface to KROME and can be applied to\ndifferent problems including isolated galaxies, cosmological simulations of\ngalaxy formation and evolution, supernova explosions in molecular clouds, and\nthe modelling of star-forming regions. The metal network can be used for a\ncomparison with observational data of CII 158 $\\mu$m emission both for\nhigh-redshift as well as for local galaxies.\n", "  We estimate the value of the survival probability for central exclusive\nproduction, in a model, which is based on the CGC/saturation approach. Hard and\nsoft processes are described in the same framework. At LHC energies, we obtain\na small value for the survival probability. The source of the small value, is\nthe impact parameter dependence of the hard amplitude. Our model has\nsuccessfully described a large body of soft data: elastic, inelastic and\ndiffractive cross sections,inclusive production and rapidity correlations, as\nwell as the $t$-dependence of deep inelastic diffractive production of vector\nmesons\n", "  Simultaneous laser locking of IR and UV lasers to a visible stabilized\nreference laser is demonstrated via a Fabry-Perot cavity. LabVIEW is used to\nanalyze the input and an internal PID algorithm converts the Fabry-Perot signal\nto an analog locking feedback signal. The locking program stabilized both\nlasers to a long term stability of better than 9 MHz, with a custom-built IR\nlaser undergoing significant improvement in frequency stabilization. The\nresults of this study demonstrate the viability of a simple\ncomputer-controlled, non temperature-stabilized Fabry-Perot locking scheme for\nour application, laser cooling of Ca+ ions, and its use in other applications\nwith similar modest frequency stabilization requirements.\n", "  We calculate the electromagnetic (EM) decay widths of the $B^{\\pm}_c(2S)$\nmeson, which is observed recently by the ATLAS Collaboration. The main EM decay\nchannels of this particle are $1{^3S_1}\\gamma$ and $1{P}\\gamma$, which, in\nliterature, are estimated to have the branching ratio of about $1/10$. In this\nwork, we get the partial decay widths: $\\Gamma(2{^1S_0}\\rightarrow\n1{^3S_1}\\gamma)=0.192$ keV, $\\Gamma(2{^1S_0}\\rightarrow 1{P_1}\\gamma) = 2.24$\nkeV and $\\Gamma(2{^1S_0}\\rightarrow 1{P_1^\\prime}\\gamma) = 11.4$ keV. In the\ncalculation, the instantaneous approximated Bethe-Salpeter method is used. For\nthe $P$-wave $B_c$ mesons, the wave functions are given by mixing the $^3P_1$\nand $^1P_1$ states. Within the Mandelstam formalism, the decay amplitude is\ngiven, which includes the relativistic corrections.\n", "  The new numerical approach that includes 1 to 2 mechanism is applied to\ndouble parton scattering (DPS) in W+dijet and Z+dijet final state production in\nproton-proton collisions at LHC. By using the underlying event (UE) simulation\nfrom a pythia 8 tune extracted in hadronic events, we show that, like in the\ncase of a four-jet final state, the inclusion of 1 to 2 mechanism improves the\ndescription of experimental data measured at 7 TeV. In addition, predictions\nfor proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 14 TeV are shown for\nDPS- and UE-sensitive observables.\n", "  Recent experimental results have emphasized two aspects of Tb2Ti2O7 which\nhave not been taken into account in previous attempts to construct theories of\nTb2Ti2O7: the role of small levels of structural disorder, which appears to\ncontrol the formation of a long-range ordered state of as yet unknown nature;\nand the importance of strong coupling between spin and lattice degrees of\nfreedom, which results in the hybridization of crystal field excitons and\ntransverse acoustic phonons. In this work we examine the juncture of these two\nphenomena and show that samples with strongly contrasting behavior vis-a-vis\nthe structural disorder (i.e. with and without the transition to the ordered\nstate), develop identical magnetoelastic coupling. We also show that the\ncomparison between single crystal and powder samples is more complicated than\npreviously thought - the correlation between lattice parameter (as a measure of\nsuperstoichiometric Tb$^{3+}$) and the existence of a specific heat peak, as\nobserved in powder samples, does not hold for single crystals.\n", "  The accuracy of calculations of atomic Rydberg excitations cannot be judged\nby the usual measures, such as mean unsigned errors of many transitions. We\nshow how to use quantum defect theory to (a) separate errors due to approximate\nionization potentials, (b) extract smooth quantum defects to compare with\nexperiment, and (c) quantify those defects with a few characteristic\nparameters. The particle-particle random phase approximation (pp-RPA) produces\nexcellent Rydberg transitions that are an order of magnitude more accurate than\nthose of time-dependent density functional theory with standard approximations.\nWe even extract reasonably accurate defects from the lithium Rydberg series,\ndespite the reference being open-shell. Our methodology can be applied to any\nRydberg series of excitations with 4 transitions or more to extract the\nunderlying threshold energy and characteristic quantum defect parameters. Our\npp-RPA results set a demanding challenge for other excitation methods to match.\n", "  The ${^3{\\rm He}}(\\alpha,\\gamma){^7{\\rm Be}}$ and ${^3{\\rm\nH}}(\\alpha,\\gamma){^7{\\rm Li}}$ astrophysical $S$ factors are calculated within\nthe no-core shell model with continuum using a renormalized chiral\nnucleon-nucleon interaction. The ${^3{\\rm He}}(\\alpha,\\gamma){^7{\\rm Be}}$\nastrophysical $S$ factors agree reasonably well with the experimental data\nwhile the ${^3{\\rm H}}(\\alpha,\\gamma){^7{\\rm Li}}$ ones are overestimated. The\nseven-nucleon bound and resonance states and the $\\alpha+{^3{\\rm He}}/{^3{\\rm\nH}}$ elastic scattering are also studied and compared with experiment. The\nlow-lying resonance properties are rather well reproduced by our approach. At\nlow energies, the $s$-wave phase shift, which is non-resonant, is\noverestimated.\n", "  In Alonso et al., JHEP 12 (2014) 034, the CP-even sector of the effective\nchiral Lagrangian for a generic composite Higgs model with a symmetric coset\nhas been constructed, up to four momenta. In this paper, the CP-odd couplings\nare studied within the same context. If only the Standard Model bosonic sources\nof custodial symmetry breaking are considered, then at most six independent\noperators form a basis. One of them is the weak-$\\theta$ term linked to\nnon-perturbative sources of CP viola- tion, while the others describe CP-odd\nperturbative couplings between the Standard Model gauge bosons and an\nHiggs-like scalar belonging to the Goldstone boson sector. The procedure is\nthen applied to three distinct exemplifying frameworks: the original\n$SU(5)/SO(5)$ Georgi-Kaplan model, the minimal custodial-preserving\n$SO(5)/SO(4)$ model and the minimal $SU(3)/(SU(2)\\times U(1))$ model, which\nintrinsically breaks cus- todial symmetry. Moreover, the projection of the\nhigh-energy electroweak effective theory to the low-energy chiral effective\nLagrangian for a dynamical Higgs is per- formed, uncovering strong relations\nbetween the operator coefficients and pinpointing the differences with the\nelementary Higgs scenario.\n", "  The production of charmonium in heavy-ion collisions is investigated based on\nBoltzmann-type transport model for charmonium evolution and langevin equation\nfor charm quark evolution. Charmonium suppression and regeneration in both\nquark-gluon plasma (QGP) and hadron phase are considered. Charm quarks are far\nfrom thermalization, and regeneration of charmonium in QGP and hadron gas is\nneglectable at SPS and FAIR. At peripheral collisions, charmonium suppression\nwith hadron gas explains the experimental data well. But at central collisions,\nadditional suppression from deconfined matter (QGP) is necessary for the data.\nThis means there should be QGP produced at central collisions, and no QGP\nproduced at peripheral collisions at SPS energy. Predictions are also made at\nFAIR $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=7.7$ GeV Au+Au collisions.\n", "  The D-term is, like mass and spin, a fundamental property related to the\nenergy-momentum tensor. Yet it is not known experimentally for any particle. In\nall theoretical studies so far the D-terms of various particles were found\nnegative. Early works gave rise to the assumption the negative sign could be\nrelated to stability. The emerging question is whether it is possible to find a\nfield-theoretical system with a positive D-term. To shed some light on this\nquestion we investigate Q-clouds, an extreme parametric limit in the Q-ball\nsystem. Q-clouds are classically unstable solutions which delocalize, spread\nout over all space forming an infinitely dilute gas of free quanta, and are\neven energetically unstable against tunneling to plane waves. In short, these\nextremely unstable field configurations provide an ideal candidate system for\nour purposes. By studying the energy-momentum tensor we show that at any stage\nof the Q-cloud limit one deals with perfectly well-defined and, when viewed in\nappropriately scaled coordinates, non-dissipating non-topological solitonic\nsolutions. We investigate in detail their properties, and find new physical\ninterpretations by observing that Q-clouds resemble BPS Skyrmions in certain\naspects, and correspond to universal non-perturbative solutions in (complex)\n|\\Phi|^4 theory. In particular, we show that also Q-cloud solutions have\nnegative D-terms. Our findings do not prove that D-terms must always be\nnegative. But they indicate that it is unlikely to realize a positive D-term in\na consistent physical system.\n", "  The Aharonov-Anandan phase is a description of the geometric nature in\nnon-adiabatic cyclic evolutions of quantum states. Here we report on a\nmeasurement of the Aharonov-Anandan phase in photonics. We consider a\ntime-independent quantum driven harmonic oscillator that is initially prepared\nat the vacuum state. We utilize evanescently coupled waveguides to realize this\nphysical model and achieve a measurement of the Aharonov-Anandan phase via\nintegrated interferometry.\n", "  The study shows how to define \"exactly\" the average ion charge $Z_{\\rm I}$ in\nthe electron-ion model for plasmas and liquid metals: this definition comes out\nof the condition that a plasma consisting of electrons and nuclei can be\ndescribed by the electron-ion model. Based on this definition of the average\nion charge, the Quantum Hyper-Netted Chain (QHNC) method takes account of the\nresonant-state contribution to the bound electrons to form an ion. On the other\nhand, Blenski and coworkers have derived a formula to determine the electron\ndensity $n_0$ in a plasma as an electron-ion mixture by using the variational\nmethod with help of the local density approximation. Without use of any\napproximation, we derived the formula determining the electron density in an\nextended form on the basis of the DF theory. This formula is shown to be valid\nalso for the QHNC method.\n", "  Low Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGAD) represent a remarkable advance in high\nenergy particle detection, since they provide a moderate increase (gain ~10) of\nthe collected charge, thus leading to a notable improvement of the\nsignal-to-noise ratio, which largely extends the possible application of\nSilicon detectors beyond their present working field. The optimum detection\nperformance requires a careful implementation of the multiplication junction,\nin order to obtain the desired gain on the read out signal, but also a proper\ndesign of the edge termination and the peripheral region, which prevents the\nLGAD detectors from premature breakdown and large leakage current. This work\ndeals with the critical technological aspects when optimising the LGAD\nstructure. The impact of several design strategies for the device periphery is\nevaluated with the aid of TCAD simulations, and compared with the experimental\nresults obtained from the first LGAD prototypes fabricated at the IMB-CNM clean\nroom. Solutions for the peripheral region improvement are also provided.\n", "  We describe the pure spinor string in the $AdS_5\\times S^5$ using\nunconstrained matrices first used by Roiban and Siegel for the Green-Schwarz\nsuperstring.\n", "  Perovskite bilayers with (111)-orientation combine a honeycomb lattice as a\nkey feature with the strongly correlated, multiorbital nature of electrons in\ntransition metal oxides. In a systematic DFT+$U$ study of (111)-oriented\n(La$X$O$_3$)$_2$/(LaAlO$_3$)$_4$ superlattices, we establish trends in the\nevolution of ground states versus band filling in (111)-oriented\n(La$X$O$_3$)$_2$/(LaAlO$_3$)$_4$ superlattices, with $X$ spanning the entire\n$3d$ transition metal series. The competition between local quasi-cubic and\nglobal triangular symmetry triggers unanticipated broken symmetry phases, with\nmechanisms ranging from Jahn-Teller distortions, to charge-, spin-, and\norbital-ordering. LaMnO$_3$, where spin-orbit coupling opens a sizable gap in\nthe Dirac-point Fermi surface, emerges as a topological Chern insulator.\n", "  We show that the Fokker Planck equation can be derived from a Hypergeometric\ndifferential equation. The same applies to a non linear generalization of such\nequation.\n", "  We experimentally test quantum contextuality of a single qutrit using NMR.\nThe contextuality inequalities based on nine observables developed by Kurzynski\net. al. are first reformulated in terms of traceless observables which can be\nmeasured in an NMR experiment. These inequalities reveal the contextuality of\nalmost all single-qutrit states. We demonstrate the violation of the inequality\non four different initial states of a spin-1 deuterium nucleus oriented in a\nliquid crystal matrix, and follow the violation as the states evolve in time.\nWe also describe and experimentally perform a single-shot test of contextuality\nfor a subclass of qutrit states whose density matrix is diagonal in the energy\nbasis.\n", "  Photoinduced carrier dynamics in a correlated electron system on a coupled\ntwo-leg ladder lattice are studied. The two-leg ladder Hubbard model is\nanalyzed by utilizing the exact diagonalization method based on the Lanczos\nalgorithm in finite size clusters. In order to reveal the transient carrier\ndynamics after photoirradiation, we calculate the low-energy components of the\nhole kinetic energy, the pair-field correlation function, the optical\nconductivity spectra and others. It is shown that the photoinduced\nmetallic-like state appears in a half filled Mott insulating state, while the\nlow-energy carrier motion is suppressed by photoirradiation in hole doped\nmetallic states. These photoinduced changes in electron dynamics are associated\nwith changes in the carrier-pair coherence, and are not attributed to a naive\nthermalization but to a ladder-lattice effect. Based on the numerical results,\noptical controls of hole pairs by using the double-pulse pumping are\ndemonstrated. Implications to the recent optical pump-probe experiments are\npresented.\n", "  We investigate the dispersion relations of TE resonances in different\ngraphene-dielectric structures. Previous work has shown that when a graphene\nlayer is brought into contact with a dielectric material, a gap can appear in\nits electric band structure. This allows for the formation of TE-plasmons with\nunusual dispersion relations. In addition, if the dielectric has a finite\nthickness, graphene strongly modifies the behavior of the waveguiding modes by\nintroducing dissipation above a well-defined cutoff frequency thus providing\nthe possibility of mode filtering. This cutoff and the properties of\nTE-plasmons are closely related to the pair-creation threshold of graphene thus\nrepresenting quantum mechanical effects that manifest themselves in the\nelectromagnetic response.\n", "  In this paper, using the combined Lorentz-diffeomorphism symmetry, we find a\ngeneral formula for quasi-local conserved charge of the covariant gravity\ntheories in first order formalism of gravity. We simplify the general formula\nfor Lovelock theory of gravity. Afterwards, we apply the obtained formula on\nBHT gravity to obtain energy and angular momentum of the rotating OTT black\nhole solution in the context of this theory.\n", "  Suppression of wave scattering and the realization of transparency effects in\nengineered optical media and surfaces have attracted great attention in the\npast recent years. In this work the problem of transparency is considered for\noptical wave propagation in a nonlinear dielectric medium with second-order\n$\\chi^{(2)}$ susceptibility. Because of nonlinear interaction, a reference\nsignal wave at carrier frequency $\\omega_1$ can exchange power, thus being\namplified or attenuated,when phase matching conditions are satisfied and\nfrequency conversion takes place. Therefore, rather generally the medium is not\ntransparent to the signal wave because of 'scattering' in the frequency domain.\nHere we show that broadband transparency, corresponding to the full absence of\nfrequency conversion in spite of phase matching, can be observed for the signal\nwave in the process of sum frequency generation whenever the effective\nsusceptibility $\\chi^{(2)}$ along the nonlinear medium is tailored following a\nsuitable spatial apodization profile and the power level of the pump wave is\nproperly tuned. While broadband transparency is observed under such conditions,\nthe nonlinear medium is not invisible owing to an additional effective\ndispersion for the signal wave introduced by the nonlinear interaction.\n", "  Camera image sensors can be used to detect ionizing radiation in addition to\noptical photons. In particular, cosmic-ray muons are detected as long, straight\ntracks passing through multiple pixels. The distribution of track lengths can\nbe related to the thickness of the active (depleted) region of the camera image\nsensor through the known angular distribution of muons at sea level. We use a\nsample of cosmic-ray muon tracks recorded by the Distributed Electronic\nCosmic-ray Observatory to measure the thickness of the depletion region of the\ncamera image sensor in a commercial smart phone, the HTC Wildfire S. The track\nlength distribution prefers a cosmic-ray muon angular distribution over an\nisotropic distribution. Allowing either distribution, we measure the depletion\nthickness to be between 13.9~$\\mu$m and 27.7~$\\mu$m. The same method can be\napplied to additional models of image sensor. Once measured, the thickness can\nbe used to convert track length to incident polar angle on a per-event basis.\nCombined with a determination of the incident azimuthal angle directly from the\ntrack orientation in the sensor plane, this enables direction reconstruction of\nindividual cosmic-ray events.\n", "  We construct a systematic high-frequency expansion for periodically driven\nquantum systems based on the Brillouin-Wigner (BW) perturbation theory, which\ngenerates an effective Hamiltonian on the projected zero-photon subspace in the\nFloquet theory, reproducing the quasienergies and eigenstates of the original\nFloquet Hamiltonian up to desired order in $1/\\omega$, with $\\omega$ being the\nfrequency of the drive. The advantage of the BW method is that it is not only\nefficient in deriving higher-order terms, but even enables us to write down the\nwhole infinite series expansion, as compared to the van Vleck degenerate\nperturbation theory. The expansion is also free from a spurious dependence on\nthe driving phase, which has been an obstacle in the Floquet-Magnus expansion.\nWe apply the BW expansion to various models of noninteracting electrons driven\nby circularly polarized light. As the amplitude of the light is increased, the\nsystem undergoes a series of Floquet topological-to-topological phase\ntransitions, whose phase boundary in the high-frequency regime is well\nexplained by the BW expansion. As the frequency is lowered, the high-frequency\nexpansion breaks down at some point due to band touching with nonzero-photon\nsectors, where we find numerically even more intricate and richer Floquet\ntopological phases spring out. We have then analyzed, with the Floquet\ndynamical mean-field theory, the effects of electron-electron interaction and\nenergy dissipation. We have specifically revealed that phase transitions from\nFloquet-topological to Mott insulators emerge, where the phase boundaries can\nagain be captured with the high-frequency expansion.\n", "  The goal of adiabatic ground-state preparation is to start a simple quantum\nsystem in its ground state and adiabatically evolve the Hamiltonian to a\ncomplex one, maintaining the ground state throughout the evolution. In\nion-trap-based quantum simulations, coherence times are too short to allow for\nadiabatic evolution for large chains, so the system evolves diabatically,\ncreating excitations to higher energy states. Because the probability for\ndiabatic excitation depends exponentially on the excitation energy and because\nthe thermal distribution also depends exponentially on the excitation energy,\nwe investigate whether the diabatic excitation can create a thermal\ndistribution; as this could serve as an alternative for creating thermal states\nof complex quantum systems without requiring contact with a heat bath. In this\nwork, we explore this relationship and determine situations where diabatic\nexcitation can approximately create such a thermal state.\n", "  Although the set of permutation symmetries of a complex network can be very\nlarge, few of the symmetries give rise to stable synchronous patterns. Here we\npresent a new framework and develop techniques for controlling synchronization\npatterns in complex network of coupled chaotic oscillators. Specifically,\naccording to the network permutation symmetry, we design a small-size and\nweighted network, namely the control network, and use it to control the\nlarge-size complex network by means of pinning coupling. We argue\nmathematically that for \\emph{any} of the network symmetries, there always\nexists a critical pinning strength beyond which the unstable synchronous\npattern associated to this symmetry can be stabilized. The feasibility of the\ncontrol method is verified by numerical simulations of both artificial and\nreal-work networks, and is demonstrated by experiment of coupled chaotic\ncircuits. Our studies pave a way to the control of dynamical patterns in\ncomplex networks.\n", "  Statistical significance of network clustering has been an unresolved problem\nsince it was observed that community detection algorithms produce false\npositives even in random graphs. After a phase transition between undetectable\nand detectable cluster structures was discovered, the connection between\nspectra of adjacency matrices and detectability limits were shown, and both\nwere calculated for a wide range of networks with arbitrary degree\ndistributions and community structure. In practice the full eigenspectrum is\nnot known, and whether a given network has any communities within detectability\nregime cannot be easily established. Based on the global clustering coefficient\nwe construct a criterion telling whether in an undirected, unweighted network\nthere is some/no detectable community structure, or if the network is in a\ntransient regime. The method is simple and faster than methods involving\nbootstrapping.\n", "  We describe an undergraduate course where physics students are asked to\nconceive an outreach project of their own. The course alternates between the\nproject conception and teachings about pedagogy and outreach, and ends in a\npublic show. We describe its practical implementation and benefits. Through a\nstudent survey and an analysis of their projects, we discuss the merits and\nflaws of this \"learning-by-doing\" teaching approach for physics.\n", "  We study spin-valley and lattice-pseudo spin currents in a dual\nferromagnetic-gated silicene-based junction. Silicene has buckled atomic\nstructure which allows us to take sublattice-dependent ferromagnetism into\naccount in the investigation. One of the study results show that transmission\nat the junctions exhibits anisotropic property only in anti-parallel cases.\nInterestingly, the studied junctions can be switched from a pure spin-polarizer\nto a pure valley-polarizer by reversing directions of exchange fields in the\nparallel junctions. The perfect control of spin-valley currents can be done\nonly in the parallel cases and its resolution can be enhanced by increasing\ngate potential between the ferromagnetic barriers. The asymmetric barriers of\nanti-parallel junction is found to destroy both spin and valley filtering\neffects and yield a novel result, pure sub-lattice pseudo-spin polarization.\nThe current in the anti-parallel junctions can be controlled to flow solely in\neither A or B sub-lattice, saying that the controllable lattice current in\nsilicene is created in double ferromagnetic-gated junction. Our work reveals\nthe potential of dual ferromagnetic-gated silicene junction which may be\npossible for applications in spin-valleytronics and lattice-pseudospintronics.\n", "  The processes and instabilities occurring at the ocean surface in the\nnorthern Gulf of Mexico are investigated with a regional model at\nsubmesoscale-permitting horizontal grid resolution (i.e., HR with dx = 1.6 km)\nover a three-year period, from January 2010 to December 2012. A\nmesoscale-resolving, lower resolution run (LR, with dx = 5 km) is also\nconsidered for comparison. The HR run is obtained through two-way nesting\nwithin the LR run. In HR quantities such local Rossby number, horizontal\ndivergence, vertical velocity, and strain rate are amplified in winter, when\nthe mixed layer is deepest, as found in other basins. In the model\nconfiguration considered this amplification occurs in surface waters over the\ncontinental slope and off-shore but not over the shelf. Submesoscale structures\nconsist of a mixture of fronts and eddies generated by frontogenesis and mixed\nlayer instabilities, with elevated conversion rates of available potential\nenergy (APE) into eddy kinetic energy (EKE). In all quantities a secondary\nmaximum emerges during the summer season, when the mixed layer depth is\nshallowest, barely 15-20 m. The secondary peak extends to the coast and is due\nto the intense lateral density gradients created by the fresh water inflow from\nthe Mississippi River system. Submesoscale structures in summer consist\npredominately of fronts, as observed in the aftermath of the 2010 Deepwater\nHorizon oil spill, and their secondary circulations are impeded due to the\nlimited depth of the mixed layer. Freshwater river input is key to the\nsubmesoscale activity in summer but modulates it also in winter, as shown with\na sensitivity run in which the riverine inflow is absent. Implications for\ntransport studies in regions characterized by intense freshwater fluxes and for\nsubmesoscale parameterizations are discussed.\n", "  We calculate vacuum polarization corrections to the binding energies in\nneutral alkali atoms Na through to the superheavy element E119. We employ the\nrelativistic Hartree-Fock method to demonstrate the importance of relaxation of\nthe electronic core and the correlation potential method to study the effects\nof second and higher orders of perturbation theory. These many-body effects are\nsizeable for all orbitals, though particularly important for orbitals with\nangular momentum quantum number l>0. The orders of magnitude enhancement for d\nwaves produces shifts that, for Rb and the heavier elements, are larger than\nthose for p waves and only an order of magnitude smaller than the s-wave\nshifts. The many-body enhancement mechanisms that operate for vacuum\npolarization apply also to the larger self-energy corrections.\n", "  We develop a scheme to make exactly solvable gauge theories whose electric\nflux lines host (1+1)-dimensional topological phases. We use this exact\n`decorated-string-net' framework to construct several classes of interesting\nmodels. In particular, we construct an exactly solvable model of a quantum spin\nliquid whose (gapped) elementary excitations form doublets under an internal\nsymmetry, and hence may be regarded as spin-carrying spinons. The model may be\nformulated, and is solvable, in any number of dimensions, on any bipartite\ngraph. Another example, in any dimension, has $Z_2$ topological order and\nanyons which are Kramers' doublets of time reversal symmetry. Further, we make\nexactly solvable models of 3d topological paramagnets.\n", "  We theoretically explore a Rashba spin-orbit coupling scheme which operates\nentirely in the absolute ground state manifold of an alkali atom, thereby\nminimizing all inelastic processes. An energy gap between ground eigenstates of\nthe proposed coupling can be continuously opened or closed by modifying laser\npolarizations. Our technique uses far-detuned \"Raman\" laser coupling to create\nthe Rashba potential, which has the benefit of low spontaneous emission rates.\nAt these detunings, the Raman matrix elements that link $m_F$ magnetic sublevel\nquantum numbers separated by two are also suppressed. These matrix elements are\nnecessary to produce the Rashba Hamiltonian within a single total angular\nmomentum $f$ manifold. However, the far-detuned Raman couplings can link the\nthree XYZ states familiar to quantum chemistry, which possess the necessary\nconnectivity to realize the Rashba potential. We show that these XYZ states are\nessentially the hyperfine spin eigenstates of $^{87}\\text{Rb}$ dressed by a\nstrong radio-frequency magnetic field.\n", "  We study a realization of the topology of the Zee model for the generation of\nneutrino masses at one-loop with a minimal set of vector-like fermions. After\nimposing an exact $Z_2$ symmetry to avoid tree-level Higgs-mediated flavor\nchanging neutral currents, one dark matter candidate is obtained from the\nsubjacent inert doublet model, but with the presence of new co-annihilating\nparticles. We show that the model is consistent with the constraints coming\nfrom lepton flavor violation processes, oblique parameters, dark matter and\nneutrino oscillation data.\n", "  Based on quantum statistical mechanics and microscopic quantum dynamics, we\nprove Planck's and Kelvin's principles for macroscopic systems in a general and\nrealistic setting. We consider a hybrid quantum system that consists of the\nthermodynamic system, which is initially in thermal equilibrium, and the\n\"apparatus\" which operates on the former, and assume that the whole system\nevolves autonomously. This provides a satisfactory derivation of the second law\nfor macroscopic systems.\n  Although the main body of the article is self-contained there are two\nsupplemental notes on closely related topics, namely, the law of entropy\nincrease and the approach based on a unital time-evolution.\n", "  We extend a previous self-tuning analysis of the most general scalar-tensor\ntheory of gravity in four dimensions with second order field equations by\nconsidering a generalized coupling to the matter sector. Through allowing a\ndisformal coupling to matter we are able to extend the Fab Four model and\nconstruct a new class of theories that are able to tune away the cosmological\nconstant on Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker backgrounds.\n", "  Controlling the propagation and coupling of light to sub-wavelength antennas\nis a crucial prerequisite for many nanoscale optical devices. Recently, the\nmain focus of attention has been directed towards high-refractive-index\nmaterials such as silicon as an integral part of the antenna design. This\ndevelopment is motivated by the rich spectral properties of individual\nhigh-refractive-index nanoparticles. Here, we take advantage of the\ninterference of their magnetic and electric resonances, to achieve remarkably\nstrong lateral directionality. For controlled excitation of a spherical silicon\nnanoantenna we use tightly focused radially polarized light. The resultant\ndirectional emission depends on the antenna's position relative to the focus.\nThis approach finds application as a novel position sensing technique, which\nmight be implemented in modern nanometrology and super-resolution microscopy\nsetups. We demonstrate in a proof-of-concept experiment, that a lateral\nresolution in the Angstrom regime can be achieved.\n", "  We construct an $SU(2)_L\\times SU(2)_R\\times U(1)_{B-L}$ model with a Higgs\nsector that consists of a bidoublet and a doublet, and with a right-handed\nneutrino sector that includes one Dirac fermion and one Majorana fermion. This\nmodel explains the Run 1 CMS and ATLAS excess events in the $e^+e^-jj$, $jj$,\n$Wh^0$ and $WZ$ channels in terms of a $W'$ boson of mass near 1.9 TeV and of\ncoupling $g_R$ in the 0.4--0.5 range, with the lower half preferred by limits\non $t \\bar b$ resonances and Run 2 results. The production cross section of\nthis $W'$ boson at the 13 TeV LHC is in the 700--900 fb range, allowing\nsensitivity in more than 17 final states. We determine that the $Z'$ boson has\na mass in the 3.4--4.5 TeV range and several decay channels that can be probed\nin Run 2 of the LHC, including cascade decays via heavy Higgs bosons.\n", "  We present an ongoing development of an existing code for calculating\nground-state, steady-state, and transient properties of many-particle systems.\nThe development involves the addition of the full four-index two electron\nintegrals, which allows for the calculation of transport systems, as well as\nthe extension to multi-level electronic systems, such as atomic and molecular\nsystems and other applications. The necessary derivations are shown, along with\nsome preliminary results and a summary of future plans for the code.\n", "  Spin polarized current is the main ingredient of diluted magnetic oxides due\nto its potential manipulation in spintronic devices. However, most research has\nfocused on ferromagnetic properties rather than polarization of electric\ncurrent, because direct measurements were difficult and the origin of spin\npolarized currents has yet to be fully understood. The method to increase the\nspin polarized current percentage is beyond practical consideration at the\npresent status. To target this problem, we focus on the role of oxygen\nvacancies and nano grain size on the spin polarized current, which are\ncontrolled by growing the Co-doped ZnO thin-films at room temperature in a\nreducing atmosphere [Ar + (1% ~ 30%) H2]. We found that the conductivity\nincreases with an increase in oxygen vacancies via two independent channels:\nthe variable range hopping (VRH) within localized states and the itinerant\ntransport in the conduction band. The Andreev Reflection measurements prove\nthat the VRH conduction is equivalent to spin polarized current. Transport\nmeasurements show that the best way to increase the VRH content, or the\npercentage of spin polarized current, is to increase oxygen vacancy\nconcentration and to reduce grain size and lattice constants of the films.\n", "  We investigate how dark energy properties impact the cosmological limits on\nthe total mass of active neutrinos. We consider two typical, simple dark energy\nmodels (that have only one more additional parameter than $\\Lambda$CDM), i.e.,\nthe $w$CDM model and the holographic dark energy (HDE) model, as examples, to\nmake an analysis. In the cosmological fits, we use the Planck 2015 temperature\nand polarization data, in combination with other low-redshift observations,\nincluding the baryon acoustic oscillations, type Ia supernovae, and Hubble\nconstant measurement, as well as the Planck lensing measurements. We find that,\nonce dynamical dark energy is considered, the degeneracy between $\\sum m_\\nu$\nand $H_0$ will be changed, i.e., in the $\\Lambda$CDM model, $\\sum m_\\nu$ is\nanti-correlated with $H_0$, but in the $w$CDM and HDE models, $\\sum m_\\nu$\nbecomes positively correlated with $H_0$. Compared to $\\Lambda$CDM, in the\n$w$CDM model the limit on $\\sum m_\\nu$ becomes much looser, but in the HDE\nmodel the limit becomes much tighter. In the HDE model, we obtain $\\sum\nm_\\nu<0.113$ eV ($95\\%$ CL) with the combined data sets, which is perhaps the\nmost stringent upper limit by far on neutrino mass. Thus, our result in the HDE\nmodel is nearly ready to diagnose the neutrino mass hierarchy with the current\ncosmological observations.\n", "  The Mayer cluster expansion technique is applied to the Nekrasov instanton\npartition function of $\\mathcal{N}=2$ $SU(N_c)$ super Yang-Mills. The\nsubleading small $\\epsilon_2$-correction to the Nekrasov-Shatashvili limiting\nvalue of the prepotential is determined by a detailed analysis of all the\none-loop diagrams. Indeed, several types of contributions can be distinguished\naccording to their origin: long range interaction or potential expansion,\nclusters self-energy, internal structure, one-loop cyclic diagrams, etc.. The\nfield theory result derived more efficiently in [1], under some minor technical\nassumptions, receives here definite confirmation thanks to several remarkable\ncancellations: in this way, we may infer the validity of these assumptions for\nfurther computations in the field theoretical approach.\n", "  Black holes (BHs) hide themselves behind various astronomical phenomena, and\ntheir properties, i.e., mass and spin, are usually difficult to constrain. One\nleading candidate for the central engine model of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)\ninvokes a stellar mass BH and a neutrino-dominated accretion flow (NDAF), with\nthe relativistic jet launched due to neutrino-anti-neutrino annihilations. Such\na model gives rise to a matter-dominated fireball, and is suitable to interpret\nGRBs with a dominant thermal component with a photospheric origin. We propose a\nmethod to constrain BH mass and spin within the framework of this model, and\napply the method to a thermally-dominant GRB 101219B whose initial jet\nlaunching radius $r_0$ is constrained from the data. Using our numerical model\nof NDAF jets, we estimate the following constraints on the central BH: mass\n$M_{\\rm BH} \\sim 5-9~M_\\odot$, spin parameter $a_* \\gtrsim 0.6$, and disk mass\n$3~M_\\odot \\lesssim M_{\\rm disk} \\lesssim 4~M_\\odot$. Our results also suggest\nthat the NDAF model is a competitive candidate for the central engine of GRBs\nwith a strong thermal component.\n", "  In this letter, we analyze for the first time the physics reach in terms of\nsensitivity to leptonic CP violation of the proposed MuOn-decay MEdium baseline\nNeuTrino beam (MOMENT) experiment, a novel neutrino oscillation facility that\nwould operate with neutrinos from muon decay. Apart from obtaining a\nsufficiently intense flux, the bottlenecks to the physics reach of this\nexperiment will be achieving a high enough suppression of the atmospheric\nbackground and, particularly, attaining a sufficient level of charge\nidentification. We thus present our results as a function of these two factors.\nAs for the detector, we consider a very massive Gd-doped Water Cherenkov\ndetector. We find that MOMENT will be competitive with other currently planned\nfuture oscillation experiments if a charge identification of at least 80 % can\nbe achieved at the same time that the atmospheric background can be suppressed\nby at least a factor of ten. We also find a large synergy of MOMENT with the\ncurrent generation of neutrino oscillation experiments, T2K and NOvA, which\nsignificantly enhances its final sensitivity.\n", "  We present new results for the jet-veto efficiency and zero-jet cross section\nin Higgs production through gluon fusion. We incorporate the N$^3$LO\ncorrections to the total cross section, the NNLO corrections to the 1-jet rate,\nNNLL resummation for the jet $p_t$ and LL resummation for the jet radius\ndependence. Our results include known finite-mass corrections and are obtained\nusing the jet-veto efficiency method, updated relative to earlier work to take\ninto account what has been learnt from the new precision calculations that we\ninclude. For 13 TeV collisions and using our default choice for the\nrenormalisation and factorisation scales, $\\mu_0=m_H/2$, the matched prediction\nfor the jet-veto efficiency increases the pure NNNLO prediction by about 2% and\nthe two have comparable uncertainties. Relative to NNLO+NNLL results, the new\nprediction is 2% smaller and the uncertainty reduces from more than 10% to less\nthan 5%. Results are also presented for the central scale $\\mu_0=m_H$.\n", "  We develop a theoretical model, relying on the well established sp3\nbond-orbital theory, to describe the strain-induced $\\chi^{(2)}$ in\ntetrahedrally coordinated centrosymmetric covalent crystals, like silicon. With\nthis approach we are able to describe every component of the $\\chi^{(2)}$\ntensor in terms of a linear combination of strain gradients and only two\nparameters $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ which can be estimated theoretically. The\nresulting formula can be applied to the simulation of the strain distribution\nof a practical strained silicon device, providing an extraordinary tool for\noptimization of its optical nonlinear effects. By doing that, we were able not\nonly to confirm the main valid claims known about $\\chi^{(2)}$ in strained\nsilicon, but also estimate the order of magnitude of the $\\chi^{(2)}$ generated\nin that device.\n", "  The problem of integrability of the mixmaster model as a dynamical system\nwith finite degrees of freedom is investigated. The model belongs to the class\nof pseudo-Euclidean generalized Toda chains. It is presented as a\nquasi-homogeneous system after transformations of phase variables. An\napplication of the method of getting of Kovalevskaya exponents to the model\nleads to the generalized Adler -- van Moerbeke formula on root vectors. A\ngeneralized Cartan matrix is constructed with use of simple root vectors in\nMinkowski space. The mixmaster model is associated to a Borcherds algebra. The\nknown hyperbolic Kac -- Moody algebra of Chitre billiard model is obtained by\nusing three spacelike (without isotropic) root vectors.\n", "  A class of coupled cell-bulk ODE-PDE models is formulated and analyzed in a\ntwo-dimensional domain, which is relevant to studying quorum sensing behavior\non thin substrates. In this model, spatially segregated dynamically active\nsignaling cells of a common small radius $\\epsilon\\ll 1$ are coupled through a\npassive bulk diffusion field. The method of matched asymptotic expansions is\nused to construct steady-state solutions and to formulate a spectral problem\nthat characterizes the linear stability properties of these solutions, with the\naim of predicting whether temporal oscillations can be triggered by the\ncell-bulk coupling. Phase diagrams in parameter space where such collective\noscillations can occur are illustrated for two specific choices of the\nintracellular kinetics. In the limit of very large bulk diffusion, it is shown\nthat the ODE-PDE system can be approximated by a finite-dimensional dynamical\nsystem, which is studied both analytically and numerically. For one\nillustrative example of the theory it is shown that when the number of cells\nexceeds some critical number, the bulk diffusion field can trigger oscillations\nthat would otherwise not occur without the coupling. Moreover, for two specific\nmodels for the intracellular dynamics, we show that there are rather wide\nregions in parameter space where these triggered oscillations are synchronous\nin nature. Unless the bulk diffusivity is asymptotically large, it is shown\nthat a clustered spatial configuration of cells inside the domain leads to\nlarger regions in parameter space where synchronous collective oscillations\nbetween the small cells can occur. Finally, the linear stability analysis for\nthese cell-bulk models is shown to be qualitatively rather similar to that of\nlocalized spot patterns for activator-inhibitor reaction-diffusion systems in\nthe limit of long-range inhibition and short-range activation.\n", "  We develop a primal-dual algorithm that allows for one-step inversion of\nspectral CT transmission photon counts data to a basis map decomposition. The\nalgorithm allows for image constraints to be enforced on the basis maps during\nthe inversion. The derivation of the algorithm makes use of a local upper\nbounding quadratic approximation to generate descent steps for non-convex\nspectral CT data discrepancy terms, combined with a new convex-concave\noptimization algorithm. Convergence of the algorithm is demonstrated on\nsimulated spectral CT data. Simulations with noise and anthropomorphic phantoms\nshow examples of how to employ the constrained one-step algorithm for spectral\nCT data.\n", "  We report an experimental investigation of the electric response of\nsuperfluid helium. Our results confirm the presence of electric potential that\nappears at the relative oscillatory motion of normal fluid and superfluid\ncomponents in helium generated by the heater. The resonance of the electric\npotential was observed in the first four harmonics. A suggested method for the\ndetection of the electric response allows the required resonance peak to be\ndistinguished from spurious signals. Our results are in qualitative agreement\nwith the data published by previous researchers. The reasons for the\ndiscrepancy in the measured values of the potential difference are discussed.\n", "  Optical modes in anisotropic slab waveguides with topological and chiral\nmagnetoelectric effects are investigated analytically, by deriving the\nclosed-form characteristic equations of the modes and hence computing the\ndispersion-diagrams. In order to compute the characteristic equations, a\nvector-potential approach is introduced by incorporating a generalized Lorentz\ngauge, and the corresponding Helmholtz equations are derived correspondingly.\nIt will be shown that the formation of the complex modes and hybridization of\nthe optical modes in such slab waveguides is inevitable. Moreover, when the\ntensorial form of the permittivity in the waveguide allows for a hyperbolic\ndispersion, complex transition from the photonic kinds of modes to the\nplasmonic modes is expected.\n", "  Motivated by lopsided structures observed in some massive transition discs,\nwe have carried out 2D numerical simulations to study vortex structure in\nmassive discs, including the effects of disc self-gravity and the indirect\nforce which is due to the displacement of the central star from the barycenter\nof the system by the lopsided structure. When only the indirect force is\nincluded, we confirm the finding by Mittal & Chiang (2015) that the vortex\nbecomes stronger and can be more than two pressure scale heights wide, as long\nas the disc-to-star mass ratio is >1%. Such wide vortices can excite strong\ndensity waves in the disc and therefore migrate inwards rapidly. However, when\ndisc self-gravity is also considered in simulations, self-gravity plays a more\nprominent role on the vortex structure. We confirm that when the disc Toomre Q\nparameter is smaller than pi/(2h), where h is the disc's aspect ratio, the\nvortices are significantly weakened and their inward migration slows down\ndramatically. Most importantly, when the disc is massive enough (e.g. Q~3), we\nfind that the lopsided gas structure orbits around the star at a speed\nsignificantly slower than the local Keplerian speed. This sub-Keplerian pattern\nspeed can lead to the concentration of dust particles at a radius beyond the\nlopsided gas structure (as shown in Paper II). Overall, disc self-gravity\nregulates the vortex structure in massive discs and the radial shift between\nthe gas and dust distributions in vortices within massive discs may be probed\nby future observations.\n", "  We investigate the dynamics of large dust grains in massive lopsided\ntransition discs via 2D hydrodynamical simulations including both gas and dust.\nOur simulations adopt a ring-like gas density profile that becomes unstable\nagainst the Rossby-wave instability and forms a large crescent-shaped vortex.\nWhen gas self-gravity is discarded, but the indirect force from the\ndisplacement of the star by the vortex is included, we confirm that dust grains\nwith stopping times of order the orbital time, which should be typically a few\ncentimetres in size, are trapped ahead of the vortex in the azimuthal\ndirection, while the smallest and largest grains concentrate towards the vortex\ncentre. We obtain maximum shift angles of about 25 degrees. Gas self-gravity\naccentuates the concentration differences between small and large grains. At\nlow to moderate disc masses, the larger the grains, the farther they are\ntrapped ahead of the vortex. Shift angles up to 90 degrees are reached for 10\ncm-sized grains, and we show that such large offsets can produce a\ndouble-peaked continuum emission observable at mm/cm wavelengths. This\nbehaviour comes about because the large grains undergo horseshoe U-turns\nrelative to the vortex due to the vortex's gravity. At large disc masses, since\nthe vortex's pattern frequency becomes increasingly slower than Keplerian,\nsmall grains concentrate slightly beyond the vortex and large grains form\ngenerally non-axisymmetric ring-like structures around the vortex's radial\nlocation. Gas self-gravity therefore imparts distinct trapping locations for\nsmall and large dust grains which may be probed by current and future\nobservations, and which suggest that the formation of planetesimals in vortices\nmight be more difficult than previously thought.\n", "  Small-amplitude dynamic atomic force microscopy (dynamic-AFM) in a simple\nnonpolar liquid was studied through molecular dynamics simulations. We find\nthat within linear dynamics regime, the contact stiffness and damping of the\nconfined film exhibit the similar solvation force oscillations, and they are\ngenerally out-of-phase. For the solidified film with integer monolayer\nthickness, further compression of the film before layering transition leads to\nhigher stiffness and lower damping. We find that molecular diffusion in the\nsolidified film was nevertheless enhanced due to the mechanical excitation of\nAFM tip.\n", "  We develop a robust and efficient method for soliton calculations for\nnonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equations. The method is based on the recently\ndeveloped sparsifying preconditioner combined with Newton's iterative method.\nThe performance of the method is demonstrated by numerical examples of gap\nsolitons in the context of nonlinear optics.\n", "  Cells generally convert nutrient resources to useful products via energy\ntransduction. Accordingly, the thermodynamic efficiency of this conversion\nprocess is one of the most essential characteristics of living organisms.\nHowever, although these processes occur under conditions of dynamic metabolism,\nmost studies of cellular thermodynamic efficiency have been restricted to\nexamining steady states; thus, the relevance of dynamics to this efficiency has\nnot yet been elucidated. Here, we develop a simple model of metabolic reactions\nwith anabolism-catabolism coupling catalysed by enzymes. Through application of\nexternal oscillation in the enzyme abundances, the thermodynamic efficiency of\nmetabolism was found to be improved. This result is in strong contrast with\nthat observed in the oscillatory input, in which the efficiency always\ndecreased with oscillation. This improvement was effectively achieved by\nseparating the anabolic and catabolic reactions, which tend to disequilibrate\neach other, and taking advantage of the temporal oscillations so that each of\nthe antagonistic reactions could progress near equilibrium. In this case,\nanti-phase oscillation between the reaction flux and chemical affinity through\noscillation of enzyme abundances is essential. This improvement was also\nconfirmed in a model capable of generating autonomous oscillations in enzyme\nabundances. Finally, the possible relevance of the improvement in thermodynamic\nefficiency is discussed with respect to the potential for manipulation of\nmetabolic oscillations in microorganisms.\n", "  The stochastic mean-field (SMF) approach allows to treat correlations beyond\nmean-field using a set of independent mean-field trajectories with appropriate\nchoice of fluctuating initial conditions. We show here, that this approach is\nequivalent to a simplified version of the Bogolyubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon\n(BBGKY) hierarchy between one-, two-, ..., N-body degrees of freedom. In this\nsimplified version, one-body degrees of freedom are coupled to fluctuations to\nall orders while retaining only specific terms of the general BBGKY hierarchy.\nThe use of the simplified BBGKY is illustrated with the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick\n(LMG) model. We show that a truncated version of this hierarchy can be useful,\nas an alternative to the SMF, especially in the weak coupling regime to get\nphysical insight in the effect beyond mean-field. In particular, it leads to\napproximate analytical expressions for the quantum fluctuations both in the\nweak and strong coupling regime. In the strong coupling regime, it can only be\nused for short time evolution. In that case, it gives information on the\nevolution time-scale close to a saddle point associated to a quantum\nphase-transition. For long time evolution and strong coupling, we observed that\nthe simplified BBGKY hierarchy cannot be truncated and only the full SMF with\ninitial sampling leads to reasonable results.\n", "  The theory of Maximum Probability Domains (MPDs) is formulated for the\nHubbard model in terms of projection operators and generating functions for\nboth exact eigenstates as well as Slater determinants. A fast MPD analysis\nprocedure is proposed, which is subsequently used to analyse numerical results\nfor the Hubbard model. It is shown that the essential physics behind the\nconsidered Hubbard models can be exposed using MPDs. Furthermore, the MPDs\nappear to be in line with what is expected from Valence Bond Theory-based\nknowledge.\n", "  The general solution of the Dirac equation for quasi-two-dimensional\nelectrons confined in an asymmetric quantum well, is found. The energy spectrum\nof such a system is exactly calculated using special unitary transformation and\nshown to depend on the electron spin polarization. The general solution, being\nthe only one, contains free parameters, whose variation continuously transforms\none known particular solution into another. As an example, two different cases\nare considered in detailL: electron in a deep and in a strongly asymmetric\nshallow quantum well. The effective mass renormalized by relativistic\ncorrections and Bychkov-Rashba coefficients are analytically obtained for both\ncases. The general solution allows - independently on the existence of the spin\ninvariants - to establish conditions at which a specific (accompanied or\nnon-accompanied by Rashba splitting) spin state can be realized. In principle,\nthis opens new possibilities of the spin degree of freedom control in\nspintronics via synthesis of heteroctructures of the desirable properties.\n", "  The initial energy density distribution and fluctuation in the transverse\ndirection lead to anisotropic flows of final hadrons through collective\nexpansion in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. Fluctuations along the\nlongitudinal direction, on the other hand, can result in decorrelation of\nanisotropic flows in different regions of pseudo rapidity ($\\eta$).\nDecorrelation of the $2$nd and $3$rd order anisotropic flows with different\n$\\eta$ gaps for final charged hadrons in high-energy heavy-ion collisions is\nstudied in an event-by-event (3+1)D ideal hydrodynamic model with fully\nfluctuating initial conditions from A Multi-Phase Transport (AMPT) model. The\ndecorrelation of anisotropic flows of final hadrons with large $\\eta$ gaps are\nfound to originate from the spatial decorrelation along the longitudinal\ndirection in the AMPT initial conditions through hydrodynamic evolution. The\ndecorrelation is found to consist of both a linear twist and random fluctuation\nof the event-plane angles. The agreement between our results and recent CMS\ndata in most centralities suggests that the string-like mechanism of initial\nparton production in AMPT model captures the initial longitudinal fluctuation\nthat is responsible for the measured decorrelation of anisotropic flows in\nPb+Pb collisions at LHC. Our predictions for Au+Au collisions at the highest\nRHIC energy show stronger longitudinal decorrelation, indicating larger\nlongitudinal fluctuations at lower beam energies. Our study also calls into\nquestion some of the current experimental methods for measuring anisotropic\nflows and extraction of transport coefficients through comparisons to\nhydrodynamic simulations that do not include longitudinal fluctuations.\n", "  Self-testing allows us to determine, through classical interaction only,\nwhether some players in a non-local game share particular quantum states. Most\nwork on self-testing has concentrated on developing tests for small states like\none pair of maximally entangled qubits, or on tests where there is a separate\nplayer for each qubit, as in a graph state. Here we consider the case of\ntesting many maximally entangled pairs of qubits shared between two players.\nPreviously such a test was shown where testing is sequential, i.e., one pair is\ntested at a time. Here we consider the parallel case where all pairs are tested\nsimultaneously, giving considerably more power to dishonest players. We derive\nsufficient conditions for a self-test for many maximally entangled pairs of\nqubits shared between two players and also two constructions for self-tests\nwhere all pairs are tested simultaneously.\n", "  Sound waves from the primordial fluctuations of the Universe imprinted in the\nlarge-scale structure, called baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs), can be used\nas standard rulers to measure the scale of the Universe. These oscillations\nhave already been detected in the distribution of galaxies. Here we propose to\nmeasure BAOs from the troughs (minima) of the density field. Based on two sets\nof accurate mock halo catalogues with and without BAOs in the seed initial\nconditions, we demonstrate that the BAO signal cannot be obtained from the\nclustering of classical disjoint voids, but is clearly detected from\noverlapping voids. The latter represent an estimate of all troughs of the\ndensity field. We compute them from the empty circumsphere centers constrained\nby tetrahedra of galaxies using Delaunay triangulation. Our theoretical models\nbased on an unprecedented large set of detailed simulated void catalogues are\nremarkably well confirmed by observational data. We use the largest recently\npublicly available sample of luminous red galaxies from SDSS-III BOSS DR11 to\nunveil for the first time a >3$\\sigma$ BAO detection from voids in\nobservations. Since voids are nearly isotropically expanding regions, their\ncenters represent the most quiet places in the Universe, keeping in mind the\ncosmos origin and providing a new promising window in the analysis of the\ncosmological large-scale structure from galaxy surveys.\n", "  From the Wilsonian point of view, renormalisable theories are understood as\nsubmanifolds in theory space emanating from a particular fixed point under\nrenormalisation group evolution. We show how this picture precisely applies to\ntheir gravity duals. We investigate the Hamilton-Jacobi equation satisfied by\nthe Wilson action and find the corresponding fixed points and their\neigendeformations, which have a diagonal evolution close to the fixed points.\nThe relevant eigendeformations are used to construct renormalised theories. We\nexplore the relation of this formalism with holographic renormalisation. We\nalso discuss different renormalisation schemes and show that the solutions to\nthe gravity equations of motion can be used as renormalised couplings that\nparametrise the renormalised theories. This provides a transparent connection\nbetween holographic renormalisation group flows in the Wilsonian and\nnon-Wilsonian approaches. The general results are illustrated by explicit\ncalculations in an interacting scalar theory in AdS space.\n", "  A light scalar $\\phi$ with mass $\\lesssim 1$ GeV and muonic coupling\n$\\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$ would explain the 3.5 $\\sigma$ discrepancy between the\nStandard Model (SM) muon $g-2$ prediction and experiment. Such a scalar can be\nassociated with a light remnant of the Higgs mechanism in the \"dark\" sector. We\nsuggest $\\phi\\to l^+l^-$ bump hunting in $\\mu\\to e\\nu\\bar\\nu\\phi$,\n$\\mu^-p\\to\\nu_\\mu n\\phi$ (muon capture), and $K^\\pm\\to \\mu^\\pm\\nu\\phi$ decays\nas direct probes of this scenario. In a general setup, a potentially observable\nmuon electric dipole moment $\\lesssim 10^{-23}\\ e \\cdot\\textrm{cm}$ and lepton\nflavor violating decays $\\tau\\to\\mu (e) \\phi$ or $\\mu \\to e \\phi$ can also\narise. Depending on parameters, a deviation in BR($H\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-$) from SM\nexpectations, due to Higgs coupling misalignment, can result. We illustrate how\nthe requisite interactions can be mediated by weak scale vector-like leptons\nthat typically lie within the reach of future LHC measurements.\n", "  We calculate the power spectrum of electric-field-driven ion transport\nthrough cylindrical nanometer-scale pores using both linearized mean-field\ntheory and Langevin dynamics simulations. With the atom-sized cutoff radius as\nthe only fitting parameter, the linearized mean-field theory accurately\ncaptures the dependence of the simulated power spectral density on the pore\nradius and the applied electric field. Remarkably, the linearized mean-field\ntheory predicts a plateau in the power spectral density at low frequency\n${\\omega}$, which is confirmed by the Langevin dynamics simulations at low ion\nconcentration. At high ion concentration, however, the power spectral density\nfollows a power law that is reminiscent of the $1/{\\omega}^{\\alpha}$ dependence\nfound experimentally at low frequency. Based on simulations with and without\nion-ion interactions, we attribute the low-frequency power law dependence to\nion-ion correlations. Finally, we show that the surface charge density has no\neffect on the frequency dependence of the power spectrum.\n", "  In this paper we investigate properties of Chern-Simons theory coupled to\nmassive fermions in the large N limit. We demonstrate that at low temperatures\nthe system is in a Fermi liquid state whose features can be systematically\ncompared to the standard phenomenological theory of Landau Fermi liquids. This\nincludes matching microscopically derived Landau parameters with thermodynamic\npredictions of Landau Fermi liquid theory. We also calculate the exact\nconductivity and viscosity tensors at zero temperature and finite chemical\npotential. In particular we point out that the Hall conductivity of an\ninteracting system is not entirely accounted for by the Berry flux through the\nFermi sphere. Furthermore, investigation of the thermodynamics in the\nnon-relativistic limit reveals novel phenomena at strong coupling. As the 't\nHooft coupling approaches 1, the system exhibits an extended intermediate\ntemperature regime in which the thermodynamics is described by neither the\nquantum Fermi liquid theory nor the classical ideal gas law. Instead, it can be\ninterpreted as a weakly coupled quantum Bose gas.\n", "  We demonstrate synthesis of super-octave-spanning and phase-locked transients\nin the multi-terahertz frequency range with amplitudes exceeding 13 MV/cm.\nSub-cycle polar asymmetry of the electric field is adjusted by changing the\nrelative phase between superposed fundamental and second harmonic components.\nThe resultant broken symmetry of the field profile is directly resolved via\nultrabroadband electro-optic sampling. Access to such waveforms provides a\ndirect route for control of low-energy degrees of freedom in condensed matter\nas well as non-perturbative light-matter interactions.\n", "  We present the results of transverse-field muon-spin rotation measurements on\nan epitaxially grown 40 nm-thick film of MnSi on Si(111) in the region of the\nfield-temperature phase diagram where a skyrmion phase has been observed in the\nbulk. We identify changes in the quasistatic magnetic field distribution\nsampled by the muon, along with evidence for magnetic transitions around\n$T\\approx 40$ K and 30 K. Our results suggest that the cone phase is not the\nonly magnetic texture realized in film samples for out-of-plane fields.\n", "  Despite their inherent non-equilibrium nature, living systems can\nself-organize in highly ordered collective states that share striking\nsimilarities with the thermodynamic equilibrium phases of conventional\ncondensed matter and fluid systems. Examples range from the liquid-crystal-like\narrangements of bacterial colonies, microbial suspensions and tissues to the\ncoherent macro-scale dynamics in schools of fish and flocks of birds. Yet, the\ngeneric mathematical principles that govern the emergence of structure in such\nartificial and biological systems are elusive. It is not clear when, or even\nwhether, well-established theoretical concepts describing universal\nthermostatistics of equilibrium systems can capture and classify ordered states\nof living matter. Here, we connect these two previously disparate regimes:\nThrough microfluidic experiments and mathematical modelling, we demonstrate\nthat lattices of hydrodynamically coupled bacterial vortices can spontaneously\norganize into distinct phases of ferro- and antiferromagnetic order. The\npreferred phase can be controlled by tuning the vortex coupling through changes\nof the inter-cavity gap widths. The emergence of opposing order regimes is\ntightly linked to the existence of geometry-induced edge currents, reminiscent\nof those in quantum systems. Our experimental observations can be rationalized\nin terms of a generic lattice field theory, suggesting that bacterial spin\nnetworks belong to the same universality class as a wide range of equilibrium\nsystems.\n", "  An atomistic study of the order-effect occurring in Li$_{x}$CoO$_{2}$ at\n$x=0.5$ is presented and an explanation for the computationally and\nexperimentally observed dip in the Li diffusivity is proposed. Configurations\nwhere a single half-filled Li layer arranged in either a linear or a zig-zag\npattern are simulated. It is found that the lowest energy phase is the zig-zag\npattern rather than the linear arrangement that currently is considered to be\nof lowest energy. Atomic interactions are modeled at the DFT level of accuracy\nand energy barriers for Li-ion diffusion are determined from searches for first\norder saddle points on the resulting potential energy surface. The determined\nsaddle points reveal that the barriers for diffusion parallel and perpendicular\nto the zig-zag phase differ significantly and explain the observed dip in\ndiffusivity.\n", "  Recently [Phys. Rev. B 91, 125433 (2015)] we derived a general formula for\nthe time-dependent quantum electron current through a molecular junction\nsubject to an arbitrary time-dependent bias within the Wide Band Limit\nApproximation (WBLA) and assuming a single particle Hamiltonian. Here we\npresent an efficient numerical scheme for calculating the current and particle\nnumber. Using the Pad\\'e expansion of the Fermi function, it is shown that all\nfrequency integrals occurring in the general formula for the current can be\nremoved analytically. Furthermore, when the bias in the reservoirs is assumed\nto be sinusoidal it is possible to manipulate the general formula into a form\ncontaining only summations over special functions. To illustrate the method, we\nconsider electron transport through a one-dimensional molecular wire coupled to\ntwo leads subject to out-of-phase biases. We also investigate finite size\neffects in the current response and particle number that results from the\nswitch-on of such a bias.\n", "  The relativistic quantum dynamics of an electrically charged particle subject\nto the Klein-Gordon oscillator and the Coulomb potential is investigated. By\nsearching for relativistic bound states, a particular quantum effect can be\nobserved: a dependence of the angular frequency of the Klein-Gordon oscillator\non the quantum numbers of the system. The meaning of this behaviour of the\nangular frequency is that only some specific values of the angular frequency of\nthe Klein-Gordon oscillator are permitted in order to obtain bound state\nsolutions. As an example, we obtain both the angular frequency and the energy\nlevel associated with the ground state of the relativistic system. Further, we\nanalyse the behaviour of an electrically charged particle subject to the\nKlein-Gordon oscillator, the Coulomb potential and a linear scalar potential.\n", "  We propose a theory of three-dimensional (anti) de Sitter gravity carrying\nChan-Paton color charges. We define the theory by Chern-Simons formulation with\nthe gauge algebra $(\\mathfrak{gl}_{2}\\oplus \\mathfrak{gl}_{2})\\otimes\n\\mathfrak{u}(N)$, obtaining a color-decorated version of interacting spin-one\nand spin-two fields. We also describe the theory in metric formulation and show\nthat, among $N^{2}$ massless spin-two fields, only the singlet one plays the\nrole of metric graviton whereas the rest behave as \\emph{colored spinning\nmatter} that strongly interacts at large $N$. Remarkably, these \\emph{colored\nspinning matter} acts as Higgs field and generates a non-trivial potential of\nstaircase shape. At each extremum labelled by $k = 0, \\ldots, [\\frac{N-1}2]$,\nthe $\\mathfrak{u}(N)$ color gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken down to\n$\\mathfrak{u}(N-k)\\oplus \\mathfrak{u}(k)$ and provides different (A)dS\nbackgrounds with the cosmological constants\n$\\big(\\frac{N}{N-2k}\\big)^{2}\\,\\L$\\,. When this symmetry breaking takes place,\nthe spin-two Goldstone modes combine with (or are eaten by) the spin-one gauge\nfields to become partially-massless spin-two fields. We discuss various aspects\nof this theory and highlight physical implications.\n", "  The tunability of an optical cavity is an essential requirement for many\nareas of research. Here, we use the Pound-Drever-Hall technique to lock a laser\nto a whispering gallery mode (WGM) of a microbubble resonator, to show that\nlinear tuning of the WGM, and the corresponding locked laser, display almost\nzero hysteresis. By applying aerostatic pressure to the interior surface of the\nmicrobubble resonator, optical mode shift rates of around $58$ GHz/MPa are\nachieved. The microbubble can measure pressure with a detection limit of\n$2\\times 10^{-4}$ MPa, which is an improvement made on pressure sensing using\nthis device. The long-term frequency stability of this tuning method for\ndifferent input pressures is measured. The frequency noise of the WGM measured\nover $10$ minutes for an input pressure of $0.5$ MPa, has a maximum standard\ndeviation of $36$ MHz.\n", "  In the light dark matter (DM) scenario of the MSSM, the DM relic density puts\nnon-trivial requirements on the spectrum of supersymmetric particles. As a\nresult, the direct search for multi-lepton signals at the LHC has great impact\non the scenario. In this work, we concentrate on the searches for sleptons and\nelectroweak-inos at the LHC, and investigate the constraints on the light DM\nscenario from the 8 TeV LHC data as well as the capability of the 14 TeV LHC to\ntest the scenario. We first get the samples of the scenario by scanning the\nvast parameter space of the MSSM and considering some easily available\nconstraints, such as those from the DM relic density, the LUX experiment and\nthe Higgs searches at colliders. Then for the surviving samples, we simulate\nthe $2l+E_T^{miss}$ signal from slepton pair production process and the\n$2l+E_T^{miss}$ and $3l+E_T^{miss}$ signals from chargino and neutralino\nassociated production processes at both the 8 TeV LHC and the 14 TeV LHC. Our\nsimulations indicate that the 8 TeV LHC has excluded a sizable portion of the\nsamples, and the 14 TeV LHC can be even much more powerful in testing the\nscenario. For example, in case that no multi-lepton signals are observed at the\n14 TeV LHC, most samples of the light DM scenario will be excluded, especially\na lower limit on the lightest neutralino mass will be set at 42 GeV and 44 GeV\nwith 30 $fb^{-1}$ and 100 $fb^{-1}$ data respectively, and this limit can be\nfurther pushed up to $55\\ {\\rm GeV}$ with 300 $fb^{-1}$ data.\n", "  We study the one-loop partition function of 3D gravity without cosmological\nconstant on the solid torus with arbitrary metric fluctuations on the boundary.\nTo this end we employ the discrete approach of (quantum) Regge calculus. In\ncontrast with similar calculations performed directly in the continuum, we work\nwith a boundary at finite distance from the torus axis. We show that after\ntaking the continuum limit on the boundary - but still keeping finite distance\nfrom the torus axis - the one-loop correction is the same as the one recently\nfound in the continuum in Barnich et al. for an asymptotically flat boundary.\nThe discrete approach taken here allows to identify the boundary degrees of\nfreedom which are responsible for the non-trivial structure of the one-loop\ncorrection. We therefore calculate also the Hamilton-Jacobi function to\nquadratic order in the boundary fluctuations both in the discrete set-up and\ndirectly in the continuum theory. We identify a dual boundary field theory with\na Liouville type coupling to the boundary metric. The discrete set-up allows\nagain to identify the dual field with degrees of freedom associated to radial\nbulk edges attached to the boundary. Integrating out this dual field reproduces\nthe (boundary diffeomorphism invariant part of the) quadratic order of the\nHamilton-Jacobi functional. The considerations here show that bulk boundary\ndualities might also emerge at finite boundaries and moreover that discrete\napproaches are helpful in identifying such dualities.\n", "  There is a considerable interest in understanding the dependence of\none-nucleon removal cross sections on the asymmetry of the neutron $S_n$ and\nproton $S_p$ separation energies, following a large amount of experimental data\nand theoretical analyses in a framework of sudden and eikonal approximations of\nthe reaction dynamics. These theoretical calculations involve both the\nsingle-particle cross section and the shell-model description of the projectile\ninitial state and final states of the reaction residues. The configuration\nmixing in shell-model description of nuclear states depends on the proximity of\none-nucleon decay threshold but does it depend sensitively on $S_n - S_p$? To\nanswer this question, we use the shell model embedded in the continuum to\ninvestigate the dependence of one-nucleon spectroscopic factors on the\nasymmetry of $S_n$ and $S_p$ for mirror nuclei $^{24}$Si, $^{24}$Ne and\n$^{28}$S, $^{28}$Mg and for a series of neon isotopes ($20 \\leq A \\leq 28$).\n", "  We present a theoretical study of the unielectronic energy spectra, electron\nlocalization, and optical absorption of triangular core-shell quantum rings. We\nshow how these properties depend on geometric details of the triangle, such as\nside thickness or corners' symmetry. For equilateral triangles, the lowest six\nenergy states (including spin) are grouped in an energy shell, are localized\nonly around corner areas, and are separated by a large energy gap from the\nstates with higher energy which are localized on the sides of the triangle. The\nenergy levels strongly depend on the aspect ratio of the triangle sides, i.e.,\nthickness/length ratio, in such a way that the energy differences are not\nmonotonous functions of this ratio. In particular, the energy gap between the\ngroup of states localized in corners and the states localized on the sides\nstrongly decreases with increasing the side thickness, and then slightly\nincreases for thicker samples. With increasing the thickness the low-energy\nshell remains distinct but the spatial distribution of these states spreads.\nThe behavior of the energy levels and localization leads to a thickness\ndependent absorption spectrum where one transition may be tuned in the THz\ndomain and a second transition can be tuned from THz to the infrared range of\nelectromagnetic spectrum. We show how these features may be further controlled\nwith an external magnetic field. In this work the electron-electron Coulomb\nrepulsion is neglected.\n", "  In the case of using the higher derivative regularization for $N=1$ SQED with\n$N_f$ flavors the loop integrals giving the $\\beta$-function are integrals of\ndouble total derivatives in the momentum space. This feature allows to reduce\none of the loop integrals to an integral of the $\\delta$-function and to derive\nthe NSVZ relation for the renormalization group functions defined in terms of\nthe bare coupling constant. In this paper we consider $N=1$ SQED with $N_f$\nflavors regularized by the dimensional reduction in the\n$\\overline{\\mbox{DR}}$-scheme. Evaluating the scheme-dependent three-loop\ncontribution to the $\\beta$-function proportional to $(N_f)^2$ we find the\nstructures analogous to integrals of the $\\delta$-singularities. After adding\nthe scheme-independent terms proportional to $(N_f)^1$ we obtain the known\nresult for the three-loop $\\beta$-function.\n", "  Previously predicted by the $S$-matrix bootstrap of the excitations over the\nGKP quantum vacuum, the appearance of a new particle at strong coupling --\nformed by one fermion and one anti-fermion -- is here confirmed: this\ntwo-dimensional meson shows up, along with its infinite tower of bound states,\nwhile analysing the fermionic contributions to the Operator Product Expansion\n(collinear regime) of the Wilson null polygon loop. Moreover, its existence,\nfree \\footnote{This term is used here as opposite to bound, thus as {\\it\nunbound}.} and bound, turns out to be a powerful idea in re-summing all the\ncontributions (at large coupling) for a general $n$-gon ($n\\geq 6$) to a\nThermodynamic Bethe Ansatz, which is proven to be equivalent to the known one\nand suggests new structures for a special $Y$-system.\n", "  Accelerating particles to relativistic energies over very short distances\nusing lasers has been a long standing goal in physics. Among the various\nschemes proposed for electrons, vacuum laser acceleration has attracted\nconsiderable interest and has been extensively studied theoretically because of\nits appealing simplicity: electrons interact with an intense laser field in\nvacuum and can be continuously accelerated, provided they remain at a given\nphase of the field until they escape the laser beam. But demonstrating this\neffect experimentally has proved extremely challenging, as it imposes stringent\nrequirements on the conditions of injection of electrons in the laser field.\nHere, we solve this long-standing experimental problem for the first time by\nusing a plasma mirror to inject electrons in an ultraintense laser field, and\nobtain clear evidence of vacuum laser acceleration. With the advent of PetaWatt\nclass lasers, this scheme could provide a competitive source of very high\ncharge (nC) and ultrashort relativistic electron beams.\n", "  In this paper, we propose a novel technique to implement stochastic gradient\nmethods, which are beneficial for learning from large datasets, through\naccelerated stochastic dynamics. A stochastic gradient method is based on\nmini-batch learning for reducing the computational cost when the amount of data\nis large. The stochasticity of the gradient can be mitigated by the injection\nof Gaussian noise, which yields the stochastic Langevin gradient method; this\nmethod can be used for Bayesian posterior sampling. However, the performance of\nthe stochastic Langevin gradient method depends on the mixing rate of the\nstochastic dynamics. In this study, we propose violating the detailed balance\ncondition to enhance the mixing rate. Recent studies have revealed that\nviolating the detailed balance condition accelerates the convergence to a\nstationary state and reduces the correlation time between the samplings. We\nimplement this violation of the detailed balance condition in the stochastic\ngradient Langevin method and test our method for a simple model to demonstrate\nits performance.\n", "  We present a circuit construction for a new fixed-frequency superconducting\nqubit and show how it can be scaled up to a grid with strictly local\ninteractions. The circuit QED realization we propose implements $\\sigma_z$-type\ncoupling between a superconducting qubit and any number of $LC$ resonators. The\nresulting \\textit{longitudinal coupling} is inherently different from the usual\n$\\sigma_x$-type \\textit{transverse coupling}, which is the one that has been\nmost commonly used for superconducting qubits. In a grid of fixed-frequency\nqubits and resonators with a particular pattern of always-on interactions,\ncoupling is strictly confined to nearest and next-nearest neighbor resonators;\nthere is never any direct qubit-qubit coupling. We note that just four distinct\nresonator frequencies, and only a single unique qubit frequency, suffice for\nthe scalability of this scheme. A controlled phase gate between two neighboring\nqubits can be realized with microwave drives on the qubits, without affecting\nthe other qubits. This fact is a supreme advantage for the scalability of this\nscheme.\n", "  We calculate renormalized Higgs boson couplings with gauge bosons and\nfermions at the one-loop level in the model with an additional isospin singlet\nreal scalar field. These coupling constants can deviate from the predictions in\nthe standard model due to tree-level mixing effects and one-loop contributions\nof the extra neutral scalar boson. We investigate how they can be significant\nunder the theoretical constraints from perturbative unitarity and vacuum\nstability and also the condition of avoiding the wrong vacuum. Furthermore,\ncomparing with the predictions in the Type I two Higgs doublet model, we\nnumerically demonstrate how the singlet extension model can be distinguished\nand identified by using precision measurements of the Higgs boson couplings at\nfuture collider experiments.\n", "  We study properties of the full partition function for the $U(1)$ 5D\n$\\mathcal{N}=2^*$ gauge theory with adjoint hypermultiplet of mass $M$. This\ntheory is ultimately related to abelian 6D (2,0) theory. We construct the full\nnon-perturbative partition function on toric Sasaki-Einstein manifolds by\ngluing flat copies of the Nekrasov partition function and we express the full\npartition function in terms of the generalized double elliptic gamma function\n$G_2^C$ associated with a certain moment map cone $C$. The answer exhibits a\ncurious $SL(4,\\mathbb{Z})$ modular property. Finally, we propose a set of rules\nto construct the partition function that resembles the calculation of 5D\nsupersymmetric partition function with the insertion of defects of various\nco-dimensions.\n", "  The last few years have been witness to a proliferation of new results\nconcerning heavy exotic hadrons. Experimentally, many new signals have been\ndiscovered that could be pointing towards the existence of tetraquarks,\npentaquarks, and other exotic configurations of quarks and gluons.\nTheoretically, advances in lattice field theory techniques place us at the cusp\nof understanding complex coupled-channel phenomena, modelling grows more\nsophisticated, and effective field theories are being applied to an ever\ngreater range of situations. It is thus an opportune time to evaluate the\nstatus of the field. In the following, a series of high priority experimental\nand theoretical issues concerning heavy exotic hadrons is presented.\n", "  Within the framework of the fermion-spin theory, the charge transport in the\ndoped Mott insulators on a honeycomb lattice is studied by taking into account\nthe pseudogap effect. It is shown that the conductivity spectrum in the\nlow-doped regime is separated by the pseudogap into a low-energy non-Drude peak\nfollowed by a broad midinfrared band. However, the decrease of the pseudogap\nwith the increase of doping leads to a shift of the position of the midinfrared\nband towards to the low-energy non-Drude peak, and then the low-energy Drude\nbehavior recovers in the high-doped regime. The combined results of both the\ndoped honeycomb-lattice and square-lattice Mott insulators indicate that the\ntwo-component conductivity induced by the pseudogap is a universal feature in\nthe doped Mott insulators.\n", "  From the analysis of the near horizon geometry and supersymmetry algebra it\nhas been argued that all the microstates of single centered BPS black holes\nwith four unbroken supersymmetries carry zero angular momentum in the region of\nthe moduli space where the black hole description is valid. A stronger form of\nthe conjecture would be that the result holds for any sufficiently generic\npoint in the moduli space. In this paper we set out to test this conjecture for\na class of black hole microstates in type II string theory on $T^6$,\nrepresented by four stacks of D-branes wrapped on various cycles of $T^6$. For\nthis system the above conjecture translates to the statement that the moduli\nspace of classical vacua must be a collection of points. Explicit analysis of\nsystems carrying a low number of D-branes supports this conjecture.\n", "  The exact solution, via transfer matrix, of the simple one dimensional\nlattice Coulomb gas (1d LCG) model can reproduce peculiar features of ionic\nliquid capacitors, such as overscreening, layering, and camel- and bell-shaped\ncapacitance curves. Using the same transfer matrix method, we now compute the\nbulk properties of the 1d LCG in the constant voltage ensemble. We unveil a\nphase diagram with rich structure exhibiting a low density disordered and high\ndensity ordered phases, separated by a first order phase transition at low\ntemperature; the solid state at full packing can be ordered or not, depending\non the temperature. This phase diagram, which is strikingly similar to its\nthree dimensional counterpart, also sheds light on the behaviour of the\nconfined system.\n", "  We present and apply a new method to measure directly weak magnetization in\nthin films. The polarization of a neutron beam channeling through a thin film\nstructure is measured after exiting the structure edge as a microbeam. We have\napplied the method to a tri-layer thin film structure acting as a planar\nwaveguide for polarized neutrons. The middle guiding layer is a rare earth\nbased ferrimagnetic material TbCo5 with a low magnetization of about 20 mT. We\ndemonstrate that the channeling method is more sensitive than the specular\nneutron reflection method.\n", "  We study protected correlation functions in $\\mathcal{N} = 2$ SCFT whose\ndescription is captured by a two-dimensional chiral algebra. Our analysis\nimplies a new analytic bound for the $c$-anomaly as a function of the flavor\ncentral charge $k$, valid for any theory with a flavor symmetry $G$. Combining\nour result with older bounds in the literature puts strong constraints on the\nparameter space of $\\mathcal{N}=2$ theories. In particular, it singles out a\nspecial set of models whose value of $c$ is uniquely fixed once $k$ is given.\nThis set includes the canonical rank one $\\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs given by\nKodaira's classification.\n", "  We present a comparative ab initio study of Li and Na insertion in molecular\n(van der Waals) crystals of TCNE (tetracyanoethylene) as well as in covalent\nLi/Na-TCNE crystals. We confirm the structure of previously synthesized\n(covalent) Li-TCNE crystal as well as predict the existence of its Na-TCNE\nanalogue. In the molecular/covalent TCNE crystals, insertion sites are\nidentified with the binding energy of Li and Na up to 2.7/1.8 and 2.6/1.8 eV\nstronger than Li and Na cohesive energy, respectively, in dilute\nconcentrations. Up to 5.5/2.5 and 3/2 Li and Na atoms per TCNE unit can be\ninserted in the molecular/covalent crystals, respectively, while preserving the\nstructure, with maximum voltages, respectively, 3.5/2.2 and 3.3/2.7 V.\nSignificantly, up to capacity of 418 mAh g-1 for both Li and Na in the\nmolecular crystal and 198 mAh g-1 for Li and 177 mAh g-1 for Na in the covalent\ncrystal, the insertion of Li and Na would not lead to reactions with common\nelectrolytes. Tetracyanoethylene-based molecular and covalent crystals could\ntherefore become efficient organic cathode and anode materials for Li and Na\nion batteries.\n", "  We consider ultracold neutron (UCN) sources based on a new method of UCN\nproduction in superfluid helium (4He). The PIK reactor is chosen as a\nperspective example of the application of this idea, which consists of\ninstalling a 4He UCN source in a beam of thermal or cold neutrons and\nsurrounding the source with a moderator-reflector, which plays the role of a\nsource of cold neutrons (CNs) feeding the UCN source. The CN flux in the source\ncan be several times larger than the incident flux, due to multiple neutron\nreflections from the moderator-reflector. We show that such a source at the PIK\nreactor would provide an order of magnitude larger density and production rate\nthan an analogous source at the ILL reactor.\n  We estimate parameters of a 4He source with solid methane (CH4) or/and liquid\ndeuterium (D2) moderator-reflector. We show that such a source with CH4\nmoderator-reflector at the PIK reactor would provide the UCN density of ~1x10^5\n1/cm^3, and the UCN production rate of ~2x10^7 1/s. These values are\nrespectively 1000 and 20 times larger than those for the most intense UCN user\nsource. The UCN density in a source with D2 moderator-reflector would reach the\nvalue of ~2x10^5 1/cm^3, and the UCN production rate would be equal ~8x10^7\n1/s. Installation of such sources in beams of CNs with equal flux would\nslightly increase the density and production rate.\n", "  The addressability of parallel spatially multimode quantum memory for light\nallows one to control independent collective spin waves within the same cold\natomic ensemble. Generally speaking, there are transverse and longitudinal\ndegrees of freedom of the memory that one can address by a proper choice of the\npump (control) field spatial pattern. Here we concentrate on the mutual\nevolution and transformation of quantum states of the longitudinal modes of\ncollective spin coherence in the cavity-based memory scheme. We assume that\nthese modes are coherently controlled by the pump waves of the on--demand\ntransverse profile, that is, by the superpositions of waves propagating in the\ndirections, close to orthogonal to the cavity axis. By the write-in, this\nallows one to couple a time sequence of the incoming quantized signals to a\ngiven set of superpositions of orthogonal spin waves. By the readout, one can\nretrieve quantum states of the collective spin waves that are controllable\nsuperpositions of the initial ones and are on demand coupled to the output\nsignal sequence. In general case, the memory is able to operate as a\ncontrollable delayed multi-port beamsplitter, capable of transformation of the\ndelays, the durations and time shapes of signals in the sequence.\n  We elaborate the theory of such light--matter interface for the spatially\nmultivariate cavity-based off--resonant Raman--type quantum memory. Since in\norder to speed up the manipulation of complex signals in multivariate memories\nit might be of interest to store relatively short light pulses of a given time\nshape, we also address some issues of the cavity-based memory operation beyond\nthe bad cavity limit.\n", "  We study interacting features of $S_N$ Orbifold CFTs. Concentrating on\ncharacters (associated with $S_N$ Orbifold primaries) we first formulate a\nnovel procedure for evaluating them through $GL(\\infty)_+$ tracing. The result\nis a polynomial formula which we show gives results equivalent to those found\nby Bantay. From this we deduce a hierarchy of commuting Hamiltonians featuring\nlocality in the induced space, and nonlinear string-type interactions.\n", "  We report a thorough theoretical investigation on the quantum transport of a\ndisordered four terminal device in the presence of Rashba spin orbit coupling\n(RSOC) in two dimensions. Specifically we compute the behaviour of the\nlongitudinal (charge) conductance, spin Hall conductance and spin Hall\nconductance fluctuation as a function of the strength of disorder and Rashba\nspin orbit interaction using the Landauer Buttiker formalism via Green's\nfunction technique. Our numerical calculations reveal that both the\nconductances diminish with disorder. At smaller values of the RSOC parameter,\nthe longitudinal and spin Hall conductances increase, while both vanish in the\nstrong RSOC limit. The spin current is more drastically affected by both\ndisorder and RSOC than its charge counterpart. The spin Hall conductance\nfluctuation does not show any universality in terms of its value and it depends\non both disorder as well as on the RSOC strength. Thus the spin Hall\nconductance fluctuation has a distinct character compared to the fluctuation in\nthe longitudinal conductance. Further one parameter scaling theory is studied\nto assess the transition to a metallic regime as claimed in literature and we\nfind no confirmation about the emergence of a metallic state induced by RSOC.\n", "  Evolution of the average and local crystal structure of Ca-doped LaMnO$_{3}$\nhas been studied across the metal to insulator (MI) and the orthorhombic to\nrhombohedral (OR) structural phase transitions over a broad temperature range\nfor two Ca concentrations ($x = 0.18; 0.22$). Combined Rietveld and high real\nspace resolution atomic pair distribution function (PDF) analysis of neutron\ntotal scattering data was carried out with aims of exploring the possibility of\nnanoscale phase separation (PS) in relation to MI transition, and charting the\nevolution of local Jahn-Teller (JT) distortion of MnO$_{6}$ octahedra across\nthe OR transition at T$_{S}$ $\\sim$ 720 K. The study utilized explicit\ntwo-phase PDF structural modeling, revealing that away from TMI there is no\nevidence for nanoscale phase coexistence. The local JT-distortions disappear\nabruptly upon crossing into the metallic regime both with doping and\ntemperature, with only small temperature-independent signature of quenched\ndisorder being observable at low temperature as compared to CaMnO$_{3}$. The\nresults hence do not support the percolative scenario for the MI transition in\nLa$_{1-x}$Ca$_{x}$MnO$_{3}$ based on PS, and question its ubiquity in the\nmanganites. In contrast to LaMnO3 that exhibits long range orbital correlations\nand sizeable octahedral distortions at low temperature, the doped samples with\ncompositions straddling the MI boundary exhibit correlations (in the insulating\nregime) limited to only $\\sim$ 1 nm with observably smaller distortions. In $x\n= 0.22$ sample local JT-distortions are found to persist across the OR\ntransition and deep into the R-phase (up to $\\sim$ 1050 K) where they are\ncrystallographically prohibited. Their magnitude and subnanometer spatial\nextent remain unchanged.\n", "  We study aspects of heterotic/F-theory duality for compactifications with\nAbelian gauge symmetries. We consider F-theory on general Calabi-Yau manifolds\nwith a rank one Mordell-Weil group of rational sections. By rigorously\nperforming the stable degeneration limit in a class of toric models, we derive\nboth the Calabi-Yau geometry as well as the spectral cover describing the\nvector bundle in the heterotic dual theory. We carefully investigate the\nspectral cover employing the group law on the elliptic curve in the heterotic\ntheory. We find in explicit examples that there are three different classes of\nheterotic duals that have U(1) factors in their low energy effective theories:\nsplit spectral covers describing bundles with S(U(m) x U(1)) structure group,\nspectral covers containing torsional sections that seem to give rise to bundles\nwith SU(m) x Z_k structure group and bundles with purely non-Abelian structure\ngroups having a centralizer in E_8 containing a U(1) factor. In the former two\ncases, it is required that the elliptic fibration on the heterotic side has a\nnon-trivial Mordell-Weil group. While the number of geometrically massless\nU(1)'s is determined entirely by geometry on the F-theory side, on the\nheterotic side the correct number of U(1)'s is found by taking into account a\nStuckelberg mechanism in the lower-dimensional effective theory. In geometry,\nthis corresponds to the condition that sections in the two half K3 surfaces\nthat arise in the stable degeneration limit of F-theory can be glued together\nglobally.\n", "  We study the spin waves of the triangular skyrmion crystal that emerges in a\ntwo dimensional spin lattice model as a result of the competition between\nHeisenberg exchange, Dzyalonshinkii-Moriya interactions, Zeeman coupling and\nuniaxial anisotropy. The calculated spin wave bands have a finite Berry\ncurvature that, in some cases, leads to non-zero Chern numbers, making this\nsystem topologically distinct from conventional magnonic systems. We compute\nthe edge spin-waves, expected from the bulk-boundary correspondence principle,\nand show that they are chiral, which makes them immune to elastic\nbackscattering. Our results illustrate how topological phases can occur in\nself-generated emergent superlattices at the mesoscale.\n", "  We study the low-temperature physics of the $SU(2)$-symmetric spin-$1/2$\nHeisenberg antiferromagnet on a pyrochlore lattice and find fingerprint\nevidence for the thermal spin-ice state in this frustrated quantum magnet. Our\nconclusions are based on the results of bold diagrammatic Monte Carlo\nsimulations, with good convergence of the skeleton series down to the\ntemperature $T/J=1/6$. The identification of the spin-ice state is done through\na remarkably accurate microscopic correspondence for the static structure\nfactor between the quantum Heisenberg, classical Heisenberg, and Ising models\nat all accessible temperatures, and the characteristic bowtie pattern with\npinch points observed at $T/J=1/6$. The dynamic structure factor at real\nfrequencies (obtained by the analytic continuation of numerical data) is\nconsistent with diffusive spinon dynamics at the pinch points.\n", "  We investigate single and two-component scalar dark matter scenarios in\nclassically scale invariant standard model which is free of the hierarchy\nproblem in the Higgs sector. We show that despite the very restricted space of\nparameters imposed by the scale invariance symmetry, both single and\ntwo-component scalar dark matter models overcome the direct and indirect\nconstraints provided by the Planck/WMAP observational data and the LUX/Xenon100\nexperiment. We comment also on the radiative mass corrections of the\nclassically massless scalon that plays a crucial role in our study.\n", "  We study the family of Einstein-Maxwell instantons associated with the\nKerr-Newman metrics with a positive cosmological constant. This leads to a\nquantisation condition on the masses and charges of the resulting Euclidean\nsolutions.\n", "  We consider the Hamiltonian system consisting of scalar wave field and a\nsingle particle coupled in a translation invariant manner. The point particle\nis subject to an external potential. The stationary solutions of the system are\na Coulomb type wave field centered at those particle positions for which the\nexternal force vanishes. It is assumed that the charge density satisfies the\nWiener condition which is a version of the \"Fermi Golden Rule\". We prove that\nin the large time approximation any finite energy solution, with the initial\nstate close to the some stable stationary solution, is a sum of this stationary\nsolution and a dispersive wave which is a solution of the free wave equation.\n", "  We present next-to-leading order (NLO) predictions including QCD and\nelectroweak (EW) corrections for the production and decay of off-shell\nelectroweak vector bosons in association with up to two jets at the 13 TeV LHC.\nAll possible dilepton final states with zero, one or two charged leptons that\ncan arise from off-shell W and Z bosons or photons are considered. All\npredictions are obtained using the automated implementation of NLO QCD+EW\ncorrections in the OpenLoops matrix-element generator combined with the Munich\nand Sherpa Monte Carlo frameworks. Electroweak corrections play an especially\nimportant role in the context of BSM searches, due to the presence of large EW\nSudakov logarithms at the TeV scale. In this kinematic regime, important\nobservables such as the jet transverse momentum or the total transverse energy\nare strongly sensitive to multijet emissions. As a result, fixed-order NLO\nQCD+EW predictions are plagued by huge QCD corrections and poor theoretical\nprecision. To remedy this problem we present an approximate method that allows\nfor a simple and reliable implementation of NLO EW corrections in the MEPS@NLO\nmultijet merging framework. Using this general approach we present an inclusive\nsimulation of vector-boson production in association with jets that guarantees\nNLO QCD+EW accuracy in all phase space regions involving up to two resolved\njets.\n", "  We discuss recent developments in indirect methods used in nuclear\nastrophysics to determine the capture cross sections and subsequent rates of\nvarious stellar burning processes, when it is difficult to perform the\ncorresponding direct measurements. We discuss in brief, the basic concepts of\nAsymptotic Normalization Coefficients, the Trojan Horse Method, the Coulomb\nDissociation Method, (d,p), and charge-exchange reactions.\n", "  The measurement of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon exhibits a long\nstanding discrepancy compared to the Standard model prediction. In this paper,\nwe concentrate on this issue in the framework of $R$-parity violating Minimal\nsupersymmetric standard model. Such a scenario provides substantial\ncontribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon while satisfying\nconstraints from low energy experimental observables as well as neutrino mass.\nIn addition, we point out that the implication of such operators satisfying\nmuon $g-2$ are immense from the perspective of the LHC experiment, leading to a\nspectacular four muon final state. We propose an analysis in this particular\nchannel which might help to settle the debate of R-parity violation as a\nprobable explanation for $(g-2)_{\\mu}$.\n", "  We obtain point separated Noise Kernel for the Reissner Nordstr\\\"{o}m\nmetric.The Noise Kernel defines the fluctuations of the quantum stress tensor\nand is of central importance to Semiclassical Stochastic Gravity.The metric is\nmodeled as gravitationally collapsing spacetime, by using suitable coordinate\ntransformations, defined earlier. The fluctuations of the quantum stress\ntensor, at the final stage of collapse are then analysed for both, the naked\nsingularity and black hole end states. The behavior of this Noise Kernel, at\nthe Cauchy Horizon for naked singularity shows markedly different behaviour\nfrom self similar Tolman Bondi metric, which was obtained earlier. In the\nlatter a very unique divergence was seen, which does not appear for the\nReissner Nordstr\\\"{o}m metric, here . It is known that the quantum stress\ntensor itself, diverges at the Cauchy Horizon (CH) for both of these metrics .\nIn contrast, it can now be seen that the the fluctuations of the stress tensor\nbehave differently for the two cases. We give a discussion and further\ndirections for investigations of this interesting behaviour in the two cases\n(regarding the collapse scenario).\n", "  In order to improve the particle identification capability of the Beijing\nSpectrometer III (BESIII),t is proposed to upgrade the current endcap\ntime-of-flight (ETOF) detector with multi-gap resistive plate chamber (MRPC)\ntechnology. Aiming at extending ETOF overall time resolution better than 100ps,\nthe whole system including MRPC detectors, new-designed Front End Electronics\n(FEE), CLOCK module, fast control boards and time to digital modules (TDIG),\nwas built up and operated online 3 months under the cosmic ray. The main\npurposes of cosmic ray test are checking the detectors' construction quality,\ntesting the joint operation of all instruments and guaranteeing the performance\nof the system. The results imply MRPC time resolution better than 100$ps$,\nefficiency is about 98$\\%$ and the noise rate of strip is lower than\n1$Hz/$($scm^{2}$) at normal threshold range, the details are discussed and\nanalyzed specifically in this paper. The test indicates that the whole ETOF\nsystem would work well and satisfy the requirements of upgrade.\n", "  The Clifford algebra over the three-dimensional real linear space includes\nits linear structure and its exterior algebra, the subspaces spanned by\nmultivectors of the same degree determine a gradation of the Clifford algebra.\nThrough these geometric notions, natural one-to-one and two-to-one\nhomomorphisms from $\\mbox{SO}(3)$ into $\\mbox{SU}(2)$ are built conventionally,\nand the set of qubits, is identified with a subgroup of $\\mbox{SU}(2)$. These\nconstructions are suitable to be extended to corresponding tensor powers. The\nnotions of qubits, quregisters and qugates are translated into the language of\nsymmetry groups. The corresponding elements to entangled states in the tensor\nproduct of Hilber spaces. realise a notion of entanglement in the tensor\nproduct of symmetry groups.\n", "  We have observed the quench of the lasing at the exceptional point in the\nelectronic circuit system by applying asymmetric gain in the coupled\noscillator. Since there is the analogy between oscillation in laser and\noscilation in the operational amplifier, when the system hits the exceptional\npoint, oscillation stops. This phenomenon is also theoretically investigated.\n", "  We discuss mixed inflaton and spectator field models where both the fields\nare responsible for the observed density fluctuations. We use the current CMB\ndata to constrain both the general mixed model as well as some specific\nrepresentative scenarios, and collate the results with the model predictions\nfor the CMB spectral $\\mu$ distortion. We find the posterior distribution of\n$\\mu$ using MCMC chains and demonstrate that the standard single-field inflaton\nmodel typically predicts $\\mu \\sim 10^{-8}$ with a relatively narrow\ndistribution, whereas for the mixed models, the distribution turns out to be\nmuch broader, and $\\mu$ could be larger by almost an order of magnitude. Hence\nfuture experiments of $\\mu$ distortion could provide a tool for the critical\ntesting of the mixed source models of the primordial perturbation.\n", "  We present the calculation of massless two-loop Master Integrals relevant to\nfive-point amplitudes with one off-shell external leg and derive the complete\nset of planar Master Integrals with five on-mass-shell legs, that contribute to\nmany $2\\to 3$ amplitudes of interest at the LHC, as for instance three jet\nproduction, $\\gamma, V, H +2$ jets etc., based on the Simplified Differential\nEquations approach.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the entanglement entropy for the generalized\ncharged BTZ black hole through the $AdS_{3}/CFT_{2}$ correspondence. Using the\nholographic description of the entanglement entropy for the strip-subsystem in\nboundary $CFT_{2}$, we will find the first law-like relation between the\nvariation of holographic entanglement entropy and the variation of energy of\nthe subsystem in terms of the mass and the electric charge up to the second\norder. We also obtain appropriate counterterms to renormalize the energy tensor\nassociated with the bulk on-shell actions.\n", "  A novel model embedding the two Higgs doublets in the popular two Higgs\ndoublet models into a doublet of a non-abelian gauge group $SU(2)_H$ is\npresented. The Standard Model $SU(2)_L$ right-handed fermion singlets are\npaired up with new heavy fermions to form $SU(2)_H$ doublets, while $SU(2)_L$\nleft-handed fermion doublets are singlets under $SU(2)_H$. Distinctive features\nof this anomaly-free model are: (1) Electroweak symmetry breaking is induced\nfrom spontaneous symmetry breaking of $SU(2)_H$ via its triplet vacuum\nexpectation value; (2) One of the Higgs doublet can be inert, with its neutral\ncomponent being a dark matter candidate as protected by the $SU(2)_H$ gauge\nsymmetry instead of a discrete $Z_2$ symmetry in the usual case; (3) Unlike\nLeft-Right Symmetric Models, the complex gauge fields $(W_1^{\\prime}\\mp i\nW_2^{\\prime})$ (along with other complex scalar fields) associated with the\n$SU(2)_H$ do {\\it not} carry electric charges, while the third component\n$W^{\\prime}_3$ can mix with the hypercharge $U(1)_Y$ gauge field and the third\ncomponent of $SU(2)_L$; (4) Absence of tree level flavour changing neutral\ncurrent is guaranteed by gauge symmetry; and {\\it etc}. In this work, we\nconcentrate on the mass spectra of scalar and gauge bosons in the model.\nConstraints from previous $Z^\\prime$ data at LEP and the Large Hadron Collider\nmeasurements of the Standard Model Higgs mass, its partial widths of\n$\\gamma\\gamma$ and $Z\\gamma$ modes are discussed.\n", "  We analyse in detail the scalar triplet contribution to the low-energy lepton\nflavour violating (LFV) and lepton number violating (LNV) processes within a\nTeV-scale left-right symmetric framework. We show that in both type-I and\ntype-II seesaw dominance for the light neutrino masses, the triplet of mass\ncomparable to or smaller than the largest right-handed neutrino mass scale can\ngive sizeable contribution to the LFV processes, except in the quasi-degenerate\nlimit of light neutrino masses, where a suppression can occur due to\ncancellations. In particular, a moderate value of the heaviest neutrino to\nscalar triplet mass ratio $r\\lesssim {\\cal O}(1)$ is still experimentally\nallowed and can be explored in the future LFV experiments. Similarly, the\ncontribution of a relatively light triplet to the LNV process of neutrinoless\ndouble beta decay could be significant, disfavouring a part of the model\nparameter space otherwise allowed by LFV constraints. Nevertheless, we find\nregions of parameter space consistent with both LFV and LNV searches, for which\nthe values of the total effective neutrino mass can be accessible to the next\ngeneration ton-scale experiments. Such light triplets can also be directly\nsearched for at the LHC, thus providing a complementary probe of this scenario.\nFinally, we also study the implications of the triplet contribution for the\nleft-right symmetric model interpretation of the recent diboson anomaly at the\nLHC.\n", "  We investigate cosmology of massive electrodynamics and explore the\npossibility whether massive photon could provide an explanation of the dark\nenergy. The action is given by the scalar-vector-tensor theory of gravity which\nis obtained by non-minimal coupling of the massive Stueckelberg QED with\ngravity and its cosmological consequences are studied by paying a particular\nattention to the role of photon mass. We find that the theory allows\ncosmological evolution where the radiation- and matter-dominated epochs are\nfollowed by a long period of virtually constant dark energy that closely mimics\n$\\Lambda$CDM model and the main source of the current acceleration is provided\nby the nonvanishing photon mass governed by the relation $\\Lambda\\sim m^2$. A\ndetailed numerical analysis shows that the nonvanishing photon mass of the\norder of $\\sim 10^{-34}$ eV is consistent with the current observations. This\nmagnitude is far less than the most stringent limit on the photon mass\navailable so far, which is of the order of $m \\leq 10^{-27}$eV.\n", "  We study the spreading of two mutually cooperative diseases on different\nnetwork topologies, and with two microscopic realizations, both of which are\nstochastic versions of an SIR type model studied by us recently in mean field\napproximation. There it had been found that cooperativity can lead to\nfirst-order spreading/extinction transitions. However, due to the rapid mixing\nimplied by the mean field assumption, first order transitions required non-zero\ninitial densities of sick individuals. For the stochastic model studied here\nthe results depend strongly on the underlying network. First order transitions\nare found when there are few short but many long loops: (i) No first order\ntransitions exist on trees and on 2-d lattices with local contacts (ii) They do\nexist on Erdos-Renyi (ER) networks, on d-dimensional lattices with d >= 4, and\non 2-d lattices with sufficiently long-ranged contacts; (iii) On 3-d lattices\nwith local contacts the results depend on the microscopic details of the\nimplementation; (iv) While single infected seeds can always lead to infinite\nepidemics on regular lattices, on ER networks one sometimes needs finite\ninitial densities of infected nodes; (v) In all cases the first order\ntransitions are actually \"hybrid\", i.e. they display also power law scaling\nusually associated with second order transitions. On regular lattices, our\nmodel can also be interpreted as the growth of an interface due to cooperative\nattachment of two species of particles. Critically pinned interfaces in this\nmodel seem to be in different universality classes than standard critically\npinned interfaces in models with forbidden overhangs. Finally, the detailed\nresults mentioned above hold only when both diseases propagate along the same\nnetwork of links. If they use different links, results can be rather different\nin detail, but are similar overall.\n", "  In a recent paper we showed that the correlators of free scalar field theory\nin four dimensions can be constructed from a two dimensional topological field\ntheory based on so(4,2) equivariant maps (intertwiners). The free field result,\nalong with results of Frenkel and Libine on equivariance properties of Feynman\nintegrals, are developed further in this paper. We show that the coefficient of\nthe log term in the 1-loop 4-point conformal integral is a projector in the\ntensor product of so(4,2) representations. We also show that the 1-loop 4-point\nintegral can be written as a sum of four terms, each associated with the\nquantum equation of motion for one of the four external legs. The quantum\nequation of motion is shown to be related to equivariant maps involving\nindecomposable representations of so(4,2), a phenomenon which illuminates\nmultiplet recombination. The harmonic expansion method for Feynman integrals is\na powerful tool for arriving at these results. The generalization to other\ninteractions and higher loops is discussed.\n", "  A simplified pure spinor superstring $b$ ghost in a curved heterotic\nbackground was constructed recently. The $b$ ghost is a composite operator and\nit is not holomorphic. However, it satisfies $\\bar\\partial b = [ Q , \\Omega ]$,\nwhere $Q$ is the BRST charge. In this paper, we find a possible $\\Omega$.\n", "  We study pion production by proton synchrotron radiation in the presence of a\nstrong magnetic field when the Landau numbers of the initial and final protons\nare $n_{i,f} \\sim 10^4 - 10^5$. We find in our relativistic field theory\ncalculations that the pion decay width depends only on the field strength\nparameter which previously was only conjectured based upon semi-classical\narguments. Moreover, we also find new results that the decay width satisfies a\nrobust scaling relation, and that the polar angular distribution of emitted\npion momenta is very narrow and can be easily obtained. This scaling implies\nthat one can infer the decay width in more realistic magnetic fields of\n$10^{15}$G, where $n_{i,f} \\sim 10^{12} - 10^{13}$, from the results for\n$n_{i,f} \\sim 10^4 - 10^5$. The resultant pion intensity and angular\ndistributions for realistic magnetic field strengths are presented and their\nphysical implications discussed.\n", "  Linear stability of inviscid, parallel, and stably stratified shear flow is\nstudied under the assumption of smooth strictly monotonic profiles of shear\nflow and density, so that the local Richardson number is positive everywhere.\nThe marginally unstable modes are systematically found by solving a\none-parameter family of regular Sturm-Liouville problems, which can determine\nthe stability boundaries more efficiently than solving the Taylor-Goldstein\nequation directly. By arguing for the non-existence of a marginally unstable\nmode, we derive new sufficient conditions for stability, which generalize the\nRayleigh-Fj{\\o}rtoft criterion for unstratified shear flows.\n", "  Quantum vacuum fluctuations are a direct manifestation of Heisenberg's\nuncertainty principle. The dynamical Casimir effect allows for the observation\nof these vacuum fluctuations by turning them into real, observable photons.\nHowever, the observation of this effect in a cavity QED experiment would\nrequire the rapid variation of the length of a cavity with relativistic\nvelocities, a daunting challenge. Here, we propose a quantum simulation of the\ndynamical Casimir effect using an ion chain confined in a segmented ion trap.\nWe derive a discrete model that enables us to map the dynamics of the multimode\nradiation field inside a variable-length cavity to radial phonons of the ion\ncrystal. We perform a numerical study comparing the ion-chain quantum\nsimulation under realistic experimental parameters to an ideal Fabry-Perot\ncavity, demonstrating the viability of the mapping. The proposed quantum\nsimulator, therefore, allows for probing the photon (respectively phonon)\nproduction caused by the dynamical Casimir effect on the single photon level.\n", "  The influence of nonlinear dynamical effects is analyzed on the observed\nspectra of controversial 3C and 3D astrophysically relevant x-ray lines in\nneonlike Fe${}^{16+}$ and the A, B, C lines in natriumlike Fe${}^{15+}$ ions.\nFirst, a large-scale configuration-interaction calculation of oscillator\nstrengths is performed with the inclusion of higher-order electron-correlation\neffects. Also, quantum-electrodynamic corrections to the transition energies\nare calculated. Further considered dynamical effects provide a possible\nresolution of the discrepancy between theory and experiment found by recent\nx-ray free-electron-laser measurements of these controversial lines. We find\nthat, for strong x-ray sources, the modeling of the spectral lines by a peak\nwith an area proportional to the oscillator strength is not sufficient and\nnonlinear dynamical effects have to be taken into account. Thus, we advocate\nthe use of light-matter-interaction models also valid for strong light fields\nin the analysis and interpretation of the associated astrophysical and\nlaboratory spectra. We investigate line-strength ratios distinguishing between\nthe coherent and incoherent parts of the emission spectrum. In addition, the\nspectrum of Fe${}^{15+}$, an autoionizing ion which was also present in the\nrecent laboratory experiment, is also analized.\n", "  A density-dependent gauge field may induce density-induced geometric\nfrustration, leading to a non-trivial interplay between density modulation and\nfrustration, which we illustrate for the particular case of ultra-cold bosons\nin zig-zag optical lattices with a density-dependent hopping. We show that the\ndensity-induced frustration leads in a rich landscape of quantum phases,\nincluding Mott and bond-order insulators, two-component superfluids, chiral\nsuperfluids, and partially-paired superfluids. We show as well that the\ndensity-dependent hopping results in an effective repulsive or attractive\ninteractions, and that for the latter case the vacuum may be destabilized\nleading to a strong compressibility. Finally, we discuss how the predicted\nphases may be experimentally observed and characterized in time-of-flight\nmeasurements using their characteristic signatures in the momentum\ndistribution.\n", "  A major new release of the Monte Carlo event generator Herwig++ (version 3.0)\nis now available. This release marks the end of distinguishing Herwig++ and\nHERWIG development and therefore constitutes the first major release of version\n7 of the Herwig event generator family. The new version features a number of\nsignificant improvements to the event simulation, including: built-in NLO hard\nprocess calculation for all Standard Model processes, with matching to both\nangular-ordered and dipole shower modules via both subtractive (MC@NLO-type)\nand multiplicative (Powheg-type) algorithms; QED radiation and spin\ncorrelations in the angular ordered shower; a consistent treatment of\nperturbative uncertainties within the hard process and parton showering.\nSeveral of the new features will be covered in detail in accompanying\npublications, and an update of the manual will follow in due course.\n", "  The divergent integral $\\int_a^b f(x)(x-x_0)^{-n-1}\\mathrm{d}x$, for\n$-\\infty<a<x_0<b<\\infty$ and $n=0, 1, 2, \\dots$, is assigned, under certain\nconditions, the value equal to the simple average of the contour integrals\n$\\int_{C^{\\pm}} f(z)(z-x_0)^{-n-1}\\mathrm{d}z$, where $C^+$ ($C^-$) is a path\nthat starts from $a$ and ends at $b$, and which passes above (below) the pole\nat $x_0$. It is shown that this value, which we refer to as the Analytic\nPrincipal Value, is equal to the Cauchy principal value for $n=0$ and to the\nfinite-part of the divergent integral for positive integer $n$. This implies\nthat, where the conditions apply, the Cauchy principal value and the\nfinite-part integral are in fact values of absolutely convergent integrals.\nMoreover, it leads to the replacement of the boundary values in the\nSokhotski-Plemelj-Fox Theorem with integrals along some arbitrary paths. The\nutility of the Analytic Principal Value in the numerical, analytical and\nasymptotic evaluation of the Cauchy principal value and the finite-part\nintegral is discussed and demonstrated.\n", "  We propose an interacting many-body space-time-discrete Markov chain model,\nwhich is composed of an integrable deterministic and reversible cellular\nautomaton (the rule 54 of [Bobenko et al, CMP 158, 127 (1993)]) on a finite\none-dimensional lattice Z_2^n, and local stochastic Markov chains at the two\nlattice boundaries which provide chemical baths for absorbing or emitting the\nsolitons. Ergodicity and mixing of this many-body Markov chain is proven for\ngeneric values of bath parameters, implying existence of a unique\nnon-equilibrium steady state. The latter is constructed exactly and explicitly\nin terms of a particularly simple form of matrix product ansatz which is termed\na patch ansatz. This gives rise to an explicit computation of observables and\n$k$-point correlations in the steady state as well as the construction of a\nnontrivial set of local conservation laws. Feasibility of an exact solution for\nthe full spectrum and eigenvectors (decay modes) of the Markov matrix is\nsuggested as well. We conjecture that our ideas can pave the road towards a\ntheory of integrability of boundary driven classical deterministic lattice\nsystems.\n", "  Optimizing information transmission across a network is an essential task for\ncontrolling and manipulating generic information-processing systems. Here, we\nshow how topological amplification effects in scale-free networks of signaling\ndevices are optimally enhanced when the $\\it{impulse}$ transmitted by periodic\nexternal signals (time integral over two consecutive zeros) is maximum. This is\ndemonstrated theoretically by means of a star-like network of overdamped\nbistable systems subjected to $\\it{generic}$ zero-mean periodic signals, and\nconfirmed numerically by simulations of scale-free networks of such systems.\nOur results show that the enhancer effect of increasing values of the signal's\nimpulse is due to a correlative increase of the energy transmitted by the\nperiodic signals, while it is found to be resonant-like with respect to the\ntopology-induced amplification mechanism.\n", "  In nonrelativistic quantum mechanics the spontaneous generation of\nsingularities in smooth and finite wave functions, is a well understood\nphenomenon also occurring for free particles. We use the familiar analogy\nbetween the two-dimensional Schroedinger equation and the optical paraxial wave\nequation to define a new class of square-integrable paraxial optical fields\nwhich develop a spatial singularity in the focal point of a weakly-focusing\nthin lens. These fields are characterized by a single real parameter whose\nvalue determines the nature of the singularity. This novel field enhancement\nmechanism may stimulate fruitful researches for diverse technological and\nscientific applications.\n", "  We obtain holographic constraints on the microscopic degeneracies of black\nholes by computing the exact macroscopic quantum entropy using localization,\nincluding the effects of string worldsheet instantons in the supergravity\neffective action. For $\\frac14$-BPS black holes in type II string theory on $K3\n\\times T^{2}$, the constraints can be explicitly checked against expressions\nfor the microscopic BPS counting functions that are known in terms of certain\nmock modular forms. We find that the effect of including the infinite sum over\ninstantons in the holomorphic prepotential of the supergravity leads to a sum\nover Bessel functions with successively sub-leading arguments as in the\nRademacher expansion of Jacobi forms -- but begins to disagree with such a\nstructure near an order where the mock modular nature becomes relevant. This\nleads to a systematic method to recover the polar terms of the microscopic\ndegeneracies from the degeneracy of instantons (the Gromov-Witten invariants).\nWe check explicitly that our formula agrees with the known microscopic answer\nfor the first seven values of the magnetic charge invariant.\n", "  We study the relative translation of two arbitrarily shaped objects, caused\nby their hydrodynamic interaction as they are forced through a viscous fluid in\nthe limit of zero Reynolds number. It is well known that in the case of two\nrigid spheres in an unbounded fluid, the hydrodynamic interaction does not\nproduce relative translation. More generally such an effective pair-interaction\nvanishes in configurations with spatial inversion symmetry; for example, an\nenantiomorphic pair in mirror image positions has no relative translation. We\nshow that the breaking of inversion symmetry by boundaries of the system\naccounts for the interactions between two spheres in confined geometries, as\nobserved in experiments. The same general principle also provides new\npredictions for interactions in other object configurations near obstacles. We\nexamine the time-dependent relative translation of two self-aligning objects,\nextending the numerical analysis of our preceding publication [Goldfriend,\nDiamant and Witten, Phys. Fluids 27, 123303 (2015)]. The interplay between the\norientational interaction and the translational one, in most cases, leads over\ntime to repulsion between the two objects. The repulsion is qualitatively\ndifferent for self-aligning objects compared to the more symmetric case of\nuniform prolate spheroids. The separation between the two objects increases\nwith time $t$ as $t^{1/3}$ in the former case, and more strongly, as $t$, in\nthe latter.\n", "  Free-field formalism for quantum groups provides a special choice of\ncoordinates on a quantum group. In these coordinates the construction of\nassociated integrable system is especially simple. This choice also fits into\ngeneral framework of cluster varieties -- natural changes of coordinates are\ncluster mutations.\n", "  We present a simple but effective method to measure the pressure inside a\ndeformable micro-channel using laser scattering in a translucent Scotch tape.\nOur idea exploits the fact that the speckle pattern generated by a turbid layer\nis sensitive to the changes in an optical wavefront of an impinging beam. A\nchange in the internal pressure of a channel deforms the elastic channel, which\ncan be detected by measuring speckle patterns of a coherent laser that has\npassed through the channel and the Scotch tape. We demonstrate that internal\npressure can be remotely sensed with the resolution below 0.1 kPa within a\npressure range of 3 kPa after calibration. With its high sensitivity,\nreproducibility, and easy applicability, the present method will find direct\nand diverse applications.\n", "  Gas electron multiplier(GEM) detector is used in Cosmic Muon Scattering\nTomography and neutron imaging in the last decade. In this work, a triple GEM\ndevice with an effective readout area of 10 cm X 10 cm is developed, and an\nexperiment of discriminating between cosmic muon and x-ray based on rising time\nis tested. The energy resolution of GEM detector is tested by 55Fe ray source\nto prove the GEM detector has a good performance. The analysis of the complete\nsignal-cycles allows to get the rising time and pulse heights. The experiment\nresult indicates that cosmic muon and x-ray can be discriminated with an\nappropriate rising time threshold.\n", "  Using a Lagrangian framework, we study overdamping phenomena in gyroscopic\nsystems composed of two components, one of which is highly lossy and the other\nis lossless. The losses are accounted by a Rayleigh dissipative function. As we\nhave shown previously, for such a composite system the modes split into two\ndistinct classes, high-loss and low-loss, according to their dissipative\nbehavior. A principal result of this paper is that for any such system a rather\nuniversal phenomenon of selective overdamping occurs. Namely, first of all the\nhigh-loss modes are all overdamped, i.e., non-oscillatory, as are an equal\nnumber of low-loss modes. Second of all, the rest of the low-loss modes remain\noscillatory (i.e., the underdamped modes) each with an extremely high quality\nfactor (Q-factor) that actually increases as the loss of the lossy component\nincreases. We prove that selective overdamping is a generic phenomenon in\nLagrangian systems with gyroscopic forces and give an analysis of the\noverdamping phenomena in such systems. Moreover, using perturbation theory, we\nderive explicit formulas for upper bound estimates on the amount of loss\nrequired in the lossy component of the composite system for the selective\noverdamping to occur in the generic case, and give Q-factor estimates for the\nunderdamped modes. Central to the analysis is the introduction of the notion of\na \"dual\" Lagrangian system and this yields significant improvements on some\nresults on modal dichotomy and overdamping. The effectiveness of the theory\ndeveloped here is demonstrated by applying it to an electric circuit with a\ngyrator element and a high-loss resistor.\n", "  The multidimensional energy surface of a cholesteric liquid crystal in a\nplanar cell is investigated as a function of spherical coordinates determining\nthe director orientation. Minima on the energy surface correspond to the stable\nstates with particular director distribution. External electric and magnetic\nfields deform the energy surface and positions of minima. It can lead to the\ntransitions between states, known as the Fr\\'{e}edericksz effect. Transitions\ncan be continuous or discontinuous depending on parameters of the liquid\ncrystal which determine an energy surface. In a case of discontinuous\ntransition when a barrier between stable states is comparable with the thermal\nenergy, the activation transitions may occur and it leads to the modification\nof characteristics of the Fr\\'{e}edericksz effect with temperature without\nexplicit temperature dependencies of liquid crystal parameters. Minimum energy\npath between stable states on the energy surface for the Fr\\'{e}edericksz\ntransition is found using geodesic nudged elastic band method. Knowledge of\nthis path, which has maximal statistical weight among all other paths, gives\nthe information about a barrier between stable states and configuration of\ndirector orientation during the transition. It also allows one to estimate the\nstability of states with respect to the thermal fluctuations and their lifetime\nwhen the system is close to the Fr\\'{e}edericksz transition.\n", "  The core momentum distribution of a weakly-bound neutron-neutron-core exotic\nnucleus is computed within a renormalized zero-range three-body model, with\ninteractions in the s-wave channel. The halo wave-function in momentum space is\nobtained by using as inputs the two-body scattering lengths and the two-neutron\nseparation energy. The core momentum densities are computed for $^{11}$Li,\n$^{14}$Be $^{20}$C and $^{22}$C. The model describes the experimental data for\n$^{11}$Li, $^{14}$Be and to some extend $^{20}$C. The recoil momentum\ndistribution of the $^{20}$C from the breakup of $^{22}$C nucleus is computed\nfor different two-neutron separation energies, and from the comparison with\nrecent experimental data the two-neutron separation energy is estimated in the\nrange $100\\lesssim S_{2n}\\lesssim 400$ KeV. The recoil momentum distribution\ndepends weakly on the neutron-$^{20}$C scattering length, while the matter\nradius is strongly sensitive to it. The expected universality of the momentum\ndistribution width is verified by also considering excited states for the\nsystem.\n", "  The Fisher-Rao metric from Information Geometry is related to phase\ntransition phenomena in classical statistical mechanics. Several studies\npropose to extend the use of Information Geometry to study more general phase\ntransitions in complex systems. However, it is unclear whether the Fisher-Rao\nmetric does indeed detect these more general transitions, especially in the\nabsence of a statistical model. In this paper we study the transitions between\npatterns in the Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion model using Fisher information.\nWe describe the system by a probability density function that represents the\nsize distribution of blobs in the patterns and compute its Fisher information\nwith respect to changing the two rate parameters of the underlying model. We\nestimate the distribution non-parametrically so that we do not assume any\nstatistical model. The resulting Fisher map can be interpreted as a phase-map\nof the different patterns. Lines with high Fisher information can be considered\nas boundaries between regions of parameter space where patterns with similar\ncharacteristics appear. These lines of high Fisher information can be\ninterpreted as phase transitions between complex patterns.\n", "  We introduce a new formalism to study perturbations of Hassan-Rosen bigravity\ntheory, around general backgrounds for the two dynamical metrics. In\nparticular, we derive the general expression for the mass term of the\nperturbations and we explicitly compute it for cosmological settings. We study\ntensor perturbations in a specific branch of bigravity using this formalism. We\nshow that the tensor sector is affected by a late-time instability, which sets\nin when the mass matrix is no longer positive definite.\n", "  Hydrodynamic calculations of ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions are\nperformed using the iEBE-VISHNU 2+1D code with fluctuating initial conditions\nand three different parameterizations of the Lattice QCD equations of state:\ncontinuum extrapolations for stout and HISQ/tree actions, as well as the\ns95p-v1 parameterization based upon calculations using the p4 action. All\nparameterizations are matched to a hadron resonance gas equation of state at T\n= 155 MeV, at which point the calculations are continued using the UrQMD\nhadronic cascade. Calculations for $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV Au+Au collisions in\nthree centrality classes are compared to experimental data for final state\nparticle spectra and anisotropic flow coefficients $v_2$ and $v_3$ as well as\nfor pion HBT radii. Experimental observables for the stout and HISQ/tree\nequations of state are observed to differ by less than a few percent for all\nobservables, while the s95p-v1 equation of state generates spectra and flow\ncoefficients which differ by ~10-20%. Calculations in which the HISQ/tree\nequation of state is sampled from the published error distribution are also\nobserved to differ by less than a few percent.\n", "  The efficiency of ultra violet LEDs is critically limited by the absorption\nlosses in p-type and metal layers. In this work, surface roughening based light\nextraction structures are combined with tunneling-based top-contacts to realize\nhighly efficient top-side light extraction efficiency in UV LEDs. Surface\nroughening of the top n-type AlGaN contact layer is demonstrated using\nself-assembled Ni nano-clusters as etch mask. The top surface roughened LEDs\nwere found to enhance external quantum efficiency by over 40% for UV LEDs with\na peak emission wavelength of 326 nm. The method described here can enable\nhighly efficient UV LEDs without the need for complex manufacturing methods\nsuch as flip chip bonding.\n", "  Proton spin is investigated in chiral effective field theory through an\nexamination of the singlet axial charge, $a_0$, and the two non-singlet axial\ncharges, $a_3$ and $a_8$. Finite-range regularization is considered as it\nprovides an effective model for estimating the role of disconnected sea-quark\nloop contributions to baryon observables. Baryon octet and decuplet\nintermediate states are included to enrich the spin and flavour structure of\nthe nucleon, redistributing spin under the constraints of chiral symmetry. In\nthis context, the proton spin puzzle is well understood with the calculation\ndescribing all three of the axial charges reasonably well. The strange quark\ncontribution to the proton spin is negative with magnitude 0.01. With\nappropriate $Q^2$ evolution, we find the singlet axial charge at the\nexperimental scale to be ${\\hat a}_0 = 0.31^{+0.04}_{-0.05}$, consistent with\nthe range of current experimental values.\n", "  We report on an exploratory lattice study on the phenomenon of chiral\ninstabilities in non-Abelian gauge theories at high temperature. It is based on\na recently constructed anomalous Langevin-type effective theory of classical\nsoft gauge fields in the presence of a chiral number density $n_5=n_{\\rm\nR}-n_{\\rm L}$. Evaluated in thermal equilibrium using classical lattice\ntechniques it reveals that the fluctuating soft fields indeed exhibit a rapid\nenergy increase at early times and we observe a clear dependence of the\ndiffusion rate of topological charge (sphaleron rate) on the the initial $n_5$,\nrelevant in both early universe baryogenesis and relativistic heavy-ion\ncollisions. The topological charge furthermore shows a drift among distinct\nvacuum sectors, roughly proportional to the initial $n_5$ and in turn the\nchiral imbalance is monotonously reduced as required by helicity conservation.\n", "  A free-falling absorbing liquid drop hit by a nanosecond laser-pulse\nexperiences a strong recoil-pressure kick. As a consequence, the drop propels\nforward and deforms into a thin sheet which eventually fragments. We study how\nthe drop deformation depends on the pulse shape and drop properties. We first\nderive the velocity field inside the drop on the timescale of the pressure\npulse, when the drop is still spherical. This yields the kinetic-energy\npartition inside the drop, which precisely measures the deformation rate with\nrespect to the propulsion rate, before surface tension comes into play. On the\ntimescale where surface tension is important the drop has evolved into a thin\nsheet. Its expansion dynamics is described with a slender-slope model, which\nuses the impulsive energy-partition as an initial condition. Completed with\nboundary integral simulations, this two-stage model explains the entire drop\ndynamics and its dependance on the pulse shape: for a given propulsion, a\ntightly focused pulse results in a thin curved sheet which maximizes the\nlateral expansion, while a uniform illumination yields a smaller expansion but\na flat symmetric sheet, in good agreement with experimental observations.\n", "  A permutation-invariant code on m qubits is a subspace of the symmetric\nsubspace of the m qubits. We derive permutation-invariant codes that can encode\nan increasing amount of quantum information while suppressing leading order\nspontaneous decay errors. To prove the result, we use elementary number theory\nwith prior theory on permutation invariant codes and quantum error correction.\n", "  It is well known that charged particles stored in a Paul trap, one of the\nmost versatile tools in atomic and molecular physics, may undergo a phase\ntransition from a disordered cloud state to a geometrically well-ordered\ncrystalline state (the Wigner crystal). In this paper we show that the average\nlifetime $\\bar\\tau_m$ of the metastable cloud state preceding the cloud\n$\\rightarrow$ crystal phase transition follows a powerlaw, $\\bar\\tau_m \\sim\n(\\gamma-\\gamma_c)^{-\\beta}$, $\\gamma>\\gamma_c$, where $\\gamma_c$ is the\ncritical value of the damping constant $\\gamma$ at which the cloud\n$\\rightarrow$ crystal phase transition occurs. The critical exponent $\\beta$\ndepends on the trap control parameter $q$, but is independent of the number of\nparticles $N$ stored in the trap and the trap control parameter $a$, which\ndetermines the shape (oblate, prolate, or spherical) of the cloud. For\n$q=0.15,0.20$, and $0.25$, we find $\\beta=1.20\\pm 0.03$, $\\beta=1.61\\pm 0.09$,\nand $\\beta=2.38\\pm 0.12$, respectively. In addition we find that for given $a$\nand $q$, the critical value $\\gamma_c$ of the damping scales approximately like\n$\\gamma_c=C \\ln [ \\ln (N)] + D$ as a function of $N$, where $C$ and $D$ are\nconstants. Beyond their relevance for Wigner crystallization of nonneutral\nplasmas in Paul traps and mini storage rings, we conjecture that our results\nare also of relevance for the field of crystalline beams.\n", "  In this paper we introduce a variant of the honeycomb lattice in which we\ncreate defects by randomly exchanging adjacent bonds, producing a random tiling\nwith a distribution of polygon edges. We study the percolation properties on\nthese lattices as a function of the number of exchanged bonds using a novel\ncomputational method. We find the site and bond percolation thresholds are\nconsistent with other three-coordinated lattices with the same standard\ndeviation in the degree distribution of the dual; here we can produce a\ncontinuum of lattices with a range of standard deviations in the distribution.\nThese lattices should be useful for modeling other properties of random systems\nas well as percolation.\n", "  We show that there exists an infinite tower of fermionic symmetries in pure\n$d=4$, $\\mathcal{N}=1$ supergravity on an asymptotically flat background. The\nWard identities associated with these symmetries are equivalent to the soft\nlimit of the gravitino and to the statement of supersymmetry at every angle.\nAdditionally, we show that these charges commute into charges associated with\nthe (unextended) BMS group, providing a supersymmetrization of the BMS\ntranslations.\n", "  Hexagonal boron nitride is a wide bandgap semiconductor with a very high\nthermal and chemical stability often used in devices operating under extreme\nconditions. The growth of high-purity crystals has recently revealed the\npotential of this material for deep ultraviolet emission, with an intense\nemission around 215 nm. In the last few years, hexagonal boron nitride has been\nraising even more attention with the emergence of two-dimensional atomic\ncrystals and Van der Waals heterostructures, initiated with the discovery of\ngraphene. Despite this growing interest and a seemingly simple structure, the\nbasic questions of the bandgap nature and value are still controversial. Here,\nwe resolve this long-debated issue by bringing the evidence for an indirect\nbandgap at 5.955 eV by means of optical spectroscopy. We demonstrate the\nexistence of phonon-assisted optical transitions, and we measure an exciton\nbinding energy of about 130 meV by two-photon spectroscopy.\n", "  We consider the problem of quantization of the bosonic membrane via the large\n$N$ limit of its matrix regularizations $H_N$ in Fock space. We prove that\nthere exists a choice of the Fock space frequency such that $ H_N$ can be\nwritten as a sum of a non-interacting Hamiltonian $H_{0,N}$ and the original\nnormal ordered quartic potential. Using this decomposition we obtain upper and\nlower bounds for the ground state energy in the planar limit, we study a\nperturbative expansion about the spectrum of $H_{0,N}$, and show that the\nspectral gap remains finite at $N=\\infty$ at least up to the second order. We\nalso apply the method to the $U(N)$-invariant anharmonic oscillator, and\ndemonstrate that our bounds agree with the exact result of Brezin et al.\n", "  We apply clustering-based redshift inference to all extended sources from the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey photometric catalogue, down to magnitude r = 22. We\nmap the relationships between colours and redshift, without assumption of the\nsources' spectral energy distributions (SED). We identify and locate\nstar-forming, quiescent galaxies, and AGN, as well as colour changes due to\nspectral features, such as the 4000 \\AA{} break, redshifting through specific\nfilters. Our mapping is globally in good agreement with colour-redshift tracks\ncomputed with SED templates, but reveals informative differences, such as the\nneed for a lower fraction of M-type stars in certain templates. We compare our\nclustering-redshift estimates to photometric redshifts and find these two\nindependent estimators to be in good agreement at each limiting magnitude\nconsidered. Finally, we present the global clustering-redshift distribution of\nall Sloan extended sources, showing objects up to z ~ 0.8. While the overall\nshape agrees with that inferred from photometric redshifts, the clustering\nredshift technique results in a smoother distribution, with no indication of\nstructure in redshift space suggested by the photometric redshift estimates\n(likely artifacts imprinted by their spectroscopic training set). We also infer\na higher fraction of high redshift objects. The mapping between the four\nobserved colours and redshift can be used to estimate the redshift probability\ndistribution function of individual galaxies. This work is an initial step\ntowards producing a general mapping between redshift and all available\nobservables in the photometric space, including brightness, size,\nconcentration, and ellipticity.\n", "  We present a class of Rashba systems in hexagonal semiconducting compounds,\nwhere an electrical control over spin-orbital texture is provided by their bulk\nferroelectricity. Our first-principles calculations reveal a number of such\nmaterials with large Rashba coefficients. We, furthermore, show that strain can\ndrive a topological phase transition in such materials, resulting in a\nferroelectric topological insulating state. Our findings can open avenues for\ninterplay between Rashba effect, ferroelectricity and topological phenomena.\n", "  When thinned down to the atomic scale, many layered van der Waals materials\nexhibit an interesting evolution of their electronic properties, whose main\naspects can be accounted for by changes in the single-particle band structure.\nPhenomena driven by interactions are also observed, but identifying\nexperimentally systematic trends in their thickness dependence is challenging.\nHere, we explore the evolution of gate-induced superconductivity in exfoliated\nMoS2 multilayers ranging from bulk-like to individual monolayers. We observe a\nclear transition for all the thicknesses down to the ultimate atomic limit,\nproviding the first demonstration of superconductivity in atomically thin\nexfoliated crystals. Additionally, we characterize the superconducting state by\nmeasuring the critical temperature (TC) and magnetic field (BC) in a large\nnumber of multilayer devices, upon decreasing their thickness. The\nsuperconducting properties change smoothly down to bilayers, and a pronounced\nreduction in TC and BC is found to occur when going from bilayers to\nmonolayers, for which we discuss possible microscopic mechanisms. Finding that\ngate-induced superconductivity persists in individual monolayers, which form\nthe basic building blocks of more sophisticated van der Waals heterostructures,\nopens new possibilities for the engineering of the electronic properties of\nmaterials at the atomic scale.\n", "  The quark-line disconnected diagram is a potentially important ingredient in\nlattice QCD calculations of the hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to\nthe anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. It is also a notoriously difficult\none to evaluate. Here, for the first time, we give an estimate of this\ncontribution based on lattice QCD results that have a statistically significant\nsignal, albeit at one value of the lattice spacing and an unphysically heavy\nvalue of the $u/d$ quark mass. We use HPQCD's method of determining the\nanomalous magnetic moment by reconstructing the Adler function from\ntime-moments of the current-current correlator at zero spatial momentum. Our\nresults lead to a total (including $u$, $d$ and $s$ quarks) quark-line\ndisconnected contribution to $a_{\\mu}$ of $-0.15\\%$ of the $u/d$ hadronic\nvacuum polarization contribution with an uncertainty which is 1\\% of that\ncontribution.\n", "  We investigate a method of selectively targeting cancer cells by means of\nultrasound harmonic excitation at their resonance frequency, which we refer to\nas oncotripsy. The geometric model of the cells takes into account the\ncytoplasm, nucleus and nucleolus, as well as the plasma membrane and nuclear\nenvelope. Material properties are varied within a pathophysiologically-relevant\nrange. A first modal analysis reveals the existence of a spectral gap between\nthe natural frequencies and, most importantly, resonant growth rates of healthy\nand cancerous cells. The results of the modal analysis are verified by\nsimulating the fully-nonlinear transient response of healthy and cancerous\ncells at resonance. The fully nonlinear analysis confirms that cancerous cells\ncan be selectively taken to lysis by the application of carefully tuned\nultrasound harmonic excitation while simultaneously leaving healthy cells\nintact.\n", "  We evaluate one-loop partition functions of higher-spin fields in thermal\nflat space with angular potentials; this computation is performed in arbitrary\nspace-time dimension, and the result is a simple combination of Poincar\\'e\ncharacters. We then focus on dimension three, showing that suitable products of\none-loop partition functions coincide with vacuum characters of higher-spin\nasymptotic symmetry algebras at null infinity. These are extensions of the\nbms_3 algebra that emerges in pure gravity, and we propose a way to build their\nunitary representations and to compute the associated characters. We also\nextend our investigations to supergravity and to a class of gauge theories\ninvolving higher-spin fermionic fields.\n", "  For the asymmetric spherical dimer of an endohedrally confined atom and a\nhost fullerene, an innershell vacancy of either system can decay through the\ncontinuum of an outer electron hybridized between the systems. Such decays,\nviewed as coherent superpositions of the single-center Auger and two-center\ninter-Coulombic (ICD) amplitudes, are found to govern leading decay mechanisms\nin noble-gas endofullerenes, and are likely omnipresent in this class of\nnanomolecules. A comparison between resulting autoionizing resonances\ncalculated in the photoionization of Ar@C60 and Kr@C60 exhibits details of the\nunderlying processes.\n", "  Understanding the phases of strongly correlated quantum matter is challenging\nbecause they arise from the subtle interplay between kinetic energy,\ninteractions, and dimensionality. In this quest it has turned out that even\nconceptually simple models of strongly correlated fermions, which often only\napproximately represent the physics of the solid state, are very hard to solve.\nSince the conjecture by P. W. Anderson that the two-dimensional Hubbard model\ndescribes the main features of high-T$_c$ superconductivity in the cuprates,\nthere has been a major, yet inconclusive, research effort on determining its\nfundamental thermodynamic properties. Here we present an experimental\ndetermination of the equation of state of the repulsive two-dimensional Hubbard\nmodel over a broad range of interactions, $0\\leq U/t \\lesssim 20$, and\ntemperatures, down to $k_BT/t=0.63(2)$, using high-resolution imaging of\nultracold atoms in optical lattices. The equation of state fully characterizes\nthe thermodynamics of the Hubbard model, and our results constitute benchmarks\nfor state-of-the-art theoretical approaches.\n", "  We theoretically investigate two-particle and many-particle Anderson\nlocalizations of a spin-orbit coupled ultracold atomic Fermi gas trapped in a\nquasi-periodic potential and subjected to an out-of-plane Zeeman field. We\nsolve exactly the two-particle problem in a finite length system by exact\ndiagonalization and solve approximately the many-particle problem within the\nmean-field Bogoliubov-de Gennes approach. At a small Zeeman field, the\nlocalization properties of the system are similar to that of a Fermi gas with\nconventional $s$-wave interactions. As the disorder strength increases, the\ntwo-particle binding energy increases and the fermionic superfluidity of many\nparticles disappears above a threshold. At a large Zeeman field, where the\ninteratomic interaction behaves effectively like a $p$-wave interaction, the\nbinding energy decreases with increasing disorder strength and the resulting\ntopological superfluidity shows a much more robust stability against disorder\nthan the conventional $s$-wave superfluidity. We also analyze the localization\nproperties of the emergent Majorana fermions in the topological phase. Our\nresults could be experimentally examined in future cold-atom experiments, where\nthe spin-orbit coupling can be induced artificially by using two Raman lasers,\nand the quasi-periodic potential can be created by using bichromatic optical\nlattices.\n", "  We discuss the behaviour of holographic entanglement entropy following a\nlocal quench in 2+1 dimensional strongly coupled CFTs. The entanglement\ngenerated by the quench propagates along an emergent light-cone, reminiscent of\nthe Lieb-Robinson light-cone propagation of correlations in non-relativistic\nsystems. We find the speed of propagation is bounded from below by the\nentanglement tsunami velocity obtained earlier for global quenches in\nholographic systems, and from above by the speed of light. The former is\nrealized for sufficiently broad quenches, while the latter pertains for well\nlocalized quenches. The non-universal behavior in the intermediate regime\nappears to stem from finite-size effects. We also note that the entanglement\nentropy of subsystems reverts to the equilibrium value exponentially fast, in\ncontrast to a much slower equilibration seen in certain spin models.\n", "  In this note we study four dimensional theories with N=3 superconformal\nsymmetry, that do not also have N=4 supersymmetry. No examples of such theories\nare known, but their existence is also not ruled out. We analyze several\nproperties that such theories must have. We show that their conformal anomalies\nobey a=c. Using the N=3 superconformal algebra, we show that they do not have\nany exactly marginal deformations preserving N=3 supersymmetry, or global\nsymmetries (except for their R-symmetries). Finally, we analyze the possible\ndimensions of chiral operators labeling their moduli space.\n", "  We address the dynamics of quantum correlations for a bipartite\ncontinuous-variable quantum system interacting with its fluctuating\nenvironment. In particular, we consider two independent quantum oscillators\ninitially prepared in a Gaussian state, e.g. a squeezed thermal state, and\ncompare the dynamics resulting from local noise, i.e. oscillators coupled to\ntwo independent external fields, to that originating from common noise, i.e.\noscillators interacting with a single common field. We prove non-Markovianity\n(non-divisibility) of the dynamics in both regimes and analyze the connections\nbetween non-divisibility, backflow of information and revivals of quantum\ncorrelations. Our main results may be summarized as follows: (i) revivals of\nquantumness are present in both scenarios, however, the interaction with a\ncommon environment better preserves the quantum features of the system; (ii)\nthe dynamics is always non-divisible but revivals of quantum correlations are\npresent only when backflow of information is present as well. We conclude that\nnon-divisibility in its own is not a resource to preserve quantum correlations\nin our system, i.e. it is not sufficient to observe recoherence phenomena.\nRather, it represents a necessary prerequisite to obtain backflow of\ninformation, which is the true ingredient to obtain revivals of quantumness.\n", "  We construct a covariant generating function for the spectrum of chiral\nprimaries of symmetric orbifold conformal field theories with N=(4,4)\nsupersymmetry in two dimensions. For seed target spaces K3 and T4, the\ngenerating functions capture the SO(21) and SO(5) representation theoretic\ncontent of the chiral ring respectively. Via string dualities, we relate the\ntransformation properties of the chiral ring under these isometries of the\nmoduli space to the Lorentz covariance of perturbative string partition\nfunctions in flat space.\n", "  Holographic systems require monogamous mutual information for validity of\nsemiclassical geometry. This is encoded by the sign of the tripartite\ninformation ($I3$). We investigate the behaviour of $I3$ for all partitionings\nof systems in states which are highly entangled in a multipartite or bipartite\nsense. In the case of multipartite entanglement we propose an algorithmic\nconstruction that we conjecture can be used to build local maxima of $I3$ for\nany partitioning. In case of bipartite entanglement we classify the possible\nvalues of $I3$ for perfect states and investigate, in some examples, the effect\non its sign definiteness due to deformations of the states. Finally we comment\non the proposal of using $I3$ as a parameter of scrambling, arguing that in\ngeneral its average over qubits permutations could be a more sensible measure.\n", "  We assess the accuracy of finite-temperature mean-field theory using as a\nstandard the Hamiltonian and model space of the shell model Monte Carlo\ncalculations. Two examples are considered: the nucleus $^{162}$Dy, representing\na heavy deformed nucleus, and $^{148}$Sm, representing a nearby heavy spherical\nnucleus with strong pairing correlations. The errors inherent in the\nfinite-temperature Hartree-Fock and Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approximations are\nanalyzed by comparing the entropies of the grand canonical and canonical\nensembles, as well as the level density at the neutron resonance threshold,\nwith shell model Monte Carlo (SMMC) calculations, which are accurate up to\nwell-controlled statistical errors. The main weak points in the mean-field\ntreatments are seen to be: (i) the extraction of number-projected densities\nfrom the grand canonical ensembles, and (ii) the symmetry breaking by\ndeformation or by the pairing condensate. In the absence of a pairing\ncondensate, we confirm that the usual saddle-point approximation to extract the\nnumber-projected densities is not a significant source of error compared to\nother errors inherent to the mean-field theory. We also present an alternative\nformulation of the saddle-point approximation that makes direct use of an\napproximate particle-number projection and avoids computing the usual\nthree-dimensional Jacobian of the saddle-point integration. We find that the\npairing condensate is less amenable to approximate particle-number projection\nmethods due to the explicit violation of particle-number conservation in the\npairing condensate. Nevertheless, the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory is\naccurate to less than one unit of entropy for $^{148}$Sm at the neutron\nthreshold energy, which is above the pairing phase transition.\n", "  High-intensity neutrino beam facilities may produce a beam of light dark\nmatter when protons strike the target. Searches for such a dark matter beam\nusing its scattering in a nearby detector must overcome the large neutrino\nbackground. We characterize the spatial and energy distributions of the dark\nmatter and neutrino beams, focusing on their differences to enhance the\nsensitivity to dark matter. We find that a dark matter beam produced by a $Z'$\nboson in the GeV mass range is both broader and more energetic than the\nneutrino beam. The reach for dark matter is maximized for a detector sensitive\nto hard neutral-current scatterings, placed at a sizable angle off the neutrino\nbeam axis. In the case of the Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF), a\ndetector placed at roughly 6 degrees off axis and at a distance of about 200 m\nfrom the target would be sensitive to $Z'$ couplings as low as 0.05. This\nsearch can proceed symbiotically with neutrino measurements. We also show that\nthe MiniBooNE and MicroBooNE detectors, which are on Fermilab's Booster\nbeamline, happen to be at an optimal angle from the NuMI beam and could perform\nsearches with existing data. This illustrates potential synergies between LBNF\nand the short-baseline neutrino program if the detectors are positioned\nappropriately.\n", "  Based on both the constituent quark picture and the instanton model for QCD\nvacuum, we calculate the unpolarized and polarized gluon distributions in the\nconstituent quark and in the nucleon. Our approach consists of the two main\nsteps. At the first step, we calculate the gluon distributions inside the\nconstituent quark generated by the perturbative quark-gluon interaction, the\nnon-perturbative quark-gluon interaction, and the non-perturbative\nquark-gluon-pion anomalous chromomagnetic interaction. The non-perturbative\ninteractions are related to the existence of the instantons, strong topological\nfluctuations of gluon fields, in the QCD vacuum. At the second step, the\nconvolution model is applied to derive the gluon distributions in the nucleon.\nA very important role of the pion field in producing the unpolarized and the\npolarized gluon distributions in the hadrons is discovered. We discuss a\npossible solution of the proton spin problem.\n", "  In a typical single molecule experiment, dynamics of an unfolded proteins is\nstudied by determining the reconfiguration time using long-range Forster\nresonance energy transfer where the reconfiguration time is the characteristic\ndecay time of the position correlation between two residues of the protein. In\nthis paper we theoretically calculate the reconfiguration time for a single\nflexible polymer in presence of active noise. The study suggests that though\nthe MSD grows faster, the chain reconfiguration is always slower in presence of\nlong-lived active noise with exponential temporal correlation. Similar behavior\nis observed for a worm like semi-flexible chain and a Zimm chain. However it is\nprimarily the characteristic correlation time of the active noise and not the\nstrength that controls the increase in the reconfiguration time. In a nutshell,\nsuch active noise makes the polymer to move faster but the correlation loss\nbetween the monomers becomes slower.\n", "  A first attempt to accommodate the chiral and deconfining phase transitions\nof QCD in the bottom-up holographic framework is given. We constrain the\nrelation between dilaton field $\\phi$ and metric warp factor $A_e$ and get\nseveral reasonable models in the Einstein-Dilaton system. Using the potential\nreconstruction approach, we solve the corresponding gravity background. Then we\nfit the background-related parameters by comparing the equation of state with\nthe two-flavor lattice QCD results. After that we study the temperature\ndependent behavior of Polyakov loop and chiral condensate under those\nbackground solutions. We find that the results are in good agreement with the\ntwo-flavor lattice results. All the studies about the equation of state, the\nPolyakov loop and the chiral condensate signal crossover behavior of the phase\ntransitions, which is consistent with the current understanding on the QCD\nphase transitions with physical quark mass. Furthermore, the extracted\ntransition temperatures are comparable with the two-flavor lattice QCD results.\n", "  We present aspects of the moduli of curve families on a metric measure space\nwhich may prove useful in calculating, or in providing bounds to, non-additive\nentropies having a power-law functional form. We use as paradigmatic cases the\ncalculations of the moduli of curve families for a cylinder and for an annulus\nin $\\mathbb{R}^n$. The underlying motivation for these studies is that the\ndefinitions and some properties of the modulus of a curve family resembles\nthose of the Tsallis entropy, when the latter is seen from a micro-canonical\nviewpoint. We comment on the origin of the conjectured invariance of the\nTsallis entropy under M\\\"obius transformations of the non-extensive (entropic)\nparameter. Needing techniques applicable to both locallly Euclidean and fractal\nclasses of spaces, we examine the behavior of the Tsallis functional, via the\nmodulus, under quasi-conformal maps. We comment on properties of such maps and\ntheir possible significance for the dynamical foundations of power-law\nentropies.\n", "  We study certain features of scaling behaviors of the mutual information\nduring a process of thermalization, more precisely we extend the time scaling\nbehavior of mutual information which has been discussed in\n\\cite{Alishahiha:2014jxa} to time-dependent hyperscaling violating geometries.\nWe use the holographic description of entanglement entropy for two disjoint\nsystem consisting of two parallel strips whose widths are much larger than the\nseparation between them. We show that during the thermalization process, the\ndynamical exponent plays a crucial rule in reading the general time scaling\nbehavior of mutual information (\\emph{e.g.,} at the pre-local-equilibration\nregime). It is shown that the scaling violating parameter can be employed to\ndefine an effective dimension.\n", "  Molecular adsorption on surfaces is a key element for many applications,\nincluding sensing and catalysis. Non-invasive sugar sensing has been an active\narea of research due to its importance to diabetes care. The adsorption of\nsugars on a template surface study is at the heart of matter. Here, we study\ndoped hexagonal boron nitride sheets ($h$-BNNs) as adsorbing and sensing\ntemplate for glucose and glucosamine. Using first principles calculations, we\nfind that the adsorption of glucose and glucosamine on $h$-BNNs is\nsignificantly enhanced by the substitutional doping of the sheet with Al and\nGa. Including long range van der Waals corrections gives adsorption energies of\nabout 2 eV. In addition to the charge transfer occurring between glucose and\nthe Al/Ga-doped BN sheets, the adsorption alters the size of the band gap,\nallowing for optical detection of adsorption. We also find that Al-doped boron\nnitride sheet is better than Ga-nitride sheet to enhance the adsorption energy\nof glucose and glucosamine. The results of our work can be potentially utilized\nwhen designing support templates for glucose and glucosamine.\n", "  We present a readily computable semi-analytic Layer Response Theory (LRT) for\nanalysis of cohesive energetics involving two-dimensional layers such as BN or\ngraphene. The theory approximates the Random Phase Approximation (RPA)\ncorrelation energy. Its RPA character ensures that the energy has the correct\nvan der Waals asymptotics for well-separated layers, in contrast to simple\npairwise atom-atom theories which fail qualitatively for layers with zero\nelectronic energy gap. At the same time our theory is much less computationally\nintensive than the full RPA energy. It also gives accurate correlation energies\nnear to the binding minimum, in contrast to Lifshitz-type theory. We apply our\nLRT theory successfully to graphite and to BN, and to a graphene-BN\nheterostructure.\n", "  The Onsager-de Groot-Callen transport theory, implemented as a network model,\nis used to simulate the transient Harman method, which is widely used\nexperimentally to determine all thermoelectric transport coefficients in a\nsingle measurement setup. It is shown that this method systematically\noverestimates the Seebeck coefficient for samples composed of two different\nmaterials. As a consequence, the figure of merit is also overestimated, if the\nthermal coupling of the measurement setup to the environment is weak. For a\nmixture of metal and semiconductor particles near metal percolation the figure\nof merit obtained by the Harman method is more than 100 \\% too large. For a\ncorrect interpretation of the experimental data, information on composition and\nmicrostructure of the sample are indispensable.\n", "  In this work we develop a semi-analytical variational ansatz to study the\nproperties of few photon excitations interacting with a collection of quantum\nemitters in regimes that go beyond the rotating wave approximation. This method\ncan be used to approximate both the static and dynamical properties of a\nsuperconducting qubit in an open transmission line, including the spontaneous\nemission spectrum and the resonances in scattering experiments. The\napproximations are quantitatively accurate for rather strong couplings, as\nshown by a direct comparison to Matrix-Product-State numerical methods, and\nprovide also a good qualitative description for stronger couplings well beyond\nthe Markovian regime.\n", "  Colored fermionic partners of the top quark are well-known signatures of the\nComposite Higgs scenario and for this reason they have been and will be subject\nof an intensive experimental study at the LHC. Performing an assessment of the\ntheoretical implications of this experimental effort is the goal of the present\npaper. We proceed by analyzing a set of simple benchmark models, characterized\nby simple two-dimensional parameter spaces where the results of the searches\nare conveniently visualized and their impact quantified. We only draw exclusion\ncontours, in the hypothesis of no signal, but of course our formalism could\nequally well be used to report discoveries in a theoretically useful format.\n", "  We apply the general conception of non-Abelian gauge fields for description\nof magnetic soliton excitations. We show that the component of the gauge field\nalong the soliton local magnetization (Abelian part of the gauge potential)\ndetermines dynamics of spin fluctuations over the soliton background in a\nferromagnet. Assumption that the gauge field is a pure gauge allows calculating\nthe gauge field components and finding simple expressions for the emergent\nelectromagnet fields related to the soliton motion. The gauge field results in\nsoliton-magnon interaction leading to renormalization of the soliton and magnon\ndynamics. The presented approach allows reaching more deep understanding of a\nrelationship of the field theory and condensed matter magnetism.\n", "  We consider the reconstruction of a Lifshitz spacetime from three\nperspectives: differential entropy (or \"hole-ography\"), causal wedges and\nentanglement wedges. We find that not all time-varying bulk curves in vacuum\nLifshitz can be reconstructed via the differential entropy approach, adding a\ncaveat to the general analysis of \\cite{Headrick:2014eia}. We show that the\ncausal wedge for Lifshitz spacetimes degenerates, while the entanglement wedge\nrequires the additional consideration of a set of boundary-emanating\nlight-sheets. The need to include bulk surfaces with no clear field theory\ninterpretation in the differential entropy construction and the change in the\nentanglement wedge formation both serve as warnings against a naive application\nof holographic entanglement entropy proposals in Lifshitz spacetimes.\n", "  In this paper we study supersymmetric field theories on an AdS_p x S^q\nspace-time that preserves their full supersymmetry. This is an interesting\nexample of supersymmetry on a non-compact curved space. The supersymmetry\nalgebra on such a space is a (p-1)-dimensional superconformal algebra, and we\nclassify all possible algebras that can arise for p >= 3. In some AdS_3 cases\nmore than one superconformal algebra can arise from the same field theory. We\ndiscuss in detail the special case of four dimensional field theories with N=1\nand N=2 supersymmetry on AdS_3 x S^1.\n", "  In this paper we study the morphology of drops formed on partially wetting\nsubstrates, whose footprint is not circular. This type of drops is a\nconsequence of the breakup processes occurring in thin films when anisotropic\ncontact line motions take place. The anisotropy is basically due to hysteresis\neffects of the contact angle since some parts of the contact line are wetting,\nwhile others are dewetting. Here, we obtain a peculiar drop shape from the\nrupture of a long liquid filament sitting on a solid substrate, and analyze its\nshape and contact angles by means of goniometric and refractive techniques. We\nalso find a non--trivial steady state solution for the drop shape within the\nlong wave approximation (lubrication theory), and compare most of its features\nwith experimental data. This solution is presented both in Cartesian and polar\ncoordinates, whose constants must be determined by a certain group of measured\nparameters. Besides, we obtain the dynamics of the drop generation from\nnumerical simulations of the full Navier--Stokes equation, where we emulate the\nhysteretic effects with an appropriate spatial distribution of the static\ncontact angle over the substrate.\n", "  We calculate the holographic entanglement entropy in type IIB supergravity\nsolutions that are dual to half-BPS disorder-type surface defects in ${\\cal\nN}=4$ Super Yang-Mills theory. The entanglement entropy is calculated for a\nball-shaped region bisected by a surface defect. Using the bubbling\nsupergravity solutions we also compute the expectation value of the defect\noperator. Combining our result with the previously-calculated one-point\nfunction of the stress tensor in the presence of the defect, we adapt the\ncalculation of Lewkowycz and Maldacena to obtain a second expression for the\nentanglement entropy. Our two expressions agree up to an additional term, whose\npossible origin and significance is discussed\n", "  We study the conditions for a new scalar resonance to be observed first in\ndiphotons at the LHC Run-2. We focus on scenarios where the scalar arises\neither from an internal or spacetime symmetry broken spontaneously, for which\nthe mass is naturally below the cutoff and the low-energy interactions are\nfixed by the couplings to the broken currents, UV anomalies, and selection\nrules. We discuss the recent excess in diphoton resonance searches observed by\nATLAS and CMS at 750 GeV, and explore its compatibility with other searches at\nRun-1 and its interpretation as Goldstone bosons in supersymmetry and composite\nHiggs models. We show that two candidates naturally emerge: a Goldstone boson\nfrom an internal symmetry with electromagnetic anomalies, and the scalar\npartner of the Goldstone of supersymmetry breaking: the sgoldstino. The dilaton\nfrom conformal symmetry breaking is instead disfavoured by present data, in its\nminimal natural realization.\n", "  A trigger system was designed for the external target experiment in the\nCooling Storage Ring (CSR) of the Heavy Ion Research Facility in Lanzhou\n(HIRFL). Considering that different detectors are scattered in a large area,\nthe trigger system is designed based on a master-slave structure and\nfiber-based serial data transmission technique. The trigger logic is organized\nin hierarchies, and flexible reconfiguration of the trigger function is\nachieved based on command register access or overall field-programmable gate\narray (FPGA) logic on-line reconfiguration controlled by remote computers. We\nalso conducted tests to confirm the function of the trigger electronics, and\nthe results indicate that this trigger system works well.\n", "  We present a direct comparison studying equilibration through kinetic theory\nat weak coupling and through holography at strong coupling in the same set-up.\nThe set-up starts with a homogeneous thermal state, which then smoothly\ntransitions through an out-of-equilibrium phase to an expanding system\nundergoing boost-invariant flow. This first apples-to-apples comparison of\nequilibration provides a benchmark for similar equilibration processes in\nheavy-ion collisions, where the equilibration mechanism is still under debate.\nWe find that results at weak and strong coupling can be smoothly connected by\nsimple, empirical power-laws for the viscosity, equilibration time and entropy\nproduction of the system.\n", "  Minimal Dark Matter (MDM) is a theoretical framework highly appreciated for\nits minimality and yet its predictivity. Of the two only viable candidates\nsingled out in the original analysis, the scalar eptaplet has been found to\ndecay too quickly to be around today, while the fermionic quintuplet is now\nbeing probed by indirect Dark Matter (DM) searches. It is therefore timely to\ncritically review the MDM paradigm, possibly pointing out generalizations of\nthis framework. We propose and explore two distinct directions. One is to\nabandon the assumption of DM electric neutrality in favor of absolutely stable,\nmillicharged DM candidates which are part of $SU(2)_{\\text{L}}$ multiplets with\ninteger isospin. Another possibility is to lower the cutoff of the model, which\nwas originally fixed at the Planck scale, to allow for DM decays. We find new\nviable MDM candidates and study their phenomenology in detail.\n", "  We study the properties of operators in a unitary conformal field theory\nwhose scaling dimensions approach each other for some values of the parameters\nand satisfy von Neumann-Wigner non-crossing rule. We argue that the scaling\ndimensions of such operators and their OPE coefficients have a universal\nscaling behavior in the vicinity of the crossing point. We demonstrate that the\nobtained relations are in a good agreement with the known examples of the\nlevel-crossing phenomenon in maximally supersymmetric $\\mathcal N=4$ Yang-Mills\ntheory, three-dimensional conformal field theories and QCD.\n", "  Besides the designed beam acceleration, the energy of electrons changed by\nthe longitudinal wakefields in a real free-electron laser (FEL) facility, which\nmay degrade FEL performances from the theoretical expectation. In this paper,\nwith the help of simulation codes, the wakefields induced beam energy loss in\nthe sophisticated undulator section is calculated for Shanghai soft X-ray FEL,\nwhich is a two-stage seeded FEL test facility. While the 1st stage 44 nm FEL\noutput is almost not affected by the wakefields, it is found that a beam energy\nloss about 0.8 MeV degrades the peak brightness of the 2nd stage 8.8 nm FEL by\na factor of 1.6, which however can be compensated by a magnetic field fine\ntuning of each undulator segment.\n", "  The top/bottom seesaw model, which extends the top seesaw in order to\naccomodate a 125 GeV Higgs boson, predicts vector-like top/bottom partners and\nthese partners can be bounded to form several neutral and charged singlet\ncomposite scalars by some new strong dynamics. In this letter, we use such a\nsinglet scalar to interpret the 750 GeV diphoton reseanance. This singlet\nscalar is dominantly produced through the gluon fusion process induced by the\npartners and its diphoton decay is induced by both the partners and the charged\nsinglet scalars. We show that this scenario can readily account for the\nobserved 750 GeV diphoton signal under the current LHC constraints. Further,\nthis scenario predicts some other phenomenology, such as a strong correlation\nbetween the decays to $\\gamma\\gamma$, $Z \\gamma$ and $ZZ$, a three-photon\nsingal from the associate production of a singlet scalar and a photon, as well\nas some signals from the partner cascade decays. These signals may jointly\nallow for a test of this framework in future LHC and ILC experiments.\n", "  A plausible explanation of the recent experimental indication of a resonance\nin the two-photon spectrum at LHC is that it corresponds to the CP-odd Higgs\nboson. We explore such a possibility in a generic framework of the two Higgs\ndoublet models (2HDM), and combine $m_A \\approx 750$GeV with the known $m_h\n=125.7(4)$~GeV to show that the charged Higgs boson and the other CP-even\nscalar masses become bounded from bellow and from above. We show that this\npossibility is also consistent with the electroweak precision data and the low\nenergy observables, which we test in a few leptonic and semileptonic decay\nmodes.\n", "  We argue that the effective theory for electromagnetic fields in spatially\nvarying meson condensations in dense nuclear and quark matter is given by the\naxion electrodynamics. We show that one of the helicity states of photons there\nhas the nonrelativistic gapless dispersion relation $\\omega \\sim k^2$ at small\nmomentum, while the other is gapped. This \"nonrelativistic photon\" may also be\nrealized at the interface between topological and trivial insulators in\ncondensed matter systems.\n", "  Measuring the 2S-2P Lamb shift in a hydrogen-like muonic atom allows one to\nextract its nuclear charge radius with a high precision that is limited by the\nuncertainty in the nuclear structure corrections. The charge radius of the\nproton thus extracted was found to be 7-sigma away from the CODATA value, in\nwhat has become the yet unsolved \"proton radius puzzle\". Further experiments\ncurrently aim at the isotopes of hydrogen and helium: the precise extraction of\ntheir radii may provide a hint at the solution of the puzzle. We present the\nfirst ab initio calculation of nuclear structure corrections, including the\nnuclear polarization correction, to the 2S-2P transition in $\\mu^3$He$^+$ and\n$\\mu^3$H, and assess solid theoretical error bars. Our predictions reduce the\nuncertainty in the nuclear structure corrections to the level of a few percents\nand will be instrumental to the on-going $\\mu^3$He$^+$ experiment. We also\nsupport the mirror $\\mu\\,^3$H system as a candidate for further probing of the\nnucleon polarizabilities and shedding more light on the puzzle.\n", "  We explore a novel type of transition in certain 6D and 4D quantum field\ntheories, in which the matter content of the theory changes while the gauge\ngroup and other parts of the spectrum remain invariant. Such transitions can\noccur, for example, for SU(6) and SU(7) gauge groups, where matter fields in a\nthree-index antisymmetric representation and the fundamental representation are\nexchanged in the transition for matter in the two-index antisymmetric\nrepresentation. These matter transitions are realized by passing through\nsuperconformal theories at the transition point. We explore these transitions\nin dual F-theory and heterotic descriptions, where a number of novel features\narise. For example, in the heterotic description the relevant 6D SU(7) theories\nare described by bundles on K3 surfaces where the geometry of the K3 is\nconstrained in addition to the bundle structure. On the F-theory side,\nnon-standard representations such as the three-index antisymmetric\nrepresentation of SU(N) require Weierstrass models that cannot be realized from\nthe standard SU(N) Tate form. We also briefly describe some other situations,\nwith groups such as Sp(3), SO(12), and SU(3), where analogous matter\ntransitions can occur between different representations. For SU(3), in\nparticular, we find a matter transition between adjoint matter and matter in\nthe symmetric representation, giving an explicit Weierstrass model for the\nF-theory description of the symmetric representation that complements another\nrecent analogous construction.\n", "  We have analyzed the crucial role the Coulomb interaction strength plays on\nthe even and odd denominator fractional quantum Hall effects in a\ntwo-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in the ZnO heterointerface. In this system,\nthe Landau level gaps are much smaller than those in conventional GaAs systems.\nThe Coulomb interaction is also very large compared to the Landau level gap\neven in very high magnetic fields. We therefore consider the influence of\nhigher Landau levels by considering the screened Coulomb potential in the\nrandom phase approximation. Interestingly, our exact diagonalization studies of\nthe collective modes with this screened potential successfully explain recent\nexperiments of even and odd denominator fractional quantum Hall effects, in\nparticular, the unexpected absence of the 5/2 state and the presence of 9/2\nstate in ZnO.\n", "  We investigate the parity of transmission spectra in a photonic crystal (PhC)\nwaveguide with a side-coupled cavity and a partially blocking element. We\ndemonstrate, by means of numerical calculations, that by varying the\ncavity-block distance the spectra vary from being asymmetric with blue parity,\nto being symmetric (Lorentzian), to being asymmetric with red parity. For\ncavity-block distances larger than five PhC lattice constants, we show that the\ntransmission spectrum is accurately described as the transmission spectrum of a\nFabry-Perot etalon with a single propagating Bloch mode, and that the parity of\nthe transmission spectrum correlates with the Fabry-Perot roundtrip phase.\n", "  Flows forced by a precessional motion can exhibit instabilities of crucial\nimportance, whether they concern the fuel of a flying object or the liquid core\nof a telluric planet. So far, stability analyses of these flows have focused on\nthe special case of a resonant forcing. Here, we address the instability of the\nflow inside a precessing cylinder in the general case. We first show that the\nbase flow forced by the cylinder precession is a superposition of a vertical or\nhorizontal shear flow and an infinite sum of forced modes. We then perform a\nlinear stability analysis of this base flow by considering its triadic\nresonance with two free Kelvin modes. Finally, we derive the amplitude\nequations of the free Kelvin modes and obtain an expression of the instability\nthreshold and growth rate.\n", "  We examine the dynamics of magnetic flux tubes containing non-trivial field\nline braiding (or linkage), using mathematical and computational modelling, in\nthe context of testable predictions for the laboratory and their significance\nfor solar coronal heating. We investigate the existence of braided force-free\nequilibria, and demonstrate that for a field anchored at perfectly-conducting\nplates, these equilibria exist and contain current sheets whose thickness\nscales inversely with the braid complexity - as measured for example by the\ntopological entropy. By contrast, for a periodic domain braided exact\nequilibria typically do not exist, while approximate equilibria contain thin\ncurrent sheets. In the presence of resistivity, reconnection is triggered at\nthe current sheets and a turbulent relaxation ensues. We finish by discussing\nthe properties of the turbulent relaxation and the existence of constraints\nthat may mean that the final state is not the linear force-free field predicted\nby Taylor's hypothesis.\n", "  The energy gain in laser wakefield accelerators is limited by dephasing\nbetween the driving laser pulse and the highly relativistic electrons in its\nwake. Since this phase depends on both the driver and the cavity length, the\neffects of dephasing can be mitigated with appropriate tailoring of the plasma\ndensity along propagation. Preceding studies have discussed the prospects of\ncontinuous phase-locking in the linear wakefield regime. However, most\nexperiments are performed in the highly non-linear regime and rely on\nself-guiding of the laser pulse. Due to the complexity of the driver evolution\nin this regime it is much more difficult to achieve phase locking. As an\nalternative we study the scenario of rapid rephasing in sharp density\ntransitions, as was recently demonstrated experimentally. Starting from a\nphenomenological model we deduce expressions for the electron energy gain in\nsuch density profiles. The results are in accordance with particle-in-cell\nsimulations and we present gain estimations for single and multiple stages of\nrephasing.\n", "  The recently observed diphoton anomaly at the LHC appears to suggest the\npresence of a rather broad resonance. In this note, it is pointed out that this\ndoes not hold if the two photons are produced along with an extra state.\nSpecifically, the diphoton invariant mass arising from various $A \\to\nB\\gamma\\gamma$ processes, with $A,B$ being scalars, fermions, or vectors,\nthough peaked at a rather large value, would naturally be broad and could fit\nrather well the observed deviations. This interpretation has a number of\nadvantages over the two-photon resonance hypothesis, for example with respect\nto the compatibility with the 8 TeV diphoton, dilepton or dijet searches, and\nopens many new routes for New Physics model construction.\n", "  Reionization is thought to have occurred in the redshift range of $6 < z <\n9$, which is now being probed by both deep galaxy surveys and CMB observations.\nUsing halo abundance matching over the redshift range $5<z<8$ and assuming\nsmooth, continuous gas accretion, we develop a model for the star formation\nefficiency $f_{\\star}$ of dark matter halos at $z>6$ that matches the measured\ngalaxy luminosity functions at these redshifts. We find that $f_{\\star}$ peaks\nat $\\sim 30\\%$ at halo masses $M \\sim 10^{11}$--$10^{12}$~M$_\\odot$, in\nqualitative agreement with its behavior at lower redshifts. We then investigate\nthe cosmic star formation histories and the corresponding models of\nreionization for a range of extrapolations to small halo masses. We use a\nvariety of observations to further constrain the characteristics of the galaxy\npopulations, including the escape fraction of UV photons. Our approach provides\nan empirically-calibrated, physically-motivated model for the properties of\nstar-forming galaxies sourcing the epoch of reionization. In the case where\nstar formation in low-mass halos is maximally efficient, an average escape\nfraction $\\sim0.1$ can reproduce the optical depth reported by Planck, whereas\ninefficient star formation in these halos requires either about twice as many\nUV photons to escape, or an escape fraction that increases towards higher\nredshifts. Our models also predict how future observations with JWST can\nimprove our understanding of these galaxy populations.\n", "  Information theory has been taken as a prospective tool for quantifying the\ncomplexity of complex networks. In this paper, we first study the information\nentropy or uncertainty of a path using the information theory. Then we apply\nthe path entropy to the link prediction problem in real-world networks.\nSpecifically, we propose a new similarity index, namely Path Entropy (PE)\nindex, which considers the information entropies of shortest paths between node\npairs with penalization to long paths. Empirical experiments demonstrate that\nPE index outperforms the mainstream link predictors.\n", "  A formalism for the vacancy formation energies in random alloys within the\nsingle-site mean-filed approximation, where vacancy-vacancy interaction is\nneglected, is outlined. It is shown that the alloy configurational entropy can\nsubstantially reduce the concentration of vacancies at high temperatures. The\nenergetics of vacancies in random Cu-0.5Ni-0.5 alloy is considered as a\nnumerical example illustrating the developed formalism. It is shown that the\neffective formation energy is increases with temperature, however, in this\nparticular system it is still below the mean value of the vacancy formation\nenergy which would correspond to the vacancy formation energy in a homogeneous\nmodel of a random alloy, such as given by the coherent potential approximation.\n", "  In recent years, the production of a SM particle with large missing\ntransverse momentum, dubbed mono-X searches, have gained increasing attention.\nAfter the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012, the run-II of the LHC will now\nscrutinise its properties, looking for BSM physics. In particular, one could\nsearch for mono-Higgs signals, that are typically studied in models addressing\ndark matter. However, this signal can appear also in models addressing the\nneutrino masses, if additional heavier neutrinos with masses at the electroweak\nscale are present. The latter will couple to the SM neutrinos and the Higgs\nboson, yielding a type of mono-Higgs signal not considered for dark matter: the\nresonant production of a Higgs boson and missing energy. In this paper, we\naddress the LHC exclusion power of the latter with dedicated detector\nsimulations, and reinterpret it in a benchmark scenario for neutrino mass\ngeneration.\n", "  We investigate the chiral phase transition in the soft-wall model of AdS/QCD\nat zero chemical potential for two-flavor and three-flavor cases, respectively.\nWe show that there is no spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in the original\nsoft-wall model. After detailed analysis, we find that in order to realize\nchiral symmetry breaking and restoration, both profiles for the scalar\npotential and the dilaton field are essential. The scalar potential determines\nthe possible solution structure of the chiral condensate, except the mass term,\nit takes another quartic term for the two-flavor case, and for the three-flavor\ncase, one has to take into account an extra cubic term due to the t'Hooft\ndeterminant interaction. The profile of the dilaton field reflects the\ngluodynamics, which is negative at a certain ultraviolet scale and approaches\npositive quadratic behavior at far infrared region. With this set-up, the\nspontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in the vacuum and its restoration at\nfinite temperature can be realized perfectly. In the two-flavor case, it gives\na second order chiral phase transition in the chiral limit, while the\ntransition turns to be a crossover for any finite quark mass. In the case of\nthree-flavor, the phase transition becomes a first order one in the chiral\nlimit, while above sufficient large quark mass it turns to be a crossover\nagain. This scenario agrees exactly with the current understanding on chiral\nphase transition from lattice QCD and other effective model studies.\n", "  We present a novel approach to cascaded stimulated Brillouin scattering and\nfrequency comb generation in which the multitude of interacting pump, Stokes,\nand anti-Stokes optical fields are described by a single forward wave and a\nsingle backward wave at a single carrier frequency. The envelopes of these two\nwaves are modulated through coupling to a single acoustic oscillation and\nthrough four-wave mixing. Starting from a single pump field, we observe the\nemergence of a comb of frequencies as the intensity is increased. The set of\nthree differential equations derived here are sufficient to describe the\ngeneration of any number of Brillouin sidebands in oscillator systems that\nwould have required hundreds of coupled equations in the standard approach. We\ntest the new approach on some published experiments and find excellent\nagreement with the results.\n", "  We discuss some consistency tests that must be passed for a successful\nexplanation of a diphoton excess at larger mass scales, generated by a scalar\nor pseudoscalar state, possibly of a composite nature, decaying to two photons.\nScalar states at mass scales above the electroweak scale decaying significantly\ninto photon final states generically lead to modifications of Standard Model\nHiggs phenomenology. We characterise this effect using the formalism of\nEffective Field Theory (EFT) and study the modification of the effective\ncouplings to photons and gluons of the Higgs. The modification of Higgs\nphenomenology comes about in a variety of ways. For scalar $0^+$states, the\nHiggs and the heavy boson can mix. Lower energy phenomenology gives a limit on\nthe mixing angle, which gets generated at one loop in any such theory\nexplaining the diphoton excess. Even if the mixing angle is set to zero, we\ndemonstrate that a relation exists between lower energy Higgs data and a\nmassive scaler decaying to diphoton final states. If the new boson is a\npseudoscalar, we note that if it is composite, it is generic to have an excited\nscalar partner that can mix with the Higgs, which has a stronger coupling to\nphotons. In the case of a pseudoscalar, we also characterize how lower energy\nHiggs phenomenology is directly modified using EFT, even without assuming a\nscalar partner of the pseudoscalar state. We find that naturalness concerns can\nbe accommodated, and that pseudoscalar models are more protected from lower\nenergy constraints.\n", "  Device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) guarantees unconditional\nsecurity of secret key without making assumptions about the internal workings\nof the devices used. It does so using the loophole-free violation of a Bell's\ninequality. The primary challenge in realizing DIQKD in practice is the\ndetection loophole problem that is inherent to photonic tests of Bell's\ninequalities over lossy channels. We revisit the proposal of Curty and Moroder\n[Phys. Rev. A 84, 010304(R) (2011)] to use a linear optics-based\nentanglement-swapping relay (ESR) to counter this problem. We consider\nrealistic models for the entanglement sources and photodetectors; more\nprecisely, (a) polarization-entangled states based on pulsed spontaneous\nparametric downconversion (SPDC) sources with infinitely higher order\nmulti-photon components and multimode spectral structure, and (b) on-off\nphotodetectors with non-unit efficiencies and non-zero dark count\nprobabilities. We show that the ESR-based scheme is robust against the above\nimperfections and enables positive key rates at distances much larger than what\nis possible otherwise.\n", "  We point out that the Cartan geometry known as the second-order conformal\nstructure provides a natural differential geometric framework underlying gauge\ntheories of conformal gravity. We are concerned by two theories: the first one\nwill be the associated Yang-Mills-like Lagrangian, while the second, inspired\nby~\\cite{Wheeler2014}, will be a slightly more general one which will relax the\nconformal Cartan geometry. The corresponding gauge symmetry is treated within\nthe BRST language. We show that the Weyl gauge potential is a spurious degree\nof freedom, analogous to a Stueckelberg field, that can be eliminated through\nthe dressing field method. We derive sets of field equations for both the\nstudied Lagrangians. For the second one, they constrain the gauge field to be\nthe `normal conformal Cartan connection'. Finally, we provide in a Lagrangian\nframework a justification of the identification, in dimension $4$, of the Bach\ntensor with the Yang-Mills current of the normal conformal Cartan connection,\nas proved in \\cite{Korz-Lewand-2003}.\n", "  The quark susceptibility $\\chi_q$ at zero and finite quark chemical potential\nprovides a critical benchmark to determine the quark-gluon-plasma (QGP) degrees\nof freedom in relation to the results from lattice QCD (lQCD) in addition to\nthe equation of state and transport coefficients. Here we extend the familiar\ndynamical-quasiparticle model (DQPM) to partonic propagators that explicitly\ndepend on the three-momentum with respect to the partonic medium at rest in\norder to match perturbative QCD (pQCD) at high momenta. Within the extended\ndynamical-quasi-particle model (DQPM$^*$) we reproduce simultaneously the lQCD\nresults for the quark number density and susceptibility and the QGP pressure at\nzero and finite (but small) chemical potential $\\mu_q$. The shear viscosity\n$\\eta$ and the electric conductivity $\\sigma_e$ from the extended quasiparticle\nmodel (DQPM$^*$) also turn out in close agreement with lattice results for\n$\\mu_q$ =0. The DQPM$^*$, furthermore, allows to evaluate the momentum $p$,\ntemperature $T$ and chemical potential $\\mu_q$ dependencies of the partonic\ndegrees of freedom also for larger $\\mu_q$ which are mandatory for transport\nstudies of heavy-ion collisions in the regime 5 GeV $< \\sqrt{s_{NN}} <$ 10 GeV.\n", "  Recent analyses of small collision systems, namely $p+p$ and $p+$Pb at the\nLHC and $p+$Au, $d+$Au and $^{3}$He+Au at RHIC, have revealed azimuthal\nmomentum anisotropies commonly associated with collective flow in larger\nsystems. Viscous hydrodynamics and parton cascade calculations have proved\nsuccessful at describing some flow-like observables in these systems. These two\nclasses of calculations also confirm these observables to be directly related\nto the initial geometry of the created medium. However, the question of whether\nequilibrium dynamics is the dominant driver of the signal remains open, given\nthe short lifetime of small systems. In this regime, pre-equilibrium dynamics\nand late stage hadronic interactions are expected to play a significant role.\nHence, a beam energy scan of small systems---that amounts to varying the\ninitial temperature and the lifetime of the medium---can provide valuable\ninformation to shed light on these issues. In this paper, we present\npredictions from viscous hydrodynamics (SONIC), partonic (AMPT) and hadronic\n(UrQMD) cascade calculations for elliptic $v_2$ and triangular $v_3$ anisotropy\ncoefficients in $d$+Au at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7, 20, 39, 62.4 and 200 GeV,\ncorresponding to the expected running at RHIC in 2016. We also present\npredictions for $d$+Pb at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV, an interesting system to\ncompare to existing $p+$Pb data taken at the LHC.\n", "  Time-resolved magnetic sensing is of great importance from fundamental\nstudies to applications in physical and biological sciences. Recently the\nnitrogen-vacancy (NV) defect center in diamond has been developed as a\npromising sensor of magnetic field under ambient conditions. However the\nmethods to reconstruct time-resolved magnetic field with high sensitivity are\nnot yet fully developed. Here, we propose and demonstrate a novel sensing\nmethod based on spin echo, and Haar wavelet transform. Our method is\nexponentially faster in reconstructing time-resolved magnetic field with\ncomparable sensitivity over existing methods. Further, the wavelet's unique\nfeatures enable our method to extract information from the whole signal with\nonly part of the measuring sequences. We then explore this feature for a fast\ndetection of simulated nerve impulses. These results will be useful to\ntime-resolved magnetic sensing with quantum probes at nano-scales.\n", "  In this paper we investigate the possibility whether, in the extreme limit of\nhigh energies and large transverse distances, reggeon field theory might serve\nas an effective theory of high energy scattering for strong interactions. We\nanalyse the functional renormalization group equations (flow equations) of\nreggeon field theory and search for fixed points in the space of (local)\nreggeon field theories. We study in complementary ways the candidate for the\nscaling solution, investigate its main properties and briefly discuss possible\nphysical interpretations.\n", "  In classical turbulence the kinematic viscosity $\\nu$ is involved in two\nphenomena. The first is the energy dissipation and the second is the mechanical\nmomentum flux toward the wall. In superfluid turbulence the mechanism of energy\ndissipation is different, and it is determined by an effective viscosity which\nwas introduced by Vinen and is denoted as $\\nu'$. In this paper we show that in\nsuperfluid turbulence the transfer of mechanical momentum to the wall is caused\nby the presence of a quantum vortex tangle, giving rise to another effective\n\"momentum\" viscosity that we will denote as $\\nu_\\text{m}(T)$. The temperature\ndependence of the second effective viscosity is markedly different from Vinen's\neffective viscosity $\\nu'(T)$. We show that the notion of vortex-tension force,\nplaying an important role in the theory of quantum turbulence, can be\nunderstood as the gradient of the Reynolds stress tensor which is in fact\ndetermined by the second newly defined kinematic viscosity $\\nu_\\text{m}(T)$.\n", "  Sigma models on semi-symmetric spaces provide the central building block for\nstring theories on AdS backgrounds. Under certain conditions on the global\nsupersymmetry group they can be made one-loop conformal by adding an\nappropriate fermionic Wess-Zumino term. We determine the full one-loop dilation\noperator of the theory. It involves an interesting new XXZ-like interaction\nterm. Eigenvalues of our dilation operator, i.e. the one-loop anomalous\ndimensions, are computed for a few examples.\n", "  Superfield constraints were often used in the past, in particular to describe\nthe Akulov-Volkov action of the goldstino by a superfield formulation with\n$L=(\\Phi^\\dagger \\Phi)_D + [(f\\Phi)_F + h.c.]$ endowed with the nilpotent\nconstraint $\\Phi^2=0$ for the goldstino superfield ($\\Phi$). Inspired by this,\nsuch constraint is often used to define the goldstino superfield even in the\npresence of additional superfields, for example in models of \"nilpotent\ninflation\". In this review we show that the nilpotent property is not valid in\ngeneral, under the assumption of a microscopic (ultraviolet) description of the\ntheory with linear supermultiplets. Sometimes only weaker versions of the\nnilpotent relation are true such as $\\Phi^3=0$ or $\\Phi^4=0$ ($\\Phi^2\\not=0$)\nin the infrared (far below the UV scale) under the further requirement of\ndecoupling all additional scalars (coupling to sgoldstino), something not\nalways possible (e.g. if light scalars exist). In such cases the weaker\nnilpotent property is not specific to the goldstino superfield anymore. We\nreview the restrictions for the Kahler curvature tensor and superpotential $W$\nunder which $\\Phi^2=0$ remains true in infrared, assuming linear\nsupermultiplets in the microscopic description. One can reverse the arguments\nto demand that the nilpotent condition, initially an infrared property, be\nextended even in the presence of additional superfields, but this may question\nthe nature of supersymmetry breaking or the existence of a perturbative\nultraviolet completion with linear supermultiplets.\n", "  We consider Virasoro conformal blocks in the large central charge limit.\nThere are different regimes depending on the behavior of the conformal\ndimensions. The most simple regime is reduced to the global sl(2, C) conformal\nblocks while the most complicated one is known as the classical conformal\nblocks. Recently, Fitzpatrick, Kaplan, and Walters showed that the two regimes\nare related through the intermediate stage of the so-called heavy-light\nsemiclassical limit. We study this idea in the particular case of the 5-point\nconformal block. To find the 5-point global block we use the projector\ntechnique and the Casimir operator approach. Furthermore, we discuss the\nrelation between the global and the heavy-light limits and construct the\nheavy-light block from the global block. In this way we reproduce our previous\nresults for the 5-point perturbative classical block obtained by means of the\nmonodromy method.\n", "  Analytical treatment of premixed flame propagation in vertical tubes with\nsmooth walls is given. Using the on-shell flame description, equations\ndescribing quasi-steady flame with a small but finite front thickness are\nobtained and solved numerically. It is found that near the limits of\ninflammability, solutions describing upward flame propagation come in pairs\nhaving close propagation speeds, and that the effect of gravity is to reverse\nthe burnt gas velocity profile generated by the flame. On the basis of these\nresults, a theory of partial flame propagation driven by the gravitational\nfield is developed. A complete explanation is given of the intricate observed\nbehavior of limit flames, including dependence of the inflammability range on\nthe size of the combustion domain, the large distances of partial flame\npropagation, and the progression of flame extinction. The role of the finite\nfront-thickness effects is discussed in detail. Also, various mechanisms\ngoverning flame acceleration in smooth tubes are identified. Acceleration of\nmethane-air flames in open tubes is shown to be a combined effect of the\nhydrostatic pressure difference produced by the ambient cold air and the\ndifference of dynamic gas pressure at the tube ends. On the other hand, a\nstrong spontaneous acceleration of the fast methane-oxygen flames at the\ninitial stage of their evolution in open-closed tubes is conditioned by\nmetastability of the quasi-steady propagation regimes. An extensive comparison\nof the obtained results with the experimental data is made.\n", "  In cavity optomechanics, radiation pressure and photothermal forces are\nwidely utilized to cool and control micromechanical motion, with applications\nranging from precision sensing and quantum information to fundamental science.\nHere, we realize an alternative approach to optical forcing based on superfluid\nflow and evaporation in response to optical heating. We demonstrate optical\nforcing of the motion of a cryogenic microtoroidal resonator at a level of 1.46\nnN, roughly one order of magnitude larger than the radiation pressure force. We\nuse this force to feedback cool the motion of a microtoroid mechanical mode to\n137 mK. The photoconvective forces demonstrated here provide a new tool for\nhigh bandwidth control of mechanical motion in cryogenic conditions, and have\nthe potential to allow efficient transfer of electromagnetic energy to motional\nkinetic energy.\n", "  Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we explore the structural\nstability and mechanical integrity of phosphorene nanotubes (PNTs), where the\nintrinsic strain in the tubular PNT structure plays an important role. It is\nproposed that the atomic structure of larger-diameter armchair PNTs (armPNTs)\ncan remain stable at higher temperature, but the high intrinsic strain in the\nhoop direction renders zigzag PNTs (zigPNTs) less favorable. The mechanical\nproperties of PNTs, including the Young's modulus and fracture strength, are\nsensitive to the diameter, showing a size dependence. A simple model is\nproposed to express the Young's modulus as a function of the intrinsic axial\nstrain which in turns depends on the diameter of PNTs. In addition, the\ncompressive buckling of armPNTs is length-dependent, whose instability modes\ntransit from column buckling to shell buckling are observed as the ratio of\ndiameter/length increases.\n", "  Resonant photon modes of a 5mm diameter YIG sphere loaded in a cylindrical\ncavity in the 10-30GHz frequency range are characterised as a function of\napplied DC magnetic field at millikelvin temperatures. The photon modes are\nconfined mainly to the sphere, and exhibited large mode filling factors in\ncomparison to previous experiments, allowing ultrastrong coupling with the\nmagnon spin wave resonances. The largest observed coupling between photons and\nmagnons is $2g/2\\pi=7.11$ GHz for a 15.5 GHz mode, corresponding to a\ncooperativity of $C=1.51\\pm0.47\\times10^7$. Complex modifications beyond a\nsimple multi-oscillator model, of the photon mode frequencies were observed\nbetween 0 and 0.1 Tesla. Between 0.4 to 1 Tesla, degenerate resonant photon\nmodes were observed to interact with magnon spin wave resonances with different\ncouplings strengths, indicating time reversal symmetry breaking due to the\ngyrotropic permeability of YIG. Bare dielectric resonator mode frequencies were\ndetermined by detuning magnon modes to significantly higher frequencies with\nstrong magnetic fields. By comparing measured mode frequencies at 7 Tesla with\nFinite Element modelling, a bare dielectric permittivity of $15.96\\pm0.02$ of\nthe YIG crystal has been determined at about $20$ mK.\n", "  Existence of a minimal measurable length, as an effective cutoff in the\nultraviolet regime, is a common feature of all approaches to the quantum\ngravity proposal. It is widely believed that this length scale will be of the\norder of the Planck length $\\lambda=\\lambda_0\\,l_{_{\\rm Pl}}$, where\n$\\lambda_0\\sim{\\mathcal O}(1)$ is a dimensionless parameter that should be\nfixed only by the experiments. This issue can be taken into account through the\ndeformed momentum spaces with compact topologies. In this paper, we consider\nminimum length effects on the physical quantities related to three parameters\nof the $SU(2)$ Nambu-Jona-Lasinio effective model of QCD by means of the\ndeformed measure which is defined on compact momentum space with ${\\mathbf\nS}^3$ topology. This measure is suggested by the doubly special relativity\ntheories, Snyder deformed spaces, and the deformed algebra that is obtained in\nthe light of the stability theory of Lie algebras. Using the current\nexperimental data of the particle physics collaboration, we constraint quantum\ngravity parameter $\\lambda_0$ and we compare our results with bounds that are\narisen from the other experimental setups.\n", "  Symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases exhibit nontrivial order if\nsymmetry is respected but are adiabatically connected to the trivial product\nphase if symmetry is not respected. However, unlike the symmetry-breaking\nphase, there is no local order parameter for SPT phases. Here we employ a\ntensor-network method to compute the topological invariants characterized by\nthe simulated modular $S$ and $T$ matrices to study transitions in a few\nfamilies of two-dimensional (2D) wavefunctions which are $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ ($N=2\\,\n\\&3$) symmetric. We find that in addition to the topologically ordered phases,\nthe modular matrices can be used to identify nontrivial SPT phases and detect\ntransitions between different SPT phases as well as between symmetric and\nsymmetry-breaking phases. Therefore, modular matrices can be used to\ncharacterize various types of gapped phases in a unifying way.\n", "  We introduce an intuitive and semi-analytical polaron master equation\napproach to model pulse-driven population inversion and emitted single photons\nfrom a quantum dot exciton. The master equation theory allows one to identify\nimportant phonon-induced scattering rates analytically, and fully includes the\nrole of the time-dependent pump field. As an application of the theory, we\nfirst study a quantum dot driven by a time-varying laser pulse on and off\nresonance, showing the population inversion caused by acoustic phonon emission\nin direct agreement with recent experiment of Quilter {\\em et al.}, Phys Rev\nLett {\\bf 114}, 137401 (2015). We then model quantum dots in weakly coupled\ncavities and show the difference in population response between exciton-driven\nand cavity-driven systems. Finally, we assess the nonresonant phonon-assisted\nloading scheme with a quantum dot resonantly coupled to a cavity as a\ndeterministic single photon source, and compare and contrast the important\nfigures of merit with direct Rabi oscillation of the population using a\nresonant $\\pi$ pulse, where the latter is shown to be much more efficient.\n", "  We propose a tunable electronic band gap and zero-energy modes in periodic\nheterosubstrate-induced graphene superlattices. Interestingly, there is an\napproximate linear relation between the band gap and the proportion of\ninhomogeneous substrate (i.e., percentages of different components) in the\nproposed superlattice, and the effect of structural disorder on the relation is\ndiscussed. In inhomogeneous substrate with equal widths, zero-energy states\nemerge in the form of Dirac points by using asymmetric potentials, and the\npositions of Dirac points are addressed analytically. Further, the Dirac point\nexists at $\\mathbf{k}=\\mathbf{0}$ only for specific potentials; every time it\nappears, the group velocity vanishes in $k_y$ direction and the resonance\noccurs. For general cases that inhomogeneous substrate with unequal widths, a\npart of zero-energy states are described analytically, and differently, they\nare not always Dirac points. Our prediction may be realized on the\nheterosubstrate such as SiO$_2$/BN type.\n", "  Recently, both ATLAS and CMS collaborations at the CERN Large Hadron Collider\n(LHC) have announced their observations of an excess of diphoton events around\nthe invariant mass of $750~{\\rm GeV}$ with a local significance of $3.6\\sigma$\nand $2.6\\sigma$, respectively. In this paper, we interpret the diphoton excess\nas the on-shell production of a real singlet scalar in the $pp \\to S \\to \\gamma\n\\gamma$ channel. To accommodate the observed production rate, we further\nintroduce a vector-like fermion $F$, which is carrying both color and electric\ncharges. The viable regions of model parameters are explored for this simple\nextension of the Standard Model (SM). Moreover, we revisit the problem of\nelectroweak vacuum stability in the same scenario, and find that the\nrequirement for the electroweak vacuum stability up to high energy scales\nimposes serious constraints on the Yukawa coupling of the vector-like fermion\nand the quartic couplings of the SM Higgs boson and the new singlet scalar.\nConsequently, a successful explanation for the diphoton excess and the absolute\nstability of electroweak vacuum cannot be achieved simultaneously in this\neconomical setup.\n", "  A time-reversal invariant topological superconductivity is suggested to be\nrealized in a quasi-one dimensional structure on a plane, which is fabricated\nby filling the superconducting materials into the periodic channel of\ndielectric matrices like zeolite and asbestos under high pressure. The\ntopological superconducting phase sets up in the presence of large spin-orbit\ninteractions when intra-wire s-wave and inter-wire d-wave pairings take place.\nKramers pairs of Majorana bound states emerge at the edges of each wire. We\nanalyze effects of Zeeman magnetic field on Majorana zero-energy states.\nIn-plane magnetic field was shown to make asymmetric the energy dispersion,\nnevertheless Majorana fermions survive due to protection of a particle-hole\nsymmetry. Tunneling of Majorana quasi-particle from the end of one wire to the\nnearest-neighboring one yields edge fractional Josephson current with\n$4\\pi$-periodicity.\n", "  Eshelby's theory is the foundation of composite mechanics, allowing\ncalculation of the effective elastic moduli of composites from a knowledge of\ntheir microstructure. However it ignores interfacial stress and only applies to\nvery dilute composites -- i.e. where any inclusions are widely spaced apart.\nHere, within the framework of the Mori-Tanaka multiphase approximation scheme,\nwe extend Eshelby's theory to treat a composite with interfacial stress in the\nnon-dilute limit. In particular we calculate the elastic moduli of composites\ncomprised of a compliant, elastic solid hosting a non-dilute distribution of\nidentical liquid droplets. The composite stiffness depends strongly on the\nratio of the droplet size, $R$, to an elastocapillary length scale, $L$.\nInterfacial tension substantially impacts the effective elastic moduli of the\ncomposite when $R/L\\lesssim 100$. When $R < 3L/2$ ($R=3L/2$) liquid inclusions\nstiffen (cloak the far-field signature of) the solid.\n", "  We provide boundary conditions for three-dimensional gravity including\nboosted Rindler spacetimes, representing the near-horizon geometry of\nnon-extremal black holes or flat space cosmologies. These boundary conditions\nforce us to make some unusual choices, like integrating the canonical boundary\ncurrents over retarded time and periodically identifying the latter. The\nasymptotic symmetry algebra turns out to be a Witt algebra plus a twisted u(1)\ncurrent algebra with vanishing level, corresponding to a twisted warped CFT\nthat is qualitatively different from the ones studied so far in the literature.\nWe show that this symmetry algebra is related to BMS by a twisted Sugawara\nconstruction and exhibit relevant features of our theory, including matching\nmicro- and macroscopic calculations of the entropy of zero-mode solutions. We\nconfirm this match in a generalization to boosted Rindler-AdS. Finally, we show\nhow Rindler entropy emerges in a suitable limit.\n", "  We study families of positive and completely positive maps acting on a\nbipartite system $\\mathbb{C}^M\\otimes \\mathbb{C}^N$ (with $M\\leq N$). The maps\nhave a property that when applied to any state (of a given entanglement class)\nthey result in a separable state, or more generally a state of another certain\nentanglement class (e.g., Schmidt number $\\leq k$). This allows us to derive\nuseful families of sufficient separability criteria. Explicit examples of such\ncriteria have been constructed for arbitrary $M,N$, with a special emphasis on\n$M=2$. Our results can be viewed as generalizations of the known facts that in\nthe sufficiently close vicinity of the completely depolarized state (the\nnormalized identity matrix), all states are separable (belong to \"weakly\"\nentangled classes). Alternatively, some of our results can be viewed as an\nentanglement classification for a certain family of states, corresponding to\nmixtures of the completely polarized state with pure state projectors,\npartially transposed and locally transformed pure state projectors.\n", "  A variety of heavy fermion superconductors, such as UCoGe, UGe$_2$, and URhGe\nexhibit a striking coexistence of bulk ferromagnetism and superconductivity. In\nthese systems, the magnetic moment decreases with pressure, and vanishes at a\nferromagnetic quantum critical point (qcp). Remarkably, the superconductivity\nin UCoGe varies smoothly with pressure across the qcp and exists in both the\nferromagnetic and paramagnetic regimes. We argue that in UCoGe, spin-orbit\ninteractions stabilize a time-reversal invariant odd-parity superconductor in\nthe high pressure paramagnetic regime. Based on a simple phenomenological\nmodel, we predict that the transition from the paramagnetic normal state to the\nphase where superconductivity and ferromagnetism coexist, is a first-order\ntransition.\n", "  We show that the density-matrix states of noncomposite qudit systems satisfy\nentropic and information relations like the subadditivity condition, strong\nsubadditivity condition, and Araki--Lieb inequality, which characterize hidden\nquantum correlations of observables associated with these indivisible systems.\nWe derive these relations employing a specific map of the entropic inequalities\nknown for density matrices of multiqudit systems to the inequalities for\ndensity matrices of single-qudit systems. We present the obtained relations in\nthe form of mathematical inequalities for arbitrary Hermitian NxN-matrices. We\nconsider examples of superconducting qubits and qudits. We discuss the hidden\ncorrelations in single-qudit states as a new resource for quantum technologies\nanalogous to the known resource in correlations associated with the\nentanglement in multiqudit systems.\n", "  In many models incorporating the type-I seesaw mechanism, the right-handed\nneutrino ($N$) couples to heavy vector/scalar bosons and thereby has resonant\npair production. It barely receives attention thus far, however, it may provide\nthe best avenue to probe TeV scale $N$ without requiring anomalously large\nmixing between $N$ and the active neutrino $\\nu_L$. In this paper we explore\nthe discovery prospects of (mainly heavy) $N$ pair production at the 14 TeV LHC\nand future 100 TeV $pp$ collider, based on the three signatures: 1) trilepton\nfrom $ N(\\rightarrow \\ell W_\\ell)N(\\rightarrow \\ell W_h)$ with $W_{\\ell/h}$ the\nleptonically/hadronically decaying $W$; 2) boosted di-Higgs boson plus MET from\n$N(\\rightarrow \\nu_L h)N(\\rightarrow \\nu_L h)$; 3) a single boosted Higgs with\nleptons and MET from $N(\\rightarrow \\ell W_\\ell)N(\\rightarrow \\nu_L h)$. At the\n100 TeV collider, we also consider the situation when the Higgs boson is over\nboosted thus losing its jet substructure. Interpreting our tentative results in\nthe benchmark model, the local $B-L$ model, we find that the (multi-) TeV scale\n$N$ can be probed at the (100) 14 TeV colliders.\n", "  We investigate the symmetry structure of the non-relativistic limit of\nYang-Mills theories. Generalising previous results in the Galilean limit of\nelectrodynamics, we discover that for Yang-Mills theories there are a variety\nof limits inside the Galilean regime. We first explicitly work with the $SU(2)$\ntheory and then generalise to $SU(N)$ for all $N$, systematising our notation\nand analysis. We discover that the whole family of limits lead to different\nsectors of Galilean Yang-Mills theories and the equations of motion in each\nsector exhibit hitherto undiscovered infinite dimensional symmetries, viz.\ninfinite Galilean Conformal symmetries in $D=4$. These provide the first\nexamples of interacting Galilean Conformal Field Theories (GCFTs) in $D>2$.\n", "  A robust control over quantum dynamics is of paramount importance for quantum\ntechnologies. Many of the existing control techniques are based on smooth\nHamiltonian modulations involving repeated calculations of basic unitaries\nresulting in time complexities scaling rapidly with the length of the control\nsequence. On the other hand, the bang-bang controls need one-time calculation\nof basic unitaries and hence scale much more efficiently. By employing a global\noptimization routine such as the genetic algorithm, it is possible to\nsynthesize not only highly intricate unitaries, but also certain nonunitary\noperations. Here we demonstrate the unitary control through the first\nimplementation of the optimal fixed-point quantum search algorithm in a\nthree-qubit NMR system. More over, by combining the bang-bang pulses with the\ntwirling process, we also demonstrate a nonunitary transformation of the\nthermal equilibrium state into an effective pure state in a five-qubit NMR\nsystem.\n", "  Including the metric fluctuations of a realistic cosmological geometry we\nreconsider an earlier suggestion that measuring the relative time-of-flight of\nultra-relativistic particles can provide interesting constraints on fundamental\ncosmological and/or particle parameters. Using convenient properties of the\ngeodetic light-cone coordinates we first compute, to leading order in the\nLorentz factor and for a generic (inhomogeneous, anisotropic) space-time, the\nrelative arrival times of two ultra-relativistic particles as a function of\ntheir masses and energies as well as of the details of the large-scale\ngeometry. Remarkably, the result can be written as an integral over the\nunperturbed line-of-sight of a simple function of the local, inhomogeneous\nredshift. We then evaluate the irreducible scatter of the expected data-points\ndue to first-order metric perturbations, and discuss, for an ideal source of\nultra-relativistic particles, the resulting attainable precision on the\ndetermination of different physical parameters.\n", "  In this work, we have considered the formation of warm plasma sheath in the\nvicinity of a wall in a plasma with considerable presence of dust particles. As\nan example, we have used the parameters relevant in case of lunar plasma\nsheath, though the results obtained in this work could be applied to any other\nphysical situation such as laboratory plasma. In the ion-acoustic time scale,\nwe neglect the dust dynamics. The dust particles affect the sheath dynamics by\naffecting the Poisson equation which determines the plasma potential in the\nsheath region. We have assumed the current to a dust particle to be balanced\nthroughout the analysis. This makes the grain potential dependent on plasma\npotential, which is then incorporated into the Poisson equation. The resultant\nnumerical model becomes an initial value problem, which is described by a 1-D\nintegro-differential equation, which is then solved self-consistently by\nincorporating the change in plasma potential caused by inclusion of the dust\npotential in the Poisson equation.\n", "  Non-extremal black holes in $\\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravity have two horizons,\nthe geometric mean of whose areas recovers the horizon area of the extremal\nblack hole obtained from taking a smooth zero temperature limit. In prior work\n(arxiv:1410.3478), using the attractor mechanism, we deduced the existence of\nseveral moduli independent invariant quantities obtained from averaging over a\ndecoupled inter-horizon region. We establish that non-extremal geometries at\nthe Reissner--Nordstr\\\"om point, where the scalar moduli are held fixed, can be\nlifted to solutions in supergravity with a near-horizon AdS$_3\\times$S$^2$.\nThese solutions have the same entropy and temperature as the original black\nhole and therefore allow an interpretation of the underlying gravitational\ndegrees of freedom in terms of CFT$_2$. Symmetries of the moduli space enable\nus to explicate the origin of entropy in the extremal limit.\n", "  The Hermitian Hamiltonian of a spin one-half particle with spin-orbit\ncoupling (SOC) confined to a surface that is embedded in a three-dimensional\nspace spanned by a general Orthogonal Curvilinear Coordinate (OCC) is\nconstructed. A gauge field formalism, where the SOC is expressed as a\nnon-Abelian $SU(2)$ gauge field is used. A new practical approach, based on the\nphysical argument that upon confining the particle to the surface by a\npotential, then it is the physical Hermitian momentum operator transverse to\nthe surface, rather than just the derivative with respect to the transverse\ncoordinate that should be dropped from the Hamiltonian.Doing so, it is shown\nthat the Hermitian Hamiltonian for SOC is obtained with the geometric potential\nand the geometric kinetic energy terms emerging naturally. The geometric\npotential is shown to represent a coupling between the transverse component of\nthe gauge field and the mean curvature of the surface that replaces the\ncoupling between the transverse momentum and the gauge field. The most general\nHermitian Hamiltonian with linear SOC on a general surface embedded in any 3D\nOCC system is reported. Explicit plug-and-play formulae for this Hamiltonian on\nthe surfaces of a cylinder, a sphere and a torus are given. The formalism is\napplied to the Rashba SOC in three dimensions (3D RSOC) and the explicit\nexpressions for the surface Hamiltonians on these three geometries are worked\nout.\n", "  As an extension of earlier work on QED, we construct a BRST-invariant\nLagrangian for SU(N) Yang-Mills theory with fundamental matter, regulated by\nthe inclusion of massive Pauli-Villars (PV) gluons and PV quarks. The\nunderlying gauge symmetry for massless PV gluons is generalized to accommodate\nthe PV-index-changing currents that are required by the regularization.\nAuxiliary adjoint scalars are used, in a mechanism due to Stueckelberg, to\nattribute mass to the PV gluons and the PV quarks. The addition of\nFaddeev--Popov ghosts then establishes a residual BRST symmetry. Although there\nare drawbacks to the approach, in particular the computational load of a large\nnumber of PV fields and a nonlocal interaction of the ghost fields, this\nformulation could provide a foundation for renormalizable nonperturbative\nsolutions of light-front QCD in an arbitrary covariant gauge.\n", "  We demonstrate fully three-dimensional and patterned localization of\nnitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond with coherence times in excess of 1\nms. Nitrogen {\\delta}-doping during CVD diamond growth vertically confines\nnitrogen to 4 nm while electron irradiation with a transmission electron\nmicroscope (TEM) laterally confines vacancies to less than 1 {\\mu}m. We\ncharacterize the effects of electron energy and dose on NV formation.\nImportantly, our technique enables the formation of reliably high-quality NV\ncenters inside diamond nanostructures, with applications in quantum information\nand sensing.\n", "  We investigate feasibility of efficient baryogenesis at the electroweak scale\nwithin the effective field theory framework based on a non-linear realisation\nof the electroweak gauge symmetry. In this framework the LHC Higgs boson is\ndescribed by a singlet scalar field, which, therefore, admits new interactions.\nAssuming that Higgs couplings with the eletroweak gauge bosons are as in the\nStandard Model, we demonstrate that the Higgs cubic coupling and the\nCP-violating Higgs-top quark anomalous couplings alone may drive the a strongly\nfirst-order phase transition. The distinguished feature of this transition is\nthat the anomalous Higgs vacuum expectation value is generally non-zero in both\nphases. We identify a range of anomalous couplings, consistent with current\nexperimental data, where sphaleron rates are sufficiently fast in the\n'symmetric' phase and are suppressed in the 'broken' phase and demonstrate that\nthe desired baryon asymmetry can indeed be generated in this framework. This\nrange of the Higgs anomalous couplings can be further constrained from the LHC\nRun 2 data and be probed at high luminosity LHC and beyond.\n", "  Spatio-temporal interaction is inherent to cases of infectious diseases and\noccurrences of earthquakes, whereas the spread of other events, such as cancer\nor crime, is less evident. Statistical significance tests of space-time\nclustering usually assess the correlation between the spatial and temporal\n(transformed) distances of the events. Although appealing through simplicity,\nthese classical tests do not adjust for the underlying population nor can they\naccount for a distance decay of interaction. We propose to use the framework of\nan endemic-epidemic point process model to jointly estimate a background event\nrate explained by seasonal and areal characteristics, as well as a superposed\nepidemic component representing the hypothesis of interest. We illustrate this\nnew model-based test for space-time interaction by analysing psychiatric\ninpatient admissions in Zurich, Switzerland (2007-2012). Several socio-economic\nfactors were found to be associated with the admission rate, but there was no\nevidence of general clustering of the cases.\n", "  We construct higher-derivative gravities with a non-minimally coupled Maxwell\nfield. The Lagrangian consists of polynomial invariants built from the Riemann\ntensor and the Maxwell field strength in such a way that the equations of\nmotion are second order for both the metric and the Maxwell potential. We also\ngeneralize the construction to involve a generic non-minimally coupled $p$-form\nfield strength. We then focus on one low-lying example in four dimensions and\nconstruct the exact magnetically-charged black holes. We also construct exact\nelectrically-charged $z=2$ Lifshitz black holes. We obtain approximate dyonic\nblack holes for the small coupling constant or small charges. We find that the\nthermodynamics based on the Wald formalism disagrees with that derived from the\nEuclidean action procedure, suggesting this may be a general situation in\nhigher-derivative gravities with non-minimally coupled form fields. As an\napplication in the AdS/CFT correspondence, we study the entropy/viscosity ratio\nfor the AdS or Lifshitz planar black holes, and find that the exact ratio can\nbe obtained without having to know the details of the solutions, even for this\nhigher-derivative theory.\n", "  The discovery of pulsars as heavy as 2 solar masses has led astrophysicists\nto rethink the core compositions of neutron stars, ruling out many models for\nthe nuclear equations of state (EoS). We explore the hybrid stars that occur\nwhen hadronic matter is treated in a relativistic mean-field approximation and\nquark matter is modeled by three-flavor local and non-local Nambu Jona-Lasinio\n(NJL) models with repulsive vector interactions. The NJL models typically yield\nequations of state that feature a first order transition to quark matter.\nAssuming that the quark-hadron surface tension is high enough to disfavour\nmixed phases, and restricting to EoSes that allow stars to reach 2 solar\nmasses, we find that the appearance of the quark matter core either\ndestabilizes the star immediately (this is typical for non-local NJL models) or\nleads to a very short hybrid star branch in the mass-radius relation (this is\ntypical for local NJL models). Using the Constant-Sound-Speed parametrization\nwe can see that the reason for the near-absence of hybrid stars is that the\ntransition pressure is fairly high and the transition is strongly first order.\n", "  Dispersive shock waves and solitons are fundamental nonlinear excitations in\ndispersive media, but dispersive shock wave studies to date have been severely\nconstrained. Here we report on a novel dispersive hydrodynamics testbed: the\neffectively frictionless dynamics of interfacial waves between two high\ncontrast, miscible, low Reynolds' number Stokes fluids. This scenario is\nrealized by injecting from below a lighter, viscous fluid into a column filled\nwith high viscosity fluid. The injected fluid forms a deformable pipe whose\ndiameter is proportional to the injection rate, enabling precise control over\nthe generation of symmetric interfacial waves. Buoyancy drives nonlinear\ninterfacial self-steepening while normal stresses give rise to dispersion of\ninterfacial waves. Extremely slow mass diffusion and mass conservation imply\nthat the interfacial waves are effectively dissipationless. This enables high\nfidelity observations of large amplitude dispersive shock waves in this\nspatially extended system, found to agree quantitatively with a nonlinear wave\naveraging theory. Furthermore, several highly coherent phenomena are\ninvestigated including dispersive shock wave backflow, the refraction or\nabsorption of solitons by dispersive shock waves, and the multi-phase merging\nof two dispersive shock waves. The complex, coherent, nonlinear mixing of\ndispersive shock waves and solitons observed here are universal features of\ndissipationless, dispersive hydrodynamic flows.\n", "  We review methods and results for extracting the anomalous dimensions of\noperators from lattice field theory calculations. The most important\napplication is the anomalous mass dimension in conformal or nearly conformal\ngauge field theories which might be related to dynamical electroweak symmetry\nbreaking. Some discussion of the underlying theory of renormalization and\nmixing of operators is also included.\n", "  The SM prediction for the ratio $\\varepsilon^\\prime/\\varepsilon$ appears to\nbe significantly below the experimental data. Also $\\varepsilon_K$ in the SM\ntends to be below the data. Any NP removing these anomalies will first of all\nhave impact on flavour observables in the $K$ meson system, in particular on\nrare $K$ decays and $\\Delta M_K$. Restricting the operators contributing to\n$\\varepsilon^\\prime/\\varepsilon$ to the SM ones and to the corresponding primed\noperators, NP contributions are quite generally dominated either by QCD penguin\n(QCDP) operators $Q_6(Q_6^\\prime)$ or electroweak penguin (EWP) operators\n$Q_8(Q_8^\\prime)$ with rather different implications for other flavour\nobservables. We discuss general models with tree-level $Z$ and $Z^\\prime$\nflavour violating exchanges and few specific models. We find that simultaneous\nenhancements of $\\varepsilon^\\prime/\\varepsilon$, $\\varepsilon_K$,\n$\\mathcal{B}(K_L\\to\\pi^0\\nu\\bar\\nu)$ and $\\mathcal{B}(K^+\\to\\pi^+\\nu\\bar\\nu)$\nin $Z$ scenarios are only possible in the presence of both LH and RH\nflavour-violating couplings. In $Z^\\prime$ scenarios this is not required but\nthe size of NP effects and the correlation between\n$\\mathcal{B}(K_L\\to\\pi^0\\nu\\bar\\nu)$ and $\\mathcal{B}(K^+\\to\\pi^+\\nu\\bar\\nu)$\ndepends strongly on whether QCDP or EWP dominate NP contributions to\n$\\varepsilon^\\prime/\\varepsilon$. In the QCDP case possible enhancements of\nboth branching ratios are much larger than for EWP scenario and take place only\non the branch parallel to the Grossman-Nir bound, which is in the case of EWP\ndominance only possible in the absence of NP in $\\varepsilon_K$. QCDP and EWP\nscenarios of NP in $\\varepsilon^\\prime/\\varepsilon$ can also be uniquely\ndistinguished by the size and the sign of NP contribution to $\\Delta M_K$,\nelevating the importance of the precise calculation of $\\Delta M_K$ in the SM.\n", "  We study a class of six-dimensional models based on positive curvature\nsurfaces (spherical 2-orbifolds) as extra-spaces. Using the Newman-Penrose\nformalism, we discuss the particle spectrum in this class of models. The\nfermion spectrum problem, which has been addressed with flux compactifications\nin the past, can be avoided using localised fermions. In this framework, we\nfind that there are four types of geometry compatible with the existence of a\nstable dark matter candidate and we study the simplest case in detail. Using\nthe complementarity between collider resonance searches and relic density\nconstraints, we show that this class of models is under tension, unless the\nmodel lies in a funnel region characterised by a resonant Higgs s-channel in\nthe dark matter annihilation.\n", "  We present TYC 2505-672-1 as a newly discovered and remarkable eclipsing\nsystem comprising an M-type red giant that undergoes a ~3.45 year long,\nnear-total eclipse (depth of ~4.5 mag) with a very long period of ~69.1 yr. TYC\n2505-672-1 is now the longest-period eclipsing binary system yet discovered,\nmore than twice as long as that of the currently longest-period system,\n$\\epsilon$ Aurigae. We show from analysis of the light curve including both our\nown data and historical data spanning more than 120 yr and from modeling of the\nspectral energy distribution, both before and during eclipse, that the red\ngiant primary is orbited by a moderately hot source (T$_{eff}$~8000 K) that is\nitself surrounded by an extended, opaque circumstellar disk. From the measured\nratio of luminosities, the radius of the hot companion must be in the range\n0.1-0.5 Rsun (depending on the assumed radius of the red giant primary), which\nis an order of magnitude smaller than that for a main sequence A star and 1-2\norders of magnitude larger than that for a white dwarf. The companion is\ntherefore most likely a \"stripped red giant\" subdwarf-B type star destined to\nbecome a He white dwarf. It is however somewhat cooler than most sdB stars,\nimplying a very low mass for this \"pre-He-WD\" star. The opaque disk surrounding\nthis hot source may be a remnant of the stripping of its former hydrogen\nenvelope. However, it is puzzling how this object became stripped, given that\nit is at present so distant (orbital semi-major axis of ~24 AU) from the\ncurrent red giant primary star. Extrapolating from our calculated ephemeris,\nthe next eclipse should begin in early UT 2080 April and end in mid UT 2083\nSeptember (eclipse center UT 2081 December 24). This system is poised to become\nan exemplar of a very rare class of systems, even more extreme in several\nrespects than the well studied archetype $\\epsilon$ Aurigae.\n", "  The recent excess in diphoton events around 750 GeV seen by the ATLAS and CMS\nexperiments could be hinting at the existence of new vector-like charged matter\naround the TeV scale which couples to a singlet. Such a spectrum of exotics\narises inevitably in certain classes of F-theory GUTs with hypercharge flux\nwhen the GUT symmetry is extended by a U(1) symmetry under which the Higgs\nfields of the MSSM are not vector-like. The exotics are not vector-like under\nthe U(1) symmetry and therefore their mass is naturally related to its breaking\nscale. Previously this scale was taken to be close to the GUT scale which led\nto tension with proton decay, the $\\mu$-term magnitude, and too large R-parity\nviolation. The 750 GeV excess provides new motivation for considering breaking\nthe U(1) around the TeV scale, which additionally alleviates the previous\nproblems. We study the possible TeV-scale spectrum in such an SU(5) GUT\nscenario and show that it is constrained and predictive. Gauge coupling\nunification can be retained at the accuracy of the MSSM at one loop even though\ntypically the spectrum does not form complete GUT representations. For example\nthe exotics cannot form a complete 10 multiplet but nonetheless happen to\nbehave as one in the beta functions. We present an initial analysis of the\ndiphoton production rates for the exotics spectra and find them compatible with\ndata.\n", "  In order to meet the requirement of BBN, the right handed neutrino is added\nto the singlet Higgs sector in the GNMSSM. The spectrum and Feynman rules are\ncalculated. the dark matter phenomenology is also studied. In case of $\\l\\sim\n0$, the singlet sector can give perfect explanation of relic abundance of dark\nmatter and small cosmological structure simulations. The BBN constraints on the\nlight mediator can be easily solved by decaying to the right handed neutrino.\nWhen the $\\l_N$ is at the order of $\\mathcal{O}(0.1)$, the mass of the mediator\ncan be constrained to several MeV\n", "  We interpret the 750-760 GeV diphoton resonance as one or more of the\nspinless components of a singlet superfield arising from the three\n27-dimensional representations of $E_6$ in F-theory, which also contain three\ncopies of colour-triplet charge $\\mp 1/3$ vector-like fermions $D_i,\\bar{D}_i$\nand inert Higgs doublets to which the singlets may couple. For definiteness we\nconsider (without change) a model that was proposed some time ago which\ncontains such states, as well as bulk exotics, leading to gauge coupling\nunification. The smoking gun prediction of the model is the existence of other\nsimilar spinless resonances, possibly close in mass to 750-760 GeV, decaying\ninto diphotons, as well as the three families of vector-like fermions\n$D_i,\\bar{D}_i$.\n", "  It is unknown whether a bound on axion field ranges exists within quantum\ngravity. We study axion field ranges using extended supersymmetry, in\nparticular allowing an analysis within strongly coupled regions of moduli\nspace. We apply this strategy to Calabi-Yau compactifications with one and two\nK\\\"ahler moduli. We relate the maximally allowable decay constant to geometric\nproperties of the underlying Calabi-Yau geometry. In all examples we find a\nmaximal field range close to the reduced Planck mass (with the largest field\nrange being 3.25 $M_P$). On this perspective, field ranges relate to the\nintersection and instanton numbers of the underlying Calabi-Yau geometry.\n", "  The modeling of intrinsic noise in pulsar timing residual data is of crucial\nimportance for Gravitational Wave (GW) detection and pulsar timing\n(astro)physics in general. The noise budget in pulsars is a collection of\nseveral well studied effects including radiometer noise, pulse-phase jitter\nnoise, dispersion measure (DM) variations, and low frequency spin noise.\nHowever, as pulsar timing data continues to improve, non-stationary and\nnon-powerlaw noise terms are beginning to manifest which are not well modeled\nby current noise analysis techniques. In this work we use a trans-dimensional\napproach to model these non-stationary and non-powerlaw effects through the use\nof a wavelet basis and an interpolation based adaptive spectral modeling. In\nboth cases, the number of wavelets and the number of control points in the\ninterpolated spectrum are free parameters that are constrained by the data and\nthen marginalized over in the final inferences, thus fully incorporating our\nignorance of the noise model. We show that these new methods outperform\nstandard techniques when non-stationary and non-powerlaw noise is present. We\nalso show that these methods return results consistent with the standard\nanalyses when no such signals are present.\n", "  We report thermally activated transport resonances for biases below the\nsuperconducting energy gap in a carbon nanotube (CNT) quantum dot (QD) device\nwith a superconducting Pb and a normal metal contact. These resonances are due\nto the superconductor's finite quasi-particle population at elevated\ntemperatures and can only be observed when the QD life-time broadening is\nconsiderably smaller than the gap. This condition is fulfilled in our QD\ndevices with optimized Pd/Pb/In multi-layer contacts, which result in\nreproducibly large and \"clean\" superconducting transport gaps with a strong\nconductance suppression for subgap biases. We show that these gaps close\nmonotonically with increasing magnetic field and temperature. The accurate\ndescription of the subgap resonances by a simple resonant tunneling model\nillustrates the ideal characteristics of the reported Pb contacts and gives an\nalternative access to the tunnel coupling strengths in a QD.\n", "  We present a theoretical analysis of the normal and superfluid fractions of\nquantum fluids described by a nonequilibrium extension of the Gross-Pitaevskii\nequation in the presence of an external potential. Both disordered and regular\npotentials are considered. The normal and superfluid fractions are defined by\nthe response of the nonequilibrium quantum fluid to a vector potential, in\nanalogy with the equilibrium case. We find that the physical meaning of these\ndefinitions breaks down out of equilibrium. The normal and superfluid fractions\nno longer add up to one and for some types of external potentials, they can\neven become negative.\n", "  Linear stability of stratified two-phase flows in horizontal channels to\narbitrary wavenumber disturbances is studied. The problem is reduced to\nOrr-Sommerfeld equations for the stream function disturbances, defined in each\nsublayer and coupled via boundary conditions that account also for possible\ninterface deformation and capillary forces. Applying the Chebyshev collocation\nmethod, the equations and interface boundary conditions are reduced to the\ngeneralized eigenvalue problems solved by standard means of numerical linear\nalgebra for the entire spectrum of eigenvalues and the associated eigenvectors.\nSome additional conclusions concerning the instability nature are derived from\nthe most unstable perturbation patterns. The results are summarized in the form\nof stability maps showing the operational conditions at which a\nstratified-smooth flow pattern is stable. It is found that for gas-liquid and\nliquid-liquid systems the stratified flow with a smooth interface is stable\nonly in confined zone of relatively low flow rates, which is in agreement with\nexperiments, but is not predicted by long-wave analysis. Depending on the flow\nconditions, the critical perturbations can originate mainly at the interface\n(so-called \"interfacial modes of instability\") or in the bulk of one of the\nphases (i.e., \"shear modes\"). The present analysis revealed that there is no\ndefinite correlation between the type of instability and the perturbation\nwavelength.\n", "  Information processing techniques based on sparseness have been actively\nstudied in several disciplines. Among them, a mathematical framework to\napproximately express a given dataset by a combination of a small number of\nbasis vectors of an overcomplete basis is termed the {\\em sparse\napproximation}. In this paper, we apply simulated annealing, a metaheuristic\nalgorithm for general optimization problems, to sparse approximation in the\nsituation where the given data have a planted sparse representation and noise\nis present. The result in the noiseless case shows that our simulated annealing\nworks well in a reasonable parameter region: the planted solution is found\nfairly rapidly. This is true even in the case where a common relaxation of the\nsparse approximation problem, the $\\ell_1$-relaxation, is ineffective. On the\nother hand, when the dimensionality of the data is close to the number of\nnon-zero components, another metastable state emerges, and our algorithm fails\nto find the planted solution. This phenomenon is associated with a first-order\nphase transition. In the case of very strong noise, it is no longer meaningful\nto search for the planted solution. In this situation, our algorithm determines\na solution with close-to-minimum distortion fairly quickly.\n", "  Travelling-wave solutions are shown to bifurcate from relative periodic\norbits in plane Poiseuille flow at Re = 2000 in a saddle-node infinite period\nbifurcation. These solutions consist in self-sustaining sinuous\nquasi-streamwise streaks and quasi- streamwise vortices located in the bulk of\nthe flow. The lower branch travelling-wave solutions evolve into spanwise\nlocalized states when the spanwise size Lz of the domain in which they are\ncomputed is increased. On the contrary, upper branch of travelling-wave\nsolutions develop multiple streaks when Lz is increased. Upper branch\ntravelling-wave solutions can be continued into coherent solutions of the\nfiltered equations used in large-eddy simulations where they represent\nturbulent coherent large-scale motions.\n", "  We consider the optical conductivity in the one dimensional Hubbard model in\nthe metallic phase close to half filling. In this regime most of the spectral\nweight is located at frequencies above an energy scale $E_{\\rm opt}$ that tends\ntowards the optical gap in the Mott insulating phase for vanishing doping.\nUsing the Bethe Ansatz we relate $E_{\\rm opt}$ to thresholds of particular\nkinds of excitations in the Hubbard model. We then employ a mobile impurity\nmodels to analyze the optical conductivity for frequencies slightly above these\nthresholds. This entails generalizing mobile impurity models to excited states\nthat are not highest weight with regards to the SU(2) symmetries of the Hubbard\nchain, and that occur at a maximum of the impurity dispersion.\n", "  We consider the class of jet shapes known as angularities in dijet production\nat hadron colliders. These angularities are modified from the original\ndefinitions in e+e- collisions to be boost invariant along the beam axis. These\nshapes apply to the constituents of jets defined with respect to either\nk_T-type (anti-k_T, C/A, and k_T) algorithms and cone-type algorithms. We\npresent an SCET factorization formula and calculate the ingredients needed to\nachieve next-to-leading-log (NLL) accuracy in kinematic regions where\nnon-global logarithms are not large. The factorization formula involves\npreviously unstudied \"unmeasured beam functions,\" which are present for finite\nrapidity cuts around the beams. We derive relations between the jet functions\nand the shape-dependent part of the soft function that appear in the factorized\ncross section and those previously calculated for e+e- collisions, and present\nthe calculation of the non-trivial, color-connected part of the soft-function\nto O(\\alpha_s). This latter part of the soft function is universal in the sense\nthat it applies to any experimental setup with an out-of-jet p_T veto and\nrapidity cuts together with two tagged jets and it is independent of the choice\nof jet (sub-)structure measurement. In addition, we implement the recently\nintroduced soft-collinear refactorization to resum logarithms of the jet size,\nvalid in the region of non-enhanced non-global logarithm effects. While our\nresults are valid for all 2 \\to 2 channels, we compute explicitly for the qq'\n\\to qq' channel the color-flow matrices and plot the NLL resummed differential\ndijet cross section as an explicit example, which shows that the normalization\nand scale uncertainty is reduced when the soft function is refactorized. For\nthis channel, we also plot the jet size R dependence, the p_T^{\\rm cut}\ndependence, and the dependence on the angularity parameter a.\n", "  As the majority of LHC searches are focused on prompt signatures, specific\nlong-lived particles have the potential to be overlooked by the otherwise\nsystematic new physics programs at ATLAS and CMS. While in many cases\nlong-lived superparticles are now stringently constrained by existing exotic\nsearches, we point out that the highly motivated model of gauge mediation with\nstaus as the next-to-lightest superparticle (NLSP) has received less attention.\nWe recast LHC searches for heavy stable charged particles, disappearing tracks,\nand opposite-flavor leptons with large impact parameters to assess current\nconstraints on a variety of spectra that contain an NLSP stau, and find that\nportions of the parameter space motivated by naturalness are still\nexperimentally unexplored. We additionally note a gap in the current\nexperimental search program: same-flavor leptons with large impact parameters\nevade the suite of existing searches for long-lived objects. This gap is\nespecially noteworthy as vetoes on displaced leptons in prompt new physics\nsearches could be systematically discarding such events. We discuss several\nmotivated models that can exhibit same-flavor displaced leptons: gauge\nmediation with co-NLSP sleptons, extended gauge mediation, R-parity violation,\nand lepton-flavored dark matter that freezes in during a matter-dominated era\nof the early universe. To address this gap, we propose a straightforward\nextension of the CMS search for leptons with large impact parameters, and\nproject sensitivity to these scenarios at 13 TeV. Throughout this analysis, we\nhighlight several methods whereby LHC searches for exotic long-lived objects\ncould potentially improve their sensitivity to the displaced leptons\noriginating from gauge mediation and beyond.\n", "  Many classes of two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as potential\nplatforms for novel electronic and optical devices. However, the physical\nproperties are strongly influenced by nanoscale heterogeneities in the form of\nedges, grain boundaries, and nucleation sites. Using combined tip-enhanced\nRaman scattering (TERS) and photoluminescence (TEPL) nano-spectroscopy and\n-imaging, we study the associated effects on the excitonic properties in\nmonolayer WSe2 grown by physical vapor deposition (PVD). With <15 nm spatial\nresolution we resolve nonlocal nanoscale correlations of PL spectral intensity\nand shifts with crystal edges and internal twin boundaries associated with the\nexpected exciton diffusion length. Through an active atomic force tip\ninteraction we can control the crystal strain on the nanoscale, and tune the\nlocal bandgap in reversible (up to 24 meV shift) and irreversible (up to 48 meV\nshift) fashion. This allows us to distinguish the effect of strain from the\ndominant influence of defects on the PL modification at the different\nstructural heterogeneities. Hybrid nano-optical and nano-mechanical imaging and\nspectroscopy thus enables the systematic study of the coupling of structural\nand mechanical degrees of freedom to the nanoscale electronic and optical\nproperties in layered 2D materials.\n", "  We present a short and novel derivation of the Schwinger mechanism for\nparticle pair production in $1+1$ dimensional de Sitter and Anti de Sitter\nspacetimes. We work directly in the flat embedding space and derive the pair\nproduction rates in these spacetimes via instanton methods. The derivation is\nmanifestly coordinate independent, and also lends support to the possible deep\nconnection between two conceptually disparate quantum phenomena - Schwinger\neffect and the Davies-Unruh effect.\n", "  We use the Shadow Wave Function formalism as a convenient model to study the\nfermion sign problem affecting all projector Quantum Monte Carlo methods in\ncontinuum space. We demonstrate that the efficiency of imaginary time\nprojection algorithms decays exponentially with increasing number of particles\nand/or imaginary-time propagation. Moreover, we derive an analytical expression\nthat connects the localization of the system with the magnitude of the sign\nproblem, illustrating this prediction through some numerical results. Finally,\nwe discuss the fermion sign problem computational complexity and methods for\nalleviating its severity.\n", "  Advanced synthesis of semiconductor nanowires (NWs) enables their application\nin diverse fields, notably in chemical and electrical sensing, photovoltaics,\nor quantum electronic devices. In particular, Indium Arsenide (InAs) NWs are an\nideal platform for quantum devices, e.g. they may host topological Majorana\nstates. While the synthesis has been continously perfected, only few techniques\nwere developed to tailor individual NWs after growth. Here we present three wet\nchemical etch methods for the post-growth morphological engineering of InAs NWs\non the sub-100 nm scale. The first two methods allow the formation of\nself-aligned electrical contacts to etched NWs, while the third method results\nin conical shaped NW profiles ideal for creating smooth electrical potential\ngradients and shallow barriers. Low temperature experiments show that NWs with\netched segments have stable transport characteristics and can serve as building\nblocks of quantum electronic devices. As an example we report the formation of\na single electrically stable quantum dot between two etched NW segments.\n", "  We adapt the Boson-Fermion superconductivity model to include layered systems\nsuch as underdoped cuprate superconductors. These systems are represented by an\ninfinite layered structure containing a mixture of paired and unpaired\nfermions. The former, which stand for the superconducting carriers, are\nconsidered as noninteracting zero spin composite-bosons with a linear\nenergy-momentum dispersion relation in the CuO$_2$ planes where superconduction\nis predominant, coexisting with the unpaired fermions in a pattern of stacked\nslabs. The inter-slab, penetrable, infinite planes are generated by a Dirac\ncomb potential, while paired and unpaired electrons (or holes) are free to move\nparallel to the planes. Composite-bosons condense at a critical temperature at\nwhich they exhibit a jump in their specific heat. These two values are assumed\nto be equal to the superconducting critical temperature $T_c$ and the specific\nheat jump reported for YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{6.80}$ to fix our model parameters\nnamely, the plane impenetrability and the fraction of superconducting charge\ncarriers. We then calculate the isochoric and isobaric electronic specific\nheats for temperatures lower than $T_c$ of both, the composite-bosons and the\nunpaired fermions, which matches recent experimental curves. From the latter,\nwe extract the linear coefficient ($\\gamma_n$) at $T_c$, as well as the\nquadratic ($\\alpha T^2$) term for low temperatures. We also calculate the\nlattice specific heat from the ARPES phonon spectrum, and add it to the\nelectronic part, reproducing the experimental total specific heat at and below\n$T_c$ within a $5 \\%$ error range, from which the cubic ($\\ss T^3$) term for\nlow temperatures is obtained. In addition, we show that this model reproduces\nthe cuprates mass anisotropies.\n", "  Geography effect is investigated for the Chinese stock market including the\nShanghai and Shenzhen stock markets, based on the daily data of individual\nstocks. The Shanghai city and the Guangdong province can be identified in the\nstock geographical sector. By investigating a geographical correlation on a\ngeographical parameter, the stock location is found to have an impact on the\nfinancial dynamics, except for the financial crisis time of the Shenzhen\nmarket. Stock distance effect is further studied, with a crossover behavior\nobserved for the stock distance distribution. The probability of the short\ndistance is much greater than that of the long distance. The average stock\ncorrelation is found to weakly decay with the stock distance for the Shanghai\nstock market, but stays nearly stable for different stock distance for the\nShenzhen stock market.\n", "  We investigate statistics of lead changes of the maxima of two discrete-time\nrandom walks in one dimension. We show that the average number of lead changes\ngrows as $\\pi^{-1}\\ln(t)$ in the long-time limit. We present theoretical and\nnumerical evidence that this asymptotic behavior is universal. Specifically,\nthis behavior is independent of the jump distribution: the same asymptotic\nunderlies standard Brownian motion and symmetric Levy flights. We also show\nthat the probability to have at most n lead changes behaves as $t^{-1/4}[\\ln\nt]^n$ for Brownian motion and as $t^{-\\beta(\\mu)}[\\ln t]^n$ for symmetric Levy\nflights with index $\\mu$. The decay exponent $\\beta(\\mu)$ varies continuously\nwith the Levy index when $0<\\mu<2$, while $\\beta=1/4$ for $\\mu>2$.\n", "  The interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (iDMI), surface anisotropy\nenergy, and spin pumping at the Ir/Co interface are experimentally investigated\nby performing Brillouin light scattering. Contrary to previous reports, we\nsuggest that the sign of the iDMI at the Ir/Co interface is the same as in the\ncase of the Pt/Co interface. We also find that the magnitude of the iDMI energy\ndensity is relatively smaller than in the case of the Pt/Co interface, despite\nthe large strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) of Ir. The saturation magnetization\nand the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) energy are significantly\nimproved due to a strong SOC. Our findings suggest that an SOC in an Ir/Co\nsystem behaves in different ways for iDMI and PMA. Finally, we determine the\nspin pumping effect at the Ir/Co interface, and it increases the Gilbert\ndamping constant from 0.012 to 0.024 for 1.5 nmthick Co.\n", "  Externally applied electromagnetic fields in general have an influence on the\nwidth of atomic spectral lines. The decay rates of atomic states can also be\naffected by the geometry of an applied field configuration giving rise to an\nimaginary geometric phase. A specific chiral electromagnetic field\nconfiguration is presented which geometrically modifies the lifetimes of\nmetastable states of hydrogen. We propose to extract the relevant observables\nin a realistic longitudinal atomic beam spin-echo apparatus which allows the\ninitial and final fluxes of the metastable atoms to be compared with each other\ninterferometrically. A geometry-induced change in lifetimes at the 5%-level is\nfound, an effect large enough to be observed in an available experiment.\n", "  We study the three-flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model with various\nregularization procedures. We perform parameter fitting in each regularization\nand apply the obtained parameter sets to evaluate various physical quantities,\nseveral light meson masses, decay constant and the topological susceptibility.\nThe model parameters are adopted even at very high cutoff scale compare to the\nhadronic scale to study the asymptotic behavior of the model. It is found that\nall the regularization methods except for the dimensional one actually lead\nreliable physical predictions for the kaon decay constant, sigma meson mass and\ntopological susceptibility without restricting the ultra-violet cutoff below\nthe hadronic scale.\n", "  We study the injection mechanism of a single electron from a static quantum\ndot into a moving quantum dot created in a long depleted channel with surface\nacoustic waves (SAWs). We demonstrate that such a process is characterized by\nan activation law with a threshold that depends on the SAW amplitude and the\ndot-channel potential gradient. By increasing sufficiently the SAW modulation\namplitude, we can reach a regime where the transfer is unitary and potentially\nadiabatic. This study points at the relevant regime to use moving dots in\nquantum information protocols.\n", "  We consider a thought experiment where two distinct species of 2D particles\nin a perpendicular magnetic field interact via repulsive potentials. If the\nmagnetic field and the interactions are strong enough, one type of particles\nforms a Laughlin state and the other ones couple to Laughlin quasi-holes. We\nshow that in this situation, the motion of the second type of particles is\ndescribed by an effective Hamiltonian, corresponding to the magnetic gauge\npicture for non-interacting anyons. The argument is in accord with, but\ndistinct from, the Berry phase calculation of Arovas-Schrieffer-Wilczek. It\nsuggests possibilities to observe the influence of effective anyon statistics\nin fractional quantum Hall systems.\n", "  Ion Beam Sputtering (IBS) is a cost-effective technique able to produce\nordered nanopatterns on the surfaces of different materials. To date, most\ntheoretical studies of this process have focused on systems which become\namorphous under irradiation, e.g. semiconductors at room temperature. Thus, in\nspite of the large amount of experimental work on metals, or more recently on\nsemiconductors at high temperatures, such experimental contexts have received\nrelatively little theoretical attention. These systems are characterized by\ntransport mechanisms, e.g. surface diffusion, which are anisotropic as a\nreflection of the crystalline structure not being overruled by the irradiation.\nHere, we generalize a previous continuum theory of IBS at normal incidence, in\norder to account for anisotropic surface diffusion. We explore systematically\nour generalized model in order to understand the role of anisotropy in the\nspace ordering properties of the resulting patterns. In particular, we derive a\nheight equation which predicts morphological transitions among hexagonal and\nrectangular patterns as a function of system parameters and employ an angular\ncorrelation function to assess these pattern symmetries. By suitably choosing\nexperimental conditions, it is found that one might be able to experimentally\ncontrol the type of order displayed by the patterns produced.\n", "  We try to interpret the 750 GeV diphoton excess in the Minimal Dilaton Model,\nwhich extends the SM by adding one linearized dilaton field and vector-like\nfermions. We first show by analytic formulae in this framework that the\nproduction rates of the $\\gamma \\gamma$, $gg$, $Z\\gamma$, $ZZ$, $WW^\\ast$,\n$t\\bar{t}$ and $hh$ signals at the $750 {\\rm GeV}$ resonance are only sensitive\nto the dilaton-Higgs mixing angle $\\theta_S$ and the parameter $\\eta \\equiv v\nN_X/f$, where $f$ is the dilaton decay constant and $N_X$ denotes the number of\nthe fermions. Then we scan the two parameters by considering various\ntheoretical and experimental constraints to find the solutions to the diphoton\nexcess. We conclude that the model can predict the central value of the\ndiphoton rate without conflicting with any constraints. The signatures of our\nexplanation at the LHC Run II and the vacuum stability at high energy scale are\nalso discussed.\n", "  We calculate all tree level string theory vacuum to Dp-brane disc amplitudes\ninvolving an arbitrary RR-state and two NS-NS vertex operators. This\ncomputation was earlier performed by K. Becker, Guo, and Robbins for the\nsimplest case of a RR-state of type C_{p-3}. Here we use the aid of a computer\nto calculate all possible three-point amplitudes involving a RR-vertex operator\nof type C_{p+1+2k}.\n", "  We propose that the possible 750 GeV diphoton excess can be explained in the\ncolor-octet neutrino mass model extended with a scalar singlet $\\Phi$. The\nmodel generally contains $N_s$ species of color-octet, electroweak doublet\nscalars $S$ and $N_f$ species of color-octet, electroweak triplet $\\chi$ or\nsinglet $\\rho$ fermions. While both scalars and fermions contribute to the\nproduction of $\\Phi$ through gluon fusion, only the charged members induce the\ndiphoton decay of $\\Phi$. The diphoton rate can be significantly enhanced due\nto interference between the scalar and fermion loops. We show that the diphoton\ncross section can be from 3 to 10 fb for O(TeV) color-octet particles while\nevading all current LHC limits.\n", "  In this Letter we focus our attention on the IceCube events in the energy\nrange between 60 and 100 TeV, which show an order 2-sigma excess with respect\nto a power-law with spectral index 2. We analyze the possible origin of such an\nexcess by comparing the distribution of the arrival directions of IceCube\nevents with the angular distributions of simply distributed astrophysical\ngalactic/extragalactic sources, as well as with the expected flux coming from\nDM interactions (decay and annihilation) for different DM profiles. The\nstatistical analysis performed seems to disfavor the correlation with the\ngalactic plane, whereas rules out the DM annihilation scenario only in case of\nsmall clumpiness effect. The small statistics till now collected does not allow\nto scrutinize the cases of astrophysical isotropic distribution and DM decay\nscenarios. For this reason we perform a forecast analysis in order to stress\nthe role of future Neutrino Telescopes.\n", "  A superconducting wire described by a p-wave pairing and a Kitaev Hamiltonian\nexhibits Majorana fermions at its edges and is topologically protected by\nsymmetry. We consider two Kitaev wires (chains) coupled by a Coulomb type\ninteraction and study the complete phase diagram using analytical and numerical\ntechniques. A topological superconducting phase with four Majorana fermions\noccurs until moderate interactions between chains. For large interactions, both\nrepulsive and attractive, by analogy with the Hubbard model, we identify Mott\nphases with Ising type magnetic order. For repulsive interactions, the Ising\nantiferromagnetic order favors the occurrence of orbital currents spontaneously\nbreaking time-reversal symmetry. By strongly varying the chemical potentials of\nthe two chains, quantum phase transitions towards fully polarized (empty or\nfull) fermionic chains occur. In the Kitaev model, the quantum critical point\nseparating the topological superconducting phase and the polarized phase\nbelongs to the universality class of the critical Ising model in two\ndimensions. When increasing the Coulomb interaction between chains, then we\nidentify an additional phase corresponding to two critical Ising theories (or\ntwo chains of Majorana fermions). We confirm the existence of such a phase from\nexact mappings and from the concept of bipartite fluctuations. We show the\nexistence of negative logarithmic corrections in the bipartite fluctuations, as\na reminiscence of the quantum critical point in the Kitaev model. Other\nentanglement probes such as bipartite entropy and entanglement spectrum are\nalso used to characterize the phase diagram. The limit of large interactions\ncan be reached in an equivalent setup of ultra-cold atoms and Josephson\njunctions.\n", "  We report experimentally and theoretically the behavior of freestanding\ngraphene subject to bombardment of energetic ions, investigating the ability of\nlarge-scale patterning of freestanding graphene with nanometer sized features\nby focused ion beam technology. A precise control over the He+ and Ga+\nirradiation offered by focused ion beam techniques enables to investigate the\ninteraction of the energetic particles and graphene suspended with no support\nand allows determining sputter yields of the 2D lattice. We find strong\ndependency of the 2D sputter yield on the species and kinetic energy of the\nincident ion beams. Freestanding graphene shows material semi-transparency to\nHe+ at high energies (10-30 keV) allowing the passage of >97% He+ particles\nwithout creating destructive lattice vacancy. Large Ga+ ions (5-30 keV), in\ncontrast, collide far more often with the graphene lattice to impart\nsignificantly higher sputter yield of ~50%. Binary collision theory applied to\nmonolayer and few-layer graphene can successfully elucidate this collision\nmechanism, in great agreement with experiments. Raman spectroscopy analysis\ncorroborates the passage of a large fraction of He+ ions across graphene\nwithout much damaging the lattice whereas several colliding ions create single\nvacancy defects. Physical understanding of the interaction between energetic\nparticles and suspended graphene can practically lead to reproducible and\nefficient pattern generation of unprecedentedly small features on 2D materials\nby design, manifested by our perforation of sub-5-nm pore arrays. This\ncapability of nanometer scale precision patterning of freestanding 2D lattices\nshows practical applicability of the focused ion beam technology to 2D material\nprocessing for device fabrication and integration.\n", "  We document the similarities in composition between the equatorial basins Tui\nRegio, Hotei Regio, and other 5-$\\mu$m-bright materials, notably the north\npolar evaporites, by investigating the presence and extent of an absorption\nfeature at 4.92 $\\mu$m. In most observations, Woytchugga Lacuna, Ontario Lacus,\nMacKay Lacus, deposits near Fensal, some of the lakes and dry lake beds south\nof Ligeia, and the southern shores of Kraken Mare share the absorption feature\nat 4.92 \\um observed in the spectra of Tui and Hotei. Besides Woytchugga and at\nFensal, these 5-$\\mu$m-bright deposits are geomorphologically-substantiated\nevaporites. Thus, the similarity in composition strengthens the hypothesis that\nTui and Hotei once contained liquid. Other evaporite deposits, however, do not\nshow the 4.92 \\um absorption, notably Muggel Lacus and the shores of Ligeia\nMare at the north pole. This difference in composition suggests that there are\nmore than one kind of soluble material in Titan's lakes that can create\nevaporite and/or that the surface properties at the VIMS wavelength scale are\nnot uniform between the different deposits (crystal size, abundance, etc). Our\nresults indicate that the surface structure, composition, and formation history\nof Titan's evaporites may be at least as dynamic and complex as their Earth\ncounterparts.\n", "  The lowest neutron star masses currently measured are in the range\n$1.0-1.1~M_\\odot$, but these measurement have either large uncertainties or\nrefer to isolated neutron stars. The recent claim of a precisely measured mass\n$M/M_{\\odot} = 1.174 \\pm 0.004$ by Martinez et al [Astrophys. J. 812, 143\n(2015)] in a double neutron star system suggests that low-mass neutron stars\nmay be an interesting target for gravitational-wave detectors. Furthermore,\nSotani et al [PTEP 2014, 051E01 (2014)] recently found empirical formulas\nrelating the mass and surface redshift of nonrotating neutron stars to the\nstar's central density and to the parameter $\\eta\\equiv (K_0 L^2)^{1/3}$, where\n$K_0$ is the incompressibility of symmetric nuclear matter and $L$ is the slope\nof the symmetry energy at saturation density. Motivated by these\nconsiderations, we extend the work by Sotani et al to slowly rotating and\ntidally deformed neutron stars. We compute the moment of inertia, quadrupole\nmoment, quadrupole ellipticity, tidal and rotational Love number and apsidal\nconstant of slowly rotating neutron stars by integrating the Hartle-Thorne\nequations at second order in rotation, and we fit all of these quantities as\nfunctions of $\\eta$ and of the central density. These fits may be used to\nconstrain $\\eta$, either via observations of binary pulsars in the\nelectromagnetic spectrum, or via near-future observations of inspiralling\ncompact binaries in the gravitational-wave spectrum.\n", "  Melvin-Kerr black hole represents a generalization of the Kerr black hole to\nthe case of a non-vanishing external magnetic field via the Harrison\ntransformation. Conformal mechanics related to the near horizon limit of such a\nblack hole configuration is studied and its unique N=2 supersymmetric extension\nis constructed.\n", "  A novel radially local approximation of the drift kinetic equation is\npresented. The new drift kinetic equation that includes both ${\\bf E} \\times\n{\\bf B}$ and tangential magnetic drift terms is written in the conservative\nform and it has favorable properties for numerical simulation that any\nadditional terms for particle and energy sources are unnecessary for obtaining\nstationary solutions under the radially local approximation. These solutions\nsatisfy the intrinsic ambipolarity condition for neoclassical particle fluxes\nin the presence of quasisymmetry of the magnetic field strength. Also, another\nradially local drift kinetic equation is presented, from which the positive\ndefiniteness of entropy production due to neoclassical transport and Onsager\nsymmetry of neoclassical transport coefficients are derived while it sacrifices\nthe ambipolarity condition for neoclassical particle fluxes in axisymmetric and\nquasi-symmetric systems.\n", "  This article presents the sensitivity of the ATLAS experiment to the\nlepton-flavour-violating decays of $\\tau\\to 3\\mu$. A method utilising the\nproduction of $\\tau$ leptons via $W\\to\\tau\\nu$ decays is used. This method is\napplied to the sample of 20.3 fb$^{-1}$ of $pp$ collision data at a\ncentre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV collected by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC in\n2012. No event is observed passing the selection criteria, and the observed\n(expected) upper limit on the $\\tau$ lepton branching fraction into three\nmuons, ${\\rm Br}(\\tau\\to 3\\mu)$, is $3.76\\times 10^{-7}$ ($3.94\\times 10^{-7}$)\nat 90% confidence level.\n", "  Symmetry is conventionally described in a contrariety manner that the system\nis either completely symmetric or completely asymmetric. Using group\ntheoretical approach to overcome this dichotomous problem, we introduce the\ndegree of symmetry (DoS) as a non-negative continuous number ranging from zero\nto unity. DoS is defined through an average of the fidelity deviations of\nHamiltonian or quantum state over its transformation group G, and thus is\ncomputable by making use of the completeness relations of the irreducible\nrepresentations of G. The monotonicity of DoS can effectively probe the\nextended group for accidental degeneracy while its multi-valued natures\ncharacterize some (spontaneous) symmetry breaking.\n", "  In a recent paper, Tye and Wong (TW) have argued that sphaleron-induced\ntransitions in high-energy proton-proton collisions should be enhanced compared\nto previous calculations, based on a construction of a Bloch wave function in\nthe periodic sphaleron potential and the corresponding pass band structure.\nHere we convolute the calculations of TW with parton distribution functions and\nsimulations of final states to explore the signatures of sphaleron transitions\nat the LHC and possible future colliders. We calculate the increase of\nsphaleron transition rates in proton-proton collisions at centre-of-mass\nenergies of 13/14/33/100 TeV for different sphaleron barrier heights, while\nrecognising that the rates have large overall uncertainties. We use a\nsimulation to show that LHC searches for microscopic black holes should have\ngood efficiency for detecting sphaleron-induced final states, and discuss their\nexperimental signatures and observability in Run 2 of the LHC and beyond. We\nrecast the early ATLAS Run-2 search for microscopic black holes to constrain\nthe rate of sphaleron transitions at 13 TeV, deriving a significant limit on\nthe sphaleron transition rate for the nominal sphaleron barrier height of 9\nTeV.\n", "  We take a step towards a complete NLO-QCD determination of the production of\na pair of Higgs scalars in the MSSM. Exploiting a low-energy theorem that\nconnects the Higgs-gluon interactions to the derivatives of the gluon\nself-energy, we obtain analytic results for the one- and two-loop squark\ncontributions to Higgs pair production in the limit of vanishing external\nmomenta. We find that the two-loop squark contributions can have non-negligible\neffects in MSSM scenarios with stop masses below the TeV scale. We also show\nhow our results can be adapted to the case of Higgs pair production in the\nNMSSM.\n", "  If the recent indications of a possible state $\\Phi$ with mass $\\sim 750$ GeV\ndecaying into two photons reported by ATLAS and CMS in LHC collisions at 13 TeV\nwere to become confirmed, the prospects for future collider physics at the LHC\nand beyond would be affected radically, as we explore in this paper. Even\nminimal scenarios for the $\\Phi$ resonance and its $\\gamma \\gamma$ decays\nrequire additional particles with masses $\\gtrsim \\frac12 m_\\Phi$. We consider\nhere two benchmark scenarios that exemplify the range of possibilities: one in\nwhich $\\Phi$ is a singlet scalar or pseudoscalar boson whose production and\n$\\gamma \\gamma$ decays are due to loops of coloured and charged fermions, and\nanother benchmark scenario in which $\\Phi$ is a superposition of (nearly)\ndegenerate CP-even and CP-odd Higgs bosons in a (possibly supersymmetric)\ntwo-Higgs doublet model also with additional fermions to account for the\n$\\gamma \\gamma$ decay rate. We explore the implications of these benchmark\nscenarios for the production of $\\Phi$ and its new partners at colliders in\nfuture runs of the LHC and beyond, at higher-energy $pp$ colliders and at $e^+\ne^-$ and $\\gamma \\gamma$ colliders, with emphasis on the bosonic partners\nexpected in the doublet scenario and the fermionic partners expected in both\nscenarios.\n", "  The dynamical cluster approximation (DCA) and its DCA$^+$ extension use\ncoarse-graining of the momentum space to reduce the complexity of quantum\nmany-body problems, thereby mapping the bulk lattice to a cluster embedded in a\ndynamical mean-field host. Here, we introduce a new form of an interlaced\ncoarse-graining and compare it with the traditional coarse-graining. While it\ngives a more localized self-energy for a given cluster size, we show that it\nleads to more controlled results with weaker cluster shape and smoother cluster\nsize dependence, which converge to the results obtained from the standard\ncoarse-graining with increasing cluster size. Most importantly, the new\ncoarse-graining reduces the severity of the fermionic sign problem of the\nunderlying quantum Monte Carlo cluster solver and thus allows for calculations\non larger clusters. This enables the treatment of longer-ranged correlations\nthan those accessible with the standard coarse-graining and thus can allow for\nthe evaluation of the exact infinite cluster size result via finite size\nscaling. As a demonstration, we study the hole-doped two-dimensional Hubbard\nmodel and show that the interlaced coarse-graining in combination with the\nextended DCA$^+$ algorithm permits the determination of the superconducting\n$T_c$ on cluster sizes for which the results can be fit with a\nKosterlitz-Thouless scaling law.\n", "  The conventional surface integral formula $J_{\\rm surf}[\\Phi]$ and an\nalternative volume integral formula $J_{\\rm var}[\\Phi]$ are used to compute the\nasymptotic exchange splitting of the interaction energy of the hydrogen atom\nand a proton employing the primitive function $\\Phi$ in the form of its\ntruncated multipole expansion. Closed-form formulas are obtained for the\nasymptotics of $J_{\\rm surf}[\\Phi_N]$ and $J_{\\rm var}[\\Phi_N]$, where $\\Phi_N$\nis the multipole expansion of $\\Phi$ truncated after the $1/R^N$ term, $R$\nbeing the internuclear separation. It is shown that the obtained sequences of\napproximations converge to the exact results with the rate corresponding to the\nconvergence radius equal to 2 and 4 when the surface and the volume integral\nformulas are used, respectively. When the multipole expansion of a truncated,\n$K$th order polarization function is used to approximate the primitive function\nthe convergence radius becomes equal to unity in the case of\n$J_{\\textrm{var}}[\\Phi]$. At low order the observed convergence of $J_{\\rm\nvar}[\\Phi_N]$ is, however, geometric and switches to harmonic only at certain\nvalue of $N=N_c$ dependent on $K$. An equation for $N_c$ is derived which very\nwell reproduces the observed $K$-dependent convergence pattern. The results\nshed new light on the convergence properties of the conventional SAPT expansion\nused in applications to many-electron diatomics.\n", "  The results of a study of the beta decays of three proton-rich nuclei with\n$T_z=\\text{-}2$, namely $^{48}$Fe, $^{52}$Ni and $^{56}$Zn, produced in an\nexperiment carried out at GANIL, are reported. In all three cases we have\nextracted the half-lives and the total $\\beta$-delayed proton emission\nbranching ratios. We have measured the individual $\\beta$-delayed protons and\n$\\beta$-delayed $\\gamma$ rays and the branching ratios of the corresponding\nlevels. Decay schemes have been determined for the three nuclei, and new energy\nlevels are identified in the daughter nuclei. Competition between\n$\\beta$-delayed protons and $\\gamma$ rays is observed in the de-excitation of\nthe $T=2$ Isobaric Analogue States in all three cases. Absolute Fermi and\nGamow-Teller transition strengths have been determined. The mass excesses of\nthe nuclei under study have been deduced. In addition, we discuss in detail the\ndata analysis taking as a test case $^{56}$Zn, where the exotic $\\beta$-delayed\n$\\gamma$-proton decay has been observed.\n", "  We develop a general model of coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) impedance\nwith shielding provided by two parallel conducting plates. This model allows us\nto easily reproduce all previously known analytical CSR wakes and to expand the\nanalysis to the situations not explored before. It reduces calculations of the\nimpedance to taking integrals along the trajectory of the beam. New analytical\nresults are derived for the radiation impedance with shielding for the\nfollowing orbits: a kink, a bending magnet, a wiggler of finite length, and an\ninfinitely long wiggler. All our formulas are benchmarked agains numerical\nsimulations with the CSRZ computer code.\n", "  We propose a new non-perturbative method to search for marginal deformations\nin level truncated open string field theory. Instead of studying the flatness\nof the effective potential for the marginal field (which is not expected to\ngive a one-to-one parametrization of the BCFT moduli space), we identify a new\nnon-universal branch of the tachyon potential which, from known analytic\nexamples, is expected to parametrize the marginal flow in a much larger region\nof the BCFT moduli space. By a level 18 computation in Siegel gauge, we find an\nincreasingly flat effective potential in the non-universal sector, connected to\nthe perturbative vacuum and we confirm that the coefficient of the marginal\nfield (lambda_SFT) has a maximum compatible with the value where the solutions\nstop existing in the standard Sen-Zwiebach approach. At the maximal reachable\nlevel, the effective potential still deviates from flatness for large values of\nthe tachyon, but the Ellwood invariants stay close to the correct BCFT values\non the whole branch and the full periodic moduli space of the cosine\ndeformation is covered.\n", "  This is a survey of the electrostatic potentials produced by charged\nstraight-line segments, in various numbers of spatial dimensions, with\ncomparisons between uniformly charged segments and those having non-uniform\nlinear charge distributions that give rise to ellipsoidal equipotentials\nsurrounding the segments. A uniform linear distribution of charge is compatible\nwith ellipsoidal equipotentials only for three dimensions. In higher\ndimensions, the linear charge density giving rise to ellipsoidal equipotentials\nis counter-intuitive --- the charge distribution has a maximum at the center of\nthe segment and vanishes at the ends of the segment. Only in two dimensions is\nthe continuous charge distribution intuitive --- for that one case of\nellipsoidal equipotentials, the charge is peaked at the ends of the segment and\nminimized at the center.\n", "  Cool and dense ejections, typically H$_{\\alpha}$ surges, often appear\nalongside EUV or X-Ray coronal jets as a result of the emergence of magnetized\nplasma from the solar interior. Idealized numerical experiments explain those\nejections as being indirectly associated with the magnetic reconnection taking\nplace between the emerging and preexisting systems. However, those experiments\nmiss basic elements that can importantly affect the surge phenomenon. In this\npaper we study the cool surges using a realistic treatment of the radiation\ntransfer and material plasma properties. To that end, the Bifrost code is used,\nwhich has advanced modules for the equation of state of the plasma,\nphotospheric and chromospheric radiation transfer, heat conduction and\noptically thin radiative cooling. We carry out a 2.5D experiment of the\nemergence of magnetized plasma through (meso)granular convection cells and the\nlow atmosphere to the corona. Through detailed Lagrange tracing, we study the\nformation and evolution of the cool ejection and, in particular, the role of\nthe entropy sources: this allows us to discern families of evolutionary\npatterns for the plasma elements. In the launch phase many elements suffer\naccelerations well in excess of gravity; when nearing the apex of their\nindividual trajectories, instead, the plasma elements follow quasi-parabolic\ntrajectories with acceleration close to g$_{\\odot^{}}$. We show how the\nformation of the cool ejection is mediated by a wedge-like structure composed\nof two shocks, one of which leads to the detachment of the surge from the\noriginal emerged plasma dome.\n", "  We derive a quantum master equation for an atom coupled to a heat bath\nrepresented by a charged particle many-body environment. In Born-Markov\napproximation, the influence of the plasma environment on the reduced system is\ndescribed by the dynamical structure factor. Expressions for the profiles of\nspectral lines are obtained. Wave packets are introduced as robust states\nallowing for a quasi-classical description of Rydberg electrons. Transition\nrates for highly excited Rydberg levels are investigated. A circular-orbit wave\npacket approach has been applied, in order to describe the localization of\nelectrons within Rydberg states. The calculated transition rates are in a good\nagreement with experimental data.\n", "  In this paper we investigate how to realize various quite well known\ncosmological bouncing models in the context of the recently developed\nunimodular $F(R)$ gravity. Particularly, we shall study the matter bounce\nscenario, the singular bounce, the superbounce and a symmetric bounce scenario.\nWe present the behavior of the Hubble radius for each of the bouncing models we\nshall take into account and we investigate which era of the bouncing model is\nresponsible for the cosmological perturbations. As we shall demonstrate, the\nvarious bouncing models do not behave in the same way, so the cosmological\nperturbations for each model may correspond to a different era, in comparison\nto other models. Also we present which unimodular $F(R)$ gravity realizes each\nmodel. We also show that Newton's law is not modified in the unimodular $F(R)$\ngravity, which also is proven to be a ghost-free theory, and in addition we\ndiscuss the matter stability issue. Finally, we demonstrate how it is possible\nto solve a cosmological constant problem in the context of unimodular $F(R)$\ngravity.\n", "  The short--wave asymptotics (WKB) of spiral density waves in self-gravitating\nstellar discs is well suited for the study of the dynamics of tightly--wound\nwavepackets. But the textbook WKB theory is not well adapted to the study of\nthe linear eigenmodes in a collisionless self-gravitating disc because of the\ntranscendental nature of the dispersion relation. We present a modified WKB of\nspiral density waves, for collisionless discs in the epicyclic limit, in which\nthe perturbed gravitational potential is related to the perturbed surface\ndensity by the Poisson integral in Kalnaj's logarithmic spiral form. An\nintegral equation is obtained for the surface density perturbation, which is\nseen to also reduce to the standard WKB dispersion relation. We specialize to a\nlow mass (or Keplerian) self-gravitating disc around a massive black hole, and\nderive an integral equation governing the eigenspectra and eigenfunctions of\nslow precessional modes. For a prograde disc, the integral kernel turns out be\nreal and symmetric, implying that all slow modes are stable. We apply the slow\nmode integral equation to two unperturbed disc profiles, the Jalali--Tremaine\nannular discs, and the Kuzmin disc. We determine eigenvalues and eigenfunctions\nfor both $m = 1$ and $m = 2$ slow modes for these profiles and discuss their\nproperties. Our results compare well with those of Jalali--Tremaine.\n", "  We construct a multi-band Hubbard model on the lattice obtained by\n\"decorating\" a closely packed $d$-dimensional lattice $\\mathcal{M}$ (such as\nthe triangular lattice) where $d\\ge2$. We take the limits in which the Coulomb\ninteraction and the band gap become infinitely large. Then there remains only a\nsingle band with finite energy, on which electrons are supported. Let the\nelectron number be $N_\\mathrm{e}=|\\mathcal{M}|-N_\\mathrm{h}$, where\n$|\\mathcal{M}|$ corresponds to the electron number which makes the lowest\n(finite energy) band half-filled, and $N_\\mathrm{h}$ is the number of \"holes\".\nIt is expected that the model exhibits metallic ferromagnetism if\n$N_\\mathrm{h}/|\\mathcal{M}|$ is nonvanishing but sufficiently small. We prove\nthat the ground states exhibit saturated ferromagnetism if\n$N_\\mathrm{h}\\le(\\text{const.})|\\mathcal{M}|^{2/(d+2)}$, and exhibit (not\nnecessarily saturated) ferromagnetism if\n$N_\\mathrm{h}\\le(\\mathrm{const.})|\\mathcal{M}|^{(d+1)/(d+2)}$. This may be\nregarded as a rigorous example of metallic ferromagnetism provided that the\nsystem size $|\\mathcal{M}|$ is not too large.\n", "  A unified diagrammatic treatment single and double electron photoemission\ncurrents is presented. The irreducible lesser density-density response function\nis the starting point of these derivations. Diagrams for higher order processes\nin which several electrons are observed in coincidence can likewise be\nobtained. For physically relevant situations in which the photoemission\ncross-section can be written as the Fermi Golden rule, the diagrams from the\nnonequilibrium Green's function approach can be put direct correspondence with\nthat of the scattering theory.\n", "  We present a minimal model that simultaneously accounts for neutrino masses\nand the origin of dark matter (DM) and where the electroweak phase transition\nis strong enough to allow for electroweak baryogenesis. The Standard Model is\nenlarged with a Majorana fermion, three generations of chiral fermion pairs,\nand a single complex scalar that plays a central role in DM production and\nphenomenology, neutrino masses, and the strength of the phase transition. All\nthe new fields are singlets under the SM gauge group. Neutrino masses are\ngenerated via a new variant of radiative inverse seesaw where the required\nsmall mass term is generated via loops involving DM and no large hierarchy is\nassumed among the mass scales. The model offers all the advantage of low-scale\nneutrino mass models as well as a viable dark matter candidate that is testable\nwith direct detection experiments.\n", "  We investigate the direct-current response of crystalline organic\nsemiconductors in the presence of finite external electric fields by the\nquantum-classical Ehrenfest dynamics complemented with instantaneous\ndecoherence corrections (IDC). The IDC is carried out in the real-space\nrepresentation with the energy-dependent reweighing factors to account for both\nintermolecular decoherence and energy relaxation by which conduction occurs. In\nthis way, both the diffusion and drift motion of charge carriers are described\nin a unified framework. Based on an off-diagonal electron-phonon coupling model\nfor pentacene, we find that the drift velocity initially increases with the\nelectric field and then decreases at higher fields due to the Wannier-Stark\nlocalization, and a negative electric-field dependence of mobility is observed.\nThe Einstein relation, which is a manifestation of the fluctuation-dissipation\ntheorem, is found to be restored in electric fields up to ~$10^5$ V/cm for a\nwide temperature region studied. Furthermore, we show that the incorporated\ndecoherence and energy relaxation could explain the large discrepancy between\nthe mobilities calculated by the Ehrenfest dynamics and the full quantum\nmethods, which proves the effectiveness of our approach to take back these\nmissing processes.\n", "  In this work, dispersion relations of $\\pi^0$ and $\\pi^{\\pm}$ have been\nstudied in vacuum in the limit of weak external magnetic field using a\nphenomenological pion-nucleon $(\\pi N)$ Lagrangian. For our purpose, we have\ncalculated the results up to one loop order in self energy diagrams with the\npseudoscalar $(PS)$ and pseudovector $(PV)$ pion-nucleon interactions. By\nassuming weak external magnetic field it is seen that the effective mass of\npion gets explicit magnetic field dependence and it is modified significantly\nfor the case of PS coupling. However, for the PV coupling, only a modest\nincrease in the effective mass is observed. These modified dispersion relations\ndue to the presence of the external field can have substantial influence in the\nphenomenological aspect of the mesons both in the context of neutron stars as\nwell as relativistic heavy ion collisions.\n", "  Recent advances in theoretical structure prediction methods and\nhigh-throughput computational techniques are revolutionizing experimental\ndiscovery of the thermodynamically stable inorganic materials. Metastable\nmaterials represent a new frontier for studies, since even simple binary non\nground state compounds of common elements may be awaiting discovery. However,\nthere are significant research challenges related to non-equilibrium thin film\nsynthesis and crystal structure predictions, such as small strained crystals in\nthe experimental samples and energy minimization based theoretical algorithms.\nHere we report on experimental synthesis and characterization, as well as\ntheoretical first-principles calculations of a previously unreported\nmixed-valent binary tin nitride. Thin film experiments indicate that this novel\nmaterial is N-deficient SnN with tin in the mixed II/IV valence state and a\nsmall low-symmetry unit cell. Theoretical calculations suggest that the most\nlikely crystal structure has the space group 2 (SG2) related to the distorted\ndelafossite (SG166), which is nearly 0.1 eV/atom above the ground state SnN\npolymorph. This observation is rationalized by the structural similarity of the\nSnN distorted delafossite to the chemically related Sn3N4 spinel compound,\nwhich provides a fresh scientific insight into the reasons for growth of\npolymorphs of the metastable material. In addition to reporting on the\ndiscovery of the simple binary SnN compound, this paper illustrates a possible\nway of combining a wide range of advanced characterization techniques with the\nfirst-principle property calculation methods, to elucidate the most likely\ncrystal structure of the previously unreported metastable materials.\n", "  We present an extension of the canonical coupled mode theory of\nelectromagnetic waves to the case of pulses and spatio-temporal perturbations\nin complex media. Unlike previous attempts to derive such a model, our approach\ninvolves no approximation, and does not impose any restriction on the\nspatio-temporal profile. Moreover, the effect of modal dispersion on mode\nevolution and on the coupling to other modes is fully taken into account. Thus,\nour approach can yield any required accuracy by retaining as many terms in the\nexpansion as needed. It also avoids various artifacts of previous derivations\nby introducing the correct form of the solution. We then provide what is, to\nthe best of our knowledge, the first ever validation of the coupled mode\nequations with exact numerical simulations, and demonstrate the wide range of\npossibilities enabled by spatio-temporal perturbations of pulses, including\npulse shortening or broadening or more complex shaping. Our formulation is\nvalid across the electromagnetic spectrum, and can be applied directly also to\nother wave systems.\n", "  The bowtie antenna is a topic of growing interest in recent years. In this\npaper, we design, fabricate, and characterize a modified gold bowtie antenna\nintegrated on a transparent silica substrate. The bowtie antenna is designed\nwith broad RF bandwidth to cover the X-band in the electromagnetic spectrum. We\nnumerically investigate the antenna characteristics, specifically its resonant\nfrequency and enhancement factor. Our designed bowtie antenna provides a strong\nbroadband electric field enhancement in its feed gap. Taking advantage of the\nlow-k silica substrate, high enhancement factor can be achieved without the\nunwanted reflection and scattering from the backside silicon handle which is\nthe issue of using an SOI substrate. We simulate the dependence of resonance\nfrequency on bowtie geometry, and verify the simulation results through\nexperimental investigation, by fabricating different sets of bowtie antennas on\nsilica substrates and then measuring their resonance frequencies. In addition,\nthe far-field radiation pattern of the bowtie antenna is measured, and it shows\ndipole-like characteristics with large beam width. Such a broadband antenna\nwill be useful for a myriad of applications, ranging from photonic\nelectromagnetic wave sensing to wireless communications.\n", "  A plasma has been observed inside the vacuum chamber of the PSI Ring\nCyclotron. This ionized gas cloud maybe a substantial contributor to several\ninterior components having reduced lifetimes. The plasma's generation has been\ndirectly linked to the voltage that is applied to the Flat Top Cavity through\nvisual confirmation using CCD cameras. A spectrometer was used to correlate the\nplasma's intensity and ignition to the Flat Top Cavity voltage as well as to\ndetermine the composition of the plasma. This paper reports on the analysis of\nthe plasma using spectroscopy. The spectrometer data was analyzed to determine\nthe composition of the plasma and that the plasma intensity (luminosity)\ndirectly corresponds to the Flat Top voltage. The results showed that the\nplasma was comprised of elements consistent with the cyclotrons vacuum interior\n", "  We present experimental work for improved atom loading in the optical\nmolasses of a caesium fountain clock, employing a low-velocity intense source\nof atoms (LVIS) [Lu et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 77, 3331 (1996)], which we\nmodified by adding a \"dark\" state pump laser. With this modification the atom\nsource has a mean flux of $4 \\times 10^{8}$ atoms/s at a mean atom velocity of\n$8.6$ m/s. Compared to fountain operation using background gas loading, we\nachieved a significant increase of the loaded and detected atom number by a\nfactor of 40. Operating the fountain clock with a total number of detected\natoms $N_{\\mathrm{at}}=2.9 \\times 10^6$ in the quantum projection noise-limited\nregime, a frequency instability $\\sigma_y\\left(1\\text{s}\\right)=2.7 \\times\n10^{-14}$ was demonstrated.\n", "  Few-mode fiber amplifier is widely under study to overcome the issue of\ninternet traffic in optical communication. This article proposes annulus core\nfew-mode erbium doped fiber (FM-EDF) with annulus or extra annulus doping for\namplification of the LP01, LP11, LP21, and LP31 signal mode groups with low\ndifferential modal gain (DMG). Our simulations confirm that extra annulus\ndoping helps in reducing DMG of higher order mode groups. We have achieved less\nthan 2.2 dB DMG over C-band for 4-mode groups using extra annulus doping. The\nproposed EDF would be useful for space division multiplexing (SDM) based\noptical fiber communication system.\n", "  We report results from the first search for $\\nu_\\mu\\to\\nu_e$ transitions by\nthe NOvA experiment. In an exposure equivalent to $2.74\\times10^{20}$\nprotons-on-target in the upgraded NuMI beam at Fermilab, we observe 6 events in\nthe Far Detector, compared to a background expectation of $0.99\\pm0.11$ (syst.)\nevents based on the Near Detector measurement. A secondary analysis observes 11\nevents with a background of $1.07\\pm0.14$ (syst.). The $3.3\\sigma$ excess of\nevents observed in the primary analysis disfavors $0.1\\pi < \\delta_{CP} <\n0.5\\pi$ in the inverted mass hierarchy at the 90% C.L.\n", "  A new system used for monitoring energetic Coulomb-scattered electrons as the\nmain diagnostic for accurately aligning the electron and ion beams in the new\nRelativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) electron lenses is described in detail.\nThe theory of electron scattering from relativistic ions is developed and\napplied to the design and implementation of the system used to achieve and\nmaintain the alignment. Commissioning with gold and 3He beams is then described\nas well as the successful utilization of the new system during the 2015 RHIC\npolarized proton run. Systematic errors of the new method are then estimated.\nFinally, some possible future applications of Coulomb-scattered electrons for\nbeam diagnostics are briefly discussed.\n", "  Rutile CrO$_2$ is an important half-metallic ferromagnetic material, which is\nalso widely used in magnetic recording. In an attempt to find the conditions,\nwhich lead to the increase the Curie temperature ($T_{\\rm C}$), we study\ntheoretically the band-filling dependence of interatomic exchange interactions\nin the rutile compounds. For these purposes, we use the effective low-energy\nmodel for the magnetic $t_{2g}$ bands, derived from the first-principles\nelectronic structure calculations in the Wannier basis, which is solved by\nmeans of dynamical mean-field theory. After the solution, we calculate the\ninteratomic exchange interactions, by using the theory of infinitesimal spin\nrotations, and evaluate $T_{\\rm C}$. We argue that, as far as the Curie\ntemperature is concerned, the band filling realized in CrO$_2$ is far from\nbeing the optimal one and much higher $T_{\\rm C}$ can be obtained by decreasing\nthe number of $t_{2g}$ electrons ($n$) via the hole doping. We find that the\noptimal $n$ is close to $1$, which should correspond to the case of VO$_2$,\nprovided that it is crystallized in the rutile structure. This finding was\nconfirmed by using the experimental rutile structure for both CrO$_2$ and\nVO$_2$ and reflects the general tendency towards ferromagnetism for the\nnarrow-band compounds at the beginning of the band filling. In particular, our\nresults suggest that the strong ferromagnetism can be achieved in the thin\nfilms of VO$_2$, whose crystal structure is controlled by the substrate.\n", "  Two-dimensional topological states of matter offer a route to quantum\ncomputation that would be topologically protected against the nemesis of the\nquantum circuit model: decoherence. Research groups in industry, government and\nacademic institutions are pursuing this approach. We give a mathematician's\nperspective on some of the advantages and challenges of this model,\nhighlighting some recent advances. We then give a short description of how we\nmight extend the theory to three-dimensional materials.\n", "  The mass splitting of elliptic anisotropy ($v_2$) at low transverse momentum\nis considered as a hallmark of hydrodynamic collective flow. We investigate a\nmultiphase transport (AMPT) model where the $v_2$ is mainly generated by an\nanisotropic escape mechanism, not of the hydrodynamic flow nature, and where\nmass splitting is also observed. We demonstrate that the $v_2$ mass splitting\nin AMPT is small right after hadronization (especially when resonance decays\nare included); the mass splitting mainly comes from hadronic rescatterings,\neven though their contribution to the overall charged hadron $v_2$ is small.\nThese findings are qualitatively the same as those from hybrid models that\ncombine hydrodynamics with a hadron cascade. We further show that there is no\nqualitative difference between heavy ion collisions and small system\ncollisions. Our results indicate that the $v_2$ mass splitting is not a unique\nsignature of hydrodynamic collective flow and thus cannot distinguish whether\nthe elliptic flow is generated mainly from hydrodynamics or the anisotropic\nparton escape.\n", "  We characterize the three-orbital Hubbard model using state-of-the-art\ndeterminant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) simulations with parameters relevant to\nthe cuprate high-temperature superconductors. The simulations find that doped\nholes preferentially reside on oxygen orbitals and that the ({\\pi},{\\pi})\nantiferromagnetic ordering vector dominates in the vicinity of the undoped\nsystem, as known from experiments. The orbitally-resolved spectral functions\nagree well with photoemission spectroscopy studies and enable identification of\norbital content in the bands. A comparison of DQMC results with exact\ndiagonalization and cluster perturbation theory studies elucidates how these\ndifferent numerical techniques complement one another to produce a more\ncomplete understanding of the model and the cuprates. Interestingly, our DQMC\nsimulations predict a charge-transfer gap that is significantly smaller than\nthe direct (optical) gap measured in experiment. Most likely, it corresponds to\nthe indirect gap that has recently been suggested to be on the order of 0.8 eV,\nand demonstrates the subtlety in identifying charge gaps.\n", "  Linear density response functions are calculated for symmetric nuclear matter\nof normal density by time-evolving two-time Green's functions in real time. Of\nparticular interest is the effect of correlations. The system is therefore\ninitially time-evolved with a collision term calculated in a direct Born\napproximation as well as with full (RPA) ring-summation until fully correlated.\nAn external time-dependent potential is then applied. The ensuing density\nfluctuations are recorded to calculate the density response. This method was\npreviously used by Kwong and Bonitz for studying plasma oscillations in a\ncorrelated electron gas. The energy-weighted sum-rule for the response function\nis guaranteed by using conserving self-energy insertions as the method then\ngenerates the full vertex-functions. These can alternatively be calculated by\nsolving a Bethe -Salpeter equation as done in some previous works. The (first\norder) mean field is derived from a momentum-dependent (non-local) interaction\nwhile $2^{nd}$ order self-energies are calculated using a particle-hole\ntwo-body effective (or 'residual') interaction given by a gaussian \\it local\n\\rm potential. We present numerical results for the response function\n$S(\\omega,q_0)$ for $q_0=0.2,0.4$ and $0.8 {\\rm fm}^{-1}$. Comparison is made\nwith the nucleons being un-correlated i.e. with only the first order mean field\nincluded, the 'HF+RPA' approximation. We briefly discuss the relation of our\nwork with the Landau quasi-particle theory as applied to nuclear systems by\nSj\\\"oberg and followers using methods developped by Babu and Brown, with\nspecial emphasis on the 'induced' interaction.\n", "  The transition temperature between the low-temperature alpha phase of tin to\nbeta tin is close to the room temperature (Tab =13C), and the difference in\ncohesive energy of the two phases at 0 K of about dEcoh=0.02 eV/atom is at the\nlimit of the accuracy of DFT (density functional theory) with available\nexchange-correlation functionals. It is however critically important to model\nthe relative phase energies correctly for any reasonable description of\nphenomena and technologies involving these phases, for example, the performance\nof tin electrodes in electrochemical batteries. Here, we show that several\ncommonly used and converged DFT setups using the most practical and widely used\nPBE functional result in dEcoh of about 0.04 eV/atom, with different types of\nbasis sets and with different models of core electrons (all-electron or\npseudopotentials of different types), which leads to a significant\noverestimation of Tab. We show that this is due to the errors in relative\npositions of s and p -like bands, which, combined with different populations of\nthese bands in alpha and beta Sn, leads to overstabilization of alpha tin. We\nshow that this error can be effectively corrected by applying a Hubbard +U\ncorrection to s -like states, whereby correct cohesive energies of both alpha\nand beta Sn can be obtained with the same computational scheme. We quantify for\nthe first time the effects of anharmonicity on dEcoh and find that it is\nnegligible.\n", "  We consider a generalised two brane Randall Sundrum model where the branes\nare endowed with non-zero cosmological constant. In this scenario, we\nre-examine the modulus stabilisation mechanism and the nature of Kaluza Klein\n(KK) graviton modes. Our result reveals that while the KK mode graviton masses\nmay change significantly with brane cosmological constant, the Goldberger-Wise\nstabilisation mechanism, which assumes negligible backreaction on the\nbackground metric, continues to hold even when the branes have large\ncosmological constant. The possibility of having a global minimum for the\nmodulus is also discussed.\n", "  For black-hole binaries whose spins are (anti-) aligned with respect to the\norbital angular momentum of the binary, we compute the frequency domain phasing\ncoefficients including the quadratic-in-spin terms up to the third\npost-Newtonian (3PN) order, the cubic-in-spin terms at the leading order,\n3.5PN, and the spin-orbit effects up to the 4PN order. In addition, we obtain\nthe 2PN spin contributions to the amplitude of the frequency-domain\ngravitational waveforms for non-precessing binaries, using recently derived\nexpressions for the time-domain polarization amplitudes of binaries with\ngeneric spins, complete at that accuracy level. These two results are updates\nto Arun et al. (2009) [1] for amplitude and Wade et al. (2013) [2] for phasing.\nThey should be useful to construct banks of templates that model accurately\nnon-precessing inspiraling binaries, for parameter estimation studies, and or\nconstructing analytical template families that accounts for the\ninspiral-merger-ringdown phases of the binary.\n", "  We consider Spin(4)-equivariant dimensional reduction of Yang-Mills theory on\nmanifolds of the form $M^d \\times T^{1,1}$, where $M^d$ is a smooth manifold\nand $T^{1,1}$ is a five-dimensional Sasaki-Einstein manifold Spin(4)/U(1). We\nobtain new quiver gauge theories on $M^d$ extending those induced via reduction\nover the leaf spaces $\\mathbb{C}P^1 \\times \\mathbb{C}P^1$ in $T^{1,1}$. We\ndescribe the Higgs branches of these quiver gauge theories as moduli spaces of\nSpin(4)-equivariant instantons on the conifold which is realized as the metric\ncone over $T^{1,1}$. We give an explicit construction of these moduli spaces as\nK\\\"ahler quotients.\n", "  Interference is central to quantum physics and occurs when indistinguishable\npaths exist, like in a double-slit experiment. Replacing the two slits with two\nsingle atoms introduces optical non-linearities for which nontrivial\ninterference phenomena are predicted. Their observation, however, has been\nhampered by difficulties in preparing the required atomic distribution,\ncontrolling the optical phases and detecting the faint light. Here we overcome\nall of these experimental challenges by combining an optical lattice for atom\nlocalisation, an imaging system with single-site resolution, and an optical\nresonator for light steering. We observe resonator-induced saturation of\nresonance fluorescence for constructive interference of the scattered light and\nnonzero emission with huge photon bunching for destructive interference. The\nlatter is explained by atomic saturation and photon pair generation. Our\nexperimental setting is scalable and allows one to realize the Tavis-Cummings\nmodel for any number of atoms and photons, explore fundamental aspects of\nlight-matter interaction, and implement new quantum information processing\nprotocols.\n", "  We study the electric and thermal transport of the Dirac carriers in\nmonolayer graphene using the Boltzmann-equation approach. Motivated by recent\nthermopower measurements [F. Ghahari, H.-Y.~Xie, T. Taniguchi, K. Watanabe,\nM.~S.~Foster, and P.~Kim, Phys.\\ Rev.\\ Lett.\\ {\\bf 116}, 136802 (2016)], we\nconsider the effects of quenched disorder, Coulomb interactions, and\nelectron--optical-phonon scattering. Via an unbiased numerical solution to the\nBoltzmann equation we calculate the electrical conductivity, thermopower, and\nelectronic component of the thermal conductivity, and discuss the validity of\nMott's formula and of the Wiedemann-Franz law. An analytical solution for the\ndisorder-only case shows that screened Coulomb impurity scattering, although\nelastic, violates the Wiedemann-Franz law even at low temperature. For the\ncombination of carrier-carrier Coulomb and short-ranged impurity scattering, we\nobserve the crossover from the interaction-limited (hydrodynamic) regime to the\ndisorder-limited (Fermi-liquid) regime. In the former, the thermopower and the\nthermal conductivity follow the results anticipated by the relativistic\nhydrodynamic theory. On the other hand, we find that optical phonons become\nnonnegligible at relatively low temperatures and that the induced electron\nthermopower violates Mott's formula. Combining all of these scattering\nmechanisms, we obtain the thermopower that quantitatively coincides with the\nexperimental data.\n", "  Motivated by recent discovery of canted ferromagnetism in Tsai-type\napproximants Au-Si-RE (RE = Tb, Dy, Ho), we propose a phenomenological magnetic\nmodel reproducing their magnetic structure and thermodynamic quantities. In the\nmodel, cubic symmetry ($m\\bar{3}$) of the approximately-regular icosahedra\nplays a key role in the peculiar magnetic structure determined by a neutron\ndiffraction experiment. Our magnetic model does not only explain magnetic\nbehaviors in the quasicrystal approximants, but also provides a good starting\npoint for the possibility of coexistence between magnetic long-range order and\naperiodicity in quasicrystals.\n", "  We report an atomic-scale characterization of ZrTe$_5$ by using scanning\ntunneling microscopy. We observe a bulk bandgap of ~80 meV with topological\nedge states at the step edge, and thus demonstrate ZrTe$_5$ is a two\ndimensional topological insulator. It is also found that an applied magnetic\nfield induces energetic splitting and spatial separation of the topological\nedge states, which can be attributed to a strong link between the topological\nedge states and bulk topology. The perfect surface steps and relatively large\nbandgap make ZrTe$_5$ be a potential candidate for future fundamental studies\nand device applications.\n", "  We study the atypically large deviations of the height $H \\sim {{\\cal O}}(t)$\nat the origin at late times in $1+1$-dimensional growth models belonging to the\nKardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. We present exact results for the\nrate functions for the discrete single step growth model, as well as for the\ncontinuum KPZ equation in a droplet geometry. Based on our exact calculation of\nthe rate functions we argue that models in the KPZ class undergo a third order\nphase transition from a strong coupling to a weak coupling phase, at late\ntimes.\n", "  We solve for finite $N$ the matrix model of supersymmetric $U(N)$\nChern-Simons theory coupled to $N_{f}$ fundamental and $N_{f}$ anti-fundamental\nchiral multiplets of $R$-charge $1/2$ and of mass $m$, by identifying it with\nan average of inverse characteristic polynomials in a Stieltjes-Wigert\nensemble. This requires the computation of the Cauchy transform of the\nStieltjes-Wigert polynomials, which we carry out, finding a relationship with\nMordell integrals, and hence with previous analytical results on the matrix\nmodel. The semiclassical limit of the model is expressed, for arbitrary\n$N_{f},$ in terms of a single Hermite polynomial. This result also holds for\nmore general matter content, involving matrix models with double-sine\nfunctions.\n", "  We study the transfer of electromagnetic energy across a subwavelength gap\nseparating two co-axial metal nanorodes. The absence of spacer in the gap\nseparating the rods the system exhibits the strong coupling between\nlongitudinal plasmons in the two rods. The nature and magnitude of this\ncoupling is studied by varying various geometrical parameters. When the length\nof one rod is varied this mode spectrum exhibits the familiar anti-crossing\nbehavior that depends on the coupling strength determined by the gap width. As\na function of frequency the transmission is dominated by a splitted\nlongitudinal plasmon peak. The two hybrid modes are the dipole-like \"bonding\"\nmode characterized by a peak intensity in the gap, and a quadrupole-like\n\"antibonding\" mode whose amplitude vanishes at the gap center. When\noff-resonant $2-$level emitters are placed in the gap, almost no effect on the\nfrequency dependent transmission is observed. In contrast, when the molecular\nsystem is resonant with the plasmonic lineshape, the transmission is strongly\nmodified, showing characteristics of strong exciton-plasmon coupling, modifying\nmostly the transmission near the lower frequency \"bonding\" plasmon mode. The\npresence of resonant molecules in the gap affects not only the molecule-field\ninteraction but also the spatial distribution of the field intensity and the\nelectromagnetic energy flux across the junction.\n", "  We consider the possibility that the recently observed excess in the diphoton\ninvariant mass spectrum around 750 GeV is due to two narrow scalars. We\ndemonstrate that there is no need to introduce invisible decay modes to enlarge\nthe widths as long as the two scalars exhibit an appropriate mass splitting.\nNevertheless we investigate the possible connection of these two scalars to the\ndark matter in a toy model with a Majorana fermionic dark matter candidate. We\nexplore how large the widths of the two scalar widths could be taking into\naccount various constraints from collider and dark matter experiments.\nIntroducing two scalars alleviates the tension between the diphoton production\nand dark matter constraints.\n", "  The recently introduced auxiliary Hamiltonian approach [Balzer K and Eckstein\nM 2014 Phys. Rev. B 89 035148] maps the problem of solving the two-time\nKadanoff-Baym equations onto a noninteracting auxiliary system with additional\nbath degrees of freedom. While the original paper restricts the discussion to\nspatially local self-energies, we show that there exists a rather\nstraightforward generalization to treat also non-local correlation effects. The\nonly drawback is the loss of time causality due to a combined singular value\nand eigen decomposition of the two-time self-energy, the application of which\ninhibits one to establish the self-consistency directly on the time step. For\nderivation and illustration of the method, we consider the Hubbard model in one\ndimension and study the decay of the Neel state in the weak-coupling regime,\nusing the local and non-local second-order Born approximation.\n", "  A search for a massive resonance W' decaying into a W and a Higgs boson in\nthe l nu b anti-b (l = e, mu) final state is presented. Results are based on\ndata corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 inverse femtobarns of\nproton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV, collected using the CMS detector\nat the LHC. For a high-mass ( greater than 1 TeV) resonance, the two bottom\nquarks coming from the Higgs boson decay are reconstructed as a single jet,\nwhich can be tagged by placing requirements on its substructure and flavour.\nExclusion limits at 95% confidence level are set on the production cross\nsection of a narrow resonance decaying into WH, as a function of its mass. In\nthe context of a little Higgs model, a lower limit on the W' mass of 1.4 TeV is\nset. In a heavy vector triplet model that mimics the properties of composite\nHiggs models, a lower limit on the W' mass of 1.5 TeV is set. In the context of\nthis model, the results are combined with related searches to obtain a lower\nlimit on the W' mass of 1.8 TeV, the most restrictive to date for decays to a\npair of standard model bosons.\n", "  We propose a physical model based on disordered (a hole punched inside a\nmaterial) monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) to demonstrate a\nlarge-gap quantum valley Hall insulator. We find an emergence of bound states\nlying inside the bulk gap of the TMDs. They are strongly affected by\nspin-valley coupling, rest- and kinetic- mass terms and the hole size. In\naddition, in the whole range of the hole size, at least two in-gap bound states\nwith opposite angular momentum, circulating around the edge of the hole, exist.\nTheir topological insulator (TI) feature is analyzed by the Chern number,\ncharacterized by spacial distribution of their probabilities and confirmed by\nenergy dispersion curves (Energy vs. angular momentum). It not only sheds light\non overcoming low-temperature operating limitation of existing narrow-gap TIs,\nbut also opens an opportunity to realize valley- and spin- qubits.\n", "  (Abridged) The color and luminosity distribution of horizontal branch (HB)\nstars in globular clusters are sensitive probes of their original helium\nabundances. However, recent analyses based on visual and near-ultraviolet (UV)\nCMDs have provided conflicting results. To clarify the situation, we address\nthe optimum ranges of applicability (in terms of the $T_{eff}$ range covered by\nthe HB stars) for visual and near-UV CMDs, as far as application of this HB $Y$\ntest goes. We consider both Stromgren and Hubble Space Telescope (HST)\nbandpasses. Our results indicate that the distributions of HB stars in the y vs\n(b-y) plane can be a reliable indicator of the He content in cool blue HB (BHB)\nstars, particularly when a differential comparison between blue and red HB\nstars is carried out in the range $T_{eff}<8300$K. Conversely, we demonstrate\nthat CMDs using the F336W filter have a much less straightforward\ninterpretation at the cool end of the BHB, as the distributions of HB stars in\nthe F336W vs (F336W-F555W) plane are affected by a triple degeneracy effect. In\nother words, the position of an HB star is exactly the same, for a given\nchemical composition, for multiple combinations of the parameters $Y$,\n$M_{HB}$, and age along the HB evolutionary track. Other HST UV filters do not\nappear to be as severely affected by this degeneracy effect, to which visual\nbandpasses are also immune. We do find, on the other hand, that such near-UV\nCMDs can be extremely useful for the hottest stars along the cool BHB end.\nBased on a reanalysis of the distribution of HB stars in the y vs (b-y) plane,\nwe find that the coolest among the BHB stars in M3 are likely enhanced in\nhelium by $\\Delta Y\\approx 0.01$, compared with the red HB stars in the same\ncluster. Using near-UV HST photometry we find evidence of a progressive\nincrease in $Y$ with increasing temperature, reaching $\\Delta Y=0.02$ at\n$T_{eff}=10900$K.\n", "  We calculate the dynamic polarizability under the random phase approximation\nfor the dice lattice. This two-dimensional system gives rise to massless Dirac\nfermions with pseudospin-1 in the low-energy quantum excitation spectrum,\nproviding a Dirac-cone plus flat-band dispersion. Due to the presence of the\nflat band, the polarizability shows key differences to that of graphene (the\npseudospin-1/2 Dirac material). We find that the plasmon branch is pinched in\nto a single point, $\\omega_p=q=\\mu$, independent of the background dielectric\nconstant. Finally, screening effects are discussed with regard to impurities.\n", "  The SYK model consists of $N\\gg 1$ fermions in $0+1$ dimensions with a\nrandom, all-to-all quartic interaction. Recently, Kitaev has found that the SYK\nmodel is maximally chaotic and has proposed it as a model of holography. We\nsolve the Schwinger-Dyson equation and compute the spectrum of two-particle\nstates in SYK, finding both a continuous and discrete tower. The four-point\nfunction is expressed as a sum over the spectrum. The sum over the discrete\ntower is evaluated.\n", "  We consider certain line defect operators in five-dimensional SUSY gauge\ntheories, whose interaction with the self-dual instantons is described by 1d\nADHM-like gauged quantum mechanics constructed by Tong and Wong. The partition\nfunction in the presence of these operators is known to be a generating\nfunction of BPS Wilson loops in skew symmetric tensor representations of the\ngauge group. We calculate the partition function and explicitly prove that it\nis a finite polynomial of the defect mass parameter $x$, which is an essential\nproperty of the defect operator and the Wilson loop generating function. The\nrelation between the line defect partition function and the qq-character\ndefined by N. Nekrasov is briefly discussed.\n", "  We calculate cross sections for diphoton production in (semi)exclusive $PbPb$\ncollisions, relevant for the LHC. The calculation is based on equivalent photon\napproximation in the impact parameter space. The cross sections for elementary\n$\\gamma \\gamma \\to \\gamma \\gamma$ subprocess are calculated including two\ndifferent mechanisms. We take into account box diagrams with leptons and quarks\nin the loops. In addition, we consider a vector-meson dominance (VDM-Regge)\ncontribution with virtual intermediate hadronic (vector-like) excitations of\nthe photons. We get much higher cross sections in $PbPb$ collisions than in\nearlier calculation from the literature. This opens a possibility to study the\n$\\gamma \\gamma \\to \\gamma \\gamma$ (quasi)elastic scattering at the LHC. We\npresent many interesting differential distributions which could be measured by\nthe ALICE, CMS or ATLAS Collaborations at the LHC. We study whether a\nseparation or identification of different components (boxes, VDM-Regge) is\npossible. We find that the cross section for elastic $\\gamma \\gamma$ scattering\ncould be measured in the heavy-ion collisions for subprocess energies smaller\nthan $W_{\\gamma\\gamma} \\approx 15-20$ GeV.\n", "  We investigate superconducting order in the extended Hubbard model on the\ntwo-dimensional graphene lattice using the variational cluster approximation\n(VCA) with an exact diagonalization solver at zero temperature. Building on the\nresults of Ref.$[1]$, which identified triplet $p$- and $p+ip$-wave\nsuperconductivity as the most favored pairing symmetries in that model, we\nplace uniform SC solutions in competition with the proposed nonuniform Kekul\\'e\n($p+ip$-K) superconducting pattern proposed in Ref.$[2]$. We find that the\n$p+ip$-K solution is in fact the most favored pairing in most of the phase\ndiagram. In addition, we show that antiferromagnetism can co-exist with the\n$p+ip$-K state and that both orders are enhanced by their coexistence.\n", "  Standard solar models (SSMs) provide a reference framework across a number of\nresearch fields: solar and stellar models, solar neutrinos, particle physics\nthe most conspicuous among them. The accuracy of the physical description of\nthe global properties of the Sun that SSMs provide has been challenged in the\nlast decade by a number of developments in stellar spectroscopic techniques.\nOver the same period of time, solar neutrino experiments, and Borexino in\nparticular, have measured the four solar neutrino fluxes from the pp-chains\nthat are associated with 99\\% of the nuclear energy generated in the Sun.\nBorexino has also set the most stringent limit on CNO energy generation, only\n$\\sim 40\\%$ larger than predicted by SSMs. More recently, and for the first\ntime, radiative opacity experiments have been performed at conditions that\nclosely resemble those at the base of the solar convective envelope. In this\narticle, we review these developments and discuss the current status of SSMs,\nincluding its intrinsic limitations.\n", "  We study beam-transverse and normal single-spin asymmetry for electron-proton\ninelastic scattering in the resonance region for the case where a pion is\nobserved in the final state. There is no beam single-spin asymmetry if the\nobserved particle has single-photon exchange as its only interaction, but this\nis naturally circumvented when one observes a strongly interacting final state\nparticle. The asymmetries are not large as there is an electron mass divided by\nmomentum transfer suppression. We present results for the cases where the final\nelectron and a pion are both observed, with asymmetries of order tens of ppm,\nand where only a final pion is observed, with asymmetries of order one ppm.\n", "  Soft x-ray linear and circular dichroism (XLD, XMCD) experiments at the Ce\nM$_{4,5}$ edges are being used to determine the energy scales characterizing\nthe Ce $4f$ degrees of freedom in the ultrathin ordered surface intermetallic\nCeAg$_x$/Ag(111). We find that all relevant interactions, i. e. Kondo\nscattering, crystal field splitting and magnetic exchange coupling occur on\nsmall scales. Our study demonstrates the usefulness of combining x-ray\nabsorption experiments probing linear and circular dichroism owing to their\nstrong sensitivity for anisotropies in both charge distribution and\nparamagnetic response, respectively.\n", "  We perform first classical-statistical real time lattice simulations of\ntopological transitions in the non-equilibrium Glasma of weakly coupled but\nhighly occupied gauge fields created immediately after the collision of\nultra-relativistic nuclei. Simplifying our description by employing SU(2) gauge\nfields, and neglecting their longitudinal expansion, we find that the rate of\ntopological transitions is initially strongly enhanced relative to the thermal\nsphaleron transition rate and decays with time during the thermalization\nprocess. Qualitative features of the time dependence of this non-equilibrium\ntransition rate can be understood when expressed in terms of the magnetic\nscreening length, which we also extract non-perturbatively. A detailed\ninvestigation of auto-correlation functions of the Chern-Simons number\n($N_{CS}$) reveals non-Markovian features of the evolution distinct from\nprevious simulations of non-Abelian plasmas in thermal equilibrium.\n", "  Sgr A* is an ideal target to study low-luminosity accreting systems. It has\nbeen recently proposed that properties of the accretion flow around Sgr A* can\nbe probed through its interactions with the stellar wind of nearby massive\nstars belonging to the S-cluster. When a star intercepts the accretion disk,\nthe ram and thermal pressures of the disk terminate the stellar wind leading to\nthe formation of a bow shock structure. Here, a semi-analytical model is\nconstructed which describes the geometry of the termination shock formed in the\nwind. With the employment of numerical hydrodynamic simulations, this model is\nboth verified and extended to a region prone to Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities.\nBecause the characteristic wind and stellar velocities are in $\\sim10^{8}$ cm\ns$^{-1}$ range, the shocked wind may produce detectable X-rays via thermal\nbremsstrahlung emission. The application of this model to the pericenter\npassage of S2, the brightest member of the S-cluster, shows that the shocked\nwind produces roughly a month long X-ray flare with a peak luminosity of\n$L\\approx 4 \\times 10^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$ for a stellar mass-loss rate, disk\nnumber density, and thermal pressure strength of $\\dot{M}_{\\rm w}= 10^{-7}\nM_\\odot\\, {\\rm yr}^{-1}$, $n_{\\rm d} = 10^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$, and $\\alpha=0.1$,\nrespectively. This peak luminosity is comparable to the quiescent X-ray\nemission detected from Sgr A* and is within the detection capabilities of\ncurrent X-ray observatories. Its detection could constrain the density and\nthickness of the disk at a distance of $\\sim 3000$ gravitational radii from the\nsupermassive black hole.\n", "  We have identified the H-alpha absorption feature as a new spectroscopic\ndiagnostic of luminosity class in K- and M-type stars. From high-resolution\nspectra of 19 stars with well-determined physical properties (including\neffective temperatures and stellar radii), we measured equivalent widths for\nH-alpha and the Ca II triplet and examined their dependence on both luminosity\nclass and stellar radius. H-alpha shows a strong relation with both luminosity\nclass and radius that extends down to late M spectral types. This behavior in\nH-alpha has been predicted as a result of the density-dependent overpopulation\nof the metastable 2S level in hydrogen, an effect that should become dominant\nfor Balmer line formation in non-LTE conditions. We conclude that this new\nmetallicity-insensitive diagnostic of luminosity class in cool stars could\nserve as an effective means of discerning between populations such as Milky Way\ngiants and supergiant members of background galaxies.\n", "  Light modulation is an essential operation in photonics and optoelectronics.\nWith existing and emerging technologies increasingly demanding compact,\nefficient, fast and broadband optical modulators, high-performance light\nmodulation solutions are becoming indispensable. The recent realization that\ntwo-dimensional layered materials could modulate light with superior\nperformance has prompted intense research and significant advances, paving the\nway for realistic applications. In this review, we cover the state-of-the-art\nof optical modulators based on two-dimensional layered materials including\ngraphene, transition metal dichalcogenides and black phosphorus. We discuss\nrecent advances employing hybrid structures, such as two-dimensional\nheterostructures, plasmonic structures, and silicon/fibre integrated\nstructures. We also take a look at future perspectives and discuss the\npotential of yet relatively unexplored mechanisms such as magneto-optic and\nacousto-optic modulation.\n", "  We present freshly evaluated B$(E2\\uparrow;0^+\\rightarrow2^+)$ values across\nthe even-even Sn-isotopes which confirm the presence of an asymmetric behavior\nas well as a dip in the middle of the full valence space. We explain these\nfeatures by using the concept of generalized seniority. The dip in the B$(E2)$\nvalues near $^{116}$Sn is understood in terms of a change in the dominant\norbits before and after the mid shell, which also explains the presence of\nasymmetric peaks in the B$(E2)$ values. This approach helps in deciding the\nmost active valence spaces for a given set of isotopes, and single out the most\nuseful truncation scheme for Large Scale Shell Model (LSSM) calculations. The\nLSSM calculations so guided by generalized seniority are also able to reproduce\nthe experimental data on B$(E2)\\uparrow$ values quite well.\n", "  In this note we revisit the SUSY effects in $R_b$ under current experimental\nconstraints including the LHC Higgs data, the $B$-physics measurements, the\ndark matter relic density and direct detection limits, as well as the precision\nelectroweak data. We first perform a scan to figure out the currently allowed\nparameter space and then display the SUSY effects in $R_b$. We find that\nalthough the SUSY parameter space has been severely restrained by current\nexperimental data, both the general MSSM and the natural-SUSY scenario can\nstill alter $R_b$ with a magnitude sizable enough to be observed at future\n$Z$-factories (ILC, CEPC, FCC-ee, Super $Z$-factory) which produce\n$10^9-10^{12}$ $Z$-bosons. To be specific, assuming a precise measurement\n$\\delta R_b = 2.0 \\times 10^{-5}$ at FCC-ee, we can probe a right-handed stop\nup to 530 GeV through chargino-stop loops, probe a sbottom to 850 GeV through\nneutralino-sbottom loops and a charged Higgs to 770 GeV through the Higgs-top\nquark loops for a large $\\text{tan}\\beta$. The full one-loop SUSY correction to\n$R_b$ can reach $1 \\times 10^{-4}$ in natural SUSY and $2 \\times 10^{-4}$ in\nthe general MSSM.\n", "  Aims. We present and study the spectroscopic and photometric evolution of the\ntype Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2010ev. Methods. We obtain and analyze multi-band\noptical light curves and optical-near-infrared spectroscopy at low and medium\nresolution spanning from -7 days to +300 days from the B-band maximum. Results.\nA photometric analysis shows that SN 2010ev is a SN Ia of normal brightness\nwith a light curve shape of $\\Delta m_{15}(B)=1.12 \\pm 0.02$ and a stretch s =\n$0.94 \\pm 0.01$ suffering significant reddening. From photometric and\nspectroscopic analysis, we deduce a color excess of $E(B - V) = 0.25 \\pm 0.05$\nand a reddening law of $R_v = 1.54 \\pm 0.65$. Spectroscopically, SN 2010ev\nbelongs to the broad-line SN Ia group, showing stronger than average Si II\n{\\lambda}6355 absorption features. We also find that SN 2010ev is a\nhigh-velocity gradient SN, with a value of $164 \\pm 7$ km s$^{-1}$ d$^{-1}$.\nThe photometric and spectral comparison with other supernovae shows that SN\n2010ev has similar colors and velocities to SN 2002bo and SN 2002dj. The\nanalysis of the nebular spectra indicates that the [Fe II] {\\lambda}7155 and\n[Ni II] {\\lambda}7378 lines are redshifted, as expected for a high velocity\ngradient supernova. All these common intrinsic and extrinsic properties of the\nhigh velocity gradient (HVG) group are different from the low velocity gradient\n(LVG) normal SN Ia population and suggest significant variety in SN Ia\nexplosions.\n", "  Strong-field phenomena driven by an intense infrared (IR) laser depend on\nduring what part of the field cycle they are initiated. By changing the\nsub-cycle character of the laser electric field it is possible to control such\nphenomena. For long pulses, sub-cycle shaping of the field can be done by\nadding a relatively weak, second harmonic of the driving field to the pulse.\nThrough constructive and destructive interference, the combination of strong\nand weak fields can be used to change the probability of a strong-field process\nbeing initiated at any given part of the cycle. In order to control sub-cycle\nphenomena with optimal accuracy, it is necessary to know the phase difference\nof the strong and the weak fields precisely. If the weaker field is an even\nharmonic of the driving field, electrons ionized by the field will be\nasymmetrically distributed between the positive and negative directions of the\ncombined fields. Information about the asymmetry can yield information about\nthe phase difference. A technique to measure asymmetry for few-cycle pulses,\ncalled Stereo-ATI (Above Threshold Ionization), has been developed by [Paulus G\nG, et al 2003 Phys. Rev. Lett. 91]. This paper outlines an extension of this\nmethod to measure the phase difference between a strong IR and its second\nharmonic.\n", "  The $R_h = ct$ cosmological model has received considerable attention in\nrecent years owing to claims that it is favoured over the standard $\\Lambda$\ncold dark matter ($\\Lambda$CDM) model by most observational data. A key feature\nof the $R_h = ct$ model is that the zero active mass condition $\\rho + 3p = 0$\nholds at all epochs. Most recently, Melia has claimed that this condition is a\nrequirement of the symmetries of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW)\nspacetime. We demonstrate that this claim is false and results from a flaw in\nthe logic of Melia's argument.\n", "  We consider the energy difference restricted to a finite volume for certain\npairs of incongruent ground states (if they exist) in the d-dimensional\nEdwards-Anderson (EA) Ising spin glass at zero temperature. We prove that the\nvariance of this quantity with respect to the couplings grows at least\nproportionally to the volume in any dimension greater than or equal to two. An\nessential aspect of our result is the use of the excitation metastate. As an\nillustration of potential applications, we use this result to restrict the\npossible structure of spin glass ground states in two dimensions.\n", "  We analyze the distribution that extremizes a linear combination of the\nBoltzmann--Gibbs entropy and the nonadditive $q$-entropy. We show that this\ndistribution can be expressed in terms of a Lambert function. Both the entropic\nfunctional and the extremizing distribution can be associated with a nonlinear\nFokker--Planck equation obtained from a master equation with nonlinear\ntransition rates. Also, we evaluate the entropy extremized by a linear\ncombination of a Gaussian distribution (which extremizes the Boltzmann--Gibbs\nentropy) and a $q$-Gaussian distribution (which extremizes the $q$-entropy). We\ngive its explicit expression for $q=0$, and discuss the other cases\nnumerically. The entropy that we obtain can be expressed, for $q=0$, in terms\nof Lambert functions, and exhibits a discontinuity in the second derivative for\nall values of $q<1$. The entire discussion is closely related to recent results\nfor type-II superconductors and for the statistics of the standard map.\n", "  We introduce a new simple design of hollow-core microstructured fiber\ntargeted to guide mid-infrared light at a wavelength 2.94 $ \\mu $m. The fiber\nhas a triangular-core supported via silica-glass webs enclosed by a large\nhollow capillary tube. The fiber specific dimensions are determined based on\nthe guiding technique, which is based on the anti-resonant mechanism. For a\ntriangular-core with side length $100$ $ \\mu $m, the fiber has a minimum\ntransmission loss $0.08\\pm0.005$ dB/m and dispersion 2.3 ps/km/nm at the\noperational wavelength 2.94 $ \\mu $m.\n", "  We argue that the secondaries produced in high energy hadron collisions are\nemitted by small size sources distributed over a much larger area in impact\nparameter space occupied by the interaction amplitude. That is, Bose-Einstein\ncorrelation of two emitted identical particles should be described by a\n`two-radii' parametrization ansatz. We discuss the expected energy, charged\nmultiplicity and transverse momentum of the pair (that is, $\\sqrt{s},~N_{\\rm\nch}, k_t$) behaviour of both the small and large size components.\n", "  I report on the development of a novel statistical mechanical formalism for\nthe analysis of random graphs with many short loops, and processes on such\ngraphs. The graphs are defined via maximum entropy ensembles, in which both the\ndegrees (via hard constraints) and the adjacency matrix spectrum (via a soft\nconstraint) are prescribed. The sum over graphs can be done analytically, using\na replica formalism with complex replica dimensions. All known results for\ntree-like graphs are recovered in a suitable limit. For loopy graphs, the\nemerging theory has an appealing and intuitive structure, suggests how message\npassing algorithms should be adapted, and what is the structure of theories\ndescribing spin systems on loopy architectures. However, the formalism is still\nlargely untested, and may require further adjustment and refinement.\n", "  Two dimensional (2D) materials with a finite band gap and high carrier\nmobility are sought after materials from both fundamental and technological\nperspectives. In this paper, we present the results based on the particle swarm\noptimization method and density functional theory which predict three\ngeometrically different phases of carbon phosphide (CP) monolayer consisted of\nsp2 hybridized C atoms and sp3 hybridized P atoms in hexagonal networks. Two of\nthe phases, referred to as {\\alpha}-CP and \\b{eta}-CP with puckered and buckled\nsurfaces, respectively are semiconducting with highly anisotropic electronic\nand mechanical properties. More remarkably, they have lightest electrons and\nholes among the known 2D semiconductors, yielding superior carrier mobility.\nThe {\\gamma}-CP has a distorted hexagonal network and exhibits a semi-metallic\nbehavior with Dirac cones. These theoretical findings suggest the binary CP\nmonolayer to be yet unexplored 2D materials holding great promises for\napplications in high-performance electronics and optoelectronics.\n", "  Recent observations have highlighted a significant population of faint but\nlarge (r_eff>1.5 kpc) galaxies in the Coma cluster. The origin of these Ultra\nDiffuse Galaxies (UDGs) remains puzzling, as the interpretation of the\nobservational results has been hindered by the subjective selection of UDGs,\nand the limited study of only the Coma (and some examples in the Virgo-)\ncluster. We extend the study of UDGs using 8 clusters in the redshift range\n0.044<z<0.063 with deep g- and r-band imaging data taken with MegaCam at the\nCFHT. We describe an automatic selection pipeline for quantitative\nidentification, tested for completeness using image simulations of these\ngalaxies. We find that the abundance of the UDGs we can detect increases with\ncluster mass, reaching ~200 in typical haloes of M200~10^15 Msun. The cluster\nUDGs have colours consistent with the cluster red sequence, and have a steep\nsize distribution that declines as n~r_eff^-3.4. Their radial distribution is\nsignificantly steeper than NFW in the outskirts, and is significantly shallower\nin the inner parts. They follow the same radial distribution as the more\nmassive quiescent galaxies in the clusters, except within the core region of\nr<0.15XR200 (or <300 kpc). Within this region the number density of UDGs drops\nand is consistent with zero. These diffuse galaxies can only resist tidal\nforces down to this cluster-centric distance if they are highly centrally\ndark-matter dominated. The observation that the radial distribution of more\ncompact dwarf galaxies (r_eff<1.0 kpc) with similar luminosities follows the\nsame distribution as the UDGs, but exist down to a smaller distance of 100kpc\nfrom the cluster centres, indicates that they may have similarly massive\nsub-haloes as the UDGs. Although several scenarios can give rise to the UDG\npopulation, our results point to differences in the formation history as the\nmost plausible explanation.\n", "  We present a finite-temperature diagrammatic perturbation theory of third\nharmonic generation (THG) in doped graphene. We carry out calculations of the\nthird-order conductivity in the scalar potential gauge, highlighting a subtle\ncancellation between a Fermi surface contribution, which contains only power\nlaws, and power-law contributions of inter-band nature. Only logarithms survive\nin the final result. We conclude by presenting quantitative results for the\nup-conversion efficiency at zero and finite temperature. Our results shed light\non the on-going dispute over the dependence of THG on carrier concentration in\ngraphene.\n", "  The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) is a multi-purpose\nneutrino experiment designed to measure the neutrino mass hierarchy using a\ncentral detector (CD), which contains 20 kton liquid scintillator (LS)\nsurrounded by about 17,000 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). Due to the large\nfiducial volume and huge number of PMTs, the simulation of a muon particle\npassing through the CD with the Geant4 toolkit becomes an extremely\ncomputation-intensive task. This paper presents a fast simulation\nimplementation using a so-called voxel method: for scintillation photons\ngenerated in a certain LS voxel, the PMT's response is produced beforehand with\nGeant4 and then introduced into the simulation at runtime. This\nparameterisation method successfully speeds up the most CPU consuming process,\nthe optical photon's propagation in the LS, by a factor of 50. In the paper,\nthe comparison of physics performance between fast and full simulation is also\ngiven.\n", "  We consider the standard repulsive Hubbard model with a flat lowest-energy\nband for two one-dimensional lattices (diamond chain and ladder) as well as for\na two-dimensional lattice (bilayer) at half filling of the flat band. The\nconsidered models do not fall in the class of Mielke-Tasaki flat-band\nferromagnets, since they do not obey the connectivity conditions. However, the\nground-state ferromagnetism can emerge, if the flat band becomes dispersive. To\nstudy this kinetic-energy-driven ferromagnetism we use perturbation theory and\nexact diagonalization of finite lattices. We find as a typical scenario that\nsmall and moderate dispersion may lead to a ferromagnetic ground state for\nsufficiently large on-site Hubbard repulsion $U>U_c$, where $U_c$ increases\nmonotonically with the acquired bandwidth. However, we also observe for some\nspecific parameter cases, that (i) ferromagnetism appears at already very small\n$U_c$, (ii) ferromagnetism does not show up at all, (iii) the critical on-site\nrepulsion $U_c$ is a nonmonotonic function of the bandwidth, or that (iv) a\ncritical bandwidth is needed to open the window for ground-state\nferromagnetism.\n", "  We discuss a qubit weakly coupled to a finite-size heat bath (calorimeter)\nfrom the point of view of quantum thermodynamics. The energy deposited to this\nenvironment together with the state of the qubit provides a basis to analyze\nthe heat and work statistics of this closed combined system. We present results\non two representative models, where the bath is composed of two-level systems\nor harmonic oscillators, respectively. Finally, we derive results for an open\nquantum system composed of the above qubit plus finite-size bath, but now the\nlatter is coupled to a practically infinite bath of the same nature of\noscillators or two-level systems.\n", "  In this paper we study the covering vertex model of the one-dimensional\nHubbard Hamiltonian constructed by Shastry in the realm of algebraic geometry.\nWe show that the Lax operator sits in a genus one curve which is not isomorphic\nbut only isogenous to the curve suitable for the AdS/CFT context. We provide an\nuniformization of the Lax operator in terms of ratios of theta functions\nallowing us to establish relativistic like properties such as crossing and\nunitarity. We show that the respective $\\mathrm{R}$-matrix weights lie on an\nAbelian surface being birational to the product of two elliptic curves with\ndistinct $\\mathrm{J}$-invariants. One of the curves is isomorphic to that of\nthe Lax operator but the other is solely fourfold isogenous. These results\nclarify the reason the $\\mathrm{R}$-matrix can not be written using only\ndifference of spectral parameters of the Lax operator.\n", "  Global fit studies performed in the pMSSM and the photon excess signal\noriginating from the Galactic Center seem to suggest compressed electroweak\nsupersymmetric spectra with a $\\sim$100 GeV bino-like dark matter particle. We\nfind that these scenarios are not probed by traditional electroweak\nsupersymmetry searches at the LHC. We propose to extend the ATLAS and CMS\nelectroweak supersymmetry searches with an improved strategy for bino-like dark\nmatter, focusing on chargino plus next-to-lightest neutralino production, with\na subsequent decay into a tri-lepton final state. We explore the sensitivity\nfor pMSSM scenarios with $\\Delta m = m_{\\rm NLSP} - m_{\\rm LSP} \\sim (5 - 50)$\nGeV in the $\\sqrt{s} = 14$ TeV run of the LHC. Counterintuitively, we find that\nthe requirement of low missing transverse energy increases the sensitivity\ncompared to the current ATLAS and CMS searches. With 300 fb$^{-1}$ of data we\nexpect the LHC experiments to be able to discover these supersymmetric spectra\nwith mass gaps down to $\\Delta m \\sim 9$ GeV for DM masses between 40 and 140\nGeV. We stress the importance of a dedicated search strategy that targets\nprecisely these favored pMSSM spectra.\n", "  Mono- and multilayer FeSe thin films grown on SrTiO$_\\mathrm{3}$ and\nBiTiO$_\\mathrm{3}$ substrates exhibit a greatly enhanced superconductivity over\nthat found in bulk FeSe. A number of proposals have been advanced for the\nmechanism of this enhancement. One possibility is the introduction of a\ncross-interface electron-phonon ($e$-$ph$) interaction between the FeSe\nelectrons and oxygen phonons in the substrates that is peaked in the forward\nscattering (small ${\\bf q}$) direction due to the two-dimensional nature of the\ninterface system. Motivated by this, we explore the consequences of such an\ninteraction on the superconducting state and electronic structure of a\ntwo-dimensional system using Migdal-Eliashberg theory. This interaction\nproduces not only deviations from the expectations of conventional\nphonon-mediated pairing but also replica structures in the spectral function\nand density of states, as probed by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy,\nscanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, and quasi-particle interference\nimaging. We also discuss the applicability of Migdal-Eliashberg theory for a\nsituation where the \\ep interaction is peaked at small momentum transfer and in\nthe FeSe/STO system.\n", "  This work is a continuation of our effort [Phys. Rev. C 91, 034616 (2015)] to\nexamine if signatures of a phase transition can be extracted from transport\nmodel calculations of heavy ion collisions at intermediate energy. A signature\nof first order phase transition is the appearance of a bimodal distribution in\n$P_m(k)$ in finite systems. Here P_m(k) is the probability that the maximum of\nthe multiplicity distribution occurs at mass number k. Using a well-known model\nfor event generation (BUU plus fluctuation), we do two cases of central\ncollision: mass 40 on mass 40 and mass 120 on mass 120. Bimodality is seen in\nboth the cases. The results are quite similar to those obtained in statistical\nmodel calculations.\n  An intriguing feature is seen. We observe that at the energy where bimodality\noccurs. other phase transition like signatures appear. There are breaks in\ncertain first order derivatives. We then examine if such breaks appear in\nstandard Botzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (BUU) calculations without fluctuations.\nThey do. The implication is interesting. If first order phase transition\noccurs, it may be possible to recognise that from ordinary BUU calculation.\nProbably the reason this was not seen already is because this aspect was not\ninvestigated before.\n", "  Comparative analysis of the interplay of hadron and Coulomb interactions in\n$pp^\\pm$ scattering amplitudes is performed in a broad energy interval,\n$\\sqrt{s}=1-10^6$ TeV, for two extreme cases: for the asymptotic interactions\nof hadrons in black disk and resonant disk modes. The interactions are\ndiscussed in terms of the $K$-matrix function technique. In the asymptotic\nregime the real part of the hadronic amplitude is concentrated in both cases on\nthe boundary of the disks in the impact parameter space but the LHC energy\nregion is not asymptotic for the resonant disk mode that lead to a specific\ninterplay of hadronic and coulombic amplitudes. For the $pp$ scattering at\n$\\sqrt{s}\\sim 10$ TeV an interplay of the hadron and Coulomb interactions in\nthe resonant disk modes is realized in a shoulder in $d\\sigma_{el}/d{\\bf q}^2$\nat ${\\bf q}^2\\sim 0.0025-0.0075$ GeV$^2$. The absence of such a shoulder in the\ndata at 8 TeV can be considered as an argument against the resonant disk mode.\n", "  In this lecture I will introduce the concept of galactic chemical evolution,\nnamely the study of how and where the chemical elements formed and how they\nwere distributed in the stars and gas in galaxies. The main ingredients to\nbuild models of galactic chemical evolution will be described. They include:\ninitial conditions, star formation history, stellar nucleosynthesis and gas\nflows in and out of galaxies. Then some simple analytical models and their\nsolutions will be discussed together with the main criticisms associated to\nthem. The yield per stellar generation will be defined and the hypothesis of\ninstantaneous recycling approximation will be critically discussed. Detailed\nnumerical models of chemical evolution of galaxies of different morphological\ntype, able to follow the time evolution of the abundances of single elements,\nwill be discussed and their predictions will be compared to observational data.\nThe comparisons will include stellar abundances as well as interstellar medium\nones, measured in galaxies. I will show how, from these comparisons, one can\nderive important constraints on stellar nucleosynthesis and galaxy formation\nmechanisms. Most of the concepts described in this lecture can be found in the\nmonograph by Matteucci (2012).\n", "  One of the primary science goals of the next generation of hard X-ray timing\ninstruments is to determine the equation of state of the matter at supranuclear\ndensities inside neutron stars, by measuring the radius of neutron stars with\ndifferent masses to accuracies of a few percent. Three main techniques can be\nused to achieve this goal. The first involves waveform modelling. The flux we\nobserve from a hotspot on the neutron star surface offset from the rotational\npole will be modulated by the star's rotation, giving rise to a pulsation.\nInformation about mass and radius is encoded into the pulse profile via\nrelativistic effects, and tight constraints on mass and radius can be obtained.\nThe second technique involves characterising the spin distribution of accreting\nneutron stars. The most rapidly rotating stars provide a very clean constraint,\nsince the mass-shedding limit is a function of mass and radius. However the\noverall spin distribution also provides a guide to the torque mechanisms in\noperation and the moment of inertia, both of which can depend sensitively on\ndense matter physics. The third technique is to search for quasi-periodic\noscillations in X-ray flux associated with global seismic vibrations of\nmagnetars (the most highly magnetized neutron stars), triggered by magnetic\nexplosions. The vibrational frequencies depend on stellar parameters including\nthe dense matter equation of state. We illustrate how these complementary X-ray\ntiming techniques can be used to constrain the dense matter equation of state,\nand discuss the results that might be expected from a 10m$^2$ instrument. We\nalso discuss how the results from such a facility would compare to other\nastronomical investigations of neutron star properties. [Modified for arXiv]\n", "  Different from the spin-1 Haldane gapped phase, we propose a novel SO(3)\nspin-1 matrix product state (MPS), whose parent Hamiltonian includes three-site\nspin interactions. From the entanglement spectrum of a single block with $l$\nsites, an enlarged SU(3) symmetry is identified in the edge states, which are\nconjugate to each other for the $l=even$ block but identical for the $l=odd$\nblock. By blocking this novel state, the blocked MPS explicitly displays the\nSU(3) symmetry with two distinct structures. Under a symmetric bulk bipartition\nwith a sufficient large block length $% l=even$, the entanglement Hamiltonian\n(EH) of the reduced system characterizes a spontaneous dimerized phase with\ntwo-fold degeneracy. However, for the block length $l=odd$, the corresponding\nEH represents an SU(3) quantum critical point with delocalized edge\nquasiparticles, and the critical field theory is described by the SU(3) level-1\nWess-Zumino-Witten conformal field theory.\n", "  A consistent and unified picture for critical phenomena of charged AdS black\nholes in $f(R)$ gravity is drawn in this paper. Firstly, we investigate the\nphase transition in canonical ensemble. We derive the explicit solutions\ncorresponding to the divergence of $C_Q$. The two solutions merge into one when\nthe condition $Q_c=\\sqrt{\\frac{-1}{3R_0}}$ is satisfied. The curve of specific\nheat for $Q<Q_c$ has two divergent points and can be divided into three\nregions. Both the large radius region and the small radius region are\nthermodynamically stable with positive specific heat while the medium radius\nregion is unstable with negative specific heat. However, when $Q>Q_c$, the\nspecific heat is always positive, implying the black holes are locally stable\nand no phase transition will take place. Secondly, both the $T-r_+$ curve and\n$T-S$ curve $f(R)$ AdS black holes are investigated and they exhibit Van der\nVaals like behavior as the $P-v$ curve in the former research. Critical\nphysical quantities are obtained and they are consistent with those derived\nfrom the specific heat analysis. We carry out numerical check of Maxwell equal\narea law for the cases $Q=0.2Q_c, 0.4Q_c, 0.6Q_c, 0.8Q_c$. The relative errors\nare amazingly small and can be negligible. So the Maxwell equal area law holds\nfor $T-S$ curve of $f(R)$ black holes. Thirdly, we establish\ngeometrothermodynamics for $f(R)$ AdS black hole to examine the phase\nstructure. It is shown that the Legendre invariant scalar curvature\n$\\mathfrak{R}$ would diverge exactly where the specific heat diverges. To\nsummarize, the above three perspectives are consistent with each other, thus\nproviding a unified picture which deepens the understanding of critical\nphenomena of $f(R)$ AdS black holes.\n", "  We discuss Born-Infeld type fields (tachyon fields) in classical and quantum\ncosmology. We first partly review and partly extend the discussion of the\nclassical solutions and focus in particular on the occurrence of singularities.\nFor quantization, we employ geometrodynamics. In the case of constant\npotential, we discuss both Wheeler-DeWitt quantization and reduced\nquantization. We are able to give various solutions and discuss their\nasymptotics. For the case of general potential, we transform the Wheeler-DeWitt\nequation to a form where it leads to a difference equation. Such a difference\nequation was previously found in the quantization of black holes. We give\nexplicit results for the cases of constant potential and inverse squared\npotential and point out special features possessed by solutions of the\ndifference equation.\n", "  For a conformal field theory (CFT) deformed by a relevant operator, the\nentanglement entropy of a ball-shaped region may be computed as a perturbative\nexpansion in the coupling. A similar perturbative expansion exists for excited\nstates near the vacuum. Using these expansions, this work investigates the\nbehavior of excited state entanglement entropies of small, ball-shaped regions.\nThe motivation for these calculations is Jacobson's recent work on the\nequivalence of the Einstein equation and the hypothesis of maximal vacuum\nentropy [arXiv:1505.04753], which relies on a conjecture stating that the\nbehavior of these entropies is sufficiently similar to a CFT. In addition to\nthe expected type of terms which scale with the ball radius as $R^d$, the\nentanglement entropy calculation gives rise to terms scaling as $R^{2\\Delta}$,\nwhere $\\Delta$ is the dimension of the deforming operator. When\n$\\Delta\\leq\\frac{d}{2}$, the latter terms dominate the former, and suggest that\na modification to the conjecture is needed.\n", "  Efficient manipulation and long distance transport of single-photons is a key\ncomponent in nanoscale quantum optics. In this letter, we study the emission\nproperties of an individual light emitter placed into a nanofiber and coupled\nto a metallic nanoparticle. We find that plasmonic field enhancement together\nwith the nanofiber optical confinement uniquely and synergistically contribute\nto an overall increase of emission rates as well as quantum yields.\n", "  Motivated by the 750 GeV diphoton excess found at LHC, we compute the maximal\nwidth into $\\gamma\\gamma$ that a neutral scalar can acquire through a loop of\ncharged fermions or scalars as function of the maximal scale at which the\ntheory holds, taking into account vacuum (meta)stability bounds. We show how an\nextra gauge symmetry can qualitatively weaken such bounds, and explore collider\nprobes and connections with Dark Matter.\n", "  We study a self-interacting scalar $\\varphi^4$ theory on the $d$-dimensional\nnoncommutative torus. We determine, for the particular cases $d=2$ and $d=4$,\nthe counterterms required by one-loop renormalization. We discuss higher loops\nin two dimensions and two-loop contributions to the self-energy in four\ndimensions. Our analysis points toward the absence of any problems related to\nthe UV/IR mixing and thus to renormalizability of the theory. However, we find\nanother potentially troubling phenomenon which is a wild behavior of the\ntwo-point amplitude as a function of the noncommutativity matrix $\\theta$.\n", "  We present a theory of the isotropic-nematic quantum phase transition in the\ncomposite Fermi liquid arising in half-filled Landau levels. We show that the\nquantum phase transition between the isotropic and the nematic phase is\ntriggered by an attractive quadrupolar interaction between electrons, as in the\ncase of conventional Fermi liquids. We derive the theory of the nematic state\nand of the phase transition. This theory is based on the flux attachment\nprocedure which maps an electron liquid in half-filled Landau levels into the\ncomposite Fermi liquid close to a nematic transition. We show that the local\nfluctuations of the nematic order parameters act as an effective dynamical\nmetric interplaying with the underlying Chern-Simons gauge fields associated\nwith the flux attachment. Both the fluctuations of the Chern-Simons gauge field\nand the nematic order parameter can destroy the composite fermion\nquasiparticles and drive the system into a non-Fermi liquid state. The\neffective field theory for the isotropic-nematic phase transition has $z = 3$\ndynamical exponent due to Landau damping effects. We show that there is a Berry\nphase type term which governs the effective dynamics of the nematic order\nparameter fluctuations, which can be interpreted as a non-universal \"Hall\nviscosity\" of the dynamical metric. We show that the effective field theory has\na Wen-Zee-type term. Both terms originate from the time-reversal breaking\nfluctuation of the Chern-Simons gauge fields. We present a perturbative\ncomputation of the Hall viscosity and also show that this term is also obtained\nby a Ward identity. We show that the disclination of the nematic fluid, carries\nan electric charge. We show that a resonance observed in radio-frequency\nconductivity experiments can be interpreted as a Goldstone nematic mode gapped\nby lattice effects.\n", "  We extend the microscopic particle-rotor model for hypernuclear low-lying\nstates by including the derivative and tensor coupling terms in the\npoint-coupling nucleon-$\\Lambda$ particle ($N\\Lambda$) interaction. Taking\n$^{13}_{~\\Lambda}$C as an example, we show that a good overall description for\nexcitation spectra is achieved with four sets of effective $N\\Lambda$\ninteraction. We find that the $\\Lambda$ hyperon binding energy decreases\nmonotonically with increasing the strengths of the high-order interaction\nterms. In particular, the tensor coupling term decreases the energy splitting\nbetween the first $1/2^-$ and $3/2^-$ states and increases the energy splitting\nbetween the first $3/2^+$ and $5/2^+$ states in $^{13}_{~\\Lambda}$C.\n", "  Accretion discs are ubiquitous in the universe and it is a crucial issue to\nunderstand how angular momentum and mass are being radially transported in\nthese objects. Here, we study the role played by non-linear spiral patterns\nwithin hydrodynamical and non self-gravitating accretion disc assuming that\nexternal disturbances such as infall onto the disc may trigger them. To do so,\nwe computed self-similar solutions that describe discs in which a spiral wave\npropagates. Such solutions present both shocks and critical sonic points that\nwe carefully analyze. For all allowed temperatures and for several spiral\nshocks, we calculated the wave structure. In particular we inferred the angle\nof the spiral patern, the stress it exerts on the disc as well as the\nassociated flux of mass and angular momentum as a function of temperature. We\nquantified the rate of angular momentum transport by means of the dimensionless\n$\\alpha$ parameter. For the thickest disc we considered (corresponding to $h/r$\nvalues of about 1/3), we found values of $\\alpha$ as high as $0.1$, and scaling\nwith the temperature $T$ such that $\\alpha \\propto T^{3/2} \\propto (h/r)^3$.\nThe spiral angle scales with the temperature as $\\arctan(r/h)$. The existence\nof these solutions suggests that perturbations occurring at disc outer\nboundaries, such as for example perturbations due to infall motions, can\npropagate deep inside the disc and therefore should not be ignored, even when\nconsidering small radii.\n", "  We present results for the leading hadronic contribution to the muon\nanomalous magnetic moment due to strange quark-connected vacuum polarisation\neffects. Simulations were performed using RBC--UKQCD's $N_f=2+1$ domain wall\nfermion ensembles with physical light sea quark masses at two lattice spacings.\nWe consider a large number of analysis scenarios in order to obtain solid\nestimates for residual systematic effects. Our final result in the continuum\nlimit is $a_\\mu^{(2)\\,{\\rm\nhad},\\,s}=53.1(9)\\left(^{+1}_{-3}\\right)\\times10^{-10}$.\n", "  The Bethe-Salpeter formalism represents the most accurate method available\nnowadays for computing neutral excitation energies and optical spectra of\ncrystalline systems from first principles. Bethe-Salpeter calculations yield\nvery good agreement with experiment but are notoriously difficult to converge\nwith respect to the sampling of the electronic wavevectors. Well-converged\nspectra therefore require significant computational and memory resources, even\nby today's standards. These bottlenecks hinder the investigation of systems of\ngreat technological interest. They are also barriers to the study of derived\nquantities like piezoreflectance, thermoreflectance or resonant Raman\nintensities.\n  We present a new methodology that decreases the workload needed to reach a\ngiven accuracy. It is based on a double-grid on-the-fly interpolation within\nthe Brillouin zone, combined with the Lanczos algorithm. It achieves\nsignificant speed-up and reduction of memory requirements. The technique is\nbenchmarked in terms of accuracy on silicon, gallium arsenide and lithium\nfluoride. The scaling of the performance of the method as a function of the\nBrillouin Zone point density is much better than a conventional implementation.\nWe also compare our method with other similar techniques proposed in the\nliterature.\n", "  We report local probe ($\\mu$SR) measurements on the recently discovered\ntetragonal FeS superconductor which has been predicted to be electronically\nvery similar to superconducting FeSe. Most remarkably, we find that low moment\n($10^{-2}-10^{-3}\\mu_\\mathrm{B})$ disordered magnetism with a transition\ntemperature of $T_\\mathrm{N}\\approx 20$ K microscopically coexists with bulk\nsuperconductivity below $T_\\mathrm{c}=4.3(1)$ K. From transverse field $\\mu$SR\nwe obtain an in-plane penetration depth $\\lambda_\\mathrm{ab}(0)=223(2)$ nm for\nFeS. The temperature dependence of the corresponding superfluid density\n$\\lambda_\\mathrm{ab}^{-2}(T)$ indicates a fully gapped superconducting state\nand is consistent with a two gap s-wave model. Additionally, we find that the\nsuperconducting $T_\\mathrm{c}$ of FeS continuously decreases for hydrostatic\npressures up to 2.2 GPa.\n", "  We study several aspects of supersymmetric models with a $U(1)_R$ symmetry\nwhere the Higgs doublet is identified with the superpartner of a lepton. We\nderive new, stronger bounds on the gaugino masses based on current\nmeasurements, and also propose ways to probe the model up to scales of\n$\\mathcal{O}(10\\, \\textrm{TeV})$ at future $e^+e^-$ colliders. Since the\n$U(1)_R$ symmetry cannot be exact, we analyze the effects of $R$-symmetry\nbreaking on neutrino masses and proton decay. In particular, we find that\ngetting the neutrino mixing angles to agree with experiments in a minimal model\nrequires a UV cutoff for the theory at around $ 10 \\text{ TeV} $.\n", "  Light curves of solar-type stars often show gradual fluctuations due to\nrotational modulation by magnetic features (starspots and faculae) on stellar\nsurfaces. Two quantitative measures of modulated light curves are employed as\nthe proxies of magnetic activity for solar-type stars observed with Kepler\ntelescope. The first is named autocorrelation index $i_{AC}$, which describes\nthe degree of periodicity of the light curve, the second is the effective\nfluctuation range of the light curve $R_{eff}$, which reflects the depth of\nrotational modulation. The two measures are complementary and depict different\naspects of magnetic activities on solar-type stars. By using the two proxies\n$i_{AC}$ and $R_{eff}$, we analyzed activity properties of two carefully\nselected solar-type stars observed with Kepler (Kepler ID: 9766237 and\n10864581), which have distinct rotational periods (14.7 vs. 6.0 days). We also\napplied the two measures to the Sun for a comparative study. The result shows\nthat both the measures can reveal cyclic activity variations (referred to as\n$i_{AC}$-cycle and $R_{eff}$-cycle) on the two Kepler stars and the Sun. For\nthe Kepler star with the faster rotation rate, $i_{AC}$-cycle and\n$R_{eff}$-cycle are in the same phase, while for the Sun (slower rotator), they\nare in the opposite phase. By comparing the solar light curve with simultaneous\nphotospheric magnetograms, it is identified that the magnetic feature that\ncauses the periodic light curve during solar minima is the faculae of the\nenhanced network region, which can also be a candidate of magnetic features\nthat dominate the periodic light curves on the two Kepler stars.\n", "  The CALICE Semi-Digital Hadronic Calorimeter (SDHCAL) prototype, built in\n2011, was exposed to beams of hadrons, electrons and muons in two short periods\nin 2012 on two different beam lines of the CERN SPS. The prototype with its 48\nactive layers, made of Glass Resistive Plate Chambers and their embedded\nreadout electronics, was run in triggerless and power-pulsing mode. The\nperformance of the SDHCAL during the test beam was found to be very\nsatisfactory with an efficiency exceeding 90% for almost all of the 48 active\nlayers. A linear response (within 5%) and a good energy resolution are obtained\nfor a large range of hadronic energies (5-80GeV) by applying appropriate\ncalibration coefficients to the collected data for both the Digital (Binary)\nand the Semi-Digital (Multi-threshold) modes of the SDHCAL prototype. The\nSemi-Digital mode shows better performance at energies exceeding 30GeV\n", "  We report single-photon emission from electrically driven site-controlled\nInGaN/GaN quantum dots, fabricated from a planar light-emitting diode structure\ncontaining a single InGaN quantum well using a top-down approach. The location,\ndimension, and height of each single-photon-emitting diode are controlled\nlithographically, providing great flexibility for chip-scale integration.\n", "  The electronic structures and topological properties of transition metal\ndipnictides $XPn_2$ ($X$=Ta, Nb; $Pn$=P, As, Sb) have been systematically\nstudied using first-principles calculations. In addition to small bulk Fermi\nsurfaces, the band anticrossing features near the Fermi level can be identified\nfrom band structures without spin-orbit coupling, leading to nodal lines in all\nthese compounds. Inclusion of spin-orbit coupling gaps out these nodal lines\nleaving only a pair of disentangled electron/hole bands crossing the Fermi\nlevel. Therefore, the low energy physics can be in general captured by the\ncorresponding two band model with several isolated small Fermi pockets.\nDetailed analysis of the Fermi surfaces suggests that the arsenides and\nNbSb$_2$ are nearly compensated semimetals while the phosphorides and TaSb$_2$\nare not. Based on the calculated band parities, the electron and hole bands are\nfound to be weakly topological non-trivial giving rise to surface states. As an\nexample, we presented the surface-direction-dependent band structure of the\nsurfaces states in TaSb$_2$.\n", "  It has recently been observed [Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 113002 (2014)] that the\nground-state energy may be obtained directly as a simple sum of augmented\nKohn-Sham orbital energies, where it was ascertained that the corresponding\none-body shifted Kohn-Sham effective potential has appealing features. With\nthis in mind, eigenvalue and virial constraints are deduced for approximating\nthis potential.\n", "  We apply the differential equation method to the calculation of the total\nBorn cross section of the process $Z_1Z_2\\to Z_1Z_2e^+e^-$. We obtain explicit\nexpression for the cross section exact in the relative velocity of the nuclei.\n", "  Nonlinear single Compton scattering has been thoroughly investigated in the\nliterature under the assumption that initially the electron has a definite\nmomentum. Here, we study a more general initial state, and consider the\nelectron as a wave-packet. In particular, we investigate the energy spectrum of\nthe emitted radiation and show that in typical experimental situations some\nfeatures of the spectra shown in previous works are almost completely washed\nout. Moreover, we show that at comparable relative uncertainties, the one in\nthe momentum of the incoming electron has a larger impact on the photon spectra\nat a fixed observation direction than the one on the laser frequency.\n", "  We consider search strategies for an extended Higgs sector at the\nhigh-luminosity LHC14 utilizing multi-top final states. In the framework of a\nTwo Higgs Doublet Model, the purely top final states ($t\\bar t, \\, 4t$) are\nimportant channels for heavy Higgs bosons with masses in the wedge above\n$2\\,m_t$ and at low values of $\\tan\\beta$, while a $2 b 2t$ final state is most\nrelevant at moderate values of $\\tan \\beta$. We find, in the $t\\bar t H$\nchannel, with $H \\rightarrow t \\bar t$, that both single and 3 lepton final\nstates can provide statistically significant constraints at low values of $\\tan\n\\beta$ for $m_A$ as high as $\\sim 750$ GeV. When systematics on the $t \\bar t$\nbackground are taken into account, however, the 3 lepton final state is more\npowerful, though the precise constraint depends fairly sensitively on lepton\nfake rates. We also find that neither $2b2t$ nor $t \\bar t$ final states\nprovide constraints on additional heavy Higgs bosons with couplings to tops\nsmaller than the top Yukawa due to expected systematic uncertainties in the $t\n\\bar t$ background.\n", "  We report on a classification of supersymmetric solutions to 11D supergravity\nwith $SO(2,2) \\times SO(3)$ isometry, which are AdS/CFT dual to 2D CFTs with\n$\\mathcal{N} = (0,4)$ supersymmetry. We recover the Maldacena, Strominger,\nWitten (MSW) near-horizon with small superconformal symmetry and identify a\nclass of $AdS_3 \\times S^2 \\times S^2 \\times CY_2$ geometries with emergent\nlarge superconformal symmetry. This exhausts known compact geometries.\nCompactification of M-theory on $CY_2$ results in a vacuum of 7D supergravity\nwith large superconformal symmetry, providing a candidate near-horizon for an\nextremal black hole and a potential new setting to address microstates.\n", "  Further consideration is given to the efficiency of black hole heat engines\nthat perform mechanical work via the pdV terms present in the First Law of\nextended gravitational thermodynamics. It is noted that when the engine cycle\nis a rectangle with sides parallel to the (p,V) axes, the efficiency can be\nwritten simply in terms of the mass of the black hole evaluated at the corners.\nSince an arbitrary cycle can be approximated to any desired accuracy by a\ntiling of rectangles, a general geometrical algorithm for computing the\nefficiency follows. A simple generalization of the algorithm renders it\napplicable to more general classes of heat engine, beyond the black hole\ncontext.\n", "  We modify the theory of nanoscale patterns produced by ion bombardment with\nconcurrent impurity deposition to take into account the effect that the\nnear-surface impurities have on the collision cascades. As the impurity\nconcentration is increased, the resulting theory successively yields a flat\nsurface, a rippled surface with its wavevector along the projected direction of\nion incidence, and a rippled surface with its wavevector rotated by 90 degrees.\nExactly the same morphological transitions were observed in recent experiments\nin which silicon was bombarded with an argon ion beam and gold was co-deposited\n[B.~Moon et al. arXiv:1601.02534 (2016)].\n", "  We study the electron-phonon coupling strength near the interface of\nmonolayer and bilayer FeSe thin films on SrTiO$_3$, BaTiO$_3$, and\noxygen-vacant SrTiO$_3$ substrates, using ab initio methods. The calculated\ntotal electron-phonon coupling strength $\\lambda=0.2\\text{--}0.3$ cannot\naccount for the high $T_c\\sim 70$ K observed in these systems through the\nconventional phonon-mediated pairing mechanism. In all of these systems,\nhowever, we find that the coupling constant of a polar oxygen branch peaks at\n$\\mathbf{q}=0$ with negligible coupling elsewhere, while the energy of this\nmode coincides with the offset energy of the replica bands measured recently by\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments. But the integrated\ncoupling strength for this mode from our current calculations is still too\nsmall to produce the observed high $T_c$, even through the more efficient\npairing mechanism provided by the forward scattering. We arrive at the same\nqualitative conclusion when considering a checkerboard antiferromagnetic\nconfiguration in the Fe layer. In light of the experimental observations of the\nreplica band feature and the relatively high $T_c$ of FeSe monolayers on polar\nsubstrates, our results point towards a cooperative role for the\nelectron-phonon interaction, where the cross-interface interaction acts in\nconjunction with a purely electronic interaction. We also discuss a few\nscenarios where the coupling strength obtained here may be enhanced.\n", "  We present a calculation of the low energy Greens function in $1+\\epsilon$\ndimensions using the method of extended poor man's scaling, developed here. We\ncompute the wave function renormalization $Z(\\omega)$ and also the decay rate\nnear the Fermi energy. Despite the lack of $\\omega^2$ damping characteristic of\n3-dimensional Fermi liquids, we show that quasiparticles do exist in\n$1+\\epsilon$ dimensions, in the sense that the quasiparticle weight $Z$ is\nfinite and that the damping rate is smaller than the energy. We explicitly\ncompute the crossover from this behavior to a 1-dimensional type\nTomonaga-Luttinger liquid behavior at higher energies.\n", "  In Markovian dynamics with the local detailed balance condition, we decompose\nthe total entropy production rate into microscopic transitions. By applying\nthis decomposition to the heat to work conversion process, we rigorously show\nthat the Carnot efficiency implies zero power for any heat engine, even with\nbroken time-reversal symmetry beyond the linear response regime. Moreover, we\npropose a trade-off relationship between the entropy production rate and the\nheat flow between the system and bath.\n", "  The recently observed diphoton excess at the LHC may suggest the existence of\na singlet (pseudo-) scalar particle with a mass of 750 GeV which couples to\ngluons and photons. Assuming that the couplings to gluons and photons originate\nfrom loops of fermions and/or scalars charged under the Standard Model gauge\ngroups, we show that here is a model-independent upper bound on the cross\nsection $\\sigma(pp\\to S\\to \\gamma\\gamma)$ as a function of the cutoff scale\n$\\Lambda$ and masses of the fermions and scalars in the loop. Such a bound\ncomes from the fact that the contribution of each particle to the diphoton\nevent amplitude is proportional to its contribution to the one-loop $\\beta$\nfunctions of the gauge couplings. We also investigate the perturbativity of\nrunning Yukawa couplings in models with fermion loops, and show the upper\nbounds on $\\sigma(pp\\to S\\to \\gamma\\gamma)$ for explicit models.\n", "  We discuss flavour dependent leptogenesis in the framework of lepton flavour\nmodels based on discrete flavour and CP symmetries applied to the type-I seesaw\nmodel. Working in the flavour basis, we analyse the case of two general\nresidual CP symmetries in the neutrino sector, which corresponds to all\npossible semi-direct models based on a preserved $Z_2$ in the neutrino sector,\ntogether with a CP symmetry, which constrains the PMNS matrix up to a single\nfree parameter which may be fixed by the reactor angle. We systematically study\nand classify this case for all possible residual CP symmetries, and show that\nthe $R$-matrix is tightly constrained up to a single free parameter, with only\ncertain forms being consistent with successful leptogenesis, leading to\npossible connections between leptogenesis and PMNS parameters. The formalism is\ncompletely general in the sense that the two residual CP symmetries could\nresult from any high energy discrete flavour theory which respects any CP\nsymmetry. As a simple example, we apply the formalism to a high energy $S_4$\nflavour symmetry with a generalized CP symmetry, broken to two residual CP\nsymmetries in the neutrino sector, recovering familiar results for PMNS\npredictions, together with new results for flavour dependent leptogenesis.\n", "  We systematically study several classical-quantum correspondence properties\nof the dissipative modified kicked rotator, a paradigmatic ratchet model. We\nexplore the behavior of the asymptotic currents for finite $\\hbar_{\\rm eff}$\nvalues in a wide range of the parameter space. We find that the correspondence\nbetween the classical currents with thermal noise providing uctuations of size\n$\\hbar_{\\rm eff}$ and the quantum ones without it, is very good in general with\nthe exception of specific regions. We systematically consider the spectra of\nthe corresponding classical Perron-Frobenius operators and quantum\nsuperoperators. By means of an average distance between the classical and\nquantum sets of eigenvalues we find that the correspondence is unexpectedly\nquite uniform. This apparent contradiction is solved with the help of the\nWeyl-Wigner distributions of the equilibrium eigenvectors, which reveal the key\nrole of quantum effects by showing surviving coherences in the asymptotic\nstates.\n", "  We study the Klein-Gordon equation of a scalar field conformally coupled to a\ncharged BTZ black hole. The background metric is obtained by coupling a\nnon-linear and conformal invariant Maxwell field to (2+1) gravity. We show that\nthe radial part is generally solved by a Heun function and, in the pure gravity\nlimit, by a hypergeometric function.\n", "  We report on an exploratory study of domain wall fermions (DWF) as a lattice\nregularisation for heavy quarks. Within the framework of quenched QCD with the\ntree-level improved Symanzik gauge action we identify the DWF parameters which\nminimise discretisation effects. We find the corresponding effective 4$d$\noverlap operator to be exponentially local, independent of the quark mass. We\ndetermine a maximum bare heavy quark mass of $am_h\\approx 0.4$, below which the\napproximate chiral symmetry and O(a)-improvement of DWF are sustained. This\nthreshold appears to be largely independent of the lattice spacing. Based on\nthese findings, we carried out a detailed scaling study for the heavy-strange\nmeson dispersion relation and decay constant on four ensembles with lattice\nspacings in the range $2.0-5.7\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$. We observe very mild $a^2$\nscaling towards the continuum limit. Our findings establish a sound basis for\nheavy DWF in dynamical simulations of lattice QCD with relevance to Standard\nModel phenomenology.\n", "  We show that if the new physics beyond the Standard Model is associated with\na first-order phase transition around $10^7-10^8$ GeV, the energy density\nstored in the resulting stochastic gravitational waves and the corresponding\npeak frequency are within the projected final sensitivity of the advanced\nLIGO/VIRGO detectors. We discuss some possible new physics scenarios that could\narise at such energies, and in particular, the consequences for Peccei-Quinn\nand supersymmetry breaking scales.\n", "  This study examines the mesoscale and submesoscale circulations along the\ncontinental slope in the northern Gulf of Mexico at depths greater than 1000 m.\nThe investigation is performed using a regional model run at two horizontal\ngrid resolutions, 5 km and 1.6 km, over a three year period from January 2010\nto December 2012. Ageostrophic submesoscale eddies, and vorticity filaments\npopulate the continental slope, and they are stronger and more abundant in the\nsimulation at higher resolution, as to be expected. They are formed from\nhorizontal shear layers at the edges of highly intermittent,\nbottom-intensified, along-slope boundary currents and in the cores of those\ncurrents when they are confined on steep slopes. The horizontal resolution\ninfluences the representation of the lateral and vertical transport of\nneutrally buoyant tracers. This is exemplified by a passive dye deployed near\nthe Macondo Prospect, where the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded in 2010, and at\nthe largest known natural hydrocarbon seep in the northern Gulf, few hundred\nkilometers to the west of the rig wellhead. The first site is characterized by\nweak mean currents and, in the high resolution run, by intense submesoscale\neddies that form to the west of the Macondo Prospect. GC600, on the other hand,\nis surrounded by a complicated bathymetry, and its flow is highly variable. The\ntrapping exerted by the submesoscale eddies and vorticity filaments near the\nrig constrain the spreading in the vicinity of the Macondo Prospect, and as a\nresult, patchiness in the passive tracer distributions differs in the two\nintegrations, despite similar diffusivities expressing the average spreading\nrate. The tracer released at GC600, on the other hand, is dispersed more\neffectively in the first six months in the higher resolution case due to\nenhanced near-bottom turbulent mixing.\n", "  Water shows intriguing thermodynamic and dynamic anomalies in the supercooled\nliquid state. One possible explanation of the origin of these anomalies lies in\nthe existence of a metastable liquid-liquid phase transition (LLPT) between two\n(high and low density) forms of water. While the anomalies are observed in\nexperiments on bulk and confined water and by computer simulation studies of\nwater-like models, the existence of a LLPT in water is still debated.\nUnambiguous experimental proof of the existence of a LLPT in bulk supercooled\nwater is hampered by fast ice nucleation which is a precursor of the\nhypothesized LLPT. Moreover, the hypothesized LLPT, being metastable, in\nprinciple cannot exist in the thermodynamic limit (infinite size, infinite\ntime). Therefore, computer simulations of water models are crucial for\nexploring the possibility of the metastable LLPT and the nature of the\nanomalies. In this work, we present new simulation results in the NVT ensemble\nfor one of the most accurate classical molecular models of water, TIP4P/2005.\nTo describe the computed properties and explore the possibility of a LLPT we\nhave applied two-structure thermodynamics, viewing water as a non-ideal mixture\nof two interconvertible local structures (\"states\"). The results suggest the\npresence of a liquid-liquid critical point and a LLPT in this model for the\nsimulated length and time scales. We have compared the behavior of TIP4P/2005\nwith other popular water-like models, namely mW and ST2, and with real water,\nall of which are well described by two-state thermodynamics. In view of the\ncurrent debate involving different studies of TIP4P/2005, we discuss\nconsequences of metastability and finite size in observing the liquid-liquid\nseparation. We also address the relationship between the phenomenological order\nparameter of two-structure thermodynamics and the microscopic nature of the\nlow-density structure.\n", "  We report on high energy terahertz pulses by optical rectification (OR) in\nthe organic crystal N-benzyl-2-methyl-4-nitroaniline (BNA) directly pumped by a\nconventional Ti:Sapphire (Ti:Sa) amplifier. The simple scheme provides an\noptical to terahertz conversion efficiency of 0.25% when pumped by a collimated\nlaser pulses with duration of 50 fs and central wavelength of 800nm. The\ngenerated radiation spans frequencies between 0.2 and 3 THz. We measured the\ndamage threshold as well as the dependency of the conversion efficiency on the\npump fluence, pump wavelength, and pulse duration.\n", "  Since the discovery of semiconducting monolayer transition metal\ndichalcogenides, a variety of experimental and theoretical studies have been\ncarried out seeking to understand the intrinsic exciton population decay and\nvalley relaxation dynamics. Reports of the exciton decay time range from\nhundreds of femtoseconds to ten nanoseconds, while the valley depolarization\ntime can exceed one nanosecond. At present, however, a consensus on the\nmicroscopic mechanisms governing exciton radiative and non-radiative\nrecombination is lacking. The strong exciton oscillator strength resulting in\nup to 20% absorption for a single monolayer points to ultrafast radiative\nrecombination. However, the low quantum yield and large variance in the\nreported lifetimes suggest that non-radiative Auger-type processes obscure the\nintrinsic exciton radiative lifetime. In either case, the electron-hole\nexchange interaction plays an important role in the exciton spin and valley\ndynamics. In this article, we review the experiments and theory that have led\nto these conclusions and comment on future experiments that could complement\nour current understanding.\n", "  This is a comment on the recent letter by Wang and Brady on \"Constant stress\nand pressure rheology of colloidal suspensions\", Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 158301\n(2015).\n", "  We explore the formation of massive high-redshift Population III (Pop III)\ngalaxies through photoionization feedback. We consider dark matter halos formed\nfrom progenitors that have undergone no star formation as a result of early\nreionization and photoevaporation caused by a nearby galaxy. Once such a halo\nreaches $\\approx 10^9~M_\\odot$, corresponding to the Jeans mass of the\nphotoheated intergalactic medium (IGM) at $z\\approx 7$, pristine gas is able to\ncollapse into the halo, potentially producing a massive Pop III starburst. We\nsuggest that this scenario may explain the recent observation of strong He II\n1640~\\AA~line emission in CR7, which is consistent with $\\sim 10^7~M_\\odot$ of\nyoung Pop III stars. Such a large mass of Pop III stars is unlikely without the\nphotoionization feedback scenario, because star formation is expected to inject\nmetals into halos above the atomic cooling threshold ($\\sim 10^8~M_\\odot$ at $z\n\\approx 7$). We use merger trees to analytically estimate the abundance of\nobservable Pop III galaxies formed through this channel, and find a number\ndensity of $\\approx 10^{-7}~{\\rm Mpc^{-3}}$ at $z=6.6$ (the redshift of CR7).\nThis is approximately a factor of ten lower than the density of Ly$\\alpha$\nemitters as bright as CR7.\n", "  Various engine types are thermodynamically equivalent in the quantum limit of\nsmall 'engine action'. Our previous derivation of the equivalence is restricted\nto Markovian heat baths and to implicit classical work repository (e.g., laser\nlight in the semi-classical approximation). In this paper all the components,\nbaths, batteries, and engine, are explicitly taken into account. To neatly\ntreat non-Markovian dynamics we use mediating particles that function as a heat\nexchanger. We find that on top of the previously observed equivalence there is\na higher degree of equivalence that cannot be achieved in the Markovian regime.\nNext we focus on the energy transfer to the work repository. A condition for\nzero entropy increase in the work repository is given. Moreover, it is shown\nthat in the strong coupling regime it is possible to charge a battery with\nenergy while reducing its entropy at the same time.\n", "  For a graph formed by vertices and weighted edges, a generalized minimum\ndominating set (MDS) is a vertex set of smallest cardinality such that the\nsummed weight of edges from each outside vertex to vertices in this set is\nequal to or larger than certain threshold value. This generalized MDS problem\nreduces to the conventional MDS problem in the limiting case of all the edge\nweights being equal to the threshold value. We treat the generalized MDS\nproblem in the present paper by a replica-symmetric spin glass theory and\nderive a set of belief-propagation equations. As a practical application we\nconsider the problem of extracting a set of sentences that best summarize a\ngiven input text document. We carry out a preliminary test of the statistical\nphysics-inspired method to this automatic text summarization problem.\n", "  The performance of the knife-edge method as a beam profiling technique for\ntightly focused light beams depends on several parameters, such as the material\nand height of the knife-pad as well as the polarization and wavelength of the\nfocused light beam under study. Here we demonstrate that the choice of the\nsubstrate the knife-pads are fabricated on has a crucial influence on the\nreconstructed beam projections as well. We employ an analytical model for the\ninteraction of the knife-pad with the beam and report good agreement between\nour numerical and experimental results. Moreover, we simplify the analytical\nmodel and demonstrate, in which way the underlying physical effects lead to the\napparent polarization dependent beam shifts and changes of the beamwidth for\ndifferent substrate materials and heights of the knife-pad.\n", "  As a natural consequence of cosmological hierarchical structure formation,\nsub-parsec supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) should be common in\ngalaxies but thus far have eluded spectroscopic identification. Based on four\ndecades of optical spectroscopic monitoring, we report that the nucleus of NGC\n5548, a nearby Seyfert galaxy long suspected to have experienced a major merger\nabout one billion years ago, exhibits long-term variability with a period of 14\nyears in the optical continuum and broad Hbeta emission line. Remarkably, the\ndouble-peaked profile of Hbeta shows systematic velocity changes with a similar\nperiod. These pieces of observations plausibly indicate that a SMBHB resides in\nthe center of NGC 5548. The complex, secular variations in the line profiles\ncan be explained by orbital motion of a binary with equal mass and a semi-major\naxis of 22 light-days (corresponding to 18 milli-parsec). At a distance of 75\nMpc, NGC 5548 is one of the nearest sub-parsec SMBHB candidates that offers an\nideal laboratory for gravitational wave detection.\n", "  The singlet ground state magnetism in pyrochlore osmates Y$_2$Os$_2$O$_7$ and\nHo$_2$Os$_2$O$_7$ is studied by DC and AC susceptibility, specific heat, and\nneutron powder diffraction measurements. Despite the expected non-magnetic\nsinglet in the strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) limit for Os$^{4+}$ ($5d^4$),\nY$_2$Os$_2$O$_7$ exhibits a spin-glass (SG) ground state below 4 K with weak\nmagnetism, suggesting possible proximity to a quantum phase transition between\nthe non-magnetic state in the strong SOC limit and the magnetic state in the\nstrong superexchange limit. Ho$_2$Os$_2$O$_7$ has the same structural\ndistortion as occurs in Y$_2$Os$_2$O$_7$. However, the Os sublattice in\nHo$_2$Os$_2$O$_7$ shows long-range magnetic ordering below 36\\,K. The sharp\ndifference of the magnetic ground state between Y$_2$Os$_2$O$_7$ and\nHo$_2$Os$_2$O$_7$ signals the singlet ground state magnetism in\n$R_2$Os$_2$O$_7$ is fragile and can be disturbed by the weak $4f-5d$\ninteractions.\n", "  Analytical evidence for the physical relevance of generalized Pauli\nconstraints (GPCs) has recently been provided in [PRL 110, 040404]: Natural\noccupation numbers $\\vec{\\lambda}\\equiv (\\lambda_i)$ of the ground state of a\nmodel system in the regime of weak couplings $\\kappa$ of three spinless\nfermions in one spatial dimension were found extremely close, in a distance\n$D_{min}\\sim \\kappa^8$ to the boundary of the allowed region. We provide a\nself-contained and complete study of this quasipinning phenomenon. In\nparticular, we develop tools for its systematic exploration and quantification.\nWe confirm that quasipinning in one dimension occurs also for larger particle\nnumbers and extends to intermediate coupling strengths, but vanishes for very\nstrong couplings. We further explore the non-triviality of our findings by\ncomparing quasipinning by GPCs to potential quasipinning by the less\nrestrictive Pauli exclusion principle constraints. This allows us to eventually\nconfirm the significance of GPCs beyond Pauli's exclusion principle.\n", "  In February-March 2014, the MAGIC telescopes observed the high-frequency\npeaked BL Lac 1ES 1011+496 (z=0.212) in flaring state at very-high energy (VHE,\nE>100GeV). The flux reached a level more than 10 times higher than any\npreviously recorded flaring state of the source. We present the description of\nthe characteristics of the flare presenting the light curve and the spectral\nparameters of the night-wise spectra and the average spectrum of the whole\nperiod. From these data we aim at detecting the imprint of the Extragalactic\nBackground Light (EBL) in the VHE spectrum of the source, in order to constrain\nits intensity in the optical band. For this we implement the method developed\nby the H.E.S.S. collaboration in which the intrinsic energy spectrum of the\nsource is modeled with a simple function, and the EBL-induced optical depth is\ncalculated using a template EBL model. The likelihood of the observed spectrum\nis then maximized, including a normalization factor for the EBL opacity among\nthe free parameters. From the data collected differential energy spectra was\nproduced for all nights of the observed period. Evaluating the changes in the\nfit parameters we conclude that the spectral shape for most of the nights were\ncompatible, regardless of the flux level, which enabled us to produce an\naverage spectrum from which the EBL imprint could be constrained. The\nlikelihood ratio test shows that the model with an EBL density\n1.07(-0.20,+0.24)_{stat+sys}, relative to the one in the tested EBL template\n(Dominguez et al.2011), is preferred at the 4.6 sigma level to the no-EBL\nhypothesis, with the assumption that the intrinsic source spectrum can be\nmodeled as a log-parabola. This would translate into a constraint of the EBL\ndensity in the wavelength range [0.24 um,4.25 um], with a peak value at 1.4 um\nof F=12.27_{-2.29}^{+2.75} nW m^{-2} sr^{-1}, including systematics.\n", "  A key property of glass forming alloys, the anomalously small volume\ndifference with respect to the crystal, is shown to arise as a direct\nconsequence of the soft repulsive potentials between metals. This feature of\nthe inter-atomic potential is demonstrated to be responsible for a significant\ncomponent of the glass forming ability of alloys due to the decrease in the\nenthalpy of fusion and the associated depression of the freezing point.\n", "  Extensive and independent observations of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) SN 2013dy\nare presented, including a larger set of $UBVRI$ photometry and optical spectra\nfrom a few days before the peak brightness to $\\sim$ 200 days after explosion,\nand ultraviolet (UV) photometry spanning from $t \\approx -10$ days to $t\n\\approx\\ +15$ days referring to the $B$ band maximum. The peak brightness\n(i.e., $M_{\\rm B} = -19.65 \\pm 0.40$ mag, $L_{\\rm max} = [1.95 \\pm 0.55] \\times\n10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$) and the mass of synthesised $^{56}$Ni (i.e.,\n$M$($^{56}$Ni) = 0.90 $\\pm$ 0.26 M$_{\\odot}$) are calculated, and they conform\nto the expectation for a SN Ia with a slow decline rate (i.e., $\\Delta\nm_{15}(B)$ = 0.90 $\\pm$ 0.03 mag, Phillips 1993). However, the near infrared\n(NIR) brightness of this SN (i.e., $M_{\\rm H} = -17.33 \\pm 0.30$ mag) is at\nleast 1.0 mag fainter than usual. Besides, spectroscopy classification reveals\nthat SN 2013dy resides on the border of \"core normal\" and \"shallow silicon\"\nsubclasses in the Branch et al. (2009) classification scheme, or on the border\nof the \"normal velocity\" SNe Ia and 91T/99aa-like events in the Wang et al.\n(2009a) system. These suggest that SN 2013dy is a slow-declining SN Ia located\non the transitional region of nominal spectroscopic subclasses and might not be\na typical normal sample of SNe Ia.\n", "  In this paper we propose an extended Kundu-Eckhaus equation (KEE) for\nmodeling the dynamics of skewed rogue waves emerging in the vicinity of a wave\nblocking point due to opposing current. The equation we propose is a KEE with\nan additional potential term therefore the results presented in this paper can\neasily be generalized to study the quantum tunneling properties of the rogue\nwaves and ultrashort (femtosecond) pulses of the KEE. In the frame of the\nextended KEE, we numerically show that the chaotic perturbations of the ocean\ncurrent trigger the occurrence of the rogue waves on the ocean surface. We\npropose and implement a split-step scheme and show that the extended KEE that\nwe propose is unstable against random chaotic perturbations in the current\nprofile. These perturbations transform the monochromatic wave field into a\nchaotic sea state with many peaks. We numerically show that the shapes of rogue\nwaves due to perturbations in the current profile closely follow the form of\nrational rogue wave solutions, especially for the central peak. We also discuss\nthe effects of magnitude of the chaotic current perturbations on the statistics\nof the rogue wave occurrence.\n", "  We explore structural and dynamical behavior of concentrated colloidal\nsuspensions made up by C-shape particles using Brownian dynamics computer\nsimulations and theory. In particular, we focus on the entanglement process\nbetween nearby particles for almost closed C-shapes with a small opening angle.\nDepending on the opening angle and the particle concentration, there is a\npercolation transition for the cluster of entangled particles which shows the\nclassical scaling characteristics. In a broad density range below the\npercolation threshold, we find a stretched exponential function for the\ndynamical decorrelation of the entanglement process. Finally, we study a set-up\ntypical in microrheology by dragging a single tagged particle with constant\nspeed through the suspension. We measure the cluster connected to and dragged\nwith this tagged particle. In agreement with a phenomenological theory, the\nsize of the dragged cluster depends on the dragging direction and increases\nmarkedly with the dragging speed.\n", "  Photodissociation cross sections for the SH$^+$ radical are computed from all\nrovibrational (RV) levels of the ground electronic state X$~^3\\Sigma^-$ for\nwavelengths from threshold to 500~\\AA. The five electronic transitions, $2~\n^3\\Sigma^- \\leftarrow$ X$~^3\\Sigma^-$, $3~ ^3\\Sigma^- \\leftarrow$\nX$~^3\\Sigma^-$, $A~ ^3\\Pi \\leftarrow$ X$~^3\\Sigma^-$, $2~ ^3\\Pi \\leftarrow$\nX$~^3\\Sigma^-$, and $3~ ^3\\Pi \\leftarrow$ X$~^3\\Sigma^-$, are treated with a\nfully quantum-mechanical two-state model, {i.e. no non-adiabatic coupling\nbetween excited states was included in our work.}. The photodissociation\ncalculations incorporate adiabatic potentials and transition dipole moment\nfunctions computed in the multireference configuration interaction approach\nalong with the Davidson correction (MRCI+Q), but adjusted to match available\nexperimental molecular data and asymptotic atomic limits. Local thermodynamic\nequilibrium (LTE) photodissociation cross sections were computed which assume a\nBoltzmann distribution of RV levels in the X$~^3\\Sigma^-$ molecular state of\nthe SH$^+$ cation. The LTE cross sections are presented for temperatures in the\nrange 1000-10,000~K. Applications of the current photodissociation cross\nsections to interstellar gas, photon-dominated regions, and stellar atmospheres\nare briefly discussed.\n", "  The construction of density-functional approximations is explored by modeling\nthe adiabatic connection em locally, using energy densities defined in terms of\nthe electrostatic potential of the exchange-correlation hole. These local\nmodels are more amenable to the construction of size-consistent approximations\nthan their global counterparts. In this work we use accurate input local\ningredients to assess the accuracy of range of local interpolation models\nagainst accurate exchange-correlation energy densities. The importance of the\nstrictly-correlated electrons (SCE) functional describing the strong coupling\nlimit is emphasized, enabling the corresponding interpolated functionals to\ntreat strong correlation effects. In addition to exploring the performance of\nsuch models numerically for the helium and beryllium isoelectronic series and\nthe dissociation of the hydrogen molecule, an approximate analytic model is\npresented for the initial slope of the local adiabatic connection. Comparisons\nare made with approaches based on global models and prospects for future\napproximations based on the local adiabatic connection are discussed.\n", "  We present a self-consistent mean-field model based on a two-component\nPauli-like equation that incorporates quantum and relativistic effects (up to\nsecond-order in 1/c) for both external and internal electromagnetic fields. By\ntaking the semi-relativistic limit of the Dirac-Maxwell equations in the\npresence of an external electromagnetic field we obtain an analytical\nexpression of a coherent light-induced mean-field Hamiltonian. The latter\nexhibits several mechanisms that involve the internal mean fields created by\nall the electrons and the external electromagnetic field (laser). The role\nplayed by the light-induced current density and the light-induced second-order\ncharge density acting as sources in Maxwell's equations are clarified. In\nparticular, we identify clearly four different mechanisms involving the spins\nthat may play an important role in coherent ultrafast spin dynamics.\n", "  Inspired by a recent ghost-free nonlinear massive gravity in four-dimensional\nspacetime, we study its higher dimensional scenarios. As a result, we are able\nto show the constant-like behavior of massive graviton terms for some\nwell-known metrics such as the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker, Bianchi\ntype I, and Schwarzschild-Tangherlini-(A)dS metrics in a specific\nfive-dimensional nonlinear massive gravity under an assumption that its\nfiducial metrics are compatible with physical ones. In addition, some simple\ncosmological solutions of the five-dimensional massive gravity will be figured\nout consistently.\n", "  We consider the problem of seismic velocity change estimation using ambient\nnoise recordings. Motivated by [23] we study how the velocity change estimation\nis affected by seasonal fluctuations in the noise sources. More precisely, we\nconsider a numerical model and introduce spatio-temporal seasonal fluctuations\nin the noise sources. We show that indeed, as pointed out in [23], the\nstretching method is affected by these fluctuations and produces misleading\napparent velocity variations which reduce dramatically the signal to noise\nratio of the method. We also show that these apparent velocity variations can\nbe eliminated by an adequate normalization of the cross-correlation functions.\nTheoretically we expect our approach to work as long as the seasonal\nfluctuations in the noise sources are uniform, an assumption which holds for\nclosely located seismic stations. We illustrate with numerical simulations and\nreal measurements that the proposed normalization significantly improves the\naccuracy of the velocity change estimation.\n", "  The main goal of this paper is to investigate numerically the dynamics of\nquantized vortex loops, just before the reconnection at finite temperature,\nwhen mutual friction essentially changes evolution of lines. Modeling is\nperformed on the base of vortex filament method with using the full Biot-Savart\nequation. It was discovered that initial position of vortices and the\ntemperature strongly affect the dependence on time of the minimum distance\n$\\delta (t)$ between tips of two vortex loops. In particular, in some cases the\nshrinking and collapse of vortex loops due to mutual friction occur earlier\nthan reconnection, thereby cancelling the latter. However, this relationship\ntakes a universal square-root form\n$\\delta\\left(t\\right)=\\sqrt{\\left(\\kappa/2\\pi\\right)\\left(t_{*}-t\\right)}$ at\ndistances smaller than the one, satisfying the Schwarz criterion, when nonlocal\ncontribution to the Biot-Savart equation becomes about equal to local\ncontribution. In the \"universal\" the nearest parts of vortices form a\npyramid-like structure with angles which are also don't depend both on the\ninitial configuration of filaments and on the temperature.\n", "  The production of a Bose-Einstein condensate made of positronium may be\nfeasible in the near future. Below the condensation temperature, the\npositronium collision process is modified by the presence of the condensate.\nThis makes the theoretical description of the positronium kinetics at low\ntemperature challenging. Based on the quasi-particle Bogoliubov theory, we\ndescribe the many-body particle-particle collision in a simple manner. We find\nthat, in a good approximation, the full positronium-positronium interaction can\nbe described by an effective scattering length. Our results are general and\napply to different species of bosons. The correction to the bare scattering\nlength is expressed in terms of a single dimensionless parameter that\ncompletely characterizes the condensate.\n", "  We report on a long wavelength emitting rare earth doped fiber laser with\nemission centered at 3.5 {\\mu}m and tunable across 450 nm. The longest\nwavelength emission was 3.78 {\\mu}m, which is the longest emission from a fiber\nlaser operating at room temperature. In a simple optical arrangement employing\ndielectric mirrors for feedback, the laser was capable of emitting 1.45 W of\nnear diffraction limited output power at 3.47 {\\mu}m. These emission\ncharacteristics compliment the emission from quantum cascade lasers and\ndemonstrate how all infrared dual wavelength pumping can be used to access high\nlying rare earth ion transitions that have previously relied on visible\nwavelength pumping.\n", "  In off-central heavy-ion collisions, the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is exposed\nto the strongest magnetic fields ever created in the universe. Due to the\nparamagnetic nature of the QGP at high temperatures, the spatially\ninhomogeneous magnetic field configuration exerts an anisotropic force density\nthat competes with the pressure gradients resulting from purely geometric\neffects. In this paper, we simulate (3+1)-dimensional ideal hydrodynamics with\nexternal magnetic fields to estimate the effect of this force density on the\nanisotropic expansion of the QGP in collisions at RHIC and at the LHC. While\nnegligible for quickly decaying magnetic fields, we find that long-lived fields\ngenerate a substantial force density that suppresses the momentum anisotropy of\nthe plasma by up to $20\\%$ at the LHC energy, and also leaves its imprint on\nthe elliptic flow $v_2$ of charged pions.\n", "  We study the Pauli equation in noncommutative two dimensional plane which\nexhibits the supersymmetry algebra when the gyro-magnetic ratio is $2$. The\nsignificance of the Seiberg-Witten map in this context is discussed and its\neffect in the problem is incorporated to all orders in $\\theta$. We map the\nnoncommutative problem to an equivalent commutative problem by using a set of\ngeneralised Bopp-shift transformations containing a scaling parameter. The\nenergy spectrum of the noncommutative Pauli Hamiltonian is obtained and found\nto be $\\theta$ corrected which is valid to all orders in $\\theta$.\n", "  We consider the rate of transition for a particle between two metastable\nstates coupled to a thermal environment for various magnitudes of the coupling\nstrength, using the recently proposed infrequent metadynamics approach (Tiwary\nand Parrinello, Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 230602 (2013)). We are interested in\nunderstanding how this approach for obtaining rate constants performs as the\ndynamics regime changes from energy diffusion to spatial diffusion.\nReassuringly, we find that the approach works remarkably well for various\ncoupling strengths in the strong coupling regime, and to some extent even in\nthe weak coupling regime.\n", "  I discuss \"truncated\" QCD studied recently by Glozman et al. through\nnumerical simulations. For two flavors it was observed that truncation restores\nthe full chiral U(2)\\times U(2) symmetry of the Lagrangian. Moreover,\nadditional enhancement of the above symmetry connecting representations with\ndistinct Lorentz spins was observed. I argue that the chiral symmetry\nrestoration in a confining theory could entail emergent (extra) dynamical\nflavors which would show up in the spectrum of color-singlet particles provided\ntheir mass \\neq 0. As an example, I consider truncated QCD with a single\nmassless Dirac quark. Assuming the validity of the above observations,I\ndemonstrate how a dynamical SU(2)_{fl} symmetry could emerge for massive spin-1\nmesons without contradicting general principles.\n", "  In this paper we analyze the quantum homological invariants (the Poincar\\'e\npolynomials of the $\\mathfrak{sl}_N$ link homology). In the case when the\ndimensions of homologies of appropriate topological spaces are precisely known,\nthe procedure of the calculation of the Kovanov-Rozansky type homology, based\non the Euler-Poincar\\'e formula can be appreciably simplified. We express the\nformal character of the irreducible tensor representation of the classical\ngroups in terms of the symmetric and spectral functions of hyperbolic geometry.\nOn the basis of Labastida-Mari\\~{n}o-Ooguri-Vafa conjecture, we derive a\nrepresentation of the Chern-Simons partition function in the form of an\ninfinite product in terms of the Ruelle spectral functions (the cases of a\nknot, unknot, and links have been considered). We also derive an\ninfinite-product formula for the orthogonal Chern-Simons partition functions\nand analyze the singularities and the symmetry properties of the\ninfinite-product structures.\n", "  Here we study subwavelength gratings for coupling into graphene plasmons by\nmeans of an an- alytical model based on transformation optics that is not\nlimited to very shallow gratings. We consider gratings that consist of a\nperiodic modulation of the charge density in the graphene sheet, and gratings\nformed by this conductivity modulation together with a dielectric grating\nplaced in close vicinity of the graphene. Explicit expressions for the\ndispersion relation of the plasmon po- laritons supported by the system, and\nreflectance and transmittance under plane wave illumination are given. We\ndiscuss the conditions for maximising the coupling between incident radiation\nand plasmons in the graphene, finding the optimal modulation strength for a\nconductivity grating.\n", "  This work is devoted to the construction of slowly rotating neutron stars in\nthe framework of the nonminimal derivative coupling sector of Horndeski theory.\nWe match the large radius expansion of spherically symmetric solutions with\ncosmological solutions and we find that the most viable model has only one free\nparameter. Then, by using several tabulated and realistic equations of state,\nwe establish numerically the upper bound for this parameter in order to\nconstruct neutron stars in the slow rotation approximation with the maximal\nmass observed today. We finally study the surface redshift and the inertia of\nthese objects and compare them with known data.\n", "  Electrostatics on global Anti-de-Sitter (AdS) spacetime is sharply different\nfrom that on global Minkowski spacetime. It admits a multipolar expansion with\neverywhere regular, finite energy solutions, for every multipole moment except\nthe monopole (arXiv:1507.04370). A similar statement holds for global AdS\nmagnetostatics. We show that everywhere regular, finite energy, electric plus\nmagnetic fields exist on AdS in three distinct classes: $(I)$ with\nnon-vanishing total angular momentum $J$; $(II)$ with vanishing $J$ but\nnon-zero angular momentum density, $T^t_\\varphi$; $(III)$ with vanishing $J$\nand $T^t_\\varphi$. Considering backreaction, these configurations remain\neverywhere smooth and finite energy, and we find, for example,\nEinstein-Maxwell-AdS solitons that are globally - Type I - or locally (but not\nglobally) - Type II - spinning. This backreaction is considered first\nperturbatively, using analytical methods and then non-perturbatively, by\nconstructing numerical solutions of the fully non-linear Einstein-Maxwell-AdS\nsystem. The variation of the energy and total angular momentum with the\nboundary data is explicitly exhibited for one example of a spinning soliton.\n", "  In this paper, we construct the additional $W$-symmetry and ghost symmetry of\ntwo-lattice field integrable hierarchies. Using the symmetry constraint, we\nconstruct constrained two-lattice integrable systems which contain several new\nintegrable difference equations. Under a further reduction, the constrained\ntwo-lattice integrable systems can be combined into one single integrable\nsystem, namely the well-known one dimensional original Toda hierarchy. We prove\nthat the one dimensional original Toda hierarchy has a nice Block Lie symmetry.\n", "  With the extended logarithmic flow equations and some extended Vertex\noperators in generalized Hirota bilinear equations, extended bigraded Toda\nhierarchy(EBTH) was proved to govern the Gromov-Witten theory of orbiford\n$c_{NM}$ in literature. The generating function of these Gromov-Witten\ninvariants is one special solution of the EBTH. In this paper, the multi-fold\nDarboux transformations and their determinant representations of the EBTH are\ngiven with two different gauge transformation operators. The two Darboux\ntransformations in different directions are used to generate new solutions from\nknown solutions which include soliton solutions of $(N,N)$-EBTH, i.e. the EBTH\nwhen $N=M$. From the generation of new solutions, one can find the big\ndifference between the EBTH and the extended Toda hierarchy(ETH). Meanwhile we\nplotted the soliton graphs of the $(N,N)$-EBTH from which some approximation\nanalysis will be given. From the analysis on velocities of soliton solutions,\nthe difference between the extended flows and other flows are shown. The two\ndifferent Darboux transformations constructed by us might be useful in\nGromov-Witten theory of orbiford $c_{NM}$.\n", "  In this paper, we constructed the addition formulae for several integrable\nhierarchies, including the discrete KP, the q-deformed KP, the two-component\nBKP and the D type Drinfeld-Sokolov hierarchies. With the help of the Hirota\nbilinear equations and $\\tau$ functions of different kinds of KP hierarchies,\nwe prove that these addition formulae are equivalent to these hierarchies.\nThese studies show that the addition formula in the research of the integrable\nsystems has good universality.\n", "  ANTS2 is a simulation and data processing package developed for position\nsensitive detectors with Anger camera type readout. The simulation module of\nANTS2 is based on ROOT package from CERN, which is used to store the detector\ngeometry and to perform 3D navigation. The module is capable of simulating\nparticle sources, performing particle tracking, generating photons of primary\nand secondary scintillation, tracing optical photons and generating photosensor\nsignals. The reconstruction module features several position reconstruction\nmethods based on the statistical reconstruction algorithms (including GPU-based\nimplementations), artificial neural networks and k-NN searches. The module can\nprocess simulated as well as imported experimental data containing photosensor\nsignals. A custom library for B-spline parameterization of spatial response of\nphotosensors is implemented which can be used to calculate and parameterize the\nspatial response of a detector. The package includes a graphical user interface\nwith an extensive set of configuration, visualization and analysis tools. ANTS2\nis being developed with the focus on the iterative (adaptive) reconstruction of\nthe detector response using flood field irradiation data. The package is\nimplemented in C++ programming language and it is a multiplatform, open source\nproject.\n", "  A class of vector-tensor theories arises naturally in the framework of\nquadratic gravity in spacetimes with linear vector distortion. Requiring the\nabsence of ghosts for the vector field imposes an interesting condition on the\nallowed connections with vector distortion: the resulting one-parameter family\nof connections generalises the usual Weyl geometry with polar torsion. The\ncosmology of this class of theories is studied, focusing on isotropic solutions\nwherein the vector field is dominated by the temporal component. De Sitter\nattractors are found and inhomogeneous perturbations around such backgrounds\nare analysed. In particular, further constraints on the models are imposed by\nexcluding pathologies in the scalar, vector and tensor fluctuations. Various\nexact background solutions are presented, describing a constant and an evolving\ndark energy, a bounce and a self-tuning de Sitter phase. However, the latter\ntwo scenarios are not viable under a closer scrutiny.\n", "  We analyse confining gauge theories where the 750 GeV di-photon resonance is\na composite techni-pion that undergoes anomalous decays into SM vectors. These\nscenarios naturally contain accidentally stable techni-pions Dark Matter\ncandidates. The di-photon resonance can acquire a larger width by decaying into\nDark Matter through the CP-violating $\\theta$-term of the new gauge theory\nreproducing the cosmological Dark Matter density as thermal relic.\n", "  f(Lovelock) gravities are simple generalizations of the usual f(R) and\nLovelock theories in which the gravitational action depends on some arbitrary\nfunction of the corresponding dimensionally-extended Euler densities. In this\npaper we study several aspects of these theories in general dimensions. We\nstart by identifying the generalized boundary term which makes the\ngravitational variational problem well-posed. Then, we show that these theories\nare equivalent to certain scalar-tensor theories and how this relation is\ncharacterized by the Hessian of f. We also study the linearized equations of\nthe theory on general maximally symmetric backgrounds. Remarkably, we find that\nthese theories do not propagate the usual ghost-like massive gravitons\ncharacteristic of higher-derivative gravities on such backgrounds. In some\nnon-trivial cases, the additional scalar associated to the trace of the metric\nperturbation is also absent, being the usual graviton the only dynamical field.\nIn those cases, the linearized equations are exactly the same as in Einstein\ngravity up to an overall factor, making them appealing as holographic toy\nmodels. We also find constraints on the couplings of a broad family of\nfive-dimensional f(Lovelock) theories using holographic entanglement entropy.\nFinally, we construct new analytic asymptotically flat and AdS/dS black hole\nsolutions for some classes of f(Lovelock) gravities in various dimensions.\n", "  Within a unified formulation, encompassing self-electrophoresis,\nself-diffusiophoresis, and self-thermophoresis, we provide a simple integral\nkernel transforming the relevant surface flux to particle velocity for any\nspheroid with axisymmetric surface activity and uniform phoretic mobility. We\ndefine efficacy, a dimensionless efficiency-like quantity expressing the speed\nresulting from unit absolute flux density on the surface, which allows a\nmeaningful comparison of the performance of different motor designs. For\nbipartite designs with piecewise uniform flux over complementary surface\nregions, the efficacy is mapped out over the entire range of geometry (discotic\nthrough sphere to rod-like) and of bipartitioning, and intermediate aspect\nratios that maximize efficacy are identified. Comparison is made to\nexperimental data from the literature.\n", "  During the Big Bang, ${}^{6}{\\rm Li}$ was synthesized via the ${}^{2}{\\rm\nH}(\\alpha,\\gamma){}^{6}{\\rm Li}$ reaction. After almost 25 years of the failed\nattempts to measure the ${}^{2}{\\rm H}(\\alpha,\\gamma){}^{6}{\\rm Li}$ reaction\nin the lab at the Big Bang energies, just recently the LUNA collaboration\npresented the first successful measurements at two different Big Bang energies\n[M. Anders {\\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 113}, 042501 (2014)]. In this\npaper we will discuss how to improve the accuracy of the direct experiment. To\nthis end the photon's angular distribution is calculated in the potential\nmodel. It contains contributions from electric dipole and quadrupole\ntransitions and their interference, which dramatically changes the photon's\nangular distribution. The calculated distributions at different Big Bang\nenergies have a single peak at $\\sim 50^{\\circ}$. These calculations provide\nthe best kinematic conditions to measure the ${}^{2}{\\rm\nH}(\\alpha,\\gamma){}^{6}{\\rm Li}$ reaction. The expressions for the total cross\nsection and astrophysical factor are also derived by integrating the\ndifferential cross section over the photon's solid angle. The LUNA data are in\nexcellent agreement with our calculations using a potential approach combined\nwith a well established asymptotic normalization coefficient for ${}^{6}{\\rm\nLi} \\to \\alpha +d$. Comparisons of the available experimental data for the\n$S_{24}$ astrophysical factor and different calculations are presented. The Big\nBang lithium isotopic ratio ${}^{6}{\\rm Li}/^{7}{\\rm Li} = (1.5 \\pm 0.3)\\times\n10^{-5}$ following from the LUNA data and the present analysis are discussed in\nthe context of the disagreement between the observational data and the standard\nBig Bang model, which constitutes the second Lithium problem.\n", "  We investigate a constraint on reheating followed by alpha-attractor-type\ninflation (the E-model and T-model) from an observation of the spectral index\nn_s. When the energy density of the universe is dominated by an energy\ncomponent with the cosmic equation-of-state parameter w_{re} during reheating,\nits e-folding number N_{re} and the reheating temperature T_{re} are bounded\ndepending on w_{re}. When the reheating epoch consists of two phases, where the\nenergy density of the universe is dominated by uniform inflaton field\noscillations in the first phase and by relativistic non-thermalised particles\nin the second phase, we find a constraint on the e-folding number of the first\noscillation phase, N_{sc}, depending the parameters of the inflaton potential.\nFor the simplest perturbative reheating scenario, we find the lower bound for a\ncoupling constant of inflaton decay in the E-model and T-model depending on the\nmodel parameters. We also find a constraint on the $\\alpha$ parameter,\n\\alpha\\simgt 0.01, for the T-model and E-model when we assume a broad resonance\nreheating scenario.\n", "  By numerical simulations and analytical studies, we show that the phenomenon\nof microwave-induced resistance oscillations can be understood as a classical\nmemory effect caused by re-collisions of electrons with scattering centers\nafter a cyclotron period. We develop a Drude-like approach to magneto-transport\nin presence of a microwave field, taking account of memory effects, and find an\nexcellent agreement between numerical and analytical results, as well as a\nqualitative agreement with experiment.\n", "  A plethora of active matter models exist that describe the behavior of\nself-propelled particles (or swimmers), both with and without hydrodynamics.\nHowever, there are few studies that consider shape-anisotropic swimmers and\ninclude hydrodynamic interactions. Here, we introduce a simple method to\nsimulate self-propelled colloids interacting hydrodynamically in a viscous\nmedium using the lattice-Boltzmann technique. Our model is based on\nraspberry-type viscous coupling and a force/counter-force formalism which\nensures that the system is force free. We consider several anisotropic shapes\nand characterize their hydrodynamic multipolar flow field. We demonstrate that\nshape-anisotropy can lead to the presence of a strong quadrupole and octupole\nmoments, in addition to the principle dipole moment. The ability to simulate\nand characterize these higher-order moments will prove crucial for\nunderstanding the behavior of model swimmers in confining geometries.\n", "  We present a geometry-independent method for determining the shapes of radial\nvolume density profiles of astronomical objects whose geometries are unknown,\nbased on a single column density map. Such profiles are often critical to\nunderstand the physics and chemistry of molecular cloud cores, in which star\nformation takes place. The method presented here does not assume any geometry\nfor the object being studied, thus removing a significant source of bias.\nInstead it exploits contour self-similarity in column density maps which\nappears to be common in data for astronomical objects. Our method may be\napplied to many types of astronomical objects and observable quantities so long\nas they satisfy a limited set of conditions which we describe in detail. We\nderive the method analytically, test it numerically, and illustrate its utility\nusing 2MASS-derived dust extinction in molecular cloud cores. While not having\nmade an extensive comparison of different density profiles, we find that the\noverall radial density distribution within molecular cloud cores is adequately\ndescribed by an attenuated power law.\n", "  We carried out deep and wide-field near- and mid-infrared observations for a\nsample of 8 bright-rimmed clouds (BRCs). Supplemented with the $Spitzer$\narchival data, we have identified and classified 44 to 433 young stellar\nobjects (YSOs) associated with these BRCs. The Class I sources are generally\nlocated towards the places with higher extinction and are relatively closer to\neach other than the Class II sources, confirming that the young protostars are\nusually found in regions having denser molecular material. On the other hand\nthe comparatively older population, Class II objects, are more randomly found\nthroughout the regions, which can be due to their dynamical evolution. Using\nthe minimal sampling tree analyses, we have extracted 13 stellar cores of 8 or\nmore members, which contains 60\\% of the total YSOs. The typical core is\n$\\sim$0.6 pc in radii and somewhat elongated (aspect ratio of 1.45), of\nrelatively low stellar density (surface density 60 pc$^{-2}$), consisting of a\nsmall (35) number of YSOs of relatively young sources (66\\% Class I ), and\npartially embedded (median $A_K$ =1.1 mag). But the cores show a wide range in\ntheir mass distribution ($\\sim$20 to 2400 M$_\\odot$) with a median value of\naround 130 M$_\\odot$. We have found the star formation efficiencies in the\ncores to be between 3\\% and 30\\% with an average of $\\sim$14\\%, which agree\nwith the efficiencies needed to link the core mass function to the initial mass\nfunction. We also found a linear relation between the density of the clouds and\nthe number of YSOs. The peaked nearest neighbor spacing distributions of the\nYSOs and the ratio of Jeans lengths to the YSOs separations indicates a\nsignificant degree of non-thermally driven fragmentation in these BRCs.\n", "  Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are radio bursts characterized by millisecond\ndurations, high Galactic latitude positions, and high dispersion measures. Very\nrecently, the cosmological origin of FRB 150418 has been confirmed by\n\\cite{kea16}, and FRBs are now strong competitors as cosmological probes. The\nsimple sharp feature of the FRB signal is ideal for them to probe some of the\nfundamental laws of physics. Here we show that by analyzing the delay time\nbetween different frequencies, the FRB data can place stringent upper limits on\nthe rest mass of the photon. For FRB 150418 at $z=0.492$, one can potentially\nreach $m_{\\gamma} \\leq 5.2 \\times 10^{-47}$ g, which is $10^{20}$ times smaller\nthan the rest mass of electron, and is about $10^3$ times smaller than that\nobtained using other astrophysical sources with the same method.\n", "  We visually inspected the light curves of 7557 Kepler Objects of Interest\n(KOIs) to search for single transit events (STEs) possibly due to long-period\ngiant planets. We identified 28 STEs in 24 KOIs, among which 14 events are\nnewly reported in this paper. We estimate the radius and orbital period of the\nobjects causing STEs by fitting the STE light curves simultaneously with the\ntransits of the other planets in the system or with the prior information on\nthe host star density. As a result, we found that STEs in seven of those\nsystems are consistent with Neptune- to Jupiter-sized objects of orbital\nperiods ranging from a few to $\\sim$ $20\\,\\mathrm{yr}$. We also estimate that\n$\\gtrsim20\\%$ of the compact multi-transiting systems host cool giant planets\nwith periods $\\gtrsim 3\\,\\mathrm{yr}$ on the basis of their occurrence in the\nKOIs with multiple candidates, assuming the small mutual inclination between\ninner and outer planetary orbits.\n", "  We employ Non-equilibrium Green's functions (NEGF) to describe the real-time\ndynamics of an adsorbate-surface model system exposed to ultrafast laser\npulses. For a finite number of electronic orbitals, the system is solved\nexactly and within different levels of approximation. Specifically i) the full\nexact quantum mechanical solution for electron and nuclear degrees of freedom\nis used to benchmark ii) the Ehrenfest approximation (EA) for the nuclei, with\nthe electron dynamics still treated exactly. Then, using the EA, electronic\ncorrelations are treated with NEGF within iii) 2nd Born and with iv) a recently\nintroduced hybrid scheme, which mixes 2nd Born self-energies with\nnon-perturbative, local exchange-correlation potentials of Density Functional\nTheory (DFT). Finally, the effect of a semi-infinite substrate is considered:\nwe observe that a macroscopic number of de-excitation channels can hinder\ndesorption. While very preliminary in character and based on a simple and\nrather specific model system, our results clearly illustrate the large\npotential of NEGF to investigate atomic desorption, and more generally, the non\nequilibrium dynamics of material surfaces subject to ultrafast laser fields.\n", "  It has been suggested that relativistic shocks in extragalactic sources may\naccelerate the most energetic cosmic rays. However, recent theoretical advances\nindicating that relativistic shocks are probably unable to accelerate particles\nto energies much larger than a PeV cast doubt on this. In the present\ncontribution we model the radio to X-ray emission in the southern hotspot of\nthe quasar 4C74.26. The synchrotron radio emission is resolved near the shock\nwith the MERLIN radio-interferometer, and the rapid decay of this emission\nbehind the shock is interpreted as the decay of the downstream magnetic field\nas expected for small scale turbulence. If our result is confirmed by analyses\nof other radiogalaxies, it provides firm observational evidence that\nrelativistic shocks at the termination region of powerful jets in FR II\nradiogalaxies do not accelerate ultra high energy cosmic rays.\n", "  In this paper we consider a model for gravity in 4-dimensional space-time\noriginally proposed by Chamseddine, which may be derived by dimensional\nreduction and truncation from a 5-dimensional Chern-Simons theory. Its\ntopological origin makes it an interesting candidate for an easier\nquantization, e.g., in the Loop Quantization framework. The present paper is\ndedicated to a classical analysis of the model's properties. Cosmological\nsolutions as well as wave solutions are found and compared with the\ncorresponding solutions of Einstein's General Relativity with cosmological\nconstant.\n", "  We perform large-scale field theoretical simulations in expanding universe to\ncharacterize a network of strings that can form composed bound states. The\nnetwork consists of two copies of Abelian Higgs strings (which we label p and\nq, respectively) coupled via a potential term to give pq bound states. The\nsimulations are performed using two different kinds of initial conditions: the\nfirst one with a network of p- and q-strings, and the second one with a network\nof q- and pq-strings. This way, we start from two opposite situations: one with\nno initial pq-strings, and one with a large initial number of pq-strings. We\nfind that in both cases the system scales, and in both cases the system prefers\nto have a low fraction of pq-strings. This is somewhat surprising in the case\nfor the second type of conditions, showing that the unzipping mechanism is very\nefficient. We also find hints that both initial conditions tend to asymptote to\na common configuration, though we would need a larger dynamical range to\nconfirm it. The average velocities of the different types of strings in the\nnetwork have also been explored for the first time.\n", "  Nonequilibrium Green's functions represent a promising tool for describing\ncentral nuclear reactions. Even at the single-particle level, though, the\nGreen's functions contain more information that computers may handle in the\nforeseeable future. In this study, we explore slab collisions in one dimension,\nfirst in the mean field approximation and demonstrate that only function\nelements close to the diagonal in arguments are relevant, in practice, for the\nreaction calculations. This bodes well for the application of the Green's\nfunctions to the reactions. Moreover we demonstrate that an initial state for a\nreaction calculation may be generated through adiabatic transformation of\ninteractions. Finally, we report on our progress in incorporating correlations\ninto the dynamic calculations.\n", "  Keane et al. recently detected a fading radio source following FRB 150418,\nleading to the identification of a putative host galaxy at $z = 0.492 \\pm\n0.008$. Assuming that the fading source is the afterglow of FRB 150418, I model\nthe afterglow and constrain the isotropic energy of the explosion to be a few\n$10^{50}$ erg, comparable to that of a short duration GRB. The outflow may have\na jet opening angle of $\\sim 0.22$ rad, so that the beaming-corrected energy is\nbelow $10^{49}$ erg. The results rule out most FRB progenitor models for this\nFRB, but may be consistent with either of the following two scenarios. The\nfirst scenario invokes a merger of an NS-NS binary, which produced an\nundetected short GRB and a supra-massive neutron star, which subsequently\ncollapsed into a black hole, probably 100s of seconds after the short GRB. The\nsecond scenario invokes a merger of a compact star binary (BH-BH, NS-NS, or\nBH-NS) system whose pre-merger dynamical magnetospheric activities made the\nFRB, which is followed by an undetected short GRB-like transient. The\ngravitational wave (GW) event GW150914 would be a sister of FRB 150418 in this\nsecond scenario. In both cases, one expects an exciting prospect of GW/FRB/GRB\nassociations.\n", "  The effect of temperature dependent asymmetric line broadening is\ninvestigated in Cu(NO$_3$)$_2\\cdot$2.5D$_2$O, a model material for a 1-D bond\nalternating Heisenberg chain, using the high resolution neutron-resonance\nspin-echo (NRSE) technique. Inelastic neutron scattering experiments on\ndispersive excitations including phase sensitive measurements demonstrate the\npotential of NRSE to resolve line shapes, which are non-Lorentzian, opening up\na new and hitherto unexplored class of experiments for the NRSE method beyond\nstandard line width measurements. The particular advantage of NRSE is its\ndirect access to the correlations in the time domain without convolution with\nthe resolution function of the background spectrometer. This novel application\nof NRSE is very promising and establishes a basis for further experiments on\ndifferent systems, since the results for Cu(NO$_3$)$_2\\cdot$2.5D$_2$O are\napplicable to a broad range of quantum systems.\n", "  We report on high-order magnetoplasmon resonances detected in photoresistance\nin high-mobility GaAs quantum wells. These resonances manifest themselves as a\nseries of photoresistance extrema in the regime of Shubnikov-de Haas\noscillations. Extending to orders above 20, the extrema exhibit alternating\nstrength, being less (more) pronounced at even (odd) order magnetoplasmon\nmodes. This experimental technique provides sensitive and elegant means to\ndetect and investigate multiple magnetoplasmon modes and could be applied to\nother systems.\n", "  Stochastic processes wherein the size of the state space is changing as a\nfunction of time offer models for the emergence of scale-invariant features\nobserved in complex systems. I consider such a sample-space reducing (SSR)\nstochastic process that results in a random sequence of strictly decreasing\nintegers $\\{x(t)\\}$, $0\\le t \\le \\tau$, with boundary conditions $x(0) = N$ and\n$x(\\tau)$ = 1. This model is shown to be exactly solvable:\n$\\mathcal{P}_N(\\tau)$, the probability that the process survives for time\n$\\tau$ is analytically evaluated. In the limit of large $N$, the asymptotic\nform of this probability distribution is Gaussian, with mean and variance both\nvarying logarithmically with system size: $\\langle \\tau \\rangle \\sim \\ln N$ and\n$\\sigma_{\\tau}^{2} \\sim \\ln N$. Correspondence can be made between survival\ntime statistics in the SSR process and record statistics of i.i.d. random\nvariables.\n", "  The electronic and magnetic properties of the collapsed-tetragonal\nCaPd$_2$As$_2$ superconductor (SC) with a transition temperature of 1.27 K have\nbeen investigated by $^{75}$As nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and nuclear\nquadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements. The temperature ($T$) dependence of\nthe nuclear spin lattice relaxation rates (1/$T_1$) and the Knight shifts\nindicate the absence of magnetic correlations in the normal state. In the SC\nstate, 1/$T_1$ measured by $^{75}$As NQR shows a clear Hebel-Slichter (HS) peak\njust below $T_{\\rm c}$ and decreases exponentially at lower $T$, confirming a\nconventional $s$-wave SC. In addition, the Volovik effect, also known as\nDoppler shift effect, has been clearly evidenced by the observation of the\nsuppression of the HS peak with applied magnetic field.\n", "  There is considerable fundamental and applicative interest in obtaining\nnon-diffractive and non-dispersive spatio-temporal localized wave packets\npropagating in optical cubic nonlinear or Kerr media. Here, we analytically\npredict the existence of a novel family of spatio-temporal dark lump solitary\nwave solutions of the (2+1)D nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation. Dark lumps\nrepresent multi-dimensional holes of light on a continuous wave background. We\nanalytically derive the dark lumps from the hydrodynamic exact soliton\nsolutions of the (2+1)D shallow water Kadomtsev-Petviashvili model, inheriting\ntheir complex interaction properties. This finding opens a novel path for the\nexcitation and control of optical multidimensional extreme wave phenomena of\nhydrodynamic footprint.\n", "  The Galactic Center Ridge has been observed extensively in the past by both\nGeV and TeV gamma-ray instruments revealing a wealth of structure, including a\ndiffuse component as well as the point sources G0.9+0.1 (a composite supernova\nremnant) and Sgr A* (believed to be associated with the supermassive black hole\nlocated at the center of our Galaxy). Previous very high energy (VHE) gamma-ray\nobservations with the H.E.S.S. experiment have also detected an extended TeV\ngamma-ray component along the Galactic plane in the >300 GeV gamma-ray regime.\nHere we report on observations of the Galactic Center Ridge from 2010-2014 by\nthe VERITAS telescope array in the >2 TeV energy range. From these observations\nwe 1.) provide improved measurements of the differential energy spectrum for\nSgr A* in the >2 TeV gamma-ray regime, 2.) provide a detection in the >2 TeV\ngamma-ray emission from the composite SNR G0.9+0.1 and an improved\ndetermination of its multi-TeV gamma-ray energy spectrum, 3.) report on the\ndetection of VER J1746-289, a localized enhancement of >2 TeV gamma-ray\nemission along the Galactic plane.\n", "  The angular correlation function is a powerful tool for deriving the\nclustering properties of AGN and hence the mass of the corresponding dark\nmatter halos in which they reside. However, studies based on the application of\nthe angular correlation function on X-ray samples, yield results apparently\ninconsistent with those based on the direct estimation of the spatial\ncorrelation function. The goal of the present paper is to attempt to\ninvestigate this issue by analysing a well defined sample. To this end we use\nthe hard-band (2-10 keV) X-ray selected sources of the Chandra AEGIS fields,\nchosen because of the availability of accurately derived flux sensitivity maps.\nIn particular we use the 186 hard-band sources with spectroscopic redshifts in\nthe range z=0.3-1.3, a range selected in order to contain the bulk of the AGN\nwhile minimizing the contribution of unknown clustering and luminosity\nevolution from very high redshifts. Using the projected spatial\nauto-correlation function, we derive a clustering comoving length of 5.4+-1.0\nMpc (for gamma=1.8), consistent with results in the literature. We further\nderive the angular correlation function and the corresponding spatial\nclustering length using the Limber's inversion equation and a novel\nparametrization of the clustering evolution model that also takes into account\nthe bias evolution of the host dark matter halo. The Limber's inverted spatial\ncomoving clustering length of 5.5+-1.2 Mpc at a median redshift of z~0.75,\nmatches the directly measured one, from the spatial correlation function\nanalysis, but for a significant non-linear contribution to the growing mode of\nperturbations, estimated independently from literature results of x_0 at\ndifferent redshifts. Therefore, using this sample of X-ray AGN and our\nclustering evolution parametrization we have found an excellent consistency\nbetween the angular and spatial clustering analysis.\n", "  The mass and decay constant of the $X(5568)$ state newly observed by D0\nCollaboration are computed within the two-point sum rule method using the\ndiquark-antidiquark interpolating current. In calculations, the vacuum\ncondensates up to eight dimensions are taken into account. The obtained result\nfor the mass of the $X(5568)$ state is in a nice agreement with the\nexperimental data.\n", "  It has been shown that ultraenergetic collisions can occur near the horizon\nof an extremal Kerr black hole. Previous studies mainly focused on geodesic\nmotions of particles. In this paper, we consider spinning test particles whose\norbits are non-geodesic. By employing the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equation,\nwe find the critical angular momentum satisfies $J=2E$ for extremal Kerr black\nholes. Although the conserved angular momentum $J$ and energy $E$ have been\nredefined in the presence of spin, the critical condition remains the same\nform. If a particle with this angular momentum collides with another particle\narbitrarily close to the horizon of the black hole, the center-of-mass energy\ncan be arbitrarily high. We also prove that arbitrarily high energies cannot be\nobtained for spinning particles near the horizons of non-extremal Kerr black\nholes.\n", "  A method is described which allows to deduce the dead-time of the front-end\nelectronics of the LHCb muon detector from a series of measurements performed\nat different luminosities at a bunch-crossing rate of 20 MHz. The measured\nvalues of the dead-time range from 70 ns to 100 ns. These results allow to\nestimate the performance of the muon detector at the future bunch-crossing rate\nof 40 MHz and at higher luminosity.\n", "  We review a recently developed micellization theory, which is based on a\nfree-energy approach and offers several advantages over the conventional one,\nbased on mass action and rate equations. As all the results are derived from a\nsingle free-energy expression, one can adapt the theory to different scenarios\nby merely modifying the initial expression. We present results concerning\nvarious features of micellization out of equilibrium, such as the existence of\nmetastable aggregates (premicelles), micellar nucleation and growth, transient\naggregates, and final relaxation toward equilibrium. Several predictions that\nawait experimental investigation are discussed.\n", "  Applying large magnetic fields to gain access to the hyperfine Paschen-Back\nregime can isolate three-level systems in a hot alkali metal vapors, thereby\nsimplifying usually complex atom-light interactions. We use this method to make\nthe first direct measurement of the $\\vert\\langle 5P\\vert\\vert er\\vert\\vert\n5D\\rangle\\vert$ matrix element in $^{87}$Rb. An analytic model with only three\nlevels accurately models the experimental electromagnetically induced\ntransparency spectra and extracted Rabi frequencies are used to determine the\ndipole matrix element. We measure $\\vert\\langle 5P_{3/2}\\vert\\vert er\\vert\\vert\n5D_{5/2}\\rangle\\vert = (2.290\\pm0.002_{\\rm stat}\\pm0.04_{\\rm syst})~ea_{0}$\nwhich is in excellent agreement with the theoretical calculations of Safronova,\nWilliams, and Clark [Phys. Rev. A \\textbf{69}, 022509 (2004)].\n", "  We used 2D coupled sine-Gordon equations combined with 3D heat diffusion\nequations to numerically investigate the thermal and electromagnetic properties\nof a $250 \\times 70\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^2$ intrinsic Josephson junction stack. The\n700 junctions are grouped to 20 segments; we assume that in a segment all\njunctions behave identically. At large input power a hot spot forms in the\nstack. Resonant electromagnetic modes, oscillating either along the length ((0,\n$n$) modes) or the width (($m$, 0) modes) of the stack or having a more complex\nstructure, can be excited both with and without a hot spot. At fixed bath\ntemperature and bias current several cavity modes can coexist in the absence of\na magnetic field. The (1, 0) mode, considered to be the most favorable mode for\nTHz emission, can be stabilized by applying a small magnetic field along the\nlength of the stack. A strong field-induced enhancement of the emission power\nis also found in experiment, for an applied field around 5.9 mT.\n", "  We present $^{12}$CO(1-0) and $^{12}$CO(2-1) observations of a sample of 20\nstar-forming dwarfs selected from the Herschel Virgo Cluster Survey, with\noxygen abundances ranging from 12 + log(O/H) ~ 8.1 to 8.8. CO emission is\nobserved in ten galaxies and marginally detected in another one. CO fluxes\ncorrelate with the FIR 250 $\\mu$m emission, and the dwarfs follow the same\nlinear relation that holds for more massive spiral galaxies extended to a wider\ndynamical range. We compare different methods to estimate H2 molecular masses,\nnamely a metallicity-dependent CO-to-H2 conversion factor and one dependent on\nH-band luminosity. The molecular-to-stellar mass ratio remains nearly constant\nat stellar masses <~ 10$^9$ M$_{\\odot}$, contrary to the atomic hydrogen\nfraction, M$_{HI}$/M$_*$, which increases inversely with M$_*$. The flattening\nof the M$_{H_2}$/M$_*$ ratio at low stellar masses does not seem to be related\nto the effects of the cluster environment because it occurs for both\nHI-deficient and HI-normal dwarfs. The molecular-to-atomic ratio is more\ntightly correlated with stellar surface density than metallicity, confirming\nthat the interstellar gas pressure plays a key role in determining the balance\nbetween the two gaseous components of the interstellar medium. Virgo dwarfs\nfollow the same linear trend between molecular gas mass and star formation rate\nas more massive spirals, but gas depletion timescales, $\\tau_{dep}$, are not\nconstant and range between 100 Myr and 6 Gyr. The interaction with the Virgo\ncluster environment is removing the atomic gas and dust components of the\ndwarfs, but the molecular gas appears to be less affected at the current stage\nof evolution within the cluster. However, the correlation between HI deficiency\nand the molecular gas depletion time suggests that the lack of gas\nreplenishment from the outer regions of the disc is lowering the star formation\nactivity.\n", "  It is well known that the Fock quantization of field theories in general\nspacetimes suffers from an infinite ambiguity, owing to the inequivalent\npossibilities in the selection of a representation of the canonical commutation\nor anticommutation relations, but also owing to the freedom in the choice of\nvariables to describe the field among all those related by linear\ntime-dependent transformations, including the dependence through functions of\nthe background. In this work we remove this ambiguity (up to unitary\nequivalence) in the case of a massive Dirac free field propagating in a\nspacetime with homogeneous and isotropic spatial sections of spherical\ntopology. Two physically reasonable conditions are imposed in order to arrive\nto this result: (a) The invariance of the vacuum under the spatial isometries\nof the background, and (b) the unitary implementability of the dynamical\nevolution that dictates the Dirac equation. We characterize the Fock\nquantizations with a non trivial fermion dynamics that satisfy these two\nconditions. Then, we provide a complete proof of the unitary equivalence of the\nrepresentations in this class under very mild requirements on the time\nvariation of the background, once a criterion to discern between particles and\nantiparticles has been set.\n", "  We investigate an efficient two-photon up-conversion process in more than one\nmolecule coupled to an optical antenna. In the previous work [Y. Osaka et al.,\nPRL 112, 133601 (2014)], we considered the two-photon up-conversion process in\na single molecule within one-dimensional input-output theory, and revealed that\ncontrolling the antenna-molecule coupling enables the efficient up-conversion\nwith radiative loss in the antenna suppressed. In this work, aiming to propose\na way to enhance the total probability of antenna-photon scattering, we extend\nthe model to the case of multiple molecules. In general, the presence of more\nthan one molecule decreases the up-conversion probability because they equally\nshare the energy of the two photons. However, it is shown that we can overcome\nthe difficulty by controlling the inter-molecule coupling. Our result implies\nthat, without increasing the incident photon number (light power), we can\nenlarge the net probability of the two-photon up-conversion.\n", "  The effects of quantum confinement on the momentum distribution of electrons\nconfined within a cylindrical potential well have been analyzed. The motivation\nis to understand specific features of the momentum distribution of electrons\nwhen the electron behavior is completely controlled by the parameters of a\nnon-isotropic potential cavity. It is shown that studying the solutions of the\nwave equation for an electron confined in a cylindrical potential well offers\nthe possibility to analyze the confinement behavior of an electron executing\none- or two-dimensional motion in the three-dimensional space within the\nframework of the same mathematical model. Some low-lying electronic states with\ndifferent symmetries have been considered and the corresponding wave functions\nhave been calculated; the behavior of their nodes and their peak positions with\nrespect to the parameters of the cylindrical well has been analyzed.\nAdditionally, the momentum distributions of electrons in these states have been\ncalculated. The limiting cases of the ratio of the cylinder length H and its\nradius R0 have been considered; when the cylinder length H significantly\nexceeds its radius R0 and when the cylinder radius is much greater than its\nlength. The cylindrical quantum confinement effects on the momentum\ndistribution of electrons in these potential wells have been analyzed. The\npossible application of the results obtained here for the description of the\ngeneral features in the behavior of electrons in nanowires with metallic type\nof conductivity (or nanotubes) and ultrathin epitaxial films (or graphene\nsheets) are discussed. Possible experiments are suggested where the quantum\nconfinement can be manifested.\n", "  We study D-instanton solutions in type IIB supergravity on $AdS_5\\times\nT^{1,1}$, which has a dual ${\\cal N}=1$ $SU(N)\\times SU(N)$ super Yang-Mills\ntheory. Apart from ordinary D(-1)-brane instantons, we discuss wrapped\nD1-branes over minimal 2-cycles and derive explicit solutions preserving half\nthe supersymmetries. These solutions are identified with Yang-Mills instantons\nwhich are (anti)self-dual in both gauge group factors with instanton charge\n$(k,k')$. By examining the boundary behaviour of the solutions we discuss the\ncoupling to the corresponding dual boundary operators, and identify their\nvacuum expectation values. We also discuss the boundary terms and compute the\naction for these solutions.\n", "  A novel optical layout for a multi-pass resonator is presented paving the way\nfor pulse energy scaling of mode-locked thin-disk lasers. The multi-pass\nresonator we are proposing consists of a concatenation of nearly identical\noptical segments. Each segment corresponds to a round-trip in an optically\nstable cavity containing an active medium exhibiting soft aperture effects.\nThis scheme is apt for energy and power scaling because the stability region of\nthis multi-pass resonator contrarily to the 4f-based schemes does not shrink\nwith the number of passes. Simulation of the eigen-mode of this multi-segment\nresonator requires considering aperture effects. This has been achieved by\nimplementing effective Gaussian apertures into the ABCD-matrix formalism as\nlenses with imaginary focal length. We conclude proposing a simple way to\ndouble the stability region of the state-of-the-art layouts used in industry\nachievable by a minimal rearrangement of the used optical components.\n", "  Infrared optical materials and devices are important for a wide range of\napplications in the defense, scientific, and consumer markets. For imaging,\nspectroscopy, microscopy and persistent surveillance, adaptive optic systems\nthat span the visible to infrared region are particularly useful. We address\nthis need with novel electrowetting lens and prism elements that operate from\n400 to 5000 nm. In contrast to conventional electrowetting devices that use\npolar liquids, limited by high absorption in the infrared region, we present\nroom-temperature ionic liquid-based (RTIL, N-Propyl-Nmethylpyrrolidinium\nBis(fluorosulfonyl)imide, Pyr1333a, Solvionic) lens and prism elements with\nunprecedented spectral bandwidths. Our electrowetting lenses tune over 20\ndiopters and have been demonstrated at 588, 1550 and 3000 nm wavelengths.\nAdditionally, we have demonstrated prism elements with a steering angle of\n0.56{\\deg} at 1550 nm.\n", "  Including on-site electronic interactions described by the multi-orbital\nHubbard model we study the correlation effects in the electronic structure of\nbulk palladium. We use a combined density functional and dynamical mean field\ntheory, LDA+DMFT, based on the fluctuation exchange approximation. The\nagreement between the experimentally determined and the theoretical lattice\nconstant and bulk modulus is improved when correlation effects are included. It\nis found that correlations modify the Fermi surface around the neck at the\n$L$-point while the Fermi surface tube structures show little correlation\neffects. At the same time we discuss the possibility of satellite formation in\nthe high energy binding region. Spectral functions obtained within the LDA+DMFT\nand $GW$ methods are compared to discuss non-local correlation effects. For\nrelatively weak interaction strength of the local Coulomb and exchange\nparameters spectra from LDA+DMFT shows no major difference in comparison to\n$GW$.\n", "  We analyze the possibility that several instability points may be formed, due\nto the Paczy\\'nski mechanism of violation of mechanical equilibrium, in the\norbiting matter around a supermassive Kerr black hole. We consider recently\nproposed model of ringed accretion disk, made up by several tori (rings) which\ncan be corotating or counterrotating relative to the Kerr attractor due to the\nhistory of the accretion process. Each torus is governed by the general\nrelativistic hydrodynamic Boyer condition of equilibrium configurations of\nrotating perfect fluids. We prove that the number of the instability points is\ngenerally limited and depends on the dimensionless spin of the rotating\nattractor.\n", "  The zero temperature phase diagram of the mono-axial chiral helimagnet in the\nmagnetic field plane formed by the components parallel and perpendicular to the\nhelical axis is thoroughly analyzed. The nature of the transition to the\ncommensurate state depends on the angle between the field and the helical axis.\nFor field directions close to the directions parallel or perpendicular to the\nhelical axis the transition is continuous, while for intermediate angles the\ntransition is discontinuous and the incommensurate and commensurate states\ncoexist on the transition line. The continuous and discontinuous transition\nlines are separated by two tricritical points with specific singular behaviour.\nThe location of the continuous and discontinuous lines and of the tricritical\npoints depend strongly on the easy-plane anisotropy, the effect of which is\nanalyzed. For large anisotropy the conical approximation locates the transition\nline very accurately, although it does not predict the continuous transitions\nnor the tricitical behaviour. It is shown that for large anisotropy, as in\nCrNb3S6, the form of the transition line is universal, that is, independent of\nthe sample, and obeys a simple equation. The position of the tricritical\npoints, which is not universal, is theoretically estimated for a sample of\nCrNb3S6\n", "  The ultrafast-rotating ($P_\\mathrm{rot}\\approx0.44 d$) fully convective\nsingle M4 dwarf V374 Peg is a well-known laboratory for studying intense\nstellar activity in a stable magnetic topology. As an observable proxy for the\nstellar magnetic field, we study the stability of the light curve, and thus the\nspot configuration. We also measure the occurrence rate of flares and coronal\nmass ejections (CMEs). We analyse spectroscopic observations, $BV(RI)_C$\nphotometry covering 5 years, and additional $R_C$ photometry that expands the\ntemporal base over 16 years. The light curve suggests an almost rigid-body\nrotation, and a spot configuration that is stable over about 16 years,\nconfirming the previous indications of a very stable magnetic field. We\nobserved small changes on a nightly timescale, and frequent flaring, including\na possible sympathetic flare. The strongest flares seem to be more concentrated\naround the phase where the light curve indicates a smaller active region.\nSpectral data suggest a complex CME with falling-back and re-ejected material,\nwith a maximal projected velocity of $\\approx$675km/s. We observed a CME rate\nmuch lower than expected from extrapolations of the solar flare-CME relation to\nactive stars.\n", "  The objective of this paper is to study the thermodynamics and thermodynamic\ngeometry of charged de-Sitter and charged anti de-Sitter black hole solutions\nin massive gravity. We study the effect of curvature parameter as well as the\nmass of graviton in the thermodynamics of the black hole system. We further\nextend our studies to different topology of the space time and its effects on\nphase transition and thermodynamics. In addition, the phase transition\nstructure of the black hole and its interactions are reproduced using\ngeometrothermodynamics.\n", "  The KATRIN experiment will probe the neutrino mass by measuring the\nbeta-electron energy spectrum near the endpoint of tritium beta-decay. An\nintegral energy analysis will be performed by an electro-static spectrometer\n(Main Spectrometer), an ultra-high vacuum vessel with a length of 23.2 m, a\nvolume of 1240 m^3, and a complex inner electrode system with about 120000\nindividual parts. The strong magnetic field that guides the beta-electrons is\nprovided by super-conducting solenoids at both ends of the spectrometer. Its\ninfluence on turbo-molecular pumps and vacuum gauges had to be considered. A\nsystem consisting of 6 turbo-molecular pumps and 3 km of non-evaporable getter\nstrips has been deployed and was tested during the commissioning of the\nspectrometer. In this paper the configuration, the commissioning with bake-out\nat 300{\\deg}C, and the performance of this system are presented in detail. The\nvacuum system has to maintain a pressure in the 10^{-11} mbar range. It is\ndemonstrated that the performance of the system is already close to these\nstringent functional requirements for the KATRIN experiment, which will start\nat the end of 2016.\n", "  (Abridged) The physical structure of deeply-embedded low-mass protostars\n(Class 0) on scales of less than 300 AU is still poorly constrained.\nDetermining this is crucial for understanding the physical and chemical\nevolution from cores to disks. In this study two models of the emission, a\nGaussian disk intensity distribution and a parametrized power-law disk model,\nare fitted to sub-arcsecond resolution interferometric continuum observations\nof five Class 0 sources, including one source with a confirmed Keplerian disk.\nFor reference, a spherically symmetric single power-law envelope is fitted to\nthe larger scale ($\\sim$1000 AU) emission and investigated further for one of\nthe sources on smaller scales. A thin disk model can approximate the emission\nand physical structure in the inner few 100 AU scales of the studied\ndeeply-embedded low-mass protostars and paves the way for analysis of a larger\nsample with ALMA. While the disk radii agree with previous estimates the masses\nare different for some of the sources studied. Assuming a typical temperature\ndistribution, the fractional amount of mass in the disk above 100 K varies in\nbetween 7% to 30%. Kinematic data are needed to determine the presence of any\nKeplerian disk. Using previous observations of p-H$_2^{18}$O, we estimate the\nrelative gas phase water abundances roughly an order of magnitude higher than\npreviously inferred when both warm and cold H$_2$ was used as reference. A\nspherically symmetric single power-law envelope model fails to simultaneously\nreproduce both the small and large scale emission.\n", "  We explore the potential of imaging vibrationally excited molecular emission\nat high angular resolution to better understand the morphology and physical\nstructure of the dense gas in Arp~220 and to gain insight into the nature of\nthe nuclear powering sources. Vibrationally excited emission of HCN is detected\nin both nuclei with a very high ratio relative to the total $L_{FIR}$, higher\nthan in any other observed galaxy and well above what is observed in Galactic\nhot cores. HCN $v_2=1f$ is observed to be marginally resolved in\n$\\sim60\\times50$~pc regions inside the dusty $\\sim100$~pc sized nuclear cores.\nIts emission is centered on our derived individual nuclear velocities based on\nHCO$^+$ emission ($V_{WN}=5342\\pm4$ and $V_{EN}=5454\\pm8$~\\kms, for the western\nand eastern nucleus, respectively). With virial masses within $r\\sim25-30$~pc\nbased on the HCN~$v_2=1f$ line widths, we estimate gas surface densities (gas\nfraction $f_g=0.1$) of $3\\pm0.3\\times10^4~M_\\odot~\\rm pc^{-2}$ (WN) and\n$1.1\\pm0.1\\times10^4~M_\\odot~\\rm pc^{-2}$ (EN). The $4-3/3-2$ flux density\nratio could be consistent with optically thick emission, which would further\nconstrain the size of the emitting region to $>15$~pc (EN) and $>22$~pc (WN).\nThe absorption systems that may hide up to $70\\%$ of the HCN and HCO$^+$\nemission are found at velocities of $-50$~\\kms~(EN) and $6$, $-140$, and\n$-575$~\\kms (WN) relative to velocities of the nuclei. Blueshifted absorptions\nare the evidence of outflowing motions from both nuclei. The bright vibrational\nemission implies the existence of a hot dust region radiatively pumping these\ntransitions. We find evidence of a strong temperature gradient that would be\nresponsible for both the HCN $v_2$ pumping and the absorbed profiles from the\nvibrational ground state as a result of both continuum and self-absorption by\ncooler foreground gas.\n", "  It is the aim of this paper to discuss the impact of nuclear fusion on the\nEOS. This is a timely subject given the expected availability of increasingly\nexotic beams at rare isotope facilities\\,\\cite{balantekin2014}. In practice, we\nfocus on $^{48}$Ca+$^{48}$Ca fusion. We employ three different approaches to\ncalculate fusion cross-sections for a set of energy density functionals with\nsystematically varying nuclear matter properties. Fusion calculations are\nperformed using frozen densities, using a dynamic microscopic method based on\ndensity-constrained time-dependent Hartree-Fock (DC-TDHF) approach, as well as\ndirect TDHF study of above barrier cross-sections. For these studies, we employ\na family of Skyrme parametrizations with systematically varied nuclear matter\nproperties. We find a slight preference for forces which deliver a slope of\nsymmetry energy of $L\\approx 50$\\,MeV that corresponds to a neutron-skin\nthickness of $^{48}$Ca of $R_\\mathrm{skin}\\!=\\!(0.180\\!-\\!0.210)$\\,fm.\n", "  We study the effect of $f(R)$ gravity on the statistical properties of\nvarious large-scale structures which can be probed in weak gravitational\nlensing measurements. A set of ray-tracing simulations of gravitational lensing\nin $f(R)$ gravity enables us to explore cosmological information on (i)\nstacking analyses of weak lensing observables and (ii) peak statistics in\nreconstructed lensing mass maps. For the $f(R)$ model proposed by Hu \\&\nSawicki, the measured lensing signals of dark matter haloes in the stacking\nanalysis would show a $\\simlt10\\%$ difference between the standard $\\Lambda$CDM\nand the $f(R)$ model when the additional degree of freedom in $f(R)$ model\nwould be $|f_{\\rm R0}|\\sim10^{-5}$. Among various large-scale structures to be\nstudied in stacking analysis, troughs, i.e, underdensity regions in projected\nplane of foreground massive haloes, could be promising to constrain the model\nwith $|f_{\\rm R0}|\\sim10^{-5}$, while stacking analysis around voids is found\nto be difficult to improve the constraint of $|f_{\\rm R0}|$ even in future\nlensing surveys with a sky coverage of $\\sim1000$ square degrees. On the peak\nstatistics, we confirm the correspondence between local maxima and dark matter\nhaloes along the line of sight, regardless of the modification of gravity in\nour simulation. Thus, the number count of high significance local maxima would\nbe useful to probe the mass function of dark matter haloes even in the $f(R)$\nmodel with $|f_{\\rm R0}|\\simlt10^{-5}$. We also find that including local\nminima in lensing mass maps would be helpful to improve the constant on $f(R)$\ngravity down to $|f_{\\rm R0}|=10^{-5}$ in ongoing weak lensing surveys.\n", "  An optical realization of the damped quantum oscillator, based on transverse\nlight dynamics in an optical resonator with slowly-moving mirrors, is\ntheoretically suggested. The optical resonator setting provides a simple\nimplementation of the time-dependent Caldirola-Kanai Hamiltonian of the\ndissipative quantum oscillator, and enables to visualize the effects of damped\noscillations in the classical (ray optics) limit and wave packet collapse in\nthe quantum (wave optics) regime.\n", "  The future space missions Euclid and WFIRST-AFTA will use the Halpha emission\nline to measure the redshifts of tens of millions of galaxies. The Halpha\nluminosity function at z>0.7 is one of the major sources of uncertainty in\nforecasting cosmological constraints from these missions. We construct unified\nempirical models of the Halpha luminosity function spanning the range of\nredshifts and line luminosities relevant to the redshift surveys proposed with\nEuclid and WFIRST-AFTA. By fitting to observed luminosity functions from Halpha\nsurveys, we build three models for its evolution. Different fitting\nmethodologies, functional forms for the luminosity function, subsets of the\nempirical input data, and treatment of systematic errors are considered to\nexplore the robustness of the results. Functional forms and model parameters\nare provided for all three models, along with the counts and redshift\ndistributions up to z~2.5 for a range of limiting fluxes (F_Halpha>0.5 - 3 x\n10^-16 erg cm^-2 s^-1) that are relevant for future space missions. For\ninstance, in the redshift range 0.90<z<1.8, our models predict an available\ngalaxy density in the range 7700--13300 and 2000--4800 deg^-2 respectively at\nfluxes above F_Halpha>1 and 2 x 10^-16 erg cm^-2 s^-1, and 32000--48000 for\nF_Halpha>0.5 x 10^-16 erg cm^-2 s^-1 in the extended redshift range 0.40<z<1.8.\nWe also consider the implications of our empirical models for the total Halpha\nluminosity density of the Universe, and the closely related cosmic star\nformation history.\n", "  We present electrically detected electron nuclear double resonance\nmeasurements of the nuclear spins of ionized and neutral arsenic donors in\nstrained silicon. In addition to a reduction of the hyperfine coupling, we find\nsignificant quadrupole interactions of the nuclear spin of the neutral donors\nof the order of 10 kHz. By comparing these to the quadrupole shifts due to\ncrystal fields measured for the ionized donors, we identify the effect of the\nadditional electron on the electric field gradient at the nucleus. This extra\ncomponent is expected to be caused by the coupling to electric field gradients\ncreated due to changes in the electron wavefunction under strain.\n", "  Recent applications of Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) technique to Fe-based\nsuperconductors opened a way to directly verify the applicability of the\nitinerant scenario for these systems. Fe-based superconductors undergo various\ninstabilities upon lowering temperature (magnetism, superconductivity,\nnematicity/orbital order), and one can check whether the hierarchy of\ninstabilities obtained within the itinerant approach is the same as in unbiased\nQMC simulations. In a recent paper [arXiv:1512:08523] the authors considered\nthe simplest two-band model with interaction tailored to favor orbital order.\nThe type of the orbital order found in QMC is different from the one found in\nearlier itinerant analysis. We report the results of our calculations within\nthe itinerant scenario and argue that they are in perfect agreement with QMC.\n", "  Cosmic rays are the highest energy particles found in nature. Measurements of\nthe mass composition of cosmic rays between 10^{17} eV and 10^{18} eV are\nessential to understand whether this energy range is dominated by Galactic or\nextragalactic sources. It has also been proposed that the astrophysical\nneutrino signal comes from accelerators capable of producing cosmic rays of\nthese energies. Cosmic rays initiate cascades of secondary particles (air\nshowers) in the atmosphere and their masses are inferred from measurements of\nthe atmospheric depth of the shower maximum, Xmax, or the composition of shower\nparticles reaching the ground. Current measurements suffer from either low\nprecision, or a low duty cycle and a high energy threshold. Radio detection of\ncosmic rays is a rapidly developing technique, suitable for determination of\nXmax with a duty cycle of in principle nearly 100%. The radiation is generated\nby the separation of relativistic charged particles in the geomagnetic field\nand a negative charge excess in the shower front. Here we report radio\nmeasurements of Xmax with a mean precision of 16 g/cm^2 between\n10^{17}-10^{17.5} eV. Because of the high resolution in $Xmax we can determine\nthe mass spectrum and find a mixed composition, containing a light mass\nfraction of ~80%. Unless the extragalactic component becomes significant\nalready below 10^{17.5} eV, our measurements indicate an additional Galactic\ncomponent dominating at this energy range.\n", "  Using a unified approach we study the entropy of extremal black holes through\nthe entropy of an electrically charged thin shell. We encounter three cases in\nwhich a shell can be taken to its own gravitational or horizon radius and\nbecome an extremal spacetime. In case 1, we use a non extremal shell, calculate\nall the thermodynamics quantities including the entropy, take it to the horizon\nradius, and then take the extremal limit. In case 2, we take the extremal limit\nand the horizon radius limit simultaneously, i.e., as the shell approaches its\nhorizon radius it also approaches extremality. In case 3, we build first an\nextremal shell, and then take its horizon radius. We find that the\nthermodynamic quantities in general have different expressions in the three\ndifferent cases. The entropy is the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy $ S=A_+/4$\n(where $A_+$ is the horizon area) in cases 1 and 2, and in case 3 it can be any\nwell-behaved function of $A_+$. The contributions from the various\nthermodynamic quantities for the entropy in all three cases are distinct.\nIndeed, in cases 1 and 2 the limits agree in what concerns the entropy but they\ndisagree in the behavior of all other thermodynamic quantities. Cases 2 and 3\ndisagree in what concerns the entropy but agree in the behavior of the local\ntemperature and electric potential. Case 2 is in a sense intermediate between\ncases 1 and 3. Our approach sheds light on the extremal black hole entropy\nissue.\n", "  We developed the theory of spin dependent transport through a spin-modulator\ndevice (so-called Datta-and-Das spin transistor) in the presence of a\nhigh-frequency electromagnetic field (dressing field). Solving the\nSchr\\\"odinger problem for dressed electrons, we demonstrated that the field\ndrastically modifies the spin transport. In particular, the dressing field\nleads to renormalization of spin-orbit coupling constants that varies\nconductivity of the spin transistor. The present effect paves the way for\ncontrolling the spin-polarized electron transport with light in prospective\nspin-optronic devices.\n", "  To understand the role of the environment in galaxy formation, evolution, and\npresent-day properties, it is essential to study the multi-frequency behavior\nof different galaxy populations under various environmental conditions. We\ncrossmatch the SDSS DR10 group catalog with GAMA Data Release 2 and Wide-field\nSurvey Explorer (WISE) data to construct a catalog of 1651 groups and 11436\ngalaxies containing photometric information in 15 different wavebands ranging\nfrom ultraviolet (0.152 {\\mu}m) to mid-infrared (22 {\\mu}m). We perform the\nspectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of galaxies using the MAGPHYS code\nand estimate the rest frame luminosities and stellar masses. We use the 1/Vmax\nmethod to estimate the galaxy stellar mass and luminosity functions, and the\nluminosity density field of galaxies to define the large scale environment of\ngalaxies. The stellar mass functions of both central and satellite galaxies in\ngroups are different in low and high density large scale environments.\nSatellite galaxies in high density environments have a steeper low mass end\nslope compared to low density environments, independently of the galaxy\nmorphology. Central galaxies in low density environments have a steeper low\nmass end slope but the difference disappears for fixed galaxy morphology. The\ncharacteristic stellar mass of satellite galaxies is higher in high density\nenvironments and the difference exists only for galaxies with elliptical\nmorphologies. Galaxy formation in groups is more efficient in high density\nlarge scale environments. Groups in high density environments have higher\nabundances of satellite galaxies, irrespective of the satellite galaxy\nmorphology. The elliptical satellite galaxies are generally more massive in\nhigh density environments. The stellar masses of spiral satellite galaxies show\nno dependence on the large scale environment.\n", "  Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) has become established as an\nindispensable tool for investigating aqueous systems of all kinds, including\nthose important in chemistry, surface science, biology and the earth sciences.\nNevertheless, many widely used approximations for the exchange-correlation (XC)\nfunctional describe the properties of pure water systems with an accuracy that\nis not fully satisfactory. The explicit inclusion of dispersion interactions\ngenerally improves the description, but there remain large disagreements\nbetween the predictions of different dispersion-inclusive methods. We present\nhere a review of DFT work on water clusters, ice structures and liquid water,\nwith the aim of elucidating how the strengths and weaknesses of different XC\napproximations manifest themselves across this variety of water systems. Our\nreview highlights the crucial role of dispersion in describing the delicate\nbalance between compact and extended structures of many different water\nsystems, including the liquid. By referring to a wide range of published work,\nwe argue that the correct description of exchange-overlap interactions is also\nextremely important, so that the choice of semi-local or hybrid functional\nemployed in dispersion-inclusive methods is crucial. The origins and\nconsequences of beyond-2-body errors of approximate XC functionals are noted,\nand we also discuss the substantial differences between different\nrepresentations of dispersion. We propose a simple numerical scoring system\nthat rates the performance of different XC functionals in describing water\nsystems, and we suggest possible future developments.\n", "  In this paper we propose that a fast radio burst (FRB) could originate from\nthe magnetic interaction between double neutron stars (NSs) during their final\ninspiral within the framework of a unipolar inductor model. In this model, an\nelectromotive force is induced on one NS to accelerate electrons to an\nultra-relativistic speed instantaneously. We show that coherent curvature\nradiation from these electrons moving along magnetic field lines in the\nmagnetosphere of the other NS is responsible for the observed FRB signal, that\nis, the characteristic emission frequency, luminosity, duration and event rate\nof FRBs can be well understood. In addition, we discuss several implications of\nthis model, including double-peaked FRBs and possible associations of FRBs with\nshort-duration gamma-ray bursts and gravitational wave events.\n", "  Measuring the power spectral density of a stochastic process, such as a\nstochastic force or magnetic field, is a fundamental task in many sensing\napplications. Quantum noise is becoming a major limiting factor to such a task\nin future technology, especially in optomechanics for temperature, stochastic\ngravitational wave, and decoherence measurements. Motivated by this concern,\nhere we prove a measurement-independent quantum limit to the accuracy of\nestimating the spectrum parameters of a classical stochastic process coupled to\na quantum dynamical system. We demonstrate our results by analyzing the data\nfrom a continuous optical phase estimation experiment and showing that the\nexperimental performance with homodyne detection is close to the quantum limit.\nWe further propose a spectral photon counting method that can attain\nquantum-optimal performance for weak modulation and a coherent-state input,\nwith an error scaling superior to that of homodyne detection at low\nsignal-to-noise ratios.\n", "  It is proved that in non-relativistic quantum mechanics (without spin) the\ntransition probability may be described in terms of particle paths, every path\nhaving a (positive) probability. This leads to a stochastic hidden variables\ntheory providing an intuitive picture of particle motion. The change of\nvelocity at every time has a probability that depends on the potential over a\nlarge region, at a difference with the local action of classical dynamics. Thus\nthe hidden variables theory is non-local like Bohm's, but not deterministic.\n", "  A search is performed for heavy Majorana neutrinos (N) decaying into a W\nboson and a lepton using the CMS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. A\nsignature of two jets and either two same sign electrons or a same sign\nelectron-muon pair is searched for using 19.7 inverse femtobarns of data\ncollected during 2012 in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of\n8 TeV. The data are found to be consistent with the expected standard model\n(SM) background and, in the context of a Type-1 seesaw mechanism, upper limits\nare set on the cross section times branching fraction for production of heavy\nMajorana neutrinos in the mass range between 40 and 500 GeV. The results are\nadditionally interpreted as limits on the mixing between the heavy Majorana\nneutrinos and the SM neutrinos. In the mass range considered, the upper limits\nrange between 0.00015 - 0.72 for |V[eN]|^2 and 6.6E-5 - 0.47 for |V[eN]\nV*[muN]|^2 / ( |V[eN]|^2 + |V[muN]|^2 ), where V[lN] is the mixing element\ndescribing the mixing of the heavy neutrino with the SM neutrino of flavour l.\nThese limits are the most restrictive direct limits for heavy Majorana neutrino\nmasses above 200 GeV.\n", "  We derive from first principles a three-dimensional theory of self-propelled\nparticle swarming in a viscous fluid environment. Our model predicts emergent\ncollective behavior that depends critically on fluid opacity, mechanism of\nself-propulsion, and type of particle-particle interaction. In \"clear fluids\"\nswimmers have full knowledge of their surroundings and can adjust their\nvelocities with respect to the lab frame, while in \"opaque fluids,\" they\ncontrol their velocities only in relation to the local fluid flow. We also show\nthat \"social\" interactions that affect only a particle's propensity to swim\ntowards or away from neighbors induces a flow field that is qualitatively\ndifferent from the long-ranged flow fields generated by direct \"physical\"\ninteractions. The latter can be short-ranged but lead to much longer-ranged\nfluid-mediated hydrodynamic forces, effectively amplifying the range over which\nparticles interact. These different fluid flows conspire to profoundly affect\nswarm morphology, kinetically stabilizing or destabilizing swarm configurations\nthat would arise in the absence of fluid. Depending upon the overall\ninteraction potential, the mechanism of swimming (e.g., pushers or pullers),\nand the degree of fluid opaqueness, we discover a number of new collective\nthree-dimensional patterns including flocks with prolate or oblate shapes,\nrecirculating peloton-like structures, and jet-like fluid flows that entrain\nparticles mediating their escape from the center of mill-like structures. Our\nresults reveal how the interplay among general physical elements influence\nfluid-mediated interactions and the self-organization, mobility, and stability\nof new three-dimensional swarms and suggest how they might be used to\nkinetically control their collective behavior.\n", "  The dynamical instability of weakly interacting two-component Bose--Einstein\ncondensates with coaxial quantized vortices is analytically investigated in a\ntwo-dimensional isotopic harmonic potential. We examine whether complex\neigenvalues appear on the Bogoliubov--de Gennes equation, implying dynamical\ninstability. Rather than solving the Bogoliubov--de Gennes equation\nnumerically, we rely on a perturbative expansion with respect to the coupling\nconstant which enables a simple, analytic approach. For each pair of winding\nnumbers and for each magnetic quantum number, the ranges of inter-component\ncoupling constant where the system is dynamically unstable are exhaustively\nobtained. Co-rotating and counter-rotating systems show distinctive behaviors.\nThe latter is much more complicated than the former with respect to dynamical\ninstability, particularly because radial excitations contribute to complex\neigenvalues in counter-rotating systems.\n", "  We present multiwavelength photometric catalogues (HST, Spitzer and Hawk-I K\nband) for the first two of the Frontier Fields, Abell2744 and MACSJ0416 (plus\ntheir parallel fields). To detect faint sources even in the central regions of\nthe clusters, we develop a robust and repeatable procedure that uses the public\ncodes Galapagos and Galfit to model and remove most of the light contribution\nfrom both the brightest cluster members as well as the ICL. We perform the\ndetection on the HST H160 processed image to obtain a pure H-selected sample.\nWe also add a sample of sources which are undetected in the H160 image but\nappear on a stacked infrared image. Photometry in the other HST bands is\nobtained using SExtractor, performed again on residual images after the Galfit\nprocedure for foreground light removal. Photometry on the Hawk-I and IRAC bands\nhas been obtained using our PSF-matching deconfusion code T-PHOT. A similar\nprocedure, but without the need for the foreground light removal, is adopted\nfor the Parallel fields. The procedure allows for the detection and the\nphotometric measurements of ~2500 sources per field. We deliver and release\ncomplete photometric H-detected catalogues, with the addition of a\ncomplementary sample of infrared-detected sources. All objects have\nmultiwavelength coverage including B to H HST bands, plus K band from Hawk-I,\nand 3.6 - 4.5 {\\mu}m from Spitzer. Full and detailed treatment of photometric\nerrors is included. We perform basic sanity checks on the reliability of our\nresults. The multiwavelength catalogues are publicly available and are ready to\nbe used for scientific purposes. Our procedures allows for the detection of\noutshined objects near the bright galaxies, which, coupled with the\nmagnification effect of the clusters, can reveal extremely faint high redshift\nsources. Full analysis on photometric redshifts is presented in a companion\nPaper II. [abridged]\n", "  We present the first public release of photometric redshifts, galaxy\nrest-frame properties and associated magnification values in the cluster and\nparallel pointings of the first two Frontier Fields, Abell-2744 and MACS-J0416.\nWe exploit a multi-wavelength catalogue ranging from HST to ground-based K and\nSpitzer IRAC which is specifically designed to enable detection and measurement\nof accurate fluxes in crowded cluster regions. The multi-band information is\nused to derive photometric redshifts and physical properties of sources\ndetected either in the H-band image alone or from a stack of four WFC3 bands.\nTo minimize systematics median photometric redshifts are assembled from six\ndifferent approaches to photo-z estimates. Their reliability is assessed\nthrough a comparison with available spectroscopic samples. State of the art\nlensing models are used to derive magnification values on an object-by-object\nbasis by taking into account sources positions and redshifts. We show that\nphotometric redshifts reach a remarkable ~3-5% accuracy. After accounting for\nmagnification the H band number counts are found in agreement at bright\nmagnitudes with number counts from the CANDELS fields, while extending the\npresently available samples to galaxies intrinsically as faint as H160~32-33\nthanks to strong gravitational lensing. The Frontier Fields allow to probe the\ngalaxy stellar mass distribution at 0.5-1.5 dex lower masses, depending on\nmagnification, with respect to extragalactic wide fields, including sources at\nMstar~ 10^7-10^8 Msun at z>5. Similarly, they allow the detection of objects\nwith intrinsic SFRs>1dex lower than in the CANDELS fields reaching 0.1-1\nMsun/yr at z~6-10. [abridged]\n", "  The first hydrostatic core, also called the first Larson core, is one of the\nfirst steps in low-mass star formation, as predicted by theory. With recent and\nfuture high performance telescopes, details of these first phases become\naccessible, and observations may confirm theory and even bring new challenges\nfor theoreticians. In this context, we study from a theoretical point of view\nthe chemical and physical evolution of the collapse of prestellar cores until\nthe formation of the first Larson core, in order to better characterize this\nearly phase in the star formation process. We couple a state-of-the-art\nhydrodynamical model with full gas-grain chemistry, using different assumptions\non the magnetic field strength and orientation. We extract the different\ncomponents of each collapsing core (i.e., the central core, the outflow, the\ndisk, the pseudodisk, and the envelope) to highlight their specific physical\nand chemical characteristics. Each component often presents a specific physical\nhistory, as well as a specific chemical evolution. From some species, the\ncomponents can clearly be differentiated. The different core models can also be\nchemically differentiated. Our simulation suggests some chemical species as\ntracers of the different components of a collapsing prestellar dense core, and\nas tracers of the magnetic field characteristics of the core. From this result,\nwe pinpoint promising key chemical species to be observed.\n", "  With the existing and upcoming large multi-fibre low-resolution\nspectrographs, the question arises how precise stellar parameters such as Teff\nand [Fe/H] can be obtained from low-resolution K-band spectra with respect to\ntraditional photometric temperature measurements. Until now, most of the\neffective temperatures in galactic Bulge studies come directly from photometric\ntechniques. Uncertainties in interstellar reddening and in the assumed\nextinction law could lead to large systematic errors. We aim to obtain and\ncalibrate the relation between Teff and the $\\rm ^{12}CO$ first overtone bands\nfor M giants in the galactic Bulge covering a wide range in metallicity. We use\nlow-resolution spectra for 20 M giants with well-studied parameters from\nphotometric measurements covering the temperature range 3200 < Teff < 4500 K\nand a metallicity range from 0.5 dex down to -1.2 dex and study the behaviour\nof Teff and [Fe/H] on the spectral indices. We find a tight relation between\nTeff and the $\\rm ^{12}CO(2-0)$ band with a dispersion of 95 K as well as\nbetween Teff and the $\\rm ^{12}CO(3-1)$ with a dispersion of 120 K. We do not\nfind any dependence of these relations on the metallicity of the star, making\nthem relation attractive for galactic Bulge studies. This relation is also not\nsensitive to the spectral resolution allowing to apply this relation in a more\ngeneral way.\n  We also found a correlation between the combination of the NaI, CaI and the\n$\\rm ^{12}CO$ band with the metallicity of the star. However this relation is\nonly valid for sub-solar metallicities. We show that low-resolution spectra\nprovide a powerful tool to obtain effective temperatures of M giants. We show\nthat this relation does not depend on the metallicity of the star within the\ninvestigated range and is also applicable to different spectral resolution.\n", "  (ABRIDGED) Globular clusters trace the formation and evolution of the Milky\nWay and surrounding galaxies, and outline their chemical enrichment history. To\naccomplish these tasks it is important to have large samples of clusters with\nhomogeneous data and analysis to derive kinematics, chemical abundances, ages\nand locations. We obtain homogeneous metallicities and alpha-element\nenhancement for over 800 red giant stars in 51 Galactic bulge, disc, and halo\nglobular clusters that are among the most distant and/or highly reddened in the\nGalaxy's globular cluster system. We observed R ~ 2000 spectra in the\nwavelength interval 456-586 nm and applied full spectrum fitting technique. We\ncompared the mean abundances of all clusters with previous work and with field\nstars. We used the relation between mean metallicity and horizontal branch\nmorphology defined by all clusters to select outliers for discussion. We find\nour metallicities are comparable to those derived from high-resolution data to\nwithin sigma = 0.08 dex over the interval -2.5 < [Fe/H] < 0.0. We also find\nthat the distribution of [Mg/Fe] and [alpha/Fe] with [Fe/H] for the 51 clusters\nfollows the general trend exhibited by field stars. It is the first time that\nthe following clusters have been included in a large sample of homogeneous\nstellar spectroscopic observations and metallicity derivation: BH 176, Djorg 2,\nPal 10, NGC 6426, Lynga 7, and Terzan 8. In particular, only photometric\nmetallicities were available previously for the first three clusters, and the\navailable metallicity for NGC 6426 was based on integrated spectroscopy and\nphotometry. Two other clusters, HP 1 and NGC 6558, are confirmed as candidates\nfor the oldest globular clusters in the Milky Way. The technique used here can\nalso be applied to globular cluster systems in nearby galaxies with current\ninstruments and to distant galaxies with the advent of ELTs.\n", "  We present low-resolution near-infrared stacked spectra from the 3D-HST\nsurvey up to $z=2.0$ and fit them with commonly used stellar population\nsynthesis models: BC03 (Bruzual & Charlot, 2003), FSPS10 (Flexible Stellar\nPopulation Synthesis, Conroy & Gunn 2010), and FSPS-C3K (Conroy, Kurucz,\nCargile, Castelli, in prep). The accuracy of the grism redshifts allows the\nunambiguous detection of many emission and absorption features, and thus a\nfirst systematic exploration of the rest-frame optical spectra of galaxies up\nto $z=2$. We select massive galaxies ($\\rm log(M_{*} / M_{\\odot}) > 10.8$), we\ndivide them into quiescent and star-forming via a rest-frame color-color\ntechnique, and we median-stack the samples in 3 redshift bins between $z=0.5$\nand $z=2.0$. We find that stellar population models fit the observations well\nat wavelengths below $\\rm 6500 \\AA$ rest-frame, but show systematic residuals\nat redder wavelengths. The FSPS-C3K model generally provides the best fits\n(evaluated with a $\\chi^2_{red}$ statistics) for quiescent galaxies, while BC03\nperforms the best for star-forming galaxies. The stellar ages of quiescent\ngalaxies implied by the models, assuming solar metallicity, vary from 4 Gyr at\n$z \\sim 0.75$ to 1.5 Gyr at $z \\sim 1.75$, with an uncertainty of a factor of 2\ncaused by the unknown metallicity. On average the stellar ages are half the age\nof the Universe at these redshifts. We show that the inferred evolution of ages\nof quiescent galaxies is in agreement with fundamental plane measurements,\nassuming an 8 Gyr age for local galaxies. For star-forming galaxies the\ninferred ages depend strongly on the stellar population model and the shape of\nthe assumed star-formation history.\n", "  We investigate how observations of synchrotron intensity fluctuations can be\nused to probe the sonic and Alfv\\'enic Mach numbers of interstellar turbulence,\nbased on mock observations performed on simulations of magnetohydrodynamic\nturbulence. We find that the structure function slope, and a diagnostic of\nanisotropy that we call the integrated quadrupole ratio modulus, both depend on\nthe Alfv\\'enic Mach number. However, these statistics also depend on the\norientation of the mean magnetic field in the synchrotron emitting region\nrelative to our line of sight, and this creates a degeneracy that cannot be\nbroken by observations of synchrotron intensity alone. We conclude that the\npolarization of synchrotron emission could be analyzed to break this\ndegeneracy, and suggest that this will be possible with the Square Kilometre\nArray.\n", "  It is a well known fact that the Black-Scholes equation admits an alternative\nrepresentation as a Schr\\\"odinger equation expressed in terms of a non\nself-adjoint hamiltonian. We show how {\\em pseudo-bosons}, linear or not,\nnaturally arise in this context, and how they can be used in the computation of\nthe pricing kernel.\n", "  Recent analyses of the orbits of some Kuiper Belt objects hypothesize the\npresence of an undiscovered Neptune-size planet at a very large separation from\nthe Sun. The energy budget of Neptunes on such distant orbits is dominated by\nthe internal heat released by their cooling rather than solar irradiation\n(making them effectively \"isolated\"). The blackbody radiation that these\nplanets emit as they cool may provide the means for their detection. Here we\nuse an analytical toy model to study the cooling and radiation of isolated\nNeptunes. This model can translate a detection (or a null detection) to a\nconstraint on the size and composition of the hypothesized \"Planet Nine\".\nSpecifically, the thick gas atmosphere of Neptune-like planets serves as an\ninsulating blanket which slows down their cooling. Therefore, a measurement of\nthe blackbody temperature, $T_{\\rm eff}\\sim 50\\textrm{K}$, at which a Neptune\nemits can be used to estimate the mass of its atmosphere, $M_{\\rm atm}$.\nExplicitly, we find the relation $T_{\\rm eff}\\propto M_{\\rm atm}^{1/12}$.\nDespite this weak relation, a measurement of the flux at the Wien tail can\nconstrain the atmospheric mass, at least to within a factor of a few, and\nprovide useful limits to possible formation scenarios of these planets.\nFinally, we constrain the size and composition of Planet Nine by combining our\nmodel with the null results of recent all-sky surveys.\n", "  The localization of the valence electron of $H$, $Li$ and $Na$ atoms enclosed\nby three different fullerene molecules is studied. The structure of the\nfullerene molecules is used to calculate the equilibrium position of the\nendohedrally atom as the minimum of the classical $(N+1)$-body Lennard-Jones\npotential. Once the position of the guest atom is determined, the fullerene\ncavity is modeled by a short range attractive shell according to molecule\nsymmetry, and the enclosed atom is modeled by an effective one-electron\npotential. In order to examine whether the endohedral compound is formed by a\nneutral atom inside a neutral fullerene molecule $X@C_{N}$ or if the valence\nelectron of the encapsulated atom localizes in the fullerene giving rise to a\nstate with the form $X^{+}@C_{N}^{-}$, we analyze the electronic density, the\nprojections onto free atomic states, and the weights of partial angular waves.\n", "  In active Brownian motion, an internal propulsion mechanism interacts with\ntranslational and rotational thermal noise and other internal fluctuations to\nproduce directed motion. We derive the distribution of its extreme fluctuations\nand identify its universal properties using large deviation theory. The limits\nof slow and fast internal dynamics give rise to a kink-like and parabolic\nbehavior of the corresponding rate functions, respectively. For dipolar Janus\nparticles in two and three dimensions interacting with a field, we predict a\nnovel symmetry akin to, but different from, the one related to entropy\nproduction. Measurements of these extreme fluctuations could thus be used to\ninfer properties of the underlying, often hidden, network of states.\n", "  Interstellar ultraviolet absorption-lines provide crucial information about\nthe properties of galactic outflows. In this paper, we augment our previous\nanalysis of the systematic properties of starburst-driven galactic outflows by\nexpanding our sample to include a rare population of starbursts with\nexceptionally high outflow velocities. In principle, these could be a\nqualitatively different phenomenon from more typical outflows. However, we find\nthat instead these starbursts lie on, or along the extrapolation of, the trends\ndefined by the more typical systems studied previously by us. We exploit the\nwide dynamic range provided by this new sample to determine scaling relations\nof outflow velocity with galaxy stellar mass (M*), circular velocity,\nstar-formation rate (SFR), SFR/M*, and SFR/area. We argue that these results\ncan be accommodated within the general interpretational framework we previously\nadvocated, in which a population of ambient interstellar or circum-galactic\nclouds is accelerated by the combined forces of gravity and the momentum flux\nfrom the starburst. We show that this simple physical picture is consistent\nwith both the strong cosmological evolution of galactic outflows in typical\nstar-forming galaxies and the paucity of such galaxies with spectra showing\ninflows. We also present simple parameterizations of these results that can be\nimplemented in theoretical models and numerical simulations of galaxy\nevolution.\n", "  We present multi-wavelength analysis of a quasi-periodic pulsation (QPP)\nobserved in the hard X-ray, radio, and extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) channels\nduring an M1.9 flare occurred on 23-24 September 2011. The non-thermal hard\nX-ray emission in 25-50 keV observed by RHESSI shows five distinct impulsive\npeaks of decaying amplitude with a period of about three minutes. Similar QPP\nwas observed in the microwave emission recorded by the Nobeyama Radioheliograph\nand Polarimeter in the 8.8, 15, 17 GHz channels. Interestingly, the 3-min QPP\nwas also observed in the metric and decimetric radio frequencies (25-180, 245,\n610 MHz) as repetitive type III bursts. Multi-wavelength observations from the\nSDO/AIA, Hinode/SOT, and STEREO/SECCHI suggest a fan-spine topology at the\neruption site, associated with the formation of a quasi-circular ribbon during\nthe flare. A small filament was observed below the fan-loops before the flare\nonset. The filament rose slowly and interacted with the ambient field. This\nbehaviour was followed by an untwisting motion of the filament. Two different\nstructures of the filament showed $\\sim$3-min periodic alternate rotation in\nthe clockwise and counterclockwise directions. The 3-min QPP was found to\nhighly correlate with 3-min oscillations in a nearby sunspot. We suggest that\nthe periodic reconnection (modulated either by sunspot slow-mode wave or by\nuntwisting filament) at a magnetic null-point most likely causes the repetitive\nparticle acceleration, generating the QPP observed in hard X-ray, microwave and\ntype III radio bursts.\n", "  We have proposed a unified framework towards the dynamics of optical and\nelectron vortex beams from the perspective of geometric phase and the\nassociated Hall effects. The unification is attributed to the notion that the\nspin degrees of freedom of a relativistic particle, either massive or massless,\nis associated with a vortex line. %The formulation in cylindrical coordinates\nleads to a local vortex structure related to orbital angular momentum(OAM).\nBased on cylindrical corodinate formulation, which leads to a local vortex\nstructure related to orbital angular momentum (OAM), it can be shown that when\nelectron vortex beams (EVBs) move in an external electric field paraxial beams\ngive rise to OAM Hall effect and non-paraxial beams with tilted vortices\ninitiate spin Hall effect in free space as well as in an external field. A\nsimilar analysis reveals that the paraxial optical vortex beams(OVBs) in an\ninhomogeneous medium induce OAM Hall effect whereas non-paraxial beams with\ntilted vortices drive the spin Hall effect. Moreover, both OVBs and EVBs with\ntilted vortices give rise to OAM states with arbitrary fractional value.\n", "  The collective diffusion of dense fluids in spatial confinement was studied\nby combining high-energy (21 keV) x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy and\nsmall-angle x-ray scattering from colloid-filled microfluidic channels. We\nfound the structural relaxation in confinement to be slower compared to bulk.\nThe collective dynamics is wave vector dependent, akin to de Gennes narrowing\ntypically observed in bulk fluids. However, in stark contrast to bulk, the\nstructure factor and de Gennes narrowing in confinement are anisotropic. These\nexperimental observations are essential in order to develop a microscopic\ntheoretical description of collective diffusion of dense fluids in confined\ngeometries.\n", "  The past few decades have seen dramatic progress in our ability to manipulate\nand coherently control matter-waves. Although the duality between particles and\nwaves has been well tested since de Broglie introduced the matter-wave analog\nof the optical wavelength in 1924, manipulating atoms with a level of coherence\nthat enables one to use these properties for precision measurements has only\nbecome possible with our ability to produce atomic samples exhibiting\ntemperatures of only a few millionths of a degree above absolute zero. Since\nthe initial experiments a few decades ago, the field of atom optics has\ndeveloped in many ways, with both fundamental and applied significance. The\nexquisite control of matter waves offers the prospect of a new generation of\nforce sensors exhibiting unprecedented sensitivity and accuracy, for\napplications from navigation and geophysics to tests of general relativity.\nThanks to the latest developments in this field, the first commercial products\nusing this quantum technology are now available. In the future, our ability to\ncreate large coherent ensembles of atoms will allow us an even more precise\ncontrol of the matter-wave and the ability to create highly entangled states\nfor non-classical atom interferometry.\n", "  The self-consistent probabilistic approach has proven itself powerful in\nstudying the percolation behavior of interdependent or multiplex networks\nwithout tracking the percolation process through each cascading step. In order\nto understand how directed dependency links impact criticality, we employ this\napproach to study the percolation properties of networks with both undirected\nconnectivity links and directed dependency links. We find that when a random\nnetwork with a given degree distribution undergoes a second-order phase\ntransition, the critical point and the unstable regime surrounding the\nsecond-order phase transition regime are determined by the proportion of nodes\nthat do not depend on any other nodes. Moreover, we also find that the triple\npoint and the boundary between first- and second-order transitions are\ndetermined by the proportion of nodes that depend on no more than one node.\nThis implies that it is maybe general for multiplex network systems, some\nimportant properties of phase transitions can be determined only by a few\nparameters. We illustrate our findings using Erdos-Renyi (ER) networks.\n", "  We predict that strong coupling between waveguide photons and excitons of\nquantum well embedded into waveguide results in the formation of hybrid dark\nand anti-dark light-matter solitons. Such temporal solitons exist due to\ninterplay between repulsive excitonic nonlinearity and giant group velocity\ndispersion arising in the vicinity of excitonic resonance. Such fully\nconservative states do not require external pumping to counteract losses and\nform continuous families parameterized by the power-dependent phase shift and\nvelocity of their motion. Dark solitons are stable in the considerable part of\ntheir existence domain, while anti-dark solitons are always unstable. Both\nfamilies exist outside forbidden frequency gap of the linear system.\n", "  We use the EAGLE galaxy formation simulation to study the effects of baryons\non the power spectrum of the total matter and dark matter distributions and on\nthe velocity fields of dark matter and galaxies. On scales\n$k{\\stackrel{>}{{}_\\sim}} 4{h\\,{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}}$ the effect of baryons on the\namplitude of the total matter power spectrum is greater than $1\\%$. The\nback-reaction of baryons affects the density field of the dark matter at the\nlevel of $\\sim3\\%$ on scales of $1\\leq k/({h\\,{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}})\\leq 5$. The dark\nmatter velocity divergence power spectrum at\n$k{\\stackrel{<}{{}_\\sim}}0.5{h\\,{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}}$ is changed by less than $1\\%$.\nThe 2D redshift-space power spectrum is affected at the level of $\\sim6\\%$ at\n$|\\vec{k}|{\\stackrel{>}{{}_\\sim}} 1{h\\,{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}}$ (for $\\mu>0.5$), but\nfor $|\\vec{k}|\\leq 0.4{h\\,{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}}$ it differs by less than $1\\%$. We\nreport vanishingly small baryonic velocity bias for haloes: the peculiar\nvelocities of haloes with $M_{200}>3\\times10^{11}{{\\rm M}_{\\odot}}$ (hosting\ngalaxies with $M_{*}>10^9{{\\rm M}_{\\odot}}$) are affected at the level of at\nmost $1~$km/s, which is negligible for $1\\%$-precision cosmology. We caution\nthat since EAGLE overestimates cluster gas fractions it may also underestimate\nthe impact of baryons, particularly for the total matter power spectrum.\nNevertheless, our findings suggest that for theoretical modelling of redshift\nspace distortions and galaxy velocity-based statistics, baryons and their\nback-reaction can be safely ignored at the current level of observational\naccuracy. However, we confirm that the modelling of the total matter power\nspectrum in weak lensing studies needs to include realistic galaxy formation\nphysics in order to achieve the accuracy required in the precision cosmology\nera.\n", "  We theoretically consider the superconductivity of the topological\nhalf-Heusler semimetals YPtBi and LuPtBi. We show that pairing occurs between\nj=3/2 fermion states, which leads to qualitative differences from the\nconventional theory of pairing between j=1/2 states. In particular, this\npermits Cooper pairs with quintet or septet total angular momentum, in addition\nto the usual singlet and triplet states. Purely on-site interactions can\ngenerate s-wave quintet time-reversal symmetry-breaking states with\ntopologically nontrivial point or line nodes. These local s-wave quintet pairs\nreveal themselves as d-wave states in momentum space. Furthermore, due to the\nbroken inversion symmetry in these materials, the s-wave singlet state can mix\nwith a p-wave septet state, again with topologically-stable line nodes. Our\nanalysis lays the foundation for understanding the unconventional\nsuperconductivity of the half-Heuslers.\n", "  The analysis of the core recoil momentum distribution of neutron-rich\nisotopes of light exotic nuclei is performed within a model of the halo nuclei\ndescribed by a core and two neutrons dominated by the $s-$wave channel. We\nadopt the renormalized three-body model with a zero-range force, that accounts\nfor the universal Efimov physics. This model is applicable to nuclei with large\ntwo-neutron halos compared to the core size, and a neutron-core scattering\nlength larger than the interaction range. The halo wave function in momentum\nspace is obtained by using as inputs the two-neutron separation energy and the\nenergies of the singlet neutron-neutron and neutron-core virtual states. Within\nour model, we obtain the momentum probability densities for the Borromean\nexotic nuclei Lithium-11 ($^{11}$Li), Berylium-14 ($^{14}$Be) and Carbon-22\n($^{22}$C). A fair reproduction of the experimental data was obtained in the\ncase of the core recoil momentum distribution of $^{11}$Li and $^{14}$Be,\nwithout free parameters. By extending the model to $^{22}$C, the combined\nanalysis of the core momentum distribution and matter radius suggest (i) a\n$^{21}$C virtual state well below 1 MeV; (ii) an overestimation of the\nextracted matter $^{22}$C radius; and (iii) a two-neutron separation energy\nbetween 100 and 400 keV.\n", "  Imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) such as the Major\nAtmospheric Gamma-ray Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC) telescopes endeavor to reach\nthe lowest possible energy threshold. In doing so the trigger system is a key\nelement. Reducing the trigger threshold is hampered by the rapid increase of\naccidental triggers generated by ambient light, the so-called Night Sky\nBackground (NSB). In this paper we present a topological trigger, dubbed\nTopo-trigger, which rejects events on the basis of their relative orientation\nin the telescope cameras. We have simulated and tested the trigger selection\nalgorithm in the MAGIC telescopes. The algorithm was tested using MonteCarlo\nsimulations and shows a rejection of 85% of the accidental stereo triggers\nwhile preserving 99 % of the gamma rays. A full implementation of this trigger\nsystem would achieve an increase in collection area between 10 and 20% at the\nenergy threshold. The analysis energy threshold of the instrument is expected\nto decrease by ~8 %. The selection algorithm was tested on real MAGIC data\ntaken with the current trigger configuration and no $\\gamma$-like events were\nfound to be lost.\n", "  Radiation pressure acceleration (RPA) is a highly efficient mechanism of\nlaser-driven ion acceleration, with with near complete transfer of the laser\nenergy to the ions in the relativistic regime. However, there is a fundamental\nlimit on the maximum attainable ion energy, which is determined by the group\nvelocity of the laser. The tightly focused laser pulses have group velocities\nsmaller than the vacuum light speed, and, since they offer the high intensity\nneeded for the RPA regime, it is plausible that group velocity effects would\nmanifest themselves in the experiments involving tightly focused pulses and\nthin foils. However, in this case, finite spot size effects are important, and\nanother limiting factor, the transverse expansion of the target, may dominate\nover the group velocity effect. As the laser pulse diffracts after passing the\nfocus, the target expands accordingly due to the transverse intensity profile\nof the laser. Due to this expansion, the areal density of the target decreases,\nmaking it transparent for radiation and effectively terminating the\nacceleration. The off-normal incidence of the laser on the target, due either\nto the experimental setup, or to the deformation of the target, will also lead\nto establishing a limit on maximum ion energy.\n", "  The remnants of core-collapse supernovae (SNe) have complex morphologies that\nmay reflect asymmetries and structures developed during the progenitor SN\nexplosion. Here we investigate how the morphology of the SNR Cassiopeia A (Cas\nA) reflects the characteristics of the progenitor SN with the aim to derive the\nenergies and masses of the post-explosion anisotropies responsible for the\nobserved spatial distribution of Fe and Si/S. We model the evolution of Cas A\nfrom the immediate aftermath of the progenitor SN to the three-dimensional\ninteraction of the remnant with the surrounding medium. The post-explosion\nstructure of the ejecta is described by small-scale clumping of material and\nlarger-scale anisotropies. The hydrodynamic multi-species simulations consider\nan appropriate post-explosion isotopic composition of the ejecta. The observed\naverage expansion rate and shock velocities can be well reproduced by models\nwith ejecta mass $M_{\\rm ej}\\approx 4M_{\\odot}$ and explosion energy $E_{\\rm\nSN}\\approx 2.3\\times 10^{51}$ erg. The post-explosion anisotropies (pistons)\nreproduce the observed distributions of Fe and Si/S if they had a total mass of\n$\\approx 0.25\\,M_{\\odot}$ and a total kinetic energy of $\\approx 1.5\\times\n10^{50}$ erg. The pistons produce a spatial inversion of ejecta layers at the\nepoch of Cas A, leading to the Si/S-rich ejecta physically interior to the\nFe-rich ejecta. The pistons are also responsible for the development of bright\nrings of Si/S-rich material which form at the intersection between the reverse\nshock and the material accumulated around the pistons during their propagation.\nOur result supports the idea that the bulk of asymmetries observed in Cas A are\nintrinsic to the explosion.\n", "  We combine traction force data with Bayesian inversion to obtain an absolute\nestimate of the internal stress field of a cell monolayer. The method, Bayesian\ninversion stress microscopy (BISM), is validated using numerical simulations\nperformed in a wide range of conditions. It is robust to changes in each\ningredient of the underlying statistical model. Importantly, its accuracy does\nnot depend on the rheology of the tissue. We apply BISM to experimental\ntraction force data measured in a narrow ring of cohesive epithelial cells, and\ncheck that the inferred stress field coincides with that obtained by direct\nspatial integration of the traction force data in this quasi-one-dimensional\ngeometry.\n", "  Well--defined criteria are proposed for assessing the accuracy of quantum\nmaster equations whose memory functions are approximated by Pad\\'e resummation\nof the first two moments in the electronic coupling. These criteria partition\nthe parameter space into distinct levels of expected accuracy, ranging from\nquantitatively accurate regimes to regions of parameter space where the\napproach is not expected to be applicable. Extensive comparison of\nPad\\'e--resummed master equations with numerically exact results in the context\nof the spin--boson model demonstrate that the proposed criteria correctly\ndemarcate the regions of parameter space where the Pad\\'e approximation is\nreliable. The applicability analysis we present is not confined to the\nspecifics of the Hamiltonian under consideration and should provide guidelines\nfor other classes of resummation techniques.\n", "  A giant planet creates a gap in a protoplanetary disk, which might explain\nthe observed gaps in protoplanetary disks. The width and depth of the gaps\ndepend on the planet mass and disk properties. We have performed\ntwo--dimensional hydrodynamic simulations for various planet masses, disk\naspect ratios and viscosities, to obtain an empirical formula for the gap\nwidth. The gap width is proportional to the square root of the planet mass,\n-3/4 power of the disk aspect ratio and -1/4 power of the viscosity. This\nempirical formula enables us to estimate the mass of a planet embedded in the\ndisk from the width of an observed gap. We have applied the empirical formula\nfor the gap width to the disk around HL~Tau, assuming that each gap observed by\nALMA observations is produced by planets, and discussed the planet masses\nwithin the gaps. The estimate of planet masses from the gap widths is less\naffected by the observational resolution and dust filtration than that from the\ngap depth.\n", "  During its 2005 outburst, GRO J1655-40 was observed at high spectral\nresolution with the Chandra HETGS, revealing a spectrum rich with blueshifted\nabsorption lines indicative of an accretion disk wind -- apparently too hot,\ntoo dense, and too close to the black hole to be driven by radiation pressure\nor thermal pressure (Miller et al.). But this exotic wind represents just one\npiece of the puzzle in this outburst, as its presence coincides with an\nextremely soft and curved X-ray continuum spectrum, remarkable X-ray\nvariability (Uttley & Klein-Wolt), and a bright, unexpected optical/infrared\nblackbody component that varies on the orbital period. Focusing on the X-ray\ncontinuum and the optical/infrared/UV spectral energy distribution, we argue\nthat the unusual features of this \"hypersoft state\" are natural consequences of\na super-Eddington Compton-thick wind from the disk: the optical/infrared\nblackbody represents the cool photosphere of a dense, extended outflow, while\nthe X-ray emission is explained as Compton scattering by the relatively cool,\noptically thick wind. This wind obscures the intrinsic luminosity of the inner\ndisk, which we suggest may have been at or above the Eddington limit.\n", "  Asymptotic reductions of a defocusing nonlocal nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nmodel in $(3+1)$-dimensions, in both Cartesian and cylindrical geometry, are\npresented. First, at an intermediate stage, a Boussinesq equation is derived,\nand then its far-field, in the form of a variety of Kadomtsev-Petviashvilli\n(KP) equations for right- and left-going waves, is found. KP models include\nversions of the KP-I and KP-II equations, in Cartesian and cylindrical\ngeometry. Solitary waves solutions, planar or ring-shaped, and of dark or\nanti-dark type, are also predicted to occur. Their nature and stability is\ndetermined by a parameter defined by the physical parameters of the original\nnonlocal system. It is thus found that (dark) anti-dark solitary waves are only\nsupported by a weak (strong) nonlocality, and are unstable (stable) in\nhigher-dimensions. Our analytical predictions are corroborated by direct\nnumerical simulations.\n", "  It is shown that two physical phenomena are important for high excitations:\n(i) the screening of the universal gluon-exchange potential and (ii) the\nflattening of the confining potential owing to creation of quark loops, and\nboth effects are determined quantitatively. Taking the first effect into\naccount, we predict the masses of the ground states with $l=0,1,2$ in agreement\nwith experiment. The flattening effect ensures the observed linear behaviour of\nthe radial Regge trajectories $M^2(n)=m_0^2 + n_r \\mu^2$ GeV$^2$, where the\nslope $\\mu^2$ is very sensitive to the parameter $\\gamma$, which determines the\nweakening of the string tension $\\sigma(r)$ at large distances. For the\n$\\rho$-trajectory the linear behaviour starts with $n_r=1$ and the values\n$\\mu^2=1.40(2)$~GeV$^2$ for $\\gamma=0.40$ and $\\mu^2=1.34(1)$~GeV$^2$ for\n$\\gamma=0.45$ are obtained. For the excited states the leptonic widths:\n$\\Gamma_{\\rm ee}(\\rho(775))=7.0(3)$~keV, $\\Gamma_{\\rm\nee}(\\rho(1450))=1.7(1)$~keV, $\\Gamma_{\\rm ee}(\\rho(1900))=1.0(1)$~keV,\n$\\Gamma_{\\rm ee}(\\rho(2150))=0.7(1)$~keV, and $\\Gamma_{\\rm\nee}(1\\,{}^3D_1)=0.26(5)$~keV are calculated, if these states are considered as\npurely $q\\bar q$ states. The width $\\Gamma_{\\rm ee}(\\rho(1700))$ increases if\n$\\rho(1700)$ is mixed with the $2\\,{}^3S_1$ state, giving for a mixing angle\n$\\theta=21^\\circ$ almost equal widths: $\\Gamma_{\\rm\nee}(\\rho(1700))=0.75(6)$~keV and $\\Gamma_{\\rm ee}(1450)=1.0(1)$~keV.\n", "  Problems of interest in hydrogeology and hydrocarbon resources involve\ncomplex heterogeneous geological formations. Such domains are most accurately\nrepresented in reservoir simulations by unstructured computational grids.\nFinite element methods accurately describe flow on unstructured meshes with\ncomplex geometries, and their flexible formulation allows implementation on\ndifferent grid types. In this work, we consider for the first time the\nchallenging problem of fully compositional three-phase flow in 3D unstructured\ngrids, discretized by any combination of tetrahedra, prisms, and hexahedra. We\nemploy a mass conserving mixed hybrid finite element (MHFE) method to solve for\nthe pressure and flux fields. The transport equations are approximated with a\nhigher-order vertex-based discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretization. We show\nthat this approach outperforms a face-based implementation of the same\npolynomial order. These methods are well suited for heterogeneous and fractured\nreservoirs, because they provide globally continuous pressure and flux fields,\nwhile allowing for sharp discontinuities in compositions and saturations. The\nhigher-order accuracy improves the modeling of strongly non-linear flow, such\nas gravitational and viscous fingering. We review the literature on\nunstructured reservoir simulation models, and present many examples that\nconsider gravity depletion, water flooding, and gas injection in oil saturated\nreservoirs. We study convergence rates, mesh sensitivity, and demonstrate the\nwide applicability of our chosen finite element methods for challenging\nmultiphase flow problems in geometrically complex subsurface media.\n", "  Knowledge of exact properties of the exchange-correlation (xc) functional is\nimportant for improving the approximations made within density functional\ntheory. Features such as steps in the exact xc potential are known to be\nnecessary for yielding accurate densities, yet little is understood regarding\ntheir shape, magnitude and location. We use systems of a few electrons, where\nthe exact electron density is known, to demonstrate general properties of\nsteps. We find that steps occur at points in the electron density where there\nis a change in the `local effective ionization energy' of the electrons. We\nprovide practical arguments, based on the electron density, for determining the\nposition, shape and height of steps for ground-state systems, and extend the\nconcepts to time-dependent systems. These arguments are intended to inform the\ndevelopment of approximate functionals, such as the mixed localization\npotential (MLP), which already demonstrate their capability to produce steps in\nthe Kohn-Sham potential.\n", "  We derive the fraction of substructure in the Galactic halo using a sample of\nover 10,000 spectroscopically-confirmed halo giant stars from the LAMOST\nspectroscopic survey. By observing 100 synthetic models along each line of\nsight with the LAMOST selection function in that sky area, we statistically\ncharacterize the expected halo populations. We define as SHARDS (Stellar Halo\nAccretion Related Debris Structures) any stars in >3-sigma excesses above the\nmodel predictions. We find that at least 10% of the Milky Way halo stars from\nLAMOST are part of SHARDS. By running our algorithm on smooth halos observed\nwith the LAMOST selection function, we show that the LAMOST data contain excess\nsubstructure over all Galactocentric radii R_GC < 40 kpc, beyond what is\nexpected due to statistical fluctuations and incomplete sampling of a smooth\nhalo. The level of substructure is consistent with the fraction of stars in\nSHARDS in model halos created entirely from accreted satellites. This work\nillustrates the potential of vast spectroscopic surveys with high filling\nfactors over large sky areas to recreate the merging history of the Milky Way.\n", "  We study the excitonic coupling and homogeneous spectral line width of brick\nlayer J-aggregate films. We begin by analysing the structural information\nrevealed by the two-exciton states probed in two-dimensional spectra. Our first\nmain result is that the relation between the excitonic couplings and the\nspectral shift in a two-dimensional structure is different (larger shift for\nthe same nearest neighbour coupling) from that in a one-dimensional structure,\nwhich leads to an estimation of dipolar coupling in two-dimensional lattices.\nWe next investigate the mechanisms of homogeneous broadening - population\nrelaxation and pure dephasing - and evaluate their relative importance in\nlinear and two-dimensional aggregates. Our second main result is that pure\ndephasing dominates the line width in two-dimensional systems up to a crossover\ntemperature, which explains the linear temperature dependence of the\nhomogeneous line width. This is directly related to the decreased density of\nstates at the band edge when compared with linear aggregates, thus reducing the\ncontribution of population relaxation to dephasing. Pump-probe experiments are\nsuggested to directly measure the lifetime of the bright state and can\ntherefore support the proposed model.\n", "  Dust grains with sizes around (sub)mm are expected to couple only weakly to\nthe gas motion in regions beyond 10 au of circumstellar disks. In this work, we\ninvestigate the influence of the spatial distribution of such grains on the\n(sub)mm appearance of magnetized protoplanetary disks. We perform non-ideal\nglobal 3D magneto-hydrodynamic stratified disk simulations including particles\nof different sizes (50 micron to 1 cm), using a Lagrangian particle solver. We\ncalculate the spatial dust temperature distribution, including the dynamically\ncoupled submicron-sized dust grains, and derive ideal continuum re-emission\nmaps of the disk through radiative transfer simulations. Finally, we\ninvestigate the feasibility to observe specific structures in the thermal\nre-emission maps with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA).\nThe pressure bump close to the outer edge of the dead-zone leads to particle\ntrapping in ring structures. More specifically, vortices in the disk\nconcentrate the dust and create an inhomogeneous distribution of the solid\nmaterial in the azimuthal direction. The large-scale disk perturbations are\npreserved in the (sub)mm re-emission maps. The observable structures are very\nsimilar to those expected to result from planet-disk interaction. The larger\ndust particles increase the brightness contrast between gap and ring\nstructures. We find that rings, gaps and the dust accumulation in the vortex\ncould be traced with ALMA down to a scale of a few astronomical units in\ncircumstellar disks located in nearby star-forming regions. Finally, we present\na brief comparison of these structures with those recently found with ALMA in\nthe young circumstellar disks of HL Tau and Oph IRS 48.\n", "  We consider the holographic duality where the CFT side is given by $SU(N)$\nadjoint free scalar field theory. Compared to the vector models, the set of\nsingle trace operators is immensely extended so that the corresponding AdS\ntheory also contains infinitely many massive higher spin fields on top of the\nmassless ones. We compute the one-loop vacuum energy of these AdS fields to\ntest this duality at the subleading order in large $N$ expansion. The\ndetermination of the bulk vacuum energy requires a proper scheme to sum up the\ninfinitely many contributions. For that, we develop a new method and apply it\nfirst to calculate the vacuum energies for the first few `Regge trajectories'\nin AdS$_4$ and AdS$_5$. In considering the full vacuum energy of AdS theory\ndual to a matrix model CFT, we find that there exist more than one available\nprescriptions for the one-loop vacuum energy. Taking a particular prescription,\nwe determine the full vacuum energy of the AdS$_5$ theory, whereas the AdS$_4$\ncalculation still remains technically prohibitive. This result shows that the\nfull vacuum energy of the AdS$_5$ theory coincides with minus of the free\nenergy of a single scalar field on the boundary. This is analogous to the\n$O(N)$ vector model case, hence suggests an interpretation of the\n\\emph{positive} shift of the bulk coupling constant, i.e. from $N^2-1$ to\n$N^2$.\n", "  A recent discovery of two stellar clusters associated with the diffuse\nhigh-latitude cloud HRK 81.4-77.8 has important implications for star formation\nin the Galactic halo. We derive a plausible distance estimate to HRK 81.4-77.8\nprimarily from its gaseous properties. We spatially correlate state-of-the-art\nHI, far-infrared and soft X-ray data to analyze the diffuse gas in the cloud.\nThe absorption of the soft X-ray emission from the Galactic halo by HRK\n81.4-77.8 is used to constrain the distance to the cloud. HRK 81.4-77.8 is most\nlikely located at an altitude of about 400 pc within the disk-halo interface of\nthe Milky Way Galaxy. The HI data discloses a disbalance in density and\npressure between the warm and cold gaseous phases. Apparently, the cold gas is\ncompressed by the warm medium. This disbalance might trigger the formation of\nmolecular gas high above the Galactic plane on pc to sub-pc scales.\n", "  The subsequent coalescence of low--mass halos over cosmic time is thought to\nbe the major formation channel of massive spiral galaxies like the Milky Way\nand the Andromeda Galaxy (M31). The gaseous halo of a massive galaxy is\nconsidered to be the reservoir of baryonic matter persistently fueling the star\nformation in the disk. Because of its proximity, M31 is the ideal object for\nstudying the structure of the halo gas in great detail. Using the latest\nneutral atomic hydrogen (HI) data of the Effelsberg-Bonn HI Survey (EBHIS)\nallows comprising a comprehensive inventory of gas associated with M31. The\nprimary aim is to differentiate between physical structures belonging to the\nMilky Way Galaxy and M31 and accordingly to test the presence of a M31 neutral\ngaseous halo. Analyzing the spatially fully sampled EBHIS data makes it\nfeasible to trace coherent HI structures in space and radial velocity. To\ndisentangle Milky Way and M31 HI emission we use a new approach, along with the\ntraditional path of setting an upper radial velocity limit, by calculating a\ndifference second moment map. We argue that M31's disk is physically connected\nto an asymmetric HI halo of tens of kpc size, the M31 cloud. We confirm the\npresence of a coherent low-velocity HI filament located in between M31 and M33\naligned at the sky with the clouds at systemic velocity. The physical\nparameters of the HI filament are comparable to those of the HI clouds at\nsystemic velocity. We also detected an irregularly shaped HI cloud that is is\npositionally located close to but offset from the stellar body of And XIX.\n", "  A conserved generalized zero range process is considered in which two sites\ninteract such that particles hop from the more populated site to the other with\na probability $p$. The steady state particle distribution function $P(n)$ is\nobtained using both analytical and numerical methods. The system goes through\nseveral phases as $p$ is varied. In particular, a condensate phase appears for\n$p_l < p < p_c$, where the bounding values depend on the range of interaction,\nwith $p_c < 0.5$ in general. Analysis of $P(n)$ in the condensate phase using a\nknown scaling form shows there is universal behaviour in the short range\nprocess while the infinite range process displays non-universality. In the\nnon-condensate phase above $p_c$, two distinct regions are identified: $p_c < p\n\\leq 0.5$ and $p> 0.5$; a scale emerges in the system in the latter and this\nfeature is present for all ranges of interaction.\n", "  The Large Early Galaxy Census (LEGA-C) is a Public Spectroscopic Survey of\n$\\sim3200$ $K$-band selected galaxies at redshifts $z=0.6-1.0$ with stellar\nmasses M_star > 1e10M_sun, conducted with VIMOS on ESO's Very Large Telescope.\nThe survey is embedded in the COSMOS field ($R.A. = 10h00$; $Dec.=+2\\deg$). The\n20-hour long integrations produce high-$S/N$ continuum spectra that reveal\nages, metallicities and velocity dispersions of the stellar populations.\nLEGA-C's unique combination of sample size and depth will enable us for the\nfirst time to map the stellar content at large look-back time, across galaxies\nof different types and star-formation activity. Observations started in\nDecember 2014 and are planned to be completed by mid 2018, with early data\nreleases of the spectra and value-added products. In this paper we present the\nscience case, the observing strategy, an overview of the data reduction process\nand data products, and a first look at the relationship between galaxy\nstructure and spectral properties, as it existed 7 Gyr ago.\n", "  Electromagnetically-induced-transparency (EIT) cooling is a ground-state\ncooling technique for trapped particles. EIT offers a broader cooling range in\nfrequency space compared to more established methods. In this work, we\nexperimentally investigate EIT cooling in strings of trapped atomic ions. In\nstrings of up to 18 ions, we demonstrate simultaneous ground state cooling of\nall radial modes in under 1 ms. This is a particularly important capability in\nview of emerging quantum simulation experiments with large numbers of trapped\nions. Our analysis of the EIT cooling dynamics is based on a novel technique\nenabling single-shot measurements of phonon numbers, by rapid adiabatic passage\non a vibrational sideband of a narrow transition.\n", "  Optical parametric amplification/oscillation provide a powerful tool for\ncoherent light generation in spectral regions inaccessible to lasers.\nParametric gain is based on a frequency {\\it down-conversion} process, and thus\nit can not be realized for signal waves at a frequency $\\omega_3$ {\\it higher}\nthan the frequency of the pump wave $\\omega_1$. In this work we suggest a route\ntoward the realization of {\\it up-conversion} optical parametric amplification\nand oscillation, i.e. amplification of the signal wave by a coherent pump wave\nof lower frequency, assisted by stimulated emission of the auxiliary idler\nwave. When the signal field is resonated in an optical cavity, parametric\noscillation is obtained. Design parameters for the observation of up-conversion\noptical parametric oscillation at $\\lambda_3=465$ nm are given for a\nperiodically-poled lithium-niobate (PPLN) crystal doped with Nd$^{3+}$ ions.\n", "  Topological triangulations of orientable and non-orientable surfaces with\narbitrary genus have important applications in quantum geometry, graph theory\nand statistical physics. However, until now only the asymptotics for 2-spheres\nare known analytically, and exact counts of triangulations are only available\nfor both small genus and small triangulations. We apply the Wang-Landau\nalgorithm to calculate the number $N(m,h)$ of triangulations for several order\nof magnitudes in system size $m$ and genus $h$. We verify that the limit of the\nentropy density of triangulations is independent of genus and orientability and\nare able to determine the next-to-leading and the next-to-next-to-leading order\nterms. We conjecture for the number of surface triangulations the asymptotic\nbehavior \\begin{equation*} N(m,h) \\rightarrow (170.4 \\pm 15.1)^h m^{-2(h -\n1)/5} \\left( \\frac{256}{27} \\right)^{m / 2}\\;, \\end{equation*} what might guide\na mathematicians proof for the exact asymptotics.\n", "  Low-mass, variable, high-velocity stars are interesting study cases for many\naspects of Galactic structure and evolution. Until recently, the only known\nhigh- or hyper-velocity stars were young stars thought to originate from the\nGalactic centre. Wide-area surveys like APOGEE and BRAVA have found several\nlow-mass stars in the bulge with Galactic rest-frame velocities larger than 350\nkm/s. In this study we present the first abundance analysis of a low-mass, RR\nLyrae star, located close to the Galactic bulge, with a space motion of ~ -400\nkm/s. Using medium-resolution spectra, we derive abundances (including upper\nlimits) of 11 elements. These allow us to chemically tag the star and discuss\nits origin, although our derived abundances and metallicity, at [Fe/H] =-0.9\ndex, do not point toward one unambiguous answer. Based on the chemical tagging,\nwe cannot exclude that it originated in the bulge. However, combining its\nretrograde orbit and the derived abundances suggests that the star was\naccelerated from the outskirts of the inner (or even outer) halo during\nmany-body interactions. Other possible origins include the bulge itself, or the\nstar could be stripped from a star cluster or the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy when\nit merged with the Milky Way.\n", "  With current space-based missions it is now possible to obtain age-sensitive\nasteroseismic information for tens of thousands of red giants. This provides a\npromising opportunity to study the Galactic structure and evolution. We use\nasteroseismic data of red giants, observed by Kepler, to test the current\ntheoretical framework of modelling the Galaxy based on population synthesis\nmodeling and the use of asteroseismic scaling relations for giants. We use the\nopen source code Galaxia to model the Milky Way and find the distribution of\nthe masses predicted by Galaxia to be systematically offset with respect to the\nseismically-inferred observed masses. The Galactic model overestimates the\nnumber of low mass stars, and these stars are predominantly old and of low\nmetallicity. Using corrections to the $\\Delta \\nu$ scaling relation suggested\nby stellar models (available for download) significantly reduces the\ndisagreement between predicted and observed masses. For a few cases where\nnon-seismic mass estimates are available, the corrections to $\\Delta \\nu$ also\nimprove the agreement between seismic and non-seismic mass estimates. The\ndisagreement between predictions of the Galactic model and the observations is\nmost pronounced for stars with ${\\rm [Fe/H]}<-0.5$ and ${\\rm [Fe/H]}>0$ or for\n$T_{\\rm eff}>4700$ K. Altering the star formation rate in order to suppress\nstars older than 10 Gyr improves the agreement for mass but leads to\ninconsistent color distributions. We also tested the predictions of the\nTRILEGAL Galactic model. However, unlike {\\sl Galaxia}, it had difficulties in\nreproducing the photometric properties of the Kepler Input Catalog because it\noverestimates the number of blue stars. We conclude that either the scaling\nrelations and/or the Galactic models need to be revised to reconcile\npredictions of theory with asteroseismic observations.\n", "  This work uses an information-based methodology to infer the connectivity of\ncomplex systems from observed time-series data. We first derive analytically an\nexpression for the Mutual Information Rate (MIR), namely, the amount of\ninformation exchanged per unit of time, that can be used to estimate the MIR\nbetween two finite-length low-resolution noisy time-series, and then apply it\nafter a proper normalization for the identification of the connectivity\nstructure of small networks of interacting dynamical systems. In particular, we\nshow that our methodology successfully infers the connectivity for\nheterogeneous networks, different time-series lengths or coupling strengths,\nand even in the presence of additive noise. Finally, we show that our\nmethodology based on MIR successfully infers the connectivity of networks\ncomposed of nodes with different time-scale dynamics, where inference based on\nMutual Information fails.\n", "  Bombardment of a solid surface with a broad, obliquely-incident ion beam\nfrequently produces nanoscale surface ripples. The primary obstacle that\nprevents the adoption of ion bombardment as a nano-fabrication tool is the high\ndensity of defects in the patterns that are typically formed. Our simulations\nindicate that ion bombardment can produce nearly defect free ripples on the\nsurface of an elemental solid if the sample is concurrently and periodically\nrocked about an axis orthogonal to the surface normal and the incident beam\ndirection. We also investigate the conditions necessary for rocking to produce\nhighly ordered ripples and discuss how the results of our simulations can be\nreproduced experimentally.\n", "  Recently, a class of non-truncated radially-anisotropic models (the so-called\n$f^{(\\nu)}$-models), originally constructed in the context of violent\nrelaxation and modeling of elliptical galaxies, has been found to possess\ninteresting qualities in relation to observed and simulated globular clusters.\nIn view of new applications to globular clusters, we improve this class of\nmodels along two directions. To make them more suitable for the description of\nsmall stellar systems hosted by galaxies, we introduce a 'tidal' truncation (by\nmeans of a procedure that guarantees full continuity of the distribution\nfunction). The new $f_T^{(\\nu)}$-models are shown to provide a better fit to\nthe observed photometric and spectroscopic profiles for a sample of 13 globular\nclusters studied earlier by means of non-truncated models; interestingly, the\nbest-fit models also perform better with respect to the radial-orbit\ninstability. Then we design a flexible but simple two-component family of\ntruncated models, to study the separate issues of mass segregation and of\nmultiple populations. We do not aim at a fully realistic description of\nglobular clusters, to compete with the description currently obtained by means\nof dedicated simulations. The goal here is to try to identify the simplest\nmodels, that is, those with the smallest number of free parameters, but still\nable to provide a reasonable description for clusters that are evidently beyond\nthe reach of one-component models: with this tool we aim at identifying the key\nfactors that characterize mass segregation or the presence of multiple\npopulations. To reduce the relevant parameter space, we formulate a few\nphysical arguments (based on recent observations and simulations). A first\napplication to two well-studied globular clusters is briefly described and\ndiscussed.\n", "  Optical isolators are an important building block in photonic computation and\ncommunication. In traditional optics, isolators are realized with\nmagneto-optical garnets. However, it remains challenging to incorporate such\nmaterials on an integrated platform because of the difficulty in material\ngrowth and bulky device footprint. Here, we propose an ultracompact integrated\nisolator by exploiting graphene's magneto-optical property on a\nsilicon-on-insulator platform. The photonic nonreciprocity is achieved because\nthe cyclotrons in graphene experiencing different optical spin exhibit\ndifferent response to counterpropagating light. Taking advantage of cavity\nresonance effects, we have numerically optimized a device design, which shows\nexcellent isolation performance with the extinction ratio over 45 dB and the\ninsertion loss around 12 dB at a wavelength near 1.55 um. Featuring graphene's\nCMOS compatibility and substantially reduced device footprint, our proposal\nsheds light to monolithic integration of nonreciprocal photonic devices.\n", "  What is the turbulent drag force experienced by an object moving in a\nrotating fluid? This open and fundamental question can be addressed by\nmeasuring the torque needed to drive an impeller at constant angular velocity\n$\\omega$ in a water tank mounted on a platform rotating at a rate $\\Omega$. We\nreport a dramatic reduction in drag as $\\Omega$ increases, down to values as\nlow as $12$\\% of the non-rotating drag. At small Rossby number $Ro =\n\\omega/\\Omega$, the decrease in drag coefficient $K$ follows the approximate\nscaling law $K \\sim Ro$, which is predicted in the framework of nonlinear\ninertial wave interactions and weak-turbulence theory. However, stereoscopic\nparticle image velocimetry measurements indicate that this drag reduction\nrather originates from a weakening of the turbulence intensity in line with the\ntwo-dimensionalization of the large-scale flow.\n", "  The detection of the first gravitational wave (GW) transient GW150914\nprompted an extensive campaign of follow-up observations at all wavelengths.\nAlthough no dedicated XMM-Newton observations have been performed, the\nsatellite passed through the GW150914 error box during normal operations. Here\nwe report the analysis of the data taken during these satellite slews performed\ntwo hours and two weeks after the GW event. Our data cover 1.1 square degrees\nand 4.8 square degrees of the final GW localization region. No credible X-ray\ncounterpart to GW150914 is found down to a sensitivity of 6E-13 erg/cm2/s in\nthe 0.2-2 keV band. Nevertheless, these observations show the great potential\nof XMM-Newton slew observations for the search of the electromagnetic\ncounterparts of GW events. A series of adjacent slews performed in response to\na GW trigger would take <1.5 days to cover most of the typical GW credible\nregion. We discuss this scenario and its prospects for detecting the X-ray\ncounterpart of future GW detections.\n", "  Planetary nebulae (PNe) are expected to have a ~10$^{5}$ K interface layer\nbetween the $\\geq$10$^{6}$ K inner hot bubble and the ~10$^{4}$ K optical\nnebular shell. The PN structure and evolution, and the X-ray emission depend\ncritically on the efficiency of mixing of material at this interface layer.\nHowever, neither its location nor its spatial extent has ever been determined\nso far. Using high-spatial resolution HST STIS spectroscopic observations of\nthe N V 1239,1243 lines in the Cat's Eye Nebula (NGC 6543), we have detected\nthis interface layer and determined its location, extent, and physical\nproperties for the first time in a PN. We confirm that this interface layer, as\nrevealed by the spatial distribution of the N V 1239 line emission, is located\nbetween the hot bubble and the optical nebular shell. We estimate a thickness\nof 1.5$\\times$10$^{16}$ cm and an electron density of ~200 cm$^{-3}$ for the\nmixing layer. With a thermal pressure of ~2$\\times$10$^{-8}$ dyn cm$^{-2}$, the\nmixing layer is in pressure equilibrium with the hot bubble and ionized nebular\nrim of NGC 6543.\n", "  In the framework of the generalized uncertainty principle, the position and\nmomentum operators obey the modified commutation relation\n$[X,P]=i\\hbar\\left(1+\\beta P^2\\right)$ where $\\beta$ is the deformation\nparameter. Since the validity of the uncertainty relation for the Shannon\nentropies proposed by Beckner, Bialynicki-Birula, and Mycieslki (BBM) depends\non both the algebra and the used representation, we show that using the\nformally self-adjoint representation, i.e., $X=x$ and\n$P=\\tan\\left(\\sqrt{\\beta}p\\right)/\\sqrt{\\beta}$ where $[x,p]=i\\hbar$, the BBM\ninequality is still valid in the form $S_x+S_p\\geq1+\\ln\\pi$ as well as in\nordinary quantum mechanics. We explicitly indicate this result for the harmonic\noscillator in the presence of the minimal length.\n", "  We consider light dynamics in a circular multicore fiber with balanced gain\nand loss core distribution, and show that transition from unbroken to broken\n$\\mathcal{PT}$ phases can be conveniently controlled by geometric twist of the\nfiber. The twist introduces Peierls' phases in the coupling constants and thus\nacts as an artificial gauge field. As an application, we discuss twist-induced\ntuning of optical transmission in a six-core fiber with one lossy core.\n", "  We have designed and built a modern versatile research-grade instrument for\nultrasound pulse-echo probing of the elastic properties of a wide range of\nmaterials under laboratory conditions. The heart of the instrument lies in an\nAD8302 microchip: a gain and phase detector from Analog Devices, Inc. To\nconstruct the device, we have implemented a schematic that utilizes the\nhomodyne principle for signal processing instead of the traditional\nsuperheterodyne approach. This design allows one to measure phase shifts with\nhigh precision and linearity over the entire range of $0-360^\\circ$. The system\nis simple in construction and usage; it makes ultrasound measurements easily\naccessible to a broad range of researchers. It was tested by measuring the\ntemperature dependence of the ultrasound speed and attenuation in a\nKTa$_{0.92}$Nb$_{0.08}$O$_{3}$ (KTN) single crystal at a frequency of $\\sim$ 40\nMHz. The tests were performed in the vicinity of the ferroelectric transitions\nwhere the large variations of the speed and attenuation demand a detector with\noutstanding characteristics. The described detector has a wide dynamic range\nand allows for measuring in a single run over the whole temperature range of\nthe ferroelectric transitions, rather than just in limited intervals available\npreviously. Moreover, due to the wide dynamic range of the gain measurements\nand high sensitivity this instrument was able to reveal previously unresolvable\nfeatures associated with the development of the ferroelectric transitions of\nKTN crystals.\n", "  A theoretical method for the estimation of cross sections and rates for\nexcitation and charge transfer processes in low-energy hydrogen atom collisions\nwith neutral atoms, based on an asymptotic two-electron model of ionic-covalent\ninteractions in the neutral atom-hydrogen atom system, is presented. The\ncalculation of potentials and non-adiabatic radial couplings using the method\nis demonstrated. The potentials are used together with the multi-channel\nLandau-Zener model to calculate cross sections and rate coefficients. The main\nfeature of the method is that it employs asymptotically exact atomic\nwavefunctions, which can be determined from known atomic parameters. The method\nis applied to Li+H, Na+H, and Mg+H collisions, and the results compare well\nwith existing detailed full-quantum calculations. The method is applied to the\nastrophysically important problem of Ca+H collisions, and rate coefficients are\ncalculated for temperatures in the range 1000-20000 K.\n", "  We present thermoelectric power and resistivity measurements in the\nferromagnet UGe$_2$ as a function of temperature and magnetic field. At low\ntemperature, huge quantum oscillations are observed in the thermoelectric power\nas a function of the magnetic field applied along the $a$ axis. The frequencies\nof the extreme orbits are determined and an analysis of the cyclotron masses is\nperformed following different theoretical approaches for quantum oscillations\ndetected in the thermoelectric power. They are compared to those obtained by\nShubnikov-de Haas experiments on the same crystal and previous de Haas-van\nAlphen experiments. The agreement of the different probes confirms\nthermoelectric power as an excellent probe to extract simultaneously both\nmicroscopic and macroscopic information on the Fermi-surface properties.\nBand-structure calculations of UGe$_2$ in the ferromagnetic state are compared\nto the experiment.\n", "  We study stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) and stimulated Raman\nscattering (SRS) in shock ignition by comparing fluid and PIC simulations.\nUnder typical parameters for the OMEGA experiments [Theobald \\emph{et al}.,\nPhys. Plasmas \\textbf{19}, 102706 (2012)], a series of 1D fluid simulations\nwith laser intensities ranging between 2$\\times$10$^{15}$ and\n2$\\times$10$^{16}$ W/cm$^2$ finds that SBS is the dominant instability, which\nincreases significantly with the incident intensity. Strong pump depletion\ncaused by SBS and SRS limits the transmitted intensity at the 0.17n$_c$ to be\nless than 3.5$\\times$10$^{15}$ W/cm$^2$. The PIC simulations show similar\nphysics but with higher saturation levels for SBS and SRS convective modes and\nstronger pump depletion due to higher seed levels for the electromagnetic\nfields in PIC codes. Plasma flow profiles are found to be important in proper\nmodeling of SBS and limiting its reflectivity in both the fluid and PIC\nsimulations.\n", "  We investigate the prospects for the capture of the proposed Planet 9 from\nother stars in the Sun's birth cluster. Any capture scenario must satisfy three\nconditions: the encounter must be more distant than ~150 au to avoid perturbing\nthe Kuiper belt; the other star must have a wide-orbit planet (a>~100au); the\nplanet must be captured onto an appropriate orbit to sculpt the orbital\ndistribution of wide-orbit Solar System bodies. Here we use N-body simulations\nto show that these criteria may be simultaneously satisfied. In a few percent\nof slow close encounters in a cluster, bodies are captured onto heliocentric,\nPlanet 9-like orbits. During the ~100 Myr cluster phase, many stars are likely\nto host planets on highly-eccentric orbits with apastron distances beyond 100\nau if Neptune-sized planets are common and susceptible to planet--planet\nscattering. While the existence of Planet 9 remains unproven, we consider\ncapture from one of the Sun's young brethren a plausible route to explain such\nan object's orbit. Capture appears to predict a large population of\nTrans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) whose orbits are aligned with the captured\nplanet, and we propose that different formation mechanisms will be\ndistinguishable based on their imprint on the distribution of TNOs.\n", "  We study motion of charged particles in the field of a rotating black hole\nimmersed into an external asymptotically uniform magnetic field, focusing on\nthe epicyclic quasi-circular orbits near the equatorial plane. Separating the\ncircular orbits into four qualitatively different classes according to the sign\nof the canonical angular momentum of the motion and the orientation of the\nLorentz force, we analyse the circular orbits using the so called force\nformalism. We find the analytical solutions for the radial profiles of\nvelocity, specific angular momentum and specific energy of the circular orbits\nin dependence on the black hole dimensionless spin and the magnetic field\nstrength. The innermost stable circular orbits are determined for all four\nclasses of the circular orbits. The stable circular orbits with outward\noriented Lorentz force can extend to radii lower than the radius of the\ncorresponding photon circular geodesic. We calculate the frequencies of the\nharmonic oscillatory motion of the charged particles in the radial and vertical\ndirections related to the equatorial circular orbits and study the radial\nprofiles of the radial, $\\omega_\\mir$, vertical, $\\omega_\\mit$, and orbital,\n$\\omega_\\mip$, frequencies, finding significant differences in comparison to\nthe epicyclic geodesic circular motion. The most important new phenomenon is\nexistence of toroidal charged particle epicyclic motion with $\\omega_\\mir \\sim\n\\omega_{\\mit} >> \\omega_{\\mip}$ that could occur around retrograde circular\norbits with outward oriented Lorentz force. We demonstrate that for the rapidly\nrotating black holes the role of the 'Wald induced charge' can be relevant.\n", "  Using a successful framework for describing S-wave hadronic decays of light\nhyperons induced by a subprocess $s \\to u (\\bar u d)$, we presented recently a\nmodel-independent calculation of the amplitude and branching ratio for $\\Xi^-_b\n\\to \\Lambda_b \\pi^-$ in agreement with a LHCb measurement. The same quark\nprocess contributes to $\\Xi^0_c \\to \\Lambda_c \\pi^-$, while a second term from\nthe subprocess $cs \\to cd$ has been related by Voloshin to differences among\ntotal decay rates of charmed baryons. We calculate this term and find it to\nhave a magnitude approximately equal to the $s \\to u (\\bar u d)$ term. We argue\nfor a negligible relative phase between these two contributions, potentially\ndue to final state interactions. However, we do not know whether they interfere\ndestructively or constructively. For constructive interference one predicts\n${\\cal B}(\\Xi_c^0 \\to \\Lambda_c \\pi^-) = (1.94 \\pm 0.70)\\times 10^{-3}$ and\n${\\cal B}(\\Xi_c^+ \\to \\Lambda_c \\pi^0) = (3.86 \\pm 1.35)\\times 10^{-3}$. For\ndestructive interference, the respective branching fractions are expected to be\nless than about $10^{-4}$ and $2 \\times 10^{-4}$.\n", "  We present near infrared (NIR) spectroscopic and photometric observations of\nthe nearby Type Ia SN 2014J. The seventeen NIR spectra span epochs from +15.3\nto +92.5 days after $B$-band maximum light, while the $JHK_s$ photometry\ninclude epochs from $-$10 to +71 days. This data is used to constrain the\nprogenitor system of SN 2014J utilizing the Pa$\\beta$ line, following recent\nsuggestions that this phase period and the NIR in particular are excellent for\nconstraining the amount of swept up hydrogen-rich material associated with a\nnon-degenerate companion star. We find no evidence for Pa$\\beta$ emission lines\nin our post-maximum spectra, with a rough hydrogen mass limit of $\\lesssim$0.1\n$M_{\\odot}$, which is consistent with previous limits in SN 2014J from\nlate-time optical spectra of the H$\\alpha$ line. Nonetheless, the growing\ndataset of high-quality NIR spectra holds the promise of very useful hydrogen\nconstraints.\n", "  For binary fluid mixtures of spherical particles in which the two species are\nsufficiently different in size, the dominant wavelength of oscillations of the\npair correlation functions is predicted to change from roughly the diameter of\nthe large species to that of the small species along a sharp crossover line in\nthe phase diagram [C. Grodon, M. Dijkstra, R. Evans & R. Roth, J.Chem.Phys.\n121, 7869 (2004)]. Using particle-resolved colloid experiments in 3d we\ndemonstrate that crossover exists and that its location in the phase diagram is\nin quantitative agreement with the results of both theory and our Monte-Carlo\nsimulations. In contrast with previous work [J. Baumgartl, R. Dullens, M.\nDijkstra, R. Roth & C. Bechinger, Phys.Rev.Lett. 98, 198303 (2007)], where a\ncorrespondence was drawn between crossover and percolation of both species, in\nour 3d study we find that structural crossover is unrelated to percolation.\n", "  A theory of reciprocating contacts for linear viscoelastic materials is\npresented. Results are discussed for the case of a rigid sphere sinusoidally\ndriven in sliding contact with a viscoelastic half-space. Depending on the size\nof the contact, the frequency and amplitude of the reciprocating motion, and on\nthe relaxation time of the viscoelastic body, we establish that the contact\nbehavior may range from the steady-state viscoelastic solution, in which\ntraction forces always oppose the direction of the sliding rigid punch, to a\nmore elaborate trend, never observed before, which is due to the strong\ninteraction between different regions of the path covered during the\nreciprocating motion. Practical implications span a number of applications,\nranging from seismic engineering to biotechnology.\n", "  Since its launch in 2008, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) has\ntriggered and located on average approximately two gamma-ray bursts (GRB) every\nthree days. Here we present the third of a series of catalogs of GRBs detected\nby GBM, extending the second catalog by two more years, through the middle of\nJuly 2014. The resulting list includes 1405 triggers identified as GRBs. The\nintention of the GBM GRB catalog is to provide information to the community on\nthe most important observables of the GBM detected GRBs. For each GRB the\nlocation and main characteristics of the prompt emission, the duration, peak\nflux and fluence are derived. The latter two quantities are calculated for the\n50-300~keV energy band, where the maximum energy release of GRBs in the\ninstrument reference system is observed, and also for a broader energy band\nfrom 10-1000 keV, exploiting the full energy range of GBM's low-energy NaI(Tl)\ndetectors. Using statistical methods to assess clustering, we find that the\nhardness and duration of GRBs are better fitted by a two-component model with\nshort-hard and long-soft bursts, than by a model with three components.\nFurthermore, information is provided on the settings and modifications of the\ntriggering criteria and exceptional operational conditions during years five\nand six in the mission. This third catalog is an official product of the Fermi\nGBM science team, and the data files containing the complete results are\navailable from the High-Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center\n(HEASARC).\n", "  The hot gaseous halos of galaxies likely contain a large amount of mass and\nare an integral part of galaxy formation and evolution. The Milky Way has a 2e6\nK halo that is detected in emission and by absorption in the OVII resonance\nline against bright background AGNs, and for which the best current model is an\nextended spherical distribution. Using XMM-Newton RGS data, we measure the\nDoppler shifts of the OVII absorption-line centroids toward an ensemble of\nAGNs. These Doppler shifts constrain the dynamics of the hot halo, ruling out a\nstationary halo at about 3sigma and a corotating halo at 2sigma, and leading to\na best-fit rotational velocity of 183+/-41 km/s for an extended halo model.\nThese results suggest that the hot gas rotates and that it contains an amount\nof angular momentum comparable to that in the stellar disk. We examined the\npossibility of a model with a kinematically distinct disk and spherical halo.\nTo be consistent with the emission-line X-ray data the disk must contribute\nless than 10% of the column density, implying that the Doppler shifts probe\nmotion in the extended hot halo.\n", "  Many early-type stars are in systems; some of them have been indicated as\nputative high-energy emitters. The radiation is expected to be produced at the\nregion where two stellar winds collide. Compelling evidence of such emission\nwas found only for the colliding-wind binary (CWB) Eta Car, which was\nassociated to a GeV source. Very recently, the closest CWB, WR 11, was proposed\nas a counterpart of a 6sigma emission excess, measured with the Fermi LAT\nsatellite. We looked for evidence to support or reject the hypothesis that WR\n11 is responsible of the gamma-ray excess. Archive radio interferometric data\nat 1.4 and 2.5 GHz taken with the Australia Telescope Compact Array along\nsixteen different dates were reduced. The sizes of the field-of-view at 2.5 GHz\nand of the central region of the Fermi LAT excess are alike. We analyzed the\nemission of the field of WR 11, characterized the radio sources detected and\nderived their spectral indices, to investigate their nature. Eight sources with\nfluxes above 10 mJy were detected at both frequencies. All but one (WR 11)\nshowed negative spectral indices. Four of them were identified with known\nobjects, including WR 11. A fifth source, labeled here S6, could be a promising\ncandidate to produce gamma-ray emission, besides the CWB WR 11.\n", "  The Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon or Time-Dependent Density Matrix\n(TDDM) hierarchy of equations for higher density matrices is truncated at the\nthree body level in approximating the three body correlation function by a\nquadratic form of two body ones, closing the equations in this way. The\nprocedure is discussed in detail and it is shown in non-trivial model cases\nthat the approximate inclusion of three body correlation functions is very\nimportant to obtain precise results. A small amplitude approximation of this\ntime dependent nonlinear equation for the two body correlation function is\nperformed (STDDM*-b) and it is shown that the one body sector of this\ngeneralised non-linear second RPA equation is equivalent to the Self-Consistent\nRPA (SCRPA) approach which had been derived previously by different techniques.\nIt is discussed in which way SCRPA also contains the three body correlations.\nTDDM and SCRPA are tested versus exactly solvable model cases.\n", "  After the observation of non-zero $\\theta_{13}$ the goal has shifted to\nobserve $CP$ violation in the leptonic sector. Neutrino oscillation experiments\ncan, directly, probe the Dirac $CP$ phases. Alternatively, one can measure $CP$\nviolation in the leptonic sector using Leptonic Unitarity Quadrangle(LUQ). The\nexistence of Standard Model (SM) gauge singlets - sterile neutrinos - will\nprovide additional sources of $CP$ violation. We investigate the connection\nbetween neutrino survival probability and rephasing invariants of the\n$4\\times4$ neutrino mixing matrix. In general, LUQ contain eight geometrical\nparameters out of which five are independent. We obtain $CP$\nasymmetry($P_{\\nu_f\\rightarrow\\nu_{f'}}-P_{\\bar{\\nu}_f\\rightarrow\\bar{\\nu}_{f'}}$)\nin terms of these independent parameters of the LUQ and search for the\npossibilities of extracting information on these independent geometrical\nparameters in short baseline(SBL) and long baseline(LBL) experiments, thus,\nlooking for constructing LUQ and possible measurement of $CP$ violation. We\nfind that it is not possible to construct LUQ using data from LBL experiments\nbecause $CP$ asymmetry is sensitive to only three of the five independent\nparameters of LUQ. However, for SBL experiments, $CP$ asymmetry is found to be\nsensitive to all five independent parameters making it possible to construct\nLUQ and measure $CP$ violation.\n", "  We describe a method for spectral cleaning and timing calibration of short\nvoltage time series data from individual radio interferometer receivers. It\nmakes use of the phase differences in Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) spectra\nacross antenna pairs. For strong, localized terrestrial sources these are\nstable over time, while being approximately uniform-random for a sum over many\nsources or for noise. Using only milliseconds-long datasets, the method finds\nthe strongest interfering transmitters, a first-order solution for relative\ntiming calibrations, and faulty data channels. No knowledge of gain response or\nquiescent noise levels of the receivers is required. With relatively small data\nvolumes, this approach is suitable for use in an online system monitoring setup\nfor interferometric arrays.\n  We have applied the method to our cosmic-ray data collection, a collection of\nmeasurements of short pulses from extensive air showers, recorded by the LOFAR\nradio telescope. Per air shower, we have collected 2 ms of raw time series data\nfor each receiver. The spectral cleaning has a calculated optimal sensitivity\ncorresponding to a power signal-to-noise ratio of 0.08 (or -11 dB) in a\nspectral window of 25 kHz, for 2 ms of data in 48 antennas. This is well\nsufficient for our application. Timing calibration across individual antenna\npairs has been performed at 0.4 ns precision; for calibration of signal clocks\nacross stations of 48 antennas the precision is 0.1 ns. Monitoring differences\nin timing calibration per antenna pair over the course of the period 2011 to\n2015 shows a precision of 0.08 ns, which is useful for monitoring and\ncorrecting drifts in signal path synchronizations.\n  A cross-check method for timing calibration is presented, using a pulse\ntransmitter carried by a drone flying over the array. Timing precision is\nsimilar, 0.3 ns.\n", "  We report on the identification of the old stellar population galaxy\ncandidates at z > 5. We developed a new infrared color selection scheme to\nisolate galaxies with the strong Balmer breaks at z > 5, and applied it to the\nultra-deep and wide infrared survey data from the Spitzer Extended Deep Survey\n(SEDS) and the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey. The eight objects satisfying K -\n[3.6] > 1.3 and K - [3.6] > 2.4 ([3.6] - [4.5]) + 0.6 are selected in the 0.34\ndeg^2 SEDS Ultra Deep Survey field. Rich multi-wavelength imaging data from\noptical to far-infrared are also used to reject blending sources and strong\nnebular line emitters, and we finally obtained the three most likely evolved\ngalaxies at z > 5. Their stacked spectral energy distribution is fitted well\nwith the old stellar population template with M_{*} = (7.5+-1.5) x 10^{10}\nMsun, star formation rate = 0.9 +- 0.2 Msun yr^{-1}, dust A_V < 1, and age =\n0.7+-0.4 Gyr at z = 5.7+-0.6, where the dusty star-forming galaxies at z ~ 2.8\nare disfavored because of the faintness in the 24um. The stellar mass density\nof these evolved galaxy candidates, (6+-4) x 10^4 Msun Mpc^{-3}, is much lower\nthan that of star-forming galaxies, but the non-zero fraction suggests that\ninitial star-formation and quenching have been completed by z ~ 6.\n", "  The MAJORANA Collaboration is constructing the MAJORANA Demonstrator, an\nultra-low background, 44-kg modular high-purity Ge (HPGe) detector array to\nsearch for neutrinoless double-beta decay in Ge-76. The phenomenon of surface\nmicro-discharge induced by high-voltage has been studied in the context of the\nMAJORANA Demonstrator. This effect can damage the front-end electronics or\nmimic detector signals. To ensure the correct performance, every high-voltage\ncable and feedthrough must be capable of supplying HPGe detector operating\nvoltages as high as 5 kV without exhibiting discharge. R&D measurements were\ncarried out to understand the testing system and determine the optimum design\nconfiguration of the high-voltage path, including different improvements of the\ncable layout and feedthrough flange model selection. Every cable and\nfeedthrough to be used at the MAJORANA Demonstrator was characterized and the\nmicro-discharge effects during the MAJORANA Demonstrator commissioning phase\nwere studied. A stable configuration has been achieved, and the cables and\nconnectors can supply HPGe detector operating voltages without exhibiting\ndischarge.\n", "  The drag anisotropy of slender filaments is a critical physical property\nallowing swimming in low-Reynolds number flows, and without it linear\ntranslation is impossible. Here we show that, in contrast, net rotation can\noccur under isotropic drag. We first demonstrate this result formally by\nconsidering the consequences of the force- and torque-free conditions on\nswimming bodies and we then illustrate it with two examples (a simple swimmers\nmade of three rods and a model bacterium with two helical flagellar filaments).\nOur results highlight the different role of hydrodynamic forces in generating\ntranslational vs.~rotational propulsion.\n", "  The radial motion of massive particles in the equatorial plane of the Kerr\nblack hole is considered. Screening of the Hawking radiation and shielding of\nthe Penrose process are examined (both insides and outside the ergosphere) and\ntheir effects on the evaporation of the black hole is studied. In particular,\nthe locus and width of a classically forbidden region and their dependence on\nthe particle's angular momentum and energy is analysed. Tunneling of particles\nbetween the boundaries of this region is considered and the transmission\ncoefficient is determined.\n", "  From temperature and magnetic field dependent point-contact spectroscopy on\nthe ferromagnetic superconductor Sr$_{0.5}$Ce$_{0.5}$FBiS$_2$ (bulk\nsuperconducting $T_c$ = 2.5 K) we observe (a) a pseudogap in the normal state\nthat sustains to a remarkably high temperature of 40 K and (b) two-fold\nenhancement of $T_c$ upto 5 K in the point-contact geometry. In addition,\nAndreev reflection spectroscopy reveals a superconducting gap of 6 meV for\ncertain point-contacts suggesting that the mean field $T_c$ of this system\ncould be approximately 40 K, the onset temperature of pseudo-gap. Our results\nsuggest that quantum fluctuations originating from other competing orders in\nSr$_{0.5}$Ce$_{0.5}$FBiS$_2$ forbid a global phase coherence at high\ntemperatures thereby suppressing $T_c$. Apart from the known ordering to a\nferromagnetic state, our first-principles calculations reveal nesting of a\nmulti-band Fermi surface and a significant electron-phonon coupling that could\nresult in charge density wave-like instabilities.\n", "  The effects of line tension on the morphology of a lens-shaped droplet and\nbubble placed on the inner wall of a spherical cavity are studied. The contact\nangle between the lens-shaped droplet and the concave spherical substrate is\nexpressed by the generalized Young's formula. The equator of the spherical\nsubstrate is found to play a crucial role. Neither a droplet with its contact\nline on the upper hemisphere of the substrate nor one with its contact line on\nthe lower hemisphere can transform into each other continuously. On a\nhydrophobic substrate, the contact angle jumps discontinuously to\n$180^{\\circ}$, and the droplet is detached from the substrate to form a\nspherical droplet when the line tension is positive and large. This is similar\nto the drying transition on a flat substrate. On the other hand, on a\nhydrophilic substrate, the contact angle jumps discontinuously to $0^{\\circ}$\nwhen the line tension is positive and large. Then, the droplet spread over the\nwhole inner wall to leave a spherical bubble. Therefore, not only the drying\ntransition but also the wetting transition is induced by positive line tension\non a concave spherical substrate. There also exist stable as well as metastable\ndroplets, whose phase diagrams can be complex. When the line tension is\nnegative and its magnitude increases, the contact line approaches the equator\ninfinitesimally from either above or below. However, it cannot cross the\nequator of a spherical cavity continuously. The droplet with a contact line\nthat coincides with the equator is a singular droplet. The contact line is\npinned and cannot move, irrespective of the magnitude of the line tension.\n", "  This study depends on KIC 9641031 eclipsing binary system with a\nchromospherically active component. There are three type variations, such as\ngeometrical variations due to eclipses, sinusoidal variations due to the\nrotational modulations and also flares, in the light curves obtained with the\ndata taken from the Kepler Mission Database. Taking into account results\nobtained from KIC 9641031's observations in the Kepler Mission Database, we\npresent and discuss the details of chromospheric activity. The sinusoidal light\nvariations due to rotational modulation and the flare events were modelled\nseparately. 92 different data subsets separated using the analytic models\ndescribed in the literature were modelled separately to obtain the cool spot\nconfiguration. It is seen that just one component of the system is\nchromospherically active star. On this component, there are two active regions\nseparated by about 180 deg longitudinally between the latitudes of +50 deg and\n+100 deg, whose locations and forms are rapidly changing in short time\nintervals. 240 flares were detected and their parameters were computed. Using\nthese parameters, the One Phase Exponential Association (hereafter OPEA)\nfunction model was derived, in which the Plateau value as a saturation level of\nthe flare-equivalent duration was found to be 1.232 s for KIC 9641031, and\nhalf-life parameter was found to be 2291.7 s. The flare frequency N1 was found\nto be 0.41632 h-1, while the flare frequency N2 was found to be 0.00027.\nConsidering these parameters together with the orbital period variations\ndemonstrates that the period variations directly depend on chromospheric\nactivity. Comparing the system with its analogue it is seen that the activity\nlevel of KIC 9641031 is remarkablely lower than the others.\n", "  We discuss quantum interference phenomena in a system consisting from a laser\ndriven three-level ladder-type emitter possessing orthogonal transition dipoles\nand embedded in a leaking optical resonator. The cavity mean-photon number\nvanishes due to the destructive nature of the interference phenomena. The\neffect occurs for some particular parameter regimes which were identified.\nFurthermore, upper bare-state population inversion occurs as well.\n", "  A high-accuracy numerical study on the evolution of two-dimensional unbounded\nflows with the Hermite pseudo-spectral solver is presented. Our simulations\nclearly show that the simple Oseen vortex always appears in the late stage for\nevery initial condition with non-zero circulation ($\\Omega \\neq 0$). In\ngeneral, the theoretical time adopted to describe the Oseen vortex and the\nsimulating time in numerical investigations are not the same, and their\ndifference ($T_{diff}$) is in inverse proportion to the viscosity for the same\ninitial condition. In particular, a perturbed monopole will also eventually\nrelax into an Oseen vortex which shows obvious difference from the original\nmonopole no matter how small the perturbation is. This difference can be well\nrepresented by the time gap ($T_{gap}$) between the theoretical time of two\nmonopoles, and the type and amplitude of the perturbation determine the value\nof $T_{gap}$.\n", "  We present the Higgs mechanism in the context of the EW-scale $\\nu_R$ model\nin which electroweak symmetry is dynamically broken by condensates of mirror\nquark and right-handed neutrino through the exchange of one fundamental Higgs\ndoublet and one fundamental Higgs triplet, respectively. The formation of these\ncondensates is dynamically investigated by using the Schwinger-Dyson approach.\nThe occurrence of these condensates will give rise to the rich Higgs spectrum.\nIn addition, the VEVs of Higgs fields is also discussed in this dynamical\nphenomenon.\n", "  We study theoretically magnetically induced Feshbach resonances and\nnear-threshold bound states in isotopic NaK pairs. Our calculations accurately\nreproduce Feshbach spectroscopy data on Na$^{40}$K and explain the origin of\nthe observed multiplets in the p-wave [Phys. Rev. A 85, 051602(R) (2012)]. We\napply the model to predict scattering and bound state threshold properties of\nthe boson-boson Na$^{39}$K and Na$^{41}$K systems. We find that the Na$^{39}$K\nisotopic pair presents broad magnetic Feshbach resonances and favorable\nground-state features for producing non-reactive polar molecules by two-photon\nassociation. Broad s-wave resonances are also predicted for Na$^{41}$K\ncollisions.\n", "  We provide for the first time the growth index of linear matter fluctuations\nof the power law $f(T) \\propto (-T)^{b}$ gravity model. We find that the\nasymptotic form of this particular $f(T)$ model is $\\gamma \\approx\n\\frac{6}{11-6b}$ which obviously extends that of the $\\Lambda$CDM model,\n$\\gamma_{\\Lambda}\\approx 6/11$. Finally, we generalize the growth index\nanalysis of $f(T)$ gravity in the case where $\\gamma$ is allowed to vary with\nredshift.\n", "  An intense study of the alpha decay properties of the isotopes of superheavy\nelement Z=113 have been performed within the Coulomb and proximity potential\nmodel for deformed nuclei (CPPMDN) within the wide range 255 l.e. A l.e. 314.\nThe predicted alpha decay half lives of $^{278}$113 and $^{282}$113 and the\nalpha half lives of their decay products are in good agreement with the\nexperimental data. 6{\\alpha) chains and 4{\\alpha} chains predicted respectively\nfor $^{278}$113 and $^{282}$113 are in agreement with the experimental\nobservation. Our study shows that the isotopes in the mass range 278 l.e. A\nl.e. 286 will survive fission and can be synthesized and detected in the\nlaboratory via alpha decay. In our study, we have predicted 6{\\alpha} chains\nfrom $^{279}$113, 4{\\alpha} chains from $^{286}$113, 3{\\alpha} chains from\n$^{280,281,283}$113, 2{\\alpha} chains from $^{284}$113 and 1{\\alpha} chain from\n$^{285}$113. We hope that these predictions will be a guideline for future\nexperimental investigations.\n", "  Graviton propagator diverges in certain gauges in de Sitter spacetime. We\naddress this problem in this work by generalizing the infinitesimal BRST\ntransformations in de Sitter spacetime to finite field-dependent BRST (FFBRST)\ntransformations. These FFBRST transformations are symmetry of the classical\naction, but do not leave path integral measure invariant for the graviton\ntheory in de Sitter spacetime. Due to the non-trivial Jacobian of such finite\ntransformation the path integral measure changes and hence FFBRST\ntransformation is capable of relating theories in two different gauges. We\nexplicitly construct FFBRST transformation which relates theory with diverging\ngraviton two-point function to theory with infrared (IR) finite graviton. The\nFFBRST transformation thus establishes that divergence in graviton two-point\nfunction may be only a gauge artifact.\n", "  Bi-isotropic media, which include isotropic chiral media and Tellegen media\nas special cases, are the most general form of linear isotropic media where the\nelectric displacement and the magnetic induction are related to both the\nelectric field and the magnetic intensity. In inhomogeneous bi-isotropic media,\nelectromagnetic waves of two different polarizations are coupled to each other.\nIn this paper, we develop a generalized version of the invariant imbedding\nmethod for the study of wave propagation in arbitrarily-inhomogeneous\nstratified bi-isotropic media, which can be used to solve the coupled wave\npropagation problem accurately and efficiently. We verify the validity and\nusefulness of the method by applying it to several examples, including the wave\npropagation in a uniform chiral slab, the surface wave excitation in a bilayer\nsystem made of a layer of Tellegen medium and a metal layer, and the mode\nconversion of transverse electromagnetic waves into longitudinal plasma\noscillations in inhomogeneous Tellegen media. In contrast to the case of\nordinary isotropic media, we find that the surface wave excitation and the mode\nconversion occur for both s and p waves in bi-isotropic media.\n", "  We consider the generation of magnetic field by the flow of a fluid for which\nthe electrical conductivity is nonuniform. A new amplification mechanism is\nfound which leads to dynamo action for flows much simpler than those considered\nso far. In particular, the fluctuations of the electrical conductivity provide\na way to bypass anti-dynamo theorems. For astrophysical objects, we show\nthrough three-dimensional global numerical simulations that the\ntemperature-driven fluctuations of the electrical conductivity can amplify an\notherwise decaying large scale equatorial dipolar field. This effect could play\na role for the generation of the unusually tilted magnetic field of the iced\ngiants Neptune and Uranus.\n", "  Preferential attachment models have been widely studied in complex networks,\nbecause they can explain the formation of many networks like social networks,\ncitation networks, power grids, and biological networks, to name a few.\nMotivated by the application of key predistribution in wireless sensor networks\n(WSN), we initiate the study of preferential attachment with degree bound.\n  Our paper has two important contributions to two different areas. The first\nis a contribution in the study of complex networks. We propose preferential\nattachment model with degree bound for the first time. In the normal\npreferential attachment model, the degree distribution follows a power law,\nwith many nodes of low degree and a few nodes of high degree. In our scheme,\nthe nodes can have a maximum degree $d_{\\max}$, where $d_{\\max}$ is an integer\nchosen according to the application. The second is in the security of wireless\nsensor networks. We propose a new key predistribution scheme based on the above\nmodel. The important features of this model are that the network is fully\nconnected, it has fewer keys, has larger size of the giant component and lower\naverage path length compared with traditional key predistribution schemes and\ncomparable resilience to random node attacks.\n  We argue that in many networks like key predistribution and Internet of\nThings, having nodes of very high degree will be a bottle-neck in\ncommunication. Thus, studying preferential attachment model with degree bound\nwill open up new directions in the study of complex networks, and will have\nmany applications in real world scenarios.\n", "  In this paper, we propose a Parameter Switching (PS) algorithm as a new chaos\ncontrol method for the Hastings-Powell (HP) system. The PS algorithm is a\nconvergent scheme that switches the control parameter within a set of values\nwhile the controlled system is numerically integrated. The attractor obtained\nwith the PS algorithm matches the attractor obtained by integrating the system\nwith the parameter replaced by the averaged value of the switched parameter\nvalues. The switching rule can be applied periodically or randomly over a set\nof given values. In this way, every stable cycle of the HP system can be\napproximated if its underlying parameter value equalizes the average value of\nthe switching values. Moreover, the PS algorithm can be viewed as a\ngeneralization of Parrondo's game, which is applied for the first time to the\nHP system, by showing that losing strategy can win: \"losing + losing =\nwinning\". If \"loosing\" is replaced with \"chaos\" and, \"winning\" with \"order\" (as\nthe opposite to \"chaos\"), then by switching the parameter value in the HP\nsystem within two values, which generate chaotic motions, the PS algorithm can\napproximate a stable cycle so that symbolically one can write \"chaos + chaos =\nregular\". Also, by considering a different parameter control, new complex\ndynamics of the HP model are revealed.\n", "  A method for high-fidelity quantum state transfer in a quantum network\ncoupled to a continuum, based on time reversal in the continuum after decay, is\ntheoretically suggested. Provided that the energy spectrum of the network is\nsymmetric around a reference energy and symmetric energy states are coupled the\nsame way to the common continuum, ideal perfect state transfer can be obtained\nafter time reversal. In particular, it is shown that in a linear tight-binding\nchain a quantum state can be transformed into its mirror image with respect to\nthe center of the chain after a controllable time. As compared to quantum\nmirror image based on coherent transport in a static chain with properly\ntailored inhomogeneous hopping rates, our method does not require hopping rate\nengineering and is less sensitive to disorder for long transfer times.\n", "  The interplay between vortex guiding and the Hall effect in superconducting\nNb films with periodically arranged nanogrooves is studied via four-probe\nmeasurements in standard and Hall configurations and accompanying theoretical\nmodeling. The nanogrooves are milled by focused ion beam and induce a symmetric\npinning potential of the washboard type. The resistivity tensor of the films is\ndetermined in the limit of small current densities at temperatures close to the\ncritical temperature for the fundamental matching configuration of the vortex\nlattice with respect to the pinning nanolandscape. The angle between the\ncurrent direction with respect to the grooves is set at seven fixed values\nbetween $0^\\circ$ and $90^\\circ$. A sign change is observed in the temperature\ndependence of the Hall resistivity $\\rho_\\perp^-$ of as-grown films in a narrow\ntemperature range near $T_c$. By contrast, for all nanopatterned films\n$\\rho_\\perp^-$ is nonzero in a broader temperature range below $T_c$, allowing\nus to discriminate between two contributions in $\\rho_\\perp^-$, namely one\ncontribution originating from the guided vortex motion and the other one caused\nby the Hall anomaly just as in as-grown Nb films. All four measured resistivity\ncomponents are successfully fitted to analytical expressions derived within the\nframework of a stochastic model of competing isotropic and anisotropic pinning.\nThis provides evidence of the model validity for the description of the\nresistive response of superconductor thin films with washboard pinning\nnanolandscapes.\n", "  Recently we have proposed a reliable method to describe the rotational band\nin a fully microscopic manner. The method has recourse to the\nconfiguration-mixing of several cranked mean-field wave functions after the\nangular-momentum-projection. By applying the method with the Gogny D1S force as\nan effective interaction, we investigate the moments of inertia of the ground\nstate rotational bands in a number of selected nuclei in the rare earth region.\nAs another application we try to describe, for the first time, the two-neutron\naligned band in $^{164}$Er, which crosses the ground state band and becomes the\nyrast states at higher spins. Fairly good overall agreements with the\nexperimental data are achieved; for nuclei, where the pairing correlations are\nproperly described, the agreements are excellent. This confirms that the\npreviously proposed method is really useful for study of the nuclear rotational\nmotion.\n", "  We show that for ultra-cold neutral bosonic atoms held in a three-dimensional\nperiodic potential or optical lattice, a Hubbard model with dominant,\nattractive three-body interactions can be generated. In fact, we derive that\nthe effect of pair-wise interactions can be made small or zero starting from\nthe realization that collisions occur at the zero-point energy of an optical\nlattice site and the strength of the interactions is energy dependent from\neffective-range contributions. We determine the strength of the two- and\nthree-body interactions for scattering from van-der-Waals potentials and near\nFano-Feshbach resonances. For van-der-Waals potentials, which for example\ndescribe scattering of alkaline-earth atoms, we find that the pair-wise\ninteraction can only be turned off for species with a small negative scattering\nlength, leaving the $^{88}$Sr isotope a possible candidate. Interestingly, for\ncollisional magnetic Feshbach resonances this restriction does not apply and\nthere often exist magnetic fields where the two-body interaction is small. We\nillustrate this result for several known narrow resonances between alkali-metal\natoms as well as chromium atoms. Finally, we compare the size of the three-body\ninteraction with hopping rates and describe limits due to three-body\nrecombination.\n", "  Once upon a time, the world was simple: the proton contained three quarks,\ntwo {\\it ups} and a {\\it down}. How these give the proton its mass and its spin\nseemed obvious. Over the past forty years the proton has become more\ncomplicated, and how even these most obvious of its properties is explained in\na universe of quarks, antiquarks and gluons remains a challenge. That this\nshould be so should come as no surprise. Quantum Chromodynamics, the theory of\nthe strong interaction, is seemingly simple, and its consequences are\nstraightforward in the domain of hard scattering where perturbation theory\napplies. However, the beauty of the hadron world is its diversity. The\nexistence of hadrons, their properties, and their binding into nuclei do not\nappear in the Lagrangian of QCD. They all emerge as a result of its strong\ncoupling. Strong coupling QCD creates complex phenomena, much richer than known\n40 years ago: a richness that ensures colour confinement and accounts for more\nthan 95\\% of the mass of the visible Universe. How strong coupling QCD really\nworks requires a synergy between experiment and theory. A very personal view of\nthese fascinating developments in cold QCD is presented.\n", "  We combine dust, atomic (HI) and molecular (H$_{2}$) hydrogen mass\nmeasurements for 176 galaxies in the Herschel Reference Survey to investigate\nthe effect of environment on the gas-to-dust mass ($M_{\\rm gas}/M_{\\rm dust}$)\nratio of nearby galaxies. We find that, at fixed stellar mass, the average\n$M_{\\rm gas}/M_{\\rm dust}$ ratio varies by no more than a factor of $\\sim$2\nwhen moving from field to cluster galaxies, with Virgo galaxies being slightly\nmore dust rich (per unit of gas) than isolated systems. Remarkably, once the\nmolecular and atomic hydrogen phases are investigated separately, we find that\n\\hi-deficient galaxies have at the same time lower $M_{\\rm HI}/M_{\\rm dust}$\nratio but higher $M_{\\rm H_{2}}/M_{\\rm dust}$ ratio than \\hi-normal systems. In\nother words, they are poorer in atomic but richer in molecular hydrogen if\nnormalized to their dust content. By comparing our findings with the\npredictions of theoretical models, we show that the opposite behavior observed\nin the $M_{\\rm HI}/M_{\\rm dust}$ and $M_{\\rm H_{2}}/M_{\\rm dust}$ ratios is\nfully consistent with outside-in stripping of the interstellar medium (ISM),\nand is simply a consequence of the different distribution of dust, \\hi\\ and\nH$_{2}$ across the disk. Our results demonstrate that the small environmental\nvariations in the total $M_{\\rm gas}/M_{\\rm dust}$ ratio, as well as in the\ngas-phase metallicity, do not automatically imply that environmental mechanisms\nare not able to affect the dust and metal content of the ISM in galaxies.\n", "  We investigate theoretically the spectral and dynamical effects of the\nshort-range exchange interaction between a single manganese (Mn) atom hosted by\ncylindrical CdTe quantum dots and its light-hole excitons or biexcitons. Our\napproach is based on the Kohn-Luttinger KP theory and configuration interaction\nmethod, the dynamics of the system in the presence of intraband relaxation\nbeing derived from the von Neumann-Lindblad equation. The complex structure of\nthe light-hole exciton absorption spectrum reveals the exchange-induced exciton\nmixing and depends strongly on the Mn position. In particular, if the Mn atom\nis closer to the edges of the cylinder the bright and dark light-hole excitons\nare mixed by the hole-Mn exchange alone. Consequently, their populations\nexhibit exchange-induced Rabi oscillations which can be viewed as optical\nsignatures of light-hole spin reversal. Similar results are obtained for mixed\nbiexcitons, in this case the exchange-induced Rabi oscillations being damped by\nthe intraband hole relaxation processes. The effect of light-hole heavy-hole\nmixing is also discussed.\n", "  This paper aims at providing an introduction to the behavior of authors\nsubmitting a paper to a scientific journal. Dates of electronic submission of\npapers to the Journal of the Serbian Chemical Society have been recorded from\nthe 1st January 2013 till the 31st December 2014, thus over 2 years.\n  There is no Monday or Friday effect like in financial markets, but rather a\nTuesday-Wednesday effect occurs: papers are more often submitted on Wednesday;\nhowever, the relative number of going to be accepted papers is larger if these\nare submitted on Tuesday. On the other hand, weekend days (Saturday and Sunday)\nare not the best days to finalize and submit manuscripts. An interpretation\nbased on the type of submitted work (\"experimental chemistry\") and on the\ninfluence of (senior) coauthors is presented. A thermodynamic connection is\nproposed within an entropy context. A (new) entropic distance is defined in\norder to measure the \"opaqueness\" = disorder) of the submission process.\n", "  We derive augmented quasiclassical equations of superconductivity with the\nLorentz force in the Matsubara formalism so that the charge redistribution due\nto supercurrent can be calculated quantitatively. Using it, we obtain an\nanalytic expression for the vortex-core charge of an isolated vortex in extreme\ntype-II materials given in terms of the London penetration depth and the\nequilibrium Hall coefficient. It depends strongly on the Fermi surface\ncurvature and gap anisotropy, and may change sign even as a function of\ntemperature due to the variation in the excitation curvature under the growing\nenergy gap. This is also confirmed in our numerical study of high-$T_{\\rm c}$\nsuperconductors.\n", "  Individual light curves of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are nowadays\nsuccessfully modelled with the damped random walk (DRW) stochastic process,\ncharacterized by the power exponential covariance matrix of the signal, with\nthe power $\\beta=1$. By Monte Carlo simulation means, we generate mock AGN\nlight curves described by non-DRW stochastic processes ($0.5\\leq\\beta\\leq 1.5$\nand $\\beta\\neq1$) and show they can be successfully and well-modelled as a\nsingle DRW process, obtaining comparable goodness of fits. A good DRW fit, in\nfact, may not mean that DRW is the true underlying process leading to\nvariability and it cannot be used as a proof for it. When comparing the input\n(non-DRW) and measured (DRW) process parameters, the recovered time scale\n(amplitude) increases (decreases) with the increasing input $\\beta$. In\npractice, this means that the recovered DRW parameters may lead to biased (or\neven non-existing) correlations of the variability and physical parameters of\nAGNs if the true AGN variability is caused by non-DRW stochastic processes. The\nproper way of identifying the processes leading to variability are\nmodel-independent structure functions and/or power spectral densities and then\nusing such information on the covariance matrix of the signal in light curve\nmodelling.\n", "  We comment on the treatment of asymptotic black-disk scattering in a recent\npaper of Nastase and Sonnenschein, Phys.\\ Rev.\\ D\\ {\\bf 92}, 015028 (2015), on\nscattering in an updated version of the Heisenberg model which gives $pp$ and\n$\\bar{p}p$ cross sections which increase at very high energies as $\\ln^2s$. We\nshow that the total cross section they define does not correspond to that\nmeasured in experiments, with the result that their limit for the ratio\n$\\sigma_{\\rm elas}/\\sigma_{\\rm tot}$ is too small by a factor 2. The correct\nratio for black-disk scattering, $\\sigma_{\\rm elas}/\\sigma_{\\rm tot}\n\\rightarrow 1/2$ for $s\\rightarrow\\infty$, is strongly supported by experiment.\n", "  The miscibility of polymer blends, a classical problem in polymer science,\nmay be altered, if one or both of the component do not have chain ends. Based\non the idea of {\\it topological volume}, we propose a mean-field theory to\nclarify how the topological constraints in ring polymers affect the phase\nbehavior of the blends. While the large enhancement of the miscibility is\nexpected for ring-linear polymer blends, the opposite trend toward demixing,\nalbeit comparatively weak, is predicted for ring-ring polymer blends. Scaling\nformulas for the shift of critical point for both cases are derived. We discuss\nthe valid range of the present theory, and the crossover to the linear polymer\nblends behaviors, which is expected for short chains. These analysis put\nforward a view that the topological constraints could be represented as an\neffective excluded-volume effects, in which the topological length plays a role\nof the screening factor.\n", "  This paper reports on the study of the dynamics of 1D magneto-granular\nphononic crystals composed of a chain of spherical steel beads inside a\nproperly designed magnetic field. This field is induced by an array of\npermanent magnets, located in a holder at a given distance from the chain. The\ntheoretical and experimental results of the band gap structure are displayed,\nincluding all six degrees of freedom for the beads, i.e. three translations and\nthree rotations. Experimental evidence of transverse-rotational modes of\npropagation is pre- sented; moreover, by changing the strength of the magnetic\nfield, the dynamic response of the granular chain is tuned. The combination of\nnon-contact tunability with the potentially strong nonlinear behavior of gran-\nular systems ensures the suitability of magneto-granular phononic crystals as\nnonlinear, tunable mechanical metamaterials for use in controlling elastic wave\npropagation.\n", "  We identify isolated galaxy triplets in a volume-limited sample from the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 10. Our final sample has 80 galaxy\nsystems in the redshift range 0.04$\\le$z$\\le$0.1, brighter than $M_r = -20.5 +\n5\\log h_{70}$. Spectral synthesis results and WHAN and BPT diagnostic diagrams\nwere employed to classify the galaxies in these systems as star-forming, active\nnuclei, or passive/retired.\n  Our results suggest that the brightest galaxies drive the triplet evolution,\nas evidenced by the strong correlations between properties as mass assembly and\nmean stellar population age with triplet properties. Galaxies with intermediate\nluminosity or the faintest one within the triplet seem to play a secondary\nrole. Moreover, the relation between age and stellar mass of galaxies is\nsimilar for these galaxies but different for the brightest galaxy in the\nsystem. Most of the triplet galaxies are passive or retired, according to the\nWHAN classification. Low mass triplets present different fractions of WHAN\nclasses when compared to higher mass triplets. A census of WHAN class\ncombinations shows the dominance of star-forming galaxies in low mass triplets\nwhile retired and passive galaxies prevail in high-mass systems. We argue that\nthese results suggest that the local environment, through galaxy interactions\ndriven by the brightest galaxy, is playing a major role in triplet evolution.\n", "  We examined light curves of 1138 stars brighter than 18.0 mag in the $I$ band\nand less than a mean magnitude error of 0.1 mag in the $V$ band from the\nOGLE-III eclipsing binary catalogue, and found 90 new binary systems exhibiting\napsidal motion. In this study, the samples of apsidal motion stars in the SMC\nwere increased by a factor of about 3 than previously known. In order to\ndetermine the period of the apsidal motion for the binaries, we analysed in\ndetail both the light curves and eclipse timings using the MACHO and OGLE\nphotometric database. For the eclipse timing diagrams of the systems, new times\nof minimum light were derived from the full light curve combined at intervals\nof one year from the survey data. The new 90 binaries have apsidal motion\nperiods in the range of 12$-$897 years. An additional short-term oscillation\nwas detected in four systems (OGLE-SMC-ECL-1634, 1947, 3035, and 4946), which\nmost likely arises from the existence of a third body orbiting each eclipsing\nbinary. Since the systems presented here are based on homogeneous data and have\nbeen analysed in the same way, they are suitable for further statistical\nanalysis.\n", "  Excitations of chiral rotation observed in triaxial nuclei and magnetic\nand/or antimagnetic rotations seen in near-spherical nuclei have attracted a\nlot of attention. Unlike conventional rotation in well-deformed or\nsuperdeformed nuclei, here the rotational axis is not necessary coinciding with\nany principal axis of the nuclear density distribution. Thus, tilted axis\ncranking is mandatory to describe these excitations self-consistently in the\nframework of covariant density functional theory (CDFT). We will briefly\nintroduce the formalism of tilted axis cranking CDFT and its application for\nmagnetic and antimagnetic rotation phenomena. Configuration-fixed CDFT and its\npredictions for nuclear chiral configurations and for favorable triaxial\ndeformation parameters are also presented, and the discoveries of the multiple\nchiral doublets (M\\c{hi}D) in 133Ce and 103Rh are discussed.\n", "  The small spin-orbit interaction of carbon atoms in graphene promises a long\nspin diffusion length and potential to create a spin field-effect transistor.\nHowever, for this reason, graphene was largely overlooked as a possible\nspin-charge conversion material. We report electric gate tuning of the\nspin-charge conversion voltage signal in a single-layer graphene. Using spin\npumping from yttrium iron garnet ferrimagnetic insulator and ionic liquid top\ngate we determined that the inverse spin Hall effect is the dominant\nspin-charge conversion mechanism in a single-layer graphene. From the gate\ndependence of the electromotive force we showed dominance of the intrinsic over\nRashba spin-orbit interaction: a long-standing question in graphene research.\n", "  We introduce the white light quantitative phase imaging unit (WQPIU) as a\npractical realization of quantitative phase imaging (QPI) on standard\nmicroscope platforms. The WQPIU is a compact stand-alone unit which measures\nsample induced phase delay under white-light illumination. It does not require\nany modification of the microscope or additional accessories for its use. The\nprinciple of the WQPIU based on lateral shearing interferometry and phase\nshifting interferometry provides a cost-effective and user-friendly use of QPI.\nThe validity and capacity of the presented method are demonstrated by measuring\nquantitative phase images of polystyrene beads, human red blood cells, HeLa\ncells and mouse white blood cells. With speckle-free imaging capability due to\nthe use of white-light illumination, the WQPIU is expected to expand the scope\nof QPI in biological sciences as a powerful but simple imaging tool.\n", "  We perform coherent non-linear spectroscopy of individual excitons strongly\nconfined in single InAs quantum dots (QDs). The retrieval of their\nintrinsically weak four-wave mixing (FWM) response is enabled by a\none-dimensional dielectric waveguide antenna. Compared to a similar QD embedded\nin bulk media, the FWM detection sensitivity is enhanced by up to four orders\nof magnitude, over a broad operation bandwidth. Three-beam FWM is employed to\ninvestigate coherence and population dynamics within individual QD transitions.\nWe retrieve their homogenous dephasing in a presence of spectral wandering.\nTwo-dimensional FWM reveals off-resonant F\\\"orster coupling between a pair of\ndistinct QDs embedded in the antenna. We also detect a higher order QD\nnon-linearity (six-wave mixing) and use it to coherently control the FWM\ntransient. Waveguide antennas enable to conceive multi-color coherent\nmanipulation schemes of individual emitters.\n", "  We use microscopic density functional theory to study filling transitions in\nsystems with long-ranged wall-fluid and short-ranged fluid-fluid forces\noccurring in a right-angle wedge. By changing the strength of the wall-fluid\ninteraction we can induce both wetting and filling transitions over a wide\nrange of temperatures and study the order of these transitions. At low\ntemperatures we find that both wetting and filling transitions are first-order\nin keeping with predictions of simple local effective Hamiltonian models.\nHowever close to the bulk critical point the filling transition is observed to\nbe continuous even though the wetting transition remains first-order and the\nwetting binding potential still exhibits a small activation barrier. The\ncritical singularities for adsorption for the continuous filling transitions\ndepend on whether retarded or non-retarded wall-fluid forces are present and\nare in excellent agreement with predictions of effective Hamiltonian theory\neven though the change in the order of the transition was not anticipated.\n", "  In quantum theory the vacuum is defined as a state of minimum energy that is\ndevoid of particles but still not completely empty. It is perhaps more\nsurprising that its definition depends on the geometry of the system and on the\ntrajectory of an observer through space-time. Along these lines we investigate\nthe case of an atom flying at constant velocity near a planar surface. Using\ngeneral concepts of statistical mechanics it is shown that the motion-modified\ninteraction with the electromagnetic vacuum is formally equivalent to the\ninteraction with a thermal field having an effective temperature determined by\nthe atom's velocity and distance from the surface. This result suggests new\nways to experimentally investigate the properties of the quantum vacuum in\nnon-equilibrium systems and effects such as quantum friction.\n", "  We discuss the paramagnetic and Neel-ordered phases of the Kondo lattice\nHamiltonian on the 2D square lattice by means of bond Fermions. In the doped\ncase we find two antiferromagnetic solutions, the first one with small ordered\nmoment, heavy bands, and an antiferromagetically folded large Fermi surface -\ni.e. including the localized spins - the second one with large ordered moment,\nlight bands and an antiferromagnetically folded conduction electron-only Fermi\nsurface. The zero temperature phase diagram as a function of Kondo coupling and\nconduction electron density shows first and second order transition lines\nbetween the three different phases and agrees qualitatively with previous\nnumerical studies. We compare to experiments on CeRh(1-x)Co(x)In(5) and find\nqualitative agreement.\n", "  We present a spectral analysis of a brief Chandra/HETG observation of the\nneutron star low-mass X-ray binary GX~340+0. The high-resolution spectrum\nreveals evidence of ionized absorption in the Fe K band. The strongest feature,\nan absorption line at approximately 6.9 keV, is required at the 5 sigma level\nof confidence via an F-test. Photoionization modeling with XSTAR grids suggests\nthat the line is the most prominent part of a disk wind with an apparent\noutflow speed of v = 0.04c. This interpretation is preferred at the 4 sigma\nlevel over a scenario in which the line is H-like Fe XXVI at a modest\nred-shift. The wind may achieve this speed owing to its relatively low\nionization, enabling driving by radiation pressure on lines; in this sense, the\nwind in GX 340+0 may be the stellar-mass equivalent of the flows in broad\nabsorption line quasars (BALQSOs). If the gas has a unity volume filling\nfactor, the mass ouflow rate in the wind is over 10^-5 Msun/year, and the\nkinetic power is nearly 10^39 erg/s (or, 5-6 times the radiative Eddington\nlimit for a neutron star). However, geometrical considerations - including a\nsmall volume filling factor and low covering factor - likely greatly reduce\nthese values.\n", "  In both quantum optics and cold atom physics, the behaviour of bosonic\nphotons and atoms is often treated using phase space methods, where mode\nannihilation and creation operators are represented by c-number phase space\nvariables, with the density operator equivalent to a distribution function of\nthese variables. The anti-commutation rules for fermion annihilation, creation\noperators suggests the possibility of using anti-commuting Grassmann variables\nto represent these operators. However, in spite of the seminal work by Cahill\nand Glauber and a few applications, the use of Grassmann phase space methods in\nquantum - atom optics to treat fermionic systems is rather rare, though fermion\ncoherent states using Grassmann variables are widely used in particle physics.\n  This paper presents a phase space theory for fermion systems based on\ndistribution functionals, which replace the density operator and involve\nGrassmann fields representing anti-commuting fermion field annihilation,\ncreation operators. It is an extension of a previous phase space theory paper\nfor fermions (Paper I) based on separate modes, in which the density operator\nis replaced by a distribution function depending on Grassmann phase space\nvariables which represent the mode annihilation and creation operators. This\nfurther development of the theory is important for the situation when large\nnumbers of fermions are involved, resulting in too many modes to treat\nseparately. Here Grassmann fields, distribution functionals, functional\nFokker-Planck equations and Ito stochastic field equations are involved.\nTypical applications to a trapped Fermi gas of interacting spin 1/2 fermionic\natoms and to multi-component Fermi gases with non-zero range interactions are\npresented, showing that the Ito stochastic field equations are local in these\ncases. Solutions for spin 1/2 fermions either free or in lattices are found.\n", "  An analytical method is presented for designing N-coupled multi-core fibers\nwith zero differential group delay. This approach effectively reduces the\nproblem to a system of N-1 algebraic equations involving the associated\ncoupling coefficients and propagation constants as obtained from coupled mode\ntheory. Once the parameters of one of the cores are specified, the roots of the\nresulting N-1 equations can then be used to determine the characteristics of\nthe remaining waveguide elements. Using this technique, a number of pertinent\ngeometrical configurations are investigated in order to minimize intermodal\ndispersion.\n", "  The young associations offer us one of the best opportunities to study the\nproperties of young stellar and substellar objects and to directly image\nplanets thanks to their proximity ($<$200 pc) and age ($\\approx$5-150 Myr).\nHowever, many previous works have been limited to identifying the brighter,\nmore active members ($\\approx$1 M$_\\odot$) owing to photometric survey\nsensitivities limiting the detections of lower mass objects. We search the\nfield of view of 542 previously identified members of the young associations to\nidentify wide or extremely wide (1000-100,000 au in physical separation)\ncompanions. We combined 2MASS near-infrared photometry ($J$, $H$, $K$) with\nproper motion values (from UCAC4, PPMXL, NOMAD) to identify companions in the\nfield of view of known members. We collated further photometry and spectroscopy\nfrom the literature and conducted our own high-resolution spectroscopic\nobservations for a subsample of candidate members. This complementary\ninformation allowed us to assess the efficiency of our method. We identified 84\ntargets (45: 0.2-1.3 M$_\\odot$, 17: 0.08-0.2 M$_\\odot$, 22: $<$0.08 M$_\\odot$)\nin our analysis, ten of which have been identified from spectroscopic analysis\nin previous young association works. For 33 of these 84, we were able to\nfurther assess their membership using a variety of properties (X-ray emission,\nUV excess, H$_\\alpha$, lithium and K I equivalent widths, radial velocities,\nand CaH indices). We derive a success rate of 76-88% for this technique based\non the consistency of these properties. Once confirmed, the targets identified\nin this work would significantly improve our knowledge of the lower mass end of\nthe young associations. Additionally, these targets would make an ideal new\nsample for the identification and study of planets around nearby young stars.\n", "  The experimental investigation of a broadband far-infrared meta-material\nabsorber is described. The observed absorptance is $>\\,0.95$ from ${\\rm\n1-20\\,THz}$ (${\\rm 300-15\\,\\mu m}$) over a temperature range spanning ${\\rm\n5-300\\,K}$. The meta-material, realized from an array of tapers ${\\rm \\approx\n100\\,\\mu m}$ in length, is largely insensitive to the detailed geometry of\nthese elements and is cryogenically compatible with silicon-based\nmicro-machined technologies. The electromagnetic response is in general\nagreement with a physically motivated transmission line model.\n", "  In this paper, we construct the bilinear identities for the wave functions of\nan extended B-type Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (BKP) hierarchy, which contains two\ntypes of (2+1)-dimensional Sawada-Kotera equation with a self-consistent source\n(2d-SKwS-I and 2d-SKwS-II). By introducing an auxiliary variable corresponding\nto the extended flow for the BKP hierarchy, we find the tau-function and the\nbilinear identities for this extended BKP hierarchy. The bilinear identities\ncan generate all the Hirota's bilinear equations for the zero-curvature forms\nof this extended BKP hierarchy. As examples, the Hirota's bilinear equations\nfor the two types of 2d-SKwS (both 2d-SKwS-I and 2d-SKwS-II) will be given\nexplicitly.\n", "  In a recent paper in EPJC January 2016, Faizal, Khalil and Das have proposed\ntime crystals with duration several orders of magnitude greater than Planck\nscale. We comment on this paper and shed further light on this aspect.\n", "  We present a detailed study of the complex ionization structure in a small\n(~250 pc) extended narrow line region (ENLR) cloud near Centaurus A using the\nMulti Unit Spectroscopic Explorer. This cloud is located in the so-called outer\nfilament of ionized gas (about 15 kpc from the nucleus) where jet-induced star\nformation has been suggested to occur by different studies. We find that,\ndespite the small size, a mixture of ionization mechanisms is operating,\nresulting in considerable complexity in the spatial ionization structure. The\narea includes two H II regions where star formation is occurring and another\nlocation where star formation must have ceased very recently. Interestingly,\nthe extreme Balmer decrement of one of the star forming regions\n(H_alpha/H_beta~6) indicates that it is still heavily embedded in its natal\ncocoon of gas and dust. At all three locations a continuum counterpart is found\nwith spectra matching those of O/B stars local to Centaurus A. The H II regions\nare embedded in a larger gas complex which is photoionized by the radiation of\nthe central active galactic nucleus (AGN), but the O/B stars affect the spatial\nionization pattern in the ENLR cloud very locally. In particular, in the\nsurroundings of the youngest star forming region, we can isolate a tight mixing\nsequence in the diagnostic diagram going from gas with ionization due to a pure\nstellar continuum to gas only photoionized by the AGN. These results emphasize\nthe complexity and the mixture of processes occurring in star forming regions\nunder the influence of an AGN radiation. This is relevant for our understanding\nof AGN-induced star formation suggested to occur in a number of objects,\nincluding this region of Centaurus A. They also illustrate that these young\nstars influence the gas over only a limited region.\n", "  Rotational temperatures Trot derived from lines of the same OH band are an\nimportant method to study the mesopause region near 87 km. To measure realistic\ntemperatures, the rotational level populations have to be in local\nthermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). However, this might not be fulfilled,\nespecially at high emission altitudes. In order to quantify possible non-LTE\ncontributions to the OH Trot as a function of the upper vibrational level v',\nwe studied a sample of 343 echelle spectra taken with the X-shooter\nspectrograph at the Very Large Telescope at Cerro Paranal in Chile. These data\nallowed us to analyse 25 OH bands in each spectrum. Moreover, we could measure\nlines of O2b(0-1), which peaks at 94 to 95 km, and O2a(0-0) with an emission\npeak at about 90 km. Since the radiative lifetimes are relatively long, the\nderived O2 Trot are not significantly affected by non-LTE contributions. For a\ncomparison with OH, the differences in the emission profiles were corrected by\nusing OH emission, O2a(0-0) emission, and CO2-based temperature profile data\nfrom the multi-channel radiometer SABER on the TIMED satellite. For a reference\nprofile at 90 km, we found a good agreement of the O2 with the SABER-related\ntemperatures, whereas the OH temperatures, especially for the high and even v',\nshowed significant excesses with a maximum of more than 10 K for v' = 8. We\ncould also find a nocturnal trend towards higher non-LTE effects, particularly\nfor high v'.\n", "  We report electronic transport measurements through a silicon hybrid double\nquantum dot consisting of a donor and a quantum dot. Transport spectra show\nresonant tunneling peaks involving different valley states, which illustrate\nthe valley splitting in a quantum dot on a Si/SiO2 interface. The detailed gate\nbias dependence of double dot transport allows a first direct observation of\nthe valley splitting in the quantum dot, which is controllable between 160-240\nueV with an electric field dependence 1.2 +- 0.2 meV/(MV/m). A large valley\nsplitting is an essential requirement to implement a physical electron spin\nqubit in a silicon quantum dot.\n", "  The five-dimensional collective Hamiltonian based on the covariant density\nfunctional theory is applied to investigate the observed tidal wave mode in the\nyrast band of $^{102}$Pd. The energy spectra, the relations between the spin\nand the rotational frequency, and the ratios of $B(E2)/\\mathcal{J}(I)$ in the\nyrast band are well reproduced by introducing the empirical $ab$ formula for\nthe moments of inertia. This $ab$ formula is related to the fourth order effect\nof collective momentum in the collective Hamiltonian. It is also shown that the\nshape evolution in the tidal wave is determined microscopically by the\ncompetition between the rotational kinetic energy and the collective potential\nin the framework of the collective Hamiltonian.\n", "  In this paper we study static spherically symmetric wormhole solutions\nsustained by matter sources with isotropic pressure. We show that such\nspherical wormholes do not exist in the framework of zero-tidal-force\nwormholes. On the other hand, it is shown that for the often used power-law\nshape function there is no spherically symmetric traversable wormholes\nsustained by sources with a linear equation of state $p=\\omega \\rho$ for the\nisotropic pressure, independently of the form of the redshift function\n$\\phi(r)$. We consider a solution obtained by Tolman at 1939 for describing\nstatic spheres of isotropic fluids, and show that it also may describe wormhole\nspacetimes with a power-law redshift function, which leads to a polynomial\nshape function, generalizing a power-law shape function, and inducing a solid\nangle deficit.\n", "  The couplings of the Standard Model sector to the scale invariant degrees of\nfreedom can open the possibility to study dark photons (DP). The Dalitz-like\ndecay of the (Higgs-like) scalar boson into a single photon and DP is studied.\nThe interaction between DP and quarks is mediated by the derivative of the\nscalar field - the dilaton, the virtual (fictitious) state. The mass of the\ndilaton does not enter the final solutions. Upper limits are set on the DP\nmass, the mixing strength between the standard photon and DP. The model does\nallow to estimate the DP mass with the value of 4.5 MeV.\n", "  We present a numerically efficient and accurate Multiple Scattering\nformalism, which is a generalization of the Multiple Scattering method with a\ntruncated basis set [X. -G. Zhang and W. H. Butler, Phys. Rev. B 46,7433\n(1992)]. Compared to the latter method, we keep the phase shifts of high\nangular momenta but apply approximations in the elements of the scattering\nmatrix which is the subtraction of the unit matrix and the product of\ntransition operator matrix and structure constant matrix. The detailed\nbehaviour of our formalism for different types of calculations, where not full\ninformation of Green's function is needed, are discussed. We apply our\nformalism to study density of states of fcc Cu and silicon and C K-edge X-ray\nabsorption spectra of graphene, in order to check the efficiency and accuracy\nof our formalism. We find that compared to Zhang's method, the accuracy is\ngreatly improved by our method.\n", "  Understanding the sources of instrumental systematic noise is a must to\nimprove the design of future spectrographs. In this study, we alternated\nobservations of the well-suited pair of M-stars GJ 725A+B to delve into the\nsub-night HARPS-N response. Besides the possible presence of a low-mass planet\norbiting GJ 725B, our observations reveal changes in the spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) correlated with measurements of the width of the\ninstrumental line profile and, to a lower degree, with the Doppler\nmeasurements. To study the origin of these effects, we searched for\ncorrelations among several quantities defined and measured on the spectra and\non the acquisition images.\n  We find that the changes in apparent SED are very likely related to flux\nlosses at the fibre input. Further tests indicate that such flux losses do not\nseriously affect the shape of the instrumental point spread function of\nHARPS-N, but identify an inefficient fitting of the continuum as the most\nlikely source of the systematic variability observed in the FWHM. This index,\naccounting for the HARPS-N cross-correlation profiles width, is often used to\ndecorrelate Doppler time-series. We show that the Doppler measurement obtained\nby a parametric least-squares fitting of the spectrum accounting for continuum\nvariability is insensitive to changes in the slope of the SED, suggesting that\nforward modeling techniques to measure moments of the line profile are the\noptimal way to achieve higher accuracy. Remaining residual variability at ~1\nm/s suggests that for M-stars Doppler surveys the current noise floor still has\nan instrumental origin.\n", "  We demonstrate the existence of a broad class of non-perturbative fermionic\nsolutions to the Euclidean supergravity equations of motion, which are half-BPS\nand nonsingular, possess zero action, and obey an (anti)self-duality condition.\nThese are identified as fermionic instantons associated to the status of the\ngravitino as the gauge field of local supersymmetry. By explicitly constructing\nthese configurations from combinations of (anti)self-dual Yang-Mills gauge\nfields and Killing spinors, we may leverage the ADHM method and generalisations\nthereof to provide all possible solutions on certain gravitational backgrounds.\nAs one may expect, these solutions generate and are in turn intrinsically\ndependent upon spacetime torsion.\n", "  We report on the pressure evolution of the Fermi surface topology of the Weyl\nsemimetal NbP, probed by Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in the\nmagnetoresistance combined with ab-initio calculations of the band-structure.\nAlthough we observe a drastic effect on the amplitudes of the quantum\noscillations, the frequencies only exhibit a weak pressure dependence up to 2.8\nGPa. The pressure-induce variations in the oscillation frequencies are\nconsistent with our band-structure calculations. Furthermore, we can relate the\nchanges in the amplitudes to small modifications in the shape of the Fermi\nsurface. Our findings evidenced the stability of the electronic band structure\nof NbP and demonstrate the power of combining quantum-oscillation studies and\nband-structure calculations to investigate pressure effects on the\nFermi-surface topology in Weyl semimetals.\n", "  The eclipses of certain types of binary millisecond pulsars (i.e. `black\nwidows' and `redbacks') are often studied using high-time-resolution,\n`beamformed' radio observations. However, they may also be detected in images\ngenerated from interferometric data. As part of a larger imaging project to\ncharacterize the variable and transient sky at radio frequencies <200 MHz, we\nhave blindly detected the redback system PSR J2215+5135 as a variable source of\ninterest with the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR). Using observations with cadences\nof 2 weeks - 6 months, we find preliminary evidence that the eclipse duration\nis frequency dependent ($\\propto \\nu^{-0.4}$), such that the pulsar is eclipsed\nfor longer at lower frequencies, in broad agreement with beamformed studies of\nother similar sources. Furthermore, the detection of the eclipses in imaging\ndata suggests an eclipsing medium that absorbs the pulsed emission, rather than\nscattering it. Our study is also a demonstration of the prospects of finding\npulsars in wide-field imaging surveys with the current generation of\nlow-frequency radio telescopes.\n", "  Since its outburst in 1997 GS 135-64 stayed in quiescence. In June 2015\nrenewed activity of GS 1354-64 was observed. Based on our analysis of energy\nspectra and timing properties obtained from Swift/XRT monitoring data we found\nthat GS 1354-64 stayed in the hard state during the entire outburst. Such a\nhard state only (or \"failed\" outburst) has also been observed in 1997. In\naddition, we analysed an XMM-Newton observation taken on August 6th. We\ncompared variability on long and short time scales using covariance ratio and\nfound that the ratio showed a decrease towards lower energies instead of the\nincrease that has been found in other black hole X-ray binaries. There are now\ntwo sources (H 1743-322 and GS 1354-64) that do not show an increase towards\nlower energies in their covariance ratio. Both sources have been observed\nduring \"failed\" outbursts and showed photon indices much harder than what is\nusually observed in black hole X-ray binaries.\n", "  Solar twins are stars with similar stellar (surface) parameters to the Sun\nthat can have a wide range of ages. This provide an opportunity to analyze the\nvariation of their chemical abundances with age. Nissen (2015) recently\nsuggested that the abundances of the s-process element Y and the\n$\\alpha$-element Mg could be used to estimate stellar ages. This paper aims to\ndetermine with high precision the Y, Mg, and Fe abundances for a sample of 88\nsolar twins that span a broad age range ($0.3-10.0$\\,Gyr) and investigate their\nuse for estimating ages. We obtained high-quality Magellan Inamori Kyocera\nEchelle (MIKE) spectra and determined Y and Mg abundances using equivalent\nwidths and a line-by-line differential method within a 1D LTE framework.\nStellar parameters and iron abundances were measured in Paper I of this series\nfor all stars, but a few (three) required a small revision. The [Y/Mg] ratio\nshows a strong correlation with age. It has a slope of -0.041$\\pm$0.001 dex/Gyr\nand a significance of 41 $\\sigma$. This is in excellent agreement with the\nrelation first proposed by Nissen (2015). We found some outliers that turned\nout to be binaries where mass transfer may have enhanced the yttrium abundance.\nGiven a precise measurement of [Y/Mg] with typical error of 0.02 dex in solar\ntwins, our formula can be used to determine a stellar age with $\\sim$0.8 Gyr\nprecision in the 0 to 10 Gyr range.\n", "  Eclipse timing variations observed from the post common-envelope binary\n(PCEB) NN Ser offer strong evidence in favour of circumbinary planets existing\naround PCEBs. If real, these planets may be accompanied by a disc of dust. We\nhere present the ALMA detection of flux at 1.3 mm from NN Ser, which is likely\ndue to thermal emission from a dust disc of mass $\\sim0.8\\pm0.2\\,M_{\\oplus}$.\nWe performed simulations of the history of NN Ser to determine possible origins\nof this dust, and conclude that the most likely origin is, in fact,\ncommon-envelope material which was not expelled from the system and instead\nformed a circumbinary disc. These discs have been predicted by theory but\npreviously remained undetected. While the presence of this dust does not prove\nthe existence of planets around NN Ser, it adds credibility to the possibility\nof planets forming from common-envelope material in a 'second-generation'\nscenario.\n", "  We have studied vortex pinning and dynamics in a Sr0.6K0.4Fe2As2\nsuperconducting tape with critical current density Jc~0.1 MA/cm2 at 4.2 K and\n10 T. It is found that grain boundary pinning is dominant in the vortex pinning\nmechanism. Furthermore, we observe large density of dislocations which can also\nserve as effective pinning centers. We find that the temperature dependence of\ncritical current density is in agreement with the model of vortices pinned via\nspatial fluctuation of charge carrier mean free path. Magnetic relaxation\nmeasurement indicates that the magnetization depends on time in a logarithmic\nway. The relaxation rate in the low and intermediate temperature region is\nsmall, and it exhibits a weak temperature and field dependence. A crossover\nfrom elastic creep to plastic creep regime is observed. Finally, we conclude a\nvortex phase diagram for the high performance Sr0.6K0.4Fe2As2 superconducting\ntape.\n", "  We investigate the 1.4 GHz radio properties of 92 nearby (z<0.05) ultra hard\nX-ray selected Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) from the Swift Burst Alert\nTelescope (BAT) sample. Through the ultra hard X-ray selection we minimise the\nbiases against obscured or Compton-thick AGN as well as confusion with emission\nderived from star formation that typically affect AGN samples selected from the\nUV, optical and infrared wavelengths. We find that all the objects in our\nsample of nearby, ultra-hard X-ray selected AGN are radio quiet; 83\\% of the\nobjects are classed as high-excitation galaxies (HEGs) and 17\\% as\nlow-excitation galaxies (LEGs). While these low-z BAT sources follow the\nradio--far-infrared correlation in a similar fashion to star forming galaxies,\nour analysis finds that there is still significant AGN contribution in the\nobserved radio emission from these radio quiet AGN. In fact, the majority of\nour BAT sample occupy the same X-ray--radio fundamental plane as have been\nobserved in other samples, which include radio loud AGN --- evidence that the\nobserved radio emission (albeit weak) is connected to the AGN accretion\nmechanism, rather than star formation.\n", "  The \"in-situ\" formation of very wide binaries is hard to explain as their\nphysical separations are beyond the typical size of a collapsing cloud core\n($\\approx$5000-10,000 au). Here we investigate the formation process of such\nsystems. We compute population statistics such as the multiplicity fraction\n(MF), companion-star fraction (CSF) and physical separation distribution of\ncompanions in the $\\beta$-Pictoris moving group (BPMG). We compare previous\nmultiplicity studies in younger and older regions and show that the dynamic\nevolution of a young population with a high degree of primordial multiplicity\ncan lead to a processed separation distribution, similar to the field\npopulation. The evolution of outer components is attributed to the dynamical\nunfolding of higher-order (triple) systems; a natural consequence of which is\nthe formation of wide binaries. We find a strong preference for wide systems to\ncontain three or more components ($>$1000 au: 11 / 14, 10,000 au: 6 / 7). We\nargue that the majority of wide binaries identified in young moving groups are\nprimordial. Under the assumption that stellar populations, within our galaxy,\nhave statistically similar primordial multiplicity, we can infer that the\npaucity of wide binaries in the field is the result of dynamical evolution.\n", "  In the most recent IBIS survey based on observations performed during the\nfirst 1000 orbits of INTEGRAL, are listed 363 high energy emitters firmly\nassociated with AGN, 107 of which are reported here for the first time. We have\nused X-ray data to image the IBIS 90% error circle of all the AGN in the sample\nof 107, in order to obtain the correct X-ray counterparts, locate them with\narcsec accuracy and therefore pinpoint the correct optical counterparts. This\nprocedure has led to the optical and spectral characterization of the entire\nsample. This new set consists of 34 broad line or type 1 AGN, 47 narrow line or\ntype 2 AGN, 18 Blazars and 8 sources of unknown class. These 8 sources have\nbeen associated with AGN from their positional coincidence with\n2MASX/Radio/X-ray sources. Seven high energy emitters have been included since\nthey are considered to be good AGN candidates. Spectral analysis has been\nalready performed on 55 objects and the results from the most recent and/or\nbest statistical measurements have been collected. For the remaining 52\nsources, we report the spectral analysis for the first time in this work. We\nhave been able to obtain the full X-ray coverage of the sample making use of\ndata from Swift/XRT, XMM-Newton and NuSTAR. In addition to the spectral\ncharacterization of the entire sample, this analysis has enabled us to identify\npeculiar sources and by comparing different datasets, highlight flux\nvariability in the 2-10 keV and 20-40 keV bands.\n", "  We investigate the star-forming properties of 1620 X-ray selected AGN host\ngalaxies as a function of their specific X-ray luminosity (i.e., X-ray\nluminosity per unit host stellar mass) -- a proxy of the Eddington ratio. Our\nmotivation is to determine whether there is any evidence of a suppression of\nstar-formation at high Eddington ratios, which may hint toward \"AGN feedback\"\neffects. Star-formation rates (SFRs) are derived from fits to Herschel-measured\nfar-infrared spectral energy distributions, taking into account any\ncontamination from the AGN. Herschel-undetected AGNs are included via stacking\nanalyses to provide average SFRs in bins of redshift and specific X-ray\nluminosity (spanning $0.01 \\lesssim L_{\\rm X}/M_{\\ast} \\lesssim 100~L_{\\odot}\n~M_{\\odot}^{-1}$). After normalising for the effects of mass and redshift\narising from the evolving galaxy main sequence, we find that the SFRs of high\nspecific luminosity AGNs are slightly enhanced compared to their lower specific\nluminosity counterparts. This suggests that the SFR distribution of AGN hosts\nchanges with specific X-ray luminosity, a result reinforced by our finding of a\nsignificantly higher fraction of starbursting hosts among high specific\nluminosity AGNs compared to that of the general star-forming galaxy population\n(i.e., 8-10 per cent vs. 3 per cent). Contrary to our original motivation, our\nfindings suggest that high specific luminosity AGNs are more likely to reside\nin galaxies with enhanced levels of star-formation.\n", "  Within the first 10 days after Swift discovered the jetted tidal disruption\nevent (TDE) Sw J1644+57, simultaneous observations in the radio, near-infrared,\noptical, X-ray and gamma-ray bands were carried out. These multiwavelength data\nprovide a unique opportunity to constrain the emission mechanism and make-up of\na relativistic super-Eddington jet. We consider an exhaustive variety of\nradiation mechanisms for the generation of X-rays in this TDE, and rule out\nmany processes such as SSC, photospheric and proton synchrotron. The infrared\nto gamma-ray data for Sw J1644+57 are consistent with synchrotron and\nexternal-inverse-Compton (EIC) processes provided that electrons in the jet are\ncontinuously accelerated on a time scale shorter than ~1% of the dynamical time\nto maintain a power-law distribution. The requirement of continuous electron\nacceleration points to magnetic reconnection in a Poynting flux dominated jet.\nThe EIC process may require fine tuning to explain the observed temporal decay\nof the X-ray lightcurve, whereas the synchrotron process in a magnetic jet\nneeds no fine tuning for this TDE.\n", "  Using VLT/X-shooter we searched for emission line galaxies associated to four\ndamped Lyman-$\\alpha$ systems (DLAs) and one sub-DLA at 2.73<=z<=3.25 towards\nQSO J2358+0149. We detect [O III] emission from a \"low-cool\" DLA at z_abs =\n2.9791 (having log N(HI)=21.69+\\-0.10, [Zn/H] = -1.83+\\-0.18) at an impact\nparameter of, $\\rho$ ~12 kpc. The associated galaxy is compact with a dynamical\nmass of (1-6)x10^9 M_solar, very high excitation ([O III]/[O II] and [O\nIII]/[H$\\beta$] both greater than 10), 12+[O/H]<=8.5 and moderate star\nformation rate (SFR <=2 M_solar yr^{-1}). Such properties are typically seen in\nthe low-z extreme blue compact dwarf galaxies. The kinematics of the gas is\ninconsistent with that of an extended disk and the gas is part of either a\nlarge scale wind or cold accretion. We detect Ly$\\alpha$ emission from the\nz_abs = 3.2477 DLA (having log N(HI)=21.12+\\-0.10 and [Zn/H]=-0.97+\\-0.13).The\nLy$\\alpha$ emission is redshifted with respect to the metal absorption lines by\n320 km s^{-1}, consistent with the location of the red hump expected in\nradiative transport models. We derive SFR ~0.2-1.7 M_solar yr^{-1} and\nLy$\\alpha$ escape fraction of >=10 per cent. No other emission line is detected\nfrom this system. Because the DLA has a small velocity separation from the\nquasar (~500 km s^{-1}) and the DLA emission is located within a small\nprojected distance ($\\rho<5$ kpc), we also explore the possibility that the\nLy$\\alpha$ emission is being induced by the QSO itself. QSO induced Ly$\\alpha$\nfluorescence is possible if the DLA is within a physical separation of 340 kpc\nto the QSO. Detection of stellar continuum light and/or the oxygen emission\nlines would disfavor this possibility. We do not detect any emission line from\nthe remaining three systems.\n", "  We use scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy to investigate\nstructural and electronic properties of tetracyanonaphtho-quinodimethane (TNAP)\nbased metal-organic networks on a superconducting Pb(111) surface. At low\ntemperatures, the TNAP molecules form densely packed islands. When deposited at\nroom temperature, Pb adatoms are incorporated into fourfold bonding nodes with\nthe TNAP molecules leading to long-range ordered porous structures.\nCo-deposition of NaCl with TNAP yields a Na source for an ionically bonded\nNa-TNAP structure. Fourfold bonding motifs are also created by Fe atoms with\nthe cyano terminations of TNAP. However, the structures are irregular and do\nnot sustain the formation of long-range ordered networks. Some Fe centers with\nmolecules surrounded in a local C2 symmetry exhibit Shiba states as a\nfingerprint of a magnetic interaction with the superconducting surface.\n", "  In this paper we study the effects of white-noised potentials on nonlinear\nquantum tunneling. We use a split-step scheme to numerically solve the\nnonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLSE) with a tunneling potential. We consider\nthree different types of potentials, namely; the single rectangular barrier,\ndouble rectangular barrier and triangular barrier. For all these three cases we\nshow that white-noise given to potentials do not trigger modulation instability\nfor tunneling of the sech type soliton solutions of the NLSE. However\nwhite-noised potentials trigger modulation instability for tunneling of the\nsinusoidal wavefunctions, thus such a wavefield turns into a chaotic one with\nmany apparent peaks. We argue that peaks of such a field may be in the form of\nrational rogue wave solutions of the NLSE. Our results can be used to examine\nthe effects of noise on quantum tunneling. Since a rogue wavefunction means a\nhigher probability of the tunneling particle to be at a given (x,t) coordinate,\nour results may also be used for developing the quantum science and technology\nwith many possible applications including but are not limited to increasing the\nresolution and efficiency of scanning tunneling microscopes, enhancing proton\ntunneling for DNA mutation and enhancing superconducting properties of\njunctions.\n", "  Recent studies have found that obscured quasars cluster more strongly and are\nthus hosted by dark matter haloes of larger mass than their unobscured\ncounterparts. These results pose a challenge for the simplest unification\nmodels, in which obscured objects are intrinsically the same as unobscured\nsources but seen through a dusty line of sight. There is general consensus that\na structure like a \"dusty torus\" exists, meaning that this intrinsic similarity\nis likely the case for at least some subset of obscured quasars. However, the\nlarger host halo masses of obscured quasars implies that there is a second\nobscured population that has an even higher clustering amplitude and typical\nhalo mass. Here, we use simple assumptions about the host halo mass\ndistributions of quasars, along with analytical methods and cosmological\n$N$-body simulations to isolate the signal from this population. We provide\nvalues for the bias and halo mass as a function of the fraction of the\n\"non-torus obscured\" population. Adopting a reasonable value for this fraction\nof $\\sim$25% implies a non-torus obscured quasar bias that is much higher than\nthe observed obscured quasar bias, because a large fraction of the obscured\npopulation shares the same clustering strength as the unobscured objects. For\nthis non-torus obscured population, we derive a bias of $\\sim$3, and typical\nhalo masses of $\\sim3\\times10^{13}$ M$_{\\odot}/h$ at $z=1$. These massive\nhaloes are likely the descendants of high-mass unobscured quasars at high\nredshift, and will evolve into members of galaxy groups at $z=0$.\n", "  We propose and examine the use of biphoton pairs, such as those created in\nparametric down conversion or four-wave mixing, to enhance the precision and\nthe resolution of measuring optical displacements by position-sensitive\ndetection. We show that the precision of measuring a small optical beam\ndisplacement with this method can be significantly enhanced by the correlation\nbetween the two photons, given the same optical mode. The improvement is\nlargest if the correlations between the photons are strong, and falls off as\nthe biphoton correlation weakens. More surprisingly, we find that the smallest\nresolvable parameter of a simple split detector scales as the inverse of the\nnumber of biphotons for small biphoton number (\"Heisenberg scaling\"), because\nthe Fisher information diverges as the parameter to be estimated decreases in\nvalue. One usually sees this scaling only for systems with many entangled\ndegrees of freedom. We discuss the transition for the split-detection scheme to\nthe standard quantum limit scaling for imperfect correlations as the biphoton\nnumber is increased. An analysis of an $N$-pixel detector is also given to\ninvestigate the benefit of using a higher resolution detector. The physical\nlimit of these metrology schemes is determined by the uncertainty in the birth\nzone of the biphoton in the nonlinear crystal.\n", "  There are two theories of stellar spiral arms in isolated disc galaxies that\nmodel stellar spiral arms with different longevities: quasi-stationary density\nwave theory, which characterises spirals as rigidly rotating, long-lived\npatterns (i.e. steady spirals), and dynamic spiral theory, which characterises\nspirals as differentially rotating, transient, recurrent patterns (i.e. dynamic\nspirals). In order to discriminate between these two spiral models\nobservationally, we investigated the differences between the gas velocity\npatterns predicted by these two spiral models in hydrodynamic simulations. We\nfound that the azimuthal phases of the velocity patterns relative to the gas\ndensity peaks (i.e. gaseous arms) differ between the two models, as do the gas\nflows; nevertheless, the velocity patterns themselves are similar for both\nmodels. Such similarity suggests that the mere existence of streaming motions\ndoes not conclusively confirm the steady spiral model. However, we found that\nthe steady spiral model shows that the gaseous arms have radial streaming\nmotions well inside the co-rotation radius, whereas the dynamic spiral model\npredicts that the gaseous arms tend to have tangential streaming motions. These\ndifferences suggest that the gas velocity patterns around spiral arms will\nenable distinction between the spiral theories.\n", "  We study the dramatic decrease in iron absorption strength in the iron\nlow-ionization broad absorption line quasar SDSS J084133.15+200525.8. We report\non the continued weakening of absorption in the prototype of this class of\nvariable broad absorption line quasar, FBQS J140806.2+305448. We also report a\nthird example of this class, SDSS J123103.70+392903.6; unlike the other two\nexamples, it has undergone an increase in observed continuum brightness (at\n3000~\\AA\\ rest-frame) as well as a decrease in iron absorption strength. These\nchanges could be caused by absorber transverse motion or by ionization\nvariability. We note that the \\mgii\\ and UV \\feii\\ lines in several FeLoBAL\nquasars are blueshifted by thousands of \\kms\\ relative to the \\Hb\\ emission\nline peak. We suggest that such emission arises in the outflowing winds\nnormally seen only in absorption.\n"]}
