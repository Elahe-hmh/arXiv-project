We demonstrate a coupling\nbetween the cloaked and uncloaked regions, exposing a difference between\ncloaking for rays and waves. Interior resonances allow this coupling to be\namplified, and careful choice of parameters leads to effective cloaks with\ndegraded shielding. As one application, we describe how to use transformation\noptics to hide sensors in the cloaked region and yet enable the sensors to\nefficiently measure waves incident on the exterior of the cloak, an effect\nsimilar to the plasmon based approach of Alu' and Engheta.\n", "  We present near-UV transmission spectroscopy of the highly irradiated\ntransiting exoplanet WASP-12b, obtained with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on\nthe Hubble Space Telescope. The spectra cover three distinct wavelength ranges:\nNUVA (2539-2580 {\\AA}), NUVB (2655-2696 {\\AA}), and NUVC (2770-2811 {\\AA}).\nThree independent methods all reveal enhanced transit depths attributable to\nabsorption by resonance lines of metals in the exosphere of WASP-12b. Light\ncurves of total counts in the NUVA and NUVC wavelength ranges show a detection\nat a 2.5{\\sigma} level. We detect extra absorption in the Mg II\n{\\lambda}{\\lambda}2800 resonance line cores at the 2.8{\\sigma} level. The NUVA,\nNUVB, and NUVC light curves imply effective radii of 2.69+/-0.24 RJ,\n2.18+/-0.18 RJ, and 2.66+/-0.22 RJ respectively, suggesting the planet is\nsurrounded by an absorbing cloud which overfills the Roche lobe. We detect\nenhanced transit depths at the wavelengths of resonance lines of neutral\nsodium, tin, and manganese, and at singly ionized ytterbium, scandium,\nmanganese, aluminum, vanadium, and magnesium. We also find the statistically\nexpected number of anomalous transit depths at wavelengths not associated with\nany known resonance line. Our data are limited by photon noise, but taken as a\nwhole the results are strong evidence for an extended absorbing exosphere\nsurrounding the planet. The NUVA data exhibit an early ingress, contrary to\nmodel expectations; we speculate this could be due to the presence of a disk of\npreviously stripped material.\n", "  The advent of transformation optics and metamaterials has made possible\ndevices producing extreme effects on wave propagation. Here we give theoretical\ndesigns for devices, Schr\\\"odinger hats, acting as invisible concentrators of\nwaves. These exist for any wave phenomenon modeled by either the Helmholtz or\nSchr\\\"odinger equations, e.g., polarized waves in EM, pressure waves in\nacoustics and matter waves in QM, and occupy one part of a parameter space\ncontinuum of wave-manipulating structures which also contains standard\ntransformation optics based cloaks, resonant cloaks and cloaked sensors. For EM\nand acoustic Schr\\\"odinger hats, the resulting centralized wave is a localized\nexcitation. In QM, the result is a new charged quasiparticle, a \\emph{quasmon},\nwhich causes conditional probabilistic illusions. We discuss possible solid\nstate implementations.\n", "  It was recently reported that there may exist monochromatic $\\gamma$-ray\nemission at $\\sim 130$ GeV from the Galactic center in the Fermi Large Area\nTelescope data, which might be related with dark matter (DM) annihilation. In\nthis work we carry out a comprehensive check of consistency of the results with\nthe DM annihilation scenario, using the 3.7 yrs Fermi observation of the inner\nGalaxy, Galactic halo, clusters of galaxies and dwarf galaxies. The results\nfound are as follows. 1) Very strong constraints on the DM annihilation into\ncontinuous $\\gamma$-rays from the Galactic center are set, which are as\nstringent as the \"natural\" scale assuming thermal freeze-out of DM. Such limit\nsets strong constraint on the DM models to explain the line emission. 2) No\nline emission from the Galactic halo is found in the Fermi data, and the\nconstraints on line emission is marginally consistent with the DM annihilation\ninterpretation of the $\\sim 130$ GeV line emission from the inner Galaxy. 3) No\nline emission from galaxy clusters and dwarf galaxies is detected, although\npossible concentration of photons from clusters in 120-140 GeV is revealed. The\nconstraints from clusters and dwarf galaxies are weak and consistent with the\nDM annihilation scenario to explain the $\\sim 130$ GeV line emission.\n", "  We consider the unique infinite connected component of supercritical bond\npercolation on the square lattice and study the geometric properties of\nisoperimetric sets, i.e., sets with minimal boundary for a given volume. For\nalmost every realization of the infinite connected component we prove that, as\nthe volume of the isoperimetric set tends to infinity, its asymptotic shape can\nbe characterized by an isoperimetric problem in the plane with respect to a\nparticular norm. As an application we then show that the anchored isoperimetric\nprofile with respect to a given point as well as the Cheeger constant of the\ngiant component in finite boxes scale to deterministic quantities. This settles\na conjecture of Itai Benjamini for the plane.\n", "  Our understanding of magnetic fields in late-type stars is strongly driven by\nwhat we know of the solar magnetic field. For this reason, it is crucial to\nunderstand how typical the solar dynamo is. To do this we need to compare the\nsolar magnetic field with that of other stars as similar to the Sun as\npossible, both in stellar parameters and age, hence activity. We present here\nthe detection of a magnetic field in three planet-hosting solar-like stars\nhaving a mass, age, and activity level comparable to that of the Sun. We used\nthe HARPSpol spectropolarimeter to obtain high-resolution high-quality\ncircularly polarised spectra of HD 70642, HD 117207, and HD 154088, using the\nLeast-Squares Deconvolution technique to detect the magnetic field. From the\nStokes I spectra, we calculated the logR activity index for each star. We\ncompared the position of the stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram to\nevolutionary tracks, to estimate their mass and age. We used the lithium\nabundance, derived from the Stokes I spectra, to further constrain the ages. We\nobtained a definite magnetic field detection for both HD 70642 and HD 154088,\nwhile for HD 117207 we obtained a marginal detection. Due to the lower\nsignal-to-noise ratio of the observations, we were unable to detect the\nmagnetic field in the second set of observations available for HD 117207 and HD\n154088. On the basis of effective temperature, mass, age, and activity level\nthe three stars can be considered solar analogs. HD 70642, HD 117207, and HD\n154088 are ideal targets for a comparative study between the solar magnetic\nfield and that of solar analogs.\n", "  Near-UV observations of the planet host star WASP-12 uncovered the apparent\nabsence of the normally conspicuous core emission of the Mg2 h&k resonance\nlines. This anomaly could be due either to (1) a lack of stellar activity,\nwhich would be unprecedented for a solar-like star of the imputed age of\nWASP-12; or (2) extrinsic absorption, from the intervening interstellar medium\n(ISM) or from material within the WASP-12 system itself, presumably ablated\nfrom the extreme hot Jupiter WASP-12b. HIRES archival spectra of the Ca2 H&K\nlines of WASP-12 show broad depressions in the line cores, deeper than those of\nother inactive and similarly distant stars and similar to WASP-12's Mg2 h&k\nline profiles. We took high resolution ESPADONS and FIES spectra of three\nearly-type stars within 20' of WASP-12 and at similar distances, which show the\nISM column is insufficient to produce the broad Ca2 depression observed in\nWASP-12. The EBHIS H1 column density map supports and strengthens this\nconclusion. Extrinsic absorption by material local to the WASP-12 system is\ntherefore the most likely cause of the line core anomalies. Gas escaping from\nthe heavily irradiated planet could form a stable and thick circumstellar\ndisk/cloud. The anomalously low stellar activity index (logR'HK) of WASP-12 is\nevidently a direct consequence of the extra core absorption, so similar HK\nindex deficiencies might signal the presence of translucent circumstellar gas\naround other stars hosting evaporating planets.\n", "  Weighted least squares fitting to a database of quantum mechanical\ncalculations can determine the optimal parameters of empirical potential\nmodels. While algorithms exist to provide optimal potential parameters for a\ngiven fitting database of structures and their structure property functions,\nand to estimate prediction errors using Bayesian sampling, defining an optimal\nfitting database based on potential predictions remains elusive. A testing set\nof structures and their structure property functions provides an empirical\nmeasure of potential transferability. Here, we propose an objective function\nfor fitting databases based on testing set errors. The objective function\nallows the optimization of the weights in a fitting database, the assessment of\nthe inclusion or removal of structures in the fitting database, or the\ncomparison of two different fitting databases. To showcase this technique, we\nconsider an example Lennard-Jones potential for Ti, where modeling multiple\ncomplicated crystal structures is difficult for a radial pair potential. The\nalgorithm finds different optimal fitting databases, depending on the objective\nfunction of potential prediction error for a testing set.\n", "  We consider random Schr\\\"odinger operators of the form $\\Delta+\\xi$, where\n$\\Delta$ is the lattice Laplacian on $\\mathbb Z^d$ and $\\xi$ is an i.i.d.\nrandom field, and study the extreme order statistics of the eigenvalues for\nthis operator restricted to large but finite subsets of $\\mathbb Z^d$. We show\nthat for $\\xi$ with a doubly-exponential type of upper tail, the upper extreme\norder statistics of the eigenvalues falls into the Gumbel max-order class. The\ncorresponding eigenfunctions are exponentially localized in regions where $\\xi$\ntakes large, and properly arranged, values. A new and self-contained argument\nis thus provided for Anderson localization at the spectral edge which permits a\nrather explicit description of the shape of the potential and the\neigenfunctions. Our study serves as an input into the analysis of an associated\nparabolic Anderson problem.\n", "  Conventional quantum error correcting codes require multiple rounds of\nmeasurements to detect errors with enough confidence in fault-tolerant\nscenarios. Here I show that for suitable topological codes a single round of\nlocal measurements is enough. This feature is generic and is related to\nself-correction and confinement phenomena in the corresponding quantum\nHamiltonian model. 3D gauge color codes exhibit this single-shot feature, which\napplies also to initialization and gauge-fixing. Assuming the time for\nefficient classical computations negligible, this yields a topological\nfault-tolerant quantum computing scheme where all elementary logical operations\ncan be performed in constant time.\n", "  A late accelerated expansion of the Universe is obtained from\nnon-relativistic particles with a short-range attractive interaction, and low\nenough temperature to produce a Bose-Einstein condensate; by considering\ncoupled dark-energy particles, energy is interchanged with dark matter,\nallowing it to describe recent acceleration by strengthening its effect. We\nshow that for a sizable range of parameters, dark energy and dark matter evolve\nwith similar energy densities, solving the coincidence problem, and in\nagreement with the luminosity distance vs redshift, derived from supernova\ndata.\n", "  Only the \"anti-Ito\" integral yields the correct shift of the mean, by the\nfact that the elements of its Riemannian sum hold in the order O(dt) rather\nthan only in O(sqrt dt). The corresponding \"full\" Fokker-Planck equation is\nparticularly simple and the only one applying for Brownian motion with an\narbitrary friction law. The \"full\" backward equation coincides with it in the\nnoise contribution.\n", "  Nonclassical states of light are an important resource in today's quantum\ncommunication and metrology protocols. Quantum up-conversion of nonclassical\nstates is a promising approach to overcome frequency differences between\ndisparate subsystems within a quantum information network. Here, we present the\ngeneration of heralded narrowband single photons at 1550 nm via cavity enhanced\nspontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) and their subsequent up-conversion\nto 532 nm. Quantum non-Gaussianity (QNG), which is an important feature for\napplications in quantum information science, was experimentally certified for\nthe first time in frequency up-converted states.\n", "  The application of effective field theory (EFT) methods to nuclear systems\nprovides the opportunity to rigorously estimate the uncertainties originating\nin the nuclear Hamiltonian. Yet this is just one source of uncertainty in the\nobservables predicted by calculations based on nuclear EFTs. We discuss the\ngoals of uncertainty quantification in such calculations and outline a recipe\nto obtain statistically meaningful error bars for their predictions. We argue\nthat the different sources of theory error can be accounted for within a\nBayesian framework, as we illustrate using a toy model.\n", "  For a densely defined self-adjoint operator $\\mathcal{H}$ in Hilbert space\n$\\mathcal{F}$ the operator $\\exp(-it\\mathcal{H})$ is the evolution operator for\nthe Schr\\\"odinger equation $i\\psi'_t=\\mathcal{H}\\psi$, i.e. if\n$\\psi(0,x)=\\psi_0(x)$ then $\\psi(t,x)=(\\exp(-it\\mathcal{H})\\psi_0)(x)$ for\n$x\\in Q.$ The space $\\mathcal{F}$ here is the space of wave functions $\\psi$\ndefined on an abstract space $Q$, the configuration space of a quantum system,\nand $\\mathcal{H}$ is the Hamiltonian of the system. In this paper the operator\n$\\exp(-it\\mathcal{H})$ for all real values of $t$ is expressed in terms of the\nfamily of self-adjoint bounded operators $S(t), t\\geq 0$, which is\nChernoff-tangent to the operator $-\\mathcal{H}$. One can take\n$S(t)=\\exp(-t\\mathcal{H})$, or use other, simple families $S$ that are listed\nin the paper. The main theorem is proven on the level of semigroups of bounded\noperators in $\\mathcal{F}$ so it can be used in a wider context due to its\ngenerality. Two examples of application are provided.\n", "  In this paper we study the Brauer loop model on a strip and the associated\nquantum Knizhnik--Zamolodchikov (qKZ) equation. We show that the minimal degree\nsolution of the Brauer qKZ equation with one of four different possible\nboundary conditions, gives the multidegrees of the irreducible components of\ngeneralizations of the Brauer loop scheme of [Knutson--Zinn-Justin '07] with\none of four kinds of symplectic-type symmetry. This is accomplished by studying\nthese irreducible components, which are indexed by link patterns, and\ndescribing the geometric action of Brauer generators on them. We also provide\nrecurrence relations for the multidegrees and compute the sum rules\n(multidegrees of the whole schemes).\n", "  Topological stabilizer codes with different spatial dimensions have\ncomplementary properties. Here I show that the spatial dimension can be\nswitched using gauge fixing. Combining 2D and 3D gauge color codes in a 3D\nqubit lattice, fault-tolerant quantum computation can be achieved with constant\ntime overhead on the number of logical gates, up to efficient global classical\ncomputation, using only local quantum operations. Single-shot error correction\nplays a crucial role.\n", "  We discovered fine-scale structure within the scattering disk of PSR B0329+54\nin observations with the RadioAstron ground-space radio interferometer. Here,\nwe describe this phenomenon, characterize it with averages and correlation\nfunctions, and interpret it as the result of decorrelation of the\nimpulse-response function of interstellar scattering between the\nwidely-separated antennas. This instrument included the 10-m Space Radio\nTelescope, the 110-m Green Bank Telescope, the 14x25-m Westerbork Synthesis\nRadio Telescope, and the 64-m Kalyazin Radio Telescope. The observations were\nperformed at 324 MHz, on baselines of up to 235,000 km in November 2012 and\nJanuary 2014. In the delay domain, on long baselines the interferometric\nvisibility consists of many discrete spikes within a limited range of delays.\nOn short baselines it consists of a sharp spike surrounded by lower spikes. The\naverage envelope of correlations of the visibility function show two\nexponential scales, with characteristic delays of $\\tau_1=4.1\\pm 0.3\\ \\mu{\\rm\ns}$ and $\\tau_2=23\\pm 3\\ \\mu{\\rm s}$, indicating the presence of two scales of\nscattering in the interstellar medium. These two scales are present in the\npulse-broadening function. The longer scale contains 0.38 times the scattered\npower of the shorter one. We suggest that the longer tail arises from\nhighly-scattered paths, possibly from anisotropic scattering or from\nsubstructure at large angles.\n", "  We investigate the number of nodal intersections of random Gaussian Laplace\neigenfunctions on the standard three-dimensional flat torus with a fixed smooth\nreference curve, which has nowhere vanishing curvature. The expected\nintersection number is universally proportional to the length of the reference\ncurve, times the wavenumber, independent of the geometry. Our main result gives\na bound for the variance, if either the torsion of the curve is nowhere zero or\nif the curve is planar.\n", "  We propose a multiscale mechanobiological model of bone remodelling to\ninvestigate the site-specific evolution of bone volume fraction across the\nmidshaft of a femur. The model includes hormonal regulation and biochemical\ncoupling of bone cell populations, the influence of the microstructure on bone\nturnover rate, and mechanical adaptation of the tissue. Both microscopic and\ntissue-scale stress/strain states of the tissue are calculated from macroscopic\nloads by a combination of beam theory and micromechanical homogenisation.\n  This model is applied to simulate the spatio-temporal evolution of a human\nmidshaft femur scan subjected to two deregulating circumstances: (i)\nosteoporosis and (ii) mechanical disuse. Both simulated deregulations led to\nendocortical bone loss, cortical wall thinning and expansion of the medullary\ncavity, in accordance with experimental findings. Our model suggests that these\nobservations are attributable to a large extent to the influence of the\nmicrostructure on bone turnover rate. Mechanical adaptation is found to help\npreserve intracortical bone matrix near the periosteum. Moreover, it leads to\nnon-uniform cortical wall thickness due to the asymmetry of macroscopic loads\nintroduced by the bending moment. The effect of mechanical adaptation near the\nendosteum can be greatly affected by whether the mechanical stimulus includes\nstress concentration effects or not.\n", "  Quantum metrology utilizes nonclassical states to improve the precision of\nmeasurement devices. In this context, strongly squeezed vacuum states of light\nhave proven to be a useful resource. They are typically produced by spontaneous\nparametric down-conversion, but have not been generated at shorter wavelengths\nso far, as suitable nonlinear materials do not exist. Here, we report on the\ngeneration of strongly squeezed vacuum states at 532 nm with 5.5 dB noise\nsuppression by means of frequency up-conversion from the telecommunication\nwavelength of 1550 nm. The up-converted states are employed in a model\nMach-Zehnder interferometer to illustrate their use in quantum metrology.\n", "  Tunka-Rex is the radio extension of the Tunka cosmic-ray observatory in\nSiberia close to Lake Baikal. Since October 2012 Tunka-Rex measures the radio\nsignal of air-showers in coincidence with the non-imaging air-Cherenkov array\nTunka-133. Furthermore, this year additional antennas will go into operation\ntriggered by the new scintillator array Tunka-Grande measuring the secondary\nelectrons and muons of air showers. Tunka-Rex is a demonstrator for how\neconomic an antenna array can be without losing significant performance: we\nhave decided for simple and robust SALLA antennas, and we share the existing\nDAQ running in slave mode with the PMT detectors and the scintillators,\nrespectively. This means that Tunka-Rex is triggered externally, and does not\nneed its own infrastructure and DAQ for hybrid measurements. By this, the\nperformance and the added value of the supplementary radio measurements can be\nstudied, in particular, the precision for the reconstructed energy and the\nshower maximum in the energy range of approximately $10^{17}-10^{18}\\,$eV. Here\nwe show first results on the energy reconstruction indicating that radio\nmeasurements can compete with air-Cherenkov measurements in precision.\nMoreover, we discuss future plans for Tunka-Rex.\n", "  The importance of non-perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics [QCD] parameters is\ndiscussed in context to the predicting power for bottom meson masses and\nisospin splitting. In the framework of heavy quark effective theory, the work\npresented here focuses on the different allowed values of the two non\nperturbative QCD parameters used in heavy quark effective theory formula and\nusing the best fitted parameter, masses of the excited bottom meson states in\nJP=(1/2)+ doublet in strange as well as non-strange sector are calculated here.\nThe calculated masses are found to be matching well with experiments and other\nphenomenological models. The mass and hyperfine splitting has also been\nanalyzed for both strange and non-strange heavy mesons with respect to spin and\nflavor symmetries.\n", "  Photodetectors play key roles in many applications such as remote sensing,\nnight vision, reconnaissance, medical imaging, thermal imaging, and chemical\ndetection. Several properties such as performance, reliability, ease of\nintegration, cost, weight, and form factor are all important in determining the\nattributes of photodetectors for particular applications. While a number of\nmaterials have been used over the past several decades to address\nphotodetection needs across the electromagnetic spectrum, the advent of\nnanomaterials opens new possibilities for photodetectors. In particular,\ncarbon-based nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene possess\nunique properties that have recently been explored for photodetectors. Here, we\nreview the status of the field, presenting a broad coverage of the different\ntypes of photodetectors that have been realized with CNTs, placing particular\nemphasis on the types of mechanisms that govern their operation. We present a\ncomparative summary of the main performance metrics for such detectors, and an\noutlook for performance improvements.\n", "  We show that the effective field equations for a recently formulated\npolynomial affine model of gravity, in the sector of a torsion-free connection,\naccept general Einstein manifolds---with or without cosmological constant---as\nsolutions. Moreover, the effective field equations are partially those obtained\nfrom a gravitational Yang--Mills theory known as Stephenson--Kilmister--Yang\ntheory. Additionally, we find a generalization of a minimally coupled massless\nscalar field in General Relativity within a \"minimally\" coupled scalar field in\nthis affine model. Finally, we present a brief analysis of the propagators of\nthe gravitational theory, and count the degrees of freedom. For completeness we\nprove that a Birkhoff-like theorem is valid for the analyzed sector.\n", "  We show that the Schr\\\"odinger and Klein-Gordon equations can both be derived\nfrom an Hypergeometric differential equation. The same applies to non linear\ngeneralizations of these equations.\n", "  The connection between symmetries and conservation laws as made by Noether's\ntheorem is extended to the context of causal variational principles and causal\nfermion systems. Different notions of continuous symmetries are introduced. It\nis proven that these symmetries give rise to corresponding conserved\nquantities, expressed in terms of so-called surface layer integrals. In a\nsuitable limiting case, the Noether-like theorems for causal fermion systems\nreproduce charge conservation and the conservation of energy and momentum in\nMinkowski space. Thus the conservation of charge and energy-momentum are found\nto be special cases of general conservation laws which are intrinsic to causal\nfermion systems.\n", "  The energy dissipation mechanism within Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) outflows,\ndriving their extremely luminous prompt $\\gamma$-ray emission is still\nuncertain. The leading candidates are internal shocks and magnetic\nreconnection. While the emission from internal shocks has been extensively\nstudied, that from reconnection still has few quantitative predictions. We\nstudy the expected prompt-GRB emission from magnetic reconnection and compare\nits temporal and spectral properties to observations. The main difference from\ninternal shocks is that for reconnection one expects relativistic bulk motions\nwith Lorentz factors $\\Gamma'\\gtrsim\\;$a few in the jet's bulk frame. We\nconsider such motions of the emitting material in two anti-parallel directions\n(e.g. of the reconnecting magnetic-field lines) within an ultra-relativistic\n(with $\\Gamma\\gg1$) thin spherical reconnection layer. The emission's\nrelativistic beaming in the jet's frame greatly affects the light-curves. For\nemission at radii $R_0<R<R_0+\\Delta{}R$ (with $\\Gamma=\\rm{const}$) the observed\npulse width is $\\Delta{}T\\sim(R_0/2c\\Gamma^2)\\max(1/\\Gamma',\\,\\Delta{}R/R_0)$,\ni.e. up to $\\sim\\Gamma'$ times shorter than for isotropic emission in the jet's\nframe. We consider two possible magnetic reconnection modes: a quasi\nsteady-state with continuous plasma flow into and out of the reconnection\nlayer, and sporadic reconnection in relativistic turbulence that produces\nrelativistic plasmoids. Both of these modes can account for many observed\nprompt-GRB properties: variability, pulse asymmetry, the very rapid declines at\ntheir end, and pulse evolutions that are either hard to soft (for\n$\\Gamma'\\lesssim2$) or intensity tracking (for $\\Gamma'>2$). However, the\nrelativistic turbulence mode is more likely to be relevant for the prompt\nsub-MeV emission and can naturally account also for the peak\nluminosity$\\,$--$\\,$peak frequency correlation.\n", "  The interference between resonance signal and continuum background can be\neither constructive or destructive, depending on the relative sign of couplings\nbetween the signal and background amplitudes. Different interference schemes\nlead to asymmetric distortions of the resonance line shape, which could be\ndistinguished in experiments, when the internal resonance width is larger than\nthe detector resolution. Interpreting the ATLAS diboson excesses by means of a\ntoy $W'$ model as an illustrative example (though it is disfavored by the 13\nTeV data), we find that the signs of resonance couplings can only be revealed\nin the line shape measurements up to a high confidence level at a high\nluminosity, which could bring us further information on the underlying theory\nbeyond resonance searches at future lepton and hadron colliders.\n", "  Jets coexist with planetary scale waves in the turbulence of planetary\natmospheres. The coherent component of these structures arises from cooperative\ninteraction between the coherent structures and the incoherent small-scale\nturbulence in which they are embedded. It follows that theoretical\nunderstanding of the dynamics of jets and planetary scale waves requires\nadopting the perspective of statistical state dynamics (SSD) which comprises\nthe dynamics of the interaction between coherent and incoherent components in\nthe turbulent state. In this work the S3T implementation of SSD for barotropic\nbeta-plane turbulence is used to develop a theory for the jet/wave coexistence\nregime by separating the coherent motions consisting of the zonal jets together\nwith a selection of large-scale waves from the smaller scale motions which\nconstitute the incoherent component. It is found that mean flow/turbulence\ninteraction gives rise to jets that coexist with large-scale coherent waves in\na synergistic manner. Large-scale waves that would only exist as damped modes\nin the laminar jet are found to be transformed into exponentially growing waves\nby interaction with the incoherent small scale turbulence which results in a\nchange in the mode structure allowing the mode to tap the energy of the mean\njet. This mechanism of destabilization differs fundamentally and serves to\naugment the more familiar S3T instabilities in which jets and waves arise from\nhomogeneous turbulence with energy source exclusively from the incoherent eddy\nfield and provides further insight into the cooperative dynamics of the\njet/waves coexistence regime in planetary turbulence.\n", "  We propose an algorithm for the orthogonal fast discrete spherical Bessel\ntransform on an uniform grid. Our approach is based upon the spherical Bessel\ntransform factorization into the two subsequent orthogonal transforms, namely\nthe fast Fourier transform and the orthogonal transform founded on the\nderivatives of the discrete Legendre orthogonal polynomials. The method utility\nis illustrated by its implementation for the numerical solution of the\nthree-dimensional time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation.\n", "  Entanglement drives nearly all proposed quantum information technologies. By\nup-converting part of a 1550 nm two-mode squeezed vacuum state to 532 nm, we\ndemonstrate the generation of strong continuous-variable entanglement between\nwidely separated frequencies. Nonclassical correlations were observed in joint\nquadrature measurements of the 1550 and 532 nm fields, showing a maximum noise\nsuppression 5.5 dB below vacuum. Our versatile technique combines strong\nnonclassical correlations, large bandwidth, and in principle, the ability to\nentangle the telecommunication wavelength of 1550 nm with any optical\nwavelength.\n", "  The chromospheric activity index logR'HK of stars hosting transiting hot\nJupiters appears to be correlated with the planets' surface gravity. One of the\npossible explanations is based on the presence of condensations of planetary\nevaporated material located in a circumstellar cloud that absorbs the CaII H&K\nand MgII h&k resonance line emission flux, used to measure chromospheric\nactivity. A larger column density in the condensations, or equivalently a\nstronger absorption in the chromospheric lines, is obtained when the\nevaporation rate of the planet is larger, which occurs for a lower gravity of\nthe planet. We analyze here a sample of stars hosting transiting hot Jupiters\ntuned in order to minimize systematic effects (e.g., interstellar medium\nabsorption). Using a mixture model, we find that the data are best fit by a\ntwo-linear-regression model. We interpret this result in terms of the\nVaughan-Preston gap. We use a Monte Carlo approach to best take into account\nthe uncertainties, finding that the two intercepts fit the observed peaks of\nthe distribution of logR'HK for main-sequence solar-like stars. We also find\nthat the intercepts are correlated with the slopes, as predicted by the model\nbased on the condensations of planetary evaporated material. Our findings bring\nfurther support to this model, although we cannot firmly exclude different\nexplanations. A precise determination of the slopes of the two linear\ncomponents would allow one to estimate the average effective stellar flux\npowering planetary evaporation, which can then be used for theoretical\npopulation and evolution studies of close-in planets.\n", "  We review recent studies dealing with the generation of machine learning\nmodels of molecular and solid properties. The models are trained and validated\nusing standard quantum chemistry results obtained for organic molecules and\nmaterials selected from chemical space at random.\n", "  We discuss how the ghost-free bigravity coupled with a single scalar field\ncan be derived from a braneworld setup. We consider DGP two-brane model without\nradion stabilization. The bulk configuration is solved for given boundary\nmetrics, and it is substituted back into the action to obtain the effective\nfour-dimensional action. In order to obtain the ghost-free bigravity, we\nconsider the gradient expansion in which the brane separation is supposed to be\nsufficiently small so that two boundary metrics are almost identical. The\nobtained effective theory is shown to be ghost free as expected, however, the\ninteraction between two gravitons takes the Fierz-Pauli form at the leading\norder of the gradient expansion, even though we do not use the approximation of\nlinear perturbation. We also find that the radion remains as a scalar field in\nthe four-dimensional effective theory, but its coupling to the metrics is\nnon-trivial.\n", "  The demonstration and use of Bell-nonlocality, a concept that is\nfundamentally striking and is at the core of applications in device independent\nquantum information processing, relies heavily on the assumption of measurement\nindependence, also called the assumption of free choice. The latter cannot be\nverified or guaranteed. In this paper, we consider a relaxation of the\nmeasurement independence assumption. We briefly review the results of Phys.\nRev. Lett. 113, 190402 (2014), which show that with our relaxation, the set of\nso-called measurement dependent local (MDL) correlations is a polytope, i.e. it\ncan be fully described using a finite set of linear inequalities. Here we\nanalyze this polytope, first in the simplest case of 2 parties with binary\ninputs and outputs, for which we give a full characterization. We show that\npartially entangled states are preferable to the maximally entangled state when\ndealing with measurement dependence in this scenario. We further present a\nmethod which transforms any Bell-inequality into an MDL inequality and give\nvalid inequalities for the case of arbitrary number of parties as well as one\nfor arbitrary number of inputs. We introduce the assumption of independent\nsources in the measurement dependence scenario and give a full analysis for the\nbipartite scenario with binary inputs and outputs. Finally, we establish a link\nbetween measurement dependence and another strong hindrance in certifying\nnonlocal correlations: nondetection events.\n", "  A 325MHz beta=0.14 superconducting half wave resonator(HWR) prototype has\nbeen developed at the Institute of High Energy Physics(IHEP), which can be\napplied in continuous wave (CW) high beam proton accelerators. In this paper,\nthe electromagnetic (EM) design, multipacting simulation, mechanical\noptimization, and fabrication are introduced in details. In vertical test at\n4.2K, the cavity reached Eacc=7MV/m with Q0=1.4*10^9 and Eacc=15.9MV/m with\nQ0=4.3*10^8.\n", "  Topological insulators (TIs) constitute a new class of materials with an\nenergy gap in the bulk and peculiar metallic states on the surface. To date,\nmost experiments have focused on probing the surface electronic structure of\nthese materials. Here, we report on new and potentially interesting features\nresulting from the bulk electronic structure. Our findings are based on a\ncomprehensive nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study of $^{77}$Se on\nBi$_2$Se$_3$ and Cu$_{0.15}$Bi$_2$Se$_3$ single crystals. First, we find two\nresonance lines and show that they originate from the two inequivalent Se\nlattice sites. Second, we observe unusual field-independent linewidths, and\nattribute them to an unexpectedly strong internuclear coupling mediated by bulk\nelectrons. These results call for a revision of earlier NMR studies and add\ninsight into the bulk electronic properties of TIs.\n", "  The spectrum of two-dimensional (2D) materials beyond graphene offers a\nremarkable platform to study new phenomena in condensed matter physics. Among\nthese materials, layered hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), with its wide bandgap\nenergy (~5.0-6.0 eV), has clearly established that 2D nitrides are key to\nadvancing novel devices1. A gap, however, remains between the theoretical\nprediction of 2D nitrides beyond hBN and experimental realization of such\nstructures. Here we demonstrate the synthesis of 2D gallium nitride (GaN) via a\nnovel migration-enhanced encapsulated growth (MEEG) technique utilizing\nepitaxial graphene. We theoretically predict and experimentally validate that\nthe atomic structure of 2D GaN grown via MEEG is notably different from\nreported theory. Moreover, we establish that graphene plays a critical role in\nstabilizing the direct-bandgap (nearly 5.0 eV), 2D buckled structure. Our\nresults provide a foundation for discovery and stabilization of novel 2D\nnitrides that are difficult to prepare via traditional synthesis.\n", "  Dependence of mode instabilities (MI) on ytterbium dopant concentrations in\nhigh power fiber amplifiers has been investigated. It is theoretically shown\nthat, by only varying the fiber length to maintain the same total small-signal\npump absorption, the MI threshold is independent of dopant concentration. MI\nthresholds of gain fibers with ytterbium dopant concentration of 5.93X10^25/m3\nand 1.02X10^26/m3 have been measured, which exhibit similar thresholds and\nagree with theoretical results. The result indicates that heavy doping of\nactive fiber can be adopted to suppress nonlinear effects without decreasing MI\nthreshold, which provides a method of maximizing the power output of fiber\nlaser, taking into account the stimulated Brillouin scattering, stimulated\nRaman Scattering, and MI thresholds simultaneously.\n", "  Currently several low-frequency experiments are being planned to study the\nnature of the first stars using the redshifted 21-cm signal from the cosmic\ndawn and epoch of reionization. Using a one-dimensional radiative transfer\ncode, we model the 21-cm signal pattern around the early sources for different\nsource models, i.e., the metal-free Population III (PopIII) stars, primordial\ngalaxies consisting of Population II (PopII) stars, mini-QSOs and high-mass\nX-ray binaries (HMXBs). We investigate the detectability of these sources by\ncomparing the 21-cm visibility signal with the system noise appropriate for a\ntelescope like the SKA1-low. Upon integrating the visibility around a typical\nsource over all baselines and over a frequency interval of 16 MHz, we find that\nit will be possible to make a $\\sim 9-\\sigma$ detection of the isolated sources\nlike PopII galaxies, mini-QSOs and HMXBs at $z \\sim 15$ with the SKA1-low in\n1000 hours. The exact value of the signal to noise ratio (SNR) will depend on\nthe source properties, in particular on the mass and age of the source and the\nescape fraction of ionizing photons. The predicted SNR decreases with\nincreasing redshift. We provide simple scaling laws to estimate the SNR for\ndifferent values of the parameters which characterize the source and the\nsurrounding medium. We also argue that it will be possible to achieve a SNR\n$\\sim 9$ even in the presence of the astrophysical foregrounds by subtracting\nout the frequency-independent component of the observed signal. These\ncalculations will be useful in planning 21-cm observations to detect the first\nsources.\n", "  A suitable wave function for baryon decuplet is framed with inclusion of sea\ncontaining quark- gluon Fock states. Relevant operator formalism is applied to\ncalculate magnetic moments of JP = 3 2 + baryon decuplet. Statistical model\nassumes decomposition of baryonic state in various quark-gluon Fock states such\nas jqqqijgi; jqqqijggi; jqqqijgggi with possibility gluon emitting qq pairs\ncondensates due to the subprocesses like g , qq; g , gg and g , qg where qq =\nuu; dd; ss. Statistical approach and detailed balance principle in combination\nis used to find the relative probabilities of these Fock states in avor, spin\nand color space. The total number of partons (sea) in this formalism are\nrestricted to three gluons due to limited free energy of gluon and suppressed\nnumber of strange quark-antiquark pairs. The combined approach is used to\ncalculate the magnetic moments, importance of strangeness in the sea (scalar,\nvector and tensor). Our approach has confirmed the scalar-tensor sea dominancy\nover vector sea. Various modifications in the model are used to check the\nvalidity of statistical approach. The results are matched with theoretical data\navailable. Good consistency with the experimental data have been achieved for\nDelta++, Delta+ and Omega-.\n", "  In this paper we study an su$(m)$-invariant open version of the\nHaldane-Shastry spin chain whose ground state can be obtained from the chiral\ncorrelator of the $c=m-1$ free boson boundary conformal field theory. We show\nthat this model is integrable for a suitable choice of the chain sites\ndepending on the roots of the Jacobi polynomial $P_N^{\\beta-1,\\beta'-1}$, where\n$N$ is the number of sites and $\\beta,\\beta'$ are two positive parameters. We\nalso compute in closed form the first few nontrivial conserved charges arising\nfrom the twisted Yangian invariance of the model. We evaluate the chain's\npartition function, determine the ground state energy and deduce a complete\ndescription of the spectrum in terms of Haldane's motifs and a related\nclassical vertex model. In particular, this description entails that the\nchain's level density is normally distributed in the thermodynamic limit. We\nalso analyze the spectrum's degeneracy, proving that it is much higher than for\na typical Yangian-invariant model.\n", "  We introduce a new class of generalized isotropic Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick models\nwith su$(m+1)$ spin and long-range non-constant interactions, whose\nnon-degenerate ground state is a Dicke state of su$(m+1)$ type. We evaluate in\nclosed form the reduced density matrix of a block of $L$ spins when the whole\nsystem is in its ground state, and study the corresponding von Neumann and\nR\\'enyi entanglement entropies in the thermodynamic limit. We show that both of\nthese entropies scale as $a\\log L$ when $L$ tends to infinity, where the\ncoefficient $a$ is equal to $(m-k)/2$ in the ground state phase with $k$\nvanishing su$(m+1)$ magnon densities. In particular, our results show that none\nof these generalized Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick models are critical, since when\n$L\\to\\infty$ their R\\'enyi entropy $R_q$ becomes independent of the parameter\n$q$. We have also computed the Tsallis entanglement entropy of the ground state\nof these generalized su$(m+1)$ Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick models, finding that it can\nbe made extensive by an appropriate choice of its parameter only when\n$m-k\\ge3$. Finally, in the su$(3)$ case we construct in detail the phase\ndiagram of the ground state in parameter space, showing that it is determined\nin a simple way by the weights of the fundamental representation of su$(3)$.\nThis is also true in the su$(m+1)$ case; for instance, we prove that the region\nfor which all the magnon densities are non-vanishing is an $(m+1)$-simplex in\n$\\mathbf R^m$ whose vertices are the weights of the fundamental representation\nof su$(m+1)$.\n", "  Several transiting hot Jupiters orbit relatively inactive main-sequence\nstars. For some of those, the logR'HK activity parameter lies below the basal\nlevel (-5.1). Two explanations have been proposed so far: (i) the planet\naffects the stellar dynamo, (ii) the logR'HK measurements are biased by\nextrinsic absorption, either by the interstellar medium (ISM) or by material\nlocal to the system. We present here Hubble Space Telescope/COS far-UV spectra\nof WASP-13, which hosts an inflated hot Jupiter and has a measured logR'HK\nvalue (-5.26), well below the basal level. From the star's spectral energy\ndistribution we obtain an extinction E(B-V) = 0.045+/-0.025 mag and a distance\nd = 232+/-8 pc. We detect at >4 sigma lines belonging to three different\nionization states of carbon (C1, C2, and C4) and the Si4 doublet at ~3 sigma.\nUsing far-UV spectra of nearby early G-type stars of known age, we derive a\nC4/C1 flux ratio-age relation, from which we estimate WASP-13's age to be\n5.1+/-2.0 Gyr. We rescale the solar irradiance reference spectrum to match the\nflux of the C4 1548 doublet. By integrating the rescaled solar spectrum, we\nobtain an XUV flux at 1 AU of 5.4 erg s^-1 cm^-2. We use a detailed model of\nthe planet's upper atmosphere, deriving a mass-loss rate of 1.5x10^11 g s^-1.\nDespite the low logR'HK value, the star shows a far-UV spectrum typical of\nmiddle-aged solar-type stars, pointing toward the presence of significant\nextrinsic absorption. The analysis of a high-resolution spectrum of the Ca2H&K\nlines indicates that the ISM absorption could be the origin of the low logR'HK\nvalue. Nevertheless, the large uncertainty in the Ca2 ISM abundance does not\nallow us to firmly exclude the presence of circumstellar gas.\n", "  We report an experimental approach to control the position of molecular\naggregates on surfaces by vacuum deposition. The control is accomplished by\nregulating the molecular density on the surface in a confined area. The\ndiffusing molecules are concentrated at the centre of the confined area,\nproducing a stable cluster when reaching the critical density for nucleation.\nMechanistic aspects of that control are obtained from kinetic Monte Carlo\nsimulations. The dimensions of the position can further be controlled by\nvarying the beam flux and the substrate temperature.\n", "  Electron and hole separate-path transport is theoretically found in the\npi-stacked organic layers and columns. This effect might be a solution for the\ncharge recombination problem. The building molecules, named\n1,3,5-tricyano-2,4,6-tricarboxy-benzene, contain the mesogenic flat aromatic\npart and the terminal dipole groups which make the system ferroelectric. The\ndiffusion path of the electrons cuts through the aromatic rings, while holes\nhop between the dipole groups. The transmission function and the charge\nmobilities, especially for the holes, are very sensitive to the distance\nbetween the molecular rings, due to the overlap of the pi-type orbitals. We\nverified that the separation of the diffusion paths is not destroyed by the\napplication of the graphene leads. These features make the system suitable for\nthe efficient solar cells, with the carrier mobilities higher than these in the\norganometal halide perovskites.\n", "  Local Oscillatory Rheology from Echography (LORE) consists in a traditional\nrheology experiment synchronized with high-frequency ultrasonic imaging which\ngives access to the local material response to oscillatory shear. Besides\nclassical global rheological quantities, this method provides quantitative\ntime-resolved information on the local displacement across the entire gap of\nthe rheometer. From the local displacement response, we compute and decompose\nthe local strain in its Fourier components and measure the spatially-resolved\nviscoelastic moduli. After benchmarking our method on homogeneous Newtonian\nfluids and soft solids, we demonstrate that this technique is well suited to\ncharacterize spatially heterogeneous samples, wall slip, and the emergence of\nnonlinearity under large amplitude oscillatory stress in soft materials.\n", "  We present composite models explaining the diphoton excess of mass around 750\nGeV recently reported by the LHC experiments.\n", "  Several biological tissues undergo changes in their geometry and in their\nbulk material properties by modelling and remodelling processes. Modelling\nsynthesises tissue in some regions and removes tissue in others. Remodelling\noverwrites old tissue material properties with newly formed, immature tissue\nproperties. As a result, tissues are made up of different \"patches\", i.e.,\nadjacent tissue regions of different ages and different material properties,\nwithin evolving boundaries. In this paper, generalised equations governing the\nspatio-temporal evolution of such tissues are developed within the continuum\nmodel. These equations take into account nonconservative, discontinuous surface\nmass balance due to creation and destruction of material at moving interfaces,\nand bulk balance due to tissue maturation. These equations make it possible to\nmodel patchy tissue states and their evolution without explicitly maintaining a\nrecord of when/where resorption and formation processes occurred. The time\nevolution of spatially averaged tissue properties is derived systematically by\nintegration. These spatially-averaged equations cannot be written in closed\nform as they retain traces that tissue destruction is localised at tissue\nboundaries.\n  The formalism developed in this paper is applied to bone tissues, which\nexhibit strong material heterogeneities due to their slow mineralisation and\nremodelling processes. Evolution equations are proposed in particular for\nosteocyte density and bone mineral density. Effective average equations for\nbone mineral density (BMD) and tissue mineral density (TMD) are derived using a\nmean-field approximation. The error made by this approximation when remodelling\npatchy tissue is investigated. The specific time signatures of BMD or TMD\nduring remodelling events may provide a way to detect these events occurring at\nlower, unseen spatial resolutions from microCT scans.\n", "  We examine statics and dynamics of phase-separated states of dilute binary\nmixtures using density functional theory. In our systems, the difference in the\nsalvation chemical potential $\\Delta\\mu_s$ between liquid and gas is\nconsiderably larger than the thermal energy $k_BT$ for each solute particle and\nthe attractive interaction among the solute particles is weaker than that among\nthe solvent particles. In these conditions, the saturated vapor pressure\nincreases by an amount equal to the solute density in liquid multiplied by the\nlarge factor $k_BT \\exp(\\Delta\\mu_s/k_BT)$. As a result, phase separation is\ninduced at low solute densities in liquid and the new phase remains in gaseous\nstates, while the liquid pressure is outside the coexistence curve of the\nsolvent. This explains the widely observed formation of stable nanobubbles in\nambient water with a dissolved gas. We calculate the density and stress\nprofiles across planar and spherical interfaces, where the surface tension\ndecreases with increasing the interfacial solute adsorption. We realize stable\nsolute-rich bubbles with radius about 30 nm, which minimize the free energy\nfunctional. We then study dynamics around such a bubble after a decompression\nof the surrounding liquid, where the bubble undergoes a damped oscillation. In\naddition, we present some exact and approximate expressions for the surface\ntension and the interfacial stress tensor.\n", "  The Negative Differential Conductivity and Transient Negative Mobility\neffects in xenon gas are analyzed by a first-principles particle simulation\ntechnique and via an approximate solution of the Boltzmann transport equation\n(BE). The particle simulation method is devoid of the approximations that are\ntraditionally adopted in the BE solutions in which (i) the distribution\nfunction is searched for in a two- term form, (ii) the Coulomb part of the\ncollision integral for the anisotropic part of the distribution function is\nneglected, (iii) Coulomb collisions are treated as binary events, and (iv) the\nrange of the electron-electron interaction is limited to a cutoff distance. The\nresults obtained from the two methods are, for both effects, in good\nqualitative agreement, small differences are attributed to the approximations\nlisted above.\n", "  Recent anomalies in the decays of $B$ mesons and the Higgs boson provide\nhints towards lepton flavor (universality) violating physics beyond the\nStandard Model. We observe that four-fermion operators which can explain the\n$B$-physics anomalies have corresponding analogs in the kaon sector, and we\nanalyze their impact on $K\\to\\pi\\ell \\ell'$ and $K\\to\\ell \\ell'$ decays\n$(\\ell=\\mu,e)$. For these processes, we note the corresponding physics\nopportunities at the NA62 experiment. In particular, assuming minimal flavor\nviolation, we comment on the required improvements in sensitivity necessary to\ntest the $B$-physics anomalies in the kaon sector.\n", "  The theory of interface localization in near-critical planar systems at phase\ncoexistence is formulated from first principles. We show that mutual\ndelocalization of two interfaces, amounting to interfacial wetting, occurs when\nthe bulk correlation length critical exponent $\\nu$ is larger than or equal to\n1. Interaction with a boundary or defect line involves an additional scale and\na dependence of the localization strength on the distance from criticality. The\nimplications are particularly rich in the boundary case, where delocalization\nproceeds through different renormalization patterns sharing the feature that\nthe boundary field becomes irrelevant in the delocalized regime. The boundary\ndelocalization (wetting) transition is shown to be continuous, with surface\nspecific heat and layer thickness exponents which can take values that we\ndetermine.\n", "  We report on the first use of laser ablation to make sub-millimeter,\nbroad-band, anti-reflection coatings (ARC) based on sub-wavelength structures\n(SWS) on alumina and sapphire. We used a 515 nm laser to produce pyramid-shaped\nstructures with pitch of about 320 $\\mu$m and total height of near 800 $\\mu$m.\nTransmission measurements between 70 and 140 GHz are in agreement with\nsimulations using electromagnetic propagation software. The simulations\nindicate that SWS ARC with the fabricated shape should have a fractional\nbandwidth response of $\\Delta \\nu / \\nu_{center}\\ = 0.55$ centered on 235 GHz\nfor which reflections are below 3%. Extension of the bandwidth to both lower\nand higher frequencies, between few tens of GHz and few THz, should be\nstraightforward with appropriate adjustment of laser ablation parameters.\n", "  The two- and three-point functions and the four-gluon vertex of\nthree-dimensional Yang-Mills theory are calculated from their Dyson-Schwinger\nequations and the 3PI effective action. Within a self-contained truncation\nvarious effects of truncating Dyson-Schwinger equations are studied. Estimates\nfor the errors induced by truncations are derived from comparisons between\nresults from different equations, comparisons with lattice results, and varying\nhigher Green functions. The results indicate that the two-loop diagrams are\nimportant in the gluon propagator, where they are explicitly calculated, but\nnot for the vertices. Furthermore, the influence of the four-gluon vertex on\nlower Green functions is found to be small.\n", "  A search for CP violation in $D^0 \\rightarrow K^{-} K^{+} $ and $D^0\n\\rightarrow \\pi^{-} \\pi^{+} $ decays is performed using $pp$ collision data,\ncorresponding to an integrated luminosity of $3~fb^{-1}$, collected using the\nLHCb detector at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and $8~$TeV. The flavour of the\ncharm meson is inferred from the charge of the pion in $D^{*+}\\rightarrow\nD^0\\pi^+$ and $D^{*-}\\rightarrow \\bar{D^0}\\pi^{-}$ decays. The difference\nbetween the CP asymmetries in $D^0 \\rightarrow K^{-} K^{+} $ and $D^0\n\\rightarrow \\pi^{-} \\pi^{+} $ decays, $\\Delta A_{CP} \\equiv A_{CP}(K^{-} K^{+})\n- A_{CP}(\\pi^{-} \\pi^{+})$, is measured to be $\\left( -0.10 \\pm 0.08(stat) \\pm\n0.03(syst) \\right) \\%$. This is the most precise measurement of a\ntime-integrated CP asymmetry in the charm sector from a single experiment.\n", "  We present results of interferometric polarization observations of the\nrecently discovered magnetar J1745-2900 in the vicinity of the Galactic center.\nThe observations were made with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) on 21\nFebruary 2014 in the range 40-48 GHz. The full polarization mode and A\nconfiguration of the array were used. The average total and linearly polarized\nflux density of the pulsar amounts to 2.3$\\pm$0.31 mJy/beam and 1.5$\\pm$0.2\nmJy/beam, respectively. Analysis shows a rotation measure (RM) of\n(-67$\\pm$3)x10$^3$ rad/m$^2$, which is in a good agreement with previous\nmeasurements at longer wavelengths. These high frequency observations are\nsensitive to RM values of up to ~2x10$^7$ rad/m$^2$. However, application of\nthe Faraday RM synthesis technique did not reveal other significant RM\ncomponents in the pulsar emission. This supports an external nature of a single\nthin Faraday-rotating screen which should be located close to the Galactic\ncenter. The Faraday corrected intrinsic electric vector position angle is\n16$\\pm$9 deg East of North, and coincides with the position angle of the\npulsar's transverse velocity. All measurements of the pulsar's RM value to\ndate, including the one presented here, well agree within errors, which points\ntowards a steady nature of the Faraday-rotating medium.\n", "  We show that the {\\it gapped} triplet superconductivity, i.e., a triplet\nsuperconductor with triplet order parameter, can be realized in strong\nspin-orbit-coupled quantum wells in proximity to $s$-wave superconductor. It is\nrevealed that with the singlet order parameter induced from the superconducting\nproximity effect, in quantum wells, not only can the triplet pairings arise due\nto the spin-orbit coupling, but also the triplet order parameter can be induced\ndue to the repulsive effective electron-electron interaction, including the\nelectron-electron Coulomb and electron-phonon interactions. This is a natural\nextension of the work of de Gennes, in which the repulsive-interaction-induced\nsinglet order parameter arises in the normal metal in proximity to $s$-wave\nsuperconductor [Rev. Mod. Phys. {\\bf 36}, 225 (1964)]. Specifically, we derive\nthe effective Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation, in which the self-energies due to\nthe effective electron-electron interactions contribute to the singlet and\ntriplet order parameters. It is further shown that for the singlet order\nparameter, it is efficiently suppressed due to this self-energy\nrenormalization; whereas for the triplet order parameter, it is the $p$-wave\n($p_x\\pm ip_y$) one with the ${\\bf d}$-vector parallel to the effective\nmagnetic field due to the spin-orbit coupling. Finally, we perform the\nnumerical calculation in InSb (100) quantum wells. Specifically, we reveal that\nthe Coulomb interaction is much more important than the electron-phonon\ninteraction at low temperature. Moreover, it shows that with proper electron\ndensity, the minimum of the renormalized singlet and the maximum of the induced\ntriplet order parameters are comparable, and hence can be experimentally\ndistinguished.\n", "  A search for new physics is performed based on all-hadronic events with large\nmissing transverse momentum produced in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) =\n13 TeV. The data sample, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.3\ninverse femtobarns, was collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC in\n2015. The data are examined in search regions of jet multiplicity, tagged\nbottom quark jet multiplicity, missing transverse momentum, and the scalar sum\nof jet transverse momenta. The observed numbers of events in all search regions\nare found to be consistent with the expectations from standard model processes.\nExclusion limits are presented for simplified supersymmetric models of gluino\npair production. Depending on the assumed gluino decay mechanism, and for a\nmassless, weakly interacting, lightest neutralino, lower limits on the gluino\nmass from 1440 to 1600 GeV are obtained, significantly extending previous\nlimits.\n", "  We analyze the 3d free massive fermion theory coupled to external sources.\nThe presence of a mass explicitly breaks parity invariance. We calculate two-\nand three-point functions of a gauge current and the energy momentum tensor\nand, for instance, obtain the well-known result that in the IR limit (but also\nin the UV one) we reconstruct the relevant CS action. We then couple the model\nto higher spin currents and explicitly work out the spin 3 case. In the UV\nlimit we obtain an effective action which was proposed many years ago as a\npossible generalization of spin 3 CS action. In the IR limit we derive a\ndifferent higher spin action. This analysis can evidently be generalized to\nhigher spins. We also discuss the conservation and properties of the\ncorrelators we obtain in the intermediate steps of our derivation.\n", "  For the two-parameter $p,q$-deformed Heisenberg algebra introduced recently\nand in which, instead of usual commutator of $X$ and $P$ in the l.h.s. of basic\nrelation $[X,P] = {\\rm i}\\hbar$, one uses the $p,q$-commutator, we established\ninteresting properties. Most important is the realizability of the\n$p,q$-deformed Heisenberg algebra by means of the appropriate deformed\noscillator algebra. Another uncovered property is special extension of the\nusual mutual Hermitian conjugation of the creation and annihilation operators,\nnamely the so-called $\\eta(N)$-pseudo-Hermitian conjugation rule, along with\nthe related $\\eta(N)$-pseudo-Hermiticity property of the position or momentum\noperators. In this work, we present some new solutions of the realization\nproblem yielding new (nonstandard) deformed oscillators, and show their\ninequivalence to the earlier known solution and the respective deformed\noscillator algebra, in particular what concerns ground state energy.\n", "  Applying string dualities to F-theory, we obtain various $[p,q]$-branes whose\nconstituents are standard branes of codimension two and exotic branes. We\nconstruct junctions of the exotic five-branes and their Hanany-Witten\ntransitions associated with those in F-theory. In this procedure, we understand\nthe monodromy of the single $5^2_2$-brane. We also find the objects which are\nsensitive to the branch cut of the $5^2_2$-brane. Considering the web of branes\nin the presence of multiple exotic five-branes analogous to the web of\nfive-branes with multiple seven-branes, we obtain novel brane constructions for\n$SU(2)$ gauge theories with $n$ flavors and their superconformal limit with\nenhanced $E_{n+1}$ symmetry in five, four, and three dimensions. Hence,\nadapting the techniques of the seven-branes to the exotic branes, we will be\nable to construct F-theories in diverse dimensions.\n", "  We perform quantum Monte Carlo simulations in the background of a classical\nblack hole. The lattice discretized path integral is numerically calculated in\nthe Schwarzschild metric and in its approximated metric. We study spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking of a real scalar field theory. We observe inhomogeneous\nsymmetry breaking induced by inhomogeneous gravitational field.\n", "  Minimal chaotic models of D-term inflation predicts too large primordial\ntensor perturbations. Although it can be made consistent with observations\nutilizing higher order terms in the K\\\"ahler potential, expansion is not\ncontrolled in the absence of symmetries. We comprehensively study the\nconditions of K\\\"ahler potential for D-term plateau-type potentials and discuss\nits symmetry. They include the alpha-attractor model with a massive vector\nsupermultiplet and its generalization leading to pole inflation of arbitrary\norder. We extend the models so that it can describe Coulomb phase, gauge\nanomaly is cancelled, and fields other than inflaton are stabilized during\ninflation. We also point out a generic issue for large-field D-term inflation\nthat the masses of the non-inflaton fields tend to exceed the Planck scale.\n", "  We investigate the linear response of an O(N) scalar quantum field theory\nsubject to external perturbations using the symmetry improved two particle\nirreducible effective action formalism [A. Pilaftsis and D. Teresi, Nucl. Phys.\nB874, 594 (2013)]. Despite satisfactory equilibrium behavior, we find a number\nof unphysical effects at the linear response level. Goldstone boson field\nfluctuations are over-determined, with the only consistent solution being to\nset the fluctuations and their driving sources to zero, except for momentum\nmodes where the Higgs and Goldstone self-energies obey a particular\nrelationship. Also Higgs field fluctuations propagate masslessly, despite the\nHiggs propagator having the correct mass. These pathologies are independent of\nany truncation of the effective action and still exist even if we relax the\nover-determining Ward identities, so long as the constraint is formulated\nO(N)-covariantly. We discuss possible reasons for the apparent incompatibility\nof the constraints and linear response approximation and possible ways forward.\n", "  According to the Particle Data Group, the measurements of ${\\cal B}(W^+ \\to\n\\tau^+ \\nu_\\tau)$ and ${\\cal B}(W^+ \\to \\ell^+ \\nu_\\ell)$ ($\\ell = e,\\mu$)\ndisagree with one another at the $2.3\\sigma$ level. In this paper, we search\nfor a new-physics (NP) explanation of this $W \\to \\tau\\nu$ puzzle. We consider\ntwo NP scenarios: (i) the $W$ mixes with a $W'$ boson that couples\npreferentially to the third generation, (ii) $\\tau_{L,R}$ and $\\nu_{\\tau L}$\nmix with isospin-triplet leptons. Unfortunately, once other experimental\nconstraints are taken into account, neither scenario can explain the above\nexperimental result. Our conclusion is that the $W \\to \\tau\\nu$ puzzle is\nalmost certainly just a statistical fluctuation.\n", "  An intense, short laser pulse propagating across a plasma boundary\nponderomotively drives THz radiation. Full format PIC simulations and\ntheoretical analysis are conducted to investigate the properties of this\nradiation. Simulation results show the THz emission originates in regions of\nvarying density and covers a broad spectrum with maximum frequency close to the\nmaximum plasma frequency. In the case of a sharp vacuum-plasma boundary, the\nradiation is generated symmetrically at the plasma entrance and exit, and its\nproperties are independent of plasma density when the density exceeds a\ncharacteristic value determined by the product of the plasma frequency and the\nlaser pulse duration. For a diffuse vacuum-plasma boundary, the emission from\nthe plasma entrance and exit is asymmetric: increasing and decreasing density\nramps enhance and diminish the radiated energy respectively. Enhancements by\nfactors of 50 are found and simulations show that a 1.66 J, 50 fs driver pulse\ncan generate ~400 \\mu J of THz radiation in a 1.2 mm increasing density ramp.\nWe present a model that attributes this effect to a plasma resonance process in\nthe density ramp. The results from the model match those of the simulations for\nramp lengths less than 600 \\mu m. For longer ramps for which simulations are\ntoo time consuming the model shows that the amount of radiation reaches a\nmaximum at a ramp length determined by collisional absorption.\n", "  We investigate the microphase separation in a membrane composed of charged\nlipid, by taking into account explicitly the electrostatic potential and the\nion densities in the surrounding solvent. While the overall (membrane and\nsolvent) charge neutrality is assumed, the membrane can have a non-zero net\ncharge. The static structure factor in the homogeneous state is analytically\nobtained without using the Debye-Huckel approximation and is found to have a\npeak at an intermediate wave number. For a binary membrane composed of anionic\nand neutral lipids, the characteristic wave number corresponds to a scale from\nseveral to tens of nanometers. Our numerical calculation further predicts the\nexistence of nano-domains in charged membranes.\n", "  CoRoT has detected by transit several tens of objects whose radii run from\n1.67 Earth radius. Their mass run from less than 5.7 Earth mass (CoRoT-24 b,\nAlonso et al. 2014) to 63 Jupiter mass (CoRoT-15 b, Bouchy et al. 2011). One\ncould be tempted to think that more massive the object is, the larger it is in\nsize and that there is some limit in mass and/or radius beyond which objects\nare not planets but very low mass stars below the 80 Jupiter mass limit to\ntrigger nuclear fusion (namely \"brown dwarfs\" ). CoRoT findings contribute to\nthe planet versus brown dwarf debate since there is no clear mass-radius\nrelation.\n", "  Following a bi-cylindrical model of geometrical dynamics, in the present\nstudy we show that Einstein gravitational equation leads to bi-geodesic\ndescription in an extended symmetrical time-space which fit Hubble expansion in\na \"microscopic\" cosmological model. As a duality, the geodesic solution is\nmathematically equivalent to the basic Klein-Gordon-Fock equations of free\nmassive elementary particles, in particular, as the squared Dirac equations of\nleptons and as a sub-solution with pseudo-axion. This result would serve an\nexplicit approach to consistency between quantum mechanics and general\nrelativity.\n", "  The search of new topological phases of matter is one of the new directions\nin condensed matter physics. Recent experimental realizations of Dirac\nsemimetal phases pave the way to look for other exotic phases of matter in real\nmaterials. Here we present a systematic angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy (ARPES) study of NdSb, a potential candidate for hosting a Dirac\nsemi-metal phase. Our studies reveal two hole-like Fermi surface pockets\npresent at the zone center ($\\Gamma$) point as well as two elliptical\nelectron-pockets present in the zone corner (X) point of the Brillouin zone\n(BZ). Interestingly, Dirac-like linearly dispersive states are observed about\nthe zone corner (X) point in NdSb. Our first principles calculations agree with\nthe experimentally observed bands at the $\\Gamma$ point. Moreover, the\nDirac-like state observed in NdSb may be a novel correlated state, not yet\npredicted in calculations. Our study opens a new direction to look for Dirac\nsemi-metal states in other members of the rare earth monopnictide family.\n", "  In Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV, we report on a\ngeometrical scaling in the transverse momentum ($p_{\\rm T}$) spectra of\ninclusive charged hadrons at 0-5$\\%$, 5-10$\\%$, 10-20$\\%$, 20-30$\\%$,\n30-40$\\%$, 40-50$\\%$, 50-60$\\%$, 60-70$\\%$ and 70-80$\\%$ centralities. This\ngeometrical scaling is exhibited when these spectra are expressed in terms of a\nnew scaling variable, $p_{\\rm T}^{\\prime}=p_{\\rm\nT}(191.5/N_{A})^{1/(3\\lambda+6)}$, where $N_{A}$ is the number of participating\nnucleon pairs, $\\lambda$ is the scaling parameter. With the method of ratios,\nthis scaling parameter is determined to be 1.68. We then use a single Tsallis\ndistribution to parameterize the spectra at different centralities, and find\nthat the Tsallis temperature $T$ is proportional to $N_{A}^{1/(3\\lambda+6)}$,\nwhich is exactly the prediction of the geometrical scaling. The geometrical\nscaling also predicts that the charged-particle density per participating\nnucleon pair ($(dN_{\\rm ch}/d\\eta)/N_{A}$) grows as a power of $N_{A}$,\n$N_{A}^{2/(3\\lambda+6)}$, which is confirmed by the data collected by the ALICE\ncollaboration.\n", "  Auger Muons and Infill for the Ground Array) is an upgrade of the Pierre\nAuger Observatory to extend its range of detection and to directly measure the\nmuon content of the particle showers. It consists of an infill of surface\nwater-Cherenkov detectors accompanied by buried scintillator detectors used for\nmuon counting. The main objectives of the AMIGA engineering array, referred to\nas the Unitary Cell, are to identify and resolve all engineering issues as well\nas to understand the muon-number counting uncertainties related to the design\nof the detector. The mechanical design, fabrication and deployment processes of\nthe muon counters of the Unitary Cell are described in this document. These\nmuon counters modules comprise sealed PVC casings containing plastic\nscintillation bars, wavelength-shifter optical fibers, 64 pixel photomultiplier\ntubes, and acquisition electronics. The modules are buried approximately 2.25 m\nbelow ground level in order to minimize contamination from electromagnetic\nshower particles. The mechanical setup, which allows access to the electronics\nfor maintenance, is also described in addition to tests of the modules'\nresponse and integrity. The completed Unitary Cell has measured a number of air\nshowers of which a first analysis of a sample event is included here.\n", "  The capability to probe the dispersion of elementary spin, charge, orbital,\nand lattice excitations has positioned resonant inelastic x-ray scattering\n(RIXS) at the forefront of photon science. In this work, we will investigate\nhow RIXS can contribute to a deeper understanding of the orbital properties and\nof the pairing mechanism in unconventional high-temperature superconductors. In\nparticular, we will show how direct RIXS spectra of magnetic excitations can\nreveal long-range orbital correlations in transition metal compounds, by\ndiscriminating different kind of orbital order in magnetic and\nantiferromagnetic systems. Moreover, we will show how RIXS spectra of\nquasiparticle excitations in superconductors can measure the superconducting\ngap magnitude, and reveal the presence of nodal points and phase differences of\nthe superconducting order parameter on the Fermi surface. This can reveal the\nproperties of the underlying pairing mechanism in unconventional\nsuperconductors, in particular cuprates and iron pnictides, discriminating\nbetween different superconducting order parameter symmetries, such as $s$, $d$\n(singlet pairing) and $p$ wave (triplet pairing).\n", "  We present a maximally symmetric vacuum spacetime, which is locally isometric\nanti- de Sitter, admitting closed timelike curves appear after a definite\ninstant of time i.e., a time-machine spacetime. The spacetime is regular,\nfree-from curvature singularities and an $4D$ extension of the Misner space in\ncurved spacetime with identical causality violating properties.\n", "  Mott variable range hopping is a fundamental mechanism for low-temperature\nelectron conduction in disordered solids in the regime of Anderson\nlocalization. In a mean field approximation, it reduces to a random walk\n(shortly, Mott random walk) on a random marked point process with possible\nlong-range jumps. We consider here the one-dimensional Mott random walk and we\nadd an external field (or a bias to the right). We show that the bias makes the\nwalk transient, and investigate its linear speed. Our main results are\nconditions for ballisticity (positive linear speed) and for sub-ballisticity\n(zero linear speed), and the existence in the ballistic regime of an invariant\ndistribution for the environment viewed from the walker, which is mutually\nabsolutely continuous with respect to the original law of the environment. If\nthe point process is a renewal process, the aforementioned conditions result in\na sharp criterion for ballisticity. Interestingly, the speed is not always\ncontinuous as a function of the bias.\n", "  We identify 339 known and 316 new variable stars of various types among\n250000 lightcurves obtained by digitizing 167 30x30cm photographic plates of\nthe Moscow collection. We use these data to conduct a comprehensive test of 18\nstatistical characteristics (variability indices) in search for the best\ngeneral-purpose variability detection statistic. We find that the highest peak\non the DFT periodogram, interquartile range, median absolute deviation, and\nStetson's L index are the most efficient in recovering variable objects from\nthe set of photographic lightcurves used in our test.\n", "  We describe a high-order numerical magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) solver built\nupon a novel non-linear entropy stable numerical flux function that supports\neight travelling wave solutions. By construction the solver conserves mass,\nmomentum, and energy and is entropy stable. The method is designed to treat the\ndivergence-free constraint on the magnetic field in a similar fashion to a\nhyperbolic divergence cleaning technique. The solver described herein is\nespecially well-suited for flows involving strong discontinuities. Furthermore,\nwe present a new formulation to guarantee positivity of the pressure. We\npresent the underlying theory and implementation of the new solver into the\nmulti-physics, multi-scale adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) simulation code\n$\\texttt{FLASH}$ (http://flash.uchicago.edu). The accuracy, robustness and\ncomputational efficiency is demonstrated with a number of tests, including\ncomparisons to available MHD implementations in $\\texttt{FLASH}$.\n", "  Detecting binary stars in photometric time series is traditionally done by\nmeasuring eclipses. This requires the orbital plane to be aligned with the\nobserver. A new method without that requirement uses stellar oscillations to\nmeasure delays in the light arrival time and has been successfully applied to\n$\\delta$ Scuti stars. However, application to other types of stars has not been\nexplored. To investigate this we simulated light curves with a range of input\nparameters. We find a correlation between the signal-to-noise of the pulsation\nmodes and the time delay required to detect binary motion. The detectability of\nthe binarity in the simulations and in real $Kepler$ data shows strong\nagreement, hence, we describe the factors that have prevented this method from\ndiscovering binary companions to stars belonging to various classes of\npulsating stars.\n", "  A description is given of the traveling solvent technique, which has been\nused for the crystal growth of both congruently and incongruently melting\nmaterials of many classes of intermetallic, chalcogenide, semiconductor and\noxide materials. The use of a solvent, growth at lower temperatures and the\nzoning process, that are inherent ingredients of the method, can help to grow\nlarge, high structural quality, high purity crystals. In order to optimize this\nprocess, careful control of the various growth variables is imperative;\nhowever, this can be difficult to achieve due to the large number of\nindependent experimental parameters that can be grouped under the broad\nheadings growth conditions, characteristics of the material being grown, and\nexperimental configuration, setup and design.This review attempts to describe\nthe principles behind the traveling solvent technique and the various\nexperimental variables. Guidelines are detailed to provide the information\nnecessary to allow closer control of the crystal growth process through a\nsystematic approach. Comparison is made between the traveling solvent technique\nand other crystal growth methods, in particular the more conventional\nstationary flux method. The use of optical heating is described in detail and\nsuccessful traveling solvent growth by optical heating is reported for the\nfirst time for crystals of $Tl_5Te_3$, $Cd_3As_2$, and $FeSc_2S_4$ (using Te,\nCd and FeS fluxes, respectively).\n", "  Since the emergence of monolayer graphene as a promising two-dimensional\nmaterial, many other monolayer and few-layer materials have been investigated\nextensively. An experimental study of few-layer Si2Te3 was recently reported,\nshowing that the material has diverse properties for potential applications in\nSi-based devices ranging from fully integrated thermoelectrics to\noptoelectronics to chemical sensors. This material has a unique layered\nstructure: it has a hexagonal closed-packed Te sublattice, with Si dimers\noccupying octahedral intercalation sites. Here we report a theoretical study of\nthis material in both bulk and monolayer form, unveiling a fascinating array of\ndiverse properties arising from reorientations of the silicon dimers between\nplanes of Te atoms. The lattice constant varies up to 5% and the band gap\nvaries up to 40% depending on dimer orientations. The monolayer band gap is 0.4\neV larger than the bulk-phase value for the lowest-energy configuration of Si\ndimers. These properties are, in principle, controllable by temperature and\nstrain, making Si2T3 a promising candidate material for nanoscale mechanical,\noptical, and memristive devices.\n", "  Photoionization produces supra-thermal electrons, electrons with much more\nenergy than is found in a thermalized gas at electron temperatures\ncharacteristic of nebulae. The presence of these high energy electrons may\nsolve the long-standing t^2/ADF puzzle, the observations that abundances\nobtained from recombination and collisionally excited lines do not agree, and\nthat different temperature indicators give different results, if they survive\nlong enough to affect diagnostic emission lines. The presence of these\nnon-Maxwellian distribution electrons is usually designated by the term kappa.\nHere we use well-established methods to show that the distance over which\nheating rates change are much longer than the distance supra thermal electrons\ncan travel, and that the timescale to thermalize these electrons are much\nshorter than the heating or cooling timescales. These estimates establish that\nsupra thermal electrons will have disappeared into the Maxwellian velocity\ndistribution long before they affect the collisionally excited forbidden and\nrecombination lines that are used for deriving abundances relative to hydrogen.\nThe electron velocity distribution in nebulae should be closely thermal.\n", "  Creating new ties in a social network facilitates knowledge exchange and\naffects positional advantage. In this paper, we study the process, which we\ncall network building, of establishing ties between two existing social\nnetworks in order to reach certain structural goals. We focus on the case when\none of the two networks consists only of a single member and motivate this case\nfrom two perspectives. The first perspective is socialization: we ask how a\nnewcomer can forge relationships with an existing network to place herself at\nthe center. We prove that obtaining optimal solutions to this problem is\nNP-complete, and present several efficient algorithms to solve this problem and\ncompare them with each other. The second perspective is network expansion: we\ninvestigate how a network may preserve or reduce its diameter through linking\nwith a new node, hence ensuring small distance between its members. We give two\nalgorithms for this problem. For both perspectives the experiment demonstrates\nthat a small number of new links is usually sufficient to reach the respective\ngoal.\n", "  Continuous-wave output at 229 nm for the application of laser cooling of Cd\natoms was generated by the 4th harmonic using two successive second harmonic\ngeneration stages. Employing a single-frequency optically pumped semiconductor\nlaser as a fundamental source, 0.56 W of output at 229 nm was observed with a\n10-mm long, Brewster-cut BBO crystal in an external cavity with 1.62 W of 458\nnm input. Conversion efficiency from 458 nm to 229 nm was more than 34%. By\napplying a tapered amplifier as a fundamental source, we demonstrated\nmagneto-optical trapping of all stable Cd isotopes including isotopes\n$^{111}$Cd and $^{113}$Cd, which are applicable to optical lattice clocks.\n", "  Volterra series representation is a powerful mathematical model for nonlinear\ncircuits. However, the difficulties in determining higher-order Volterra\nkernels limited its broader applications. In this work, a systematic approach\nthat enables a convenient extraction of Volterra kernels from X-parameters is\npresented. A concise and general representation of the output response due to\narbitrary number of input tones is given. The relationship between Volterra\nkernels and X-parameters is explicitly formulated. An efficient frequency sweep\nscheme and an output frequency indexing scheme are provide. The least square\nlinear regression method is employed to separate different orders of Volterra\nkernels at the same frequency, which leads to the obtained Volterra kernels\ncomplete. The proposed Volterra series representation based on X-parameters is\nfurther validated for time domain verification. The proposed method is\nsystematic and general-purpose. It paves the way for time domain simulation\nwith X-parameters and constitutes a powerful supplement to existing blackbox\nmacro-modeling methods for nonlinear circuits.\n", "  In this study, we investigated the effect of spacer and buffer layers on the\nblocking temperature TB of the perpendicular exchange bias of thin Cr2O3 films,\nand revealed a high TB of 260 K for 20-nm-thick Cr2O3 thin films. By inserting\na Ru spacer layer between the Cr2O3 and Co films and changing the spacer\nthickness, we controlled the magnitude of the exchange bias and TB. By\ncomparing the TB values of the 20-nm-thick Cr2O3 films on Pt and alpha-Fe2O3\nbuffers, we investigated the lattice strain effect on the TB. We show that\nhigher TB value can be obtained using an alpha-Fe2O3 buffer, which is likely\nbecause of the lattice-strain-induced increase of Cr2O3 magnetic anisotropy.\n", "  The effect of magnetic field on an ultrathin magnetic topological insulator\nfilm with structural inversion asymmetry is investigated. We introduce the\nphase diagram, calculate the Landau-level spectrum analytically and simulate\nthe transport behavior in Landauer-B\\\"uttiker formalism. The quantum anomalous\nHall phase will survive increasing magnetic field. Due to the two spin\npolarized zero modes of Landau levels a nontrivial phase similar with quantum\nspin Hall effect can be induced by magnetic field which is protected by\nstructural inversion symmetry. Some exotic longitudinal and Hall resistance\nplateaus with fractional values are also found in a six terminal Hall bar,\narising from the coupling between edge states due to inverted energy band and\nLandau levels.\n", "  Beyond iron, a small fraction of the total abundances in the Solar System is\nmade of proton-rich isotopes, the p nuclei. The clear understanding of their\nproduction is a fundamental challenge for nuclear astrophysics. The p nuclei\nconstrain the nucleosynthesis in core-collapse and thermonuclear supernovae.\nThe $\\gamma$ process is the most established scenario for the production of the\np nuclei, which are produced via different photodisintegration paths starting\non heavier nuclei. A large effort from nuclear physics is needed to access the\nrelevant nuclear reaction rates far from the valley of stability. This review\ndescribes the production of the heavy proton-rich isotopes by the $\\gamma$\nprocess in stars, and explores the state of the art of experimental nuclear\nphysics to provide nuclear data for stellar nucleosynthesis.\n", "  Structural colours have drawn wide attention for their potential as a future\nprinting technology for various applications, ranging from biomimetic tissues\nto adaptive camouflage materials. However, an efficient approach to realise\nrobust colours with a scalable fabrication technique is still lacking,\nhampering the realisation of practical applications with this platform. Here we\ndevelop a new approach based on large scale network metamaterials, which\ncombine dealloyed subwavelength structures at the nanoscale with loss-less,\nultra-thin dielectrics coatings. By using theory and experiments, we show how\nsub-wavelength dielectric coatings control a mechanism of resonant light\ncoupling with epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) regions generated in the metallic\nnetwork, manifesting the formation of highly saturated structural colours that\ncover a wide portion of the spectrum. Ellipsometry measurements report the\nefficient observation of these colours even at angles of $70$ degrees. The\nnetwork-like architecture of these nanomaterials allows for high mechanical\nresistance, which is quantified in a series of nano-scratch tests. With such\nremarkable properties, these metastructures represent a robust design\ntechnology for real-world, large scale commercial applications.\n", "  A mechanism is proposed to describe the occurrence of distance-dependent\ndissipation peaks in the dynamics of an atomic force microscope tip oscillating\nover a surface characterized by a charge density wave state. The dissipation\nhas its origin in the hysteretic behavior of the tip oscillations occurring at\npositions compatible with a localized phase slip of the charge density wave.\nThis model is supported through static and dynamic numerical simulations of the\ntip surface interaction and is in good qualitative agreement with recently\nperformed experiments on a NbSe$_2$ sample.\n", "  Accessing, controlling and understanding nanoscale friction and dissipation\nis a crucial issue in nanotechnology, where moving elements are central.\nRecently, ultra-sensitive noncontact pendulum Atomic Force Microscope (AFM)\nsucceeded in detecting the electronic friction drop caused by the onset of\nsuperconductivity in Nb, raising hopes that a wider variety of mechanisms of\nmechanical dissipation arising from electron organization into different\ncollective phenomena will become accessible through this unconventional surface\nprobe. Among them, the driven phase dynamics of charge-density-waves (CDWs)\nrepresents an outstanding challenge as a source of dissipation. Here we report\na striking multiplet of AFM dissipation peaks arising at nanometer distances\nabove the surface of NbSe$_2$ - a layered compound exhibiting an incommensurate\nCDW. Each peak appears at a well defined tip-surface interaction force of the\norder of a nN, and persists until T=70K where CDW short-range order is known to\ndisappear. A theoretical model is presented showing that the peaks are\nconnected to tip-induced local 2$\\pi$ CDW phase slips. Under the attractive\npotential of the approaching tip, the local CDW surface phase landscape deforms\ncontinuously until a series of 2$\\pi$ jumps occur between different values of\nthe local phase. As the tip oscillates to and fro, each slip gives rise to a\nhysteresis cycle, appearing at a selected distance, the dissipation\ncorresponding to \"pumping\" in and out a local slip in the surface CDW phase of\nNbSe$_2$.\n", "  Experimentally produced graphene sheets exhibit a wide range of mobility\nvalues. Both extrinsic charged impurities and intrinsic ripples (corrugations)\nhave been suggested to induce long-range disorder in graphene and could be a\ncandidate for the dominant source of disorder. Here, using large-scale\nmolecular dynamics and quantum transport simulations, we find that the hopping\ndisorder and the gauge and scalar potentials induced by the ripples are\nshort-ranged, in strong contrast with predictions by continuous models, and the\ntransport fingerprints of the ripple disorder are very different from those of\ncharged impurities. We conclude that charged impurities are the dominant source\nof disorder in most graphene samples, whereas scattering by ripples is mainly\nrelevant in the high carrier density limit of ultraclean graphene samples (with\na charged impurity concentration < 10 ppm) at room and higher temperatures.\n", "  This paper presents fabrication, measurement and modelling results for a\nmetal-dielectric-metal metasurface absorber for solar thermal applications. The\nstructure uses amorphous carbon as an inter-layer between thin gold films with\nthe upper film patterned with a 2D periodic array using focused ion beam\netching. The patterned has been optimised to give high absorptance from\n400-1200nm and low absorptance above this wavelength range to minimise thermal\nradiation and hence obtain higher temperature performance. Wide angle\nabsorptance results are shown and detailed modelling of a realistic\nnanostructured upper layer results in excellent agreement between measured and\nmodelled results. The use of gold in this paper is a first step towards a high\ntemperature metasurface where gold can be replaced by other refractory metals\nsuch as tungsten or chrome.\n", "  The understanding of organic content of protoplanetary discs is one of the\nmain goals of the planet formation studies. As an attempt to guide the\nobservational searches for weak lines of complex species in discs, we modelled\nthe (sub-)millimetre spectrum of gaseous methanol (CH$_3$OH), one of the\nsimplest organic molecules, in the representative T Tauri system. We used 1+1D\ndisc physical model coupled to the gas-grain ALCHEMIC chemical model with and\nwithout 2D-turbulent mixing. The computed CH$_3$OH abundances along with the\nCH$_3$OH scheme of energy levels of ground and excited torsional states were\nused to produce model spectra obtained with the non-local thermodynamic\nequilibrium (non-LTE) 3D line radiative transfer code LIME. We found that the\nmodelled non-LTE intensities of the CH$_3$OH lines can be lower by factor of\n$>10$--$100$ than those calculated under assumption of LTE. Though population\ninversion occurs in the model calculations for many (sub-)millimetre\ntransitions, it does not lead to the strong maser amplification and noticeably\nhigh line intensities. We identify the strongest CH$_3$OH (sub-)millimetre\nlines that could be searched for with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA)\nin nearby discs. The two best candidates are the CH$_{3}$OH $5_0-4_0~A^+$\n(241.791 GHz) and $5_{-1}-4_{-1}~E$ (241.767 GHz) lines, which could possibly\nbe detected with the $\\sim5\\sigma$ signal-to-noise ratio after $\\sim3$ hours of\nintegration with the full ALMA array.\n", "  A multi-parametric family of stretch exponential distributions with various\npower law tails is introduced and is shown to describe adequately the empirical\ndistributions of scientific citation of individual authors. The four-parametric\nfamilies are characterized by a normalization coefficient in the exponential\npart, the power exponent in the power-law asymptotic part, and the coefficient\nfor the transition between the above two parts. The distribution of papers of\nindividual scientist over citations of these papers is studied. Scientists are\nselected via total number of citations in three ranges: 102-103, 103-104, and\n104-105 of total citations. We study these intervals for physicists in ISI Web\nof Knowledge. The scientists who started their scientific publications after\n1980 were taken into consideration only. It is detected that the power\ncoefficient in the stretch exponent starts from one for low-cited authors and\nhas to trend to smaller values for scientists with large number of citation. At\nthe same time, the power coefficient in tail drops for large-cited authors. One\npossible explanation for the origin of the stretch-exponential distribution for\ncitation of individual author is done.\n", "  Research and medicine rely on non-invasive optical techniques to image living\ntissue with high resolution in space and time. But so far a single data\nacquisition could not provide entirely diffraction-limited tomographic volumes\nof rapidly moving or changing targets, which additionally becomes increasingly\ndifficult in the presence of aberrations, e.g., when imaging retina in vivo. We\nshow, that a simple interferometric setup based on parallelized optical\ncoherence tomography acquires volumetric data with 10 billion voxels per\nsecond, exceeding previous imaging speeds by an order of magnitude. This allows\nus to computationally obtain and correct defocus and aberrations resulting in\nentirely diffraction-limited volumes. As demonstration, we imaged living human\nretina with clearly visible nerve fiber layer, small capillary networks, and\nphotoreceptor cells, but the technique is also applicable to obtain\nphase-sensitive volumes of other scattering structures at unprecedented\nacquisition speeds.\n", "  When an acoustic wave travels in a lossy medium such as a liquid, it\nprogressively transfers its pseudo-momentum to the fluid, which results in a\nsteady acoustic streaming. Remarkably, the phenomenon involves a balance\nbetween sound attenuation and shear, such that viscosity vanishes in the final\nexpression of the velocity field. For this reason, the effect of viscosity has\nlong been ignored in acoustic streaming experiments. Here, we show\nexperimentally that the viscosity plays a major role in cavities such as the\nstreaming induced by surface acoustic waves in sessile droplets. We develop a\nnumerical model based on the spatial filtering of the streaming source term to\ncompute the induced flow motion with dramatically reduced computational\nrequirements. We evidence that acoustic fields in droplets are a superposition\nof a chaotic field and a few powerful caustics. It appears that the caustics\ndrive the flow, which allows a qualitative prediction of the flow structure.\nFinally, we reduce the problem to two dimensionless numbers related to the\nsurface and bulk waves attenuation and simulate hemispherical sessile droplets\nresting on a lithium niobate substrate for a range of parameters. Even in such\na baseline configuration, we observe at least four distinct flow regimes. For\neach of them, we establish a correlation of the average streaming speed in the\ndroplet, which is increasingly dependent on the bulk wave attenuation as the\nviscosity increases. These correlations extend our results to a wide range of\nfluids and actuation frequencies.\n", "  A novel ignition hohlraum for indirect-drive inertial confinement fusion is\nproposed, which is named as three-axis cylindrical hohlraum (TACH). TACH is a\nkind of 6 laser entrance holes (LEHs) hohlraum, which is made of three\ncylindrical hohlraums orthogonally jointed. Laser beams are injected through\nevery entrance hole with the same incident angle of 55{\\deg}. The view-factor\nsimulation result shows that the time-varying drive asymmetry of TACH is no\nmore than 1.0% in the whole drive pulse period without any supplementary\ntechnology such as beam phasing etc. Its coupling efficiency of TACH is close\nto that of 6 LEHs spherical hohlraum with corresponding size. Its\nplasma-filling time is close to typical cylindrical ignition hohlraum. Its\nlaser plasma interaction has as low backscattering as the outer cone of the\ncylindrical ignition hohlraum. Therefore, the proposed hohlraum provides a\ncompetitive candidate for ignition hohlraum.\n", "  A short introduction on elements of noncommutative geometry, which offers a\npurely geometric interpretation of the Standard Model and implies a higher\nderivative gravitational theory, is presented. Physical consequences of almost\ncommutative manifolds are briefly discussed and cosmological consequences of\nthe gravitational sector, which is shown not to be plagued by linear\ninstability, are highlighted. Successes and challenges are discussed. A novel\nspectral action proposal based on zeta function regularisation is briefly\npresented.\n", "  Discharge experiments were carried out at the Eindhoven University of\nTechnology in 2013. The experimental setup was designed to search for electrons\nproduced in meter-scale sparks using a 1 MV Marx generator. Negative voltage\nwas applied to the high voltage (HV) electrode. Five thin (1 mm) plastic\ndetectors (5 $\\rm cm^2$ each) were distributed in various configurations close\nto the spark gap. Earlier studies have shown (for HV negative) that X-rays are\nproduced when a cloud of streamers is developed 30-60 cm from the negative\nelectrode. This indicates that the electrons producing the X-rays are also\naccelerated at this location, that could be in the strong electric field from\ncounterstreamers of opposite polarity. Comparing our measurements with modeling\nresults, we find that $\\sim$300 keV electrons produced about 30-60 cm from the\nnegative electrode are the most likely source of our measurements. A\nstatistical analysis of expected detection of photon bursts by these fiber\ndetectors indicates that only 20%-45% of the detected bursts could be from soft\n($\\sim$10 keV) photons, which further supports that the majority of detected\nbursts are produced by relativistic electrons.\n", "  This article describes two independent developments aimed at improving the\nParticle Tracking Method for measurements of flow or particle velocities.\nFirst, a stereoscopic multicamera calibration method that does not require any\noptical model is described and evaluated. We show that this new calibration\nmethod gives better results than the most commonly-used technique, based on the\nTsai camera/optics model. Additionally, the methods uses a simple interpolant\nto compute the transformation matrix and it is trivial to apply for any\nexperimental fluid dynamics visualization set up. The second contribution\nproposes a solution to remove noise from Eulerian measurements of velocity\nstatistics obtained from Particle Tracking velocimetry, without the need of\nfiltering and/or windowing. The novel method presented here is based on\nrecomputing particle displacement measurements from two consecutive frames for\nmultiple different time-step values between frames. We show the successful\napplication of this new technique to recover the second order velocity\nstructure function of the flow. Increased accuracy is demonstrated by comparing\nthe dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy measured from the second order\nstructure function against previously validated measurements. These two\ntechniques for improvement of experimental fluid/particle velocity measurements\ncan be combined to provide high accuracy 3D particle and/or flow velocity\nstatistics and derived variables needed to characterize a turbulent flow.\n", "  Inspired by spring-block models, we elaborate a \"minimal\" physical model of\nearthquakes which reproduces two main empirical seismological laws, the\nGutenberg-Richter law and the Omori aftershock law. Our new point is to\ndemonstrate that the simultaneous incorporation of ageing of contacts in the\nsliding interface and of elasticity of the sliding plates constitute the\nminimal ingredients to account for both laws within the same frictional model.\n", "  I review the current status of structure formation bounds on neutrino\nproperties such as mass and energy density. I also discuss future cosmological\nbounds as well as a variety of different scenarios for reconciling cosmology\nwith the presence of light sterile neutrinos.\n", "  We introduce a new model of interacting spin 1/2. It describes interaction of\nthree nearest neighbors. The Hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of Fredkin\ngates. The Fredkin gate (also known as the CSWAP gate) is a computational\ncircuit suitable for reversible computing. Our construction generalizes the\nwork of Ramis Movassagh and Peter Shor.\n  Our model can be solved by means of Catalan combinatorics in the form of\nrandom walks on the upper half of a square lattice [Dyck walks]. Each Dyck path\ncan be mapped to a wave function of the spins. The ground state is an equally\nweighted superposition of Dyck walks [instead of Motzkin walks]. We can also\nexpress it as a matrix product state. We further construct the model of\ninteracting spins 3/2 and greater half-integer spins. The models with higher\nspins require coloring of Dyck walks. We construct SU(k) symmetric model [here\nk is the number of colors]. The leading term of the entanglement entropy is\nthen proportional to the square root of the length of the lattice [like in\nShor-Movassagh model]. The gap closes as a high power of the length of the\nlattice.\n", "  We include resummation of large transverse logarithms into the\nnext-to-leading order Balitsky-Kovchegov equation. The resummed NLO evolution\nequation is shown to be stable, the evolution speed being significantly reduced\nby higher order corrections. The contributions from $\\alpha_s^2$ terms that are\nnot enhanced by large logarithms are found to be numerically important close to\nphenomenologically relevant initial conditions.\n", "  Quantum annealing may provide advantages over simulated annealing on solving\nsome problems such as Kth order binary optimization problem. No feasible\narchitecture exists to implement the high-order optimization problem (K > 2) on\ncurrent quantum annealing hardware. We propose a two-dimensional quantum\nannealing architecture to solve the 4th order binary optimization problem by\nencoding four-qubit interactions within the coupled local fields acting on a\nset of physical qubits. All possible four-body coupling terms for an N-qubit\nsystem can be implemented through this architecture and are readily realizable\nwith the existing superconducting circuit technologies. The overhead of the\nphysical qubits is O(N4), which is the same as previously proposed\narchitectures in four-dimensional space. The equivalence between the\noptimization problem Hamiltonian and the executable Hamiltonian is ensured by a\ngauge invariant subspace of the experimental system. A scheme to realize local\ngauge constraint by single ancillary qubit is proposed.\n", "  It is well-known that small, regular, spherically symmetric characteristic\ninitial data to the Einstein-scalar-field system which are decaying towards\n(future null) infinity give rise to solutions which are foward-in-time global\n(in the sense of future causal geodesic completeness). We construct a class of\nspherically symmetric solutions which are global but the initial norms are\nconsistent with initial data not decaying towards infinity. This gives the\nfollowing consequences: (1) We prove that there exist foward-in-time global\nsolutions with arbitrarily large (and in fact infinite) initial bounded\nvariation (BV) norms and initial Bondi masses. (2) While general solutions with\nnon-decaying data do not approach Minkowski spacetime, we show using the\nresults of Luk--Oh that if a sufficiently strong asymptotic flatness condition\nis imposed on the initial data, then the solutions we construct (with large BV\nnorms) approach Minkowski spacetime with a sharp inverse polynomial rate. (3)\nOur construction can be easily extended so that data are posed at past null\ninfinity and we obtain solutions with large BV norms which are causally\ngeodesically complete both to the past and to the future. Finally, we discuss\napplications of our method to construct global solutions for other nonlinear\nwave equations with infinite critical norms.\n", "  An organometallic powder (platinum (II) acetylacetonate) is decomposed in the\npost-discharge of an atmospheric RF plasma torch to deposit Pt nanoparticles on\ncarbon black supports. The resulting nanohybrid materials are characterized by\nFEG-SEM and XPS techniques to highlight their high content in Pt, their\noxidation degree, and the dispersion of the Pt nanoparticles on the substrate.\nICP-MS and electrochemical characterizations in a single fuel cell (cyclic\nvoltammetry, dynamic polarization curves) are also performed on electrodes\nrealized by treating the powder mixture overlaid on gas diffusion layers. The\ncomparison of the catalytic activity and the Pt loading with commercially\navailable electrodes shows the great potential of this simple innovative, fast,\nand robust deposition method.\n", "  The method of increments (MoI) allows one to successfully calculate cohesive\nenergies of bulk materials with high accuracy, but it encounters difficulties\nwhen calculating whole dissociation curves. The reason is that its standard\nformalism is based on a single Hartree-Fock (HF) configuration whose orbitals\nare localized and used for the many-body expansion. Therefore, in those\nsituations where HF does not allow a size-consistent description of the\ndissociation, the MoI cannot yield proper results either. Herein we address the\nproblem by employing a size-consistent multiconfigurational reference for the\nMoI formalism. This leads to a matrix equation where a coupling derived by the\nreference itself is employed. In principle, such approach allows one to\nevaluate approximate values for the ground as well as excited states energies.\nWhile the latter are accurate close to the avoided crossing only, the ground\nstate results are very promising for the whole dissociation curve, as shown by\nthe comparison with density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) benchmarks. We\ntested this two-state constant-coupling (TSCC)-MoI on beryllium rings of\ndifferent sizes and studied the error introduced by the constant coupling.\n", "  We derive the N=1 supersymmetric extension for a class of weakly nonlocal\nfour dimensional gravitational theories.The construction is explicitly done in\nthe superspace and the tree-level perturbative unitarity is explicitly proved\nboth in the superfield formalism and in field components. For the minimal\nnonlocal supergravity the spectrum is the same as in the local theory and in\nparticular it is ghost-free. The supersymmetric extension of the\nsuper-renormalizable Starobinsky theory and of two alternative massive nonlocal\nsupergravities are found as straightforward applications of the formalism.\nPower-counting arguments ensure super-renormalizability with milder requirement\nfor the asymptotic behavior of form factors than in ordinary nonlocal gravity.\nThe most noteworthy result, common to ordinary supergravity, is the absence of\nquantum corrections to the cosmological constant in any regularization\nprocedure. We cannot exclude the usual one-loop quadratic divergences. However,\nlocal vertices in the superfields, not undergoing renormalization, can be\nintroduced to cancel out such divergences. Therefore, quantum finiteness is\ncertainly achieved in dimensional regularization and most likely also in the\ncut-off regularization scheme. We also discuss the n-point scattering\namplitudes making use of a general field redefinition theorem implemented in\nthe superspace. Finally, we show that all the exact solutions of the local\nsupergravity in vacuum are solutions of the nonlocal one too. In particular, we\nhave the usual Schwarzschild singularity. We infer that the weak nonlocality,\neven in the presence of minimal supersymmetry, is not sufficient to solve the\nspacetime singularities issue, although the theory is finite at quantum level.\n", "  Crude estimates are made of the branching ratios and pair production\ncross-section for our previously proposed bound state S of six top and six\nantitop quarks identified with the diphoton excess recently observed in ATLAS\nand CMS. We estimate the pair production cross section to be approximately 12\ntimes that for fourth family quarks. Hence we predict $\\sigma(pp \\rightarrow SS\n+ anything) \\approx 2$ pb at 13 TeV and an increase by a factor 10 over the\ncross section at 8 TeV. Crude estimates of the main branching ratios relative\nto the diphoton decay give $\\Gamma(S\\rightarrow \\gamma+\\gamma) \\propto 1$,\n$\\Gamma(S\\rightarrow t + \\bar{t})\\propto 378$, $\\Gamma(S \\rightarrow\ngluon+gluon)\\propto 117$, $\\Gamma(S\\rightarrow Higgs+Higgs)\\propto 15$,\n$\\Gamma(S\\rightarrow W+W)\\propto 30$ and $\\Gamma(S\\rightarrow Z+Z) = 15$.\n  These estimates are consistent with the LHC bounds at 8 TeV within a factor\n1.25. We expect the $S \\rightarrow \\gamma\\gamma$ events to be produced together\nwith another S resonance decaying typically into top-antitop or gluon-gluon\njets.\n", "  Using density functional calculations we have investigated the local spin\nmoment formation and lattice deformation in graphene when an isolated vacancy\nis created. We predict two competing equilibrium structures: a ground state\nplanar configuration with a saturated local moment of 1.5 $\\mu_B$, and a\nmetastable non-planar configuration with a vanishing magnetic moment, at a\nmodest energy expense of ~50 meV. Though non-planarity relieves the lattice of\nvacancy-induced strain, the planar state is energetically favored due to\nmaximally localized defect states (v$\\sigma$, v$\\pi$). In the planar\nconfiguration, charge transfer from itinerant (Dirac) states weakens the\nspin-polarization of v$\\pi$ yielding a fractional moment, which is aligned\nparallel to the unpaired v$\\sigma$ electron through Hund's coupling. In the\nnon-planar configuration, the absence of orthogonal symmetry allows interaction\nbetween v$\\sigma$ and local d$\\pi$ states, to form a hybridized\nv$\\sigma^\\prime$ state. The non-orthogonality also destabilizes the Hund's\ncoupling, and an antiparallel alignment between v$\\sigma$ and v$\\pi$ lowers the\nenergy. The gradual spin reversal of v$\\pi$ with increasing non-planarity opens\nup the possibility of an intermediate structure with balanced v$\\pi$ spin\npopulation. If such a structure is realized under external perturbations,\ndiluted vacancy concentration may lead to v$\\sigma$ based spin-1/2\nparamagnetism.\n", "  We examine coherent memory manipulation in a $\\Lambda$-type medium, using the\nsecond order solution presented by Groves, Clader and Eberly [J. Phys. B: At.\nMol. Opt. Phys. 46, 224005 (2013)] as a guide. The analytical solution obtained\nusing the Darboux transformation and a nonlinear superposition principle\ndescribes complicated soliton-pulse dynamics which, by an appropriate choice of\nparameters, can be simplified to a well-defined sequence of pulses interacting\nwith the medium. In this report, this solution is reviewed and put to test by\nmeans of a series of numerical simulations, encompassing all the parameter\nspace and adding the effects of homogeneous broadening due to spontaneous\nemission. We find that even though the decohered results deviate from the\nanalytical prediction they do follow a similar trend that could be used as a\nguide for future experiments.\n"]}
