["  We study the quantum properties and gravitational field of a system that has\noscillations in time. Treating time as a dynamical variable, we first construct\na wave with 4-vector amplitude that has matters vibrating in space and time. By\nanalyzing its Hamiltonian density equation, we find that such system shall be\ntreated as a quantized field. This quantized real scalar field obeys the\nKlein-Gordon equation and has properties resemble a zero spin bosonic field. In\naddition, the particle observed has oscillation in proper time. By neglecting\nall quantum effects and assuming the particle as a classical object that can\nremain stationary in space, we show that the spacetime geometry around the\nproper time oscillation has properties similar to the Schwarzschild\ngravitational field of a point mass in relativity.\n", "  Since the seminal work of Paturi and Simon \\cite[FOCS'84 & JCSS'86]{PS86},\nthe unbounded-error classical communication complexity of a Boolean function\nhas been studied based on the arrangement of points and hyperplanes. Recently,\n\\cite[ICALP'07]{INRY07} found that the unbounded-error {\\em quantum}\ncommunication complexity in the {\\em one-way communication} model can also be\ninvestigated using the arrangement, and showed that it is exactly (without a\ndifference of even one qubit) half of the classical one-way communication\ncomplexity. In this paper, we extend the arrangement argument to the {\\em\ntwo-way} and {\\em simultaneous message passing} (SMP) models. As a result, we\nshow similarly tight bounds of the unbounded-error two-way/one-way/SMP\nquantum/classical communication complexities for {\\em any} partial/total\nBoolean function, implying that all of them are equivalent up to a\nmultiplicative constant of four. Moreover, the arrangement argument is also\nused to show that the gap between {\\em weakly} unbounded-error quantum and\nclassical communication complexities is at most a factor of three.\n", "  I review the physics of the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino flux (or Background,\nDSNB), in the context of future searches at the next generation of neutrino\nobservatories. The theory of the DSNB is discussed in its fundamental elements,\nnamely the cosmological rate of supernovae, neutrino production inside a core\ncollapse supernova, redshift, and flavor oscillation effects. The current upper\nlimits are also reviewed, and results are shown for the rates and energy\ndistributions of the events expected at future liquid argon and liquid\nscintillator detectors of O(10) kt mass, and water Cherenkov detectors up to a\n0.5 Mt mass. Perspectives are given on the significance of future observations\nof the DSNB, both at the discovery and precision phases, for the investigation\nof the physics of supernovae and of the properties of the neutrino.\n", "  Certain covariant theories of the modified Newtonian dynamics paradigm seem\nto require an additional hot dark matter (HDM) component - in the form of\neither heavy ordinary neutrinos or more recently light sterile neutrinos (SNs)\nwith a mass around 11eV - to be relieved of problems ranging from cosmological\nscales down to intermediate ones relevant for galaxy clusters. Here we suggest\nusing gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters to test such a marriage of\nneutrino HDM and modified gravity, adopting the framework of\ntensor-vector-scalar theory (TeVeS). Unlike conventional cold dark matter\n(CDM), such HDM is subject to strong phase-space constraints, which allows one\nto check cluster lens models inferred within the modified framework for\nconsistency. Since the considered HDM particles cannot collapse into\narbitrarily dense clumps and only form structures well above the galactic\nscale, systems which indicate the need for dark substructure are of particular\ninterest. As a first example, we study the cluster lens Abell 2390 and its\nimpressive straight arc with the help of numerical simulations. Based on our\nresults, we outline a general and systematic approach to model cluster lenses\nin TeVeS which significantly reduces the calculation complexity. We further\nconsider a simple bimodal lens configuration, capable of producing the straight\narc, to demonstrate our approach. We find that such a model is marginally\nconsistent with the hypothesis of 11eV SNs. Future work including more detailed\nand realistic lens models may further constrain the necessary SN distribution\nand help to conclusively assess this point. Cluster lenses could therefore\nprovide an interesting discriminator between CDM and such modified gravity\nscenarios supplemented by SNs or other choices of HDM.\n", "  An overview of the author's papers on the new approach to the Brownian\ncoagulation theory and its generalization to the diffusion-limited reaction\nrate theory is presented. The traditional diffusion approach of the\nSmoluchowski theory for coagulation of colloids is critically analyzed and\nshown to be valid only in the particular case of coalescence of small particles\nwith large ones. It is shown that, owing to rapid diffusion mixing, coalescence\nof comparable size particles occurs in the kinetic regime, realized under\ncondition of homogeneous spatial distribution of particles, in the two modes,\ncontinuum and free molecular. Transition from the continuum to the free\nmolecular mode can be described by the interpolation expression derived within\nthe new analytical approach with fitting parameters that can be specified\nnumerically, avoiding semi-empirical assumptions of the traditional models. A\nsimilar restriction arises in the traditional approach to the diffusion-limited\nreaction rate theory, based on generalization of the Smoluchowski theory for\ncoagulation of colloids. In particular, it is shown that the traditional\napproach is applicable only to the special case of reactions with a large\nreaction radius, and becomes inappropriate to calculation of the reaction rate\nin the case of a relatively small reaction radius. In the latter, more general\ncase particles collisions occur mainly in the kinetic regime (rather than in\nthe diffusion one) characterized by homogeneous (at random) spatial\ndistribution of particles. The calculated reaction rate for a small reaction\nradius in 3-d formally coincides with the expression derived in the traditional\napproach for reactions with a large reaction radius, however, notably deviates\nat large times from the traditional result in the plane (2-d) geometry, that\nhas wide applications also in the membrane biology as well as in some other\nimportant areas.\n", "  Many quantum key distribution (QKD) schemes are based on sending and\nmeasuring qubits -- two-dimensional quantum systems. Yet, in practical\nrealizations and experiments, the measuring devices at the receiver's (Bob)\nsite commonly do not measure a two-dimensional system but rather a quantum\nspace of a larger dimension. Such an enlargement sometimes results from\nimperfect devices. However, in various QKD protocols such enlargement exists\neven in the ideal scenario when all devices are assumed to be perfect. This\nissue is common, for instance, in QKD schemes implemented via photons, where\nthe parties' devices are based on Mach-Zehnder interferometers, as these\ninherently enlarge the quantum space in use.\n  We show how space enlargement at Bob's site exposes the implemented protocol\nto new kinds of attacks, attacks that have not yet been explicitly pinpointed\nnor rigorously analyzed. We name these the \"reversed space attacks\". A key\ninsight in formalizing our attacks, is the idea of taking all states defining\nBob's (large) measured space and reversing them in time in order to identify\nprecisely the space that an eavesdropper may attack. We employ such attacks on\ntwo variants of intereferometric-based QKD recently experimented by several\ngroups, and show how to get full information on the qubit sent by Alice, while\ninducing no errors at all. The technique we develop here has subsequently been\nused in a closely related work (Boyer, Gelles, and Mor, Physical Review A,\n2014) to demonstrate a (weaker variant of) reversed-space attack on both\ninterferometric-based and polarization-based QKD.\n", "  A Szilard Engine is a hypothetical device which is able to extract work from\na single thermal reservoir by measuring the position of particles within the\nengine. We derive the amount of work that can be extracted from such a device\nin the low temperature limit. Interestingly, we show this work is determined by\nthe information gain of the initial measurement rather than by the number and\ntype of particles which constitute the working substance. Our work provides\nanother clear connection between information gain and extractable work in\nthermodynamical processes.\n", "  I revisit cosmological perturbations in Bekenstein's tensor-vector-scalar\ntheory (TeVeS). Considering only scalar modes in the conformal Newtonian gauge,\nthe extra degrees of freedom are expressed in a way suitable for studying\nmodifications at the level of the metric potentials. Assuming a universe in the\nmatter-dominated phase, I discuss the mechanism responsible for boosting\nstructure growth, and confirm the vector field as its key ingredient. Using a\nsemi-analytic approach, I further characterize the evolution of density\nperturbations and the potentials on sub- and superhorizon scales.\n", "  We consider global quenches in the quantum XY chain in a transverse field and\nstudy the nonequilibrium relaxation of the magnetization and the correlation\nfunction as well as the entanglement entropy in finite systems. For quenches in\nthe ordered phase, the exact results are well described by a semiclassical\ntheory (SCT) in terms of ballistically moving quasiparticles. In the\nthermodynamic limit the SCT is exact for the entanglement entropy and its\nmodified version following the method of Calabrese, Essler and Fagotti:\narXiv:1204.3911 is exact for the magnetization and the correlation function,\ntoo. The stationary correlation function is shown to be described by a\ngeneralized Gibbs ensemble.\n", "  In this paper, we apply the K-theory scheme of classifying the topological\ninsulators/superconductors to classify the topological classes of the massive\nmulti-flavor fermions in anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. In the context of AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence, the multi-flavor fermionic mass matrix is dual to the pattern\nof operator mixing in the boundary conformal field theory (CFT). Thus, our\nresults classify the possible patterns of operator mixings among fermionic\noperators in the holographic CFT.\n", "  We study an homogeneous irreducible markovian random walk in a square lattice\nof arbitrary dimension, with an antisymmetric perturbation acting only in one\npoint. We compute exactly spatial correction to the diffusive behaviour in the\nasympotics of probability, in the spirit of local limit theorems for random\nwalks.\n", "  We develop a new framework that extends the quantum walk framework of\nMagniez, Nayak, Roland, and Santha, by utilizing the idea of quantum data\nstructures to construct an efficient method of nesting quantum walks.\nSurprisingly, only classical data structures were considered before for\nsearching via quantum walks.\n  The recently proposed learning graph framework of Belovs has yielded improved\nupper bounds for several problems, including triangle finding and more general\nsubgraph detection. We exhibit the power of our framework by giving a simple\nexplicit constructions that reproduce both the $O(n^{35/27})$ and $O(n^{9/7})$\nlearning graph upper bounds (up to logarithmic factors) for triangle finding,\nand discuss how other known upper bounds in the original learning graph\nframework can be converted to algorithms in our framework. We hope that the\nease of use of this framework will lead to the discovery of new upper bounds.\n", "  We study the point spectrum of the nonlinear Dirac equation in any spatial\ndimension, linearized at one of the solitary wave solutions. We prove that, in\nany dimension, the linearized equation has no embedded eigenvalues in the part\nof the essential spectrum beyond the embedded thresholds.\n  We then prove that the birth of point eigenvalues with nonzero real part (the\nones which lead to linear instability) from the essential spectrum is only\npossible from the embedded eigenvalues or thresholds, and therefore can not\ntake place beyond the embedded thresholds. We also prove that \"in the\nnonrelativistic limit\" $\\omega\\to m$, the point eigenvalues can only accumulate\nto $0$ and $\\pm 2 m i$.\n", "  We report the first experimental observation of the spin Seebeck effect in\nmagnetite thin films. The signal observed at temperatures above the Verwey\ntransition is a contribution from both the anomalous Nernst (ANE) and spin\nSeebeck effects (SSE). The contribution from the ANE of the Fe3O4 layer to the\nSSE is found to be negligible due to the resistivity difference between Fe3O4\nand Pt layers. Below the Verwey transition the SSE is free from the ANE of the\nferromagnetic layer and it is also found to dominate over the ANE due to\nmagnetic proximity effect on the Pt layer.\n", "  The non-gauge vector field with as simple as possible Lagrangian\n(\\ref{Lagrangian}) turned out an adequate tool for macroscopic description of\nthe main properties of dark matter. The dependence of the velocity of a star on\nthe radius of the orbit $V\\left(r\\right) $ -- galaxy rotation curve -- is\nderived analytically from the first principles\\ completely within the\nEinstein's general relativity. The Milgrom's empirical modification of\nNewtonian dynamics in nonrelativistic limit (MOND) gets justified and specified\nin detail. In particular, the transition to a plateau is accompanied by damping\noscillations. In the scale of a galaxy, and in the scale of the whole universe,\nthe dark matter is described by a vector field with the same energy-momentum\ntensor. It is the evidence of the common physical nature. Now, when we have the\ngeneral expression (\\ref{Tik b=c=0}) for the energy-momentum tensor of dark\nmatter, it is possible to analyze its influence on the structure and evolution\nof super heavy stars and black holes.\n", "  Structural response of crystals to an applied external perturbation is\nimportant as a key for understanding microscopic origin of physical properties.\nExperimental investigation of structural response is a great challenge for\nmodern structure analysis. We demonstrate how advanced X-ray diffraction\ntechniques facilitate probing tiny (10-4 {\\AA}) distortions of bond lengths\nunder a permanent electric field. We also discuss details of the experimental\nprocedure essential for reaching such precision. We ask whether the experiment\ncan be used to evaluate chemical bonds in crystals by their sensitivity to an\nexternal electric field and discuss if the bond deformations can be predicted\nusing the bond-valence model or the Bader's theory of atoms in molecules and\ncrystals. Finally, we describe the new time-resolved studies of a structural\nresponse to a dynamical switch of applied electric field. These results give\naccess to the time-lining of piezoelectric effect on a microsecond time scale.\n", "  This paper, Part I in a two-part series, presents (i) A simple and highly\nefficient algorithm for evaluation of quasi-periodic Green functions, as well\nas (ii) An associated boundary-integral equation method for the numerical\nsolution of problems of scattering of waves by doubly periodic arrays of\nscatterers in three-dimensional space. Except for certain \"Wood frequencies\" at\nwhich the quasi-periodic Green function ceases to exist, the proposed approach,\nwhich is based on use of smooth windowing functions, gives rise to lattice sums\nwhich converge superalgebraically fast--that is, faster than any power of the\nnumber of terms used--in sharp contrast with the extremely slow convergence\nexhibited by the corresponding sums in absence of smooth windowing. (The\nWood-frequency problem is treated in Part II.) A proof presented in this paper\nestablishes rigorously the superalgebraic convergence of the windowed lattice\nsums. A variety of numerical results demonstrate the practical efficiency of\nthe proposed approach.\n", "  A variety of gravitational dynamics problems in asymptotically anti-de Sitter\n(AdS) spacetime are amenable to efficient numerical solution using a common\napproach involving a null slicing of spacetime based on infalling geodesics,\nconvenient exploitation of the residual diffeomorphism freedom, and use of\nspectral methods for discretizing and solving the resulting differential\nequations. Relevant issues and choices leading to this approach are discussed\nin detail. Three examples, motivated by applications to non-equilibrium\ndynamics in strongly coupled gauge theories, are discussed as instructive test\ncases. These are gravitational descriptions of homogeneous isotropization,\ncollisions of planar shocks, and turbulent fluid flows in two spatial\ndimensions.\n", "  This study considers a simple variation of the voter model with two competing\nparties. In particular, we represent the case of political elections, where\npeople can choose to support one of the two candidates or to remain neutral.\nPeople operate within a social network and their opinions depend on those of\nthe people with whom they interact. Therefore, they may change their opinions\nover time, which may mean supporting one particular candidate or none.\nCandidates attempt to gain people's support by interacting with them, whether\nthey are in the same social circle (i.e. neighbors) or not. In particular,\ncandidates follow a strategy of interacting for a time with people they do not\nknow (that is, people who are not their neighbors). Our analysis of the\nproposed model sought to establish which network strategies are the most\neffective for candidates to gain popular support. We found that the most\nsuitable strategy depends on the topology of the social network. Finally, we\ninvestigated the role of charisma in these dynamics. Charisma is relevant in\nseveral social contexts, since charismatic people usually exercise a strong\ninfluence over others. Our results showed that candidates' charisma is an\nimportant contributory factor to a successful network strategy in election\ncampaigns.\n", "  We develop the basics of twistor theory in de Sitter space, up to the Penrose\ntransform for free massless fields. We treat de Sitter space as fundamental, as\none does for Minkowski space in conventional introductions to twistor theory.\nThis involves viewing twistors as spinors of the de Sitter group SO(4,1). When\nattached to a spacetime point, such a twistor can be reinterpreted as a local\nSO(3,1) Dirac spinor. Our approach highlights the antipodal map in de Sitter\nspace, which gives rise to doublings in the standard relations between twistors\nand spacetime. In particular, one can generate a field with both handedness\nsigns from a single twistor function. Such fields naturally live on\nantipodally-identified de Sitter space dS_4/Z_2, which has been put forward as\nthe ideal laboratory for quantum gravity with positive cosmological constant.\n", "  We argue that, in the recent letter by A. Danan et al. [PRL 111, 240402\n(2013), arXiv:1304.7469], if weak measurements are performed such that complete\ndestructive interference is not disturbed, claims such as \"some photons have\nbeen inside the inner interferometer but they never entered and never left\"\nshould not arise. Standard quantum mechanics not only explains the physics\nbetter than the two-state vector formulation the authors advocate, but it can\ntell a very different story.\n", "  Social networks readily transmit information, albeit with less than perfect\nfidelity. We present a large-scale measurement of this imperfect information\ncopying mechanism by examining the dissemination and evolution of thousands of\nmemes, collectively replicated hundreds of millions of times in the online\nsocial network Facebook. The information undergoes an evolutionary process that\nexhibits several regularities. A meme's mutation rate characterizes the\npopulation distribution of its variants, in accordance with the Yule process.\nVariants further apart in the diffusion cascade have greater edit distance, as\nwould be expected in an iterative, imperfect replication process. Some text\nsequences can confer a replicative advantage; these sequences are abundant and\ntransfer \"laterally\" between different memes. Subpopulations of the social\nnetwork can preferentially transmit a specific variant of a meme if the variant\nmatches their beliefs or culture. Understanding the mechanism driving change in\ndiffusing information has important implications for how we interpret and\nharness the information that reaches us through our social networks.\n", "  We analyze the magnitude of the radiation pressure and electrostrictive\nstresses exerted by light confined inside GaAs semiconductor WGM optomechanical\ndisk resonators, through analytical and numerical means, and find the\nelectrostrictive force to be of prime importance. We investigate the geometric\nand photoelastic optomechanical coupling resulting respectively from the\ndeformation of the disk boundary and from the strain-induced refractive index\nchanges in the material, for various mechanical modes of the disks.\nPhotoelastic optomechanical coupling is shown to be a predominant coupling\nmechanism for certain disk dimensions and mechanical modes, leading to total\ncoupling g$_{om}$ and g$_0$ reaching respectively 3 THz/nm and 4 MHz. Finally,\nwe point towards ways to maximize the photoelastic coupling in GaAs disk\nresonators, and we provide some upper bounds for its value in various\ngeometries.\n", "  We have obtained analytical expressions for the q-dependent static spin\nsusceptibility of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides, considering both\nthe electron-doped and hole-doped cases. Our results are applied to calculate\nspin-related physical observables of monolayer MoS2, focusing especially on\nin-plane/out-of-plane anisotropies. We find that the hole-mediated RKKY\nexchange interaction for in-plane impurity-spin components decays with the\npower law $R^{-5/2}$ as a function of distance $R$, which deviates from the\n$R^{-2}$ power law normally exhibited by a two-dimensional Fermi liquid. In\ncontrast, the out-of-plane spin response shows the familiar $R^{-2}$ long-range\nbehavior. We also use the spin susceptibility to define a collective g-factor\nfor hole-doped MoS2 systems and discuss its density-dependent anisotropy.\n", "  The occupied and the unoccupied electronic structure of CeAg$_2$Ge$_2$ single\ncrystal has been studied using high resolution photoemission and inverse\nphotoemission spectroscopy respectively. High resolution photoemission reveals\nthe clear signature of Ce $4f$ states in the occupied electronic structure\nwhich was not observed earlier due to the poor resolution. The coulomb\ncorrelation energy in this system has been determined experimentally from the\nposition of the $4f$ states above and below the Fermi level. Theoretically the\ncorrelation energy has been determined by using the first principles density\nfunctional calculations within the generalized gradient approximations taking\ninto account the strong intra-atomic (on-site) interaction Hubbard $U_{eff}$\nterm. Although the valence band calculated with different $U_{eff}$ does not\nshow significant difference, but the substantial changes are observed in the\nconduction band. The estimated value of correlation energy from both the theory\nand the experiment is $\\approx$4.2~eV for CeAg$_2$Ge$_2$.\n", "  This article presents measurements of the $t$-channel single top-quark ($t$)\nand top-antiquark ($\\bar{t}$) total production cross sections $\\sigma(tq)$ and\n$\\sigma(\\bar{t}q)$, their ratio $R_{t}=\\sigma(tq)/\\sigma(\\bar{t}q)$, and a\nmeasurement of the inclusive production cross section $\\sigma(tq + \\bar{t}q)$\nin proton--proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV at the LHC. Differential\ncross sections for the $tq$ and $\\bar{t}q$ processes are measured as a function\nof the transverse momentum and the absolute value of the rapidity of $t$ and\n$\\bar{t}$, respectively. The analyzed data set was recorded with the ATLAS\ndetector and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 4.59 fb$^{-1}$.\nSelected events contain one charged lepton, large missing transverse momentum,\nand two or three jets. The cross sections are measured by performing a binned\nmaximum-likelihood fit to the output distributions of neural networks. The\nresulting measurements are $\\sigma(tq)= 46\\pm 6\\; \\mathrm{pb}$,\n$\\sigma(\\bar{t}q)= 23 \\pm 4\\; \\mathrm{pb}$, $R_{t}=2.04\\pm 0.18$, and\n$\\sigma(tq + \\bar{t}q)= 68 \\pm 8\\; \\mathrm{pb}$, consistent with the Standard\nModel expectation. The uncertainty on the measured cross sections is dominated\nby systematic uncertainties, while the uncertainty on $R_{t}$ is mainly\nstatistical. Using the ratio of $\\sigma(tq + \\bar{t}q)$ to its theoretical\nprediction, and assuming that the top-quark-related CKM matrix elements obey\nthe relation $|V_{tb}|\\gg |V_{ts}|, |V_{td}|$, we determine $|V_{tb}|=1.02 \\pm\n0.07$.\n", "  Packing problems, which ask how to arrange a collection of objects in space\nto meet certain criteria, are important in a great many physical and biological\nsystems, where geometrical arrangements at small scales control behaviour at\nlarger ones. In many systems there is no single, optimal packing that\ndominates, but rather one must understand the entire set of possible packings.\nAs a step in this direction we enumerate rigid clusters of identical hard\nspheres for $n\\leq 14$, and clusters with the maximum number of contacts for\n$n\\leq 19$. A rigid cluster is one that cannot be continuously deformed while\nmaintaining all contacts. This is a nonlinear notion that arises naturally\nbecause such clusters are the metastable states when the spheres interact with\na short-range potential, as is the case in many nano- or micro-scale systems.\nWe expect these lists are nearly complete, except for a small number of highly\nsingular clusters (linearly floppy but nonlinearly rigid.) The data contains\nsome major geometrical surprises, such as the prevalence of hypostatic\nclusters: those with less than the $3n-6$ contacts generically necessary for\nrigidity. We discuss these and several other unusual clusters, whose geometries\nmay shed insight into physical mechanisms, pose mathematical and computational\nproblems, or bring inspiration for designing new materials.\n", "  This paper reports the results of an experiment to directly measure the\ntime-resolved scintillation signal from the passage of cosmic-ray muons through\nliquid argon. Scintillation light from these muons is of value to studies of\nweakly-interacting particles in neutrino experiments and dark matter searches.\nThe experiment was carried out at the TallBo dewar facility at Fermilab using\nprototype light guide detectors and electronics developed for the Deep\nUnderground Neutrino Experiment. Two models are presented for the time\nstructure of the scintillation light, a phenomenological model and a composite\nmodel. Both models find $\\tau_{\\text{T}} = 1.52$ $\\mu$s for the decay time\nconstant of the Ar$_2^*$ triplet state. These models also show that the\nidentification of the \"early\" light fraction in the phenomenological model,\n$F_{\\text{E}}\\approx 25\\%$ of the signal, with the total light from singlet\ndecays is an underestimate. The total fraction of singlet light is\n$F_{\\text{S}} \\approx 36\\%$, where the increase over $F_{\\text{E}}$ is from\nsinglet light emitted by the wavelength shifter through processes with long\ndecay constants. The models were further used to compute the experimental\nparticle identification parameter $F_{\\text{prompt}}$, the fraction of light\ncoming in a short time window after the trigger compared with the light in the\ntotal recorded waveform. The models reproduce quite well the typical\nexperimental value $\\sim0.3$ found by dark matter and double $\\beta$-decay\nexperiments, which suggests this parameter provides a robust metric for\ndiscriminating electrons and muons from more heavily ionizing particles.\n", "  Surface tension tends to minimize the area of interfaces between pieces of\nmatter in different thermodynamic phases, be they in the solid or the liquid\nstate. This can be relevant for the macroscopic shape of very soft solids, and\nlead to a roughening of initially sharp edges. We calculate this effect for a\nneo-Hookean elastic solid, with assumptions corresponding to actual\nexperiments, namely the case where an initially sharp edge is rounded by the\neffect of surface tension felt when the fluid surrounding the soft solid (and\nso surface tension) is changed at the solid/liquid boundary. We consider two\nopposite limits where the analysis can be carried to the end, the one of a\nshallow angle and the one of a very sharp angle. Both cases yield a\ndiscontinuity of curvature in the state with surface tension although the\ninitial state had a discontinuous slope.\n", "  We discuss the time-continuous path integration in the coherent states basis\nin a way that is free from inconsistencies. Employing this notion we reproduce\nknown and exact results working directly in the continuum. Such a formalism can\nset the basis to develop perturbative and non-perturbative approximations\nalready known in the quantum field theory community. These techniques can be\nproven useful in a great variety of problems where bosonic Hamiltonians are\nused.\n", "  Itinerant and local moment magnetism have substantively different origins,\nand require distinct theoretical treatment. A unified theory of magnetism has\nlong been sought after, and remains elusive, mainly due to the limited number\nof known itinerant magnetic systems. In the case of the two such examples\ndiscovered several decades ago, the itinerant ferromagnets ZrZn_2 and Sc_3In,\nthe understanding of their magnetic ground states draws on the existence of 3d\nelectrons subject to strong spin fluctuations. Similarly, in Cr, an elemental\nitinerant antiferromagnet (IAFM) with a spin density wave (SDW) ground state,\nits 3d character has been deemed crucial to it being magnetic. Here we report\nthe discovery of the first IAFM compound with no magnetic constituents, TiAu.\nAntiferromagnetic order occurs below a Neel temperature T_N ~ 36 K, about an\norder of magnitude smaller than in Cr, rendering the spin fluctuations in TiAu\nmore important at low temperatures. This new IAFM challenges the currently\nlimited understanding of weak itinerant antiferromagnetism, while providing\nlong sought-after insights into the effects of spin fluctuations in itinerant\nelectron systems.\n", "  A theory of (co)homologies related to set-theoretic $n$-simplex relations is\nconstructed in analogy with the known quandle and Yang--Baxter (co)homologies,\nwith emphasis made on the tetrahedron case. In particular, this permits us to\ngeneralize Hietarinta's idea of \"permutation-type\" solutions to the quantum (or\n\"tensor\") $n$-simplex equations. Explicit examples of solutions to the\ntetrahedron equation involving nontrivial cocycles are presented.\n", "  A fault-tolerant quantum repeater or quantum computer using solid-state\nspin-based quantum bits will likely require a physical implementation with many\nspins arranged in a grid. Self-assembled quantum dots (QDs) have been\nestablished as attractive candidates for building spin-based quantum\ninformation processing devices, but such QDs are randomly positioned, which\nmakes them unsuitable for constructing large-scale processors. Recent efforts\nhave shown that quantum dots embedded in nanowires can be deterministically\npositioned in regular arrays, can store single charges, and have excellent\noptical properties, but so far there have been no demonstrations of spin qubit\noperations using nanowire quantum dots. Here we demonstrate optical pumping of\nindividual spins trapped in site-controlled nanowire quantum dots, resulting in\nhigh-fidelity spin-qubit initialization. This represents the next step towards\nestablishing spins in nanowire quantum dots as quantum memories suitable for\nuse in a large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computer or repeater based on\nall-optical control of the spin qubits.\n", "  The time-dependent Maxwell system describing electromagnetic wave propagation\nin inhomogeneous isotropic media in the one-dimensional case reduces to a\nVekua-type equation for bicomplex-valued functions of a hyperbolic variable\n(see arXiv:1001.0552). Using this relation we solve the problem of the\ntransmission through an inhomogeneous layer of a normally incident\nelectromagnetic time-dependent plane wave. The solution is written in terms of\na pair of Darboux-associated transmutation operators (see arXiv:1111.4449), and\ncombined with the recent results on their construction (see arXiv:1208.6166,\narXiv:1306.2914) can be used for efficient computation of the transmitted\nmodulated signals. We develop the corresponding numerical method and illustrate\nits performance with examples.\n", "  Within the Bose-Einstein statistics it is shown that the blackbody radiation\ncontains coalescent photons along with single photons. Coalescent photons were\nfirst observed in the famous Hong-Ou-Mandel experiment of 1987. For the sake of\nconvenience, $N$ coalescent photons are referred to as the $N$-photon cluster.\nIn this work, statistics of photon clusters and probability that a photon\ncluster contains $N$ photons are found versus radiation frequency and\ntemperature. Spectra of photon-cluster radiation are calculated as functions of\nblackbody temperature for different cluster ranks. Derivation of the Planck's\nradiation law is discussed in view of the existence of photon clusters in\nblackbody radiation.\n", "  During the Precambrian era, Earth's decelerating rotation would have passed a\n21-hour period that would have been resonant with the semidiurnal atmospheric\nthermal tide. Near this point, the atmospheric torque would have been\nmaximized, being comparable in magnitude but opposite in direction to the lunar\ntorque, halting Earth's rotational deceleration, maintaining a constant day\nlength, as detailed by Zahnle and Walker (1987). We develop a computational\nmodel to determine necessary conditions for formation and breakage of this\nresonant effect. Our simulations show the resonance to be resilient to\natmospheric thermal noise but suggest a sudden atmospheric temperature increase\nlike the deglaciation period following a possible \"snowball Earth\" near the end\nof the Precambrian would break this resonance; the Marinoan and Sturtian\nglaciations seem the most likely candidates for this event. Our model provides\na simulated day length over time that resembles existing paleorotational data,\nthough further data is needed to verify this hypothesis.\n", "  We present a novel approach to the regression of quantum mechanical energies\nbased on a scattering transform of an intermediate electron density\nrepresentation. A scattering transform is a deep convolution network computed\nwith a cascade of multiscale wavelet transforms. It possesses appropriate\ninvariant and stability properties for quantum energy regression. This new\nframework removes fundamental limitations of Coulomb matrix based energy\nregressions, and numerical experiments give state-of-the-art accuracy over\nplanar molecules.\n", "  We examine the effect of First Forbidden (FF) decays on $\\beta$-decay\nneutrino spectra by performing microscopic nuclear structure calculations. By\nanalyzing the FF decay branches of even-even nuclei we conclude that FF decays\nmay be responsible for part of the missing neutrinos in the so called \"Reactor\nNeutrino Anomaly\". Further calculations and more experimental data are needed\nfor a firm conclusion.\n", "  A numerical and systematic parameter study of three-dimensional vesicle\nelectrohydrodynamics is presented to investigate the effects of different fluid\nand membrane properties. The dynamics of vesicles in the presence of DC\nelectric fields is considered, both in the presence and absence of linear shear\nflow. For suspended vesicles it is shown that the conductivity ratio and\nviscosity ratio between the interior and exterior fluids, as well as the\nvesicle membrane capacitance, substantially affect the minimum electric field\nstrength required to induce a full Prolate-Oblate-Prolate transition.In\naddition, there exists a critical electric field strength above which a vesicle\nwill no longer tumble when exposed to linear shear flow.\n", "  We study the classical dynamics of many interacting particles in a\nperiodically driven one-dimensional (1D) system. We show that under the\nrotating wave approximation (RWA), a short-distance 1D interaction ($\\delta$\nfunction or hard-core interaction), becomes a long-distance two-dimensional\n(2D) interaction which only depends on the distance in the phase space of the\nrotating frame. The RWA interaction describes the effect of the interaction on\nthe slowly changing amplitude and phase of the oscillating particles, while the\nfast oscillations take on the role of a force carrier, which allows for\ninteraction over much larger effective distances.\n", "  For a pair of real or complex scattering potentials\n$v_j:\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{C}$ ($j=1,2$) with support $I_j$ and transfer matrix\n$M_j$, the transfer matrix of $v_1+v_2$ is given by the product $M_2 M_1$\nprovided that $I_1$ lies to the left of $I_2$. We explore the prospects of\ngeneralizing this composition rule for the cases that $I_1$ and $I_2$ have a\nsmall intersection. In particular, we show that if $I_1$ and $I_2$ intersect in\na finite closed interval of length $\\ell$ in which both the potentials are\nanalytic, then the lowest order correction to the above composition rule is\nproportional to $\\ell^5$. This correction is of the order of $\\ell^3$, if $v_1$\nand $v_2$ are respectively analytic throughout this interval except at $x=\\ell$\nand $x=0$. We use these results to explore the superposition of a pair of\nunidirectionally invisible potentials with overlapping support.\n", "  Open-access microcavities are emerging as a new approach to confine and\nengineer light at mode volumes down to the $\\lambda^3$ regime. They offer\ndirect access to a highly confined electromagnetic field while maintaining\ntunability of the system and flexibility for coupling to a range of matter\nsystems. This article presents a study of coupled cavities, for which the\nsubstrates are produced using Focused Ion Beam milling. Based on experimental\nand theoretical investigation the engineering of the coupling between two\nmicrocavities with radius of curvature of \\SI{6}{\\micro\\meter} is demonstrated.\nDetails are provided by studying the evolution of spectral, spatial and\npolarisation properties through the transition from isolated to coupled\ncavities. Normal mode splittings up to 20 meV are observed for total mode\nvolumes around $10 \\times \\lambda^3$. This work is of importance for future\ndevelopment of lab-on-a-chip sensors and photonic open-access devices ranging\nfrom polariton systems to quantum simulators.\n", "  We describe a dynamical phase transition occurring within a shear band at\nhigh temperature and under extremely high shear rates. With increasing\ntemperature, dislocation deformation and grain boundary sliding is supplanted\nby amorphization in a highly localized nanoscale band, which allows massive\nstrain and fracture. The mechanism is similar to shear melting and leads to\nliquid metal embrittlement at high temperature. From simulation, we find that\nthe necessary conditions are, lack of dislocation slip systems, low thermal\nconduction and temperature near the melting point. The first two are exhibited\nby bcc titanium alloys, and we show that the final one can be achieved\nexperimentally by adding low-melting point elements: specifically we use\ninsoluble rare earth metals (REMs). Under high shear, the REM becomes mixed\nwith the titanium, lowering the melting point within the shear band and\ntriggering the shear-melting transition. This in turn generates heat which\nremains localized in the shear band due to poor heat conduction. The material\nfractures along the shear band. We show how to utilize this transition in the\ncreation of new titanium-based alloys with improved machinability.\n", "  We present a statistical model which is able to capture some interesting\nfeatures exhibited in the Brazilian test. The model is based on breakable\nelements which break when the force experienced by the elements exceed their\nown load capacity. In this model when an element breaks, the capacity of the\nneighboring elements are decreased by a certain amount assuming weakening\neffect around the defected zone. We numerically investigate the stress-strain\nbehavior, the strength of the system, how it scales with the system size and\nalso it's fluctuation for both uniformly and weibull distributed breaking\nthreshold of the elements in the system. We find that the strength of the\nsystem approaches it's asymptotic value $\\sigma_c=1/6$ and $\\sigma_c=5/18$ for\nuniformly and Weibull distributed breaking threshold of the elements\nrespectively. We have also shown the damage profile right at the point when the\nstress-strain curve reaches at it's maximum and then it is compared with our\nexperimental observations.\n", "  We build the counterpart of the celebrated Nielsen's theorem for coherence\nmanipulation in this paper. This offers an affirmative answer to the open\nquestion: whether, given two states $\\rho$ and $\\sigma$, either $\\rho$ can be\ntransformed into $\\sigma$ or vice versa under incoherent operations [Phys. Rev.\nLett. \\textbf{113}, 140401(2014)]. As a consequence, we find that there exist\nessentially different types of coherence. Moreover, incoherent operations can\nbe enhanced in the presence of certain coherent states. These extra states are\ncoherent catalysts: they allow uncertain incoherent operations to be realized,\nwithout being consumed in any way. Our main result also sheds a new light on\nthe construction of coherence measures.\n", "  Topological photonic states, inspired by robust chiral edge states in\ntopological insulators, have recently been demonstrated in a few photonic\nsystems, including an array of coupled on-chip ring resonators at communication\nwavelengths. However, the intrinsic difference between electrons and photons\ndetermines that the topological protection in time-reversal-invariant photonic\nsystems does not share the same robustness as its counterpart in electronic\ntopological insulators. Here, in a designer surface plasmon platform consisting\nof tunable metallic sub-wavelength structures, we construct photonic\ntopological edge states and probe their robustness against a variety of defect\nclasses, including some common time-reversal-invariant photonic defects that\ncan break the topological protection, but do not exist in electronic\ntopological insulators. This is also the first experimental realization of\nanomalous Floquet topological edge states, whose topological phase cannot be\npredicted by the usual Chern number topological invariants.\n", "  The set of Entanglement Saving (ES) quantum channels is introduced and\ncharacterized. These are completely positive, trace preserving transformations\nwhich when acting locally on a bipartite quantum system initially prepared into\na maximally entangled configuration, preserve its entanglement even when\napplied an arbitrary number of times. In other words, a quantum channel $\\psi$\nis said to be ES if its powers $\\psi^n$ are not entanglement-breaking for all\nintegers $n$. We also characterize the properties of the Asymptotic\nEntanglement Saving (AES) maps. These form a proper subset of the ES channels\nthat is constituted by those maps which, not only preserve entanglement for all\nfinite $n$, but which also sustain an explicitly not null level of entanglement\nin the asymptotic limit~$n\\rightarrow \\infty$. Structure theorems are provided\nfor ES and for AES maps which yield an almost complete characterization of the\nformer and a full characterization of the latter.\n", "  In this paper we will present a quantization method for SPP (Surface Plasmon\nPolariton) based on Green's tensor method, which is applied usually for\nquantization of EM-field in various dielectric media. This method will be\napplied for a semi-infinite structure, which contains metal and dielectric\nregions with one interface. Moreover, by introducing the quantized SPP, we will\ninvestigate the SPP propagation in the attenuating and amplifying systems. We\nwill also consider two modes of SPP, i.e., coherent and squeezed states, and\nfinally compare the propagation of these modes in the amplifying media.\n", "  The detection and characterization of a non-classical-squeezed state of\nlight, by using two different schemes, will be presented . In the first one, in\nan one-dimensional cavity with moving mirror (non-stationary Casimir effect) in\nthe principal mode, we study the photon creation rate for two modes (squeezed\nand coherent state) of driving field. Since the cavity with moving mirror\n(similar to an optomechanical system) can be considered analogue to a Kerr-like\nmedium, so that in the second scheme, the probability amplitude for\nmulti-photons absorption in a nonlinear (Kerr) medium will be quantum\nmechanically calculated. It is shown that because of presence of nonlinear\neffects, the responses of these two systems to the squeezed versus coherent\nstate are considerably distinguishable. The drastic difference between the\nresults of these two states of light can be viewed as a proposal for detecting\nof non-classical states.\n", "  Quasiparticles in a Bose-Einstein condensate are sensitive to space-time\ndistortions. Gravitational waves can induce transformations on the state of\nphonons that can be observed through quantum state discrimination techniques.\nWe show that this method is highly robust to thermal noise and depletion. We\nderive a bound on the strain sensitivity that shows that the detection of waves\nin the kHz regime is not significantly affected by temperature in a wide range\nof parameters that are well within current experimental reach.\n", "  One of the key issues in cosmology is to establish the nature of dark energy,\nand to determine whether the equation of state evolves with time. When\nestimating this from distance measurements there is a degeneracy with the\nmatter density. We show that there exists a simple function of the dark energy\nequation of state and its first derivative which is independent of this\ndegeneracy at all redshifts, and so is a much more robust determinant of the\nevolution of dark energy than just its derivative. We show that this function\ncan be well determined at low redshift from supernovae using Gaussian\nProcesses, and that this method is far superior to a variety of\nparameterisations which are also subject to priors on the matter density. This\nshows that parametrised models give very biased constraints on the evolution of\ndark energy.\n", "  Conventional wisdom suggests that realistic quantum repeaters will require\nquasi-deterministic sources of entangled photon pairs. In contrast, we here\nstudy a quantum repeater architecture that uses simple parametric\ndown-conversion sources, as well as frequency-multiplexed multimode quantum\nmemories and photon-number resolving detectors. We show that this approach can\nsignificantly extend quantum communication distances compared to direct\ntransmission. This shows that important trade-offs are possible between the\ndifferent components of quantum repeater architectures.\n", "  We prove convergence of a class of space-time discontinuous Galerkin schemes\nfor scalar hyperbolic conservation laws. Convergence to the unique entropy\nsolution is shown for all orders of polynomial approximation, provided strictly\nmonotone flux functions and a suitable shock-capturing operator are used. The\nmain improvement, compared to previously published results of similar scope, is\nthat no streamline-diffusion stabilization is used. This is the way\ndiscontinuous Galerkin schemes were originally proposed, and are most often\nused in practice.\n", "  One of the main quests in quantum metrology, and quantum parameter estimation\nin general, is to find out the highest achievable precision with given\nresources and design schemes that attain that precision. In this article we\npresent a general framework for quantum parameter estimation which relates the\nultimate precision limit directly to the underlying dynamics. With this\nframework we present systematical methods for computing the ultimate precision\nlimit and optimal probe states. We further demonstrate the power of the\nframework by deriving a sufficient condition on when ancillary systems are not\nuseful for improving the precision limit.\n", "  The functionalities of a wide range of optical and opto-electronic devices\nare based on resonance effects and active tuning of the amplitude and\nwavelength response is often essential. Plasmonic nanostructures are an\nefficient way to create optical resonances, a prominent example is the\nextraordinary optical transmission (EOT) through arrays of nanoholes patterned\nin a metallic film. Tuning of resonances by heating, applying electrical or\noptical signals has proven to be more elusive, due to the lack of materials\nthat can induce modulation over a broad spectral range and/or at high speeds.\nHere we show that nanopatterned metals combined with phase change materials\n(PCMs) can overcome this limitation due to the large change in optical\nconstants which can be induced thermally or on an ultrafast timescale. We\ndemonstrate resonance wavelength shifts as large as 385 nm - an order of\nmagnitude higher than previously reported - by combining properly designed Au\nEOT nanostructures with Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST). Moreover, we show, through pump probe\nmeasurements, repeatable and reversible, large amplitude modulations in the\nresonances, especially at telecommunication wavelengths, over ps time scales\nand at powers far below those needed to produce a permanent phase transition.\nOur findings open a pathway to the design of hybrid metal PCM nanostructures\nwith ultrafast and widely tuneable resonance responses, which hold potential\nimpact on active nanophotonic devices such as tuneable optical filters, smart\nwindows, biosensors and reconfigurable memories.\n", "  The importance of multi-electron dynamics during the tunnel ionization of a\ncorrelated quantum system is investigated. By comparison of the solution of the\ntime-dependent Schr\u007f\\\"odinger equation (TDSE) with the time-dependent\nconfiguration interaction singles approach (TDCIS), we demonstrate the\nimportance of a multi-electron description of the tunnel ionization process\nespecially for weakly confined quantum systems. Within this context, we observe\nthat adiabatic driving by an intense light field can even enhance the\ncorrelations between still trapped electrons.\n", "  Plasmons, the collective oscillations of interacting electrons, possess\nemergent properties that dramatically alter the optical response of metals. We\npredict the existence of a new class of plasmons -- chiral Berry plasmons\n(CBPs) -- for a wide range of two-dimensional metallic systems including gapped\nDirac materials. As we show, in these materials the interplay between Berry\ncurvature and electron-electron interactions yields chiral plasmonic modes at\nzero magnetic field. The CBP modes are confined to system boundaries, even in\nthe absence of topological edge states, with chirality manifested in split\nenergy dispersions for oppositely directed plasmon waves. We unveil a rich CBP\nphenomenology and propose setups for realizing them, including in anomalous\nHall metals and optically-pumped 2D Dirac materials. Realization of CBPs will\noffer a new paradigm for magnetic field-free, sub-wavelength optical\nnon-reciprocity, in the mid IR-THz range, with tunable splittings as large as\ntens of THz, as well as sensitive all-optical diagnostics of topological bands.\n", "  We investigate the ultraviolet behaviour of quantum gravity within a\nfunctional renormalisation group approach. The present setup includes the full\nghost and graviton propagators and, for the first time, the dynamical graviton\nthree-point function. The latter gives access to the coupling of dynamical\ngravitons and makes the system minimally self-consistent. The resulting phase\ndiagram confirms the asymptotic safety scenario in quantum gravity with a\nnon-trivial UV fixed point. A well-defined Wilsonian block spinning requires\nlocality of the flow in momentum space. This property is discussed in the\ncontext of functional renormalisation group flows. We show that momentum\nlocality of graviton correlation functions is non-trivially linked to\ndiffeomorphism invariance, and is realised in the present setup.\n", "  We derive an effective Hamiltonian for a (001)-confined quasi-two-dimensional\nhole gas in a strained zincblende semiconductor heterostructure including both\nRashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling. In the presence of uniaxial strain\nalong the $\\left\\langle110\\right\\rangle$ axes, we find a conserved spin\nquantity in the vicinity of the Fermi contours in the lowest valence subband.\nIn contrast to previous works, this quantity meets realistic requirements for\nthe Luttinger parameters. For more restrictive conditions, we even find a\nconserved spin quantity for vanishing strain, restricted to the vicinity of the\nFermi surface.\n", "  We study the decay width of the Higgs-boson $H\\to gg$ up to order\n$\\alpha_s^5$ under the minimal momentum space subtraction scheme (mMOM-scheme).\nTo improve the accuracy of perturbative QCD prediction, we adopt the principle\nof maximum conformality (PMC) to set its renormalization scales. A detailed\ncomparison of the total decay width and the separate decay widths at each\nperturbative order before and after the PMC scale setting is presented. The PMC\nadopts the renormalization group equation to fix the optimal scales of the\nprocess. After the PMC scale setting, the scale-dependence for both the total\nand the separate decay widths are greatly suppressed, and the convergence of\nperturbative QCD series is improved. By taking the Higgs mass $M_H=125.09\\pm\n0.21\\pm 0.11$ GeV, as recently given by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations, we\npredict $\\Gamma(H\\to gg)|_{\\rm mMOM, PMC} = 339.1\\pm 1.7^{+4.0}_{-2.4}$ keV,\nwhere the first error is for Higgs mass and the second error is the residual\nscale dependence by varying the initial scale $\\mu_r\\in[M_H/2,4M_H]$.\n", "  Within the scope of Bianchi type-VI cosmological model we study the role of\nspinor field in the evolution of the Universe. It is found that due to the\nspinor affine connections the energy-momentum tensor of the spinor field\npossesses non-diagonal components. The non-triviality of non-diagonal\ncomponents of the energy-momentum tensor imposes some severe restrictions\neither on the spinor field or on the metric functions or on both of them. But\nunlike in cases of Bianchi type-I or $VI_0$, in case of Bianchi type-VI model\nit does not lead to the elimination of spinor field nonlinearity or mass term\nin the spinor field Lagrangian. It is also found that depending on the sign of\nself-coupling constant the model can give rise to late time acceleration or\ngenerate oscillatory mode of evolution.\n", "  A quantized form of Surface Plasmon Polariton (SPP) modes propagating on the\nmetal thin film is provided, which is based on the Green's tensor method. Since\nthe media will be considered lossy and dispersive, the amplification and\nattenuation of the SPP modes in various dielectric media, by applying different\nfield frequencies, can be studied. We will also illustrate the difference\nbetween behavior of coherent and squeezed SPP modes in the amplifying media.\n", "  We study a three-state (leftist, rightist, centrist) model that couples the\ndynamics of social balance with an external deradicalizing field. The\nmean-field analysis shows that there exists a critical value of the external\nfield $p_c$ such that for a weak external field ($p$$<$$p_c$), the system\nexhibits a metastable fixed point and a saddle point in addition to a stable\nfixed point. However, if the strength of the external field is sufficiently\nlarge ($p$$>$$p_c$), there is only one (stable) fixed point which corresponds\nto an all-centrist consensus state (absorbing state). In the weak-field regime,\nthe convergence time to the absorbing state is evaluated using the\nquasi-stationary distribution and is found to be in agreement with the results\nobtained by numerical simulations.\n", "  We revisit the phenomenon of spinodals in the presence of quenched disorder\nand develop a complete theory for it. We focus on the spinodal of an Ising\nmodel in a quenched random field (RFIM), which has applications in many areas\nfrom materials to social science. By working at zero temperature in the\nquasi-statically driven RFIM, thermal fluctuations are eliminated and one can\ngive a rigorous content to the notion of spinodal. We show that the latter is\ndue to the depinning and the subsequent expansion of rare droplets. We work out\nthe associated critical behavior, which, in any finite dimension, is very\ndifferent from the mean-field one: the characteristic length diverges\nexponentially and the thermodynamic quantities display very mild\nnonanalyticities much like in a Griffith phenomenon. From the recently\nestablished connection between the spinodal of the RFIM and glassy dynamics,\nour results also allow us to conclusively assess the physical content and the\nstatus of the dynamical transition predicted by the mean-field theory of\nglass-forming liquids.\n", "  Two-dimensional (2D) crystalline colloidal monolayers sliding over a\nlaser-induced optical lattice recently emerged as a new tool for the study of\nfriction between ideal crystal surfaces. Here we focus in particular on static\nfriction, the minimal sliding force necessary to depin one lattice from the\nother. If the colloid and the optical lattices are mutually commensurate, the\ncolloid sliding is always pinned by static friction; but when they are\nincommensurate the presence or absence of pinning can be expected to depend\nupon the system parameters. If a 2D analogy to the mathematically established\nAubry transition of one-dimensional systems were to hold, an increasing\nperiodic corrugation strength $U_0$ should turn an initially free-sliding\nmonolayer into a pinned state through a well-defined dynamical phase\ntransition. We address this problem by the simulated sliding of a realistic\nmodel 2D colloidal lattice, confirming the existence of a clear and sharp\nsuperlubric-pinned transition for increasing corrugation strength. Unlike the\n1D Aubry transition which is continuous, the 2D transition exhibits a definite\nfirst-order character. With no change of symmetry, the transition entails a\nstructural character, with a sudden increase of the colloid-colloid interaction\nenergy, accompanied by a compensating downward jump of the colloid-corrugation\nenergy. The transition value for the corrugation amplitude $U_0$ depends upon\nthe misalignment angle $\\theta$ between the optical and the colloidal lattices,\nsuperlubricity surviving until larger corrugations for angles away from the\nenergetically favored orientation, which is itself generally slightly\nmisaligned, as shown in recent work. The observability of the\nsuperlubric-pinned colloid transition is proposed and discussed.\n", "  A full strength Coulomb interaction between trapped electrons can be felt\nonly in absence of a neutralizing background. In order to study quantum\ndegenerate electrons without such a background, an external trap is needed to\ncompensate for the strong electronic repulsion. As a basic model for such a\nsystem, we study a trapped electron pair in a harmonic trap with an explicit\ninclusion of its Coulomb interaction. We find the eigenenergy of the ground\nstate, confirming earlier work in the context of harmonium. We extend this to a\ncomplete set of properly scaled energies for any value of the trapping\nstrength, including the excited states. The problem is solved either\nnumerically or by making harmonic approximations to the potential. As function\nof the trapping strength a crossover can be made from the strongly to the\nweakly-coupled regime, and we show that in both regimes perturbative methods\nbased on a pair-wise electron description would be effective for a\nmany-particle trapped electron system, which resembles a Wigner crystal in the\nground state of the strongly coupled limit.\n", "  Based on rigorous scattering theory we establish a systematic methodology for\nresearch of metamaterial-modified current-carrying conductors, from which we\nmathematically demonstrate the explanation of transformation optics could be\nextended in metamaterial-modified wireless power transfer system, and based on\nthat we could establish a equivalent model. More important, our demonstration\nreveals that the equivalent model will still be applicable even when TO could\nnot give a direct explanation, as the requirements of complementary media is\nnot satisfied. And numerical results from our methodology as well as COMSOL\nverified our findings. The demonstration is not under specific frequency, the\nconclusion could be extended to a broad range of wavelength, and expected to be\napplicable for active cloak etc.\n", "  To ensure the correctness of network analysis methods, the network (as the\ninput) has to be a sufficiently accurate representation of the underlying data.\nHowever, when representing sequential data from complex systems such as global\nshipping traffic or web clickstream traffic as networks, conventional network\nrepresentations that implicitly assume the Markov property (first-order\ndependency) can quickly become limiting. This assumption holds that when\nmovements are simulated on the network, the next movement depends only on the\ncurrent node, discounting the fact that the movement may depend on several\nprevious steps. However, we show that data derived from many complex systems\ncan show up to fifth-order dependencies. In these cases, the oversimplifying\nassumption of the first-order network representation can lead to inaccurate\nnetwork analysis results. To address this problem, we propose the Higher-Order\nNetwork (HON) representation that can discover and embed variable orders of\ndependencies in a network representation. Through a comprehensive empirical\nevaluation and analysis, we establish several desirable characteristics of HON,\nincluding accuracy, scalability, and direct compatibility with the existing\nsuite of network analysis methods. We illustrate how HON can be applied to a\nbroad variety of tasks, such as random walking, clustering, and ranking, and we\ndemonstrate that by using it as input, HON yields more accurate results without\nany modification to these tasks.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the backaction of a sensor quantum dot with\nstrong local Coulomb repulsion on the transient dynamics of a qubit that is\nprobed capacitively. We show that the measurement backaction induced by the\nnoise of electron cotunneling through the sensor is surprisingly mitigated by\nthe recently identified coherent backaction [PRB 89, 195405] arising from\nquantum fluctuations. This renormalization effect is missing in semiclassical\nstochastic fluctuator models and typically also in Born-Markov approaches,\nwhich try to avoid the calculation of the nonstationary, nonequilibrium state\nof the qubit plus sensor. Technically, we integrate out the current-carrying\nelectrodes to obtain kinetic equations for the joint, nonequilibrium\ndetector-qubit dynamics. We show that the sensor-current response, level\nrenormalization, cotunneling, and leading non-Markovian corrections always\nappear together and cannot be turned off individually in an experiment or\nignored theoretically. We analyze the backaction on the reduced qubit state -\ncapturing the full non-Markovian effects imposed by the sensor quantum dot on\nthe qubit - by applying a Liouville-space decomposition into quasistationary\nand rapidly decaying modes. Importantly, the sensor cannot be eliminated\ncompletely even in the simplest high-temperature, weak-measurement limit: The\nqubit state experiences an initial slip that persists over many qubit cycles\nand depends on the initial preparation of qubit plus sensor quantum dot. A\nquantum-dot sensor can thus not be modeled as a 'black box' without accounting\nfor its dynamical variables. We furthermore find that the Bloch vector relaxes\n(T1) along an axis that is not orthogonal to the plane in which the Bloch\nvector dephases (T2), blurring the notions of T1 and T2 times. Finally, the\nprecessional motion of the Bloch vector is distorted into an ellipse in the\ntilted dephasing plane.\n", "  The phenomenon of radicalization is investigated within a mixed population\ncomposed of core and sensitive subpopulations. The latest includes first to\nthird generation immigrants. Respective ways of life may be partially\nincompatible. In case of a conflict core agents behave as inflexible about the\nissue. In contrast, sensitive agents can decide either to live peacefully\nadjusting their way of life to the core one, or to oppose it with eventually\njoining violent activities. The interplay dynamics between peaceful and\nopponent sensitive agents is driven by pairwise interactions. These\ninteractions occur both within the sensitive population and by mixing with core\nagents. The update process is monitored using a Lotka-Volterra-like Ordinary\nDifferential Equation. Given an initial tiny minority of opponents that coexist\nwith both inflexible and peaceful agents, we investigate implications on the\nemergence of radicalization. Opponents try to turn peaceful agents to opponents\ndriving radicalization. However, inflexible core agents may step in to bring\nback opponents to a peaceful choice thus weakening the phenomenon. The required\nminimum individual core involvement to actually curb radicalization is\ncalculated.It is found to be a function of both the majority or minority status\nof the sensitive subpopulation with respect to the core subpopulation and the\ndegree of activeness of opponents. The results highlight the instrumental role\ncore agents can have to hinder radicalization within the sensitive\nsubpopulation. Some hints are outlined to favor novel public policies towards\nsocial integration.\n", "  The nuclear symmetry energy coefficient (including the coefficient $a_{\\rm\nsym}^{(4)}$ of $I^{4}$ term) of finite nuclei is extracted by using the\ndifferences of available experimental binding energies of isobaric nuclei. It\nis found that the extracted symmetry energy coefficient $a^{*}_{\\rm sym}(A,I)$\ndecreases with increasing of isospin asymmetry $I$, which is mainly caused by\nWigner correction, since $e^{*}_{\\rm sym}$ is the summation of the traditional\nsymmetry energy $e_{\\rm sym}$ and the Wigner energy $e_{\\rm W}$. We obtain the\noptimal values $J=30.25\\pm0.10$ MeV, $a_{\\rm ss}=56.18\\pm1.25$ MeV, $a_{\\rm\nsym}^{(4)}=8.33\\pm1.21$ MeV and the Wigner parameter $x=2.38\\pm0.12$ through\nthe polynomial fit to 2240 measured binding energies for nuclei with $20 \\leq A\n\\leq 261$ with an rms deviation of 23.42 keV. We also find that the volume\nsymmetry coefficient $J\\simeq 30$ MeV is insensitive to the value $x$, whereas\nthe surface symmetry coefficient $a_{\\rm ss}$ and the coefficient $a_{\\rm\nsym}^{(4)}$ are very sensitive to the value of $x$ in the range $1\\leq x\\leq\n4$. The contribution of $a_{\\rm sym}^{(4)}$ term increases rapidly with\nincreasing of isospin asymmetry $I$. For very neutron-rich nuclei, the\ncontribution of $a_{\\rm sym}^{(4)}$ term will play an important role.\n", "  We investigate theoretically the possibility to observe dynamical mode\nlocking, in the form of Shapiro steps, when a time-periodic potential or force\nmodulation is applied to a two-dimensional (2D) lattice of colloidal particles\nthat are dragged by an external force over an optically generated periodic\npotential. Here we present realistic molecular dynamics simulations of a 2D\nexperimental setup, where the colloid sliding is realized through the motion of\nsoliton lines between locally commensurate patches or domains, and where the\nShapiro steps are predicted and analyzed. Interestingly, the jump between one\nstep and the next is seen to correspond to a fixed number of colloids jumping\nfrom one patch to the next, across the soliton line boundary, during each AC\ncycle. In addition to ordinary \"integer\" steps, coinciding here with the\nsynchronous rigid advancement of the whole colloid monolayer, our main\nprediction is the existence of additional smaller \"subharmonic\" steps due to\nlocalized solitonic regions of incommensurate layers executing synchronized\nslips, while the majority of the colloids remains pinned to a potential\nminimum. The current availability and wide parameter tunability of colloid\nmonolayers makes these predictions potentially easy to access in an\nexperimentally rich 2D geometrical configuration.\n", "  A control mechanism for stopping x-ray pulses in resonant nuclear media is\ninvestigated theoretically. We show that narrow-band x-ray pulses can be mapped\nand stored as nuclear coherence in a thin-film planar x-ray cavity with an\nembedded $^{57}\\mathrm{Fe}$ nuclear layer. The pulse is nearly resonant to the\n14.4 keV M\\\"ossbauer transition in the $^{57}\\mathrm{Fe}$ nuclei. The role of\nthe control field is played here by a hyperfine magnetic field which induces\ninterference effects reminding of electromagnetically induced transparency. We\nshow that by switching off the control magnetic field, a narrow-band x-ray\npulse can be completely stored in the cavity for approximately 100 ns.\nAdditional manipulation of the external magnetic field can lead to both group\nvelocity and phase control of the pulse in the x-ray cavity sample.\n", "  Sharp nanoscale tips on metal surfaces of electrodes enhance locally applied\nelectric fields. Strongly enhanced electric fields trigger electron field\nemission and atom evaporation from the apexes of the nanotips. Combined\ntogether, these processes may explain electric discharges in form of small\nlocal arcs observed near metal surfaces in the presence of electric fields even\nin ultra high vacuum conditions. In the present work we investigate the\nstability of nanoscale tips by means of computer simulations of surface\ndiffusion processes on copper (Cu), the main material of high voltage\nelectronics. We study the stability and life-time of thin Cu surface nanotips\nat different temperatures in terms of diffusion processes. For this purpose, we\nhave developed a surface Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) model where the jump\nprocesses are described by tabulated precalculated energy barriers. We show\nthat tall surface features with high aspect ratios can be fairly stable at room\ntemperature. However, the stability was found to depend strongly on the\ntemperature: 13 nm nanotips with the major axes in the <110> crystallographic\ndirections were found to flatten down to half of the original height in less\nthan 100 ns at temperatures close to the melting point, whereas no significant\nchange in the height of these nanotips was observed after 10 $\\mu$s at room\ntemperature. Moreover, the nanotips built up along the <110> crystallographic\ndirections were found significantly more stable than those oriented in the\n<100> or <111> crystallographic directions. The proposed KMC model has been\nfound well suited for simulating atomic surfaces processes and was validated\nagainst Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation results via the comparison of the\nflattening times obtained by both methods. We also note that the KMC\nsimulations were two orders of magnitude computationally faster than the\ncorresponding MD calculations.\n", "  A local excitation in a quantum many-spin system evolves deterministically. A\ntime-reversal procedure, involving the inversion of the signs of every energy\nand interaction, should produce the excitation revival. This idea,\nexperimentally coined in NMR, embodies the concept of the Loschmidt echo (LE).\nWhile such an implementation involves a single spin autocorrelation $M_{1,1}$,\ni.e. a local LE, theoretical efforts have focused on the study of the recovery\nprobability of a complete many-body state, referred here as global or many-body\nLE $M_{MB}$. Here, we analyze the relation between these magnitudes, in what\nconcerns to their characteristic time scales and their dependence on the number\nof spins $N$. We show that the global LE can be understood, to some extent, as\nthe simultaneous occurrence of $N$ independent local LEs, i.e. $M_{MB}\\sim\n\\left( M_{1,1}\\right) ^{N/4}$. This extensive hypothesis is exact for very\nshort times and confirmed numerically beyond such a regime. Furthermore, we\ndiscuss a general picture of the decay of $M_{1,1}$ as a consequence of the\ninterplay between the time scale that characterizes the reversible interactions\n($T_{2}$) and that of the perturbation ($\\tau _{\\Sigma }$). Our analysis\nsuggests that the short time decay, characterized by the time scale $\\tau\n_{\\Sigma }$, is greatly enhanced by the complex processes that occur beyond\n$T_{2}$ . This would ultimately lead to the experimentally observed $T_{3},$\nwhich was found to be roughly independent of $\\tau _{\\Sigma }$ but closely tied\nto $T_{2}$.\n", "  We study the compositeness of near-threshold quasi-bound states in the\nframework of effective field theory. From the viewpoint of the low-energy\nuniversality, we revisit the model-independent relations between the structure\nof the bound state and the observables in the weak binding limit. The effective\nfield theory is utilized to generalize the weak-binding relation of the stable\nbound states to unstable quasi-bound states with decay modes. We present the\ninterpretation of the complex values of the compositeness for the unstable\nstates. Combining the model-independent relation and the threshold observables\nextracted from the experimental data, we show that Lambda(1405) is dominated by\nthe Kbar N molecular structure and that a_0(980) is dominated by the non-Kbar K\ncomponent.\n", "  Recently, the first example of two-neutron decay from the ground state of an\nunbound nucleus, $^{16}$Be, was seen. Three-body methods are ideal for exactly\ntreating the degrees of freedom important for these decays. Using a basis\nexpansion over hyperspherical harmonics and the hyperspherical R-matrix method,\nwe construct a realistic model of $^{16}$Be in order to investigate its decay\nmode and the role of the two-neutron interaction. The neutron-$^{14}$Be\ninteraction is constrained using shell model predictions. We obtain a ground\nstate for $^{16}$Be that is over-bound by approximately 1 MeV with a width of\napproximately 0.23 MeV. This suggests, that for such systems, the three-body\nforce needs to be repulsive.\n", "  The conservation of mass is common issue with multiphase fluid simulations.\nIn this work a novel projection method is presented which conserves mass both\nlocally and globally. The fluid pressure is augmented with a time-varying\ncomponent which accounts for any global mass change. The resulting system of\nequations is solved using an efficient Schur-complement method. Using the\nproposed method four numerical examples are performed: the evolution of a\nstatic bubble, the rise of a bubble, the breakup of a thin fluid thread, and\nthe extension of a droplet in shear flow. The method is capable of conserving\nthe mass even in situations with morphological changes such as droplet breakup.\n", "  Transport of subwavelength electromagnetic (EM) energy has been achieved\nthrough near-field coupling of highly confined surface EM modes supported by\nplasmonic nanoparticles, in a configuration usually staying on a\ntwo-dimensional (2D) substrate. Vertical transport of similar modes along the\nthird dimension, on the other hand, can bring more flexibility in designs of\nfunctional photonic devices, but this phenomenon has not been observed in\nreality. In this paper, designer (or spoof) surface plasmon resonators\n(plasmonic meta-atoms) are stacked in the direction vertical to their\nindividual planes in demonstrating vertical transport of subwavelength\nlocalized surface EM modes. Dispersion relation of this vertical transport is\ndetermined from coupled mode theory and is verified with near-field\ntransmission spectrum and field mapping with a microwave near-field scanning\nstage. This work extends the near-field coupled resonator optical waveguide\n(CROW) theory into the vertical direction, and may find applications in novel\nthree-dimensional slow light structures, filters, and photonic circuits.\n", "  The Hamamatsu R11410 and R8520 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) are designed for\napplications in dark matter detectors using liquid xenon, featuring excellent\nsensitivity to VUV light and stable operability at cryogenic temperatures. For\neleven R11410 and seven R8520 PMTs, we measured the relative photo-detection\nsensitivity at 470nm as a function of the position of the incident light on the\nphotocathode. Considering 80% of the photocathode surfaces, the observed\nnon-uniformity values are in the ranges of (5-10)% and (25-30)% for the R11410\nand R8520 models, respectively. We found that the non-uniformity in the inner\nregion of the photocathode surface is dominated by light reflections on the\ninternal components of the photosensors and that the border regions contribute\ndominantly to the observed non-uniformity.\n", "  It is well known that by modifying the wavefront in a certain manner, the\nlight intensity can be turned into a certain shape. However, all known light\nmodulation techniques allow for limited light modifications only: focusing\nwithin a restricted region in space, shaping into a certain class of parametric\ncurves along the optical axis or bending described by a quadratic-dependent\ndeflection as in the case of Airy beams. We show a general case of classical\nlight wavefront shaping that allows for intensity and phase redistribution into\nan arbitrary profile including pre-determined switching-off of the intensity.\nTo create an arbitrary three-dimensional path of intensity, we represent the\npath as a sequence of closely packed individual point-like absorbers and\nsimulate the in-line hologram of the created object set; when such a hologram\nis contrast inverted, thus giving rise to a diffractor, it creates the\npre-determined three-dimensional path of intensity behind the diffractor under\nillumination. The crucial parameter for a smooth optical path is the sampling\nof the predetermined curves, which is given by the lateral and axial resolution\nof the optical system. We provide both, simulated and experimental results to\ndemonstrate the power of this novel method.\n", "  We propose an implementation of a quantum router for microwave photons in a\nsuperconducting qubit architecture consisting of a transmon qubit, SQUIDs and a\nnonlinear capacitor. We model and analyze the dynamics of operation of the\nquantum switch using quantum Langevin equations in a scattering approach and\ncompute the photon reflection and transmission probabilities. For parameters\ncorresponding to up-to-date experimental devices we predict successful\noperation of the router with probabilities above 94%.\n", "  Radiatively induced symmetry breaking is considered for a toy model with one\nscalar and one fermion field unified in a superfield. It is shown that the\nclassical quartic self-interaction of the superfield possesses a quantum\ninfrared singularity. Application of the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism for\neffective potential leads to the appearance of condensates and masses for both\nscalar and fermion components. That induces a spontaneous breaking of the\ninitial classical symmetries: the supersymmetry and the conformal one. The\nenergy scales for the scalar and fermion condensates appear to be of the same\norder, while the renormalization scale is many orders of magnitude higher. A\npossibility to relate the considered toy model to conformal symmetry breaking\nin the Standard Model is discussed.\n", "  We consider the current-induced dynamics of insulating antiferromagnets in a\nspin Hall geometry. Sufficiently large in-plane currents perpendicular to the\nN\\'{e}el order trigger spontaneous oscillations at frequencies between the\nacoustic and the optical eigenmodes. The direction of the driving current\ndetermines the chirality of the excitation. When the current exceeds a\nthreshold, the combined effect of spin pumping and current-induced torques\nintroduces a dynamic feedback that sustains steady-state oscillations with\namplitudes controllable via the applied current. The ac voltage output is\ncalculated numerically as a function of the dc current input for different\nfeedback strengths. Our findings open a route towards terahertz\nantiferromagnetic spin-torque oscillators.\n", "  A class of nucleosome remodeling motors translocate nucleosomes, to which\nthey are attached, toward the middle of DNA chain in the presence of ATP during\nin vitro experiments. Such a biological activity is likely based on a physical\nmechanism for detecting and comparing the lengths of the flanking polymer\nchains. Here we propose that a pivoting mode of DNA fluctuation near the\nsurface of the nucleosome coupled with binding reaction with a DNA binding site\nof the motor provides a physical basis for length detection. Since the mean\nfrequency of fluctuation is higher for a shorter chain than a longer one due to\nits lower drag coefficient, a shorter chain has a higher rate of receptor\nbinding, which triggers the ATP-dependent activity of the remodeling motor.\nDimerization of such units allows the motor to compare the length of the\nflanking DNA chains, enabling the translocation of the nucleosome toward the\ncenter of the DNA.\n", "  Quantum key distribution (QKD) allows for communication with security\nguaranteed by quantum theory. The main theoretical problem in QKD is to\ncalculate the secret key rate for a given protocol. Analytical formulas are\nknown for protocols with symmetries, since symmetry simplifies the analysis.\nHowever, experimental imperfections break symmetries, hence the effect of\nimperfections on key rates is difficult to estimate. Furthermore, it is an\ninteresting question whether (intentionally) asymmetric protocols could\noutperform symmetric ones. Here, we develop a robust numerical approach for\ncalculating the key rate for arbitrary discrete-variable QKD protocols.\nUltimately this will allow researchers to study \"unstructured\" protocols, that\nis, those that lack symmetry. Our approach relies on transforming the key rate\ncalculation to the dual optimization problem, which dramatically reduces the\nnumber of parameters and hence the calculation time. We illustrate our method\nby investigating some unstructured protocols for which the key rate was\npreviously unknown.\n", "  Using an explicit path integral approach we derive non-abelian bosonization\nand duality of 3D systems in the large $N$ limit. We first consider a fermionic\n$U(N)$ vector model coupled to level $k$ Chern-Simons theory, following\nstandard techniques we gauge the original global symmetry and impose the\ncorresponding field strength $F_{\\mu\\nu}$ to vanish introducing a Lagrange\nmultiplier $\\Lambda$. Exchanging the order of integrations we obtain the\nbosonized theory with $\\Lambda$ as the propagating field using the large $N$\nrather than the previously used large mass limit. Next we follow the same\nprocedure to dualize the scalar $U(N)$ vector model coupled to Chern-Simons and\nfind its corresponding dual theory. Finally, we compare the partition functions\nof the two resulting theories and find that they agree in the large $N$ limit\nincluding a level/rank duality. This provides a constructive evidence for\nprevious proposals on level/rank duality of 3D vector models in the large $N$\nlimit. We also present a partial analysis at subleading order in large $N$ and\nfind that the duality does not generically hold at this level.\n", "  A disformal coupling between two scalar fields is considered in the context\nof cosmological inflation. The coupling introduces novel derivative\ninteractions mixing the kinetic terms of the fields but without introducing\nsuperluminal or unstable propagation of the two scalar fluctuation modes.\nThough the typical effect of the disformal coupling is to inhibit one of the\nfields from inflating the universe, the energy density of the other field can\ndrive viable near Sitter -inflation in the presence of nontrivial disformal\ndynamics, in particular when one assumes exponential instead of power-law form\nfor the couplings. The linear perturbation equations are written for the\ntwo-field system, its canonical degrees of freedom are quantised, their spectra\nare derived and the inflationary predictions are reported for numerically\nsolved exponential models. A generic prediction is low tensor-to-scalar ratio.\n", "  In a wide class of new physics models, there exist scalar fields that obtain\nvacuum expectation values of high energy scales. We study the possibility that\nthe standard model Higgs field has experienced first order phase transition at\nthe high energy scale due to the couplings with these scalar fields. We\nestimate the amount of gravitational waves produced by the phase transition,\nand discuss observational consequences.\n", "  In an ordinary three-dimensional metal the Fermi surface forms a\ntwo-dimensional closed sheet separating the filled from the empty states.\nTopological semimetals, on the other hand, can exhibit protected\none-dimensional Fermi lines or zero-dimensional Fermi points, which arise due\nto an intricate interplay between symmetry and topology of the electronic\nwavefunctions. Here, we study how reflection symmetry, time-reversal symmetry,\nSU(2) spin-rotation symmetry, and inversion symmetry lead to the topological\nprotection of line nodes in three-dimensional semi-metals. We obtain the\ncrystalline invariants that guarantee the stability of the line nodes in the\nbulk and show that a quantized Berry phase leads to the appearance of protected\nsurfaces states with a nearly flat dispersion. By deriving a relation between\nthe crystalline invariants and the Berry phase, we establish a direct\nconnection between the stability of the line nodes and the topological surface\nstates. As a representative example of a topological semimetal with line nodes,\nwe consider Ca$_3$P$_2$ and discuss the topological properties of its Fermi\nline in terms of a low-energy effective theory and a tight-binding model,\nderived from ab initio DFT calculations. Due to the bulk-boundary\ncorrespondence, Ca$_3$P$_2$ displays nearly dispersionless surface states,\nwhich take the shape of a drumhead. These surface states could potentially give\nrise to novel topological response phenomena and provide an avenue for exotic\ncorrelation physics at the surface.\n", "  The de Broglie-Bohm pilot-wave formulation of quantum theory allows the\nexistence of physical states that violate the Born probability rule. Recent\nwork has shown that in pilot-wave field theory on expanding space relaxation to\nthe Born rule is suppressed for long-wavelength field modes, resulting in a\nlarge-scale power deficit {\\xi}(k) which for a radiation-dominated expansion is\nfound to have an approximate inverse-tangent dependence on k (assuming that the\nwidth of the initial distribution is smaller than the width of the initial\nBorn-rule distribution and that the initial quantum states are evenly-weighted\nsuperpositions of energy states). In this paper we show that the functional\nform of {\\xi}(k) is robust under changes in the initial nonequilibrium\ndistribution -- subject to the limitation of a subquantum width -- as well as\nunder the addition of an inflationary era at the end of the radiation-dominated\nphase. In both cases the predicted deficit {\\xi}(k) remains an inverse-tangent\nfunction of k. Furthermore, with the inflationary phase the dependence of the\nfitting parameters on the number of superposed pre-inflationary energy states\nis comparable to that found previously. Our results indicate that, for the\nassumed broad class of initial conditions, an inverse-tangent power deficit is\nlikely to be a fairly general and robust signature of quantum relaxation in the\nearly universe.\n", "  The analysis of multilayer networks is among the most active areas of network\nscience, and there are now several methods to detect dense \"communities\" of\nnodes in multilayer networks. One way to define a community is as a set of\nnodes that trap a diffusion-like dynamical process (usually a random walk) for\na long time. In this view, communities are sets of nodes that create\nbottlenecks to the spreading of a dynamical process on a network. We analyze\nthe local behavior of different random walks on multiplex networks (which are\nmultilayer networks in which different layers correspond to different types of\nedges) and show that they have very different bottlenecks that hence correspond\nto rather different notions of what it means for a set of nodes to be a good\ncommunity. This has direct implications for the behavior of community-detection\nmethods that are based on these random walks.\n", "  Organic ferroelectric layers sandwiched between the graphene sheets are\npresented as a model of the solar cell. The investigated systems display many\nadvantageous properties: 1) the cascade energy-levels alignment, 2)\nsimultaneous donor and acceptor character depending on the charge-carrier\ndirection, 3) the charge-transfer excitonic type, 4) the induced polarization\nof the electrodes, leading to a substantial work-function change of the anode\nand cathode - around +/-1.5 eV, respectively.\n", "  When Morris and Thorne first proposed the possible existence of traversable\nwormholes, they adopted the following strategy: maintain complete control over\nthe geometry, thereby leaving open the determination of the stress-energy\ntensor. In this paper we determine this tensor by starting with a\nnoncommutative-geometry background and assuming that the static and spherically\nsymmetric spacetime admits conformal motions. This had been established in a\nprevious collaboration with Rahaman et al. using a slightly different approach.\nAccordingly, the main purpose of this paper is to show that the wormhole\nobtained can be made stable to linearized radial perturbations.\n", "  We study the Higgs derivative interactions on models including arbitrary\nnumber of the Higgs doublets. These interactions are generated by two ways. One\nis higher order corrections of composite Higgs models, and the other is\nintegrating out heavy scalars and vectors. In the latter case, three point\ncouplings between the Higgs doublets and them are the sources of the derivative\ninteractions. The representations of these heavy particles are constrained to\ncouple with the doublets. We explicitly calculate the all derivative\ninteractions generated by integrating out. Their degrees of freedom and\nconditions to impose the custodial symmetry are discussed. We also study the\nvector boson scattering processes with a couple of two Higgs doublet models to\nsee experimental signals of the derivative interactions. They are differently\naffected by each heavy field.\n", "  We study the ultraviolet stability of gravity-matter systems for general\nnumbers of minimally coupled scalars and fermions. This is done within the\nfunctional renormalisation group setup put forward in\n\\cite{Christiansen:2015rva} for pure gravity. It includes full dynamical\npropagators and a genuine dynamical Newton's coupling, which is extracted from\nthe graviton three-point function.\n  We find ultraviolet stability of general gravity-fermion systems.\nGravity-scalar systems are also found to be ultraviolet stable within validity\nbounds for the chosen generic class of regulators, based on the size of the\nanomalous dimension. Remarkably, the ultraviolet fixed points for the dynamical\ncouplings are found to be significantly different from those of their\nassociated background counterparts, once matter fields are included. In\nsummary, the asymptotic safety scenario does not put constraints on the matter\ncontent of the theory within the validity bounds for the chosen generic class\nof regulators.\n", "  In building up composite structures using carbon nanotube (CNT) fibers, the\nfiber-to-matrix interfacial shear strength (IFSS) is one of the most important\nissues. Originating from the assembly characteristics of CNT fiber, the IFSS\nstrongly depends on the fiber's twisting level and densification level.\nFurthermore, there are rich ways to modify the fiber surface and thus enhance\nthe IFSS, including the physical and chemical modification on fiber surface,\nthe infiltration of matrix resin into CNT fiber, and the introduction of silane\ncoupling agent. A new feature differing from carbon fibers is that all these\ntreatments either change the fiber's surface structure or form a\nseveral-hundreds-nm-thick interphase inside rather than around the fiber. These\n\"generalized\" treatments obviously extend the common concept of surface sizing\nand can be used for various forms of CNT assembly structures.\n", "  We recently demonstrated orders of magnitude enhancement of two-photon\nabsorption (2PA) in direct gap semiconductors due to intermediate state\nresonance enhancement for photons of very different energies. It can be\nexpected that further enhancement of nondegenerate 2PA will be observed in\nquantum wells (QWs) since the intraband matrix elements do not vanish near the\nband center as they do in the bulk, and the density of states in QWs is larger\nnear the band edge. Here we present a perturbation-theory based theoretical\ndescription of nondegenerate 2PA in semiconductor QWs, where both frequency and\npolarization of two incident waves can vary independently. Analytical\nexpressions for all possible permutations of frequencies and polarizations have\nbeen obtained, and the results are compared with degenerate 2PA in quantum\nwells along with degenerate and nondegenerate 2PA in bulk semiconductors. We\nshow that using QWs in place of bulk semiconductors with both beams in the\nTM-polarized mode leads to an additional order of magnitude increase in the\nnondegenerate 2PA. Explicit calculations for GaAs QWs are presented.\n", "  The hard-disk model plays a role of touchstone for testing and developing the\ntransport theory. By large scale molecular dynamics simulations of this model,\nthree important autocorrelation functions, and as a result the corresponding\ntransport coefficients, i.e., the diffusion constant, the thermal conductivity\nand the shear viscosity, are found to deviate significantly from the\npredictions of the conventional transport theory beyond the dilute limit. To\nimprove the theory, we consider both the kinetic process and the hydrodynamic\nprocess in the whole time range, rather than each process in a seperated time\nscale as the conventional transport theory does. With this consideration, a\nunified and coherent expression free of any fitting parameters is derived\nsuccesfully in the case of the velocity autocorrelation function, and its\nsuperiority to the conventional `piecewise' formula is shown. This expression\napplies to the whole time range and up to moderate densities, and thus bridges\nthe kinetics and hydrodynamics approaches in a self-consistent manner.\n", "  When a circularly-symmetric light beam with optical vortex (OV) diffracts at\nan opaque screen with the sharp edge, the OV core is displaced from the beam\naxis and, in case of the m-charged incident OV, decomposed into |m|\nsingle-charged ones. By means of numerical simulations and based on examples of\nincident beams with topological charges |m| =1, 2, 3 we show that, while the\nscreen edge monotonously advances towards the beam axis, the OVs in the\ndiffracted beam cross section move away from the incident beam axis along\nspiral-like trajectories. The trajectories contain fine structure details that\nreflect the nature and peculiar spatial configuration of the diffracting beam.\nFor the Kummer beams' diffraction, the trajectories contain self-crossings and\nregions of \"backward\" rotation (loops); in case of Laguerre-Gaussian beams, the\ntrajectories are smoother. The numerical results are supported by analytical\napproximations and conform with experiment The general shape of the\ntrajectories and their local behavior show high sensitivity to the diffraction\nconditions (spatial structure of the diffracting beam, its disposition with\nrespect to the screen edge, etc.), which can be used in diverse metrological\napplications.\n", "  We construct a family of self-similar solutions with fat tails to a quadratic\nkinetic equation. This equation describes the long time behaviour of weak\nsolutions with finite mass to the weak turbulence equation associated to the\nnonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation. The solutions that we construct have finite\nmass, but infinite energy. In J. Stat. Phys. 159:668-712, self-similar\nsolutions with finite mass and energy were constructed. Here we prove upper and\nlower exponential bounds on the tails of these solutions.\n", "  We present the TRIQS/DFTTools package, an application based on the TRIQS\nlibrary that connects this toolbox to realistic materials calculations based on\ndensity functional theory (DFT). In particular, TRIQS/DFTTools together with\nTRIQS allows an efficient implementation of DFT plus dynamical mean-field\ntheory (DMFT) calculations. It supplies tools and methods to construct Wannier\nfunctions and to perform the DMFT self-consistency cycle in this basis set.\nPost-processing tools, such as band-structure plotting or the calculation of\ntransport properties are also implemented. The package comes with a fully\ncharge self-consistent interface to the Wien2k band structure code, as well as\na generic interface that allows to use TRIQS/DFTTools together with a large\nvariety of DFT codes. It is distributed under the GNU General Public License\n(GPLv3).\n", "  The process of radio emission from extended air showers produced by high\nenergy cosmic rays has reached a good level of comprehension and prediction. It\nhas a coherent nature, so the emitted power scales quadratically with the\nenergy of the primary particle. Recently, a laboratory measurement has revealed\nthat an incoherent radiation mechanism exists, namely, the bremsstrahlung\nemission. In this paper we expound why bremsstrahlung radiation, that should be\npresent in showers produced by ultra high energy cosmic rays, has escaped\ndetection so far, and why, on the other side, it could be exploited, in the\n1--10~GHz frequency range, to detect astronomical $\\gamma$-rays. We propose an\nexperimental scheme to verify such hypothesis, which, if correct, would deeply\nimpact on the observational $\\gamma$-ray astronomy.\n", "  A search is reported for a light pseudoscalar Higgs boson decaying to a pair\nof tau leptons, produced in association with a b b-bar pair, in the context of\ntwo-Higgs-doublet models. The results are based on pp collision data at a\ncentre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC and\ncorresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 inverse femtobarns.\nPseudoscalar boson masses between 25 and 80 GeV are probed. No evidence for a\npseudoscalar boson is found and upper limits are set on the production cross\nsection times branching fraction to tau pairs between 7 and 39 pb at the 95%\nconfidence level. This excludes pseudoscalar A bosons with masses between 25\nand 80 GeV, with standard model-like Higgs boson negative couplings to\ndown-type fermions, produced in association with b b-bar pairs, in Type-II,\ntwo-Higgs-doublet models.\n", "  A new timing detector measuring ~50 MeV/c positrons is under development for\nthe MEG II experiment, aiming at a time resolution $\\sigma_t \\sim\n30~\\mathrm{ps}$. The resolution is expected to be achieved by measuring each\npositron time with multiple counters made of plastic scintillator readout by\nsilicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). The purpose of this work is to demonstrate\nthe time resolution for ~50 MeV/c positrons using prototype counters. Counters\nwith dimensions of $90\\times 40\\times 5~\\mathrm{mm}^3$ readout by six SiPMs\n(three on each $40\\times 5~\\mathrm{mm}^2$ plane) were built with SiPMs from\nHamamatsu Photonics and AdvanSiD and tested in a positron beam at the\nDA$\\Phi$NE Beam Test Facility. The time resolution was found to improve nearly\nas the square root of the number of counter hits. A time resolution\n$\\sigma_t=26.2\\pm1.3~\\mathrm{ps}$ was obtained with eight counters with\nHamamatsu SiPMs. These results suggest that the design resolution is achievable\nin the MEG II experiment.\n", "  To facilitate lattice QCD calculations of nucleon structute, a set of\nquasi-parton distributions were recently introduced. These quasi-PDFs were\nshown to reduce to standard PDFs when the nucleon is boosted to high energies,\n$P_z\\rightarrow \\infty$. Since taking such limit is not feasible in lattice\nsimulations, it is essential to provide guidance for what values of $P_z$ the\nquasi-PDFs are good approximations of standard PDFs. Within the framework of\nthe spectator diquark model, we evaluate both the up and down quarks'\nquasi-PDFs and standard PDFs for all leading-twist distributions (unpolarized\ndistribution $f_1$, helicity distribution $g_1$, and transversity distribution\n$h_1$). We find that, for intermediate parton momentum fractions $x$,\nquasi-PDFs are good approximations to standard PDFs (within $20-30\\%$) when\n$P_z\\gtrsim 1.5-2$ GeV. On the other hand, for large $x\\sim 1$ much larger $P_z\n> 4$ GeV is necessary to obtain a satisfactory agreement between the two sets.\nWe further find that the Soffer positivity bound does not hold in general for\nquasi-PDFs.\n", "  In this article, our prime objective is to study the inflationary paradigm\nfrom generalized tachyon (GTachyon) living on the world volume of a non-BPS\nstring theory. The tachyon action is considered here is getting modified\ncompared to the original action. One can quantify the amount of the\nmodification via a power $q$ instead of $1/2$ in the effective action. Using\nthis set up we study inflation from various types of tachyonic potentials,\nusing which we constrain the index $q$ within, $1/2<q<2$, Regge slope\n$\\alpha^{'}$, string coupling constant $g_{s}$ and mass scale of tachyon $M_s$,\nfrom the recent Planck 2015 and Planck+BICEP2/Keck Array joint data. We\nexplicitly study the inflationary consequences from single field, assisted\nfield and multi-field tachyon set up. Specifically for single field and\nassisted field case we derive the results in the quasi-de-Sitter background in\nwhich we will utilize the details of cosmological perturbations and quantum\nfluctuations. Also we derive the expressions for all inflationary observables\nusing any arbitrary vacuum and Bunch-Davies vacuum. For single field and\nassisted field case we derive-the inflationary flow equations, new sets of\nconsistency relations. Also we derive the field excursion formula for tachyon,\nwhich shows that assisted inflation is in more safer side compared to the\nsingle field case to validate effective field theory framework. Further we\nstudy the features of CMB Angular power spectrum from TT, TE and EE\ncorrelations from scalar fluctuations within the allowed range of $q$ for each\npotentials from single field set-up. We also put constraints from the\ntemperature anisotropy and polarization spectra, which shows that our analysis\nis consistent with the Planck 2015 data. Finally, using $\\delta N$ formalism we\nderive the expressions for inflationary observables in the context of\nmulti-field tachyons.\n", "  We consider the ABF background underlying the eta-deformed AdS5 x S5 sigma\nmodel. This background fails to satisfy the standard IIB supergravity equations\nwhich indicates that the corresponding sigma model is not Weyl invariant, i.e.\ndoes not define a critical string theory in the usual sense. We argue that the\nABF background should still correspond to UV finite theory on a flat 2d\nworld-sheet, implying that the eta-deformed model is scale invariant. This\nproperty follows from the formal relation via T-duality between the\neta-deformed model and the one defined by an exact type IIB supergravity\nsolution that has 6 isometries albeit broken by a linear dilaton. We find that\nthe ABF background satisfies candidate type IIB scale invariance conditions\nwhich for the R-R field strengths are of the second order in derivatives.\nSurprisingly, we also find that the this background obeys an interesting\nmodification of the standard IIB supergravity equations that are first order in\nderivatives of R-R fields. These modified equations explicitly depend on\nKilling vectors of the ABF background and, although not universal, imply the\nuniversal scale invariance conditions. Moreover, we show that it is precisely\nthe non-isometric dilaton of the T-dual solution that leads, after the\nT-duality, to a modification of type II equations from their standard form. We\nconjecture that the modified equations should follow from kappa-symmetry of the\neta-deformed model. All our observations apply also to eta-deformations of AdS3\nx S3 and AdS2 x S2 models.\n", "  The application of large magnetic fields ($B \\sim B_{c2}$) to layered\ncuprates suppresses their high temperature superconducting behaviour and\nreveals competing ground states. In the widely-studied material\nYBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$ (YBCO), underdoped ($p \\sim 1/8$) samples show\nsignatures of field-induced electronic and structural changes at low\ntemperatures. However, the microscopic nature of the field-induced\nreconstruction and the high-field state are unclear. Here we report an x-ray\nstudy of the high-field charge density wave (CDW) in YBCO, for doping, $0.1\n\\lesssim p \\lesssim 0.13$. For $p \\sim 0.123$, we find that a field ($B \\sim\n10$~T) induces new CDW correlations along the CuO chain ($b$) direction only,\nleading to a 3-D ordered state along this direction at $B \\sim 15$~T. The CDW\nsignal along the $a$-direction is also enhanced by field, but does not develop\na new pattern of correlations. We find that field modifies the coupling between\nthe CuO$_2$ bilayers in the YBCO structure, and causes the sudden appearance of\n3D CDW order. The mirror symmetry of individual bilayers is broken by the CDW\nat low and high fields, allowing recently suggested Fermi surface\nreconstruction.\n", "  In this paper we consider an interacting Bose gas at zero temperature,\nconstrained to a finite box and in the mean field limiting regime. The N gas\nparticles interact through a pair potential of positive type and with an\nultraviolet cut-off. The (nonzero) Fourier components of the potential are\nassumed to be sufficiently large with respect to the corresponding kinetic\nenergies of the modes like in the companion papers [Pi1]-[Pi2]. Using the\nmulti-scale technique in the occupation numbers of particle states introduced\nin [Pi1]-[Pi2], we provide a convergent expansion of the ground state of the\nHamiltonian in terms of the bare operators. In the limit N \\to \\infty the\nexpansion is up to any desired precision.\n", "  We study exclusive dijet production in coherent diffractive processes in deep\ninelastic scattering and real (and virtual) photon-hadron ($\\gamma^{(*)}$-h)\ncollisions in the Color Glass Condensate formalism at leading order. We show\nthat the diffractive dijet cross section is sensitive to the color-dipole\norientation in the transverse plane, and is a good probe of possible\ncorrelations between the $q\\bar{q}$-dipole transverse separation vector $\\r$\nand the dipole impact parameter $\\b$. We also investigate the diffractive dijet\nazimuthal angle correlations and $t$-distributions in $\\gamma^{(*)}$-h\ncollisions and show that they are sensitive to gluon saturation effects in the\nsmall-$x$ region. In particular, we show that the $t$-distribution of\ndiffractive dijet photo-production off a proton target exhibits a dip-type\nstructure in the saturation region. This effect is similar to diffractive\nvector meson production. Besides, at variance with the inclusive case, the\neffect of saturation leads to stronger azimuthal correlations between the jets.\n", "  We study the effective field theory of KKLT and LVS moduli stabilisation\nscenarios coupled to an anti-D3-brane at the tip of a warped throat. We\ndescribe the presence of the anti-brane in terms of a nilpotent goldstino\nsuperfield in a supersymmetric effective field theory. The introduction of this\nsuperfield produces a term that can lead to a de Sitter minimum. We fix the\nKaehler moduli dependence of the nilpotent field couplings by matching this\nterm with the anti-D3-brane uplifting contribution. The main result of this\npaper is the computation, within this EFT, of the soft supersymmetry breaking\nterms in both KKLT and LVS for matter living on D3-brane (leaving the D7-brane\nanalysis to an appendix). A handful of distinct phenomenological scenarios\nemerge that could have low energy implications, most of them having a split\nspectrum of soft masses. Some cosmological and phenomenological properties of\nthese models are discussed. We also check that the attraction between the\nD3-brane and the anti-D3-brane does not affect the leading contribution to the\nsoft masses and does not destabilise the system.\n", "  We use a combination of the coherent potential approximation and dynamical\nmean field theory to study magnetic properties of the Fe$_{1-x}$Ni$_x$ alloy\nfrom a first principles. Calculated uniform magnetic susceptibilities have a\nCurie-Weiss-like behavior and extracted effective temperatures are in agreement\nwith the experimental results. The individual squared magnetic moments obtained\nas function of nickel concentration follow the same trends as experimental\ndata. An analysis of the ionic and spin weights shows a possibility of a\nhigh-spin to intermediate- and low-spin states transitions at high\ntemperatures.\n", "  Dark matter can scatter and excite a nucleus to a low-lying excitation in a\ndirect detection experiment. This signature is distinct from the canonical\nelastic scattering signal because the inelastic signal also contains the energy\ndeposited from the subsequent prompt de-excitation of the nucleus. A\nmeasurement of the elastic and inelastic signal will allow a single experiment\nto distinguish between a spin-independent and spin-dependent interaction. For\nthe first time, we characterise the inelastic signal for two-phase xenon\ndetectors in which dark matter inelastically scatters off the Xe-129 or Xe-131\nisotope. We do this by implementing a realistic simulation of a typical\ntonne-scale two-phase xenon detector and by carefully estimating the relevant\nbackground signals. With our detector simulation, we explore whether the\ninelastic signal from the axial-vector interaction is detectable with upcoming\ntonne-scale detectors. We find that two-phase detectors allow for some\ndiscrimination between signal and background so that it is possible to detect\ndark matter that inelastically scatters off either the Xe-129 or Xe-131 isotope\nfor dark matter particles that are heavier than approximately 100 GeV. If,\nafter two years of data, the XENON1T search for elastic scattering nuclei finds\nno evidence for dark matter, the possibility of ever detecting an inelastic\nsignal from the axial-vector interaction will be almost entirely excluded.\n", "  The phenomenon of quantum erasure has long intrigued physicists, but has\nsurprisingly found limited practical application. Here, we propose an\nerasure-based protocol for quantum key distribution (QKD) that promises\ninherent security against detector attacks.\n", "  We show a nearly quadratic separation between deterministic communication\ncomplexity and the logarithm of the partition number, which is essentially\noptimal. This improves upon a recent power 1.5 separation of G\\\"o\\\"os, Pitassi,\nand Watson (FOCS 2015). In query complexity, we establish a nearly quadratic\nseparation between deterministic (and even randomized) query complexity and\nsubcube partition complexity, which is also essentially optimal. We also\nestablish a nearly power 1.5 separation between quantum query complexity and\nsubcube partition complexity, the first superlinear separation between the two\nmeasures. Lastly, we show a quadratic separation between quantum query\ncomplexity and one-sided subcube partition complexity.\n  Our query complexity separations use the recent cheat sheet framework of\nAaronson, Ben-David, and the author. Our query functions are built up in stages\nby alternating function composition with the cheat sheet construction. The\ncommunication complexity separation follows from lifting the query separation\nto communication complexity.\n", "  The changes in characteristics of Bose condensation of ideal Bose gas due to\nan external generic power law potential $U=\\sum_{i=1} ^d c_i\n|\\frac{x_i}{a_i}|^{n_i}$ are studied carefully. Detailed calculation of Kim\n$et$ $al.$ (S. H. Kim, C. K. Kim and K. Nahm, J Phys. Condens. Matter 11 10269\n(1999).) yielded the hierarchy of condensation transitions with changing\nfractional dimensionality. In this manuscript, some theorems regarding specific\nheat at constant volume $C_V$ are presented. Careful examination of these\ntheorems reveal the existence of hidden hierarchy of the condensation\ntransition in trapped systems as well.\n", "  Excess GeV gamma rays from the Galactic Center (GC) have been measured with\nthe Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). The presence of the GC excess (GCE)\nappears to be robust with respect to changes in the diffuse galactic background\nmodeling. The three main proposals for the GCE are an unresolved population of\nmillisecond pulsars (MSPs), outbursts of cosmic rays from the GC region, and\nself-annihilating dark matter (DM). The injection of secondary electrons and\npositrons into the interstellar medium (ISM) by an unresolved population of\nMSPs or DM annihilations can lead to observable gamma-ray emission via inverse\nCompton scattering or bremsstrahlung. Here we investigate how to determine\nwhether secondaries are important in a model for the GCE. We develop a method\nof testing model fit which accounts for the different spatial morphologies of\nthe secondary emission. We examine several models which give secondary emission\nand illustrate a case where a broadband analysis is not sufficient to determine\nthe need for secondary emission.\n", "  We have carried out a Monte Carlo simulation of a modified version of Vicsek\nmodel for the motion of self-propelled particles in two dimensions. In this\nmodel the neighborhood of interaction of a particle is a sector of the circle\nwith the particle at the center (rather than the whole circle as in the\noriginal Vicsek model). The sector is centered along the direction of the\nvelocity of the particle, and the half-opening angle of this sector is called\nthe `view-angle'. We vary the view-angle over its entire range and study the\nchange in the nature of the collective motion of the particles. We find that\nordered collective motion persists down to remarkably small view-angles. And at\na certain critical view-angle the collective motion of the system undergoes a\nfirst order phase transition to a disordered state. We also find that the\nreduction in the view-angle can in fact increase the order in the system\nsignificantly. We show that the directionality of the interaction, and not only\nthe radial range of the interaction, plays an important role in the\ndetermination of the nature of the above phase transition.\n", "  Today many compact and efficient on-water data acquisition units help the\nmodern coaching by measuring and analyzing various inertial signals during\nkayaking. One of the most challenging problems is how these signals can be used\nto estimate performance and to develop the technique. Recently we have\nintroduced indicators based on the fluctuations of the inertial signals as\npromising additions to the existing parameters. In this work we report about\nour more detailed analysis, compare new indicators and discuss the possible\nadvantages of the applied methods. Our primary aim is to draw the attention to\nseveral exciting and inspiring open problems and to initiate further research\neven in several related multidisciplinary fields. More detailed information can\nbe found on a dedicated web page, http://www.noise.inf.u-szeged.hu/kayak.\n", "  An alternative definition for the order-parameter is proposed, for a family\nof non-equilibrium spin models with up-down symmetry on honeycomb lattices, and\nwhich depends on two parameters. In contrast to the usual definition, our\nproposal takes into account that each site of the lattice can be associated\nwith a local temperature which depends on the local environment of each site.\nUsing the generalised voter motel as a test case, we analyse the phase diagram\nand the critical exponents in the stationary state and compare the results of\nthe standard order-parameter with the ones following from our new proposal, on\nthe honeycomb lattice. The stationary phase transition is in the Ising\nuniversality class. Finite-size corrections are also studied and the Wegner\nexponent is estimated as $\\omega=1.06(9)$.\n", "  In this work we deal with nontopological solutions of the Q-ball type in two\nspacetime dimensions. We study models of current interest, described by a\nHiggs-like and other, similar potentials which unveil the presence of exact\nsolutions. We use the analytic results to investigate how to control the energy\nand charge to make the Q-balls stable.\n", "  We discuss how the intensity and the energy frontiers provide complementary\nconstraints within a minimal model of neutrino mass involving just one new\nfield beyond the Standard Model at accessible energy, namely a doubly charged\nscalar $S^{++}$ and its antiparticle $S^{--}$. In particular we focus on the\ncomplementarity between high-energy LHC searches and low-energy probes such as\nlepton flavor violation. Our setting is a prime example of how high- and\nlow-energy physics can cross-fertilize each other.\n", "  We consider an extension of Higgs inflation in which the Higgs field is\ncoupled to the Gauss-Bonnet term. Working solely in the Jordan frame, we\nfirstly recover the standard predictions of Higgs inflation without a\nGauss-Bonnet term. We then calculate the power spectra for scalar and tensor\nperturbations in the presence of a coupling to a Gauss-Bonnet term. We show\nthat generically the predictions of Higgs inflation are robust and the\ncontributions to the power spectra coming from the Gauss-Bonnet term are\nnegligible. We find, however, that the end of inflation can be strongly\nmodified and that we hence expect the details of (p)reheating to be\nsignificantly altered, leading to some concerns over the feasibility of the\nmodel which require further investigations.\n", "  The present paper intends to present an extension of the constrained-path\nquantum Monte-Carlo approach allowing to reconstruct non-yrast states in order\nto reach the complete spectroscopy of nuclei within the interacting shell\nmodel. As in the yrast case studied in a previous work, the formalism involves\na variational symmetry-restored wave function assuming two central roles.\nFirst, it guides the underlying Brownian motion to improve the efficiency of\nthe sampling. Second, it constrains the stochastic paths according to the\nphaseless approximation to control sign or phase problems that usually plague\nfermionic QMC simulations. Proof-of-principle results in the $sd$ valence space\nare reported. They prove the ability of the scheme to offer remarkably accurate\nbinding energies for both even- and odd-mass nuclei irrespective of the\nconsidered interaction.\n", "  We present an extended version of a recently proposed semi-holographic model\nfor heavy-ion collisions, which includes self-consistent couplings between the\nYang-Mills fields of the Color Glass Condensate framework and an infrared\nAdS/CFT sector, such as to guarantee the existence of a conserved\nenergy-momentum tensor for the combined system that is local in space and time,\nwhich we also construct explicitly. Moreover, we include a coupling of the\ntopological charge density in the glasma to the same of the holographic\ninfrared CFT. The semi-holographic approach makes it possible to combine CGC\ninitial conditions and weak-coupling glasma field equations with a simultaneous\nevolution of a strongly coupled infrared sector describing the soft gluons\nradiated by hard partons. As a first numerical test of the semi-holographic\nmodel we study the dynamics of fluctuating homogeneous color-spin-locked\nYang-Mills fields when coupled to a homogeneous and isotropic energy-momentum\ntensor of the holographic IR-CFT, and we find rapid convergence of the\niterative numerical procedure suggested earlier.\n", "  We propose an supersymmetric explanation of the diphoton excess in the\nMinimal Supersymmetric Standard Model with the leptonic R-parity violation.\nWhere the sneutrino serves as the 750 GeV resonance and produced through quark\nanti-quark annihilation. With introducing appropriate trilinear soft\nparameters, we show that the diphoton branching ratio is significantly enhanced\ncompared with the conventional MSSM. The parameter space favored by diphoton\nexcess strongly indicates the mass of smuon and stau fall into the range\n$375-410$ (375-480) GeV, which depending on the electroweakino masses. In\naddition, the $R$-parity-violating trilinear couplings involved with second\ngeneration quarks are both favored by compatibility of diphoton excess and\nlow-energy constraints.\n", "  In this work we compare two fundamentally different approaches to the\nelectronic transport in deformed graphene: a) the condensed matter approach in\nwhich current flow paths are obtained by applying the non-equilibrium Green's\nfunction (NEGF) method to the tight-binding model with local strain, b) the\ngeneral relativistic approach in which classical trajectories of relativistic\npoint particles moving in a curved surface with a pseudo-magnetic field are\ncalculated. The connection between the two is established in the long-wave\nlimit via an effective Dirac Hamiltonian in curved space. Geometrical optics\napproximation, applied to focused current beams, allows us to directly compare\nthe wave and the particle pictures. We obtain very good numerical agreement\nbetween the quantum and the classical approaches for a fairly wide set of\nparameters, improving with the increasing size of the system. The presented\nmethod offers an enormous reduction of complexity from irregular tight-binding\nHamiltonians defined on large lattices to geometric language for curved\ncontinuous surfaces. It facilitates a comfortable and efficient tool for\npredicting electronic transport properties in graphene nanostructures with\ncomplicated geometries. Combination of the curvature and the pseudo-magnetic\nfield paves the way to new interesting transport phenomena such as bending or\nfocusing (lensing) of currents depending on the shape of the deformation. It\ncan be applied in designing ultrasensitive sensors or in nanoelectronics.\n", "  The jet fragmentation function describes the longitudinal momentum\ndistribution of hadrons inside a reconstructed jet. We study the jet\nfragmentation function in proton-proton collisions in the framework of\nsoft-collinear effective theory (SCET). We find that, up to power corrections,\nthe jet fragmentation function can be expressed as the ratio of the fragmenting\njet function and the unmeasured jet function. Using renormalization group\ntechniques, we are able to resum large logarithms of jet radii R in the\nperturbative expansion of the cross section. We use our theoretical formalism\nto describe the jet fragmentation functions for light hadron and heavy meson\nproduction measured at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Our calculations agree\nvery well with the experimental data for the light hadron production. On the\nother hand, although our calculations for the heavy meson production inside\njets are consistent with the PYTHIA simulation, they fail to describe the LHC\ndata. We find that the jet fragmentation function for heavy meson production is\nvery sensitive to the gluon-to-heavy-meson fragmentation function.\n", "  Measurements of the Hall and dissipative conductivity of a strained Ge\nquantum well on a SiGe/(001)Si substrate in the quantum Hall regime are\nreported. We find quantum Hall states in the Composite Fermion family and a\nprecursor signal at filling fraction $\\nu=5/2$. We analyse the results in terms\nof thermally activated quantum tunneling of carriers from one internal edge\nstate to another across saddle points in the long range impurity potential.\nThis shows that the gaps for different filling fractions closely follow the\ndependence predicted by theory. We also find that the estimates of the\nseparation of the edge states at the saddle are in line with the expectations\nof an electrostatic model in the lowest spin-polarised Landau level (LL), but\nnot in the spin-reversed LL where the density of quasiparticle states is not\nhigh enough to accommodate the carriers required.\n", "  The LHC collaborations ATLAS and CMS recently reported on the excess of the\nevents in the diphoton final states at the invariant mass of about $750~\n\\text{GeV}$. In this article we speculate on the possibility that the excess\narises from the neutral CP-even component $\\phi$ of the scalar triplet $ \\Phi $\nof the $SU(3)_{c}\\times SU(3)_{L}\\times U(1)_{X}$ $(3\\text{-}3\\text{-} 1)$\nmodel that has a $U(1)_{X}$ charge equal to $X=-1/3$ and acquires a vacuum\nexpectation value larger than the electroweak symmetry breaking scale. The\ninteractions of the scalar field $\\phi$ to the photon- and gluon-pairs are\nmediated by the virtual vector-like fermions which appear as components of the\nanomaly-free chiral fermion representations of the $3\\text{ -}3\\text{-}1$ gauge\ngroup.\n", "  In order to extract correlation information inherited in stochastic time\nseries, the visibility graph algorithm has been recently proposed, by which a\ntime series can be mapped onto a complex network. We demonstrate that the\nvisibility algorithm is not an appropriate one to study the correlation aspects\nof a time series. We then employ the horizontal visibility algorithm, as a much\nsimpler one, to map fractional processes onto complex networks. The degree\ndistributions are shown to have parabolic exponential forms with Hurst\ndependent fitting parameter. Further, we take into account other topological\nproperties such as maximum eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix and the degree\nassortativity, and show that such topological quantities can also be used to\npredict the Hurst exponent, with an exception for anti-persistent fractional\nGaussian noises. To solve this problem, we take into account the Spearman\ncorrelation coefficient between nodes' degrees and their corresponding data\nvalues in the original time series.\n", "  Use of the extended definition of heat dQ=deQ+diQ converts the Clausius\ninequality dS greater than or equal to deQ/T0 into an equality dS=dQ/T\ninvolving the nonequilibrium temperature T of the system having the\nconventional interpretation that heat flows from hot to cold. The equality is\napplied to the exact quantum evolution of a 1-dimensional ideal gas free\nexpansion. In a first ever calculation of its kind in an expansion which\nretains the memory of initial state, we determine the nonequilibrium\ntemperature T and pressure P, which are then compared with the ratio P/T\nobtained by an independent method to show the consistency of the nonequilibrium\nformulation. We find that the quantum evolution by itself cannot eliminate the\nmemory effect.cannot eliminate the memory effect; hence, it cannot thermalize\nthe system.\n", "  We present a measurement of the correlation between the spins of t and tbar\nquarks produced in proton-antiproton collisions at the Tevatron Collider at a\ncenter-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV. We apply a matrix element technique to\ndilepton and single-lepton+jets final states in data accumulated with the D0\ndetector that correspond to an integrated luminosity of 9.7 fb$^{-1}$. The\nmeasured value of the correlation coefficient in the off-diagonal basis,\n$O_{off} = 0.89 \\pm 0.22$ (stat + syst), is in agreement with the standard\nmodel prediction, and represents evidence for a top-antitop quark spin\ncorrelation difference from zero at a level of 4.2 standard deviations.\n", "  We consider fluid/gravity correspondence in a general rotating black hole\nbackground with scalar and electromagnetic fields. Using the method of\nPetrov-like boundary condition, we show that the scalar and the electromagnetic\nfields contribute external forces to the dual Navier-Stokes equation and the\nrotation of black hole induces the Coriolis force.\n", "  We consider a lattice action which forbids large fields, and which remains\ninvariant under smooth deformations of the field. Such a \"topological\" action\ndepends on one parameter, the field cutoff, but does not have a classical\ncontinuum limit as this cutoff approaches zero. We study the properties of such\nan action in 4d compact U(1) lattice gauge theory, and compare them with those\nof the Wilson action. In both cases, we find a weakly first-order transition\nseparating a confining phase where monopoles condense, and a Coulomb phase\nwhere monopoles are exponentially suppressed. We also find a different,\ncritical value of the field cutoff where monopoles completely disappear.\nFinally, we show that a topological action simplifies the measurement of the\nfree energy.\n", "  The propagation of surface plasmon polaritons in thin films of topological\ninsulators is studied. The materials considered are second generation three\ndimensional topological insulators Bi$_2$Se$_3$, Bi$_2$Te$_3$, and\nSb$_2$Te$_3$. Dispersion relations and propagation lengths are estimated\nnumerically, taking into account the variation of bulk dielectric functions of\ntopological insulators as well as substrate using the Drude-Lorentz model. Key\nfactors affecting propagation length are identified and ways to modify the\ndispersion relations are suggested. The explanation of the apparent discrepancy\nbetween the experimental data for Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and theory is proposed.\n", "  We consider $q$-Painlev\\'e equations arising from birational representations\nof the extended affine Weyl groups of $A_4^{(1)}$- and $(A_1+A_1)^{(1)}$-types.\nWe study their hypergeometric solutions on the level of $\\tau$ functions.\n", "  The ATLAS collaboration reported a 3sigma excess in the search of events\ncontaining on-Z dilepton, jets, and large missing momentum (MET) in the 8 TeV\nLHC run. Motivated by this excess, many models of new physics have been\nproposed. Recently, the ATLAS and CMS collaborations reported new results for\nsimilar Z+MET channels in the 13 TeV run. In this paper, we comprehensively\ndiscuss the consistency between the proposed models and the LHC results of Run\n1 and Run 2. We find that in models with heavy gluino production, there is\ngenerically some tension between the 8 TeV and 13 TeV results. On the other\nhand, models with light squark production provide relatively better fitting to\nboth results.\n", "  Currently known topological insulators (TIs) are limited to narrow gap\ncompounds incorporating heavy elements, thus severely limiting the material\npool available for such applications. We show via first-principle calculations\nhow a heterovalent superlattice made of common semiconductor building blocks\ncan transform its non-TI components into a topological nanostructure,\nillustrated by III-V/II-VI superlattice InSb/CdTe. The heterovalent nature of\nsuch interfaces sets up, in the absence of interfacial atomic exchange, a\nnatural internal electric field that along with the quantum confinement leads\nto band inversion, transforming these semiconductors into a topological phase\nwhile also forming a giant Rashba spin splitting. We reveal the relationship\nbetween the interfacial stability and the topological transition, finding a\nwindow of opportunity where both conditions can be optimized. Once a critical\nInSb layer thickness above ~ 1.5 nm is reached, both [111] and [100]\nsuperlattices have a relative energy of 5-14 meV/A2 higher than that of the\natomically exchanged interface and an excitation gap up to ~150 meV, affording\nroom-temperature quantum spin Hall effect in semiconductor superlattices. The\nunderstanding gained from this study could significantly broaden the current,\nrather restricted repertoire of functionalities available from individual\ncompounds by creating next-generation super-structured functional materials.\n", "  It is shown that an account for the space separatedness of the two-orbital\nsubsystem of the oxygen holes and the subsystem of the localized spins of\ncopper ions in high-T$_c$ cuprate superconductors leads to the stability of the\nsuperconducting $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing towards the strong Coulomb repulsion\nbetween holes located at the nearest oxygen ions. This effect is due to the\nfact that the Coulomb potential slips out of the equation for the Cooper\npairing in the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave channel owing to the properties of symmetry.\n", "  We consider the integrable one-dimensional spin-$1$ chain defined by the\nZamolodchikov-Fateev (ZF) Hamiltonian. The latter is parametrized, analogously\nto the XXZ spin-$1/2$ model, by a continuous anisotropy parameter and at the\nisotropic point coincides with the well-known spin-$1$ Babujian-Takhtajan\nHamiltonian. Following a procedure recently developed for the XXZ model, we\nexplicitly construct a continuous family of quasi-local conserved operators for\nthe periodic spin-$1$ ZF chain. Our construction is valid for a dense set of\ncommensurate values of the anisotropy parameter in the gapless regime where the\nisotropic point is excluded. Using the Mazur inequality, we show that, as for\nthe XXZ model, these quasi-local charges are enough to prove that the\nhigh-temperature spin Drude weight is non-vanishing in the thermodynamic limit,\nthus establishing ballistic spin transport at high temperature.\n", "  In this paper, we calculate the entanglement negativity in free-fermion\nsystems by use of the overlap matrices. For a tripartite system, if the ground\nstate can be factored into triples of modes, we show that the partially\ntransposed reduced density matrix can be factorized and the entanglement\nnegativity has a simple form. However, the factorability of the ground state in\na tripartite system does not hold in general. In this situation, the partially\ntransposed reduced density matrix can be expressed in terms of the Kronecker\nproduct of matrices. We explicitly compute the entanglement negativity for the\nSu-Schrieffer-Heeger model, the integer Quantum Hall state, and a homogeneous\none-dimensional chain. We find that the entanglement negativity for the integer\nquantum Hall states shows an area law behavior. For the entanglement negativity\nof two adjacent intervals in a homogeneous one-dimensional gas, we find\nagreement with the conformal field theory. Our method provides a numerically\nfeasible way to study the entanglement negativity in free-fermion systems.\n", "  In dense neutrino backgrounds present in supernovae and in the early Universe\nneutrino oscillations may exhibit complex collective phenomena, such as\nsynchronized oscillations, bipolar oscillations and spectral splits and swaps.\nWe consider in detail possible decoherence effects on the simplest of these\nphenomena -- synchronized neutrino oscillations that can occur in a uniform and\nisotropic neutrino gas. We develop an exact formalism of spectral moments of\nthe flavour spin vectors describing such a system and then apply it to find\nanalytical approaches that allow one to study decoherence effects on its\nlate-time evolution. This turns out to be possible in part due to the existence\nof the (previously unknown) exact conservation law satisfied by the quantities\ndescribing the considered neutrino system. Interpretation of the decoherence\neffects in terms of neutrino wave packet separation is also given, both in the\nadiabatic and non-adiabatic regimes of neutrino flavour evolution.\n", "  Direct reciprocity is a mechanism for the evolution of cooperation based on\nrepeated interactions. When individuals meet repeatedly, they can use\nconditional strategies to enforce cooperative outcomes that would not be\nfeasible in one-shot social dilemmas. Direct reciprocity requires that\nindividuals keep track of their past interactions and find the right response.\nHowever, there are natural bounds on strategic complexity: Humans find it\ndifficult to remember past interactions accurately, especially over long\ntimespans. Given these limitations, it is natural to ask how complex strategies\nneed to be for cooperation to evolve. Here, we study stochastic evolutionary\ngame dynamics in finite populations to systematically compare the evolutionary\nperformance of reactive strategies, which only respond to the co-player's\nprevious move, and memory-one strategies, which take into account the own and\nthe co-player's previous move. In both cases, we compare deterministic strategy\nand stochastic strategy spaces. For reactive strategies and small costs, we\nfind that stochasticity benefits cooperation, because it allows for\ngenerous-tit-for-tat. For memory one strategies and small costs, we find that\nstochasticity does not increase the propensity for cooperation, because the\ndeterministic rule of win-stay, lose-shift works best. For memory one\nstrategies and large costs, however, stochasticity can augment cooperation.\n", "  We consider strongly stratified forced turbulence in a plane-parallel layer\nwith helicity and corresponding large-scale dynamo action in the lower part and\nnon-helical turbulence in the upper. The magnetic field is found to develop\nstrongly concentrated bipolar structures near the surface. They form elongated\nbands with a sharp interface between opposite polarities. Unlike earlier\nexperiments with imposed magnetic field, the inclusion of rotation does not\nstrongly suppress the formation of these structures. We perform a systematic\nnumerical study of this phenomenon by varying magnetic Reynolds number, scale\nseparation ratio, and Coriolis number. We focus on the formation of a current\nsheet between bipolar regions where reconnection of oppositely oriented field\nlines occurs. We determine the reconnection rate by measuring either the inflow\nvelocity in the vicinity of the current sheet or by measuring the electric\nfield in the reconnection region. We demonstrate that for large Lundquist\nnumbers, S>10^3, the reconnection rate is nearly independent of S in agreement\nwith results of recent numerical simulations performed by other groups in\nsimpler settings.\n", "  Helical hypermagnetic fields in the primordial Universe can produce the\nobserved amount of baryon asymmetry through the chiral anomaly without any\ningredients beyond the standard model of particle physics. While they generate\nno $B-L$ asymmetry, the generated baryon asymmetry survives the spharelon\nwashout effect, because the generating process remains active until the\nelectroweak phase transition. Solving the Boltzmann equation numerically and\nfinding an attractor solution, we show that the baryon asymmetry of our\nUniverse can be explained, if the present large-scale magnetic fields indicated\nby the blazar observations have a negative helicity and existed in the early\nUniverse before the electroweak phase transition. We also derive the upper\nbound on the strength of the helical magnetic field, which is tighter than the\ncosmic microwave background constraint, to avoid the overproduction of baryon\nasymmetry.\n", "  Here we demonstrate the Shubnikov de Haas oscillation in high-quality Cd3As2\nnanowires grown by a chemical vapor deposition approach. The dominant transport\nof topological Dirac fermions is evident by the nontrivial Berry phase in the\nLandau Fan diagram. The quantum oscillations rise at a small field of 2 Tesla\nand preserves till up to 100K, revealing a sizeable Landau level gap and a\nmobility of over 2000 cm2/V-1s-1. The angle-variable oscillations indicates the\nisotropy of the bulk Dirac transport. The large estimated mean free path\nappeals the one-dimensional transport of Dirac semimetals.\n", "  Shift and stretch invariance lead to the exponential-Boltzmann probability\ndistribution. Rotational invariance generates the Gaussian distribution.\nParticular scaling relations transform the canonical exponential and Gaussian\npatterns into the variety of commonly observed patterns. The scaling relations\nthemselves arise from the fundamental invariances of shift, stretch, and\nrotation, plus a few additional invariances. Prior work described the three\nfundamental invariances as a consequence of the equilibrium canonical ensemble\nof statistical mechanics or the Jaynesian maximization of information entropy.\nBy contrast, I emphasize the primacy and sufficiency of invariance alone to\nexplain the commonly observed patterns. Primary invariance naturally creates\nthe array of commonly observed scaling relations and associated probability\npatterns, whereas the classical approaches derived from statistical mechanics\nor information theory require special assumptions to derive commonly observed\nscales.\n", "  Accurate simulation of the non-adiabatic dynamics of molecules in excited\nelectronic states is key to understanding molecular photo-physical processes.\nHere we present a novel method, based on a semiclassical approximation, that is\nas efficient as the commonly used mean field Ehrenfest or ad hoc Surface\nHopping methods and properly accounts for interference and decoherence effects.\nThis novel method is an extension of Hellers Thawed Gaussian wavepacket\ndynamics that includes coupling between potential energy surfaces. The accuracy\nof the method can be systematically improved.\n", "  We report the successful production of an ultracold sample of absolute\nground-state $^{23}$Na$^{87}$Rb molecules. Starting from weakly-bound Feshbach\nmolecules formed via magneto-association, the lowest rovibrational and\nhyperfine level of the electronic ground state is populated following a high\nefficiency and high resolution two-photon Raman process. The high purity\nabsolute ground-state samples have up to 8000 molecules and densities of over\n$10^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$. By measuring the Stark shifts induced by external electric\nfields, we determined the permanent electric dipole moment of the absolute\nground-state $^{23}$Na$^{87}$Rb and demonstrated the capability of inducing an\neffective dipole moment over one Debye. Bimolecular reaction between\nground-state $^{23}$Na$^{87}$Rb molecules is endothermic, but we still observed\na rather fast decay of the molecular sample. Our results pave the way toward\ninvestigation of ultracold molecular collisions in a fully controlled manner,\nand possibly to quantum gases of ultracold bosonic molecules with strong\ndipolar interactions.\n", "  The interplay between the singlet ground state of the antiferromagnetic\nHeisenberg model and the experimentally measured N\\'eel state of\nantiferromagnets is studied. To verify the hypothesis [M. I. Katsnelson et al.,\nPhys. Rev. B 63, 212404 (2001)] that the latter can be considered to be a\nresult of local measurements destroying the entanglement of the quantum ground\nstate, we have performed systematic simulations of the effects of von\nNeumannmeasurements for the case of a one-dimensional antiferromagnetic\nspin-1/2 system for various types and degrees of magnetic anisotropies. It is\nfound that in the ground state, a magnetization measurement can create\ndecoherence waves [M. I. Katsnelson et al. Phys. Rev. A 62, 022118 (2000)] in\nthe magnetic sublattices, and that a symmetry breaking anisotropy does not lead\nto alignment of the spins in a particular direction. However, for an easy-axis\nanisotropy of the same order magnitude as the exchange constant, a measurement\non the singlet ground state can create N\\'eel-ordering in finite systems of\nexperimentally accessible size.\n", "  The group of Conservative transformations is an enlargement of the group of\ndiffeomorphisms which leads to a richer geometry than that of general\nrelativity. The field variables of the theory are the usual orthonormal tetrads\nand also internal space tetrads. Using the fundamental geometric object which\nis the curvature vector, an appropriate Lagrangian has been defined for both\nfree-field and fields with sources. Solutions to the corresponding field\nequations have been developed. In this paper we use the static spherically\nsymmetric tetrad field with sources to model the universe. Our fundamental\nassumption is that the total density comprised of both ordinary and dark matter\nshould be constant. The resulting model with one adjustable parameter predicts\nthat ordinary matter is approximately 77\\% of the total mass content, but this\npercentage is near 0\\% for regions near the center of the universe. The space\nis approximately isotropic for $r$ near zero. The radial and tangential\npressures are negative and unequal. The redshift is also modeled without the\nexpanding universe and an explanation of the value of the cosmological constant\nis given. Equations governing particle motion are also derived which can\nproduce a repulsive effect and produce even larger redshifts. Finally, the\ncosmic microwave background and its anisotropies are addressed and heuristic\narguments are given that suggest that our theory is not inconsistent with these\nobservations. These results add further confirmation that the theory developed\nby Pandres is the fundamental theory of physics.\n", "  We have calculated the composite (pseudo) scalar contributions to the\nanomalous magnetic moment of muons in models of walking technicolor. By the\naxial or scale anomaly the light scalars such as techni-dilaton, techni-pions\nor techni-eta have anomalous couplings to two-photons, which make them natural\ncandidates for the recent 750 GeV resonance excess, observed at LHC. Due to the\nanomalous couplings, their contributions to muon (g-2) are less suppressed and\nmight explain the current deviation in muon (g-2) measurements from theory.\n", "  This paper discusses the empirical evidence of Tsallis statistical functions\nin the personal income distribution of Brazil. Yearly samples from 1978 to 2014\nwere linearized by the q-logarithm and straight lines were fitted to the entire\nrange of the income data in all samples, producing a two-parameters-only single\nfunction representation of the whole distribution in every year. The results\nshowed that the time evolution of the parameters is periodic and plotting one\nin terms of the other reveals a cycle mostly clockwise. It was also found that\nthe empirical data oscillate periodically around the fitted straight lines with\nthe amplitude growing as the income values increase. Since the entire income\ndata range can be fitted by a single function, this raises questions on\nprevious results claiming that the income distribution is constituted by a well\ndefined two-classes-base income structure, since such a division in two very\ndistinct income classes might not be an intrinsic property of societies, but a\nconsequence of an a priori fitting-choice procedure that may leave aside\npossibly important income dynamics at the intermediate levels.\n", "  The current accelerated expansion of the universe has been one of the most\nimportant fields in physics and astronomy since 1998. Many cosmological models\nhave been proposed in the literature to explain this mysterious phenomenon.\nSince the nature and cause of the cosmic acceleration are still unknown,\nmodel-independent approaches to study the evolution of the universe are\nwelcome. One of the powerful model-independent approaches is the so-called\ncosmography. It only relies on the cosmological principle, without postulating\nany underlying theoretical model. However, there are several shortcomings in\nthe usual cosmography. For instance, it is plagued with the problem of\ndivergence (or an unacceptably large error), and it fails to predict the future\nevolution of the universe. In the present work, we try to overcome or at least\nalleviate these problems, and we propose two new generalizations of cosmography\ninspired by the Pad\\'e approximant. One is to directly parameterize the\nluminosity distance based on the Pad\\'e approximant, while the other is to\ngeneralize cosmography with respect to a so-called $y_\\beta$-shift\n$y_\\beta=z/(1+\\beta z)$, which is also inspired by the Pad\\'e approximant.\nThen, we confront them with the observational data with the help of the Markov\nchain Monte Carlo (MCMC) code emcee, and find that they work fairly well.\n", "  We extend the use of holography to investigate the scrambling properties of\nvarious physical systems. Specifically, we consider: (i) non-conformal\nbackgrounds of black $Dp$ branes, (ii) asymptotically Lifshitz black holes, and\n(iii) black $AdS$ solutions of Gauss-Bonnet gravity. We use the disruption of\nthe entanglement entropy as a probe of the chaotic features of such systems.\nOur analysis shows that these theories share the same type of behavior as\nconformal theories as they undergo chaos; however, in the case of Gauss-Bonnet\ngravity, we find a stark difference in the evolution of the mutual information\nfor negative Gauss-Bonnet coupling. This may signal an inconsistency of the\nlatter.\n", "  Attention is drawn to the mathematical equality of rights of symmetrical\nconstituents derived affinor of a vector field in relation to its antisymmetric\nconstituents. In this regard, raises the question not only of equitable\naccounting, but and mainly question of the real existence of fields,\nrepresented by these constituents. In particular, we conclude that the\nclassical electromagnetic field at any point of space-time accompanied, in the\nGeneral case, independent physical field, defined symmetrical derived affinor\nof 4-potential of classical electrodynamics. Discussed, within the framework of\nthe Bogolyubov and Shirkov axiomatic, a theory of real vector field, clearly\nand equitably taking into account the symmetric derived affinors this field and\nfound a number of important distinguishing features this model. Despite\naccounting explicitly gauge-noninvariant constituents, the proposed theory has\nspecialized gauge invariance, which provides, in particular, conservation of\nelectric current. In this connection, the difficulties with the probabilistic\ninterpretation, in the case of indefinite-metric version of the theory, are\nsurmountable by standard methods. Finally, is proposed the physical content of\nthe fields, defined of a symmetrical derived affinor of 4-potential of\nclassical electrodynamics.\n  Keywords: vector field, symmetrical derived affinor, gauge invariance.\n", "  Suspended graphene sheets exhibit correlated random deformations that can be\nstudied under the framework of rough surfaces with a Hurst (roughness) exponent\n$0.72 \\pm 0.01$. Here, we show that, independent of the temperature, the\niso-height lines at the percolation threshold have a well-defined fractal\ndimension and are conformally invariant, sharing the same statistical\nproperties as Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE$_{\\kappa}$) curves with\n$\\kappa=2.24\\pm0.07$. Interestingly, iso-height lines of other rough surfaces\nare not necessarily conformally invariant even if they have the same Hurst\nexponent, e.g. random Gaussian surfaces. We have found that the distribution of\nthe modulus of the Fourier coefficients plays an important role on this\nproperty. Our results not only introduce a new universality class and place the\nstudy of suspended graphene membranes within the theory of critical phenomena,\nbut also provide hints on the long-standing question about the origin of\nconformal invariance in iso-height lines of rough surfaces.\n", "  Excitonic insulating system is studied from the viewpoints of the orbital\nphysics in strongly correlated electron systems. An effective model Hamiltonian\nfor low-energy electronic states is derived from the two-orbital Hubbard model\nwith a finite energy difference corresponding to the crystalline field\nsplitting. The effective model is represented by the spin operators and the\npseudo-spin operators for the spin-state degrees of freedom. The ground state\nphase diagram is analyzed by the mean-field approximation. In addition to the\nlow-spin state and high-spin state phases, two kinds of the excitonic\ninsulating phases emerge as a consequence of the competition between the\ncrystalline field effect and the Hund coupling. The excitonic transition is\nclassified to be an Ising-like transition reflecting a spontaneous breaking of\nthe $Z_2$ symmetry. Magnetic structures in the two excitonic insulating phases\nare different from each other; an antiferromagnetic order and a spin nematic\norder. Collective excitations in each phase are examined by using the\ngeneralized spin-wave method. The Goldstone modes in the excitonic insulating\nphases appear in the dynamical correlation functions for the spins and\npseudo-spin operators. Both the transverse and longitudinal spin excitation\nmodes are active in the two excitonic insulating phases in contrast to the\nlow-spin state and high-spin state phases. Connections of the present results\nto the perovskite cobalt oxides are discussed.\n", "  Arrival directions of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) exhibit mainly\nan isotropic distribution with some small deviations in particular energy bins.\nIn this paper, the Yakutsk array data are tested for circular uniformity of\narrival directions in right ascension using 2 methods appropriate for the\nenergy ranges below and above $10^{18}$ eV. No statistically significant\ndeviation from uniformity is found in the arrival directions of cosmic rays\n(CRs) detected within the observation period 1974--2000.\n", "  Studies of fission dynamics, based on nuclear energy density functionals,\nhave shown that the coupling between shape and pairing degrees of freedom has a\npronounced effect on the nonperturbative collective inertia and, therefore, on\ndynamic (least-action) spontaneous fission paths and half-lives.\n  Collective potentials and nonperturbative cranking collective inertia tensors\nare calculated using the multidimensionally-constrained relativistic mean-field\n(MDC-RMF) model. Pairing correlations are treated in the BCS approximation\nusing a separable pairing force of finite range. Pairing fluctuations are\nincluded as a collective variable using a constraint on particle-number\ndispersion. Fission paths are determined with the dynamic programming method by\nminimizing the action in multidimensional collective spaces.\n  The dynamics of spontaneous fission of $^{264}$Fm and $^{250}$Fm are\nexplored. Fission paths, action integrals and corresponding half-lives computed\nin the three-dimensional collective space of shape and pairing coordinates,\nusing the relativistic functional DD-PC1 and a separable pairing force of\nfinite range, are compared with results obtained without pairing fluctuations.\nResults for $^{264}$Fm are also discussed in relation with those recently\nobtained using the HFB model.\n  The inclusion of pairing correlations in the space of collective coordinates\nfavors axially symmetric shapes along the dynamic path of the fissioning\nsystem, amplifies pairing as the path traverses the fission barriers,\nsignificantly reduces the action integral and shortens the corresponding SF\nhalf-life.\n", "  Predicted twenty years ago, positron binding to neutral atoms has not yet\nbeen observed experimentally. A new scheme is proposed to detect positron-atom\nbound states by colliding Rydberg positronium (Ps) with neutral atoms.\nEstimates of the charge-transfer reaction cross section are obtained using the\nfirst Born approximation for a selection of neutral atom targets and a wide\nrange of incident Ps energies and principal quantum numbers. We also estimate\nthe corresponding Ps ionization cross section. The accuracy of the calculations\nis tested by comparison with earlier predictions for Ps charge transfer in\ncollisions with hydrogen and antihydrogen. We describe an existing Rydberg Ps\nbeam suitable for producing positron-atom bound states and estimate signal\nrates based on the calculated cross sections and realistic experimental\nparameters. We conclude that the proposed methodology is capable of producing\nsuch states and of testing theoretical predictions of their binding energies.\n", "  Ever refined cosmological measurements have established the $\\Lambda$CDM\nconcordance model, with the key cosmological parameters being determined to\npercent-level precision today. This allows us to make explicit predictions for\nthe spectral distortions of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) created by\nvarious processes occurring in the early Universe. Here, we summarize all\nguaranteed CMB distortions and assess their total uncertainty within\n$\\Lambda$CDM. We also compare simple methods for approximating them,\nhighlighting some of the subtle aspects when it comes to interpreting future\ndistortion measurements. Under simplified assumptions, we briefly study how\nwell a PIXIE-like experiment may measure the main distortion parameters (i.e.,\n$\\mu$ and $y$). Next generation CMB spectrometers are expected to detect the\ndistortion caused by reionization and structure formation at extremely high\nsignificance. They will also be able to constrain the small-scale power\nspectrum through the associated $\\mu$-distortion, improving limits on running\nof the spectral index. Distortions from the recombination era, adiabatic\ncooling of matter relative to the CMB and dark matter annihilation require a\nhigher sensitivity than PIXIE in its current design. The crucial next step is\nan improved modeling of foregrounds and instrumental aspects, as we briefly\ndiscuss here.\n", "  We extend the Krylov-subspace based time-dependent numerical simulation\ntechnique for a qubit interacting with photons in a waveguide to the multiple\nqubit case. We analyze photon scattering from two qubits analytically and\nderive expressions for the bound states in the continuum (BIC). We show how the\nBIC can be excited. We use the BIC in a recent Pauli-Z gate proposal involving\ndecoherence free subspaces and obtain the gate fidelity as a function of the\ngate parameters. The techniques presented in the paper are useful for\ninvestigating the time evolution of quantum gates and other many-body systems\nwith multiple quenches in the Hamiltonian.\n", "  We study kinematic distributions that may help characterise the recently\nobserved excess in diphoton events at 750 GeV at the LHC Run 2. Several\nscenarios are considered, including spin-0 and spin-2 750 GeV resonances that\ndecay directly into photon pairs as well as heavier parent resonances that\nundergo three-body or cascade decays. We find that combinations of the\ndistributions of the diphoton system and the leading photon can distinguish the\ntopology and mass spectra of the different scenarios, while patterns of QCD\nradiation can help differentiate the production mechanisms. Moreover, missing\nenergy is a powerful discriminator for the heavy parent scenarios if they\ninvolve (effectively) invisible particles. While our study concentrates on the\ncurrent excess at 750 GeV, the analysis is general and can also be useful for\ncharacterising other potential diphoton signals in the future.\n", "  Magnetic anisotropy (MA) is one of the most important material properties for\nmodern spintronic devices. Conventional manipulation of the intrinsic MA, i.e.\nmagnetocrystalline anisotropy (MCA), typically depends upon crystal symmetry.\nExtrinsic control over the MA is usually achieved by introducing shape\nanisotropy or exchange bias from another magnetically ordered material. Here we\ndemonstrate a pathway to manipulate MA of 3d transition metal oxides (TMOs) by\ndigitally inserting non-magnetic 5d TMOs with pronounced spin-orbit coupling\n(SOC). High quality superlattices comprised of ferromagnetic La2/3Sr1/3MnO3\n(LSMO) and paramagnetic SrIrO3 (SIO) are synthesized with the precise control\nof thickness at atomic scale. Magnetic easy axis reorientation is observed by\ncontrolling the dimensionality of SIO, mediated through the emergence of a\nnovel spin-orbit state within the nominally paramagnetic SIO.\n", "  We report the transport, thermodynamic, $\\mu$SR and neutron study of the\nCa$_{0.74(1)}$La$_{0.26(1)}$(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$)As$_{2}$ single crystals,\nmapping out the temperature-doping level phase diagram. Upon Co substitution on\nthe Fe site, the structural/magnetic phase transitions in this 112 compound are\nsuppressed and superconductivity up to 20 K occurs. Our measurements of the\nsuperconducting and magnetic volume fractions show that these two phases\ncoexist microscopically in the underdoped region, in contrast to the related\n10-3-8 Ca$_{10}$(Pt$_{3}$As$_{8}$)((Fe$_{1-x}$Pt$_x$)$_{2}$As$_{2}$)$_{5}$\ncompound, where coexistence is absent. Supported by model calculations, we\ndiscuss the differences in the phase diagrams of the 112 and 10-3-8 compounds\nin terms of the FeAs interlayer coupling, whose strength is affected by the\ncharacter of the spacer layer, which is metallic in the 112 and insulating in\nthe 10-3-8.\n", "  Successful scientific applications of large-scale molecular dynamics often\nrely on automated methods for identifying the local crystalline structure of\ncondensed phases. Many existing methods for structural identification, such as\nCommon Neighbour Analysis, rely on interatomic distances (or thresholds\nthereof) to classify atomic structure. As a consequence they are sensitive to\nstrain and thermal displacements, and preprocessing such as quenching or\ntemporal averaging of the atomic positions is necessary to provide reliable\nidentifications. We propose a new method, Polyhedral Template Matching (PTM),\nwhich classifies structures according to the topology of the local atomic\nenvironment, without any ambiguity in the classification, and with greater\nreliability than e.g. Common Neighbour Analysis in the presence of thermal\nfluctuations. We demonstrate that the method can reliably be used to identify\nstructures even in simulations near the melting point, and that it can identify\nthe most common ordered alloy structures as well. In addition, the method makes\nit easy to identify the local lattice orientation in polycrystalline samples,\nand to calculate the local strain tensor. An implementation is made available\nunder a Free and Open Source Software license.\n", "  We present a mathematical analysis of the early detection of Ebola virus. The\npropagation of the virus is analysed by using a Susceptible, Infected,\nRecovered (SIR) model. In order to provide useful predictions about the\npotential transmission of the virus, we analyse and simulate the SIR model with\nvital dynamics, by adding demographic effects and an induced death rate. Then,\nwe compute the equilibria of the model. The numerical simulations confirm the\ntheoretical analysis. Our study describes the 2015 detection of Ebola virus in\nGuinea, the parameters of the model being identified from the World Health\nOrganization data. Finally, we consider an optimal control problem of the\npropagation of the Ebola virus, minimizing the number of infected individuals\nwhile taking into account the cost of vaccination.\n", "  A novel adjoint-based framework oriented to optimal flow control in\ncompressible direct numerical simulations is presented. Also, a new formulation\nof the adjoint characteristic boundary conditions is introduced, which enhances\nthe stability of the adjoint simulations. The flow configuration chosen as a\ncase study consists of a two dimensional open cavity flow with aspect ratio\n$L/H=3$ and Reynolds number $Re=5000$. This flow configuration is of particular\ninterest, as the turbulent and chaotic nature of separated flows pushes the\nadjoint approach to its limit. The target of the flow actuation, defined as\ncost, is the reduction of the pressure fluctuations at the sensor location. To\nexploit the advantages of the adjoint method, a large number of control\nparameters is used. The control consists of an actuating sub-domain where a\ntwo-dimensional body force is applied at every point within the sub-volume.\nThis results in a total of $2.256 \\cdot 10^6$ control parameters. The final\nactuation achieved a successful reduction of the cost of $79.6\\%$, by altering\nthe directivity of the sound radiated by the trailing edge of the cavity and\nbreaking up the large shear layer instabilities into smaller structures.\n", "  A novel technique for measuring the mass of the top quark that uses only the\nkinematic properties of its charged decay products is presented. Top quark pair\nevents with final states with one or two charged leptons and hadronic jets are\nselected from the data set of 8 TeV proton-proton collisions, corresponding to\nan integrated luminosity of 19.7 inverse femtobarns. By reconstructing\nsecondary vertices inside the selected jets and computing the invariant mass of\nthe system formed by the secondary vertex and an isolated lepton, an observable\nis constructed that is sensitive to the top quark mass that is expected to be\nrobust against the energy scale of hadronic jets. The main theoretical\nsystematic uncertainties, concerning the modeling of the fragmentation and\nhadronization of b quarks and the reconstruction of secondary vertices from the\ndecays of b hadrons, are studied. A top quark mass of 173.68 +/- 0.20 (stat)\n+1.58 -0.97 (syst) GeV is measured. The overall systematic uncertainty is\ndominated by the uncertainty in the b quark fragmentation and the modeling of\nkinematic properties of the top quark.\n", "  We investigate properties of carbon-oxygen white dwarfs with respect to the\ncomposite uncertainties in the reaction rates using the stellar evolution\ntoolkit, Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) and the\nprobability density functions in the reaction rate library STARLIB. These are\nthe first Monte Carlo stellar evolution studies that use complete stellar\nmodels. Focusing on 3 M$_{\\odot}$ models evolved from the pre main-sequence to\nthe first thermal pulse, we survey the remnant core mass, composition, and\nstructure properties as a function of 26 STARLIB reaction rates covering\nhydrogen and helium burning using a Principal Component Analysis and Spearman\nRank-Order Correlation. Relative to the arithmetic mean value, we find the\nwidth of the 95\\% confidence interval to be $\\Delta M_{{\\rm 1TP}}$ $\\approx$\n0.019 M$_{\\odot}$ for the core mass at the first thermal pulse,\n$\\Delta$$t_{\\rm{1TP}}$ $\\approx$ 12.50 Myr for the age, $\\Delta \\log(T_{{\\rm\nc}}/{\\rm K}) \\approx$ 0.013 for the central temperature, $\\Delta\n\\log(\\rho_{{\\rm c}}/{\\rm g \\ cm}^{-3}) \\approx$ 0.060 for the central density,\n$\\Delta Y_{\\rm{e,c}} \\approx$ 2.6$\\times$10$^{-5}$ for the central electron\nfraction, $\\Delta X_{\\rm c}(^{22}\\rm{Ne}) \\approx$ 5.8$\\times$10$^{-4}$,\n$\\Delta X_{\\rm c}(^{12}\\rm{C}) \\approx$ 0.392, and $\\Delta X_{\\rm\nc}(^{16}\\rm{O}) \\approx$ 0.392. Uncertainties in the experimental\n$^{12}$C($\\alpha,\\gamma)^{16}\\rm{O}$, triple-$\\alpha$, and\n$^{14}$N($p,\\gamma)^{15}\\rm{O}$ reaction rates dominate these variations. We\nalso consider a grid of 1 to 6 M$_{\\odot}$ models evolved from the pre\nmain-sequence to the final white dwarf to probe the sensitivity of the\ninitial-final mass relation to experimental uncertainties in the hydrogen and\nhelium reaction rates.\n", "  Experimental searches for the electron electric dipole moment (EDM) probe new\nphysics beyond the Standard Model. The current best EDM limit was set by the\nACME Collaboration [Science \\textbf{343}, 269 (2014)], constraining time\nreversal symmetry ($T$) violating physics at the TeV energy scale. ACME used\noptical pumping to prepare a coherent superposition of ThO $H^3\\Delta_1$ states\nthat have aligned electron spins. Spin precession due to the molecule's\ninternal electric field was measured to extract the EDM. We report here on an\nimproved method for preparing this spin-aligned state of the electron by using\nSTIRAP. We demonstrate a transfer efficiency of $75\\pm5\\%$, representing a\nsignificant gain in signal for a next generation EDM experiment. We discuss the\nparticularities of implementing STIRAP in systems such as ours, where molecular\nensembles with large phase-space distributions are transfered via weak\nmolecular transitions with limited laser power and limited optical access.\n", "  The dispersive wave propagation in a periodic metamaterial with tetrachiral\ntopology and inertial local resonators is investigated. The Floquet-Bloch\nspectrum of the metamaterial is compared with that of the tetrachiral beam\nlattice material without resonators. The resonators can be designed to open and\nshift frequency band gaps, that is, spectrum intervals in which harmonic waves\ndo not propagate. Therefore, an optimal passive control of the frequency band\nstructure can be pursued in the metamaterial. To this aim, a suitable\nconstrained nonlinear optimization problem on a compact set of admissible\ngeometrical and mechanical parameters is stated. According to functional\nrequirements, the particular set of parameters which determines the largest\nlow-frequency band gap between a pair of consecutive branches of the\nFloquet-Bloch spectrum is obtained. The optimization problem is successfully\nsolved by means of a version of the method of moving asymptotes, combined with\na quasi-Monte Carlo multi-start technique.\n", "  We study a model of a population making a binary decision based on\ninformation spreading within the population, which is fully connected or\ncovering a square grid. We assume that a fraction of the population wants to\nmake the choice of the majority, while the rest want to make the minority\nchoice. This resembles opinion spreading with \"contrarian\" agents, but has the\ngame theoretic aspect that agents try to optimize their own situation in ways\nthat are incompatible with the common good. When this fraction is less than\n1/2, the population can efficiently self-organize to a state where agents get\nwhat they want -- the majority (i.e. the majority seekers) have one opinion,\nthe minority seekers have the other. If the fraction is larger than 1/2, there\nis a frustration in the population that dramatically changes the dynamics. In\nthis region, the population converges, through some distinct phases, to a state\nof approximately equal-sized opinions. Just over the threshold the state of the\npopulation is furthest from the collectively optimal solution.\n", "  Binary active galactic nuclei (AGNs) provide clues to how gas-rich mergers\ntrigger and fuel AGNs and how supermassive black hole (SMBH) pairs evolve in a\ngas-rich environment. While significant effort has been invested in their\nidentification, the detailed properties of binary AGNs and their host galaxies\nare still poorly constrained. In a companion paper, we examined the nature of\nionizing sources in the double nuclei of four kpc-scale binary AGNs with\nredshifts between 0.1~0.2. Here, we present their host galaxy morphology based\non F336W (U-band) and F105W (Y-band) images taken by the Wide Field Camera 3\n(WFC3) onboard the Hubble Space Telescope. Our targets have double-peaked\nnarrow emission lines and were confirmed to host binary AGNs with follow up\nobservations. We find that kpc-scale binary AGNs occur in galaxy mergers with\ndiverse morphological types. There are three major mergers with intermediate\nmorphologies and a minor merger with a dominant disk component. We estimate the\nmasses of the SMBHs from their host bulge stellar masses and obtain Eddington\nratios for each AGN. Compared with a representative control sample drawn at the\nsame redshift and stellar mass, the AGN luminosities and Eddington ratios of\nour binary AGNs are similar to those of single AGNs. The U-Y color maps\nindicate that clumpy star forming regions could significantly affect the X-ray\ndetection of binary AGNs, e.g., the hardness ratio. Considering the weak X-ray\nemission in AGNs triggered in merger systems, we suggest that samples of X-ray\nselected AGNs may be biased against gas-rich mergers.\n", "  In this paper, we study the relation between the Cachazo-He-Yuan (CHY)\nformula and the maximal-helicity-violating (MHV) amplitudes of Yang-Mills and\ngravity in four dimensions. We prove that only one special rational solution of\nthe scattering equations found by Weinzierl support the MHV amplitudes. Namely,\nlocalized at this solution, the integrated CHY formula reproduces the\nParke-Taylor formula for Yang-Mills amplitudes as well as the Hodges formula\nfor gravitational amplitudes. This is achieved by developing techniques, in a\nmanifestly M\\\"obius covariant formalism, to explicitly compute relevant reduced\nPfaffians/determinants. We observe and prove two interesting properties (or\nidentities), which facilitate the computations. We also check that all the\nother $(n-3)!-1$ solutions to the scattering equations do not support the MHV\namplitudes, and prove analytically that this is indeed true for the other\nspecial rational solution proposed by Weinzierl, that actually supports the\nanti-MHV amplitudes.\n", "  The field equations of the recent nonlocal generalization of Einstein's\ntheory of gravitation are presented in a form that is reminiscent of general\nrelativity. The implications of the nonlocal field equations are studied in the\ncase of conformally flat spacetimes. Even in this simple case, the field\nequations are intractable. Therefore, to gain insight into the nature of these\nequations, we investigate the structure of nonlocal gravity in two-dimensional\nspacetimes. While any smooth 2D spacetime is conformally flat and satisfies\nEinstein's field equations, only a subset containing either a Killing vector or\na homothetic Killing vector can satisfy the field equations of nonlocal\ngravity.\n", "  We present a method for creating a quantum degenerate gas of metastable\nalkaline-earth atoms. This has yet to be achieved due to inelastic collisions\nthat limit evaporative cooling in the metastable states. Quantum degenerate\nsamples prepared in the $^{1}S_{0}$ ground state can be rapidly transferred to\neither the $^{3}P_{2}$ or $^{3}P_{0}$ state via a coherent 3-photon process.\nNumerical integration of the density matrix evolution for the fine structure of\nbosonic alkaline-earth atoms shows that transfer efficiencies of $\\simeq90\\%$\ncan be achieved with experimentally feasible laser parameters in both Sr and\nYb. Importantly, the 3-photon process can be set up such that it imparts no net\nmomentum to the degenerate gas during the excitation, which will allow for\nstudies of metastable samples outside the Lamb-Dicke regime. We discuss several\nexperimental challenges to successfully realizing our scheme, including the\nminimization of differential AC Stark shifts between the four states connected\nby the 3-photon transition.\n", "  Masses of the dimesonic (meson-antimeson) molecular states are calculated\nusing Yukawa like and meson exchange potential in semi-relativistic approach.\nThe digamma decay width of the dimesonic systems are evaluated using the\nspectroscopic parameters. Many states such as $f{}_{0}$(980), $h{}_{1}$(1380),\n$a{}_{0}$(1450), $f{}_{0}$(1500), $f{}_{2}'$(1525), $f{}_{2}$(1565),\n$a{}_{2}$(1700), $f{}_{0}$(1710), $f{}_{2}$(1810), $f{}_{2}$(2010) have shown\nthe signature of dimesonic molecules. Their masses and digamma widths are in\ngood agreement with other theoretical results as well as experimental\nmeasurements.\n", "  We examine Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen's (EPR) steering nonlocality for two\nrealisable Schrodinger cat-type states where a meso/ macroscopic system (called\nthe \"cat\"-system) is entangled with a spin-$1/2$ system. For large cat-systems,\nwe show that a local hidden state model is near-satisfied, meaning that the\ncat-system can be consistent with being in a mixture of \"dead\" and \"alive\"\nstates despite that it is entangled with the spin system. We justify that a\nrigorous signature of the Schrodinger cat-type paradox is the EPR-steering of\nthe cat-system and provide two experimental signatures. This leads to a hybrid\nquantum/ classical interpretation of the macroscopic pointer of a measurement\ndevice and suggests many Schrodinger cat-type paradoxes can be explained by\nmicroscopic nonlocality.\n", "  Network models with latent geometry have been used successfully in many\napplications in network science and other disciplines, yet it is usually\nimpossible to tell if a given real network is geometric, meaning if it is a\ntypical element in an ensemble of random geometric graphs. Here we identify\nstructural properties of networks that guarantee that random graphs having\nthese properties are geometric. Specifically we show that random graphs in\nwhich expected degree and clustering of every node are fixed to some constants\nare equivalent to random geometric graphs on the real line, if clustering is\nsufficiently strong. Large numbers of triangles, homogeneously distributed\nacross all nodes as in real networks, are thus a consequence of network\ngeometricity. The methods we use to prove this are quite general and applicable\nto other network ensembles, geometric or not, and to certain problems in\nquantum gravity.\n", "  We present an isolated Milky Way-like simulation in GADGET2 N-body SPH code.\nThe Galactic disk star formation rate (SFR) surface densities and stellar mass\nindicative of Solar neighbourhood are used as thresholds to model the\ndistribution of stellar mass in life friendly environments. SFR and stellar\ncomponent density are calculated averaging the GADGET2 particle properties on a\n2D grid mapped on the Galactic plane. The peak values for possibly habitable\nstellar mass surface density move from $10$ to $15$ kpc cylindrical\ngalactocentric distance in $10$ Gyr simulated time span. At $10$ Gyr the\nsimulation results imply the following. Stellar particles which have spent\nalmost all of their life time in habitable friendly conditions reside typically\nat $\\sim16$ kpc from Galactic centre and are $\\sim 3$ Gyr old. Stellar\nparticles that have spent $\\ge 90 \\%$ of their $4-5$ Gyr long life time in\nhabitable friendly conditions, are also predominantly found in the outskirts of\nthe Galactic disk. Less then $1 \\%$ of these particles can be found at a\ntypical Solar system galactocentric distance of $8-10$ kpc. Our results imply\nthat the evolution of an isolated spiral galaxy is likely to result in galactic\ncivilizations emerging at the outskirts of the galactic disk around stellar\nhosts younger than the Sun.\n", "  We consider a complex covariant form of the macroscopic Maxwell equations, in\na moving medium or at rest, following the original ideas of Minkowski. A\ncompact, Lorentz invariant, derivation of the energy-momentum tensor and the\ncorresponding differential balance equations are given. Conservation laws and\nquantization of electromagnetic field will be discussed in this covariant\napproach elsewhere.\n", "  We review recent progress in formulating the worldvolume theory of M2-branes\nusing the Nambu bracket. Although it is generally agreed that this formulation\nshould be replaced by another using the superconformal Chern-Simons theory, we\ntry to pursue a possible complementary role played by the Nambu bracket. Since\nthe partition function of the superconformal Chern-Simons theory implies a\nhidden super gauge group, we study the supersymmetric generalization of the\nNambu bracket. We explicitly construct the superunitary Nambu algebra.\n", "  Recently a short scale modified black hole metric, known as holographic\nmetric, has been proposed in order to capture the self-complete character of\ngravity. In this paper we show that such a metric can reproduce some geometric\nfeatures expected from the quantum $N$-portrait beyond the semi-classical\nlimit. We show that for a generic $N$ this corresponds to having an effective\nenergy momentum tensor in Einstein equations or, equivalently, non-local terms\nin the gravity action. We also consider the higher dimensional extension of the\nmetric and the case of an AdS cosmological term. We provide a detailed\nthermodynamic analysis of both cases, with particular reference to the\nrepercussions on the Hawking-Page phase transition.\n", "  In this letter we unveil the existence of transient hidden coexisting chaotic\nattractors, in a simplified Hopfield neural network with three neurons.\n", "  We challenge the analysis and conclusions of the paper Phys. Rev. Lett. 109,\n141103 (2012) by V. Gharibyan on the tests of Planck-scale gravity with\naccelerators. The main objective of the Comment is the observation that the\nexplored domain of \"quantum gravity\" parameters is already ruled out\nexperimentally from, e.g., absence of the vacuum Cherenkov radiation.\n", "  We investigate the constraints imposed by global gravitational anomalies on\nparity odd induced transport coefficients in even dimensions for theories with\nchiral fermions, gravitinos and self dual tensors. The $\\eta$-invariant for the\nlarge diffeomorphism corresponding to the $T$ transformation on a torus\nconstraints the coefficients in the thermal effective action up to mod 2. We\nshow that the result obtained for the parity odd transport for gravitinos using\nglobal anomaly matching is consistent with the direct perturbative calculation.\nIn $d=6$ we see that the second Pontryagin class in the anomaly polynomial does\nnot contribute to the $\\eta$-invariant which provides a topological explanation\nof this observation in the `replacement rule'. We then perform a direct\nperturbative calculation for the contribution of the self dual tensor in $d=6$\nto the parity odd transport coefficient using the Feynman rules proposed by\nGaum\\'{e} and Witten. The result for the transport coefficient agrees with that\nobtained using matching of global anomalies.\n", "  We analyze temporal characteristics of signals from the wide field-of-view\n(WFOV) Cherenkov telescope (CT) detecting extensive air showers (EAS) of cosmic\nrays (CR) in coincidence with surface detectors of the Yakutsk array. Our aim\nis to reveal causal relationships between measured characteristics and physical\nproperties of EAS.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the apparent contact angle and contact angle\nhysteresis of a droplet placed on a liquid infused surface. We show that the\napparent contact angle is not uniquely defined by material parameters, but also\nhas a strong dependence on the relative size between the droplet and its\nsurrounding wetting ridge formed by the infusing liquid. We derive a closed\nform expression for the contact angle in the limit of vanishing wetting ridge,\nand compute the correction for small but finite ridge, which corresponds to an\neffective line tension term. We also predict contact angle hysteresis on liquid\ninfused surfaces generated by the pinning of the contact lines by the surface\ncorrugations. Our analytical expressions for both the apparent contact angle\nand contact angle hysteresis can be interpreted as `weighted sums' between the\ncontact angles of the infusing liquid relative to the droplet and surrounding\ngas phases, where the weighting coefficients are given by ratios of the fluid\nsurface tensions.\n", "  We study the noncommutative operator graph ${\\mathcal L}_{\\theta }$ depending\non complex parameter $\\theta $ recently introduced by M.E. Shirokov to\nconstruct channels with positive quantum zero-error capacity having vanishing\nn-shot capacity. We define the noncommutative group $G$ and the algebra\n${\\mathcal A}_{\\theta }$ which is a quotient of ${\\mathbb C}G$ with respect to\nthe special algebraic relation depending on $\\theta $ such that the matrix\nrepresentation $\\phi $ of ${\\mathcal A}_{\\theta }$ results in the algebra\n${\\mathcal M}_{\\theta }$ generated by ${\\mathcal L}_{\\theta }$. In the case of\n$\\theta =\\pm 1$ $\\phi $ is degenerated to the faithful representation of\n${\\mathbb C}K_4$, where $K_4$ is the Klein group. Thus, ${\\mathcal L}_{\\theta\n}$ can be considered as a noncommutative deformation of the graph associated\nwith the Klein group.\n", "  We use an atomic vapor cell as a frequency tunable microwave field detector\noperating at frequencies from GHz to tens of GHz. We detect microwave magnetic\nfields from 2.3 GHz to 26.4 GHz, and measure the amplitude of the sigma+\ncomponent of an 18 GHz microwave field. Our proof-of-principle demonstration\nrepresents a four orders of magnitude extension of the frequency tunable range\nof atomic magnetometers from their previous dc to several MHz range. When\nintegrated with a high resolution microwave imaging system, this will allow for\nthe complete reconstruction of the vector components of a microwave magnetic\nfield and the relative phase between them. Potential applications include\nnear-field characterisation of microwave circuitry and devices, and medical\nmicrowave sensing and imaging.\n", "  This list of problems arose as a collaborative effort among the participants\nof the Arbeitsgemeinschaft on Mathematical Quasicrystals, which was held at the\nMathematisches Forschungsinstitut Oberwolfach in October 2015. The purpose of\nour meeting was to bring together researchers from a variety of disciplines\nwith a common goal of understanding different viewpoints and approaches\nsurrounding the theory of mathematical quasicrystals. The problems reflect this\ngoal and this diversity and we hope that they will motivate further\ncross-disciplinary research and lead to new advances in our overall vision of\nthis rapidly developing field.\n", "  Experimental results of the transverse momentum distributions of phi mesons\nand $\\Omega$ hyperons produced in gold-gold (Au-Au) collisions with different\ncentrality intervals, measured by the STAR Collaboration at different energies\n(7.7, 11.5, 19.6, 27, and 39 GeV) in the beam energy scan (BES) program at the\nrelativistic heavy ion collider (RHIC), are approximately described by the\nsingle Erlang distribution and the two-component Schwinger mechanism.\nMeanwhile, the STAR experimental transverse momentum distributions of\nnegatively charged particles, produced in Au-Au collisions at RHIC BES\nenergies, are approximately described by the two-component Erlang distribution\nand the single Tsallis statistics. The excitation functions of free parameters\nare obtained from the fit to the experimental data. A weak softest point in the\nstring tension in $\\Omega$ hyperon spectra is observed at 7.7 GeV.\n", "  The logical inference approach to quantum theory, proposed earlier [Ann.\nPhys. 347 (2014) 45-73], is considered in a relativistic setting. It is shown\nthat the Klein-Gordon equation for a massive, charged, and spinless particle\nderives from the combination of the requirements that the space-time data\ncollected by probing the particle is obtained from the most robust experiment\nand that on average, the classical relativistic equation of motion of a\nparticle holds.\n", "  The structures of some bisphosphonates (clodronate, etidronate, pamidronate,\nalendronate, risedronate, zoledronate, minodronate) were obtained and analyzed,\nand their adsorption energies onto hydroxyapatite (001) surface were compared\nto find out ranking order of binding affinity, which shows that the adsorption\nenergy is the largest for pamidronate, followed by alendronate, zoledronate,\nclodronate, ibandronate, the lowest for minodronate and etidronate.\n", "  This paper describes the implementation of polycomp, a open-sourced, publicly\navailable program for compressing one-dimensional data series in tabular\nformat. The program is particularly suited for compressing smooth, noiseless\nstreams of data like pointing information, as one of the algorithms it\nimplements applies a combination of least squares polynomial fitting and\ndiscrete Chebyshev transforms that is able to achieve a compression ratio Cr up\nto ~40 in the examples discussed in this work. This performance comes at the\nexpense of a loss of information, whose upper bound is configured by the user.\nI show two areas in which the usage of polycomp is interesting. In the first\nexample, I compress the ephemeris table of an astronomical object (Ganymede),\nobtaining Cr ~ 20, with a compression error on the x, y, z coordinates smaller\nthan 1 m. In the second example, I compress the publicly available timelines\nrecorded by the Low Frequency Instrument (LFI), an array of microwave\nradiometers onboard the ESA Planck spacecraft. The compression reduces the\nneeded storage from ~6.5 TB to ~0.75 TB (C_r ~ 9), thus making them small\nenough to be kept in a portable hard drive.\n", "  Analytic predictions of mean velocity profile (MVP) and streamwise ($x$)\ndevelopment of related integral quantities are presented for flows in channel\nand turbulent boundary layer (TBL), based on a symmetry analysis of eddy length\nand total stress. Specific predictions are the friction velocity $u_\\tau$: ${\nU_e/u_\\tau }\\approx 2.22\\ln Re_x+2.86-3.83\\ln(\\ln Re_x)$; the boundary layer\nthickness $\\delta_e$: $x/\\delta_e \\approx 7.27\\ln Re_x-5.18-12.52\\ln(\\ln\nRe_x)$; the momentum thickness Reynolds number: $Re_x/Re_\\theta=4.94[{(\\ln\n{{\\mathop{\\rm Re}\\nolimits} _{\\theta} } + 1.88)^2} + 1]$, all in good agreement\nwith empirical data.\n", "  In this work we deal with non-topological solutions of the Q-ball type in two\nspace-time dimensions, in models described by a single complex scalar field\nthat engenders global symmetry. The main novelty is the presence of stable\nQ-balls solutions that live in a compact interval of the real line and appear\nfrom a family of models controlled by two distinct parameters. We find\nanalytical solutions and study their charge and energy, and show how to control\nthe parameters to make the Q-balls classically and quantum mechanically stable.\n", "  We study a Weyl (semi)metal which couples to local magnets. In the continuum\nlimit, the Hamiltonian of the system matches the Chern-Simons-Maxwell-Dirac\nfunctional and then the ground state is governed by generalized Seiberg-Witten\n(SW) or Freund equations in terms of the sign of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\ncoupling. The ground states determined by the Freund equations may either be\nmonopolar Weyl semimetal accompanied by the ferromagnetic magnets (MWFM) or SW\nmonopoles which consist of spheric Weyl fermions coupled to chiral magnets,\ndepending on the strength of the Kondo coupling. In the latter phase, the\ntopological ground state is characterized by SW invariants and with a Weyl\nsurface on which the Weyl metal is of an exotic dispersion $\\propto \\sqrt k$.\nThere are also the metastable SW monopole solutions carrying an opposite SW\ninvariant for the SW equations while the ground state in this case is the MWFM\nstate.\n", "  The spectra of turbulent heat flux $\\mathrm{H}(k)$ in Rayleigh-B\\'{e}nard\nconvection with and without uniform rotation are presented. The spectrum\n$\\mathrm{H}(k)$ scales with wave number $k$ as $\\sim k^{-2}$. The scaling\nexponent is almost independent of the Taylor number $\\mathrm{Ta}$ and Prandtl\nnumber $\\mathrm{Pr}$ for higher values of the reduced Rayleigh number $r$ ($ >\n10^3$). The exponent, however, depends on $\\mathrm{Ta}$ and $\\mathrm{Pr}$ for\nsmaller values of $r$ ($<10^3$). The probability distribution functions of the\nlocal heat fluxes are non-Gaussian and have exponential tails.\n", "  Aspects of quantum mechanics on a ring are studied. Either one or two\nimpenetrable barriers are inserted at nodal and non-nodal points to turn the\nring into either one or two infinite square wells. In the process, the wave\nfunction of a particle can change its energy, as it gets entangled with the\nbarriers and the insertion points become nodes. Two seemingly innocuous\nassumptions representing locality and linearity are investigated. Namely, a\nbarrier insertion at a fixed node needs no energy, and barrier insertions can\nbe described by linear maps. It will be shown that the two assumptions are\nincompatible.\n", "  We investigate the change in the non-zero Chern number and out-of-plane spin\npolarization of the edge currents in a honeycomb lattice with the\nHaldane-Rashba interaction. This interaction breaks the time-reversal symmetry\ndue to the Haldane phase caused by a current loop at site-I and -II atoms and\nalso accounts for the Rashba-type spin-orbit interaction. The Rashba spin-orbit\ninteraction increases the number of Dirac points and the band-touching\nphenomenon can be generated by tuning the on-site potential in the non-zero\nHaldane phase. By using the Pontryagin winding number and numerical Berry\ncurvature methods, we find that the Chern number pattern is $\\{+2, -1, 0\\}$ and\n$\\{-2, +1, 0\\}$ for the positive and negative Haldane phase, respectively. A\nnon-zero Chern number is called a Chern-insulating phase. We discovered that\nchanges in both the Haldane phase and on-site potential leads to a change in\nthe orientation of the bulk spin polarization of site-I and site-II atoms.\nInterestingly, in a ribbon with a zigzag edge, which naturally has site-I atoms\nat one outer edge and site-II atoms at the opposite outer edge, the spin\npolarization of the edge states approximately obeys the properties of bulk spin\npolarization regardless of the change in the Chern number. In addition, even\nwhen the Chern number changes from $+2$ to $-1$ (or $-2$ to $+1$), by tuning\nthe strength of the on-site potential, the sign of the spin polarization of the\nedge states persists. This approximate bulk-edge correspondence of the spin\npolarization in the Haldane-Rashba system would play an important role in\nspintronics, because it enables us to control the orientation of the spin\npolarization in a single Chern-insulating phase.\n", "  The intrinsic nuclear shapes deviating from a sphere not only manifest\nthemselves in nuclear collective states but also play important roles in\ndetermining nuclear potential energy surfaces (PES's) and fission barriers. In\norder to describe microscopically and self-consistently nuclear shapes and\nPES's with as many shape degrees of freedom as possible included, we developed\nmultidimensionally-constrained covariant density functional theories\n(MDC-CDFTs). In MDC-CDFTs, the axial symmetry and the reflection symmetry are\nboth broken and all deformations characterized by $\\beta_{\\lambda\\mu}$ with\neven $\\mu$ are considered. We have used the MDC-CDFTs to study PES's and\nfission barriers of actinides, the non-axial octupole $Y_{32}$ correlations in\n$N = 150$ isotones and shapes of hypernuclei. In this Review we will give\nbriefly the formalism of MDC-CDFTs and present the applications to normal\nnuclei.\n", "  The recent report of superconductivity under high pressure at the record\ntransition temperature of Tc=203K in sulfur hydride has been identified as\nconventional in view of the observation of an isotope effect upon deuteration.\nHere it is demonstrated that conventional theories of superconductivity in the\nsense of BCS or Eliashberg formalisms can neither account for the observed\nvalues of Tc nor the pressure dependence of the isotope coefficient. The only\nway out of the dilemma is a multi-band approach of superconductivity where\nalready small interband coupling suffices to achieve the high values of Tc\ntogether with the anomalous pressure dependent isotope effect. In addition, it\nis shown that anharmonicity of the hydrogen bonds vanishes under pressure\nwhereas anharmonic phonon modes related to sulfur are still active\n", "  A procedure is introduced to recognise sunspots automatically in solar\nfull-disk photosphere images obtained from Huairou Solar Observing Station,\nNational Astronomical Observatories of China. The images are first\npre-processed through Gaussian algorithm. Sunspots are then recognised by the\nmorphological Bot-hat operation and Otsu threshold. Wrong selection of sunspots\nis eliminated by a criterion of sunspot properties. Besides, in order to\ncalculate the sunspots areas and the solar centre, the solar limb is extracted\nby a procedure using morphological closing and erosion operations and setting\nan adaptive threshold. Results of sunspot recognition reveal that the number of\nthe sunspots detected by our procedure has a quite good agreement with the\nmanual method. The sunspot recognition rate is 95% and error rate is 1.2%. The\nsunspot areas calculated by our method have high correlation (95%) with the\narea data from USAF/NOAA.\n", "  In this work, we review the results of several recent works on the\nexperimental and theoretical studies of monolayer superconducting transition\nmetal dichalcogenides (TMD) such as superconducting MoS2 and NbSe2. We show how\nthe strong Ising spin-orbit coupling (SOC), a special type of SOC which pins\nelectron spins to out-of-plane directions, can affect the superconducting\nproperties of the materials. Particularly, we discuss how the in-plane upper\ncritical fields of the materials can be strongly enhanced by Ising SOC and how\nTMD materials can be used to engineer topological superconductors and nodal\ntopological superconductors which support Majorana fermions.\n", "  The properties of quantum-chromo dynamics (QCD) nowadays are accessable by\nlattice QCD calculations at vanishing quark chemical potential $\\mu_q$=0 but\noften lack a transparent physical interpretation. In this review we report\nabout results from an extended dynamical quasiparticle model (DQPM$^*$) in\nwhich the effective parton propagators have a complex selfenergy that depends\non the temperature $T$ of the medium as well as on the chemical potential\n$\\mu_q$ and the parton three-momentum ${\\boldsymbol p}$ with respect to the\nmedium at rest. It is demonstrated that this approach allows for a good\ndescription of QCD thermodynamics with respect to the entropy density, pressure\netc. above the critical temperature $T_c \\approx$ 158 MeV. Furthermore, the\nquark susceptibility $\\chi_q$ and the quark number density $n_q$ are found to\nbe reproduced simultaneously at zero and finite quark chemical potential. The\nshear and bulk viscosities $\\eta, \\zeta$, and the electric conductivity\n$\\sigma_e$ from the DQPM$^*$ also turn out in close agreement with lattice\nresults for $\\mu_q$ =0. The DQPM$^*$, furthermore, allows to evaluate the\nmomentum $p$, $T$ and $\\mu_q$ dependencies of the partonic degrees of freedom\nalso for larger $\\mu_q$ which are mandatory for transport studies of heavy-ion\ncollisions in the regime 5 GeV $< \\sqrt{s_{NN}} <$ 10 GeV. We finally calculate\nthe charm quark diffusion coefficient $D_s$ -- evaluated from the differential\ncross sections of partons in the medium for light and heavy quarks by employing\nthe propagators and couplings from the DQPM -- and compare to the available\nlattice data. It is argued that the complete set of observables allows for a\ntransparent interpretation of the properties of hot QCD.\n", "  We introduce twisted Fock representations of noncommutative K\\\"ahler\nmanifolds and give their explicit expressions. The twisted Fock representation\nis a representation of the Heisenberg like algebra whose states are constructed\nby acting creation operators on a vacuum state. \"Twisted\" means that creation\noperators are not hermitian conjugate of annihilation operators in this\nrepresentation. In deformation quantization of K\\\"ahler manifolds with\nseparation of variables formulated by Karabegov, local complex coordinates and\npartial derivatives of the K\\\"ahler potential with respect to coordinates\nsatisfy the commutation relations between the creation and annihilation\noperators. Based on these relations, we construct the twisted Fock\nrepresentation of noncommutative K\\\"ahler manifolds and give a dictionary to\ntranslate between the twisted Fock representations and functions on\nnoncommutative K\\\"ahler manifolds concretely.\n", "  The completeness of source detection is critical for analyzing the\nphotometric and spatial properties of the population of interest observed by\nastronomical imaging. We present a software package $\\mathtt{ComEst}$, which\ncalculates the completeness of source detection on charge-coupled device (CCD)\nimages of astronomical observations, especially for the optical and\nnear-infrared (NIR) imaging of galaxies and point sources. The completeness\nestimator $\\mathtt{ComEst}$ is designed for the source finder\n$\\mathtt{SExtractor}$ used on the CCD images saved in the Flexible Image\nTransport System (FITS) format. Specifically, $\\mathtt{ComEst}$ estimates the\ncompleteness of the source detection by deriving the detection rate of\nsynthetic point sources and galaxies simulated on the observed CCD images. In\norder to capture any observational artifacts or noise properties while deriving\nthe completeness, $\\mathtt{ComEst}$ directly carries out the detection of\nsimulated sources on the observed images. Given an observed CCD image saved in\nFITS format, $\\mathtt{ComEst}$ derives the completeness of the source detection\nfrom end to end as a function of source flux (or magnitude) and CCD position.\nIn addition, $\\mathtt{ComEst}$ can also estimate the purity of the source\ndetection by comparing the catalog of the detected sources to the input\ncatalogs of the simulated sources. We run ComEst on the images from Blanco\nCosmology Survey (BCS) and compare the derived completeness as a function of\nmagnitude to the limiting magnitudes derived by using the Signal-to-Noise ratio\n(SNR) and number count histogram of the detected sources. $\\mathtt{ComEst}$ is\nreleased as a Python package with an easy-to-use syntax and is publicly\navailable at https://github.com/inonchiu/ComEst\n", "  We use $\\sim$83,000 star-forming galaxies at $0.04<z<0.3$ from the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey to study the so-called fundamental metallicity relation\n(FMR) and report on the disappearance of its anti-correlation between\nmetallicity and star formation rate (SFR) when using the new metallicity\nindicator recently proposed by Dopita et al. In this calibration, metallicity\nis primarily sensitive to the emission line ratio [NII]$\\lambda$6584 /\n[SII]$\\lambda\\lambda$6717, 6731 that is insensitive to dilution by pristine\ninfalling gas that may drive the FMR anti-correlation with SFR. Therefore, we\nconclude that the apparent disappearance of the FMR (using this new metallicity\nindicator) does not rule out its existence.\n", "  Linear wave solutions to the Charney-Hasegawa-Mima partial differential\nequation with periodic boundary conditions have two physical interpretations:\nRossby (atmospheric) waves, and drift (plasma) waves in a tokamak. These waves\ndisplay resonance in triads. In the case of infinite Rossby deformation radius,\nthe set of resonant triads may be described as the set of integer solutions to\na particular homogeneous Diophantine equation, or as the set of rational points\non a projective surface. We give a rational parametrization of the smooth\npoints on this surface, answering the question: What are all resonant triads?\nWe also give a fiberwise description, yielding a procedure to answer the\nquestion: For fixed $r \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, what are all wavevectors $(x,y)$ that\nresonate with a wavevector $(a,b)$ with $a/b = r$?\n", "  Analytical expressions of the wave functions are derived for a Bohr\nHamiltonian with the Manning{Rosen potential in the cases of {\\gamma}-unstable\nnuclei and axially symmetric prolate deformed ones with {\\gamma}=0. By\nexploiting the results we have obtained in a recent work on the same theme Ref.\n[1], we have calculated the B(E2) transition rates for 34 {\\gamma}-unstable and\n38 rotational nuclei and compared to experimental data, revealing a qualitative\nagreement with the experiment and phase transitions within the ground state\nband and showing also that the Manning-Rosen potential is more appropriate for\nsuch calculations than other potentials.\n", "  An essential element in the web-trap architecture, the capture silk spun by\necribellate orb spiders consists of glue droplets sitting astride a silk\nfilament. Mechanically this thread presents a mixed solid-liquid behavior\nunknown to date. Under extension, capture silk behaves as a particularly\nstretchy solid, owing to its molecular nanosprings, but it totally switches\nbehavior in compression to now become liquid-like: It shrinks with no apparent\nlimit while exerting a constant tension. Here, we unravel the physics\nunderpinning the unique behavior of this \"liquid wire\" and demonstrate that its\nmechanical response originates in the shape-switching of the silk filament\ninduced by buckling within the droplets. Learning from this natural example of\ngeometry and mechanics, we manufactured programmable liquid wires that present\npreviously unidentified pathways for the design of new hybrid solid-liquid\nmaterials. This article is available in open access with supplementary\nmaterials on the PNAS website.\n", "  We present first lattice QCD results for semileptonic form factors for the\ndecays $B_c \\to \\eta_c l \\nu$ and $B_c \\to J/\\psi l \\nu$ over the full $q^2$\nrange, using both improved non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) and fully relativistic\n(HISQ) formalisms. These can be viewed as prototype calculations for\npseudoscalar to pseudoscalar and pseudoscalar to vector decays involving a $b\n\\to c$ transition. In particular we can use information from the relativistic\ncomputations to fix the NRQCD current normalisations, which can then be used in\nimproved computations of decays such as $B \\to D l \\nu$ and $B \\to D^* l \\nu$.\n", "  I review some selected aspects of the phenomenology of multiquark states\ndiscovered in high energy experiments. They have four valence quarks (called\ntetraquarks) and two of them are found to have five valence quarks (called\npentaquarks), extending the conventional hadron spectrum which consists of\nquark-antiquark $(q\\bar{q})$ mesons and $qqq$ baryons. Multiquark states\nrepresent a new facet of QCD and their dynamics is both challenging and\ncurrently poorly understood. I discuss various approaches put forward to\naccommodate them, with emphasis on the diquark model.\n", "  I provide analytical or semi-analytical expressions for the small-angle\nscattering of colloidal objects that can be described as curved plates. These\nmodels could help characterize a variety of inorganic or biological systems.\n", "  Multidimensional NMR inversion using Kronecker products poses several\nchallenges. First, kernel compression is only possible when the kernel matrices\nare separable, and in recent years, there has been an increasing interest in\nNMR sequences with non-separable kernels. Second, in three or more dimensions,\nthe singular value decomposition is not unique; therefore kernel compression is\nnot well-defined for higher dimensions. Without kernel compression, the\nKronecker product yields matrices that require large amounts of memory, making\nthe inversion intractable for personal computers. Finally, incorporating\narbitrary regularization terms is not possible using the Lawson-Hanson (LH) or\nthe Butler-Reeds-Dawson (BRD) algorithms. We develop a minimization-based\ninversion method that circumvents the above problems by using multilinear forms\nto perform multidimensional NMR inversion without using kernel compression or\nKronecker products. The new method is memory efficient, requiring less than\n0.1% of the memory required by the LH or BRD methods. It can also be extended\nto arbitrary dimensions and adapted to include non-separable kernels, linear\nconstraints, and arbitrary regularization terms. Additionally, it is easy to\nimplement because only a cost function and its first derivative are required to\nperform the inversion.\n", "  Exotic manipulation of the flow of photons in nanoengineered semiconductor\nmaterials with an aperiodic distribution of nanostructures plays a key role in\nefficiency-enhanced and industrially viable broadband photonic technologies.\nThrough a generic deterministic nanotechnological route, in addition to\nperiodic, transversely quasicrystallographic or disordered random photonic\nlattices, here we show scalable nanostructured semiconductor thin films on\nlarge area nanoimprinted substrates up to 4cm^2 with advanced functional\nfeatures of aperiodic composite nanophotonic lattices having tailorable\nsupercell tiles. The richer Fourier spectra of the presented artificially\nnanostructured materials with well-defined lattice point morphologies are\ndesigned functionally akin to two-dimensional incommensurate intergrowth\naperiodic lattices-comprising periodic photonic crystals and in-plane\nquasicrystals as subgroups. The composite photonic lattice-structured\ncrystalline silicon thin films with tapered nanoholes or nanocone-nanoholes are\npresented showing up to +30 % achievable short circuit current density in\ncomparison to a periodic counterpart where as it is up to +190 % in comparison\nto a reference unstructured silicon thin film of 300 nanometers of thickness.\nIn view of scalable bottom-up integrated device fabrication processes, the\nstructural analysis is further extended to liquid phase crystallized\ndouble-side-textured deterministic aperiodic lattice-structured 10 micrometers\nthick large area crystalline silicon film.\n", "  Substrate-based cell motility is essential for fundamental biological\nprocesses, such as tissue growth, wound healing and immune response. Even if a\ncomprehensive understanding of this motility mode remains elusive, progress has\nbeen achieved in its modeling using a whole cell physical model. The model\ntakes into account the main mechanisms of cell motility - actin polymerization,\nsubstrate mediated adhesion and actin-myosin dynamics and combines it with\nsteric cell-cell and hydrodynamic interactions. The model predicts the onset of\ncollective cell migration, which emerges spontaneously as a result of inelastic\ncollisions of neighboring cells. Each cell here modeled as an active polar gel,\nis accomplished with two vortices if it moves. Open collision of two cells the\ntwo vortices which come close to each other annihilate. This leads to a\nrotation of the cells and together with the deformation and the reorientation\nof the actin filaments in each cell induces alignment of these cells and leads\nto persistent translational collective migration. The effect for low Reynolds\nnumbers is as strong as in the non-hydrodynamic model, but it decreases with\nincreasing Reynolds number.\n", "  The higher manganese silicides (HMS), with the chemical formula MnSi$_x$($x\n\\approx 1.73 - 1.75$), have been attracted a lot of attention due to their\npotential application as thermoelectric materials. While the electronic band\nstructures of HMS have been previously studied using first principle\ncalculations, the relation between crystal structures of Mn and Si atoms and\ntheir band structures is not well understood. Here we study Mn$_4$Si$_7$ using\nfirst principle calculations and show that a half cell consisting of five Mn\natoms is the essential building block for Mn$_4$Si$_7$. Using this insight, we\nconstruct a minimal tight-binding model for Mn$_4$Si$_7$ and other HMS\nincluding Mn$_{11}$Si$_{19}$ and Mn$_{15}$Si$_{26}$. The role played by the Si\natoms and possible ways to achieve higher figure of merit are also discussed.\n", "  Sunspots on the surface of the Sun are the observational signatures of\nintense manifestations of tightly packed magnetic field lines, with\nnear-vertical field strengths exceeding 6,000 G in extreme cases. It is well\naccepted that both the plasma density and the magnitude of the magnetic field\nstrength decrease rapidly away from the solar surface, making high-cadence\ncoronal measurements through traditional Zeeman and Hanle effects difficult\nsince the observational signatures are fraught with low-amplitude signals that\ncan become swamped with instrumental noise. Magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD)\ntechniques have previously been applied to coronal structures, with single and\nspatially isolated magnetic field strengths estimated as 9-55 G. A drawback\nwith previous MHD approaches is that they rely on particular wave modes\nalongside the detectability of harmonic overtones. Here we show, for the first\ntime, how omnipresent magneto-acoustic waves, originating from within the\nunderlying sunspot and propagating radially outwards, allow the spatial\nvariation of the local coronal magnetic field to be mapped with high precision.\nWe find coronal magnetic field strengths of 32 +/- 5 G above the sunspot, which\ndecrease rapidly to values of approximately 1 G over a lateral distance of 7000\nkm, consistent with previous isolated and unresolved estimations. Our results\ndemonstrate a new, powerful technique that harnesses the omnipresent nature of\nsunspot oscillations to provide magnetic field mapping capabilities close to a\nmagnetic source in the solar corona.\n", "  Motivated by the physics of strings and branes, we introduce a general suite\nof Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) \"suburban samplers\" (i.e., spread out\nMetropolis). The suburban algorithm involves an ensemble of statistical agents\nconnected together by a random network. Performance of the collective in\nreaching a fast and accurate inference depends primarily on the average number\nof nearest neighbor connections. Increasing the average number of neighbors\nabove zero initially leads to an increase in performance, though there is a\ncritical connectivity with effective dimension d_eff ~ 1, above which\n\"groupthink\" takes over, and the performance of the sampler declines.\n", "  In this paper, we construct a generalized recursive Darboux transformation of\na focusing vector nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation known as the Manakov system.\nWe apply this generalized recursive Darboux transformation to the Lax-pairs of\nthis system in view of generating the Nth-order vector generalization rogue\nwave solutions with the same spectral parameter through a direct iteration\nrule. As a result, we discuss the first, second and third-order vector\ngeneralization rogue wave solutions while illustrating these features with some\ndepictions. We show that higher-order rogue wave solutions depend on the values\nof their free parameters.\n", "  We revisit the fidelity as a measure for the stability and the complexity of\nthe quantum motion of single and many-body systems. Within the context of cold\natoms, we present on overview of applications of two fidelities which we call\nstatic and dynamical fidelity, respectively. The static fidelity applies to\nquantum problems which can be diagonalized since it is defined via the\neigenfunctions. In particular, we show that the static fidelity is a highly\neffective practical detector of avoided crossings characterizing the complexity\nof the systems and their evolutions. The dynamical fidelity is defined via the\ntime-dependent wave functions. Focussing on the quantum kicked rotor system, we\nhighlight a few practical applications of fidelity measurements in order to\nbetter understand the large variety of dynamical regimes of this paradigm of a\nlow-dimensional system with mixed regular-chaotic phase space.\n", "  We have synthesized thermodynamically metastable Ca2IrO4 thin-films on YAlO3\n(110) substrates by pulsed laser deposition. The epitaxial Ca2IrO4 thin-films\nare of K2NiF4-type tetragonal structure. Transport and optical spectroscopy\nmeasurements indicate that the electronic structure of the Ca2IrO4 thin-films\nis similar to that of Jeff = 1/2 spin-orbit-coupled Mott insulator Sr2IrO4 and\nBa2IrO4, with the exception of an increased gap energy. The gap increase is to\nbe expected in Ca2IrO4 due to its increased octahedral rotation and tilting,\nwhich results in enhanced electron-correlation, U/W. Our results suggest that\nthe epitaxial stabilization growth of metastable-phase thin-films can be used\neffectively for investigating layered iridates and various complex-oxide\nsystems.\n", "  A 3-D inverse medium problem in the frequency domain is considered. Another\nname for this problem is Coefficient Inverse Problem. The goal is to\nreconstruct spatially distributed dielectric constants from scattering data.\nPotential applications are in detection and identification of explosive-like\ntargets. A single incident plane wave and multiple frequencies are used. A new\nnumerical method is proposed. A theorem is proved, which claims that a small\nneigborhood of the exact solution of that problem is reached by this method\nwithout any advanced knowledge of that neighborhood. We call this property of\nthat numerical method \"global convergence\". Results of numerical experiments\nfor the case of the backscattering data are presented.\n", "  Long lasting coherence in photosynthetic pigment-protein complexes has been\nobserved even at physiological temperatures. Experiments have demonstrated\nquantum coherent behaviour in the long-time operation of the D-Wave quantum\ncomputer as well. Quantum coherence is the common feature between the two\nphenomena. An explanations for eight orders of magnitude discrepancy between\nthe single flux qubit coherence time and the long-time quantum behaviour of an\narray of thousand flux qubits in the quantum computer was suggested within a\ntheory where the flux qubits are coupled to an environment of particles called\ngravonons of high density of states The coherent evolution is in high\ndimensional spacetime and can be understood as a solution of Schroedinger's\ntime-dependent equation.\n  Explanations for the quantum beats observed in 2D Fourier transform\nelectronic spectroscopy of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) protein complex in\nthe green sulfur bacteria are presently sought in constructing transport\ntheories based on quantum master equations where 'good' molecular vibrations\n('coloured noise') in the chlorophyll and the surrounding protein scaffold\nknock the exciton oscillations back into coherence. These 'good' vibrations are\nclaimed to have developed in three billion years of natural selection. These\ntheories, however, face the discomforting experimental observation that\n\"attempts to scramble vibrational modes or to shift resonances with isotopic\nsubstitution miserably failed to affect the beating signals\". As a possible way\nout of this dilemma we adopted the formalism of the quantum computation to the\nquantum beats in the FMO protein complex.\n", "  The exploration of properties of an extreme state of matter, the Quark--Gluon\nPlasma, has broken new ground with the recent Run 2 operation of the Large\nHadron Collider with heavy-ion collisions at the highest energy to date. With\nthe heavy-ion data taken at the end of 2015, the ALICE Collaboration has made\nthe first observation of anisotropic flow of charged particles and related\nphenomena in lead--lead collisions at the record breaking energy of 5.02 TeV\nper nucleon pair. The Run 2 results come after the proton-lead collisions,\nwhich provided a lot of unexpected results obtained with two- and\nmulti-particle correlation techniques. In these proceedings, a brief overview\nof these results will be shown. We will discuss how they further enlighten the\nproperties of matter produced in ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions. We\nindicate the possibility that, to leading order, the striking universality of\nflow results obtained with correlation techniques in pp, p--A and A--A\ncollisions might have purely mathematical origin, and that physical conclusions\ntherefore could be drawn only from the subleading orders.\n", "  Algorithms for detecting clusters (including overlapping clusters) in graphs\nhave received significant attention in the research community. A closely\nrelated important aspect of the problem -- quantification of statistical\nsignificance of overlap of clusters, remains relatively unexplored. This paper\npresents the first theoretical and practical results on quantifying\nstatistically significant interactions between clusters in networks. Such\nproblems commonly arise in diverse applications, ranging from social network\nanalysis to systems biology. The paper addresses the problem of quantifying the\nstatistical significance of the observed overlap of the two clusters in an\nErd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi graph model. The analytical framework presented in the paper\nassigns a $p$-value to overlapping subgraphs by combining information about\nboth the sizes of the subgraphs and their edge densities in comparison to the\ncorresponding values for their overlapping component. This $p$-value is\ndemonstrated to have excellent discrimination properties in real applications\nand is shown to be robust across broad parameter ranges.\n  Our results are comprehensively validated on synthetic, social, and\nbiological networks. We show that our framework: (i) derives insight from both\nthe density and the size of overlap among communities (circles/pathways), (ii)\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods over all tested datasets, and\n(iii) when compared to other measures, has much broader application scope. In\nthe context of social networks, we identify highly interdependent (social)\ncircles and show that our predictions are highly co-enriched with known user\nfeatures. In networks of biomolecular interactions, we show that our method\nidentifies novel cross-talk between pathways, sheds light on their mechanisms\nof interaction, and provides new opportunities for investigations of\nbiomolecular interactions.\n", "  Design of large composite structures requires understanding the scaling of\ntheir mechanical properties, an aspect often overlooked in the literature on\ncomposites. This contribution analyzes, experimentally and numerically, the\nintra-laminar size effect of textile composite structures. Test results of\ngeometrically similar Single Edge Notched specimens made of 8 layers of 0\ndegree epoxy/carbon twill 2 by 2 laminates are reported. Results show that the\nnominal strength decreases with increasing specimen size and that the\nexperimental data can be fitted well by Bazant's size effect law, allowing an\naccurate identification of the intra-laminar fracture energy of the material.\nThe importance of an accurate estimation of Gf in situations where\nintra-laminar fracturing is the main energy dissipation mechanism is clarified\nby studying numerically its effect on crashworthiness of composite tubes.\nSimulations demonstrate that, for the analyzed geometry, a decrease of the\nfracture energy to 50% of the measured value corresponds to an almost 42%\ndecrease in plateau crushing load. Further, assuming a vertical stress drop\nafter the peak, a typical assumption of strength-based constitutive laws\nimplemented in most commercial Finite Element codes, results in an strength\nunderestimation of the order of 70%. The main conclusion of this study is that\nmeasuring accurately fracture energy and modeling correctly the fracturing\nbehavior of textile composites, including their quasi-brittleness, is key. This\ncan be accomplished neither by strength- or strain-based approaches, which\nneglect size effect, nor by LEFM which does not account for the finiteness of\nthe Fracture Process Zone.\n", "  This paper deals with the formulation, calibration, and validation of a\nLattice Discrete Particle Model (LDPM) for the simulation of the\npressure-dependent inelastic response of granular rocks. LDPM is formulated in\nthe framework of discrete mechanics and it simulates the heterogeneous\ndeformation of cemented granular systems by means of discrete\ncompatibility/equilibrium equations defined at the grain scale. A numerical\nstrategy is proposed to generate a realistic microstructure based on the actual\ngrain size distribution of a sandstone and the capabilities of the method are\nillustrated with reference to the particular case of Bleurswiller sandstone,\ni.e. a granular rock that has been extensively studied at the laboratory scale.\nLDPM micromechanical parameters are calibrated based on evidences from triaxial\nexperiments, such as hydrostatic compression, brittle failure at low\nconfinement and plastic behavior at high confinement. Results show that LDPM\nallows exploring the effect of fine-scale heterogeneity on the inelastic\nresponse of rock cores, achieving excellent quantitative performance across a\nwide range of stress conditions. In addition, LDPM simulations demonstrate its\ncapability of capturing different modes of strain localization within a unified\nmechanical framework, which makes this approach applicable for a wide variety\nof geomechanical settings. Such promising performance suggests that LDPM may\nconstitute a viable alternative to existing discrete numerical methods for\ngranular rocks, as well as a versatile tool for the interpretation of their\ncomplex deformation/failure patterns and for the development of continuum\nmodels capturing the effect of micro-scale heterogeneity.\n", "  Here, we report on the experimental discovery of biskyrmion magnetic\nnanodomains at RT and the observation of a biskyrmion-derived topological Hall\neffect (THE) in the centrosymmetric hexagonal MnNiGa magnet. Using a phase\nreconstruction technique based on a transport-of-intensity equation (TIE), we\nestablished the texture of the biskyrmion spin. Results from Lorentz\ntransmission electron microscopy (TEM) and the topological Hall effect revealed\nthat the biskyrmion phase is stable over a much wider temperature range (100 K\nto ~340K) and a larger magnetic field range in our material than in\nskyrmion-hosting bulk crystals reported previously[1-3,6]. The super-wide\noperating temperature and the broad range of material options indicate\nimportant progress toward the realization of skyrmion-based spintronic devices.\n", "  Complex systems are usually illustrated by networks which captures the\ntopology of the interactions between the entities. To better understand the\nroles played by the entities in the system one needs to uncover the underlying\ncommunity structure of the system. In recent years, systems with interactions\nthat have various types or can change over time between the entities have\nattracted an increasing research attention. However, algorithms aiming to solve\nthe key problem - community detection - in multilayer networks are still\nlimited. In this work, we first introduce the multilayer network model\nrepresentation with multiple aspects, which is flexible to a variety of\nnetworks. Then based on this model, we naturally derive the multilayer\nmodularity - a widely adopted objective function of community detection in\nnetworks - from a static perspective as an evaluation metric to evaluate the\nquality of the communities detected in multilayer networks. It enables us to\nbetter understand the essence of the modularity by pointing out the specific\nkind of communities that will lead to a high modularity score. We also propose\na spectral method called mSpec for the optimization of the proposed modularity\nfunction based on the supra-adjacency representation of the multilayer\nnetworks. Experiments on the electroencephalograph network and the comparison\nresults on several empirical multilayer networks demonstrate the feasibility\nand reliable performance of the proposed method.\n", "  A helioseismic statistical waveform analysis of subsurface flow was performed\non two 720-day time series of SOHO/MDI Medium-l spherical-harmonic\ncoefficients. The time series coincide with epochs of high and low solar\nactivity. Time-dependent coupling-strength coefficients b(s,t;n,l) of modes of\nthe same radial order n and degree l, but different azimuthal order m, were\ninferred from the waveform analysis. These coefficients are sensitive to flows\nand general aspherical structure. For odd values of s << l, the coefficient\nb(s,t;n,l) measures an average over depth of the amplitude of one\nspherical-harmonic (s,t) component of the toroidal flow velocity field. The\ndepth-dependent weighting function defining the average velocity is the\nfractional kinetic energy density in radius of modes of the (n,l) multiplet. A\nmean-square (n,l)-dependent flow velocity was inferred from the b-coefficients\nfor s in the range 5 through 35 for each n and l in the respective ranges 1\nthrough 5 and 120 through 149 for the epochs of high and low activity. A\nfurther averaging, over l, yielded a root mean square flow velocity as a\nfunction of n for each epoch, which average increases from about 20 m/s at n=1\nto 35 m/s at n=5. The inferred velocities are consistent with (though perhaps\ndo not demand) a cellular pattern of flow extending over the vertical range of\nmode sensitivity, estimated to be about four percent of the solar radius below\nthe photosphere.\n", "  We study the motion and equilibria of the grains on the surface of the\nirregular celestial body (hereafter called irregular bodies). Motions for the\ngrains on the smooth and unsmooth surfaces are discussed, respectively. The\nlinearized equations of motion relative to a surface equilibrium point and its\ncharacteristic equations are presented. Considering the stick-slip effect, the\ndamping forces and the spring forces for the grain are calculated, then the\nlinearized equations of motion and the characteristic equations relative to the\nsurface equilibrium points are derived. The number of non-degenerate surface\nequilibria is an even number. We compute the motion of a grain released above\nthree different regions relative to the irregular asteroid 6489 Golevka,\nincluding the flat surface, the concave region, and the convex region.\nFollowing the grain release and initial bounce, three kinds of motions exist,\nthe orbital motion, the impact motion and the surface motion. We find that the\nmaximum height of the next hop may be bigger than the maximum height of the\ncurrent hopping. We also used Monte Carlo simulations to calculate 100 grains\nhopping motions, the results shows that the stable surface equilibria are on\nthe concave region and flat surface of the asteroid.\n", "  We explore how the stability and buckling behavior of a flexible but\ninextensible loop spanned by a liquid film in a flat circular configuration is\ninfluenced by the intrinsic shape of the fiber from which the loop is made.\n", "  Large telescope's adaptive optics (AO) system requires one or several bright\nartificial laser guide stars to improve its sky coverage. The recent advent of\nhigh power sodium laser is perfect for such application. However, besides the\noutput power, other parameters of the laser also have significant impact on the\nbrightness of the generated sodium laser guide star mostly in non-linear\nrelationships. When tuning and optimizing these parameters it is necessary to\ntune based on a laser guide star generation performance metric. Although return\nphoton flux is widely used, variability of atmosphere and sodium layer make it\ndifficult to compare from site to site even within short time period for the\nsame site. A new metric, coupling efficiency is adopted in our field tests. In\nthis paper, we will introduce our method for measuring the coupling efficiency\nof a 20W class pulse sodium laser for AO application during field tests that\nwere conducted during 2013-2015.\n", "  Artificial ices enable the study of geometrical frustration by design and\nthrough direct observation. However, it has proven difficult to achieve\ntailored long-range ordering of their diverse configurations, limiting both\nfundamental and applied research directions. We designed an artificial spin\nstructure that produces a magnetic charge ice with tunable long-range ordering\nof eight different configurations. We also developed a technique to precisely\nmanipulate the local magnetic charge states and demonstrate write-read-erase\nmultifunctionality at room temperature. This globally reconfigurable and\nlocally writable magnetic charge ice could provide a setting for designing\nmagnetic monopole defects, tailoring magnonics, and controlling the properties\nof other two-dimensional materials.\n", "  Helicity amplitudes are the fundamental ingredients of many QCD calculations\nfor multi-leg processes. We describe how these can seamlessly be combined with\nresummation in Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET), by constructing a\nhelicity operator basis for which the Wilson coefficients are directly given in\nterms of color-ordered helicity amplitudes. This basis is crossing symmetric\nand has simple transformation properties under discrete symmetries.\n", "  Lack of materials which are thermoelectrically efficient and economically\nattractive is a challenge in thermoelectricity. Silicon could be a good\nthermoelectric material offering CMOS compatibility, harmlessness and cost\nreduction but it features a too high thermal conductivity. High harvested power\ndensity of 7W/cm2 at deltaT=30K is modeled based on a thin-film lateral\narchitecture of thermo-converter that takes advantage of confinement effects to\nreduce the thermal conductivity. The simulation leads to the conclusion that\n10nm thick Silicon has 10 times higher efficiency than bulk.\n", "  Patterns often appear in a variety of large, real-world networks, and\ninteresting physical phenomena are often explained by network topology as in\nthe case of the bow-tie structure of the World Wide Web, or the small world\nphenomenon in social networks. The discovery and modelling of such regular\npatterns has a wide application from disease propagation to financial markets.\nIn this work we describe a newly discovered regularly occurring striation\npattern found in the PageRank ordering of adjacency matrices that encode\nreal-world networks. We demonstrate that these striations are the result of\nwell-known graph generation processes resulting in regularities that are\nmanifest in the typical neighborhood distribution. The spectral view explored\nin this paper encodes a tremendous amount about the explicit and implicit\ntopology of a given network, so we also discuss the interesting network\nproperties, outliers and anomalies that a viewer can determine from a brief\nlook at the re-ordered matrix.\n", "  In the last decade, using single epoch virial based techniques in the optical\nband, it has been possible to measure the central black hole mass on large AGN1\nsamples. However these measurements use the width of the broad line region as a\nproxy of the virial velocities and are therefore difficult to be carried out on\nthose obscured (type 2) or low luminosity AGN where the nuclear component does\nnot dominate in the optical. Here we present the optical and near infrared\nspectrum of the starburst/Seyfert galaxy NGC 6221, observed with X-shooter/VLT.\nPrevious observations of NGC 6221 in the X-ray band show an absorbed (N_H=8.5\n+/- 0.4 x 10^21 cm^-2) spectrum typical of a type 2 AGN with luminosity\nlog(L_14-195 keV) = 42.05 erg/s, while in the optical band its spectrum is\ntypical of a reddened (A_V=3) starburst. Our deep X-shooter/VLT observations\nhave allowed us to detect faint broad emission in the H_alpha, HeI and Pa_beta\nlines (FWHM ~1400-2300 km/s) confirming previous studies indicating that NGC\n6221 is a reddened starburst galaxy which hosts an AGN. We use the measure of\nthe broad components to provide a first estimate of its central black hole mass\n(M_BH = 10^(6.6 +/- 0.3) Msol, lambda_Edd=0.01-0.03), obtained using recently\ncalibrated virial relations suitable for moderately obscured (N_H<10^24 cm^-2)\nAGN.\n", "  An axiomatic approach to the mathematical models of the isotropic cosmology.\n", "  The first purpose of this paper is to show a method of constructing a regular\nbiorthogonal pair based on the commutation rule: $ab-ba=I$ for a pair of\noperators $a$ and $b$ acting on a Hilbert space ${\\cal H}$ with inner product\n$( \\cdot | \\cdot )$. Here, sequences $\\{ \\phi_{n} \\}$ and $\\{ \\psi_{n} \\}$ in a\nHilbert space ${\\cal H}$ are biorthogonal if $( \\phi_{n} | \\psi_{m})=\n\\delta_{nm}$, $n,m=0,1, \\cdots$, and they are regular if both $D_{\\phi} \\equiv\nSpan \\{ \\phi_{n} \\}$ and $D_{\\psi} \\equiv Span \\{ \\psi_{n} \\}$ are dense in\n${\\cal H}$. Indeed, the assumption to construct the regular biorthogonal pair\ncoincide with the definition of pseudo-bosons as originally given in Ref\n\\cite{bagarello10}. Furthermore, we study the connections between the\npseudo-bosonic operators $a, \\; b, \\; a^{\\dagger}, \\; b^{\\dagger}$ and the\npseudo-bosonic operators defined by a regular biorthogonal pair $(\\{ \\phi_{n}\n\\}$, $\\{ \\psi_{n} \\} )$ and an ONB $\\mbox{ $e$}$ of ${\\cal H}$ in appeared Ref\n\\cite{hiroshi1}. The second purpose is to define and study the notion of ${\\cal\nD}$-pseudo bosons in Ref \\cite{bagarello13, bagarello2013} and give a method of\nconstructing ${\\cal D}$-pseudo bosons on some steps. Then it is shown that for\nany ONB $\\mbox{ $e$}= \\{ e_{n} \\}$ in ${\\cal H}$ and any operators $T$ and\n$T^{-1}$ in ${\\cal L}^{\\dagger} ( {\\cal D})$, we may construct operators $A$\nand $B$ satisfying ${\\cal D}$-pseudo bosons, where ${\\cal D}$ is a dense\nsubspace in a Hilbert space ${\\cal H}$ and ${\\cal L}^{\\dagger} ( {\\cal D})$ the\nset of all linear operators $T$ from ${\\cal D}$ to ${\\cal D}$ such that\n$T^{\\ast} {\\cal D} \\subset {\\cal D}$, where $T^{\\ast}$ is the adjoint of $T$.\nFinally, we give some physical examples of ${\\cal D}$-pseudo bosons based on\nstandard bosons by the method of constructing ${\\cal D}$-pseudo bosons stated\nabove.\n", "  Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) need imaging optics with\nlarge apertures and high image intensities to map the faint Cherenkov light\nemitted from cosmic ray air showers onto their image sensors. Segmented\nreflectors fulfill these needs, and as they are composed from mass production\nmirror facets they are inexpensive and lightweight. However, as the overall\nimage is a superposition of the individual facet images, alignment is a\nchallenge. Here we present a computer vision based star tracking alignment\nmethod, which also works for limited or changing star light visibility. Our\nmethod normalizes the mirror facet reflection intensities to become independent\nof the reference star's intensity or the cloud coverage. Using two CCD cameras,\nour method records the mirror facet orientations asynchronously of the\ntelescope drive system, and thus makes the method easy to integrate into\nexisting telescopes. It can be combined with remote facet actuation, but does\nnot require one to work. Furthermore, it can reconstruct all individual mirror\nfacet point spread functions without moving any mirror. We present alignment\nresults on the 4 meter First Geiger-mode Avalanche Cherenkov Telescope (FACT).\n", "  Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) need imaging optics with\nlarge apertures and high image intensities to map the faint Cherenkov light\nemitted from cosmic ray air showers onto their image sensors. Segmented\nreflectors fulfill these needs, and composed from mass production mirror facets\nthey are inexpensive and lightweight. However, as the overall image is a\nsuperposition of the individual facet images, alignment remains a challenge.\nHere we present a simple, yet extendable method, to align a segmented reflector\nusing its Bokeh. Bokeh alignment does not need a star or good weather nights\nbut can be done even during daytime. Bokeh alignment optimizes the facet\norientations by comparing the segmented reflectors Bokeh to a predefined\ntemplate. The optimal Bokeh template is highly constricted by the reflector's\naperture and is easy accessible. The Bokeh is observed using the out of focus\nimage of a near by point like light source in a distance of about 10 focal\nlengths. We introduce Bokeh alignment on segmented reflectors and demonstrate\nit on the First Geiger-mode Avalanche Cherenkov Telescope (FACT) on La Palma,\nSpain.\n", "  We discuss a unified mesoscale framework for the simulation of complex states\nof flowing matter across scales of motion which requires no explicit coupling\nbetween different macro-meso-micro levels. The idea is illustrated through\nselected examples of complex flows at the micro and nanoscale.\n", "  We consider $O(N)$ $g\\varphi^4$ theory with the coupling $g$ being large, and\ncalculate shear viscosity to entropy density ratio ($\\eta/s$). The final result\nfor $\\eta/s$ has a form remarkably similar to that obtained from string theory\ncalculations via the AdS/CFT conjecture. The method adopted can be used to\ncompute quantities of interest in other theories as well with some\nmodifications and reveals some very interesting features within the considered\ntheory.\n", "  Nonlinear vibrations in strained monoatomic carbon chains are studied with\nthe aid of ab initio methods based on the density functional theory. An\nunexpected phenomenon of structural transformation at the atomic level above a\ncertain value of the strain was revealed in cumulene chain (carbyne-{\\beta}).\nThis phenomenon is a consequence of stability loss of the old equilibrium\natomic positions that occur at small strain, and appearance of two new stable\nequilibrium positions near each of them. The aforementioned restructuring gives\nrise to a softening of {\\pi}-mode whose frequency tends to zero in a certain\nregion of amplitudes when carbon atoms begin to vibrate near new equilibrium\npositions. This resembles the concept of soft mode whose \"freezing\" is\npostulated in the theory of phase transitions in crystals to explain the\ntransitions of displacement type. The dynamical modeling of mass point chains\nwhose particles interact via Lennard-Jones potential can approximate our ab\ninitio results well enough. In particular, this study demonstrates an essential\nrole of dipole-dipole interactions between carbon atoms in formation of their\nnew equilibrium positions in the cumulene chain. We believe that computer\nstudying of Lennard-Jones chains enables to predict properties of various\ndynamical objects in carbon chains (different nonlinear normal modes and their\nbushes, discrete breathers etc.) which then can be verified by ab initio\nmethods.\n", "  I examine the $G^2$-approximation of Schwarzschild solution from the\nviewpoint of theory of sources. The method suggests the following definition of\nthe privileged coordinate system: it is a system in which in each approximation\nthe gauge degrees of freedom are put to zero, i.e. the metric is formed solely\nby sources. I calculate the metric in this system. In $G^2$-approximation the\nexterior metric has the term which is of the form of a gauge function.\nConsidering it as such I have the agreement with Schwarzschild metric. But I\ncannot consider it as a gauge function because it is generated by sources. It\nshould be observable. It is proportional to the radius of matter ball and seems\nviolate the Birckhoff theorem.\n", "  In the present paper, we are analyzing the $k=-1-$FRW Universe with two\ninteracting ideal fluids. The energy densities and the pressures are used to\nderive the corresponding Equations of State. For a particular form of the\ninteraction term between the two fluids, it turns out that the Universe is\nfilled with a mixture of dust and radiation.\n", "  A class of dynamic threshold models is proposed, for describing the upset of\ncollective actions in social networks. The agents of the network have to decide\nwhether to undertake a certain action or not. They make their decision by\ncomparing the activity level of their neighbors with a time-varying threshold,\nevolving according to a time-invariant opinion dynamic model. Key features of\nthe model are a parameter representing the degree of self-confidence of the\nagents, and the mechanism adopted by the agents to evaluate the activity level\nof their neighbors. The case in which a radical agent, initially eager to\nundertake the action, interacts with a group of ordinary agents, is considered.\nThe main contribution of the paper is the complete analytic characterization of\nthe asymptotic behaviors of the network, for three different graph topologies.\nThe asymptotic activity patterns are determined as a function of the\nself-confidence parameter and of the initial threshold of the ordinary agents.\n", "  Recently, social phenomena have received a lot of attention not only from\nsocial scientists, but also from physicists, mathematicians and computer\nscientists, in the emerging interdisciplinary field of complex system science.\nOpinion dynamics is one of the processes studied, since opinions are the\ndrivers of human behaviour, and play a crucial role in many global challenges\nthat our complex world and societies are facing: global financial crises,\nglobal pandemics, growth of cities, urbanisation and migration patterns, and\nlast but not least important, climate change and environmental sustainability\nand protection. Opinion formation is a complex process affected by the\ninterplay of different elements, including the individual predisposition, the\ninfluence of positive and negative peer interaction (social networks playing a\ncrucial role in this respect), the information each individual is exposed to,\nand many others. Several models inspired from those in use in physics have been\ndeveloped to encompass many of these elements, and to allow for the\nidentification of the mechanisms involved in the opinion formation process and\nthe understanding of their role, with the practical aim of simulating opinion\nformation and spreading under various conditions. These modelling schemes range\nfrom binary simple models such as the voter model, to multi-dimensional\ncontinuous approaches. Here, we provide a review of recent methods, focusing on\nmodels employing both peer interaction and external information, and\nemphasising the role that less studied mechanisms, such as disagreement, has in\ndriving the opinion dynamics. [...]\n", "  Nonlinear Fourier division Multiplexing (NFDM) can be realized from\nmodulating the discrete nonlinear spectrum of an $N$-solitary waveform. To\ngenerate an $N$-solitary waveform from desired discrete spectrum (eigenvalue\nand discrete spectral amplitudes), we use the Darboux Transform. We explain how\nto the norming factors must be set in order to have the desired discrete\nspectrum. To derive these norming factors, we study the evolution of nonlinear\nspectrum by adding a new eigenvalue and its spectral amplitude. We further\nsimplify the Darboux transform algorithm.\n  We propose a novel algorithm (to the best of our knowledge) to numerically\ncompute the nonlinear Fourier Transform (NFT) of a given pulse. The NFT\nalgorithm, called forward-backward method, is based on splitting the signal\ninto two parts and computing the nonlinear spectrum of each part from boundary\n($\\pm\\infty$) inward. The nonlinear spectrum (discrete and continuous) derived\nfrom efficiently combining both parts has a promising numerical precision. This\nmethod can use any of one-step discretization NFT methods, e.g. Crank-Nicolson,\nas an NFT kernel for the forward or backward part. Using trapezoid rule of\nintegral, we use an NFT kernel (we called here Trapezoid discretization NFT) in\nforward-backward method which results discrete spectral amplitudes with a very\ngood numerical precision.\n  These algorithms, forward-backward method and Darboux transform, are used in\n[1],[2] for design and detection of phase-modulated 2-soliton pulses, and more\nrecently, in [3] for design and detection of more complex pulses with 7\neigenvalues and modulation of spectral phase. For those soliton pulses, the\ndiscrete spectral amplitudes (in particular, phase) of both eigenvalues are\nquite precisely estimated using the forward-backward method.\n", "  Molecular valves are becoming popular for potential biomedical applications.\nHowever, little is known concerning their performance in energy and\nenvironmental areas. Zeolite RHO shows unique pore deformations upon changes in\nhydration, cation siting, cation type, or temperature-pressure conditions. By\nvarying the level of distortion of double eight-rings, it is possible to\ncontrol the adsorption properties, which confer a molecular valve behavior to\nthis material. We have employed interatomic potentials-based simulations to\nobtain a detailed atomistic view of the structural distortion mechanisms of\nzeolite RHO, in contrast with the averaged and space group restricted\ninformation provided by diffraction studies. We have modeled four\naluminosilicate structures, containing Li$^+$, Na$^+$, K$^+$, Ca$^{2+}$, and\nSr$^{2+}$ cations. The distortions of the three different zeolite rings are\ncoupled, and the six- and eight-membered rings are largely flexible. A large\ndependence on the polarizing power of the extra-framework cations and with the\nloading of water has been found for the minimum aperture of the eight-membered\nrings that control the nanovalve effect. The calculated energy barriers for\nmoving the cations across the eight-membered rings are very high, which\nexplains the experimentally observed slow kinetics of the phase transition as\nwell as the appearance of metastable phases.\n", "  Mean-motion resonances play an important role in the evolution of various\nmeteoroid streams. Previous works have studied the effects of two-body\nresonances in different comets and streams. These already established two-body\nresonances were mainly induced either by Jovian or Saturnian effects but not\nboth at the same time. Some of these resonances have led to spectacular meteor\noutbursts and storms in the past. In this work, we find a new resonance\nmechanism involving three bodies -- i.e. meteoroid particle, Jupiter and\nSaturn, in the Perseid meteoroid stream. Long-term three-body resonances are\nnot very common in real small bodies in our solar system although they can\nmathematically exist at many resonant sweet spots in an abstract sense in any\ndynamical system. This particular resonance combination in the Perseid stream\nis such that it is close to the ratio of 1:4:10 if the orbital periods of\nPerseid particle, Saturn and Jupiter are considered respectively. These\nresonant Perseid meteoroids stay resonant for typically about 2 kyr. Highly\ncompact dust trails due to this unique resonance phenomenon are present in our\nsimulations. Some past and future years are presented where three-body resonant\nmeteoroids of different sizes (or subject to different radiation pressures) are\ncomputed to come near the Earth. This is the first theoretical example of an\nactive and stable three-body resonance mechanism in the realm of meteoroid\nstreams.\n", "  We generate high-order harmonics of a mid-infrared laser from a silicon\nsingle crystal and find their origin in the recollision of coherently\naccelerated electrons with their holes, analogously to the atomic and molecular\ncase, and to ZnO [Vampa et al., Nature 522, 462-464 (2015)], a direct bandgap\nmaterial. Therefore indirect bandgap materials are shown to sustain the\nrecollision process as well as direct bandgap materials. Furthermore, we find\nthat the generation is perturbed with electric fields as low as 30 V/$\\mu$m,\nequal to the DC damage threshold. Our results extend high-harmonic spectroscopy\nto the most technologically relevant material, and open the possibility to\nintegrate high harmonics with conventional electronics.\n", "  We report physical and structural properties of single-crystal Ca2Ru1-xFexO4\n(0<x<0.20) as functions of temperature, magnetic field and pressure. Ca2RuO4 is\na structurally-driven Mott insulator with a metal-insulator (MI) transition at\nTMI = 357 K, which is well separated from antiferromagnetic order at TN = 110\nK. Fe substitution for Ru in Ca2RuO4 causes a pronounced magnetization reversal\nand giant negative volume thermal expansion (NVTE). The magnetization reversal\nis a result of a field-induced antiferromagnetic coupling between the Ru- and\nFe-magnetic sublattices that have different temperature dependence. The NVTE is\nclosely associated with the orthorhombic distortion, and becomes smaller as the\northorhombicity weakens due to either Fe doping or application of pressure. The\nstudy highlights an intriguing interplay between lattice, orbital and spin\ndegrees of freedom that is at the root of the novel phenomena in Ca2RuO4.\n", "  A direct detection of primordial gravitational waves is the ultimate probe\nfor any inflation model. While current CMB bounds predict the generic\nscale-invariant gravitational wave spectrum from slow-roll inflation to be\nbelow the reach of upcoming gravitational wave interferometers, this prospect\nmay dramatically change if the inflaton is a pseudoscalar. In this case, a\ncoupling to any abelian gauge field leads to a tachyonic instability for the\nlatter and hence to a new source of gravitational waves, directly related to\nthe dynamics of inflation. In this contribution we discuss how this setup\nenables the upcoming gravitational wave interferometers advanced LIGO/VIRGO and\neLISA to probe the microphysics of inflation, distinguishing between different\nuniversality classes of single-field slow-roll inflation models. We find that\nthe prime candidate for an early detection is a Starobinsky-like model.\n", "  Lurking is a complex user-behavioral phenomenon that occurs in all\nlarge-scale online communities and social networks. It generally refers to the\nbehavior characterizing users that benefit from the information produced by\nothers in the community without actively contributing back to the production of\nsocial content. The amount and evolution of lurkers may strongly affect an\nonline social environment, therefore understanding the lurking dynamics and\nidentifying strategies to curb this trend are relevant problems. In this\nregard, we introduce the Lurker Game, i.e., a model for analyzing the\ntransitions from a lurking to a non-lurking (i.e., active) user role, and vice\nversa, in terms of evolutionary game theory. We evaluate the proposed Lurker\nGame by arranging agents on complex networks and analyzing the system\nevolution, seeking relations between the network topology and the final\nequilibrium of the game. Results suggest that the Lurker Game is suitable to\nmodel the lurking dynamics, showing how the adoption of rewarding mechanisms\ncombined with the modeling of hypothetical heterogeneity of users' interests\nmay lead users in an online community towards a cooperative behavior.\n", "  Electron-phonon coupling in hexagonal and cubic water ice is studied using\nfirst-principles quantum mechanical methods. We consider 29 distinct hexagonal\nand cubic ice proton-orderings with up to 192 molecules in the simulation cell\nto account for proton-disorder. We find quantum zero-point vibrational\ncorrections to the minimum electronic band gaps ranging from -1.5 to -1.7 eV,\nwhich leads to improved agreement between calculated and experimental band\ngaps. Anharmonic nuclear vibrations play a negligible role in determining the\ngaps. Deuterated ice has a smaller band-gap correction at zero-temperature of\n-1.2 to -1.4eV. Vibrations reduce the differences between the electronic band\ngaps of different proton-orderings from around 0.17 eV to less than 0.05 eV, so\nthat the electronic band gaps of hexagonal and cubic ice are almost independent\nof the proton-ordering when quantum nuclear vibrations are taken into account.\nThe comparatively small reduction in the band gap over the temperature range\n0-240 K of around 0.1 eV does not depend on the proton ordering, or whether the\nice is protiated or deuterated, or hexagonal or cubic. We explain this in terms\nof the atomistic origin of the strong electron-phonon coupling in ice.\n", "  The Higgs portal to scalar Dark Matter is considered in the context of\nnon-linearly realised electroweak symmetry breaking. We determine the\ninteractions of gauge bosons and the physical Higgs particle $h$ to a scalar\nsinglet Dark Matter candidate $S$ in an effective description. The main\nphenomenological differences with respect to the standard scenario can be seen\nin the Dark Matter relic abundance, in direct/indirect searches and in signals\nat colliders.\n", "  Large scale molecular dynamics simulations are used to study the dispersion\nof nanoparticles (NPs) in a polymer film during solvent evaporation. As the\nsolvent evaporates, a dense polymer-rich skin layer forms at the liquid/vapor\ninterface, which is either NP rich or poor depending on the strength of the\nNP/polymer interaction. When the NPs are strongly wet by the polymer, the NPs\naccumulate at the interface and form layers. However when the NPs are only\npartially wet by the polymer, most NPs are uniformly distributed in the bulk of\nthe polymer film with the dense skin layer serving as a barrier to prevent the\nNPs from moving to the interface. Our results point to a possible route to\nemploy less favorable NP/polymer interactions and fast solvent evaporation to\nuniformly disperse NPs in a polymer film, contrary to the common belief that\nstrong NP/polymer attractions are needed to make NPs well dispersed in polymer\nnanocomposites.\n", "  The (1, 0)+(0, 1) representation of the group SL(2, C) provides a\nsix-component spinor equivalent to the electromagnetic field tensor. By means\nof the (1, 0)+(0, 1) description, one can treat the photon field in curved\nspacetime via spin connection and the tetrad formalism, which is of great\nadvantage to study the gravitational spin-orbit coupling of photons. Once the\ngravitational spin-orbit coupling is taken into account, the traditional radius\nof the circular photon orbit in the Schwarzschild geometry should be replaced\nwith two different radiuses corresponding to the photons with the helicities of\n+1 and -1, respectively. Owing to the splitting of energy levels induced by the\nspin-orbit coupling, photons (from Hawking radiations, say) escaping from a\nSchwarzschild black hole are partially polarized, provided that their initial\nvelocities possess nonzero tangential components.\n", "  We investigate the region around the Planck-detected z=3.26 gravitationally\nlensed galaxy HATLAS J114637.9-001132 (hereinafter HATLAS12-00) using both\narchival Herschel data from the H-ATLAS survey and using submm data obtained\nwith both LABOCA and SCUBA2. The lensed source is found to be surrounded by a\nstrong overdensity of both Herschel-SPIRE sources and submm sources. We detect\n17 bright (S_870 >~7 mJy) sources at >4sigma closer than 5 arcmin to the lensed\nobject at 850/870 microns. Ten of these sources have good cross-identifications\nwith objects detected by Herschel-SPIRE which have redder colours than other\nsources in the field, with 350 micron flux > 250 micron flux, suggesting that\nthey lie at high redshift. Submillimeter Array (SMA) observations localise one\nof these companions to ~1 arcsecond, allowing unambiguous cross identification\nwith a 3.6 and 4.5 micron Spitzer source. The optical/near-IR spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) of this source is measured by further observations and found\nto be consistent with z>2, but incompatible with lower redshifts. We conclude\nthat this system may be a galaxy cluster/protocluster or larger scale structure\nthat contains a number of galaxies undergoing starbursts at the same time.\n", "  Tension-compression asymmetry is a notable feature of plasticity in bcc\nsingle crystals. Recent experiments reveal striking differences in the\nplasticity of bcc nanopillars for tension and compression. Here we present\nresults from molecular dynamics simulations of nanopillars of bcc Fe in tension\nand compression. We find that a totally different deformation mechanism applies\nin each cases: dislocation glide in compression and twinning in tension. This\ndifference explains experimentally-observed asymmetry in the nanopillar\nmorphology.\n", "  In this thesis, we discuss and investigate the use of Soft-Collinear\nEffective Theory (SCET) for high precision calculations. In the first part of\nthe work, we present an extraction of the strong coupling, $\\alpha_s(m_Z)$ and\nthe leading nonperturbative parameter $\\Omega_1$, using the event shape\nC-parameter. By comparing lepton collider data to the C-parameter cross\nsection, we extract values $\\alpha_s(m_Z)=0.1123\\pm 0.0015$ and\n$\\Omega_1=0.421\\pm 0.063\\,{\\rm GeV}$ with $\\chi^2/\\rm{dof}=0.988$ for $404$\nbins of data. The later parts of this thesis are dedicated to using on-shell\nhelicity methods to extend SCET beyond leading power. We present a complete set\nof scalar helicity building blocks and describe an interesting angular momentum\nselection rule that restricts how these building blocks can be assembled.\n", "  It is well-known that a constant $\\Lambda$-term is a traditional building\nblock of the concordance $\\Lambda$CDM model. We show that this assumption is\nnot necessarily the optimal one from the phenomenological point of view. The\nclass of running vacuum models, with a possible running of the gravitational\ncoupling G, are capable to fit the overall cosmological data\nSNIa+BAO+H(z)+LSS+BBN+CMB better than the $\\Lambda$CDM, namely at a level of\n$\\sim 3\\sigma$ and with Akaike and Bayesian information criteria supporting a\nstrong level of statistical evidence on this fact. Here we report on the\nresults of such analysis.\n", "  The main objective of this Report is to formulate the general theoretical\nframework of electromagnetic scattering by discrete random media rooted in the\nMaxwell-Lorentz electromagnetics and discuss its immediate analytical and\nnumerical consequences. Starting from the microscopic Maxwell-Lorentz\nequations, we trace the development of the first-principles formalism enabling\naccurate calculations of monochromatic and quasi-monochromatic scattering by\nstatic and randomly varying multiparticle groups. We illustrate how this\ngeneral framework can be coupled with state-of-the-art computer solvers of the\nMaxwell equations and applied to direct modeling of electromagnetic scattering\nby representative random multi-particle groups with arbitrary packing\ndensities. This first-principles modeling yields general physical insights\nunavailable with phenomenological approaches. We discuss how the\nfirst-order-scattering approximation, the radiative transfer theory, and the\ntheory of weak localization of electromagnetic waves can be derived as\nimmediate corollaries of the Maxwell equations for very specific and\nwell-defined kinds of particulate medium. These recent developments confirm the\nmesoscopic origin of the radiative transfer, weak localization, and\neffective-medium regimes and help evaluate the numerical accuracy of widely\nused approximate modeling methodologies.\n", "  Berry's geometric phase naturally appears when a quantum system is driven by\nan external field whose parameters are slowly and cyclically changed. A\nvariation in the coupling between the system and the external field can also\ngive rise to a geometric phase, even when the field is in the vacuum state or\nany other Fock state. Here we demonstrate the appearance of a vacuum-induced\nBerry phase in an artificial atom, a superconducting transmon, interacting with\na single mode of a microwave cavity. As we vary the phase of the interaction,\nthe artificial atom acquires a geometric phase determined by the path traced\nout in the combined Hilbert space of the atom and the quantum field. Our\nability to control this phase opens new possibilities for the geometric\nmanipulation of atom-cavity systems also in the context of quantum information\nprocessing.\n", "  We derive a Hamiltonian version of the ${\\cal PT}$-symmetric discrete\nnonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation that describes synchronized dynamics of\ncoupled pendula driven by a periodic movement of their common strings. In the\nlimit of weak coupling between the pendula, we classify the existence and\nspectral stability of breathers (time-periodic solutions localized in the\nlattice) supported near one pair of coupled pendula. Orbital stability or\ninstability of breathers is proved in a subset of the existence region.\n", "  Automotive traffic is a classical example of a complex system, being the\nsimplest case the homogeneous traffic where all vehicles are of the same kind,\nand using different means of transportation increases complexity due to\ndifferent driving rules and interactions between each vehicle type. In\nparticular, when motorcyclists drive in between the lanes of stopped or\nslow-moving vehicles. This later driving mode is a Venezuelan pervasive\npractice of mobilization that clearly jeopardizes road safety. We developed a\nminimalist agent-based model to analyze the interaction of road users with and\nwithout motorcyclists on the way. The presence of motorcyclists dwindles\nsignificantly the frequency of lane changes of motorists while increasing their\nfrequency of acceleration-deceleration maneuvers, without significantly\naffecting their average speed. That is, motorcyclist \"corralled\" motorists in\ntheir lanes limiting their ability to maneuver and increasing their\nacceleration noise. Comparison of the simulations with real traffic videos\nshows good agreement between model and observation. The implications of these\nresults regarding road safety concerns about the interaction between motorists\nand motorcyclists are discussed.\n", "  Cultured stem cells have become a standard platform not only for regenerative\nmedicine and developmental biology but also for biophysical studies. Yet, the\ncharacterization of cultured stem cells at the level of morphology and\nmacroscopic patterns resulting from cell-to-cell interactions remain largely\nqualitative, even though they are the simplest features observed in everyday\nexperiments. Here we report that neural progenitor cells (NPCs), which are\nmultipotent stem cells that give rise to cells in the central nervous system,\nrapidly glide and stochastically reverse its velocity while locally aligning\nwith neighboring cells, thus showing features of an active nematic system.\nWithin the two-dimensional nematic pattern, we find interspaced topological\ndefects with +1/2 and -1/2 charges. Remarkably, we identified rapid cell\naccumulation leading to three-dimensional mounds at the +1/2 topological\ndefects. Single-cell level imaging around the defects allowed quantification of\nthe evolving cell density, clarifying that not only cells concentrate at +1/2\ndefects, but also escape from -1/2 defects. We propose the mechanism of\ninstability around the defects as the interplay between the anisotropic\nfriction and the active force field, thus addressing a novel universal\nmechanism for local cell density control.\n", "  We present experiments where anisometric colloidal microparticles dispersed\nin a nematic liquid crystal cell with homeotropic anchoring conditions are\ndynamically assembled by means of liquid-crystal-enabled electrophoresis\n(LCEEP) using an AC electric field perpendicular to the confining plates. A\nnematic host with negative dielectric anisotropy leads to a driving force\nparallel to the cell plates. We take advantage of the resulting gliding\nanchoring conditions and the degeneracy in the direction of particle motion to\ndesign reconfigurable trajectories using a photosensitive anchoring layer\n(azosilane self-assembled monolayer), as the particle trajectory follows the\nlocal director orientation.\n", "  Evolutionary games on networks traditionally involve the same game at each\ninteraction. Here we depart from this assumption by considering mixed games,\nwhere the game played at each interaction is drawn uniformly at random from a\nset of two different games. While in well-mixed populations the random mixture\nof the two games is always equivalent to the average single game, in structured\npopulations this is not always the case. We show that the outcome is in fact\nstrongly dependent on the distance of separation of the two games in the\nparameter space. Effectively, this distance introduces payoff heterogeneity,\nand the average game is returned only if the heterogeneity is small. For higher\nlevels of heterogeneity the distance to the average game grows, which often\ninvolves the promotion of cooperation. The presented results support preceding\nresearch that highlights the favorable role of heterogeneity regardless of its\norigin, and they also emphasize the importance of the population structure in\namplifying facilitators of cooperation.\n", "  Plasma etching has a potential to be an alternative processing technology for\nsuperconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities. An apparatus and a method are\ndeveloped for plasma etching of the inner surfaces of SRF cavities. To test the\neffect of the plasma etching on the cavity rf performance, a 1497 MHz single\ncell SRF cavity is used. The single cell cavity is mechanically polished,\nbuffer chemically etched afterwards and rf tested at cryogenic temperatures for\na baseline test. This cavity is then plasma processed. The processing was\naccomplished by moving axially the inner electrode and the gas flow inlet in a\nstep-wise manner to establish segmented plasma processing. The cavity is rf\ntested afterwards at cryogenic temperatures. The rf test and surface condition\nresults are presented.\n", "  We examine a framework with light new physics, which couples to the Standard\nModel only via neutrino mixing. Taking the hints from the short-baseline\nanomalies seriously and combining them with modern cosmological data and recent\nIceCube measurements, we obtain surprisingly effective constraints on the\nhidden force: keV $\\lesssim M \\lesssim0.3$ GeV for the mediator mass and\n$g_{h}>10^{-6}-10^{-3}$ for the coupling constant. Flavor equilibration between\nthe hidden and active neutrinos can be delayed until temperatures of $\\sim 1$\nMeV, but not below $\\sim 100$ keV. This scenario can be tested with\nnext-generation Cosmic Microwave Background, IceCube, and oscillation\nexperiments.\n", "  We analyse the kinematic properties of a plasma electron hole: a non-linear\nself-sustained localized positive electric potential perturbation, trapping\nelectrons, that behaves as a coherent entity. When a hole accelerates or grows\nin depth, ion and electron plasma momentum is changed both within the hole and\noutside it, by an energization process we call jetting. We present a\ncomprehensive analytic calculation of the momentum changes of an isolated\ngeneral one-dimensional hole. The conservation of the total momentum gives the\nhole's kinematics, determining its velocity evolution. Our results explain many\nfeatures of the behavior of hole speed observed in numerical simulations,\nincluding self-acceleration at formation, and hole pushing and trapping by ion\nstreams.\n", "  This paper reviews two techniques that have been recently published for 3D\nprofilometry and proposes one shot profilometry using iterative two-step\ntemporal phase-unwrapping by combining the composite fringe projection and the\niterative two-step temporal phase unwrapping algorithm. In temporal phase\nunwrapping, many images with different frequency fringe pattern are needed to\nproject which would take much time. In order to solve this problem, Ochoa\nproposed a phase unwrapping algorithm based on phase partitions using a\ncomposite fringe, which only needs projecting one composite fringe pattern with\nfour kinds of frequency information to complete the process of 3D profilometry.\nHowever, we found that the fringe order determined through the construction of\nphase partitions tended to be imprecise. Recently, we proposed an iterative\ntwo-step temporal phase unwrapping algorithm, which can achieve high\nsensitivity and high precision shape measurement. But it needs multiple frames\nof fringe images which would take much time. In order to take into account both\nthe speed and accuracy of 3D shape measurement, we get a new, and more accurate\nunwrapping method based on composite fringe pattern by combining these two\ntechniques. This method not only retains the speed advantage of Ochoa's\nalgorithm, but also greatly improves its measurement accuracy. Finally, the\nexperimental evaluation is conducted to prove the validity of the proposed\nmethod, and the experimental results show that this method is feasible.\n", "  We realise a simple and robust optomechanical system with a multitude of\nlong-lived ($Q>10^7$) mechanical modes in a phononic-bandgap shielded membrane\nresonator. An optical mode of a compact Fabry-Perot resonator detects these\nmodes' motion with a measurement rate ($96~\\mathrm{kHz}$) that exceeds the\nmechanical decoherence rates already at moderate cryogenic temperatures\n($10\\,\\mathrm{K}$). Reaching this quantum regime entails, i.~a., quantum\nmeasurement backaction exceeding thermal forces, and thus detectable\noptomechanical quantum correlations. In particular, we observe ponderomotive\nsqueezing of the output light mediated by a multitude of mechanical resonator\nmodes, with quantum noise suppression up to -2.4 dB (-3.6 dB if corrected for\ndetection losses) and bandwidths $\\lesssim 90\\,\\mathrm{ kHz}$. The multi-mode\nnature of the employed membrane and Fabry-Perot resonators lends itself to\nhybrid entanglement schemes involving multiple electromagnetic, mechanical, and\nspin degrees of freedom.\n", "  The adiabatic elastic modulus is often useful in the high frequency response\nof materials. Unfortunately, it can be much more difficult to directly measure\nthe adiabatic elastic modulus of material than the isothermal elastic modulus.\nWe derive the relationship between the adiabatic and isothermal elastic tensors\nfrom the first law of thermodynamics.\n", "  Labouvie \\etal (\\prl {\\bf 115}, 050601, (20015)) recently demonstrated\nnegative differential conductivity (NDC) in a multi-well Bose-Einstein\ncondensate. They stated \"we demonstrate that NDC originates from a nonlinear,\natom number dependent tunneling coupling in combination with fast collisional\ndecoherence.\" We show theoretically how the essential feature of NDC, a\nreduction in atomic current caused by an increase in chemical potential, is\npresent in unitary dynamics through the well-known mechanism of macroscopic\nself-trapping (MST), and that the collisional decoherence merely serves as a\nquantitative modification of this.\n", "  We report on fabrication of depressed cladding optical waveguides buried in\nlithium niobate crystal with shaped femtosecond laser pulses. Depressed\ncladding waveguides of variable mode-field sizes are fabricated by forming the\nfour sides of the cladding using a slit-beam shaping technique. We show that\nthe waveguides fabricated by our technique allows single-mode propagation of\nthe light polarized in both vertical and horizontal directions.\n", "  Bacterial biofilms underlie many persistent infections, posing major hurdles\nin antibiotic treatment. Here, we design and demonstrate tug-of-war optical\ntweezers that can facilitate assessment of cell-cell adhesion - a key\ncontributing factor to biofilm development, thanks to the combined actions of\noptical scattering and gradient forces. With a customized optical landscape\ndistinct from that of conventional tweezers, not only can such tug-of-war\ntweezers stably trap and stretch a rod-shaped bacterium in the observing plane,\nbut, more importantly, they can also impose a tunable lateral force that pulls\napart cellular clusters without any tethering or mechanical movement. As a\nproof of principle, we examined a Sinorhizobium meliloti strain that forms\nrobust biofilms and found that the strength of intercellular adhesion depends\non the growth medium. This technique may herald new photonic tools for optical\nmanipulation and biofilm study, as well as other biological applications.\n", "  We demonstrate particle clustering on macroscopic scales in a coupled\nnonequilibrium system where two species of particles are advected by a\nfluctuating landscape and modify the landscape in the process. The phase\ndiagram generated by varying the particle-landscape coupling, valid for all\nparticle density and in both one and two dimensions, shows novel nonequilibrium\nphases. While particle species are completely phase separated, the landscape\ndevelops macroscopically ordered regions coexisting with a disordered region,\nresulting in coarsening and steady state dynamics on time scales which grow\nalgebraically with size, not seen earlier in systems with pure domains.\n", "  In this paper we revisit the theory of negative capacitance, in a (i)\nstandalone ferroelectric, (ii) ferroelectric-dielectric, and (iii)\nferroelectric-semiconductor series combination, and show that it is important\nto minimize the total Gibbs free energy of the combined system (and not just\nthe free energy of the ferroelectric) to obtain the correct states. The theory\nis explained both analytically and using numerical simulation, for\nferroelectric materials with first order and second order phase transitions.\nThe exact conditions for different regimes of operation in terms of hysteresis\nand gain are derived for ferroelectric-dielectric combination. Finally the\nferroelectric-semiconductor series combination is analyzed to gain insights\ninto the possibility of realization of steep slope transistors in a hysteresis\nfree manner.\n", "  We show room temperature valley coherence with in MoS2, MoSe2, WS2 and WSe2\nmonolayers using linear polarization resolved hot photoluminescence (PL), at\nenergies close to the excitation - demonstrating preservation of valley\ncoherence before sufficient scattering events. The features of the co-polarized\nhot luminescence allow us to extract the lower bound of the binding energy of\nthe A exciton in monolayer MoS2 as 0.42 (+/- 0.02) eV. The broadening of the PL\npeak is found to be dominated by Boltzmann-type hot luminescence tail, and\nusing the slope of the exponential decay, the carrier temperature is extracted\nin-situ at different stages of energy relaxation. The temperature of the\nemitted optical phonons during the relaxation process are probed by exploiting\nthe corresponding broadening of the Raman peaks due to temperature induced\nanharmonic effects. The findings provide a physical picture of photo-generation\nof valley coherent hot carriers, and their subsequent energy relaxation path\nways.\n", "  We study the ferromagnetic superconductor UCoGe at ambient pressure under\n$ab$-plane magnetic fields $\\vec{H}$ which are perpendicular to the\nferromagnetic easy axis. It is shown that, by taking into account the\nDyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction arising from the zigzag chain crystal\nstructure of UCoGe, we can qualitatively explain the experimentally observed\nin-plane anisotropy for critical magnetic fields of the paramagnetic\ntransition. Because of this strong dependence on the magnetic field direction,\nupper critical fields of superconductivity, which is mediated by ferromagnetic\nspin fluctuations, also become strongly anisotropic. The experimental\nobservation of \"S-shaped\" $H_{c2}\\parallel b$-axis is qualitatively explained\nas a result of enhancement of the spin fluctuations due to decreased Curie\ntemperature by the $b$-axis magnetic field. We also show that the S-shaped\n$H_{c2}$ is accompanied by a rotation of the $d$-vector, which would be a key\nto understand the experiments not only at ambient pressure but also under\npressure.\n", "  The shift of density of Bose gas due to the mean field potential (MFP) and\nthe Casimir effect is systematically investigated in the $d$-dimensional\nconfiguration space from the point of thermodynamic consideration. We show\nthat, for $d=3$, the shift of density arises completely due to the Casimir\neffect and, the MFP remains totally ineffective regardless of the state,\ncondensate or non-condensate. But for dimension $d>3$ the MFP plays an active\nrole in shifting the density of Bose gas along with the Casimir interaction.\nThe sign of density shift becomes positive in the present case. So, the\ncorresponding critical temperature shift would be negative, because these two\nshifts are related as $\\Delta n_{c}$/$n_{c}$ $\\approx$ -$\\Delta T_{c}$/$T_{c}$.\nIt is important to note that, the MFP causes a shift of density for $d>3$ even\nwhen the Casimir effect is not there, and the sign of shift becomes negative\nthen; consequently, the critical temperature shift would be positive with MFP\nalone in this particular situation.\n", "  In this work, a new methodology for comparing high power performance of\ndifferent piezoelectric materials is presented. When comparing high power\nperformance of piezoelectric materials of varying compositions and vibration\nmodes, there exists an inherent problem in comparing the mechanical quality\nfactor directly. Typically the behavior of the mechanical quality factor is\nreported as a function of tip vibration velocity of the sample. This paper\nshows why this approach can be inherently problematic and proposes an energy\napproach to characterize the mechanical quality factor as the solution. By\nutilizing mechanical energy density ($u_{e}$), the mass density of the material\nsystem ($\\rho$), and the vibration mode shape (e.g. $k_{31}$ and $k_{p}$) of\nthe sample are accounted for. Therefore, a better method to compare high power\nperformance of varying piezoelectric compositions is introduced. Furthermore,\nthe new method is applied to various compositions by using data available in\nthe literature. As a result, the high power behavior of the materials appear to\nbe significantly different when the new \"energy density approach\" is used to\ncompare the mechanical quality factor rather than vibration velocity. Also, the\ntechnique's ability to be utilized to consolidate data from different\nresonators to determine anisotropic loss factors is demonstrated on hard and\nsoft PZT samples of $k_{31}$ and $k_{p}$ geometries.\n", "  Micro-scale flow in cylindrical geometries can harness chaotic advection to\nperform complex thermally activated biochemical reactions such as the\npolymerase chain reaction (PCR). We have applied a 3D computational fluid\ndynamics model to resolve the complex flow patterns in such geometries. The\nresulting 3D flow trajectories are then used as input to a kinetic model to\nresolve the time evolution of DNA replication process. A simple mass action\nkinetic model was developed to couple these biochemical reactions with the\nintricate flow. Residence time analysis of virtual particles in the flow\nrevealed that the flow has a strong chaotic component in wider geometries in\ncomparison with taller geometries (quasi periodic motion). This work shows, for\nthe first time that the chaotic aspect of the flow field plays a key role in\ndetermining the strength of the coupling between the reactions and the flow.\nOur model can quantify the doubling times of these reactions capturing the lag,\nexponential and plateau phases of PCR. It predicts that doubling times are\nlower in wider geometries, in agreement with experimental results.\n", "  Maximally random jammed (MRJ) particle packings can be viewed as prototypical\nglasses in that they are maximally disordered while simultaneously being\nmechanically rigid. The prediction of the MRJ packing density phi, among other\npacking properties of frictionless particles, still poses many theoretical\nchallenges, even for congruent spheres or disks. Using the geometric-structure\napproach, we derive for the first time a highly accurate formula for MRJ\ndensities for a very wide class of twodimensional frictionless packings,\nnamely, binary convex superdisks, with shapes that continuously interpolate\nbetween circles and squares.\n", "  In this paper, we address the question of how the relative weighting of the\ntwo invariants of the plastic deformation of the matrix influence the\nmechanical response of a porous metallic material. To this end, we first\npropose a new isotropic potential for description of the plastic behavior of\nthe matrix that depends on both invariants of the strain-rate deviator. The\nrelative weight of the two invariants is described by a material parameter b.\nDepending on the sign of the parameter b, the new plastic potential for the\nmatrix is either interior to von Mises strain-rate potential (b <0), coincides\nwith it (b =0) or it is exterior to it. Next, an analytic criterion for a\nporous solid with matrix governed by the new strain-rate potential is obtained\nusing rigorous upscaling methods. Analysis is conducted for both tensile and\ncompressive axisymmetric loading scenarios and spherical void geometry. No\nsimplifying approximations are considered when estimating the local and overall\nplastic dissipation, respectively. It is shown that the value of b has a\ndrastic influence on all aspects of the mechanical response. There is a value b\n= b *<0such that there is almost no influence of J3 on the mechanical response\nof the porous solid. If the matrix is characterized by b > b*, the response of\nthe porous material for tensile loadings and J3>0 is softer than that for\nloadings at J3<0. The reverse holds true for b < b *. The noteworthy result is\nthat irrespective of the value of the parameter b, the response of the porous\nsolid is harder than that of a porous Tresca material. However, depending on\nthe value of b, the rate of void growth or collapse can be either faster or\nslower than that of a porous Mises material.\n", "  The effect of ion mass on pair production in the interaction of an\nultraintense laser with overdense plasmas has been explored by particle-in-cell\n(PIC) simulation. It is found that the heavier ion mass excites the higher and\nbroader electrostatic field, which is responsible for the enhancement of\nbackward photon number. The pair yields are also reinforced due to the increase\nof head-on collision of backwards photon with incoming laser. By examining the\ndensity evolution and angle distribution of each particle species the origin of\npair yields enhancement has been clarified further.\n", "  It is demonstrated that a pair can be characterized under which mechanism it\nwas created according to its conversion energy, a quantity defined as the sum\nof electron and its conjugate positron's mass-energy, in the study of\nelectron-positron pair creation. The value of this quantity is checked with\nquantum field theoretical simulations for several field configurations and\nfound that it can describe the creation process with rich physical picture,\nshowing all the creation channels and giving the yields of each channel\nspecifically. Evenly as a very convenient and powerful detection quantity it\ncan be applicable to some complicated pair creation processes such as that\ntriggered by cooperation of two different photons as well as the dynamically\nassisted Schwinger mechanism.\n", "  The fermion particle pair production in strong SU(2) gauged chromoelectric\nfields is studied by using Boltzmann-Vlasov equation in a classical way. The\nexistence of pre-production process in a classical description is shown with\nthe distribution evolution of non-Abelian particle production. It is\ninteresting to find that the distribution center of particle number density is\non two islands and has a split on color charge sphere as it evolutes and\nreaches a steady state at last, which is related to the amplitude and the\nvarying of the field.\n", "  The engineering of quantum devices has reached the stage where we now have\nsmall scale quantum processors containing multiple interacting qubits within\nthem. Simple quantum circuits have been demonstrated and scaling up to larger\nnumbers is underway. However as the number of qubits in these processors\nincreases, it becomes challenging to implement switchable or tunable coherent\ncoupling among them. The typical approach has been to detune each qubit from\nothers or the quantum bus it connected to, but as the number of qubits\nincreases this becomes problematic to achieve in practice due to frequency\ncrowding issues. Here, we demonstrate that by applying a fast longitudinal\ncontrol field to the target qubit, we can turn off its couplings to other\nqubits or buses (in principle on/off ratio higher than 100 dB). This has\nimportant implementations in superconducting circuits as it means we can keep\nthe qubits at their optimal points, where the coherence properties are\ngreatest, during coupling/decoupling processing. Our approach suggests a new\nway to control coupling among qubits and data buses that can be naturally\nscaled up to large quantum processors without the need for auxiliary circuits\nand yet be free of the frequency crowding problems.\n", "  We define the time-continuous spin coherent-state path integral in a way that\nis free from inconsistencies. The proposed definition is used to reproduce\nknown exact results. Such a formalism opens new possibilities for applying\napproximations with improved accuracy and can be proven useful in a great\nvariety of problems where spin Hamiltonians are used.\n", "  We examine new tests for (non-)extremal Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om/Conformal field\ntheory correspondences (RN/CFT) in this paper. The decay rate of the charged\nscalar wave sourced by an orbiting star around the black hole is computed and\nis compared with the decay rate computed in the corresponding CFT. We find that\nprecise matches are achieved.\n", "  We investigate theoretically charge migration following prompt double\nionization of a polyatomic molecule (C$_2$H$_4$BrI) and find that for double\nionization, correlation-driven charge migration appears to be particularly\nprominent, i.e., we observe exceptionally rich dynamics solely driven by the\nelectron-electron interaction even in the situation when the electrons are\nemitted from outer-valence orbitals. These strongly correlated electron\ndynamics are witnessed in the theoretically determined time-resolved transient\nabsorption cross section. Strikingly, features in the cross section can be\ntraced back to electron hole populations and time-dependent partial charges and\nhence, can be interpreted with surprising ease. Remarkably, by taking advantage\nof element specific core-to-valence transitions, the hole population dynamics\ncan be followed both in time and space. With this, not only do we report the\nhigh relevance of correlation-driven charge migration following double\nionization but our findings also highlight the outstanding role of attosecond\ntransient absorption spectroscopy (ATAS) as one of the most promising\ntechniques for monitoring ultrafast electron dynamics in complex molecular\nsystems.\n", "  We study the conformally invariant variational problem for time-like curves\nin the $n$-dimensional Einstein universe defined by the conformal strain\nfunctional. We prove that the stationary curves are trapped into an Einsetin\nuniverse of dimension $2$, $3$ or $4$. We study the linearly-full stationary\ncurves in a four-dimensional Einstein universe and we show that they can be\nintegrated by quadratures in terms of elliptic functions, elliptic integrals\nand Jacobi's theta functions.\n", "  The main physical results on the registration of solar neutrinos and the\nsearch for rare processes obtained by the Borexino collaboration to date are\npresented.\n", "  The CMS experiment, located at the CERN Large Hadron Collider, has a\nredundant muon system composed by three different detector technologies:\nCathode Strip Chambers (in the forward regions), Drift Tubes (in the central\nregion) and Resistive Plate Chambers (both its central and forward regions).\nAll three are used for muon reconstruction and triggering. During the first\nlong shutdown (LS1) of the LHC (2013-2014) the CMS muon system has been\nupgraded with 144 newly installed RPCs on the forth forward stations. The new\nchambers ensure and enhance the muon trigger efficiency in the high luminosity\nconditions of the LHC Run2. The chambers have been successfully installed and\ncommissioned. The system has been run successfully and experimental data has\nbeen collected and analyzed. The performance results of the newly installed\nRPCs will be presented.\n", "  The properties of a semiconductor get drastically modified when the crystal\npoint group symmetry is broken under an arbitrary strain. We investigate the\nfamily of semiconductors consisting of GaAs, GaSb, InAs and InSb, considering\ntheir electronic band structure and deformation potentials subject to various\nstrains based on hybrid density functional theory. Guided by these\nfirst-principles results, we develop strain-compliant local pseudopotentials\nfor use in the empirical pseudopotential method (EPM). We demonstrate that the\nnewly proposed empirical pseudopotentials perform well close to band edges and\nunder anisotropic crystal deformations. Using EPM, we explore the heavy\nhole-light hole mixing characteristics under different stress directions which\nmay be useful in manipulating their transport properties and optical selection\nrules. The very low 5 Ry cutoff targeted in the generated pseudopotentials\npaves the way for large-scale EPM-based electronic structure computations\ninvolving these lattice mismatched constituents.\n", "  We propose a new method to characterize the spatial distribution of\nparticles' vibrations in solids with much lower computational costs compared to\nthe usual normal mode analysis. We excite the specific vibrational mode in a\ntwo dimensional athermal jammed system by giving a small amplitude of active\noscillation to each particle's size with an identical driving frequency. The\nresponse is then obtained as the real time displacements of the particles. We\nshow remarkable correlations between the real time displacements and the eigen\nvectors obtained from conventional normal mode analysis. More importantly, from\nthese real time displacements, we can measure the participation ratio and\nspatial polarization of particles' vibrations. From these measurements, we find\nthree distinct frequency regimes which characterize the spatial distribution\nand correlation of particles' vibrations in jammed amorphous solids.\nFurthermore, we can possibly apply this method to a much larger system to\nexamine the low frequency behaviour of amorphous solids with a much higher\nresolution of the frequency space.\n", "  This paper describes the VARTOOLS program, which is an open-source\ncommand-line utility, written in C, for analyzing astronomical time-series\ndata, especially light curves. The program provides a general-purpose set of\ntools for processing light curves including signal identification, filtering,\nlight curve manipulation, time conversions, and modeling and simulating light\ncurves. Some of the routines implemented include the Generalized Lomb-Scargle\nperiodogram, the Box-Least Squares transit search routine, the Analysis of\nVariance periodogram, the Discrete Fourier Transform including the CLEAN\nalgorithm, the Weighted Wavelet Z-Transform, light curve arithmetic, linear and\nnon-linear optimization of analytic functions including support for Markov\nChain Monte Carlo analyses with non-trivial covariances, characterizing and/or\nsimulating time-correlated noise, and the TFA and SYSREM filtering algorithms,\namong others. A mechanism is also provided for incorporating a user's own\ncompiled processing routines into the program. VARTOOLS is designed especially\nfor batch processing of light curves, including built-in support for parallel\nprocessing, making it useful for large time-domain surveys such as searches for\ntransiting planets. Several examples are provided to illustrate the use of the\nprogram.\n", "  We summarize the emergence of non-commutative/non-associative structures in\nDirac's generalization of Maxwell theory, focusing mostly on the magnetic field\nanalogue of the non-geometric R-flux string model. The cohomological\ninterpretation of the obstructions to associativity in terms of 3-cocycles and\nthe use of the star product as alternative to ordinary quantization are also\ndiscussed in this context.\n", "  Following letter introduces a theoretical approach to investigate the effect\nof two-step GaN barrier layer growth methodology on the performance of\nInGaN/GaN MQW solar cell, in which a lower temperature GaN cap layer was grown\non top of each quantum well followed by a higher temperature GaN barrier layer.\nDifferent growth conditions would cause changes in the concentration of trap\nlevel density of states and imperfection sites. The simulation and comparison\nof 3 samples each with different cap layer thickness, reveals the fact that\nincreasing cap layer thickness results in higher quantum efficiency, improved\nshort circuit density of current and 3.2% increase of the fill factor.\n", "  In the present work, eigenvalue distributions defined by a random rectangular\nmatrix whose components are neither independently nor identically distributed\nare analyzed using replica analysis and belief propagation. In particular, we\nconsider the case in which the components are independently but not identically\ndistributed; for example, only the components in each row or in each column may\nbe {identically distributed}. We also consider the more general case in which\nthe components are correlated with one another. We use the replica approach\nwhile making only weak assumptions in order to determine the asymptotic\neigenvalue distribution and to derive an algorithm for doing so, based on\nbelief propagation. One of our findings supports the results obtained from\nFeynman diagrams. We present the results of several numerical experiments that\nvalidate our proposed methods.\n", "  We analyze the optical, chemical, and electrical properties of chemical vapor\ndeposition (CVD) grown hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) using the precursor\nammonia-borane ($H_3N-BH_3$) as a function of $Ar/H_2$ background pressure\n($P_{TOT}$). Films grown at $P_{TOT}$ less than 2.0 Torr are uniform in\nthickness, highly crystalline, and consist solely of h-BN. At larger $P_{TOT}$,\nwith constant precursor flow, the growth rate increases, but the resulting h-BN\nis more amorphous, disordered, and $sp^3$ bonded. We attribute these changes in\nh-BN grown at high pressure to incomplete thermolysis of the $H_3N-BH_3$\nprecursor from a passivated Cu catalyst. A similar increase in h-BN growth rate\nand amorphization is observed even at low $P_{TOT}$ if the $H_3N-BH_3$ partial\npressure is initially greater than the background pressure $P_{TOT}$ at the\nbeginning of growth. h-BN growth using the $H_3N-BH_3$ precursor reproducibly\ncan give large-area, crystalline h-BN thin films, provided that the total\npressure is under 2.0 Torr and the precursor flux is well-controlled.\n", "  Assuming that the lightest neutrino mass $ m_0 $ is measured, we study the\ninfluence of error of the measured $ m_0 $ on the uncertainty of the predicted\nvalue of the neutrinoless double beta decay ($0 \\, \\nu \\beta \\beta$) effective\nMajorana mass $ \\vert m_{ee} \\vert $. The error of the predicted value of\neffective Majorana mass $ \\sigma ( \\vert m_{ee} \\vert ) $ due to the error $\n\\sigma (m_0) $ is obtained by use of the propagation of errors. We investigate\nin detail how $ \\sigma ( \\vert m_{ee} \\vert ) $ behaves when the Majorana\nphases $ \\beta $ and $ \\alpha $ change, and also when the size of the lightest\nneutrino mass changes. It is shown that $ \\sigma ( \\vert m_{ee} \\vert ) $ does\nnot exceed $ \\sigma (m_0) $, and that the minimum value of $ \\sigma ( \\vert\nm_{ee} \\vert ) $ in the $ \\beta - \\alpha $ plane can be zero if the size of $\nm_0 $ is rather small. In the normal mass ordering case, the maximum value of $\n\\sigma ( \\vert m_{ee} \\vert ) $ in the $ \\beta - \\alpha $ plane becomes about $\n0.68 \\, \\sigma (m_0) $ if $ m_0 (= m_1 ) $ is very small, while in the inverted\nmass ordering case, it becomes about $ 0.02 \\, \\sigma (m_0) $ if $ m_0 (= m_3 )\n$ is very small. By use of the calculated $ \\sigma ( \\vert m_{ee} \\vert ) $, we\nalso discuss the minimum condition for the relative error of the lightest\nneutrino mass to raise the possibility of obtaining the information on $ \\beta\n$ and $ \\alpha $.\n", "  Standing on the results for the minimum weight states obtained in the\nprevious paper (I), an idea how to construct the linearly independent basis is\nproposed for the su(n)-Lipkin model. This idea starts in setting up m\nindependent su(2)-subalgebras in the cases with n=2m and n=2m+1 (m=2,3,4,...).\nThe original representation is re-formed in terms of the spherical tensors for\nthe su(n)-generators built under the su(2)-subalgebras. Through this\nre-formation, the su(m)-subalgebra can be found. For constructing the linearly\nindependent basis, not only the su(2)-algebras but also the su(m)-subalgebra\nplay a central role. Some concrete results in the cases with n=2, 3, 4 and 5\nare presented.\n", "  Mn2+ ion doping is used as an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) probe to\ninvestigate the influence of low-coordination structural defects such as step\nedges at the surface of terraced (001) MgO nanoparticles on the electronic\nproperties. Beside the well-known hyperfine sextet of Mn2+ ions in the cubic\ncrystal field of MgO, an additional EPR feature with a striking non-monotonous\ntemperature dependent shift of the g-factor is observed in terraced\nnanoparticles in the temperature range from 4K to room temperature. By linking\nthe difference in the temperature dependence of the Mn2+ sextet intensity in\ncubic and terraced nanoparticles with the possible s-d exchange shift and\nenhanced Zeeman splitting we conclude that the novel EPR feature originates\nfrom the loosely trapped charge-compensating carriers at the abundant\nstructural defects at the surface of terraced nanoparticles due to their\nexchange interaction with neighboring Mn2+ ions.\n", "  We suggest that the emergence of a large deformation in the magnesium, Mg,\nnuclides, especially at the Z = 12, N = 12, should be associated with an\noctahedral deformed shape. Within the framework of molecular geometrical\nsymmetry, we find a possibility that the Z = 12, N = 12 system would form an\noctahedral structure consisting of six points of alpha(4He) particles, yielding\nthe ground collectivity. With this point of view, we draw the following serial\nmolecular structures; the Z = 10, N = 10, 20Ne, corresponds to a hexahedral,\nthe Z = 8, N = 8, 16O, does to a tetrahedral, and the Z = 6, N = 6, 12C, does\nto a trigonal symmetry. Moreover, the Z = 2, N = 2, 4He(alpha), fits into a\ntetrahedral symmetry with four points of nucleons; two protons and two\nneutrons. The enhanced deformation at Z = 12 with N > 20 would be explained by\na deformed shape related to an Ethene(Ethylene)-like skeleton with six alpha\nparticles. The deformation at Z = 10, with N = 10 and 12, can be interpreted as\nbeing attributed to a hexahedral shape combined by five alpha particles as\nwell. By noticing that the Z = 4, N = 4 system is unstable to the ground state\nunder two-body system with two alpha particles, we conclude that alpha\nparticles, rather than the eight-protons-neutrons nucleon, govern the 8Be\nstability. Accordingly, the alpha particle should be a third nucleon, like a\nproton or a neutron, in a nucleus. We name it the 'Alpharon'. With this\npicture, we are able to open a new gate toward understanding of nuclear\nmany-body systems; nucleon-nucleon interaction, shell structures,\nnucleon-synthesis, and nuclear matters. We argue that nature favors three-body\nsystems; three quarks for a nucleon, three nucleons for a nucleus.\n", "  We present an enhanced diffusion of nuclear spin polarization in fractional\nquantum Hall domain phases at $\\nu = 2/3$. Resistively-detected NMR mediated by\nelectrically driven domain-wall motion is used as a probe of local nuclear\npolarization, manifesting pumping-dependent signal saturation behavior. This\nreveals that a relatively homogeneous polarization profile spreads even to\nplaces distant from pinning centers of the domain walls. We attribute this to\nthe fact that the pumped nuclear polarization near the domain walls rapidly\ndiffuses into the domains where nuclei experience Knight fields on comparable\nlevels. The anomalous enhancement of nuclear diffusion may be interpreted in\nterms of indirect hyperfine-mediated interaction between nuclear spins in the\ndomains.\n", "  When fabricating magnetic memories, one of the main challenges is to maintain\nthe bit stability while downscaling. Indeed, for magnetic volumes of a few\nthousand nm3, the energy barrier between magnetic configurations becomes\ncomparable to the thermal energy at room temperature. Then, switches of the\nmagnetization spontaneously occur. These volatile, superparamagnetic\nnanomagnets are generally considered useless. But what if we could use them as\nlow power computational building blocks? Remarkably, they can oscillate without\nthe need of any external dc drive, and despite their stochastic nature, they\ncan beat in unison with an external periodic signal. Here we show that the\nphase locking of superparamagnetic tunnel junctions can be induced and\nsuppressed by electrical noise injection. We develop a comprehensive model\ngiving the conditions for synchronization, and predict that it can be achieved\nwith a total energy cost lower than 10-^13 J. Our results open the path to\nultra-low power computation based on the controlled synchronization of\noscillators.\n", "  Topological insulators are transformative quantum solids with\nimmune-to-disorder metallic surface states having Dirac band structure.\nUbiquitous charged bulk defects, however, pull the Fermi energy into the bulk\nbands, denying access to surface charge transport. Here we demonstrate that\nirradiation with swift ($\\sim 2.5$ MeV energy) electron beams allows to\ncompensate these defects, bring the Fermi level back into the bulk gap, and\nreach the charge neutrality point (CNP). Controlling the beam fluence we tune\nbulk conductivity from \\textit{p}- (hole-like) to \\textit{n}-type\n(electron-like), crossing the Dirac point and back, while preserving the Dirac\nenergy dispersion. The CNP conductance has a two-dimensional (2D) character on\nthe order of ten conductance quanta $G_0 =e^2/h$, and reveals, both in\nBi$_2$Te$_3$ and Bi$_2$Se$_3$, the presence of only two quantum channels\ncorresponding to two topological surfaces. The intrinsic quantum transport of\nthe topological states is accessible disregarding the bulk size.\n", "  On a pseudo-Riemannian manifold $\\mathcal{M}$ we introduce a system of\npartial differential Killing type equations for spinor-valued differential\nforms, and study their basic properties. We discuss the relationship between\nsolutions of Killing equations on $\\mathcal{M}$ and parallel fields on the\nmetric cone over $\\mathcal{M}$ for spinor-valued forms.\n", "  Through molecular mechanics we find that non-covalent interactions modify the\nfractality of crumpled damaged graphene. Pristine graphene membranes are\ndamaged by adding random vacancies and carbon-hydrogen bonds. Crumpled\nmembranes exhibit a fractal dimension of $ 2.71 \\pm 0.02$ when all interactions\nbetween carbon atoms are considered, and $2.30 \\pm 0.05$ when non-covalent\ninteractions are suppressed. The transition between these two values, obtained\nby switching on/off the non-covalent interactions of equilibrium\nconfigurations, is shown to be reversible and independent on thermalisation. In\norder to explain this transition, we propose a theoretical model that is\ncompatible with our numerical findings. Finally, we also compare damaged\ngraphene membranes with other crumpled structures, as for instance, polymerised\nmembranes and paper sheets, that share similar scaling properties.\n", "  The notion from ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations that nuclear motion\nis best described by classical Newton dynamics instead of the time-dependent\nSchr{\\\"o}dinger equation is substantiated. In principle a single experiment\nshould bring clarity. Caution is however necessary, as temperature dependent\neffects must be eliminated when trying to determine the existence of a\nzero-point energy.\n", "  Resonant photoemission spectroscopy has been used to investigate the\ncharacter of Fe 3d states in FeAl alloy. Fe 3d states have two different\ncharacter, first is of itinerant nature located very close to the Fermi level,\nand second, is of less itinerant (relatively localized character), located\nbeyond 2 eV below the Fermi level. These distinct states are clearly\ndistinguishable in the resonant photoemission data. Comparison between the\nresults obtained from experiments and first principle based electronic\nstructure calculation show that the origin of the itinerant character of the Fe\n3d states is due to the ordered B2 structure, whereas the relatively less\nitinerant (localized) Fe 3d states are from the disorders present in the\nsample. The exchange splitting of the Fe 3s core level peak confirms the\npresence of local moment in this system. It is found that the itinerant\nelectrons arise due to the hybridization between Fe 3d and Al 3s-3p states.\nPresence of hybridization is observed as a shift in the Al 2p core-level\nspectra as well as in the X-ray near edge absorption spectra towards lower\nbinding energy. Our photoemission results are thus explained by the\nco-existence of ordered and disordered phases in the system.\n", "  Many natural processes exhibit power-law behavior. The power-law exponent is\nlinked to the underlying physical process and therefore its precise value is of\ninterest. With respect to the energy content of nanoflares, for example, a\npower-law exponent steeper than 2 is believed to be a necessary condition to\nsolve the enigmatic coronal heating problem. Studying power-law distributions\nover several orders of magnitudes requires sufficient data and appropriate\nmethodology. In this paper we demonstrate the shortcomings of some popular\nmethods in solar physics that are applied to data of typical sample sizes. We\nuse synthetic data to study the effect of the sample size on the performance of\ndifferent estimation methods and show that vast amounts of data are needed to\nobtain a reliable result with graphical methods (where the power-law exponent\nis estimated by a linear fit on a log-transformed histogram of the data). We\nrevisit published results on power laws for the angular width of solar coronal\nmass ejections and the radiative losses of nanoflares. We demonstrate the\nbenefits of the maximum likelihood estimator and advocate its use.\n", "  We investigate the dust properties in three spectroscopically anomalous\ngalaxies (IRAS F10398+1455, IRAS F21013-0739 and SDSS J0808+3948). Their\nSpitzer/IRS spectra are characterized by a steep ~5-8 micron emission\ncontinuum, strong emission bands from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)\nmolecules, and prominent 10 micron silicate emission. The steep ~5-8 micron\ncontinuum and strong PAH emission features suggest the presence of starbursts,\nwhile the silicate emission is indicative of significant heating from AGNs. The\nsimultaneous detection of these two observational properties has rarely been\nreported on galactic scale. We employ the PAHFIT software to estimate their\nstarlight contributions, and the CLUMPY model for the components contributed by\nthe AGN tori. We find that the CLUMPY model is generally successful in\nexplaining the overall dust infrared emission, although it appears to emit too\nflat at the ~5-8 micron continuum to be consistent with that observed in IRAS\nF10398+1455 and IRAS F21013-0739. The flat ~5-8 micron continuum calculated\nfrom the CLUMPY model could arise from the adopted specific silicate opacity of\nOssenkopf et al. (1992) which exceeds that of the Draine & Lee (1984)\n\"astronomical silicate\" by a factor up to 2 in the ~5-8 micron wavelength\nrange. Future models with a variety of dust species incorporated in the CLUMPY\nradiation transfer regime are needed for a thorough understanding of the dust\nproperties of these spectroscopically anomalous galaxies.\n", "  Ices play a critical role during the evolution of interstellar clouds. Their\npresence is ubiquitous in the dense molecular medium and their impact is not\nonly limited to chemistry. Species adsorbed onto dust grains also affect cloud\nthermodynamics. It all depends on the interstellar conditions, the chemical\nparameters, and the composition of ice layers. In this work, I study the\nformation of ices by focusing on the interplay between gas and solid phase to\ndetermine their role on cloud evolution and star formation. I show that while\nthe formation of ices greatly impacts the cloud chemistry, their role on the\nthermodynamics is more conservative, and their influence on star formation is\nonly marginal.\n", "  This paper explores different photo-bending shapes in polydomain nematic\nglass. The motivation is to explain the phenomenon in experiment [1] under\npolarized light in which a nematic film curls into an circular arc, like part\nof a cylindrical surface. Polarized light triggers photo-isomerization and\ntherefore makes liquid crystals (LCs) contract along their directors. We apply\nthe Sachs limit to homogenize the deformation of polydomain LC glass.\nPhoto-strain can be either contraction or expansion through the material.\nBending shapes can be anticlastic, bowl-shaped and cylindrical affected by\nPoisson ratio and illumination intensity. An explanation for the cylindrical\nbend and ways to observe other shapes are given in a parameter plane.\n", "  This book provides a comprehensive introduction for the study of extreme\nevents in the context of dynamical systems. The introduction provides a broad\noverview of the interdisciplinary research area of extreme events, underlining\nits relevance for mathematics, natural sciences, engineering, and social\nsciences. After exploring the basics of the classical theory of extreme events,\nthe book presents a careful examination of how a dynamical system can serve as\na generator of stochastic processes, and explores in detail the relationship\nbetween the hitting and return time statistics of a dynamical system and the\npossibility of constructing extreme value laws for given observables. Explicit\nderivation of extreme value laws are then provided for selected dynamical\nsystems. The book then discusses how extreme events can be used as probes for\ninferring fundamental dynamical and geometrical properties of a dynamical\nsystem and for providing a novel point of view in problems of physical and\ngeophysical relevance. A final summary of the main results is then presented\nalong with a discussion of open research questions. Finally, an appendix with\nsoftware in Matlab programming language allows the readers to develop further\nunderstanding of the presented concepts.\n", "  We performed high-resolution Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy\nof a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) sphere of unknown size in the Mie\nscattering region. Apart from a slow, oscillatory structure (wiggles), which is\ndue to an interference effect, the measured FTIR extinction spectrum exhibits a\nripple structure, which is due to electromagnetic resonances. We fully\ncharacterize the underlying electromagnetic mode structure of the spectrum by\nassigning two mode numbers to each of the ripples in the measured spectrum. We\nshow that analyzing the ripple structure in the spectrum in the wavenumber\nregion from about $3000\\,$cm$^{-1}$ to $8000\\,$cm$^{-1}$ allows us to both\ndetermine the unknown radius of the sphere and the PMMA index of refraction,\nwhich shows a strong frequency dependence in this near-infrared spectral\nregion. While in this paper we focus on examining a PMMA sphere as an example,\nour method of determining the refractive index and its dispersion from\nsynchrotron infrared extinction spectra is generally applicable for the\ndetermination of the index of refraction of any transparent substance that can\nbe shaped into micron-sized spheres.\n", "  We study boson stars in a theory of complex scalar field coupled to Einstein\ngravity with the potential: $V(|\\Phi|) := m^{2} |\\Phi|^2 +2 \\lambda |\\Phi|$\n(where $m^2$ and $\\lambda$ are positive constant parameters). This could be\nconsidered either as a theory of massive complex scalar field coupled to\ngravity in a conical potential or as a theory in the presence of a potential\nwhich is an overlap of a parabolic and a conical potential. We study our theory\nwith positive as well as negative values of the cosmological constant\n$\\Lambda$. Boson stars are found to come in two types, having either ball-like\nor shell-like charge density. We have studied the properties of these solutions\nand have also determined their domains of existence for some specific values of\nthe parameters of the theory. Similar solutions have also been obtained by\nHartmann, Kleihaus, Kunz, and Schaffer, in a V-shaped scalar potential.\n", "  The electro-osmotic flow through a channel between two undulated surfaces\ninduced by an external electric field is investigated. The gap of the channel\nis very small and comparable to the thickness of the electrical double layers.\nA lattice Boltzmann simulation is carried out on the model consisting of the\nPoisson equation for electrical potential, the Nernst--Planck equation for ion\nconcentration, and the Navier--Stokes {\\color{black}equations} for flows of the\nelectrolyte solution. An analytical model that predicts the flow rate is also\nderived under the assumption that the channel width is very small compared with\nthe characteristic length of the variation along the channel. The analytical\nresults are compared with the numerical results obtained by using the lattice\nBoltzmann method. In the case of a constant surface charge density along the\nchannel, the variation of the channel width reduces the electro-osmotic flow,\nand the flow rate is smaller than that of a straight channel. In the case of a\nsurface charge density distributed in homogeneously, one-way flow occurs even\nunder the restriction of a zero net surface charge along the channel.\n", "  The Beijing $e^+e^-$-collider (BEPCII) is a double-ring symmetric collider\nrunning at center-of-mass energies between 2.0 and 4.6 GeV. This energy range\nallows the BESIII-experiment to measure baryon electromagnetic form factors in\ndirect $e^+e^-$-annihilation and in initial state radiation processes. In this\npaper, results on $e^+e^-\\rightarrow p\\bar{p}$ and $e^+e^-\\rightarrow \\Lambda\n\\bar{\\Lambda}$ based on data collected by BESIII in 2011 and 2012 are\npresented. Expectations from the BESIII high luminosity energy scan from 2015\nand from radiative return at different center-of-mass energies are also\nreported.\n", "  The role of electron-nuclear entanglement on the validity of the\nBorn-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation is investigated. While nonadiabatic\ncouplings generally lead to entanglement and to a failure of the BO\napproximation, surprisingly the degree of electron-nuclear entanglement is\nfound to be uncorrelated with the degree of validity of the BO approximation.\nThis is because while the degree of entanglement of BO states is determined by\ntheir deviation from the corresponding states in the crude BO approximation,\nthe accuracy of the BO approximation is dictated, instead, by the deviation of\nthe BO states from the exact electron-nuclear states. In fact, in the context\nof a minimal avoided crossing model, extreme cases are identified where an\nadequate BO state is seen to be maximally entangled, and where the BO\napproximation fails but the associated BO state remains approximately\nunentangled. Further, the BO states are found to not preserve the entanglement\nproperties of the exact electron-nuclear eigenstates, and to be completely\nunentangled only in the limit in which the BO approximation becomes exact.\n", "  A wide range of complex systems can be modeled as networks with corresponding\nconstraints on the edges and nodes, which have been extensively studied in\nrecent years. Nowadays, with the progress of information technology, systems\nthat contain the information collected from multiple perspectives have been\ngenerated. The conventional models designed for single perspective networks\nfail to depict the diverse topological properties of such systems, so\nmultilayer network models aiming at describing the structure of these networks\nemerge. As a major concern in network science, decomposing the networks into\ncommunities, which usually refers to closely interconnected node groups,\nextracts valuable information about the structure and interactions of the\nnetwork. Unlike the contention of dozens of models and methods in conventional\nsingle-layer networks, methods aiming at discovering the communities in the\nmultilayer networks are still limited. In order to help explore the community\nstructure in multilayer networks, we propose the multilayer edge mixture model,\nwhich explores a relatively general form of a community structure evaluator\nfrom an edge combination view. As an example, we demonstrate that the\nmultilayer modularity and stochastic blockmodels can be derived from the\nproposed model. We also explore the decomposition of community structure\nevaluators with specific forms to the multilayer edge mixture model\nrepresentation, which turns out to reveal some new interpretation of the\nevaluators. The flexibility and performance on different networks of the\nproposed model are illustrated with applications on a series of benchmark\nnetworks.\n", "  Laser pulses interaction with tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) in Tris-HCl pH7.5\nbuffer and in water has been investigated. 20 ns ruby laser pulses have been\nused for excitation. Spectrum of the light passing through the sample was\nregistered with the help of Fabri-Perot interferometer. In the case of TMV in\nwater we observed in the spectrum only one line of the exciting laser light,\nfor TMV in Tris-HCl pH7.5 buffer second line appeared, corresponding to the\nstimulated low-frequency Raman scattering (SLFRS) on the breathing radial mode\nof TMV. SLFRS frequency shift by 2 cm-1, (60 GHz), conversion efficiency and\nthreshold are measured for the first time to the best of our knowledge.\n", "  In spite of the large amount of existing neural models in the literature,\nthere is a lack of a systematic review of the possible effect of choosing\ndifferent initial conditions on the dynamic evolution of neural systems. In\nthis short review we intend to give insights into this topic by discussing some\npublished examples. First, we briefly introduce the different ingredients of a\nneural dynamical model. Secondly, we introduce some concepts used to describe\nthe dynamic behavior of neural models, namely phase space and its portraits,\ntime series, spectra, multistability and bifurcations. We end with an analysis\nof the irreversibility of processes and its implications on the functioning of\nnormal and pathological brains.\n", "  We demonstrate theoretically that a new system quantum well can realize the\ntopological transition based on the 16-band kp model. Utilizing the strain\nintroduced by the doped impurities, the band anti crossing induced by the doped\nnitrogen and valence band anti crossing induced by the doped bismuth, the band\ngap of the quantum well is rapidly decreased and even becomes negative. As a\nresult, the topological transitions arise. Furthermore, the band gap as a\nfunction of the concentration of nitrogen and bismuth is calculated, where the\nnegative gap corresponds to the topological phase. Noting the cancel of strain\nresulting from the combination of tensile strain introduced by N and strain\nintroduced by Bi, we can easily tune the ratio of the N and Bi to meet the\nrequirement of strain in the crystal growth procedure. Our proposal provides a\npromising approach for topological insulator in traditional semiconductor\nsystem utilizing the semiconductor fabrication technologies.\n", "  Recent experiments indicate that static stripe-like charge order is generic\nto the hole-doped copper oxide superconductors and competes with\nsuperconductivity. Here we show that a similar type of charge order is present\nin La$_{5/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$CoO$_4$, an insulating analogue of the copper oxide\nsuperconductors containing cobalt in place of copper. The stripe phase we have\ndetected is accompanied by short-range, quasi-one-dimensional,\nantiferromagnetic order, and provides a natural explanation for the distinctive\nhourglass shape of the magnetic spectrum previously observed in neutron\nscattering measurements of La$_{5/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$CoO$_4$ and many hole-doped\ncopper oxide superconductors. The results establish a solid empirical basis for\ntheories of the hourglass spectrum built on short-range, quasi-static, stripe\ncorrelations.\n", "  The Chevalley-Eilenberg differential calculus and differential operators over\nN-graded commutative rings are constructed. This is a straightforward\ngeneralization of the differential calculus over commutative rings, and it is\nthe most general case of the differential calculus over rings that is not the\nnon-commutative geometry. Since any N-graded ring possesses the associated\nZ_2-graded structure, this also is the case of the graded differential calculus\nover Grassmann algebras and the supergeometry and field theory on graded\nmanifolds.\n", "  We investigate the behavior of a mixture of asymmetric colloidal dumbbells\nand emulsion droplets by means of kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. The\nevaporation of the droplets and the competition between droplet-colloid\nattraction and colloid-colloid interactions leads to the formation of clusters\nbuilt up of colloid aggregates with both closed and open structures. We find\nthat stable packings and hence complex colloidal structures can be obtained by\nchanging the relative size of the colloidal spheres and/or their interfacial\ntension with the droplets.\n", "  Brown dwarfs and giant planets orbiting close to a host star are subjected to\nsignificant irradiation that can modify the properties of their atmospheres. In\norder to test the atmospheric models that are used to describe these systems,\nit is necessary to obtain accurate observational estimates of their physical\nproperties (masses, radii, temperatures, albedos). Interacting compact binary\nsystems provide a natural laboratory for studying strongly irradiated\nsub-stellar objects. As the mass-losing secondary in these systems makes a\ncritical, but poorly understood transition from the stellar to the sub-stellar\nregime, it is also strongly irradiated by the compact accretor. In fact, the\ninternal and external energy fluxes are both expected to be comparable in these\nobjects, providing access to an unexplored irradiation regime. However, the\natmospheric properties of such donors have so far remained largely unknown.\nHere, we report the direct spectroscopic detection and characterisation of an\nirradiated sub-stellar donor in an accreting white dwarf binary system. Our\nnear-infrared observations allow us to determine a model-independent mass\nestimate for the donor of $M_2=0.055\\pm0.008M_{\\odot}$ and an average spectral\ntype of ${\\rm L1}\\pm{\\rm1}$, supporting both theoretical predictions and\nmodel-dependent observational constraints. Our time-resolved data also allow us\nto estimate the average irradiation-induced temperature difference between the\nday and night sides on the sub-stellar donor, $\\Delta{\\rm T}\\simeq57$~K, and\nthe maximum difference between the hottest and coolest parts of its surface, of\n$\\Delta{\\rm T}_{max}\\simeq200$~K. The observations are well described by a\nsimple geometric reprocessing model with a bolometric (Bond) albedo of\n$A_B<0.54$ at 2-$\\sigma$ confidence level, consistent with high reprocessing\nefficiency, but poor lateral heat redistribution in the donor's atmosphere.\n", "  We present the results of our intensive radio observing campaign of the dwarf\nnova SS Cyg during its 2010 April outburst. We argue that the observed radio\nemission was produced by synchrotron emission from a transient radio jet.\nComparing the radio light curves from previous and subsequent outbursts of this\nsystem (including high-resolution observations from outbursts in 2011 and 2012)\nshows that the typical long and short outbursts of this system exhibit\nreproducible radio outbursts that do not vary significantly between outbursts,\nwhich is consistent with the similarity of the observed optical, ultraviolet\nand X-ray light curves. Contemporaneous optical and X-ray observations show\nthat the radio emission appears to have been triggered at the same time as the\ninitial X-ray flare, which occurs as disk material first reaches the boundary\nlayer. This raises the possibility that the boundary region may be involved in\njet production in accreting white dwarf systems. Our high spatial resolution\nmonitoring shows that the compact jet remained active throughout the outburst\nwith no radio quenching.\n", "  We present a first-principles study of the large magneto-crystalline\nanisotropy in the intercalated di-chalcogenide material \\ce{Fe_{0.25}TaS_2},\ninvestigated with the DFT+U approach. We verify a uniaxial magnetocrystalline\nanisotropy energy(MAE) of 15meV/Fe. in the material. We further analyze the\ndependence of MAE on the constituent elements and the effect of spin-orbit\ncoupling. Contrary to conventional intuition, we find a small contribution to\nMAE due to strong spin-orbit coupling in the heavier element, Ta. We show that\nthe electronic configuration, crystal field environment and correlational\neffects of the magnetic ion are more important.\n", "  Lithium ion batteries (LIB) can feature reactive anodes that operate at low\npotentials, such as lithium metal or silicon, passivated by solid electrolyte\ninterphase (SEI) films. SEI is known to evolve over time as cycling proceeds.\nIn this modeling work, we focus on the stability of two main SEI components,\nlithium carbonate (Li2CO3) and lithium ethylene dicarbonate (LEDC). Both\ncomponents are electrochemically stable but thermodynamically unstable near the\nequilibrium Li+/Li(s) potential. Interfacial reactions represent one way to\ntrigger the intrinsic thermodynamic instability. Both Li(2)CO(3) and LEDC are\npredicted to exhibit exothermic reactions on lithium metal surfaces, and the\nbarriers are sufficiently low to permit reactions on battery operation time\nscales. LEDC also readily decomposes on high Li-content Li(x)Si surfaces. Our\nstudies suggest that the innermost SEI layer on lithium metal surfaces should\nbe a thin layer of Li(2)O -- the only thermodynamically and kinetically stable\ncomponent (in the absence of a fluoride source). This work should also be\nrelevant to inadvertant lithium plating during battery cycling, and SEI\nevolution on Li(x)Si surfaces.\n", "  We show the construction of the dual superconducting theory for the\nconfinement mechanism from QCD in the maximally abelian (MA) gauge using the\nlattice QCD Monte Carlo simulation. We find that essence of infrared abelian\ndominance is naturally understood with the off-diagonal gluon mass $m_{\\rm off}\n\\simeq 1.2 {\\rm GeV}$ induced by the MA gauge fixing. In the MA gauge, the\noff-diagonal gluon amplitude is forced to be small, and the off-diagonal gluon\nphase tends to be random. As the mathematical origin of abelian dominance for\nconfinement, we demonstrate that the strong randomness of the off-diagonal\ngluon phase leads to abelian dominance for the string tension. In the MA gauge,\nthere appears the macroscopic network of the monopole world-line covering the\nwhole system. We investigate the monopole-current system in the MA gauge by\nanalyzing the dual gluon field $B_\\mu$. We evaluate the dual gluon mass as $m_B\n= 0.4 \\sim$ 0.5GeV in the infrared region, which is the lattice-QCD evidence of\nthe dual Higgs mechanism by monopole condensation. Owing to infrared abelian\ndominance and infrared monopole condensation, QCD in the MA gauge is\ndescribable with the dual Ginzburg-Landau theory.\n", "  Advice is supplementary information that enhances the computational power of\nan underlying computation. This paper focuses on advice that is given in the\nform of a pure quantum state and examines the influence of such advice on the\nbehaviors of an underlying polynomial-time quantum computation with\nbounded-error probability.\n", "  This paper employs a powerful argument, called an algorithmic argument, to\nprove lower bounds of the quantum query complexity of a multiple-block ordered\nsearch problem in which, given a block number i, we are to find a location of a\ntarget keyword in an ordered list of the i-th block. Apart from much studied\npolynomial and adversary methods for quantum query complexity lower bounds, our\nargument shows that the multiple-block ordered search needs a large number of\nnonadaptive oracle queries on a black-box model of quantum computation that is\nalso supplemented with advice. Our argument is also applied to the notions of\ncomputational complexity theory: quantum truth-table reducibility and quantum\ntruth-table autoreducibility.\n", "  Since quantum information is continuous, its handling is sometimes\nsurprisingly harder than the classical counterpart. A typical example is\ncloning; making a copy of digital information is straightforward but it is not\npossible exactly for quantum information. The question in this paper is whether\nor not quantum network coding is possible. Its classical counterpart is another\ngood example to show that digital information flow can be done much more\nefficiently than conventional (say, liquid) flow.\n  Our answer to the question is similar to the case of cloning, namely, it is\nshown that quantum network coding is possible if approximation is allowed, by\nusing a simple network model called Butterfly. In this network, there are two\nflow paths, s_1 to t_1 and s_2 to t_2, which shares a single bottleneck channel\nof capacity one. In the classical case, we can send two bits simultaneously,\none for each path, in spite of the bottleneck. Our results for quantum network\ncoding include: (i) We can send any quantum state |psi_1> from s_1 to t_1 and\n|psi_2> from s_2 to t_2 simultaneously with a fidelity strictly greater than\n1/2. (ii) If one of |psi_1> and |psi_2> is classical, then the fidelity can be\nimproved to 2/3. (iii) Similar improvement is also possible if |psi_1> and\n|psi_2> are restricted to only a finite number of (previously known) states.\n(iv) Several impossibility results including the general upper bound of the\nfidelity are also given.\n"]}
