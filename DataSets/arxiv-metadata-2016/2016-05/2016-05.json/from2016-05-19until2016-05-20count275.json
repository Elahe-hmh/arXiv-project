"None", "None"], "abstract": ["  In the mesoscopic theory a distribution of different crack sizes and crack\norientations is introduced. A scalar damage parameter, a second order damage\ntensor and a vectorial damage parameter are defined in terms of this\ndistribution function. As an example of a constitutive quantity the free energy\ndensity is given as a function of the damage tensor. This equation is reduced\nin the uniaxial case to a function of the damage vector and in case of a\nspecial geometry to a function of the scalar damage parameter.\n", "  We model the transport of cosmic ray nuclei in the Galaxy by means of a new\nnumerical code. Differently from previous numerical models we account for a\ngeneric spatial distribution of the diffusion coefficient. We found that in the\ncase of radially uniform diffusion, the main secondary/primary ratios (B/C, N/O\nand sub-Fe/Fe) and the modulated antiproton spectrum match consistently the\navailable observations. Convection and re-acceleration do not seem to be\nrequired in the energy range we consider: $1 < E < 10^3$ GeV/nucleon. We\ngeneralize these results accounting for radial dependence of the diffusion\ncoefficient, which is assumed to trace that of the cosmic ray sources. While\nthis does not affect the prediction of secondary/primary ratios, the simulated\nlongitude profile of the diffuse $\\gamma$-ray emission is significantly\ndifferent from the uniform case and may agree with EGRET measurements without\ninvoking ad hoc assumptions on the galactic gas density distribution.\n", "  We study jammed configurations of hard spheres as a function of compression\nspeed using an event-driven molecular dynamics algorithm. We find that during\nthe compression, the pressure follows closely the metastable liquid branch\nuntil the system gets arrested into a glass state as the relaxation time\nexceeds the compression speed. Further compression yields a jammed\nconfiguration that can be regarded as the infinite pressure configuration of\nthat glass state. Consequently, we find that the density of jammed packings\nvaries from 0.638 to 0.658 for polydisperse hard spheres and from 0.635 to\n0.645 for pure hard spheres upon decreasing the compression rate. This\ndemonstrates that the density at which the systems falls out of equilibrium\ndetermines the density at which the system jams at infinite pressure. In\naddition, we give accurate data for the jamming density as a function of\ncompression rate and size polydispersity.\n", "  In this article, existence results concerning temporal functions with\nadditional properties on a globally hyperbolic manifold are obtained. These\nproperties are certain bounds on geometric quantities as lapse and shift. The\nresults are linked to completeness properties and the existence of closed\nisometric embeddings in Minkowski spaces.\n", "  We introduce and analyze a system of relativistic fermions in a space-time\ncontinuum, which interact via an action principle as previously considered in a\ndiscrete space-time. The model is defined by specifying the vacuum as a sum of\nDirac seas corresponding to several generations of elementary particles. The\nonly free parameters entering the model are the fermion masses. We find\ndynamical field equations if and only if the number of generations equals\nthree. In this case, the dynamics is described by a massive axial potential\ncoupled to the Dirac spinors. The coupling constant and the rest mass of the\naxial field depend on the regularization; for a given regularization method\nthey can be computed as functions of the fermion masses. The bosonic mass term\narises as a consequence of a symmetry breaking effect, giving an alternative to\nthe Higgs mechanism. In addition to the standard loop corrections of quantum\nfield theory, we find new types of correction terms to the field equations\nwhich violate causality. These non-causal corrections are too small for giving\nobvious contradictions to physical observations, but they might open the\npossibility to test the approach in future experiments.\n", "  What is the relationship between plausibility logic and the principle of\nmaximum entropy? When does the principle give unreasonable or wrong results?\nWhen is it appropriate to use the rule `expectation = average'? Can\nplausibility logic give the same answers as the principle, and better answers\nif those of the principle are unreasonable? To try to answer these questions,\nthis study offers a numerical collection of plausibility distributions given by\nthe maximum-entropy principle and by plausibility logic for a set of fifteen\nsimple problems: throwing dice.\n", "  Kinematic quantities for finite elastic and plastic deformations are defined\nvia an approach that does not rely on auxiliary elements like reference frame\nand reference configuration, and that gives account of the inertial-noninertial\naspects explicitly. These features are achieved by working on Galilean\nspacetime directly. The quantity expressing elastic deformations is introduced\naccording to its expected role: to measure how different the current metric is\nfrom the relaxed/stressless metric. Further, the plastic kinematic quantity is\nthe change rate of the stressless metric. The properties of both are analyzed,\nand their relationship to frequently used elastic and plastic kinematic\nquantities is discussed. One important result is that no objective elastic or\nplastic quantities can be defined from deformation gradient.\n", "  We propose a rigorous framework for Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) in which\nthe UQ objectives and the assumptions/information set are brought to the\nforefront. This framework, which we call \\emph{Optimal Uncertainty\nQuantification} (OUQ), is based on the observation that, given a set of\nassumptions and information about the problem, there exist optimal bounds on\nuncertainties: these are obtained as values of well-defined optimization\nproblems corresponding to extremizing probabilities of failure, or of\ndeviations, subject to the constraints imposed by the scenarios compatible with\nthe assumptions and information. In particular, this framework does not\nimplicitly impose inappropriate assumptions, nor does it repudiate relevant\ninformation. Although OUQ optimization problems are extremely large, we show\nthat under general conditions they have finite-dimensional reductions. As an\napplication, we develop \\emph{Optimal Concentration Inequalities} (OCI) of\nHoeffding and McDiarmid type. Surprisingly, these results show that\nuncertainties in input parameters, which propagate to output uncertainties in\nthe classical sensitivity analysis paradigm, may fail to do so if the transfer\nfunctions (or probability distributions) are imperfectly known. We show how,\nfor hierarchical structures, this phenomenon may lead to the non-propagation of\nuncertainties or information across scales. In addition, a general algorithmic\nframework is developed for OUQ and is tested on the Caltech surrogate model for\nhypervelocity impact and on the seismic safety assessment of truss structures,\nsuggesting the feasibility of the framework for important complex systems. The\nintroduction of this paper provides both an overview of the paper and a\nself-contained mini-tutorial about basic concepts and issues of UQ.\n", "  The maximal $U(1)_L$ supersymmetric inverse seesaw mechanism (M$L$SIS)\nprovides a natural way to relate asymmetric dark matter (ADM) with neutrino\nphysics. In this paper we point out that, M$L$SIS is a natural outcome if one\ndynamically realizes the inverse seesaw mechanism in the next-to minimal\nsupersymmetric standard model (NMSSM) via the dimension-five operator\n$(N)^2S^2/M_*$, with $S$ the NMSSM singlet developing TeV scale VEV; it\nslightly violates lepton number due to the suppression by the fundamental scale\n$M_*$, thus preserving $U(1)_L$ maximally. The resulting sneutrino is a\ndistinguishable ADM candidate, oscillating and favored to have weak scale mass.\nA fairly large annihilating cross section of such a heavy ADM is available due\nto the presence of singlet.\n", "  We consider the effective behaviour of a rate-independent process when it is\nplaced in contact with a heat bath. The method used to \"thermalize\" the process\nis an interior-point entropic regularization of the Moreau--Yosida incremental\nformulation of the unperturbed process. It is shown that the heat bath destroys\nthe rate independence in a controlled and deterministic way, and that the\neffective dynamics are those of a non-linear gradient descent in the original\nenergetic potential with respect to a different and non-trivial effective\ndissipation potential.\n", "  Recently, the rock mechanical and rock engineering designs and calculations\nare frequently based on Geological Strength Index (GSI) method, because it is\nthe only system that provides a complete set of mechanical properties for\ndesign purpose. Both the failure criteria and the deformation moduli of the\nrock mass can be calculated with GSI based equations, which consists of the\ndisturbance factor, as well. The aim of this paper is the sensitivity analysis\nof GSI and disturbance factor dependent equations that characterize the\nmechanical properties of rock masses. The survey of the GSI system is not our\npurpose. The results show that the rock mass strength calculated by the\nHoek-Brown failure criteria and both the Hoek-Diederichs and modified\nHoek-Diederichs deformation moduli are highly sensitive to changes of both the\nGSI and the D factor, hence their exact determination is important for the rock\nengineering design.\n", "  We analyze the causal action principle for a system of relativistic fermions\ncomposed of massive Dirac particles and neutrinos. In the continuum limit, we\nobtain an effective interaction described by a left-handed, massive SU(2) gauge\nfield and a gravitational field. The off-diagonal gauge potentials involve a\nunitary mixing matrix, which is similar to the Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata matrix in\nthe standard model.\n", "  We propose a composite layered structure for tunable, low-loss plasmon\nresonances, which con- sists of a noble-metal thin film coated in graphene and\nsupported on a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrate. We calculate electron\nenergy loss spectra (EELS) for these structures, and nu- merically demonstrate\nthat bulk plasmon losses in noble-metal films can be significantly reduced, and\nsurface coupling enhanced, through the addition of a graphene coating and the\nwide-bandgap hBN substrate. Silver films with a trilayer graphene coating and\nhBN substrate demonstrated sur- face plasmon-dominant spectral profiles for\nmetallic layers as thick as 34 nm. A continued-fraction expression for the\neffective dielectric function, based on a specular reflection model which\nincludes boundary interactions, is used to systematically demonstrate plasmon\npeak tunability for a variety of configurations. Variations include substrate,\nplasmonic metal, and individual layer thickness for each material. Mesoscale\ncalculation of EELS is performed with individual layer dielectric functions as\ninput to the effective dielectric function calculation, from which the loss\nspectra are directly determined.\n", "  In order to find the correct theory of quantum gravity, one has to look for\nobservational effects in any candidate theory. Here, we focus on canonical\nquantum gravity and calculate the quantum-gravitational contributions to the\nanisotropy spectrum of the cosmic microwave background that arise from a\nsemiclassical approximation to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. While the resulting\nmodification of the power spectrum at large scales is too weak to be\nobservable, we find an upper bound on the energy scale of inflation.\n", "  The dynamics of a spring-block train placed on a moving conveyor belt is\ninvestigated both by simple experiments and computer simulations. The first\nblock is connected by spring to an external static point, and due to the\ndragging effect of the belt the blocks undergo complex stick-slip dynamics. A\nqualitative agreement with the experimental results can only be achieved by\ntaking into account the spatial inhomogeneity of the friction force on the\nbelt's surface, modeled as noise. As a function of the velocity of the conveyor\nbelt and the noise strength, the system exhibits complex, self-organized\ncritical, sometimes chaotic dynamics and phase transition-like behavior. Noise\ninduced chaos and intermittency is also observed. Simulations suggest that the\nmaximum complexity of the dynamical states is achieved for a relatively small\nnumber of blocks, around five.\n", "  We consider the special and general relativistic extensions of the action\nprinciple behind the Schr\\\"odinger equation distinguishing classical and\nquantum contributions. Postulating a particular quantum correction to the\nsource term in the classical Einstein equation we identify the conformal\ncontent of the above action and obtain classical gravitation for massive\nparticles, but with a cosmological term representing off-mass-shell\ncontribution to the energy-momentum tensor. In this scenario the - on the\nPlanck scale surprisingly small - cosmological constant stems from quantum\nbound states (gravonium) having a Bohr radius $a$ as being \\Lambda=3/a^2.\n", "  We consider a finite volume method for a well-driven fluid flow in a porous\nmedium. Due to the singularity of the well, modeling in the near-well region\nwith standard numerical schemes results in a completely wrong total well flux\nand an inaccurate hydraulic head. Local grid refinement can help, but it comes\nat computational cost. In this article we propose two methods to address well\nsingularity. In the first method the flux through well faces is corrected using\na logarithmic function, in a way related to the Peaceman correction. Coupling\nthis correction with a second-order accurate two-point scheme gives a greatly\nimproved total well flux, but the resulting scheme is still not even first\norder accurate on coarse grids. In the second method fluxes in the near-well\nregion are corrected by representing the hydraulic head as a sum of a\nlogarithmic and a linear function. This scheme is second-order accurate.\n", "  L\\'{e}vy flight models whose jumps have infinite moments are mathematically\nused to describe the superdiffusion in complex systems. Exponentially tempering\nthe Levy measure of L\\'{e}vy flights leads to the tempered stable L\\'{e}vy\nprocesses which combine both the $\\alpha$-stable and Gaussian trends; and the\nvery large jumps are unlikely and all their moments exist. The probability\ndensity functions of the tempered stable L\\'{e}vy processes solve the tempered\nfractional diffusion equation. This paper focuses on designing the high order\ndifference schemes for the tempered fractional diffusion equation on bounded\ndomain. The high order difference approximations, called the tempered and\nweighted and shifted Gr\\\"{u}nwald difference (tempered-WSGD) operators, in\nspace are obtained by using the properties of the tempered fractional calculus\nand weighting and shifting their first order Gr\\\"{u}nwald type difference\napproximations. And the Crank-Nicolson discretization is used in the time\ndirection. The stability and convergence of the presented numerical schemes are\nestablished; and the numerical experiments are performed to confirm the\ntheoretical results and testify the effectiveness of the schemes.\n", "  We consider the ABC model on a ring in a strongly asymmetric regime. The main\nresult asserts that the particles almost always form three pure domains (one of\neach species) and that this segregated shape evolves, in a proper time scale,\nas a Brownian motion on the circle, which may have a drift. This is, to our\nknowledge, the first proof of a zero-temperature limit for a non-reversible\ndynamics whose invariant measure is not explicitly known.\n", "  Finite heat reservoir capacity and temperature fluctuations lead to\nmodification of the well known canonical exponential weight factor. Requiring\nthat the corrections least depend on the one-particle energy, we derive a\ndeformed entropy, K(S). The resulting formula contains the Boltzmann-Gibbs, the\nRenyi and the Tsallis formulas as particular cases. For extreme large\nfluctuations (compared to the Gaussian case) a new, parameter-free entropy -\nprobability relation emerges. This formula and the corresponding canonical\nequilibrium distribution are nearly Boltzmannian for high probability, but\ndeviate from the classical result for low probability. In the extreme large\nfluctuation limit the canonical distribution resembles for low probability the\ncumulative Gompertz distribution.\n", "  A spring-block chain placed on a running conveyor belt is considered for\nmodeling stylized facts observed in the dynamics of stock indexes. Individual\nstocks are modeled by the blocks, while the stock-stock correlations are\nintroduced via simple elastic forces acting in the springs. The dragging effect\nof the moving belt corresponds to the expected economic growth. The\nspring-block system produces collective behavior and avalanche like phenomena,\nsimilar to the ones observed in stock markets. An artificial index is defined\nfor the spring-block chain, and its dynamics is compared with the one measured\nfor the Dow Jones Industrial Average. For certain parameter regions the model\nreproduces qualitatively well the dynamics of the logarithmic index, the\nlogarithmic returns, the distribution of the logarithmic returns, the\navalanche-size distribution and the distribution of the investment horizons. A\nnoticeable success of the model is that it is able to account for the gain-loss\nasymmetry observed in the inverse statistics. Our approach has mainly a\npedagogical value, bridging between a complex socio-economic phenomena and a\nbasic (mechanical) model in physics.\n", "  The causal action principle is analyzed for a system of relativistic fermions\ncomposed of massive Dirac particles and neutrinos. In the continuum limit, we\nobtain an effective interaction described by classical gravity as well as the\nstrong and electroweak gauge fields of the standard model.\n", "  Electrons propagating in a magnetically ordered medium experience an\nadditional gauge field associated with the Berry phase of their spin following\nthe local magnetic texture. In contrast to the usual electromagnetic field,\nthis gauge field admits monopole excitations, corresponding to hedgehog defects\nof the magnetic order. In an insulator, these hedgehogs carry a well-defined\nelectric charge allowing for them to be controlled by electric fields. One\nparticularly robust mechanism that contributes to the charge is the orbital\nmagnetoelectric effect, captured by a $\\theta$ angle, which leads to a charge\nof $e\\theta/2\\pi$ on hedgehogs. This is a direct consequence of the Witten\neffect for magnetic monopoles in a $\\theta$ medium. A physical consequence is\nthat external electric fields can induce skyrmion crystal phases in insulating\nhelimagnets.\n", "  A key question in high temperature iron-based superconductivity is the\nmechanism by which the paired electrons minimize their strong mutual Coulomb\nrepulsion. While electronically paired superconductors generally avoid the\nCoulomb interaction through the formation of nodal, higher angular momentum\npairs, iron based superconductors appear to form singlet s-wave (s$^{\\pm}$)\npairs. By taking the orbital degrees of freedom of the iron atoms into account,\nhere we argue that the s$^{\\pm}$ state in these materials possesses internal\nd-wave structure, in which a relative d-wave ($L=2$) motion of the pairs\nentangles with the ($I=2$) internal angular momenta of the d-orbitals to form a\nlow spin $J=L+I=0$ singlet. We discuss how the recent observation of a nodal\ngap with octahedral structure in KFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$ can be understood as a high\nspin ($J=L+I=4$) configuration of the orbital and isospin angular momenta; the\nobserved pressure-induced phase transition into a fully gapped state can then\ninterpreted as a high-to-low spin phase transition of the Cooper pairs.\n", "  We establish several mathematical and computational properties of the nuclear\nnorm for higher-order tensors. We show that like tensor rank, tensor nuclear\nnorm is dependent on the choice of base field --- the value of the nuclear norm\nof a real 3-tensor depends on whether we regard it as a real 3-tensor or a\ncomplex 3-tensor with real entries. We show that every tensor has a nuclear\nnorm attaining decomposition and every symmetric tensor has a symmetric nuclear\nnorm attaining decomposition. There is a corresponding notion of nuclear rank\nthat, unlike tensor rank, is upper semicontinuous. We establish an analogue of\nBanach's theorem for tensor spectral norm and Comon's conjecture for tensor\nrank --- for a symmetric tensor, its symmetric nuclear norm always equals its\nnuclear norm. We show that computing tensor nuclear norm is NP-hard in several\nsense. Deciding weak membership in the nuclear norm unit ball of 3-tensors is\nNP-hard, as is finding an $\\varepsilon$-approximation of nuclear norm for\n3-tensors. In addition, the problem of computing spectral or nuclear norm of a\n4-tensor is NP-hard, even if we restrict the 4-tensor to be bi-Hermitian,\nbisymmetric, positive semidefinite, nonnegative valued, or all of the above. We\ndiscuss some simple polynomial-time approximation bounds. As an aside, we show\nthat the nuclear $(p,q)$-norm of a matrix is NP-hard in general but can be\ncomputed in polynomial-time if $p=1$, $q = 1$, or $p=q=2$, with closed-form\nexpressions for the nuclear $(1,q)$- and $(p,1)$-norms.\n", "  Weak values arise in quantum theory when the result of a weak measurement is\nconditioned on a subsequent strong measurement. The majority of the trials are\ndiscarded, leaving only very few successful events. Intriguingly those can\ndisplay a substantial signal amplification. This raises the question of whether\nweak values carry potential to improve the performance of quantum sensors, and\nindeed a number of impressive experimental results suggested this may be the\ncase. By contrast, recent theoretical studies have found the opposite: using\nweak-values to obtain an amplification generally worsens metrological\nperformance. This survey summarises the implications of those studies, which\ncall for a reappraisal of weak values' utility and for further work to\nreconcile theory and experiment.\n", "  Ferroelectrics are attractive candidate materials for environmentally\nfriendly solid state refrigeration free of greenhouse gases. Their thermal\nresponse upon variations of external electric fields is largest in the vicinity\nof their phase transitions, which may occur near room temperature. The\nmagnitude of the effect, however, is too small for useful cooling applications\neven when they are driven close to dielectric breakdown. Insight from\nmicroscopic theory is therefore needed to characterize materials and provide\nguiding principles to search for new ones with enhanced electrocaloric\nperformance. Here, we derive from well-known microscopic models of\nferroelectricity meaningful figures of merit which provide insight into the\nrelation between the strength of the effect and the characteristic interactions\nof ferroelectrics such as dipole forces. We find that the long range nature of\nthese interactions results in a small effect. A strategy is proposed to make it\nlarger by shortening the correlation lengths of fluctuations of polarization.\n", "  We study a family of non-C2-cofinite vertex operator algebras, called the\nsinglet vertex operator algebras, and connect several important concepts in the\ntheory of vertex operator algebras, quantum modular forms, and modular tensor\ncategories. More precisely, starting from explicit formulae for characters of\nmodules over the singlet vertex operator algebra, which can be expressed in\nterms of false theta functions and their derivatives, we first deform these\ncharacters by using a complex parameter {\\epsilon}. We then apply modular\ntrans- formation properties of regularised partial theta functions to study\nasymptotic behaviour of regularised characters of irreducible modules and\ncompute their regularised quantum dimensions. We also give a purely geometric\ndescription of the regularisation parameter as a uniformisation parameter of\nthe fusion variety coming from atypical blocks. It turns out that the quantum\ndimensions behave very differently depending on the sign of the real part of\n{\\epsilon}. The map from the space of characters equipped with the Verlinde\nproduct to the space of regularised quantum dimensions turns out to be a\ngenuine ring isomorphism for positive real part of {\\epsilon} while for\nsufficiently negative real part of {\\epsilon} its surjective image gives the\nfusion ring of a rational vertex operator algebra. The category of modules of\nthis rational vertex operator algebra should be viewed as obtained through the\nprocess of a semi-simplification procedure widely used in the theory of quantum\ngroups. Interestingly, the modular tensor category structure constants of this\nvertex operator algebra, can be also detected from vector valued quantum\nmodular forms formed by distinguished atypical characters.\n", "  We show asymptotic completeness for linear massive Dirac fields on the\nSchwarzschild-Anti-de Sitter spacetime. The proof is based on a Mourre\nestimate. We also construct an asymptotic velocity for this field.\n", "  Non-equilibrium thermodynamics with internal variables introduces a natural\nhierarchical arrangement of evolution equations. Three examples are shown: a\nhierarchy of linear constitutive equations in thermodynamic rhelogy with a\nsingle internal variable, a hierarchy of wave equations in the theory of\ngeneralized continua with dual internal variables and a hierarchical\narrangement of the Fourier equation in the theory of heat conduction with\ncurrent multipliers.\n", "  Arithmetic operations can be defined in various ways, even if one assumes\ncommutativity and associativity of addition and multiplication, and\ndistributivity of multiplication with respect to addition. In consequence,\nwhenever one encounters `plus' or `times' one has certain freedom of\ninterpreting this operation. This leads to some freedom in definitions of\nderivatives, integrals and, thus, practically all equations occurring in\nnatural sciences. A change of realization of arithmetic, without altering the\nremaining structures of a given equation, plays the same role as a symmetry\ntransformation. An appropriate construction of arithmetic turns out to be\nparticularly important for dynamical systems in fractal space-times. Simple\nexamples from classical and quantum, relativistic and nonrelativistic physics\nare discussed, including the eigenvalue problem for a quantum harmonic\noscillator. It is explained why the change of arithmetic is not equivalent to\nthe usual change of variables, and why it may have implications for the Bell\ntheorem.\n", "  We reconstruct the $\\Lambda$CDM model for $f(T,\\mathcal{T})$ Theory, where\n$T$ is the torsion scalar and $\\mathcal{T}$ the trace of the energy-momentum\ntensor. The result shows that the action of $\\Lambda$CDM is a combination of a\nlinear term, a constant ($-2\\Lambda$) and a non-linear term given by the\nproduct $\\sqrt{-T}F_g\\left[(T^{1/3}/16\\pi G)\\left(16\\pi\nG\\mathcal{T}+T+8\\Lambda\\right)\\right]$, with $F_g$ being a generic function. We\nshow that to maintain conservation of energy-momentum tensor should impose that\n$F_g[y]$ must be linear on the trace $\\mathcal{T}$. This reconstruction decays\nin the $f(T)$ Theory for $F_g\\equiv Q$, with $Q$ a constant. Our reconstruction\ndescribes the cosmological eras to the present time. The model present\nstability within the geometric and matter perturbations for the choice $F_g=y$,\nwhere $y=(T^{1/3}/16\\pi G)\\left(16\\pi G\\mathcal{T}+T+8\\Lambda\\right)$, except\nfor geometric part to de Sitter model. We impose the first and second laws of\nthermodynamics to the $\\Lambda$CDM and find the condition where they are\nsatisfied, that is, $T_A,G_{eff}>0$, however where this is not possible for\ncases where we choose, leading to a breakdown of positive entropy and\nMisner-Sharp energy.\n", "  Rate- and state-dependent friction law for velocity-step and healing are\nanalysed from a thermodynamic point of view. Assuming a logarithmic deviation\nfrom steady-state a unification of the classical Dieterich and Ruina models of\nrock friction is proposed.\n", "  A method of distributed calibration of a probe microscope scanner is\nsuggested which main idea consists in a search for a net of local calibration\ncoefficients (LCCs) in the process of automatic measurement of a standard\nsurface, whereby each point of the movement space of the scanner can be\ncharacterized by a unique set of scale factors. Feature-oriented scanning (FOS)\nmethodology is used as a basis for implementation of the distributed\ncalibration permitting to exclude in situ the negative influence of thermal\ndrift, creep and hysteresis on the obtained results. Possessing the calibration\ndatabase enables correcting in one procedure all the spatial distortions caused\nby nonlinearity, nonorthogonality and spurious crosstalk couplings of the\nmicroscope scanner piezomanipulators. To provide high precision of spatial\nmeasurements in nanometer range, the calibration is carried out using natural\nstandards - constants of crystal lattice. One of the useful modes of the\ndeveloped calibration method is a virtual mode. In the virtual mode, instead of\nmeasurement of a real surface of the standard, the calibration program makes a\nsurface image \"measurement\" of the standard, which was obtained earlier using\nconventional raster scanning. The application of the virtual mode permits\nsimulation of the calibration process and detail analysis of raster distortions\noccurring in both conventional and counter surface scanning. Moreover, the mode\nallows to estimate the thermal drift and the creep velocities acting while\nsurface scanning.\n", "  We address the near-collinear expansion of multiparticle NMHV amplitudes,\nnamely, the heptagon and octagons in the dual language of null polygonal super\nWilson loops. In particular, we verify multiparticle factorization of charged\npentagon transitions in terms of pentagons for single flux-tube excitations\nwithin the framework of refined operator product expansion. We find a perfect\nagreement with available tree and one-loop data.\n", "  Pathways-reduced analysis is one of the techniques used by the Fispact-II\nnuclear activation and transmutation software to study the sensitivity of the\ncomputed inventories to uncertainties in reaction cross-sections. Although\ndeciding which pathways are most important is very helpful in for example\ndetermining which nuclear data would benefit from further refinement,\npathways-reduced analysis need not necessarily define the most critical\nreaction, since one reaction may contribute to several different pathways. This\nwork examines three different techniques for ranking reactions in their order\nof importance in determining the final inventory, comparing the pathways based\nmetric (PBM), the direct method and one based on the Pearson correlation\ncoefficient. Reasons why the PBM is to be preferred are presented.\n", "  In this article we use real traffic data to confirm that vehicle velocities\nfollow Gaussian distribution in steady state traffic regimes (free-flow, and\ncongestion). We also show that in the transition between free-flow and\ncongestion, the velocity distribution is better modeled by generalized extreme\nvalue distribution (GEV). We study the effect of the different models on\nestimating the probability distribution of connectivity duration between\nvehicles in vehicular ad-hoc networks.\n", "  We investigate theoretically a Fano interferometer composed by STM and AFM\ntips close to a Kitaev dimer of superconducting adatoms, in which the adatom\nplaced under the AFM tip, encloses a pair of Majorana fermions (MFs). For the\nbinding energy $\\Delta$ of the Cooper pair delocalized into the adatoms under\nthe tips coincident with the tunneling amplitude $t$ between them, namely\n$\\Delta$ = $t$, we find that only one MF beneath the AFM tip hybridizes with\nthe adatom coupled to the STM tips. As a result, a gate invariance feature\nemerges: the Fano profile of the transmittance rises as an invariant quantity\ndepending upon the STM tips Fermi energy, due to the symmetric swap in the gate\npotential of the AFM tip.\n", "  We extend the nested sampling algorithm to simulate materials under periodic\nboundary and constant pressure conditions, and show how it can be used to\ndetermine the complete equilibrium phase diagram, for a given potential energy\nfunction, efficiently and in a highly automated fashion. The only inputs\nrequired are the composition and the desired pressure and temperature ranges,\nin particular, solid-solid phase transitions are recovered without any a priori\nknowledge about the structure of solid phases. We benchmark and showcase the\nalgorithm on the periodic Lennard-Jones system, aluminium and NiTi.\n", "  There is growing concern that blast-exposed individuals are at risk of\ndeveloping neurological disorders later in life. Therefore, it is important to\nunderstand the dynamic properties of blast forces on brain cells, including the\nendothelial cells that maintain the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which regulates\nthe passage of nutrients into the brain and protects it from toxins in the\nblood. To better understand the effect of shock waves on the BBB we have\ninvestigated an {\\em in vitro} model in which BBB endothelial cells are grown\nin transwell vessels and exposed in a shock tube, confirming that BBB integrity\nis directly related to shock wave intensity. It is difficult to directly\nmeasure the forces acting on these cells in the transwell container during the\nexperiments, and so a computational tool has been developed and presented in\nthis paper.\n  Two-dimensional axisymmetric Euler equations with the Tammann equation of\nstate were used to model the transwell materials, and a high-resolution finite\nvolume method based on Riemann solvers and the Clawpack software was used to\nsolve these equations in a mixed Eulerian/Lagrangian frame. Results indicated\nthat the geometry of the transwell plays a significant role in the observed\npressure time series in these experiments. We also found that pressures can\nfall below vapor pressure due to the interaction of reflecting and diffracting\nshock waves, suggesting that cavitation bubbles could be a damage mechanism.\nComputations that include a simulated hydrophone inserted in the transwell\nsuggest that the instrument itself could significantly alter blast wave\nproperties. These findings illustrate the need for further computational\nmodeling studies aimed at understanding possible blast-induced BBB damage.\n", "  We analyze the thermodynamical properties of black holes in a modified theory\nof gravity, which was initially proposed to obtain correct dynamics of galaxies\nand galaxy clusters without dark matter. The thermodynamics of non-rotating and\nrotating black hole solutions resembles similar solutions in Einstein-Maxwell\ntheory with the electric charge being replaced by a new mass dependent\ngravitational charge $Q = \\sqrt{\\alpha G_N}M$. This new mass dependent charge\nmodifies the effective Newtonian constant from $G_N$ to $G = G_N(1+\\alpha)$,\nand this in turn critically affects the thermodynamics of the black holes. We\nalso investigate the thermodynamics of regular solutions, and explore the\nlimiting case when no horizons forms. So, it is possible that the modified\ngravity can lead to the absence of black hole horizons in our universe.\nFinally, we analyze corrections to the thermodynamics of a non-rotating black\nhole and obtain the usual logarithmic correction term.\n", "  One of the most frustrating issues in early universe cosmology centers on how\nto reconcile the vast choice of universes in string theory and in its most\nplausible high energy sibling, eternal inflation, that jointly generate the\nstring landscape with the fine-tuned and hence relatively small number of\nuniverses that have undergone a large expansion and can accommodate observers\nand, in particular, galaxies. We show that such observations are highly favored\nfor any system whereby physical parameters are distributed at a high energy\nscale, due to the conservation of the Liouville measure and the gauge nature of\nvolume, asymptotically approaching a period of large isotropic expansion\ncharacterised by $w=-1$. Our interpretation predicts that all observational\nprobes for deviations from $w=-1$ in the foreseeable future are doomed to\nfailure. The purpose of this paper is not to introduce a new measure for the\nmultiverse, but rather to show how what is perhaps the most natural and well\nknown measure, volume weighting, arises as a consequence of the conservation of\nthe Liouville measure on phase space during the classical slow-roll expansion.\n", "  In the approach to the geometric quantization, based on the conversion of\nsecond-class constraints, we resolve the respective non-linear zero curvature\nconditions for the extended symplectic potential. From the zero curvature\nconditions, we deduce new, linear, equations for the extended symplectic\npotential. Then we show that being the linear equations satisfied, their\nsolution does certainly satisfy the non-linear zero curvature condition, as\nwell. Finally, we give the functional resolution to the new linear equations,\nand then deduce the respective path integral representation. We do our\nconsideration as to the general case of a phase superspace where both Boson and\nFermion coordinates are present on equal footing.\n", "  The theory of causal fermion systems is an approach to describe fundamental\nphysics. We here introduce the mathematical framework and give an overview of\nthe objectives and current results.\n", "  In order to obtain robust cosmological constraints from Type Ia supernova (SN\nIa) data, we have applied Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to SN Ia lightcurve\nfitting. We develop a method for sampling the resultant probability density\ndistributions (pdf) of the SN Ia lightcuve parameters in the MCMC likelihood\nanalysis to constrain cosmological parameters, and validate it using simulated\ndata sets. Applying this method to the Joint Lightcurve Analysis (JLA) data set\nof SNe Ia, we find that sampling the SN Ia lightcurve parameter pdf's leads to\ncosmological parameters closer to that of a flat Universe with a cosmological\nconstant, compared to the usual practice of using only the best fit values of\nthe SN Ia lightcurve parameters. Our method will be useful in the use of SN Ia\ndata for precision cosmology.\n", "  Complex networks theory has commonly been used for modelling and\nunderstanding the interactions taking place between the elements composing\ncomplex systems. More recently, the use of generative models has gained\nmomentum, as they allow identifying which forces and mechanisms are responsible\nfor the appearance of given structural properties. In spite of this interest,\nseveral problems remain open, one of the most important being the design of\nrobust mechanisms for finding the optimal parameters of a generative model,\ngiven a set of real networks. In this contribution, we address this problem by\nmeans of Probabilistic Constraint Programming. By using as an example the\nreconstruction of networks representing brain dynamics, we show how this\napproach is superior to other solutions, in that it allows a better\ncharacterisation of the parameters space, while requiring a significantly lower\ncomputational cost.\n", "  The implementation of logical operations on polarization-encoded x-rays via\nresonant light-nucleus interactions is theoretically investigated. We show that\nby means of resonant scattering off nuclei and fast rotations of the nuclear\nhyperfine magnetic field to control the polarization of the output photon,\nsingle-qubit logical gates can be simulated. A second control qubit may be\nemployed to trigger the magnetic field rotation, thus allowing several\nimplementation choices for a controlled NOT gate for x-ray photons.\n", "  The arrow of time and the accelerated expansion are two fundamental empirical\nfacts of the Universe. We advance the viewpoint that the dark energy (positive\ncosmological constant) accelerating the expansion of the Universe also supports\nthe time asymmetry. It is related to the decay of meta-stable states under\ngeneric perturbations, as we show on example of a microcanonical ensemble.\nThese states will not be meta-stable without dark energy. The latter also\nensures a hyperbolic motion leading to dynamic entropy production with the rate\ndetermined by the cosmological constant.\n", "  We consider a model of modified gravity from the nonperturbative quantization\nof a metric. We obtain the modified gravitational field equations and the\nmodified conservational equations. We apply it to the FLRW spacetime and find\nthat due to the quantum fluctuations a bounce universe can be obtained and a\ndecelerated expansion can also possibly be obtained in a dark energy dominated\nepoch. We also discuss the effects of quantum fluctuations on inflation\nparameters (such as slow-roll parameters, spectral index, and the spectrum of\nthe primordial curvature perturbation) and find values of parameters in the\ncomparing the predictions of inflation can also work to drive the current epoch\nof acceleration. We obtain the constraints on the parameter of the theory from\nthe observation of the big bang nucleosynthesis.\n", "  It has been proved that the charged stringy black holes are stable under the\nperturbations of massive charged scalar fields. However, superradiant\ninstability can be generated by adding the mirror-like boundary condition to\nthe composed system of charged stringy black hole and scalar field. The\nunstable boxed quasinormal modes have been calculated by using both analytical\nand numerical method. In this paper, we further provide a time domain analysis\nby performing a long time evolution of charged scalar field configuration in\nthe background of the charged stringy black hole with the mirror-like boundary\ncondition imposed. We have used the ingoing Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates\nto derive the evolution equation, and adopted Pseudo-spectral method and the\nforth-order Runge-Kutta method to evolve the scalar field with the initial\nGaussian wave packet. It is shown by our numerical scheme that Fourier\ntransforming the evolution data coincides well with the unstable modes computed\nfrom frequency domain analysis. The existence of the rapid growth mode makes\nthe charged stringy black hole a good test ground to study the nonlinear\ndevelopment of superradiant instability.\n", "  We report heat pulse experiments at room temperature that cannot be described\nby Fourier's law. The experimental data is modelled properly by the\nGuyer--Krumhansl equation, in its over-diffusion regime. The phenomenon is due\nto conduction channels with differing conductivities, and parallel to the\ndirection of the heat flux.\n", "  We have investigated temperature-dependent electronic structures of Na2IrO3\nto unravel its insulating nature. Employing the combined scheme of the\ndensity-functional theory (DFT) and the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT), we\nhave shown that the insulating state persists even above the Neel temperature\n(T_{N}), which reveals that Na2IrO3 is classified into a Mott-type insulator.\nThe measured photoemission spectrum in the paramagnetic (PM) state is well\ndescribed by the electronic structure obtained from the DFT+DMFT for the\ninsulating state above T_{N}. The analysis of optical conductivity, however,\nsuggests that the non-local correlation effect is also important in Na2IrO3.\nTherefore, Na2IrO3 is not to be a standard Mott insulator in that the extended\nnature and the non-local correlation effect of Ir 5d electrons are important as\nwell in describing its electronic and magnetic properties.\n", "  Observables which discriminate boosted topologies from massive QCD jets are\nof great importance for the success of the jet substructure program at the\nLarge Hadron Collider. Such observables, while both widely and successfully\nused, have been studied almost exclusively with Monte Carlo simulations. In\nthis paper we present the first all-orders factorization theorem for a\ntwo-prong discriminant based on a jet shape variable, $D_2$, valid for both\nsignal and background jets. Our factorization theorem simultaneously describes\nthe production of both collinear and soft subjets, and we introduce a novel\nzero-bin procedure to correctly describe the transition region between these\nlimits. By proving an all orders factorization theorem, we enable a\nsystematically improvable description, and allow for precision comparisons\nbetween data, Monte Carlo, and first principles QCD calculations for jet\nsubstructure observables. Using our factorization theorem, we present numerical\nresults for the discrimination of a boosted $Z$ boson from massive QCD\nbackground jets. We compare our results with Monte Carlo predictions which\nallows for a detailed understanding of the extent to which these generators\naccurately describe the formation of two-prong QCD jets, and informs their\nusage in substructure analyses. Our calculation also provides considerable\ninsight into the discrimination power and calculability of jet substructure\nobservables in general.\n", "  Evanescent and tightly confined propagating waves exhibit a remarkable\ntransverse spin density since the longitudinal component of the electric field\nis not negligible. In this work, we obtain via numerical simulations the\nelectric field components of the fundamental guided modes of two waveguides\ntypically used in silicon photonics: the strip and the slot waveguide. We\nobtain the relation between transverse and longitudinal field components, the\ntransverse spin densities and other important parameters, such as the\nlongitudinal component of the so-called Belinfante spin momentum density. By\nasymmetrically placing a circularly-polarized point-like dipole source in\nregions showing local circular polarization, the guided mode is excited\nunidirectionally via spin-orbit coupling. In contrast to metal plates\nsupporting surface plasmons, the multimode behavior of silicon waveguides\nresults in different spin-orbit coupling properties for each guided mode. Our\nresults may find application in silicon photonic devices, integrated quantum\noptics and polarization manipulation at the nanoscale.\n", "  We argue that large fluctuations in the saturation momentum are necessary to\nexplain the ATLAS and ALICE data on pA collisions measured at the LHC. Using a\nform for the distribution of fluctuations motivated by theoretical studies of\nthe non-linear evolution equations for the Color Glass Condensate, we find a\nremarkably good agreement between theory and the measured distributions. If the\nsaturation momentum fluctuates, we argue that the cross section for a proton\nprobe should also fluctuate, consistent with previous observations. Finally we\ndiscuss these results and their possible consistency with what is known about\nmultiplicity fluctuations in such collisions, and attempts to describe the\nridge effect from properties of the initial state.\n", "  A quantum annealer heuristically minimizes quadratic unconstrained binary\noptimization (QUBO) problems, but is limited by the physical hardware in the\nsize and density of the problems it can handle. We have developed a\nmeta-heuristic solver that utilizes D-Wave Systems' quantum annealer (or any\nother QUBO problem optimizer) to solve larger or denser problems, by\niteratively solving subproblems, while keeping the rest of the variables fixed.\nWe present our algorithm, several variants, and the results for the\noptimization of standard QUBO problem instances from OR-Library of sizes 500\nand 2500 as well as the Palubeckis instances of sizes 3000 to 7000. For\npractical use of the solver, we show the dependence of the time to best\nsolution on the desired gap to the best known solution. In addition, we study\nthe dependence of the gap and the time to best solution on the size of the\nproblems solved by the underlying optimizer.\n", "  In this work we take a critical look at the available data on the flyby\nanomaly and on the current limitations of attempts to develop an explanation.\nWe aim to verify how conservative corrections to gravity could affect the\nhyperbolic trajectories of Earth flybys. We use ungravity-inspired potentials\nas illustrative examples and show how the resulting orbital simulations differ\nfrom the observed anomaly. We also get constraints on the model parameters from\nthe observed flyby velocity shifts. The conclusion is that no kind of\nconservative potential can be the cause of the flyby anomaly.\n", "  It is understood that molecular conjugation plays an important role in charge\ntransport through single-molecule junctions. Here, we investigate electron\ntransport through an anthraquinone based single-molecule three-terminal device.\nWith the use of an electric-field induced by a gate electrode, the molecule is\nreduced resulting into a ten-fold increase in the off-resonant differential\nconductance. Theoretical calculations link the change in differential\nconductance to a reduction-induced change in conjugation, thereby lifting\ndestructive interference of transport pathways.\n", "  Quantum-critical states of diverse strongly correlated systems are predicted\nto feature universal collision-dominated transport resembling that of viscous\nfluids. However, investigation of these phenomena has been hampered by the lack\nof known macroscopic signatures of the hydrodynamic regime at criticality. Here\nwe identify vorticity as such a signature and link it with an easily verifiable\nstriking macroscopic transport behavior. Produced by the viscous flow,\nvorticity can drive electric current against an applied field, resulting in a\nnegative nonlocal voltage. We argue that the latter may play the same role for\nthe viscous regime as zero electrical resistance does for superconductivity.\nBesides offering a diagnostic of viscous transport which distinguishes it from\nohmic currents, the sign-changing electrical response affords a robust tool for\ndirectly measuring the viscosity-to-resistivity ratio. The strongly interacting\nelectron-hole plasma in high-mobility graphene provides a bridge between\nquantum-criticality and the wealth of fluid mechanics phenomena.\n", "  We demonstrate that graphene placed on top of structured substrates offers a\nnovel approach for trapping and guiding surface plasmons. A monolayer graphene\nwith a spatially varying curvature exhibits an effective trapping potential for\ngraphene plasmons near curved areas such as bumps, humps and wells. We derive\nthe governing equation for describing such localized channel plasmons guided by\ncurved graphene and validate our theory by the first-principle numerical\nsimulations. The proposed confinement mechanism enables plasmon guiding by the\nregions of maximal curvature, and it offers a versatile platform for\nmanipulating light in planar landscapes. In addition, isolated deformations of\ngraphene such as bumps are shown to support localized surface modes and\nresonances suggesting a new way to engineer plasmonic metasurfaces.\n", "  We employ high-resolution N-body simulations of isolated spiral galaxy\nmodels, from low-amplitude, multi-armed galaxies to Milky Way-like disks, to\nestimate the vertical action of ensembles of stars in an axisymmetric\npotential. In the multi-armed galaxy the low-amplitude arms represent tiny\nperturbations of the potential, hence the vertical action for a set of stars is\nconserved, although after several orbital periods of revolution the\nconservation degrades significantly. For a Milky Way-like galaxy with vigorous\nspiral activity and the formation of a bar, our results show that the potential\nis far from steady, implying that the action is not a constant of motion.\nFurthermore, because of the presence of high-amplitude arms and the bar,\nconsiderable in-plane and vertical heating occurs that forces stars to deviate\nfrom near-circular orbits, reducing the degree at which the actions are\nconserved for individual stars, in agreement with previous results, but also\nfor ensembles of stars. If confirmed, this result has several implications,\nincluding the assertion that the thick disk of our Galaxy forms by radial\nmigration of stars, under the assumption of the conservation of the action\ndescribing the vertical motion of stars.\n", "  The observational data on the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background\nconstraints the scalar spectral tilt $n_s$ and the tensor to scalar ratio $r$\nwhich depend on the first and second derivatives of the inflaton potential. The\ninformation can be used to reconstruct the inflaton potential in the polynomial\nform up to some orders. However, for some classes of potentials, $n_s$ and $r$\nbehave as $n_s(N)$ and $r(N)$ universally in terms of the number of e-folds\n$N$. The universal behaviour of $n_s(N)$ can be used to reconstruct a class of\ninflaton potentials. By parametrizing one of the parameters $n_s(N)$,\n$\\epsilon(N)$ and $\\phi(N)$, and fitting the parameters in the models to the\nobservational data, we obtain the constraints on the parameters and reconstruct\nthe classes of the inflationary models which include the chaotic inflation,\nT-model, hilltop inflation, s-dual inflation, natural inflation and $R^2$\ninflation.\n", "  Accurate treatment of the long-range electron correlation energy, including\nvan der Waals (vdW) or dispersion interactions, is essential for describing the\nstructure, dynamics, and function of a wide variety of systems. Among the most\naccurate models for including dispersion into density functional theory (DFT)\nis the range-separated many-body dispersion (MBD) method [A. Ambrossetti et\nal., J. Chem. Phys. 140, 18A508 (2014)], in which the correlation energy is\nmodeled at short-range by a semi-local density functional and at long-range by\na model system of coupled quantum harmonic oscillators. In this work, we\ndevelop analytical gradients of the MBD energy with respect to nuclear\ncoordinates, including all implicit coordinate dependencies arising from the\npartitioning of the charge density into Hirshfeld effective volumes. To\ndemonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of these MBD gradients for geometry\noptimizations of systems with intermolecular and intramolecular interactions,\nwe optimized conformers of the benzene dimer and isolated small peptides with\naromatic side-chains. We find excellent agreement with the wavefunction theory\nreference geometries of these systems (at a fraction of the computational cost)\nand find that MBD consistently outperforms the popular TS and D3(BJ) dispersion\ncorrections. To demonstrate the performance of the MBD model on a larger system\nwith supramolecular interactions, we optimized the C$_{60}$@C$_{60}$H$_{28}$\nbuckyball catcher host-guest complex. Finally, we find that neglecting the\nimplicit nuclear coordinate dependence arising from the charge density\npartitioning, as has been done in prior numerical treatments, leads to an\nunacceptable error in the MBD forces, with relative errors of ~20% (on average)\nthat can extend well beyond 100%.\n", "  Light stops consistent with the Higgs boson mass of $\\sim126\\,{\\rm GeV}$ are\ninvestigated within the framework of minimal supergravity. It is shown that\nmodels with light stops which are also consistent with the thermal relic\ndensity constraints require stop coannihilation with the neutralino LSP. The\nanalysis shows that the residual set of parameter points with light stops\nsatisfying both the Higgs mass and the relic density constraints lie within a\nseries of thin strips in the $m_0-m_{1/2}$ plane for different values of\n$A_0/m_0$. Consequently, this region of minimal supergravity parameter space\nmakes a number of very precise predictions. It is found that light stops of\nmass down to 400~GeV or lower can exist consistent with all constraints. A\nsignal analysis for this class of models at LHC RUN-II is carried out and the\ndominant signals for their detection identified. Also computed is the minimum\nintegrated luminosity for $5\\sigma$ discovery of the models analyzed. If\nsupersymmetry is realized in this manner, the stop masses can be as low as\n400~GeV or lower, and the mass gap between the lightest neutralino and lightest\nstop will be approximately 30-40~GeV. We have optimized the ATLAS signal\nregions specifically for stop searches in the parameter space and find that a\nstop with mass $\\sim 375\\,{\\rm GeV}$ can be discovered with as little as $\\sim$\n60~fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity at RUN-II of the LHC; the integrated\nluminosity needed for discovery could be further reduced with more efficient\nsignature analyses. The direct detection of dark matter in this class of models\nis also discussed. It is found that dark matter cross sections lie close to,\nbut above, coherent neutrino scattering and would require multi-ton detectors\nsuch as LZ to see a signal of dark matter for this class of models.\n", "  Cerium hexaboride is a cubic f-electron heavy-fermion compound that displays\na rich array of low-temperature magnetic ordering phenomena which have been the\nsubject of investigation for more than 50 years. Its complex behaviour is the\nresult of competing interactions, with both itinerant and local electrons\nplaying important roles. Investigating this material has proven to be a\nsubstantial challenge, in particular because of the appearance of a\n\"magnetically hidden order\" phase, which remained elusive to neutron-scattering\ninvestigations for many years. It was not until the development of modern x-ray\nscattering techniques that the long suspected multipolar origin of this phase\nwas confirmed. Doping with non-magnetic lanthanum dilutes the magnetic cerium\nsublattice and reduces the f-electron count, bringing about substantial changes\nto the ground state with the emergence of new phases and quantum critical\nphenomena. To this day, Ce(1-x)La(x)B6 and its related compounds remain a\nsubject of intense interest. Despite the substantial progress in understanding\ntheir behaviour, they continue to reveal new and unexplained physical\nphenomena. Here we present a review of the accumulated body of knowledge on\nthis family of materials in order to provide a firm standpoint for future\ninvestigations.\n", "  The security proof of continuous variable (CV) measurement device independent\n(MDI) quantum key distribution (QKD) cannot be reduced to the analysis of\none-mode Gaussian attacks (in particular, independent entangling-cloner\nattacks). To stress this point, the present note provides a very simple (almost\ntrivial) argument, showing that there are an infinite number of two-mode\nGaussian attacks which cannot be reduced to or simulated by one-mode Gaussian\nattacks. This result further confirms that the security analysis of CV-MDI-QKD\nmust involve a careful minimization over two-mode attacks as originally\nperformed in [S. Pirandola et al., Nature Photon. 9, 397-402 (2015)].\n", "  We suggest to use the Hall-Littlewood version of Rosso-Jones formula to\ndefine the germs of $p$-adic HOMFLY-PT polynomials for torus knots $[m,n]$,\nwhich possess at least the $[m,n] \\longleftrightarrow [n,m]$ topological\ninvariance. This calls for generalizations to other knot families and is a\nchallenge for several branches of modern theory.\n", "  Unconventional phases often occur where two competing mechanisms compensate.\nAn excellent example is the ionic Hubbard model where the alternating local\npotential $\\delta$, favoring a band insulator (BI), competes with the local\nrepulsion $U$, favoring a Mott insulator (MI). By continuous unitary\ntransformations we derive effective models in which we study the softening of\nvarious excitons. The softening signals the instability towards new phases that\nwe describe on the mean-field level. On increasing $U$ from the BI in two\ndimensions, we find a bond-ordered phase breaking orientational symmetry due to\na d-wave component. Then, antiferromagnetic order appears coexisting with the\nd-wave bond order. Finally, the d-wave order vanishes and a N\\'eel-type MI\npersists.\n", "  Elastic proton-proton collisions represent probably the greatest ensemble of\navailable measured data, the analysis of which may provide large amount of new\nphysical results concerning fundamental particles. It is, however, necessary to\nanalyze first some conclusions concerning pp collisions and their\ninterpretations differing fundamentally from our common macroscopic experience.\nIt has been argued, e.g., that elastic hadron collisions have been more central\nthan inelastic ones, even if any explanation of the existence of so different\nprocess, i.e., elastic and inelastic (with hundreds of secondary particles)\ncollisions, under the same conditions has not been given until now. The given\nconclusion has been based on a greater number of simplifying mathematical\nassumptions (done already in earlier calculations), without their influence on\nphysical interpretation being analyzed and entitled; the corresponding\ninfluence has started to be studied in the approach based on eikonal model. The\npossibility of peripheral interpretation of elastic collisions will be\ndemonstrated and corresponding results summarized. The arguments will be given\nwhy no preference may be given to the mentioned centrality against the standard\nperipheral behaviour. The corresponding discussion of contemporary description\nof elastic hadronic collision in dependence on impact parameter will be\nsummarized and the justification of some important assumptions will be\nconsidered.\n", "  We present a simple, and robust method for writing long period fiber gratings\nwith low polarization dependent losses. Our method is based on utilizing\nmechanical vibrations of the tapered fiber while pooling it. Our method enables\nreal-time tunability of the periodicity, efficiency and length of the grating.\nWe also demonstrate complex grating by writing multiple gratings\nsimultaneously. Finally, we utilized the formation of the gratings in different\nfiber diameters to investigate the Young's modulus of the fiber.\n", "  The lack of clarity of various mode-coupling theory (MCT) approximations,\neven in equilibrium,makes it hard to understand the relation between various\nMCT approaches for sheared steady states as well as their regime of validity.\nHere we try to understand these approximations indirectly by deriving the MCT\nequations through two different approaches for a colloidal system under shear,\nfirst, through a microscopic approach, as suggested by Zaccarelli et al, and\nsecond, through fluctuating hydrodynamics, where the approximations used in the\nderivation are quite clear. The qualitative similarity of our theory with a\nnumber of existing theories show that linear response theory might play a role\nin various approximations employed in deriving those theories and one needs to\nbe careful while applying them for systems arbitrarily far away from\nequilibrium, such as a granular system or when shear is very strong. As a\nbyproduct of our calculation, we obtain the extension of Yvon-Born-Green (YBG)\nequation for a sheared system and under the assumption of random-phase\napproximation, the YBG equation yields the distorted structure factor that was\nearlier obtained through different approaches.\n", "  We report the discovery of KELT-14b and KELT-15b, two hot Jupiters from the\nKELT-South survey. KELT-14b, an independent discovery of the recently announced\nWASP-122b, is an inflated Jupiter mass planet that orbits a\n$\\sim5.0^{+0.3}_{-0.7}$ Gyr, $V$ = 11.0, G2 star that is near the main sequence\nturnoff. The host star, KELT-14 (TYC 7638-981-1), has an inferred mass\n$M_{*}$=$1.18_{-0.07}^{+0.05}$$M_{\\odot}$ and radius\n$R_{*}$=$1.37\\pm{-0.08}$$R_{\\odot}$, and has $T_{eff}$=$5802_{-92}^{+95}$K,\n$\\log{g_*}$=$4.23_{-0.04}^{+0.05}$ and =$0.33\\pm{0.09}$. The planet orbits with\na period of $1.7100588 \\pm 0.0000025$ days ($T_{0}$=2457091.02863$\\pm$0.00047)\nand has a radius R$_{p}$=$1.52_{-0.11}^{+0.12}$$R_{J}$ and mass\nM$_{p}$=$1.196\\pm0.072$$M_{J}$, and the eccentricity is consistent with zero.\nKELT-15b is another inflated Jupiter mass planet that orbits a $\\sim$\n$4.6^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$ Gyr, $V$ = 11.2, G0 star (TYC 8146-86-1) that is near the\n\"blue hook\" stage of evolution prior to the Hertzsprung gap, and has an\ninferred mass $M_{*}$=$1.181_{-0.050}^{+0.051}$$M_{\\odot}$ and radius\n$R_{*}$=$1.48_{-0.04}^{+0.09}$$R_{\\odot}$, and $T_{eff}$=$6003_{-52}^{+56}$K,\n$\\log{g_*}$=$4.17_{-0.04}^{+0.02}$ and [Fe/H]=$0.05\\pm0.03$. The planet orbits\non a period of $3.329441 \\pm 0.000016$ days ($T_{0}$ = 2457029.1663$\\pm$0.0073)\nand has a radius R$_{p}$=$1.443_{-0.057}^{+0.11}$$R_{J}$ and mass\nM$_{p}$=$0.91_{-0.22}^{+0.21}$$M_{J}$ and an eccentricity consistent with zero.\nKELT-14b has the second largest expected emission signal in the K-band for\nknown transiting planets brighter than $K<10.5$. Both KELT-14b and KELT-15b are\npredicted to have large enough emission signals that their secondary eclipses\nshould be detectable using ground-based observatories.\n", "  The Virasoro algebra determines all `graviton' matrix elements in\nAdS$_3$/CFT$_2$. We study the explicit exchange of any number of Virasoro\ngravitons between heavy and light CFT$_2$ operators at large central charge.\nThese graviton exchanges can be written in terms of new on-shell tree diagrams,\norganized in a perturbative expansion in $h_H/c$, the heavy operator dimension\ndivided by the central charge. The Virasoro vacuum conformal block, which is\nthe sum of all the tree diagrams, obeys a differential recursion relation\ngeneralizing that of the Catalan numbers. We use this recursion relation to sum\nthe on-shell diagrams to all orders, computing the Virasoro vacuum block.\nExtrapolating to large $h_H/c$ determines the Hawking temperature of a BTZ\nblack hole in dual AdS$_3$ theories.\n", "  Determining and analyzing the spectra of graphs is an important and exciting\nresearch topic in theoretical computer science. The eigenvalues of the\nnormalized Laplacian of a graph provide information on its structural\nproperties and also on some relevant dynamical aspects, in particular those\nrelated to random walks. In this paper, we give the spectra of the normalized\nLaplacian of iterated subdivisions of simple connected graphs. As an example of\napplication of these results we find the exact values of their multiplicative\ndegree-Kirchhoff index, Kemeny's constant and number of spanning trees.\n", "  Randomized benchmarking is a widely used experimental technique to\ncharacterize the average error of quantum operations. Benchmarking procedures\nthat scale to enable characterization of $n$-qubit circuits rely on efficient\nprocedures for manipulating those circuits and, as such, have been limited to\nsubgroups of the Clifford group. However, universal quantum computers require\nadditional, non-Clifford gates to approximate arbitrary unitary\ntransformations. We define a scalable randomized benchmarking procedure over\n$n$-qubit unitary matrices that correspond to protected non-Clifford gates for\na class of stabilizer codes. We present efficient methods for representing and\ncomposing group elements, sampling them uniformly, and synthesizing\ncorresponding $\\mathrm{poly}(n)$-sized circuits. The procedure provides\nexperimental access to two independent parameters that together characterize\nthe average gate fidelity of a group element.\n", "  Cilia and flagella often exhibit synchronized behavior; this includes phase\nlocking, as seen in {\\it Chlamydomonas}, and metachronal wave formation in the\nrespiratory cilia of higher organisms. Since the observations by Gray and\nRothschild of phase synchrony of nearby swimming spermatozoa, it has been a\nworking hypothesis that synchrony arises from hydrodynamic interactions between\nbeating filaments. Recent work on the dynamics of physically separated pairs of\nflagella isolated from the multicellular alga {\\it Volvox} has shown that\nhydrodynamic coupling alone is sufficient to produce synchrony. However, the\nsituation is more complex in unicellular organisms bearing few flagella. We\nshow that flagella of {\\it Chlamydomonas} mutants deficient in filamentary\nconnections between basal bodies display markedly different synchronization\nfrom the wild type. We perform micromanipulation on configurations of flagella\nand conclude that a mechanism, internal to the cell, must provide an additional\nflagellar coupling. In naturally occurring species with 4, 8, or even 16\nflagella, we find diverse symmetries of basal body positioning and of the\nflagellar apparatus that are coincident with specific gaits of flagellar\nactuation, suggesting that it is a competition between intracellular coupling\nand hydrodynamic interactions that ultimately determines the precise form of\nflagellar coordination in unicellular algae.\n", "  Mechanical oscillators which respond to radiation pressure are a promising\nmeans of transferring quantum information between light and matter.\nOptical--mechanical state swaps are a key operation in this setting. Existing\nproposals for optomechanical state swap interfaces are only effective in the\nresolved sideband limit. Here, we show that it is possible to fully and\ndeterministically exchange mechanical and optical states outside of this limit,\nin the common case that the cavity linewidth is larger than the mechanical\nresonance frequency. This high-bandwidth interface opens up a significantly\nlarger region of optomechanical parameter space, allowing generation of\nnon-classical motional states of high-quality, low-frequency mechanical\noscillators.\n", "  Single Particle Tracking (SPT) can aid in understanding complex\nspatio-temporal processes. However, quantifying diffusivity and forces from\nindividual live cell trajectories is complicated by inter- & intra-trajectory\nkinetic heterogeneity, thermal fluctuations, and statistical temporal\ndependence inherent to the underlying molecule's time correlated confined\ndynamics experienced in the cell. Experimental artifacts such as localization\nuncertainty and motion blur also obscure the data. We introduce a new maximum\nlikelihood estimation (MLE) technique that decouples the above noise sources\nand systematically treats temporal correlation via a likelihood function\n(permitting more reliable extraction of effective forces from position vs. time\ndata). Our estimator is demonstrated to be consistent over a wide range of\nexposure times, diffusion coefficients, and confinement \"radii\". The algorithm\nand corresponding software can reliably extract motion parameters independent\nof exposure time in trajectories exhibiting confined and/or non-stationary\ndynamics and will aid in directly comparing trajectories obtained from\ndifferent imaging modalities.\n", "  In this work we present two new closures for the spherical harmonics (PN)\nmethod in slab geometry transport problems. Our approach begins with an\nanalysis of the squared-residual of the transport equation where we show that\nthe standard truncation and diffusive closures do not minimize the residual of\nthe PN expansion. Based on this analysis we derive two models, a moment-limited\ndiffusive MLDN closure and a transient PN (TPN) closure that attempt to address\nshortcomings of common closures. The form of these closures is similar to\nflux-limiters for diffusion with the addition of a time-derivative in the\ndefinition of the closure. Numerical results on a pulsed plane source problem,\nthe Gordian knot of slab-geometry transport problems, indicate that our new\nclosure outperforms existing linear closures. Additionally, on a deep\npenetration problem we demonstrate that the TPN closure does not suffer from\nthe artificial shocks that can arise in the MN entropy-based closure. Finally,\nresults for Reed's problem demonstrate that the TPN solution is as accurate as\nthe PN+3 solution. We further extend the TPN closure to 2D Cartesian geometry.\nThe line source test problem demonstrates the model effectively damps\noscillations and negative densities\n", "  Gluon distributions of colliding hadrons saturate as a result of the\nnon-linear evolution equations of QCD. As a consequence there exists the so\ncalled saturation momentum, which is related to the gluon density per unit\nrapidity per transverse area. When saturation momentum is the only scale for\nphysical processes, different observables exhibit geometrical scaling (GS). We\nshow a number of examples of GS and its violation in different reactions.\n", "  Entanglement is a resource to overcome the natural restriction of operations\nused for state manipulation to Local Operations assisted by Classical\nCommunication (LOCC). Hence, a bipartite maximally entangled state is a state\nwhich can be transformed deterministically into any other state via LOCC. In\nthe multipartite setting no such state exists. There, rather a whole set, the\nMaximally Entangled Set of states (MES), which we recently introduced, is\nrequired. This set has on the one hand the property that any state outside of\nthis set can be obtained via LOCC from one of the states within the set and on\nthe other hand, no state in the set can be obtained from any other state via\nLOCC. Recently, we studied LOCC transformations among pure multipartite states\nand derived the MES for 3- and generic 4-qubit states. Here, we consider the\nnon-generic 4-qubit states and analyze their properties regarding local\ntransformations. We prove that most SLOCC classes show a similar behavior as\nthe generic states, however we also identify three classes with very distinct\nproperties. The first consists of the GHZ and W class, where any state can be\ntransformed into some other state non-trivially. In particular, there exists no\nisolation. On the other hand, there also exist classes where all states are\nisolated. Last but not least we identify an additional class of states, whose\ntransformation properties differ drastically from all the other classes. Our\ninvestigations do not only identify the most relevant classes of states for\nLOCC entanglement manipulation, but also reveal new insight into the\nsimilarities and differences between separable and LOCC transformations and\nenable the investigation of LOCC transformations among arbitrary four qubit\nstates.\n", "  The anisotropies of the B-mode polarization in the cosmic microwave\nbackground radiation play a crucial role for the study of the very early\nUniverse. However, in the real observation, the mixture of the E-mode and\nB-mode can be caused by the partial sky surveys, which must be separated before\napplied to the cosmological explanation. The separation method developed by\nSmith (\\citealt{PhysRevD.74.083002}) has been widely adopted, where the edge of\nthe top-hat mask should be smoothed to avoid the numerical errors. In this\npaper, we compare three different smoothing methods, and investigate the\nleakage residuals of the E-B mixture. We find that, if the less information\nloss is needed and the smaller region is smoothed in the analysis, the\n\\textit{sin}- and \\textit{cos}-smoothing methods are better. However, if we\nneed a clean constructed B-mode map, the larger region around the mask edge\nshould be smoothed. In this case, the \\textit{Gaussian}-smoothing method\nbecomes much better. In addition, we find that the leakage caused by the\nnumerical errors in the \\textit{Gaussian}-smoothing method mostly concentrates\non two bands, which is quite easy to be reduced for the further E-B\nseparations.\n", "  We propose a set of boundary terms for higher spin theories in AdS$_3$ that\nlead to a well-defined variational principle compatible with Dirichlet boundary\nconditions for the metric and higher spin fields. These boundary terms are\nvalid for higher spin theories in the Fefferman-Graham gauge and they allow us\nto compute the canonical free energy of higher spin black holes directly from\nthe Euclidean, covariant, on-shell action. Using these results we reproduce the\nthermodynamics of the higher spin black hole of Ammon, Gutperle, Kraus, and\nPerlmutter and comment on the corresponding theory of induced $\\cal{W}$-gravity\nat the boundary.\n", "  The free energetics of water density fluctuations near a surface, and the\nrare low-density fluctuations in particular, serve as reliable indicators of\nsurface hydrophobicity; the easier it is to displace the interfacial waters,\nthe more hydrophobic the underlying surface. However, characterizing the free\nenergetics of such rare fluctuations requires computationally expensive,\nnon-Boltzmann sampling methods like umbrella sampling. This inherent\ncomputational expense associated with umbrella sampling makes it challenging to\ninvestigate the role of polarizability or electronic structure effects in\ninfluencing interfacial fluctuations. Importantly, it also limits the size of\nthe volume, which can be used to probe interfacial fluctuations. The latter can\nbe particularly important in characterizing the hydrophobicity of large\nsurfaces with molecular-level heterogeneities, such as those presented by\nproteins. To overcome these challenges, here we present a method for the sparse\nsampling of water density fluctuations, which is roughly two orders of\nmagnitude more efficient than umbrella sampling. We employ thermodynamic\nintegration to estimate the free energy differences between biased ensembles,\nthereby circumventing the umbrella sampling requirement of overlap between\nadjacent biased distributions. Further, a judicious choice of the biasing\npotential allows such free energy differences to be estimated using short\nsimulations, so that the free energetics of water density fluctuations are\nobtained using only a few, short simulations. Leveraging the efficiency of the\nmethod, we characterize water density fluctuations in the entire hydration\nshell of the protein, ubiquitin; a large volume containing an average of more\nthan six hundred waters.\n", "  By introducing the concept of \\emph{Kato control pairs} for a given\nRiemannian minimal heat kernel, we prove that on every Riemannian manifold\n$(M,g)$ the Kato class $\\mathcal{K}(M,g)$ has a subspace of the form\n$\\mathsf{L}^q(M,d\\varrho)$, where $\\varrho$ has a continuous density with\nrespect to the volume measure $\\mu_g$ (where $q$ depends on $\\dim(M)$). Using a\nlocal parabolic $\\mathsf{L}^1$-mean value inequality, we prove the existence of\nsuch densities for every Riemannian manifold, which in particular implies\n$\\mathsf{L}^q_{loc}(M)\\subset\\mathcal{K}_{loc}(M,g)$. Based on previously\nestablished results, the latter local fact can be applied to the question of\nessential self-adjointness of Schr\\\"odinger operators with singular magnetic\nand electric potentials. Finally, we also provide a Kato criterion in terms of\nminimal Riemannian submersions.\n", "  We introduce a system of stacked two-dimensional electron and hole gas layers\nwith Rashba spin orbit interaction and show that the tunnel coupling between\nthe layers induces a strong three- dimensional (3D) topological insulator\nphase. At each of the two-dimensional bulk boundaries we find the spectrum\nconsisting of a single anistropic Dirac cone, which we show by analytical and\nnumerical calculations. Our setup has a unit-cell consisting of four tunnel\ncoupled Rashba layers and presents a synthetic strong 3D topological insulator\nand is distinguished by its rather high experimental feasibility.\n", "  We construct ensembles of random integrable matrices with any prescribed\nnumber of nontrivial integrals and formulate integrable matrix theory (IMT) --\na counterpart of random matrix theory (RMT) for quantum integrable models. A\ntype-M family of integrable matrices consists of exactly N-M independent\ncommuting N-by-N matrices linear in a real parameter. We first develop a\nrotationally invariant parametrization of such matrices, previously only\nconstructed in a preferred basis. For example, an arbitrary choice of a vector\nand two commuting Hermitian matrices defines a type-1 family and vice versa.\nHigher types similarly involve a random vector and two matrices. The\nbasis-independent formulation allows us to derive the joint probability density\nfor integrable matrices, in a manner similar to the construction of Gaussian\nensembles in the RMT.\n", "  These lectures notes are based on courses given at National Taiwan\nUniversity, National Chiao-Tung University, and National Tsing Hua University\nin the spring term of 2015. Although the course was offered primarily for\ngraduate students, these lecture notes have been prepared for a more general\naudience. They are intended as an introduction to conformal field theories in\nvarious dimensions, with applications related to topics of particular interest:\ntopics include the conformal bootstrap program, boundary conformal field\ntheory, and applications related to the AdS/CFT correspondence. We assume the\nreader to be familiar with quantum mechanics at the graduate level and to have\nsome basic knowledge of quantum field theory. Familiarity with string theory is\nnot a prerequisite for this lectures, although it can only help.\n", "  We present detailed calculations for quantum-gravitational corrections to the\npower spectra of gauge-invariant scalar and tensor perturbations during\ninflation. This is done by performing a semiclassical Born-Oppenheimer type of\napproximation to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, from which we obtain a\nSchroedinger equation with quantum-gravitational correction terms. As a first\nstep, we perform our calculation for a de Sitter universe and find that the\ncorrection terms lead to an enhancement of power on the largest scales.\n", "  The consistency of the spin correlation strength in top quark pair production\nwith the standard model (SM) prediction is tested in the muon + jets final\nstate. The events are selected from pp collisions, collected by the CMS\ndetector, at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, corresponding to an integrated\nluminosity of 19.7 inverse femtobarns. The data are compared with the\nexpectation for the spin correlation predicted by the SM and with the\nexpectation of no correlation. Using a template fit method, the fraction of\nevents that show SM spin correlations is measured to be 0.72 +/- 0.08 (stat)\n+0.15 -0.13 (syst), representing the most precise measurement of this quantity\nin the lepton + jets final state to date.\n", "  We present the MATLAB code Spirality, a novel method for measuring spiral arm\npitch angles by fitting galaxy images to spiral templates of known pitch.\nComputation time is typically on the order of 2 minutes per galaxy, assuming at\nleast 8 GB of working memory. We tested the code using 117 synthetic spiral\nimages with known pitches, varying both the spiral properties and the input\nparameters. The code yielded correct results for all synthetic spirals with\ngalaxy-like properties. We also compared the code's results to two-dimensional\nFast Fourier Transform (2DFFT) measurements for the sample of nearby galaxies\ndefined by DMS PPak. Spirality's error bars overlapped 2DFFT's error bars for\n26 of the 30 galaxies. The two methods' agreement correlates strongly with\ngalaxy radius in pixels and also with i-band magnitude, but not with redshift,\na result that is consistent with at least some galaxies' spiral structure being\nfully formed by z=1.2, beyond which there are few galaxies in our sample. The\nSpirality code package also includes GenSpiral, which produces FITS images of\nsynthetic spirals, and SpiralArmCount, which uses a one-dimensional Fast\nFourier Transform to count the spiral arms of a galaxy after its pitch is\ndetermined. The code package is freely available online; see Comments for URL.\n", "  To uniformly determine the properties of supernova remnants (SNRs) at high\nenergies, we have developed the first systematic survey at energies from 1 to\n100 GeV using data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope. Based on the spatial\noverlap of sources detected at GeV energies with SNRs known from radio surveys,\nwe classify 30 sources as likely GeV SNRs. We also report 14 marginal\nassociations and 245 flux upper limits. A mock catalog in which the positions\nof known remnants are scrambled in Galactic longitude, allows us to determine\nan upper limit of 22% on the number of GeV candidates falsely identified as\nSNRs. We have also developed a method to estimate spectral and spatial\nsystematic errors arising from the diffuse interstellar emission model, a key\ncomponent of all Galactic Fermi LAT analyses. By studying remnants uniformly in\naggregate, we measure the GeV properties common to these objects and provide a\ncrucial context for the detailed modeling of individual SNRs. Combining our GeV\nresults with multiwavelength (MW) data, including radio, X-ray, and TeV,\ndemonstrates the need for improvements to previously sufficient, simple models\ndescribing the GeV and radio emission from these objects. We model the GeV and\nMW emission from SNRs in aggregate to constrain their maximal contribution to\nobserved Galactic cosmic rays.\n", "  We challenge the hypothesis that the ground states of a physical system whose\ndegeneracy depends on topology must necessarily realize topological quantum\norder and display non-local entanglement. To this end, we introduce and study a\nclassical rendition of the Toric Code model embedded on Riemann surfaces of\ndifferent genus numbers. We find that the minimal ground state degeneracy (and\nthose of all levels) depends on the topology of the embedding surface alone. As\nthe ground states of this classical system may be distinguished by local\nmeasurements, a characteristic of Landau orders, this example illustrates that\ntopological degeneracy is not a sufficient condition for topological quantum\norder. This conclusion is generic and, as shown, it applies to many other\nmodels. We also demonstrate that certain lattice realizations of these models,\nand other theories, display a ground state entropy (and those of all levels)\nthat is \"holographic\", i.e., extensive in the system boundary. We find that\nclock and $U(1)$ gauge theories display topological (in addition to gauge)\ndegeneracies.\n", "  In this work we study a 3-state opinion formation model considering two\ndistinct mechanisms, namely independence and conviction. Independence is\nintroduced in the model as a noise, by means of a probability of occurrence\n$q$. On the other hand, conviction acts as a disorder in the system, and it is\nintroduced by two discrete probability distributions. We analyze the effects of\nsuch two mechanisms on the phase transitions of the model, and we found that\nthe critical exponents are universal over the order-disorder frontier,\npresenting the same universality class of the mean-field Ising model. In\naddition, for one of the probability distributions the transition may be\neliminated for a wide range of the parameters.\n", "  Loop quantum cosmology in (b, v) variables, which is governed by a unit step\nsize difference equation, is embedded into a full theory context based on\nsimilar variables. A full theory context here means a theory of quantum gravity\narrived at using the quantisation techniques used in loop quantum gravity,\nhowever based on a different choice of elementary variables and classical gauge\nfixing suggested by loop quantum cosmology. From the full theory perspective,\nthe symmetry reduction is characterised by the vanishing of certain phase space\nfunctions which are implemented as operator equations in the quantum theory.\nThe loop quantum cosmology dynamics arise as the action of the full theory\nHamiltonian on maximally coarse states in the kernel of the reduction\nconstraints. An application of this reduction procedure to spherical symmetry\nis also sketched, with similar results, but only one canonical pair in (b, v)\nform.\n", "  We report on a measurement of thermal neutrons, generated by the hadronic\ncomponent of extensive air showers (EAS), by means of a small array of\nEN-detectors developed for the PRISMA project (PRImary Spectrum Measurement\nArray), novel devices based on a compound alloy of ZnS(Ag) and $^{6}$LiF. This\narray has been operated within the ARGO-YBJ experiment at the high altitude\nCosmic Ray Observatory in Yangbajing (Tibet, 4300 m a.s.l.). Due to the tight\ncorrelation between the air shower hadrons and thermal neutrons, this technique\ncan be envisaged as a simple way to estimate the number of high energy hadrons\nin EAS. Coincident events generated by primary cosmic rays of energies greater\nthan 100 TeV have been selected and analyzed. The EN-detectors have been used\nto record simultaneously thermal neutrons and the air shower electromagnetic\ncomponent. The density distributions of both components and the total number of\nthermal neutrons have been measured. The correlation of these data with the\nmeasurements carried out by ARGO-YBJ confirms the excellent performance of the\nEN-detector.\n", "  Social norms have traditionally been difficult to quantify. In any particular\nsociety, their sheer number and complex interdependencies often limit a\nsystem-level analysis. One exception is that of the network of norms that\nsustain the online Wikipedia community. We study the fifteen-year evolution of\nthis network using the interconnected set of pages that establish, describe,\nand interpret the community's norms. Despite Wikipedia's reputation for\n\\textit{ad hoc} governance, we find that its normative evolution is highly\nconservative. The earliest users create norms that both dominate the network\nand persist over time. These core norms govern both content and interpersonal\ninteractions using abstract principles such as neutrality, verifiability, and\nassume good faith. As the network grows, norm neighborhoods decouple\ntopologically from each other, while increasing in semantic coherence. Taken\ntogether, these results suggest that the evolution of Wikipedia's norm network\nis akin to bureaucratic systems that predate the information age.\n", "  We investigate the Michel-type accretion onto a static spherically symmetric\nblack hole. Using a Hamiltonian dynamical approach, we show that the standard\nmethod employed for tackling the accretion problem has masked some properties\nof the fluid flow. We determine new analytical solutions that are neither\ntransonic nor supersonic as the fluid approaches the horizon(s); rather, they\nremain subsonic for all values of the radial coordinate. Moreover, the three\nvelocity vanishes and the pressure diverges on the horizon(s), resulting in a\nflowout of the fluid under the effect of its own pressure. This is in favor of\nan earlier prediction that pressure-dominant regions form near the horizon.\nThis result does not depend on the form of the metric and it applies to a\nneighborhood of any horizon where the time coordinate is timelike. For anti-de\nSitter-like $\\text{f}(R)$ black holes we discuss the stability of the critical\nflow and determine separatrix heteroclinic orbits. For de Sitter-like\n$\\text{f}(R)$ black holes, we construct polytropic cyclic, non-homoclinic,\nphysical flows connecting the two horizons. These flows become non-relativistic\nfor Hamiltonian values higher than the critical value allowing for a good\nestimate of the proper period of the flow.\n", "  GaAs/Fe$_{3}$Si core/shell nanowire structures were fabricated by\nmolecular-beam epitaxy on oxidized Si(111) substrates and investigated by\nsynchrotron x-ray diffraction. The surfaces of the Fe$_3$Si shells exhibit\nnanofacets. These facets consist of well pronounced Fe$_3$Si{111} planes.\nDensity functional theory reveals that the Si-terminated Fe$_3$Si{111} surface\nhas the lowest energy in agreement with the experimental findings. We can\nanalyze the x-ray diffuse scattering and diffraction of the ensemble of\nnanowires avoiding the signal of the substrate and poly-crystalline films\nlocated between the wires. Fe$_3$Si nanofacets cause streaks in the x-ray\nreciprocal space map rotated by an azimuthal angle of 30{\\deg} compared with\nthose of bare GaAs nanowires. In the corresponding TEM micrograph the facets\nare revealed only if the incident electron beam is oriented along\n[1$\\overline{1}$0] in accordance with the x-ray results. Additional maxima in\nthe x-ray scans indicate the onset of chemical reactions between Fe$_{3}$Si\nshells and GaAs cores occurring at increased growth temperatures.\n", "  Squeezed states of spin systems are an important entangled resource for\nquantum technologies, particularly quantum metrology and sensing. Here we\nconsider the generation of spin squeezed states by interacting the spins with a\ndissipative ancillary system. We show that spin squeezing can be generated in\nthis model by two different mechanisms: one-axis twisting and driven collective\nrelaxation. We can interpolate between the two mechanisms by simply adjusting\nthe detuning between the dissipative ancillary system and the spin system.\nInterestingly, we find that for both mechanisms, ancillary system dissipation\nneed not be considered an imperfection in our model, but plays a positive role\nin spin squeezing. To assess the feasibility of spin squeezing we consider two\ndifferent implementations with superconducting circuits. We conclude that it is\nexperimentally feasible to generate a squeezed state of hundreds of spins\neither by one-axis twisting or by driven collective relaxation.\n", "  We derive the full perturbative equations of motion for the most general\nbackground solutions in ghost-free bimetric theory in its metric formulation.\nClever field redefinitions at the level of fluctuations enable us to circumvent\nthe problem of varying a square-root matrix appearing in the theory. This\ngreatly simplifies the expressions for the linear variation of the bimetric\ninteraction terms. We show that these field redefinitions exist and are\nuniquely invertible if and only if the variation of the square-root matrix\nitself has a unique solution, which is a requirement for the linearised theory\nto be well-defined. As an application of our results we examine the constraint\nstructure of ghost-free bimetric theory at the level of linear equations of\nmotion for the first time. We identify a scalar combination of equations which\nis responsible for the absence of the Boulware-Deser ghost mode in the theory.\nThe bimetric scalar constraint is in general not manifestly covariant in its\nnature. However, in the massive gravity limit the constraint assumes a\ncovariant form when one of the interaction parameters is set to zero. For that\ncase our analysis provides an alternative and almost trivial proof of the\nabsence of the Boulware-Deser ghost. Our findings generalise previous results\nin the metric formulation of massive gravity and also agree with studies of its\nvielbein version.\n", "  We construct new families of vector orthogonal polynomials that have the\nproperty to be eigenfunctions of some differential operator. They are\nextensions of the Hermite and Laguerre polynomial systems. A third family,\nwhose first member has been found by Y. Ben Cheikh and K. Douak is also\nconstructed. The ideas behind our approach lie in the studies of bispectral\noperators. We exploit automorphisms of associative algebras which transform\nelementary vector orthogonal polynomial systems which are eigenfunctions of a\ndifferential operator into other systems of this type.\n", "  We observe the quantum Zeno effect -- where the act of measurement slows the\nrate of quantum state transitions -- in a superconducting qubit using linear\ncircuit quantum electrodynamics readout and a near-quantum-limited following\namplifier. Under simultaneous strong measurement and qubit drive, the qubit\nundergoes a series of quantum jumps between states. These jumps are visible in\nthe experimental measurement record and are analyzed using maximum likelihood\nestimation to determine qubit transition rates. The observed rates agree with\nboth analytical predictions and numerical simulations. The analysis methods are\nsuitable for processing general noisy random telegraph signals.\n", "  We explore mechanisms of interferences under which the spin-independent\ninteraction in the scattering of scalar dark matter with nucleus is suppressed.\nWe offer a detailed derivation of the nuclear amplitudes based on the\ninteractions with quarks in the framework of a nonuniversal $U(1)'$ extension\nof the standard model. By assuming a range of parameters compatible with\ncollider searches, electroweak observables and dark matter abundance, we find\nscenarios for destructive interferences with and without isospin symmetry. The\nmodel reveals solutions with mutually interfering scalar particles, canceling\nthe effective spin-independent coupling with only scalar interactions, which\nrequires an extra Higgs boson with mass $M_{H}>125$ GeV. The model also\npossesses scenarios with only vector interactions through two neutral gauge\nbosons, $Z$ and $Z'$. Due to the nonuniversality of the $U(1)'$ symmetry, we\ndistinguish two family structures of the quark sector with different numerical\npredictions. In one case, we obtain cross sections that pass all the\nXenon-based detector experiments. In the other case, limits from LUX experiment\nenclose an exclusion region for dark matter between $9$ and $800$ GeV. We\nexamine a third scenario with isospin-violating couplings where interferences\nbetween scalar and vector boson exchanges cancel the scattering. We provide\nsolutions where interactions with Xenon-based detectors is suppressed for light\ndark matter, below $6$ GeV, while interactions with Germanium- and\nSilicon-based detectors exhibit solutions up to the regions of interest for\npositive signals reported by CoGeNT and CDMS-Si experiments, and compatible\nwith the observed DM relic density for DM mass in the range $8.3-10$ GeV.\nSpin-dependent interactions become the dominant source of scattering around the\ninterference regions, where Maxwellian speed distribution is considered.\n", "  As neutrinoless double-beta decay experiments become more sensitive and\nintrinsic radioactivity in detector materials is reduced, previously minor\ncontributions to the background must be understood and eliminated. With this in\nmind, cosmogenic backgrounds have been studied with the EXO-200 experiment.\nUsing the EXO-200 TPC, the muon flux (through a flat horizontal surface)\nunderground at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) has been measured to be\n{\\Phi} = 4.07 $\\pm$ 0.14 (sys) $\\pm$ 0.03 (stat) $\\times$ $10^{-7}$cm$^{-2}$\ns$^{-1}$, with a vertical intensity of $I_{v}$ = 2.97$^{+0.14}_{-0.13}$ (sys)\n$\\pm$ 0.02 (stat) $\\times$ $10^{-7}$cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$. Simulations\nof muon-induced backgrounds identified several potential cosmogenic\nradionuclides, though only 137Xe is a significant background for the 136Xe\n0{\\nu}{\\beta}{\\beta} search with EXO-200. Muon-induced neutron backgrounds were\nmeasured using {\\gamma}-rays from neutron capture on the detector materials.\nThis provided a measurement of 137Xe yield, and a test of the accuracy of the\nneutron production and transport simulations. The independently measured rates\nof 136Xe neutron capture and of 137Xe decay agree within uncertainties. Geant4\nand FLUKA simulations were performed to estimate neutron capture rates, and\nthese estimates agreed to within ~40% or better with measurements. The ability\nto identify 136Xe(n,{\\gamma}) events will allow for rejection of 137Xe\nbackgrounds in future 0{\\nu}{\\beta}{\\beta} analyses.\n", "  We study a model of spin-1 dark matter which interacts with the Standard\nModel predominantly via exchange of Higgs bosons. We propose an alternative UV\ncompletion to the usual Vector Dark Matter Higgs Portal, in which vector-like\nfermions charged under SU(2)$_W \\times$ U(1)$_Y$ and under the dark gauge\ngroup, U(1)$^\\prime$, generate an effective interaction between the Higgs and\nthe dark matter at one loop. We explore the resulting phenomenology and show\nthat this dark matter candidate is a viable thermal relic and satisfies Higgs\ninvisible width constraints as well as direct detection bounds.\n", "  We provide the latest constraints on the power spectra of both scalar and\ntensor perturbations from the CMB data (including \\textit{Planck}~2015, BICEP2\n\\& \\textit{Keck Array} experiments) and the new BAO scales from SDSS-III BOSS\nobservation. We find that the inflation model with a convex potential is not\nfavored and both the inflation model with a monomial potential and the natural\ninflation model are marginally disfavored at around $95\\%$ confidence level.\nBut both the Brane inflation model and the Starobinsky inflation model fit the\ndata quite well.\n", "  We calculate the coherent and incoherent production of $J/\\psi$ in PbPb\nultraperipheral collisions. The production of $J/\\psi$ in ultraperipheral\ncollsions is product of photon flux distributions and cross section of\nphoton-nucleus scatterings. The distributions of photon flux is computed in\nlight-cone perturbation theory and the cross section of photon-nucleus\nscatterings is calculated in dipole model, we assume that the two gluons\nexchange contribution is the coherent cross section and the large-$N_c$\ncontribution is the incoherent cross section in photon-nucleus scattering. The\nnumerical result of the rapidity distributions of $J/\\psi$ production in PbPb\nultraperipheral collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$TeV are compared with the\nexperimental data measured by the ALICE collaboration.\n", "  Utilizing a coarse-graining method to convert hadronic transport simulations\nof Au+Au collisions at SIS energies into local temperature, baryon and pion\ndensities, we compute the pertinent radiation of thermal dileptons based on an\nin-medium $\\rho$ spectral function that describes available spectra at\nultrarelativistic collision energies. In particular, we analyze how far the\nresulting yields and slopes of the invariant-mass spectra can probe the\nlifetime and temperatures of the fireball. We find that dilepton radiation sets\nin after the initial overlap phase of the colliding nuclei of about 7 fm/c, and\nlasts for about 13 fm/c. This duration closely coincides with the development\nof the transverse collectivity of the baryons, thus establishing a direct\ncorrelation between hadronic collective effects and thermal EM radiation, and\nsupporting a near local equilibration of the system. This fireball \"lifetime\"\nis substantially smaller than the typical 20-30 fm/c that naive considerations\nof the density evolution alone would suggest. We furthermore find that the\ntotal dilepton yield radiated into the invariant-mass window of $M=0.3-0.7$\nGeV/$c^{2}$, normalized to the number of charged pions, follows a relation to\nthe lifetime found earlier in the (ultra-) relativistic regime of heavy-ion\ncollisions, and thus corroborates the versatility of this tool. The spectral\nslopes of the invariant-mass spectra above the $\\phi$ mass provide a\nthermometer of the hottest phases of the collision, and agree well with the\nmaximal temperatures extracted from the coarse-grained hadron spectra.\n", "  The maximum size of a bound cosmic structure is computed perturbatively as a\nfunction of its mass in the framework of the cubic galileon, proposed recently\nto model the dark energy of our Universe. Comparison of our results with\nobservations constrains the matter-galileon coupling of the model to\n$0.033\\lesssim \\alpha \\lesssim 0.17$, thus improving previous bounds based\nsolely on solar system physics.\n", "  The combination of $\\nu_\\mu$-$\\nu_\\tau$ exchange together with CP conjugation\nin the neutrino sector (known as $\\mathrm{CP}^{\\mu\\tau}$ symmetry or\n$\\mu\\tau$-reflection) is known to predict the viable pattern:\n$\\theta_{23}=45^\\circ$, maximal Dirac CP phase and trivial Majorana phases. We\nimplement such a CP symmetry as a new CP symmetry in theories with $A_4$\nflavor. The implementation in a complete renormalizable model leads to a new\nform for the neutrino mass matrix that leads to further predictions: normal\nhierarchical spectrum with lightest mass and $m_{\\beta\\beta}$\n($0\\nu\\beta\\beta$) of only few meV, and either $\\nu_1$ or $\\nu_2$ has opposite\nCP parity. An approximate $L_\\mu-L_\\tau$ symmetry arises naturally and controls\nthe flavor structure of the model. The light neutrino masses are generated by\nthe extended seesaw mechanism with 6 right-handed neutrinos (RHNs). The\nrequirement of negligible one-loop corrections to light neutrino masses,\nvalidity of the extended seesaw approximation and not too long-lived BSM states\nto comply with BBN essentially restricts the parameters of the model to a small\nregion: three relatively light right-handed neutrinos at the GeV scale, heavier\nneutrinos at the electroweak scale and Yukawa couplings smaller than the\nelectron Yukawa. Such a small Yukawa couplings render these RHNs unobservable\nin terrestrial experiments.\n", "  Coupled-wire constructions have proven to be useful tools to characterize\nAbelian and non-Abelian topological states of matter in two spatial dimensions.\nIn many cases, their success has been complemented by the vast arsenal of other\ntheoretical tools available to study such systems. In three dimensions,\nhowever, much less is known about topological phases. Since the theoretical\narsenal in this case is smaller, it stands to reason that wire constructions,\nwhich are based on one-dimensional physics, could play a useful role in\ndeveloping a greater microscopic understanding of three-dimensional topological\nphases. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive strategy, based on the\ngeometric arrangement of commuting projectors in the toric code, to generate\nand characterize coupled-wire realizations of strongly-interacting\nthree-dimensional topological phases. We show how this method can be used to\nconstruct pointlike and linelike excitations, and to determine the topological\ndegeneracy. We also point out how, with minor modifications, the machinery\nalready developed in two dimensions can be naturally applied to study the\nsurface states of these systems, a fact that has implications for the study of\nsurface topological order. Finally, we show that the strategy developed for the\nconstruction of three-dimensional topological phases generalizes readily to\narbitrary dimensions, vastly expanding the existing landscape of coupled-wire\ntheories. Throughout the paper, we discuss $\\mathbb{Z}^{\\,}_m$ topological\norder in three and four dimensions as a concrete example of this approach, but\nthe approach itself is not limited to this type of topological order.\n", "  Informative recent measurements on the heavy-fermion metal $\\rm\n\\beta-YbAlB_4$ performed with applied magnetic field and pressure as control\nparameters are analyzed with the goal of establishing a sound theoretical\nexplanation for the inferred scaling laws and non-Fermi-liquid (NFL) behavior,\nwhich demonstrate some unexpected features. Most notably, the robustness of the\nNFL behavior of the thermodynamic properties and of the anomalous $T^{3/2}$\ntemperature dependence of the electrical resistivity under applied pressure $P$\nin zero magnetic field $B$ is at variance with the fragility of the NFL phase\nunder application of a field. We show that a consistent topological basis for\nthis combination of observations, as well as the empirical scaling laws, may be\nfound within fermion-condensation theory in the emergence and destruction of a\nflat band, and explain that the paramagnetic NFL phase takes place without\nmagnetic criticality, thus not from quantum critical fluctuations. Schematic\n$T-B$ and $T-P$ phase diagrams are presented to illuminate this scenario.\n", "  We study the effective field theory obtained by extending the Standard Model\nfield content with two singlets: a 750 GeV (pseudo-)scalar and a stable\nfermion. Accounting for collider productions initiated by both gluon and photon\nfusion, we investigate where the theory is consistent with both the LHC\ndiphoton excess and bounds from Run 1. We analyze dark matter phenomenology in\nsuch regions, including relic density constraints as well as collider, direct,\nand indirect bounds. Scalar portal dark matter models are very close to limits\nfrom direct detection and mono-jet searches if gluon fusion dominates, and not\nconstrained at all otherwise. Pseudo-scalar models are challenged by photon\nline limits and mono-jet searches in most of the parameter space.\n", "  We present a simple analytic procedure for generating atomic-to-molecular\n(HI-to-H$_2$) density profiles for optically thick clouds illuminated by\nfar-ultraviolet radiation. Our procedure is based on the analytic theory for\nthe structure of one-dimensional HI/H$_2$ photon-dominated regions, presented\nby Sternberg et al. (2014). Depth-dependent HI and H$_2$ density fractions may\nbe computed for arbitrary gas density, far-ultraviolet field intensity, and the\nmetallicity dependent H$_2$ formation rate coefficient, and dust absorption\ncross section. We use our procedure to generate a set of HI-to-H$_2$ transition\nprofiles for a wide range of conditions, from the weak- to strong-field limits,\nand from super-solar down to low metallicities. We show that if presented as\nfunctions of dust optical depth the HI and H$_2$ density profiles depend\nprimarily on the Sternberg \"$\\alpha G$ parameter\" (dimensionless) that\ndetermines the dust optical depth associated with the total photodissociated HI\ncolumn. We derive a universal analytic formula for the HI-to-H$_2$ transition\npoints as a function of just $\\alpha G$. Our formula will be useful for\ninterpreting emission-line observations of HI/H$_2$ interfaces, for estimating\nstar-formation thresholds, and for sub-grid components in hydrodynamics\nsimulations.\n", "  Mechanocaloric materials experience a change in temperature when a mechanical\nstress is adiabatically applied on them. Thus far, only ferroelectrics and\nsuperelastic metallic alloys have been considered as potential mechanocaloric\ncompounds to be exploited in solid-state cooling applications. Here we show\nthat giant mechanocaloric effects occur in hitherto overlooked fast ion\nconductors (FIC), a class of multicomponent materials in which above a critical\ntemperature, Ts, a constituent ionic species undergoes a sudden increase in\nmobility. Using first-principles and molecular dynamics simulations, we found\nthat the superionic transition in fluorite-structured FIC, which is\ncharacterised by a large entropy increase of the order of 100 J/K*Kg, can be\nexternally tuned with hydrostatic, biaxial or uniaxial stresses. In particular,\nTs can be reduced several hundreds of degrees through the application of\nmoderate tensile stresses due to the concomitant drop in the formation energy\nof Frenkel pair defects. We predict that the adiabatic temperature change in\nCaF2 and PbF2, two archetypal fluorite-structured FIC, close to their critical\npoints are of the order of 100 and 10 K, respectively. This work advocates that\nFIC constitute a new family of mechanocaloric materials showing great promise\nfor prospective solid-state refrigeration applications.\n", "  The accelerated expansion of the universe is a rather established fact in\ncosmology and many different models have been proposed as a viable explanation.\nMany of these models are based on the standard general relativistic framework\nof non-interacting fluids or more recently of coupled (interacting) dark energy\nmodels, where dark energy (the scalar field) is coupled to the dark matter\ncomponent giving rise to a fifth-force. An interesting alternative is to couple\nthe scalar field directly to the gravity sector via the Ricci scalar. These\nmodels are dubbed non-minimally coupled models and give rise to a\ntime-dependent gravitational constant. In this work we study few models falling\ninto this category and describe how observables depend on the strength of the\ncoupling. We extend recent work on the subject by taking into account also the\neffects of the perturbations of the scalar field and showing their relative\nimportance on the evolution of the mass function. By working in the framework\nof the spherical collapse model, we show that perturbations of the scalar field\nhave a limited impact on the growth factor (for small coupling constant) and on\nthe mass function with respect to the case where perturbations are neglected.\n", "  The use of dual-energy CT (DECT) potentially decreases range uncertainties in\nproton and ion therapy treatment planning via determination of the involved\nphysical target quantities. For eventual clinical application, the correct\ntreatment of tissue mixtures and heterogeneities is an essential feature, as\nthey naturally occur within a patient's CT. Here, we present how existing\nmethods for DECT-based ion-range prediction can be modified in order to\nincorporate proper mixing behavior on several structural levels. Our approach\nis based on the factorization of the stopping-power ratio into the relative\nelectron density and the relative stopping number. The latter is confined for\ntissue between about 0.95 and 1.02 at a therapeutic beam energy of 200 MeV/u\nand depends on the I-value. We show that convenient mixing and averaging\nproperties arise by relating the relative stopping number to the relative cross\nsection obtained by DECT. From this, a maximum uncertainty of the\nstopping-power ratio prediction below 1% is suggested for arbitrary mixtures of\nhuman body tissues.\n", "  In a recent publication [S. Groth \\textit{et al.}, PRB (2016)], we have shown\nthat the combination of two novel complementary quantum Monte Carlo approaches,\nnamely configuration path integral Monte Carlo (CPIMC) [T. Schoof \\textit{et\nal.}, PRL \\textbf{115}, 130402 (2015)] and permutation blocking path integral\nMonte Carlo (PB-PIMC) [T. Dornheim \\textit{et al.}, NJP \\textbf{17}, 073017\n(2015)], allows for the accurate computation of thermodynamic properties of the\nspin-polarized uniform electron gas (UEG) over a wide range of temperatures and\ndensities without the fixed-node approximation. In the present work, we extend\nthis concept to the unpolarized case, which requires non-trivial enhancements\nthat we describe in detail. We compare our new simulation results with recent\nrestricted path integral Monte Carlo data [E. Brown \\textit{et al}., PRL\n\\textbf{110}, 146405 (2013)] for different energy contributions and pair\ndistribution functions and find, for the exchange correlation energy, overall\nbetter agreement than for the spin-polarized case, while the separate kinetic\nand potential contributions substantially deviate.\n", "  We propose real-space renormalized dynamical mean field theory (rr-DMFT) to\ndeal with large clusters in the framework of a cluster extension of the DMFT.\nIn the rr-DMFT, large clusters are decomposed into multiple smaller clusters\nthrough a real-space renormalization. In this work, the renormalization effect\nis taken into account only at the lowest order with respect to the intercluster\ncoupling, which nonetheless reproduces exactly both the noninteracting and\natomic limits. Our method allows us large cluster-size calculations which are\nintractable with the conventional cluster extensions of the DMFT with impurity\nsolvers, such as the continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo and exact\ndiagonalization methods. We benchmark the rr-DMFT for the two-dimensional\nHubbard model on a square lattice at and away from half filling, where the\nspatial correlations play important roles. Our results on the spin structure\nfactor indicate that the growth of the antiferromagnetic spin correlation is\ntaken into account beyond the decomposed cluster size. We also show that the\nself-energy obtained from the large-cluster solver is reproduced by our method\nbetter than the solution obtained directly for the smaller cluster. When\napplied to the Mott metal-insulator transition, the rr-DMFT is able to\nreproduce the reduced critical value for the Coulomb interaction comparable to\nthe large cluster result.\n", "  Dilaton black hole solutions in low energy string theory (well known as GMGHS\nblack holes) have analogue black holes with a cosmological constant derived by\nGao and Zhang. Here, we study quasi normal modes of this dilaton-de Sitter\nblack hole under neutral scalar field perturbations. We have employed the sixth\norder WKB analysis to compute the quasi normal mode frequencies. A detailed\nstudy is done for the quasi normal mode frequencies by varying the parameters\nin the theory such as the mass, cosmological constant, dilaton charge and the\nspherical harmonic index. For the massive scalar field we observed that the\nusual quasi resonance modes that exists for asymptotically flat black holes do\nnot exist for this particular black hole. We have approximated the scalar field\npotential of the near-extreme dilaton de Sitter black hole with the\nP$\\ddot{o}$schl-Teller potential and have presented exact quasi normal\nfrequencies.\n", "  Multiple metrics have been developed to detect causality relations between\ndata describing the elements constituting complex systems, all of them\nconsidering their evolution through time. Here we propose a metric able to\ndetect causality within static data sets, by analysing how extreme events in\none element correspond to the appearance of extreme events in a second one. The\nmetric is able to detect non- linear causalities; to analyse both\ncross-sectional and longitudinal data sets; and to discriminate between real\ncausalities and correlations caused by confounding factors. We validate the\nmetric through synthetic data, dynamical and chaotic systems, and data\nrepresenting the human brain activity in a cognitive task. We further show how\nthe proposed metric is able to outperform classical causality metrics, provided\nnon-linear relationships are present and large enough data sets are available.\n", "  We propose a generalized Zee-Babu model with a global $U(1)$ B-L symmetry, in\nwhich we classify the model in terms of the number of the hypercharge $N/2$ of\nthe isospin doublet exotic charged fermions. Corresponding to each of the\nnumber of $N$, we need to introduce some multiply charged bosons in order to\nmake the exotic fields decay into the standard model fields. We also discuss\nthe muon anomalous magnetic moment and the diphoton excess depending on $N$,\nand we show what kind of models are in favor of these phenomenologies.\n", "  The arrival directions of TeV-PeV cosmic rays show weak but significant\nanisotropies with relative intensities at the level of one per mille. Due to\nthe smallness of the anisotropies, quantitative studies require careful\ndisentanglement of detector effects from the observation. We discuss an\niterative maximum-likelihood reconstruction that simultaneously fits cosmic ray\nanisotropies and detector acceptance. The method does not rely on detector\nsimulations and provides an optimal anisotropy reconstruction for ground-based\ncosmic ray observatories located in the middle latitudes. It is particularly\nwell suited to the recovery of the dipole anisotropy, which is a crucial\nobservable for the study of cosmic ray diffusion in our Galaxy. We also provide\ngeneral analysis methods for recovering large- and small-scale anisotropies\nthat take into account systematic effects of the observation by ground-based\ndetectors.\n", "  Emergent properties such as nuclear saturation and deformation, and the\neffects on shell structure due to the proximity of the scattering continuum and\nparticle decay channels are fascinating phenomena in atomic nuclei. In recent\nyears, ab initio approaches to nuclei have taken the first steps towards\ntackling the computational challenge of describing these phenomena from\nHamiltonians with microscopic degrees of freedom. This endeavor is now possible\ndue to ideas from effective field theories, novel optimization strategies for\nnuclear interactions, ab initio methods exhibiting a soft scaling with mass\nnumber, and ever-increasing computational power. This paper reviews some of the\nrecent accomplishments. We also present new results. The recently optimized\nchiral interaction NNLO$_{\\rm sat}$ is shown to provide an accurate description\nof both charge radii and binding energies in selected light- and medium-mass\nnuclei up to $^{56}$Ni. We derive an efficient scheme for including continuum\neffects in coupled-cluster computations of nuclei based on chiral\nnucleon-nucleon and three-nucleon forces, and present new results for unbound\nstates in the neutron-rich isotopes of oxygen and calcium. The coupling to the\ncontinuum impacts the energies of the $J^\\pi = {1/2}^-,{3/2}^-,{7/2}^-,{3/2}^+$\nstates in $^{17,23,25}$O, and - contrary to naive shell-model expectations -\nthe level ordering of the $J^\\pi = {3/2}^+,{5/2}^+,{9/2}^+$ states in\n$^{53,55,61}$Ca.\n", "  The class of non-stationary braneworld models generated by the coupled\ngravitational and scalar fields is reviewed. The model represents a brane in a\nspace-time with single time and one large (infinite) and several small\n(compact) space-like extra dimensions. In some particular cases the model has\nthe solutions corresponding to the bulk gravi-scalar standing waves bounded by\nthe brane. Pure gravitational localization mechanism of matter particles on the\nnode of standing waves, where the brane is placed, is discussed. Cosmological\napplications of the model also considered.\n", "  Converting signals between different electromagnetic modes is an asset for\nfuture information technologies. In general, slightly asymmetric optical\nnanoantennas enable the coupling between bright and dark modes sustained by an\noptical nanoantenna. However, the conversion efficiency might be very low.\nHere, we show that the additional incorporation of a quantum emitter allows to\ntremendously enhance this efficiency. The enhanced local density of states\ncycles the quantum emitter between its upper and lower level at an extremely\nhight rate; hence converting the energy very efficient. The process is robust\nwith respect to possible experimental tolerances and adds a new ingredient to\nbe exploited while studying and applying coupling phenomena in optical\nnanosystems.\n", "  We report on the experimental implementation of tunable occupation-dependent\ntunneling in a Bose-Hubbard system of ultracold atoms via time-periodic\nmodulation of the on-site interaction energy. The tunneling rate is inferred\nfrom a time-resolved measurement of the lattice site occupation after a quantum\nquench. We demonstrate coherent control of the tunneling dynamics in the\ncorrelated many-body system, including full suppression of tunneling as\npredicted within the framework of Floquet theory. We find that the tunneling\nrate explicitly depends on the atom number difference in neighboring lattice\nsites. Our results may open up ways to realize artificial gauge fields that\nfeature density dependence with ultracold atoms.\n", "  In this paper, we study the accretion process for fluids flowing near a black\nhole in the context of $f(T)$ teleparallel gravity. Specifically, by performing\na dynamical analysis by a Hamiltonian system, we are able to find the sonic\npoints. After that, we consider different isothermal test fluids in order to\nstudy the accretion process when they are falling onto the black hole. We found\nthat these flows can be classified according to the equation of state and the\nblack hole features. Results are compared in $f(T)$ and $f(R)$ gravity.\n", "  In this note, we have addressed various issues on zero temperature\nholographic superfluids. First, inspired by our numerical evidence for the\nequality between the superfluid density and particle density, we provide an\nelegant analytic proof for this equality by a boost trick. Second, using not\nonly the frequency domain analysis but also the time domain analysis from\nnumerical relativity, we identify the hydrodynamic normal modes and calculate\nout the sound speed, which is shown to increase with the chemical potential and\nsaturate to the value predicted by the conformal field theory in the large\nchemical potential limit. Third, the generic non-thermalization is demonstrated\nby the fully non-linear time evolution from a non-equilibrium state for our\nzero temperature holographic superfluid. Furthermore, a conserved Noether\ncharge is proposed in support of this behavior.\n", "  This short paper is an introduction of the memoir recently written by the two\nauthors (see [D.Bresch., P.--E. Jabin, arXiv:1507.04629, (2015)]) which\nconcerns the resolution of two longstanding problems: Global existence of weak\nsolutions for compressible Navier-Stokes equations with thermodynamically\nunstable pressure and with anisotropic stress tensor. We focus here on a\nStokes-like system which can for instance model flows in a compressible tissue\nin biology or in a compressible porous media in petroleum engineering. This\nallows us to explain, on a simpler but still relevant and important system, the\ntools recently introduced by the authors and to discuss the important results\nthat have been obtained on the compressible Navier--Stokes equations. It is\nfinally a real pleasure to dedicate this paper to G. Metivier for his 65's\nBirthday. The article will appear in the corresponding special issue, Springer\nINdAM-Series, Eds F. Colombini, D. Del Santos, D. Lannes (2016).\n", "  We consider topological phases in periodically driven (Floquet) systems\nexhibiting many-body localization, protected by a symmetry $G$. We argue for a\ngeneral correspondence between such phases and topological phases of undriven\nsystems protected by symmetry $\\mathbb{Z} \\rtimes G$, where the additional\n$\\mathbb{Z}$ accounts for the discrete time translation symmetry. Thus, for\nexample, the bosonic phases in $d$ spatial dimensions without intrinsic\ntopological order (SPT phases) are classified by the cohomology group\n$H^{d+1}(\\mathbb{Z} \\rtimes G, \\mathrm{U}(1))$. For unitary symmetries, we\ninterpret the additional resulting Floquet phases in terms of the\nlower-dimensional SPT phases that are pumped to the boundary during one time\nstep. These results also imply the existence of novel symmetry-enriched\ntopological (SET) orders protected solely by the periodicity of the drive.\n", "  Analysis of the periodic points of a conservative periodic dynamical system\nuncovers the basic kinematic structure of the transport dynamics, and\nidentifies regions of local stability or chaos. While elliptic and hyperbolic\npoints typically govern such behaviour in 3D systems, degenerate (parabolic)\npoints play a more important role than expected. These points represent a\nbifurcation in local stability and Lagrangian topology. In this study we\nconsider the ramifications of the two types of degenerate periodic points that\noccur in a model 3D fluid flow. (1) Period-tripling bifurcations occur when the\nlocal rotation angle associated with elliptic points is reversed, creating a\nreversal in the orientation of associated Lagrangian structures. Even though a\nsingle unstable point is created, the bifurcation in local stability has a\nlarge influence on local transport and the global arrangement of manifolds as\nthe unstable degenerate point has three stable and three unstable directions,\nsimilar to hyperbolic points, and occurs at the intersection of three\nhyperbolic periodic lines. The presence of period-tripling bifurcation points\nindicates regions of either chaos or confinement depending on the nature of the\nassociated manifold intersections. (2) The second type of bifurcation occurs\nwhen periodic lines become tangent to local or global invariant surfaces. This\nbifurcation creates both saddle-centre bifurcations which can create both\nchaotic and stable regions, and period-doubling bifurcations which are a common\nroute to chaos in 2D systems. We provide conditions for the occurrence of these\ntangent bifurcations in 3D conservative systems, as well as constraints on the\npossible types of tangent bifurcation that can occur based on topological\nconsiderations.\n", "  We describe the methods and results of numerical simulations of coalescing\nblack holes. The simulation in dynamical spacetime covers the inspiral, merger,\nand ringdown phases. We analyze the emission of gravitational waves and\nproperties of a black hole being the merger product. We discuss the results in\nthe context of astrophysical environment of black holes that exist in the\nUniverse.\n", "  We consider implications of the diphoton excess recently observed at the LHC\non the anomalous magnetic dipole moment of the muon $(g-2)_\\mu = 2 a_\\mu$,\nhypothesizing that the possible 750 GeV resonance is a (pseudo)scalar particle.\nThe (pseudo)scalar-$\\gamma$-$\\gamma$ interaction implied by the diphoton events\nmight generically contribute to $a_\\mu$ via 2-loop Barr-Zee type diagrams in a\nbroad class of models. If the scalar is an $SU(2)_L$ singlet, the new\ncontribution to $a_\\mu$ is much smaller than the current anomaly, $\\Delta a_\\mu\n\\equiv a_\\mu^{\\rm exp}-a_\\mu^{\\rm SM} \\approx (30 \\pm 10) \\times 10^{-10}$,\nsince the scalar can complete the Barr-Zee diagrams only through its mixing\nwith the Standard Model Higgs boson. If the (pseudo)scalar belongs to an\n$SU(2)_L$ doublet in an extended Higgs sector, then by contrast, $\\Delta a_\\mu$\ncan be easily accommodated with the aid of an enhanced Yukawa coupling of the\n(pseudo)scalar to the muon such as in the Type-II or -X two Higgs doublet\nmodel.\n", "  We develop a theory for light-induced superconductivity in underdoped\ncuprates in which the competing bond-density wave order is suppressed by\ndriving phonons with light. Close to a bond-density wave instability in a\nsystem with a small Fermi surface, such as a fractionalized Fermi liquid, we\nshow that the coupling of electrons to phonons is strongly enhanced at the\nbond-density wave ordering wavevectors, leading to a strong softening of\nphonons at these wavevectors. For a model of classical phonons with anharmonic\ncouplings, we show that the combination of strong softening and driving can\nlead to large phonon oscillations. When coupled to a phenomenological model\ndescribing the competition between bond-density wave order and\nsuperconductivity, these phonon oscillations melt bond-density wave order,\nthereby enhancing pairing correlations.\n", "  Protected chiral edge modes are a well-known signature of topologically\nordered phases like the Fractional Quantum Hall States. Recently, using the\nframework of projected entangled pair states (PEPS) on the square lattice, we\nconstructed a family of chiral Resonating Valence Bond states with\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge symmetry. Here we revisit and analyze in full details the\nproperties of the edge modes as given by their Entanglement Spectra on a\ncylinder. Surprisingly, we show that the latter can be well described by a\nchiral SU(2)$_1$ Conformal Field Theory (CFT), as for the $\\nu=1/2$ (bosonic)\ngapped Laughlin state, although our numerical data suggest a critical bulk\ncompatible with an emergent $U(1)$ gauge symmetry. We propose that our family\nof PEPS may physically describe a boundary between a chiral topological phase\nand a trivial phase.\n", "  We report an investigation of the \"missing-linker phenomenon\" in the Zr-based\nmetal-organic framework UiO-66 using atomistic forcefield and quantum chemical\nmethods. For a vacant benzene dicarboxylate ligand, the lowest energy charge\ncapping mechanism involves acetic acid or Cl-/H2O. The calculated defect free\nenergy of formation is remarkably low, consistent with the high defect\nconcentrations reported experimentally. A dynamic structural instability is\nidentified for certain higher defect concentrations. In addition to the changes\nin material properties upon defect formation, we assess the formation of\nmolecular aggregates, which provide an additional driving force for ligand\nloss. These results are expected to be of relevance to a wide range of\nmetal-organic frameworks.\n", "  We present a molecular dynamics simulation scheme that we apply to study the\ntime evolution of the self-organized growth process of metal cluster assemblies\nformed by sputter-deposited gold atoms on a planar surface. The simulation\nmodel incorporates the characteristics of the plasma-assisted deposition\nprocess and allows for an investigation over a wide range of deposition\nparameters. It is used to obtain data for the cluster properties which can\ndirectly be compared to recently published experimental data for gold on\npolystyrene (M. Schwartzkopf \\textit{et al}., ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces\n\\textbf{7}, 13547 (2015)). While good agreement is found between the two, the\nsimulations additionally provide valuable time-dependent real-space data of the\nsurface morphology some of whose details are hidden in the reciprocal-space\nscattering images that were used for the experimental analysis.\n", "  We evaluate the impact of an external magnetic field on the chiral symmetry\nand confinement-deconfinement transition temperatures by using a vector-vector\ncontact interaction model for quarks regularized so as to include an explicit\nconfining scale in the corresponding gap equation. Exploring the evolution of\nthe chiral condensate and the confining scale with temperature $T$ and magnetic\nfield strength $eB$ ($e$ represents the fundamental electric charge), we\ndetermine the pseudo-critical temperatures for the chiral ($T_c^\\chi$) and\ndeconfinement ($T_c^c$) transitions from their inflection points, respectively.\nBy construction, $T_c^\\chi= T_c^c$ in the chiral limit. Within a mean field\napproximation, we observe the magnetic catalysis phenomenon, characterized by a\nrising behavior of $T_c^\\chi$ and $T_c^c$ with growing $eB$. Considering a\nlattice inspired running coupling which monotonically decreases with $eB$,\ninverse magnetic catalysis takes place in our model. We explore the role of the\nmagnetic field in the traits of the confinement-deconfinement transition\ndescribed by the model. Our findings are also in agreement with predictions\nderived from effective models of strong interactions.\n", "  Photoacoustic sensing and imaging techniques have been studied widely to\nexplore optical absorption contrast based on nanosecond laser illumination. In\nthis paper, we report a long laser pulse induced dual photoacoustic (LDPA)\nnonlinear effect, which originates from unsatisfied stress and thermal\nconfinements. Being different from conventional short laser pulse illumination,\nthe proposed method utilizes a long square-profile laser pulse to induce dual\nphotoacoustic signals. Without satisfying the stress confinement, the dual\nphotoacoustic signals are generated following the positive and negative edges\nof the long laser pulse. More interestingly, the first expansion-induced\nphotoacoustic signal exhibits positive waveform due to the initial sharp rising\nof temperature. On the contrary, the second contraction-induced photoacoustic\nsignal exhibits exactly negative waveform due to the falling of temperature, as\nwell as pulse-width-dependent signal amplitude which is caused by the\nconcurrent heat accumulation and thermal diffusion during the long laser\nillumination. An analytical model is derived to describe the generation of the\ndual photoacoustic pulses, incorporating Gruneisen saturation and thermal\ndiffusion effect, which is experimentally proved. Lastly, an alternate of LDPA\ntechnique using quasi-CW laser excitation is also introduced and demonstrated\nfor both super-contrast in vitro and in vivo imaging. Compared with existing\nnonlinear PA techniques, the proposed LDPA nonlinear effect could enable a much\nbroader range of potential applications.\n", "  Out-of-equilibrium behavior is explored in the one-dimensional anisotropic\n$XY$ model. Initially preparing the system in the isotropic $XX$ model with a\nlinearly varying magnetic field to create a domain-wall magnetization profile,\ndynamics is generated by rapidly changing the exchange interaction anisotropy\nand external magnetic field. Relaxation to a nonequilibrium steady state is\nstudied analytically at the critical transverse Ising point, where correlation\nfunctions may be computed in closed form. For arbitrary values of anisotropy\nand external field, an effective generalized Gibbs' ensemble is shown to\naccurately describe observables in the long-time limit. Additionally, we find\nspatial oscillations in the exponentially decaying, transverse spin-spin\ncorrelation functions with wavelength set by the magnetization jump across the\ninitial domain wall. This wavelength depends only weakly on anisotropy and\nmagnetic field in contrast to the current, which is highly dependent on these\nparameters.\n", "  We present the results of precise correlated-electron calculations on the\nmonomer lattices of the organic charge-transfer solids $\\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$X\nfor 32 and 64 molecular sites. Our calculations are for band parameters\ncorresponding to X = Cu[N(CN)$_2$]Cl and Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$, which are\nsemiconducting antiferromagnetic and quantum spin liquid, respectively, at\nambient pressure. We have performed our calculations for variable electron\ndensities $\\rho$ per BEDT-TTF molecule, with $\\rho$ ranging from 1 to 2. We\nfind that $d$-wave superconducting pair-pair correlations are enhanced by\nelectron-electron interactions only for a narrow carrier concentration about\n$\\rho=1.5$, which is precisely the carrier concentration where\nsuperconductivity in the charge-transfer solids occurs. Our results indicate\nthat the enhancement in pair-pair correlations is not related to\nantiferromagnetic order, but to a proximate hidden spin-singlet state that\nmanifests itself as a charge-ordered state in other charge-transfer solids.\nLong-range superconducting order does not appear to be present in the purely\nelectronic model, suggesting that electron-phonon interactions also must play a\nrole in a complete theory of superconductivity.\n", "  It was recently realised that quantum theory allows for so-called causally\nnonseparable processes, which are incompatible with any definite causal order.\nThis was first suggested on a rather abstract level by the formalism of process\nmatrices, which only assumes that quantum theory holds locally in some\nobservers' laboratories, but does not impose a global causal structure; it was\nthen shown, on a more practical level, that the quantum switch---a new resource\nfor quantum computation that goes beyond causally ordered circuits---provided\nprecisely a physical example of a causally nonseparable process. To demonstrate\nthat a given process is causally nonseparable, we introduced in [Ara\\'ujo et\nal., New J. Phys. 17, 102001 (2015)] the concept of witnesses of causal\nnonseparability. Here we present a shorter introduction to this concept, and\nconcentrate on some explicit examples to show how to construct and use such\nwitnesses in practice.\n", "  We investigate possible cosmological effects of interacting scalar radiation\nand dark matter. After its decoupling, scalar radiation can stream freely as\nneutrinos or self-interact strongly as perfect fluid, highly depending on the\nmagnitude of its self-couplings. We obtain the general and novel structure for\nself-scattering rate and compare it with the expansion rate of our Universe. If\nits trilinear/cubic coupling is non-zero, scalar radiation can be eventually\ntreated as perfect fluid. Possible effects on CMB are also discussed. When this\nscalar also mediates interaction among dark matter particles, the linear matter\npower spectrum for large scale structure can be modified differently from other\nmodels. We propose to use Debye shielding to avoid the singularity appearing in\nthe scattering between scalar radiation and dark matter.\n", "  We consider a mixture of one-dimensional strongly interacting Fermi gases up\nto six components, subjected to a longitudinal harmonic confinement. In the\nlimit of infinitely strong repulsions we provide an exact solution which\ngeneralizes the one for the two-component mixture. We show that an imbalanced\nmixture under harmonic confinement displays partial spatial separation among\nthe components, with a structure which depends on the relative population of\nthe various components. Furthermore, we provide a symmetry characterization of\nthe ground and excited states of the mixture introducing and evaluating a\nsuitable operator, namely the conjugacy class sum. We show that, even under\nexternal confinement, the gas has a definite symmetry which corresponds to the\nmost symmetric one compatible with the imbalance among the components. This\ngeneralizes the predictions of the Lieb-Mattis theorem for a fermionic mixture\nwith more than two components.\n", "  We initiate the study of multiloop scattering amplitudes in the Nambu-Goto\ntheory on the worldsheet of a non-critical string. We start with a brute force\ncalculation of two loop four particle scattering. Somewhat surprisingly, even\nthough non-trivial UV counterterms are present at this order, on-shell\namplitudes remain polynomial in the momenta of colliding particles. We show\nthat this can be understood as a consequence of existence of certain close by\n(semi)integrable models. Furthermore, these arguments can be extended to obtain\nthe answer for three and four loop scattering, bypassing the brute force\ncalculation. The resulting amplitudes develop non-polynomial (logarithmic)\ndependence on the momenta starting at three loops.\n", "  Using the chiral kinetic theory we derive the electric and chiral current\ndensities in inhomogeneous relativistic plasma. We also derive equations for\nthe electric and chiral charge chemical potentials that close the Maxwell\nequations in such a plasma. The analysis is done in the regimes with and\nwithout a drift of the plasma as a whole. In addition to the currents present\nin the homogeneous plasma (Hall current, chiral magnetic, chiral separation,\nand chiral electric separation effects, as well as Ohm's current) we derive\nseveral new terms associated with inhomogeneities of the plasma. Apart from\nvarious diffusion-like terms, we find also new dissipation-less terms that are\nindependent of relaxation time. Their origin can be traced to the Berry\ncurvature modifications of the kinetic theory.\n", "  Dislocations - linear defects within the crystal lattice of, e.g., metals -\nalready have been directly observed and analyzed for nearly a century. While\nexperimental characterization methods can nowadays reconstruct\nthree-dimensional pictures of complex dislocation networks, simulation methods\nare at the same time more and more able to predict the evolution of such\nsystems in great detail. Concise methods for analyzing and comparing\ndislocation microstructure, however, are still lagging behind. We introduce a\nuniversal microstructure \"language\" which could be used for direct comparisons\nand detailed analysis of very different experimental and simulation methods.\n", "  We construct a phenomenological Landau-de Gennes theory for hard colloidal\nrods by performing an order parameter expansion of the chemical-potential\ndependent grand potential. By fitting the coefficients to known results of\nOnsager theory, we are not only able to describe the isotropic-nematic phase\ntransition as function of density, including the well-known density jump, but\nalso the isotropic-nematic planar interface. The resulting theory is applied in\ncalculations of the isotropic core size in a radial hedgehog defect, the\ndensity dependence of linear defects of hard rods in square confinement, and\nthe formation of a nematic droplet in an isotropic background.\n", "  Gravitational waves (GWs) provide a revolutionary tool to investigate yet\nunobserved astrophysical objects. Especially the first stars, which are\nbelieved to be more massive than present-day stars, might be indirectly\nobservable via the merger of their compact remnants. We develop a\nself-consistent, cosmologically representative, semi-analytical model to\nsimulate the formation of the first stars. By extrapolating binary\nstellar-evolution models at 10% solar metallicity to metal-free stars, we track\nthe individual systems until the coalescence of the compact remnants. We\nestimate the contribution of primordial stars to the merger rate density and to\nthe detection rate of the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave\nObservatory (aLIGO). Owing to their higher masses, the remnants of primordial\nstars produce strong GW signals, even if their contribution in number is\nrelatively small. We find a probability of $\\gtrsim1\\%$ that the current\ndetection GW150914 is of primordial origin. We estimate that aLIGO will detect\nroughly 1 primordial BH-BH merger per year for the final design sensitivity,\nalthough this rate depends sensitively on the primordial initial mass function\n(IMF). Turning this around, the detection of black hole mergers with a total\nbinary mass of $\\sim 300\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ would enable us to constrain the\nprimordial IMF.\n", "  We report the first use of a ring cavity to both enhance the output power and\ndramatically narrow the linewidth ($<1\\,$MHz) of blue light generated by four\nwave mixing in a rubidium vapour cell. We find that the high output power\navailable in our cavity-free system leads to power broadening of the generated\nblue light linewidth. Our ring cavity removes this limitation, allowing high\noutput power and narrow linewidth to be achieved concurrently. As the cavity\nblue light is widely tunable over the $^{85}$Rb 5S$_{1/2} \\,\\,F=3$\n$\\rightarrow$ 6P$_{3/2}$ transition, this narrow linewidth light would be\nsuitable for second-stage laser cooling, which could be valuable for efficient\n$^{85}$Rb BEC production.\n", "  We present a silicon optomechanical nanobeam design with a dynamically\ntunable acoustic mode at 10.2 GHz. The resonance frequency can be shifted by 90\nkHz/V^2 with an on-chip capacitor that was optimized to exert forces up to 1\n$\\mu$N at 10 V operation voltage. Optical resonance frequencies around 190 THz\nwith Q factors up to $2.2 \\times 10^6$ place the structure in the well-resolved\nsideband regime with vacuum optomechanical coupling rates up to $g_0/2\\pi =\n353$ kHz. Tuning can be used, for instance, to overcome variation in the\ndevice-to-device acoustic resonance frequency due to fabrication errors, paving\nthe way for optomechanical circuits consisting of arrays of optomechanical\ncavities.\n", "  We present a comprehensive study of cross-flow ultrafiltration (UF) of\ncharge-stabilized suspensions, under low-salinity conditions of\nelectrostatically strongly repelling colloidal particles. The axially varying\npermeate flux, near-membrane concentration-polarization (CP) layer and osmotic\npressure profiles are calculated using a macroscopic diffusion-advection\nboundary layer method, and are compared with filtration experiments on aqueous\nsuspensions of charge-stabilized silica particles. The theoretical description\nbased on the one-component macroion fluid model (OCM) accounts for the strong\ninfluence of surface-released counterions on the renormalized colloid charge\nand suspension osmotic compressibility, and for the influence of the colloidal\nhydrodynamic interactions and electric double layer repulsion on the\nconcentration-dependent suspension viscosity $\\eta$, and collective diffusion\ncoefficient $D_c$. A strong electro-hydrodynamic enhancement of $D_c$ and\n$\\eta$, and likewise of the osmotic pressure is predicted theoretically, as\ncompared with their values for a hard-sphere suspension. We also point to the\nfailure of generalized Stokes-Einstein relations describing reciprocal\nrelations between $D_c$ and $\\eta$. According to our filtration model, $D_c$ is\nof dominant influence, giving rise to an only weakly developed CP layer having\npractically no effect on the permeate flux. This prediction is quantitatively\nconfirmed by our UF measurements of the permeate flux using an aqueous\nsuspension of charged silica spheres as the feed system. The experimentally\ndetected fouling for the largest considered transmembrane pressure values is\nshown not to be due to filter cake formation by crystallization or\nvitrification.\n", "  In many applications, the probability density function is subject to\nexperimental errors. In this work the continuos dependence of a class of\ngeneralized entropies on the experimental errors is studied. This class\nincludes the C. Shannon, C. Tsallis, A. R\\'{e}nyi and generalized R\\'{e}nyi\nentropies. By using the connection between R\\'{e}nyi or Tsallis entropies, and\nthe \\textit{distance} in a the Lebesgue functional spaces, we introduce a\nfurther extensive generalizations of the R\\'{e}nyi entropy. In this work we\nsuppose that the experimental error is measured by some generalized $L^{p}$\ndistance. In line with the methodology normally used for treating the so called\n\\textit{ill-posed problems}, auxiliary stabilizing conditions are determined,\nsuch that small - in the sense of $L^{p}$ metric - experimental errors provoke\nsmall variations of the classical and generalized entropies. These stabilizing\nconditions are formulated in terms of $L^{p}$ metric in a class of generalized\n$L^{p}$ spaces of functions. Shannon's entropy requires, however, more\nrestrictive stabilizing conditions.\n", "  Digital Micromirror Devices (DMD) provide a robust platform with which to\nimplement digital holography, in principle providing the means to rapidly\ngenerate propagating transverse electromagnetic fields with arbitrary mode\nprofiles at visible and IR wavelengths. We use a DMD to probe a Fabry-P\\'{e}rot\ncavity in single-mode and near-degenerate confocal configurations. Pumping\narbitrary modes of the cavity is possible with excellent specificity by virtue\nof the spatial overlap between the incident light field and the cavity mode.\n", "  We report a combined neutron scattering and magnetization study on the\nmultiferroic DyFeO3 which shows a very strong magnetoelectric effect. Applying\nmagnetic field along the c-axis, the weak ferromagnetic order of the Fe ions is\nquickly recovered from a spin reorientation transition, and the long-range\nantiferromagnetic order of Dy becomes a short-range one. We found that the\nshort-range order concurs with the multiferroic phase and is responsible for\nits sizable hysteresis. Our H-T phase diagram suggests that the strong\nmagnetoelectric effect in DyFeO3 has to be understood with not only the weak\nferromagnetism of Fe but also the short-range antiferromagnetic order of Dy.\n", "  We present broad-band photometry of five transits in the planetary system\nWASP-36, totaling 17 high-precision light curves. Four of the transits were\nsimultaneously observed in four passbands (g, r, i, z), using the\ntelescope-defocussing technique, and achieving scatters of less than 1 mmag per\nobservation. We used these data to improve the measured orbital and physical\nproperties of the system, and obtain an optical transmission spectrum of the\nplanet. We measured a decreasing radius from bluer to redder passbands with a\nconfidence level of more than 5 sigma. The radius variation is roughly 11\npressure scale heights between the g and the z bands. This is too strong to be\nRayleigh scattering in the planetary atmosphere, and implies the presence of a\nspecies which absorbs strongly at bluer wavelengths.\n", "  The total mass of noncollinear photons forming diverging light pulses is\ndefined and found explicitly. Both classical and quantum derivations are\npresented. The quantum derivation is based on the use of multimode coherent\nstates, and links between parameters of these states and those of the classical\nfield strength are established.\n", "  Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om Anti-de Sitter (RNAdS) black holes are unstable against\nthe charged scalar field perturbations due to the well-known superradiance\nphenomenon. We present the time domain analysis of charged scalar field\nperturbations in the RNAdS black hole background in general dimensions. We show\nthat the instabilities of charged scalar field can be explicitly illustrated\nfrom the time profiles of evolving scalar field. By using the Prony method to\nfit the time evolution data, we confirm the mode that dominates the long time\nbehavior of scalar field is in accordance with the quasinormal mode from the\nfrequency domain analysis. The superradiance origin of the instability can also\nbe demonstrated by comparing the real part of the dominant mode with the\nsuperradiant condition of charged scalar field. It is shown that all the\nunstable modes are superradiant, which is consistent with the analytical result\nin the frequency domain analysis. Furthermore, we also confirm there exists the\nrapid exponential growing modes in the RNAdS case, which makes the RNAdS black\nhole a good test ground to investigate the nonlinear evolution of superradiant\ninstability.\n", "  We examine trilinear gauge boson couplings (TGCs) in the context of the\n$SU(3)_W\\otimes U(1)'$ gauge-Higgs unification scenario. The TGCs play\nimportant roles in the probes of the physics beyond the standard model, since\nthey are highly restricted by the experiments. We discuss mass spectrum of the\nneutral gauge boson with brane-localized mass terms carefully and find that the\nTGCs and $\\rho$ parameter may deviate from standard model predictions. Finally\nwe put a constraint from these observables and discuss the possible parameter\nspace.\n", "  The solid content of circumstellar disks is inherited from the interstellar\nmedium: dust particles of at most a micrometer in size. Protoplanetary disks\nare the environment where these dust grains need to grow at least 13 orders of\nmagnitude in size. Our understanding of this growth process is far from\ncomplete, with different physics seemingly posing obstacles to this growth at\nvarious stages. Yet, the ubiquity of planets in our galaxy suggests that planet\nformation is a robust mechanism. This chapter focuses on the earliest stages of\nplanet formation, the growth of small dust grains towards the gravitationally\nbound \"planetesimals\", the building blocks of planets. We will introduce some\nof the key physics involved in the growth processes and discuss how they are\nexpected to shape the global behavior of the solid content of disks. We will\nconsider possible pathways towards the formation of larger bodies and conclude\nby reviewing some of the recent observational advances in the field.\n", "  The detection of optical re-brightenings and X-ray plateaus in the afterglows\nof gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) challenges the generic external shock model.\nRecently, we have developed a numerical method to calculate the dynamic of the\nsystem consisting of a forward shock and a reverse shock. Here, we briefly\nreview the applications of this method in the afterglow theory. By relating\nthese diverse features to the central engines of GRBs, we find that the steep\noptical re-brightenings would be caused by the fall-back accretion of black\nholes, while the shallow optical re-brightenings are the consequence of the\ninjection of the electron-positron-pair wind from the central magnetar. These\nstudies provide useful ways to probe the characteristics of GRB central\nengines.\n", "  Complex network theory provides an elegant and powerful framework to\nstatistically investigate different types of systems such as society, brain or\nthe structure of local and long-range dynamical interrelationships in the\nclimate system. Network links in climate networks typically imply information,\nmass or energy exchange. However, the specific connection between oceanic or\natmospheric flows and the climate network's structure is still unclear. We\npropose a theoretical approach for verifying relations between the correlation\nmatrix and the climate network measures, generalizing previous studies and\novercoming the restriction to stationary flows. Our methods are developed for\ncorrelations of a scalar quantity (temperature, for example) which satisfies an\nadvection-diffusion dynamics in the presence of forcing and dissipation. Our\napproach reveals that correlation networks are not sensitive to steady sources\nand sinks and the profound impact of the signal decay rate on the network\ntopology. We illustrate our results with calculations of degree and clustering\nfor a meandering flow resembling a geophysical ocean jet.\n", "  We report on the study of magnetic properties of the La1.5Ca0.5CoIrO6 double\nperovskite. Via ac magnetic susceptibility we have observed evidence of weak\nferromagnetism and reentrant spin glass behavior on an antiferromagnetic\nmatrix. Regarding the magnetic behavior as a function of temperature, we have\nfound that the material displays up to three inversions of its magnetization,\ndepending on the appropriate choice of the applied magnetic field. At low\ntemperature the material exhibit exchange bias effect when it is cooled in the\npresence of a magnetic field. Also, our results indicate that this effect may\nbe observed even when the system is cooled at zero field. Supported by other\nmeasurements and also by electronic structure calculations, we discuss the\nmagnetic reversals and spontaneous exchange bias effect in terms of magnetic\nphase separation and magnetic frustration of Ir4+ ions located between the\nantiferromagnetically coupled Co ions.\n", "  We generalize the soft-wall and hard-wall models to a light-front holographic\nQCD model with a generic dilaton profile. The effective potential induced by a\nhigher power dilaton profile is interpreted as a stronger color confinement at\nlong distance, and it gradually evolves to the hard-wall model when the power\nincreases to infinity. As an application, we investigate the exotic meson\nstates recently discovered in experiments in the generic soft-wall model with a\nhigher power dilaton profile, and the results are in agreement with the spectra\nof the exotic mesons. Our calculation indicates a weaker interaction at short\ndistance and a stronger interaction at large distance for the components in the\nexotic mesons. The generic dilaton profile deserves further scrutiny for\nunderstanding the strong interaction and for applications.\n", "  We construct the photon added coherent states of a noncommutative harmonic\noscillator associated to a $q$-deformed oscillator algebra. Various\nnonclassical properties of the corresponding system are explored, first, by\nstudying two different types of higher order quadrature squeezing, namely the\nHillery-type and the Hong--Mandel-type and, second, by testing the\nsub-Poissonian nature of photon statistics in higher order with the help of the\ncorrelation function and the Mandel parameter. By comparing our results with\nthose of the usual harmonic oscillator, we notice that the quadratures and\nphoton number distributions in noncommutative case are more squeezed for the\nsame values of the parameters and, thus, the photon added coherent states of\nnoncommutative harmonic oscillator may be more nonclassical in comparison to\nthe ordinary harmonic oscillator.\n", "  We report on the magnetic properties of CsCo$_2$Se$_2$ with ThCr$_2$Si$_2$\nstructure, which we have characterized through a series of magnetization and\nneutron diffraction measurements. We find that CsCo$_2$Se2$_2$ undergoes a\nphase transition to an antiferromagnetically ordered state with a N\\'eel\ntemperature of $T_{\\rm N} \\approx$ 66 K. The nearest neighbour interactions are\nferromagnetic as observed by the positive Curie-Weiss temperature of $\\Theta\n\\approx$ 51.0 K. We find that the magnetic structure of CsCo$_2$Se$_2$ consists\nof ferromagnetic sheets, which are stacked antiferromagnetically along the\ntetragonal \\textit{c}-axis, generally referred to as A-type antiferromagnetic\norder. The observed magnitude of the ordered magnetic moment at $T$ = 1.5 K is\nfound to be only 0.20(1)$\\mu_{\\rm Bohr}$/Co. Already in comparably small\nmagnetic fields of $\\mu_0 H_{MM}$(5K) $\\approx$ 0.3 T, we observe a\nmetamagnetic transition that can be attributed to spin-rearrangements of\nCsCo$_2$Se$_2$, with the moments fully ferromagnetically saturated in a\nmagnetic field of $\\mu_0 H_{\\rm FM}$(5K) $\\approx$ 6.4 T. We discuss the entire\nexperimentally deduced magnetic phase diagram for CsCo$_2$Se$_2$ with respect\nto its unconventionally weak magnetic coupling. Our study characterizes\nCsCo$_2$Se$_2$, which is chemically and electronically posed closely to the\n$A_xFe_{2-y}Se_2$ superconductors, as a host of versatile magnetic\ninteractions.\n", "  Scattering amplitudes which describe the interaction of physical states play\nan important role in determining physical observables. In string theory the\nphysical states are given by vibrations of open and closed strings and their\ninteractions are described (at the leading order in perturbation theory) by a\nworld-sheet given by the topology of a disk or sphere, respectively.\n  Formally, for scattering of N strings this leads to N-3-dimensional iterated\nreal integrals along the compactified real axis or N-3-dimensional complex\nsphere integrals, respectively. As a consequence the physical observables are\ndescribed by periods on M_{0,N} - the moduli space of Riemann spheres of N\nordered marked points.\n  The mathematical structure of these string amplitudes share many recent\nadvances in arithmetic algebraic geometry and number theory like multiple zeta\nvalues, single-valued multiple zeta values, Drinfeld, Deligne associators, Hopf\nalgebra and Lie algebra structures related to Grothendiecks Galois theory. We\nreview these results, with emphasis on a beautiful link between generalized\nhypergeometric functions describing the real iterated integrals on M_{0,N}(R)\nand the decomposition of motivic multiple zeta values. Furthermore, a relation\nexpressing complex integrals on M_{0,N}(C) as single-valued projection of\niterated real integrals on M_{0,N}(R) is exhibited.\n", "  We present an up-to-date analysis of muon $g-2$ evaluations in terms of\nMellin-Barnes moments as they might be useful for lattice QCD calculations of\n$a_\\mu$. The moments up to 4th order are evaluated directly in terms of\n$e^+e^-$--annihilation data and improved within the Hidden Local Symmetry (HLS)\nModel, supplied with appropriate symmetry breaking mechanisms. The model\nprovides a reliable Effective Lagrangian (BHLS) estimate of the two-body\nchannels plus the $\\pi\\pi\\pi$ channel up to 1.05~GeV, just including the $\\phi$\nresonance. The HLS piece accounts for 80\\% of the contribution to $a_\\mu$. The\nmissing pieces are evaluated in the standard way directly in terms of the data.\nWe find that the moment expansion converges well in terms of a few moments. The\ntwo types of moments which show up in the Mellin-Barnes representation are\ncalculated in terms of hadronic cross--section data in the timelike region and\nin terms of the hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) function in the spacelike\nregion which is accessible to lattice QCD (LQCD). In the Euclidean the first\ntype of moments are the usual Taylor coefficients of the HVP and we show that\nthe second type of moments may be obtained as integrals over the appropriately\nTaylor truncated HVP function. Specific results for the isovector part of\n$a_\\mu^{\\rm had}$ are determined by means of HLS model predictions in close\nrelation to $\\tau$--decay spectra.\n", "  The article presents four identities containing the spatio-temporal\ndifferential operator also known as four-divergence. These equations are used\nto prove the invariance of wave equation under orthogonal paravector\ntransformations. Moreover, the transformation of equations containing\nspatio-temporal differential operators under the rotation of reference frame\nhas been presented.\n", "  Recent work has shown that a fully many-body treatment of noncovalent\ninteractions, such as that given by the method of many-body dispersion (MBD),\nis vital to accurately modeling the structure and energetics of many molecular\nsystems with density functional theory (DFT). To avoid double counting the\ncorrelation contributions of DFT and the MBD correction, a single-parameter\nrange-separation scheme is typically employed. Coupling the MBD correction to a\ngiven exchange-correlation functional therefore requires calibrating the\nrange-separation parameter. We perform this calibration for 24 popular DFT\nfunctionals by optimizing against the S66x8 benchmark set. Additionally, we\nreport a linear equation that predicts near optimal range-separation\nparameters, dependent only on the class of the exchange functional and the\nvalue of the gradient enhancement factor. When a calibrated MBD correction is\nemployed, most of the exchange-correlation functionals considered are capable\nof achieving agreement with CCSD(T)/CBS interaction energies in the S66x8 set\nto better than 1~kcal/mol mean absolute error.\n", "  An variational expression for the zero temperature polaron impedance is\nobtained by minimizing the free energy in a generalized quadratic Feynman\nmodel. The impedance function of the quadratic model serves as the variational\nparameter. It is shown that a very small change in the energy can be\naccompanied by a large change in the optical conductivity. This is related to\nthe insensitivity of the Jensen-Feynman free energy to the UV properties of the\nmodel. Analytic and numeric results are derived for the Fr\\\"ohlich polaron in\nweak and strong coupling. Standard results are recovered at weak coupling but,\nmore importantly, strong coupling inconsistencies are removed.\n", "  We prove in this paper some results on the complex and fractional powers of\nthe Stokes operator with slip frictionless boundary conditions involving the\nstress tensor. This is fundamental and plays an important role in the\nassociated parabolic problem and will be used to prove maximal $L^{p}-L^{q}$\nregularity results for the non-homogeneous Stokes problem.\n", "  The formation of the disk and feedback from supernova winds impacts the\ndistribution of dark matter in galaxies. Recently, Di Cintio et al. (2014b)\ncharacterized the halo response from baryonic processes in hydrodynamical\nsimulations via a dependence on the ratio of stellar-to-halo mass\n($M_{\\star}/M_{{\\rm halo}}$). The (stellar) mass dependent halo profile links\ntogether the local and global properties of the halo (e.g. inner slope and\n$M_{{\\rm halo}}$) which allows for measurements of $M_{{\\rm halo}}$ without\nvirial tracers. We compile a large sample of rotation curves from the\nliterature to test this halo profile. We find that this halo profile can\nexplain rotation curve observations over a wide range of $M_{\\star}$. However,\nthe global results from our sample are inconsistent with a $\\Lambda$ cold dark\nmatter universe. We do not find the expected correlation between the halo\nconcentration and $M_{{\\rm halo}}$ and there is significantly larger scatter\nthan expected. Furthermore, a large portion of galaxies below $M_{\\star} \\sim\n10^{9}\\,M_{\\odot}$ are found to be hosted by smaller halos than expectations\nfrom the abundance matching technique. We find our results are robust to\nstatistical priors and systematic effects such as inclination angle, asymmetric\ndrift correction, data source, and uncertainties in stellar mass-to-light\nratios. This suggests either a mischaracterization of the halo response due to\nbaryonic processes or additional non-standard dark matter physics.\n", "  This paper gives a systematic method for constructing an N-body potential,\napproximating the true potential, that accurately captures meso-scale behavior\nof the chemical or biological system using pairwise potentials coming from\nexperimental data or ab initio methods. The meso-scale behavior is translated\ninto logic rules for the dynamics. Each pairwise potential has an associated\nlogic function that is constructed using the logic rules, a class of elementary\nlogic functions, and AND, OR, and NOT gates. The effect of each logic function\nis to turn its associated potential on and off. The N-body potential is\nconstructed as linear combination of the pairwise potentials, where the\n\"coefficients\" of the potentials are smoothed versions of the associated logic\nfunctions. These potentials allow a potentially low-dimensional description of\ncomplex processes while still accurately capturing the relevant physics at the\nmeso-scale. We present the proposed formalism to construct coarse-grained\npotential models for three examples: an inhibitor molecular system, bond\nbreaking in chemical reactions, and DNA transcription from biology. The method\ncan potentially be used in reverse for design of molecular processes by\nspecifying properties of molecules that can carry them out.\n", "  We introduce squeezed vacua in loop quantum gravity, a new overcomplete basis\nof states that contain prescribable correlations between geometric operators.\nWe study the behavior of long-range correlations and discuss the relevance of\nthese states for the reconstruction of a semiclassical spacetime from loop\nquantum gravity.\n", "  The statement that Maxwell's electrodynamics in vacuum is already covariant\nunder Lorentz transformations is commonplace in the literature. We analyse the\nactual meaning of that statement and demonstrate that Maxwell's equations are\nperfectly fit to be Lorentz-covariant; they become Lorentz-covariant if we\nconstruct to be so, by postulating certain transformation properties of field\nfunctions. In Aristotelian terms, the covariance is a plain potentiality, but\nnot necessarily entelechy.\n", "  We present a statistical mechanical theory of the process of annotating an\nobject with terms selected from an ontology. The term selection process is\nformulated as an ideal lattice gas model, but in a highly structured\ninhomogeneous field. The model enables us to explain patterns recently observed\nin real-world annotation data sets, in terms of the underlying graph structure\nof the ontology. By relating the external field strengths to the information\ncontent of each node in the ontology graph, the statistical mechanical model\nalso allows us to propose a number of practical metrics for assessing the\nquality of both the ontology, and the annotations that arise from its use.\nUsing the statistical mechanical formalism we also study an ensemble of\nontologies of differing size and complexity; an analysis not readily performed\nusing real data alone. Focusing on regular tree ontology graphs we uncover a\nrich set of scaling laws describing the growth in the optimal ontology size as\nthe number of objects being annotated increases. In doing so we provide a\nfurther possible measure for assessment of ontologies.\n", "  We develop a numerical method to reconstruct systems of ordinary differential\nequations (ODEs) from time series data without {\\it a priori} knowledge of the\nunderlying ODEs using sparse basis learning and sparse function reconstruction.\nWe show that employing sparse representations provides more accurate ODE\nreconstruction compared to least-squares reconstruction techniques for a given\namount of time series data. We test and validate the ODE reconstruction method\non known 1D, 2D, and 3D systems of ODEs. The 1D system possesses two stable\nfixed points; the 2D system possesses an oscillatory fixed point with closed\norbits; and the 3D system displays chaotic dynamics on a strange attractor. We\ndetermine the amount of data required to achieve an error in the reconstructed\nfunctions to less than $0.1\\%$. For the reconstructed 1D and 2D systems, we are\nable to match the trajectories from the original ODEs even at long times. For\nthe 3D system with chaotic dynamics, as expected, the trajectories from the\noriginal and reconstructed systems do not match at long times, but the\nreconstructed and original models possess similar Lyapunov exponents. Now that\nwe have validated this ODE reconstruction method on known models, it can be\nemployed in future studies to identify new systems of ODEs using time series\ndata from deterministic systems for which there is no currently known ODE\nmodel.\n", "  We present a theoretical and experimental study of the generation of photon\npairs through the process of spontaneous four wave mixing (SFWM) in a few-mode,\nbirefringent fiber. Under these conditions, multiple SFWM processes are in fact\npossible, each associated with a different combination of transverse modes for\nthe four waves involved. We show that in the weakly guiding regime, for which\nthe propagation modes may be well approximated by linearly polarized modes, the\ndeparture from circular symmetry due to the fiber birefringence translates into\nconservation rules which retain elements from azimuthal and rectangular\nsymmetries: both OAM and parity must be conserved for a process to be viable.\nWe have implemented a SFWM source based on a \"bow-tie\" birefringent fiber, and\nhave measured for a collection of pump wavelengths the SFWM spectra of each of\nthe signal and idler photons in coincidence with its partner photon. We have\nused this information, together with knowledge of the transverse modes into\nwhich the signal and idler photons are emitted, as input for a genetic\nalgorithm which accomplishes two tasks: i) the identification of the particular\nSFWM processes which are present in the source, and ii) the characterization of\nthe fiber used.\n", "  We have designed and implemented a photon-pair source, based on the\nspontaneous four wave mixing (SFWM) process in a few-mode fiber, in a geometry\nwhich permits multiple, simultaneous SFWM processes, each associated with a\ndistinct combination of transverse modes for the four participating waves. In\nour source: i) each process is group-velocity-matched so that it is, by design,\nnearly-factorable, and ii) the spectral separation between neighboring\nprocesses is greater than the marginal spectral width of each process.\nConsequently, there is a direct correspondence between the joint amplitude of\neach process and each of the Schmidt mode pairs of the overall two-photon\nstate. Our approach permits hybrid entanglement in discrete frequency and in\ntransverse mode, whereby control of the number of supported fiber transverse\nmodes allows scalability to higher dimensions while spectral filtering may be\nused for straightforward Schmidt mode discrimination.\n", "  When two pedestrians travelling in opposite directions approach one another,\neach must decide on which side (the left or the right) they will attempt to\npass. If both make the same choice then passing can be completed with ease,\nwhile if they make opposite choices an embarrassing stand-off or collision can\noccur. Pedestrians who encounter each other frequently can establish \"social\nnorms\" that bias this decision. In this study we investigate the effect of\nbinary decision-making by pedestrians when passing on the dynamics of\npedestrian flows in order to study the emergence of a social norm in crowds\nwith a mixture of individual biases. Such a situation may arise, for instance,\nwhen individuals from different communities mix at a large sporting event or at\ntransport hubs. We construct a phase diagram that shows that a social norm can\nstill emerge provided pedestrians are sufficiently attentive to the choices of\nothers in the crowd. We show that this collective behaviour has the potential\nto greatly influence the dynamics of pedestrians, including the breaking of\nsymmetry by the formation of lanes.\n", "  Unique catalytic potential of metal surfaces has encouraged a great number of\nbasic and applied studies. The manuscript highlights the general regularities\nin a field on the grounds of strong interrelation between catalytic, kinetic\nand thermodynamic behaviour of the reaction system. The trials of the catalytic\nNH3 synthesis and the oscillatory NO+H2 reaction have revealed that the\nthermodynamics of the local structure determines the properties and\nmultiplicity of the reaction intermediates enabling the peculiar macroscopic\nkinetics and specific catalytic activity. Structure and activity of catalytic\nsites are correlated within a realistic model, where total undercoordination of\nadjacent surface atoms and enthalpy of local reaction is taken as a descriptor\nfor structure and activity, respectively. The model has specified the resonant\ncatalytic centers for NH3 synthesis on metal surfaces in close agreement with\nexperimental data. The basal planes of noble metals are less active than Fe-\nand Ru-based catalysts, whereas an extraordinary activity of small Pt, Ir and\nRh clusters can be expected. A strong advantage of imperfections compared to\nperfect areas in the surface wave nucleation is evaluated. Isothermal rate\noscillations in open heterogeneous catalytic reaction systems are expected\nunder the multiplicity of reaction intermediates fairly different in activity,\nproviding the steady state and reaction rout multiplicity. Switching between\nactive and inactive kinetic brunches gives rise to the explosive coverage\nchangeover that can be visualized as a traveling wave. A single pattern of\noscillations in the NO+H2 reaction includes the key role of intermediate NHad\nspecies providing the catalytic removal of strongly bound nitrogen. The driving\nforces, the feedback, and chemical interactions within the traveling waves are\nclearly understood.\n", "  We present two schemes for joint remote preparation of an arbitrary\nfour-qubit j\\c{hi}i -type entangled state via three three- and (N+1)-qubit GHZ\nstates as the quantum channel, respectively. In these schemes, two senders (or\nN senders) share the original state which they wish to help the receiver to\nremotely prepare. To complete the JRSP schemes, several novel sets of mutually\northogonal basis vectors are introduced. It is shown that, only if two senders\n(or N senders) collaborate with each other, and perform projective measurements\nunder suitable measuring basis on their own qubits respectively, the receiver\ncan reconstruct the original state by means of some appropriate unitary\noperations and suitable C-NOT gates. Compared with the previous schemes for the\nJRSP of four-qubit |\\c{hi}>-type state, the advantages of the present schemes\nare that the total successful probability of JRSP can reach 1 and the\nentanglement resource can be reduced\n", "  Finding the electromagnetic (EM) counterpart is critically important for a\ngravitational wave event. Although many efforts have been made to search for\nthe purported EM counterpart of GW150914, the first gravitational wave event\ndetected by LIGO, only Fermi/GBM reported an excess above background (i.e.\nGW150914-GBM) at 0.4 s after the LIGO trigger time, that is possibly associated\nwith this GW event (Connaughton et al. 2016). However, since there is no\nsignificant detection by the INTEGRAL/SPI-ACS around the time of GW150914-GBM,\na great debate has been raised about whether GW150914-GBM is of astrophysical\norigin and associated with the GW150914 (Savchenko et al. 2016). In order to\nanswer this question, we re-analyzed the GBM data with a straightforward but\nsophisticated method. We find that the excess of GW150914-GBM mostly comes from\nthose detectors with bad viewing angles to the GW event, whereas the good\nviewing detectors see nothing significant beyond background fluctuation around\nthe trigger time of GW150914. This finding suggests that GW150914-GBM is very\nunlikely associated with the GW150914. Given that GW150914-GBM is the only\nevent found by GBM that is possibly associated with this GW event in a\ncomprehensive search, we conclude that GBM did not detect any electromagnetic\nradiation from the GW150914.\n", "  The investigation of fragile and potentially inhomogeneous forms of\nferromagnetic order under extreme conditions, such as low temperatures and high\npressures, is of central interest for areas such as geophysics, correlated\nelectron systems, as well as the optimization of materials synthesis for\napplications where particular material properties are required. We report\nneutron depolarization imaging measurements on the weak ferromagnet Ni$_3$Al\nunder pressures up to 10kbar using a Cu:Be clamp cell. Using a polychromatic\nneutron beam with wavelengths $\\lambda\\geq$ 4\\AA in combination with $^3$He\nneutron spin filter cells as polarizer and analyzer we were able to track\ndifferences of the pressure response in inhomogeneous samples by virtue of high\nresolution neutron depolarization imaging. This provides spatially resolved and\nnon-destructive access to the pressure dependence of the magnetic properties of\ninhomogeneous ferromagnetic materials.\n", "  Cross-control of a material property - manipulation of a physical quantity\n(e.g., magnetisation) by a nonconjugate field (e.g., electrical field) - is a\nchallenge in fundamental science and also important for technological device\napplications. It has been demonstrated that magnetic properties can be\ncontrolled by electrical and optical stimuli in various magnets. Here we find\nthat heat-treatment allows the control over two competing magnetic phases in\nthe Mn-doped polar semiconductor GeTe. The onset temperatures $T_{\\rm c}$ of\nferromagnetism vary at low Mn concentrations by a factor of five to six with a\nmaximum $T_{\\rm c} \\approx 180$ K, depending on the selected phase. Analyses in\nterms of synchrotron x-ray diffraction and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy\nindicate a possible segregation of the Mn ions, which is responsible for the\nhigh-$T_{\\rm c}$ phase. More importantly, we demonstrate that the two states\ncan be switched back and forth repeatedly from either phase by changing the\nheat-treatment of a sample, thereby confirming magnetic phase-change- memory\nfunctionality.\n", "  Terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs) are the most energetic photon phenomenon\noccurring naturally on Earth. An outstanding question is as follows: Are these\nflashes just a rare exotic phenomenon or are they an intrinsic part of\nlightning discharges and therefore occurring more frequently than previously\nthought? All measurements of TGFs so far have been limited by the dynamic range\nand sensitivity of spaceborne instruments. In this paper we show that there is\na new population of weak TGFs that has not been identified by search\nalgorithms. We use the World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) to\nidentify lightning that occurred in 2006 and 2012 within the 800 km field of\nview of Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI). By\nsuperposing 740,210 100 ms RHESSI data intervals, centered at the time of the\nWWLLN detected lightning, we identify at least 141 and probably as many as 191\nweak TGFs that were not part of the second RHESSI data catalogue. This supports\nthe suggestion that the global TGF production rate is larger than previously\nreported.\n", "  When the magnetic vector potential is expressed in terms of the magnetic\nfield it, is found to be explicitly non-local in space. This gives support to\nthe conclusions of Aharonov et al. in a recent comment, that the Aharonov-Bohm\neffect may be interpreted as being either due to a local gauge potential or\nelse due to non-local gauge-invariant fields but not due to local\ngauge-invariant fields.\n", "  We generate the non-separable state of polarization and orbital angular\nmomentum (OAM) using a laser beam. The generated state undergoes a cyclic\npolarization evolution which introduces a Pancharatnam geometric phase to the\npolarization state and in turn a relative phase in the non-separable state. We\nexperimentally study the violation of Bell - CHSH inequality for different\nPancharatnam phases introduced by various cyclic polarization evolutions with\nlinear and circular states as measurement bases. While measuring in linear\nbases, the Bell-CHSH parameter oscillates with Pancharatnam phase. One can\novercome this dependence by introducing a relative phase in one of the\nprojecting state. However for measurement in circular bases, the Pancharatnam\nphase does not affect the Bell-CHSH violation.\n", "  A simulation of ellipsoidal particles inside a fluid flow is presented and\nvalidated from our own lab size experiments where data has been recorded using\na camera set-up and post-processing of the pictures. The model is based on\nJeffery's equation, where the orientation and position of the particles are\ninfluenced by the surrounding fluid. Additionally, particle-particle\ninteraction and particle-wall interaction are taken into account.\n", "  A review of recent measurements of top-quark properties is presented.\nInclusive and differential top-quark pair charge asymmetry measurements using\nthe full Run I dataset are found to be in agreement with the standard model\n(SM) predictions. Results of spin correlation in top-quark pairs are presented\nand interpreted in terms of the SM predicted values and new physics models.\nLimits are set on flavour-changing neutral currents (FCNC), in particular with\na Higgs boson in the final state.\n", "  A Drag-Free CubeSat mission has been proposed to demonstrate the feasibility\nof a Gravitational Reference Sensor (GRS) with an optical readout for a 3 units\n(3U) spacecraft. A purely drag-free object is defined by the absence of all\nexternal forces other than gravity, which are shielded by the spacecraft. In a\nreal case, the TM will still be affected by disturbances. Several of them are\npassively reduced by the design of the TM housing. This system is a\nthick-walled aluminium box that holds the shadow sensors and shields the TM.\nThe housing has an effect on the mechanical, thermal and magnetic environment\naround the TM. All of them have been analysed. The mechanical vibrations have\nto fit the launch environment and the modes have to be outside of the\nmeasurement range (0.0001 - 1 Hz). The magnetic field has to be reduced by a\n0.01 factor. The temperature difference between internal opposing surfaces,\ndetermining pressure on the TM, has to be below 10^-3(1 mHz/f)1/3 K Hz^-1/2.\nThe housing, together with the TM, the sensors and the UV LEDs for charging\ncontrol, constitutes the GRS, which would then fit into a 1U. The other 2Us are\noccupied by the caging mechanism that constraints the TM during launch, the\nthrusters, the Attitude Determination And Control System (ADACS) and the\nelectronics. The Drag-Free CubeSat will be the result of the combined efforts\nof Stanford, University of Florida, KACST and NASA and will be the first\ndrag-free mission with an optical readout and the first GRS designed within the\nlimits of a 3U small satellite. In the first section, this paper briefly\nupdates on the main characteristics and systems of the project. Particular\nemphasis is then given to the recently designed housing, its expected\nperformance and the open issues.\n", "  The thermoelectric power of the two-dimensional electron system (2DES) at the\nLaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface is explored below room temperature, in comparison with\nthat of Nb-doped SrTiO3 single crystals. For the interface we find a region\nbelow T =50 K where thermopower is dominated by phonon-drag, whose amplitude is\nhugely amplified with respect to the corresponding bulk value, reaching values\n~mV/K and above. The phonon-drag enhancement at the interface is traced back to\nthe tight carrier confinement of the 2DES, and represents a sharp signature of\nstrong electron-acoustic phonon coupling at the interface.\n", "  We show that alloying with rare earth metals (REMs) can dramatically improve\nthe machineability of a range of titanium alloys, even though the REM is not\nincorporated in the alloy matrix. The mechanism for this is that under cutting,\nshear bands are formed within which the nano-precipitates of REM are shear\nmixed. This lowers the melting point such that the mechanism of deformation\nchanges from dislocation mechanism to localised amorphisation and shear\nsoftening. The material then fractures along the thin, amorphous shear-band.\nOutside the shear band, the REM remains as precipitates. The new alloys have\nsimilar mechanical properties and biocompatibility to conventional materials.\n", "  We present an analysis of the presence of substructures in the stellar stream\nof the Palomar 5 globular cluster, as derived from Sloan Digital Sky Survey\ndata. Using a matched filter technique, we recover the positions and sizes of\noverdensities reported in previous studies. To explore the reality of these\nstructures, we also create an artificial model of the stream, in which we\nconstruct a realistic background on top of which we add a perfectly smooth\nstream structure, taking into account the effects of photometric completeness\nand interstellar extinction. We find that the smooth artificial stream then\nshows similarly-pronounced substructures as the real structure. Interestingly,\nour best-fit N-body simulation does display real projected density variations\nlinked to stellar epicyclic motions, but these become less significant when\ntaking into account the SDSS star-count constraints. The substructures found\nwhen applying our matched filter technique to the N-body particles converted\ninto observable stars are thus mostly unrelated to these epicyclic motions.\nThis analysis suggests that the majority of the previously-detected\nsubstructures along the tidal tail of Palomar 5 are artefacts of observational\ninhomogeneities.\n", "  We present three terrestrial gamma ray flashes (TGFs) observed over the\nMediterranean basin by the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscope Imager\n(RHESSI) satellite. Since the occurrence of these events in the Mediterranean\nregion is quite rare, the characterisation of the events was optimised by\ncombining different approaches in order to better define the cloud of origin.\nThe TGFs on 7 November 2004 and 16 October 2006 came from clouds with cloud top\nhigher than 10-12 km where often a strong penetration into the stratosphere is\nfound. This kind of cloud is usually associated with heavy precipitation and\nintense lightning activity. Nevertheless, the analysis of the cloud type based\non satellite retrievals shows that the TGF on 27 May 2004 was produced by an\nunusual shallow convection. This result appears to be supported by the model\nsimulation of the particle distribution and phase in the upper troposphere. The\nTGF on 7 November 2004 is among the brightest ever measured by RHESSI. The\nanalysis of the energy spectrum of this event is consistent with a production\naltitude $\\leq$12 km, which is in the upper part of the cloud, as found by the\nmeteorological analysis of the TGF-producing thunderstorm. This event must be\nunusually bright at the source in order to produce such a strong signal in\nRHESSI. We estimate that this TGF must contain $\\sim$3x10$\\rm ^{18}$ initial\nphotons with energy $>$1 MeV. This is 1 order of magnitude brighter than\nearlier estimations of an average RHESSI TGF.\n", "  Minkowski space is the local model of 3 dimensionnal flat spacetimes. Recent\nprogress in the description of globally hyperbolic flat spacetimes showed\nstrong link between Lorentzian geometry and Teichm{\\\"u}ller space. We notice\nthat Lorentzian generalisations of conical singularities are useful for the\nendeavours of descripting flat spacetimes, creating stronger links with\nhyperbolic geometry and compactifying spacetimes. In particular massive\nparticles and extreme BTZ singular lines arise naturally. This paper is\nthree-fold. First, prove background local properties which will be useful for\nfuture work. Second, generalise fundamental theorems of the theory of globally\nhyperbolic flat spacetimes. Third, defining BTZ-extension and proving it\npreserves Cauchy-maximality and Cauchy-completeness.\n", "  A phenomenon of weak transient chaos is discussed that is caused by\nsub-exponential divergence of trajectories in the basin of a non-chaotic\nattractor. Such a regime is not easy to detect, because conventional\ncharacteristics, such as the largest Lyapunov exponent is non-positive. Here we\nstudy, how such a divergence can be exposed and detected. First, we show that\nweak transient chaos can be exposed if a small random perturbation is added to\nthe system, leading to positive values of the largest Lyapunov exponent.\nSecond, we introduce an alternative definition of the Lyapunov exponent, which\nallows us to detect weak transient chaos in the deterministic unperturbed\nsystem. We show that this novel characteristic becomes positive, reflecting\ntransient chaos. We demonstrate this phenomenon and its detection using a\nmaster-slave system where the master possesses a heteroclinic cycle attractor,\nwhile the slave is the Van-der-Pol-Duffing oscillator possessing a stable limit\ncycle.\n", "  A partially-wetting sessile drop is driven by a sinusoidal pressure field\nthat produces capillary waves on the liquid/gas interface. The analysis\npresented in Part 1 of this series (Bostwick & Steen 2014) is extended by\ncomputing response diagrams and phase shifts for the viscous droplet, whose\nthree phase contact-line moves with contact-angle that is a smooth function of\nthe contact line speed. Viscous dissipation is incorporated through the viscous\npotential flow approximation and the critical Ohnesorge number bounding regions\nbeyond which a given mode becomes over-damped is computed. Davis dissipation\noriginating from the contact-line speed condition leads to damped oscillations\nfor drops with finite contact-line mobility, even for inviscid fluids. The\ncritical mobility and associated driving frequency to generate the largest\nDavis dissipation is computed. Lastly, regions of modal coexistence where two\nmodes can be simultaneously excited by a single forcing frequency are\nidentified. Predictions compare favorably to related experiments on vibrated\ndrops.\n", "  In this paper, I review the main trends in voting in national elections in\nRussia since 1991, discuss the evidence of manipulation or falsification by the\nauthorities, and use statistical techniques to examine the determinants of\nvoting trends.\n", "  Brownian dynamics is a popular fine-grained method for simulating systems of\ninteracting particles, such as chemical reactions. Though the method is simple\nto simulate, it is generally assumed that the dynamics is impossible to solve\nexactly and analytically, aside from some trivial systems. We here give the\nfirst exact analytical solution to a non-trivial Brownian dynamics system: the\nreaction $A+B\\xrightleftharpoons[]{}C$ in equilibrium in one-dimensional\nperiodic space. The solution is a function of the particles' diffusion\ncoefficients, radii, length of space and unbinding distance.\n", "  We discuss some applications of fusion rules and intertwining operators in\nthe representation theory of cyclic orbifolds of the triplet vertex operator\nalgebra. We prove that the classification of irreducible modules for the\norbifold vertex algebra W(p)^{A_m} follows from a conjectural fusion rules\nformula for the singlet vertex algebra modules. In the p=2 case, we computed\nfusion rules for the irreducible singlet vertex algebra modules by using\nintertwining operators. This result implies the classification of irreducible\nmodules for W(2)^{A_m}, conjectured previously in [4]. The main technical tool\nis a new deformed realization of the triplet and singlet vertex algebras, which\nis used to construct certain intertwining operators that can not be detected by\nusing standard free field realizations.\n", "  X-ray emission by sparks implies bremsstrahlung from a population of\nenergetic electrons, but the details of this process remain a mystery. We\npresent detailed statistical analysis of X-ray spectra detected by multiple\ndetectors during sparks produced by 1 MV negative high-voltage pulses with 1\n$\\mu$s risetime. With over 900 shots, we statistically analyze the signals,\nassuming that the distribution of spark X-ray fluence behaves as a power law\nand that the energy spectrum of X-rays detectable after traversing $\\sim$2 m of\nair and a thin aluminum shield is exponential. We then determine the parameters\nof those distributions by fitting cumulative distribution functions to the\nobservations. The fit results match the observations very well if the mean of\nthe exponential X-ray energy distribution is 86 $\\pm$ 7 keV and the spark X-ray\nfluence power law distribution has index -1.29 $\\pm$ 0.04 and spans at least 3\norders of magnitude in fluence.\n", "  Cosmological measurements of the radiation density in the early universe can\nbe used as a sensitive probe of physics beyond the standard model. Observations\nof primordial light element abundances have long been used to place non-trivial\nconstraints on models of new physics and to inform our understanding of the\nthermal history to the first few minutes of our present phase of expansion.\nPrecision measurements of the angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave\nbackground temperature and polarization will drastically improve our\nmeasurement of the cosmic radiation density over the next decade. These\nimproved measurements will either uncover new physics or place much more\nstringent constraints on physics beyond the standard model, while pushing our\nunderstanding of the early universe to much earlier times.\n", "  Since 2008 we have run an observational program to accurately measure the\ncharacteristics of known exoplanet systems hosting close-in transiting giant\nplanets, i.e. hot Jupiters. Our study is based on high-quality photometric\nfollow-up observations of transit events with an array of medium-class\ntelescopes, which are located in both the northern and the southern\nhemispheres. A high photometric precision is achieved through the\ntelescope-defocussing technique. The data are then reduced and analysed in a\nhomogeneous way for estimating the orbital and physical parameters of both the\nplanets and their parent stars. We also make use of multi-band imaging cameras\nfor probing planetary atmospheres via the transmission-photometry technique. In\nsome cases we adopt a two-site observational strategy for collecting\nsimultaneous light curves of individual transits, which is the only completely\nreliable method for truly distinguishing a real astrophysical signal from\nsystematic noise. In this contribution we review the main results of our\nprogram.\n", "  In our paper, we considered how to apply the traditional Feynman path\nintegral to string field. By constructing the complete set in Fock space of\nnon-relativistic and relativistic open bosonic string fields, we extended\nFeynman path integral to path integral on functional field and use it to\nquantize open bosonic string field.\n", "  We provide a schematic framework for understanding observations of jet\nsuppression in soft state black hole X-ray binaries based on the\nBlandford-Payne process and the net magnetic flux threading the black hole. Due\nto the geometrical thinness of soft state disks, mass-loading of field lines is\nineffective compared to both geometrically thick disks as well as thin disks\nwith greater black hole threading flux, a simple physical picture that allows\nus to understand the weakness of jets in radiatively efficient thin disks\naccreting in the prograde direction around high-spinning black holes. Despite a\nsimplicity that forbids insights into the complexity of turbulent-driven\nevolution or the physics of the observed short-term time variability, we show\nhow the breadth of this framework is such that it can serve as a coarse-grained\nfoundation for understanding black hole accretion and jet formation across the\nmass scale.\n", "  In this work we use the fundamental in quantum optics Jaynes-Cummings model\nto study the response of spin $\\tfrac12$ chain to a single mode of a laser\nlight falling on one of the spins, a focused interaction model between the\nlight and the spin chain. For the spin-spin interaction along the chain we use\nthe XY model. We report here the exact analytical results, obtained with the\nhelp of a computer algebra system, for the energy spectrum in this model for\nchains of up to 4 spins with nearest neighbors interactions, either for open or\ncyclic chain configurations. Varying the sign and magnitude of the spin\nexchange coupling relative to the light-spin interaction we have investigated\nboth cases of ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic spin chains.\n", "  We discuss the factors influencing the formation and gravitational\nfragmentation of protostellar discs. We start with a review of how observations\nof prestellar cores can be analysed statistically to yield plausible initial\nconditions for simulations of their subsequent collapse. Simulations based on\nthese initial conditions show that, despite the low levels of turbulence in\nprestellar cores, they deliver primary protostars and associated discs which\nare routinely subject to stochastic impulsive perturbations; consequently\nmisalignment of the spins and orbits of protostars are common. Also, the\nsimulations produce protostars that collectively have a mass function and\nbinary statistics matching those observed in nearby star formation regions, but\nonly if a significant fraction of the turbulent energy in the core is\nsolenoidal, and accretion onto the primary protostar is episodic with a duty\ncycle > 3000 yr. Under this circumstance a core typically spawns between 4 and\n5 protostars, with high efficiency, and the lower-mass protostars are mainly\nformed by disc fragmentation. The requirement that a proto-fragment in a disc\nlose thermal energy on a dynamical timescale dictates that {\\bf there is a\nsweet spot for} disc fragmentation at radii 70 AU < R < 100 AU and temperatures\n10 K < T < 20 K, and this might explain the Brown Dwarf Desert.\n", "  We revisited gluon bremsstrahlung off a heavy quark in nuclear matter within\nhigher twist formalism. In this work, we demonstrate that, in addition to\ntransverse momentum diffusion parameter ($\\hat q$), the gluon emission spectrum\nfor a heavy quark is quite sensitive to $\\hat e$, which quantify the amount of\nlight-cone drag experienced by a parton. This effect leads to an additional\nenergy loss term for heavy-quarks. From heavy flavor suppression data in\nultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions one can now estimate the value of this\nsub-leading non-perturbative jet transport parameter ($\\hat e$) from our\nresults.\n", "  The observed excess in the diphoton mass spectrum around 750 GeV at the 13\nTeV LHC possibly indicates the presence of a photonphilic resonance. We show\nthat the excess can be explained by a scalar of the type involved in\nBekenstein's framework for varying electromagnetic coupling theories. The\nscalar, in our model, couples dominantly to photons and is mainly produced by\nthe quark-quark fusion at the LHC. In addition, it can also be produced in\nphoton-photon fusion. Our model has only two free parameters, the mass of the\nscalar and the scale of the new physics, which are fixed by the LHC excess to\n750 GeV and 1.5 - 2 TeV, respectively. The scalar has a large three-body decay\nto a fermion pair and a photon, which provides an interesting search channel\nwith a dilepton-photon resonance around 750 GeV.\n", "  We study quantum corrections to the scalar potential in classically scale\ninvariant theories, using a manifestly scale invariant regularization. To this\npurpose, the subtraction scale $\\mu$ of the dimensional regularization is\ngenerated after spontaneous scale symmetry breaking, from a subtraction\nfunction of the fields, $\\mu(\\phi,\\sigma)$. This function is then uniquely\ndetermined from general principles showing that it depends on the dilaton only,\nwith $\\mu(\\sigma)\\sim \\sigma$. The result is a scale invariant one-loop\npotential $U$ for a higgs field $\\phi$ and dilaton $\\sigma$ that contains an\nadditional {\\it finite} quantum correction $\\Delta U(\\phi,\\sigma)$, beyond the\nColeman Weinberg term. $\\Delta U$ contains new, non-polynomial effective\noperators like $\\phi^6/\\sigma^2$ whose quantum origin is explained. A flat\ndirection is maintained at the quantum level, the model has vanishing vacuum\nenergy and the one-loop correction to the mass of $\\phi$ remains small without\ntuning (of its self-coupling, etc) beyond the initial, classical tuning (of the\ndilaton coupling) that enforces a hierarchy $\\langle\\sigma\\rangle\\gg\n\\langle\\phi\\rangle$. The approach is useful to models that investigate scale\nsymmetry at the quantum level.\n", "  We study relationships between the restricted unrolled quantum group\n$\\overline{U}_q^H(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ at $2r$-th root of unity $q=e^{\\pi i/r}, r\n\\geq 2$, and the singlet vertex operator algebra $\\mathcal M(r)$. We use\ndeformable families of modules to efficiently compute $(1, 1)$-tangle\ninvariants colored with projective modules of\n$\\overline{U}_q^H(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. These relate to the colored Alexander\ntangle invariants studied in [ADO, M1]. It follows that the regularized\nasymptotic dimensions of characters of $\\mathcal M(r)$ coincide with the\ncorresponding modified traces of open Hopf link invariants. We also discuss\nvarious categorical properties of $\\mathcal M(r)$-mod in connection to braided\ntensor categories.\n", "  Here We present the structural studies on MnTi1-xRuxO3(x=0, 0.2) compounds.\nThe role of Ti ions in the magnetism of MnTiO3 was unclear so here this issue\nhas been tried to address in this manuscript. The magnetic susceptibility data\nshows that the 3-dimensional magnetic character has been improved in the doped\nMnTiO3. The x=0 compound goes paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic phase at a\ntemperature 64K followed by a broad peak at a temperature 100K . But in x=0.2\ncompound the antiferromagnetic transition temperature has been shifted towards\nthe lower temperature to 47.5K with a broad peak at temperature 79K. On the\ndoping of Ru at Ti site a sharp anomaly is observed 47.5K in the case of x=0.2\ncompound. This sharp anomaly attributes to the improved 3D character of\nmagnetism in this compound which is weak in x=0 compound.\n", "  A model of global magnetic reconnection rate in relativistic collisionless\nplasmas is developed and validated by the fully kinetic simulation. Through\nconsidering the force balance at the upstream and downstream of the diffusion\nregion, we show that the global rate is bounded by a value $\\sim 0.3$ even when\nthe local rate goes up to $\\sim O(1)$ and the local inflow speed approaches the\nspeed of light in strongly magnetized plasmas. The derived model is general and\ncan be applied to magnetic reconnection under widely different circumstances.\n", "  In this article we characterize optoacoustic signals generated from layered\ntissue phantoms via short laser pulses by experimental and numerical means. In\nparticular, we consider the case where scattering is effectively negligible and\nthe absorbed energy density follows Beer-Lambert's law, i.e. is characterized\nby an exponential decay within the layers and discontinuities at interfaces. We\ncomplement experiments on samples with multiple layers, where the material\nproperties are known a priori, with numerical calculations for a pointlike\ndetector, tailored to suit our experimental setup. Experimentally, we\ncharacterize the acoustic signal observed by a piezoelectric detector in the\nacoustic far-field in backward mode and we discuss the implication of acoustic\ndiffraction on our measurements. We further attempt an inversion of an OA\nsignal in the far-field approximation.\n", "  The observation of charged lepton flavour violation would be a smoking gun\nfor new physics and could help in pinpointing the mechanism at the origin of\nneutrino masses and mixing. We present here our recent studies of lepton\nflavour violating Higgs decays in the inverse seesaw and its supersymmetric\nembedding, two examples of low-scale seesaw mechanisms. We predict branching\nratios as large as $10^{-5}$ for the decays $h\\rightarrow \\tau \\mu$ and $h\n\\rightarrow \\tau e$ in the inverse seesaw, which can be probed in future\ncolliders. Supersymmetric contributions can enhance the branching ratio of\n$h\\rightarrow \\tau \\mu$ up to $1\\%$, making it large enough to explain the\nsmall excess observed by ATLAS and CMS.\n", "  By shining laser light through a nanomechanical beam, we measure the beam's\nthermally driven vibrations and perturb its motion with optical forces at a\nlevel dictated by the Heisenberg measurement-disturbance uncertainty relation.\nSuch quantum backaction is typically difficult to observe at room temperature\nwhere the motion driven by optical quantum intensity fluctuations is many\norders of magnitude smaller than the thermal motion. We demonstrate a\ncross-correlation technique to distinguish optically driven motion from\nthermally driven motion, observing this quantum backaction signature up to room\ntemperature. While it is often difficult to absolutely calibrate optical\ndetection, we use the scale of the quantum correlations, which is determined by\nfundamental constants, to gauge the size of thermal motion, demonstrating a\npath towards absolute thermometry with quantum mechanically calibrated ticks.\n", "  Increasing exposure to arsenic (As) contaminated ground water is a great\nthreat to humanity. Suitable technology for As immobilization and removal from\nwater, especially for As(III) than As(V), is not available yet. However, it is\nknown that As(III) is more toxic than As(V) and most groundwater aquifers,\nparticularly the Gangetic basin in India, is alarmingly contaminated with it.\nIn search of a viable solution here, we took a cue from the natural\nmineralization of Tooeleite, a mineral containing Fe(III) and As(III)ions,\ngrown under acidic condition, in presence of SO42- ions. Complying to this\nnatural process, we could grow and separate Tooeleite-like templates from\nFe(III) and As(III) containing water at overall circumneutral pH and in absence\nof SO42- ions by using highly polar Zn-only ends of wurtzite ZnS nanorods as\ninsoluble nano-acidic-surfaces. The central idea here is to exploit these\ninsoluble nano-acidic-surfaces (called as INAS in the manuscript) as nucleation\ncentres for Tooeleite growth while keeping the overall pH of the aqueous media\nneutral. Therefore, we propose a novel method of artificial mineralization of\nAs(III) by mimicking a natural process at nanoscale.\n", "  Here we demonstrate how the Fermi surface topology and quantum many-body\ninteractions can be manipulated via epitaxial strain in the spin-triplet\nsuperconductor Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ and its isoelectronic counterpart Ba$_2$RuO$_4$\nusing oxide molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), \\emph{in situ} angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), and transport measurements. Near the\ntopological transition of the $\\gamma$ Fermi surface sheet, we observe clear\nsignatures of critical fluctuations, while the quasiparticle mass enhancement\nis found to increase rapidly and monotonically with increasing Ru-O bond\ndistance. Our work demonstrates the possibilities for using epitaxial strain as\na disorder-free means of manipulating emergent properties, many-body\ninteractions, and potentially the superconductivity in correlated materials.\n", "  The purpose of this paper is to show that, thanks to the restoration of the\nlegitimate connection between the current density and the plasma flow velocity\nin Hall magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), Kelvin's Circulation Theorem becomes valid\nin Hall MHD. The ion-flow velocity in the usual circulation integral is now\nreplaced by the canonical ion-flow velocity.\n", "  In this article, we investigate the impact of twisted space-time on the\nphotoelectric effect, i.e., we derive the $\\theta$-deformed threshold\nfrequency. In such a way we indicate that the space-time noncommutativity\nstrongly enhances the photoelectric process.\n", "  A short-pulse laser-driven deuteron beam is generated in the relativistic\ntransparency regime and aimed at a beryllium converter to generate neutrons at\nthe TRIDENT laser facility. These prompt neutrons have been used for active\ninterrogation to detect nuclear materials, the first such demonstration of a\nlaser-driven neutron source. During the experiments, delayed neutrons from\n$^9$Li decay was observed. It was identified by its characteristic half-life of\n178.3 ms. Production is attributed to the nuclear reactions $^9$Be(d,2p)$^9$Li\nand $^9$Be(n,p)$^9$Li inside the beryllium converter itself. These reactions\nhave energy thresholds of 18.42 and 14.26 MeV respectively, and we estimate the\n(d,2p) reaction to be the dominant source of $^9$Li production. Therefore, only\nthe higher-energy portion of the deuteron spectrum contributes to the\nproduction of the delayed neutrons. It was observed that the delayed-neutron\nyield decreases with increasing distance between the converter and the deuteron\nsource. This behavior is consistent with deuteron production with energy\ngreater than $\\sim$20 MeV within a cone with a half-angle greater than\n40$^{\\circ}$. Prompt-neutron time-of-flight measurements at varying separation\nbetween the converter and the laser target indicate that the fast deuteron\npopulation above threshold is severely depleted on axis out to\n$\\sim$20$^{\\circ}$. These measurements are consistent with emission of the fast\ndeuterons (i.e., above 10 MeV/nucleon) in a ring-like fashion around the\ncentral axis. Such an inferred ring-like structure is qualitatively consistent\nwith a documented signature of the breakout afterburner (BOA) laser-plasma ion\nacceleration mechanism. The measurement of $\\beta$-delayed neutrons from $^9$Li\ndecay could provide an important new diagnostic tool for the study of the\nfeatures of the deuteron production mechanism in a non-intrusive way.\n", "  In recent years there has been intense experimental activity to observe solid\nmetallic hydrogen. Wigner and Huntington predicted that under extreme pressures\ninsulating molecular hydrogen would dissociate and transition to atomic\nmetallic hydrogen. Recently Dalladay-Simpson, Howie, and Gregoryanz reported a\nphase transition to an insulating phase in molecular hydrogen at a pressure of\n325 GPa and 300 K. Because of its scientific importance we have scrutinized\ntheir experimental evidence to determine if their claim is justified. Based on\nour analysis, we conclude that they have misinterpreted their data: there is no\nevidence for a phase transition at 325 GPa.\n", "  In turbulent fragmentation, star formation occurs in condensations created by\nconverging flows. The condensations must be sufficiently massive, dense and\ncool to be gravitationally unstable, so that they start to contract; {\\it and}\nthey must then radiate away thermal energy fast enough for self-gravity to\nremain dominant, so that they continue to contract. For the metallicities and\ntemperatures in local star forming clouds, this second requirement is only met\nrobustly when the gas couples thermally to the dust, because this delivers the\ncapacity to radiate across the full bandwidth of the continuum, rather than\njust in a few discrete spectral lines. This translates into a threshold for\nvigorous star formation, which can be written as a minimum ram-pressure Pcrit ~\n4 10^-11 dyne. Pcrit is independent of temperature, and corresponds to flows\nwith molecular hydrogen number-density nH2 and velocity v satisfying nH2 v^2 >\n800 cm^-3 (km/s)^2. This in turn corresponds to a minimum molecular hydrogen\ncolumn-density for vigorous star formation, NH2crit ~ 4 10^21 cm^-2 (SIGMAcrit\n~ 100 MSun pc^-2), and a minimum visual extinction AVcrit ~ 9. The\ncharacteristic diameter and line-density for a star-forming filament when this\nthreshold is just exceeded -- a sweet spot for local star formation regions --\nare 2Rfil ~ 0.1 pc and mufil ~ 13 MSun pc^-2. The characteristic diameter and\nmass for a prestellar core condensing out of such a filament are 2Rcore ~ 0.1\npc, and Mcore ~ MSun. We also show that fragmentation of a shock-compressed\nlayer is likely to commence while the convergent flows creating the layer are\nstill ongoing, and we stress that, under this circumstance, the phenomenology\nand characteristic scales for fragmentation of the layer are fundamentally\ndifferent from those derived traditionally for pre-existing layers.\n", "  In this paper, a comprehensive methodology for characterizing the high power\nresonance behavior of bulk piezoelectric ceramics using the burst method is\ndescribed. In the burst method, the sample is electrically driven at its\nresonance frequency, and then either a short circuit or an open circuit\ncondition is imposed, after which the vibration decays at the resonance or\nantiresonance frequency, respectively. This decay can be used to measure the\nquality factor in either of these conditions. The resulting current in the\nshort circuit vibration condition is related to the vibration velocity through\nthe \"force factor.\" The generated voltage in the open circuit vibration\ncondition corresponds to the displacement by the \"voltage factor.\" The force\nfactor and the voltage factor are related to material properties and physical\ndimensions of the sample. Using this method, the high power behavior of the\npermittivity, compliance, piezoelectric charge constant, electromechanical\ncoupling factor, and material losses can be determined directly by measuring\nthe resonance (short circuit) and antiresonance (open circuit) frequencies,\ntheir corresponding quality factors, the force factor $A$, and the voltage\nfactor $B$. The experimental procedure to apply this method is described and\ndemonstrated on commercially available hard and semi-hard PZT materials of\n$k_{31}$\n", "  In this note, we establish the 2-D Quantum Inequalities - first proved by\nFlanagan - for all CFTs with a causal holographic dual. Following the treatment\nof Kelly \\& Wall, we establish that the Boundary Causality Condition in an\nasymptotic AdS spacetime implies the Quantum Inequalities on the boundary. Our\nresults extend easily to curved spacetime and are stable under deformations of\nthe CFT by relevant operators. We discuss higher dimensional generalizations\nand possible connections to recent bounds on $a/c$ in 4-D CFTs.\n", "  We present results from a generic search for strongly produced supersymmetric\nparticles in pp collisions in the multijet + missing transverse momentum final\nstate. The data sample corresponds to 2.3 fb$^{-1}$ recorded by the CMS\nexperiment at $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV. This search is motivated by supersymmetry\n(SUSY) models that avoid fine-tuning of the higgs mass. In such models, certain\nstrongly produced SUSY particles, including the gluino and top squark, are\npredicted to have masses on the order of a TeV. These particles also have some\nof the highest production cross sections in SUSY and give rise to final states\nwith distinct, high jet multiplicity event signatures. To make the analysis\nsensitive to a wide range of such final states, events are classified by the\nnumber of jets, the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of the jets, the\nvector sum of the transverse momenta of the jets, and the number of b-tagged\njets. No significant excess is observed beyond the standard model (SM)\nexpectation. The results are interpreted as limits on simplified SUSY models.\nIn these models, gluino masses as high as 1600 GeV are excluded at 95\\% CL for\nscenarios with low $\\tilde{\\chi}_{1}^{0}$ mass, exceeding the most stringent\nlimits set in by CMS at $\\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV by more than 200 GeV in several\nsimplified models.\n", "  We report the detection of Ly$\\alpha$ emission at $\\sim9538$\\AA{} in the\nKeck/DEIMOS and \\HST WFC3 G102 grism data from a triply-imaged galaxy at\n$z=6.846\\pm0.001$ behind galaxy cluster MACS J2129.4$-$0741. Combining the\nemission line wavelength with broadband photometry, line ratio upper limits,\nand lens modeling, we rule out the scenario that this emission line is \\oii at\n$z=1.57$. After accounting for magnification, we calculate the weighted average\nof the intrinsic Ly$\\alpha$ luminosity to be\n$\\sim1.3\\times10^{42}~\\mathrm{erg}~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and Ly$\\alpha$ equivalent\nwidth to be $74\\pm15$\\AA{}. Its intrinsic UV absolute magnitude at 1600\\AA{} is\n$-18.6\\pm0.2$ mag and stellar mass $(1.5\\pm0.3)\\times10^{7}~M_{\\odot}$, making\nit one of the faintest (intrinsic $L_{UV}\\sim0.14~L_{UV}^*$) galaxies with\nLy$\\alpha$ detection at $z\\sim7$ to date. Its stellar mass is in the typical\nrange for the galaxies thought to dominate the reionization photon budget at\n$z\\gtrsim7$; the inferred Ly$\\alpha$ escape fraction is high ($\\gtrsim 10$\\%),\nwhich could be common for sub-$L^*$ $z\\gtrsim7$ galaxies with Ly$\\alpha$\nemission. This galaxy offers a glimpse of the galaxy population that is thought\nto drive reionization, and it shows that gravitational lensing is an important\navenue to probe the sub-$L^*$ galaxy population.\n", "  Ever since the Apollo era, a question has remained as to the origin of the\nlunar swirls (high albedo regions coincident with the regions of surface\nmagnetization). Different processes have been proposed for their origin. In\nthis work we test the idea that the lunar swirls have a higher albedo relative\nto surrounding regions because they deflect incoming solar wind particles that\nwould otherwise darken the surface. 3D particle tracking is used to estimate\nthe influence of five lunar magnetic anomalies on incoming solar wind. The\nregions investigated include Mare Ingenii, Gerasimovich, Renier Gamma,\nNorthwest of Apollo and Marginis. Both protons and electrons are tracked as\nthey interact with the anomalous magnetic field and impact maps are calculated.\nThe impact maps are then compared to optical observations and comparisons are\nmade between the maxima and minima in surface fluxes and the albedo and optical\nmaturity of the regions. Results show deflection of slow to typical solar wind\nparticles on a larger scale than the fine scale optical, swirl, features. It is\nfound that efficiency of a particular anomaly for deflection of incoming\nparticles does not only scale directly with surface magnetic field strength,\nbut also is a function of the coherence of the magnetic field. All anomalous\nregions can also produce moderate deflection of fast solar wind particles. The\nanomalies' influence on ~ 1 GeV SEP particles is only apparent as a slight\nmodification of the incident velocities.\n", "  We compute Lyapunov spectra for Coulombic and gravitational versions of the\none-dimensional systems of parallel sheets with periodic boundary conditions.\nExact time evolution of tangent-space vectors are derived and are utilized\ntoward computing Lypaunov characteristic exponents using an event-driven\nalgorithm. The results indicate that the energy dependence of the largest\nLyapunov exponent emulates that of Kolmogorov-entropy density for each system\nat different degrees of freedom. Our approach forms an effective and\napproximation-free tool toward studying the dynamical properties exhibited by\nthe Coulombic and gravitational systems and finds applications in investigating\nindications of thermodynamic transitions in large versions of the spatially\nperiodic systems.\n", "  We study an orbitally degenerate Kondo effect in a triangular triple quantum\ndot (TTQD), where the three dots are connected vertically with a single\nmetallic lead through electron tunneling. Both spin and orbital degrees of\nfreedom play an important role in the SU(4) Kondo effect. This is demonstrated\nby an equilateral TTQD Kondo system at half-filling, by Wilson's numerical\nrenormalization group method. We show how an emergent electric polarization of\nthe TTQD is associated with a crossover from SU(4) to SU(2) symmetry in the\nlow-temperature state. A marked sign reversal of the electric polarization is\ngenerated by the fine-tuning of Kondo coupling with degenerate orbitals, which\ncan be utilized to reveal orbital dynamics in the SU(4) Kondo effect.\n", "  There is a calculation of the differential cross sections of proton\nscattering on 13C and 15C nuclei at energy of 1 GeV with the shell model wave\nfunctions in the framework of the Glauber theory in the study. The single,\ndouble and triple collisions have been taken into account in the multiple\nscattering operator. The role of each term of the series and their interference\nin the differential cross section have been estimated. It is shown that for a\ndescription of the cross sections in a wide angle/momentum transfer range it is\nnecessary to consider not only the first, but the higher scattering orders.\n", "  A test of a cornerstone of general relativity, the gravitational redshift\neffect, is currently being conducted with the RadioAstron spacecraft, which is\non a highly eccentric orbit around Earth. Using ground radio telescopes to\nrecord the spacecraft signal, synchronized to its ultra-stable on-board\nH-maser, we can probe the varying flow of time on board with unprecedented\naccuracy. The observations performed so far, currently being analyzed, have\nalready allowed us to measure the effect with a relative accuracy of\n$4\\times10^{-4}$. We expect to reach $2.5\\times10^{-5}$ with additional\nobservations in 2016, an improvement of almost a magnitude over the 40-year old\nresult of the GP-A mission.\n", "  The nonlocal properties of the W states are investigated under particle loss.\nBy removing all but two particles from an $N$-qubit W state, the resulting\ntwo-qubit state is still entangled. Hence, the W state has high persistency of\nentanglement. We ask an analogous question regarding the persistency of\nnonlocality introduced in [Phys. Rev. A 86, 042113]. Namely, we inquire what is\nthe minimal number of particles that must be removed from the W state so that\nthe resulting state becomes local. We bound this value in function of $N$\nqubits by considering Bell nonlocality tests with two alternative settings per\nsite. In particular, we find that this value is between $2N/5$ and $N/2$ for\nlarge $N$. We also develop a framework to establish bounds for more than two\nsettings per site.\n", "  We study the photoproduction of isolated prompt photons associated with\nhadron jets in the framework of the parton Reggeization approach. The main\nimprovements with respect to previous studies in the k_T-factorization\nframework include the application of the Reggeized-quark formalism, the\ngeneration of exactly gauge-invariant amplitudes with off-shell initial-state\nquarks, and the exact treatment of the gamma+R -> gamma+g box contribution with\noff-shell initial-state gluons. In this proceedings, the new data set,\npublished recently by ZEUS collaboration is analyzed, were the distributions in\nphoton and jet rapidity, transverse energy, azimuthal angle between photon and\njet and proton momentum fraction are presented for different values of measured\nphoton momentum fraction x_gamma <0.7, 0.8 and x_gamma>0.8$. The good agreement\nof measured distributions with our predictions is observed for the\ndirect-dominating part of the data set. The comparison with the previous\ncalculations in k_T-factorization, role of nonfactorizable higher-order and\nhadronization corrections is discussed.\n", "  The structure of model gluten protein gels prepared in ethanol/water is\ninvestigated by small angle X-ray (SAXS) and neutrons (SANS) scattering. We\nshow that gluten gels display radically different SAXS and SANS profiles when\nthe solvent is (at least partially) deuterated. The detailed analysis of the\nSANS signal as a function of the solvent deuteration demonstrates\nheterogeneities of sample deuteration at different length scales. The\nprogressive exchange between the protons (H) of the proteins and the deuteriums\n(D) of the solvent is inhomogeneous and 60 nm large zones that are enriched in\nH are evidenced. In addition, at low protein concentration, in the sol state,\nsolvent deuteration induces a liquid/liquid phase separation. Complementary\nbiochemical and structure analyses show that the denser protein phase is more\nprotonated and specifically enriched in glutenin, the polymeric fraction of\ngluten proteins. These findings suggest that the presence of H-rich zones in\ngluten gels would arise from the preferential interaction of glutenin polymers\nthrough a tight network of non-exchangeable intermolecular hydrogen bonds.\n", "  Arina et al. have proposed the Dirac fermionic dark matter with\npseudoscalar-mediated interactions to explain the Galactic Center excess,\ncorrect relic density and DAMA signal. They have assumed that contact\ninteractions remain roughly valid in calculating scattering rates at the direct\ndetection even when the mediator mass is the same order as the typical momentum\ntransfer. We show that such a replacement is not suitable. Adopting the full\nform of interactions, we show that the gamma-ray excess allowed parameters are\ncompletely outside of the DAMA iodine 3$\\sigma$ region, even for\nheavy-flavor-universal couplings, for which $m_{DM} \\sim 40$ GeV in the\ngamma-ray excess fit. As for Higgs-like couplings, the two regions overlap for\n$m_a\\lesssim$ 15 MeV, where long-range interactions, instead of contact\ninteractions, occur at the DAMA.\n", "  Exploiting the information about members of a Social Network (SN) represents\none of the most attractive and dwelling subjects for both academic and applied\nscientists. The community of Complexity Science and especially those\nresearchers working on multiplex social systems are devoting increasing efforts\nto outline general laws, models, and theories, to the purpose of predicting\nemergent phenomena in SN's (e.g. success of a product). On the other side the\nsemantic web community aims at engineering a new generation of advanced\nservices tailored to specific people needs. This implies defining constructs,\nmodels and methods for handling the semantic layer of SNs. We combined models\nand techniques from both the former fields to provide a hybrid approach to\nunderstand a basic (yet complex) phenomenon: the propagation of individual\ninterests along the social networks. Since information may move along different\nsocial networks, one should take into account a multiplex structure. Therefore\nwe introduced the notion of \"Semantic Multiplex\". In this paper we analyse two\ndifferent semantic social networks represented by authors publishing in the\nComputer Science and those in the American Physical Society Journals. The\ncomparison allows to outline common and specific features\n", "  As a bubble bursts at a liquid-air interface, a tiny liquid jet rises and can\nrelease the so-called \\textit{jet drops}. In this paper, the size of the top\njet drop produced by a bubble bursting is investigated experimentally. We\ndetermine, and discuss, the first scaling law enabling the determination of the\ntop jet drop size as a function of the corresponding mother bubble radius and\nthe liquid properties (viscosity, surface tension, density), along with its\nregime of existence. Furthermore, in the aim of decoupling experimentally the\neffects of bubble collapse and jet dynamics on the drop detachment, we propose\na new scaling providing the top drop size only as a function of the jet\nvelocity and liquid parameters. In particular, this allows us to untangle the\nintricate roles of viscosity, gravity and surface tension in the\n\\textit{end-pinching} of the bubble bursting jet.\n", "  The magneto-optical activity, namely the polarization conversion capabilities\nof high-index, non-absorbing, core-shell dielectric nanospheres is\ntheoretically analyzed. We show that, in analogy with their plasmonic\ncounterparts, the polarization conversion in resonant dielectric particles is\nlinked to the amount of electromagnetic field probing the magneto-optical\nmaterial in the system. However, in strong contrast with plasmon nanoparticles,\ndue to the peculiar distribution of the internal fields in resonant dielectric\nspheres, the magneto-optical response is fully governed by the magnetic\n(dipolar and quadrupolar) resonances with little effect of the electric ones.\n", "  We analyze plasma dispersion and scattering of fast radio bursts (FRBs) to\nidentify the dominant locations of free electrons along their lines of sight\nand thus constrain the distances of the burst sources themselves. We establish\nthe average $\\tau$-DM relation for Galactic pulsars and use it as a benchmark\nfor discussing FRB scattering. Though scattering times $\\tau$ for FRBs are\nlarge in the majority of the 17 events we analyze, they are systematically\nsmaller than those of Galactic pulsars that have similar dispersion measures\n(DMs). The lack of any correlation between $\\tau$ and DM for FRBs suggests that\nthe intergalactic medium (IGM) cannot account for both $\\tau$ and DM. We\ntherefore consider mixed models involving the IGM and host galaxies. If the IGM\ncontributes significantly to DM while host galaxies dominate $\\tau$, the\nscattering deficit with respect to the mean Galactic trend can be explained\nwith a $\\tau$-DM relation in the host that matches that for the Milky Way.\nHowever, it is possible that hosts dominate both $\\tau$ and DM, in which case\nthe observed scattering deficits require free electrons in the host to be less\nturbulent than in the Galaxy, such as if they are in hot rather than warm\nionized regions. Our results imply that distances or redshifts of FRB sources\ncan be significantly overestimated if they are based on the assumption that the\nextragalactic portion of DM is dominated by the IGM.\n", "  $\\bullet$ Background : In Heart rate variability analysis, the rate-rate time\nseries suffer often from aperiodic non-stationarity, presence of ectopic beats\netc. It would be hard to extract helpful information from the original signals.\n10 $\\bullet$ Problem : Trend removal methods are commonly practiced to reduce\nthe influence of the low frequency and aperiodic non-stationary in RR data.\nThis can unfortunately affect the signal and make the analysis on detrended\ndata less appropriate. $\\bullet$ Objective : Investigate the detrending effect\n(linear \\& nonlinear) in temporal / nonliear analysis of heart rate variability\nof long-term RR data (in normal sinus rhythm, atrial fibrillation, 15\ncongestive heart failure and ventricular premature arrhythmia conditions).\n$\\bullet$ Methods : Temporal method : standard measure SDNN; Nonlinear methods\n: multi-scale Fractal Dimension (FD), Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) \\&\nSample Entropy (Sam-pEn) analysis. $\\bullet$ Results : The linear detrending\naffects little the global characteristics of the RR data, either 20 in temporal\nanalysis or in nonlinear complexity analysis. After linear detrending, the\nSDNNs are just slightly shifted and all distributions are well preserved. The\ncross-scale complexity remained almost the same as the ones for original RR\ndata or correlated. Nonlinear detrending changed not only the SDNNs\ndistribution, but also the order among different types of RR data. After this\nprocessing, the SDNN became indistinguishable be-25 tween SDNN for normal sinus\nrhythm and ventricular premature beats. Different RR data has different\ncomplexity signature. Nonlinear detrending made the all RR data to be similar ,\nin terms of complexity. It is thus impossible to distinguish them. The FD\nshowed that nonlinearly detrended RR data has a dimension close to 2, the\nexponent from DFA is close to zero and SampEn is larger than 1.5 -- these\ncomplexity values are very close to those for 30 random signal. $\\bullet$\nConclusions : Pre-processing by linear detrending can be performed on RR data,\nwhich has little influence on the corresponding analysis. Nonlinear detrending\ncould be harmful and it is not advisable to use this type of pre-processing.\nExceptions do exist, but only combined with other appropriate techniques to\navoid complete change of the signal's intrinsic dynamics. 35 Keywords $\\bullet$\nheart rate variability $\\bullet$ linear / nonlinear detrending $\\bullet$\ncomplexity analysis $\\bullet$ mul-tiscale analysis $\\bullet$ detrended\nfluctuation analysis $\\bullet$ fractal dimension $\\bullet$ sample entropy;\n", "  We investigate the occurrence of shear banding in nematogenic fluids under\nplanar Couette flow, based on mesoscopic dynamical equations for the\norientational order parameter and the shear stress. We focus on parameter\nvalues where the sheared homogeneous system exhibits regular oscillatory\norientational dynamics, whereas the equilibrium system is either isotropic\n(albeit close to the isotropic--nematic transition) or deep in its nematic\nphase. The numerical calculations are restricted to spatial variations in shear\ngradient direction. We find several new types of shear banded states\ncharacterized by regions with regular oscillatory orientational dynamics. In\nall cases shear banding is accompanied by a non--monotonicity of the flow curve\nof the homogeneous system; however, only in the case of the initially isotropic\nsystem this curve has the typical $S$--like shape. We also analyze the\ninfluence of different orientational boundary conditions and of the spatial\ncorrelation length.\n", "  Universality in materials deformation is of intense interest: universal\nscaling relations if exist would bridge the gap from microscopic deformation to\nmacroscopic response in a single material-independent fashion. While recent\nagreement of the force statistics of deformed nanopillars, bulk metallic\nglasses, and granular materials with mean-field predictions supports the idea\nof universal scaling relations, here for the first time we demonstrate that the\nuniversality extends beyond the statistics, and applies to the slip dynamics as\nwell. By rigorous comparison of two very different systems, bulk metallic\nglasses and granular materials in terms of both the statistics and dynamics of\nforce fluctuations, we clearly establish a material-independent universal\nregime of deformation. We experimentally verify the predicted universal scaling\nfunction for the time evolution of individual avalanches, and show that both\nthe slip statistics and dynamics are universal, i.e. independent of the scale\nand details of the material structure and interactions. These results are\nimportant for transferring experimental results across scales and material\nstructures in a single theory of deformation.\n", "  The discovery of two-dimensional superconductivity in Bi2Te3/FeTe\nheterostructure provides a new platform for the search of Majorana fermions in\ncondensed matter systems. Since Majorana fermions are expected to reside at the\ncore of the vortices, a close examination of the vortex dynamics in\nsuperconducting interface is of paramount importance. Here, we report the\nrobustness of the interfacial superconductivity and 2D vortex dynamics in four\nas-grown and aged Bi2Te3/FeTe heterostructure with different Bi2Te3 epilayer\nthickness (3, 5, 7, 14 nm). After two years' air exposure, superconductivity\nremains robust even when the thickness of Bi2Te3 epilayer is down to 3 nm.\nMeanwhile, a new feature at ~13 K is induced in the aged samples, and the high\nfield studies reveal its relevance to superconductivity. The resistance of all\nas-grown and aged heterostructures, just below the superconducting transition\ntemperature follows the Arrhenius relation, indicating the thermally activated\nflux flow behavior at the interface of Bi2Te3 and FeTe. Moreover, the\nactivation energy exhibits a logarithmic dependence on the magnetic field,\nproviding a compelling evidence for the 2D vortex dynamics in this novel\nsystem. The weak disorder associated with aging-induced Te vacancies is\npossibly responsible for these observed phenomena.\n", "  On the road towards next generation high efficiency solar cells, the ternary\nIndium Gallium Nitride (InGaN) alloy is a good passenger since it allows to\ncover the whole solar spectrum through the change in its Indium composition.\nThe choice of the main structure of the InGaN solar cell is however crucial.\nObtaining a high efficiency requires to improve the light absorption and the\nphotogenerated carriers collection that depend on the layers parameters,\nincluding the Indium composition, p-and n-doping, device geometry.. .\nUnfortunately, one of the main drawbacks of InGaN is linked to its p-type\ndoping, which is very difficult to realize since it involves complex\ntechnological processes that are difficult to master and that highly impact the\nlayer quality. In this paper, the InGaN p-n junction (PN) and p-in junction\n(PIN) based solar cells are numerically studied using the most realistic\nmodels, and optimized through mathematically rigorous multivariate optimization\napproaches. This analysis evidences optimal efficiencies of 17.8% and 19.0% for\nthe PN and PIN structures. It also leads to propose, analyze and optimize\nplayer free InGaN Schottky-Based Solar Cells (SBSC): the Schottky structure and\na new MIN structure for which the optimal efficiencies are shown to be a little\nhigher than for the conventional structures: respectively 18.2% and 19.8%. The\ntolerance that is allowed on each parameter for each of the proposed cells has\nbeen studied. The new MIN structure is shown to exhibit the widest tolerances\non the layers thicknesses and dopings. In addition to its being player free,\nthis is another advantage of the MIN structure since it implies its better\nreliability. Therefore, these new InGaN SBSC are shown to be alternatives to\nthe conventional structures that allow removing the p-type doping of InGaN\nwhile giving photovoltaic (PV) performances at least comparable to the standard\nmultilayers PN or PIN structures.\n", "  We report the nanodiamond-derived onion-like carbon successfully applied as\nan electrocatalyst for [VO]2+/[VO2]+ redox flow battery, as drop-coated (in the\nas-synthesized state) on glassy carbon or carbon felt electrodes. We show that\nits reversibility and catalytic activity in its as-synthesized state was\ncomparable to some of the best data in the literature which employed surface\nmodifications. We clarified the origin of such excellent performances by\nphysical/electrochemical analyses.\n", "  In this article we establish linear inviscid damping with optimal decay rates\naround 2D Taylor-Couette flow and similar monotone flows in an annular domain\n$B_{r_{2}}(0) \\setminus B_{r_{1}}(0) \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{2}$. Following recent\nresults by Wei, Zhang and Zhao, we establish stability in weighted norms, which\nallow for a singularity formation at the boundary, and additional provide a\ndescription of the blow-up behavior.\n", "  Wing-body junction flows occur when a boundary layer encounters an airfoil\nmounted on the surface. The corner flow near the trailing edge is challenging\nfor the linear eddy viscosity Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models,\ndue to the interaction of two perpendicular boundary layers which leads to\nhighly anisotropic Reynolds stress at the near wall region. Recently, Xiao et\nal. proposed a physics-informed Bayesian framework to quantify and reduce the\nmodel-form uncertainties in RANS simulations by utilizing sparse observation\ndata. In this work, we extend this framework to incorporate the use of wall\nfunction in RANS simulations, and apply the extended framework to the RANS\nsimulation of wing-body junction flow. Standard RANS simulations are performed\non a 3:2 elliptic nose and NACA0020 tail cylinder joined at their maximum\nthickness location. Current results show that both the posterior mean velocity\nand the Reynolds stress anisotropy show better agreement with the experimental\ndata at the corner region near the trailing edge. On the other hand, the prior\nvelocity profiles at the leading edge indicate the restriction of uncertainty\nspace and the performance of the framework at this region is less effective. By\nperturbing the orientation of Reynolds stress, the uncertainty range of prior\nvelocity profiles at the leading edge covers the experimental data. It\nindicates that the uncertainty of RANS predicted velocity field is more related\nto the uncertainty in the orientation of Reynolds stress at the region with\nrapid change of mean strain rate. The present work not only demonstrates the\ncapability of Bayesian framework in improving the RANS simulation of wing-body\njunction flow, but also reveals the major source of model-form uncertainty for\nthis flow, which can be useful in assisting RANS modeling.\n", "  Cold dark matter (CDM) is a well established paradigm to describe\ncosmological structure formation, and works extraordinarily well on large,\nlinear, scales. Progressing further in dark matter physics requires being able\nto understand structure formation in the non-linear regime, both for CDM and\nits alternatives. This short note describes a calculation, and accompanying\ncode, WarmAndFuzzy, incorporating the popular models of warm and fuzzy dark\nmatter (WDM and FDM) into the standard halo model to compute the non-linear\nmatter power spectrum. The FDM halo model power spectrum has not been computed\nbefore. The FDM implementation models ultralight axions and other scalar fields\nwith $m_a\\approx 10^{-22}\\text{ eV}$. The WDM implementation models thermal WDM\nwith mass $m_X\\approx 1\\text{ keV}$. The halo model shows that differences\nbetween WDM, FDM, and CDM survive at low redshifts in the quasi-linear and\nfully non-linear regimes. The code uses analytic transfer functions for the\nlinear power spectrum, modified collapse barriers in the halo mass function,\nand a modified concentration-mass relationship for the halo density profiles.\nModified halo density profiles (for example, cores) are not included, but are\nunder development. Cores are expected to have very minor effects on the power\nspectrum on observable scales. Applications of this code to the Lyman-$\\alpha$\nforest flux power spectrum and the cosmic microwave background lensing power\nspectrum will be discussed in companion papers. \\textsc{WarmAndFuzzy} is\navailable online at \\url{https://github.com/DoddyPhysics/HMcode}, where\ncollaboration in development is welcomed.\n", "  Long tails in the velocity distribution are observed in plasmas and\ngravitational systems. Some experiments and observations in\nfar-from-equilibrium conditions show that these tails behave as 1/v^(5/2). We\nshow here that such heavy tails are due to a universal mechanism related to the\nfluctuations of the total force field. Owing to the divergence in 1/r^2 of the\nbinary interaction force, these fluctuations can be very large and their\nprobability density exhibits a similar long tail. They induce large velocity\nfluctuations leading to the 1/v^(5/2) tail. We extract the mechanism causing\nthese properties from the BBGKY hierarchy representation of Statistical\nMechanics. This leads to a modification of the Vlasov equation by an additional\nterm. The novel term involves a fractional power 3/4 of the Laplacian in\nvelocity space and a fractional iterated time integral. Solving the new kinetic\nequation for a uniform system, we retrieve the observed 1/v^(5/2) tail for the\nvelocity distribution. These results are confirmed by molecular dynamics\nsimulations.\n", "  Ge2Sb2Te5 and related phase change materials are highly unusual in that they\ncan be readily transformed between amorphous and crystalline states using very\nfast melt, quench, anneal cycles, although the resulting states are extremely\nlong lived at ambient temperature. These states have remarkably different\nphysical properties including very different optical constants in the visible\nin strong contrast to common glass formers such as silicates or phosphates.\nThis behavior has been described in terms of resonant bonding, but puzzles\nremain, particularly regarding different physical properties of crystalline and\namorphous phases. Here we show that there is a strong competition between ionic\nand covalent bonding in cubic phase providing a link between the chemical basis\nof phase change memory property and origins of giant responses of piezoelectric\nmaterials (PbTiO3, BiFeO3). This has important consequences for dynamical\nbehavior in particular leading to a simultaneous hardening of acoustic modes\nand softening of high frequency optic modes in crystalline phase relative to\namorphous. This different bonding in amorphous and crystalline phases provides\na direct explanation for different physical properties and understanding of the\ncombination of long time stability and rapid switching and may be useful in\nfinding new phase change compositions with superior properties.\n", "  The complex fluidic nature of blood, though necessary to serve different\nphysiological purposes, gives rise to daunting challenges in developing unified\nconceptual paradigm describing the underlying physics of blood at pinch, which\nmay otherwise be essential for understanding various bio-technological\nprocesses demanding precise and efficient handling of blood samples.\nIntuitively, a blood-drop may be formed simply by dripping. However, the\npinch-off dynamics leading to blood-drop-breakup is elusively more complex than\nwhat may be portrayed by any unique model depicting the underlying\nmorpho-dynamics, as our study reveals. With blood samples, here we observe two\ndistinctive modes of the breakup process. One mode corresponds to incessant\ncollapsing of a liquid-neck, while in other mode formation and thinning of an\nextended long thread leads to the breakup and drop formation. We further show\nthat these modes are respectively described by power law and exponential law\nbased universal scaling dynamics, depicting the temporal evolution of the neck\nthickness of the blood filament. Our results are likely to bear far-reaching\nconsequences in diverse applications, ranging from forensic sciences to droplet\nbased microfluidic technology.\n", "  In this study, we proposed and demonstrated a self-rectifying property of\nsilicon nitride (Si3N4)-based resistive random access memory device by\nemploying p-type silicon (p-Si) as bottom electrode. The RRAM devices consisted\nof Al/Si3N4/p-Si are fabricated by a low presure chemical vapor deposition and\nexhibited an intrinsic diode property with non-linear current-voltage (I-V)\nbehavior. In addition, compared to conventional metal/insulator/metal (MIM)\nstructure of Al/Si3N4/Ti RRAM cells, operating current in whole bias regions\nfor proposed metal/insulator/semiconductor (MIS) cells has been dramatically\nlowered because introduced p-Si bottom electrode efficiently suppresses the\ncurrent in both low and high resistive states. As a result, the results mean\nthat by employing p-Si as bottom electrode the Si3N4-based RRAM cells can be\napplied to selector-free RRAM cells.\n", "  The resistive switching phenomena of HfO2 films grown by metalorganic\nchemical vapor deposition was studied for the application of ReRAM devices. In\nthe fabricated Pt/HfO2/TiN memory cells, the bipolar resistive switching\ncharacteristics were observed, and the set and reset states were measured to be\nas low as 7 uA and 4 uA, respectively, at VREAD = 1 V. Regarding the resistive\nswitching performance, the stable RS performance was observed under 40\nrepetitive dc cycling test with the small variations of set/reset voltages and\ncurrents, and good retention characteristics over 105 s in both LRS and HRS.\nThese results show the possibility of MOCVD grown HfO2 films as a promising\nresistive switching materials for ReRAM applications.\n", "  We study cosmological dynamics of an extended gravitational theory that\ngravity is coupled non-minimally with derivatives of a dark energy component\nand there is also a phenomenological interaction between the dark energy and\ndark matter. Depending on the direction of energy flow between the dark\nsectors, the phenomenological interaction gets two different signs. We show\nthat this feature affects the existence of attractor solution, the rate of\ngrowth of perturbations and stability of the solutions. By considering an\nexponential potential as a self-interaction potential of the scalar field, we\nobtain accelerated scaling solutions that are attractors and have the potential\nto alleviate the coincidence problem. While in the absence of the nonminimal\nderivative coupling there is no attractor solution for phantom field when\nenergy transfers from dark matter to dark energy, we show an attractor solution\nexists if one considers an explicit nonminimal derivative coupling for phantom\nfield in this case of energy transfer. We treat the cosmological perturbations\nin this setup with details to show that with phenomenological interaction,\nperturbations can grow faster than the minimal case.\\\\ {\\bf Keywords}:\nDynamical Systems; Dark Energy; Dark Matter; Non-Minimal Derivative Coupling,\nStatefinder Diagnostic, Cosmological Perturbations.\n", "  The role of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and Nitrogen containing\nPAH (PANH) as intermediates of aerosol production in the atmosphere of Titan\nhas been a subject of controversy for a long time. An analysis of the\natmospheric emission band observed by the Visible and Infrared Mapping\nSpectrometer (VIMS) at 3.28 micrometer suggests the presence of neutral\npolycyclic aromatic species in the upper atmosphere of Titan. These molecules\nare seen as the counter part of negative and positive aromatics ions suspected\nby the Plasma Spectrometer onboard the Cassini spacecraft, but the low\nresolution of the instrument hinders any molecular speciation.\n  In this work we investigate the specific aromatic content of Titan's\natmospheric aerosols through laboratory simulations. We report here the\nselective detection of aromatic compounds in tholins, Titan's aerosol\nanalogues, produced with a capacitively coupled plasma in a N2:CH4 95:5 gas\nmixture. For this purpose, Two-Step Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-Flight\nMass Spectrometry (L2DI-TOF-MS) technique is used to analyze the so produced\nanalogues. This analytical technique is based on the ionization of molecules by\nResonance Enhanced Multi-Photon Ionization (REMPI) using a {\\lambda}=248 nm\nwavelength laser which is selective for aromatic species. This allows for the\nselective identification of compounds having at least one aromatic ring. Our\nexperiments show that tholins contain a trace amount of small PAHs with one to\nthree aromatic rings. Nitrogen containing PAHs (PANHs) are also detected as\nconstituents of tholins. Molecules relevant to astrobiology are detected as is\nthe case of the substituted DNA base adenine.\n", "  We study the fluctuation-electromagnetic interaction between a small rotating\nparticle with an arbitrary direction of angular velocity vector and evanescent\nfield of the heated surface, and obtain the general expressions for the force\nof attraction, rate of heating and components of torque. The particle rotation\ndynamics is analyzed. It is shown that during most time of motion the particle\nslows down provided that a quasiequilibrium thermal state has been reached,\nwhile at any initial direction of the angular velocity vector it tends to\norient perpendicular to the surface with spin direction depending on the\ninitial conditions. Moreover, the angular velocity vector executes precessional\nmotion around surface normal.\n", "  We demonstrate plasmon-enhanced photoconduction in Au bowtie nanojunctions\ncontaining nanogaps overlaid with an amorphous Ge film. The role of plasmons in\nthe production of nanogap photocurrent is verified by studying the unusual\npolarization dependence of the photoresponse. With increasing Ge thickness, the\nnanogap polarization of the photoresponse rotates 90 degrees, indicating a\nchange in the dominant relevant plasmon mode, from the resonant transverse\nplasmon at low thicknesses to the nonresonant \"lightning rod\" mode at higher\nthicknesses. To understand the plasmon response in the presence of the Ge\noverlayer and whether the Ge degrades the Au plasmonic properties, we\ninvestigate the photothermal response (from the temperature-dependent Au\nresistivity) in no-gap nanowire structures, as a function of Ge film thickness\nand nanowire geometry. The film thickness and geometry dependence are modeled\nusing a cross-sectional, finite element simulation. The no-gap structures and\nthe modeling confirm that the striking change in nanogap polarization response\nresults from redshifting of the resonant transverse mode, rather than\ndegradation in the Au/Ge properties. We note remaining challenges in\ndetermining the precise mechanism of photocurrent production in the nanogap\nstructures.\n", "  We criticize the originality or correctness of some of the ideas and results\nrecently reported by Ng et al. in arXiv:1511.08546.\n", "  Summary of the experimental results presented at the 51st edition of the\nMoriond Electroweak and Unified Theories conference held in March 2016 at La\nThuile, Italy.\n", "  We compare the light extinction spectra of elongated gold nanoparticles with\ndifferent shapes (cylinder, spherocylinder and ellipsoid) and sizes of 10 to\n100~nm. We argue that the equivalence of the various moments of mass\ndistribution is the natural comparison criterion -rather than the\nlength-to-diameter (aspect) ratio generally used in the literature- and that it\nleads to better spectral correspondence between the various shapes.\n", "  Recently, the LHC has found several anomalies in exclusive semileptonic b -->\ns l^+ l^- decays. In this proceeding, we summarize the most important results\nof our global analysis of the relevant decay modes. After a discussion of the\nhadronic uncertainties entering the theoretical predictions, we present an\ninterpretation of the data in terms of generic new physics scenarios. To this\nend, we have performed model-independent fits of the corresponding Wilson\ncoefficients to the data and have found that in certain scenarios the best fit\npoint is prefererred over the Standard Model by a global significance of more\nthan 4{\\sigma}. Based on the results, the discrimination between high-scale new\nphysics and low-energy QCD effects as well as the possibility of lepton-flavour\nuniversality violation are discussed.\n", "  Birnessite compounds are stable across a wide range of compositions that\nproduces a remarkable diversity in their physical, electrochemical and\nfunctional properties. These are hydrated analogues of the magnetically\nfrustrated, mixed-valent manganese oxide structures, with general formula,\nNaxMnO2. Here we demonstrate that the direct hydration of layered rock-salt\ntype a-NaMnO2, with the geometrically frustrated triangular lattice topology,\nyields the birnessite type oxide, Na0.36MnO2 0.2H2O, transforming its magnetic\nproperties. This compound has a much-expanded interlayer spacing compared to\nits parent a-NaMnO2 compound. We show that while the parent a-NaMnO2 possesses\na Neel temperature of 45 K as a result of broken symmetry in the Mn3+\nsub-lattice, the hydrated derivative undergoes collective spin-freezing at 29 K\nwithin the Mn3+/Mn4+ sub-lattice. Scaling-law analysis of the frequency\ndispersion of the AC susceptibility, as well as the temperature-dependent,\nlow-field DC magnetization confirm a cooperative spin-glass state of strongly\ninteracting spins. This is supported by complementary spectroscopic analysis\n(HAADF-STEM, EDS, EELS) as well as by a structural investigation\n(high-resolution TEM, X-ray and neutron powder diffraction) that yield insights\ninto the chemical and atomic structure modifications. We conclude that the\nspin-glass state in birnessite is driven by the spin-frustration imposed by the\nunderlying triangular lattice topology that is further enhanced by the in-plane\nbond-disorder generated by the mixed-valent character of manganese in the\nlayers.\n", "  Predictability of flow is examined in a barotropic vorticity model that\nadmits low frequency regime transitions between zonal and dipolar states. Such\ntransitions in the model were first studied by Bouchet and Simonnet (2009) and\nare reminiscent of regime change phenomena in the weather and climate systems\nwherein extreme and abrupt qualitative changes occur, seemingly randomly, after\nlong periods of apparent stability. Mechanisms underlying regime transitions in\nthe model are not well understood yet. From the point of view of atmospheric\nand oceanic dynamics, a novel aspect of the model is the lack of any source of\nbackground gradient of potential-vorticity such as topography or planetary\ngradient of rotation rate (e.g., as in Charney & DeVore '79).\n  We consider perturbations that are embedded onto the system's chaotic\nattractor under the full nonlinear dynamics as bred vectors---nonlinear\ngeneralizations of the leading (backward) Lyapunov vector. We find that\nensemble predictions that use bred vector perturbations are more robust in\nterms of error-spread relationship than those that use Lyapunov vector\nperturbations. In particular, when bred vector perturbations are used in\nconjunction with a simple data assimilation scheme (nudging to truth), we find\nthat at least some of the evolved perturbations align to identify\nlow-dimensional subspaces associated with regions of large forecast error in\nthe control (unperturbed, data-assimilating) run; this happens less often in\nensemble predictions that use Lyapunov vector perturbations. Nevertheless, in\nthe inertial regime we consider, we find that (a) the system is more\npredictable when it is in the zonal regime, and that (b) the horizon of\npredictability is far too short compared to characteristic time scales\nassociated with processes that lead to regime transitions, thus precluding the\npossibility of predicting such transitions.\n", "  For diatomic molecules and chains bound anharmonically by interactions such a\nthe Lennard Jones and Morse potentials, we obtain analytical expressions for\nthermodynamic observables including the mean bond length, thermally averaged\ninternal energy, and the coefficient of thermal expansion. These results are\nvalid across the shift from condensed to gas-like phases, a dissociation\ntransition marked by a crossover with no singularities in thermodynamic\nvariables for finite pressures, though singular behavior appears in the low\npressure limit. In the regime where the thermal energy $k_{\\mathrm{B}} T$ is\nmuch smaller than the dissociation energy $D$, the mean interatomic separation\nscales as $\\langle l \\rangle = R_{e} + {\\mathcal B} (P R_{e}/k_{\\mathrm{B}}\nT)^{-2} e^{-D/k_{\\mathrm{B}} T} \\left( D/k_{\\mathrm{B}} T \\right )^{1/2}$ for\nboth the Morse and Lennard Jones potentials where $p$ is a pressure term,\n$R_{e}$ is the $T = 0$ bond length, and ${\\mathcal B}$ is a constant specific\nto the potential.\n", "  A minimal Lagragian two-phase model to study turbulent bedload transport\nfocusing on the granular phase is presented, and validated with experiments.\nThe model intends to describe bedload transport of massive particles in fully\nrough flows at relatively low Shields numbers, for which no suspension occurs.\nA discrete element method for the granular phase is coupled with a one\ndimensional volume-averaged two-phase momentum equation for the fluid phase.\nThe coupling between the discrete granular phase and the continuous fluid phase\nis discussed, and a consistent averaging formulation adapted to bedload\ntransport is introduced. An original simple discrete random walk model is\nproposed to account for the fluid velocity fluctuations. The model is compared\nwith experiments considering both classical sediment transport rate as a\nfunction of the Shields number, and depth profiles of solid velocity, volume\nfraction, and transport rate density, from existing bedload transport\nexperiments in inclined flume. The results successfully reproduce the classical\n3/2 power law, and more importantly describe well the depth profiles of the\ngranular phase, showing that the model is able to reproduce the particle scale\nmechanisms. From a sensitivity analysis, it is shown that the fluctuation model\nallows to reproduce a realistic critical Shields number, and that the influence\nof the granular parameters on the macroscopic results are weak. Nevertheless,\nthe analysis of the corresponding depth profiles reveals an evolution of the\ndepth structure of the granular phase with varying restitution and friction\ncoefficients, which denotes the non-trivial underlying physical mechanisms.\n", "  The superconformal index of a typical Lagrangian 4d SCFT is given by a\nspecial function known as an elliptic hypergeometric integral (EHI). The\nhigh-temperature limit of the index corresponds to the hyperbolic limit of the\nEHI. The hyperbolic limit of certain special EHIs has been analyzed by Eric\nRains around 2006; extending Rains's techniques, we discover a surprisingly\nrich structure in the high-temperature limit of a (rather large) class of EHIs\nthat arise as the superconformal index of unitary Lagrangian 4d SCFTs with\nnon-chiral matter content. Our result has implications for $\\mathcal{N}=1$\ndualities, the AdS/CFT correspondence, and supersymmetric gauge dynamics on\n$R^3\\times S^1$.\n  We also investigate the high-temperature asymptotics of the large-N limit of\nthe superconformal index of a class of holographic 4d SCFTs (described by toric\nquiver gauge theories with SU(N) nodes). We show that from this study a rather\ngeneral solution to the problem of holographic Weyl anomaly in AdS$_5$/CFT$_4$\nat the subleading order (in the 1/N expansion) emerges.\n  Most of this dissertation is based on published works by Jim Liu, Phil\nSzepietowski, and the author. We include here a few previously unpublished\nresults as well, one of which is the high-temperature asymptotics of the\nsuperconformal index of puncture-less SU(2) class-$\\mathcal{S}$ theories.\n", "  The mesoscopic concept is a way to deal with complex materials with an\ninternal structure within continuum mechanics. It consists of extending the\ndomain of the balance equations by mesoscopic variables and of introducing a\nlocal distribution function of these variables as a statistical element. In our\ncase microcracks are modelled as penny shaped and completely characterized by\ntheir diameter and the unit normal to the crack surface. Two examples of crack\ndynamics are given as well as a possible definition of a damage parameter.\nOrientational order parameters (fabric-alignment tensors) are defined and\nbalance like dynamic equations for them are derived.\n", "  In the framework of the Joos-Weinberg 2(2S+1)- theory for massless particles,\nthe dynamical invariants have been derived from the Lagrangian density which is\nconsidered to be a 4- vector. A la Majorana interpretation of the 6- component\n\"spinors\", the field operators of S=1 particles, as the left- and\nright-circularly polarized radiation, leads us to the conserved quantities\nwhich are analogous to those obtained by Lipkin and Sudbery. The scalar\nLagrangian of the Joos-Weinberg theory is shown to be equivalent to the\nLagrangian of a free massless field, introduced by Hayashi. As a consequence of\na new \"gauge\" invariance this skew-symmetric field describes physical particles\nwith the longitudinal components only. The interaction of the spinor field with\nthe Weinberg's 2(2S+1)- component massless field is considered. New\ninterpretation of the Weinberg field function is proposed.
