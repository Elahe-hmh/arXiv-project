Our\nstudy reveals that the polymers (a) reduce the total fluid energy, enstrophy,\nand palinstrophy, (b) modify the fluid energy spectrum both in inverse- and\nforward-cascade regimes, (c) reduce small-scale intermittency, (d) suppress\nregions of large vorticity and strain rate, and (e) stretch in strain-dominated\nregions. We compare our results with earlier experimental studies; and we\npropose new experiments.\n", "  We used the Laguerre polynomials method for determination of the proton\nstructure function in the valon model. We have examined the applicability of\nthe valon model with respect to a very elegant method, where the structure of\nthe proton is determined by expanding valon distributions and valon structure\nfunctions on Laguerre polynomials. We compared our results with the\nexperimental data, GJR parameterization and DL model. Having checked, this\nmethod gives a good description for the proton structure function in valon\nmodel.\n", "  We present a set of formulae using the solution of the QCD\nDokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-parisi (DGLAP) evolution equation to the\nextract of the exponent $\\lambda_g$ gluon distribution and $\\lambda_S$\nstructure function from the Regge- like behavior at low $x$. The exponents are\nfound to be independent of $x$ and to increase linearly with ln$Q^{2}$ and\ncompared with the most data from H1 Collaboration. We also calculated the\nstructure function $F_{2}(x,Q^{2})$ and the gluon distribution $G(x,Q^{2})$ at\nlow $x$ assuming the Regge- like behavior of the gluon distribution function at\nthis limit and compared with NLO QCD fit to the H$1$ data, two Pomeron fit,\nmultipole Pomeron exchange fit and MRST (A.D.Martin, R.G.Roberts, W.J.Stirling\nand R.S.Thorne), DL(A.Donnachie and P.V.Landshoff), NLO-GRV(M.Gluk, E.Reya and\nA.Vogt) fit results, respectively.\n", "  The heat kernel is a particular type of graph diffusion that, like the\nmuch-used personalized PageRank diffusion, is useful in identifying a community\nnearby a starting seed node. We present the first deterministic, local\nalgorithm to compute this diffusion and use that algorithm to study the\ncommunities that it produces. Our algorithm is formally a relaxation method for\nsolving a linear system to estimate the matrix exponential in a degree-weighted\nnorm. We prove that this algorithm stays localized in a large graph and has a\nworst-case constant runtime that depends only on the parameters of the\ndiffusion, not the size of the graph. Our experiments on real-world networks\nindicate that the communities produced by this method have better conductance\nthan those produced by PageRank, although they take slightly longer to compute\non large graphs. On a real-world community identification task, the heat kernel\ncommunities perform better than those from the PageRank diffusion.\n", "  Current implementations of fluctuating lattice Boltzmann equations (FLBE)\ndescribe single component fluids. In this paper, a model based on the continuum\nkinetic Boltzmann equation for describing multicomponent fluids is extended to\nincorporate the effects of thermal fluctuations. The thus obtained fluctuating\nBoltzmann equation is first linearized to apply the theory of linear\nfluctuations, and expressions for the noise covariances are determined by\ninvoking the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) directly at the kinetic\nlevel. Crucial for our analysis is the projection of the Boltzmann equation\nonto the ortho-normal Hermite basis. By integrating in space and time the\nfluctuating Boltzmann equation with a discrete number of velocities, the FLBE\nis obtained for both ideal and non-ideal multicomponent fluids. Numerical\nsimulations are specialized to the case where mean-field interactions are\nintroduced on the lattice, indicating a proper thermalization of the system.\n", "  We explore the influence of density fluctuations on isotropic and anisotropic\nconfigurations, extending the concept of cracking for general relativistic\nfluid spheres. This concept, conceived to describe the behaviour of anisotropic\nmatter distributions just after its departure from equilibrium, could provide\nsome insight on potential instabilities and future evolution of relativistic\nfluids. We have refined the idea of cracking, considering local fluctuations\n--represented by any function of compact support defined in a closed interval--\nand their effect on the state variables and their gradients through\n\"barotropic\" equations of state, $P = P(\\rho)$ and $P_{\\perp}=\nP_{\\perp}(\\rho)$. Under this approach it is found that both isotropic and\nanisotropic models could exhibit cracking (or overturning), and that previously\ncrackable anisotropic models become uncrackable.\n", "  We are studying the $SU(3)$ gauge theory with 12 staggered fermions,\nsearching for the endpoint of the line of first-order phase transitions in the\nmass--beta plane. This endpoint plays an important role in our understanding of\nthe phase diagram of this model. Having found this endpoint with high\nstatistics on a small lattice using unimproved staggered fermions, we are\nworking to find it on larger lattices and with improved actions. For an action\nimproved with nHYP-smeared staggered fermions, we discuss the effect of slowly\nturning off the improvement on the broken shift symmetry phase.\n", "  We report on a quantitative measurement of the spatial coherence of electrons\nemitted from a sharp metal needle tip. We investigate the coherence in\nphotoemission using near-ultraviolet laser triggering with a photon energy of\n3.1 eV and compare it to DC-field emission. A carbon-nanotube is brought in\nclose proximity to the emitter tip to act as an electrostatic biprism. From the\nresulting electron matter wave interference fringes we deduce an upper limit of\nthe effective source radius both in laser-triggered and DC-field emission mode,\nwhich quantifies the spatial coherence of the emitted electron beam. We obtain\n$(0.80\\pm 0.05)\\,$nm in laser-triggered and $(0.55\\pm 0.02)\\,$nm in DC-field\nemission mode, revealing that the outstanding coherence properties of electron\nbeams from needle tip field emitters are largely maintained in laser-induced\nemission. In addition, the relative coherence width of 0.36 of the photoemitted\nelectron beam is the largest observed so far. The preservation of electronic\ncoherence during emission as well as ramifications for time-resolved electron\nimaging techniques are discussed.\n", "  We discuss some properties of the spectral triple\n$(A_F,H_F,D_F,J_F,\\gamma_F)$ describing the internal space in the\nnoncommutative geometry approach to the Standard Model, with\n$A_F=\\mathbb{C}\\oplus\\mathbb{H}\\oplus M_3(\\mathbb{C})$. We show that, if we\nwant $H_F$ to be a Morita equivalence bimodule between $A_F$ and the associated\nClifford algebra, two terms must be added to the Dirac operator; we then study\nits relation with the orientability condition for a spectral triple. We also\nillustrate what changes if one considers a spectral triple with a degenerate\nrepresentation, based on the complex algebra $B_F=\\mathbb{C}\\oplus\nM_2(\\mathbb{C})\\oplus M_3(\\mathbb{C})$.\n", "  Within the framework of free actions of compact quantum groups on unital\nC*-algebras, we propose two conjectures. The first one states that, if $H$ is\nthe C*-algebra of a compact quantum group coacting freely on a unital\nC*-algebra $A$, then there is no equivariant $*$-homomorphism from $A$ to the\njoin C*-algebra $A*H$. For $A$ being the C*-algebra of continuous functions on\na sphere with the antipodal coaction of the C*-algebra of funtions on\n$\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, we recover the celebrated Borsuk-Ulam theorem. The\nsecond conjecture states that there is no equivariant $*$-homomorphism from $H$\nto the join C*-algebra $A*H$. We show how to prove the conjecture in the\nspecial case $A=C(SU_q(2))=H$, which is tantamount to showing the\nnon-trivializability of Pflaum's quantum instanton fibration built from\n$SU_q(2)$.\n", "  We theoretically study electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in\nreflection spectra of V-type system at the gas-solid interface. In addition to\na narrow dip arising from the EIT effect, we find the other particular\nsaturation effect induced by pump field, which does not exist in $\\Lambda$ or\n$\\Xi$ -type system reflection spectra. The saturation effect only induces an\nintensity decrement in the reflection spectra, and there is no influence on the\nnarrow dip arising from the EIT effect. We detailedly calculate and analyze the\ndependence of V-type system reflection spectra on probe field intensity, pump\nfield intensity, coherent decay rate, and the initial population after the\ncollision between atoms and the interface.\n", "  Density functional calculations have performed to study the band structures\nof $Bi_2Te_3$-related binary ($Bi_2Te_3$, $Sb_2Te_3$, $Bi_2Se_3$, and\n$Sb_2Se_3$) and $Sb$/$Se$ doped ternary compounds [$(Bi_{1-x}Sb_x)_2Te_3$ and\n$Bi_2(Te_{1-y}Se_y)_3$]. It is found that the band gap can be increased by $Sb$\ndoping and it is monotonically increased by $Se$ doping. In ternary compounds,\nthe change of the conduction band structure is more significant, as compared to\nthe change of valence band. The band degeneracy of valence band maximum is\nmaintained to be 6 in binaries and ternaries. However, as going from $Bi_2Te_3$\nto $Sb_2Te_3$ ($Bi_2Se_3$), the degeneracy of conduction band minimum is\nreduced from 6 to 2(1). Based on the results of band structures, we suggest the\nsuitable stoichiometries of ternary compounds for high thermoelectric\nperformance.\n", "  We study the repulsive van der Waals interaction of cold rubidium $70S_{1/2}$\nRydberg atoms by analysis of time-delayed pair correlation functions. After\nexcitation, Rydberg atoms are allowed to accelerate under the influence of the\nvan der Waals force. Their positions are then measured using a single-atom\nimaging technique. From the average pair correlation function of the atom\npositions we obtain the initial atom-pair separation and the terminal velocity,\nwhich yield the van der Waals interaction coefficient $C_{6}$. The measured\n$C_{6}$ value agrees well with calculations. The experimental method has been\nvalidated by simulations. The data hint at anisotropy in the overall expansion,\ncaused by the shape of the excitation volume. Our measurement implies that the\ninteracting entities are individual Rydberg atoms, not groups of atoms that\ncoherently share a Rydberg excitation.\n", "  We establish the connection between a multichannel disordered model --the 1D\nDirac equation with $N\\times N$ matricial random mass-- and a random matrix\nmodel corresponding to a deformation of the Laguerre ensemble. This allows us\nto derive exact determinantal representations for the density of states and\nidentify its low energy ($\\varepsilon\\to0$) behaviour\n$\\rho(\\varepsilon)\\sim|\\varepsilon|^{\\alpha-1}$. The vanishing of the exponent\n$\\alpha$ for $N$ specific values of the averaged mass over disorder ratio\ncorresponds to $N$ phase transitions of topological nature characterised by the\nchange of a quantum number (Witten index) which is deduced straightforwardly in\nthe matrix model.\n", "  Luttinger's theorem is a fundamental result in the theory of interacting\nFermi systems: it states that the volume inside the Fermi surface is left\ninvariant by interactions, if the number of particles is held fixed. Although\nthis is traditionally justified using perturbation theory, it can be viewed as\narising from a momentum balance argument that examines the response of the\nground state to the insertion of a single flux quantum [M. Oshikawa, Phys. Rev.\nLett. 84, 3370 (2000)]. This reveals that the Fermi sea volume is a\ntopologically protected quantity. Extending this approach, I show that spinless\nor spin-rotation-preserving fermionic systems in non-symmorphic crystals\npossess generalized topological 'Luttinger invariants' that can be nonzero even\nin cases where the Fermi sea volume vanishes. A nonzero Luttinger invariant\nthen forces energy bands to touch, leading to semimetals whose gaplessness is\nthus rooted in topology; opening a gap without symmetry breaking automatically\ntriggers fractionalization. The existence of these invariants is linked to the\ninability of non-symmorphic crystals to host band insulating ground states\nexcept at special fillings. I exemplify the use of these new invariants by\nshowing that they distinguish various classes of two- and three-dimensional\nsemimetals.\n", "  Losses of optical signals scale exponentially with the distance. Quantum\nrepeaters are devices that tackle these losses in quantum communication by\nsplitting the total distance into shorter parts. Today two types of quantum\nrepeaters are subject of research in the field of quantum information: Those\nthat use two-way communication and those that only use one-way communication.\nHere we explain the details of the performance analysis for repeaters of the\nsecond type. Furthermore we compare the two different schemes. Finally we show\nhow the performance analysis generalizes to large-scale quantum networks.\n", "  The initial state of a system-bath composite is needed as the input for\nprediction from any quantum evolution equation to describe subsequent\nsystem-only reduced dynamics or the noise on the system from joint evolution of\nthe system and the bath. The conventional wisdom is to write down an\nuncorrelated state as if the system and the bath were prepared in the absence\nof each other; yet, such a factorized state cannot be the exact description in\nthe presence of system-bath interactions. Here, we show how to go beyond the\nsimplistic factorized-state prescription using ideas from quantum tomography:\nWe employ the maximum-entropy principle to deduce an initial system- bath state\nconsistent with the available information. For the generic case of weak\ninteractions, we obtain an explicit formula for the correction to the\nfactorized state. Such a state turns out to have little correlation between the\nsystem and the bath, which we can quantify using our formula. This has\nimplications, in particular, on the subject of subsequent\nnon-completely-positive dynamics of the system. Deviation from predictions\nbased on such an almost uncorrelated state is indicative of accidental control\nof hidden degrees of freedom in the bath.\n", "  In order to construct quantum $[[n,0,d]]$ codes for $(n,d)=(56,15)$,\n$(57,15)$, $(58,16)$, $(63,16)$, $(67,17)$, $(70,18)$, $(71,18)$, $(79,19)$,\n$(83,20)$, $(87,20)$, $(89,21)$, $(95,20)$, we construct self-dual additive\n$\\mathbb{F}_4$-codes of length $n$ and minimum weight $d$ from circulant\ngraphs. The quantum codes with these parameters are constructed for the first\ntime.\n", "  The recent discovery of high-energy cosmic neutrinos by the IceCube neutrino\nobservatory opens up a new field in physics, the field of neutrino astronomy.\nUsing the IceCube neutrino detector we plan to search for high-energy neutrinos\nemitted from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), since AGN are believed to be one of\nthe most promising sources of the most energetic cosmic rays and hence of\nhigh-energy neutrinos. We discuss a specific type of AGN which we plan to\ninvestigate in more detail with data obtained by the IceCube observatory. The\nmain properties of the AGN category in which we are interested are given by a\nhigh-energy jet which is pointing in our line of sight defining a class of AGN,\ncalled Blazars, and in particular the ones that are obscured by surrounding\ndust. The jet-matter interaction is expected to give an increased high-energy\nneutrino production. The properties of this specific type of AGN are expected\nto give very distinct features in the electromagnetic spectrum, which are\ndiscussed in detail.\n", "  We identify a structure in the sprectra of 1d electronic lattice models\ncharacterised by the behaviour of a gapped excitation branch. The switching of\nthis branch between symmetry sectors generates a large-scale rearrangement of\nthe spectrum, which is interpreted as a novel form of transition. We argue that\nthis is best characterised by dynamical correlations at high temperature, as\nopposed static correlations at low temperature. Remarkable similarities with\nthe behaviour of the cuprates are identified, which offers a fresh perspective\non the strange metal regime.\n", "  Nonlocality is a key feature discriminating quantum and classical physics.\nQuantum-interference phenomena, such as Young's double slit experiment, are one\nof the clearest manifestations of nonlocality, recently addressed as\n$dynamical$ to specify its origin in the quantum equations of motion. It is\nwell known that loss of dynamical nonlocality can occur due to (partial)\ncollapse of the wavefunction due to a measurement, such as which-path\ndetection. However, alternative mechanisms affecting dynamical nonlocality have\nhardly been considered, although of crucial importance in many schemes for\nquantum information processing. Here, we present a fundamentally different\npathway of losing dynamical nonlocality, demonstrating that the detailed\ngeometry of the detection scheme is crucial to preserve nonlocality. By means\nof a solid-state quantum-interference experiment we quantify this effect in a\ndiffusive system. We show that interference is not only affected by\ndecoherence, but also by a loss of dynamical nonlocality based on a local\nreduction of the number of quantum conduction channels of the interferometer.\nWith our measurements and theoretical model we demonstrate that this mechanism\nis an intrinsic property of quantum dynamics. Understanding the geometrical\nconstraints protecting nonlocality is crucial when designing quantum networks\nfor quantum information processing.\n", "  We present an extensive direct numerical simulation of statistically steady,\nhomogeneous, isotropic turbulence in two-dimensional, binary-fluid mixtures\nwith air-drag-induced friction by using the Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes\nequations. We choose parameters, e.g., the surface tension, such that we have a\ndroplet of the minority phase moving inside a turbulent background of the\nmajority phase. We characterize the deformation of the droplet and show that it\ndisplays multifractal dynamics. The probability distribution functions of the\ncomponents of the acceleration of the center of mass of the droplet exhibit\nwide, non-Gaussian tails. Our study reveals that the droplet enhances the\nenergy spectrum $E(k)$ when the wavenumber $k$ is large; this enhancement leads\nto dissipation reduction.\n", "  Rydberg-atom ensembles are switched from a weakly- into a\nstrongly-interacting regime via adiabatic transformation of the atoms from an\napproximately non-polar into a highly dipolar quantum state. The resultant\nelectric dipole-dipole forces are probed using a device akin to a field ion\nmicroscope. Ion imaging and pair-correlation analysis reveal the kinetics of\nthe interacting atoms. Dumbbell-shaped pair correlation images demonstrate the\nanisotropy of the binary dipolar force. The dipolar $C_3$ coefficient, derived\nfrom the time dependence of the images, agrees with the value calculated from\nthe permanent electric-dipole moment of the atoms. The results indicate\nmany-body dynamics akin to disorder-induced heating in strongly coupled\nparticle systems.\n", "  In this article we use a parametrized version of the FRT construction to\nconstruct two new coquasitriangular Hopf algebras. The first one,\n$\\widehat{SL_q(2)}$, is a quantization of the coordinate ring on affine\n$SL(2)$. We show that there is a duality relation between this object and the\nmore well-known $U_q(\\widehat{\\mathfrak{sl}_2})$. We then build certain\nirreducible comodules of this Hopf algebra and prove an irreducibility\ncriterion for their tensor product in the spirit of Chari and Pressley.\n  The second object is built from a solution of the parametrized Yang-Baxter\nequation with parameter group $GL(2, \\mathbb{C}) \\times GL (1,\\mathbb{C})$.\nThis solution doesn't come from any known quantum group, though it is related\nto both solutions coming from $U_{\\pm i}(\\widehat{\\mathfrak{sl}_2})$ and\n$U_q(\\widehat{\\mathfrak{gl}(1|1)})$. We then study certain irreducible\ncomodules of this newly built object.\n", "  We introduce a numerical method for identifying topological order in\ntwo-dimensional models based on one-dimensional bulk operators. The idea is to\nidentify approximate symmetries supported on thin strips through the bulk that\nbehave as string operators associated to an anyon model. We can express these\nribbon operators in matrix product form and define a cost function that allows\nus to efficiently optimize over this ansatz class. We test this method on spin\nmodels with abelian topological order by finding ribbon operators for\n$\\mathbb{Z}_d$ quantum double models with local fields and Ising-like terms. In\naddition, we identify ribbons in the abelian phase of Kitaev's honeycomb model\nwhich serve as the logical operators of the encoded qubit for the quantum\nerror-correcting code. We further identify the topologically encoded qubit in\nthe quantum compass model, and show that despite this qubit, the model does not\nsupport topological order. Finally, we discuss how the method supports\ngeneralizations for detecting nonabelian topological order.\n", "  One-dimensional world is very unusual as there is an interplay between\nquantum statistics and geometry, and a strong short-range repulsion between\natoms mimics Fermi exclusion principle, fermionizing the system. Instead, a\nsystem with a large number of components with a single atom in each, on the\nopposite acquires many bosonic properties. We study the ground-state properties\na multi-component Fermi gas trapped in a harmonic trap by fixed-node diffusion\nMonte Carlo method. We investigate how the energetic properties (energy,\ncontact) and correlation functions (density profile and momentum distribution)\nevolve as the number of components is changed. It is shown that the system\nfermionizes in the limit of strong interactions. Analytical expression are\nderived in the limit of weak interactions within the local density\napproximation for arbitrary number of components and for one plus one particle\nusing an exact solution.\n", "  Pressure, together with temperature and magnetic field, is an important\nthermodynamical parameter in physics. Investigating the response of a compound\nor of a material to pressure allows to elucidate ground states, investigate\ntheir interplay and interactions and determine microscopic parameters. Pressure\ntuning is used to establish phase diagrams, study phase transitions and\nidentify critical points. Muon spin rotation/relaxation (muSR) is now a\nstandard technique making increasing significant contribution in condensed\nmatter physics, material science research and other fields. In this review, we\nwill discuss specific requirements and challenges to perform muSR experiments\nunder pressure, introduce the high-pressure muon facility at the Paul Scherrer\nInstitute (PSI, Switzerland) and present selected results obtained by combining\nthe sensitivity of the muSR technique with pressure.\n", "  We study the network dismantling problem, which consists in determining a\nminimal set of vertices whose removal leaves the network broken into connected\ncomponents of sub-extensive size. For a large class of random graphs, this\nproblem is tightly connected to the decycling problem (the removal of vertices\nleaving the graph acyclic). Exploiting this connection and recent works on\nepidemic spreading we present precise predictions for the minimal size of a\ndismantling set in a large random graph with a prescribed (light-tailed) degree\ndistribution. Building on the statistical mechanics perspective we propose a\nthree-stage Min-Sum algorithm for efficiently dismantling networks, including\nheavy-tailed ones for which the dismantling and decycling problems are not\nequivalent. We also provide further insights into the dismantling problem\nconcluding that it is an intrinsically collective problem and that optimal\ndismantling sets cannot be viewed as a collection of individually well\nperforming nodes.\n", "  Photons carry linear momentum, and spin angular momentum when circularly or\nelliptically polarized. During light-matter interaction, transfer of linear\nmomentum leads to optical forces, while angular momentum transfer induces\noptical torque. Optical forces including radiation pressure and gradient forces\nhave long been utilized in optical tweezers and laser cooling. In nanophotonic\ndevices optical forces can be significantly enhanced, leading to unprecedented\noptomechanical effects in both classical and quantum regimes. In contrast, to\ndate, the angular momentum of light and the optical torque effect remain\nunexplored in integrated photonics. Here, we demonstrate the measurement of the\nspin angular momentum of photons propagating in a birefringent waveguide and\nthe use of optical torque to actuate rotational motion of an optomechanical\ndevice. We show that the sign and magnitude of the optical torque are\ndetermined by the photon polarization states that are synthesized on the chip.\nOur study reveals the mechanical effect of photon's polarization degree of\nfreedom and demonstrates its control in integrated photonic devices. Exploiting\noptical torque and optomechanical interaction with photon angular momentum can\nlead to torsional cavity optomechanics and optomechanical photon spin-orbit\ncoupling, as well as applications such as optomechanical gyroscope and\ntorsional magnetometry.\n", "  A new method (`explosive immunization' (EI)) is proposed for immunization and\ntargeted destruction of networks. It combines the explosive percolation (EP)\nparadigm with the idea of maintaining a fragmented distribution of clusters.\nThe ability of each node to block the spread of an infection (or to prevent the\nexistence of a large cluster of connected nodes) is estimated by a score. The\nalgorithm proceeds by first identifying low score nodes that should not be\nvaccinated/destroyed, analogously to the links selected in EP if they do not\nlead to large clusters. As in EP, this is done by selecting the worst node\n(weakest blocker) from a finite set of randomly chosen `candidates'. Tests on\nseveral real-world and model networks suggest that the method is more efficient\nand faster than any existing immunization strategy. Due to the latter property\nit can deal with very large networks.\n", "  The cubic perovskite SrVO$_3$ is generally considered to be a prototype\nstrongly correlated metal with a characteristic three-peak structure of the\n$d$-electron spectral function, featuring a renormalized quasiparticle band in\nbetween pronounced Hubbard sidebands. Here we show that this interpretation,\nwhich has been supported by numerous \"ab-initio\" simulations, has to be\nreconsidered. Using a fully self-consistent $GW$+extended dynamical mean-field\ntheory calculation we find that the screening from nonlocal Coulomb\ninteractions substantially reduces the effective local Coulomb repulsion, and\nat the same time leads to strong plasmonic effects. The resulting effective\nlocal interactions are too weak to produce pronounced Hubbard bands in the\nlocal spectral function, while prominent plasmon satellites appear at energies\nwhich agree with those of the experimentally observed sidebands. Our results\ndemonstrate the important role of nonlocal interactions and dynamical screening\nin determining the effective interaction strength of correlated compounds.\n", "  Stars and their winds can contribute to the non-thermal (NT) emission in\nextragalactic jets. Given the complexity of jet-star interactions, the\nproperties of the resulting emission are strongly linked to those of the\nemitting flows. We simulate the interaction between a stellar wind and a\nrelativistic extragalactic jet and use the hydrodynamic results to compute the\nNT emission under different conditions. We perform relativistic axisymmetric\nhydrodynamical simulations of a relativistic jet interacting with a supersonic,\nnon-relativistic stellar wind. We compute the corresponding streamlines out of\nthe simulation results, and calculate the injection, evolution, and emission of\nNT particles accelerated in the jet shock, focusing on electrons or\n$e^\\pm$-pairs. Several cases are explored, considering different jet-star\ninteraction locations, magnetic fields and observer lines of sight. The jet\nluminosity and star properties are fixed, but the results are easily scalable\nunder changes of these parameters. Individual jet-star interactions produce\nsynchrotron and inverse Compton (IC) emission that peaks from X-rays to MeV\nenergies (depending on the magnetic field), and at $\\sim 100-1000$ GeV\n(depending on the stellar type), respectively. The radiation spectrum is hard\nin the scenarios explored here due to non-radiative cooling dominance, as\nlow-energy electrons are efficiently advected even under relatively high\nmagnetic fields. Interactions of jets with cold stars lead to an even harder IC\nspectrum because of the Klein-Nishina effect in the cross-section. Doppler\nboosting has a strong impact on the observer luminosity. The emission levels\nfor individual interactions found here are in the line of previous, more\napproximate, estimates, strengthening the hypothesis that collective jet-star\ninteractions could significantly contribute at high energies under efficient\nparticle acceleration.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the dynamics of a gas of strongly interacting\nRydberg atoms subject to a time-domain Ramsey interferometry protocol. The\nmany-body dynamics is governed by an Ising-type Hamiltonian with long range\ninteractions of tunable strength. We analyze and model the contrast degradation\nand phase accumulation of the Ramsey signal and identify scaling laws for\nvarying interrogation times, ensemble densities, and ensemble dimensionalities.\n", "  The astrophysical relevance of chaos for a test particle with spin moving in\nSchwarzschild spacetime was the objective of \\cite{Verhaaren10}. Even if the\nresults of the study seem to be qualitatively in agreement with similar works,\nthe study presented in \\cite{Verhaaren10} suffers both from theoretical and\ntechnical issues. These issues are discussed in this comment.\n", "  We find multi-scalar effective field theories (EFTs) that can achieve a slow\ninflationary roll despite having a scalar potential that does not satisfy the\nusual slow-roll condition (d V)^2 << V^2/Mp^2. They evade the usual slow-roll\nconditions on $V$ because their kinetic energies are dominated by\nsingle-derivative terms rather than the usual two-derivative terms. Single\nderivatives dominate during slow roll and so do not require a breakdown of the\nusual derivative expansion that underpins calculational control in much of\ncosmology. The presence of such terms requires some sort of UV Lorentz-symmetry\nbreaking during inflation (besides the usual cosmological breaking).\nChromo-natural inflation provides an example of a UV theory that can generate\nthe multi-field single-derivative terms we consider, and we argue that the EFT\nwe find indeed captures the slow-roll conditions for the background evolution\nfor Chromo-natural inflation. We also show that our EFT can be understood as a\nmulti-field generalization of the single-field Cuscuton models. The multi-field\ncase introduces a new feature, however: the scalar kinetic terms define a\ntarget-space 2-form, F_{ab}, whose antisymmetry gives new ways for slow roll to\nbe achieved.\n", "  The phase diagram of massless quantum electrodynamics in three space-time\ndimensions as a function of fermion flavor number $N$ exhibits two well-known\nphases: at large $N > N_c^{conf}$ the system is in a conformal gapless state,\nwhile for small $N < N_c^{\\chi SB}$ the fermions are expected to develop a\ndynamical mass due to spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking. Using $\\epsilon$\nexpansion near the lower critical dimension of 2, as well as the recent results\non the generalization of the $F$ theorem to continuous dimension, we show that\n$N_c^{conf} > N_c^{\\chi SB}$. There is therefore an intermediate range of\nvalues of $N$ at which a third phase is stabilized. We demonstrate that this\nphase is characterized by spontaneous breaking of Lorentz symmetry, in which a\ncomposite vector boson field acquires a vacuum expectation value with the\nfermions and the photon remaining massless.\n", "  We develop a systematic method for deriving a quantum optical multi-mode\nHamiltonian for the interaction of photons and phonons in nanophotonic\ndielectric materials by applying perturbation theory to the electromagnetic\nHamiltonian. The Hamiltonian covers radiation pressure and electrostrictive\ninteractions on equal footing. As a paradigmatic example, we apply our method\nto a cylindrical nanoscale waveguide, and derive a Hamiltonian description of\nBrillouin quantum optomechanics. We show analytically that in nanoscale\nwaveguides radiation pressure dominates over electrostriction, in agreement\nwith recent experiments. The calculated photon-phonon coupling parameters are\nused to infer gain parameters of Stokes Brillouin scattering in good agreement\nwith experimental observations.\n", "  Second-harmonic (SH) generation is tremendously important for nonlinear\nsensing, microscopy and communication system. One of the great challenges of\ncurrent designs is to enhance the SH signal and simultaneously tune its\nradiation direction with a high directivity. In contrast to the linear\nplasmonic scattering dominated by a bulk dipolar mode, a complex\nsurface-induced multipolar source at the doubled frequency sets a fundamental\nlimit to control the SH radiation from metallic nanostructures. In this work,\nwe harness plasmonic hybridization mechanism together with a special selection\nrule governing the SH radiation to achieve the high-intensity and\ntunable-direction emission by a metallic particle-in-cavity nanoantenna\n(PIC-NA). The nanoantenna is modelled with a first-principle, self-consistent\nboundary element method, which considers the depletion of pump waves. The giant\nSH enhancement arises from a hybridized gap plasmon resonance between the small\nparticle and the large cavity that functions as a concentrator and reflector.\nCentrosymmetry breaking of the PIC-NA not only modifies the gap plasmon mode\nboosting the SH signal, but also redirects the SH wave with a unidirectional\nemission. The PIC-NA has a significantly larger SH conversion efficiency\ncompared to existing literature. The main beam of the radiation pattern can be\nsteered over a wide angle by tuning the particle's position.\n", "  We present a comprehensive quasiclassical approach for studying transport\nproperties of superconducting diffusive hybrid structures in the presence of\nextrinsic spin-orbit coupling. We derive a generalized Usadel equation and\nboundary conditions that in the normal state reduce to the drift-diffusion\ntheory governing the spin-Hall effect in inversion symmetric materials. These\nequations predict the non-dissipative spin-galvanic effect, that is the\ngeneration of supercurrents by a spin-splitting field, and its inverse -- the\ncreation of magnetic moment by a supercurrent. These effects can be seen as\ncounterparts of the spin-Hall, anomalous Hall and their inverse effects in the\nsuperconducting state. Our theory opens numerous possibilities for using\nsuperconducting structures in magnetoelectronics.\n", "  Hadronic polarization and the related anisotropy of the dilepton angular\ndistribution are studied for the reaction $\\pi N \\rightarrow Ne^+ e^-$. We\nemploy consistent effective interactions for baryon resonances up to spin-5/2,\nwhere non-physical degrees of freedom are eliminated, to compute the anisotropy\ncoefficients for isolated intermediate baryon resonances. It is shown that the\nspin and parity of the intermediate baryon resonance is reflected in the\nangular dependence of the anisotropy coefficient. We then compute the\nanisotropy coefficient including the $N(1520)$ and $N(1440)$ resonances, which\nare essential at the collision energy of the recent data obtained by the HADES\ncollaboration on this reaction. We conclude that the anisotropy coefficient\nprovides useful constraints for unravelling the resonance contributions to this\nprocess.\n", "  Many protocols of quantum information processing, like quantum key\ndistribution or measurement-based quantum computation, \"consume\" entangled\nquantum states during their execution. When participants are located at distant\nsites, these resource states need to be distributed. Due to transmission losses\nquantum repeater become necessary for large distances (e.g. $\\gtrsim$ 300 km).\nHere we generalize the concept of the graph state repeater to $D$-dimensional\ngraph states and to repeaters that can perform basic measurement-based quantum\ncomputations, which we call quantum routers. This processing of data at\nintermediate network nodes is called quantum network coding. We describe how a\nscheme to distribute general two-colorable graph states via quantum routers\nwith network coding can be constructed from classical linear network codes. The\nrobustness of the distribution of graph states against outages of network nodes\nis analysed by establishing a link to stabilizer error correction codes.\nFurthermore we show, that for any stabilizer error correction code there exists\na corresponding quantum network code with similar error correcting\ncapabilities.\n", "  We revisit planar resolvents of matrix models corresponding to ${\\cal N}\\ge3$\nChern-Simons-matter theories with the gauge groups of the form ${\\rm\nU}(N_1)\\times{\\rm U}(N_2)$ coupled to any number of bi-fundamental\nhypermultiplets. We find that the derivative of a suitably defined planar\nresolvent can be written explicitly. From this resolvent, we derive the\nexplicit formula for (a linear combination of) the vevs of BPS Wilson loops.\n", "  We give a spectral gap characterization of fullness for type $\\mathrm{III}$\nfactors which is the analog of a theorem of Connes in the tracial case. Using\nthis criterion, we generalize a theorem of Jones by proving that if $M$ is a\nfull factor and $\\sigma : G \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Aut}(M)$ is an outer action of\na discrete group $G$ whose image in $\\mathrm{Out}(M)$ is discrete then the\ncrossed product von Neumann algebra $M \\rtimes_\\sigma G$ is also a full factor.\nWe apply this result to prove the following conjecture of Tomatsu-Ueda: the\ncontinuous core of a type $\\mathrm{III}_1$ factor $M$ is full if and only if\n$M$ is full and its $\\tau$ invariant is the usual topology on $\\mathbb{R}$.\n", "  We quantify the amount of data needed in order to measure the size and\nposition of the $^8$B neutrino production region within the solar core, for\nexperiments looking at elastic scattering between electrons and solar\nneutrinos. The directions of the electrons immediately after scattering are\nstrongly correlated with the incident directions of the neutrinos, however this\nis degraded significantly by the subsequent scattering of these electrons in\nthe detector medium. We generate distributions of such electrons for different\nneutrino production profiles, and use a maximum likelihood analysis to make\nprojections for future experimental sensitivity. We find that with\napproximately 20 years worth of data the Super Kamiokande experiment could\nconstrain the central radius of the shell in which $^8$B neutrinos are produced\nto be less than 0.22 of the total solar radius at 95% confidence.\n", "  We predict that a temperature gradient can induce a magnon-mediated spin Hall\nresponse in an antiferromagnet with non-trivial magnon Berry curvature. We\ndevelop a linear response theory which gives a general condition for a Hall\ncurrent to be well defined, even when the thermal Hall response is forbidden by\nsymmetry. We apply our theory to a honeycomb lattice antiferromagnet and\ndiscuss a role of magnon edge states in a finite geometry.\n", "  Many superconducting qubit systems use the dispersive interaction between the\nqubit and a coupled harmonic resonator to perform quantum state measurement.\nPrevious works have found that such measurements can induce state transitions\nin the qubit if the number of photons in the resonator is too high. We\ninvestigate these transitions and find that they can push the qubit out of the\ntwo-level subspace, and that they show resonant behavior as a function of\nphoton number. We develop a theory for these observations based on level\ncrossings within the Jaynes-Cummings ladder, with transitions mediated by terms\nin the Hamiltonian that are typically ignored by the rotating wave\napproximation. We find that the most important of these terms comes from an\nunexpected broken symmetry in the qubit potential. We confirm the theory by\nmeasuring the photon occupation of the resonator when transitions occur while\nvarying the detuning between the qubit and resonator.\n", "  This work studies relativistic stars in beyond Horndeski scalar-tensor\ntheories that exhibit a breaking of the Vainshtein mechanism inside matter,\nfocusing on a model based on the quartic beyond Horndeski Lagrangian. We\nself-consistently derive the scalar field profile for static spherically\nsymmetric objects in asymptotically de Sitter space-time and show that the\nVainshtein breaking branch of the solutions is the physical branch thereby\nresolving several ambiguities with non-relativistic frameworks. The geometry\noutside the star is shown to be exactly Schwarzschild-de Sitter and therefore\nthe PPN parameter $\\beta_{\\rm PPN}=1$, confirming that the external screening\nworks at the post-Newtonian level. The Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV)\nequations are derived and a new lower bound on the Vainshtein breaking\nparameter $\\Upsilon_1>-4/9$ is found by requiring the existence of static\nspherically symmetric stars. Focusing on the unconstrained case where\n$\\Upsilon_1<0$, we numerically solve the TOV equations for polytropic and\nrealistic equations of state and find stars with larger radii at fixed mass.\nFurthermore, the maximum mass can increase dramatically and stars with masses\nin excess of $3M_\\odot$ can be found for relatively small values of the\nVainshtein breaking parameter. We re-examine white dwarf stars and show that\npost-Newtonian corrections are important in beyond Horndeski theories and\ntherefore the bounds coming from previous analyses should be revisited.\n", "  We consider the neutrinoless double beta ($0\\nu \\beta \\beta$) decay in the\nso-called $\\nu$MSM, in which three right-handed neutrinos with masses below the\nelectroweak scale are additionally introduced to the Standard Model. In this\nmodel there appear three heavy neutral leptons $N_1$, $N_2$, and $N_3$\ncorresponding to right-handed neutrinos. It has been known that the lightest\none $N_1$ with keV mass, which is a candidate for dark matter, gives a\nnegligible contribution to the $0 \\nu \\beta \\beta$ decay. By contrast, the\nheavier ones $N_2$ and $N_3$, which are responsible to the seesaw mechanism of\nneutrino masses and baryogenesis, give the destructive contribution (compared\nwith one from active neutrinos). This is because their mass degeneracy at high\nprecision has been assumed, which is expected by analytical studies of\nbaryogengesis. In this analysis, we find that the effective mass of the $0\\nu\n\\beta \\beta$ decay becomes larger than one from active neutrinos due to the\n$N_2$ and $N_3$ constructive contribution when the mass difference becomes\nlarger and the mass ordering of active neutrinos is inverted. Such a\npossibility will be explored by the current and near future experiments of the\n$0 \\nu \\beta \\beta$ decay.\n", "  Aiming at high precision beam position measurement of micron or sub-micron\nfor Shanghai Soft X-ray free electron laser (SXFEL) facility which is being\nbuilt in site of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF), Shanghai\nInstitute of Applied Physics has developed a high Q cavity beam position\nmonitor (CBPM) that the resonant frequency is 4.7 GHz and relevant BPM\nelectronics include dedicated RF front-end and home-made digital BPM (DBPM)\nalso has been done. The cavity design, cold test, system architecture and the\nbeam test with three adjacent pickups has been performed in Shanghai Deep\nultraviolet free electron laser(SDUV-FEL) facility are included. The beam\nexperiment results show that the physical design of our CBPM is consistent with\nthe expectations basically and the beam position resolution can fulfill the\nresolution requirements for the SXFEL project if we optimize the beam\nconditions.\n", "  We report second- and third-harmonic generation in monolayer MoS$_\\mathrm{2}$\nas a tool for imaging and accurately characterizing the material's nonlinear\noptical properties under 1560 nm excitation. Using a surface nonlinear optics\ntreatment, we derive expressions relating experimental measurements to second-\nand third-order nonlinear sheet susceptibility magnitudes, obtaining values of\n$|\\chi_s^{(2)}|=2.0\\times10^{-20}$ m$^2$ V$^{-1}$ and for the first time for\nmonolayer MoS$_\\mathrm{2}$, $|\\chi_s^{(3)}|=1.7\\times10^{-28}$ m$^3$ V$^{-2}$.\nThese sheet susceptibilities correspond to effective bulk nonlinear\nsusceptibility values of $|\\chi_{b}^{(2)}|=2.9\\times10^{-11}$ m V$^{-1}$ and\n$|\\chi_{b}^{(3)}|=2.4\\times10^{-19}$ m$^2$ V$^{-2}$, accounting for the sheet\nthickness. Experimental comparisons between MoS$_\\mathrm{2}$ and graphene are\nalso performed, demonstrating $\\sim$3.4 times stronger third-order sheet\nnonlinearity in monolayer MoS$_\\mathrm{2}$, highlighting the material's\npotential for nonlinear photonics in the telecommunications C band.\n", "  We use constructive bounded Kasparov K-theory to investigate the numerical\ninvariants stemming from the internal Kasparov products $K_i(\\mathcal A) \\times\nKK^i(\\mathcal A, \\mathcal B) \\rightarrow K_0(\\mathcal B) \\rightarrow \\mathbb\nR$, $i=0,1$, where the last morphism is provided by a tracial state. For the\nclass of properly defined finitely-summable Kasparov $(\\mathcal A,\\mathcal\nB)$-cycles, the invariants are given by the pairing of K-theory of $\\mathcal B$\nwith an element of the periodic cyclic cohomology of $\\mathcal B$, which we\ncall the generalized Connes-Chern character. When $\\mathcal A$ is a twisted\ncrossed product of $\\mathcal B$ by $\\mathbb Z^k$, $\\mathcal A = \\mathcal B\n\\rtimes_\\xi^\\theta \\mathbb Z^k$, we derive a local formula for the character\ncorresponding to the fundamental class of a properly defined Dirac cycle.\nFurthermore, when $\\mathcal B = C(\\Omega) \\rtimes_{\\xi'}^{\\phi} \\mathbb Z^j$,\nwith $C(\\Omega)$ the algebra of continuous functions over a disorder\nconfiguration space, we show that the numerical invariants are connected to the\nweak topological invariants of the complex classes of topological insulators,\ndefined in the physics literature. The end products are generalized index\ntheorems for these weak invariants, which enable us to predict the range of the\ninvariants and to identify regimes of strong disorder in which the invariants\nremain stable. The latter will be reported in a subsequent publication.\n", "  A p-n junction maintained at above ambient temperature can work as a heat\nengine, converting some of the supplied heat into electricity and rejecting\nentropy by interband emission. Such thermoradiative cells have potential to\nharvest low-grade heat into electricity. By analyzing the entropy content of\ndifferent spectral components of thermal radiation, we identify an approach to\nincrease the efficiency of thermoradiative cells via spectrally selecting\nlong-wavelength photons for radiative exchange. Furthermore, we predict that\nthe near-field photon extraction by coupling photons generated from interband\nelectronic transition to phonon polariton modes on the surface of a heat sink\ncan increase the conversion efficiency as well as the power generation density,\nproviding more opportunities to efficiently utilize terrestrial emission for\nclean energy. An ideal InSb thermoradiative cell can achieve a maximum\nefficiency and power density up to 20.4 % and 327 Wm-2, respectively, between a\nhot source at 500K and a cold sink at 300K. However, sub-bandgap and\nnon-radiative losses will significantly degrade the cell performance.\n", "  NOON state interference (NOON-SI) is a powerful tool to improve the phase\nsensing precision, and can play an important role in quantum sensing and\nquantum imaging. However, most of the previous NOON-SI experiments only\ninvestigated the center part of the interference pattern, while the full range\nof the NOON-SI pattern has not yet been well explored.In this Letter, we\nexperimentally and theoretically demonstrate up to six-photon NOON-SI and study\nthe properties of the interference patterns over the full range.The\nmulti-photons were generated at a wavelength of 1584 nm from a PPKTP crystal in\na parametric down conversion process.It was found that the shape, the coherence\ntime and the visibility of the interference patterns were strongly dependent on\nthe detection schemes.This experiment can be used for applications which are\nbased on the envelope of the NOON-SI pattern, such as quantum spectroscopy and\nquantum metrology.\n", "  We study the hitherto un-addressed phenomenon of Quantum Hall Effect with a\nmagnetic and electric fields oscillating in time with resonant frequencies.\nThis phenomenon realizes an example of heterodyne device with the magnetic\nfield acting as a driving and is analyzed in detail in its classical and\nquantum versions using Floquet theory. A bulk current flowing perpendicularly\nto the applied electric field is found, with a frequency shifted by integer\nmultiples of the driving frequency. When the ratio of the cyclotron and driving\nfrequency takes special values, the electron's classical trajectory forms a\nloop and the effective mass diverges, while in the quantum case we find an\nanalogue of the Landau quantization. Possible realization using metamaterial\nplasmonics is discussed.\n", "  We study the time evolution of the magnetic field in a plasma with a chiral\nmagnetic current. The Vector Spherical Harmonic functions (VSH) are used to\nexpand all fields. We define a measure for the Chandrasekhar-Kendall-Woltjer\n(CKW) state, which has a simple form in VSH expansion. We propose the\nconditions for a general class of initial momentum spectra that will evolve\ninto the CKW state. For this class of initial conditions, to approach the CKW\nstate, (i) a non-vanishing chiral magnetic conductivity is necessary, and (ii)\nthe time integration of the product of the electric resistivity and chiral\nmagnetic conductivity must grow faster than the time integration of the\nresistivity. We give a few examples to test these conditions numerically which\nwork very well.\n", "  By breaking the spin symmetry in the relativistic domain, a powerful tool in\nphysical sciences was lost. In this work, we examine an alternative of spin\nsymmetry for systems described by the many-electron Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian.\nWe show that the square of many-electron operator $\\mathcal{K}_+$, defined as a\nsum of individual single-electron time-reversal (TR) operators, is a linear\nHermitian operator which commutes with the Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian in a\nfinite Fock subspace. In contrast to the square of a standard unitary\nmany-electron TR operator $\\mathcal{K}$, the $\\mathcal{K}^2_+$ has a rich\neigenspectrum having potential to substitute spin symmetry in the relativistic\ndomain. We demonstrate that $\\mathcal{K}_+$ is connected to $\\mathcal{K}$\nthrough an exponential mapping, in the same way as spin operators are mapped to\nthe spin rotational group. Consequently, we call $\\mathcal{K}_+$ the generator\nof the many-electron TR symmetry. By diagonalizing the operator\n$\\mathcal{K}^2_+$ in the basis of Kramers-restricted Slater determinants, we\nintroduce the relativistic variant of configuration state functions (CSF),\ndenoted as Kramers CSF. A new quantum number associated with $\\mathcal{K}^2_+$\nhas potential to be used in many areas, for instance, (a) to design effective\nspin Hamiltonians for electron spin resonance spectroscopy of heavy-element\ncontaining systems; (b) to increase efficiency of methods for the solution of\nmany-electron problems in relativistic computational chemistry and physics; (c)\nto define Kramers contamination in unrestricted density functional and\nHartree--Fock theory as a relativistic analog of the spin contamination in the\nnonrelativistic domain.\n", "  Using the properties of the transfer matrix of one-dimensional quantum\nmechanical systems, we derive a technique to exactly compute the persistent\ncurrent across a hybrid normal-superconducting-mesoscopic ring pierced by a\nmagnetic flux Phi as a single integral of a known function of the system's\nparameters. Our approach provides exact results at zero temperature, which can\nbe readily extended to finite temperatures T much below the superconducting\ngap. We apply our technique to derive the persistent current through p-wave and\ns-wave superconducting-normal hybrid rings, recovering at once a number of\neffects such as the crossover in the current periodicity on increasing the size\nof the ring and the signature of the topological phase transition in the p-wave\ncase. In the limit of a large ring size, resorting to a systematic expansion in\ninverse powers of the ring length, we derive exact analytic closed-form\nformulas, applicable to a number of cases of physical interest.\n", "  Aims. In this work we rigorously show the shortcomings of various\nsimplifications that are used to calculate the total internal partition\nfunction. These shortcomings can lead to errors of up to 40 percent or more in\nthe estimated partition function. These errors carry on to calculations of\nthermodynamic quantities. Therefore a more complicated approach has to be\ntaken.\n  Methods. Seven possible simplifications of various complexity are described,\ntogether with advantages and disadvantages of direct summation of experimental\nvalues. These were compared to what we consider the most accurate and most\ncomplete treatment (case 8). Dunham coefficients were determined from\nexperimental and theoretical energy levels of a number of electronically\nexcited states of H$_2$ . Both equilibrium and normal hydrogen was taken into\nconsideration.\n  Results. Various shortcomings in existing calculations are demonstrated, and\nthe reasons for them are explained. New partition functions for equilibrium,\nnormal, and ortho and para hydrogen are calculated and thermodynamic quantities\nare reported for the temperature range 1 - 20000 K. Our results are compared to\nprevious estimates in the literature. The calculations are not limited to the\nground electronic state, but include all bound and quasi-bound levels of\nexcited electronic states. Dunham coefficients of these states of H$_2$ are\nalso reported.\n  Conclusions. For most of the relevant astrophysical cases it is strongly\nadvised to avoid using simplifications, such as a harmonic oscillator and rigid\nrotor or ad hoc summation limits of the eigenstates to estimate accurate\npartition functions and to be particularly careful when using polynomial fits\nto the computed values. Reported internal partition functions and thermodynamic\nquantities in the present work are shown to be more accurate than previously\navailable data.\n", "  Positive energy unitary irreducible representations of $SU(2,2)$ can be\nconstructed with the aid of bosonic oscillators in (anti)fundamental\nrepresentation of $SU(2)_L\\times SU(2)_R$ that are closely related to Penrose\ntwistors. Starting with the correspondence between the doubleton\nrepresentations, homogeneous functions on projective twistor space and on-shell\n$SL(2,\\mathbb C)$ generalized Weyl curvature spinors and their low-spin\ncounterparts, we study in the similar way the correspondence between the\nmassless representations, homogeneous functions on ambitwistor space and, via\nthe Penrose transform, with the gauge fields on Minkowski boundary of $AdS_5$.\nThe possibilities of reconstructing massless fields on $AdS_5$ and some\napplications are also discussed.\n", "  Black phosphorus has been the subject of growing interest due to its unique\nband structure that is both layer dependent and anisotropic. While many have\nstudied the linear optical response of black phosphorus, the nonlinear response\nhas remained relatively unexplored. Here we report on the observation of\nthird-harmonic generation in black phosphorus using an ultrafast near-IR laser\nand measure Chi(3) experimentally for the first time. It was found that the\nthird-harmonic emission is highly anisotropic, dependent on the incident\npolarization, and varies strongly with the number of layers present due to\nsignal depletion and phase-matching conditions.\n", "  Well-known measures of entanglement in one-dimensional many body quantum\nsystems, such as the entanglement entropy and the logarithmic negativity, may\nbe expressed in terms of the correlation functions of local fields known as\nbranch point twist fields in a replica quantum field theory. In this \"replica\"\napproach the computation of measures of entanglement generally involves a\nmathematically non-trivial analytic continuation in the number of replicas. In\nthis paper we consider two-point functions of twist fields and their analytic\ncontinuation in the 1+1 dimensional massive (non-compactified) free Boson\ntheory. This is one of the few theories for which all matrix elements of twist\nfields are known so that we may hope to compute correlation functions very\nprecisely. We study two particular two-point functions which are related to the\nlogarithmic negativity of semi-infinite disjoint intervals and to the\nentanglement entropy of one interval. We show that our prescription for the\nanalytic continuation yields results which are in full agreement with conformal\nfield theory predictions in the short-distance limit. We provide numerical\nestimates of universal quantities and their ratios, both in the massless (twist\nfield structure constants) and the massive (expectation values of twist fields)\ntheory. We find that particular ratios are given by divergent form factor\nexpansions. We propose such divergences stem from the presence of logarithmic\nfactors in addition to the expected power-law behaviour of two-point functions\nat short-distances. Surprisingly, at criticality these corrections give rise to\na log(logL) correction to the entanglement entropy of one interval of length L.\nThis hitherto overlooked result is in agreement with results by Calabrese,\nCardy and Tonni and has been independently derived by Blondeau-Fournier and\nDoyon (in preparation).\n", "  We present a Michelson-type microwave interferometer for use in ferromagnetic\nresonance experiments. The interferometer is capable of broadband operation\nwithout manual adjustment of phase delay or amplitude attenuation. A prototype\nof the design shows significant improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio when\ncompared to non-interferometric ferromagnetic resonance experiments. We\ndemonstrate that this increase in sensitivity can lead to a drastic increase in\nthe data acquisition rate for hard-to-measure thin films that otherwise would\nrequire long integration times.\n", "  We analyze the rapidity and transverse momentum dependence for the cumulants\nof the net-proton and net-baryon distributions in Au+Au collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{\\text{NN}}} = 5\\,\\text{GeV}$ with a microscopic hadronic transport\n(JAM) model. To study the effects of mean field potential and softening of\nequation of state (EoS) on the fluctuations of net-proton (baryon) in heavy-ion\ncollisions, the calculations are performed with two different modes. The\nsoftening of EoS is realized in the model by implementing the attractive orbit\nin the two-body scattering to introduce a reduction pressure of the system. By\ncomparing the results from the two modes with the results from default cascade,\nwe find the mean field potential and softening of EoS have strong impacts on\nthe rapidity distributions ($\\text{d}N/\\text{d}y$) and the shape of the\nnet-proton (baryon) multiplicity distributions. The net-proton (baryon)\ncumulants and their ratios calculated from all of the three modes are with\nsimilar trends and show significant suppression with respect to unity, which\ncan be explained by the presence of baryon number conservations. It indicates\nthat the effects of mean field potential and softening of EoS might be not the\ningredients that are responsible to the observed strong enhancement in the most\ncentral Au+Au collisions at 7.7 GeV measured by the STAR experiment at RHIC.\n", "  By mixing glass beads with a curable polymer we create a well-defined\ncohesive granular medium, held together by solidified, and hence elastic,\ncapillary bridges. This material has a geometry similar to a wet packing of\nbeads, but with an additional control over the elasticity of the bonds holding\nthe particles together. We show that its mechanical response can be varied over\nseveral orders of magnitude by adjusting the size and stiffness of the bridges,\nand the size of the particles. We also investigate its mechanism of failure\nunder unconfined uniaxial compression in combination with in situ x-ray\nmicrotomography. We show that a broad linear-elastic regime ends at a limiting\nstrain of about 8%, whatever the stiffness of the agglomerate, which\ncorresponds to the beginning of shear failure. The possibility to finely tune\nthe stiffness, size and shape of this simple material makes it an ideal model\nsystem for investigations on, for example, fracturing of porous rocks,\nseismology, or root growth in cohesive porous media.\n", "  We present a study of the isospin-violating one-pion strong decays of single\nheavy tetraquarks $X_Q = X(s q \\bar q \\bar Q)$, $Q=c, b$, and $q=u, d$ with\nspin-parity $J^P = 0^+$. We assume that the tetraquarks have the configuration\nof a color diquark and a antidiquark. Three mechanisms of isospin violation can\ncontribute to the decay rate: (1) mixing of the $X(s u \\bar u \\bar Q)$ and $X(s\nd \\bar d \\bar Q)$ tetraquark currents, (2) an explicit $m_d-m_u$ quark mass\ndifference in the quark diagrams describing the corresponding decay transitions\nand (3) $\\pi^0-\\eta$ mixing in the final state. Our main results are: (1) It is\nquite likely that the investigated tetraquark states are isosinglet states with\na small admixture of an isotriplet component; (2) The first isospin-breaking\nmechanism affects the decay rater more significantly than the others; (3) Our\ncalculations contain a size parameter $\\Lambda_{X_Q}$, characterizing the\ndistribution of the quarks in the tetraquark state $X_Q$. Absolute decay rates\ndepend very much on the choice of $\\Lambda_{X_Q}$, varied from 1 to 2 GeV,\nreflecting the compactness of the multiquark system.\n", "  In the Ratra scenario of inflationary magnetogenesis, the kinematic coupling\nbetween the photon and the inflaton undergoes a nonanalytical jump at the end\nof inflation. Using smooth interpolating analytical forms of the coupling\nfunction, we show that such unphysical jump does not invalidate the main\nprediction of the model, which still represents a viable mechanism for\nexplaining cosmic magnetization. Nevertheless, there is a spurious result\nassociated with the nonanaliticity of the coupling, to wit, the prediction that\nthe spectrum of created photons has a power-law decay in the ultraviolet\nregime. This issue is discussed using both semiclassical approximation and\nsmooth coupling functions.\n", "  We revisit low-scale gauge mediation models in light of recent observations\nof CMB Lensing and Cosmic Shear which put a severe upper limit on the gravitino\nmass, $m_{3/2} \\lesssim 4.7$eV. With such a stringent constraint, many models\nof low-scale gauge mediation are excluded when the squark masses are required\nto be rather large to explain the observed Higgs boson mass. In this note, we\ndiscuss a type of low-scale gauge mediation models which satisfy both the\nobserved Higgs boson mass and the upper limit on the gravitino mass. We also\nshow that the gravitino mass cannot be smaller than about 1eV even in such\nmodels, which may be tested in future observations of 21 cm line fluctuations.\n", "  We exploit the techniques of Bonora-Tonin superfield formalism to derive the\noff-shell nilpotent and absolutely anticommuting (anti-)BRST as well as\n(anti-)co-BRST symmetry transformations for the (1+1)-dimensional (2D)\nbosonized vector Schwinger model. In the derivation of above symmetries, we\ninvoke the (dual)-horizontality conditions as well as gauge and (anti-)co-BRST\ninvariant restrictions on the superfields that are defined onto the (2,\n2)-dimensional supermanifold. We provide geometrical interpretation of the\nabove nilpotent symmetries (and their corresponding charges). We also express\nthe nilpotency and absolute anticommutativity of the (anti-)BRST and\n(anti-)co-BRST charges within the framework of augmented superfield formalism.\n", "  We present a theory describing the local electronic properties of the\nperovskite rare earth nickelates--materials which have negative charge transfer\nenergies, strong O $2p$ -- Ni $3d$ covalence, and breathing mode lattice\ndistortions at the origin of highly studied metal-insulator and\nantiferromagnetic ordering transitions. Utilizing a full orbital, full\ncorrelation double cluster approach, we find strong charge fluctuations in\nagreement with a bond disproportionation interpretation. The unique double\ncluster formulation permits the inclusion of necessary orbital degeneracies and\nCoulomb interactions to calculate resonant x-ray spectral responses, with which\nwe find excellent agreement with well-established experimental results. This\npreviously absent, crucial link between theory and experiment provides\nvalidation of the recently proposed bond disproportionation theory, and\nprovides an analysis methodology for spectroscopic studies of engineered phases\nof nickelates and other high valence transition metal compounds.\n", "  Electron-vibron coupling in quantum dots can lead to a strong suppression of\nthe average current in the sequential tunneling regime. This effect is known as\nFranck-Condon blockade and can be traced back to an overlap integral between\nvibron states with different electron numbers which becomes exponentially small\nfor large electron-vibron coupling strength. Here, we investigate the effect of\na time-dependent drive on this phenomenon, in particular the effect of an\noscillatory gate voltage acting on the electronic dot level. We employ two\ndifferent approaches: perturbation theory based on nonequilibrium Keldysh\nGreen's functions and a master equation in Born-Markov approximation. In both\ncases, we find that the drive can lift the blockade by exciting vibrons. As a\nconsequence, the relative change in average current grows exponentially with\nthe drive strength.\n", "  $P$-wave coupled channel effects arising from the $D\\bar{D}$,\n$D\\bar{D}^*+c.c.$, and $D^*\\bar{D}^*$ thresholds in $e^+e^-$ annihilations are\nsystematically studied. We provide an exploratory study by solving the\nLippmann-Schwinger equation with short-ranged contact potentials obtained in\nthe heavy quark limit. These contact potentials can be extracted from the\n$P$-wave interactions in the $e^+e^-$ annihilations, and then be employed to\ninvestigate possible isosinglet $P$-wave hadronic molecules. In particular,\nsuch an investigation may provide information about exotic candidates with\nquantum numbers $J^{PC}=1^{-+}$. In the mass region of the $D\\bar{D}$,\n$D\\bar{D}^*+c.c.$, and $D^*\\bar{D}^*$ thresholds, there are two quark model\nbare states, i.e. the $\\psi(3770)$ and $\\psi(4040)$, which are assigned as\n$(1^3D_1)$ and $(3^1S_1)$ states, respectively. By an overall fit of the cross\nsections of $e^+e^-\\to D\\bar{D}$, $D\\bar{D}^*+c.c.$, $D^*\\bar{D}^*$, we\ndetermine the physical coupling constants to each channel and extract the pole\npositions of the $\\psi(3770)$ and $\\psi(4040)$. The deviation of the ratios\nfrom that in the heavy quark spin symmetry (HQSS) limit reflects the HQSS\nbreaking effect due to the mass splitting between the $D$ and the $D^*$.\nBesides the two poles, we also find a pole a few MeV above the\n$D\\bar{D}^*+c.c.$ threshold which can be related to the so-called $G(3900)$\nobserved earlier by BABAR and Belle. This scenario can be further scrutinized\nby measuring the angular distribution in the $D^*\\bar{D}^*$ channel with high\nluminosity experiments.\n", "  The hot intra-cluster medium (ICM) is rich in metals, which are synthesised\nby supernovae (SNe) and accumulate over time into the deep gravitational\npotential well of clusters of galaxies. Since most of the elements visible in\nX-rays are formed by type Ia (SNIa) and/or core-collapse (SNcc) supernovae,\nmeasuring their abundances gives us direct information on the nucleosynthesis\nproducts of billions of SNe since the epoch of the star formation peak (z~2-3).\nIn this study, we compare the most accurate average X/Fe abundance ratios\n(compiled in a previous work from XMM-Newton EPIC and RGS observations of 44\ngalaxy clusters, groups, and ellipticals), representative of the chemical\nenrichment in the nearby ICM, to various SNIa and SNcc nucleosynthesis models\nfound in the literature. The use of a SNcc model combined to any favoured\nstandard SNIa model (deflagration or delayed-detonation) fails to reproduce our\nabundance pattern. In particular, the Ca/Fe and Ni/Fe ratios are significantly\nunderestimated by the models. We show that the Ca/Fe ratio can be reproduced\nbetter, either by taking a SNIa delayed-detonation model that matches the\nobservations of the Tycho supernova remnant, or by adding a contribution from\nthe Ca-rich gap transient SNe, whose material should easily mix into the hot\nICM. On the other hand, the Ni/Fe ratio can be reproduced better by assuming\nthat both deflagration and delayed-detonation SNIa contribute in similar\nproportions to the ICM enrichment. In either case, the fraction of SNIa over\nthe total number of SNe (SNIa+SNcc) contributing to the ICM enrichment ranges\nwithin 29-45%. This fraction is found to be systematically higher than the\ncorresponding SNIa/SNe fraction contributing to the enrichment of the\nproto-solar environnement (15-25%). We also discuss and quantify two useful\nconstraints on both SNIa and SNcc that can be inferred from the ICM abundance\nratios.\n", "  Nearly all nontrivial real-world systems are nonlinear dynamical systems.\nChaos describes certain nonlinear dynamical systems that have a very sensitive\ndependence on initial conditions. Chaotic systems are always deterministic and\nmay be very simple, yet they produce completely unpredictable and divergent\nbehavior. Systems of nonlinear equations are difficult to solve analytically,\nand scientists have relied heavily on visual and qualitative approaches to\ndiscover and analyze the dynamics of nonlinearity. Indeed, few fields have\ndrawn as heavily from visualization methods for their seminal innovations: from\nstrange attractors, to bifurcation diagrams, to cobweb plots, to phase diagrams\nand embedding. Although the social sciences are increasingly studying these\ntypes of systems, seminal concepts remain murky or loosely adopted. This\narticle has three aims. First, it argues for several visualization methods to\ncritically analyze and understand the behavior of nonlinear dynamical systems.\nSecond, it uses these visualizations to introduce the foundations of nonlinear\ndynamics, chaos, fractals, self-similarity and the limits of prediction.\nFinally, it presents Pynamical, an open-source Python package to easily\nvisualize and explore nonlinear dynamical systems' behavior.\n", "  We examine the four-quark structure of the recently discovered charged\n$Z_c(3900)$, $Z(4430)$, and $X_b(5568)$ states. We calculate the widths of the\nstrong decays $Z_c^+ \\to J/\\psi \\pi^+$ ($\\eta_c\\rho^+$, $\\bar D^0D^{\\ast\\,+}$,\n$\\bar D^{\\ast\\,0}D^+$), $Z(4430)^+ \\to J/\\psi \\pi^+$ ($\\psi(2s) \\pi^+$), and\n$X^+_b\\to B_s\\pi^+$ within a covariant quark model previously developed by us.\nWe find that the tetraquark-type current widely used in the literature for the\n$Z_c(3900)$ leads to a significant suppression of the $\\bar D D^\\ast$ and $\\bar\nD^\\ast D$ modes. Contrary to this a molecular-type current provides an\nenhancement by a factor of 6-7 for the $\\bar D D^\\ast$ modes compared with the\n$Z_c^+\\to J/\\psi\\pi^+$, $\\eta_c\\rho^+$ modes in agreement with recent\nexperimental data from the BESIII Collaboration. In case of the $Z(4430)$ state\nwe test a sensitivity of the ratio $R_Z$ of the $Z(4430)^+ \\to \\psi(2s) \\pi^+$\nand $Z(4430)^+ \\to J/\\psi \\pi^+$ decay rates to a choice of the size parameter\n$\\Lambda_{Z(4430)}$ of the $Z(4430)$. Using upper constraint for the sum of\nthese two modes deduced from the LHCb Collaboration data we find that $R_Z$\nvaries from 4.64 to 4.08 when $\\Lambda_{Z(4430)}$ changes from 2.2 to 3.2 GeV.\nAlso we make the prediction for the $Z(4430)^+ \\to D^{\\ast\\,+} \\bar\nD^{\\ast\\,0}$ decay rate.\n", "  We study the generation of strong large scale magnetic fields in dense quark\nmatter. The magnetic field growth is owing to the magnetic field instability\ndriven by the electroweak interaction of quarks. We discuss the situation when\nthe chiral symmetry is unbroken in the degenerate quark matter. In this case we\npredict the amplification of the seed magnetic field $10^{12}\\,\\text{G}$ to the\nstrengths $(10^{14}-10^{15})\\,\\text{G}$. In our analysis we use the typical\nparameters of the quark matter in the core of a hybrid star or in a quark star.\nWe also discuss the application of the obtained results to describe the\nmagnetic fields generation in magnetars.\n", "  We elaborate a simple classification scheme of all rank-5 SU(2)-spin\nrotational symmetric tensors according to i) the on-site physical spin-$S$,\n(ii) the local Hilbert space $V^{\\otimes 4}$ of the four virtual (composite)\nspins attached to each site and (iii) the irreducible representations of the\n$C_{4v}$ point group of the square lattice. We apply our scheme to draw a\ncomplete list of all SU(2)-symmetric translationally and rotationally-invariant\nProjected Entangled Pair States (PEPS) with bond dimension $D\\leqslant 6$. All\nknown SU(2)-symmetric PEPS on the square lattice are recovered and simple\ngeneralizations are provided in some cases. More generally, to each of our\nsymmetry class can be associated a $({\\cal D}-1)$-dimensional manifold of spin\nliquids (potentially) preserving lattice symmetries and defined in terms of\n${\\cal D}$ independent tensors of a given bond dimension $D$. In addition,\ngeneric (low-dimensional) families of PEPS explicitly breaking either (i)\nparticular point-group lattice symmetries (lattice nematics) or (ii) time\nreversal symmetry (chiral spin liquids) or (iii) SU(2)-spin rotation symmetry\ndown to $U(1)$ (spin nematics or N\\'eel antiferromagnets) can also be\nconstructed. We apply this framework to search for new topological chiral spin\nliquids characterized by well-defined chiral edge modes, as revealed by their\nentanglement spectrum. In particular, we show how the symmetrization of a\ndouble-layer PEPS leads to a chiral topological state with a gapless edge\ndescribed by a SU(2)$_2$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model.\n", "  We point out that a class of non-supersymmetric models based on the gauge\ngroup $SU(3)_C \\times SU(2)_L\\times SU(2)_R\\times U(1)_{Y_L}\\times U(1)_{Y_R}$\npossesses an automatic, exact $Z_{2 }$ symmetry under which the fermions in the\n$SU(2)_R\\times U(1)_{Y_R}$ sector (called $R$-sector) are odd and those in the\nstandard model sector (called $L$-sector) are even. This symmetry, which is\ndifferent from the usual parity symmetry of the left-right symmetric models,\npersists in the lepton sector even after the gauge symmetry breaks down to\n$SU(3)_C \\times U(1)_{\\rm EM}$. This keeps the lightest right-handed neutrino\nnaturally stable, thereby allowing it to play the role of dark matter (DM) in\nthe Universe. There are several differences between the usual left-right models\nand the model presented here: (i) our model can have two versions, one which\nhas no parity symmetry so that the couplings and masses in the $L$ and $R$\nsectors are unrelated, and another which has parity symmetry so that couplings\nare related; (ii) the $R$-sector fermions are chosen much heavier than the\n$L$-sector ones in both scenarios; and finally (iii) both light and heavy\nneutrinos are Majorana fermions with the light neutrino masses arising from a\npure type-II seesaw mechanism. We discuss the DM relic density, direct and\nindirect detection prospects and associated collider signatures of the model.\nComparing with current collider and direct detection constraints, we find a\nlower bound on the DM mass of order of 1 TeV. We also point out a way to relax\nthe DM unitarity bound in our model for much larger DM masses by an entropy\ndilution mechanism. An additional feature of the model is that the DM can be\nmade very long lived, if desired, by allowing for weak breaking of the above\n$Z_{2}$ symmetry. Our model also predicts the existence of long-lived colored\nparticles which could be searched for at the LHC.\n", "  Magnetic susceptibility of the topological Weyl, type-II Weyl, Dirac, and\nline node semimetals is theoretically investigated. Dependences of this\nsusceptibility on the chemical potential, temperature, direction and magnitude\nof the magnetic field are found. The obtained results show that magnetic\nmeasurements can be very useful in investigating these semimetals. As an\nexample, we calculate magnetic susceptibility of Cd$_3$As$_2$, Na$_3$Bi, and\nCa$_3$P$_2$.\n", "  We investigate the dispersion relations for light coupled to one-dimensional\nensembles of atoms with different level schemes. The unifying feature of all\nthe considered setups is that the forward and backward propagating quantum\nfields are coupled by the applied classical drives such that the group velocity\ncan vanish in an effect known as \"stationary light\". We derive the dispersion\nrelations for all the considered schemes, highlighting the important\ndifferences between them. Furthermore, we show that additional control of\nstationary light can be obtained by treating atoms as discrete scatterers and\nplacing them at well defined positions. For the latter purpose, a multi-mode\ntransfer matrix theory for light is developed.\n", "  We report European Very Long Baseline Interferometry Network (EVN) radio\ncontinuum observations of ASASSN-14li, one of the best studied tidal disruption\nevents (TDEs) to date. At 1.7 GHz with ~12x6mas resolution, the emission is\nunresolved. At 5.0 GHz with ~3x2mas resolution, the radio emission shows an\nextended structure that can be modeled with two components: a core-like\ncomponent and a fainter, possibly elongated source 4.3mas (~2pc) away. Our\nobservations are not conclusive as to the nature of the components, but three\nscenarios are discussed. One possibility is a core-jet/outflow morphology, thus\nmaking of ASASSN-14li the first TDE jet/outflow directly imaged. For this case,\nthe projected separation between the two components can only be explained by\nsuperluminal motion, rather than the lower velocities inferred from\nlow-resolution radio observations. However, typical fast moving jets have\nbrightness temperatures ~5 orders of magnitude higher than we find, thus making\nthis scenario less likely. The second possibility is that we are imaging a\nnon-relativistic jet from past AGN/TDE activity. In this case a past TDE is\npreferred given that the spatial extension and radio luminosity of the\nelongated component are consistent with the theoretical predictions for a TDE\noutflow. Alternatively, the two sources could indicate the presence of a binary\nblack hole, which would then naturally explain the enhanced TDE rates of\npost-starburst galaxies. Future EVN observations will help us to distinguish\nbetween these scenarios.\n", "  Motivated by the hypothesis that dark matter self-interactions provide a\nsolution to the small-scale structure formation problems, we investigate the\npossibilities that the relic density of a self-interacting dark matter\ncandidate can proceed from the thermal freeze-out of annihilations into\nStandard Model particles. We find that scalar and Majorana dark matter in the\nmass range of $10-500$ MeV, coupled to a slightly heavier massive gauge boson,\nare the only possible candidates in agreement with multiple current\nexperimental constraints. Here dark matter annihilations take place at a much\nslower rate than the self-interactions simply because the interaction\nconnecting the Standard Model and the dark matter sectors is small. We also\ndiscuss prospects of establishing or excluding these two scenarios in future\nexperiments.\n", "  We report the detection of OH+ and H2O+ in the z=0.89 absorber toward the\nlensed quasar PKS1830-211. The abundance ratio of OH+ and H2O+ is used to\nquantify the molecular hydrogen fraction (fH2) and the cosmic-ray ionization\nrate of atomic hydrogen (zH) along two lines of sight, located at ~2 kpc and ~4\nkpc to either side of the absorber's center. The molecular fraction decreases\noutwards, from ~0.04 to ~0.02, comparable to values measured in the Milky Way\nat similar galactocentric radii. For zH, we find values of ~2x10^-14 s^-1 and\n~3x10^-15 s^-1, respectively, which are slightly higher than in the Milky Way\nat comparable galactocentric radii, possibly due to a higher average star\nformation activity in the z=0.89 absorber. The ALMA observations of OH+, H2O+,\nand other hydrides toward PKS1830-211 reveal the multi-phase composition of the\nabsorbing gas. Taking the column density ratios along the southwest and\nnortheast lines of sight as a proxy of molecular fraction, we classify the\nspecies ArH+, OH+, H2Cl+, H2O+, CH, and HF as tracing gases increasingly more\nmolecular. Incidentally, our data allow us to improve the accuracy of H2O+ rest\nfrequencies and thus refine the spectroscopic parameters.\n", "  We study the evolution of cosmological perturbations in a contracting\nuniverse. We aim to determine under which conditions density perturbations grow\nto form large inhomogeneities and collapse into black holes. Our method\nconsists in solving the cosmological perturbation equations in complete\ngenerality for a hydrodynamical fluid. We then describe the evolution of the\nfluctuations over the different length scales of interest and as a function of\nthe equation of state for the fluid, and we explore two different types of\ninitial conditions: quantum vacuum and thermal fluctuations. We also derive a\ngeneral requirement for black hole collapse on sub-Hubble scales, and we use\nthe Press-Schechter formalism to describe the black hole formation probability.\nFor a fluid with a small sound speed (e.g., dust), we find that both quantum\nand thermal initial fluctuations grow in a contracting universe, and the\nlargest inhomogeneities that first collapse into black holes are of Hubble size\nand the collapse occurs well before reaching the Planck scale. For a\nradiation-dominated fluid, we find that no black hole can form before reaching\nthe Planck scale. In the context of matter bounce cosmology, it thus appears\nthat only models in which a radiation-dominated era begins early in the\ncosmological evolution are robust against the formation of black holes. Yet,\nthe formation of black holes might be an interesting feature for other models.\nWe comment on a number of possible alternative early universe scenarios that\ncould take advantage of this feature.\n", "  Photo-induced transition probabilities in graphene are studied theoretically\nfrom the viewpoint of Floquet theory. Conduction band populations are computed\nfor a strongly, periodically driven graphene sheet under linear, circular, and\nelliptic polarization. Features of the momentum spectrum of excited\nquasi-particles can be directly related to the avoided crossing of the Floquet\nquasi-energy levels. In particular, the impact of the ellipticity and the\nstrength of the laser excitation on the avoided crossing structure -- and on\nthe resulting transition probabilities -- is studied. It is shown that the\nellipticity provides an additional control parameter over the phenomenon of\ncoherent destruction of tunneling in graphene, allowing one to selectively\nsuppress multiphoton resonances.\n", "  Transposable elements, or transposons, are DNA sequences that can jump from\nsite to site in the genome during the life cycle of a cell, usually encoding\nthe very enzymes which perform their excision. However, some transposons are\nparasitic, relying on the enzymes produced by the regular transposons. In this\ncase, we show that a stochastic model, which takes into account the small copy\nnumbers of the transposons in a cell, predicts noise-induced predator-prey\noscillations with a characteristic time scale that is much longer than the cell\nreplication time, indicating that the state of the predator-prey oscillator is\nstored in the genome and transmitted to successive generations. Our work\ndemonstrates the important role of number fluctuations in the expression of\nmobile genetic elements, and shows explicitly how ecological concepts can be\napplied to the dynamics and fluctuations of living genomes.\n", "  We present a cognitive model of opinion dynamics which studies the behavior\nof a population of interacting individuals in the context of risk of natural\ndisaster. In particular, we investigate the response of the individuals to the\ninformation received by institutional sources about the correct behaviors for\nprevention and harm reduction. The results of our study show that alarmist\nopinions are more likely to be adopted by populations, since worried people\n", "  We analyze the structural and magnetic characteristics of (111)-oriented\nlutetium iron garnet (Lu$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$) films grown by molecular-beam\nepitaxy, for films as thin as 2.8 nm. Thickness-dependent measurements of the\nin- and out-of-plane ferromagnetic resonance allow us to quantify the effects\nof two-magnon scattering, along with the surface anisotropy and the saturation\nmagnetization. We achieve effective damping coefficients of $11.1(9) \\times\n10^{-4}$ for 5.3 nm films and $32(3) \\times 10^{-4}$ for 2.8 nm films, among\nthe lowest values reported to date for any insulating ferrimagnetic sample of\ncomparable thickness.\n", "  We pose the question of how much information on the atmospheric parameters of\nlate-type stars can be retrieved purely from colors using standard photometric\nsystems. We carried out numerical experiments using stellar fluxes from model\natmospheres, injecting random noise before analyzing them. We examined the\npresence of degeneracies among atmospheric parameters, and evaluated how well\nthe parameters are extracted depending on the number and wavelength span of the\nphotometric filters available, from the UV GALEX to the mid-IR WISE passbands.\nWe also considered spectrophotometry from the Gaia mission. We find that\nstellar effective temperatures can be determined accurately ($\\sigma \\sim$ 0.01\ndex or about 150 K) when reddening is negligible or known, based merely on\noptical photometry, and the accuracy can be improved twofold by including IR\ndata. On the other hand, stellar metallicities and surface gravities are fairly\nunconstrained from optical or IR photometryy. However, our ability to retrieve\nthese parameters can improve significantly by adding UV photometry. When\nreddening is considered a free parameter, assuming it can be modeled perfectly,\nour experiments suggest that it can be disentangled from the rest of the\nparameters. This theoretical study indicates that combining broad-band\nphotometry from the UV to the mid-IR allows atmospheric parameters and\ninterstellar extinction to be determined with fair accuracy. The use of UV\npassbands helps substantially to derive metallicities and surface gravities, as\nwell as to break the degeneracy between effective temperature and reddening.\nThe Gaia BP/RP data can disentangle all the parameters, provided the stellar\nSEDs are modeled reasonably well.\n", "  We calculated the dimensionless gyromagnetic ratio (\"$g$-factor\") of\nself-gravitating, uniformly rotating disks of dust with a constant specific\ncharge $\\epsilon$. These disk solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell equations\ndepend on $\\epsilon$ and a \"relativity parameter\" $\\gamma$ ($0<\\gamma\\le 1$) up\nto a scaling parameter. Accordingly, the $g$-factor is a function\n$g=g(\\gamma,\\epsilon)$. The Newtonian limit is characterized by $\\gamma \\ll 1$,\nwhereas $\\gamma\\to 1$ leads to a black-hole limit. The $g$-factor, for all\n$\\epsilon$, approaches the values $g=1$ as $\\gamma\\to 0$ and $g=2$ as\n$\\gamma\\to 1$.\n", "  We study $N=(2,4,8)$ supersymmetric extensions of the three dimensional BMS\nalgebra (BMS$_3$) with most generic possible central extensions. We find that\n$N$-extended supersymmetric BMS$_3$ algebras can be derived by a suitable\ncontraction of two copies of the extended superconformal algebras. Extended\nalgebras from all the consistent contractions are obtained by scaling\nleft-moving and right-moving supersymmetry generators symmetrically, while\nVirasoro and R-symmetry generators are scaled asymmetrically. On the way, we\nfind that the BMS/GCA correspondence does not in general hold for\nsupersymmetric systems. Using the $\\beta$-$\\gamma$ and the ${\\mathfrak\nb}$-${\\mathfrak c}$ systems, we construct free field realisations of all the\nextended super-BMS$_3$ algebras.\n", "  The static properties of the fundamental model for epidemics of diseases\nallowing immunity (susceptible-infected-removed model) are known to be\nderivable by an exact mapping to bond percolation. Yet when performing\nnumerical simulations of these dynamics in a network a number of subtleties\nmust be taken into account in order to correctly estimate the transition point\nand the associated critical properties. We expose these subtleties and identify\nthe different quantities which play the role of criticality detector in the two\ndynamics.\n", "  In mean field approximation, the grand canonical potential of SU(3) Polyakov\nlinear-$\\sigma$ model (PLSM) is analysed for chiral phase-transition,\n$\\sigma_l$ and $\\sigma_s$ and for deconfinement order-parameters, $\\phi$ and\n$\\phi^*$ of light- and strange-quarks, respectively. Various PLSM parameters\nare determined from the assumption of global minimization of the real part of\nthe potential. Then, we have calculated the subtracted condensates\n($\\Delta_{l,s}$). All these results are compared with recent lattice QCD\nsimulations. Accordingly, essential PLSM parameters are determined. The\nmodelling of the relaxation time is utilized in estimating the conductivity\nproperties of the QCD matter in thermal medium, namely electric\n[$\\sigma_{el}(T)$] and heat [$\\kappa(T)$] conductivities. We found that the\nPLSM results on the electric conductivity and on the specific heat agree well\nwith the available lattice QCD calculations. Also, we have calculated bulk and\nshear viscosities normalized to the thermal entropy, $\\xi/s$ and $\\eta/s$,\nrespectively, and compared them with recent lattice QCD. Predictions for $(\\xi\n/s)/(\\sigma_{el}/T)$ and $(\\eta/s)/(\\sigma_{el}/ T)$ are introduced. We\nconclude that our results on various transport properties show some essential\ningredients, that these properties likely come up with, in studying QCD matter\nin thermal and dense medium.\n", "  We study interactions of extremely short three-dimensional bipolar\nelectromagnetic pulses propagating towards each other in an array of\nsemiconductor carbon nanotubes, along any direction perpendicular to their\naxes. The analysis provides a full account of the effects of the nonuniformity\nof the pulses' fields along the axes. The evolution of the electromagnetic\nfield and charge density in the sample is derived from the Maxwell's equations\nand the continuity equation, respectively. In particular, we focus on indirect\ninteraction of the pulses via the action of their fields on the electronic\nsubsystem of the nanotube array. Changes in the shape of pulses in the course\nof their propagation and interaction are analyzed by calculating and\nvisualizing the distribution of the electric field in the system. The numerical\nanalysis reveals a possibility of stable post-collision propagation of pulses\nover distances much greater than their sizes.\n", "  Absolute cross sections for the {\\it K}-shell photoionisation of Be-like\n(O$^{4+}$) and Li-like (O$^{5+}$) atomic oxygen ions were measured for the\nfirst time (in their respective {\\it K}-shell regions) by employing the\nion-photon merged-beam technique at the SOLEIL synchrotron-radiation facility\nin Saint-Aubin, France. High-resolution spectroscopy with E/$\\Delta$E $\\approx$\n3200 ($\\approx$ 170 meV, FWHM)was achieved with photon energy from 550 eV up to\n670 eV. Rich resonance structure observed in the experimental spectra is\nanalysed using the R-matrix with pseudo-states (RMPS) method. Results are also\ncompared with the screening constant by unit nuclear charge (SCUNC)\ncalculations. We characterise and identify the strong $\\rm 1s \\rightarrow 2p$\nresonances for both ions and the weaker $\\rm 1s \\rightarrow np$ resonances ($ n\n\\ge 3$) observed in the {\\it K}-shell spectra of O$^{4+}$.\n", "  We give an exhaustive characterization of the complex saddle point\nconfigurations of the Gross-Witten-Wadia matrix model in the large-N limit. In\nparticular, we characterize the cases in which the saddles accumulate in one,\ntwo, or three arcs, in terms of the values of the coupling constant and of the\nfraction of the total unit density that is supported in one of the arcs, and\nderive an explicit condition for gap closing associated to nonvacuum saddles.\nBy applying the idea of large-N instanton we also give direct analytic\nderivations of the weak-coupling and strong-coupling instanton actions.\n", "  Interferometers measure a wide variety of dynamic processes by converting a\nphase change into an intensity change. Nonlinear interferometers, making use of\nnonlinear media in lieu of beamsplitters, promise substantial improvement in\nthe quest to reach the ultimate sensitivity limits. Here we demonstrate a new\nnonlinear interferometer utilizing a single parametric amplifier for mode\nmixing---conceptually, a nonlinear version of the conventional Michelson\ninterferometer with its arms collapsed together. We observe up to 99.9\\%\ninterference visibility and find evidence for noise reduction based on\nphase-sensitive gain. Our configuration utilizes fewer components than previous\ndemonstrations and requires no active stabilization, offering new capabilities\nfor practical nonlinear interferometric-based sensors.\n", "  We report the discovery and timing measurements of PSR J1208-6238, a young\nand highly magnetized gamma-ray pulsar, with a spin period of 440 ms. The\npulsar was discovered in gamma-ray photon data from the Fermi Large Area\nTelescope (LAT) during a blind-search survey of unidentified LAT sources,\nrunning on the distributed volunteer computing system Einstein@Home. No radio\npulsations were detected in dedicated follow-up searches with the Parkes radio\ntelescope, with a flux density upper limit at 1369 MHz of 30 $\\mu$Jy. By timing\nthis pulsar's gamma-ray pulsations, we measure its braking index over five\nyears of LAT observations to be $n = 2.598 \\pm 0.001 \\pm 0.1$, where the first\nuncertainty is statistical and the second estimates the bias due to timing\nnoise. Assuming its braking index has been similar since birth, the pulsar has\nan estimated age of around 2,700 yr, making it the youngest pulsar to be found\nin a blind search of gamma-ray data and the youngest known radio-quiet\ngamma-ray pulsar. Despite its young age the pulsar is not associated with any\nknown supernova remnant or pulsar wind nebula. The pulsar's inferred dipolar\nsurface magnetic field strength is $3.8 \\times 10^{13}$ G, almost 90% of the\nquantum-critical level. We investigate some potential physical causes of the\nbraking index deviating from the simple dipole model but find that LAT data\ncovering a longer time interval will be necessary to distinguish between these.\n", "  The correct description of the ionic interaction and stable equilibrium of\nthe simulations of biomolecular structure, dynamics, folding, catalysis, and\nfunction, an accurate model of the monovalent ions is very important. The force\nfield needs to reproduce coincident many properties of ions, like their\nstructure, solvation, and moreover both the interactions of these ions with\neach other in the crystal and in solution and the interactions of ions with\nother molecules. Using a similar strategy employed in the parameterization of\nthe NaCl/epsilon , in this paper, we first propose a force field for the\nPotassium Bromide, the KBr/epsilon. This new model is compared with the\nexperimental values of cristal density and structure for the salt and the\ndensity, the viscosity, the dielectric constant and the solubility in the water\nsolution for a range of concentrations. Next, the transferability, of this new\nmodel KBr/epsilon and the NaCl/epsilon, is verified by creating the KCl/epsilon\nand the NaBr/epsilon models. The strategy is to employ the same parameters\nobtained for the NaCl/epsilon and for the KBr/epsilon force fields. The two new\nmodels derived are also compared with the experimental values for the density,\nthe viscosity, the dielectric constant and the solubility in the water solution\nfor a range of concentrations.\n", "  Humans interact through numerous channels to build and maintain social\nconnections: they meet face-to-face, initiate phone calls or send text\nmessages, and interact via social media. Although it is known that the network\nof physical contacts, for example, is distinct from the network arising from\ncommunication events via phone calls and instant messages, the extent to which\nthese networks differ is not clear. In fact, the network structure of these\nchannels shows large structural variations. Each network of interactions,\nhowever, contains both central and peripheral individuals: central members are\ncharacterized by higher connectivity and can reach a high fraction of the\nnetwork within a low number of connections, contrary to the nodes on the\nperiphery. Here we show that the various channels account for diverse\nrelationships between pairs of individuals and the corresponding interaction\npatterns across channels differ to an extent that hinders the simple reduction\nof social ties to a single layer. Furthemore, the origin and purpose of each\nnetwork also determine the role of their respective central members: highly\nconnected individuals in the person-to-person networks interact with their\nenvironment in a regular manner, while members central in the social\ncommunication networks display irregular behavior with respect to their\nphysical contacts and are more active through rare, social events. These\nresults suggest that due to the inherently different functions of communication\nchannels, each one favors different social behaviors and different strategies\nfor interacting with the environment. Our findings can facilitate the\nunderstanding of the varying roles and impact individuals have on the\npopulation, which can further shed light on the prediction and prevention of\nepidemic outbreaks, or information propagation.\n", "  This article summarizes a variety of physical mechanisms proposed in the\nliterature, which can generate micro- and nanodomains in multicomponent lipid\nbilayers and biomembranes. It mainly focusses on lipid-driven mechanisms that\ndo not involve direct protein-protein interactions. Specifically, it considers\n(i) equilibrium mechanisms based on lipid-lipid phase separation such as\ncritical cluster formation close to critical points, and multiple domain\nformation in curved geometries, (ii) equilibrium mechanisms that stabilize\ntwo-dimensional microemulsions, such as the effect of linactants and the effect\nof curvature-composition coupling in bilayers and monolayers, and (iii)\nnon-equilibrium mechanisms induced by the interaction of a biomembrane with the\ncellular environment, such as membrane recycling and the pinning effects of the\ncytoplasm. Theoretical predictions are discussed together with simulations and\nexperiments. The presentation is guided by the theory of phase transitions and\ncritical phenomena, and the appendix summarizes the mathematical background in\na concise way within the framework of the Ginzburg-Landau theory.\n", "  Disentangling New Physics effects from the Standard Model requires a good\nunderstanding of all pieces that stem from the latter, especially the\nuncertainties that might plague the theoretical estimations within the Standard\nModel. In the light of recent measurements made in the decay of $B\\to\nK^*\\ell^+\\ell^-$, and accompanying possibilities of New Physics effects, we\nre-examine the hadronic uncertainties that come about in this exclusive $b \\to\ns$ transition. We show that it is not trivial to distinguish New Physics\neffects from these hadronic uncertainties and we attempt to quantify the latter\nin its magnitude and kinematic shape from the recent LHCb measurements of the\nangular observables in this decay mode. We also update our fit with the more\nrecent calculations of the form factors combined with the ones computed with\nLattice QCD.\n", "  Continuous solid electrolyte interface (SEI) formation remains the limiting\nfactor of the lifetime of silicon nanoparticles (SiNPs) based negative\nelectrodes. Methods that could provide clear diagnosis of the electrode\ndegradation are of utmost necessity to streamline further developments. We\ndemonstrate that electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) in a scanning\ntransmission electron microscope (STEM) can be used to quickly map SEI\ncomponents and quantify LixSi alloys from single experiments, with resolutions\ndown to 5 nm. Exploiting the low-loss part of the EEL spectrum allowed us to\ncircumvent the degradation phenomena that have so far crippled the application\nof this technique on such beam-sensitive compounds. Our results provide\nunprecedented insight into silicon aging mechanisms in full cell configuration.\nWe observe the morphology of the SEI to be extremely heterogeneous at the\nparticle scale but with clear chemical evolutions with extended cycling coming\nfrom both SEI accumulation and a transition from lithium-rich carbonate-like\ncompounds to lithium-poor ones. Thanks to the retrieval of several results from\na single dataset, we were able to correlate local discrepancies in lithiation\nto the initial crystallinity of silicon as well as to the local SEI chemistry\nand morphology. This study emphasizes how initial heterogeneities in the\npercolating electronic network and the porosity affect SiNPs aggregates along\ncycling. These findings pinpoint the crucial role of an optimized formulation\nin silicon-based thick electrodes.\n", "  This present work is based on our previous publications, which all together\ntrigger our \"Killing spinor programme\". Other significant spinor fields are\ninjected into the scheme and the intricate relations between them and their\nbilinears are constructed here. The web of relations concerning these\nconstructions are presented clearly in a Venn diagram. Particular attention is\ndevoted to the construction of equations satisfied by the homogeneous bilinears\ninduced from Dirac spinors. Contacts with various physics theories are made\nthroughout the text and some of the future directions of the programme are\ndefined.\n", "  When applied to matter and antimatter states, the Pauli master equation (PME)\nmay have two forms: time-symmetric, which is conventional, and\ntime-antisymmetric, which is suggested in the present work. The symmetric and\nantisymmetric forms correspond to symmetric and antisymmetric extensions of\nthermodynamics from matter to antimatter --- this is demonstrated by proving\nthe corresponding H-theorem. The two forms are based on the thermodynamic\nsimilarity of matter and antimatter and differ only in the directions of\nthermodynamic time for matter and antimatter (the same in the time-symmetric\ncase and the opposite in the time-antisymmetric case). We demonstrate that,\nwhile the symmetric form of PME predicts an equi-balance between matter and\nantimatter, the antisymmetric form of PME favours full conversion of antimatter\ninto matter. At this stage, it is impossible to make an experimentally\njustified choice in favour of the symmetric or antisymmetric versions of\nthermodynamics since we have no experience of thermodynamic properties of\nmacroscopic objects made of antimatter, but experiments of this kind may become\npossible in the future.\n", "  Energy levels and radiative rates (A-values) for four types of transitions\n(E1, E2, M1, and M2) are reported for an astrophysically important Mg-like ion\nSi~III, whose emission lines have been observed in a variety of plasmas. For\nthe calculations, well-known and widely-used GRASP code has been adopted, and\nresults are listed for transitions among the 141 levels of the 3$\\ell3\\ell'$\nand 3$\\ell$4$\\ell$ configurations. Experimental energies are available for only\nthe lowest 58 levels but there is no major discrepancy with theoretical\nresults. Similarly, the A-values and lifetimes show a satisfactory agreement\nwith other available results, particularly for strong E1 transitions. Collision\nstrengths are also calculated, with the DARC code, and listed for resonance\ntransitions over a wide energy range, up to 30~Ryd. No similar results are\navailable in the literature for comparisons. However, comparisons are made with\nthe more important parameter, effective collision strength ($\\Upsilon$), for\nwhich recent $R$-matrix results are available for a wide range of transitions,\nand over a large range of temperatures. To determine $\\Upsilon$, resonances\nhave been resolved in a narrow energy mesh, although these are not observed to\nbe as important as for other ions. Unfortunately, large discrepancies in\n$\\Upsilon$ values are noted for about half the transitions. The differences\nincrease with increasing temperature and worsen as the upper level J increases.\nIn most cases the earlier results are overestimated, by up to (almost) two\norders of magnitude, and this conclusion is consistent with the one observed\nearlier for Be-like ions.\n", "  We analyze a method for preparing low-entropy many-body states in isolated\nquantum optical systems of atoms, ions and molecules. Our approach is based\nupon shifting entropy between different regions of a system by spatially\nmodulating the magnitude of the effective Hamiltonian. We conduct two case\nstudies, on a topological spin chain and the spinful fermionic Hubbard model,\nfocusing on the key question: can a \"conformal cooling quench\" remove\nsufficient entropy within experimentally accessible timescales? Finite\ntemperature, time-dependent matrix product state calculations reveal that even\nmoderately sized \"bath\" regions can remove enough energy and entropy density to\nexpose coherent low temperature physics. The protocol is particularly natural\nin systems with long-range interactions such lattice-trapped polar molecules\nand Rydberg dressed atoms where the magnitude of the Hamiltonian scales\ndirectly with the density. To this end, we propose a simple implementation of\nconformal cooling quenches in a dilutely-filled optical lattice, where\nsignatures of quantum magnetism can be observed.\n", "  We study nonlinear sigma model, especially Skyrme model with twist: twisted\nSkyrmion string where twist term, $mkz$, is indicated in vortex solution. To\nadd gravity, we replace $\\eta^{\\mu\\nu}$ in Lagrangian system with a space-time\nmetric tensor, $g^{\\mu\\nu}$, which in view of the time-independence and\ncylindrical symmetry of the assumed vortex solution is taken to be a function\nof $r$ alone. We use ode45 for numerical calculation, i.e. a tool box in Matlab\nto solve coupled Einstein field equations which have ordinary differential\nequations (ODE) form.\n", "  Quantum dots (QDs) are good model systems for fundamental studies of\nmesoscopic transport phenomena using thermoelectric effects because of their\nsmall size, electrostatically tunable properties and thermoelectric response\ncharacteristics that are very sensitive to small thermal biases. Here we\nprovide a review of experimental studies on thermoelectric properties of single\nQDs realized in two-dimensional electron gases, single-walled carbon nanotubes\nand semiconductor nanowires. A key requirement for such experiments is methods\nfor nanoscale thermal biasing. We briefly review the main techniques used in\nthe field, namely, heating of the QD contacts, side heating and top heating,\nand touch upon their relative advantages. The thermoelectric response of a QD\nas a function of gate potential has a characteristic oscillatory behavior with\nthe same period as is observed for conductance peaks. Much of the existing\nliterature focuses on the agreement between experiments and theory,\nparticularly for amplitude and line-shape of the thermovoltage $V_{th}$. A\ngeneral observation is that the widely used single-electron tunneling\napproximation for QDs has limited success in reproducing measured $V_{th}$.\nLandauer-type calculations are often found to describe measurement results\nbetter despite the large electron-electron interactions in QDs. More recently,\nnonlinear thermoelectric effects have moved into the focus of attention and we\noffer a brief overview of experiments done so far. We conclude by discussing\nopen questions and avenues for future work, including the role of asymmetries\nin tunnel- and capacitive couplings in thermoelectric behavior of QDs.\n", "  Hypertemporal visible imaging of an urban lightscape can reveal the phase of\nthe electrical grid granular to individual housing units. In contrast to\nin-situ monitoring or metering, this method offers broad, persistent,\nreal-time, and non-permissive coverage through a single camera sited at an\nurban vantage point. Rapid changes in the phase of individual housing units\nsignal changes in load (e.g., appliances turning on and off), while slower\nbuilding- or neighborhood-level changes can indicate the health of distribution\ntransformers. We demonstrate the concept by observing the 120 Hz flicker of\nlights across a NYC skyline. A liquid crystal shutter driven at 119.75 Hz\ndown-converts the flicker to 0.25 Hz, which is imaged at a 4 Hz cadence by an\ninexpensive CCD camera; the grid phase of each source is determined by analysis\nof its sinusoidal light curve over an imaging \"burst\" of some 25 seconds.\nAnalysis of bursts taken at ~15 minute cadence over several hours demonstrates\nboth the stability and variation of phases of halogen, incandescent, and some\nfluorescent lights. Correlation of such results with ground-truth data will\nvalidate a method that could be applied to better monitor electricity\nconsumption and distribution in both developed and developing cities.\n", "  Commissioning of a large accelerator facility like FRIB needs support from an\nonline beam dynamics model. Considering the new physics challenges of FRIB such\nas modeling of non-axisymmetric superconducting RF cavities and multi-charge\nstate acceleration, there is no readily available online beam tuning code. The\ndesign code of FRIB super-conducting linac, IMPACT-Z, is not suitable for\nonline tuning because of its code design and running speed. Therefore, the Fast\nLinear Accelerator Modeling Engine (FLAME), specifically designed to fulfill\nFRIB's online modeling challenges, is proposed. The physics model of FLAME,\nespecially its novel way of modeling non-axisymmetric superconducting RF\ncavities using a multipole expansion based thin-lens kick model, is discussed\nin detail, and the benchmark results against FRIB design code is presented,\nafter which the software design strategy of FLAME and its execution speed is\npresented.\n", "  We review and update the current status of the observed anomalies in stellar\ncooling and their interpretation in terms of axions and axion like particles.\n", "  The International Axion Observatory (IAXO) is a forth generation axion\nhelioscope designed to detect solar axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) with\na coupling to the photon $g_{a\\gamma}$ down to a few $10^{-12}$ GeV$^{-1}$, 1.5\norders of magnitude beyond the current best astrophysical and experimental\nupper bounds. This range includes parameter values invoked in the context of\nthe observed anomalies in light propagation over astronomical distances and to\nexplain the excessive cooling observed in a number of stellar objects. Here we\nreview the status of the IAXO project and of its potential to probe the most\nphysically motivated regions of the axion/ALPs parameter space.\n", "  To develop an efficient motion-compensated reconstruction technique for\nfree-breathing cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that allows\nhigh-quality images to be reconstructed from multiple undersampled single-shot\nacquisitions. The proposed method is a joint image reconstruction and motion\ncorrection method consisting of several steps, including a non-rigid motion\nextraction and a motion-compensated reconstruction. The reconstruction includes\na denoising with the Beltrami regularization, which offers an ideal compromise\nbetween feature preservation and staircasing reduction. Results were assessed\nin simulation, phantom and volunteer experiments. The proposed joint image\nreconstruction and motion correction method exhibits visible quality\nimprovement over previous methods while reconstructing sharper edges. Moreover,\nwhen the acceleration factor increases, standard methods show blurry results\nwhile the proposed method preserves image quality. The method was applied to\nfree-breathing single-shot cardiac MRI, successfully achieving high image\nquality and higher spatial resolution than conventional segmented methods, with\nthe potential to offer high-quality delayed enhancement scans in challenging\npatients.\n", "  Controlling the emissivity of a thermal emitter has attracted growing\ninterest with a view towards a new generation of thermal emission devices. So\nfar, all demonstrations have involved sustained external electric or thermal\nconsumption to maintain a desired emissivity. Here control over the emissivity\nof a thermal emitter consisting of a phase changing material Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST)\nfilm on top of a metal film is demonstrated. This thermal emitter shows broad\nwavelength-selective spectral emissivity in the mid-infrared. The peak\nemissivity approaches the ideal blackbody maximum and a maximum extinction\nratio of above 10dB is attainable by switching GST between the crystalline and\namorphous phases. By controlling the intermediate phases, the emissivity can be\ncontinuously tuned. This switchable, tunable, wavelength-selective and\nthermally stable thermal emitter will pave the way towards the ultimate control\nof thermal emissivity in the field of fundamental science as well as for\nenergy-harvesting and thermal control applications, including\nthermophotovoltaics, light sources, infrared imaging and radiative coolers.\n", "  A unique set of characteristics are packed in emerging nonvolatile\nreduction-oxidation (redox)-based resistive switching memories (ReRAMs) such as\ntheir underlying stochastic switching processes alongside their intrinsic\nhighly nonlinear current-voltage characteristic, which in addition to known\nnano-fabrication process variation make them a promising candidate for the next\ngeneration of low-cost, low-power, tiny and secure Physically Unclonable\nFunctions (PUFs). This paper takes advantage of this otherwise disadvantageous\nReRAM feature using a combination of novel architectural and peripheral\ncircuitry. We present a physical one-way function, nonlinear resistive Physical\nUnclonable Function (nrPUF), potentially applicable in variety of\ncyber-physical security applications given its performance characteristics. We\nexperimentally verified performance of Valency Change Mechanism (VCM)-based\nReRAM in nano-fabricated crossbar arrays across multiple dies and runs. In\naddition to a massive pool of Challenge-Response Pairs (CRPs), using a\ncombination of experimental and simulation, our proposed PUF shows a\nreliability of 98.67%, a uniqueness of 49.85%, a diffuseness of 49.86%, a\nuniformity of 47.28%, and a bit-aliasing of 47.48%.\n", "  We study the evolution of the Red Sequence (RS) scatter in galaxy clusters\nand groups simultaneously using predictions from our simulations (cosmological\nhydrodynamic + semi-analytical) as well as observational data from the HAWK-I\nCluster Survey (HCS), a sample of galaxy clusters at redshifts $0.8 < z < 1.5$.\nWe analyze the intrinsic scatter of the RS to investigate whether the stellar\nage can be its main effective driver, at the same time assessing the role of\nmetallicity variations in shaping the RS building at around epoch $z\\sim$1 and\nbeyond. To this purpose we rely on various methods to derive the average age\nand age spread from the RS colour scatter of the HCS sample, with the aid of\npopulation synthesis models. The RS scatter predicted by the models at $z< 0.7$\nis found to not depend on the star formation history adopted, whilst at $z>the\ncorrelation found between age and rest-frame colour scatters is quite robust,\nalthough all age scatter estimations ultimately depend on the definition of RS\nas well as on the completeness limits adopted. We find that the age spread of\nRS galaxies predicted by both hydrodynamical simulations and SAM increases with\ncosmic epoch, while the ratio between the age spread and the average age\nremains approximately constant. Both trends are in agreement with observational\nresults from both the HCS and other literature samples.\n", "  Due to the low conductivity of pure water, using an electrolyte is common for\nachieving efficient water electrolysis. In this paper, we have broken through\nthis common sense by using deep-sub-Debye-length nanogap electrochemical cells\nfor the electrolysis of pure water. At such nanometer scale, the field-driven\npure water splitting exhibits a completely different mechanism from the\nmacrosystem. We have named this process 'virtual breakdown mechanism' that\nresults in a series of fundamental changes and more than 10^5-fold enhancement\nof the equivalent conductivity of pure water. This fundamental discovery has\nbeen theoretically discussed in this paper and experimentally demonstrated in a\ngroup of electrochemical cells with nanogaps between two electrodes down to 37\nnm. Based on our nanogap electrochemical cells, the electrolysis current from\npure water is comparable to or even larger than the current from 1 mol/L sodium\nhydroxide solution, indicating the high-efficiency of pure water splitting as a\npotential for on-demand hydrogen production.\n", "  General non-standard $tbW$ couplings are studied as model independently as\npossible based on the effective Lagrangian consisting of the dimension-6\noperators, which is an extension of the standard-model Lagrangian. The\n$tbW$-interaction Lagrangian in this framework includes four kinds of\ncouplings, which could be complex. Constraints on those non-standard $tbW$\ncouplings are obtained by comparing the experimental data related to the $t\\to\nb W$ process with the corresponding theoretical formulas derived from the\neffective Lagrangian. The constraints on some sets of the non-standard\ncouplings are shown not to be so strong because those couplings balance out\neach other as we treat all the non-standard couplings as complex numbers at the\nsame time.\n", "  The optical spectra of fractal multilayer dielectric structures have been\nshown to possess spectral scalability, which has been found to be directly\nrelated to the structure's spatial (geometrical) self-similarity. Phase and\namplitude scaling relations, as well as effects of finite structure size, have\nbeen derived.\n", "  Topological states of matter originate from distinct topological electronic\nstructures of materials. As for strong topological insulators (STIs), the\ntopological surface (interface) is a direct consequence of electronic structure\ntransition between materials categorized to different topological genus.\nTherefore, it is fundamentally interesting if such topological character can be\nmanipulated. Besides tuning the crystal field and the strength of spin-orbital\ncoupling (e.g., by external strain, or chemical doping), there is currently\nrare report on topological state induced in ordinary insulators (OIs) by the\nheterostructure of OI/STI. Here we report the observation of a Dirac cone\ntopological surface state (TSS) induced on the Sb2Se3 layer up to 15 nm thick\nin the OI/STI heterostructure, in sharp contrast with the OI/OI heterostructure\nwhere no sign of TSS can be observed. This is evident for an induced\ntopological state in an OI by heterostructure.\n", "  Sensing static or slowly varying magnetic fields with high sensitivity and\nspatial resolution is critical to many applications in fundamental physics,\nbioimaging and materials science. Several versatile magnetometry platforms have\nemerged over the past decade, such as electronic spins associated with Nitrogen\nVacancy (NV) centers in diamond. However, their high sensitivity to external\nfields also makes them poor sensors of DC fields. Indeed, the usual method of\nRamsey magnetometry leaves them prone to environmental noise, limiting the\nallowable interrogation time to the short dephasing time T2*. Here we introduce\na hybridized magnetometery platform, consisting of a sensor and ancilla, that\nallows sensing static magnetic fields with interrogation times up to the much\nlonger T2 coherence time, allowing significant potential gains in field\nsensitivity. While more generally applicable, we demonstrate the method for an\nelectronic NV sensor and a nuclear ancilla. It relies on frequency upconversion\nof transverse DC fields through the ancilla, allowing quantum lock-in detection\nwith low-frequency noise rejection. In our experiments, we demonstrate\nsensitivities better than 6uT/vHz, comparable to the Ramsey method, and\nnarrow-band signal noise filtering better than 64kHz. With technical\noptimization, we expect more than an one order of magnitude improvement in each\nof these parameters. Since our method measures transverse fields, in\ncombination with the Ramsey detection of longitudinal fields, it ushers in a\ncompelling technique for sensitive vector DC magnetometry at the nanoscale.\n", "  In correlated electrons system, quantum melting of electronic crystalline\nphase often gives rise to many novel electronic phases. In cuprates\nsuperconductors, melting the Mott insulating phase with carrier doping leads to\na quantum version of liquid crystal phase, the electronic nematicity, which\nbreaks the rotational symmetry and exhibits a tight twist with high-temperature\nsuperconductivity. Recently, the electronic nematicity has also been observed\nin Fe-based superconductors. However, whether it shares a similar scenario with\nits cuprates counterpart is still elusive. Here, by measuring nuclear magnetic\nresonance in CsFe2As2, a prototypical Fe-based superconductor perceived to have\nevolved from a Mott insulating phase at 3d5 configuration, we report\nanisotropic quadruple broadening effect as a direct result of local rotational\nsymmetry breaking. For the first time, clear connection between the Mott\ninsulating phase and the electronic nematicity can be established and\ngeneralized to the Fe-based superconductors. This finding would promote a\nuniversal understanding on electronic nematicity and its relation with\nhigh-temperature superconductivity.\n", "  Dipolar coupling in crystals of the Mn$_{12}$Ac molecular magnet elongated\nalong the anisotropy axis favors ferromagnetic ordering below the mean-field\nCurie temperature 0.71 K. With the help of Monte Carlo on crystals of up to one\nmillion Mn$_{12}$ molecules, it is shown that ordering occurs at 0.36 K. The\nresulting state is split into ferromagnetic domains with domain walls\npreferring the diagonal orientation. Domain walls are pinned by the lattice at\nlow temperatures. Making the crystal shorter makes domains finer and smoothens\nout the singularity at the transition, decreasing susceptibility in the domain\nstate. Hysteresis loops look ferromagnetic for prolate crystals and\nantiferromagnetic for oblate crystals.\n", "  Nonlinear acoustic interactions in liquids are effectively stronger than\nnonlinear optical interactions in solids. Thus, harnessing these interactions\nwill offer new possibilities in the design of ultra-compact nonlinear photonic\ndevices. We theoretically demonstrate a hybrid, liquid-state and nanoplasmonic,\nsource of optical frequency combs compatible with fibre-optic technology. This\nsource relies on a nanoantenna to harness the strength of nonlinear acoustic\neffects and synthesise optical spectra from ultrasound.\n", "  Galactic globular clusters are not simple stellar populations. And nothing is\nsimple in their study, basically because we try to reconstruct chains of events\nthat occurred at redshift z > 2-3 by observing these objects at z=0, after a\nHubble time. Fortunately, spectroscopy offers a magnifying lens: differences of\ntens or hundreds of Myrs between stellar generations are translated into\ndifferences in abundances up to a full dex. I will review the complex pattern\nemerging by the combined efforts of different groups, focusing on the chemical\nsignatures of multiple populations in globular clusters.\n", "  We aim at combining high coercivity magnetic nanowires in a polymer matrix in\na view to fabricate rare--earth free bonded magnets. In particular, our aim is\nto fabricate anisotropic materials by aligning the wires in the polymer matrix.\nWe have explored the different parameters of the fabrication process in order\nto produce a material with the best possible magnetic properties. We show that\nthe choice of a proper solvent allows obtaining stable nanowire suspensions.\nThe length and the type of the polymer chains play also an important role.\nSmaller chains ($M_w < 10000$) provide better magnetization results. The\nmagnetic field applied during the casting of the material plays also a role and\nshould be of the order of a fraction of a tesla. The local order of the\nnanowires in the matrix has been characterized by TEM and Small Angle Neutron\nScattering. The correlation between the local order of the wires and the\nmagnetic properties is discussed. Materials with coercivity $\\mu_0 H_c$ up to\n0.70 $T$ at room temperature have been obtained.\n", "  Porphyrinic materials show a range of interesting and useful optical and\nelectrical properties. The less well-known sub-class of porphyrin diacids has\nbeen used in this work to construct an ionic hybrid organic-inorganic material\nin combination with a halogenidometalate anion. The resulting compound,\n$[H_6TPyP][BiCl_6]_2$ (1) (TPyP = tetra(4-pyridyl)porphyrin) has been obtained\nvia a facile solution based synthesis in single crystalline form. The material\nexhibits a broad photoluminescence emission band between 650 and 850 nm at room\ntemperature. Single crystals of $[H_6TPyP][BiCl_6]_2$ show a photocurrent in\nthe fA and a much higher dark current in the nA range. They also display an\nunexpected reversible color change upon wetting with different liquids. This\nphenomenon has been investigated with optical spectroscopy, SEM, XPS and NEXAFS\ntechniques, showing that a surface-based structural coloration effect is the\nsource of the color change. This stands in contrast to other materials where\nstructural coloration typically has to be introduced through elaborate,\nmulti-step processes or the use of natural templates. Additionally, it\nunderscores the potential of self-assembly of porphyrinic hybrid compounds in\nthe fabrication of materials with unusual optical properties.\n", "  In the present work we develop a Monte Carlo algorithm of the carbon chains\nordered into 2D hexagonal array. The chemical bond of the chained carbon is\ncomputed from 1K to 1300K. Our model confirms that the beta phase is more\nenergetic preferable at low temperatures but the system prefers the alpha phase\nat high temperatures. Based on the thermal effect on the bond distributions and\n3D atomic vibrations in the carbon chains, the bond softening temperature is\nobserved at 500K. The bond softening temperature is higher in the presence of\ninterstitial doping but it does not change with the length of nanowire. The\nelastic modulus of the carbon chains is 1.7TPa at 5K and the thermal expansion\nis +7 x 10-5 K-1 at 300K via monitoring the collective atomic vibrations and\nbond distributions. Thermal fluctuation in terms of heat capacity as a function\nof temperatures is computed in order to study the phase transition across\nmelting point. The heat capacity anomaly initiates around 3800K.\n", "  Inertical Confinement Fusion configuration model is analized for direct\nignition without an ablator. The compression of the target pellet is neglected\nand rapid volume ignition is achieved by a laser pulse, which is as short as\nthe penetraton time of the light across the pellet. The reflectivity of the\ntarget is assumed to be negligible, and the absorptivity is constant so that\nthe light pulse can reach the opposite side of the pellet. The necessary pulse\nlength and pulse strength is calculated.\n", "  In this work two soft computing methods, Artificial Neural Networks and\nGenetic Programming, are proposed in order to forecast the mean temperature\nthat will occur in future seasons. The area in which the soft computing\ntechniques were applied is that of the surroundings of the town of Benevento,\nin the south of Italy, having geographic coordinates (lat. 41{\\deg}07'50\"N;\nlong.14{\\deg}47'13\"E). This area is not affected by maritime influences as well\nas by winds coming from the west. The methods are fed by data recorded in the\nmeteorological stations of Benevento and Castelvenere, located in the hilly\narea, which characterizes the territory surrounding this city, at 144 m a.s.l.\nBoth the applied methods show low error rates, while the Genetic Programming\noffers an explicit rule representation (a formula) explaining the prevision.\n  Keywords Seasonal Temperature Forecasting; Soft Computing; Artificial Neural\nNetworks; Genetic Programming; Southern Italy.\n", "  The interaction between coherent polaritons and incoherent excitons plays an\nimportant role in polariton physics. Using resonant pump-probe spectroscopy\nwith selective excitation of single polariton branches, we investigate the\ndifferent dephasing mechanisms responsible for generating a long-lived exciton\nreservoir. As expected, pumping the upper polariton results in a strong\ndephasing process that leads to the generation of a long lived reservoir.\nUnexpectedly, we observe an efficient reservoir creation while exciting only\nthe lower polariton branch when the detuning is increased towards positive\ndetuning. We propose a simple theoretical model, the polaritonic Bloch\nequations, to describe the dynamics of the system.\n", "  Multipartite entangled states are a fundamental resource for a wide range of\nquantum information processing tasks. In particular, in quantum networks it is\nessential for the parties involved to be able to verify if entanglement is\npresent before they carry out a given distributed task. Here we design and\nexperimentally demonstrate a protocol that allows any party in a network to\ncheck if a source is distributing a genuinely multipartite entangled state,\neven in the presence of untrusted parties. The protocol remains secure against\ndishonest behaviour of the source and other parties, including the use of\nsystem imperfections to their advantage. We demonstrate the verification\nprotocol in a three- and four-party setting using polarization-entangled\nphotons, highlighting its potential for realistic photonic quantum\ncommunication and networking applications.\n", "  We present an easy drop-casting based functionalization of MoS2-based\nphotodetectors that results in an enhancement of the photoresponse of about\nfour orders of magnitude, reaching responsivities up to 100 A/W. The\nfunctionalization is technologically trivial, air-stable, fully reversible and\nreproducible, and opens the door to the combination of 2D-materials with\nmolecular dyes for the development of high performance photodetectors.\n", "  Planar channeling of 855 MeV electrons and positrons in straight and bent\ntungsten (110) crystal is simulated by means of the \\MBNExplorer software\npackage. The results of simulations for a broad range of bending radii are\nanalyzed in terms of the channel acceptance, dechanneling length, and spectral\ndistribution of the emitted radiation. Comparison of the results with\npredictions of other theories as well as with the data for (110) oriented\ndiamond, silicon and germanium crystals is carried out.\n", "  We study the mixed effect of QCD and QED corrections to the evolution of\nparton distribution functions (PDFs). The Altarelli-Parisi splitting functions\nare extended to one order higher in QED, reaching ${\\cal O}(\\alpha \\,\n\\alpha_S^2)$ accuracy. This also involves extending DGLAP equations to include\ncharge separation effects, that are ignored for pure QCD corrections. Besides\nthat, these effects are crucial for the determination of the photon\ndistribution, which plays an increasingly important role in nowadays\nphenomenological analysis.\n", "  We evaluate the so-called Bose-ghost propagator Q(p^2) for SU(2) gauge theory\nin minimal Landau gauge, considering lattice volumes up to 120^4 and physical\nlattice extents up to 13.5 f. In particular, we investigate discretization\neffects, as well as the infinite-volume and continuum limits. We recall that a\nnonzero value for this quantity provides direct evidence of BRST-symmetry\nbreaking, related to the restriction of the functional measure to the first\nGribov region. Our results show that the prediction (from cluster\ndecomposition) for Q(p^2) in terms of gluon and ghost propagators is better\nsatisfied as the continuum limit is approached.\n", "  A study has been made of the evidence for gender-related systematics in the\nproposal review processes for the four facilities operated by NRAO: the Jansky\nVery Large Array (JVLA; hereafter VLA), the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA),\nthe Green Bank Telescope (GBT) and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter\nArray (ALMA) in Chile which is operated by NRAO/AUI in partnership with the\nEuropean Southern Observatory (ESO) and the National Astronomical Observatories\nof Japan (NAOJ), in cooperation with the Republic of Chile. A significant\ngender-related effect is found in the proposal rankings in favor of men over\nwomen in the ALMA Proposal Review Processes (PRP) for ALMA Cycles 2-4, with\nreliability of 99.998% that the underlying rank distributions for male and\nfemale PIs are not the same. The effect is largest and most significant for\nALMA Cycle 3. A similar overall result is found for the other three NRAO\ntelescopes over proposal Semesters 2012A-2017A, but with lower reliability\nlevel overall (98.3%), and with some reversals across semesters in the trend\nfor better performance in the rankings for male PIs. The results align with\nsimilar studies recently completed for the HST (Reid 2014) and the ESO proposal\nreview processes (Patat 2016). No correlations are found between the\ngender-related proposal ranking trends and the gender fractions on review\npanels. The HST and ESO proposal reviews have come to different conclusions\nfrom each other on the role of seniority on the gender-related proposal\noutcomes at those observatories. The currently available data for the ALMA and\nNRAO user base do not allow us to investigate the important question of the\ndependence on the gender-related trends of the seniority of the principal\ninvestigators.\n", "  In this survey, we review recent results concerning the canonical dispersive\nflow $e^{itH}$ led by a Schr\\\"odinger Hamiltonian $H$. We study, in particular,\nhow the time decay of space $L^p$-norms depends on the frequency localization\nof the initial datum with respect to the some suitable spherical expansion. A\nquite complete description of the phenomenon is given in terms of the\neigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the restriction of $H$ to the unit sphere,\nand a comparison with some uncertainty inequality is presented.\n", "  We discuss two theoretical motivations of precision measurements of\noscillation parameters. One is the guidance for flavour model building with\nflavour symmetries, and the other is the connection with the origin of\nmatter-antimatter asymmetry. We also present our recent progress in these\naspects, a new approach of flavour model building based on cross coupling in\nthe flavon potential and a novel mechanism of leptogenesis via phase\ntransition.\n", "  This paper is concerned with the analysis of vaccination strategies in a\nstochastic SIR (susceptible $\\to$ infected $\\to$ removed) model for the spread\nof an epidemic amongst a population of individuals with a random network of\nsocial contacts that is also partitioned into households. Under various vaccine\naction models, we consider both household-based vaccination schemes, in which\nthe way in which individuals are chosen for vaccination depends on the size of\nthe households in which they reside, and acquaintance vaccination, which\ntargets individuals of high degree in the social network. For both types of\nvaccination scheme, assuming a large population with few initial infectives, we\nderive a threshold parameter which determines whether or not a large outbreak\ncan occur and also the probability and fraction of the population infected by\nsuch an outbreak. The performance of these schemes is studied numerically,\nfocusing on the influence of the household size distribution and the degree\ndistribution of the social network. We find that acquaintance vaccination can\nsignificantly outperform the best household-based scheme if the degree\ndistribution of the social network is heavy-tailed. For household-based\nschemes, when the vaccine coverage is insufficient to prevent a major outbreak\nand the vaccine is imperfect, we find situations in which both the probability\nand size of a major outbreak under the scheme which minimises the threshold\nparameter are \\emph{larger} than in the scheme which maximises the threshold\nparameter.\n", "  We consider the Cauchy problems associated with semirelativistc NLS (sNLS)\nand half wave (HW). In particular we focus on the following two main questions:\nlocal/global Cauchy theory; existence and stability/instability of ground\nstates. In between other results, we prove the existence and stability of\nground states for sNLS in the $L^2$ supercritical regime. This is in sharp\ncontrast with the instability of ground states for the corresponding HW, which\nis also established along the paper, by showing an inflation of norms\nphenomenon. Concerning the Cauchy theory we show, under radial symmetry\nassumption the following results: a local existence result in $H^1$ for energy\nsubcritical nonlinearity and a global existence result in the $L^2$ subcritical\nregime.\n", "  In this talk, we review the basis of the loop-tree duality theorem, which\nallows to rewrite loop scattering amplitudes in terms of tree-level like\nobjects. Since the loop measure is converted into a phase-space one, both\nvirtual and real contributions are expressible using the same integration\nvariables. A physically motivated momentum mapping allows to generate the real\nemission process starting from the Born kinematics and the loop momenta. The\nintegrand-level combination leads to regular functions, which can be integrated\nwithout using dimensional regularization (DREG) and correctly reproduce the\nfinite higher-order corrections to physical observables. We explain the\nimplementation of this novel approach to compute some benchmark physical\nprocesses, and we show how to deal with both infrared and ultraviolet\ndivergences in four space-time dimensions.\n", "  This work presents an experimental design for studying low-velocity\ncollisions into granular surfaces in low-gravity. In the experiment apparatus,\nreduced-gravity is simulated by releasing a free-falling projectile into a\nsurface container with a downward acceleration less than that of Earth's\ngravity. The acceleration of the surface is controlled through the use of an\nAtwood machine, or a system of pulleys and counterweights. The starting height\nof the surface container and the initial separation distance between the\nprojectile and surface are variable and chosen to accommodate collision\nvelocities up to 20 cm/s and effective accelerations of ~0.1 - 1.0 m/s^2.\nAccelerometers, placed on the surface container and inside the projectile,\nprovide acceleration data, while high-speed cameras capture the collision and\nact as secondary data sources. The experiment is built into an existing 5.5 m\ndrop-tower frame and requires the custom design of all components, including\nthe projectile, surface sample container, release mechanism and deceleration\nsystem. Data from calibration tests verify the efficiency of the experiment's\ndeceleration system and provide a quantitative understanding of the performance\nof the Atwood system.\n", "  We review the recent developments of analytic solutions in transverse\nmagneto-hydrodynamics under Bjorken expansion. It is found that the time\ndependence of magnetic fields can either increase or reduce the energy density\ndepending on the decay exponent of magnetic fields. Moreover, perturbative\nsolutions under weak magnetic fields with spatial inhomogeneity results in\ntransverse flow, where the directions of flow also depend on the decay exponent\nof magnetic fields in time.\n", "  The production of single top quarks is a cornerstone in understanding the\nnature of the heaviest known elementary particle and its involvement in\nelectroweak interactions. An early differential cross section measurement of\nt-channel single-top-quark production is presented. Proton-Proton collision\ndata at a center-of-mass energy of $13~\\mathrm{TeV}$ collected in 2015 were\nanalyzed, corresponding to $2.3~\\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$. The amount of signal events\nas a function of the top quark transverse momentum and rapidity is estimated\nusing a multivariate discriminant. The results are unfolded to parton level and\ncompared to predictions by various Monte-Carlo generators.\n", "  In 1982, Alain Aspect, and collaborators performed an experiment, in order to\nobserve the violation of the inequality of Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt. After\nthe experiment, they used the data in the inequality and concluded that the\ninequality, obtained through probabilistic arguments, was violated confirming\nthe conclusions obtained by John S. Bell that was not possible a theory of\nhidden variables in the conditions suggested by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen.\nThe aim of this work is to verify the validity of the inequalities in the\nconditions of the probabilistic theory, in order to hold with the axioms of the\nprobability.\n", "  Precise measurements of the branching ratios for the $K\\to\\pi\\nu\\bar{\\nu}$\ndecays can provide unique constraints on CKM unitarity and, potentially,\nevidence for new physics. It is important to measure both decay modes,\n$K^+\\to\\pi^+\\nu\\bar{\\nu}$ and $K_L\\to\\pi^0\\nu\\bar{\\nu}$, since different new\nphysics models affect the rates for each channel differently. We are\ninvestigating the feasibility of performing a measurement of\nBR($K_L\\to\\pi^0\\nu\\bar{\\nu}$) using a high-energy secondary neutral beam at the\nCERN SPS in a successor experiment to NA62. The planned experiment would reuse\nsome of the NA62 infrastructure, including possibly the NA48 liquid-krypton\ncalorimeter. The mean momentum of $K_L$ mesons decaying in the fiducial volume\nis 70 GeV; the decay products are boosted forward, so that less demanding\nperformance is required from the large-angle photon veto detectors. On the\nother hand, the layout poses particular challenges for the design of the\nsmall-angle vetoes, which must reject photons from $K_L$ decays escaping\nthrough the beam pipe amidst an intense background from soft photons and\nneutrons in the beam. We present some preliminary conclusions from our\nfeasibility studies, summarizing the design challenges faced and the\nsensitivity obtainable for the measurement of BR($K_L\\to\\pi^0\\nu\\bar{\\nu}$).\n", "  A cooled scanning probe microscope (SPM) has been used to image cyclotron\norbits of electrons through high-mobility graphene in a magnetic field.1-5 In a\nhBN-graphene-hBN device patterned into a hall bar geometry, the magnetic field\nfocuses a current Ii injected from one narrow contact into another narrow\ncontact located an integer number of cyclotron diameters away, creating a\nvoltage Vc. The degree of focusing is measured by the transresistance Rm =\nVc/Ii. In SPM, the tip can either enhance or decrease conductance in the sample\nby deflecting electrons into or away from the second contact, respectively.3,4\nOur SPM images of magnetic focusing feature a region in which the tip\ntransitions from enhancing to decreasing the conductance in the sample where\nthe change in transresistance caused by the tip is equal to zero. In this\npaper, we investigate how the location of this region in the graphene sample\nchanges as we modulate the electron density n and magnetic field B. By plotting\nline-cuts of the change in trans-resistance for different electron densities\nand magnetic fields, we identify trends in the inflection point where the tip\nchanges from enhancing to decreasing the conductance in the sample. From the\nlocation of each transition region, we show that the cyclotron diameter of the\nelectron trajectories can be obtained, and explain the trends in inflection\npoint location for different electron densities and magnetic fields.\n", "  We recall the perturbation expansion for Michaelis-Menten kinetics, beyond\nthe standard quasi-steady-state approximation (sQSSA). Against this background,\nwe are able to appropriately apply the alternative approach to the study of\nsingularly perturbed differential equations that is based on the\nrenormalization group (SPDERG), by clarifying similarities and differences. In\nthe present demanding situation, we directly renormalize the bare initial\ncondition value for the substrate. Our main results are: i) the 2nd order\nSPDERG uniform approximations to the correct solutions contain, up to 1st\norder, the same outer components as the known perturbation expansion ones; ii)\nthe differential equation to be solved for the derivation of the 1st order\nouter substrate component is simpler within the SPDERG approach; iii) the\napproximations better reproduce the numerical solutions of the original problem\nin a region encompassing the matching one, because of the 2nd order terms in\nthe inner components, calculated here for the first time to our knowledge: iv)\nthe refined SPDERG uniform approximations, that we propose, give the correct\nasymptotically vanishing solutions, too, and allow to obtain results nearly\nindistinguishable from the solutions of the original problem in a large part of\nthe whole relevant time window, even in the studied unfavourable kinetic\nconstant case, for an expansion parameter value as large as {\\epsilon} = 0.5.\n", "  Using N-body simulations we study the structures induced on a galactic disc\nby repeated flybys of a companion in decaying eccentric orbit around the disc.\nOur system is composed by a stellar disc, bulge and live dark matter halo, and\nwe study the system's dynamical response to a sequence of a companion's flybys,\nwhen we vary i) the disc's temperature (parameterized by Toomre's Q-parameter)\nand ii) the companion's mass and initial orbit. We use a new 3D Cartesian grid\ncode: MAIN (Mesh-adaptive Approximate Inverse N-body solver). The main features\nof MAIN are reviewed, with emphasis on the use of a new Symmetric Factored\nApproximate Sparse Inverse (SFASI) matrix in conjunction with the multigrid\nmethod that allows the efficient solution of Poisson's equation in three space\nvariables. We find that: i) companions need to be assigned initial masses in a\nrather narrow window of values in order to produce significant and more\nlong-standing non-axisymmetric structures (bars and spirals) in the main\ngalaxy's disc by the repeated flyby mechanism. ii) a crucial phenomenon is the\nantagonism between companion-excited and self-excited modes on the disc. Values\nof $Q >1.5$ are needed in order to allow for the growth of the\ncompanion-excited modes to prevail over the the growth of the disc's\nself-excited modes. iii) We give evidence that the companion-induced spiral\nstructure is best represented by a density wave with pattern speed nearly\nconstant in a region extending from the ILR to a radius close to, but inside,\ncorotation.\n", "  In tin dioxide nanostructures, oxygen vacancies (OVs) play an important role\nin their optical properties and thus regulation of both OV concentration and\ntype via external strain is crucial to exploration of more applications.\nFirst-principle calculations of SnO2 (110) surface disclose that asymmetric\ndeformations induced by external strain not only lead to its intrinsic surface\nelastic changes, but also result in different OV formation energy. In the\nabsence of external strain, the energetically favorable oxygen vacancies (EFOV)\nappear in the bridging site of second layer. When -3.5% external strain is\napplied along y direction, the EFOV moves into plane site. This can be ascribed\nthat the compressed deformation gives rise to redistribution of electronic wave\nfunction near OVs, therefore, formation of newly bond structures. Our results\nsuggest that different type OVs in SnO2 surface can be controlled by strain\nengineering.\n", "  BRITE-Constellation has obtained data for a few delta Scuti and gamma Doradus\ntype stars. A short overview of the pulsational content found in five stars -\nbeta Cassiopeiae, epsilon Cephei, M Velorum, beta Pictoris and QW Puppis - is\ngiven and the potential of BRITE-Constellation observations of delta Scuti and\ngamma Doradus pulsators is discussed.\n", "  The gamma Doradus star 43 Cygni was observed by BRITE-Toronto for 156 days in\n2015. From this data set we identified 37 pulsation frequencies which show a\nregular period spacing pattern that will be subject of a more detailed\nasteroseismic analysis.\n", "  Magnesium and its alloys are intriguing as possible biodegradable\nbiomaterials due to their unique combination of biodegradability and high\nspecific mechanical properties. However, uncontrolled biodegradation of\nmagnesium during implantation remains a major challenge in spite of the use of\nalloying and protective coatings. In this study, a hybrid composite structure\nof magnesium metal and a biopolymer was fabricated as an alternative approach\nto control the corrosion rate of magnesium. A multistep process that combines\nmetal foam production and injection molding was developed to create a hybrid\ncomposite structure that is topologically ordered in all three dimensions.\nPreliminary investigations of the mechanical properties and corrosion behavior\nexhibited by the hybrid Mg-polymer composite structures suggest a new potential\napproach to the development of Mg-based biomedical devices.\n", "  The event-by-event Monte Carlo code, TREKIS, was recently developed to\ndescribe excitation of the electron subsystems of solids in the nanometric\nvicinity of a trajectory of a nonrelativistic swift heavy ion (SHI) decelerated\nin the electronic stopping regime. The complex dielectric function (CDF)\nformalism was applied in the used cross sections to account for collective\nresponse of a matter to excitation. Using this model we investigate effects of\nthe basic assumptions on the modeled kinetics of the electronic subsystem which\nultimately determine parameters of an excited material in an SHI track. In\nparticular, (a) effects of different momentum dependencies of the CDF on\nscattering of projectiles on the electron subsystem are investigated. The\n'effective one-band' approximation for target electrons produces good\ncoincidence of the calculated electron mean free paths with those obtained in\nexperiments in metals. (b) Effects of collective response of a lattice appeared\nto dominate in randomization of electron motion. We study how sensitive these\neffects are to the target temperature. We also compare results of applications\nof different model forms of (quasi-) elastic cross sections in simulations of\nthe ion track kinetics, e.g. those calculated taking into account optical\nphonons in the CDF form vs. Mott's atomic cross sections. (c) It is\ndemonstrated that the kinetics of valence holes significantly affects\nredistribution of the excess electronic energy in the vicinity of an SHI\ntrajectory as well as its conversion into lattice excitation in dielectrics and\nsemiconductors. (d) It is also shown that induced transport of photons\noriginated from radiative decay of core holes brings the excess energy faster\nand farther away from the track core, however, the amount of this energy is\nrelatively small.\n", "  This talk reviews our recent work showing how tiny black holes can act as\nnucleation sites for the decay of the metastable Higgs vacuum. We start by\ndiscussing the formation of thin wall bubbles of true vacuum inside a false\nvacuum, and show how adding a black hole lowers the action of the Euclidean\ntunneling solution, thus strongly enhancing the probability of vacuum decay. We\nthen review numerical results for the Higgs vacuum showing that the decay rate\nis even higher for these \"thick wall\" bubbles. The results imply either tiny\nblack holes are not a component of our universe, or BSM corrections to the\nHiggs potential must stabilise our vacuum.\n", "  We present the results of the study of the red nova PSN J14021678+5426205\nbased on the observations carried out with the Russian 6-m telescope (BTA)\nalong with other telescopes of SAO RAS and SAI MSU. To investigate the nova\nprogenitor, we used the data from the Digital Sky Survey and amateur photos\navailable on the internet. In the period between April 1993 and July 2014, the\nbrightness of the progenitor gradually increased by 2.2 mag in the V band. At\nthe peak of the first outburst in mid-November of 2014, the star reached an\nabsolute visual magnitude of -12.75 mag but was discovered later, in February\n2015, in a repeated outburst at the absolute magnitude of -11.65 mag. The\namplitude of the outburst was minimum among the red novae, only 5.6 mag in the\nV band. The H alpha emission line and the continuum of a cool supergiant with a\ngradually decreasing surface temperature were observed in the spectra. Such\nprocess is typical for red novae, although the object under study showed\nextreme parameters: maximum luminosity, maximum outburst duration, minimum\noutburst amplitude, unusual shape of the light curve. This event is interpreted\nas a massive OB star system components merging accompanied by the formation of\na common envelope and then the expansion of this envelope with minimal energy\nlosses.\n", "  We show that decoupled hidden sectors can have observational consequences. As\na representative model example, we study dark matter production in the Higgs\nportal model with one real singlet scalar $s$ coupled to the Standard Model\nHiggs via $\\lambda_{\\rm hs}\\Phi^\\dagger\\Phi s^2$ and demonstrate how the\ncombination of non-observation of cosmological isocurvature perturbations and\nastrophysical limits on dark matter self-interactions imply stringent bounds on\nthe magnitude of the scalar self-coupling $\\lambda_{\\rm s}s^4$. For example,\nfor dark matter mass $m_{\\rm s}=10$ MeV and Hubble scale during cosmic\ninflation $H_*=10^{12}$ GeV, we find $10^{-4}\\lesssim \\lambda_{\\rm s}\\lesssim\n0.2$.\n", "  Understanding the nature of the interface between a biomaterial implant and\nthe biological fluid is an essential step towards creating improved implant\nmaterials. This study examined a diamond-like carbon coating biomaterial, the\nsurface energy of which was modified by Ar+ ion sputtering and laser\ngraphitisation. The arrangement of proteins was analysed by angle resolved\nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and the effects of the polar component of\nsurface energy on this arrangement were observed. It was seen that polar groups\n(such as CN, CO) are more attracted to the coating surface due to the stronger\npolar interactions. This results in a segregation of these groups to the\nDLC-protein interface; at increasing takeoff angle (further from to DLC-protein\ninterface) fewer of these polar groups are seen. Correspondingly, groups that\ninteract mainly by dispersive forces (CC, CH) were found to increase in\nintensity as takeoff angle increased, indicating they are segregated away from\nthe DLC-protein interface. The magnitude of the segregation was seen to\nincrease with increasing polar surface energy, this was attributed to an\nincreased net attraction between the solid surface and polar groups at higher\npolar surface energy.\n", "  Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) have recently become a valuable computing\ntool for the acquisition of data at high rates and for a relatively low cost.\nThe devices work by parallelizing the code into thousands of threads, each\nexecuting a simple process, such as identifying pulses from a waveform\ndigitizer. The CUDA programming library can be used to effectively write code\nto parallelize such tasks on Nvidia GPUs, providing a significant upgrade in\nperformance over CPU based acquisition systems.\n  The muon $g$-$2$ experiment at Fermilab is heavily relying on GPUs to process\nits data. The data acquisition system for this experiment must have the ability\nto create deadtime-free records from 700 $\\mu$s muon spills at a raw data rate\n18 GB per second. Data will be collected using 1296 channels of $\\mu$TCA-based\n800 MSPS, 12 bit waveform digitizers and processed in a layered array of\nnetworked commodity processors with 24 GPUs working in parallel to perform a\nfast recording of the muon decays during the spill. The described data\nacquisition system is currently being constructed, and will be fully\noperational before the start of the experiment in 2017.\n", "  We prove asymptotic results for 2-dimensional random matching problems. In\nparticular, we obtain the leading term in the asymptotic expansion of the\nexpected quadratic transportation cost for empirical measures of two samples of\nindependent uniform random variables in the square. Our technique is based on a\nrigorous formulation of the challenging PDE ansatz by S.\\ Caracciolo et al.\\\n(Phys. Rev. E, {\\bf 90} 012118, 2014) that \"linearise\" the Monge-Amp\\`ere\nequation.\n", "  A new measurement of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, $a_{\\mu}\n\\equiv (g-2)/2$, will be performed at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory\nwith data taking beginning in 2017. The most recent measurement, performed at\nBrookhaven National Laboratory and completed in 2001, shows a 3.5 standard\ndeviation discrepancy with the standard model prediction of $a_\\mu$. The new\nmeasurement will accumulate 21 times those statistics using upgraded detection\nand storage ring systems, enabling a measurement of $a_\\mu$ to 140 ppb, a\nfactor of 4 improvement in the uncertainty the previous measurement. This\nimprovement in precision, combined with recent and ongoing improvements in the\nevaluation of the QCD contributions to the $a_\\mu$, could provide a 7.5$\\sigma$\ndiscrepancy from the standard model if the current difference between\nexperiment and theory is confirmed, a possible indication of new physics.\n", "  The large infrastructure projects for the next decade will allow a new\nquantum leap in terms of new possible science. ESFRI, the European Strategy\nForum on Research Infrastructures, a strategic initiative to develop the\nscientific integration of Europe, has identified four facilities (SKA, CTA,\nKM3Net and E-ELT) deserving priority in support. The ASTERICS project aims to\naddress the cross-cutting synergies and common challenges shared by the various\nAstronomy ESFRI and other world-class facilities. The project (22 partners\nacross Europe) is funded by the EU Horizon 2020 programme with 15 MEuro in 4\nyears. It brings together for the first time the astronomy, astrophysics and\nparticle astrophysics communities, in addition to other related research\ninfrastructures.\n", "  The decay $K^+\\to\\pi^+\\nu\\bar{\\nu}$ is highly suppressed in the Standard\nModel (SM), while its rate can be predicted with minimal theoretical\nuncertainty. The branching ratio (BR) for this decay is thus a sensitive probe\nof the flavor sector of the SM; its measurement, however, is a significant\nexperimental challenge. The primary goal of the NA62 experiment is to measure\n${\\rm BR}(K^+\\to\\pi^+\\nu\\bar{\\nu})$ with 10% precision. NA62 took data in pilot\nruns in 2014 and 2015, reaching the design beam intensity. The status of the\nexperiment and the prospects for the measurement of ${\\rm\nBR}(K^+\\to\\pi^+\\nu\\bar{\\nu})$ are presented.\n", "  Graphene is a promising candidate to succeed silicon based devices and doping\nholds the key to graphene electronics. Conventional doping methods through\nsurface functionalization or lattice modification are effective in tuning\ncarrier densities. These processes, however, lead to degradation of device\nperformance because of structural defect creation. A challenge remains to\ncontrollably dope graphene while preserving its superlative properties. Here we\nshow a novel method for tunable and erasable doping of on-chip graphene,\nrealized by using a focused electron beam. Our results demonstrate\nsite-specific control of carrier type and concentration achievable by\nmodulating the charge distribution in the dielectric substrate. Thereby, the\nstructural integrity and electrical performance of graphene are preserved, and\nthe doping states are rewritable. Different logic operations were thus\nimplemented in a single graphene sheet. By extending this method to other\ntwo-dimensional materials, this work lays out a blueprint for powerful yet\nsimple means of incorporating two-dimensional materials into prospective\nelectronic technologies.\n", "  We describe a novel method for producing Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states\nin cold atoms coupled to a superconducting coplanar cavity. In the proposed\nscheme, atoms interact between each other by virtual photon exchange via a\ncavity mode. These interactions cause an asymmetric Rydberg blockade mechanism\nthat suppresses simultaneous excitations into different atomic Rydberg levels,\nthus forcing all atoms to occupy the same Rydberg state. This mechanism has\neffect even if the atoms are separated by distances of the order of\nmillimeters. The atomic populations are transferred adiabatically from the\nground state into the entangled state by following a collective dark state with\nlow dissipation rates.\n", "  A storage ring provides an attractive option for directly measuring the\nelectric dipole moment~(EDM) of charged particles. To reach a sensitivity of\n10^-29 e x cm, it is critical to mitigate the systematic errors from all\nsources. This daunting task is pushing the precision frontier of accelerator\nscience and technology beyond its current state of the art. Here, we present a\nunique idea of a magnetic dipole moment~(MDM) spin transparent quadrupole that\ncan significantly reduce the systematic errors due to the transverse electric\nand magnetic fields that particle encounters.\n"]}
