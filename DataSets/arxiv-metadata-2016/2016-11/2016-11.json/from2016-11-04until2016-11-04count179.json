The\nLagrange hypothesis, that the optimal rod possesses the constant cross-section\nwas abandoned for Euler buckling problem. In this Article the Lagrange\nhypothesis is proved to be valid for Greenhill's problem of torque buckling.\nThe corresponding isoperimetric inequality is affirmed.\n", "  In the hard-core model on a finite graph we are given a parameter lambda>0,\nand an independent set I arises with probability proportional to lambda^|I|. On\ninfinite graphs a Gibbs distribution is defined as a suitable limit with the\ncorrect conditional probabilities. In the infinite setting we are interested in\ndetermining when this limit is unique and when there is phase coexistence,\ni.e., existence of multiple Gibbs states. On finite graphs we are interested in\ndetermining the mixing time of local Markov chains.\n  On Z^2 it is conjectured that these problems are related and that both\nundergo a phase transition at some critical point lambda_c approx 3.79. For\nphase coexistence, much of the work to date has focused on the regime of\nuniqueness, with the best result being recent work of Restrepo et al. showing\nthat there is a unique Gibbs state for all lambda < 2.3882. Here we give the\nfirst non-trivial result in the other direction, showing that there are\nmultiple Gibbs states for all lambda > 5.3646. Our proof adds two significant\ninnovations to the standard Peierls argument. First, building on the idea of\nfault lines introduced by Randall, we construct an event that distinguishes two\nboundary conditions and always has long contours associated with it, obviating\nthe need to accurately enumerate short contours. Second, we obtain vastly\nimproved bounds on the number of contours by relating them to a new class of\nself-avoiding walks on an oriented version of Z^2.\n  We extend our characterization of fault lines to show that local Markov\nchains will mix slowly when lambda > 5.3646 on lattice regions with periodic\n(toroidal) boundary conditions and when lambda > 7.1031 with non-periodic\n(free) boundary conditions. The arguments here rely on a careful analysis that\nrelates contours to taxi walks and represent a sevenfold improvement to the\npreviously best known values of \\lambda.\n", "  There is current interest in dynamical description of dif- ferent\ndecompositions of a quantum system into subsystems. We investi- gate usefulness\nof the Nakajima-Zwanzig projection method in this context. Particularly, we are\ninterested in simultaneous description of dynamics of open systems pertaining\nto dierent system-environment splits (decompo- sitions). We find that the\nNakajima-Zwanzig and related projection meth- ods are system-environment split\nspecific, that every system-environment split requires specific projector, and\nthat projector adapted to a split nei- ther provides information about nor\ncommute with a projector adapted to an alternative system-environment split.\nOur findings refer to finite- and infinite-dimensional systems and to arbitrary\nkinds of system-environment splitting. These findings are a direct consequence\nof the recently established quantum correlations relativity. We emphasize the\nsubtlety and delicacy re- quired of the task of simultaneously describing the\ndynamics of alternate system-environment splits.\n", "  Quantum transition points in the J -Q model---the test bed of the deconfined\ncritical point theory---and the SU(2)-symmetric discrete noncompact CP^1\nrepresentation of the deconfined critical action are directly compared by the\nflowgram method. We find that the flows of two systems coincide in a broad\nregion of linear system sizes (10 < L < 50 for the J -Q model), implying that\nthe deconfined critical point theory correctly captures the mesoscopic physics\nof competition between the antiferromagnetic and valence-bond orders in quantum\nspin systems. At larger sizes, however, we observe significant deviations\nbetween the two flows which both demonstrate strong violations of scale\ninvariance. This reliably rules out the second-order transition scenario in at\nleast one of the two models and suggests the most likely explanation for the\nnature of the transition in the J-Q model.\n", "  We investigate the magnetic interface states of graphene quantum dots that\ncontain p-n junctions. Within a tight-binding approach, we consider rectangular\nquantum dots in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field containing p-n,\nas well as p-n-p and n-p-n junctions. The results show the interplay between\nthe edge states associated with the zigzag terminations of the sample and the\nsnake states that arise at the p-n junction, due to the overlap between\nelectron and hole states at the potential interface. Remarkable localized\nstates are found at the crossing of the p-n junction with the zigzag edge\nhaving a dumb-bell shaped electron distribution. The results are presented as\nfunction of the junction parameters and the applied magnetic flux.\n", "  We summarize the present state of research on the darkon fuid as a model for\nthe dark sector of the Universe. Nonrelativistic massless particles are\nintroduced as a realization of the Galilei group in an enlarged phase space.\nThe additional degrees of freedom allow for a nonstandard, minimal coupling to\ngravity respecting Einstein's equivalence principle. Extended to a\nself-gravitating fluid the Poisson equation for the gravitational potential\ncontains a dynamically generated effective gravitational mass density of either\nsign. The equations of motion (EOMs) contain no free parameters and are\ninvariant w.r.t. Milne gauge transformations. Fixing the gauge eliminates the\nunphysical degrees of freedom. The resulting Lagrangian possesses no free\nparticle limit. The particles it describes, darkons, exist only as fluid\nparticles of a self-gravitating fluid. This darkon fluid realizes the zero-mass\nGalilean algebra extended by dilations with dynamical exponent z = 5/3. We\nreduce the EOMs to Friedmann-like equations, derive conserved quantities and a\nunique Hamiltonian dynamics by implementing dilation symmetry. By the Casimir\nof the Poisson-bracket (PB)-algebra we foliate the phase space and construct a\nLagrangian in reduced phase space. We solve the Friedmann-like equations with\nthe transition redshift and the value of the Casimir as integration constants.\nWe obtain a deceleration phase for the early Universe and an acceleration phase\nfor the late Universe in agreement with observations. Steady state equations in\nthe spherically symmetric case may model a galactic halo. Numerical solutions\nof a nonlinear differential equation for the gravitational potential lead to\npredictions for the dark matter (DM) part of the rotation curves (RCs) of\ngalaxies in qualitative agreement with observational data. We also present a\ngeneral covariant generalization of the model.\n", "  We discuss charged particles motion in a spacetime of a weakly magnetized\nstatic non-rotating black hole. We study under which conditions a charged\nparticle originally revolving around the black hole at a circular orbit after\nbeing kicked by another particle or photon can escape to infinity. We determine\nthe escape velocity for particles at the innermost stable circular orbits and\ndiscuss the properties of particles moving with near-critical velocity. We show\nthat in a general case such a motion is chaotic.\n", "  We investigate molecular dynamics of multiple ionization in N2 through\nmultiple core-level photoabsorption and subsequent Auger decay processes\ninduced by intense, short X-ray free electron laser pulses. The timing dynamics\nof the photoabsorption and dissociation processes is mapped onto the kinetic\nenergy of the fragments. Measurements of the latter allow us to map out the\naverage internuclear separation for every molecular photoionization sequence\nstep and obtain the average time interval between the photoabsorption events.\nUsing multiphoton ionization as a tool of multiple-pulse pump-probe scheme, we\ndemonstrate the modification of the ionization dynamics as we vary the x-ray\nlaser pulse duration.\n", "  As a part of our series of studies on deuteron induced reaction on various\ntarget materials excitation functions on natural cobalt have been measured by\nusing stacked-foil technique. In these measurements 51Cr, 55;56;57;58Co, 51Cr,\n52;54;56Mn and 56;57Ni radioisotopes have been identified. For the above\nisotopes the excitation functions were determined and compared with the\nliterature data and with the results of EMPIRE and TALYS calculations taken\nfrom the TENDL 2011 library. The agreement with previous measurements was\nacceptable and we could also determine new cross-section data.\n", "  We have performed a detailed analysis of the electron temperature and density\nin the the Ring Nebula using the calibrated HST WFC3 images described in the\npreceding paper. The electron temperature (Te) determined from [N II] and [O\nIII] rises slightly and monotonically towards the central star. The observed\nequivalent width (EW) in the central region indicates that Te rises as high as\n13000 K. In contrast, the low EW's in the outer regions are largely due to\nscattered diffuse Galactic radiation by dust. The images allowed determination\nof unprecedented small scale variations in Te. These variations indicate that\nthe mean square area temperature fluctuations are significantly higher than\nexpected from simple photoionization. The power producing these fluctuations\noccurs at scales of less than 3.5E15 cm. This scale length provides a strong\nrestriction on the mechanism causing the large t^2 values observed.\n", "  Results from the Beam Energy Scan (BES) program conducted recently by STAR\nexperiment at RHIC are presented. The data from Phase-I of the BES program\ncollected in Au+Au collisions at center-of-mass energies (\\sqrt{s_{NN}}) of\n7.7, 11.5, 19.6, 27, and 39 GeV cover a wide range of baryon chemical potential\n?\\mu_B (100-400 MeV) in the QCD phase diagram. Several STAR results from the\nBES Phase-I related to \"turn-off\" of strongly inter- acting quark-gluon plasma\n(sQGP) signatures and signals of QCD phase boundary are reported. In addition\nto this, an outlook is presented for the future BES Phase-II program and a\npossible fixed target program at STAR.\n", "  The out-of-plane g-factor g_perp for quasi-2D holes in a (100) GaAs\nheterostructure is studied using a variable width quantum wire. A direct\nmeasurement of the Zeeman splitting is performed in a magnetic field applied\nperpendicular to the 2D plane. We measure an out-of-plane g-factor up to g_perp\n= 5, which is larger than previous optical studies of g_perp, and is\napproaching the long predicted but never experimentally verified out-of-plane\ng-factor of 7.2 for heavy holes.\n", "  Excited states in 17C were investigated through the measurement of\nbeta?-delayed neutrons and gamma rays emitted in the ? decay of 17B. In the\nmeasurement, three negative-parity states and two inconclusive states, were\nidentified in 17C above the neutron threshold energy, and seven gamma-lines\nwere identified in a beta?-delayed multiple neutron emission of the 17B ?\ndecay. From these transitions, the beta?-decay scheme of 17B was determined. In\nthe present work, the fibeta-NMR technique is combined with the ?-delayed\nparticle measurements using a fragmentation-induced spin-polarized 17B beam.\nThis new scheme allows us to determine the spin parity of beta?-decay feeding\nexcited states based on the difference in the discrete fibeta-decay asymmetry\nparameters, provided the states are connected through the Gamow-Teller\ntransition. In this work, 1/2-, 3/2-, and (5/2-) are assigned to the observed\nstates at Ex = 2.71(2), 3.93(2), and 4.05(2) MeV in 17C, respectively.\n", "  A combination of state-of-the-art theoretical methods has been used to obtain\nan atomic-level picture of classical and quantum ordering of protons in cold\nhigh-pressure solid hydro-gen. We focus mostly on phases II and III of\nhydrogen, exploring the effects of quantum nuclear motion on certain features\nof these phases (through a number of ab initio path-integral molecular dynamics\n(PIMD) simulations at particular points on the phase diagram). We also examine\nthe importance of van der Waals forces in this system by performing\ncalculations using the optB88-vdW density functional, which accounts for\nnon-local correlations. Our calculations reveal that the transition between\nphases I and II is strongly quantum in nature, resulting from a competition\nbetween anisotropic inter-molecular interactions that restrict molecular\nrotation and thermal plus quantum fluctuations of the nuclear positions that\nfacilitate it. The transition from phase II to III is more classical because\nquantum nuclear motion plays only a secondary role and the transition is\ndetermined primarily by the underlying potential energy surface. A structure of\nP21c symmetry with 24 atoms in the primitive unit cell is found to be stable\nwhen anharmonic quantum nuclear vibrational motion is included at finite\ntemperatures using the PIMD method. This structure gives a good account of the\ninfra-red (IR) and Raman vibron frequencies of phase II. We find ad-ditional\nsupport for C2/c structure as a strong candidate for phase III, since it\nremains transparent up to 300 GPa, even when quantum nuclear effects are\nincluded. Finally, we find that accounting for van der Waals forces improves\nthe agreement between experiment and theory for the parts of the phase diagram\nconsidered, when compared to previous work which employed the widely-used\nPerdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional.\n", "  We introduce a spin model which exhibits the main properties of a Kerr medium\nto describe an intensity dependent coupling between a two-level atom and the\nradiation field. We select a unitary irreducible representation of the su(2)\nLie algebra such that the number of excitations of the field is bounded from\nabove. We analyze the behavior of both the atomic and the field quantum\nproperties and its dependence on the maximal number of excitations.\n", "  The Riemann-zeta function regularization procedure has been studied\nintensively as a good method in the computation of the determinant for\npseudo-diferential operator. In this paper we propose a different approach for\nthe computation of the determinant base on the Wheeler-De Witt equation.\n", "  A simple, practical model for computing the equilibrium thermodynamics and\nstructure of jellium by classical strong coupling methods is proposed. An\neffective pair potential and coupling constant are introduced, incorporating\nthe ideal gas, low density, and weak coupling quantum limits. The resulting\nparameter free, analytic model is illustrated by the calculation of the pair\ncorrelation function over a wide range of temperatures and densities via strong\ncoupling classical liquid state theory. The results compare favorably with the\nfirst finite temperature restricted path integral Monte Carlo simulations\nreported recently.\n", "  We report the detection of hydrogen chloride, HCl, in diffuse molecular\nclouds on the line of sight towards the star-forming region W31C (G10.6-0.4).\nThe J = 1-0 lines of the two stable HCl isotopologues, H35Cl and H37Cl, are\nobserved using the 1b receiver of the Heterodyne Instrument for the\nFar-Infrared (HIFI) aboard the Herschel Space Observatory. The HCl line is\ndetected in absorption, over a wide range of velocities associated with diffuse\nclouds along the line of sight to W31C. The analysis of the absorption strength\nyields a total HCl column density of few 10^13 cm^-2, implying that HCl\naccounts for ~0.6 % of the total gasphase chlorine, which exceeds by a factor\nof ~6 the theoretical model predictions. This result is comparable to those\nobtained from the chemically-related species H2Cl+ and HCl+, for which large\ncolumn densities have also been reported on the same line of sight. The source\nof discrepancy between models and observations is still unknown; however, the\ndetection of these Cl-bearing molecules, provides key constraints for the\nchlorine chemistry in the diffuse gas.\n", "  We demonstrate a non-equilibrium phase transition in a dilute thermal atomic\ngas. The phase transition, between states of low and high Rydberg occupancy, is\ninduced by resonant dipole-dipole interactions between Rydberg atoms. The gas\ncan be considered as dilute as the atoms are separated by distances much\ngreater than the wavelength of the optical transitions used to excite them. In\nthe frequency domain we observe a mean-field shift of the Rydberg state which\nresults in intrinsic optical bistability above a critical Rydberg number\ndensity. In the time domain we observe critical slowing down where the recovery\ntime to system perturbations diverges with critical exponent\n  $\\tau=0.53 \\pm 0.10$. The atomic emission spectrum of the phase with high\nRydberg occupancy provides evidence for a superradiant cascade.\n", "  The Fe unresolved transition array (UTAs) produce prominent features in the\n15-17?A wavelength range in the spectra of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Here\nwe present new calculations of the energies and oscillator strengths of inner-\nshell lines from Fe XIV, Fe XV, and Fe XVI. These are crucial ions since they\nare dominant at inflection points in the gas thermal stability curve, and UTA\nexcitation followed by autoionization is an important ionization mechanism for\nthese species. We incorporate these, and data reported in previous papers, into\nthe plasma simulation code Cloudy. This updated physics is subsequently\nemployed to reconsider the thermally stable phases in absorbing media in Active\nGalactic Nuclei. We show how the absorption profile of the Fe XIV UTA depends\non density, due to the changing populations of levels within the ground\nconfiguration.\n", "  Stellar multiplicity is an ubiquitous outcome of the star formation process.\nCharacterizing the frequency and main characteristics of multiple systems and\ntheir dependencies on primary mass and environment is therefore a powerful tool\nto probe this process. While early attempts were fraught with selection biases\nand limited completeness, instrumentation breakthroughs in the last two decades\nnow enable robust analyses. In this review, we summarize our current empirical\nknowledge of stellar multiplicity for Main Sequence stars and brown dwarfs, as\nwell as among populations of Pre-Main Sequence stars and embedded protostars.\nClear trends as a function of both primary mass and stellar evolutionary stage\nare identified that will serve as a comparison basis for numerical and\nanalytical models of star formation.\n", "  It is shown that the famous paradox of two charged capacitors is successfully\nresolved if all the energy changes in the system are properly considered when\nsome of the charges are transferred from one capacitor to the other. It happens\nso even when the connecting wire has an identically zero resistance, giving\nrise to no Ohmic losses in the wire. It is shown that in such a case the\n\"missing energy\" goes into the kinetic energy of conducting charges. It is\nshown that radiation plays no significant role in resolving the paradox. The\nproblem can be formulated and successfully resolved in a novel form, where the\ncapacitance of the system is increased by stretching the plates of the original\ncapacitor, without involving any connecting wires in a circuit. There is an\noutward self-force due to mutual repulsion among charges stored within each\ncapacitor plate, and the work done by these self-forces during an expansion is\nindeed equal to the missing energy of the capacitor system.\n", "  By integrating 4 lines of thoughts: symmetry breaking originally advanced by\nAnderson, bifurcation from nonlinear dynamics, Landau's theory of phase\ntransition, and the mechanism of emergent rare events studied by Kramers, we\nintroduce a possible framework for understanding mesoscopic dynamics that links\n(i) fast lower level microscopic motions, (ii) movements within each basin at\nthe mid-level, and (iii) higher-level rare transitions between neighboring\nbasins, which have rates that decrease exponentially with the size of the\nsystem. In this mesoscopic framework, multiple attractors arise as emergent\nproperties of the nonlinear systems. The interplay between the stochasticity\nand nonlinearity leads to successive jump-like transitions among different\nbasins. We argue each transition is a dynamic symmetry breaking, with the\npotential of exhibiting Thom-Zeeman catastrophe as well as phase transition\nwith the breakdown of ergodicity (e.g., cell differentiation). The slow-time\ndynamics of the nonlinear mesoscopic system is not deterministic, rather it is\na discrete stochastic jump process. The existence of these discrete states and\nthe Markov transitions among them are both emergent phenomena. This emergent\nstochastic jump dynamics then serves as the stochastic element for the\nnonlinear dynamics of a higher level aggregates on an even larger spatial and\nslower time scales (e.g., evolution). This description captures the\nhierarchical structure outlined by Anderson and illustrates two distinct types\nof limit of a mesoscopic dynamics: A long-time ensemble thermodynamics in terms\nof time $t$ tending infinity followed by the size of the system $N$ tending\ninfinity, and a short-time trajectory steady state with $N$ tending infinity\nfollowed by $t$ tending infinity. With these limits, symmetry breaking and cusp\ncatastrophe are two perspectives of the same mesoscopic system on different\ntime scales.\n", "  A star collapsing gravitationally into a black hole emits a flux of\nradiation, known as Hawking radiation. When the initial state of a quantum\nfield on the background of the star, is placed in the Unruh vacuum in the far\npast, then in the exterior Hawking radiation corresponds to a flux of positive\nenergy radiation travelling outwards from near the surface to future infinity.\nBased on pair creation, the evaporation of the collapsing star can be\nequivalently described by the absorption of an ingoing negative energy flux of\nradiation travelling towards the center of the star. Here, we are interested in\nthe evolution of the star during its collapse. Thus we include the backreaction\nof the negative energy Hawking flux in the interior geometry of the collapsing\nstar when writing the full 4-dimensional Einstein and hydrodynamic equations.\nHawking radiation emitted before the star passes through its Schwarzschild\nradius slows down and reverses the collapse of the star. The star evaporates\nwithout forming an horizon or a singularity. This study provides a more\nrealistic investigation than the one first presented in [1], since the\nbackreaction of Hawking radiation flux on the collapsing star is studied in the\ncase when the initial state of the field is in Unruh's vacuum.\n", "  The Spectral Galaxy Pairs (SGPs) are defined as the composite galaxy spectra\nwhich contain two independent redshift systems. These spectra are useful for\nstudying dust properties of the foreground galaxies. In this paper, a total of\n165 spectra of SGPs are mined out from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data\nRelease 9 (DR9) using the concept of membership degree from the fuzzy set\ntheory particularly defined to be suitable for fuzzily identifying emission\nlines. The spectra and images of this sample are classified according to the\nmembership degree and their image features, respectively. Many of these 2nd\nredshift systems are too small or too dim to select from the SDSS images alone,\nmaking the sample a potentially unique source of information on dust effects in\nlow-luminosity or low-surface-brightness galaxies that are underrepresented in\nmorphological pair samples. The dust extinction of the objects with high\nmembership degree is also estimated by Balmer decrement. Additionally, analyses\nfor a series of spectroscopic observations of one SGP from 165 systems indicate\nthat a newly star-forming region of our Milky Way might occur.\n", "  We investigate the pressure and temperature dependence of the lattice\ndynamics of the underdoped, stoichiometric, high temperature superconductor\nYBa2Cu4O8 by means of Raman spectroscopy and ab initio calculations. This\nsystem undergoes a reversible pressure-induced structural phase transition\naround 10 GPa to a collapsed orthorhombic structure, that is well reproduced by\nthe calculation. The coupling of the B1g-like buckling phonon mode to the\nelectronic continuum is used to probe superconductivity. In the low pressure\nphase, self-energy effects through the superconducting transition renormalize\nthis phonon, and the amplitude of this renormalization strongly increases with\npressure. Whereas our calculation indicates that this mode's coupling to the\nelectronic system is only marginally affected by the structural phase\ntransition, the aforementioned renormalization is completely suppressed in the\nhigh pressure phase, demonstrating that under hydrostatic pressures higher than\n10 GPa, superconductivity in YBa2Cu4O8 is greatly weakened or obliterated.\n", "  In recent decades, a number of centrality metrics describing network\nproperties of nodes have been proposed to rank the importance of nodes. In\norder to understand the correlations between centrality metrics and to\napproximate a high-complexity centrality metric by a strongly correlated\nlow-complexity metric, we first study the correlation between centrality\nmetrics in terms of their Pearson correlation coefficient and their similarity\nin ranking of nodes. In addition to considering the widely used centrality\nmetrics, we introduce a new centrality measure, the degree mass. The m order\ndegree mass of a node is the sum of the weighted degree of the node and its\nneighbors no further than m hops away. We find that the B_{n}, the closeness,\nand the components of x_{1} are strongly correlated with the degree, the\n1st-order degree mass and the 2nd-order degree mass, respectively, in both\nnetwork models and real-world networks. We then theoretically prove that the\nPearson correlation coefficient between x_{1} and the 2nd-order degree mass is\nlarger than that between x_{1} and a lower order degree mass. Finally, we\ninvestigate the effect of the inflexible antagonists selected based on\ndifferent centrality metrics in helping one opinion to compete with another in\nthe inflexible antagonists opinion model. Interestingly, we find that selecting\nthe inflexible antagonists based on the leverage, the B_{n}, or the degree is\nmore effective in opinion-competition than using other centrality metrics in\nall types of networks. This observation is supported by our previous\nobservations, i.e., that there is a strong linear correlation between the\ndegree and the B_{n}, as well as a high centrality similarity between the\nleverage and the degree.\n", "  A hybrid quantum system combines two or more distinct quantum components,\nexhibiting features not seen in these individual systems. In this work, we\nstudy the one-dimensional Jaynes-Cummings- Hubbard model in the two-excitation\nsubspace. We find that the center momentum of two-excitation induces a magnetic\nux piercing the 4-leg ladder in the auxiliary space. Furthermore, it is shown\nthat the system in {\\pi}-center-momentum subspace is equivalent to a chain\nsystem for spin-1 particle with spin-orbit coupling. As a simple application,\nbased on this concise description, a series of bound-pair eigenstates is\npresented, which displays long-range correlation.\n", "  Bosonic string theory with the possibility for an arbitrary number of strings\n- i.e. a string field theory - is formulated by a Hilbert space (a Fock space),\nwhich is just that for massless noninteracting scalars. We earlier presented\nthis novel type of string field theory, but now we show that it leads to\nscattering just given by the Veneziano model amplitude. Generalization to\nstrings with fermion modes would presumably be rather easy. It is\ncharacteristic for our formulation /model that: 1) We have thrown away some\nnull set of information compared to usual string field theory, 2)Formulated in\nterms of our \\objects\" (= the non-interacting scalars) there is no interaction\nand essentially no time development(Heisenberg picture), 3) so that the\nS-matrix is in our Hilbert space given as the unit matrix, S=1, and 4) the\nVeneziano scattering amplitude appear as the overlap between the initial and\nthe final state described in terms of the \\objects\". 5) The integration in the\nEuler beta function making up the Veneziano model appear from the summation\nover the number of \\objects\" from one of the incoming strings which goes into a\ncertain one of the two outgoing strings. A correction from Weyl anomaly is\nneeded to get the correct form of the Veneziano amplitude and it only fits for\n26 dimensions.\n", "  Recently, we determined a lower bound for the Milky Way mass in a point mass\napproximation. This result was obtained for most general spherically symmetric\nphase-space distribution functions consistent with a measured radial velocity\ndispersion. As a stability test of these predictions against a perturbation of\nthe point mass potential, in this paper we make use of a representative of\nthese functions to set the initial conditions for a simulation in a more\nrealistic potential of similar mass and accounting for other observations. The\npredicted radial velocity dispersion profile evolves to forms still consistent\nwith the measured profile, proving structural stability of the point mass\napproximation and the reliability of the resulting mass estimate of\n$2.1\\times10^{11}\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ within $150\\,\\mathrm{kpc}$. We also find\nan interesting coincidence with the recent estimates based on the kinematics of\nthe extended Orphan Stream. As a byproduct, we obtain the equations of motion\nin axial symmetry from a nonstandard Hamiltonian, and derive a formula in the\nspherical symmetry relating the radial velocity dispersion profile to a\ndirectly measured kinematical observable.\n", "  An attempt is made to de-mystify the apparent \"paradox\" between microscopic\ntime revsersibility and macroscopic time irreversibility. It is our common\nexperience that a hot cup of coffee cools down to room temperature and it never\nautomatically becomes hot (unless we put that in a microwave for heating or on\nstove etc) and there are numerous examples. This \"one sidedness\" of physical\nprocesses (like cooling of hot cup) is in apparent contradiction with the time\nreversibility of the dynamical equations of motion (classical or quantum). The\nprocess of automatic heating of a cold cup etc is perfectly possible from the\ndynamical equations perspective. Ludwig Boltzmann explained this \"one\nsidedness\" of physical processes starting from dynamical equations (his\nH-theorem). A criticism was raised by Boltzmann's contemporaries. The origin of\nthis criticism lies in the very philosophy of \"mechanism\" that was very\nprevalent in the 19th century. Everyone wanted to understand physical phenomena\nthrough Newtonian mechanics (even J. C. Maxwell devised a mechanical mechanism\nusing gears to explain the electromagnetic field!). The central issue was how\ncan one obtain this \"one sidedness\" (time irreversiblility) if the underlying\ndynamical laws are time reversible. Number of articles exist in literature on\nthe issue. But those are mathematically oriented and a simple presentation from\npractical point of view is seriously lacking. This article is an attempt to\nde-mystify this \"paradox\" from simple and practical point of view.\n", "  Due to the thick boundary layers in hypersonic flows, the state of the\nboundary layer significantly influences the whole flow field as well as surface\nheat loads. Hence, for engineering applications the efficient numerical\nprediction of laminar-to-turbulent transition is a challenging and important\ntask. Within the framework of the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations,\nLangtry/Menter [1] proposed the $\\gamma$-$Re_{\\theta_t}$ transition model using\ntwo transport equations for the intermittency and $\\gamma$-$Re_{\\theta_t}$\ncombined with the Shear Stress Transport turbulence model (SST) [2]. The\ntransition model contains two empirical correlations for onset and length of\ntransition. Langtry/Menter [1] designed and validated the correlations for the\nsubsonic and transonic flow regime. For our applications in the hypersonic flow\nregime, the development of a new set of correlations proved necessary, even\nwhen using the same SST turbulence model [3]. Within this paper, we propose a\nnext step and couple the transition model with the SSG/LRR-$\\omega$ Reynolds\nstress turbulence model [4] which we found to be well suited for scramjet\nintake simulations. First, we illustrate the necessary modifications of the\nReynolds stress model and the hypersonic in-house correlations using a\nhypersonic flat plate test case. Next, the transition model is successfully\nvalidated for its use coupled to both turbulence models using a hypersonic\ndouble ramp test case. Regardless of the turbulence model, the transition model\nis able to correctly predict the transition process compared to experimental\ndata. In addition, we apply the transition model combined with both turbulence\nmodels to three different fully 3D scramjet intake configurations which are\nexperimentally investigated in wind tunnel facilities. The agreement with the\navailable experimental data is also shown.\n", "  To maintain a constant cell size, dividing cells have to coordinate cell\ncycle events with cell growth. This coordination has for long been supposed to\nrely on the existence of size thresholds determining cell cycle progression\n[1]. In budding yeast, size is controlled at the G1/S transition [11]. In\nagreement with this hypothesis, the size at birth influences the time spent in\nG1: smaller cells have a longer G1 period [3]. Nevertheless, even though cells\nborn smaller have a longer G1, the compensation is imperfect and they still bud\nat smaller cell sizes. In bacteria, several recent studies have shown that the\nincremental model of size control, in which size is controlled by addition of a\nconstant volume (in contrast to a size threshold), is able to quantitatively\nexplain the experimental data on 4 different bacterial species [6, 5, 6, 7].\nHere, we report on experimental results for the budding yeast Saccharomyces\ncerevisiae, finding, surprisingly, that cell size control in this organism is\nvery well described by the incremental model, suggesting a common strategy for\ncell size control with bacteria. Additionally, we argue that for S. cerevisiae\nthe volume increment is not added from birth to division, but rather between\ntwo budding events.\n", "  Quantum computation is a continuously growing research area which is based on\nnature and resources of quantum mechanics, as superposition and entanglement.\nIn its quantum circuits version, the use of convenient and appropriate gates is\nessential. But while those gates adopt convenient forms for computational\nalgorithms, their design depends on specific quantum systems and stu? being\nused. These gates need manage quantum systems based on physical interactions\nruled by quantum Hamiltonians. With this, gates design is restricted to\nproperties and limitations of interactions and physical elements being\ninvolved. This work shows how anisotropic Ising interactions, written in a non\nlocal basis, lets reproduce elementary operations in terms of which unitary\nprocesses can be factorized. In this sense, gates could be written as a\nsequence of pulses ruled by that interaction driven by magnetic fields, stating\nalternative results in quantum gates design for magnetic systems.\n", "  In this paper we consider calculation of two-centre exchange integrals over\nSlater-type orbitals (STOs). We apply the Neumann expansion of the Coulomb\ninteraction potential and consider calculation of all basic quantities which\nappear in the resulting expression. Analytical closed-form equations for all\nauxiliary quantities have already been known but they suffer from large digital\nerosion when some of the parameters are large or small. We derive two\ndifferential equations which are obeyed by the most difficult basic integrals.\nTaking them as a starting point, useful series expansions for small parameter\nvalues or asymptotic expansions for large parameter values are systematically\nderived. The resulting novel expansions replace the corresponding analytical\nexpressions when the latter introduce significant cancellations. Additionally,\nwe reconsider numerical integration of some necessary quantities and present a\nnew way to calculate the integrand with a controlled precision. All proposed\nmethods are combined to lead to a general, stable algorithm. We perform\nextensive numerical tests of the introduced expressions to verify their\nvalidity and usefulness. Advances reported here provide methodology to compute\ntwo-electron exchange integrals over STOs for a broad range of the nonlinear\nparameters and large angular momenta.\n", "  A stochastic approach to time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is\ndeveloped for computing the absorption cross section and the random phase\napproximation (RPA) correlation energy. The core idea of the approach involves\ntime-propagation of a small set of stochastic orbitals which are first\nprojected on the occupied space and then propagated in time according to the\ntime-dependent Kohn-Sham equations. The evolving electron density is exactly\nrepresented when the number of random orbitals is infinite, but even a small\nnumber (? 16) of such orbitals is enough to obtain meaningful results for\nabsorption spectrum and the RPA correlation energy per electron. We implement\nthe approach for silicon nanocrystals (NCs) using real-space grids and find\nthat the overall scaling of the algorithm is sublinear with computational time\nand memory.\n", "  We re-examine the question of condensed neutrino objects (de- generate\nneutrino matter) based on new calculations. The potential show-stopper issue of\nfree-streaming light neutrinos inhibiting galaxy formation is addressed. We\ncompute the period associated with sim- ple harmonic motion (SHM) of galaxies\nembedded within condensed neutrino objects. For observational consequences, we\nexamine the ro- tational velocities of embedded galaxies using Hickson 88A\n(N6978) as the prototype. Finally, we point out that degenerate neutrino\nobjects repel each other in overlap and we compute directly the repulsive force\nbetween two interesting and relevant configurations. An outstanding issue is\nwhether the accompanying tidal forces generated by condensed neutrino matter on\nembedded galaxies give rise to galactic bulges and halos.\n", "  We propose and analyze a two-state valence-bond model of non-equilibrium\nsolvation effects on the excited-state twisting reaction of monomethine\ncyanines. Suppression of this reaction is thought responsible for\nenvironment-dependent fluorescence yield enhancement in these dyes.\nFluorescence is quenched because twisting is accompanied via the formation of\ndark twisted intramolecular charge-transfer (TICT) states. For monomethine\ncyanines, where the ground state is a superposition of structures with\ndifferent bond and charge localization, there are two possible twisting\npathways with different charge localization in the excited state. For\nparameters corresponding to symmetric monomethines, the model predicts two\nlow-energy twisting channels on the excited-state surface that lead to a\nmanifold of twisted intramolecular charge-transfer (TICT) states. For typical\nmonomethines, twisting on the excited state surface will occur with a small\nbarrier or no barrier. Changes in the solvation configuration can\ndifferentially stabilize TICT states in channels corresponding to different\nbonds, and that the position of a conical intersection between adiabatic states\nmoves in response to solvation to stabilize either one channel or the other.\nThere is a conical intersection seam that grows along the bottom of the\nexcited-state potential with increasing solvent polarity. For monomethine\ncyanines with modest-sized terminal groups in moderately polar solution, the\nbottom of the excited-state potential surface is completely spanned by a\nconical intersection seam.\n", "  The nonlocal symmetry of the generalized fifth order KdV equation (FOKdV) is\nfirst obtained by using the related Lax pair and then localized in a new\nenlarged system by introducing some new variables. On this basis, new B\u007facklund\ntransformation is obtained through Lie's first theorem. Furthermore, the\ngeneral form of Lie point symmetry for the enlarged FOKdV system is found and\nnew interaction solutions for the FOKdV equation are explored by using\nclassical symmetry reduction method.\n", "  We report on the spin densities in CeRuSn determined at elevated and at low\ntemperatures using polarized neutron diffraction. At 285 K, where the CeRuSn\ncrystal structure, commensurate with the CeCoAl type, contains two different\ncrystallographic Ce sites, we observe that one Ce site is clearly more\nsusceptible to the applied magnetic field whereas the other is hardly\npolarizable. This finding clearly documents that distnictly different local\nenvironment of the two Ce sites causes the Ce ions to split into magnetic Ce3+\nand non-magnetic Ce(4-delta)+ valence states. With lowering the temperature,\nthe crystal structure transforms to a structure incommensurately modulated\nalong the c axis. This leads to new inequivalent crystallographic Ce sites\nresulting in a re-distribution of spin densities. Our analysis using the\nsimplest structural approximant shows that in this metallic system Ce ions\nco-exist in different valence states. Localized 4f states that fulfill the\nthird Hund's rule are found to be close to the ideal Ce3+ state (at sites with\nthe largest Ce-Ru interatomic distances) whereas Ce(4-delta)+ valence states\nare found to be itinerant and situated at Ce sites with much shorter Ce-Ru\ndistances. The similarity to the famous alpha-gamma transition in elemental\ncerium is discussed.\n", "  We introduce a generalization of the Jaynes-Cummings model and study some of\nits properties. We obtain the energy spectrum and eigenfunctions of this model\nby using the tilting transformation and the squeezed number states of the\none-dimensional har- monic oscillator. As physical applications, we connect\nthis new model to two important and novelty problems: the relativistic\nparametric amplifier and the quantum simulation of a single trapped ion.\n", "  Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) have been intensively investigated due to its\ngreat homogeneity and high luminosity, which make it possible to use them as\nstandardizable candles for the determination of cosmological parameters. In\n2011, the physics Nobel prize was awarded for the discovery of the accelerating\nexpansion of the Universe through observations of distant supernovae. This is a\npedagogical article, aimed at those starting their study of that subject, in\nwhich we dwell on some topics related to the analysis of SNe Ia and their use\nin luminosity distance estimators. Here we investigate their spectral\nproperties and light curve standardization, paying careful attention to the\nfundamental quantities directly related to the SNe Ia observables. Finally, we\ndescribe our own step-by-step implementation of a classical light curve fitter,\nthe stretch, applying it to real data from the Carnegie Supernova Project.\n", "  By using type Ia supernovae (SNIa) to provide the luminosity distance (LD)\ndirectly, which depends on the value of the Hubble constant $H_0= 100 h\\; {\\rm\nkm\\; s^{-1}\\; Mpc^{-1}}$, and the angular diameter distance from galaxy\nclusters or baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) to give the derived LD\naccording to the distance duality relation, we propose a model-independent\nmethod to determine $h$ from the fact that different observations should give\nthe same LD at a given redshift. Combining the Sloan Digital Sky Survey II\n(SDSS-II) SNIa from the MLCS2k2 light curve fit and galaxy cluster data, we\nfind that at the $1\\sigma$ confidence level (CL), $h=0.5867\\pm0.0303$ for the\nsample of the elliptical $\\beta$ model for galaxy clusters, and\n$h=0.6199\\pm0.0293$ for that of the spherical $\\beta$ model. The former is\nsmaller than the values from other observations, whereas the latter is\nconsistent with the Planck result at the $2\\sigma$ CL and agrees very well with\nthe value reconstructed directly from the $H(z)$ data. With the SDSS-II SNIa\nand BAO measurements, a tighter constraint, $h=0.6683\\pm0.0221$, is obtained.\nFor comparison, we also consider the Union 2.1 SNIa from the SALT2 light curve\nfitting. The results from the Union 2.1 SNIa are slightly larger than those\nfrom the SDSS-II SNIa, and the Union 2.1 SNIa + BAOs give the tightest value.\nWe find that the values from SNIa + BAOs are quite consistent with those from\nthe Planck and the BAOs, as well as the local measurement from Cepheids and\nvery-low-redshift SNIa.\n", "  This is the third of a series of papers of low X-ray luminosity galaxy\nclusters. In this work we present the weak lensing analysis of eight clusters,\nbased on observations obtained with the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph in the\n$g'$, $r'$ and $i'$ passbands. For this purpose, we have developed a pipeline\nfor the lensing analysis of ground-based images and we have performed tests\napplied to simulated data. We have determined the masses of seven galaxy\nclusters, six of them measured for the first time. For the four clusters with\navailably spectroscopic data, we find a general agreement between the velocity\ndispersions obtained via weak lensing assuming a Singular Isothermal Sphere\nprofile, and those obtained from the redshift distribution of member galaxies.\nThe correlation between our weak lensing mass determinations and the X-ray\nluminosities are suitably fitted by other observations of the $M-L_{X}$\nrelation and models.\n", "  We compare the known in literature, explicitly covariant 4-dimensional\nformula for the symmetric energy-momentum tensor of electromagnetic field in a\nmedium and the energy-momentum tensor derived by Abraham in the 3-dimensional\nvector form. It is shown that these two objects coincide only on the physical\nconfiguration space $\\overline\\Gamma$, formed by the field vectors and the\nvelocity of the medium, which satisfy the Minkowski constitutive relations. It\nshould be emphasized that the 3-dimensional vector formulae for the components\nof the energy-momentum tensor were obtained by Abraham only on\n$\\overline\\Gamma$, and the task of their extension to the whole unconditional\nconfiguration space $\\Gamma$ was not posed. In order to accomplish the\ncomparison noted above we derive the covariant formula anew by another method,\nnamely, by generalizing the Abraham reasoning. The comparison conducted enables\none to treat the explicitly covariant formula as a unique consistent extension\nof the Abraham formulae to the whole configuration space $\\Gamma$. Thus the\nquestion concerning the relativistic covariance of the original 3-dimensional\nAbraham formulae defined on $\\overline\\Gamma$ is solved positively. We discuss\nin detail the relativistic covariance of the 3-dimensional vector formulae for\nindividual components of the 4-dimensional tensors in electrodynamics which is\nmanifested in the form-invariance of these formulae under Lorentz\ntransformations.\n", "  Drift-reduced plasma fluid models are commonly used in plasma physics for\nanalytics and simulations; however, the validity of such models must be\nverified for the regions of parameter space in which tokamak plasmas exist. By\nlooking at the linear behaviour of drift-reduced and full-velocity models one\ncan determine that the physics lost through the simplification that the\ndrift-reduction provides is important in the core region of the tokamak. It is\nmore acceptable for the edge-region but one must determine specifically for a\ngiven simulation if such a model is appropriate.\n", "  Fundamental to integrated photonic quantum computing is an on-chip method for\nrouting and modulating quantum light emission. We demonstrate a hybrid\nintegration platform consisting of arbitrarily designed waveguide circuits and\nsingle photon sources. InAs quantum dots (QD) embedded in GaAs are bonded to an\nSiON waveguide chip such that the QD emission is coupled to the waveguide mode.\nThe waveguides are SiON core embedded in a SiO2 cladding. A tuneable Mach\nZehnder modulates the emission between two output ports and can act as a\npath-encoded qubit preparation device. The single photon nature of the emission\nwas verified by an on-chip Hanbury Brown and Twiss measurement.\n", "  By means of radiative transfer simulation we study the evolution of the\nfar-infrared colours of protoplanetary discs undergoing inside-out dispersal,\noften referred to as transition discs. We show that a brightening of the mid\nand far-infrared emission from these objects is a natural consequence of the\nremoval of the inner disc. Our results can fully explain recent observations of\ntransition discs in the Chamaleon and Lupus star forming regions from the\nHerschel Gould Belt Survey, which show a higher median for the 70?um (Herschel\nPACS 1) band of known transition objects compared with primordial discs. Our\ntheoretical results hence support the suggestion that the 70?um band may be a\npowerful diagnostic for the identification of transition discs from photometry\ndata, provided that the inner hole is larger than tens of AU, depending on\nspectral type. Furthermore we show that a comparison of photometry in the K ,\n12?um and 7u0?m bands to model tracks can provide a rough, but quick estimate\nof the inner hole size of these objects, provided their inclination is below\n?85 degrees and the inner hole size is again larger than tens of AU.\n", "  In the search for bottom squark (sbottom) in SUSY at the LHC, the common\npractice has been to assume a $100\\%$ decay branching fraction for a given\nsearch channel. In realistic MSSM scenarios, there are often more than one\nsignificant decay modes to be present, which significantly weaken the current\nsbottom search limits at the LHC. On the other hand, the combination of the\nmultiple decay modes offers alternative discovery channels for sbottom\nsearches. In this paper, we present the sbottom decays in a few representative\nmass parameter scenarios. We then analyze the sbottom signal for the pair\nproduction in QCD with one sbottom decaying via $\\tilde{b}\\rightarrow b\n\\chi_1^0,\\ b \\chi_2^0$, and the other one decaying via $\\tilde{b} \\rightarrow t\n\\chi_1^\\pm$. With the gaugino subsequent decaying to gauge bosons or a Higgs\nboson $\\chi_2^0 \\rightarrow Z \\chi_1^0,\\ h \\chi_1^0$ and $\\chi_1^\\pm\n\\rightarrow W^\\pm \\chi_1^0$, we study the reach of those signals at the 14 TeV\nLHC with 300 ${\\rm fb^{-1}}$ integrated luminosity. For a left-handed bottom\nsquark, we find that a mass up to 920 GeV can be discovered at 5$\\sigma$\nsignificance for 250 GeV $< m_{\\chi_1^0} <$ 350 GeV, or excluded up to 1050 GeV\nat the 95\\% confidence level for the $h$ channel ($\\mu>0$); similarly, it can\nbe discovered up to 840 GeV, or excluded up to 900 GeV at the 95\\% confidence\nlevel for the $Z$ channel ($\\mu<0$). The sbottom and stop signals in the same\nSUSY parameter scenario are combined to obtain the optimal sensitivity, which\nis about 150 GeV better than the individual reach of the sbottom or stop. For a\nright-handed bottom squark with $\\tilde{b} \\tilde{b}^* \\rightarrow b \\chi_1^0,\\\nt \\chi_1^\\pm$ channel, we find that the sbottom mass up to 880 GeV can be\ndiscovered at 5$\\sigma$ significance, or excluded up to 1060 GeV at the 95\\%\nconfidence level.\n", "  In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of spreading processes taking place\nover time-varying networks. A common approach to model time-varying networks is\nvia Markovian random graph processes. This modeling approach presents the\nfollowing limitation: Markovian random graphs can only replicate switching\npatterns with exponential inter-switching times, while in real applications\nthese times are usually far from exponential. In this paper, we introduce a\nflexible and tractable extended family of processes able to replicate, with\narbitrary accuracy, any distribution of inter-switching times. We then study\nthe stability of spreading processes in this extended family. We first show\nthat a direct analysis based on It\\^o's formula provides stability conditions\nin terms of the eigenvalues of a matrix whose size grows exponentially with the\nnumber of edges. To overcome this limitation, we derive alternative stability\nconditions involving the eigenvalues of a matrix whose size grows linearly with\nthe number of nodes. Based on our results, we also show that heuristics based\non aggregated static networks approximate the epidemic threshold more\naccurately as the number of nodes grows, or the temporal volatility of the\nrandom graph process is reduced. Finally, we illustrate our findings via\nnumerical simulations.\n", "  We investigate the thermodynamics and phase transition for Kiselev black hole\nand dilaton black hole. Specifically we consider Reissner Nordstr\u007fom black hole\nsurrounded by radiation and dust, and Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by\nquintessence, as special cases of Kiselev solution. We have calculated the\nproducts relating the surface gravities, surface temperatures, Komar energies,\nareas, entropies, horizon radii and the irreducible masses at the Cauchy and\nthe event horizons. It is observed that the product of surface gravities,\nsurface temperature product and product of Komar energies at the horizons are\nnot universal quantities for the Kiselev solutions while products of areas and\nentropies at both the horizons are independent of mass of the above mentioned\nblack holes (except for Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by quintessence).\nFor charged dilaton black hole, all the products vanish. First law of\nthermodynamics is also verified for Kiselev solutions. Heat capacities are\ncalculated and phase transitions are observed, under certain conditions.\n", "  Strongly bound excitons confined in two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors are\ndipoles with a perfect in-plane orientation. In a vertical stack of\nsemiconducting 2D crystals, such in-plane excitonic dipoles are expected to\nefficiently couple across van der Waals gap due to strong interlayer Coulomb\ninteraction and exchange their energy. However, previous studies on\nheterobilayers of group 6 transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) found that\nthe exciton decay dynamics is dominated by interlayer charge transfer (CT)\nprocesses. Here, we report an experimental observation of fast interlayer\nenergy transfer (ET) in MoSe2/WS2 heterostructures using photoluminescence\nexcitation (PLE) spectroscopy. The temperature dependence of the transfer rates\nsuggests that the ET is F\\\"orster-type involving excitons in the WS2 layer\nresonantly exciting higher-order excitons in the MoSe2 layer. The estimated ET\ntime of the order of 1 ps is among the fastest compared to those reported for\nother nanostructure hybrid systems such as carbon nanotube bundles. Efficient\nET in these systems offers prospects for optical amplification and energy\nharvesting through intelligent layer engineering.\n", "  In this work, we investigate black hole (BH) physics in the context of\nquantum corrections. These quantum corrections were introduced recently by\nreplacing classical geodesics with quantal (Bohmian) trajectories and hence\nform a quantum Raychaudhuri equation (QRE). From the QRE, we derive a modified\nSchwarzschild metric, and use that metric to investigate BH singularity and\nthermodynamics. We find that these quantum corrections change the picture of\nHawking radiation greatly when the size of BH approaches the Planck scale. They\nprevent the BH from total evaporation, predicting the existence of a quantum BH\nremnant, which may introduce a possible resolution for the catastrophic\nbehavior of Hawking radiation as the BH mass approaches zero. Those corrections\nalso turn the spacelike singularity of the black hole to be timelike, and hence\nthis may ameliorate the information loss problem.\n", "  We present the new paradigm of critical current by design. Analogous to\nmaterials by design, it aims at predicting the optimal defect landscape in a\nsuperconductor for targeted applications by elucidating the vortex dynamics\nresponsible for the bulk critical current. To highlight this approach, we\ndemonstrate the synergistic combination of critical current measurements on\ncommercial high-temperature superconductors containing self-assembled and\nirradiation tailored correlated defects by using large-scale time-dependent\nGinzburg-Landau simulations for vortex dynamics.\n", "  We adapt the horizon wave-function formalism to describe massive static\nspherically symmetric sources in a general $(1+D)$-dimensional space-time, for\n$D>3$ and including the $D=1$ case. We find that the probability $P_{\\rm BH}$\nthat such objects are (quantum) black holes behaves similarly to the\nprobability in the $(3+1)$ framework for $D> 3$. In fact, for $D\\ge 3$, the\nprobability increases towards unity as the mass grows above the relevant\n$D$-dimensional Planck scale $m_D$. At fixed mass, however, $P_{\\rm BH}$\ndecreases with increasing $D$, so that a particle with mass $m\\simeq m_D$ has\njust about $10\\%$ probability to be a black hole in $D=5$, and smaller for\nlarger $D$. This result has a potentially strong impact on estimates of black\nhole production in colliders. In contrast, for $D=1$, we find the probability\nis comparably larger for smaller masses, but $P_{\\rm BH} < 0.5$, suggesting\nthat such lower dimensional black holes are purely quantum and not classical\nobjects. This result is consistent with recent observations that sub-Planckian\nblack holes are governed by an effective two-dimensional gravitation theory.\nLastly, we derive Generalised Uncertainty Principle relations for the black\nholes under consideration, and find a minimum length corresponding to a\ncharacteristic energy scale of the order of the fundamental gravitational mass\n$m_D$ in $D>3$. For $D=1$ we instead find the uncertainty due to the horizon\nfluctuations has the same form as the usual Heisenberg contribution, and\ntherefore no fundamental scale exists.\n", "  The rate of the trace distance is used to evaluate quantum speed-up for\narbitrary mixed states. Compared with some present methods, the approach based\non trace distance can provide an optimal bound to the speed of the evolution.\nThe dynamical transition from no speed-up region to speed-up region takes on in\nthe spontaneous decay of an two-level atom with detuning. The evolution is\ncharacteristic of the alternating behavior between quantum speed-up and\nspeed-down in the strong system-reservoir coupling regime. Under the\noff-resonance condition, the dynamical evolution can be accelerated for short\nprevious times and then decelerated to a normal process either in the weak or\nstrong coupling regime. From the time-energy uncertainty relation, we\ndemonstrate that the potential capacity for quantum speed-up evolution is\nclosely related to the energy flow-back from the reservoir to the system. The\nnegative decay rate for short time intervals leads to the speed-up process\nwhere the photons previously emitted by the atom are reabsorbed at a later\ntime. The values of the spontaneous decay rate becomes positive after a long\nenough time, which results in the normal evolution with no speed-up potential.\n", "  Two of the key properties of quantum physics are the no-signaling principle\nand the Grover search lower bound. That is, despite admitting\nstronger-than-classical correlations, quantum mechanics does not imply\nsuperluminal signaling, and despite a form of exponential parallelism, quantum\nmechanics does not imply polynomial-time brute force solution of NP-complete\nproblems. Here, we investigate the degree to which these two properties are\nconnected. We examine four classes of deviations from quantum mechanics, for\nwhich we draw inspiration from the literature on the black hole information\nparadox. We show that in these models, the physical resources required to send\na superluminal signal scale polynomially with the resources needed to speed up\nGrover's algorithm. Hence the no-signaling principle is equivalent to the\ninability to solve NP-hard problems efficiently by brute force within the\nclasses of theories analyzed.\n", "  We study mechanisms that allow one to synchronize the quantum phase of two\nqubits relative to a fixed basis. Starting from one qubit in a fixed reference\nstate and the other in an unknown state, we find that contrary to the\nimpossibility of perfect quantum cloning, the quantum-phase can be synchronized\nperfectly through a joined unitary operation. When both qubits are initially in\na pure unknown state, perfect quantum-phase synchronization through unitary\noperations becomes impossible. In this situation we determine the maximum\naverage quantum-phase synchronization fidelity, the distribution of relative\nphases and fidelities, and identify optimal quantum circuits that achieve this\nmaximum fidelity. A subset of these optimal quantum circuits enable perfect\nquantum-phase synchronization for a class of unknown initial states restricted\nto the equatorial plane of the Bloch sphere.\n", "  We study the ground-state cooling of a mechanical oscillator linearly coupled\nto the charge of a quantum dot inserted between a normal metal and a\nsuperconducting contact. Such a system can be realized, e.g., by a suspended\ncarbon nanotube quantum dot with a capacitive coupling to a gate contact.\nFocusing on the subgap transport regime, we analyze the inelastic Andreev\nreflections which drive the resonator to a nonequilibrium state. For small\ncoupling, we obtain that vibration-assisted reflections can occur through two\ndistinct interference paths. The interference determines the ratio between the\nrates of absorption and emission of vibrational energy quanta. We show that\nground-state cooling of the mechanical oscillator can be achieved for many of\nthe oscillator's modes simultaneously or for single modes selectively,\ndepending on the experimentally tunable coupling to the superconductor.\n", "  Based on first-principles calculations and tight-binding model analysis, we\npropose that black phosphorus (BP) can host a three-dimensional topological\nnode-line semimetal state under pressure when spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is\nignored. A closed topological node line exists in the first Brillouin zone (BZ)\nnear the Fermi energy, which is protected by the coexistence of time-reversal\nand spatial inversion symmetry with band inversion driven by pressure.\nDrumhead-like surface states have been obtained on the beard (100) surface. Due\nto the weak intrinsic SOC of phosphorus atom, a band gap less than 10 meV is\nopened along the node line in the presence of SOC and the surface states are\nalmost unaffected by SOC.\n", "  We consider the real-time evolution of a strongly coupled system of lattice\nfermions whose dynamics is driven entirely by dissipative Lindblad processes,\nwith linear or quadratic quantum jump operators. The fermion 2-point functions\nobey a closed set of differential equations, which can be solved with linear\nalgebra methods. The staggered occupation order parameter of the t-V model\ndecreases exponentially during the dissipative time evolution. The structure\nfactor associated with the various Fourier modes shows the slowing down of\nlow-momentum modes, which is due to particle number conservation. The processes\nwith nearest-neighbor-dependent Lindblad operators have a decay rate that is\nproportional to the coordination number of the spatial lattice.\n", "  We study a novel class of numerical integrators, the adapted nested\nforce-gradient schemes, used within the molecular dynamics step of the Hybrid\nMonte Carlo (HMC) algorithm. We test these methods in the Schwinger model on\nthe lattice, a well known benchmark problem. We derive the analytical basis of\nnested force-gradient type methods and demonstrate the advantage of the\nproposed approach, namely reduced computational costs compared with other\nnumerical integration schemes in HMC.\n", "  The two-dimensional superconductor formed at the interface between the\ncomplex oxides, lanthanum aluminate (LAO) and strontium titanate (STO) has\nseveral intriguing properties that set it apart from conventional\nsuperconductors. Most notably, an electric field can be used to tune its\ncritical temperature (T$_c$), revealing a dome-shaped phase diagram reminiscent\nof high T$_c$ superconductors. So far, experiments with oxide interfaces have\nmeasured quantities which probe only the magnitude of the superconducting order\nparameter and are not sensitive to its phase. Here, we perform phase-sensitive\nmeasurements by realizing the first superconducting quantum interference\ndevices (SQUIDs) at the LAO/STO interface. Furthermore, we develop a new\nparadigm for the creation of superconducting circuit elements, where local\ngates enable in-situ creation and control of Josephson junctions. These\ngate-defined SQUIDs are unique in that the entire device is made from a single\nsuperconductor with purely electrostatic interfaces between the superconducting\nreservoir and the weak link. We complement our experiments with numerical\nsimulations and show that the low superfluid density of this interfacial\nsuperconductor results in a large, gate-controllable kinetic inductance of the\nSQUID. Our observation of robust quantum interference opens up a new pathway to\nunderstand the nature of superconductivity at oxide interfaces.\n", "  In this paper we study one-dimensional conformal field theory at finite\ntemperature dual to the two-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime in the Rindler\ncoordinates. We show that conformal symmetry for thermal two-point functions\nmanifests itself in a form of recurrence relations in the complex frequency\nspace. It is discussed that all the real-time two-point functions are given by\nsolutions to the recurrence relations.\n", "  Strongly coupled quantum dot-cavity systems provide a non-linear\nconfiguration of hybridized light-matter states with promising quantum-optical\napplications. Here, we investigate the coherent interaction between strong\nlaser pulses and quantum dot-cavity polaritons. Resonant excitation of\npolaritonic states and their interaction with phonons allow us to observe\ncoherent Rabi oscillations and Ramsey fringes. Furthermore, we demonstrate\ncomplete coherent control of a quantum dot-photonic crystal cavity based\nquantum-bit. By controlling the excitation power and phase in a two-pulse\nexcitation scheme we achieve access to the full Bloch sphere. Quantum-optical\nsimulations are in good agreement with our experiments and provide insight into\nthe decoherence mechanisms.\n", "  At dry and clean material junctions of rigid materials the corrugation of the\nsliding energy landscape is dominated by variations of Pauli repulsions. These\noccur when electron clouds centered around atoms in adjacent layers overlap as\nthey slide across each other. In such cases there exists a direct relation\nbetween interfacial surface (in)commensurability and superlubricity, a\nfrictionless and wearless tribological state. The Registry Index is a purely\ngeometrical parameter that quantifies the degree of interlayer\ncommensurability, thus providing a simple and intuitive method for the\nprediction of sliding energy landscapes at rigid material interfaces. In the\npresent study, we extend the applicability of the Registry Index to\nnon-parallel surfaces, using a model system of nanotubes motion on flat\nhexagonal materials. Our method successfully reproduces sliding energy\nlandscapes of carbon nanotubes on Graphene calculated using a Lennard-Jones\ntype and the Kolmogorov-Crespi interlayer potentials. Furthermore, it captures\nthe sliding energy corrugation of a boron nitride nanotube on hexagonal boron\nnitride calculated using the h-BN ILP. Finally, we use the Registry Index to\npredict the sliding energy landscapes of the heterogeneous junctions of a\ncarbon nanotubes on hexagonal boron nitride and of boron nitride nanotubes on\ngraphene that are shown to exhibit a significantly reduced corrugation. For\nsuch rigid interfaces this is expected to be manifested by superlubric motion.\n", "  The introduction and control of ferromagnetism in graphene opens up a range\nof new directions for fundamental and applied studies. Several approaches have\nbeen pursued so far, such as introduction of defects, functionalization with\nadatoms, and shaping of graphene into nanoribbons with well-defined zigzag\nedges. A more robust and less invasive method utilizes the introduction of an\nexchange interaction by a ferromagnetic insulator in proximity with graphene.\n  Here we present a direct measurement of the exchange interaction in room\ntemperature ferromagnetic graphene. We study the spin transport in exfoliated\ngraphene on a yttrium-iron-garnet substrate where the observed spin precession\nclearly indicates the presence and strength of an exchange field that is an\nunambiguous evidence of induced ferromagnetism. We describe the results with a\nmodified Bloch diffusion equation and extract an average exchange field of the\norder of 0.2 T. Further, we demonstrate that a proximity induced 2D ferromagnet\ncan efficiently modulate a spin current by controlling the direction of the\nexchange field. These results can create a building block for magnetic-gate\ntuneable spin transport in one-atom-thick spintronic devices.\n", "  We investigate the influence of the photon statistics on the excitation\ndynamics of a single two level system. A single semiconductor quantum dot\nrepresents the two level system and is resonantly excited either with coherent\nlaser light, or excited with chaotic light, with photon statistics\ncorresponding to that of thermal radiation. Experimentally, we observe a\nreduced absorption cross-section under chaotic excitation in the steady-state.\nIn the transient regime, the Rabi oscillations observable under coherent\nexcitation disappear under chaotic excitation. Likewise, in the emission\nspectrum the well-known Mollow triplet, which we observe under coherent drive,\ndisappears under chaotic excitation. Our observations are fully consistent with\ntheoretical predictions based on the semi-classical Bloch equation approach.\n", "  A quark propagating through the quark gluon plasma and scattering off the\nthermal gluons can radiate photons in states with definite angular momentum and\nmagnetic helicity. These states, known as the Chandrasekhar-Kendall states, are\neigenstates of the curl operator and have a non-trivial topology. I compute\nspectrum of these states in the ultrarelativistic limit and study its\nproperties.\n", "  We investigate here the question raised in literature about the correct\nexpression for the electromagnetic field-momentum, especially when static\nfields are involved. For this we examine a couple of simple but intriguing\ncases. First we consider a system configuration in which electromagnetic field\nmomentum is present even though the system is static. We trace the\nelectromagnetic momentum to be present in the form of a continuous transport of\nelectromagnetic energy from one part of the system to another, without causing\nany net change in the energy of the system. In a second case we show that the\nelectromagnetic momentum is nil irrespective of whether the charged system is\nstationary or in motion, even though the electromagnetic energy is present\nthroughout. We demonstrate that the conventional formulation of electromagnetic\nfield-momentum describes the systems consistently without any real\ncontradictions. Here we also make exposition of a curiosity where\nelectromagnetic energy decreases when the charged system gains velocity. Then\nwe discuss the more general question that has been raised -- Are the\nconventional formulas for energy-momentum of electromagnetic fields valid for\nall cases? Or more specifically, in the case of so-called \"bound fields,\" do we\nneed to change over to some modified definitions which have made their\nappearance even in standard text books? We show that in all cases it is only\nthe conventional formulas which lead to results consistent with the rest of\nphysics, including the special theory of relativity, and that any proposed\nmodifications are thus superfluous.\n", "  Recent observations of Reticulum II have uncovered an overabundance of\nr-process elements, compared to similar ultra-faint dwarf spheroidal galaxies\n(UFDs). Because the metallicity and star formation history of Reticulum II\nappear consistent with all known UFDs, the high r-process abundance of\nReticulum II suggests enrichment through a single, rare event, such as a double\nneutron star (NS) merger. However, we note that this scenario is extremely\nunlikely, as binary stellar evolution models require significant supernova\nnatal kicks to produce NS-NS or NS-black hole mergers, and these kicks would\nefficiently remove compact binary systems from the weak gravitational\npotentials of UFDs. We examine alternative mechanisms for the production of\nr-process elements in UFDs, including a novel mechanism wherein NSs in regions\nof high dark matter density implode after accumulating a black-hole-forming\nmass of dark matter. We find that r-process proto-material ejection by tidal\nforces, when a single neutron star implodes into a black hole, can occur at a\nrate matching the r-process abundance of both Reticulum II and the Milky Way.\nRemarkably, dark matter models which collapse a single neutron star in observed\nUFDs also solve the missing pulsar problem in the Milky Way Galactic center. We\npropose tests specific to dark matter r-process production which may uncover,\nor rule out, this model.\n", "  Disagreement and conflict are a fact of social life and considerably affect\nour well-being and productivity. Such negative interactions are rarely\nexplicitly declared and recorded and this makes them hard for scientists to\nstudy. We overcome this challenge by investigating the patterns in the timing\nand configuration of contributions to a large online collaboration community.\nWe analyze sequences of reverts of contributions to Wikipedia, the largest\nonline encyclopedia, and investigate how often and how fast they occur compared\nto a null model that randomizes the order of actions to remove any systematic\nclustering. We find evidence that individuals systematically attack the same\nperson and attack back their attacker; both of these interactions occur at a\nfaster response rate than expected. We also establish that individuals come to\ndefend an attack victim but we do not find evidence that attack victims \"pay it\nforward\" or that attackers collude to attack the same individual. We further\nfind that high-status contributors are more likely to attack many others\nserially, status equals are more likely to revenge attacks back, while attacks\nby lower-status contributors trigger attacks forward; yet, it is the\nlower-status contributors who also come forward to defend third parties. The\nmethod we use can be applied to other large-scale temporal communication and\ncollaboration networks to identify the existence of negative social\ninteractions and other social processes.\n", "  We present a numerical model for uniformly rotating superfluid neutron stars,\nfor the first time with realistic microphysics including entrainment, in a\nfully general relativistic framework. We compute stationary and axisymmetric\nconfigurations of neutron stars composed of two fluids, namely superfluid\nneutrons and charged particles (protons and electrons), rotating with different\nrates around a common axis. Both fluids are coupled by entrainment, a\nnon-dissipative interaction which in case of a non-vanishing relative velocity\nbetween the fluids, causes the fluid momenta being not aligned with the\nrespective fluid velocities. We extend the formalism by Comer and Joynt (2003)\nin order to calculate the equation of state (EoS) and entrainment parameters\nfor an arbitrary relative velocity. The resulting entrainment matrix fulfills\nall necessary sum rules and in the limit of small relative velocity our results\nagree with Fermi liquid theory ones, derived to lowest order in the velocity.\nThis formalism is applied to two new nuclear equations of state which are\nimplemented in the numerical model. We are able to obtain precise equilibrium\nconfigurations. Resulting density profiles and moments of inertia are discussed\nemploying both EoSs, showing the impact of entrainment and the dependence on\nthe EoS.\n", "  We consider reheating in a class of asymptotically safe quantum field\ntheories recently studied in \\cite{Litim:2014uca, Litim:2015iea}. These\ntheories allow for an inflationary phase in the very early universe. Inflation\nends with a period of reheating. Since the models contain many scalar fields\nwhich are intrinsically coupled to the inflaton there is the possibility of\nparametric resonance instability in the production of these fields, and the\ndanger that the induced curvature fluctuations will become too large. Here we\nshow that the parametric instability indeed arises, and that hence the energy\ntransfer from the inflaton condensate to fluctuating fields is rapid. Demanding\nthat the curvature fluctuations induced by the parametrically amplified entropy\nmodes do not exceed the upper observational bounds puts a lower bound on the\nnumber of fields which the model of Ref.~\\cite{Litim:2014uca, Litim:2015iea}\nmust contain. This bound also depends on the total number of e-foldings of the\ninflationary phase.\n", "  CP-odd invariants provide a basis independent way of studying the CP\nproperties of Lagrangians. We propose powerful methods for constructing basis\ninvariants and determining whether they are CP-odd or CP-even, then\nsystematically construct all of the simplest CP-odd invariants up to a given\norder, finding many new ones. The CP-odd invariants are valid for general\npotentials when expressed in a standard form. We then apply our results to\nscalar potentials involving three (or six) Higgs fields which form irreducible\ntriplets under a discrete symmetry, including invariants for both explicit as\nwell as spontaneous CP violation. The considered cases include one triplet of\nStandard Model (SM) gauge singlet scalars, one triplet of SM Higgs doublets,\ntwo triplets of SM singlets, and two triplets of SM Higgs doublets. For each\ncase we study the potential symmetric under one of the simplest discrete\nsymmetries with irreducible triplet representations, namely $A_4$, $S_4$,\n$\\Delta(27)$ or $\\Delta(54)$, as well as the infinite classes of discrete\nsymmetries $\\Delta(3n^2)$ or $\\Delta(6n^2)$.\n", "  Stokes vectors and Discrete Wigner functions (DWF) provide two alternate ways\nof representing the polarization state of multiphoton systems. The Stokes\nvector associated with a n-photon polarization state is unique, and its\nMinkowski squared norm provides a direct way of quantifying entanglement\nthrough n-concurrence. However, the quantification of entanglement from DWF is\nnot straight forward. The DWF associated with a given quantum state is not\nunique but depends on the way in which basis vectors are assigned to various\nlines in the phase space. For a Hilbert space of dimension N, there exists N\nN+1 such possible assignments. While a given DWF corresponds to a unique Stokes\nvector, the converse is not true. In the present work, we show that, for each\nparticular assignment called a quantum net, there exist a unique Hadamard\nmatrix which relates the Stokes vector to the corresponding DWF. This method\nprovides an elegant and direct method of constructing the DWFs from the Stokes\nvector for every possible choice of the quantum net. Using these results, we\nderive the relationship between the Stokes vector of a spin-flipped state and\nthe DWF. Finally, we also present a method to express the Minkowskian squared\nnorm of the Stokes vector directly in terms of the DWF.\n", "  We investigate the propagation characteristics of two counter propagating\ndust acoustic solitary waves (DASWs) undergoing a head-on collision, in the\npresence of strong coupling between micron sized charged dust particles in a\ncomplex plasma. A coupled set of nonlinear dynamical equations describing the\nevolution of the two DASWs using the extended Poincar\\'e-Lighthill-Kuo\nperturbation technique is derived. The nature and extent of post collision\nphase-shifts of these solitary waves are studied over a wide range of dusty\nplasma parameters in a strongly and a weakly coupled medium. We find a\nsignificant change in the nature and amount of phase delay in the strongly\ncoupled regime as compared to a weakly coupled regime. The phase shift is seen\nto change its sign beyond a threshold value of compressibility of the medium\nfor a given set of dusty plasma parameters.\n", "  Quantum error correcting codes (QECCs) in quantum communi- cation systems has\nbeen known to exhibit improved performance with the use of error-free\nentanglement bits (ebits). In practical situations, ebits inevitably suffer\nfrom errors, and as a result, the error-correcting capability of the code is\ndiminished. Prior studies have proposed two different schemes as a solu- tion.\nOne uses only one QECC to correct errors on the receiver's side (i.e., Bob) and\non the sender's side (i.e., Alice). The other uses different QECCs on each\nside. In this paper, we present a method to correct errors on both sides by\nusing single nonadditive Entanglement-assisted codeword stabilized quantum\nerror correcting code(EACWS QECC). We use the property that the number of\neffective error patterns decreases as much as the number of ebits. This\nproperty results in a greater number of logical codewords using the same number\nof physical qubits.\n", "  Black holes that have nearly evaporated are often thought of as small\nobjects, due to their tiny exterior area. However, the horizon bounds large\nspacelike hypersurfaces. A compelling geometric perspective on the evolution of\nthe interior geometry was recently shown to be provided by a generally\ncovariant definition of the volume inside a black hole using maximal surfaces.\nIn this article, we expand on previous results and show that finding the\nmaximal surfaces in an arbitrary spherically symmetric spacetime is equivalent\nto a 1+1 geodesic problem. We then study the effect of Hawking radiation on the\nvolume by computing the volume of maximal surfaces inside the apparent horizon\nof an evaporating black hole as a function of time at infinity: while the area\nis shrinking, the volume of these surfaces grows monotonically with advanced\ntime, up to when the horizon has reached Planckian dimensions. The physical\nrelevance of these results for the information paradox and the remnant\nscenarios are discussed.\n", "  We construct a rotating thin-shell wormhole using a Myers-Perry black hole in\nfive dimensions, using the Darmois-Israel junction conditions. The stability of\nthe wormhole is analyzed under perturbations. We find that exotic matter is\nrequired at the throat of the wormhole to keep it stable. Our analysis shows\nthat stability of the rotating thin-shell wormhole is possible if suitable\nparameter values are chosen.\n", "  We show that solutions to fermion sign problems in the CT-INT formulation can\nbe extended to systems involving fermions interacting with dynamical quantum\nspins. While these sign problems seem unsolvable in the auxiliary field\napproach, solutions emerge in the worldline representation of quantum spins.\nCombining the idea with meron-cluster methods, we are able to extend the\nsolvable models even further. We demonstrate these novel solutions to sign\nproblems by considering several examples of strongly correlated systems.\n", "  We consider the description of quantum noise within the framework of the\nstandard Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics applied to a composite\nsystem environment setting. Averaging over the environmental degrees of freedom\nleads to a stochastic quantum dynamics, described by equations complying with\nthe constraints arising from the statistical structure of quantum mechanics.\nSimple examples are considered in the framework of open system dynamics\ndescribed within a master equation approach, pointing in particular to the\nappearance of the phenomenon of decoherence and to the relevance of quantum\ncorrelation functions of the environment in the determination of the action of\nquantum noise.\n", "  We study effective actions for simultaneous breaking of space-time and\ninternal symmetries. Novel features arise due to the mixing of Goldstone modes\nunder the broken symmetries which, in contrast to the usual Adler's zero, leads\nto non-vanishing soft limits. Such scenarios are common for spontaneously\nbroken SCFT's. We explicitly test these soft theorems for $\\mathcal{N}=4$ sYM\nin the Coulomb branch both perturbatively and non-perturbatively. We explore\nthe soft constraints systematically utilizing recursion relations. In the pure\ndilaton sector of a general CFT, we show that all amplitudes up to order $s^{n}\n\\sim \\partial^{2n}$ are completely determined in terms of the $k$-point\namplitudes at order $s^k$ with $k \\leq n$. Terms with at most one derivative\nacting on each dilaton insertion are completely fixed and coincide with those\nappearing in the conformal DBI, i.e. DBI in AdS. With maximal supersymmetry,\nthe effective actions are further constrained, leading to new\nnon-renormalization theorems. In particular, the effective action is fixed up\nto eight derivatives in terms of just one unknown four-point coefficient and\none more coefficient for ten-derivative terms. Finally, we also study the\ninterplay between scale and conformal invariance in this context.\n", "  We revisit the consequences of the heavy-quark spin symmetry for the possible\nspin partners of the $X(3872)$. We confirm that, if the $X(3872)$ were a\n$D\\bar{D}^*$ molecular state with the quantum numbers $J^{PC}=1^{++}$, then in\nthe strict heavy-quark limit there should exist three more hadronic molecules\ndegenerate with the $X(3872)$, with the quantum numbers $0^{++}$, $1^{+-}$, and\n$2^{++}$ in line with previous results reported in the literature. We\ndemonstrate that this result is robust with respect to the inclusion of the\none-pion exchange interaction between the $D$ mesons. However, this is true\nonly if all relevant partial waves as well as particle channels which are\ncoupled via the pion-exchange potential are taken into account. Otherwise, the\nheavy-quark symmetry is destroyed even in the heavy-quark limit. Finally, we\nsolve the coupled-channel problem in the $2^{++}$ channel with nonperturbative\npions beyond the heavy-quark limit and, contrary to the findings of previous\ncalculations with perturbative pions, find for the spin-2 partner of the\n$X(3872)$ a significant shift of the mass as well as a width of the order of 50\nMeV.\n", "  We connect two recent advances in the stochastic analysis of nonequilibrium\nsystems: the (loose) uncertainty principle for the currents, which states that\nstatistical errors are bounded by thermodynamic dissipation; and the analysis\nof thermodynamic consistency of the currents in the light of symmetries.\nEmploying the large deviation techniques presented in [Gingrich et al., Phys.\nRev. Lett. 2016] and [Pietzonka et al., Phys. Rev. E 2016], we provide a short\nproof of the loose uncertainty principle, and prove a tighter uncertainty\nrelation for a class of thermodynamically consistent currents $J$. Our bound\ninvolves a measure of partial entropy production, that we interpret as the\nleast amount of entropy that a system sustaining current $J$ can possibly\nproduce, at a given steady state. We provide a complete mathematical discussion\nof quadratic bounds which allows to determine which are optimal, and finally we\nargue that the relationship for the Fano factor of the entropy production rate\n$\\mathrm{var}\\, \\sigma / \\mathrm{mean}\\, \\sigma \\geq 2$ is the most significant\nrealization of the loose bound. We base our analysis both on the formalism of\ndiffusions, and of Markov jump processes in the light of Schnakenberg's cycle\nanalysis.\n", "  Unsupervised learning is a discipline of machine learning which aims at\ndiscovering patterns in big data sets or classifying the data into several\ncategories without being trained explicitly. We show that unsupervised learning\ntechniques can be readily used to identify phases and phases transitions of\nmany body systems. Starting with raw spin configurations of a prototypical\nIsing model, we use principal component analysis to extract relevant low\ndimensional representations the original data and use clustering analysis to\nidentify distinct phases in the feature space. This approach successfully finds\nout physical concepts such as order parameter and structure factor to be\nindicators of the phase transition. We discuss future prospects of discovering\nmore complex phases and phase transitions using unsupervised learning\ntechniques.\n", "  The elliptic flow of electrons from heavy-flavour hadron decays at\nmid-rapidity ($|y|$ $<$ 0.7) is measured in Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm\nNN}} = 2.76$ TeV with ALICE at the LHC. The particle azimuthal distribution\nwith respect to the reaction plane can be parametrized with a Fourier\nexpansion, where the second coefficient ($v_{\\rm 2}$) represents the elliptic\nflow. The $v_{\\rm 2}$ coefficient of inclusive electrons is measured in three\ncentrality classes (0-10%, 10-20% and 20-40%) with the event plane and the\nscalar product methods in the transverse momentum ($p_{\\rm T}$) intervals\n0.5-13 GeV/$c$ and 0.5-8 GeV/$c$, respectively. After subtracting the\nbackground, mainly from photon conversions and Dalitz decays of neutral mesons,\na positive $v_{\\rm 2}$ of electrons from heavy-flavour hadron decays is\nobserved in all centrality classes, with a maximum significance of $5.9\\sigma$\nin the interval $2 <$ $p_{\\rm T}$ $<$ 2.5 GeV/$c$ in semi-central collisions\n(20-40%). The value of $v_{\\rm 2}$ decreases towards more central collisions at\nlow and intermediate $p_{\\rm T}$ (0.5 $<$ $p_{\\rm T}$ $<$ 3 GeV/$c$). The\n$v_{\\rm 2}$ of electrons from heavy-flavour hadron decays at mid-rapidity is\nfound to be similar to the one of muons from heavy-flavour hadron decays at\nforward rapidity (2.5 $<$ $y$ $<$ 4). The results are described within\nuncertainties by model calculations including substantial elastic interactions\nof heavy quarks with an expanding strongly-interacting medium.\n", "  We present Raman and terahertz absorbance spectra of methylammonium lead\nhalide single crystals (MAPbX3, X = I, Br, Cl) at temperatures between 80 and\n370 K. These results show good agreement with density-functional-theory phonon\ncalculations.1 Comparison of experimental spectra and calculated vibrational\nmodes enables confident assignment of most of the vibrational features between\n50 and 3500 cm-1. Reorientation of the methylammonium cations, unlocked in\ntheir cavities at the orthorhombic-to-tetragonal phase transition, plays a key\nrole in shaping the vibrational spectra of the different compounds.\nCalculations show that these dynamics effects split Raman peaks and create more\nstructure than predicted from the independent harmonic modes. This explains the\npresence of extra peaks in the experimental spectra that have been a source of\nconfusion in earlier studies. We discuss singular features, in particular the\ntorsional vibration of the C-N axis, which is the only molecular mode that is\nstrongly influenced by the size of the lattice. From analysis of the spectral\nlinewidths, we find that MAPbI3 shows exceptionally short phonon lifetimes,\nwhich can be linked to low lattice thermal conductivity. We show that optical\nrather than acoustic phonon scattering is likely to prevail at room temperature\nin these materials.\n", "  We initiated the program to look for new and simple forms for the\nfive-dimensional rotating squashed black holes by solving directly the equation\nof motion. In a recent paper, the metric ansatz of dimensional reduction along\nthe fifth spatial dimension was used to obtain a new but rather simple form for\nthe five-dimensional rotating uncharged black hole solution with squashed\nhorizons via solving the vacuum Einstein field equations. In this work, we\ncontinue to seek for another new but relatively simple form for the neutral\nrotating squashed black hole solution by using a different metric ansatz of\ntime-like dimensional reduction. We then find its relation to our previous\nsolution and investigate its thermodynamics by means of the counterterm method.\nCompared with the previous results given by the other author, both of our new\nmetric forms and their associated thermodynamic expressions are very concise\nand elegant. Both of two new forms for the neutral rotating squashed black hole\nsolution presented in this paper can be used as the seed to generate its\ncharged generalization in D=5 minimal supergravity.\n", "  We study the numerical bounds obtained using a conformal-bootstrap method -\nadvocated in ref. [1] but never implemented so far - where different points in\nthe plane of conformal cross ratios $z$ and $\\bar z$ are sampled. In contrast\nto the most used method based on derivatives evaluated at the symmetric point\n$z=\\bar z =1/2$, we can consistently \"integrate out\" higher-dimensional\noperators and get a reduced simpler, and faster to solve, set of bootstrap\nequations. We test this \"effective\" bootstrap by studying the 3D Ising and\n$O(n)$ vector models and bounds on generic 4D CFTs, for which extensive results\nare already available in the literature. We also determine the scaling\ndimensions of certain scalar operators in the $O(n)$ vector models, with\n$n=2,3,4$, which have not yet been computed using bootstrap techniques.\n", "  We propose a novel scenario to produce abundant primordial black holes (PBHs)\nin new inflation which is a second phase of a double inflation in the\nsupergravity frame work. In our model, some preinflation phase before the new\ninflation is assumed and it would be responsible for the primordial curvature\nperturbations on the cosmic microwave background scale, while the new inflation\nproduces only the small scale perturbations. Our new inflation model has\nlinear, quadratic, and cubic terms in its potential and PBH production\ncorresponds with its flat inflection point. The linear term can be interpreted\nto come from a supersymmetry-breaking sector, and with this assumption, the\nvanishing cosmological constant condition after inflation and the flatness\ncondition for the inflection point can be consistently satisfied.\n", "  We analyse the Einstein-Cartan gravity in its standard form cal-R = R +\ncal-K^2, where cal-R and R are the Ricci scalar curvatures in the\nEinstein-Cartan and Einstein gravity, respectively, and cal-K^2 is the\nquadratic contribution of torsion in terms of the contorsion tensor cal-K. We\ntreat torsion as an external (or a background) field and show that the\ncontribution of torsion to the Einstein equations can be interpreted in terms\nof the torsion energy-momentum tensor, local conservation of which in a curved\nspacetime with an arbitrary metric or an arbitrary gravitational field demands\na proportionality of the torsion energy--momentum tensor to a metric tensor, a\ncovariant derivative of which vanishes because of the metricity condition. This\nallows to claim that torsion can serve as origin for vacuum energy density,\ngiven by cosmological constant or dark energy density in the Universe. This is\na model-independent result may explain a small value of cosmological constant,\nwhich is a long--standing problem of cosmology. We show that the obtained\nresult is valid also in the Poincare' gauge gravitational theory by Kibble (T.\nW. B. Kibble, J. Math. Phys. 2, 212 (1961)), where the Einstein-Hilbert action\ncan be represented in the same form cal-R = R + cal-K^2.\n", "  Small-$x$ logarithmic enhancements arising from high-energy gluon emissions\naffect both the evolution of collinearly-factorized parton densities and\npartonic coefficient functions. With the higher collider energy reached by the\nLHC, the prospect of a future high-energy collider, and the recent\ndeep-inelastic scattering (DIS) results at small-$x$ from HERA, providing\nphenomenological tools for performing small-$x$ resummation has become of great\nrelevance. In this paper we discuss a framework to perform small-$x$\nresummation for both parton evolution and partonic coefficient functions and we\ndescribe its implementation in a computer code named High-Energy Large\nLogarithms (HELL). We present resummed and matched results for the DGLAP\nsplitting functions and, as a proof of principle, for the massless structure\nfunctions in DIS.\n", "  We have developed a novel two-layer anti-reflection (AR) coating method for\nlarge-diameter infrared (IR) filters made of alumina, for the use at cryogenic\ntemperatures in millimeter wave measurements. Thermally- sprayed mullite and\npolyimide foam (Skybond Foam) are used as the AR material. An advantage of the\nSkybond Foam is that the index of refraction is chosen between 1.1 and 1.7 by\nchanging the filling factor. Combination with mullite is suitable for wide-band\nmillimeter wave measurements with sufficient IR cutoff capability. We present\nthe material properties, fabrication of a large-diameter IR filter made of\nalumina with this AR coating method, and characterizations at cryogenic\ntemperatures. This technology can be applied to a low-temperature receiver\nsystem with a large-diameter focal plane for next-generation cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB) polarization measurements, such as POLARBEAR-2 (PB-2).\n", "  When gravity is quantized, there inevitably exist quantum gravitational\nvacuum fluctuations which induce quadrupole moments in gravitationally\npolarizable objects and produce a quantum correction to the classical Newtonian\ninteraction between them. Here, based upon linearized quantum gravity and the\nleading-order perturbation theory, we study, from a quantum field-theoretic\nprospect, this quantum correction between a pair of gravitationally polarizable\nobjects treated as two-level harmonic oscillators. We find that the interaction\npotential behaves like $r^{-11}$ in the retarded regime and $r^{-10}$ in the\nnear regime. Our result agrees with what was recently obtained in different\napproaches. Our study seems to indicate that linearized quantum gravity is\nrobust in dealing with quantum gravitational effects at low energies.\n", "  We compute the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy within two-dimensional\nRashba models. For a ferromagnetic free-electron Rashba model, the magnetic\nanisotropy is exactly zero regardless of the strength of the Rashba coupling,\nunless only the lowest band is occupied. For this latter case, the model\npredicts in-plane anisotropy. For a more realistic Rashba model with finite\nband width, the magnetic anisotropy evolves from in-plane to perpendicular and\nback to in-plane as bands are progressively filled. This evolution agrees with\nfirst-principles calculations on the interfacial anisotropy, suggesting that\nthe Rashba model captures energetics leading to anisotropy originating from the\ninterface provided that the model takes account of the finite Brillouin zone.\nThe results show that the electron density modulation by doping or an external\nvoltage is more important for voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy than the\nmodulation of the Rashba parameter.\n", "  Community detection in networks is one of the most popular topics of modern\nnetwork science. Communities, or clusters, are usually groups of vertices\nhaving higher probability of being connected to each other than to members of\nother groups, though other patterns are possible. Identifying communities is an\nill-defined problem. There are no universal protocols on the fundamental\ningredients, like the definition of community itself, nor on other crucial\nissues, like the validation of algorithms and the comparison of their\nperformances. This has generated a number of confusions and misconceptions,\nwhich undermine the progress in the field. We offer a guided tour through the\nmain aspects of the problem. We also point out strengths and weaknesses of\npopular methods, and give directions to their use.\n", "  Using the Landau-Zener-St\\\"uckelberg-Majorana-type (LZSM) semiclassical\napproach, we study both graphene and a thin film of a Weyl semimetal subjected\nto a strong AC electromagnetic field. The spectrum of quasi energies in the\nWeyl semimetal turns out to be similar to that of a graphene sheet. Earlier it\nhas been predicted qualitatively that the transport properties of\nstrongly-irradiated graphene oscillate as a function of the radiation intensity\n[S.V. Syzranov et al., Phys. Rev. B 88, 241112 (2013)]. Here we obtain rigorous\nquantitative results for a driven linear conductance of graphene and a thin\nfilm of a Weyl semimetal. The exact quantitative structure of oscillations\nexhibits two contributions. The first one is a manifestation of the\nRamsauer-Townsend effect, while the second contribution is a consequence of the\nLZSM interference defining the spectrum of quasienergies.\n", "  We note that building a magnetic Laplacian from the Markov transition matrix,\nrather than the graph adjacency matrix, yields several benefits for the\nmagnetic eigenmaps algorithm. The two largest benefits are that the embedding\nbecomes more stable as a function of the rotation parameter g, and the\nprincipal eigenvector of the magnetic Laplacian now converges to the page rank\nof the network as a function of diffusion time. We show empirically that this\nnormalization improves the phase and real/imaginary embeddings of the\nlow-frequency eigenvectors of the magnetic Laplacian.\n", "  We explore the thermodynamic geometry of a simple system that models the\nbistable dynamics of nucleic acid hairpins in single molecule force-extension\nexperiments. Near equilibrium, optimal (minimum-dissipation) driving protocols\nare governed by a generalized linear response friction coefficient. Our\nanalysis and simulations demonstrate that the friction coefficient of the\ndriving protocols is sharply peaked at the interface between metastable\nregions, which leads to minimum-dissipation protocols that drive rapidly within\na metastable basin, but then linger longest at the interface, giving thermal\nfluctuations maximal time to kick the system over the barrier. Intuitively, the\nsame principle applies generically in free energy estimation (both in steered\nmolecular dynamics simulations and in single-molecule experiments), provides a\ndesign principle for the construction of thermodynamically efficient coupling\nbetween stochastic objects, and makes a prediction regarding the construction\nof evolved biomolecular motors.\n", "  By exhibiting a measurable bandgap and exotic valley physics,\natomically-thick tungsten disulfide (WS2) offers exciting prospects for\noptoelectronic applications. The synthesis of continuous WS2 films on other\ntwo-dimensional (2D) materials would greatly facilitate the implementation of\nnovel all-2D photoactive devices. In this work we demonstrate the scalable\ngrowth of WS2 on graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) via a chemical\nvapor deposition (CVD) approach. Spectroscopic and microscopic analysis reveal\nthat the film is bilayer-thick, with local monolayer inclusions.\nPhotoluminescence measurements show a remarkable conservation of polarization\nat room temperature peaking 74% for the entire WS2 film. Furthermore, we\npresent a scalable bottom-up approach for the design of photoconductive and\nphotoemitting patterns.\n", "  Context: in large-scale spatial surveys, the Point Spread Function (PSF)\nvaries across the instrument field of view (FOV). Local measurements of the\nPSFs are given by the isolated stars images. Yet, these estimates may not be\ndirectly usable for post-processings because of the observational noise and\npotentially the aliasing. Aims: given a set of aliased and noisy stars images\nfrom a telescope, we want to estimate well-resolved and noise-free PSFs at the\nobserved stars positions, in particular, exploiting the spatial correlation of\nthe PSFs across the FOV. Contributions: we introduce RCA (Resolved Components\nAnalysis) which is a noise-robust dimension reduction and super-resolution\nmethod based on matrix factorization. We propose an original way of using the\nPSFs spatial correlation in the restoration process through sparsity. The\nintroduced formalism can be applied to correlated data sets with respect to any\neuclidean parametric space. Results: we tested our method on simulated\nmonochromatic PSFs of Euclid telescope (launch planned for 2020). The proposed\nmethod outperforms existing PSFs restoration and dimension reduction methods.\nWe show that a coupled sparsity constraint on individual PSFs and their spatial\ndistribution yields a significant improvement on both the restored PSFs shapes\nand the PSFs subspace identification, in presence of aliasing. Perspectives:\nRCA can be naturally extended to account for the wavelength dependency of the\nPSFs.\n", "  We report abundances of elements from $_{26}$Fe to $_{40}$Zr in the cosmic\nradiation measured by the SuperTIGER (Trans-Iron Galactic Element Recorder)\ninstrument during 55 days of exposure on a long-duration balloon flight over\nAntarctica. These observations resolve elemental abundances in this charge\nrange with single-element resolution and good statistics.\n  These results support a model of cosmic-ray origin in which the source\nmaterial consists of a mixture of 19$^{+11}_{-6}$\\% material from massive stars\nand $\\sim$81\\% normal interstellar medium (ISM) material with solar system\nabundances. The results also show a preferential acceleration of refractory\nelements (found in interstellar dust grains) by a factor of $\\sim$4 over\nvolatile elements (found in interstellar gas) ordered by atomic mass (A). Both\nthe refractory and volatile elements show a mass-dependent enhancement with\nsimilar slopes.\n", "  We present a perturbative method for ab initio calculations of rotational and\nrovibrational effective Hamiltonians of both rigid and non-rigid molecules. Our\napproach is based on a curvilinear implementation of second order vibrational\nM{\\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory (VMP2) extended to include rotational\neffects via a second order contact transformation. Though more expensive, this\napproach is significantly more accurate than standard second order vibrational\nperturbation theory (VPT2) for systems that are poorly described to zeroth\norder by rectilinear normal mode harmonic oscillators. We apply this method and\ndemonstrate its accuracy on two molecules: Si$_2$C, a quasilinear triatomic\nwith significant bending anharmonicity, and CH$_3$NO$_2$, which contains a\ncompletely unhindered methyl rotor. In addition to these two examples, we\ndiscuss several key technical aspects of the method, including an efficient\nimplementation of Eckart and quasi-Eckart frame embedding that does not rely on\nnumerical finite differences.\n", "  In the modern understanding of turbulence, a central concept is the existence\nof cascades of excitations from large to small lengthscales, or vice-versa.\nThis concept was introduced in 1941 by Kolmogorov and Obukhov, and the\nphenomenon has since been observed in a variety of systems, including\ninterplanetary plasmas, supernovae, ocean waves, and financial markets. Despite\na lot of progress, quantitative understanding of turbulence remains a challenge\ndue to the interplay of many lengthscales that usually thwarts theoretical\nsimulations of realistic experimental conditions. Here we observe the emergence\nof a turbulent cascade in a weakly interacting homogeneous Bose gas, a quantum\nfluid that is amenable to a theoretical description on all relevant\nlengthscales. We prepare a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in an optical box,\ndrive it out of equilibrium with an oscillating force that pumps energy into\nthe system at the largest lengthscale, study the BEC's nonlinear response to\nthe periodic drive, and observe a gradual development of a cascade\ncharacterised by an isotropic power-law distribution in momentum space. We\nnumerically model our experiments using the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) and\nfind excellent agreement with the measurements. Our experiments establish the\nuniform Bose gas as a promising new platform for investigating many aspects of\nturbulence, including the interplay of vortex and wave turbulence and the\nrelative importance of quantum and classical effects.\n", "  Engineering a sensor system for detecting an extremely tiny signal such as\nthe gravitational-wave force is a very important subject in quantum physics. A\nmajor obstacle to this goal is that, in a simple detection setup, the\nmeasurement noise is lower bounded by the so-called standard quantum limit\n(SQL), which is originated from the intrinsic mechanical back-action noise.\nHence, the sensor system has to be carefully engineered so that it evades the\nback-action noise and eventually beats the SQL. In this paper, based on the\nwell-developed geometric control theory for classical disturbance decoupling\nproblem, we provide a general method for designing an auxiliary (coherent\nfeedback or direct interaction) controller for the sensor system to achieve the\nabove-mentioned goal. This general theory is applied to a typical\nopto-mechanical sensor system. Also, we demonstrate a controller design for a\npractical situation where several experimental imperfections are present.\n", "  We report a high-pressure transport study of the upper-critical field,\n$B_{c2}(T)$, of the topological superconductor Sr$_{0.15}$Bi$_2$Se$_3$ ($T_c =\n3.0$ K). $B_{c2}(T)$ was measured for magnetic fields directed along two\northogonal directions, $a$ and $a^*$, in the trigonal basal plane. While\nsuperconductivity is rapidly suppressed at the critical pressure $p_c \\sim 3.5$\nGPa, the pronounced two-fold basal-plane anisotropy $B_{c2}^a/B_{c2}^{a^*} =\n3.2$ at $T=0.3$ K, recently reported at ambient pressure (Pan et al., 2016), is\nreinforced and attains a value of $\\sim 5$ at the highest pressure (2.2 GPa).\nThe data reveal that the unconventional superconducting state with broken\nrotational symmetry is robust under pressure.\n", "  Dirac and Weyl materials refer to a class of solid materials which host\nlow-energy quasiparticle excitations that can be described by the Dirac and\nWeyl equations in relativistic quantum mechanics. Starting with the advent of\ngraphene as the first prominent example, these materials have been attracting\ntremendous interest owing to their novel fundamental properties as well as the\ngreat potential for applications. Here we introduce the basic concepts and\nnotions related to Dirac and Weyl materials and briefly review some recent\nworks in this field, particularly on the conceptual development and the\npossible spintronics/pseudospintronics applications.\n", "  We present the analysis of the first circumbinary planet microlensing event,\nOGLE-2007-BLG-349. This event has a strong planetary signal that is best fit\nwith a mass ratio of $q \\approx 3.4\\times10^{-4}$, but there is an additional\nsignal due to an additional lens mass, either another planet or another star.\nWe find acceptable light curve fits with two classes of models: 2-planet models\n(with a single host star) and circumbinary planet models. The light curve also\nreveals a significant microlensing parallax effect, which constrains the mass\nof the lens system to be $M_L \\approx 0.7 M_\\odot$. Hubble Space Telescope\nimages resolve the lens and source stars from their neighbors and indicate\nexcess flux due to the star(s) in the lens system. This is consistent with the\npredicted flux from the circumbinary models, where the lens mass is shared\nbetween two stars, but there is not enough flux to be consistent with the\n2-planet, 1-star models. So, only the circumbinary models are consistent with\nthe HST data. They indicate a planet of mass $m_c = 80\\pm 13\\,M_\\oplus$,\norbiting a pair of M-dwarfs with masses of $M_A = 0.41\\pm 0.07 M_\\odot$ and\n$M_B = 0.30\\pm 0.07 M_\\oplus$, which makes this the lowest mass circumbinary\nplanet system known. The ratio of the separation between the planet and the\ncenter-of-mass to the separations of the two stars is $\\sim 40$, so unlike most\nof the circumbinary planets found by Kepler, the planet does not orbit near the\nstability limit.\n", "  We introduce diagrammatic technique for Hubbard nonequilibrium Green\nfunctions (NEGF). The formulation is an extension of equilibrium considerations\nfor strongly correlated lattice models to description of current carrying\nmolecular junctions. Within the technique intra-system interactions are taken\ninto account exactly, while molecular coupling to contacts is used as a small\nparameter in perturbative expansion. We demonstrate the viability of the\napproach with numerical simulations for a generic junction model of quantum dot\ncoupled to two electron reservoirs.\n", "  1) Background: the budget of non-thermal energy in galaxy clusters is not\nwell constrained, owing to the observational and theoretical difficulties in\nstudying these diluted plasmas on large scales. 2) Method: we use recent\ncosmological simulations with complex physics in order to connect the emergence\nof non-thermal energy to the underlying evolution of gas and dark matter. 3)\nResults: the impact of non-thermal energy (e.g. cosmic rays, magnetic fields\nand turbulent motions) is found to increase in the outer region of galaxy\nclusters. Within numerical and theoretical uncertainties, turbulent motions\ndominate the budget of non-thermal energy in most of the cosmic volume. 4)\nConclusion: assessing the distribution non-thermal energy in galaxy clusters is\ncrucial to perform high-precision cosmology in the future. Constraining the\nlevel of non-thermal energy in cluster outskirts will improve our understanding\nof the acceleration of relativistic particles by cosmic shocks and of the\norigin of extragalactic magnetic fields.\n", "  The two orbital Hubbard model, with the electrons additionally coupled to a\ncomplex magnetic background, arises in the pyrochlore molybdates. The\nbackground involves local moments Hund's coupled to the electrons, driving\ndouble exchange ferromagnetism, and antiferromagnetic tendency arising from\ncompeting superexchange. The key scales include the Hubbard repulsion and the\nsuperexchange, both of which can be tuned in these materials, controlling phase\ntransitions from a ferromagnetic metal to a spin glass metal and then a spin\nglass (Mott) insulator. We provide a comprehensive description of the ground\nstate of this model using an unrestricted Hartree-Fock scheme implemented via a\nsimulated annealing procedure. We establish the metal-insulator transition line\nfor varying Hubbard interaction and superexchange. The orbital disorder already\npresent in the ferromagnetic case is further enhanced by antiferromagnetic\ncoupling and the resulting magnetic disorder. This suppresses the kinetic\nenergy and shifts the metal-insulator transition to lower Hubbard interaction.\nWe characterise the changing nature of the metal-insulator transition by\ntracking the magnetic and orbital correlations, the density of states, and the\noptical conductivity. The metal-insulator transition shows increasing\n'Anderson' character as the antiferromagnetic coupling is increased. This paper\nis focused on the ground state, a companion paper will discuss the finite\ntemperature physics involving magnetic and orbital thermal fluctuations.\n", "  The amplitude of Higgs-Higgs interaction is calculated in the Standard Model\nin the framework of the Sirlin's renormalization scheme in the unitary gauge.\nThe one-loop corrections for lambda, the constant of 4-chi interaction are\ncompared with the previous results of L. Durand et al. obtained on using the\ntechnique of the equivalence theorem, and in the different gauges.\n", "  We demonstrate that charge density wave (CDW) phase transition occurs on the\nsurface of electronically doped multilayer graphene when the Fermi level\napproaches the M points (also known as van Hove singularities where the density\nof states diverge) in the Brillouin zone of graphene band structure. The\noccurrence of such CDW phase transitions are supported by both the electrical\ntransport measurement and optical measurements in electrostatically doped\nmultilayer graphene. The CDW transition is accompanied with the sudden change\nof graphene channel resistance at T$_m$= 100K, as well as the splitting of\nRaman G peak (1580 cm$^{-1}$). The splitting of Raman G peak indicats the\nlifting of in-plane optical phonon branch degeneracy and the non-degenerate\nphonon branches are correlated to the lattice reconstructions of graphene --\nthe CDW phase transition.\n", "  As a basic mechanical parameter, Poisson's ratio ({\\nu}) measures the\nmechanical responses of solids against external loads. In rare cases, materials\nhave a negative Poisson's ratio (NPR), and present an interesting auxetic\neffect. That is, when a material is stretched in one direction, it will expand\nin the perpendicular direction. To design modern nanoscale electromechanical\ndevices with special functions, two dimensional (2D) auxetic materials are\nhighly desirable. In this work, based on first principles calculations, we\nrediscover the previously proposed {\\delta}-phosphorene ({\\delta}-P) nanosheets\n[Jie Guan et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 2014, 113, 046804] are good auxetic\nmaterials with a high NPR. The results show that the Young's modulus and\nPoisson's ratio of {\\delta}-P are all anisotropic. The NPR value along the\ngrooved direction is up to -0.267, which is much higher than the recently\nreported 2D auxetic materials. The auxetic effect of {\\delta}-P originated from\nits puckered structure is robust and insensitive to the number of layers due to\nweak interlayer interactions. Moreover, {\\delta}-P possesses good flexibility\nbecause of its relatively small Young's modulus and high critical crack strain.\nIf {\\delta}-P can be synthesized, these extraordinary properties would endow it\ngreat potential in designing low dimensional electromechanical devices.\n", "  We apply the convergent close-coupling (CCC) formalism to analyse the\nprocesses of laser assisted electron impact ionisation of He, and the\nattosecond time delay in the photodetachment of the H^{-} ion and the\nphotoionisation of He. Such time dependent atomic collision processes are of\nconsiderable interest as experimental measurements on the relevant timescale\n(attoseconds 10^{-18} s) are now possible utilising ultrafast and intense laser\npulses. These processes in particular are furthermore of interest as they are\nstrongly influenced by many-electron correlations. In such cases their\ntheoretical description requires a more comprehensive treatment than that\noffered by first order perturbation theory. We apply such a treatment through\nthe use of the CCC formalism which involves the complete numeric solution of\nthe integral Lippmann-Schwinger equations pertaining to a particular scattering\nevent. For laser assisted electron impact ionisation of He such a treatment is\nof a considerably greater accuracy than the majority of previous theoretical\ndescriptions applied to this problem which treat the field-free scattering\nevent within the first Born approximation. For the photodetachment of H^{-} and\nphotoionisation of He, the CCC approach allows for accurate calculation of the\nattosecond time delay and comparison with the companion processes of\nphotoelectron scattering on H and He^{+}, respectively.\n", "  Making use of known facts about \"tensor models,\" it is possible to construct\na quantum system without quenched disorder that has the same large $n$ limit\nfor its correlation functions and thermodynamics as the SYK model. This might\nbe useful in further probes of this approach to holographic duality.\n", "  We demonstrate stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy with 20 nm\ngold nanospheres coated by fluorescent silica. Compared with previous\ndemonstrations of STED with a hybrid plasmonic fluorescent label, the current\nimplementation offers a substantially smaller label and a better resolution\nimprovement of up to 2.5-fold beyond the diffraction limit of confocal\nmicroscopy. This is achieved at approximately 2 times lower intensity than\nconventional STED based on dyes alone, and in an aqueous environment,\ndemonstrating the relevance to bio-imaging. Finally, we also show, for the\nfirst time in this context, a 3-fold reduction in the rate of photobleaching\ncompared to standard dye-based STED, thus, enabling brighter images.\n", "  We present some of the topics covered in two lectures under the same title\nthat were given at the \"Summer School on High Energy Physics at the LHC: New\ntrends in HEP\" in Natal, Brazil. In this contribution we give a brief review on\nthe application of perturbative QCD to the hard diffractive processes. Some\nexamples of phenomenology for the diffractive production of $W/Z$, heavy\n$Q\\bar{Q}$ and quarkonium in hadron-hadron reactions are presented. It is also\ndiscussed the exclusive diffractive processes in $ep$ interactions. They are in\ngeneral driven by the gluon content of proton which is strongly subject to\nparton saturation effects in the very high energy limit. These saturation\neffects are well described within the color dipole formalism. We present some\nexamples of corresponding phenomenology as the elastic vector meson production\nand the DVCS relying on the color dipole approach.\n", "  The evolution of quantum walk on a finite wire under a small increment of\nvector potential $\\alpha$ can exhibit intrinsic quantum oscillation of the two\ntopologically protected bound states corresponding to the Majorana modes. By\ntuning an external electric field corresponding to the addition of an $\\alpha$\nimpulse at the end of each intrinsic period, the intrinsic oscillation is\nenveloped by a beat modulation with a longer period. This beat oscillation is\nuseful in the preparation of decoherence-free qubit in trapped ion chain and\nmay be observed in several experiments.\n", "  We review our work done to optimize the staggered conjugate gradient (CG)\nalgorithm in the MILC code for use with the Intel Knights Landing (KNL)\narchitecture. KNL is the second gener- ation Intel Xeon Phi processor. It is\ncapable of massive thread parallelism, data parallelism, and high on-board\nmemory bandwidth and is being adopted in supercomputing centers for scientific\nresearch. The CG solver consumes the majority of time in production running, so\nwe have spent most of our effort on it. We compare performance of an MPI+OpenMP\nbaseline version of the MILC code with a version incorporating the QPhiX\nstaggered CG solver, for both one-node and multi-node runs.\n", "  Laplacian eigenmap algorithm is a typical nonlinear model for dimensionality\nreduction in classical machine learning. We propose an efficient quantum\nLaplacian eigenmap algorithm to exponentially speed up the original\ncounterparts. In our work, we demonstrate that the Hermitian chain product\nproposed in quantum linear discriminant analysis (arXiv:1510.00113,2015) can be\napplied to implement quantum Laplacian eigenmap algorithm. While classical\nLaplacian eigenmap algorithm requires polynomial time to solve the eigenvector\nproblem, our algorithm is able to exponentially speed up nonlinear\ndimensionality reduction.\n", "  Exoplanets, short for `extra solar planets', are planets outside our solar\nsystem. They are objects with masses less than around 15 Jupiter-masses that\norbit stars other than the Sun. They are small enough so they can not burn\ndeuterium in their cores, yet large enough that they are not so called `dwarf\nplanets' like Pluto.\n  To discover life elsewhere in the universe, particularly outside our own\nsolar system, a good starting point would be to search for planets orbiting\nnearby Sun-like stars, since the only example of life we know of thrives on a\nplanet we call Earth that orbits a G-type dwarf star. Furthermore,\nunderstanding the population of exoplanetary systems in the nearby solar\nneighbourhood allows us to understand the mechanisms that built our own solar\nsystem and gave rise to the conditions necessary for our tree of life to\nflourish.\n  Signal processing is an integral part of exoplanet detection. From improving\nthe signal-to-noise ratio of the observed data to applying advanced statistical\nsignal processing methods, among others, to detect signals (potential planets)\nin the data, astronomers have tended, and continue to tend, towards signal\nprocessing in their quest of finding Earth-like planets. The following methods\nhave been used to detect exoplanets.\n", "  A steady-state superradiant laser can be used to generate\nultranarrow-linewidth light, and thus has important applications in the fields\nof quantum information and precision metrology. However, the light produced by\nsuch a laser is still essentially classical. Here, we show that the\nintroduction of a Rydberg medium into a cavity containing atoms with a narrow\noptical transition can lead to the steady-state superradiant emission of\nultranarrow-linewidth $nonclassical$ light. The cavity nonlinearity induced by\nthe Rydberg medium strongly modifies the superradiance threshold, and leads to\na Mollow triplet in the cavity output spectrum$-$this behavior can be\nunderstood as an unusual analogue of resonance fluorescence. The cavity output\nspectrum has an extremely sharp central peak, with a linewidth that can be far\nnarrower than that of a classical superradiant laser. This unprecedented\nspectral sharpness, together with the nonclassical nature of the light, could\nlead to new applications in which spectrally pure $quantum$ light is desired.\n", "  The aims are to investigate the clustering of the far-infrared sources from\nthe Herschel infrared Galactic Plane Survey (Hi-GAL) in the Galactic longitude\nrange of -71 to 67 deg. These clumps, and their spatial distribution, are an\nimprint of the original conditions within a molecular cloud. This will produce\na catalogue of over-densities. The minimum spanning tree (MST) method was used\nto identify the over-densities in two dimensions. The catalogue was further\nrefined by folding in heliocentric distances, resulting in more reliable\nover-densities, which are cluster candidates. We found 1,633 over-densities\nwith more than ten members. Of these, 496 are defined as cluster candidates\nbecause of the reliability of the distances, with a further 1,137 potential\ncluster candidates. The spatial distributions of the cluster candidates are\ndifferent in the first and fourth quadrants, with all clusters following the\nspiral structure of the Milky Way. The cluster candidates are fractal. The\nclump mass functions of the clustered and isolated are statistically\nindistinguishable from each other and are consistent with Kroupa's initial mass\nfunction.\n", "  The ATLAS Insertable B-Layer (IBL) detector was installed into the ATLAS\nexperiment in 2014 and has been in operation since 2015. During the first year\nof IBL data taking an increase of the low voltage currents associated with the\nFE-I4 front-end chip was observed and this increase was traced back to the\nradiation damage in the chip. The dependence of the current on the\ntotal-ionising dose and temperature has been tested with X-ray and proton\nirradiations and will be presented in this paper together with the detector\noperation guidelines.\n", "  The presence of stratified layer in atmosphere and ocean leads to buoyant\nvertical motions, commonly referred to as plumes. It is important to study the\nmixing dynamics of a plume at a local scale in order to model their evolution\nand growth. Such a characterization requires measuring the velocity and density\nof the mixing fluids simultaneously. Here, we present the results of a buoyant\nplume propagating in a linearly stratified medium with a density difference of\n0.5%, thus yielding a buoyancy frequency of N=0.15 s^{-1}. To understand the\nplume behaviour, statistics such as centerline and axial velocities along\nvarying downstream locations, turbulent kinetic energy, Reynolds stress, and\nbuoyancy flux were measured. The centerline velocity was found to decrease with\nincrease in height. The Reynolds stress and buoyancy flux profiles showed the\npresence of a unstable layer and the mixing associated within that layer.\n", "  Laboratory experiments were conducted to study heat transport characteristics\nin a nonhomogeneously heated fluid annulus subjected to rotation along the\nvertical axis (z). The nonhomogeneous heating was obtained by imposing radial\nand vertical temperature gradient ({\\Delta}T). The parameter range for this\nstudy was Rayleigh number, Ra=2.43x10^8-3.66x10^8, and Taylor number,\nTa=6.45x10^8-27x10^8. The working fluid was water with a Prandtl number, Pr=7.\nHeat transport was measured for varying rotation rates ({\\Omega}) for fixed\nvalues of {\\Delta}T. The Nusselt number, Nu, plotted as a function of Ta\ndistinctly showed the effect of rotation on heat transport. In general, Nu was\nfound to have a larger value for non-rotating convection. This could mean an\ninterplay of columnar plumes and baroclinic wave in our system as also evident\nfrom temperature measurements. Laser based imaging at a single vertical plane\nalso showed evidence of such flow structure.\n", "  Neglecting the effects associated with the solar wind plasma, the\nphotoelectrons are the only elementary particles which create an electrical\ncurrent through sunlit surface of the moon. They are knocked off of the surface\nsoil, rise above the surface, and then fall back. Therefore, on average, on any\nunit of surface area there is a positive charge, equal in magnitude to the\ncharge of photoelectrons flying over this area. However, the charge of any\nsmall dust particle can strongly fluctuate discretely: a photoelectron can be\neither knocked off of the or be reacquired by the particle. The result is a\n\"random walk\" in sign and magnitude of the charge of grains. In a few minutes\nafter sunrise, almost every dust particle on the surface has at least one extra\nor missing electron, and the average modulus of the charge accumulated on a\nparticle is proportional to the square root of the number of \"steps\" (knocking\noff /returns of photoelectrons). Therefore, the average value of the modulus of\nthe charge of a fine dust particle exceeds by several orders of magnitude the\nproportion of the average surface charge attributable to the particle. So dust\nparticles that have ejected a sufficient number of photoelectrons can take off\nfrom the surface because of the electric field of the near surface charge\ndouble layer. It is shown that: (i) almost half of all dust particles on the\nilluminated lunar surface are missing at least one electron; (ii) a significant\nportion of particles up to 100 nm in size emits several photoelectrons and\nacquire a positive charge, sufficient to take off from the surface; (iii) above\nthe surface there is a \"boiling layer\" of dust with a maximum thickness of\nseveral hundred meters where the average size of the particles and their\ndensity non-monotonically depend on the altitude.\n", "  The MicroBooNE detector has recently completed its first year of neutrino\nbeam data-taking in the Booster Neutrino Beam at Fermilab, having collected\napproximately half of its intended data ($3.4\\times10^{20}$ of\n$6.6\\times10^{20}$ protons on target). We present kinematic distributions of\nneutrino interactions observed from a small subset of this data (equivalent to\n$5\\times10^{19}$ protons on target), both as a first step towards a\ncharged-current muon neutrino cross-section on argon, and as an exploration of\nthe capabilities and operational challenges of large liquid argon time\nprojection chambers as neutrino detectors. These distributions have been\nassessed using fully automated event selection and reconstruction.\n", "  The LArIAT experiment has performed the world's first measurement of the\ntotal charged-current pion cross-section on an argon target, using the\nrepurposed ArgoNeuT detector in the Fermilab test beam. Presented here are the\nresults of that measurement, along with an overview of the LArIAT experiment\nand details of the LArIAT collaboration's plans for future measurements.\n", "  Experiments have revealed that membrane proteins can form two-dimensional\nclusters with regular translational and orientational protein arrangements,\nwhich may allow cells to modulate protein function. However, the physical\nmechanisms yielding supramolecular organization and collective function of\nmembrane proteins remain largely unknown. Here we show that bilayer-mediated\nelastic interactions between membrane proteins can yield regular and\ndistinctive lattice architectures of protein clusters, and may provide a link\nbetween lattice architecture and lattice function. Using the mechanosensitive\nchannel of large conductance (MscL) as a model system, we obtain relations\nbetween the shape of MscL and the supramolecular architecture of MscL lattices.\nWe predict that the tetrameric and pentameric MscL symmetries observed in\nprevious structural studies yield distinct lattice architectures of MscL\nclusters and that, in turn, these distinct MscL lattice architectures yield\ndistinct lattice activation barriers. Our results suggest general physical\nmechanisms linking protein symmetry, the lattice architecture of membrane\nprotein clusters, and the collective function of membrane protein lattices.\n", "  Hydrophobic thickness mismatch between integral membrane proteins and the\nsurrounding lipid bilayer can produce lipid bilayer thickness deformations.\nExperiment and theory have shown that protein-induced lipid bilayer thickness\ndeformations can yield energetically favorable bilayer-mediated interactions\nbetween integral membrane proteins, and large-scale organization of integral\nmembrane proteins into protein clusters in cell membranes. Within the continuum\nelasticity theory of membranes, the energy cost of protein-induced bilayer\nthickness deformations can be captured by considering compression and expansion\nof the bilayer hydrophobic core, membrane tension, and bilayer bending,\nresulting in biharmonic equilibrium equations describing the shape of lipid\nbilayers for a given set of bilayer-protein boundary conditions. Here we\ndevelop a combined analytic and numerical methodology for the solution of the\nequilibrium elastic equations associated with protein-induced lipid bilayer\ndeformations. Our methodology allows accurate prediction of thickness-mediated\nprotein interactions for arbitrary protein symmetries at arbitrary protein\nseparations and relative orientations. We provide exact analytic solutions for\ncylindrical integral membrane proteins with constant and varying hydrophobic\nthickness, and develop perturbative analytic solutions for non-cylindrical\nprotein shapes. We complement these analytic solutions, and assess their\naccuracy, by developing both finite element and finite difference numerical\nsolution schemes. Taken together, the work presented here puts into place an\nanalytic and numerical framework which allows calculation of bilayer-mediated\nelastic interactions between integral membrane proteins for the complicated\nprotein shapes suggested by structural biology and at the small protein\nseparations most relevant for the crowded membrane environments provided by\nliving cells.\n", "  The classical theory of grain nucleation suffers from both theoretical and\npredictive deficiencies. We strive to alleviate these deficiencies in our\nunderstanding of dust formation and growth by utilizing an atomistic model of\nnucleation. Carbon cluster geometries are determined with a set of global\nminimization algorithms. Using density functional theory, the binding energies\nof carbon clusters from $n=2$ to $n=99$ are then calculated. These energies are\nused to calculate the critical size and nucleation rate of carbon clusters.\n  We find that the critical cluster size is largely determined by the changes\nin geometry of the clusters. Clusters with size $n=27$ and $n=8$, roughly\ncorresponding to the transition from ring-to-fullerene geometry and\nchain-to-ring geometry respectively, are the critical sizes across the range of\ntemperature and saturation where nucleation is significant. In contrast to the\nclassical theory, nucleation is enhanced at low-temperatures, and suppressed at\nhigh temperatures. These results will be applied to a modified chemical\nevolution code using results from supernova simulations.\n", "  We present a new correspondence between a d-dimensional dynamical system and\na whole family of (d+1)-dimensional systems. This new scale-holographic\nrelation is built by the explicit introduction of a dimensionful constant which\ndetermines the size of the additional dimension. Scale holography is\nparticularly useful for studying non-local theories, since the equivalent dual\nsystem on the higher dimensional manifold can be made to be local, as we\nillustrate with the specific example of the p-adic string.\n", "  We introduce the concept of transformation crystallography which consists of\nthe application of geometric transforms to periodic structures. We consider\nmotifs with three-fold, four-fold and six-fold symmetries according to the\ncrystallographic restriction theorem. Furthermore, we define motifs with\nfive-fold symmetry such as quasi-crystals generated by a cut-and-projection\nmethod. We analyze elastic wave propagation in the transformed crystals and\n(Penrose-type) quasi-crystals with the finite difference time domain freeware\nSimSonic. We consider geometric transforms underpinning the design of seismic\ncloaks with square, circular, elliptical and peanut shapes in the context of\ntriangular, square and honeycomb crystals. Interestingly, the use of morphing\ntechniques leads to the design of cloaks with interpolated geometries\nreminiscent of Victor Vasarely's artwork. Employing the case of transformed\ngraphene-like (honeycomb) structures allows one to draw useful analogies\nbetween large-scale seismic metamaterials such as soils structured with columns\nof concrete or grout with soil and nanoscale biochemical metamaterials. We\nfurther point out similarities between cloaks for elastodynamic and\nhydrodynamic waves and cloaks for diffusion (heat or mass) diffusion processes,\nnotably with respect to invisibility and protection. Experimental data\nextracted from field test analysis of soil structured with boreholes\ndemonstrates the application of bio-inspired seismic metamaterials. We conclude\nthat these novel materials hold strong applications in biophysics and\ngeophysics.\n", "  We report on low mechanical loss in a high-stress silicon nitride\n(Si_{3}N_{4}) membrane at temperatures below 100 mK. We isolate a membrane via\na phononic shield formed within a supporting silicon frame, and measure the\nmechanical quality factor of a number of high-tension membrane modes as we vary\nour dilution refrigerator base temperature between 35 mK and 5 K. At the lowest\ntemperatures, we obtain a maximum quality factor (Q) of 2.3\\times10^{8},\ncorresponding to a Q-frequency product (QFP) of 3.7\\times10^{14} Hz. These\nmeasurements complement the recent observation of improved quality factors of\nSi_{3}N_{4} at ultralow temperatures via electrical detection. We also observe\na dependence of the quality factor on optical heating of the device. By\ncombining exceptional material properties, high tension, advanced isolation and\nclamping techniques, high-stress mechanical objects are poised to explore a new\nregime of exceptional quality factors. Such quality factors combined with an\noptical probe at cryogenic temperatures will have a direct impact on resonators\nas quantum objects, as well as force sensors at mK temperatures.\n", "  This short review is devoted to the simple process of drying a\nmulti-component droplet consisting of a complex fluid containing a salt. These\nprocesses provide a fascinating subject for study. The explanation of the rich\nvariety of patterns formed is not only an academic challenge, but a problem of\npractical importance, as applications are growing in medical diagnosis and\nimprovement of coating/printing technology. The fundamental scientific problem\nis the study of the mechanism of micro- and nanoparticle self-organization in\nopen systems. The specific fundamental problem to be solved, related to this\nsystem is - the investigation of the mass transfer processes, the formation and\nevolution of phase fronts and the identification of mechanisms of pattern\nformation. The drops of liquid containing dissolved substances and suspended\nparticles are assumed to be drying on a horizontal solid substrate. The\nchemical composition and macroscopic properties of the complex fluid, the\nconcentration and nature of the salt, the surface energy of the substrate and\nthe interaction between the fluid and substrate which determines the wetting,\nall affect the final morphology of the dried film.\n", "  Besides the original seeded undulator line, in the Soft X-ray free-electron\nlaser (SXFEL) user facility at Shanghai, a second undulator line based on\nself-amplified spontaneous emission is proposed to achieve 2 nm laser pulse\nwith extremely high brightness. In this paper, the beam energy deviation\ninduced by the undulator wakefields is numerically obtained, and it is verified\nto have a good agreement between 3D and 2D simulation results. The beam energy\nloss along the undulator degrades the expected FEL output performance. Impact\nof wakefields on pulse energy, radiation power and spectrum is discussed, as\nwell as the benefits of compensation obtained with a taper in the undulator\nfield. And using the planned SXFEL diagnostic, a longitudinal wakefields\nmeasurement experiment is proposed and simulated.\n", "  We study the effect of nanoscale precipitates on lattice thermal conduction\nin thermoelectric PbTe using a combination of ab-initio phonon calculations and\nmolecular dynamics. We take into account the effects of mass difference and\nchange in force constants, and find an enhanced influence of the latter with\nincreased precipitate concentration. As a consequence, our inclusion of the\nchange in force constants in the calculation affords a smaller predicted\noptimal nano-precipitate size that minimizes the thermal conductivity. These\nresults suggest that the phonon scattering by nanoprecipitates in\nthermoelectric composites could be stronger than previously thought.\n", "  We carry out a Carlotto-Schoen-type gluing with interpolating scalar\ncurvature on cone-like sets, or deformations thereof, in the category of smooth\nRiemannian asymptotically Euclidean metrics.\n", "  The structural stability of thermoelectric materials is a subject of growing\nimportance for their energy harvesting applications. Here, we study the\nmicroscopic mechanisms governing the structural stability change of zinc\nantimony at its working temperature, using molecular dynamics combined with\nexperimental measurements of the electrical and thermal conductivity. Our\nresults show that the temperature-dependence of the thermal and electrical\ntransport coefficients is strongly correlated with a structural transition.\nThis is found to be associated with a relaxation process, in which a group of\nZn atoms migrates between interstitial sites. This atom migration gradually\nleads to a stabilizing structural transition of the entire crystal framework,\nand then results in a more stable crystal structure of $\\beta-$ Zn4Sb3 at high\ntemperature.\n", "  The Pauli equations describing electron (hole) dynamics in 2D Dirac-like\nintrinsic semiconductors in external (impurity) scalar potential and for\ninhomogeneous lattice distortions are obtained within second quantization\napproach. We show that the modifying external perturbation terms in formulated\nno-pair equations are in general non-local and demonstrates singular behavior\nin gapless situation where they do not depend on semiconductor parameters. It\nis shown that lattice distortion perturbation can cause confinement of both\nelectrons and holes in the same spatial region. The proposed approach is\nverified by comparison with well-established results in low energy limit. The\nconsideration of position operator in second quantization approach allows\nelucidating the physical meaning of spin-orbit-like and Darwin-like terms.\n", "  An efficient hybrid numerical method for multiple scattering calculations is\nproposed. We use the well established doubling--adding method to find the\nreflection function of the lowermost homogeneous slab comprising the atmosphere\nof our interest. This reflection function provides the initial value for the\nfast invariant imbedding method of Sato et al., (1977), with which layers are\nadded until the final reflection function of the entire atmosphere is obtained.\nThe execution speed of this hybrid method is no slower than one half of that of\nthe doubling-adding method, probably the fastest algorithm available, even in\nthe most unsuitable cases for the fast invariant imbedding method. The\nefficiency of the proposed method increases rapidly with the number of\natmospheric slabs and the optical thickness of each slab. For some cases, its\nexecution speed is approximately four times faster than the doubling--adding\nmethod. This work has been published in NAIS Journal (ISSN 1882-9392) Vol. 7,\n5-16 (2012).\n", "  Understanding phonon scattering by topological defects in graphene is of\nparticular interest for thermal management in graphene-based devices. We\npresent a study that quantifies the roles of the different mechanisms governing\ndefect phonon scattering by comparing the effects of ten different defect\nstructures using molecular dynamics. Our results show that phonon scattering is\nmainly influenced by mass density difference, with general trends governed by\nthe defect formation energy and typical softening behaviors in the phonon\ndensity of state. The phonon scattering cross-section is found to be far larger\nthan that geometrically occupied by the defects. We also show that the lattice\nthermal conductivity can be reduced by a factor of up to ~30 in the presence of\nthe grain boundaries formed by these defects.\n", "  We characterize the two-dimensionalization process in the turbulent flow\nproduced by an impeller rotating at a rate $\\omega$ in a fluid rotating at a\nrate $\\Omega$ around the same axis for Rossby number $Ro=\\omega/\\Omega$ down to\n$10^{-2}$. The flow can be described as the superposition of a large-scale\nvertically invariant global rotation and small-scale shear layers detached from\nthe impeller blades. As $Ro$ decreases, the large-scale flow is subjected to\nazimuthal modulations. In this regime, the shear layers can be described in\nterms of wakes of inertial waves traveling with the blades, originating from\nthe velocity difference between the non-axisymmetric large-scale flow and the\nblade rotation. The wakes are well defined and stable at low Rossby number, but\nthey become disordered at $Ro$ of order of 1. This experiment provides insight\ninto the route towards pure two-dimensionalization induced by a background\nrotation for flows driven by a non-axisymmetric rotating forcing.\n", "  The Coulomb interaction is widely known to enhance the effective mass of\ninteracting particles and therefore tends to favor a localized state at\ncommensurate filling. Here, we will show that, in contrast to this consensus,\nin a van der Waals heterostructure consisting of graphene and hexagon boron\nnitride (h-BN), the onsite Coulomb repulsion will at first destroy the\nlocalized state. This is due to the fact that the onsite Coulomb repulsion\ntends to suppress the asymmetry between neighboring carbons induced by h-BN\nsubstrate. We corroborate this surprising phenomenon by solving a tight-binding\nmodel with onsite Coulomb repulsion treated within coherent potential\napproximation, where hopping parameters are derived from density functional\ntheory calculations based on the graphene/h-BN heterostructure. Our results\nindicate that both gapless and gapped states observed experimentally in\ngraphene/h-BN heterostructures can be understood after a realistic value of the\nonsite Coulomb repulsion as well as different interlayer distances are taken\ninto account. Finally, we propose ways to enhance the gapped state which is\nessential for potential application of graphene to next-generation electronics.\nFurthermore, we argue that band gap suppressed by many-body effect should\nhappen in other van der Waals heterostructures.\n", "  Recently the LHCb experiment found evidence for the existence of two exotic\nresonances consisting of $c\\bar{c}uud$ quarks. Among the possible\ninterpretations is the hadro-charmonium model, in which charmonium is bound\n\"within\" a light hadron. We test this idea on CLS $N_f$=2+1 lattices using the\nstatic formulation for the heavy quarks. We find that the static potential is\nmodified by the presence of a hadron such that it becomes more attractive. The\neffect is of the order of a few MeV.\n", "  The phase structure of the lattice CP($N-1$) model in two dimensions is\nanalyzed by the tensor renormalization group (TRG) method. We focus on the case\n$N=2$ and compare the numerical result of the TRG method with that of the\nstrong-coupling analysis in the presence of the $\\theta$ term and investigate\nthe nature of the phase transition at $\\theta=\\pi$.\n", "  In this paper we propose and realize (the code is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/Thrawn1985/2D-Partition-Function) an algorithm for exact\ncalculation of partition function for planar graph models with binary spins.\nThe complexity of the algorithm is O(N^2). Test experiments shows good\nagreement with Onsager's analytical solution for two-dimensional Ising model of\ninfinite size.\n", "  We demonstrate rapid deterministic (seeded) growth of large single-crystals\nof graphene by chemical vapour deposition (CVD) utilising pre-patterned copper\nsubstrates with chromium nucleation sites. Arrays of graphene single-crystals\nas large as several hundred microns are grown with a periodicity of up to 1 mm.\nThe graphene is transferred to target substrates using aligned and\ncontamination-free semi-dry transfer. The high quality of the synthesised\ngraphene is confirmed by Raman spectroscopy and transport measurements,\ndemonstrating room-temperature carrier mobility of 21 000 cm2 / V s when\ntransferred on top of hexagonal boron nitride. By tailoring the nucleation of\nlarge single-crystals according to the desired device geometry, it will be\npossible to produce complex device architectures based on single-crystal\ngraphene, thus paving the way to the adoption of CVD graphene in wafer-scale\nfabrication.\n", "  Many gravitational phenomena that lie at the core of our understanding of the\nUniverse have not yet been directly observed. An example in this sense is the\nboson star that has been proposed as an alternative to some compact objects\ncurrently interpreted as being black holes. In the weak field limit, these\nstars are governed by the Newton-Schrodinger equation (NSE). Here we present an\noptical system that, under appropriate conditions, identically reproduces the\nNSE in two dimensions. A rotating boson star is experimentally and numerically\nmodelled by an optical beam propagating through a medium with a positive\nthermal nonlinearity and is shown to oscillate in time while also stable up to\nrelatively high densities. For higher densities, instabilities lead to an\napparent breakup of the star, yet coherence across the whole structure is\nmaintained. These results show that optical analogues can be used to shed new\nlight on inaccessible gravitational objects.\n", "  Graphene and other nanostructures belong to the center of interest of today's\nphysics research. The local density of states of the graphitic nanocone\ninfluenced by the spin-orbit interaction was calculated. Numerical calculations\nand the Green function approach were used to solve this problem. It was proven\nin the second case that the second order pproximation is not sufficient for\nthis purpose.\n", "  Recent numerical results show that if a scalar is mixed by periodically\nforced turbulence, the average mixing rate is directly affected for forcing\nfrequencies small compared to the integral turbulence frequency. We elucidate\nthis by an analytical study using simple turbulence models for spectral\ntransfer. Adding a large amplitude modulation to the forcing of the velocity\nfield enhances the energy transfer and simultaneously diminishes the scalar\ntransfer. Adding a modulation to a random stirring protocol will thus\nnegatively influence the mixing rate. We further derive the asymptotic\nbehaviour of the response of the passive scalar quantities in the same flow for\nlow and high forcing frequencies.\n", "  The Fluctuation Theorems are a group of exact relations that remain valid\nirrespective of how far the system has been driven away from equilibrium. Other\nthan having practical applications, like determination of equilibrium free\nenergy change from nonequilibrium processes, they help in our understanding of\nthe Second Law and the emergence of irreversibility from time-reversible\nequations of motion at microscopic level. A vast number of such theorems have\nbeen proposed in literature, ranging from Hamiltonian to stochastic systems,\nfrom systems in steady state to those in transient regime, and for both open\nand closed quantum systems. In this article, we discuss about a few such\nrelations, when the system evolves under Hamiltonian dynamics.\n", "  In this work we study the optoelectronic properties of individual TiO2 fibres\nproduced through coupled sol-gel and electrospinning, by depositing them onto\npre-patterned Ti/Au electrodes on SiO2/Si substrates. Transport measurements in\nthe dark give a conductivity above 2*10^-5 S, which increases up to 8*10^-5 S\nin vacuum. Photocurrent measurements under UV-irradiation show high sensitivity\n(responsivity of 90 A/W for 375 nm wavelength) and a response time to\nillumination of ~ 5 s, which is superior to state-of-the-art TiO2-based UV\nphotodetectors. Both responsivity and response speed are higher in air than in\nvacuum, due to oxygen adsorbed on the TiO2 surface which traps photoexcited\nfree electrons in the conduction band, thus reducing the recombination\nprocesses. The photodetectors are sensitive to light polarization, with an\nanisotropy ratio of 12%. These results highlight the interesting combination of\nlarge surface area and low 1D transport resistance in electrospun TiO2 fibres.\nThe simplicity of the sol-gel/electrospinning synthesis method, combined with a\nfast response and high responsivity makes them attractive candidates for\nUV-photodetection in ambient conditions. We anticipate their high (photo)\nconductance is also relevant for photocatalysis and dye-sensitized solar cells.\n", "  We study the effect of citrate to gold molar ratio (X) on the size of\ncitrated gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). This dependence is still a matter of\ndebate for X $\\ge$ 3 where the polydispersity is yet minimized. Indeed, there\nis no consensus between experiments proposed so far for comparable experimental\nconditions. Nonetheless, the sole available theoretical prediction has never\nbeen validated experimentally in this range of X. We show unambiguously using 3\ntechniques (UV-Vis spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering and transmission\nelectronic microscopy), 2 different synthetic approaches (Direct, Inverse) and\n10 X values for each approach that AuNPs' size decay as a monoexponential with\nX. This result is, for the first time, in agreement with the sole available\ntheoretical prediction by Kumar et al. on the whole studied range of X.\n", "  We predict a strongest size for the contact strength when asperity radii of\ncurvature decrease below ten nanometers. The reason for such strongest size is\nfound to be correlated with the competition between the dislocation plasticity\nand surface diffusional plasticity. The essential role of temperature is\ncalculated and illustrated in a comprehensive asperity size-strengthtemperature\nmap taking into account the effect of contact velocity. Such a map should be\nessential for various phenomena related to nanoscale contacts such as nanowire\ncold welding, self-assembly of nanoparticles and adhesive nano-pillar arrays,\nas well as the electrical, thermal and mechanical properties of macroscopic\ninterfaces.\n", "  We discuss a new approach to strong coupling expansion and dual\nrepresentations for non-abelian lattice gauge theories. The Wilson gauge action\nis decomposed into a sum over \"abelian color cycles\" (ACC), which are loops\naround plaquettes visiting different colors at the corners. ACCs are complex\nnumbers and thus commute such that a dual representation of a non-abelian\ntheory can be obtained as in the abelian case. We apply the ACC approach to\nSU(2) and SU(3) lattice gauge theory and exactly rewrite the two partition sums\nin a strong coupling series where all gauge integrals are known in closed form.\n", "  In this paper we solve Friedmann equations by considering a universal media\nas a non-perfect fluid with bulk viscosity and is described by a general \"gamma\nlaw\" equation of state of the form $p= (\\gamma -1) \\rho + \\Lambda(t)$, where\nthe adiabatic parameter $\\gamma$ varies with scale factor $R$ of the metric and\n$\\Lambda$ is the time dependent cosmological constant. A unified description of\nthe early evolution of the universe is presented by assuming the bulk viscosity\nand cosmological parameter in a linear combination of two terms of the form:\n$\\Lambda(t)=\\Lambda_{0} + \\Lambda_{1}\\frac{\\dot{R}}{R}$ and $\\zeta = \\zeta_{0}\n+ \\zeta_{1} \\frac{\\dot{R}}{R}$, where $\\Lambda_{0},\\;\\Lambda_{1},\\, \\zeta_{0}$\nand $ \\zeta_{1}$ are constants, in which an inflationary phase is followed by\nthe radiation dominated phase. For this general gamma law equation of state, an\nentirely integrable dynamical equation to the scale factor $R$ is obtained\nalong with its exact solutions. In this framework we demonstrate that the model\ncan be used to explain the dark energy dominant universe and for a special\nchoice of the parameters we can explain the accelerating expansion of the\nuniverse also for two different phases, viz. combination of dark energy and\ndark matter phase as well as unified dark energy phase. A special physical\ncheck has been performed through sound speed constraint to validate the model.\nAt last we obtain a scaling relation between the Hubble parameter with\nredshift.\n", "  The length and bore geometry of musical instruments directly influences the\nquality of sound that can be produced. In brass instruments, nonlinear effects\nfrom finite-amplitude wave propagation can lead to wave distortion giving\nsounds a brassy timbre [3, 5, 14, 20, 26]. In this paper, we propose a\nthree-dimensional model to describe nonlinear wave propagation in a trumpet and\ninvestigate the importance of the mouthpiece shank geometry. Time pressure\nwaveforms corresponding to B_3(b) and B_4(b) notes were recorded at the\nmouthpiece shank and used as inputs for our model. To describe the motion of\ncompressible inviscid fluid, we numerically solved the compressible Euler\nequations using the discontinuous Galerkin method. To validate our approach,\nthe numerical results were compared to the recorded musical notes outside the\nbell of the trumpet. Simulations were performed on computational trumpets where\ndifferent bore geometries were considered. Our results demonstrate that the\nshape of the narrow region near mouthpiece greatly influences the wave\npropagation and accuracy of the trumpet model.\n", "  In this work, atomic calculations were performed within the local-density and\ngeneralized-gradient approximations of exchange and correlation density\nfunctionals within density-functional theory to provide accurate periodic\ntrends of first ionization energies and electron affinities of the atomic\nseries from hydrogen to xenon. Electronegativities were determined directly\nfrom Mulliken's formula and were shown to be equivalently calculated rather by\nusing Slater-Janak's transition state or by calculating the electrostatic\nself-energies of the orbitals involved in the transition to ions. Finally,\ncomparisons were made with other theoretical and experimental results,\nincluding Mulliken-Jaff\\'e's electronegativity scale.\n", "  We present the Adaptive Aggregation-based Domain Decomposition Multigrid\nmethod extended to the twisted mass fermion discretization action. We show\ncomparisons of results as a function of tuning the parameters that enter the\ntwisted mass version of the DDalphaAMG library\n(https://github.com/sbacchio/DDalphaAMG). Moreover, we linked the DDalphaAMG\nlibrary to the tmLQCD software package and give details on the performance of\nthe multigrid solver during HMC simulations at the physical point.\n", "  Dynamical systems can autonomously adapt their organization so that the\nrequired target dynamics is reproduced. In the previous Rapid Communication\n[Phys. Rev. E 90,030901(R) (2014)], it was shown how such systems can be\ndesigned using delayed feedbacks. Here, the proposed method is further analyzed\nand improved. Its extension to adaptable systems, where delays are absent and\ninertial feedbacks are instead employed, is suggested. Numerical tests for\nthree different models, including networks of phase and amplitude oscillators,\nare performed.\n", "  We study AGN emission line profiles combining an improved version of the\naccretion disc-wind model of Murray & Chiang with the magneto-hydrodynamic\nmodel of Emmering et al. (1992). Here we extend our previous work to consider\ncentral objects with different masses and/or luminosities. We have compared the\ndispersions in our model C IV linewidth distributions to observational upper\nlimit on that dispersion, considering both smooth and clumpy torus models.\nFollowing Fine et al., we transform that scatter in the profile line-widths\ninto a constraint on the torus geometry and show how the half-opening angle of\nthe obscuring structure depends on the mass of the central object and the\naccretion rate. We find that the results depend only mildly on the\ndimensionless angular momentum, one of the two integrals of motion that\ncharacterise the dynamics of the self-similar ideal MHD outflows\n", "  The exact solution of Schrodinger equation for atoms, molecules and extended\nsystems continues to be a \"Holy Grail\" problem that the entire field has been\nstriving to solve since its inception. Recently, breakthroughs have been made\nin the development of quantum annealing and coherent Ising machines capable of\nsimulating hundreds of connected spins interacting with an Ising type\nHamiltonian. One of the most vital questions pertaining to these new devices\nis: 'can these machine be used to perform electronic structure calculations?'\nHere we discuss the general procedure used by these devices and show that there\nis an exact mapping between the electronic structure Hamiltonian of the\nHydrogen molecule and the Ising Hamiltonian\n", "  Using exact Bethe ansatz (BA) solutions, we show that a spin-down fermion\nimmersed into a fully polarized spin-up Fermi sea with a weak attraction is\ndressed by the surrounding spin-up fermions to form the one-dimensional analog\nof a polaron. As the attraction becomes strong, the spin-down fermion binds\nwith one spin-up fermion to form a tightly bound molecule. Throughout the whole\ninteraction regime, a crossover from the polaron to a molecule state is fully\ndemonstrated through exact results of the excitation spectrum, the effective\nmass, binding energy and kinetic energy. Furthermore, a clear distinction\nbetween the polaron and molecule is conceived by the probability distribution,\nsingle particle reduced density matrix and density-density correlations, which\nare calculated directly from the Bethe ansatz wave function. Such a\npolaron-molecule crossover presents a universal nature of an impurity immersed\ninto a fermionic medium with an attraction in one dimension.\n", "  Gravitational-wave observatories around the world, including the Laser\nInterferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), record a large volume of\ngravitational-wave output data and auxiliary data about the instruments and\ntheir environments. These data are stored at the observatory sites and\ndistributed to computing clusters for data analysis. LigoDV-web is a web-based\ndata viewer that provides access to data recorded at the LIGO Hanford, LIGO\nLivingston and GEO600 observatories, and the 40m prototype interferometer at\nCaltech. The challenge addressed by this project is to provide meaningful\nvisualizations of small data sets to anyone in the collaboration in a fast,\nsecure and reliable manner with minimal software, hardware and training\nrequired of the end users. LigoDV-web is implemented as a Java Enterprise\nApplication, with Shibboleth Single Sign On for authentication and\nauthorization and a proprietary network protocol used for data access on the\nback end. Collaboration members with proper credentials can request data be\ndisplayed in any of several general formats from any Internet appliance that\nsupports a modern browser with Javascript and minimal HTML5 support, including\npersonal computers, smartphones, and tablets. To date 634 unique users have\nvisited the LigoDV-web website in a total of 33,861 sessions and generated a\ntotal of 139,875 plots. This infrastructure has been helpful in many analyses\nwithin the collaboration including follow-up of the data surrounding the first\ngravitational-wave events observed by LIGO in 2015.\n", "  We investigate an influence of the random external electric field on the 2D\nextremely short optical pulses propagation in the silicene. The random electric\nfield is perpendicular to the silicene plane. An effective equation has the\nform of a wave equation with saturating nonlinearity. We analyze the\ndependences of the electromagnetic field intensity on the parameters of a\nproblem.\n", "  Recently, it has been stated that single-world interpretations of quantum\ntheory are logically inconsistent. The claim is derived from contradicting\nstatements of agents in a setup combining two Wigner's-friend experiments.\nThose statements stem from applying the measurement-update rule subjectively,\ni.e., only for the respective agent's own measurement. We argue that the\ncontradiction expresses the incompatibility of collapse and unitarity -\nresulting in different formal descriptions of a measurement - and does not\nallow to dismiss any specific interpretation of quantum theory.\n", "  New high-cadence observations with BRITE covering many months confirm that\ncoupled pairs of nonradial pulsation modes are widespread among early-type Be\nstars. With the difference frequency between the parental variations they may\nform a roughly sinusoidal variability or the amplitude may cyclicly vary. A\nfirst - amplified - beat pattern is also found. In all three cases the\namplitudes of difference frequencies can exceed the amplitude sum of the base\nfrequencies, and modulations of the star-to-circumstellar-disk mass-transfer\nrate may be associated with these slow variations. This suggests more strongly\nthan any earlier observations that significant dissipation of pulsational\nenergy in the atmosphere may be a cause of mass ejections from Be stars. A\nunifying interpretative concept is presented.\n", "  We present the nCTEQ15 global analysis of nuclear parton distribution\nfunctions (nPDFs). The main addition to the previous nCTEQ PDFs is the\nintroduction of PDF uncertainties based on the Hessian method. Another\nimportant improvement is the inclusion of pion production data from RHIC giving\nus a handle to constrain gluon PDF. In this presentation we briefly discuss the\nframework of our analysis and concentrate on the comparison of our results with\nthose of other groups. Additionally we show a first estimate of the impact of\nthe LHC pPb W/Z boson production data on the presented nCTEQ15 PDFs.\n", "  Anti--de Sitter spacetime is important in general relativity and modern field\ntheory. We review its geometrical features and properties of light signals and\nfree particles moving in it. Applying only elementary tools of tensor calculus\nwe derive \\textit{ab initio\\/} all these properties and show that they are\nreally weird. One finds superluminal velocities of light and particles,\ninfinite particle energy necessary to escape at infinite distance and spacetime\nregions inaccessible by a free fall, though reachable by an accelerated\nspaceship. Radial timelike geodesics are identical to the circular ones and\nactually all timelike geodesics are identical to one circle in a fictitious\nfive--dimensional space. Employing the latter space one is able to explain\nthese bizarre features of anti--de Sitter spacetime; in this sense the\nspacetime is not self--contained. This is not a physical world.\n", "  A large number of wave modes exist in a magnetized plasma. Their properties\nare determined by the interaction of particles and waves. In a simulation code,\nthe correct treatment of field quantities and particle behavior is essential to\ncorrectly reproduce the wave properties. Consequently, plasma waves provide\ntest problems that cover a large fraction of the simulation code.\n  The large number of possible wave modes and the freedom to choose parameters\nmake the selection of test problems time consuming and comparison between\ndifferent codes difficult. This paper therefore aims to provide a selection of\ntest problems, based on different wave modes and with well defined parameter\nvalues, that is accessible to a large number of simulation codes to allow for\neasy benchmarking and cross validation.\n  Example results are provided for a number of plasma models. For all plasma\nmodels and wave modes that are used in the test problems, a mathematical\ndescription is provided to clarify notation and avoid possible misunderstanding\nin naming.\n", "  Sol-gel deposited (010) textured polycrystalline thin films of gallium\nferrite (GaFeO3 or GFO) on n-Si(100) and Pt/Si(111) substrates are\ncharacterized for room temperature multiferroism. Structural characterization\nusing X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy confirms formation of single\nphase with nano-sized crystallites. Temperature dependent magnetization study\ndemonstrates ferri to paramagnetic transition at ~300 K. Room temperature\npiezoresponse force microscopic analysis reveals local 180 degree phase\nswitching of ferroelectric domains at very high coercive field EC, ~ 1350 kV/cm\nconsistent with recent experimental and first-principles studies. Our study\nopens up possibility of integrating polycrystalline GFO in novel room\ntemperature multiferroic devices.\n", "  The confirmation of the neutrino mass by oscillation phenomena converts the\nstudy of the magnetic dipole moment (MDM) of the neutrino, in vacuum and\nregions where existing external magnetic fields, a topic of particular interest\nfrom the theoretical point of view. The MDM has an implicit relation with\nneutrino masses, and this is a possible benchmark from new physics in the\nsolution of open questions in neutrino physics. Besides we know that this kind\nof phenomena has significant consequences on cosmology and astrophysics, e.g.,\nunder the influence of combined effects of neutrinos in the compact objects\nformation and evolution of primordials magnetic fields. We calculate and\nanalyze such effects introducing charged Higgs bosons based on the parameter\nspace of several 2HDMs with and without flavor conservation in neutral\ncurrents.\n", "  We study the detector performance in the reconstruction of\nhadronically-decaying W bosons and Higgs bosons at very high energy proton\ncolliders using a full GEANT4 simulation of the SiFCC detector. The W and Higgs\nbosons carry transverse momentum in the multi-TeV range, which results in\ncollimated decay products that are reconstructed as a single jet. We present a\nmeasurement of the energy response and resolution of boosted W-jets and\nHiggs-jets and show the separation of two sub-jets within the boosted boson\njet.\n", "  Quantum key distribution (QKD) exploits the quantum nature of light to share\nprovably secure keys, allowing secure communication in the presence of an\neavesdropper. The first QKD schemes used photons encoded in two states, such as\npolarization. Recently, much effort has turned to large-alphabet QKD schemes,\nwhich encode photons in high-dimensional basis states. Compared to\nbinary-encoded QKD, large-alphabet schemes can encode more secure information\nper detected photon, boosting secure communication rates, and also provide\nincreased resilience to noise and loss. High-dimensional encoding may also\nimprove the efficiency of other quantum information processing tasks, such as\nperforming Bell tests and implementing quantum gates. Here, we demonstrate a\nlarge-alphabet QKD protocol based on high-dimensional temporal encoding. We\nachieve record secret-key rates and perform the first field demonstration of\nlarge-alphabet QKD. This demonstrates a new, practical way to optimize\nsecret-key rates and marks an important step towards transmission of\nhigh-dimensional quantum states in deployed networks.\n", "  Intermediate valence compounds containing rare earth or actinide ions are\narchetypal systems for the investigation of strong electron correlations. Their\neffective electron masses of 10 to 50 times the free electron mass result from\na hybridization of the highly localized $f$-electrons with the more itinerant\n$d$-electrons, which is strong enough that their properties are dominated by\non-site electron correlations. To a remarkable degree, this can be modeled by\nthe Anderson Impurity Model, even though the $f$-electrons are situated on a\nperiodic lattice. However, in recent years, there has been increasing evidence\nthat the dynamic magnetic susceptibility of intermediate valence compounds is\nnot purely local, but shows variations across the Brillouin zone that have been\nascribed to $f$-band coherence. So far, this has been based on simplified\nqualitative models. In this article, we present a quantitative comparison of\ninelastic neutron scattering from a single crystal of CePd$_3$, measured in\nfour-dimensional (Q,$\\omega$)-space, with ab initio calculations, which are in\nexcellent agreement on an absolute scale. Our results establish that the\nQ-dependence of the scattering is caused by particle-hole excitations within\n$f$-$d$ hybridized bands that grow in coherence with decreasing temperature.\n"]}
