We observed HD 189733 b with the\nRobert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope of the NRAO over about 5.5 hours before,\nduring and after secondary eclipse, at frequencies of 307 - 347 MHz. In this\nfrequency range, we determine the 3-sigma upper limit to the flux density to be\n81 mJy. The data are consistent with no eclipse or a marginal reduction in flux\nat the time of secondary eclipse in all subsets of our bandwidth; the strongest\nsignal is an apparent eclipse at the 2-sigma level in the 335.2 - 339.3 MHz\nregion. Our observed upper limit is close to theoretical predictions of the\nflux density of cyclotron-maser radiation from the planet.\n", "  We present results from a search for additional transiting planets in 24\nsystems already known to contain a transiting planet. We model the transits due\nto the known planet in each system and subtract these models from lightcurves\nobtained with the SuperWASP survey instruments. These residual lightcurves are\nthen searched for evidence of additional periodic transit events. Although we\ndo not find any evidence for additional planets in any of the planetary systems\nstudied, we are able to characterise our ability to find such planets by means\nof Monte Carlo simulations. Artificially generated transit signals\ncorresponding to planets with a range of sizes and orbital periods were\ninjected into the SuperWASP photometry and the resulting lightcurves searched\nfor planets. As a result, the detection efficiency as a function of both the\nradius and orbital period of any second planet, is calculated. We determine\nthat there is a good (> 50 per cent) chance of detecting additional,\nSaturn-sized planets in P ~ 10 d orbits around planet-hosting stars that have\nseveral seasons of SuperWASP photometry. Additionally, we confirm previous\nevidence of the rotational stellar variability of WASP-10, and refine the\nperiod of rotation. We find that the period of the rotation is 11.91 \\pm 0.05\nd, and the false alarm probability for this period is extremely low (~\n10^{-13}).\n", "  We report ground-based observations at 0.91 microns of the occultation of the\nhot Jupiter WASP-33b by its A5 host star. We measure the planet to be 0.109 +/-\n0.030 per cent as bright as its host star at 0.91 microns. This corresponds to\na brightness temperature, T_B = 3620 +200 -250 K, significantly higher than the\nzero-albedo equilibrium temperature for both isotropic re-radiation (2750 +/-\n37 K) and uniform day-side only re-radiation (3271 +/- 44 K), but consistent\nwith the zero-redistribution temperature (3515 +/- 47 K). This indicates that\nthe heat redistribution from the day-side of WASP-33b to the night side is\ninefficient, and further suggest that there is immediate re-radiation, and\ntherefore little or no redistribution, of heat within the day-side. We also\ndetected the stellar pulsations of WASP-33, which we model as the sum of four\nsinusoids, with periods of between 42 and 77 minutes and amplitudes of 0.5 to\n1.5 mmag.\n", "  We report the discovery, from WASP and CORALIE, of a transiting exoplanet in\na 1.54-d orbit. The host star, WASP-36, is a magnitude V = 12.7, metal-poor G2\ndwarf (Teff = 5959 \\pm 134 K), with [Fe/H] = -0.26 \\pm 0.10. We determine the\nplanet to have mass and radius respectively 2.30 \\pm 0.07 and 1.28 \\pm 0.03\ntimes that of Jupiter.\n  We have eight partial or complete transit light curves, from four different\nobservatories, which allows us to investigate the potential effects on the\nfitted system parameters of using only a single light curve. We find that the\nsolutions obtained by analysing each of these light curves independently are\nconsistent with our global fit to all the data, despite the apparent presence\nof correlated noise in at least two of the light curves.\n", "  Aims. We observe occultations of WASP-24b to measure brightness temperatures\nand to determine whether or not its atmosphere exhibits a thermal inversion\n(stratosphere). Methods. We observed occultations of WASP-24b at 3.6 and 4.5\n{\\mu}m using the Spitzer Space Telescope. It has been suggested that there is a\ncorrelation between stellar activity and the presence of inversions, so we\nanalysed existing HARPS spectra in order to calculate log R'HK for WASP-24 and\nthus determine whether or not the star is chromospherically active. We also\nobserved a transit of WASP-24b in the Str\\\"{o}mgren u and y bands, with the\nCAHA 2.2-m telescope. Results. We measure occultation depths of 0.159 \\pm 0.013\nper cent at 3.6 {\\mu}m and 0.202 \\pm 0.018 per cent at 4.5 {\\mu}m. The\ncorresponding planetary brightness temperatures are 1974 \\pm 71 K and 1944 \\pm\n85 K respectively. Atmosphere models with and without a thermal inversion fit\nthe data equally well; we are unable to constrain the presence of an inversion\nwithout additional occultation measurements in the near-IR. We find log R'HK =\n-4.98 \\pm 0.12, indicating that WASP-24 is not a chromospherically active star.\nOur global analysis of new and previously-published data has refined the system\nparameters, and we find no evidence that the orbit of WASP-24b is non-circular.\nConclusions. These results emphasise the importance of complementing Spitzer\nmeasurements with observations at shorter wavelengths to gain a full\nunderstanding of hot Jupiter atmospheres.\n", "  The sun as an oscillator produces frequencies which propagate in the\nheliosphere, via solar wind, to the terrestrial magnetosphere. We searched for\nthose frequencies in the parameters of the near Earth solar plasma and the\ngeomagnetic indices for the past four solar cycles. The solar wind parameters\nused in this work are the interplanetary magnetic field, plasma beta, Alfven\nMach number, solar wind speed, plasma temperature, plasma pressure, plasma\ndensity and the geomagnetic indices DST, AE, Ap and Kp. We found out that each\nparameter of the solar wind exhibit certain periodicities which differentiate\nin each cycle. Our results indicate intermittent periodicities in our data,\nsome of them shared between the solar wind parameters and geomagnetic indices.\n", "  We analyze the quantum states of two atoms in a combined harmonic oscillator\nand periodic lattice trap in one spatial dimension. In the case of\ntight-binding and only nearest neighbor tunneling, the equations of motion are\nconveniently represented in the momentum representation. We show that in the\ncase of strong attraction between the particles, the different time scales of\nrelative and center-of-mass motion validate a separation of the problem similar\nto the Born-Oppenheimer approximation applied in the description of electronic\nand nuclear motion in molecules.\n", "  We study properties of a trapped dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in a\ncircular ring or a spherical shell using the mean-field Gross-Pitaevskii\nequation. In the case of the ring-shaped trap we consider different\norientations of the ring with respect to the polarization direction of the\ndipoles. In the presence of long-range anisotropic dipolar and short-range\ncontact interactions, the anisotropic density distribution of the dipolar BEC\nin both traps is discussed in detail. The stability condition of the dipolar\nBEC in both traps is illustrated in phase plot of dipolar and contact\ninteractions. We also study and discuss the properties of a vortex dipolar BEC\nin these traps.\n", "  The Higgs boson is the most anticipated discovery at the LHC, which can only\npartially explore its true nature. Thus one of the most compelling arguments to\nbuild a future linear collider is to investigate properties of the Higgs boson,\nespecially to test the predicted linear dependence of the branching ratios on\nthe mass of the final state. At a 3TeV CLIC machine the Higgs boson production\ncross section is relatively large and allows for a precision measurement of the\nHiggs branching ratio to pairs of b and c quarks, and even to muons. The cross\nsection times branching ratio of the decays $H\\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$,\n$H\\rightarrow c\\bar{c}$ and $H\\rightarrow \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ can be measured with\na statistical uncertainty of approximately 0.22%, 3.2% and 15%, respectively.\n", "  The pressure dependence, up to 11.3 kbar, of basic parameters of the\nsuperconducting state, such as the critical temperature (Tc), the lower and the\nupper critical fields, the coherence length, the penetration depth, and their\nanisotropy, was determined from magnetic measurements performed for two\nsinglecrystalline samples of FeTe0.5Se0.5. We have found pressure-induced\nenhancement of all of the superconducting state properties, which entails a\ngrowth of the density of superconducting carriers. However, we noticed more\npronounced increase in superconducting carrier density under pressure than that\nin the critical temperature what may indicate an appearance of a mechanism\nlimiting the increase of Tc with pressure. We have observed that the critical\ncurrent density increases under pressure by at least one order of magnitude.\n", "  Our main purpose is to estimate the effect of assuming uniform density on the\nline-of-sight in PDR chemistry models, compared to a more realistic\ndistribution for which total gas densities may well vary by several orders of\nmagnitude. A secondary goal of this paper is to estimate the amount of\nmolecular hydrogen which is not properly traced by the CO (J = 1 -> 0) line,\nthe so-called \"dark molecular gas\". We use results from a magnetohydrodynamical\n(MHD) simulation as a model for the density structures found in a turbulent\ndiffuse ISM with no star-formation activity. The Meudon PDR code is then\napplied to a number of lines of sight through this model, to derive their\nchemical structures. It is found that, compared to the uniform density\nassumption, maximal chemical abundances for H2, CO, CH and CN are increased by\na factor 2 to 4 when taking into account density fluctuations on the line of\nsight. The correlations between column densities of CO, CH and CN with respect\nto those of H2 are also found to be in better overall agreement with\nobservations. For instance, at N(H2) > 2.10^{20} cm-2, while observations\nsuggest that d[log N(CO)]=d[log N(H2)] = 3.07 +/- 0.73, we find d[log\nN(CO)]=d[log N(H2)] =14 when assuming uniform density, and d[log N(CO)]=d[log\nN(H2)] = 5.2 when including density fluctuations.\n", "  We calculate the dust formed around AGB and SAGB stars of metallicity Z=0.008\nby following the evolution of models with masses in the range 1M<M<8M\nthroughthe thermal pulses phase, and assuming that dust forms via condensation\nof molecules within a wind expanding isotropically from the stellar surface. We\nfind that, because of the strong Hot Bottom Burning (HBB) experienced, high\nmass models produce silicates, whereas lower mass objects are predicted to be\nsurrounded by carbonaceous grains; the transition between the two regimes\noccurs at a threshold mass of 3.5M. These fndings are consistent with the\nresults presented in a previous investigation, for Z=0.001. However, in the\npresent higher metallicity case, the production of silicates in the more\nmassive stars continues for the whole AGB phase, because the HBB experienced is\nsofter at Z=0.008 than at Z=0.001, thus the oxygen in the envelope, essential\nfor the formation of water molecules, is never consumed completely. The total\namount of dust formed for a given mass experiencing HBB increases with\nmetallicity, because of the higher abundance of silicon, and the softer HBB,\nboth factors favouring a higher rate of silicates production. This behaviour is\nnot found in low mass stars,because the carbon enrichment of the stellar\nsurface layers, due to repeated Third Drege Up episodes, is almost independent\nof the metallicity. Regarding cosmic dust enrichment by intermediate mass\nstars, we find that the cosmic yield at Z=0.008 is a factor 5 larger than at\nZ=0.001. In the lower metallicity case carbon dust dominates after about 300\nMyr, but at Z=0.008 the dust mass is dominated by silicates at all times,with a\nprompt enrichment occurring after about 40 Myr, associated with the evolution\nof stars with masses M =7.5 -8M.\n", "  In this letter we show numerical existence of O(4) Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI)\nTextures living in (N +1) dimensional spacetime. These defects are\ncharacterized by $S^N\\rightarrow S^3$ mapping, generalizing the well-known Hopf\nfibration into ?$\\pi_N (S^3)$, for all N > 3. The nonlinear nature of DBI\nkinetic term provides stability against size perturbation and thus renders the\ndefects having natural scale.\n", "  f(T) gravity, a generally modified teleparallel gravity, has become very\npopular in recent times as it is able to reproduce the unification of inflation\nand late-time acceleration without the need of a dark energy component or an\ninflation field. In this present work, we investigate specifically the range of\nvalidity of Birkhoff's theorem with the general tetrad field via perturbative\napproach. At zero order, Birkhoff's theorem is valid and the solution is the\nwell known Schwarzschild-(A)dS metric. Then considering the special case of the\ndiagonal tetrad field, we present a new spherically symmetric solution in the\nframe of f(T) gravity up to the perturbative order. The results with the\ndiagonal tetrad field satisfy the physical equivalence between the Jordan and\nthe so-called Einstein frames, which are realized via conformal transformation,\nat least up to the first perturbative order.\n", "  Finite geometry is used to underpin finite, two d-dimensional particles\nHilbert space, d=prime 6= 2. A central role is allotted to states with mutual\nunbiased bases (MUB) labeling. Dual affine plane geometry (DAPG) points\nunderpin single particle, MUB labeled, product states. The DAPG lines are shown\nto underpin maximally entangled states which form an orthonormal basis spanning\nthe space. The relevance of mutually unbiased collective coordinates bases\n(MUCB) for dealing with maximally entangled states is discussed and shown to\nprovide an economic alternative mode of study. These maximally entangled,\ngeometrically reasoned states, provide the resource to a transparent solution\nto what may be termed tracking of the Mean King Problem (MKP): here Alice\nprepares a state measured by King along some orientation which Alice succeed in\nidentifying with a subsequent measurement. Brief expositions of the topics\nconsidered: MUB, DAPG, MUCB and the MKP are included, rendering the paper self\ncontained.\n", "  We investigate multi-spacecraft observations of the January 17, 2010 solar\nenergetic particle event. Energetic electrons and protons have been observed\nover a remarkable large longitudinal range at the two STEREO spacecraft and\nSOHO suggesting a longitudinal spread of nearly 360 degrees at 1AU. The flaring\nactive region, which was on the backside of the Sun as seen from Earth, was\nseparated by more than 100 degrees in longitude from the magnetic footpoints of\neach of the three spacecraft. The event is characterized by strongly delayed\nenergetic particle onsets with respect to the flare and only small or no\nanisotropies in the intensity measurements at all three locations. The presence\nof a coronal shock is evidenced by the observation of a type II radio burst\nfrom the Earth and STEREO B. In order to describe the observations in terms of\nparticle transport in the interplanetary medium, including perpendicular\ndiffusion, a 1D model describing the propagation along a magnetic field line\n(model 1) (Dr\\\"oge, 2003) and the 3D propagation model (model 2) by (Dr\\\"oge et\nal., 2010) including perpendicular diffusion in the interplanetary medium have\nbeen applied, respectively. While both models are capable of reproducing the\nobservations, model 1 requires injection functions at the Sun of several hours.\nModel 2, which includes lateral transport in the solar wind, reveals high\nvalues for the ratio of perpendicular to parallel diffusion. Because we do not\nfind evidence for unusual long injection functions at the Sun we favor a\nscenario with strong perpendicular transport in the interplanetary medium as\nexplanation for the observations.\n", "  We use a quantum Monte Carlo method to investigate various classes of 2D spin\nmodels with long-range interactions at low temperatures. In particular, we\nstudy a dipolar XXZ model with U(1) symmetry that appears as a hard-core boson\nlimit of an extended Hubbard model describing polarized dipolar atoms or\nmolecules in an optical lattice. Tunneling, in such a model, is short-range,\nwhereas density-density couplings decay with distance following a cubic power\nlaw. We investigate also an XXZ model with long-range couplings of all three\nspin components - such a model describes a system of ultracold ions in a\nlattice of microtraps. We describe an approximate phase diagram for such\nsystems at zero and at finite temperature, and compare their properties. In\nparticular, we compare the extent of crystalline, super?uid, and supersolid\nphases. Our predictions apply directly to current experiments with mesoscopic\nnumbers of polar molecules and trapped ions.\n", "  In this paper we explore the phase diagram and excitations of a distorted\ntriangular lattice antiferromagnet. The unique two-dimensional distortion\nconsidered here is very different from the 'isosceles'-type distortion that has\nbeen extensively investigated. We show that it is able to stabilize a 120{\\deg}\nspin structure for a large range of exchange interaction values, while new\nstructures are found for extreme distortions. A physical realization of this\nmodel is \\alpha-CaCr2O4 which has 120{\\deg} structure but lies very close to\nthe phase boundary. This is verified by inelastic neutron scattering which\nreveals unusual roton-like minima at reciprocal space points different from\nthose corresponding to the magnetic order.\n", "  We study a random walk model in which the jumping probability to a site is\ndependent on the number of previous visits to the site, as a model of the\nmobility with memory. To this end we introduce two parameters called the memory\nparameter alpha and the impulse parameter p. From extensive numerical\nsimulations, we found that various limited mobility patterns such as\nsub-diffusion, trapping, and logarithmic diffusion could be observed. By the\nmemory, a long-ranged directional anti-correlation kinetically-induces\nanomalous sub-diffusive and trapping behaviors, and transition between them.\nWith random jumps by the impulse parameter, a trapped walker can escape from\nthe trap very slowly, resulting in an ultraslow logarithmic diffusive behavior.\nOur results suggest that the memory of walker's has-beens can be one mechanism\nexplaining many of empirical characteristics of the mobility of animated\nobjects.\n", "  In this paper, we construct for the first time the non-commutative fluid with\nthe deformed Poincare invariance. To this end, the realization formalism of the\nnoncommutative spaces is employed and the results are particularized to the\nSnyder space. The non-commutative fluid generalizes the fluid model in the\naction functional formulation to the noncommutative space. The fluid equations\nof motion and the conserved energy-momentum tensor are obtained.\n", "  Neutron powder diffraction has been used to investigate the structural and\nmagnetic behavior of the isoelectronically doped Fe pnictide material\nPrFe1-xRuxAsO. Substitution of Ru for Fe suppresses the structural and magnetic\nphase transitions that occur in the undoped compound PrFeAsO. Contrary to the\nbehavior usually observed in 1111 pnictide materials, the suppression of both\nthe structural and magnetic transitions does not result in the emergence of\nsuperconductivity or any other new ground state. Interestingly, PrFeAsO itself\nshows an unusual negative thermal expansion (NTE) along the c-axis, from 60K\ndown to at least 4K; this does not occur in superconducting samples such as\nthose formed by doping with fluorine on the oxygen site. We find that NTE is\npresent for all concentrations of PrFe1-xRuxAsO with x ranging from 0.05 to\n0.75. These results suggest that the absence of superconductivity in these\nmaterials could be related to the presence of NTE.\n", "  One of the principal models of magnetic sensing in migratory birds rests on\nthe quantum spin-dynamics of transient radical pairs created photochemically in\nocular cryptochrome proteins. We consider here the role of electron spin\nentanglement and coherence in determining the sensitivity of a radical\npair-based geomagnetic compass and the origins of the directional response. It\nemerges that the anisotropy of radical pairs formed from spin-polarized\nmolecular triplets could form the basis of a more sensitive compass sensor than\none founded on the conventional hyperfine-anisotropy model. This property\noffers new and more flexible opportunities for the design of biologically\ninspired magnetic compass sensors.\n", "  We derive the Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch (LLB) equation for a two-component\nmagnetic system valid up to the Curie temperature. As an example, we consider\ndisordered GdFeCo ferrimagnet where the ultrafast optically induced\nmagnetization switching under the action of heat alone has been recently\nreported. The two-component LLB equation contains the longitudinal relaxation\nterms responding to the exchange fields from the proper and the neighboring\nsublattices. We show that the sign of the longitudinal relaxation rate at high\ntemperatures can change depending on the dynamical magnetization value and a\ndynamical polarisation of one material by another can occur. We discuss the\ndifferences between the LLB and the Baryakhtar equation, recently used to\nexplain the ultrafast switching in ferrimagnets. The two-component LLB equation\nforms basis for the largescale micromagnetic modeling of nanostructures at high\ntemperatures and ultrashort timescales.\n", "  The recent researches in non equilibrium and far from equilibrium systems\nhave been proved to be useful for their applications in different disciplines\nand many subjects. A general principle to approach all these phenomena with a\nunique method of analysis is required in science and engineering: a variational\nprinciple would have this fundamental role. Here, the Gouy-Stodola theorem is\nproposed to be this general variational principle, both proving that it\nsatisfies the above requirements and relating it to a statistical results on\nentropy production.\n", "  Accurate electronic structures of the technologically important\nlanthanide/rare earth sesquioxides (Ln2O3, with Ln=La,...,Lu) and CeO2 have\nbeen calculated using hybrid density functionals HSE03, HSE06 and\nscreened-exchange (sX-LDA). We find that these density functional methods\ndescribe the strongly correlated Ln f-electrons as well as the recent\nG0W0@LDA+U results, generally yielding the correct band gaps and trends across\nthe Ln-period. For HSE, the band gap between O 2p states and lanthanide 5d\nstates is nearly independent of the lanthanide, while the minimum gap varies as\nfilled or empty Ln 4f states come into this gap. sX-LDA predicts the unoccupied\n4f levels at higher energies, which leads to a better agreement with\nexperiments for Sm2O3, Eu2O3 and Yb2O3.\n", "  An important class of cryptographic applications of relativistic quantum\ninformation work as follows. B generates a random qudit and supplies it to A at\npoint P. A is supposed to transmit it at near light speed c to to one of a\nnumber of possible pairwise spacelike separated points Q1; : : : ;Qn. A's\ntransmission is supposed to be secure, in the sense that B cannot tell in\nadvance which Qj will be chosen. This poses significant practical challenges,\nsince secure reliable long-range transmission of quantum data at speeds near to\nc is presently not easy. Here we propose different techniques to overcome these\ndifficulties. We introduce protocols that allow secure long-range\nimplementations even when both parties control only widely separated\nlaboratories of small size. In particular we introduce a protocol in which A\nneeds send the qudit only over a short distance, and securely transmits\nclassical information (for instance using a one time pad) over the remaining\ndistance. We further show that by using parallel implementations of the\nprotocols security can be maintained in the presence of moderate amounts of\nlosses and errors.\n", "  We present the investigation of a monoclinic compound SeCuO3 using x-ray\npowder diffraction, magnetization, torque and electron-spin-resonance (ESR).\nStructurally based analysis suggests that SeCuO3 can be considered as a 3D\nnetwork of tetramers. The values of intra-tetramer exchange interactions are\nextracted from the temperature dependence of the susceptibility and amount to\n~200 K. The inter-tetramer coupling leads to the development of long-range\nantiferromagnetic order at TN = 8 K. An unusual temperature dependence of the\neffective g-tensors is observed, accompanied with a rotation of macroscopic\nmagnetic axes. We explain this unique observation as due to site-selective\nquantum correlations.\n", "  In this paper, we present the theoretical studies of a refractive index map\nto implement a Gauss to J0-Bessel-Gauss convertor. We theoretically demonstrate\nthe viability of such device by solving the inverse electromagnetic problem.\nThe computed conversion efficiency is 90%. The theoretical results, obtained\nfrom the beam conversion efficiency, self-regeneration, and propagation through\nan opaque obstruction; demonstrate that a 2D graded index map of the refractive\nindex can be used to transform a Gauss beam into a J0-Bessel-Gauss beam. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of such beam\ntransformation by means of a 2D index-mapping which is fully integrable in\nsilicon photonics based planar lightwave circuits (PLC). The concept device is\nsignificant for the eventual development of a new array of technologies, such\nas micro optical tweezers, optical traps, beam reshaping and non-linear beam\ndiode lasers.\n", "  In this paper, simultaneous reduction of circuit depth and synthesis cost of\nreversible circuits in quantum technologies with limited interaction is\naddressed. We developed a cycle-based synthesis algorithm which uses negative\ncontrols and limited distance between gate lines. To improve circuit depth, a\nnew parallel structure is introduced in which before synthesis a set of\ndisjoint cycles are extracted from the input specification and distributed into\nsome subsets. The cycles of each subset are synthesized independently on\ndifferent sets of ancillae. Accordingly, each disjoint set can be synthesized\nby different synthesis methods. Our analysis shows that the best worst-case\nsynthesis cost of reversible circuits in the linear nearest neighbor\narchitecture is improved by the proposed approach. Our experimental results\nreveal the effectiveness of the proposed approach to reduce cost and circuit\ndepth for several benchmarks.\n", "  Several fundamental issues in establishing security in continuous variable\nquantum key distribution are discussed, in particular on reverse reconciliation\nand security under heterodyne attack. It appears difficult to derive quantum\nadvantage in a concrete realistic protocol due to source and loss\nuncertainties, apart from the problem of bounding Eve's information after\nreconciliation. The necessity of proving robust security for QKD protocols is\nindicated.\n", "  In this paper we describe the way the Astro-WISE information system (or\nsimply Astro-WISE) supports the data from a wide range of in- struments and\ncombines multiple surveys and their catalogues. Astro-WISE allows ingesting of\ndata from any optical instrument, survey or catalogue, pro- cessing of this\ndata to create new catalogues and bringing in data from different surveys into\na single catalogue, keeping all dependencies back to the original data. Full\ndata lineage is kept on each step of compiling a new catalogue with an ability\nto add a new data source recursively. With these features, Astro- WISE allows\nnot only combining and retrieving data from multiple surveys, but performing\nscientific data reduction and data mining down to the rawest data in the data\nprocessing chain within a single environment.\n", "  We report the discovery by the WASP transit survey of a highly-irradiated,\nmassive (2.242 +/- 0.080 MJup) planet which transits a bright (V = 10.6),\nevolved F8 star every 2.9 days. The planet, WASP-71b, is larger than Jupiter\n(1.46 +/- 0.13 RJup), but less dense (0.71 +/- 0.16 {\\rho}Jup). We also report\nspectroscopic observations made during transit with the CORALIE spectrograph,\nwhich allow us to make a highly-significant detection of the\nRossiter-McLaughlin effect. We determine the sky-projected angle between the\nstellar-spin and planetary-orbit axes to be {\\lambda} = 20.1 +/- 9.7 degrees,\ni.e. the system is 'aligned', according to the widely-used alignment criteria\nthat systems are regarded as misaligned only when {\\lambda} is measured to be\ngreater than 10 degrees with 3-{\\sigma} confidence. WASP-71, with an effective\ntemperature of 6059 +/- 98 K, therefore fits the previously observed pattern\nthat only stars hotter than 6250 K are host to planets in misaligned orbits. We\nemphasise, however, that {\\lambda} is merely the sky-projected obliquity angle;\nwe are unable to determine whether the stellar-spin and planetary-orbit axes\nare misaligned along the line-of-sight. With a mass of 1.56 +/- 0.07 Msun,\nWASP-71 was previously hotter than 6250 K, and therefore might have been\nsignificantly misaligned in the past. If so, the planetary orbit has been\nrealigned, presumably through tidal interactions with the cooling star's\ngrowing convective zone.\n", "  Grothendieck's dessins d'enfants arise with ever-increasing frequency in many\nareas of 21st century mathematical physics. In this paper, we review the\nconnections between dessins and the theory of Hecke groups. Focussing on the\nrestricted class of highly symmetric dessins corresponding to the so-called\nArchimedean solids, we apply this theory in order to provide a means of\ncomputing representatives of the associated conjugacy classes of Hecke\nsubgroups in each case. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that dessins\narising in mathematical physics can point to new and hitherto unexpected\ndirections for further research. In addition, given the particular ubiquity of\nmany of the dessins corresponding to the Archimedean solids, the hope is that\nthe computational results of this paper will prove useful in the further study\nof these objects in mathematical physics contexts.\n", "  Individuals in free societies frequently exhibit striking coordination when\nmaking independent decisions en masse. Examples include the regular appearance\nof hit products or memes with substantially higher popularity compared to their\notherwise equivalent competitors, or extreme polarization in public opinion.\nSuch segregation of events manifests as bimodality in the distribution of\ncollective choices. Here we quantify how apparently independent choices made by\nindividuals result in a significantly polarized but stable distribution of\nsuccess in the context of the box-office performance of movies and show that it\nis an emergent feature of a system of non-interacting agents who respond to\nsequentially arriving signals. The aggregate response exhibits extreme\nvariability amplifying much smaller differences in individual cost of adoption.\nDue to self-organization of the competitive landscape, most events elicit only\na muted response but a few stimulate widespread adoption, emerging as \"hits\".\n", "  We present our technique to create a magneto-optical trap for dysprosium\natoms using the narrow-line cooling transition at 626$\\,$nm to achieve suitable\nconditions for direct loading into an optical dipole trap. The magneto-optical\ntrap is loaded from an atomic beam via a Zeeman slower using the strongest\natomic transition at 421$\\,$nm. With this combination of two cooling\ntransitions we can trap up to $2.0\\cdot10^8$ atoms at temperatures down to 6$\\,\n\\mu$K. This cooling approach is simpler than present work with ultracold\ndysprosium and provides similar starting conditions for a transfer to an\noptical dipole trap.\n", "  We consider superfluidity and quantum vorticity in rotating spacetimes. The\nsystem is described by a complex scalar satisfying a nonlinear Klein-Gordon\nequation. Rotation terms are identified and found to lead to the transfer of\nangular momentum of the spacetime to the scalar field. The scalar field\nresponds by rotating, physically behaving as a superfluid, through the creation\nof quantized vortices. We demonstrate the vortex nucleation through numerical\nsimulation.\n", "  Simple examples are used to introduce and examine symmetries of open quantum\ndynamics that can be described by unitary operators. For the Hamiltonian\ndynamics of an entire closed system, the symmetry takes the expected form\nwhich, when the Hamiltonian has a lower bound, says that the unitary symmetry\noperator commutes with the Hamiltonian operator. There are many more symmetries\nthat are only for the open dynamics of a subsystem. Examples show how these\nsymmetries alone can reveal properties of the dynamics and reduce what needs to\nbe done to work out the dynamics. A symmetry of the open dynamics of a\nsubsystem can even imply properties of the dynamics for the entire system that\nare not implied by the symmetries of the dynamics of the entire system. The\nsymmetries are generally not related to constants of the motion for the open\ndynamics of the subsystem. There are many symmetries that cannot be seen in the\nSchrodinger picture as symmetries of dynamical maps of density matrices for the\nsubsystem.\n  There are symmetries of the open dynamics of a subsystem that depend only on\nthe dynamics. In the simplest examples, these are also symmetries of the\ndynamics of the entire system. There are many more symmetries, of a new kind,\nthat also depend on correlations, or absence of correlations, between the\nsubsystem and the rest of the entire system, or on the state of the rest of the\nentire system.\n", "  Dependent symmetries, symmetries that depend on the situation of the\nsubsystem in a larger closed system, are explored by looking at simple\nexamples. This is a new kind of symmetry in the open quantum dynamics of a\nsubsystem\n  Each symmetry implies a particular form for the results of the open dynamics.\nThe forms exhibit the symmetries very simply. It is shown directly, without\nassuming anything about the symmetry, that the dynamics produces the form, but\nknowing the symmetry and the form it implies can reduce what needs to be done\nto work out the dynamics; pieces can be deduced from the symmetry rather that\ncalculated from the dynamics.\n  Symmetries can be related to constants of the motion in new ways. A quantity\nmight be a dependent constant of the motion, constant only for particular\nsituations of the subsystem in the larger system. In particular, a generator of\ndependent symmetries could represent a quantity that is a dependent constant of\nthe motion for the same situations as for the symmetries. The examples present\na variety of possibilities. Sometimes a generator of dependent symmetries does\nrepresent a dependent constant of the motion. Sometimes it does not. Sometimes\nno quantity is a dependent constant of the motion. Sometimes every quantity is.\n", "  Angiogenesis involves the formation of new blood vessels by sprouting or\nsplitting of existing blood vessels. During sprouting, a highly motile type of\nendothelial cell, called the tip cell, migrates from the blood vessels followed\nby stalk cells, an endothelial cell type that forms the body of the sprout. To\nget more insight into how tip cells contribute to angiogenesis, we extended an\nexisting computational model of vascular network formation based on the\ncellular Potts model with tip and stalk differentiation, without making a\npriori assumptions about the differences between tip cells and stalk cells. To\npredict potential differences, we looked for parameter values that make tip\ncells (a) move to the sprout tip, and (b) change the morphology of the\nangiogenic networks. The screening predicted that if tip cells respond less\neffectively to an endothelial chemoattractant than stalk cells, they move to\nthe tips of the sprouts, which impacts the morphology of the networks. A\ncomparison of this model prediction with genes expressed differentially in tip\nand stalk cells revealed that the endothelial chemoattractant Apelin and its\nreceptor APJ may match the model prediction. To test the model prediction we\ninhibited Apelin signaling in our model and in an \\emph{in vitro} model of\nangiogenic sprouting, and found that in both cases inhibition of Apelin or of\nits receptor APJ reduces sprouting. Based on the prediction of the\ncomputational model, we propose that the differential expression of Apelin and\nAPJ yields a \"self-generated\" gradient mechanisms that accelerates the\nextension of the sprout.\n", "  Human beings do not observe the world from the outside, but rather are fully\nembedded in it. The sciences, however, often give the observer both a \"god's\neye\" perspective and substantial a~priori knowledge. Motivated by W. Ross\nAshby's statement, \"the theory of the Black Box is merely the theory of real\nobjects or systems, when close attention is given to the question, relating\nobject and observer, about what information comes from the object, and how it\nis obtained\" (Introduction to Cybernetics, 1956, p. 110), I develop here an\nalternate picture of the world as a black box to which the observer is coupled.\nWithin this framework I prove purely-classical analogs of the \"no-go\" theorems\nof quantum theory. Focussing on the question of identifying macroscopic\nobjects, such as laboratory apparatus or even other observers, I show that the\nstandard quantum formalism of superposition is required to adequately represent\nthe classical information that an observer can obtain. I relate these results\nto supporting considerations from evolutionary biology, cognitive and\ndevelopmental psychology, and artificial intelligence.\n", "  It is well known that quantum correlations for bipartite dichotomic\nmeasurements are those of the form $\\gamma=(\\langle u_i,v_j\\rangle)_{i,j=1}^n$,\nwhere the vectors $u_i$ and $v_j$ are in the unit ball of a real Hilbert space.\nIn this work we study the probability of the nonlocal nature of these\ncorrelations as a function of $\\alpha=\\frac{m}{n}$, where the previous vectors\nare sampled according to the Haar measure in the unit sphere of $\\mathbb R^m$.\nIn particular, we prove the existence of an $\\alpha_0>0$ such that if\n$\\alpha\\leq \\alpha_0$, $\\gamma$ is nonlocal with probability tending to $1$ as\n$n\\rightarrow \\infty$, while for $\\alpha> 2$, $\\gamma$ is local with\nprobability tending to $1$ as $n\\rightarrow \\infty$.\n", "  In this work we explicitly calculate the thermal conductivity for a general\nbidimensional dilute gas of neutral molecules by solving Boltzmann's equation.\nChapman-Enskog's method is used in order to analytically obtain this transport\ncoefficient to first approximation in terms of a collision integral for an\nunspecified molecular interaction model. In the particular case of hard disks\ninteractions, the result is shown to be consistent with previous work by J. V.\nSengers \\cite{Sengers}, yielding the expected $T^{1/2}$ dependence with the\ntemperature. This dependence is widely used for dense gases as the low density\nlimit in the Enskog expansion. The case of Maxwellian molecules is also\nexplored where a linear dependence with the temperature is obtained.\n", "  One of the most fundamental features of a black hole in general relativity is\nits event horizon: a boundary from which nothing can escape. There has been a\nrecent surge of interest in the nature of these event horizons and their local\nneighbourhoods. In an attempt to resolve black hole information paradox(es),\nand more generally, to better understand the path towards quantum gravity,\n\"firewalls\" have been proposed as an alternative to black hole event horizons.\nIn this paper, we explore the phenomenological implications of black holes\npossessing a surface or \"firewall\", and predict a potentially detectable\nsignature of these firewalls in the form of a high energy astrophysical\nneutrino flux. We compute the spectrum of this neutrino flux in different\nmodels and show that it is a possible candidate for the source of the PeV\nneutrinos recently detected by IceCube. This opens up a new area of research,\nbridging the non-perturbative physics of quantum gravity with the observational\nblack hole and high energy astrophysics.\n", "  The Majorana Demonstrator is an ultra-low background physics experiment\nsearching for the neutrinoless double beta decay of $^{76}$Ge. The Majorana\nParts Tracking Database is used to record the history of components used in the\nconstruction of the Demonstrator. The tracking implementation takes a novel\napproach based on the schema-free database technology CouchDB. Transportation,\nstorage, and processes undergone by parts such as machining or cleaning are\nlinked to part records. Tracking parts provides a great logistics benefit and\nan important quality assurance reference during construction. In addition, the\nlocation history of parts provides an estimate of their exposure to cosmic\nradiation. A web application for data entry and a radiation exposure calculator\nhave been developed as tools for achieving the extreme radio-purity required\nfor this rare decay search.\n", "  A search for a heavy Higgs boson in the H to WW and H to ZZ decay channels is\nreported. The search is based upon proton-proton collision data samples\ncorresponding to an integrated luminosity of up to 5.1 inverse femtobarns at\nsqrt(s) = 7 TeV and up to 19.7 inverse femtobarns at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV, recorded\nby the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC. Several final states of the H to WW and\nH to ZZ decays are analyzed. The combined upper limit at the 95% confidence\nlevel on the product of the cross section and branching fraction exclude a\nHiggs boson with standard model-like couplings and decays in the range 145 <\nm[H] < 1000 GeV. We also interpret the results in the context of an electroweak\nsinglet extension of the standard model.\n", "  The effects of a non-gradient flux term originating from the motion of\nconvective elements with entropy perturbations of either sign are investigated\nand incorporated into a modified version of stellar mixing length theory (MLT).\nSuch a term, first studied by Deardorff in the meteorological context, might\nrepresent the effects of cold intense downdrafts caused by the rapid cooling in\nthe granulation layer at the top of the convection zone of late-type stars.\nSuch intense downdrafts were first seen in the strongly stratified simulations\nof Stein & Nordlund in the late 1980s. These downdrafts transport heat\nnonlocally, a phenomenon referred to as entropy rain. Moreover, the Deardorff\nterm can cause upward enthalpy transport even in a weakly Schwarzschild-stably\nstratified layer. In that case, no giant cell convection would be excited. This\nis interest in view of recent observations, which could be explained if the\ndominant flow structures were of small scale even at larger depths. To study\nthis possibility, three distinct flow structures are examined: one in which\nconvective structures have similar size and mutual separation at all depths,\none in which the separation increases with depth, but their size is still\nunchanged, and one in which both size and separation increase with depth, which\nis the standard flow structure. It is concluded that the third possibility with\nfewer and thicker downdrafts in deeper layers remains most plausible, but it\nmay be unable to explain the suspected absence of large-scale flows with speeds\nand scales expected from MLT.\n", "  Recently it has been introduced an algorithm Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH)\nformula, which extends the Van-Brunt and Visser recent results, leading to new\nclosed forms of BCH formula. More recently, it has been shown that there are\n{\\it 13 types} of such commutator algebras. We show, by providing the explicit\nsolutions, that these include the generators of the semisimple complex Lie\nalgebras. More precisely, for any pair, $X$, $Y$ of the Cartan-Weyl basis, we\nfind $W$, linear combination of $X$, $Y$, such that $$ \\exp(X) \\exp(Y)=\\exp(W)\n$$ The derivation of such closed forms follows, in part, by using the above\nmentioned recent results. The complete derivation is provided by considering\nthe structure of of the root system. Furthermore, if $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ are three\ngenerators of the Cartan-Weyl basis, we find, for a wide class of cases, $W$,\nlinear combination of $X$, $Y$ and $Z$, such that $$ \\exp(X) \\exp(Y)\n\\exp(Z)=\\exp(W) $$ It turns out that the relevant commutator algebras are {\\it\ntype 1c-i}, {\\it type 4} and {\\it type 5}. A key result concerns an iterative\napplication of the algorithm leading to relevant extensions of the cases\nadmitting closed forms of the BCH formula. Here we provide the main steps of\nsuch an iteration that will be developed in a forthcoming paper.\n", "  While it is well-known that quantum mechanics can be reformulated in terms of\na path integral representation, it will be shown that such a formulation is\nalso possible in the case of classical mechanics. From Koopman-von Neumann\ntheory, which recasts classical mechanics in terms of a Hilbert space wherein\nthe Liouville operator acts as the generator of motion, we derive a path\nintegral representation of the classical propagator and suggest an efficient\nnumerical implementation using fast fourier transform techniques. We then\ninclude a first quantum correction to derive a revealing expression for the\nsemi-classical path integral, which augments the classical picture of a single\ntrajectory through phase space with additional wave-like spreading.\n", "  In this paper we study the quantum cosmological Kantowski-Sachs model and\nsolve the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in minisuperspace to obtain the wave function\nof the corresponding universe. The perfect fluid is described by the Schutz's\ncanonical formalism, which allows to attribute dynamical degrees of freedom to\nmatter. The time is introduced phenomenologically using the fluid's degrees of\nfreedom. In particular, we adopt a stiff matter fluid. The viability of this\nmodel is analyzed and discussed.\n", "  The present study gives an account of the effect of Li2O on the ease of phase\nformation and superconducting properties of Tl2Ba2Ca2Cu3O10+x (Tl-2223)\nmaterial. Li substitution only slightly decreases the superconducting\ntransition temperature, while the optimal concentration of 20% doping improves\nthe critical current density (Jc) by ~ two fold. We found substantial effects\non the synthesis temperature, microstructure and normal state transport\nproperties of Tl-2223 with Li2O addition. Short-time thermal annealing under\nflowing Ar+4%H2 (1 hr.) further improves the superconducting volume fractions,\nas well as Jc.\n", "  We analyze the power output of a quantum dot machine coupled to two\nelectronic reservoirs via thermoelectric contacts, and to two thermal\nreservoirs - one hot and one cold. This machine is a nanoscale analogue of a\nconventional thermocouple heat-engine, in which the active region being heated\nis unavoidably also exchanging heat with its cold environment. Heat exchange\nbetween the dot and the thermal reservoirs is treated as a capacitive coupling\nto electronic fluctuations in localized levels, modeled as two additional\nquantum dots. The resulting multiple-dot setup is described using a master\nequation approach. We observe an \"exotic\" power generation, which remains\nfinite even when the heat absorbed from the thermal reservoirs is zero (in\nother words the heat coming from the hot reservoir all escapes into the cold\nenvironment). This effect can be understood in terms of a non-local effect in\nwhich the heat flow from heat source to the cold environment generates power\nvia a mechanism which we refer to as Coulomb heat drag. It relies on the fact\nthat there is no relaxation in the quantum dot system, so electrons within it\nhave a non-thermal energy distribution. More poetically, one can say that we\nfind a spatial separation of the first-law of thermodynamics (heat to work\nconversion) from the second-law of thermodynamics (generation of entropy). We\npresent circumstances in which this non-thermal system can generate more power\nthan any conventional macroscopic thermocouple (with local thermalization),\neven when the latter works with Carnot efficiency.\n", "  Progress in the calculation of the electromagnetic properties of baryon\nexcitations in lattice QCD is presenting new challenges in the determination of\nsea-quark loop contributions to matrix elements. A reliable estimation of the\nsea-quark loop contributions presents a pressing issue in the accurate\ncomparison of lattice QCD results with experiment. In this article, an\nextension of the graded symmetry approach to partially quenched QCD is\npresented, which builds on previous theory by explicitly including\nflavor-singlet baryons in its construction. The formalism takes into account\nthe interactions among both octet and singlet baryons, octet mesons, and their\nghost counterparts; the latter enables the isolation of the quark-flow\ndisconnected sea-quark loop contributions. The introduction of the\nflavor-singlet states anticipates the application of the method to baryon\nexcitations such as the lowest-lying odd-parity Lambda baryon, the\nLambda(1405), which is considered in detail as a worked example.\n", "  Within the BaFe2As2 crystal lattice, we partially substitute thallium for\nbarium and report the effects of interlayer coupling in Ba1-xTlxFe2As2\ncrystals. We demonstrate the unusual effects of magneto-elastic coupling and\ncharge doping in this iron-arsenide material, whereby Neel temperature rises\nwith small x, and then falls with additional x. Specifically, we find that Neel\nand structural transitions in BaFe2As2 (TN =Ts= 133 K) increase for x=0.05 (TN\n= 138 K, Ts = 140 K) from magnetization, heat capacity, resistivity, and\nneutron diffraction measurements. Evidence from single crystal X-ray\ndiffraction and first principles calculations attributes the stronger magnetism\nin x=0.05 to magneto-elastic coupling related to the shorter intraplanar Fe-Fe\nbond distance. With further thallium substitution, the transition temperatures\ndecrease for x = 0.09 (TN = Ts = 131 K), and this is due to charge doping. We\nillustrate that small changes related to 3d transition-metal state can have\nprofound effects on magnetism.\n", "  We give bijections between bipolar-oriented (acyclic with unique source and\nsink) planar maps and certain random walks, which show that the uniformly\nrandom bipolar-oriented planar map, decorated by the \"peano curve\" surrounding\nthe tree of left-most paths to the sink, converges in law with respect to the\npeanosphere topology to a $\\sqrt{4/3}$-Liouville quantum gravity surface\ndecorated by an independent Schramm-Loewner evolution with parameter\n$\\kappa=12$ (i.e., SLE$_{12}$). This result is universal in the sense that it\nholds for bipolar-oriented triangulations, quadrangulations, $k$-angulations,\nand maps in which face sizes are mixed.\n", "  The effective field theory of inflation is a powerful tool for obtaining\nmodel independent predictions common to large classes of inflationary models.\nIt requires only information about the symmetries broken during the\ninflationary era, and on the number and nature of fields that drive inflation.\nIn this paper, we consider the case for scenarios that simultaneously break\ntime reparameterization and spatial diffeomorphisms during inflation. We\nexamine how to analyse such systems using an effective field theory approach,\nand we discuss several observational consequences for the statistics of scalar\nand tensor modes. For example, examining the three point functions, we show\nthat this symmetry breaking pattern can lead to an enhanced amplitude for the\nsqueezed bispectra, and to a distinctive angular dependence between their three\nwavevectors. We also discuss how our results indicate prospects for\nconstraining the level of spatial diffeomorphism breaking during inflation.\n", "  We propose a novel possibility of dynamically changing the pairing of\nsuperconductors from $s$ wave to $\\eta$ pairing (where the pairs condense at\nthe Brillouin-zone corner momenta) by driving the system with ac fields. We\nconsider a periodically-driven attractive Hubbard model in the strong-coupling\nregime, and show that the pair-hopping and pair-repulsion terms in the\neffective Hamiltonian in the Floquet formalism are drastically renormalized in\ndifferent manners between the two terms, which can change the ground states\nfrom an $s$-wave superconductivity to an $\\eta$-pairing superconductivity or a\ncharge-ordered phase. While in isolated systems such as cold atoms a simple\nquench scheme would not realize the dynamical phase transition into $\\eta$\npairing, we show that there are pathways that realize the dynamical transition,\nwhere the field amplitude is varied via a charge-ordered phase as an\nintermediate state.\n", "  In experiments on irradiation of metal surfaces by ions of keV energy, the\nemission of X-ray laser beams from the metal was observed not only during the\nirradiation but also 20 hours after it was switched off (from the \"dead\"\nsample). In contrast to an usual laser, the emitted collimated X-ray beams were\nof continuous frequency. In this paper the mechanism of that phenomenon is\nproposed. Subatomic electron states are formed inside the metal. These states\nare associated with anomalous well within the subatomically narrow\n($10^{-11}cm$) region. Anomalous well is formed by the local reduction (of\n$MeV$ scale) in that region of the vacuum energy of the mass-generating field.\nStates in anomalous well are long-living which results in population inversion\nand the subsequent laser generation observed. The energy of emitted X-ray beams\nare due to the conversion of the vacuum energy of the mass-generating field\n(X-ray laser beams from vacuum).\n", "  In this work, we present a result on the non-equilibrium dynamics causing\nequilibration and Gaussification of quadratic non-interacting fermionic\nHamiltonians. Specifically, based on two basic assumptions - clustering of\ncorrelations in the initial state and the Hamiltonian exhibiting delocalizing\ntransport - we prove that non-Gaussian initial states become locally\nindistinguishable from fermionic Gaussian states after a short and well\ncontrolled time. This relaxation dynamics is governed by a power-law\nindependent of the system size. Our argument is general enough to allow for\npure and mixed initial states, including thermal and ground states of\ninteracting Hamiltonians on and large classes of lattices as well as certain\nspin systems. The argument gives rise to rigorously proven instances of a\nconvergence to a generalized Gibbs ensemble. Our results allow to develop an\nintuition of equilibration that is expected to be more generally valid and\nrelates to current experiments of cold atoms in optical lattices.\n", "  The phenomenological analysis of various characteristics of $J/\\psi$ and $D$\nmeson production in PbPb collisions at the center-of-mass energy 2.76 TeV per\nnucleon pair is presented. The data on momentum spectra and elliptic flow are\nreproduced by two-component model HYDJET++ including thermal and non-thermal\ncharm production mechanisms. The significant part of $D$-mesons is found to be\nin a kinetic equilibrium with the created medium, while $J/\\psi$-mesons are\ncharacterized by earlier (as compared to light hadrons) freeze-out.\n", "  We consider two coupled time reversal invariant helical edge modes of the\nsame helicity, such as would occur on two stacked quantum spin Hall insulators.\nIn the presence of interaction, the low energy physics is described by two\ncollective modes, one corresponding to the total current flowing around the\nedge and the other one describing relative fluctuations between the two edges.\nWe find that quite generically, the relative mode becomes gapped at low\ntemperatures, but only when tunneling between the two helical modes is\nnon-zero. There are two distinct possibilities for the gapped state depending\non the relative size of different interactions. If the intra-edge interaction\nis stronger than the inter-edge interaction, the state is characterised as a\nspin-nematic phase. However in the opposite limit, when the interaction between\nthe helical edge modes is strong compared to the interaction within each mode,\na spin-density wave forms, with emergent topological properties. Firstly, the\ngap protects the conducting phase against localization by weak nonmagnetic\nimpurities; and secondly the protected phase hosts localized zero modes on ends\nof the edge that may be created by sufficiently strong non-magnetic impurities.\n", "  Most of the gamma-ray emitting active galactic nuclei (AGN) are blazars,\nalthough there is still a small fraction of non-blazar AGN in the Fermi/LAT\ncatalog. Among these misaligned gamma-ray-emitting AGN, a few can be classified\nas Compact Symmetric Objects (CSOs). In contrast to blazars in which gamma-ray\nemission is generally thought to originate from highly beamed relativistic\njets, the source of gamma-ray emission in unbeamed CSOs remains an open\nquestion. The rarity of the gamma-ray emitting CSOs is a mystery as well. Here\nwe present the radio properties of the gamma-ray CSO candidate 2234+282.\n", "  Nonlocal electrodynamics is a formalism developed to include nonlocal effects\nin the measurement process caused by the non-inertial state of the observers.\nThis theory modifies Maxwell's electrodynamics by eliminating the hypothesis of\nlocality that assumes an accelerated observer simultaneously equivalent to a\ncomoving inertial frame of reference. In this scenario, the transformation\nbetween an inertial and accelerated observer is generalized which affects the\nproperties of physical fields. In particular, we analyze how an uniformly\naccelerated observer perceives a homogeneous and isotropic blackbody radiation.\nWe show that all nonlocal effects are transient and most relevant in the first\nperiod of acceleration.\n", "  In a phase with fractional excitations, topological properties are enriched\nin the presence of global symmetry. In particular, fractional excitations can\ntransform under symmetry in a fractionalized manner, resulting in different\nSymmetry Enriched Topological (SET) phases. While a good deal is now understood\nin $2D$ regarding what symmetry fractionalization patterns are possible, the\nsituation in $3D$ is much more open. A new feature in $3D$ is the existence of\nloop excitations, so to study $3D$ SET phases, first we need to understand how\nto properly describe the fractionalized action of symmetry on loops. Using a\ndimensional reduction procedure, we show that these loop excitations exist as\nthe boundary between two $2D$ SET phases, and the symmetry action is\ncharacterized by the corresponding difference in SET orders. Moreover, similar\nto the $2D$ case, we find that some seemingly possible symmetry\nfractionalization patterns are actually anomalous and cannot be realized\nstrictly in $3D$. We detect such anomalies using the flux fusion method we\nintroduced previously in $2D$. To illustrate these ideas, we use the $3D$ $Z_2$\ngauge theory with $Z_2$ global symmetry as an example, and enumerate and\ndescribe the corresponding SET phases. In particular, we find four\nnon-anomalous SET phases and one anomalous SET phase, which we show can be\nrealized as the surface of a $4D$ system with symmetry protected topological\norder.\n", "  We investigate general features of charged Lovelock black branes by giving a\ndetailed description of geometrical, thermodynamic and holographic properties\nof charged Gauss-Bonnet (GB) black branes in five dimensions. We show that when\nexpressed in terms of effective physical parameters, the thermodynamic\nbehaviour of charged GB black branes is completely indistinguishable from that\nof charged Einstein black branes. Moreover, the extremal, near-horizon limit of\nthe two classes of branes is exactly the same as they allow for the same\nAdS$_2\\times R_3$, near-horizon, exact solution. This implies that, although in\nthe UV the associated dual QFTs are different, they flow in the IR to the same\nfixed point. The calculation of the shear viscosity to entropy ratio $\\eta/s$\nconfirms these results. Despite the GB dual plasma has in general a\nnon-universal temperature-dependent $\\eta/s$, it flows monotonically to the\nuniversal value $1/4\\pi$ in the IR. For negative (positive) GB coupling\nconstant, $\\eta/s$ is an increasing (decreasing) function of the temperature\nand the flow respects (violates) the KSS bound.\n", "  This paper is based on the framework of a two dimensional universe\nconsidering it to be a lattice structure. The {\\it Ising model} has been used\nto show that there is a spontaneous phase transition from the {\\it Planck\nscale} to the {\\it Compton scale}. Also, a mean field theoretic approach has\nbeen considered to delve into the statistical properties of such a\nlattice-structured universe. All this answers questions like matter-antimatter\nasymmetry.\n", "  Thermoelectric devices are heat engines, which operate as generators or\nrefrigerators using the conduction electrons as a working fluid. The\nthermoelectric heat-to-work conversion efficiency has always been typically\nquite low, but much effort continues to be devoted to the design of new\nmaterials boasting improved transport properties that would make them of the\nelectron crystal-phonon glass type of systems. On the other hand, there are\ncomparatively few studies where a proper thermodynamic treatment of the\nelectronic working fluid is proposed. The present article aims to contribute to\nbridge this gap by addressing both the thermodynamic and transport properties\nof the thermoelectric working fluid covering a variety of models, including\ninteracting systems.\n", "  We study the ionization problem in the Thomas-Fermi-Dirac-von Weizs\\\"acker\ntheory for atoms and molecules. We prove the nonexistence of minimizers for the\nenergy functional when the number of electrons is large and the total nuclear\ncharge is small. This nonexistence result also applies to external potentials\ndecaying faster than the Coulomb potential. In the case of arbitrary nuclear\ncharges, we obtain the nonexistence of stable minimizers and radial minimizers.\n", "  We study the transport properties of frustrated itinerant magnets comprising\nlocalized {\\it classical} moments, which interact via exchange with the\nconduction electrons. Strong frustration stabilizes a liquidlike spin state,\nwhich extends down to temperatures well below the effective\nRuderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction scale. The crossover into this state\nis characterized by spin structure factor enhancement at wave vectors smaller\nthan twice the Fermi wave vector magnitude. The corresponding enhancement of\nelectron scattering generates a resistivity upturn at decreasing temperatures.\n", "  Thorough mixing of the starting materials is the first step of a crystal\ngrowth procedure. This holds true for almost any standard technique, whereas\nthe intentional separation of educts is considered to be restricted to a very\nlimited number of cases. A noticeable exception is the crystal growth in gels\nthat allows for a better control of the nucleation by limiting the diffusion.\nThe successful application of this principle to open systems, however, has\nremained elusive. Here we show that single crystals of {\\alpha}-Li2IrO3 can be\ngrown from separated educts in an open crucible in air. Elemental lithium and\niridium are oxidized and transported over a distance of typically one\ncentimeter in an isothermal process. Single crystals grow from an exposed\ncondensation point placed in between the educts. The method has also been\napplied to the growth of Li2RuO3, Li2PtO3 and {\\beta}-Li2IrO3 and a successful\nuse for various other materials is anticipated.\n", "  We investigate thermal transport along a one-dimensional lattice of classical\ninertial rotators, with attractive couplings which decrease with distance as\n$r^{-\\alpha}$ ($\\alpha \\ge 0$), subject at its ends to Brownian heat reservoirs\nat different temperatures with average value $T$. By means of numerical\nintegration of the equations of motion, we show the effects of the range of the\ninteractions in the temperature profile and energy transport, and determine the\ndomain of validity of Fourier's law in this context. We find that Fourier's\nlaw, as signaled by a finite $\\kappa$ in the thermodynamic limit, holds only\nfor sufficiently short range interactions, with $\\alpha >\\alpha_c(T)$. For\n$\\alpha<\\alpha_c(T)$, a kind of insulator behavior emerges at any $T$.\n", "  A model-dependent amplitude analysis of the decay $B^0\\rightarrow\nD(K^0_S\\pi^+\\pi^-) K^{*0}$ is performed using proton-proton collision data\ncorresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.0fb$^{-1}$, recorded at\n$\\sqrt{s}=7$ and $8 TeV$ by the LHCb experiment. The CP violation observables\n$x_{\\pm}$ and $y_{\\pm}$, sensitive to the CKM angle $\\gamma$, are measured to\nbe \\begin{eqnarray*} x_- &=& -0.15 \\pm 0.14 \\pm 0.03 \\pm 0.01, y_- &=& 0.25 \\pm\n0.15 \\pm 0.06 \\pm 0.01, x_+ &=& 0.05 \\pm 0.24 \\pm 0.04 \\pm 0.01, y_+ &=&\n-0.65^{+0.24}_{-0.23} \\pm 0.08 \\pm 0.01, \\end{eqnarray*} where the first\nuncertainties are statistical, the second systematic and the third arise from\nthe uncertainty on the $D\\rightarrow K^0_S \\pi^+\\pi^-$ amplitude model. These\nare the most precise measurements of these observables. They correspond to\n$\\gamma=(80^{+21}_{-22})^{\\circ}$ and $r_{B^0}=0.39\\pm0.13$, where $r_{B^0}$ is\nthe magnitude of the ratio of the suppressed and favoured $B^0\\rightarrow D K^+\n\\pi^-$ decay amplitudes, in a $K\\pi$ mass region of $\\pm50 MeV$ around the\n$K^*(892)^0$ mass and for an absolute value of the cosine of the $K^{*0}$ decay\nangle larger than $0.4$.\n", "  We determine constraints on sterile neutrino warm dark matter through direct\ndetection experiments, taking XENON100, XENON1T and DARWIN as examples. If\nkeV-scale sterile neutrinos scatter inelastically with bound electrons of the\ntarget material, an electron recoil signal is generated. This can be used to\nset limits on the sterile neutrino mass and its mixing with the active sector.\nWhile not competitive with astrophysical constraints from X-ray data, the\nconstraints are the first direct laboratory bounds on sterile neutrino warm\ndark matter, and will be in some parts of parameter space the strongest limits\non keV-scale neutrinos.\n", "  Accurate rational approximations of the Fermi-Dirac distribution are a useful\ncomponent in many numerical algorithms for electronic structure calculations.\nThe best known approximations use $O( \\log (\\beta \\Delta) \\log\n(\\epsilon^{-1}))$ poles to achieve an error tolerance $\\epsilon$ at temperature\n$\\beta^{-1}$ over an energy interval $\\Delta$. We apply minimax approximation\nto reduce the number of poles by a factor of four and replace $\\Delta$ with\n$\\Delta_{\\mathrm{occ}}$, the occupied energy interval. This is particularly\nbeneficial when $\\Delta \\gg \\Delta_{\\mathrm{occ}}$, such as in electronic\nstructure calculations that use a large basis set.\n", "  The results of a search for gluinos in final states with an isolated electron\nor muon, multiple jets and large missing transverse momentum using\nproton--proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV\nare presented. The dataset used was recorded in 2015 by the ATLAS experiment at\nthe Large Hadron Collider and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 3.2\nfb$^{-1}$. Six signal selections are defined that best exploit the signal\ncharacteristics. The data agree with the Standard Model background expectation\nin all six signal selections, and the largest deviation is a 2.1 standard\ndeviation excess. The results are interpreted in a simplified model where\npair-produced gluinos decay via the lightest chargino to the lightest\nneutralino. In this model, gluinos are excluded up to masses of approximately\n1.6 TeV depending on the mass spectrum of the simplified model, thus surpassing\nthe limits of previous searches.\n", "  Arrays of fluorescent nanoparticles are highly sought after for applications\nin sensing and nanophotonics. Here we present a simple and robust method of\nassembling fluorescent nanodiamonds into macroscopic arrays. Remarkably, the\nyield of this directed assembly process is greater than 90% and the assembled\npatterns withstand ultra-sonication for more than three hours. The assembly\nprocess is based on covalent bonding of carboxyl to amine functional carbon\nseeds and is applicable to any material, and to non-planar surfaces. Our\nresults pave the way to directed assembly of sensing and nanophotonics devices.\n", "  Null surfaces act as one-way membranes, blocking information from those\nobservers who do not cross them (e.g., in the black hole and the Rindler\nspacetimes) and these observers associate an entropy (and temperature) with the\nnull surface. The black hole entropy can be computed from the central charge of\nan appropriately defined, local, Virasoro algebra on the horizon. We show that\none can extend these ideas to a general class of null surfaces, all of which\npossess a Virasoro algebra and a central charge, leading to an entropy density\n(i.e., per unit area) which is just $(1/4)$. All the previously known results\nof associating entropy with horizons arise as special cases of this very\ngeneral property of null surfaces demonstrated here and we believe this work\nrepresents the derivation of the entropy-area law in the most general context.\nThe implications are discussed.\n", "  We present a model where the QCD axion is at the TeV scale and visible at a\ncollider via its decays. Conformal dynamics and strong CP considerations\naccount for the axion coupling strongly enough to the standard model to be\nproduced as well as the coincidence between the weak scale and the axion mass.\nThe model predicts additional pseudoscalar color octets whose properties are\ncompletely determined by the axion properties rendering the theory testable.\n", "  Recently quantum nonlocality has been classified into three distinct types:\nquantum entanglement, Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering, and Bell's nonlocality.\nAmong which, Bell's nonlocality is the strongest type. Bell's nonlocality for\nquantum states is usually detected by violation of some Bell's inequalities,\nsuch as Clause-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality for two qubits. Steering is a\nmanifestation of nonlocality intermediate between entanglement and Bell's\nnonlocality. This peculiar feature has led to a curious quantum phenomenon, the\none-way Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering. The one-way steering was an important\nopen question presented in 2007, and positively answered in 2014 by Bowles\n\\emph{et al.}, who presented a simple class of one-way steerable states in a\ntwo-qubit system with at least thirteen projective measurements. The inspiring\nresult for the first time theoretically confirms quantum nonlocality can be\nfundamentally asymmetric. Here, we propose another curious quantum phenomenon:\nBell nonlocal states can be constructed from some steerable states. This novel\nfinding not only offers a distinctive way to study Bell's nonlocality without\nBell's inequality but with steering inequality, but also may avoid locality\nloophole in Bell's tests and make Bell's nonlocality easier for demonstration.\nFurthermore, a nine-setting steering inequality has also been presented for\ndeveloping more efficient one-way steering and detecting some Bell nonlocal\nstates.\n", "  We study Aharonov-Bohm effect in a two-terminal helical ring with long-range\nhopping in presence of Rashba spin-orbit interaction. We explore how the spin\npolarization behavior changes depending on the applied magnetic flux and the\nincoming electron energy. The most interesting feature that we articulate in\nthis system is that zero-energy crossings appear in the energy spectra at\n$\\Phi=0$ and also at integer multiples of half-flux quantum values ($n\n\\Phi_0/2$, $n$ being an integer) of the applied magnetic flux. We investigate\nthe transport properties of the ring using Green's function formalism and find\nthat the zero energy transmission peaks corresponding to those zero energy\ncrossings vanish in presence of Rashba spin-orbit interaction. We also\nincorporate static random disorder in our system and show that the zero energy\ncrossings and transmission peaks are not immune to disorder even in absence of\nRashba spin-orbit interaction. The latter prevents the possibility of behaving\nthese helical states in the ring like topological insulator edge states.\n", "  We study and demonstrate the frequency conversion of UV radiation, resonant\nwith 369.5 nm transition in Yb+ ions to the C-band wavelength 1580.3 nm and\nvice-versa using a reverse proton-exchanged waveguide in periodically poled\nlithium niobate. Our integrated device can interface trapped Yb+ ions with\ntelecom infrastructure for the realization of an Yb+ based quantum repeater\nprotocol and to efficiently distribute entanglement over long distances. We\nanalyse the single photon frequency conversion efficiency from the 369.525 nm\nto the telecom wavelength and its dependence on pump power, device length and\ntemperature. The single-photon noise generated by spontaneous Raman scattering\nof the pump is also measured. From this analysis we estimate a single photon\nconversion efficiency of 9% is achievable with our technology with almost\ncomplete suppression of the Raman noise.\n", "  Trapped ions are one of the most promising approaches for the realization of\na universal quantum computer. Faster quantum logic gates could dramatically\nimprove the performance of trapped-ion quantum computers, and require the\ndevelopment of suitable high repetition rate pulsed lasers. Here we report on a\nrobust frequency upconverted fiber laser based source, able to deliver 2.5 ps\nultraviolet (UV) pulses at a stabilized repetition rate of 300.00000 MHz with\nan average power of 190 mW. The laser wavelength is resonant with the strong\ntransition in Ytterbium (Yb+) at 369.53 nm and its repetition rate can be\nscaled up using high harmonic mode locking. We show that our source can produce\narbitrary pulse patterns using a programmable pulse pattern generator and fast\nmodulating components. Finally, simulations demonstrate that our laser is\ncapable of performing resonant, temperature-insensitive, two-qubit quantum\nlogic gates on trapped Yb$^+$ ions faster than the trap period and with\nfidelity above 99%.\n", "  We present the implementation and validation of the techniques used to\nefficiently evaluate parametric and perturbative theoretical uncertainties in\nmatrix-element plus parton-shower simulations within the Sherpa event-generator\nframework. By tracing the full $\\alpha_s$ and PDF dependences, including the\nparton-shower component, as well as the fixed-order scale uncertainties, we\ncompute variational event weights on-the-fly, thereby greatly reducing the\ncomputational costs to obtain theoretical-uncertainty estimates.\n", "  The covariant two-point functions, derived from Ward identities in direct\nspace, can be affected by consistency problems and can become unbounded for\nlarge time- or space-separations. This difficulty arises for several extensions\nof dynamical scaling, for example Schr\\\"odinger-invariance, conformal Galilei\ninvariance or meta-conformal invariance, but not for standard ortho-conformal\ninvariance. For meta-conformal invariance in 1+1 dimensions, these difficulties\ncan be cured by going over to a dual space and an extension of these dynamical\nsymmetries through the construction of a new generator in the Cartan\nsub-algebra. This provides a canonical interpretation of meta-conformally\ncovariant two-point functions as correlators. Galilei-conformal correlators can\nbe obtained from meta-conformal invariance through a simple contraction. In\ncontrast, by an analogus construction, Schr\\\"odinger-covariant two-point\nfunctions are causal response functions. All these two-point functions are\nbounded at large separations, for sufficiently positive values of the scaling\nexponents.\n", "  [Background] Meticulous modeling of neutrino-nucleus interactions is\nessential to achieve the unprecedented precision goals of present and future\naccelerator-based neutrino-oscillation experiments. [Purpose] Confront our\ncalculations of charged-current quasielastic cross section with the\nmeasurements of MiniBooNE and T2K, and to quantitatively investigate the role\nof nuclear-structure effects, in particular, low-energy nuclear excitations in\nforward muon scattering. [Method] The model takes the mean-field (MF) approach\nas the starting point, and solves Hartree-Fock (HF) equations using a Skyrme\n(SkE2) nucleon-nucleon interaction. Long-range nuclear correlations are taken\ninto account by means of the continuum random-phase approximation (CRPA)\nframework. [Results] We present our calculations on flux-folded double\ndifferential, and flux-unfolded total cross sections off $^{12}$C and compare\nthem with MiniBooNE and (off-axis) T2K measurements. We discuss the importance\nof low-energy nuclear excitations for the forward bins. [Conclusions] The CRPA\npredictions describe the gross features of the measured cross sections. They\nunderpredict the data (more in the neutrino than in the antineutrino case)\nbecause of the absence of processes beyond pure quasielastic scattering in our\nmodel. At very forward muon scattering, low-energy nuclear excitations ($\\omega\n< $ 50 MeV) account for nearly 50% of the flux-folded cross section.\n", "  Sharp structures in magnetic field-dependent spin Seebeck effect (SSE)\nvoltages of Pt/Y$_{3}$Fe$_{5}$O$_{12}$ (YIG) at low temperatures are attributed\nto the magnon-phonon interaction. Experimental results are well reproduced by a\nBoltzmann theory that includes the magnetoelastic coupling (MEC). The SSE\nanomalies coincide with magnetic fields tuned to the threshold of\nmagnon-polaron formation. The effect gives insight into the relative quality of\nthe lattice and magnetization dynamics.\n", "  We study the Hilbert space structure of classical spacetimes under the\nassumption that entanglement in holographic theories determines semiclassical\ngeometry. We show that this simple assumption has profound implications; for\nexample, a superposition of classical spacetimes may lead to another classical\nspacetime. Despite its unconventional nature, this picture admits the standard\ninterpretation of superpositions of well-defined semiclassical spacetimes in\nthe limit that the number of holographic degrees of freedom becomes large. We\nillustrate these ideas using a model for the holographic theory of cosmological\nspacetimes.\n", "  Mesoscopic simulations of electron transport in disordered materials are\nbased on the many particle Monte-Carlo (MC) methods. One of the major\ndisadvantages of the multi-electron MC modeling is that the simulation process\nbecomes significantly slow as the concentration of electrons increases. This\nproblem makes it almost impossible to gain information about the electron\ntransport at high Fermi levels. Recently a single-particle MC model has been\nproposed which is based on the truncated density of localized states (DLOS) and\nbenefits from very short time execution. Although this model can successfully\nclarify the properties of the electron transport in moderately disordered\nsystems (e.g. nanocrystalline TiO2), utilizing the single-particle MC model for\na strongly disordered medium (e.g. nanocrystalline ZnO) may conducts erroneous\nestimation of the electron transport coefficient. The limitation of this\nsingle-particle MC model originates primarily from using a truncated DLOS.\nAnother obstacle of the model is that it ignores the spatial occupation of\nlocalized states in the transport medium. In this regard, for a strongly\ndisordered medium, the deviation of the single-particle MC model is quite large\nwhen compared with theoretical the predictions. Here, based on the modified\nelectron residence time in the localized states, we propose a different\nsingle-particle MC model which covers the aforementioned models' drawbacks and\nsimultaneously reduces the simulation time. The proposed model is justified by\ntheoretical calculations for a simple cubic lattice at wide range values of\ndisorder parameter, Fermi level, and temperature.\n", "  We investigate non-equilibrium lane formation in a generic model of a fluid\nwith attractive interactions, that is, a two-dimensional Lennard-Jones (LJ)\nfluid composed of two particle species driven in opposite directions.\nPerforming Brownian Dynamics (BD) simulations for a wide range of parameters,\nsupplemented by a stability analysis based on dynamical density functional\ntheory (DDFT), we identify generic features of lane formation in presence of\nattraction, including structural properties. In fact, we find a variety of\nstates (as compared to purely repulsive systems), as well as a close relation\nbetween laning and long wavelength instabilities of the homogeneous phase such\nas demixing and condensation.\n", "  We have investigated the magnetoresistance (MR) and Hall resistivity\nproperties of the single crystals of tantalum sulfide, Ta3S2, which was\nrecently predicted to be a new type II Weyl semimetal. Large MR (up to ~8000%\nat 2 K and 16 T), field-induced metal-insulator-like transition and nonlinear\nHall resistivity are observed at low temperatures. The large MR shows a strong\ndependence on the field orientation, leading to a giant anisotropic\nmagnetoresistance (AMR) effect. For the field applied along the b-axis (B//b),\nMR exhibits quadratic field dependence at low fields and tends towards\nsaturation at high fields; while for B//a, MR presents quadratic field\ndependence at low fields and becomes linear at high fields without any trend\ntowards saturation. The analysis of the Hall resistivity data indicates the\ncoexistence of a large number of electrons with low mobility and a small number\nof holes with high mobility. Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillation analysis\nreveals three fundamental frequencies originated from the three-dimensional\n(3D) Fermi surface (FS) pockets. We find that the semi-classical multiband\nmodel is sufficient to account for the experimentally observed MR in Ta3S2.\n", "  We use Monte Carlo simulations and free-energy techniques to show that binary\nsolutions of penta- and hexavalent two-dimensional patchy particles can form\nthermodynamically stable quasicrystals even at very narrow patch widths,\nprovided their patch interactions are chosen in an appropriate way. Such patchy\nparticles can be thought of as a coarse-grained representation of DNA multi-arm\n`star' motifs, which can be chosen to bond with one another very specifically\nby tuning the DNA sequences of the protruding arms. We explore several possible\ndesign strategies and conclude that DNA star tiles that are designed to\ninteract with one another in a specific but not overly constrained way could\npotentially be used to construct soft quasicrystals in experiment. We verify\nthat such star tiles can form stable dodecagonal motifs using oxDNA, a\nrealistic coarse-grained model of DNA.\n", "  Self-bound many-body systems are formed through a balance of attractive and\nrepulsive forces and occur in many physical scenarios. Liquid droplets are an\nexample of a self-bound system, formed by a balance of the mutual attractive\nand repulsive forces that derive from different components of the\ninter-particle potential. It has been suggested that self-bound ensembles of\nultracold atoms should exist for atom number densities that are 10^8 times\nlower than in a helium droplet, which is formed from a dense quantum liquid.\nHowever, such ensembles have been elusive up to now because they require forces\nother than the usual zero-range contact interaction, which is either attractive\nor repulsive but never both. On the basis of the recent finding that an\nunstable bosonic dipolar gas can be stabilized by a repulsive many-body term,\nit was predicted that three-dimensional self-bound quantum droplets of magnetic\natoms should exist. Here we report the observation of such droplets in a\ntrap-free levitation field. We find that this dilute magnetic quantum liquid\nrequires a minimum, critical number of atoms, below which the liquid evaporates\ninto an expanding gas as a result of the quantum pressure of the individual\nconstituents. Consequently, around this critical atom number we observe an\ninteraction-driven phase transition between a gas and a self-bound liquid in\nthe quantum degenerate regime with ultracold atoms. These droplets are the\ndilute counterpart of strongly correlated self-bound systems such as atomic\nnuclei and helium droplets.\n", "  We present results of a dark matter search performed with a 0.6 kg day\nexposure of the DAMIC experiment at the SNOLAB underground laboratory. We\nmeasure the energy spectrum of ionization events in the bulk silicon of\ncharge-coupled devices down to a signal of 60 eV electron equivalent. The data\nare consistent with radiogenic backgrounds, and constraints on the\nspin-independent WIMP-nucleon elastic-scattering cross section are accordingly\nplaced. A region of parameter space relevant to the potential signal from the\nCDMS-II Si experiment is excluded using the same target for the first time.\nThis result obtained with a limited exposure demonstrates the potential to\nexplore the low-mass WIMP region (<10 GeV/$c^{2}$) of the upcoming DAMIC100, a\n100 g detector currently being installed in SNOLAB.\n", "  We report a measurement of the ionization efficiency of silicon nuclei\nrecoiling with sub-keV kinetic energy in the bulk silicon of a charge-coupled\ndevice (CCD). Nuclear recoils are produced by low-energy neutrons ($<$24 keV)\nfrom a $^{124}$Sb-$^{9}$Be photoneutron source, and their ionization signal is\nmeasured down to 60 eV electron equivalent. This energy range, previously\nunexplored, is relevant for the detection of low-mass dark matter particles.\nThe measured efficiency is found to deviate from the extrapolation to low\nenergies of the Lindhard model. This measurement also demonstrates the\nsensitivity to nuclear recoils of CCDs employed by DAMIC, a dark matter direct\ndetection experiment located in the SNOLAB underground laboratory.\n", "  Interactions between solid-state quantum emitters and cavities are important\nfor a broad range of applications in quantum communication, linear optical\nquantum computing, nonlinear photonics, and photonic quantum simulation. These\napplications often require combining many devices on a single chip with\nidentical emission wavelengths in order to generate two-photon interference,\nthe primary mechanism for achieving effective photon-photon interactions. Such\nintegration remains extremely challenging due to inhomogeneous broadening and\nfabrication errors that randomize the resonant frequencies of both the emitters\nand cavities. In this letter we demonstrate two-photon interference from\nindependent cavity-coupled emitters on the same chip, providing a potential\nsolution to this long-standing problem. We overcome spectral mismatch between\ndifferent cavities due to fabrication errors by depositing and locally\nevaporating a thin layer of condensed nitrogen. We integrate optical heaters to\ntune individual dots within each cavity to the same resonance with better than\n3 {\\mu}eV of precision. Combining these tuning methods, we demonstrate\ntwo-photon interference between two devices spaced by less than 15 {\\mu}m on\nthe same chip with a post-selected visibility of 33%. These results pave the\nway to integrate multiple quantum light sources on the same chip to develop\nquantum photonic devices.\n", "  The dynamics of a (3 + 1) dimensional homogeneous anisotropic universe is\nmodified by Loop Quantum Cosmology and, consequently, it has generically a big\nbounce in the past instead of a big-bang singularity. This modified dynamics\ncan be well described by effective equations of motion. We generalise these\neffective equations of motion empirically to (d + 1) dimensions. The\ngeneralised equations involve two functions and may be considered as a class of\nLQC -- inspired models for (d + 1) dimensional early universe cosmology. As a\nspecial case, one can now obtain a universe which has neither a big bang\nsingularity nor a big bounce but approaches asymptotically a `Hagedorn like'\nphase in the past where its density and volume remain constant. In a few\nspecial cases, we also obtain explicit solutions.\n", "  We investigate the dynamical behaviour of the Ising model under a zero\ntemperature quench with the initial fraction of up spins $0\\leq x\\leq 1$. In\none dimension, the known results for persistence probability are verified; it\nshows algebraic decay for both up and down spins asymptotically with different\nexponents. It is found that the conventional finite size scaling is valid here.\nIn two dimensions however, the persistence probabilities are no longer\nalgebraic; in particular for $x\\leq 0.5$, persistence for the up (minority)\nspins shows the behaviour $P_{min}(t) \\sim t^{-\\gamma}\\exp(-(t/\\tau)^{\\delta})$\nwith time $t$, while for the down (majority) spins, $P_{maj}(t)$ approaches a\nfinite value. We find that the timescale $\\tau$ diverges as $(x_c-x)^{-\n\\lambda}$, where $x_c=0.5$ and $\\lambda\\simeq2.31$. The exponent $\\gamma$\nvaries as $\\theta_{2d}+c_0(x_c-x)^{\\beta}$ where $\\theta_{2d}\\simeq0.215$ is\nvery close to the persistence exponent in two dimensions; $\\beta\\simeq1$. The\nresults in two dimensions can be understood qualitatively by studying the exit\nprobability, which for different system size is found to have the form $E(x) =\nf\\big[(\\frac{x-x_c}{x_c})L^{1/\\nu}\\big]$, with $\\nu \\approx 1.47$. This result\nsuggests that $\\tau \\sim L^{\\tilde{z}}$, where $\\tilde{z} = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\nu}\n= 1.57 \\pm 0.11$ is an exponent not explored earlier.\n", "  We theoretically study the Hall response of a lattice system following a\nquench where the topology of a filled band is suddenly changed. In the limit\nwhere the physics is dominated by a single Dirac cone, we find that the change\nin the Hall conductivity is two-thirds of the quantum of conductivity. We\nexplore this universal behavior in the Haldane model, and discuss cold-atom\nexperiments for its observation. Beyond linear response, the Hall effect\ncrosses over from fractional to integer values. We investigate finite-size\neffects, and the role of the harmonic confinement.\n", "  Anyons are exotic quasiparticles obeying fractional statistics,whose behavior\ncan be emulated in artificially designed spin systems.Here we present an\nexperimental emulation of creating anyonic excitations in a superconducting\ncircuit that consists of four qubits, achieved by dynamically generating the\nground and excited states of the toric code model, i.e., four-qubit\nGreenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states. The anyonic braiding is implemented via\nsingle-qubit rotations: a phase shift of \\pi related to braiding, the hallmark\nof Abelian 1/2 anyons, has been observed through a Ramsey-type interference\nmeasurement.\n", "  In this paper we approach the issue of Clifford algebra basis deformation,\nallowing for bilinear covariants associated to Elko spinors which satisfy the\nFierz-Pauli-Kofink identities. We present a complete analysis of covariance,\ntaking into account the involved dual structure associated to Elko. Moreover,\nthe possible generalizations to the recently presented new dual structure are\nperformed.\n", "  We propose a direct self-assembly mechanism towards obtaining defect-free\nperpendicular lamellar phases of diblock copolymer (BCP) thin films. In our\nnumerical study, a thin BCP film having a flat top surface is casted on a\nuni-directional corrugated solid substrate. The substrate is treated chemically\nand has a weak preference toward one of the two BCP components. Employing\nself-consistent field theory (SCFT), we find that there is an enhanced synergy\nbetween two substrate characteristics: its topography (geometrical roughness)\ncombined with a weak surface preference. This synergy produces the desired\nperpendicular lamellar phase with perfect inplane ordering. Defect-free BCP\nlamellar phases are reproducible for several random initial states, and are\nobtained for a range of substrate roughness and chemical characteristics, even\nfor a uni-directional multi-mode substrate roughness. Our theoretical study\nsuggests possible experiments that will explore the interplay between\nuni-directional substrate corrugation and chemical surface treatment. It may\nlead to viable and economical ways of obtaining BCP films with defect-free\nlateral alignment.\n", "  Quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHIs), also known as two-dimensional\ntopological insulators, have emerged as an unconventional class of quantum\nstates with insulating bulk and conducting edges originating from nontrivial\ninverted band structures, and have been proposed as a platform for exploring\nspintronics applications and exotic quasiparticles related to the spin-helical\nedge modes. Despite theoretical proposals for various materials, however,\nexperimental demonstrations of QSHIs have so far been limited to two\nsystems--HgTe/CdTe and InAs/GaSb--both of which are lattice-matched\nsemiconductor heterostructures. Here we report transport measurements in yet\nanother realization of a band-inverted heterostructure as a QSHI\ncandidate--InAs/In$_{x}$Ga$_{1-x}$Sb with lattice mismatch. We show that the\ncompressive strain in the In$_{x}$Ga$_{1-x}$Sb layer enhances the band overlap\nand energy gap. Consequently, high bulk resistivity, two orders of magnitude\nhigher than for InAs/GaSb, is obtained deep in the band-inverted regime. The\nstrain also enhances bulk Rashba spin-orbit splitting, leading to an unusual\nsituation where the Fermi level crosses only one spin branch for electronlike\nand holelike bands over a wide density range. These properties make this system\na promising platform for robust QSHIs with unique spin properties and\ndemonstrate strain to be an important ingredient for tuning spin-orbit\ninteraction.\n", "  In warm inflation scenarios, radiation always exists, so that the radiation\nenergy density is also assumed to be finite when inflation starts. To find out\nthe origin of the non-vanishing initial radiation energy density, we revisit\nthermodynamic analysis for a warm inflation model and then derive an effective\nStefan-Boltzmann law which is commensurate with the temperature-dependent\neffective potential by taking into account the non-vanishing trace of the total\nenergy-momentum tensors. The effective Stefan-Boltzmann law shows that the zero\nenergy density for radiation at the Grand Unification epoch increases until the\ninflation starts and it becomes eventually finite at the initial stage of warm\ninflation. By using the above effective Stefan-Boltzmann law, we also study the\ncosmological scalar perturbation, and obtain the sufficient radiation energy\ndensity in order for GUT baryogenesis at the end of inflation.\n", "  We numerically determine the cosmological branch of the free function in a\nnonlocal metric-based modification of gravity which provides a relativistic\ngeneralization of Milgrom's Modified Newtonian Dynamics. We are able to\nreproduce the $\\Lambda$CDM expansion history over virtually all of cosmic\nhistory, including the era of radiation domination during Big Bang\nNucleosynthesis, the era of matter domination during Recombination, and most of\nthe era of vacuum energy domination. The very late period of $0 \\leq z <\n0.0880$, during which the model deviates from the $\\Lambda$CDM expansion\nhistory, is interesting because it causes the current value of the Hubble\nparameter to be about 4.5\\% larger than it would be for the $\\Lambda$CDM model.\nThis may resolve the tension between inferences of $H_0$ which are based on\ndata from large redshift and inferences based on Hubble plots.\n", "  By paying special attention to the fact that the doped holes induce\ndeformation of CuO6 octahedrons (or CuO5 pyramids) in cuprate superconductors,\nwe develop a non-rigid band theory treating doping-induced alterations of\nenergy-band structures in copper oxide superconductors. Thanks to this theory,\nwe obtain a complete picture of the doping-induced alteration in the electronic\nstructure of La2CuO4, from the spin-disordered insulating phase to the metallic\nphase. We conclude that the Fermi surface structure of this cuprate in the\nunderdoped region consists of Fermi pockets in the antinodal region and Fermi\narcs in the nodal region, and thus that the origin of a so-called pseudogap is\nclosely related to the existence of Fermi pockets. Moreover, we show that the\ncarriers on the Fermi pockets contribute to the phonon mechanism in d-wave\nsuperconductivity. Finally, we discuss how one will be able to find higher Tc\nmaterials, based on the conclusions mentioned above.\n", "  Laser-based searches of the yet unobserved vacuum birefringence might be\nsensitive for very light hypothetical particles carrying a tiny fraction of the\nelectron charge. We show that, with the help of contemporary techniques,\npolarimetric investigations driven by an optical laser pulse of moderate\nintensity might allow for excluding regions of the parameter space of these\nparticle candidates which have not been discarded so far by laboratory\nmeasurement data. Particular attention is paid to the role of a Gaussian wave\nprofile. It is argued that, at energy regimes in which the vacuum becomes\ndichroic due to these minicharges, the transmission probability of a probe beam\nthrough an analyzer set crossed to the initial polarization direction will\ndepend on both the induced ellipticity as well as the rotation of the initial\npolarization plane. The weak and strong field regimes, relative to the\nattributes of these minicharged particles, and the relevance of the\npolarization of the strong field are investigated.\n", "  Konoplya and Zhidenko have proposed recently a rotating non-Kerr black hole\nmetric beyond General Relativity and make an estimate for the possible\ndeviations from the Kerr solution with the data of GW 150914. We here study the\nstrong gravitational lensing in such a rotating non-Kerr spacetime with an\nextra deformation parameter. We find that the condition of existence of\nhorizons is not inconsistent with that of the marginally circular photon orbit.\nMoreover, the deflection angle of the light ray near the weakly naked\nsingularity covered by the marginally circular orbit diverges logarithmically\nin the strong-field limit. In the case of the completely naked singularity, the\ndeflection angle near the singularity tends to a certain finite value, whose\nsign depends on the rotation parameter and the deformation parameter. These\nproperties of strong gravitational lensing are different from those in the\nJohannsen-Psaltis rotating non-Kerr spacetime and in the Janis-Newman-Winicour\nspacetime. Modeling the supermassive central object of the Milk Way Galaxy as a\nKonoplya-Zhidenko rotating non-Kerr compact object, we estimated the numerical\nvalues of observables for the strong gravitational lensing including the time\ndelay between two relativistic images.\n", "  Transitional disks show a lack of excess emission at infrared wavelengths due\nto a large dust cavity, that is often corroborated by spatially resolved\nobservations at ~ mm wavelengths. We present the first spatially resolved ~\nmm-wavelength images of the disk around the Herbig Ae/Be star, HD 97048.\nScattered light images show that the disk extends to ~640 au. The ALMA data\nreveal a circular-symmetric dusty disk extending to ~350 au, and a molecular\ndisk traced in CO J=3-2 emission, extending to ~750 au. The CO emission arises\nfrom a flared layer with an opening angle ~ 30 deg - 40 deg. HD 97048 is\nanother source for which the large (~ mm-sized) dust grains are more centrally\nconcentrated than the small (~ {\\mu}m-sized) grains and molecular gas, likely\ndue to radial drift. The images and visibility data modelling suggests a\ndecrement in continuum emission within ~50 au, consistent with the cavity size\ndetermined from mid-infrared imaging (34 +/- 4 au). The extracted continuum\nintensity profiles show ring-like structures with peaks at ~50, 150, and 300\nau, with associated gaps at ~100 and 250 au. This structure should be confirmed\nin higher-resolution images (FWHM ~ 10 - 20 au). These data confirm the\nclassification of HD 97048 as a transitional disk that also possesses multiple\nring-like structures in the dust continuum emission. Additional data are\nrequired at multiple and well-separated frequencies to fully characterise the\ndisk structure, and thereby constrain the mechanism(s) responsible for\nsculpting the HD 97048 disk.\n", "  In the $\\Lambda$CDM model of structure formation, a stellar spheroid grows by\nthe assembly of smaller galaxies, the so-called building blocks. Combining the\nMunich-Groningen semi-analytical model of galaxy formation with the high\nresolution Aquarius simulations of dark matter haloes, we study the assembly\nhistory of the stellar spheroids of six Milky Way-mass galaxies, focussing on\nbuilding block properties such as mass, age and metallicity. These properties\nare compared to those of the surviving satellites in the same models. We find\nthat the building blocks have higher star formation rates on average, and this\nis especially the case for the more massive objects. At high redshift these\ndominate in star formation over the satellites, whose star formation timescales\nare longer on average. These differences ought to result in a larger\n$\\alpha$-element enhancement from Type II supernovae in the building blocks\n(compared to the satellites) by the time Type Ia supernovae would start to\nenrich them in iron, explaining the observational trends. Interestingly, there\nare some variations in the star formation timescales of the building blocks\namongst the simulated haloes, indicating that [$\\alpha$/Fe] abundances in\nspheroids of other galaxies might differ from those in our own Milky Way.\n", "  Virtually all commercial instruments for the measurement of the oscillator PM\nnoise make use of the Cross Spectrum method (arXiv:1004.5539 [physics.ins-det],\n2010). High sensitivity is achieved by correlation and averaging on two equal\nchannels which measure the same input, and reject the background of the\ninstrument. We show that a systematic error is always present if the thermal\nenergy of the input power splitter is not accounted for. Such error can result\nin noise under estimation up to a few dB in the lowest-noise quartz\noscillators, and in a complete nonsense in the case of cryogenic oscillators.\nAs another alarming fact, the presence of metamaterial components in the\noscillator results in unpredictable behavior and large errors, even in well\ncontrolled experimental conditions. We observed a spread of 40 dB in the phase\nnoise spectra of an oscillator, just replacing the output filter.\n", "  Heavy Majorana neutrinos are predicted in addition to ordinary active\nneutrinos in the models with the seesaw mechanism. We investigate the lepton\nnumber violation (LNV) in $B$ decays induced by such a heavy neutrino $N$ with\nGeV-scale mass. Especially, we consider the decay channel $B^+ \\to \\mu^+ \\, N\n\\to \\mu^+ \\mu^+ \\pi^-$ and derive the sensitivity limits on the mixing angle\n$\\Theta_\\mu$ by the future search experiments at Belle II and in $e^+ e^-$\ncollisions at the Future Circular Collider (FCC-ee).\n", "  We study soliton and black hole solutions of Einstein charged scalar field\ntheory in cavity. We examine the effect of introducing a scalar field mass on\nstatic, spherically symmetric solutions of the field equations. We focus\nparticularly on the spaces of soliton and black hole solutions, as well as\nstudying their stability under linear, spherically symmetric perturbations of\nthe metric, electromagnetic field, and scalar field.\n", "  We consider a solution of the effective four-dimensional Einstein equations,\nobtained from the general relativistic Schwarzschild metric through the\nprinciple of Minimal Geometric Deformation (MGD). Since the brane tension can,\nin general, introduce new singularities on a relativistic E\\\"otv\\\"os brane\nmodel in the MGD framework, we require the absence of observed singularities,\nin order to constrain the brane tension. We then study the corresponding\nBose-Einstein condensate (BEC) gravitational system and determine the critical\nstability region of BEC MGD stellar configurations. Finally, the critical\nstellar densities are shown to be related with critical points of the\ninformation entropy.\n", "  Strontium molybdate (SrMoO3) thin films are shown to exhibit plasmonic\nbehaviour with a zero crossover wavelength of the real part of the dielectric\npermittivity tunable between 600 and 950 nm (2.05 eV and 1.31 eV). The films\nare grown epitaxially on strontium titanate (SrTiO3), magnesium oxide (MgO),\nand lanthanum aluminate (LaAlO3) substrates by pulsed laser deposition. SrMoO3\nis shown to have optical losses lower than those of gold at the point at which\nthe real part of the dielectric permittivity is equal to -2, while possessing\nlow electrical resistivity of 100E-6 Ohm cm at room temperature. Spectroscopic\nellipsometry measurements reveal that SrMoO3 shows plasmonic behaviour,\nmoreover we demonstrate that the epsilon near zero (ENZ) wavelength is tunable\nby engineering the residual strain in the films. The relatively broadband ENZ\nbehaviour observed in SrMoO3 demonstrates its potential suitability for\ntransformation optics along with plasmonic applications in the visible to near\ninfrared spectral range.\n", "  In this paper we study quantum state transfer (also called quantum tunneling)\non graphs when there is a potential function on the vertex set. We present two\nmain results. First, we show that for paths of length greater than three, there\nis no potential on the vertices of the path for which perfect state transfer\nbetween the endpoints can occur. In particular, this answers a question raised\nby Godsil in Section 20 of [8]. Second, we show that if a graph has two\nvertices that share a common neighborhood, then there is a potential on the\nvertex set for which perfect state transfer will occur between those two\nvertices. This gives numerous examples where perfect state transfer does not\noccur without the potential, but adding a potential makes perfect state\ntransfer possible. In addition, we investigate perfect state transfer on graph\nproducts, which gives further examples where perfect state transfer can occur.\n", "  Speckle interferometry is an established optical metrology tool for the\ncharacterization of rough objects. The raw phase, however, is impaired by the\npresence of phase singularities, making the unwrapping procedure ambiguous. In\na Michelson setup, we tailor the spatial coherence of the light source,\nachieving a physical averaging of independent, mutually incoherent speckle\nfields. In the resulting raw phase, the systematic phase is preserved while the\nnumber of phase singularities is greatly reduced. Both interferometer arms are\naffected by the averaging. The reduction is sufficient to even allow the use of\na standard unwrapping algorithm originally developed for smooth surfaces only.\n", "  This paper describes a system designed as part of an interactive VR opera,\nwhich immerses a real-time composer and an audience (via a network) in the\nhistorical location of Gobeklitepe, in southern Turkey during an imaginary\nscenario set in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic period (8500-5500 BCE), viewed by\nsome to be the earliest example of a temple, or observatory. In this scene\nmusic is generated, where the harmonic material is determined based on\nobservations of light variation from pulsating stars, that would have\ntheoretically been overhead on the 1st of October 8000 BC at 23:00 and animal\ncalls based on the reliefs in the temple. Based on the observations of the\nstars V465 Per, HD 217860, 16 Lac, BG CVn and KIC 6382916, frequency\ncollections were derived and applied to the generation of musical sound and\nnotation sequences within a custom VR environment using a novel method\nincorporating spectralist techniques. Parameters controlling this 'resynthesis'\ncan be manipulated by the performer using a Leap Motion controller and Oculus\nRift HMD, yielding both sonic and visual results in the environment. The final\nopera is to be viewed via Google Cardboard and delivered over the Internet.\nThis entire process aims to pose questions about real-time composition through\ntime distortion and invoke a sense of wonder and meaningfulness through a\nritualistic experience.\n", "  Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P) was imaged with the 2m telescope at Mt.\nWendelstein Observatory in the Alps. Coma and tail monitoring was performed\nduring 51 nights between 22 August 2015 and 9 May 2016. The images through r\nand i Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) filters show the dust distribution around\nthe comet, while images in the SDSS g filter indicate also the presence of coma\ngas in early September 2015. The dust color of 67P implies intrinsic reddening\nof 9 %/100nm. After maximum shortly after perihelion passage the dust activity\ndecreased with a heliocentric exponent of 4.1 to 4.2 from late September 2015\nuntil May 2016. The opposition surge during early 2016 can be explained by a\nlinear light scattering phase function (beta ~ 0.04) or an asteroid-like\nHG-type phase function (G ~ 0.15). The radial brightness profile indicates a\n'quasi-steady-state' dust coma from late September to the end of 2015. Dust\nfragmentation during about a month after perihelion may be responsible for\nradial coma profiles with slopes below unity, while dust accumulation due to\nvery slow dust expansion velocity may result in steeper than unity profiles\nduring 2016. Three fan-shape dust structures are characterized in the coma of\n67P. A short dust ejection event on 22 -23 August 2015 has produced a dust\narc-let and jet feature in the coma. In September 2015 the appearance of\ncometary dust tail is dominated by young dust produced around perihelion. The\nolder dust dominates the tail appearance as of mid November 2015.\n", "  Cosmological parameter estimation techniques that robustly account for\nsystematic measurement uncertainties will be crucial for the next generation of\ncosmological surveys. We present a new analysis method, superABC, for obtaining\ncosmological constraints from Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) light curves using\nApproximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) without any likelihood assumptions. The\nABC method works by using a forward model simulation of the data where\nsystematic uncertainties can be simulated and marginalized over. A key feature\nof the method presented here is the use of two distinct metrics, the `Tripp'\nand `Light Curve' metrics, which allow us to compare the simulated data to the\nobserved data set. The Tripp metric takes as input the parameters of models fit\nto each light curve with the SALT-II method, whereas the Light Curve metric\nuses the measured fluxes directly without model fitting. We apply the superABC\nsampler to a simulated data set of $\\sim$1000 SNe corresponding to the first\nseason of the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program. Varying $\\Omega_m, w_0,\n\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ and a magnitude offset parameter, with no systematics we\nobtain $\\Delta(w_0) = w_0^{\\rm true} - w_0^{\\rm best \\, fit} = -0.036\\pm0.109$\n(a $\\sim11$% 1$\\sigma$ uncertainty) using the Tripp metric and $\\Delta(w_0) =\n-0.055\\pm0.068$ (a $\\sim7$% 1$\\sigma$ uncertainty) using the Light Curve\nmetric. Including 1% calibration uncertainties in four passbands, adding 4 more\nparameters, we obtain $\\Delta(w_0) = -0.062\\pm0.132$ (a $\\sim14$% 1$\\sigma$\nuncertainty) using the Tripp metric. Overall we find a $17$% increase in the\nuncertainty on $w_0$ with systematics compared to without. We contrast this\nwith a MCMC approach where systematic effects are approximately included. We\nfind that the MCMC method slightly underestimates the impact of calibration\nuncertainties for this simulated data set.\n", "  A modified Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction in media is put\nforward.\n", "  The R\\'enyi entropy for the $\\widehat{\\rm SU}(N)_1$ WZW model as described by\n$N$ free fermions coupled to a $U(1)$ constraint field is computed on an\n$n$-sheeted branched torus. The boundary condition of the harmonic component of\nthe gauge field on the homology cycles of the genus $g$ Riemann surface is\ncentral to the final result. This calculation is complementary to that of\narXiv:$1510.05993$, which presents the bose side of the bose-fermi equivalence.\n", "  This Introduction opens the book {\\sl Standing Together in Troubled Times}\nwhich presents a story of friendship between Wolfgang Pauli, one of the\ngreatest theoretical physicists of the 20th century, and Charlotte Houtermans.\nThey met at the very onset of the quantum era, in the late 1920s in Germany\nwhere Charlotte was a physics student at G\\\"ottingen University. At that time\nG\\\"ottingen was right at the heart of groundbreaking developments in physics.\nBoth Pauli and Houtermans personally knew major participants in the quantum\nrevolution. Caught between two evils -- German National Socialism and Soviet\nCommunism -- Charlotte Houtermans would have likely perished if it were not for\nthe brotherhood of physicists: Niels Bohr, Wolfgang Pauli, Albert Einstein,\nJames Franck, Max Born, Robert Oppenheimer and many other noted scientists who\ntried to save friends and colleagues (either leftist sympathizers or Jews) who\nwere in mortal danger of becoming entrapped in a simmering pre-WWII Europe.\nThis book is based on newly discovered documents from the Houtermans family\narchive, including Pauli's numerous letters to Houtermans, her correspondence\nwith other great physicists, her diaries, and interviews with her children.\nAlmost all documents presented in this book are being published for the first\ntime.\n", "  Realization of Quantum information and communications technologies requires\nrobust, stable solid state single photon sources. However, most existing\nsources cease to function above cryogenic or room temperature due to thermal\nionization or strong phonon coupling which impede their emissive and quantum\nproperties. Here we present an efficient single photon source based on a defect\nin a van der Waals crystal that is optically stable and operates at elevated\ntemperatures of up to 800 K. The quantum nature of the source and the photon\npurity are maintained upon heating to 800 K and cooling back to room\ntemperature. Our report of a robust high temperature solid state single photon\nsource constitutes a significant step to-wards practical, integrated quantum\ntechnologies for real-world environments.\n", "  We find an exact solution to strongly-coupled matrix models with a\nsingle-trace monomial potential. Our solution yields closed form expressions\nfor the partition function as well as averages of Schur functions. The results\nare fully factorized into a product of terms linear in the rank of the matrix\nand the parameters of the model. We extend our formulas to include both\nlogarthmic and finite-difference deformations, thereby generalizing the\ncelebrated Selberg and Kadell integrals. We conjecture a formula for\ncorrelators of two Schur functions in these models, and explain how our results\nfollow from a general orbifold-like procedure that can be applied to any\none-matrix model with a single-trace potential.\n", "  We use a neural network approach to explore the inverse problem of Bloch\noscillations in a monoatomic linear chain: given a signal describing the path\nof oscillations of electrons as a function of time, we determine the strength\nof the applied field along the direction of motion or, equivalently, the\nlattice spacing. We find that the proposed approach has more than 80% of\naccuracy classifying the studied physical parameters.\n", "  Two-dimensional (2D) materials have been extensively studied in recent years\ndue to their unique properties and great potential for applications. Different\ntypes of structural defects could present in 2D materials and have strong\ninfluence on their properties. Optical spectroscopic techniques, e.g. Raman and\nphotoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, have been widely used for defect\ncharacterization in 2D materials. In this review, we briefly introduce\ndifferent types of defects and discuss their effects on the mechanical,\nelectrical, optical, thermal, and magnetic properties of 2D materials. Then, we\nreview the recent progress on Raman and PL spectroscopic investigation of\ndefects in 2D materials, i.e. identifying of the nature of defects and also\nquantifying the numbers of defects. Finally, we highlight perspectives on\ndefect characterization and engineering in 2D materials.\n", "  When a laser pulse excites a ferromagnet, its spin undergoes a dramatic\nchange. The initial demagnetization process is very fast. Experimentally, it is\nfound that the demagnetization time is related to the spin moment in the\nsample. In this study, we employ the first-principles method to directly\nsimulate such a process. We use the fixed spin moment method to change the spin\nmoment in ferromagnetic nickel, and then we employ the Liouville equation to\ncouple the laser pulse to the system. We find that in general the dependence of\ndemagnetization time on the spin moment is nonlinear: It decreases with the\nspin moment up to a point, after which an increase with the spin moment is\nobserved, followed by a second decrease. To understand this, we employ an\nextended Heisenberg model, which includes both the exchange interaction and\nspin-orbit coupling. The model directly links the demagnetization rate to the\nspin moment itself and demonstrates analytically that the spin relaxes more\nslowly with a small spin moment. A future experimental test of our predictions\nis needed.\n", "  We report the discovery of a fourth eastern arc (Arc E) towards the cool-core\ncluster Abell 2626 using 610 MHz Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope observations.\nThree arcs towards north, west and south were known from earlier works at 1400\nMHz and proposed to have originated in precessing radio jets of the central\nactive galactic nucleus. The 610 - 1400 MHz integrated spectral indices of the\narcs are in the range 3.2 - 3.6 and the spectral index map shows uniform\ndistribution along the lengths of the arcs. If associated with A2626, the arcs\nhave linear extents in the range 79 - 152 kpc. The detection of Arc E favours\nthe scenario in which a pair of bipolar precessing jets were active and halted\nto produce the arc system. Based on the morphological symmetry and spectral\nsimilarity, we indicate a possible role of gravitational lensing. Further high\nresolution low frequency observations and measurements of the mass of the\nsystem are needed to disentangle the mystery of this source.\n", "  The boundary at $\\Cal I^+$, future null infinity, for a standard static,\nspherically symmetric spactime is examined for possible linear connections. Two\nindependent methods are employed, one for treating $\\Cal I^+$ as the future\ncausal boundary, and one for treating it as a conformal boundary (the latter is\nsubsumed in the former, which is of greater generality). Both methods provide\nthe same result: a constellation of various possible connections, depending on\nan arbitrary choice of a certain function, a sort of gauge freedom in obtaining\na natural connection on $\\Cal I^+$; choosing that function to be constant (for\ninstance) results in a complete connection.\n  Treating $\\Cal I^+$ as part of the future causal boundary, the method is to\nimpute affine connections on null hypersurfaces going out to $\\Cal I^+$, in\nterms of a transverse vector field on each null hypersurface (there is much\ngauge freedom on choice of the transverse vector fields). Treating $\\Cal I^+$\nas part of a conformal boundary, the method is to make a choice of conformal\nfactor that makes the boundary totally geodesic in the enveloping manifold\n(there is much gauge freedom in choice of that conformal factor).\n  Similar examination is made of other boundaries, such as timelike infinity\nand timelike and spacelike singularities. These are much simpler, as they admit\na unique connection from a similar limiting process (i.e., no gauge freedom);\nand that connection is complete.\n", "  The CMS offline software and computing system has successfully met the\nchallenge of LHC Run 2. In this presentation, we will discuss how the entire\nsystem was improved in anticipation of increased trigger output rate, increased\nrate of pileup interactions and the evolution of computing technology. The\nprimary goals behind these changes was to increase the flexibility of computing\nfacilities where ever possible, as to increase our operational efficiency, and\nto decrease the computing resources needed to accomplish the primary offline\ncomputing workflows. These changes have resulted in a new approach to\ndistributed computing in CMS for Run 2 and for the future as the LHC luminosity\nshould continue to increase. We will discuss changes and plans to our data\nfederation, which was one of the key changes towards a more flexible computing\nmodel for Run 2. Our software framework and algorithms also underwent\nsignificant changes. We will summarize the our experience with a new\nmulti-threaded framework as deployed on our prompt reconstruction farm for 2015\nand across the CMS WLCG Tier-1 facilities. We will discuss our experience with\na analysis data format which is ten times smaller than our primary Run 1\nformat. This \"miniAOD\" format has proven to be easier to analyze while be\nextremely flexible for analysts. Finally, we describe improvements to our\nworkflow management system that have resulted in increased automation and\nreliability for all facets of CMS production and user analysis operations.\n", "  Progress in the manufacturing of ceramics, but also of sintered metals,\nstrongly relies on the evaluation of the density distribution in green bodies.\nThis evaluation is crucial from many points of view, including the calibration\nof constitutive models for \\textit{in-silico} simulation of densification\nprocesses. To this end, X-ray tomography and other techniques are possible but\ncan be unmanageable for some institutions. Therefore, a destructive method is\nintroduced in the present article to measure the density field of a green body\nsample using a CNC mill, an analytical balance, and analysis techniques from\nthe field of computational tomography. A virtual experiment is presented where\nthe method is used to reconstruct a simulated green body density field and is\nfound to satisfactorily correspond to the original solution. The green body\ndensity field of a truncated cylinder made of alumina powder is evaluated using\nthis method and the reconstructed field is presented.\n", "  Separation of enantiomers by flows is a promising chiral resolution method\nusing cost-effective microfluidics. Notwithstanding a number of experimental\nand numerical studies, a fundamental understanding still remains elusive, and\nan important question as to whether it is possible to specify common physical\nproperties of flows that induce separation has not been addressed. Here, we\nstudy the separation of rigid chiral objects of an arbitrary shape induced by a\nlinear flow field at low Reynolds numbers. Based on a symmetry property under\nparity inversion, we show that the rate-of-strain field is essential to drift\nthe objects in opposite directions according to chirality. From eigenmode\nanalysis, we also derive an analytic expression for the separation conditions\nwhich shows that the flow field should be quasi-two-dimensional for the precise\nand efficient resolutions of microscopic enantiomers. We demonstrate this\nprediction by Langevin dynamics simulations with hydrodynamic interactions\nfully implemented. Finally, we discuss the practical feasibility of the linear\nflow analysis, considering separations by a vortex flow or an extensional flow\nunder a confining potential.\n", "  We have simulated the asymptotically free two-dimensional O(3) model at\nnonzero chemical potential using the model's dual representation. We first\ndemonstrate how the latter solves the sign (complex action) problem. The system\ndisplays a crossover at nonzero temperature, while at zero temperature it\nundergoes a quantum phase transition when mu reaches the particle mass\n(generated dynamically similar to QCD). The density follows a square root\nbehavior universal for repulsive bosons in one spatial dimension. We have also\nmeasured the spin stiffness, known to be sensitive to the spatial correlation\nlength, using different scaling trajectories to zero temperature and infinite\nsize. It points to a dynamical critical exponent z=2. Comparisons to\nthermodynamic Bethe ansaetze are shown as well.\n", "  In this talk, we review our recent work on direct evaluation of tree-level\nMHV amplitudes by Cachazo-He-Yuan (CHY) formula. We also investigate the\ncorrespondence between solutions to scattering equations and amplitudes in four\ndimensions along this line. By substituting the MHV solution of scattering\nequations into the integrated CHY formula, we explicitly calculate the\ntree-level MHV amplitudes for four dimensional Yang-Mills theory and gravity.\nThese results naturally reproduce the Parke-Taylor and Hodges formulas. In\naddition, we derive a new compact formula for tree-level single-trace MHV\namplitudes in Einstein-Yang-Mills theory, which is equivalent to the known\nSelivanov-Bern-De Freitas-Wong (SBDW) formula. Other solutions do not\ncontribute to the MHV amplitudes in Yang-Mills theory, gravity and\nEinstein-Yang-Mills theory. We further investigate the correspondence between\nsolutions of scattering equation and helicity configurations beyond MHV and\nproposed a method for characterizing solutions of scattering equations.\n", "  We consider the Hamiltonian system of scalar wave field and a single\nnonrelativistic particle coupled in a translation invariant manner. The\nparticle is also subject to a confining external potential. The stationary\nsolutions of the system are a Coulomb type wave field centered at those\nparticle positions for which the external force vanishes. We prove that\nsolutions of finite energy converge, in suitable local energy seminorms, to the\nset ${\\cal S}$ of all stationary states in the long time limit $t\\to\\pm\\infty$.\nFurther we show that the rate of relaxation to a stable stationary state is\ndetermined by spatial decay of initial data. The convergence is followed by the\nradiation of the dispersion wave which is a solution to the free wave equation.\n  Similar relaxation has been proved previously for the case of relativistic\nparticle when the speed of the particle is less than the speed of light. Now we\nextend these results to nonrelativistic particle with arbitrary superlight\nvelocity. However, we restrict ourselves by the plane particle trajectories.\nThe extension to general case remains an open problem.\n", "  In recent years a number of new theoretical models have been implemented into\nMonte-Carlo neutrino interaction event generators. Being able to compare\nmultiple model predictions is invaluable to the field, especially as it is\nunfortunately still unclear which one provides the best fit to the entire\ncollection of neutrino cross-section data. Using a recently developed neutrino\ngenerator tuning framework (NUISANCE), we review a selection of models in the\nNEUT and NuWro generators through comparisons to existing bubble chamber,\nMINERvA, and MiniBooNE cross-section data.\n", "  A high-resolution spectropolarimetric survey of all (573) stars brighter than\nmagnitude V=4 has been undertaken with Narval at TBL, ESPaDOnS at CFHT, and\nHarpsPol at ESO, as a ground-based support to the BRITE constellation of\nnano-satellites in the framework of the Ground-Based Observation Team (GBOT).\nThe goal is to detect magnetic fields in BRITE targets, as well as to provide\none very high-quality, high-resolution spectrum for each star. The survey is\nnearly completed and already led to the discovery of 42 new magnetic stars and\nthe confirmation of several other magnetic detections, including field\ndiscoveries in, e.g., an Am star, two {\\delta} Scuti stars, hot evolved stars,\nand stars in clusters. Follow-up spectropolarimetric observations of\napproximately a dozen of these magnetic stars have already been performed to\ncharacterise their magnetic field configuration and strength in detail.\n", "  It is well acknowledged that the sequence of glacial-interglacial cycles is\npaced by the astronomical forcing. However, how much is the sequence robust\nagainst natural fluctuations associated, for example, with the chaotic motions\nof atmosphere and oceans? In this article, the stability of the\nglacial-interglacial cycles is investigated on the basis of simple conceptual\nmodels. Specifically, we study the influence of additive white Gaussian noise\non the sequence of the glacial cycles generated by stochastic versions of\nseveral low-order dynamical system models proposed in the literature. In the\noriginal deterministic case, the models exhibit different types of attractors:\na quasiperiodic attractor, a piecewise continuous attractor, strange nonchaotic\nattractors, and a chaotic attractor. We show that the combination of the\nquasiperiodic astronomical forcing and additive fluctuations induce a form of\ntemporarily quantised instability. More precisely, climate trajectories\ncorresponding to different noise realizations generally cluster around a small\nnumber of stable or transiently stable trajectories present in the\ndeterministic system. Furthermore, these stochastic trajectories may show\nsensitive dependence on very small amounts of perturbations at key times.\nConsistently with the complexity of each attractor, the number of trajectories\nleaking from the clusters may range from almost zero (the model with a\nquasiperiodic attractor) to a significant fraction of the total (the model with\na chaotic attractor), the models with strange nonchaotic attractors being\nintermediate. Finally, we discuss the implications of this investigation for\nresearch programmes based on numerical simulators. }\n", "  We consider a conformal complex singlet extension of the Standard Model with\na Higgs portal interaction. Two different scenarios depending on whether the\nglobal U(1) symmetry is broken or not have been studied. In the unbroken phase,\nthe decay of the complex singlet is protected by the global U(1) symmetry which\nleads to an ideal cold dark matter candidate. In the broken phase, we are able\nto provide a second Higgs at $554\\,\\rm{GeV}$. In addition, gauging the global\nU(1) symmetry, we can construct an asymptotically safe U(1)' leptophobic model.\nWe combine the notion of asymptotic safety with conformal symmetry and use the\nrenormalization group equations as a bridge to connect UV boundary conditions\nand Electroweak/ TeV scale physics. We also provide a detailed example to show\nthat these boundary conditions will lead to phenomenological signatures such as\ndiboson excesses which could be tested at the LHC.\n", "  Three static and axially symmetric (Weyl-type) ring singularities -- the\nMajumdar-Papapetrou--type (extremally charged) ring, the Bach-Weyl ring and the\nAppell ring -- are studied in general relativity in order to show how\nremarkably the geometries in their vicinity differ from each other. This is\ndemonstrated on basic measures of the rings and on invariant characteristics\ngiven by the metric and by its first and second derivatives (lapse,\ngravitational acceleration and curvature), and also on geodesic motion. The\nresults are also compared against the Kerr space-time which possesses a ring\nsingularity too. The Kerr solution is only stationary, not static, but in spite\nof the consequent complication by dragging, its ring appears to be simpler than\nthe static rings. We show that this mainly applies to the Bach-Weyl ring,\nalthough this straightforward counter-part of the Newtonian homogeneous\ncircular ring is by default being taken as the simplest ring solution, and\nalthough the other two static ring sources may seem more \"artificial\". The\nweird, directional deformation around the Bach-Weyl ring probably indicates\nthat a more adequate coordinate representation and interpretation of this\nsource should exists.\n", "  A search for new spin-0 resonances decaying into two photons in the ATLAS\nexperiment at the LHC is described. The analysis is based on $pp$ collision\ndata at $\\sqrt{s}$=13 TeV corresponding to integrated luminosities of 3.2/fb\nand 12.2/fb recorded in 2015 and 2016, respectively. A deviation from the\nStandard Model background-only hypothesis corresponding to 3.4 standard\ndeviations is observed in the 2015 data for a resonance mass hypothesis of 730\nGeV. No significant excess at such mass over the background expectation is\nobserved in the 2016 data. Limits on the production cross section times\nbranching ratio to two photons of such resonances are reported.\n", "  Unusual phases and phase transitions are seen at the magnetic-nonmagnetic\nboundary in Ce, Eu and Yb-based compounds. EuNi$_2$P$_{2}$ is a very unusual\nvalence fluctuating Eu system, because at low temperatures the Eu valence stays\nclose to 2.5 instead of approaching an integer value. Eu valence and thus the\nmagnetic property in this system can be tuned by Ge substitution in P site as\nEuNi$_2$Ge$_{2}$ is known to exhibit antiferromagnetc (AFM) ordering of\ndivalent Eu moments with $T_N$ = 30 K. We have grown\nEuNi$_2$(P$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$)$_2$ (0.0 $\\leq$ $x$ $\\leq$ 0.5) single crystals and\nstudied their magnetic, thermodynamic and transport properties. Increasing Ge\ndoping to $x >$ 0.4 results in a well-defined AFM ordered state with $T_N$ = 12\nK for $x$ = 0.5. Moreover, the reduced value of magnetic entropy for $x$ = 0.5\nat $T_N$ suggests the presence of valance fluctuation/ Kondo effect in this\ncompound. Interestingly, the specific heat exhibits an enhanced Sommerfeld\ncoefficient upon Ge doping. Subsequently, electronic structure calculations\nlead to a non-integral valence in EuNi$_2$P$_{2}$ but a stable divalent Eu\nstate in EuNi$_2$Ge$_{2}$ which is in good agreement with experimental results.\n", "  We use distribution theory (generalized functions) to extend and justify the\nFock-Kemmer approach to the propagation of precursor shock wave discontinuities\nin classical and quantum field theory. We apply lightcone causality arguments\nto propose that shock wave singularities in non-linear classical field theories\nand in Maxwell's equations for responsive media require a form of classical\nrenormalization analogous to Wilson operator product expansions in quantum\nfield theories.\n", "  We have used AAVSO visual and photoelectric V data, and the AAVSO time-series\npackage VSTAR and the Lomb-Scargle time-series algorithm to determine improved\npulsation periods, \"long secondary periods\" (LSPs). and their amplitudes in 51\nshorter-period pulsating red giants in the AAVSO photoelectric photometry\nprogram, and the AAVSO LPV (long period variable) binocular program. As is well\nknown, radial pulsation becomes detectable in red giants at about spectral type\nM0, with periods of about 20 days. We find that the LSP phenomenon is also\nfirst detectable at about M0. Pulsation and LSP amplitudes increase from near\nzero to about 0.1 at pulsation periods of about 100 days. At longer periods,\nthe pulsation amplitudes continue to increase, but the LSP amplitudes are\ngenerally between 0.1 and 0.2 on average. The ratios of LSP to pulsation period\ncluster around 5 and 10, presumably depending on whether the pulsation period\nis the fundamental or first overtone. The pulsation and LSP phase curves are\ngenerally close to sinusoidal, except when the amplitude is small, in which\ncase they may be distorted by observational scatter or, in the case of the LSP\namplitude, by the pulsational variability. As with longer-period stars, the LSP\namplitude increases and decreases by a factor of two or more, for unknown\nreasons, on a median time scale of about 20 LSPs. The LSP phenomenon is thus\npresent and simiklar in radially pulsating red giants of all periods. Its cause\nremains unknown.\n", "  Nanocavity lasers, which are an integral part of an on-chip integrated\nphotonic network, are setting stringent requirements on the sensitivity of the\ntechniques used to characterize the laser performance. Current characterization\ntools cannot provide detailed knowledge about nanolaser noise and dynamics. In\nthis progress article, we will present tools and concepts from the Bayesian\nmachine learning and digital coherent detection that offer novel approaches for\nhighly-sensitive laser noise characterization and inference of laser dynamics.\nThe goal of the paper is to trigger new research directions that combine the\nfields of machine learning and nanophotonics for characterizing nanolasers and\neventually integrated photonic networks\n", "  The transversity distribution was recently extracted from deep-inelastic\nscattering processes producing hadron pairs in the final state. Together with a\nspecific chiral-odd di-hadron fragmentation function, it is involved in the\nelementary mechanism that generates a transverse-spin asymmetry in the\nazimuthal distribution of the detected hadron pairs. The same elementary\nmechanism was predicted to generate an analogous asymmetry when the hadron\npairs are produced in proton-proton collisions with one transversely polarized\nproton. Recently, the STAR Collaboration has observed this asymmetry. We\nanalyze the impact of these data on our knowledge of transversity.\n", "  Measurements in the atmosphere and at the surface of Venus are required to\nunderstand fundamental processes of how terrestrial planets evolve and how they\nwork today. While the European Venus community is unified in its support of the\nEnVision orbiter proposal for the M5 opportunity, many scientific questions\nalso require in situ Venus exploration. ESA has already explored Venus entry /\ndescent probe science in its Planetary Entry Probe (PEP) study [ESA PEP study,\n2010], and Venus balloon science in its Venus Entry Probe Study [ESA VEP study,\n2005]; Venus balloons were also explored in detail by the European Venus\nExplorer (EVE) M1/M2 and M3 proposals [Chassefiere et al., 2009; Wilson et al.,\n2012]. While those in situ mission concepts remain scientifically compelling\nand technically feasible, the present call requests new scientific concepts.\nTherefore, in the present document, we suggest a long-duration lander at Venus,\nwhich would be capable of undertaking a seismometry mission, operating in the\n460{\\deg}C surface conditions of Venus.\n", "  This article provides the calculation of an effective vertex function between\na nucleon and a $Z^\\prime$ boson that couples preferentially to either the top\nquark or the third generation of fermions, for the purpose of calculating\nvector-portal dark matter nuclear recoil cross sections. Mixing effects between\nthe new gauge group $U(1)^\\prime$ and the Standard Model hypercharge group\n$U(1)_Y$ are taken into account. Contributions to the $U(1)^\\prime$ nucleon\ncurrent from heavy quarks are quantified using the heavy quark expansion. Also\ntaken into account are contributions from the 1-loop $Z^\\prime$-gluon\ninteractions and mixing-induced contributions from the light quarks in the\nnucleon. We find that, for reasonable values of the $U(1)^\\prime$ gauge\nparameter, contributions from the light quarks dominate despite being\nmixing-suppressed. It is shown that this holds for most models even if mixing\neffects do not appear at tree level. Contributions from the heavy quarks and\ngluons are suppressed by $1/m_Q^2$ and possibly also by momentum in the low\nmomentum transfer limits relevant for dark matter direct detection. We discuss\nunder which conditions the subdominant terms become relevant.\n", "  Determinations of the couplings of $N N (n \\pi) (n \\geq 1)$ are reported. The\nstudy is based on both a quark model of nucleon and a chiral field theory of\nmesons. The coupling of $N N \\pi$ is predicted and is in agreement with current\nvalue. It shows that the coupling $ N N 2 \\pi $ is resulted in the nature that\npion is a Goldstone boson. The couplings of $N N (n \\pi) (n \\geq 2)$ are\npredicted by this approach.\n", "  There exist conflicting observations on whether or not the environment of\nbroad and narrow line AGN differ and this consequently questions the validity\nof the AGN unification model. The high spectroscopic completeness of the GAMA\nsurvey makes it ideal for a comprehensive analysis of the close environment of\ngalaxies. To exploit this, and conduct a comparative analysis of the\nenvironment of broad and narrow line AGN within GAMA, we use a double-Gaussian\nemission line fitting method to model the more complex line profiles associated\nwith broad line AGN. We select 209 type 1 (i.e., unobscured), 464 type 1.5-1.9\n(partially obscured), and 281 type 2 (obscured) AGN within the GAMA II\ndatabase. Comparing the fractions of these with neighbouring galaxies out to a\npair separation of $350\\,\\text{kpc }h^{-1}$ and $\\Delta z < 0.012$ shows no\ndifference between AGN of different type, except at separations less than\n$20\\,\\text{kpc }h^{-1}$ where our observations suggest an excess of type 2 AGN\nin close pairs. We analyse the properties of the galaxies neighbouring our AGN\nand find no significant differences in colour or the star formation activity of\nthese galaxies. Further to this we find that $\\Sigma_5$ is also consistent\nbetween broad and narrow line AGN. We conclude that the observations presented\nhere are consistent with AGN unification.\n", "  We report the development of a versatile material preparation chain for\nintermetallic compounds that focuses on the realization of a high-purity growth\nenvironment. The preparation chain comprises of an argon glovebox, an\ninductively heated horizontal cold boat furnace, an arc melting furnace, an\ninductively heated rod casting furnace, an optically heated floating-zone\nfurnace, a resistively heated annealing furnace, and an inductively heated\nannealing furnace. The cold boat furnace and the arc melting furnace may be\nloaded from the glovebox by means of a load-lock permitting to synthesize\ncompounds starting with air-sensitive elements while handling the constituents\nexclusively in an inert gas atmosphere. All furnaces are all-metal sealed,\nbakeable, and may be pumped to ultra-high vacuum. We find that the latter\nrepresents an important prerequisite for handling compounds with high vapor\npressure under high-purity argon atmosphere. We illustrate operational aspects\nof the preparation chain in terms of the single-crystal growth of the\nheavy-fermion compound CeNi2Ge2.\n", "  Snowflake growth provides us with a fascinating example of spontaneous\npattern formation in nature. Attempts to understand this phenomenon have led to\nimportant insights in non-equilibrium dynamics observed in various active\nscientific fields, ranging from pattern formation in physical and chemical\nsystems, to self-assembly problems in biology. Yet, very few models currently\nsucceed in reproducing the diversity of snowflake forms in three dimensions,\nand the link between model parameters and thermodynamic quantities is not\nestablished. Here, we report a modified phase field model that describes the\nsubtlety of the ice vapour phase transition, through anisotropic water\nmolecules attachment and condensation, surface diffusion, and strong\nanisotropic surface tension, that guarantee the anisotropy, faceting and\ndendritic growth of snowflakes. We demonstrate that this model reproduces the\ngrowth dynamics of the most challenging morphologies of snowflakes from the\nNakaya diagram. We find that the growth dynamics of snow crystals matches the\nselection theory, consistently with previous experimental observations.\n", "  Future energy-frontier electron-positron colliders will be capable of\nhigh-precision studies of top quark properties. The measurement of the top-pair\nproduction cross section around the threshold provides access to the mass of\nthe top quark in theoretically well-defined schemes, with statistical\nuncertainties of 20 MeV or less, depending on the assumed integrated luminosity\nof the measurement. At this level of precision, experimental and theory\nsystematics are likely to become important or even dominant. This contribution\npresents a first analysis of the impact of the remaining uncertainties of the\nrecently completed calculation of the top pair production cross section at\nNNNLO QCD including the exchange of Higgs bosons on the extraction of the top\nquark mass from a threshold scan. The analysis is based on reconstruction\nefficiencies and background levels obtained in full simulation studies for\nCLIC, combined with signal cross sections from the higher-order calculations.\nTo assess possible differences between different collider options, the study is\nperformed in the context of CLIC, ILC and FCC-ee by considering the differences\nin the luminosity spectra.\n", "  We formulate a nonlinear synergistic theory of coevolutionary systems,\ndisentangling and explaining dynamic complexity in terms of fundamental\nprocesses for optimised data analysis and dynamic model design: Dynamic Source\nAnalysis (DSA). DSA provides a nonlinear dynamical basis for spatiotemporal\ndatasets or dynamical models, eliminating redundancies and expressing the\nsystem in terms of the smallest number of fundamental processes and\ninteractions without loss of information. This optimises model design in\ndynamical systems, expressing complex coevolution in simple synergistic terms,\nyielding physically meaningful spatial and temporal structures. These are\nextracted by spatiotemporal decomposition of nonlinearly interacting subspaces\nvia the novel concept of a Spatiotemporal Coevolution Manifold. Physical\nconsistency is ensured and mathematical ambiguities are avoided with\nfundamental principles on energy minimisation and entropy production. The\nrelevance of DSA is illustrated by retrieving a non-redundant, synergistic set\nof nonlinear geophysical processes exerting control over precipitation in space\nand time over the Euro-Atlantic region. For that purpose, a nonlinear\nspatiotemporal basis is extracted from geopotential data fields, yielding two\nindependent dynamic sources dominated respectively by meridional and zonal\ncirculation gradients. These sources are decomposed into spatial and temporal\nstructures corresponding to multiscale climate dynamics. The added value of\nnonlinear predictability is brought out in the geospatial evaluation and\ndynamic simulation of evolving precipitation distributions from the geophysical\ncontrols, using DSA-driven model building and implementation. The simulated\nprecipitation is found to be in agreement with observational data, which they\nnot only describe but also dynamically link and attribute in synergistic terms\nof the retrieved dynamic sources.\n", "  Celeste is a procedure for inferring astronomical catalogs that attains\nstate-of-the-art scientific results. To date, Celeste has been scaled to at\nmost hundreds of megabytes of astronomical images: Bayesian posterior inference\nis notoriously demanding computationally. In this paper, we report on a\nscalable, parallel version of Celeste, suitable for learning catalogs from\nmodern large-scale astronomical datasets. Our algorithmic innovations include a\nfast numerical optimization routine for Bayesian posterior inference and a\nstatistically efficient scheme for decomposing astronomical optimization\nproblems into subproblems.\n  Our scalable implementation is written entirely in Julia, a new high-level\ndynamic programming language designed for scientific and numerical computing.\nWe use Julia's high-level constructs for shared and distributed memory\nparallelism, and demonstrate effective load balancing and efficient scaling on\nup to 8192 Xeon cores on the NERSC Cori supercomputer.\n", "  The oxygen vacancy is a crucial intrinsic defect in metal-ultrathin oxide\nsemiconductor heterostructures, and its formation at an interface is of great\nimportance in determining the device performance and degradation. This paper\npresents an ab initio thermodynamic study of oxygen vacancies at metal/oxide\ninterfaces. Electronic energies and entropies are calculated for defective\ninterface systems, as a function of interface-vacancy distance. The study\nindicates that oxygen vacancies near the interface modify its bonding\nstructure, and significantly change the thermodynamic properties of the system\n(i.e., electronic energy and entropy) compared to bulk-like oxygen vacancies.\nWe illustrate that different factors, including the vacancy location dependence\non the energy and entropy, the temperature dependence on the entropy, and the\ntemperature and partial pressure dependence on the oxygen chemical potential,\nare all important in determining the Gibbs free energy of formation of oxygen\nvacancy.\n", "  We explore the potential of a formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations\nincorporating a random description of the small-scale velocity component. This\nmodel, established from a version of the Reynolds transport theorem adapted to\na stochastic representation of the flow, gives rise to a large-scale\ndescription of the flow dynamics in which emerges an anisotropic subgrid\ntensor, reminiscent to the Reynolds stress tensor, together with a drift\ncorrection due to an inhomogeneous turbulence. The corresponding subgrid model,\nwhich depends on the small scales velocity variance, generalizes the Boussinesq\neddy viscosity assumption. However, it is not anymore obtained from an analogy\nwith molecular dissipation but ensues rigorously from the random modeling of\nthe flow. This principle allows us to propose several subgrid models defined\ndirectly on the resolved flow component. We assess and compare numerically\nthose models on a standard Green-Taylor vortex flow at Reynolds 1600. The\nnumerical simulations, carried out with an accurate divergence-free scheme,\noutperform classical large-eddies formulations and provides a simple\ndemonstration of the pertinence of the proposed large-scale modeling.\n", "  In this work the linear elastic properties of materials containing spherical\nvoids are calculated and compared using finite element simulations. The focus\nis on homogeneous solid materials with spherical, empty voids of equal size.\nThe voids are arranged on crystalline lattices (SC, BCC, FCC and HCP structure)\nor randomly, and may overlap in order to produce connected voids. In that way,\nthe entire range of void fraction between 0.00 and 0.95 is covered, including\nclosed-cell and open-cell structures. For each arrangement of voids and for\ndifferent void fractions the full stiffness tensor is computed. From this, the\nYoung's modulus and Poisson ratios are derived for different orientations.\nSpecial care is taken of assessing and reducing the numerical uncertainty of\nthe method. In that way, a reliable quantitative comparison of different void\nstructures is carried out. Among other things, this work shows that the Young's\nmodulus of FCC in the (1 1 1) plane differs from HCP in the (0 0 0 1) plane,\neven though these structures are very similar. For a given void fraction SC\noffers the highest and the lowest Young's modulus depending on the direction.\nFor BCC at a critical void fraction a switch of the elastic behaviour is found,\nas regards the direction in which the Young's modulus is maximised. For certain\ncrystalline void arrangements and certain directions Poisson ratios between 0\nand 1 were found, including values that exceed the bounds for isotropic\nmaterials. For subsequent investigations the full stiffness tensor for a range\nof void arrangements and void fractions are provided in the supplemental\nmaterial.\n", "  Stellar winds govern the angular momentum evolution of solar-like stars\nthroughout their main-sequence lifetime. The efficiency of this process depends\non the geometry of the star's magnetic field. There has been a rapid increase\nrecently in the number of stars for which this geometry can be determined\nthrough spectropolarimetry. We present a computationally efficient method to\ndetermine the 3D geometry of the stellar wind and to estimate the mass loss\nrate and angular momentum loss rate based on these observations. Using solar\nmagnetograms as examples, we quantify the extent to which the values obtained\nare affected by the limited spatial resolution of stellar observations. We find\nthat for a typical stellar surface resolution of 20$^{\\rm o}$-30$^{\\rm o}$,\npredicted wind speeds are within 5$\\%$ of the value at full resolution. Mass\nloss rates and angular momentum loss rates are within 5-20$\\%$. In contrast,\nthe predicted X-ray emission measures can be under-estimated by 1-2 orders of\nmagnitude, and their rotational modulations by 10-20$\\%$.\n", "  The elastic properties of a material with spherical voids of equal volume are\nanalysed using a new model, with particular attention paid to the hexagonal\nclose-packed and the face-centred cubic arrangement of voids. Void fractions\nwell above 74 \\% are considered, yielding overlapping voids as in an open-cell\nfoam and hence a connected pore structure. The material is represented by a\nnetwork of beams. The elastic behaviour of each beam is derived analytically\nfrom the material structure. By computing the linear elastic properties of the\nbeam network, the Young's moduli and Poisson ratios for different directions\nare evaluated. In the limit of rigidity loss a power law is obtained,\ndescribing the relation between Young's modulus and void fraction with an\nexponent of 5/2 for bending-dominated and 3/2 for stretching-dominated\ndirections. The corresponding Poisson ratios vary between 0 and 1. With\ndecreasing void fraction, these exponents become 2.3 and 1.3, respectively. The\ndata obtained analytically and from the new beam model are compared to Finite\nElement simulations carried out in a companion study, and good agreement is\nfound. The hexagonal close-packed void arrangement features very anisotropic\nbehaviour, comparable to that of fibre-reinforced materials, This might allow\nfor new applications of open-cell materials.\n", "  We show that chimera patterns can be induced by noise in nonlocally coupled\nneural networks in the excitable regime. In contrast to classical chimeras,\noccurring in noise-free oscillatory networks, they have features of two\nphenomena: coherence resonance and chimera states. Therefore, we call them\ncoherence-resonance chimeras. These patterns demonstrate the constructive role\nof noise and appear for intermediate values of noise intensity, which is a\ncharacteristic feature of coherence resonance. In the coherence-resonance\nchimera state a neural network of identical elements splits into two coexisting\ndomains with different behavior: spatially coherent and spatially incoherent, a\ntypical property of chimera states. Moreover, these noise-induced chimera\nstates are characterized by alternating behavior: coherent and incoherent\ndomains switch periodically their location. We show that this alternating\nswitching can be explained by analyzing the coupling functions.\n", "  Many compelling theories to address the Higgs hierarchy problem predict\nstrong interactions between the top and a sector of New Physics. In minimal\ncomposite Higgs models (CHM), the top interactions with a BSM\nstrongly-interacting sector give the leading contribution to trigger the EWSB\nand generate a light mass for the pseudo-NG Higgs. This implies that new\ncomposite states (vector-like top-partners, composite vector resonances, new\ncomposite scalars) dominantly interact with third-generation quarks and, when\nproduced at colliders, generate top quarks in the final state. I will indicate\ninteresting signatures involving top quarks for CHM discovery/test at the LHC\nand future colliders.\n", "  Radial profiles of the ion saturation current and its fluctuation statistics\nare presented from probe measurements in L-mode, neutral beam heated plasmas at\nthe outboard mid-plane region of KSTAR. The familiar two-layer structure, seen\nelsewhere in tokamak L-mode discharges, with a steep near-SOL profile and a\nbroad far-SOL profile, is observed. The profile scale length in the far-SOL\nincreases drastically with line-averaged density, thereby enhancing plasma\ninteractions with the main chamber walls. Time series from the far-SOL region\nare characterised by large-amplitude bursts attributed to the radial motion of\nblob-like plasma filaments. Analysis of a data time series of several seconds\nduration under stationary plasma conditions reveals the statistical properties\nof these fluctuations, including the rate of level crossings and the average\nduration of periods spent above a given threshold level. This is shown to be in\nexcellent agreement with predictions of a stochastic model, giving novel\npredictions of plasma-wall interactions due to transient transport events.\n", "  This paper presents W-waveform Standing Surface Acoustic Waves (W-SSAW), and\nas its application, patterning of two groups of microparticles with different\nsizes alternately without fixing firstly patterned particles. W-SSAW is\nconstructed by two standing surface acoustic waves of frequencies $f$ and $2f$.\nCombined with linear phase modulation to translate Gor'kov potential at a\nconstant speed, W-SSAW can selectively trap particles. The trapped particles\nfollow the moving Gor'kov potential maintaining force equilibrium between\nStokes' drag and the radiation force by W-SSAW. There exist two asymmetric\nequilibrium positions every period, and by the asymmetry, each group of\nparticles is trapped at different equilibrium positions to form an alternate\npattern. This technique is extended to two-dimensional alternate patterning by\nmaintaining phase difference $90^\\circ$ between X- and Y-directional W-SSAWs.\nThe patterning method utilizing W-SSAW is advantageous over SSAW-based\npatterning in that it does not require temporal separation to fix firstly\npatterned particles.\n", "  We present a method to study engagement level uniformity in a class of\nstudents. We validate our method by comparing two semesters taught using\ndifferent methods in a physics and mathematics course. The first semester used\nconventional methods while the second semester used graphic spreadsheets-based\nlaboratories and homework before the introduction of formal methods. We found\nthat engagement of the students that were below the median at the beginning of\nthe semester improved by an order of magnitude (by our metric) while the\nengagement level of students initially above the median did not change.\n", "  Black phosphorous (BP) is one of the most interesting layered materials,\nbearing promising potential for emerging electronic and optoelectronic device\ntechnologies. The crystalline structure of BP displays in-plane anisotropy in\naddition to the out-of-plane anisotropy characteristic to layered materials.\nTherefore, BP supports anisotropic optical and transport responses that can\nenable unique device architectures. Its thickness-dependent direct bandgap\nvaries in the range of around 0.3-2.0 eV (from single-layer to bulk,\nrespectively), making BP suitable to optoelectronics in a broad spectral range.\nWith high room-temperature mobility, exceeding 1,000 cm2V-1s-1 in thin films,\nBP is also a very promising material for electronics. However, BP is sensitive\nto oxygen and humidity due to its three-fold coordinated atoms. The surface\nelectron lone pairs are reactive and can lead to structural degradation upon\nexposure to air, leading to significant device performance degradation in\nambient condition. Here, we report a viable solution to overcome degradation in\nfew-layer BP by passivating the surface with self-assembled monolayers of\noctadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) that provide long-term stability in ambient\nconditions. Importantly, we show that this treatment does not cause any\nundesired carrier doping of the bulk channel material, thanks to the emergent\nhierarchical interface structure. Our approach is compatible with conventional\nelectronic materials processing technologies thus providing an immediate route\ntoward practical applications in BP devices.\n", "  We address the impact of sterile fermions on charged lepton electric dipole\nmoments. We show that in order to have a non-vanishing contribution to electric\ndipole moments, the minimal extension necessitates the addition of at least two\nsterile fermion states. Sterile neutrinos can give significant contributions to\nthe charged lepton electric dipole moments if the masses of the non-degenerate\nsterile states are both above the electroweak scale. In addition, the Majorana\nnature of neutrinos is also important. Furthermore, we apply the computations\nof the electric dipole moments for the most minimal realisation of the Inverse\nSeesaw mechanism, in which the Standard Model is extended by two right-handed\nneutrinos and two sterile fermion states. We show that the two pairs of (heavy)\npseudo-Dirac mass eigenstates can give significant contributions to the\nelectron electric dipole moment, lying close to future experimental\nsensitivity. We further discuss the possibility of beyond the minimal Inverse\nSeesaw models and of having a successful leptogenesis in this framework.\n", "  Quantum amplitude amplification and quantum phase estimation are two\nfundamental quantum algorithms. All known quantum algorithms are derived from\nthese two algorithms. Even the adiabatic quantum algorithms can also be\nefficiently simulated using quantum phase estimation. We present a universal\nquantum algorithm which explains these two algorithms as special cases. An\ninteresting result is that we do not need quantum fourier transform to do\nquantum phase estimation.\n", "  We report near infrared optical amplification in gold diffused\nsilicon-on-insulator waveguides by visible optical pumping. More then 30dB/cm\ngain was measured for a light carrier at a wavelength of 1.55 microns\n", "  The conformal transformation of the Hawking-Hayward quasi-local mass is\nreexamined. It has been found recently that the conformal transformation of the\nlatter exhibits the 'wrong' conformal factor compared to the way usual masses\ntransform under conformal transformations of spacetime. We show, in analogy\nwith what was found recently for the Misner-Sharp mass, that unlike the purely\ngeometric definition of the Hawking-Hayward mass, the latter exhibits the\n'right' conformal factor whenever expressed in terms of its material content\nvia the field equations. The case of conformally invariant scalar-tensor\ntheories of gravity is also examined. The equivalence between the Misner-Sharp\nmass and the Hawking-Hayward mass for spherically symmetric spacetimes\nmanifests itself by giving identical peculiar behaviors under conformal\ntransformations.\n", "  We prove that the family of non-linear $W$-algebras $SW(3/2,2)$ which are\nextensions of the $N=1$ superconformal algebra by a primary supercurrent of\nconformal weight $2$ can be realized as a quantum Hamiltonian reduction of the\nLie superalgebra $osp(3|2)$. In consequence we obtain an explicit free field\nrealization of the algebra in terms of the screening operators. At central\ncharge $c=12$ the $SW(3/2,2)$ superconformal algebra corresponds to the\nsuperconformal algebra associated to sigma models based on eight-dimensional\nmanifolds with special holonomy $Spin(7)$, i.e., the Shatashvili-Vafa $Spin(7)$\nsuperconformal algebra.\n"]}
