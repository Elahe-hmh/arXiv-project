conjectured that any trigonometric Olshanetsky-Perelomov Hamiltonian\nwritten in Fundamental Trigonometric Invariants (FTI) as coordinates takes an\nalgebraic form and preserves an infinite flag of spaces of polynomials. It is\nshown that try-and-guess variables which led to the algebraic form of\ntrigonometric Olshanetsky-Perelomov Hamiltonians related to root spaces of the\nclassical $A_N, B_N, C_N, D_N, BC_N$ and exceptional $G_2, F_4$ Lie algebras\nare FTI. This conjecture is also confirmed for the trigonometric $E_6$\nOlshanetsky-Perelomov Hamiltonian whose algebraic form is found with the use of\nFTI.\n", "  We develop a renormalization group method to investigate synchronization\nclusters in a one-dimensional chain of nearest-neighbor coupled phase\noscillators. The method is best suited for chains with strong disorder in the\nintrinsic frequencies and coupling strengths. The results are compared with\nnumerical simulations of the chain dynamics and good agreement in several\ncharacteristics is found. We apply the renormalization group and simulations to\nLorentzian distributions of intrinsic frequencies and couplings and investigate\nthe statistics of the resultant cluster sizes and frequencies, as well as the\ndependence of the characteristic cluster length upon parameters of these\nLorentzian distributions.\n", "  It is shown that the $E_7$ trigonometric Olshanetsky-Perelomov Hamiltonian,\nwhen written in terms of the Fundamental Trigonometric Invariants (FTI), is in\nalgebraic form, i.e., has polynomial coefficients, and preserves the infinite\nflag of polynomial spaces with the characteristic vector $\\vec \\alpha =\n(1,2,2,2,3,3,4)$. Its flag coincides with one of the minimal characteristic\nvector for the $E_7$ rational model.\n", "  A new direct integration method is established to construct the solutions of\nthe stationary BBGKY hierarchy, assuming the usual form of the equilibrium\ncorrelation functions, for infinite classical systems of particles interacting\nvia a smooth, stable and regular two body potential. The equivalence between\nthe corresponding infinite hierarchy and the Kirkwood--Salsburg equations is\nproved. A problem of existence and uniqueness of the solutions of the hierarchy\nwith appropriate boundary conditions is thus solved for low densities. The\nresult is extended in a milder sense to systems with a hard core interaction.\nComparisons are provided with different integration techniques.\n", "  The series expansion for the evolution of the correlation functions of a\nfinite system of hard spheres is derived from direct integration of the\nsolution of the Liouville equation, with minimal regularity assumptions on the\ndensity of the initial measure. The usual BBGKY hierarchy of equations is then\nrecovered. A graphical language based on the notion of collision history\noriginally introduced by Spohn is developed, as a useful tool for the\ndescription of the expansion and of the elimination of degrees of freedom.\n", "  Charged-current single pion production in scattering off 12C is investigated\nfor neutrino energies up to 1 GeV. An impact of nuclear effects with in-medium\nmodifications of the Delta(1232) resonance properties as well as an effective\nfield theory nonresonant background contribution are discussed. Dependence of\nthe fraction of Delta(1232) decays into npnh states on incident neutrino energy\nis estimated. A model of Nieves et al. [1] is further developed by performing\nexact integration avoiding several approximations. The effect of exact\nintegration is investigated both for double-differential and total\nneutrino-nucleus cross sections.\n", "  We consider a classical system of point particles interacting by means of a\nshort range potential. We prove that, in the low--density (Boltzmann--Grad)\nlimit, the system behaves, for short times, as predicted by the associated\nBoltzmann equation. This is a revisitation and an extension of the thesis of\nKing (unpublished), appeared after the well known result of Lanford for hard\nspheres, and of a recent paper by Gallagher et al (arXiv: 1208.5753v1). Our\nanalysis applies to any stable and smooth potential. In the case of repulsive\npotentials (with no attractive parts), we estimate explicitly the rate of\nconvergence.\n", "  We present the geometric formulation of gravity based on the mathematical\nstructure of a Lie Algebroid. We show that this framework provides the\ngeometrical setting to describe the gauge propriety of gravity.\n", "  We present a local classification of conformally equivalent but oppositely\noriented 4-dimensional Kaehler metrics which are toric with respect to a common\n2-torus action. In the generic case, these \"ambitoric\" structures have an\nintriguing local geometry depending on a quadratic polynomial q and arbitrary\nfunctions A and B of one variable.\n  We use this description to classify Einstein 4-metrics which are hermitian\nwith respect to both orientations, as well a class of solutions to the\nEinstein-Maxwell equations including riemannian analogues of the\nPlebanski-Demianski metrics. Our classification can be viewed as a riemannian\nanalogue of a result in relativity due to R. Debever, N. Kamran, and R.\nMcLenaghan, and is a natural extension of the classification of selfdual\nEinstein hermitian 4-manifolds, obtained independently by R. Bryant and the\nfirst and third authors.\n  These Einstein metrics are precisely the ambitoric structures with vanishing\nBach tensor, and thus have the property that the associated toric Kaehler\nmetrics are extremal (in the sense of E. Calabi). Our main results also\nclassify the latter, providing new examples of explicit extremal Kaehler\nmetrics. For both the Einstein-Maxwell and the extremal ambitoric structures, A\nand B are quartic polynomials, but with different conditions on the\ncoefficients. In the sequel to this paper we consider global examples, and use\nthem to resolve the existence problem for extremal Kaehler metrics on toric\n4-orbifolds with second betti number b2=2.\n", "  The generators of the algebra $gl_{n+1}$ in a form of differential operators\nof the first order acting on ${\\bf R}^n$ with matrix coefficients are\nexplicitly written. The algebraic Hamiltonians for a matrix generalization of\n$3-$body Calogero and Sutherland models are presented.\n", "  Experimental data measured in sqrt(s)=2.76 TeV Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC\nshow a significant enhancement of events with an unbalanced pair of\nreconstructed jet momenta in comparison with p+p collisions. This enhancement\nof momentum imbalance is supposed to be caused by the different momentum loss\nof the initial back-to-back di-partons by scatterings within the created dense\nmedium. For investigating the underlying partonic momentum loss we employ the\non-shell transport model BAMPS (Boltzmann Approach for Multi-Parton Scattering)\nfor full heavy-ion collisions, which numerically solves the 3+1D Boltzmann\nequation based on 2->2 as well as inelastic 2<->3 scattering processes,\ntogether with PYTHIA initial state conditions for the parton showers. Due to\nthe employed test-particle approach jet reconstruction within BAMPS events is\nnot trivial. We introduce a method that nevertheless allows the microscopic\nsimulation of the full evolution of the shower particles, recoiled medium\nparticles, and the underlying bulk medium in one common microscopic framework.\nWith this method it is possible to investigate the role of the medium recoil\nfor the momentum imbalance A_J while using well-established background\nsubtraction algorithms. Due to the available particle information in\nconfiguration as well as momentum space within BAMPS, it is additionally\npossible to reproduce the entire evolution of the reconstructed jets within the\nmedium. With this information we investigate the sensitivity of the jet\nmomentum loss from the difference in the partonic in-medium path lengths.\n", "  Using the Usadel equation approach, we provide a compact formalism to\ncalculate the critical current density of 21 different types of ferromagnetic\n(F) Josephson junctions containing insulating (I) and normal metal (N) layers\nin the weak link regions. In particular, we obtain that even a thin additional\nN layer may shift the 0-$\\pi$ transitions to larger or smaller values of the\nthickness $d_F$ of the ferromagnet, depending on its conducting properties. For\ncertain values of $d_F$, a 0-$\\pi$ transition can even be achieved by changing\nonly the N layer thickness. We use our model to fit experimental data of SIFS\nand SINFS tunnel junctions, where S is a superconducting electrode.\n", "  Electric field effect (EFE) controlled magnetoelectric transport in thin\nfilms of undoped and La-doped Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$ (SIO) were investigated under\nthe action of ionic liquid gating. Despite large carrier density modulation,\nthe temperature dependent resistance measurements exhibit insulating behavior\nin chemically and EFE doped samples with the band filling up to 10\\%. The\nambipolar transport across the Mott gap is demonstrated by EFE tuning of the\nactivation energy. Further, we observe a crossover from a negative\nmagnetoresistance (MR) at high temperatures to positive MR at low temperatures.\nThe crossover temperature was around $\\sim$80-90 K, irrespective of the\nfilling. This temperature and magnetic field dependent crossover is\nqualitatively associated with a change in the conduction mechanism from Mott to\nCoulomb gap mediated variable range hopping (VRH). This explains the origin of\nrobust insulating ground state of SIO in electrical transport studies and\nhighlights the importance of disorder and Coulombic interaction on electrical\nproperties of SIO.\n", "  We find explicit solutions of the Heisenberg equations of motion for a\nquadratic Hamiltonian, describing a generic model of variable media, in the\ncase of multi-parameter squeezed input photon configuration. The corresponding\nprobability amplitudes and photon statistics are also derived in the\nSchr\u007foedinger picture in an abstract operator setting of the quantum\nelectrodynamics (QED). Their time evolution is given in terms of solutions of\ncertain Ermakov-type system. The unitary transformation and an extension of the\nsqueeze/evolution operator are introduced formally.\n", "  We present a quantitative analysis of the Boltzmann-Grad (low-density) limit\nof a hard sphere system. We introduce and study a set of functions (correlation\nerrors) measuring the deviations in time from the statistical independence of\nparticles (propagation of chaos). In the context of the BBGKY hierarchy, a\ncorrelation error of order $k$ measures the event where $k$ particles are\nconnected by a chain of interactions preventing the factorization. We show\nthat, provided $k < \\varepsilon^{-\\alpha}$, such an error flows to zero with\nthe average density $\\varepsilon$, for short times, as $\\varepsilon^{\\gamma\nk}$, for some positive $\\alpha,\\gamma \\in (0,1)$. This provides an information\non the size of chaos, namely, $j$ different particles behave as dictated by the\nBoltzmann equation even when $j$ diverges as a negative power of $\\varepsilon$.\nThe result requires a rearrangement of Lanford perturbative series into a\ncumulant type expansion, and an analysis of many-recollision events.\n", "  We investigate the dynamics of triaxial collapse in terms of eigenvalues of\nthe deformation tensor, the velocity derivative tensor and the gravity Hessian.\nUsing the Bond-Myers model of ellipsoidal collapse, we derive a new set of\nequations for the nine eigenvalues and examine their dynamics in phase space.\nThe main advantage of this form is that it eliminates the complicated elliptic\nintegrals that appear in the axes evolution equations and is more natural way\nto understand the interplay between the perturbations.\n  This paper focuses on the density-velocity dynamics. The Zeldovich\napproximation implies that the three tensors are proportional; the\nproportionality constant is set by demanding `no decaying modes'. We extend\nthis condition into the non-linear regime and find that the eigenvalues of the\ngravity Hessian and the velocity derivative tensor are related as ${\\tilde q}_d\n+ {\\tilde q}_v=1$, where the triaxiality parameter ${\\tilde q} =\n(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{max}} - \\lambda_{\\mathrm{inter}})/(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{max}} -\n\\lambda_{\\mathrm{min}})$. This is a {\\it new universal relation} holding true\nover all redshifts and a range of mass scales to within a few percent accuracy.\nThe mean density-velocity divergence relation at late times is close to linear,\nindicating that the dynamics is dictated by collapse along the largest\neigendirection. This relation has a scatter, which we show, is intimately\nconnected to the velocity shear. Finally, as an application, we compute the\nPDFs of the two variables and compare with other forms in the literature.\n", "  We study the statistics of backward clusters in a gas of hard spheres at low\ndensity. A backward cluster is defined as the group of particles involved\ndirectly or indirectly in the backwards-in-time dynamics of a given tagged\nsphere. We derive upper and lower bounds on the average size of clusters by\nusing the theory of the homogeneous Boltzmann equation combined with suitable\nhierarchical expansions. These representations are known in the easier context\nof Maxwellian molecules (Wild sums). We test our results with a numerical\nexperiment based on molecular dynamics simulations.\n", "  Analysis of three-dimensional cosmological surveys has the potential to\nanswer outstanding questions on the initial conditions from which structure\nappeared, and therefore on the very high energy physics at play in the early\nUniverse. We report on recently proposed statistical data analysis methods\ndesigned to study the primordial large-scale structure via physical inference\nof the initial conditions in a fully Bayesian framework, and applications to\nthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey data release 7. We illustrate how this approach\nled to a detailed characterization of the dynamic cosmic web underlying the\nobserved galaxy distribution, based on the tidal environment.\n", "  We investigate theoretically the effect of nearby As (arsenic) vacancies on\nthe magnetic properties of substitutional Mn (manganese) impurities on the GaAs\n(110) surface, using a microscopic tight-binding model which captures the\nsalient features of the electronic structure of both types of defects in GaAs.\nThe calculations show that the binding energy of the Mn-acceptor is essentially\nunaffected by the presence of a neutral As vacancy, even at the shortest\npossible ${\\rm V}_{\\rm As}$--Mn separation. On the other hand, in contrast to a\nsimple tip-induced-band-bending theory and in agreement with experiment, for a\npositively charged As vacancy the Mn-acceptor binding energy is significantly\nreduced as the As vacancy is brought closer to the Mn impurity. For two Mn\nimpurities aligned ferromagnetically, we find that nearby charged As vacancies\nenhance the energy level splitting of the associated coupled acceptor levels,\nleading to an increase of the effective exchange interaction. Neutral vacancies\nleave the exchange splitting unchanged. Since it is experimentally possible to\nswitch reversibly between the two charge states of the vacancy, such a local\nelectric manipulation of the magnetic dopants could result in an efficient\nreal-time control of their exchange interaction.\n", "  Review of From Newton to Boltzmann: Hard Spheres and Short-range Potentials,\nby Isabelle Gallagher, Laure Saint-Raymond and Benjamin Texier, European\nMathematical Society, Z\\\"urich, 2014, xi+135 pp., ISBN 978-3- 03719-129-3.\n", "  We prove that the evolution of marginals associated to the empirical measure\nof a finite system of hard spheres is driven by the BBGKY hierarchical\nexpansion. The usual hierarchy of equations for $L^1$ measures is obtained as a\ncorollary. We discuss the ambiguities arising in the corresponding notion of\nmicroscopic series solution to the Boltzmann-Enskog equation.\n", "  We constrain radio source clustering towards $Planck$-selected galaxy\nclusters using the NVSS point source catalogue. The constraint can be utilised\nfor generating realistic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (SZE) mocks, and for\npredicting detectable clusters count and quantifying source confusion in radio\nsurveys.\n", "  We introduce a method of characterization of non-Markovianity using coherence\nof a system interacting with the environment. We show that under the allowed\nincoherent operations, monotonicity of a valid coherence measure is affected\ndue to non-Markovian features of the system-environment evolution. We also\ndefine a measure to quantify non-Markovianity of the underlying dynamics based\non the non-monotonic behavior of the coherence measure. We investigate our\nproposed non-Markovianity marker in the behavior of dephasing and dissipative\ndynamics for one and two qubit cases. We also show that our proposed measure\ncaptures the back-flow of information from the environment to the system and\ncompatible with well known distinguishability criteria of non-Markovianity.\n", "  The analysis of multiparticle quantum states is a central problem in quantum\ninformation processing. This task poses several challenges for experimenters\nand theoreticians. We give an overview over current problems and possible\nsolutions concerning systematic errors of quantum devices, the reconstruction\nof quantum states, and the analysis of correlations and complexity in\nmultiparticle density matrices.\n", "  The second (unphysical) critical charge in the 3-body quantum Coulomb system\nof a nucleus of positive charge $Z$ and mass $m_p$, and two electrons,\npredicted by F~Stillinger has been calculated to be equal to $Z_{B}^{\\infty}\\\n=\\ 0.904854$ and $Z_{B}^{m_p}\\ =\\ 0.905138$ for infinite and finite (proton)\nmass $m_p$, respectively. It is shown that in both cases, the ground state\nenergy $E(Z)$ (analytically continued beyond the first critical charge $Z_c$,\nfor which the ionization energy vanishes, to $Re Z < Z_c$) has a square-root\nbranch point with exponent 3/2 at $Z=Z_B$ in the complex $Z$-plane. Based on\nanalytic continuation, the second, excited, spin-singlet bound state of\nnegative hydrogen ion H${}^-$ is predicted to be at -0.51554 a.u. (-0.51531\na.u. for the finite proton mass $m_p$). The first critical charge $Z_c$ is\nfound accurately for a finite proton mass $m_p$ in the Lagrange mesh method,\n$Z^{m_p}_{c}\\ =\\ 0.911\\, 069\\, 724\\, 655$.\n", "  A model for the dark halos of galaxy clusters, based on the Weyl geometric\nscalar tensor theory of gravity (WST) with a MOND-like approximation, is\nproposed. It is uniquely determined by the baryonic mass distribution of hot\ngas and stars. A first heuristic check against empirical data for 19 clusters\n(2 of which are outliers), taken from the literature, shows encouraging\nresults. Modulo a caveat resulting from different background theories (Einstein\ngravity plus $\\Lambda CDM$ versus WST), the total mass for 15 of the outlier\nreduced ensemble of 17 clusters seems to be predicted correctly (in the sense\nof overlapping $1\\,\\sigma$ error intervals).\n", "  Charge separation in light-harvesting complexes occurs in a pair of tightly\ncoupled chlorophylls at the heart of photosynthetic reaction centers of both\nplants and bacteria. Recently it has been shown that quantum coherence can, in\nprinciple, enhance the efficiency of a solar cell, working like a quantum heat\nengine (QHE). Here, we propose a biological quantum heat engine (BQHE)\nmotivated by Photosystem {\\rm II} reaction center (PS{\\rm II} RC) to describe\nthe charge separation. Our model mainly considers two charge-separation\npathways more than that in the published literature. The two pathways can\ninterfere via cross-couplings and work together to enhance the\ncharge-separation yields. We explore how these cross-couplings increase the\ncurrent and voltage of the charge separation and discuss the advantages of\nmultiple pathways in terms of current and power. The robustness of the BQHE\nagainst the charge recombination in natural PS{\\rm II} RC and dephasing induced\nby environments is also explored, and extension from two pathways to multiple\npathways is made. These results suggest that nature-mimicking architectures\nwith engineered multiple pathways for charge separations might be better for\nartificial solar energy devices.\n", "  Holonomic quantum computation (HQC) may not show its full potential in\nquantum speedup due to the prerequisite of a long coherent runtime imposed by\nthe adiabatic condition. Here we show that the conventional HQC can be\ndramatically accelerated by using external control fields, of which the\neffectiveness is exclusively determined by the integral of the control fields\nin the time domain. Remarkably this control scheme can be realized with net\nzero energy cost and it is fault-tolerant against fluctuation and noise,\nsignificantly relaxing the experimental constraints. We demonstrate how to\nrealize the scheme via decoherence-free subspaces. In this way we unify quantum\nrobustness merits of this fault-tolerant control scheme, the conventional HQC\nand decoherence-free subspace, and propose an {\\em expedited} holonomic quantum\ncomputation protocol.\n", "  The excitation of surface plasmons in magnetic nano-structures can strongly\ninfluence their magneto-optical properties. Here, we use photoemission electron\nmicroscopy to map the spatial distribution of the electric near-field on a\nnano-patterned magnetic surface that supports plasmon polaritons. By using\ndifferent photon energies and polarization states of the incident light we\nreveal that the electric near-field is either concentrated in spots forming a\nhexagonal lattice with the same symmetry as the Ni nano-pattern or in stripes\noriented along the $\\Gamma$-K direction of the lattice and perpendicular to the\npolarization direction. We show that the polarization-dependent near-field\nenhancement on the patterned surface is directly correlated to both the\nexcitation of surface plasmon polaritons on the patterned surface as well as\nthe enhancement of the polar magneto-optical Kerr effect.\n", "  Measurement-based quantum computation (MQC) is a paradigm for studying\nquantum computation using many-body entanglement and single-qubit measurements.\nWhile MQC has inspired wide-ranging discoveries throughout quantum information,\nour understanding of the general principles underlying MQC seems to be biased\nby its historical reliance upon the archetypal 2D cluster state. Here, we\nutilize recent advances in the subject of symmetry-protected topological order\n(SPTO) to introduce a novel MQC resource state, whose physical and\ncomputational behavior differs fundamentally from the cluster state. We show\nthat, in sharp contrast to the cluster state, our state enables universal\nquantum computation using only measurements of single-qubit Pauli X, Y, and Z\noperators. This novel computational feature is related to the \"genuine\" 2D SPTO\npossessed by our state, and which is absent in the cluster state. Our concrete\nconnection between the latent computational complexity of many-body systems and\nmacroscopic quantum orders may find applications in quantum many-body\nsimulation for benchmarking classically intractable complexity.\n", "  Bus transportation is considered as one of the most convenient and cheapest\nmodes of public transportation in Indian cities. Due to their\ncost-effectiveness and wide reachability, they help a significant portion of\nthe human population in cities to reach their destinations every day. Although\nfrom a transportation point of view they have numerous advantages over other\nmodes of public transportation, they also pose a serious threat of contagious\ndiseases spreading throughout the city. The presence of numerous local spatial\nconstraints makes the process and extent of epidemic spreading extremely\ndifficult to predict. Also, majority of the studies have focused on the\ncontagion processes on scale-free network topologies whereas,\nspatially-constrained real-world networks such as, bus networks exhibit a\nwide-spectrum of network topology. Therefore, we aim in this study to\nunderstand this complex dynamical process of epidemic outbreak and information\ndiffusion on the bus networks for six different Indian cities using SI and SIR\nmodels. This will allow us to identify epidemic thresholds for these networks\nwhich will help us in controlling outbreaks by developing node-based\nimmunization techniques.\n", "  Public opinion polling is usually done by random sampling from the entire\npopulation, treating individual opinions as independent. In the real world,\nindividuals' opinions are often correlated, e.g., among friends in a social\nnetwork. In this paper, we explore the idea of partitioned sampling, which\npartitions individuals with high opinion similarities into groups and then\nsamples every group separately to obtain an accurate estimate of the population\nopinion. We rigorously formulate the above idea as an optimization problem. We\nthen show that the simple partitions which contain only one sample in each\ngroup are always better, and reduce finding the optimal simple partition to a\nwell-studied Min-r-Partition problem. We adapt an approximation algorithm and a\nheuristic algorithm to solve the optimization problem. Moreover, to obtain\nopinion similarity efficiently, we adapt a well-known opinion evolution model\nto characterize social interactions, and provide an exact computation of\nopinion similarities based on the model. We use both synthetic and real-world\ndatasets to demonstrate that the partitioned sampling method results in\nsignificant improvement in sampling quality and it is robust when some opinion\nsimilarities are inaccurate or even missing.\n", "  Given that the simple wave equation of Brans-Dicke theory for the scalar\nfield is preserved, we have investigated, through exhaustively analyzing the\nBianchi identities, the consistent theories which violate the exact energy\nconservation equation. It is found that only three theories exist which are\nunambiguously determined from consistency, without imposing arbitrary functions\nby hand. Each of these theories possesses a specific interaction term which\ncontrols the energy exchange between the scalar field and ordinary matter. The\ntheories contain new parameters (integration constants from the integration\nprocedure) and when these are switched-off, Brans-Dicke theory emerges. As\nusually, the vacuum theories can be defined from the complete Brans-Dicke\ntheories when the matter energy-momentum tensor vanishes.\n", "  An important factor limiting our ability to understand the production and\npropagation of cosmic rays pertains to the effects of heliospheric forces,\ncommonly known as solar modulation. The solar wind is capable of generating\ntime and charge-dependent effects on the spectrum and intensity of low energy\n($\\lsim$ 10 GeV) cosmic rays reaching Earth. Previous analytic treatments of\nsolar modulation have utilized the force-field approximation, in which a simple\npotential is adopted whose amplitude is selected to best fit the cosmic-ray\ndata taken over a given period of time. Making use of recently available\ncosmic-ray data from the Voyager 1 spacecraft, along with measurements of the\nheliospheric magnetic field and solar wind, we construct a time, charge and\nrigidity-dependent model of solar modulation that can be directly compared to\ndata from a variety of cosmic-ray experiments. We provide a simple analytic\nformula that can be easily utilized in a variety of applications, allowing us\nto better predict the effects of solar modulation and reduce the number of free\nparameters involved in cosmic ray propagation models.\n", "  PageRank has numerous applications in information retrieval, reputation\nsystems, machine learning, and graph partitioning.In this paper, we study\nPageRank in undirected random graphs with expansion property. The Chung-Lu\nrandom graph representsan example of such graphs. We show that in the limit, as\nthe size of the graph goes to infinity, PageRank can be represented by a\nmixture of the restart distribution and the vertex degree distribution.\n", "  This precis is aimed as a practical field-guide to situations in which shear\nbanding might be expected in complex fluids subject to an applied shear flow.\nSeparately for several of the most common flow protocols, it summarises the\ncharacteristic signatures in the measured bulk rheological signals that suggest\nthe presence of banding in the underlying flow field. It does so both for a\nsteady applied shear flow, and for the time-dependent protocols of shear\nstartup, step stress, finite strain ramp, and large amplitude oscillatory\nshear. An important message is that banding might arise rather widely in flows\nwith a strong enough time-dependence, even in fluids that do not support\nbanding in a steadily applied shear flow. This suggests caution in comparing\nexperimental data with theoretical calculations that assume a homogeneous shear\nflow. In a brief postlude, we also summarise criteria in similar spirit for the\nonset of necking in extensional filament stretching.\n", "  For a closed system with periodic driving, Floquet theorem tells that the\ntime evolution operator can be written as $ U(t,0)\\equiv\nP(t)e^{\\frac{-i}{\\hbar}H_F t}$ with $P(t+T)=P(t)$, and $H_F$ is Hermitian and\ntime-independent called Floquet Hamiltonian. In this work, we extend the\nFloquet theorem from closed systems to open systems described by a Lindblad\nmaster equation that is periodic in time. Lindbladian expansion in powers of\n$\\frac 1 \\omega$ is derived, where $\\omega$ is the driving frequency. Two\nexamples are presented to illustrate the theory. We find that appropriate trace\npreserving time-independent Lindbladian of such a periodically driven system\ncan be constructed by the application of open system Floquet theory, and it\nagrees well with the exact dynamics in the high frequency limit.\n", "  Kubo formula gives a linear response of a quantum system to external fields,\nwhich are classical and weak with respect to the energy of the system. In this\nwork, we take the quantum nature of the external field into account, and define\na Hall conductance to characterize the linear response of a two-band system to\nthe quantized field. The theory is then applied to topological insulators.\nComparisons with the traditional Hall conductance are presented and discussed.\n", "  Recently, it was established that a two-dimensional electron system can arise\nat the interface between two oxide insulators LaAlO3 and SrTiO3. This\nparadigmatic example exhibits metallic behaviour and magnetic properties\nbetween non-magnetic and insulating oxides. Despite a huge amount of\ntheoretical and experimental work a thorough understanding has yet to be\nachieved. We analyzed the structural deformations of a LaAlO3 (001) slab\ninduced by hydrogen ad-atoms and oxygen vacancies at its surface by means of\ndensity functional theory. Moreover, we investigated the influence of surface\nreconstruction on the density of states and determined the change of the local\ndensity of states at the Fermi level with increasing distance from the surface\nfor bare LaAlO3 and for a conducting LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface. In addition, the\nAl-atom displacements and distortions of the TiO6-octahedra were estimated.\n", "  We studied 102 star forming regions in seven spiral galaxies (NGC 628, NGC\n783, NGC 2336, NGC 6217, NGC 6946, NGC 7331, and NGC 7678) on the basis of\ncomplex spectroscopic, photometric (UBVRI) and spectrophotometric (H alpha\nline) observations. Using data on the chemical composition and absorption in\nHII regions, obtained from spectroscopic observations, and using evolutionary\nmodels, we estimated physical parameters (ages and masses) of young stellar\ngroupings embedded in HII regions. We found that the gas extinction, A(gas),\nwhich determined from the Balmer decrement, does not correspond in some cases\nto the absorption A(stars) in the young stellar associations (complexes). This\nis due to the spatial offset relative HII cloud the stellar group related to\nhim. It has been found that the condition A(gas) = A(stars) does not satisfied\nfor the star forming regions, in which: 1) the contribution to the total\nemission of gas in the B and/or V bands is higher than 40%, and 2) EW(H alpha)\n> 1500A. Extinction A(V) in studied star forming regions corrected for the\nGalactic absorption A(V)Gal ranges from 0 to 3 mag with a mean value\nA(V)-A(V)Gal = 1.18+-0.84 mag. We estimated masses and ages for 63 star forming\nregions. The regions have ages from 1 to 10 Myr, the most part of them are\nyounger than 6 Myr. The derived masses of young stellar groupings range from\n10^4Msun in the nearby galaxies NGC 628 and NGC 6946 to 10^7Msun in the most\ndistant NGC 7678. More than 80% of groupings have masses between 10^5Msun and\n10^6Msun. The lowest mass estimate of 1x10^4Msun for the objects in NGC 628 and\nNGC 6946 belongs to the mass interval of the youngest Galactic open clusters.\n", "  In a Newtonian system with localized interactions the whole set of particles\nis naturally decomposed into dynamical clusters, defined as finite groups of\nparticles having an influence on each other's trajectory during a given\ninterval of time. For an ideal gas with short-range intermolecular force, we\nprovide a description of the cluster size distribution in terms of the reduced\nBoltzmann density. In the simplified context of Maxwell molecules, we show that\na macroscopic fraction of the gas forms a giant component in finite kinetic\ntime. The critical index of this phase transition is in agreement with previous\nnumerical results on the elastic billiard.\n", "  Lorentz-violating type-II Weyl fermions, which were missed in Weyl's\nprediction of nowadays classified type-I Weyl fermions in quantum field theory,\nhave recently been proposed in condensed matter systems. The semimetals hosting\ntype-II Weyl fermions offer a rare platform for realizing many exotic physical\nphenomena that are different from type-I Weyl systems. Here we construct the\nacoustic version of type-II Weyl Hamiltonian by stacking one-dimensional\ndimerized chains of acoustic resonators. This acoustic type-II Weyl system\nexhibits distinct features in finite density of states and unique transport\nproperties of Fermi-arc-like surface states. In a certain momentum space\ndirection, the velocity of these surface states are determined by the tilting\ndirection of the type-II Weyl nodes, rather than the chirality dictated by the\nChern number. Our study also provides an approach of constructing acoustic\ntopological phases at different dimensions with the same building blocks.\n", "  Electronic and optical properties of silver clusters were calculated using\ntwo different \\textit{ab initio} approaches: 1) based on all-electron\nfull-potential linearized-augmented plane-wave method and 2) local basis\nfunction pseudopotential approach. Agreement is found between the two methods\nfor small and intermediate sized clusters for which the former method is\nlimited due to its all-electron formulation. The latter, due to non-periodic\nboundary conditions, is the more natural approach to simulate small clusters.\nThe effect of cluster size is then explored using the local basis function\napproach. We find that as the cluster size increases, the electronic structure\nundergoes a transition from molecular behavior to nanoparticle behavior at a\ncluster size of 140 atoms (diameter $\\sim 1.7$\\,nm). Above this cluster size\nthe step-like electronic structure, evident as several features in the\nimaginary part of the polarizability of all clusters smaller than\nAg$_\\mathrm{147}$, gives way to a dominant plasmon peak localized at\nwavelengths 350\\,nm$\\le\\lambda\\le$ 600\\,nm. It is, thus, at this length-scale\nthat the conduction electrons' collective oscillations that are responsible for\nplasmonic resonances begin to dominate the opto-electronic properties of silver\nnanoclusters.\n", "  Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have become popular in materials science,\nbiochemistry, biophysics and several other fields. Improvements in\ncomputational resources, in quality of force field parameters and algorithms\nhave yielded significant improvements in performance and reliability. On the\nother hand, no method of research is error free. In this review, we discuss a\nfew examples of errors and artifacts due to various sources and discuss how to\navoid them. Besides bringing attention to artifacts and proper practices in\nsimulations, we also aim to provide the reader with a starting point to explore\nthese issues further. In particular, we hope that the discussion encourages\nresearchers to check software, parameters, protocols and, most importantly,\ntheir own practices in order to minimize the possibility of errors. The focus\nhere is on practical issues.\n", "  We study the late-time relaxation following a quench in a driven-dissipative\nquantum many-body system. We consider the open Dicke model, describing the\ninfinite-range interactions between $N$ atoms and a single, lossy\nelectromagnetic mode. We show that the dynamical phase transition at a critical\natom-light coupling is characterized by the interplay between reservoir-driven\nand intrinsic relaxation processes. Above the critical coupling, small\nfluctuations in the occupation of the dominant quasiparticle-mode start to grow\nin time while the quasiparticle lifetime remains finite due to losses. Near the\ncritical interaction strength we observe a crossover between exponential and\npower-law $1/\\tau$ relaxation, the latter driven by collisions between\nquasiparticles. For a quench exactly to the critical coupling, the power-law\nrelaxation extends to infinite times, but the finite lifetime of quasiparticles\nprevents ageing to appear. We predict our results to be accessible to quench\nexperiments with ultracold bosons in optical resonators.\n", "  Thermodynamic formalism for rotating black holes, characterized by\nnoncommutative and quantum corrections, is constructed. From a fundamental\nthermodynamic relation, equations of state and thermodynamic response functions\nare explicitly given and the effect of noncommutativity and quantum correction\nis discussed. It is shown that the well known divergence exhibited in specific\nheat is not removed by any of these corrections. However, regions of\nthermodynamic stability are affected by noncommutativity, increasing the\navailable states for which some thermodynamic stability conditions are\nsatisfied.\n", "  Recent work suggests that a sharp definition of `phase of matter' can be\ngiven for periodically driven `Floquet' quantum systems exhibiting many-body\nlocalization. In this work we propose a classification of the phases of\ninteracting Floquet localized systems with (completely) spontaneously broken\nsymmetries -- we focus on the one dimensional case, but our results appear to\ngeneralize to higher dimensions. We find that the different Floquet phases\ncorrespond to elements of $Z(G)$, the centre of the symmetry group in question.\nIn a previous paper we offered a companion classification of unbroken, i.e.,\nparamagnetic phases.\n", "  Fractional quantum Hall liquids exhibit a rich set of excitations, the\nlowest-energy of which are the magnetorotons with dispersion minima at a finite\nmomentum. We propose a theory of the magnetorotons on the quantum Hall plateaux\nnear half filling, namely, at filling fractions $\\nu=N/(2N+1)$ at large $N$.\nThe theory involves an infinite number of bosonic fields arising from\nbosonizing the fluctuations of the shape of the composite Fermi surface. At\nzero momentum there are $O(N)$ neutral excitations, each carrying a\nwell-defined spin that runs integer values $2,3,\\ldots$. The mixing of modes at\nnonzero momentum $q$ leads to the characteristic bending down of the lowest\nexcitation and the appearance of the magnetoroton minima. A purely algebraic\nargument shows that the magnetoroton minima are located at\n$q\\ell_B=z_i/(2N+1)$, where $\\ell_B$ is the magnetic length and $z_i$ are the\nzeros of the Bessel function $J_1$, independent of the microscopic details. We\nargue that these minima are universal features of any two-dimensional Fermi\nsurface coupled to a gauge field in a small background magnetic field.\n", "  The discovery of graphene, a single monolayer of graphite, has closed the\ndiscussion on stability of 2D crystals. Although thermal fluctuations of such\ncrystals tend to destroy the long-range order in the system, the crystal can be\nstabilized by strong anharmonicity effects. This competition is the central\nissue of the crumpling transition, i.e., a transition between flat and crumpled\nphases. We show that anharmonicity-controlled fluctuations of a graphene\nmembrane around equilibrium flat phase lead to unusual elastic properties. In\nparticular, we demonstrate that stretching $\\xi$ of a flake of graphene is a\nnonlinear function of the applied tension at small tension:\n${\\xi\\propto\\sigma^{\\eta/(2-\\eta)}}$ and ${\\xi\\propto\\sigma^{\\eta/(8-\\eta)}}$\nfor clean and strongly disordered graphene, respectively. Conventional linear\nHooke's law, ${\\xi\\propto\\sigma}$ is realized at sufficiently large tensions:\n${\\sigma\\gg\\sigma_*},$ where $\\sigma_*$ depends both on temperature and on the\ndisorder strength.\n", "  Quasi-Exactly Solvable Schr\\\"odinger Equations occupy an intermediate place\nbetween exactly-solvable (e.g. the harmonic oscillator and Coulomb problems\netc) and non-solvable ones. Their major property is an explicit knowledge of\nseveral eigenstates while the remaining ones are unknown. Many of these\nproblems are of the anharmonic oscillator type with a special type of\nanharmonicity. The Hamiltonians of quasi-exactly-solvable problems are\ncharacterized by the existence of a hidden algebraic structure but do not have\nany hidden symmetry properties. In particular, all known one-dimensional\n(quasi)-exactly-solvable problems possess a hidden $\\mathfrak{sl}(2,\\bf{R})-$\nLie algebra. They are equivalent to the $\\mathfrak{sl}(2,\\bf{R})$ Euler-Arnold\nquantum top in a constant magnetic field. Quasi-Exactly Solvable problems are\nhighly non-trivial, they shed light on delicate analytic properties of the\nSchr\\\"odinger Equations in coupling constant. The Lie-algebraic formalism\nallows us to make a link between the Schr\\\"odinger Equations and\nfinite-difference equations on uniform and/or exponential lattices, it implies\nthat the spectra is preserved. This link takes the form of quantum canonical\ntransformation. The corresponding isospectral spectral problems for\nfinite-difference operators are described. The underlying Fock space formalism\ngiving rise to this correspondence is uncovered. For a quite general class of\nperturbations of unperturbed problems with the hidden Lie algebra property we\ncan construct an algebraic perturbation theory, where the wavefunction\ncorrections are of polynomial nature, thus, can be found by algebraic means.\n", "  We show that some modern geometric methods of Hamiltonian dynamics can be\ndirectly applied to the nonholonomic Heisenberg type systems. As an example we\npresent characteristic Killing tensors, compatible Poisson brackets, Lax\nmatrices and classical $r$-matrices for the conformally Hamiltonian vector\nfields obtained in a process of reduction of Hamiltonian vector fields by a\nnonholonomic constraint associated with the Heisenberg system.\n", "  Brain research has been driven by enquiry for principles of brain structure\norganization and its control mechanisms. The neuronal wiring map of C. elegans,\nthe only complete connectome available till date, presents an incredible\nopportunity to learn basic governing principles that drive structure and\nfunction of its neuronal architecture. Despite its apparently simple nervous\nsystem, C. elegans is known to possess complex functions. The neuronal\narchitecture forms an important underlying framework which specifies phenotypic\nfeatures associated to sensation, movement, conditioning and memory. In this\nstudy, with the help of graph theoretical models, we investigated the C.\nelegans neuronal network to identify network features that are critical for its\ncontrol. The 'driver neurons' are associated with important biological\nfunctions such as reproduction, signalling processes and anatomical structural\ndevelopment. We created 1D and 2D network models of C. elegans neuronal system\nto probe the role of features that confer controllability and small world\nnature. The simple 1D ring model is critically poised for the number of feed\nforward motifs, neuronal clustering and characteristic path-length in response\nto synaptic rewiring, indicating optimal rewiring. Using empirically observed\ndistance constraint in the neuronal network as a guiding principle, we created\na distance constrained synaptic plasticity model that simultaneously explains\nsmall world nature, saturation of feed forward motifs as well as observed\nnumber of driver neurons. The distance constrained model suggests optimum long\ndistance synaptic connections as a key feature specifying control of the\nnetwork.\n", "  The interplay of membrane proteins is vital for many biological processes,\nsuch as cellular transport, cell division, and signal transduction between\nnerve cells. Theoretical considerations have led to the idea that the membrane\nitself mediates protein self-organization in these processes through\nminimization of membrane curvature energy. Here, we present a combined\nexperimental and numerical study in which we quantify these interactions\ndirectly for the first time. In our experimental model system we control the\ndeformation of a lipid membrane by adhering colloidal particles. Using confocal\nmicroscopy, we establish that these membrane deformations cause an attractive\ninteraction force leading to reversible binding. The attraction extends over\n2.5 times the particle diameter and has a strength of three times the thermal\nenergy (-3.3 kT). Coarse-grained Monte-Carlo simulations of the system are in\nexcellent agreement with the experimental results and prove that the measured\ninteraction is independent of length scale. Our combined experimental and\nnumerical results reveal membrane curvature as a common physical origin for\ninteractions between any membrane-deforming objects, from nanometre-sized\nproteins to micrometre-sized particles.\n", "  We theoretically study a spin Hamiltonian for spin-orbit-coupled ferromagnets\non the honeycomb lattice. We find that the effective Hamiltonian for magnons, a\nquanta of spin-wave excitations from ordered states, is equivalent to the\nHaldane model for electrons in the honeycomb lattice, which indicates the\nnontrivial topology of the magnon bands and the existence of the associated\nedge state. We also take the Schwinger boson (or bosonic spinon)\nrepresentations of spins that are applicable both to ordered and disordered\nphases. We show that the spinon bands within the mean-field treatment are\ntopologically nontrivial, which causes a spin Nernst effect, by adopting the\nproperties of the Kane-Mele model. A feasible experimental realization of the\nspin Hamiltonian is proposed.\n", "  The interaction of intense laser pulses with nano-scale particles leads to\nthe production of high-energy electrons, ions, neutral atoms, neutrons and\nphotons. Up to now, investigations have focused on near-infrared to X-ray laser\npulses consisting of many optical cycles. Here we study strong-field ionization\nof rare-gas clusters ($10^3$ to $10^5$ atoms) using two-cycle 1.8~$\\mu$m laser\npulses to access a new interaction regime in the limit where the electron\ndynamics are dominated by the laser field and the cluster atoms do not have\ntime to move significantly. The emission of fast electrons with kinetic\nenergies exceeding 3keV is observed using laser pulses with a wavelength of\n1.8~$\\mu$m and an intensity of $1\\times 10^{15}$~W/cm$^2$, whereas only\nelectrons below 500eV are observed at 800nm using a similar intensity and pulse\nduration. Fast electrons are preferentially emitted along the laser\npolarization direction, showing that they are driven out from the cluster by\nthe laser field. In addition to direct electron emission, an electron\nrescattering plateau is observed. Scaling to even longer wavelengths is\nexpected to result in a highly directional current of energetic electrons on a\nfew-femtosecond timescale.\n", "  Simmering debates leading to polarization are observed in many domains.\nAlthough empirical findings show a strong correlation between this phenomenon\nand modularity of a social network, still little is known about the actual\nmechanisms driving communities to conflicting opinions. In this paper, we used\nan agent-based model to check if the polarization may be induced by a\ncompetition between two types of social response: conformity and\nanticonformity. The proposed model builds on the q-voter model (Castellano et\nal. 2009b) and uses a double-clique topology in order to capture segmentation\nof a community. Our results indicate that the interplay between intra-clique\nconformity and inter-clique anticonformity may indeed lead to a polarized state\nof the entire system. We have found a dynamic phase transition controlled by\nthe fraction $L$ of cross-links between cliques. In the regime of small values\nof $L$ system is able to reach the total positive consensus. If the values of\n$L$ are large enough, anticonformity takes over and the system always ends up\nin a polarized stated. Putting it the other way around, the segmentation of the\nnetwork is not a sufficient condition for the polarization to appear. A\nsuitable level of antagonistic interactions between segments is namely required\nto arrive at a polarized steady state within our model.\n", "  We demonstrate a novel scheme to generate frequency-entangled qudits with\ndimension number higher than 10 and to distribute them over optical fibers of\n15 km in total length. This scheme combines the technique of spectral\nengineering of biphotons generated by spontaneous parametric down-conversion\nand the technique of spectrally resolved Hong-Ou-Mandel interference. We\ncharacterized the comb-like spectral correlation structures of the qudits by\ntime of arrival measurement and correlated spectral intensity measurement. The\ngeneration and distribution of the distinct entangled frequency modes may be\nuseful for quantum cryptography, quantum metrology, quantum remote\nsynchronization, as well as fundamental test of stronger violation of local\nrealism.\n", "  Distinct works have claimed that spatial (quenched) disorder can suppress the\ndiscontinuous absorbing phase transitions. Conversely, the scenario for\ntemporal disorder for discontinuous absorbing phase transitions is unknown. In\norder to shed some light in this direction, we tackle its effect in three\nbidimensional examples, presenting undoubtedly discontinuous absorbing phase\ntransitions. Except in one case (to be explained further), the temporal\ndisorder is introduced by allowing the control parameter to be time dependent\n$p\\rightarrow p(t)$ according to a uniform distribution of mean $p_0$ and width\n$\\sigma$, in which at the emergence of the phase transition the system transits\nbetween active and absorbing regimes. In contrast to the spatial disorder,\nnumerical results strongly suggest that temporal disorder does not forbid the\nexistence of discontinuous transition. All cases are signed by behaviors\nsimilar to their pure (without disorder) counterparts, including bistability\naround the coexistence point and common finite size scaling behavior with the\ninverse of the system volume, as recently proposed in Phys. Rev. E. {\\bf 92},\n062126 (2015). We also observe that temporal disorder does not induce temporal\nGriffiths phases around phase transitions, at least for $d=2$.\n", "  The D0 Collaboration has recently seen a resonant-like peak in the $B_s\\pi$\ninvariant mass spectrum, claimed to be a new state called $X(5568)$. Using a\n$B_s\\pi$--$B\\bar{K}$ coupled channel analysis, implementing unitarity, and with\nthe interaction derived from Heavy Meson Chiral Perturbation Theory, we are\nable to reproduce the reported spectrum, with a pole that can be associated to\nthe claimed $X(5568)$ state, and with mass and width in agreement with the ones\nreported in the experimental analysis. However, if the $T$-matrix\nregularization is performed by means of a momentum cutoff, the value for the\nlatter needed to reproduce the spectrum is $\\Lambda = 2.80 \\pm 0.04\\\n\\text{GeV}$, much larger than a \"natural\" value $\\Lambda \\simeq 1\\ \\text{GeV}$.\nIn view of this, it is difficult to interpret the nature of this new state.\nThis state would not qualify as a resonance dynamically generated by the\nunitarity loops. Assuming the observed peak to correspond to a physical state,\nwe make predictions for partners in the $D$, $D^\\ast$, and $B^\\ast$ sectors.\nTheir observation (or lack thereof) would shed light into this issue.\n", "  Ab initio calculations provide direct access to the properties of pure\nneutron systems that are challenging to study experimentally. In addition to\ntheir importance for fundamental physics, their properties are required as\ninput for effective field theories of the strong interaction. In this work, we\nperform auxiliary-field diffusion Monte Carlo calculations of the ground and\nfirst excited state of two neutrons in a finite box, considering a simple\ncontact potential as well as chiral effective field theory interactions. We\ncompare the results against exact diagonalizations and present a detailed\nanalysis of the finite-volume effects, whose understanding is crucial for\ndetermining observables from the calculated energies. Using the L\\\"uscher\nformula, we extract the low-energy S-wave scattering parameters from ground-\nand excited-state energies for different box sizes.\n", "  The $R+R^2$, shortly named \"$R^2$\" (\"Starobinsky\") inflationary model,\nrepresents a fully consistent example of a one-parameter inflationary scenario.\nThis model has a \"graceful exit\" from inflation and provides a mechanism for\nsubsequent creation and final thermalization of the standard matter. Moreover,\nit produces a very good fit of the observed spectrum of primordial\nperturbations. In the present paper we show explicitly that the $R^2$\ninflationary spacetime is an exact solution of a range of weakly non-local\n(quasi-polynomial) gravitational theories, which provide an ultraviolet\ncompletion of the $R^2$ theory. These theories are ghost-free,\nsuper-renormalizable or finite at quantum level, and perturbatively unitary.\nTheir spectrum consists of the graviton and the scalaron that is responsible\nfor driving the inflation. Notably, any further extension of the spectrum leads\nto propagating ghost degrees of freedom. We are aimed at presenting a detailed\nconstruction of such theories in the so called Weyl basis. Further, we give a\nspecial account to the cosmological implications of this theory by considering\nperturbations during inflation. The highlight of the non-local model is the\nprediction of a modified, in comparison to a local $R^2$ model, value for the\nratio of tensor and scalar power spectra $r$, depending on the parameters of\nthe theory. The relevant parameters are under control to be successfully\nconfronted with existing observational data. Furthermore, the modified $r$ can\nsurely meet future observational constraints.\n", "  Saturation overshoot and pressure overshoot are studied by incorporating\ndynamic capillary pressure, capillary pressure hysteresis and hysteretic\ndynamic coefficient with a traditional fractional flow equation in one\ndimension. Using the method of lines, the discretizations are constructed by\napplying Castillo-Grone's mimetic operators in the space direction and explicit\ntrapezoidal integrator in the time direction. Convergence tests and\nconservation property of the schemes are presented. Computed profiles capture\nboth the saturation overshoot and pressure overshoot phenomena. Comparisons\nbetween numerical results and experiments illustrate the effectiveness and\ndifferent features of the models.\n", "  We investigate a variant of the Aubry-Andr\\'e-Harper (AAH) model\ncorresponding to a bosonic optical lattice of ultra cold atoms under an\neffective oscillatory magnetic field. In the limit of high frequency\noscillation, the system maybe approximated by an effective time independent\nHamiltonian. We have studied localization/delocalization transition exhibited\nby the effective Hamiltonian. The effective Hamiltonian is found to retain the\ntight binding tri-diagonal form in position space. In a striking contrast to\nthe usual AAH model, this non-dual system shows an energy dependent mobility\nedge - a feature which is usually reminiscent of Hamiltonians with beyond the\nnearest neighbour hoppings in real space. Finally, we discuss possibilities of\nexperimentally realizing this system in optical lattices.\n", "  The icosahedron has a ground state magnetization discontinuity in an external\nmagnetic field when classical spins mounted on its vertices are coupled\naccording to the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model. This is so even if there\nis no magnetic anisotropy in the Hamiltonian. The discontinuity is a\nconsequence of the frustrated nature of the interactions, which originates in\nthe topology of the cluster. Here it is found that the addition of the next\norder isotropic spin exchange interaction term in the Hamiltonian, the\nbiquadratic exchange interaction, significantly enriches the classical ground\nstate magnetic response. For relatively weak biquadratic interaction new\ndiscontinuities emerge, while for even stronger the number of discontinuities\nfor this small molecule can go up to seven, accompanied by a susceptibility\ndiscontinuity. These results demonstrate the possibility of using a small\nentity like the icosahedron as a magnetic unit whose ground state spin\nconfiguration and magnetization can be tuned between many different\nnon-overlapping regimes with the application of an external field.\n", "  The endeavour to develop quantum networks gave rise to a rapidly developing\nfield with far reaching applications such as secure communication and the\nrealisation of distributed computing tasks. This ultimately calls for the\ncreation of flexible multi-user structures that allow for quantum communication\nbetween arbitrary pairs of parties in the network and facilitate also\nmulti-user applications. To address this challenge, we propose a 2D quantum\nrepeater architecture to establish long-distance entanglement shared between\nmultiple communication partners in the presence of channel noise and imperfect\nlocal control operations. The scheme is based on the creation of self-similar\nmulti-qubit entanglement structures at growing scale, where variants of\nentanglement swapping and multi-party entanglement purification are combined to\ncreate high fidelity entangled states. We show how such networks can be\nimplemented using trapped ions in cavities.\n", "  In this paper, the concept of cross-correlation Green's functions (CGF) is\nused in conjunction with the finite difference time domain (FDTD) technique for\ncalculation of envelope correlation coefficient (ECC) of any arbitrary MIMO\nantenna system over wide frequency band. Both frequency-domain (FD) and\ntime-domain (TD) post-processing techniques are proposed for possible\napplication with this FDTD-CGF scheme. The FDTD-CGF time-domain (FDTD-CGF-TD)\nscheme utilizes time-domain signal processing methods and exhibits significant\nreduction in ECC computation time as compared to the FDTD-CGF frequency domain\n(FDTD-CGF-FD) scheme, for high frequency-resolution requirements. The proposed\nFDTD-CGF based schemes can be applied for accurate and fast prediction of\nwideband ECC response, instead of the conventional scattering parameter based\ntechniques which have several limitations. Numerical examples of the proposed\nFDTD-CGF techniques are provided for two-element MIMO systems involving\nthin-wire half-wavelength dipoles in parallel side-by-side as well as\northogonal arrangements. The results obtained from the FDTD-CGF techniques are\ncompared with results from commercial electromagnetic solver Ansys HFSS, to\nverify the validity of proposed approach.\n", "  Systems with the power-law quasiparticle dispersion $\\epsilon_{\\bf k}\\propto\nk^\\alpha$ exhibit non-Anderson disorder-driven transitions in dimensions\n$d>2\\alpha$, as exemplified by Weyl semimetals, 1D and 2D arrays of ultracold\nions with long-range interactions, quantum kicked rotors and semiconductor\nmodels in high dimensions. We study the wavefunction structure in such systems\nand demonstrate that at these transitions they exhibit fractal behaviour with\nan infinite set of multifractal exponents. The multifractality persists even\nwhen the wavefunction localisation is forbidden by symmetry or topology and\noccurs as a result of elastic scattering between all momentum states in the\nband on length scales shorter than the mean free path. We calculate explicitly\nthe multifractal spectra in semiconductors and Weyl semimetals using one-loop\nand two-loop renormalisation-group approaches slightly above the marginal\ndimension $d=2\\alpha$.\n", "  Based on the Isospin-dependent transport model Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck\n(IBUU), effects of the high momentum tail (HMT) of nucleon momentum\ndistribution in colliding nuclei on some isospin-sensitive observables are\nstudied in the semi-central $^{197}\\rm {Au}+^{197}\\rm {Au}$ reactions at\nincident beam energy of 400 MeV/nucleon. It is found that the nucleon\ntransverse flow, the difference of neutron and proton transverse flows, the\nnucleon elliptic flow and free neutron to proton ratio are all less sensitive\nto the HMT, while the isospin-sensitive nucleon elliptic flow difference is\nclearly affected by the HMT. Except at very high kinetic energies, the kinetic\nenergy distributions of $\\pi^{-}$, $\\pi^{+}$ and charged pion ratio\n$\\pi^{-}/\\pi^{+}$ are all sensitive to the HMT.\n", "  A practical approach to protecting networks against epidemic processes such\nas spreading of infectious diseases, malware, and harmful viral information is\nto remove some influential nodes beforehand to fragment the network into small\ncomponents. Because determining the optimal order to remove nodes is a\ncomputationally hard problem, various approximate algorithms have been proposed\nto efficiently fragment networks by sequential node removal. Morone and Makse\nproposed an algorithm employing the non-backtracking matrix of given networks,\nwhich outperforms various existing algorithms. In fact, many empirical networks\nhave community structure, compromising the assumption of local tree-like\nstructure on which the original algorithm is based. We develop an immunization\nalgorithm by synergistically combining the Morone-Makse algorithm and coarse\ngraining of the network in which we regard a community as a supernode. In this\nway, we aim to identify nodes that connect different communities at a\nreasonable computational cost. The proposed algorithm works more efficiently\nthan the Morone-Makse and other algorithms on networks with community\nstructure.\n", "  In this work, we propose different models of extended theories of gravity,\nwhich are minimally coupled to the SM fields, to explain the possibility of a\ndark matter (DM) candidate, without ad-hoc additions to the Standard Model\n(SM). We modify the gravity sector by allowing quantum corrections motivated\nfrom local $f(R)$ gravity, and non-minimally coupled gravity with SM sector and\ndilaton field. Using an effective field theory (EFT) framework, we constrain\nthe scale of the EFT and DM mass. We consider two cases-Light DM (LDM) and\nHeavy DM (HDM), and deduce upper bounds on the DM annihilation cross section to\nSM particles.\n", "  A statistical approach based on the Weisskopf evaporation theory has been\ndeveloped to describe the de-excitation process of highly excited heavy and\nsuperheavy nuclei, in particular for the proton-rich nuclei. The excited\nnucleus is cooled by evaporating $\\gamma$-ray, light particles (neutrons,\nprotons, $\\alpha$ etc) in competition with the binary fission, in which the\nstructure effects (shell correction, fission barrier, particle separation\nenergy) contribute to the processes. The formation of residual nuclei is\nevaluated via sequential emission of possible particles above the separation\nenergies. The available data of fusion-evaporation excitation functions in the\n$^{28}$Si+$^{198}$Pt reaction can be reproduced nicely well within the\napproach.\n", "  Removing exactly one photon from an arbitrary input pulse is an elementary\noperation in quantum optics and enables applications in quantum information\nprocessing and quantum simulation. Here we demonstrate a deterministic\nsingle-photon absorber based on the saturation of an optically thick free-space\nmedium by a single photon due to Rydberg blockade. Single-photon subtraction\nadds a new component to the Rydberg quantum optics toolbox, which already\ncontains photonic logic building-blocks such as single-photon sources,\nswitches, transistors, and conditional $\\pi$-phase shifts. Our approach is\nscalable to multiple cascaded absorbers, essential for preparation of\nnon-classical light states for quantum information and metrology applications,\nand, in combination with the single-photon transistor, high-fidelity\nnumber-resolved photon detection.\n", "  We present a general framework for studying strongly coupled radiative and\nconductive heat transfer between arbitrarily shaped bodies separated by\nsub-wavelength distances. Our formulation is based on a macroscopic approach\nthat couples our recent fluctuating volume--current (FVC) method of near-field\nheat transfer to the more well known Fourier conduction transport equation. We\napply our technique to consider heat exchange between aluminum-zinc oxide\nnanorods and show that the presence of bulk plasmon resonances can result in\nextremely large radiative heat transfer rates (roughly twenty times larger than\nobserved in planar geometries), whose interplay with conductive transport leads\nto nonlinear temperature profiles along the nanorods.\n", "  The calculation of the mass of light scalar isosinglet meson within the\nShifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov (SVZ) sum rules is revisited. We develop simple\nanalytical methods for estimation of hadron masses in the SVZ approach and try\nto reveal the origin of their numerical values. The calculations of hadron\nparameters in the SVZ sum rules are known to be heavily based on a choice of\nthe perturbative threshold. This choice requires some important ad hoc\ninformation. We show analytically that the scalar mass under consideration has\na lower and upper bound which are independent of this choice: $0.78\\lesssim\nm_s\\lesssim1.28$ GeV.\n", "  The paper addresses the question if there exists a finite stopping time for\nan unforced motion of a yield stress fluid with free surface. A variation\ninequality formulation is deduced for the problem of yield stress fluid\ndynamics with a free surface. Free surface is assumed to evolve with a normal\nvelocity the flow. We also consider capillary forces acting along the free\nsurface. Based on the variational inequality formulation an energy equality is\nobtained, where kinetic and free energy rate of change is in a balance with the\ninternal energy viscoplastic dissipation and the work of external forces.\nFurther, the paper considers free small-amplitude oscillations of a droplet of\nHerschel-Bulkley fluid under the action of surface tension forces. Under\ncertain assumptions it is shown that the finite stopping time $T_f$ of\noscillations exists once the yield stress parameter is positive and the flow\nindex $\\alpha$ satisfies ($\\alpha\\ge1$). Results of several numerical\nexperiments illustrate the analysis, reveal the dependence of $T_f$ on problem\nparameters and suggest an instantaneous transition of the whole drop from\nyielding state to the rigid one.\n", "  We consider the non-equilibrium time evolution of piecewise homogeneous\nstates in the XXZ spin-1/2 chain, a paradigmatic example of an interacting\nintegrable model. The initial state can be thought as the result of joining\nchains with different global properties. Through dephasing, at late times the\nstate becomes locally equivalent to a stationary state which explicitly depends\non position and time. We propose a kinetic theory of elementary excitations and\nderive a continuity equation which fully characterizes the thermodynamics of\nthe model. We restrict ourselves to the gapless phase and consider cases where\nthe chains are prepared: 1) at different temperatures; 2) in the ground state\nof two different models; 3) in the \"domain wall\" state. We find excellent\nagreement (any discrepancy is within the numerical error) between theoretical\npredictions and numerical simulations of time evolution based on TEBD\nalgorithms. As a corollary, we unveil an exact expression for the expectation\nvalues of the charge currents in a generic stationary state.\n", "  Non-gravitational feedback affects the nature of the intra-cluster medium\n(ICM). X-ray cooling of the ICM and in situ energy feedback from AGN's and SNe\nas well as {\\it preheating} of the gas at epochs preceding the formation of\nclusters are proposed mechanisms for such feedback. While cooling and AGN\nfeedbacks are dominant in cluster cores, the signatures of a preheated ICM are\nexpected to be present even at large radii. To estimate the degree of\npreheating, with minimum confusion from AGN feedback/cooling, we study the\nexcess entropy and non-gravitational energy profiles upto $r_{200}$ for a\nsample of 17 galaxy clusters using joint data sets of {\\it Planck} SZ pressure\nand {\\it ROSAT/PSPC} gas density profiles. The canonical value of preheating\nentropy floor of $\\gtrsim 300$ keV cm$^2$, needed in order to match cluster\nscalings, is ruled out at $\\approx 3\\sigma$. We also show that the feedback\nenergy of 1 keV/particle is ruled out at 5.2$\\sigma$ beyond $r_{500}$. Our\nanalysis takes both non-thermal pressure and clumping into account which can be\nimportant in outer regions. Our results based on the direct probe of the ICM in\nthe outermost regions do not support any significant preheating.\n", "  Studies on neutrino-nucleon ($\\nu N$) cross sections at different energy\nscales have regained interest due to increasing importance of precision\nmeasurements, as they are needed as an ingredient in all neutrino experiments.\nIn this paper we have calculated both charged current (CC) and neutral current\n(NC) $\\nu$N scattering cross sections at Ultra High Energy (UHE) regime in the\nneutrino energy ($E_{\\nu}$) region i.e. $10^{9} GeV \\le E_{\\nu} \\le 10^{12}$\nGeV using QCD inspired double asymptotic limit fit of electron-proton structure\nfunction $F_{2}^{ep}$ to low $\\mathit{x}$ HERA data. The form $F_{2}^{ep} \\sim\nx^{-\\lambda(Q^{2})}$ used in our analysis, can be conjectured like a dynamic\npomeron (DP)-type behaviour. We also find an analytic form of the total cross\nsections, $\\sigma_{CC}^{\\nu N}$ and $\\sigma_{NC}^{\\nu N}$ which appear to be of\nhard-pomeron exchange types. A comparative analysis of our results with those\navailable in literature is also done. An improved understanding of $\\nu N$\ninteractions at UHE are essentially important for future oscillation\nexperiments. Future measurements will support/confront our predictions.\n\\textbf{Keywords}: Neutrino cross section, Ultra High Energy, QCD, Double\nAsymptotic limit, dynamic pomeron, hard-pomeron.\n", "  Electronically driven nematic order is often considered as an essential\ningredient of high-temperature superconductivity. Its elusive nature in\niron-based supercon- ductors resulted in a controversy not only as regards its\norigin but also as to the degree of its influence on the electronic structure\neven in the simplest representative material FeSe. Here we utilized\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory\ncalculations to study the influence of the nematic order on the electronic\nstructure of FeSe and determine its exact energy and momentum scales. Our\nresults strongly suggest that the nematicity in FeSe is electronically driven,\nwe resolve the recent controversy and provide the necessary quantitative\nexperimental basis for a successful theory of superconductivity in iron-based\nmaterials which takes into account both, spin-orbit interaction and electronic\nnematicity.\n", "  The hierarchical product of two graphs represents a natural way to build a\nlarger graph out of two smaller graphs with less regular and therefore more\nheterogeneous structure than the Cartesian product. Here we study the\neigenvalue spectrum of the adjacency matrix of the hierarchical product of two\ngraphs. Introducing a coupling parameter describing the relative contribution\nof each of the two smaller graphs, we perform an asymptotic analysis for the\nfull spectrum of eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of the hierarchical\nproduct. Specifically, we derive the exact limit points for each eigenvalue in\nthe limits of small and large coupling, as well as the leading-order relaxation\nto these values in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the two smaller\ngraphs. Given its central roll in the structural and dynamical properties of\nnetworks, we study in detail the Perron-Frobenius, or largest, eigenvalue.\nFinally, as an example application we use our theory to predict the epidemic\nthreshold of the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible model on a hierarchical\nproduct of two graphs.\n", "  The self-couplings of the electroweak gauge bosons are completely specified\nby the non-Abelian gauge nature of the Standard Model (SM). The direct study of\nthese couplings provides a significant opportunity to test the validity of the\nSM and the existence of new physics beyond the SM up to the high energy scale.\nFor this reason, we investigate the potential of the processes\n$\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow ZZ$, $e^{-}\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{-}\\gamma^{*}\\gamma\n\\rightarrow e^{-}Z\\, Z$ and $e^{+}e^{-} \\rightarrow e^{+}\\gamma^{*} \\gamma^{*}\ne^{-} \\rightarrow e^{+}\\, Z\\, Z\\, e^{-}$ to examine the anomalous quartic\ncouplings of $ZZ\\gamma\\gamma$ vertex at the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) with\ncenter-of-mass energy $3$ TeV. We calculate $95\\%$ confidence level\nsensitivities on the dimension-8 parameters with various values of the\nintegrated luminosity. We show that the best bounds on the anomalous\n$\\frac{f_{M2}}{\\Lambda^{4}}$, $\\frac{f_{M3}}{\\Lambda^{4}}$,\n$\\frac{f_{T0}}{\\Lambda^4}$ and $\\frac{f_{T9}}{\\Lambda^4}$ couplings arise from\n$\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow ZZ$ process among those three processes at\ncenter-of-mass energy of 3 TeV and integrated luminosity of $L_{int}=2000$\nfb$^{-1}$ are found to be $[-3.30;3.30]\\times 10 ^{-3}$ TeV$^{-4}$,\n$[-1.20;1.20]\\times 10 ^{-2}$ TeV$^{-4}$, $[-3.40;3.40]\\times 10 ^{-3}$\nTeV$^{-4}$ and $[-1.80;1.80]\\times 10 ^{-3}$ TeV$^{-4}$, respectively.\n", "  A modern version of the idea that the area of event horizons gives $4G$ times\nan entropy is the Hubeny-Rangamani Causal Holographic Information (CHI)\nproposal for holographic field theories. Given a region $R$ of a holographic\nQFTs, CHI computes $A/4G$ on a certain cut of an event horizon in the\ngravitational dual. The result is naturally interpreted as a coarse-grained\nentropy for the QFT. CHI is known to be finitely greater than the fine-grained\nHubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi (HRT) entropy when $\\partial R$ lies on a Killing\nhorizon of the QFT spacetime, and in this context satisfies other non-trivial\nproperties expected of an entropy. Here we present evidence that it also\nsatisfies the quantum null energy condition (QNEC), which bounds the second\nderivative of the entropy of a quantum field theory on one side of a\nnon-expanding null surface by the flux of stress-energy across the surface. In\nparticular, we show CHI to satisfy the QNEC in 1+1 holographic CFTs when\nevaluated in states dual to conical defects in AdS$_3$. This surprising result\nfurther supports the idea that CHI defines a useful notion of coarse-grained\nholographic entropy, and suggests unprecedented bounds on the rate at which\nbulk horizon generators emerge from a caustic. To supplement our motivation, we\ninclude an appendix deriving a corresponding coarse-grained generalized second\nlaw for 1+1 holographic CFTs perturbatively coupled to dilaton gravity.\n", "  We introduce the general parameter Q_PB that provides an experimentally\naccessible nonclassicality measure for light. The parameter is quantified by\nthe click statistics obtained from on-off detectors in a general multiplexing\ndetection setup. Sub-Poisson-binomial statistics, observed by Q_PB<0, indicates\nthat a given state of light is nonclassical. Our new parameter replaces the\nbinomial parameter Q_B for more general cases, where any unbalance among the\nmultiplexed modes is allowed, thus enabling the use of arbitrary multiplexing\nschemes. The significance of the parameter Q_PB is theoretically examined in a\nmeasurement setup that only consists of a ring resonator and a single on-off\ndetector. The proposed setup exploits minimal experimental resources and is\ngeared towards a fully integrated quantum nanophotonic circuit. The results\nshow that nonclassical features remain noticeable even in the presence of\nsignificant losses, rendering the new nonclassicality test more practical and\nflexible to be used in various nanophotonic platforms.\n", "  Using Fourier and wavelet analysis, we critically re-assess the significance\nof our detection of periodic pulsations in coronal loops. We show that the\nproper identification of the frequency dependence and statistical properties of\nthe different components of the power spectra provies a strong argument against\nthe common practice of data detrending, which tends to produce spurious\ndetections around the cut-off frequency of the filter. In addition, the white\nand red noise models built into the widely used wavelet code of Torrence &\nCompo cannot, in most cases, adequately represent the power spectra of coronal\ntime series, thus also possibly causing false positives. Both effects suggest\nthat several reports of periodic phenomena should be re-examined. The Torrence\n& Compo code nonetheless effectively computes rigorous confidence levels if\nprovided with pertinent models of mean power spectra, and we describe the\nappropriate manner in which to call its core routines. We recall the meaning of\nthe default confidence levels output from the code, and we propose new\nMonte-Carlo-derived levels that take into account the total number of degrees\nof freedom in the wavelet spectra. These improvements allow us to confirm that\nthe power peaks that we detected have a very low probability of being caused by\nnoise.\n", "  Recent computational results suggest that directional dark matter detectors\nhave potential to probe for WIMP dark matter particles below the neutrino\nfloor. The DRIFT-IId detector used in this work is a leading directional WIMP\nsearch time projection chamber detector. We report the first measurements of\nthe detection of the directional nuclear recoils in a fully fiducialised\nlow-pressure time projection chamber. In this new operational mode, the\ndistance between each event vertex and the readout plane is determined by the\nmeasurement of minority carriers produced by adding a small amount of oxygen to\nthe nominal CS$_{2}$ + CF$_{4}$ target gas mixture. The CS$_2$ + CF$_4$ + O$_2$\nmixture has been shown to enable background-free operation at current\nsensitivities. Sulfur, fluorine, and carbon recoils were generated using\nneutrons emitted from a $^{252}$Cf source positioned at different locations\naround the detector. Measurement of the relative energy loss along the recoil\ntracks allowed the track vector sense, or the so-called head-tail asymmetry\nparameter, to be deduced. Results show that the previously reported observation\nof head-tail sensitivity in pure CS$_{2}$ is well retained after the addition\nof oxygen to the gas mixture.\n", "  Miniaturization of superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) is\nof major importance for the development of sensitive scanning nanoscale\nmagnetometry tools. The high sensitivity of nanoSQUIDs is restricted, however,\nto only particular periodic values of the applied magnetic field, making\naccurate measurements at intermediate values of the field impossible. We\npresent a theoretical investigation of a multi-terminal, multi-junction SQUID\n(mSQUID) that lifts this limitation by providing electrical means for a\ncontinuous shift of the quantum interference pattern with respect to the\napplied field. Analysis of 4-terminal, 4-junction and 3-terminal, 3-junction\nmSQUIDs shows that operation at maximum sensitivity can be obtained at any\nvalue of the magnetic field by applying control current to the extra terminals.\nThe model describes the variation and the shift of the interference pattern as\na function of the control currents, junction asymmetries, and the mSQUID\ninductance. The mSQUID is also shown to provide a direct measurement of the\ncurrent-phase relations of superconducting junctions. The derived model\nprovides a quantitative description of the recently developed multi-terminal\nnanoSQUID-on-tip.\n", "  The properties of natural and artificial assemblies of interacting elements,\nranging from Quarks to Galaxies, are at the heart of Physics. The collective\nresponse and dynamics of such assemblies are dictated by the intrinsic\ndynamical properties of the building blocks, the nature of their interactions\nand topological constraints. Here we report on the relaxation dynamics of the\nmagnetization of artificial assemblies of mesoscopic spins. In our model\nnano-magnetic system - square artificial spin ice - we are able to control the\ngeometrical arrangement and interaction strength between the magnetically\ninteracting building blocks by means of nano-lithography. Using time resolved\nmagnetometry we show that the relaxation process can be described using the\nKohlrausch law and that the extracted temperature dependent relaxation times of\nthe assemblies follow the Vogel-Fulcher law. The results provide insight into\nthe relaxation dynamics of mesoscopic nano-magnetic model systems, with\nadjustable energy and time scales, and demonstrates that these can serve as an\nideal playground for the studies of collective dynamics and relaxations.\n", "  Inelastic x-ray scattering with meV energy resolution (IXS) is an ideal tool\nto measure collective excitations in solids and liquids. In non-resonant\nscattering condition, the cross section is strongly dominated by lattice\nvibrations (phonons). However, it is possible to probe additional degrees of\nfreedom such as magnetic fluctuations that are strongly coupled to the phonons.\nThe IXS spectrum of the coupled system will contain not only the phonon\ndispersion (majority component) but also the so far undetected magnetic\ncorrelation function (minority component). Here we report the discovery of\nstrong magnon-phonon coupling in LiCrO$_2$ that enables the measurement of\nmagnetic correlations throughout the Brillouin-zone via IXS. We found\nelectromagnon excitations and electric dipole active two-magnon excitations in\nthe magnetically ordered phase and paraelectromagnons in the paramagnetic phase\nof LiCrO$_2$. We predict that the numerous group of (frustrated) magnets with\ndominant direct exchange and non-collinear magnetism shows similarly strong\ncoupling and surprisingly large and measurable IXS cross section for magnons\nand multi-magnon processes.\n", "  Contact inhibition plays a crucial role in the motility of cells, the process\nof wound healing, and the formation of tumors. By mimicking the mechanical\nmotion of calls crawling on a substrate using a pseudopod, we constructed a\nminimal model for migrating cells which gives rise to contact inhibition of\nlocomotion (CIL) naturally. The model cell consists of two disks, one in the\nfront (a pseudopod) and the other one in the back (cell body), connected by a\nfinitely extensible spring. Despite the simplicity of the model, the cells'\ncollective behavior is highly nontrivial, depending on the shape of cells and\nwhether CIL is enabled or not. Cells with a small front circle (i.e. a narrow\npseudopod) form immobile colonies. In contrast, cells with a large front circle\n(i.e. such as a lamellipodium) exhibit coherent migration without any explicit\nalignment mechanism being present in the model. This suggests that crawling\ncells often exhibit broad fronts because it helps them avoid clustering. Upon\nincreasing the density, the cells develop density waves which propagate against\nthe direction of cell migration and finally arrest at higher densities.\n", "  We present a new black hole solution in the asymptotic Lifshitz spacetime\nwith a hyperscaling violating factor. A novel computational method is\nintroduced to compute the DC thermoelectric conductivities analytically. We\nfind that both the linear-T and quadratic-T contributions to the resistivity\ncan be realized, indicating that a more detailed comparison with experimental\nphenomenology can be performed in this scenario.\n", "  We study a one-dimensional (1d) XXZ spin-chain in a random field on the\nmetallic side of the many-body localization transition by level statistics. For\na fixed interaction, and intermediate disorder below the many-body localization\ntransition, we find that, asymptotically, the number variance grows faster than\nlinear with a disorder dependent exponent. This is consistent with the\nexistence of an anomlaous Thouless energy in the spectrum. In non-interacting\ndisordered metals this is an energy scale related to the typical time for a\nparticle to diffuse across the sample. In the interacting case it seems related\nto a more intricate anomalous diffusion process. This interpretation is not\nfully consistent with recent claims that, for intermediate disorder, level\nstatistics are described by a plasma model with power-law decaying interactions\nwhose number variance grows slower than linear. As disorder is further\nincreased, still on the metallic side, the Thouless energy is gradually washed\nout. In the range of sizes we can explore, level statistics are scale invariant\nand approach Poisson statistics at the many-body localization transition.\nSlightly below the many-body localization transition, spectral correlations,\nwell described by critical statistics, are quantitatively similar to those of a\nhigh dimensional, non-interacting, disordered conductor at the Anderson\ntransition.\n", "  Is life most likely to emerge at the present cosmic time near a star like the\nSun? We consider the habitability of the Universe throughout cosmic history,\nand conservatively restrict our attention to the context of \"life as we know\nit\" and the standard cosmological model, LCDM. The habitable cosmic epoch\nstarted shortly after the first stars formed, about 30 Myr after the Big Bang,\nand will end about 10 Tyr from now, when all stars will die. We review the\nformation history of habitable planets and find that unless habitability around\nlow mass stars is suppressed, life is most likely to exist near 0.1 solar mass\nstars ten trillion years from now. Spectroscopic searches for biosignatures in\nthe atmospheres of transiting Earth-mass planets around low mass stars will\ndetermine whether present-day life is indeed premature or typical from a cosmic\nperspective.\n", "  The molecular arrangement of lipids and proteins within biomembranes and\nmonolayers gives rise to complex film morphologies as well as regions of\ndistinct electrical surface potential, topographical and electrostatic\nnanoscale domains. To probe these nanodomains in soft matter is a challenging\ntask both experimentally and theoretically. This work addresses the effects of\ncholesterol, lipid composition, lipid charge, and lipid phase on the monolayer\nstructure and the electrical surface potential distribution. Atomic Force\nMicroscopy (AFM) was used to resolve topographical nanodomains and Kelvin Probe\nForce Microscopy (KPFM) to resolve electrical surface potential of these\nnanodomains in lipid monolayers. Model monolayers composed of\ndipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine\n(DOPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC),\n1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-(3-lysyl(1-glycerol))] (DOPG),\nsphingomyelin, and cholesterol were studied. It is shown that cholesterol\nchanges nanoscale domain formation, affecting both topography and electrical\nsurface potential. The molecular basis for differences in electrical surface\npotential was addressed with atomistic molecular dynamics (MD). MD simulations\nqualitatively match the experimental results, with 100s of mV difference in\nelectrostatic potential between liquid-disordered bilayer (Ld, less cholesterol\nand lower chain order) and a liquid-ordered bilayer (Lo, more cholesterol and\nhigher chain order). Importantly, the difference in electrostatic properties\nbetween Lo and Ld phases suggests a new mechanism by which membrane composition\ncouples to membrane function.\n", "  We study the phenomenological consequences of recent results from atmospheric\nand accelerator neutrino experiments, favoring normal neutrino mass ordering\n$m_1 < m_2 < m_3$, a near maximal lepton Dirac CP phase $\\delta_{l}\\sim\n270^\\circ$ along with $\\theta_{23}\\gtrsim 45^\\circ$, for possible realization\nof natural structure in the lepton mass matrices characterized by ${({M_{ij}})}\n\\sim O(\\sqrt {{m_i}{m_j}}) $ for $i,j=1,2,3$. It is observed that deviations\nfrom parallel texture structures for $M_{l}$ and $M_{\\nu}$ are essential for\nrealizing such structures. In particular, such hierarchical neutrino mass\nmatrices are not supportive for a vanishing neutrino mass $m_{\\nu 1}\\rightarrow\n0$ characterized by Det$M_{\\nu}\\ne 0$ and predict ${m_{\\nu 1}} \\simeq (0.1 -\n8.0)$ $meV$ , ${m_{\\nu 2}} \\simeq (8.0 - 13.0)$ $meV$, ${m_{\\nu 3}} \\simeq\n(47.0 - 52.0)$ $meV$, $\\Sigma \\simeq (56.0 - 71.0)$ $meV$ and $\\left\\langle\n{{m_{ee}}} \\right\\rangle \\simeq (0.01 - 10.0)$ $meV$, respectively, indicating\nthat the task of observing a $0\\nu \\beta \\beta$ decay may be rather challenging\nfor near future experiments.\n", "  A monolayer of molecules or quantum dots sandwiched between electrodes can be\ndriven out of equilibrium by the application of a bias voltage between the\nelectrodes. We study charge ordering, i.e., the spontaneous formation of a\ncharge density wave, and the perpendicular current in such a system within a\nmaster-equation approach augmented by mean-field and classical Monte Carlo\nmethods. Our approach is suitable for weak tunneling between the monolayer and\nthe electrodes. For a square lattice with nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsion,\nwe present a comprehensive study of the zero-temperature phases controlled by\nthe on-site energy, the bias voltage, and the degeneracy of the occupied\nsingle-site state. One of the most interesting results is the prediction of a\nconducting charge-density-wave phase that only occurs at a finite bias voltage.\nWe also study the universality classes of the phase transitions towards\ncharge-ordered states at zero and nonzero temperatures. While all transitions\nat $T>0$ and some at $T=0$ belong to the two-dimensional Ising universality\nclass, we also find an absorbing-to-active phase transition in the\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetric directed percolation (DP2) class at $T=0$.\n", "  We use the mass discrepancy-acceleration relation (the correlation between\nthe ratio of total-to-visible mass and acceleration in galaxies; MDAR) to test\nthe galaxy-halo connection. We analyse the MDAR using a set of 16 statistics\nthat quantify its four most important features: its shape, its scatter, the\npresence of a \"characteristic acceleration scale,\" and the correlation of its\nresiduals with other galaxy properties. We construct an empirical framework for\nthe galaxy-halo connection in LCDM to generate predictions for these\nstatistics, starting with conventional correlations (halo abundance matching;\nAM) and introducing more where required. Comparing to the SPARC data, we find\nthat: 1) the approximate shape of the MDAR is readily reproduced by AM, and\nthere is no evidence that the acceleration at which dark matter becomes\nnegligible has less spread in the data than in AM mocks; 2) even under\nconservative assumptions, AM significantly overpredicts the scatter in the\nrelation and its normalisation at low acceleration, and furthermore positions\ndark matter too close to galaxies' centres on average; 3) the MDAR affords 2\nsigma evidence for an anticorrelation of galaxy size and Hubble type with halo\nmass or concentration at fixed stellar mass. Our analysis lays the groundwork\nfor a bottom-up determination of the galaxy-halo connection from relations such\nas the MDAR, provides concrete statistical tests for specific galaxy formation\nmodels, and brings into sharper focus the relative evidence accorded by galaxy\nkinematics to LCDM and modified gravity alternatives.\n", "  We assess how different ATLAS and CMS searches for supersymmetry in the\n$t\\bar t + E_T^{\\rm miss}$ final state at Run 1 of the LHC constrain scenarios\nwith a fermionic top partner and a dark matter candidate. We find that the\nefficiencies of these searches in all-hadronic, 1-lepton and 2-lepton channels\nare quite similar for scalar and fermionic top partners. Therefore, in general,\nefficiency maps for stop-neutralino simplified models can also be applied to\nfermionic top-partner models, provided the narrow width approximation holds in\nthe latter. Owing to the much higher production cross-sections of heavy top\nquarks as compared to stops, masses up to $m_T\\approx 850$ GeV can be excluded\nfrom the Run 1 stop searches. Since the simplified-model results published by\nATLAS and CMS do not extend to such high masses, we provide our own efficiency\nmaps obtained with CheckMATE and MadAnalysis 5 for these searches. Finally, we\nalso discuss how generic gluino/squark searches in multi-jet final states\nconstrain heavy top partner production.\n", "  The radial basis function (RBF) approach has been used to improve the mass\npredictions of nuclear models. However, systematic deviations exist between the\nimproved masses and the experimental data for nuclei with different odd-even\nparities of ($Z$, $N$), i.e., the (even $Z$, even $N$), (even $Z$, odd $N$),\n(odd $Z$, even $N$), and (odd $Z$, odd $N$). By separately training the RBF for\nthese four different groups, it is found that the systematic odd-even\ndeviations can be cured in a large extend and the predictive power of nuclear\nmass models can thus be further improved. Moreover, this new approach can\nbetter reproduce the single-nucleon separation energies. Based on the latest\nversion of Weizs\\\"acker-Skyrme model WS4, the root-mean-square deviation of the\nimproved masses with respect to known data falls to $135$ keV, approaching the\nchaos-related unpredictability limit ($\\sim 100$ keV).\n", "  A systematic study of the coupling at room temperature between ferromagnetic\nresonance (FMR) and a planar resonator is presented. The chosen magnetic\nmaterial is a ferrimagnetic insulator (Yttrium Iron Garnet: YIG) which is\npositioned on top of a stop band (notch) filter based on a stub line\ncapacitively coupled to a 50 $\\Omega$ microstrip line resonating at 4.731 GHz.\nControl of the magnon-photon coupling strength is discussed in terms of the\nmicrowave excitation configuration and the YIG thickness from 0.2 to 41 $\\mu$m.\nFrom the latter dependence, we extract a single spin-photon coupling of\ng$_{0}$/2$\\pi$=162$\\pm$6 mHz and a maximum of an effective coupling of 290 MHz.\n", "  In this paper, we first show that the Einstein field equations for all\nperfect-fluid FLRW cosmologies can be written as a planar dynamical system with\nthe equation of state parameter $w$ and cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ as\nparameters. An important equilibrium point of this dynamical system is the\norigin which represents Minkowski spacetime. It is shown that the Einstein\nfield equations in a neigbourhood of this point are equivalent to a degenerate\nBogdanov-Takens normal form. This normal form admits a set of equilibrium\npoints that describes a set of solutions to the Einstein field equations that\nhave a constant rate of expansion, negative spatial curvature, zero\ncosmological constant and dust.\n", "  A heavy-fermion superconductor UPt$_3$ is a unique spin-triplet\nsuperconductor with multiple superconducting phases. Here we provide the first\nreport on the first-principles analysis of the microscopic superconducting gap\nstructure. We find that the promising gap structure is an unprecedented\n$E_{2u}$ state, which is completely different from the previous\nphenomenological $E_{2u}$ models. Our obtained $E_{2u}$ state has in-plane\ntwofold vertical line nodes on small Fermi surfaces and point nodes with linear\ndispersion on a large Fermi surface. These peculiar features cannot be\nexplained in the conventional spin $1/2$ representation, but is described by\nthe group-theoretical representation of the Cooper pairs in the total angular\nmomentum $j=5/2$ space. Our findings shed new light on the long-standing\nproblems in the superconductivity of UPt$_3$\n", "  Motivated by a growing interest in multi-orbital superconductors with\nspin-orbit interactions, we perform the group-theoretical classification of\nvarious unconventional superconductivity emerging in symmorphic $\\rm O$, $\\rm\nD_4$, and $\\rm D_6$ space groups. The generalized Cooper pairs, which we here\ncall \"multipole\" superconductivity, possess spin-orbital coupled (multipole)\ndegrees of freedom, instead of the conventional spin singlet/triplet in\nsingle-orbital systems. From the classification, we obtain the following key\nconsequences, which have been overlooked in the long history of research in\nthis field: (1) A superconducting gap function with\n$\\varGamma_9\\otimes\\varGamma_9$ in $\\rm D_6$ possesses nontrivial momentum\ndependence, different from the usual spin 1/2 classification. (2)\nUnconventional gap structure can be realized in the BCS approximation of purely\nlocal (on-site) interactions irrespective of attractive/repulsive. It implies\nthe emergence of an electron-phonon (e-ph) driven unconventional\nsuperconductivity. (3) Reflecting symmetry of orbital basis functions, there\nappear not symmetry-protected but inevitable line nodes/gap minima, and thus,\nanisotropic $s$-wave superconductivity can be naturally explained without any\ncompetitive fluctuations.\n", "  Binary mixtures prepared in an homogeneous phase and quenched into a\ntwo-phase region phase-separate via a coarsening process whereby domains of the\ntwo phases grow in time. With a numerical study of a spin-exchange model we\nshow that this dynamics first takes a system with equal density of the two\nspecies to a critical percolation state. We prove this claim and we determine\nthe time-dependence of the growing length associated to this process with the\nscaling analysis of the statistical and morphological properties of the\nclusters of the two phases.\n", "  We derive fundamental constraints for the Schur complement of positive\nmatrices, which provide an operator strengthening to recently established\ninformation inequalities for quantum covariance matrices, including strong\nsubadditivity. This allows us to prove general results on the monogamy of\nentanglement and steering quantifiers in continuous variable systems with an\narbitrary number of modes per party. A powerful hierarchical relation for\ncorrelation measures based on the log-determinant of covariance matrices is\nfurther established for all Gaussian states, which has no counterpart among\nquantities based on the conventional von Neumann entropy.\n", "  We study the response of one-dimensional liquid $^4$He to weak perturbations\nrelying on the dynamical structure factor, $S(q,\\omega)$, recently obtained via\nab-initio techniques [Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 135302 (2016)]. We evaluate the\ndrag force, $F_v$, experienced by an impurity moving along the system with\nvelocity $v$ and the static response function, $\\chi(q)$, describing the\ndensity modulations induced by a periodic perturbation with wave vector $q$.\n", "  We have studied how the energy spectrum of muons at production affects some\nof the most common measurements related to muons in extensive air shower\nstudies, namely, the number of muons at the ground, the slope of the lateral\ndistribution of muons, the apparent muon production depth, and the arrival time\ndelay of muons at ground. We found that by changing the energy spectrum by an\namount consistent with the difference between current models (namely EPOS-LHC\nand QGSjet-II.04), the muon surface density at ground increases $5\\%$ at\n$20^\\circ$ zenith angle and $17\\%$ at $60^\\circ$ zenith angle. This effect\nintroduces a zenith angle dependence on the reconstructed number of muons which\nmight be experimentally observed. The maximum of the muon production depth\ndistribution at $40^\\circ$ increases $\\sim10\\text{ g/cm}^2$ and $\\sim0\\text{\ng/cm}^2$ at $60^\\circ$, which, from pure geometrical considerations, increases\nthe arrival time delay of muons. There is an extra contribution to the delay\ndue to the subluminal velocities of muons of the order of $\\sim3$ ns at all\nzenith angles. Finally, changes introduced in the logarithmic slope of the\nlateral density function are less than 2%.\n", "  We study electromagnetic scattering and subsequent plasmonic excitations in\nperiodic grids of graphene ribbons. To address this problem, we develop an\nanalytical method to describe the plasmon-assisted absorption of\nelectromagnetic radiation by a periodic structure of graphene ribbons forming a\ndiffraction grating for THz and mid-IR light. The major advantage of this\nmethod lies in its ability to accurately describe the excitation of graphene\nsurface plasmons (GSPs) in one-dimensional (1D) graphene gratings without the\nuse of both time-consuming, and computationally-demanding full-wave numerical\nsimulations. We thus provide analytical expressions for the reflectance,\ntransmittance and plasmon-enhanced absorbance spectra, which can be readily\nevaluated in any personal laptop with little-to-none programming. We also\nintroduce a semi-analytical method to benchmark our previous results and\nfurther compare the theoretical data with spectra taken from experiments, to\nwhich we observe a very good agreement. These theoretical tools may therefore\nbe applied to design new experiments and cutting-edge nanophotonic devices\nbased on graphene plasmonics.\n", "  Titanium dioxide, TiO$_2$, has multiple applications in catalysis, energy\nconversion and memristive devices because of its electronic structure. Most of\nthese applications utilize the naturally existing phases: rutile, anatase and\nbrookite. Despite the simple form of TiO$_2$ and its wide uses, there is\nlong-standing disagreement between theory and experiment on the energetic\nordering of these phases that has never been resolved. We present the first\nanalysis of phase stability at zero temperature using the highly accurate\nmany-body fixed node diffusion Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method. We also\ninclude the effects of temperature by calculating the Helmholtz free energy\nincluding both internal energy and vibrational contributions from density\nfunctional perturbation theory based quasi harmonic phonon calculations. Our\nQMC calculations find that anatase is the most stable phase at zero\ntemperature, consistent with many previous mean-field calculations. However, at\nelevated temperatures, rutile becomes the most stable phase. For all finite\ntemperatures, brookite is always the least stable phase.\n", "  We describe a dynamic magneto-optical trap (MOT) suitable for the use with\nvacuum systems in which optical access is limited to a single window. This\ntechnique facilitates the long-standing desire of producing integrated atom\nchips, many of which are likely to have severely restricted optical access\ncompared with conventional vacuum chambers. This \"switching-MOT\" relies on the\nsynchronized pulsing of optical and magnetic fields at audio frequencies. The\ntrap's beam geometry is obtained using a planar mirror surface, and does not\nrequire a patterned substrate or bulky optics inside the vacuum chamber.\nCentral to the design is a novel magnetic field geometry that requires no\nexternal quadrupole or bias coils which leads toward a very compact system. We\nhave implemented the trap for $^{85}$Rb and shown that it is capable of\ncapturing 2 million atoms and directly cooling below the Doppler temperature.\n", "  The present work is based on the holographic dark energy model with Hubble\nhorizon as the infrared cut-off. The interaction rate between dark energy and\ndark matter has been reconstructed for three different parameterizations of the\ndeceleration parameter. Observational constraints on the model parameters have\nbeen obtained by maximum likelihood analysis using the observational Hubble\nparameter data (OHD), type Ia supernovab data (SNe), baryon acoustic\noscillation data (BAO) and the distance prior of cosmic microwave background\n(CMB) namely the CMB shift parameter data (CMBShift). The interaction rate\nobtained in the present work remains always positive and increases with\nexpansion. It is very similar to the result obtained in previous findings where\nthe interaction rate has been reconstructed for a parametrization of the dark\nenergy equation of state. Tighter constraints on the interaction rate have been\nobtained in the present work as it is based on larger data sets. The nature of\nthe dark energy equation of state parameter has also been studied for the\npresent models. Though the reconstruction is done from different\nparametrizations, the overall nature of the interaction rate is very similar in\nall the cases. Different information criteria and the Bayesian evidence, which\nhave been invoked in the context of model selection, show that the these models\nare at close proximity of each other.\n", "  A series of symmetry-protected topological(SPT) and trivial spin-gap phases\nin the spin-1/2 ferromagnetic--antiferromagnetic alternating Heisenberg chain\nwith alternating next-nearest-neighbour interaction are investigated using two\nkinds of entanglement spectra defined by different divisions of the whole\nchain. In the case one of the next-nearest-neighbor interaction vanishes, the\nmodel reduces to the $\\Delta$-chain in which a series of spin-gap phases are\nfound in J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 77, 044707 (2008). From the degeneracy of the\nentanglement spectra, these phases are identified as the SPT and trivial\nphases. It is found that the ground state phases boundaries are insensitive to\nthe strength of the alternation in next-nearest neighbor interaction. These\nresults are consistent with the analysis based on the nonlinear $\\sigma$ model\nand exact solution on the ferromagnetic-nonmagnetic phase boundary.\n", "  We show that phase transitions in spin-one Bose gases and stacked triangular\nHeisenberg antiferromagnets -- an example of frustrated magnets with competing\ninteractions -- are described by the same Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson Hamiltonian\nwith O(3)$\\times$O(2) symmetry. In agreement with previous\nnonperturbative-renormalization-group studies of the three-dimensional\nO(3)$\\times$O(2) model, we find that the transition from the normal phase to\nthe superfluid ferromagnetic phase in a spin-one Bose gas is weakly first order\nand shows pseudoscaling behavior. The (nonuniversal) pseudoscaling exponent\n$\\nu$ is fully determined by the scattering lengths $a_0$ and $a_2$. We provide\nestimates of $\\nu$ in $^{87}$Rb, $^{41}$K and $^7$Li atom gases which can be\ntested experimentally. We argue that pseudoscaling comes from either a\ncrossover phenomena due to proximity of the O(6) Wilson-Fisher fixed point\n($^{87}$Rb and $^{41}$K) or the existence of two unphysical fixed points (with\ncomplex coordinates) which slow down the RG flow ($^7$Li). These unphysical\nfixed points are a remnant of the chiral and antichiral fixed points that exist\nin the O($N$)$\\times$O(2) model when $N$ is larger than $N_c\\simeq 5.3$ (the\ntransition being then second order and controlled by the chiral fixed point).\nFinally, we discuss a O(2)$\\times$O(2) lattice model and show that our results,\neven though we find the transition to be first order, are compatible with Monte\nCarlo simulations yielding an apparent second-order transition.\n", "  Energetic electrons are of interest in many types of plasmas, however\nprevious modeling of their properties has been restricted to the use of linear\nFokker-Planck collision operators or non-relativistic formulations. Here, we\ndescribe a fully non-linear kinetic-equation solver, capable of handling large\nelectric-field strengths (compared to the Dreicer field) and relativistic\ntemperatures. This tool allows modeling of the momentum-space dynamics of the\nelectrons in cases where strong departures from Maxwellian distributions may\narise. As an example, we consider electron runaway in magnetic-confinement\nfusion plasmas and describe a transition to electron slide-away at field\nstrengths significantly lower than previously predicted.\n", "  We show a tight-binding model for double perovskite monolayers grown in the\n{001} crystallographic direction can exhibit higher Chern numbers for the\nlowest band of the model dispersion in the absence of an applied magnetic\nfield, including $\\pm2$, $\\pm4$, $\\pm6$, and $\\pm8$, for model parameters and\nterms relevant to Sr$_2$CrWO$_6$ (SCWO). We further show it is possible to tune\nbetween these different topological phases by applying a weak in-plane magnetic\nfield. These results may be important for experimentally realizing exotic band\ntopologies -- and even quantum anomalous Hall insulators with higher Chern\nnumbers -- based on this physics.\n", "  We show that a junction of three off-critical quantum Ising chains can be\nregarded as a quantum spin chain realization of the two-channel spin-1/2\noverscreened Kondo effect with two superconducting leads. We prove that, as\nlong as the Kondo temperature is larger than the superconducting gap, the\nequivalent Kondo model flows towards the 2 channel Kondo fixed point. We argue\nthat our system provides the first controlled realization of 2 channel Kondo\neffect with superconducting leads. This, besides its the theoretical interest,\nis of importance for potential applications to a number of context, including\nthe analysis of the quantum entanglement properties of a Kondo system.\n", "  A theoretical formulation of magnetoresistance effect in a metallic\nferromagnetic/nonmagnetic bilayer originated from the charge-spin conversion by\nthe anomalous Hall effect is presented. Analytical expressions of the\nlongitudinal and transverse resistivities in both nonmagnet and ferromagnet are\nobtained by solving the spin diffusion equation. The magnetoresistance\ngenerated from charge-spin conversion purely caused by the anomalous Hall\neffect in the ferromagnet is found to be proportional to the square of the spin\npolarizations in the ferromagnet and has fixed sign. We also find additional\nmagnetoresistances in both nonmagnet and ferromagnet arising from the mixing of\nthe spin Hall and anomalous Hall effects. The sign of this mixing resistance\ndepends on those of the spin Hall angle in the nonmagnet and the spin\npolarizations of the ferromagnet.\n", "  Systematic effects in dual-beam, differential, radio observations of extended\nobjects are discussed in the context of the One Centimeter Receiver Array\n(OCRA). We use simulated samples of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) galaxy clusters at\nlow ($z<0.4$) and intermediate ($0.4<z<1.0$) redshifts to study the\nimplications of operating at a single frequency (30 GHz) on the accuracy of\nextracting SZ flux densities and of reconstructing comptonization parameters\nwith OCRA. We analyze dependences on cluster mass, redshift, observation\nstrategy, and telescope pointing accuracy. Using $Planck$ data to make primary\ncosmic microwave background (CMB) templates, we test the feasibility of\nmitigating CMB confusion effects in observations of SZ profiles at angular\nscales larger than the separation of the receiver beams.\n", "  In this paper we solve the Blume-Capel model on a complete graph in the\npresence of random crystal field with a distribution, $P(\\Delta_i)\n=p\\delta(\\Delta_i-\\Delta)+(1-p) \\delta(\\Delta_i+\\Delta)$, using large deviation\ntechniques. We find that the first order transition of the pure system is\ndestroyed for $0.046<p<0.954$ for all values of the crystal field, $\\Delta$.\nThe system has a line of continuous transition for this range of $p$ from\n$-\\infty <\\Delta <\\infty$. For values of $p$ outside this interval, the phase\ndiagram of the system is similar to the pure model, with a tricritical point\nseparating the line of first order and continuous transitions. We find that in\nthis regime, the order vanishes for large $\\Delta$ for $p<0.046$(and for large\n$-\\Delta$ for $p>0.954$) even at zero temperature.\n", "  The ATLAS and CMS collaborations have recently released their new analyses of\nthe diphoton searches. We look in detail the consequences of their results\nderiving strong constraints on models where a scalar resonance $s$ decays into\ntwo light pseudoscalars which in turn decay into two pairs of collimated\nphotons, mis-identified with two real photons. In our construction, all mass\nterms are generated dynamically, and only one pair of vector-like fermions\ngenerate couplings which will be probed using the upcoming LHC data. Moreover,\nwe show that a stable dark matter candidate, respecting the cosmological\nconstraints, is naturally affordable in the model.\n", "  We have studied the mechanical properties and phonon dispersions of fully\nhydrogenated borophene (borophane) under strains by first principles\ncalculations. Uniaxial tensile strains along the a- and b-direction,\nrespectively, and biaxial tensile strain have been considered. Our results show\nthat the mechanical properties and phonon stability of borophane are both\nhighly anisotropic. The ultimate tensile strain along the a-direction is only\n0.12, but it can be as large as 0.30 along the b-direction. Compared to\nborophene and other 2D materials (graphene, graphane, silicene, silicane, h-BN,\nphosphorene and MoS2), borophane presents the most remarkable anisotropy in\nin-plane ultimate strain, which is very important for strain engineering.\nFurthermore, the phonon dispersions under the three applied strains indicate\nthat borophane can withstand up to 5% and 15% uniaxial tensile strain along the\na- and b-direction, respectively, and 9% biaxial tensile strain, indicating\nthat mechanical failure in borophane is likely to originate from phonon\ninstability.\n", "  The energy loss effect of incoming gluon from $J/\\psi$ production in p-A (or\nd-A) collisions is investigated by means of the E866, RHIC and LHC experimental\ndata. The gluon mean energy loss per unit path length $dE/dL = 2.18\\pm0.14$\nGeV/fm is extracted by fitting the E866 experimental data for $J/\\psi$\nproduction cross section ratios $R_{W(Fe)/Be}(x_{F})$. The obtained result\nindicates that the incoming gluons lose more energy than the incident quarks.\n  By comparing the theoretical results with E866, RHIC, and LHC experimental\ndata, it is found that the nuclear suppression due to the incident gluon\n(quark) energy loss reduces (increases) with the increase of the kinematic\nvariable $x_{F}$ (or $y$). The energy loss effect of incoming gluon plays an\nimportant role on the suppression of $J/\\psi$ production in a wide energy range\nfrom $\\sqrt{s}=38.7$ GeV to $\\sqrt{s}=5.0$ TeV, and the influence of incident\nquark energy loss can be ignored for high energy(such as at RHIC and LHC\nenergy).\n", "  We present experiments on ensemble cavity quantum electrodynamics with cold\npotassium atoms in a high-finesse ring cavity. Potassium-39 atoms are cooled in\na two-dimensional magneto-optical trap and transferred to a three-dimensional\ntrap which intersects the cavity mode. The apparatus is described in detail and\nthe first observations of strong coupling with potassium atoms are presented.\nCollective strong coupling of atoms and light is demonstrated via the splitting\nof the cavity transmission spectrum and the avoided crossing of the normal\nmodes.\n", "  Neutrino mixing sum rules are common to a large class of models based on the\n(discrete) symmetry approach to lepton flavour. In this approach the neutrino\nmixing matrix $U$ is assumed to have an underlying approximate symmetry form\n$\\tilde{U}_{\\nu}$, which is dictated by, or associated with, the employed\n(discrete) symmetry. In such a setup the cosine of the Dirac CP-violating phase\n$\\delta$ can be related to the three neutrino mixing angles in terms of a sum\nrule which depends on the symmetry form of $\\tilde{U}_{\\nu}$. We consider five\nextensively discussed possible symmetry forms of $\\tilde{U}_{\\nu}$: i)\nbimaximal (BM) and ii) tri-bimaximal (TBM) forms, the forms corresponding to\niii) golden ratio type A (GRA) mixing, iv) golden ratio type B (GRB) mixing,\nand v) hexagonal (HG) mixing. For each of these forms we investigate the\nrenormalisation group corrections to the sum rule predictions for $\\delta$ in\nthe cases of neutrino Majorana mass term generated by the Weinberg (dimension\n5) operator added to i) the Standard Model, and ii) the minimal SUSY extension\nof the Standard Model.\n", "  We review the present activities related to hypernuclear production in\nhadronic in-medium reactions at intermediate energies. The status of\ntheoretical predictions and experimental evidences for the in-medium formation\nof bound superstrange matter is discussed. Heavy-ion collisions and\nantiproton-induced reactions at energies close to strangeness production\nthresholds create the conditions of hypermatter formation. This allows to\nunderstand better in-medium hyperon interactions and sets constraints on the\nstrangeness sector of the nuclear equation of state.\n", "  Several properties of bound states in potential $ V(x)= g^2\\exp (|x|)$ are\nstudied. Firstly, with the emphasis on the reliability of our\narbitrary-precision construction, wave functions are considered in the two\nalternative (viz., asymptotically decreasing or regular) exact Bessel-function\nforms which obey the asymptotic or matching conditions, respectively. The\nmerits of the resulting complementary transcendental secular equation\napproaches are compared and their applicability is discussed.\n", "  The ATLAS Roman Pot system is designed to determine the total proton-proton\ncross-section as well as the luminosity at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) by\nmeasuring elastic proton scattering at very small angles. The system is made of\nfour Roman Pot stations, located in the LHC tunnel in a distance of about 240~m\nat both sides of the ATLAS interaction point. Each station is equipped with\ntracking detectors, inserted in Roman Pots which approach the LHC beams\nvertically. The tracking detectors consist of multi-layer scintillating fibre\nstructures readout by Multi-Anode-Photo-Multipliers.\n", "  Ties between individuals on a social network can represent different\ndimensions of interactions, and the spreading of information and innovations on\nthese networks could potentially be driven by some dimensions more than by\nothers. In this paper we investigate this issue by studying the diffusion of\nmicrofinance within rural India villages and accounting for the whole\nmultilayer structure of the underlying social networks. We define a new measure\nof node centrality, diffusion versatility, and show that this is a better\npredictor of microfinance participation rate than previously introduced\nmeasures defined on aggregated single-layer social networks. Moreover, we\nuntangle the role played by each social dimension and find that the most\nprominent role is played by the nodes that are central on layers concerned with\ntrust, shedding new light on the key triggers of the diffusion of microfinance.\n", "  We present a comprehensive study of the production of top quark pairs in\nassociation with one hard jet in the di-lepton decay channel at the LHC. Our\npredictions, accurate at NLO in QCD, focus on the LHC Run II with a\ncenter-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. All resonant and non-resonant contributions at\nthe perturbative order ${\\cal O}(\\alpha_s^4 \\alpha^4)$ are taken into account,\nincluding irreducible backgrounds to $t\\bar{t}j$ production, interferences and\noff-shell effects of the top quark and the $W$ gauge boson. We extensively\ninvestigate the dependence of our results upon variation of renormalisation and\nfactorisation scales and parton distribution functions in the quest for an\naccurate estimate of the theoretical uncertainties. Additionally, we explore a\nfew possibilities for a dynamical scale choice with the goal of stabilizing the\nperturbative convergence of the differential cross sections far away from the\n$t\\bar{t}$ threshold. Results presented here are particularly relevant for\nsearches of new physics as well as for precise measurements of the top-quark\nfiducial cross sections and top-quark properties at the LHC.\n", "  After the major success of B-factories to establish the CKM mechanism and its\nproven potential to search for new physics, the Belle II experiment will\ncontinue exploring the physics at the flavor frontier over the next years.\nBelle II will collect 50 times more data than its predecessor, Belle, and allow\nfor various precision measurements and searches of rare decays and particles.\nThis paper introduces the B-factory concept and the flavor frontier approach to\nsearch for new physics. It then describes the SuperKEKB accelerator and the\nBelle II detector, as well as some of the physics that will be analyzed in\nBelle II, concluding with the experiment status and schedule.\n", "  We study the thermodynamics of flavor D7-branes embedded in an anisotropic\nblack brane solution of type IIB supergravity. The flavor branes undergo a\nphase transition between a `Minkowski embedding', in which they lie outside of\nthe horizon, and a `black hole embedding', in which they fall into the horizon.\nThis transition depends on the black hole temperature, its degree of\nanisotropy, and the mass of the flavor degrees of freedom. It happens either at\na critical temperature or at a critical anisotropy. A general lesson we learn\nfrom this analysis is that the anisotropy, in this particular realization,\ninduces similar effects as the temperature. In particular, increasing the\nanisotropy bends the branes more and more into the horizon. Moreover, we\nobserve that the transition becomes smoother for higher anisotropies.\n", "  We propose a mechanism of producing a new type of primordial perturbations\nthat collapse to primordial black holes whose mass can be as large as necessary\nfor them to grow to the supermassive black holes observed at high redshifts,\nwithout contradicting COBE/FIRAS upper limits on cosmic microwave background\n(CMB) spectral distortions. In our model, the observable Universe consists of\ntwo kinds of many small patches which experienced different expansion histories\nduring inflation. Primordial perturbations large enough to form primordial\nblack holes are realized on patches that experienced more Hubble expansion than\nthe others. By making these patches the minor component, the rarity of\nsupermassive black holes can be explained. On the other hand, most regions of\nthe Universe experienced the standard history and, hence, only have standard\nalmost-scale-invariant adiabatic perturbations confirmed by observations of CMB\nor large-scale structures of the Universe. Thus, our mechanism can evade the\nconstraint from the nondetection of the CMB distortion set by the COBE/FIRAS\nmeasurement. Our model predicts the existence of supermassive black holes even\nat redshifts much higher than those observed. Hence, our model can be tested by\nfuture observations peeking into the higher-redshift Universe.\n", "  We study the effect of film density on the uniaxial compression of thin\nelastic films at a liquid--fluid interface. Using a combination of experiments\nand theory, we show that dense films first wrinkle and then fold as the\ncompression is increased, similarly to what has been reported when the film\ndensity is neglected. However, we highlight the changes in the shape of the\nfold induced by the film's own weight and extend the model of Diamant and\nWitten [\\emph{Phys.~Rev.~Lett.}, 2011, \\textbf{107}, 164302] to understand\nthese changes. In particular, we suggest that it is the weight of the film that\nbreaks the up-down symmetry apparent from previous models, but elusive\nexperimentally. We then compress the film beyond the point of self-contact and\nobserve a new behaviour dependent on the film density: the single fold that\nforms after wrinkling transitions into a closed loop after self-contact,\nencapsulating a cylindrical droplet of the upper fluid. The encapsulated drop\neither causes the loop to bend upward or to sink deeper as compression is\nincreased, depending on the relative buoyancy of the drop-film combination. We\npropose a model to qualitatively explain this behaviour. Finally, we discuss\nthe relevance of the different buckling modes predicted in previous theoretical\nstudies and highlight the important role of surface tension in the shape of the\nfold that is observed from the side --- an aspect that is usually neglected in\ntheoretical analyses.\n", "  We consider the ground-state properties of an extended one-dimensional Bose\ngas with pointwise attractive interactions. We take the limit where the\ninteraction strength goes to zero as the system size increases at fixed\nparticle density. In this limit the gas exhibits a quantum phase transition. We\ncompute local correlation functions at zero temperature, both at finite and\ninfinite size. We provide analytic formulas for the experimentally relevant\none-point functions $g_2$, $g_3$ and analyze their finite-size corrections. Our\nresults are compared to the mean-field approach based on the Gross-Pitaevskii\nequation which yields the exact results in the infinite system size limit, but\nnot for finite systems.\n", "  We report the discovery of a positive exchange bias between Ni80Fe20 (Py) and\ntwined (10-10)-Cr2O3 film near its blocking temperature (TB) when it is cooled\nin an in-plane magnetic field applied along 45 degrees from the two spin\nconfigurations of the Cr atoms. This is an abnormal behavior compared to the\nnegative exchange bias at all temperatures below TB when the cooling and\nmeasuring magnetic fields are applied along one of the two spin configurations\nof the Cr atoms. We speculate these results could be related to the exchange\ninteractions between the twined structure of the (10-10)-Cr2O3 film epitaxially\ngrown on the rutile (001)-TiO2 substrate.\n", "  We study the exclusive double-photon annihilation processes, $e^+ e^- \\to\n\\gamma \\gamma^\\ast\\to \\gamma V^0$ and $e^+ e^- \\to \\gamma^\\ast \\gamma^\\ast \\to\nV^0_a V^0_b,$ where the $V^0_i$ is a neutral vector meson produced in the\nforward kinematical region: $s \\gg -t$ and $-t \\gg \\Lambda_{\\rm QCD}^2$. We\nshow how the differential cross sections $\\frac{d\\sigma}{dt}$, as predicted by\nQCD, have additional falloff in the momentum transfer squared $t$ due to the\nQCD compositeness of the hadrons, consistent with the leading-twist\nfixed-$\\theta_{\\rm CM} $ scaling laws. However, even though they are exclusive\nchannels and not associated with the conventional electron-positron\nannihilation process $e^+ e^- \\to \\gamma^\\ast \\to q \\bar q,$ these total cross\nsections $\\sigma(e^+ e^- \\to \\gamma V^0) $ and $\\sigma(e^+ e^- \\to V^0_a\nV^0_b),$ integrated over the dominant forward- and backward-$\\theta_{\\rm CM}$\nangular domains, scale as $1/s$, and thus contribute to the leading-twist\nscaling behavior of the ratio $R_{e^+ e^-}$. We generalize these results to\nexclusive double-electroweak vector-boson annihilation processes accompanied by\nthe forward production of hadrons, such as $e^+ e^- \\to Z^0 V^0$ and $e^+ e^-\n\\to W^-\\rho^+$. These results can also be applied to the exclusive production\nof exotic hadrons such as tetraquarks, where the cross-section scaling behavior\ncan reveal their multiquark nature.\n", "  This paper is mainly concerned with the construction of new off-shell higher\nspin N=1 supermultiplets in three spacetime dimensions. We elaborate on the\ngauge prepotentials and linearised super-Cotton tensors for higher spin N=1\nsuperconformal geometry and propose compensating superfields required to\nformulate off-shell massless higher spin supermultiplets. The corresponding\ngauge-invariant actions are worked out explicitly using an auxiliary oscillator\nrealisation. We construct, for the first time, off-shell massive higher spin\nsupermultiplets. The gauge-invariant actions for these supermultiplets are\nobtained by adding Chern-Simons like mass terms (that is, higher spin\nextensions of the linearised action for N=1 conformal supergravity) to the\nactions for the massless supermultiplets. For each of the massive gravitino and\nsupergravity multiplets, we propose two dually equivalent formulations.\n", "  Simulations of magnetization dynamics in a multiscale environment enable\nrapid evaluation of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation in a mesoscopic sample\nwith nanoscopic accuracy in areas where such accuracy is required. We have\ndeveloped a multiscale magnetization dynamics simulation approach that can be\napplied to large systems with spin structures that vary locally on small length\nscales. To implement this, the conventional micromagnetic simulation framework\nhas been expanded to include a multiscale solving routine. The software\nselectively simulates different regions of a ferromagnetic sample according to\nthe spin structures located within in order to employ a suitable discretization\nand use either a micromagnetic or an atomistic model. To demonstrate the\nvalidity of the multiscale approach, we simulate the spin wave transmission\nacross the regions simulated with the two different models and different\ndiscretizations. We find that the interface between the regions is fully\ntransparent for spin waves with frequency lower than a certain threshold set by\nthe coarse scale micromagnetic model with no noticeable attenuation due to the\ninterface between the models. As a comparison to exact analytical theory, we\nshow that in a system with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction leading to spin\nspiral, the simulated multiscale result is in good quantitative agreement with\nthe analytical calculation.\n", "  There has been considerable interest in exploiting the spin degrees of\nfreedom of electrons for potential information storage and computing\ntechnologies. Topological insulators (TI), a class of quantum materials, have\nspecial gapless edge/surface states, where the spin polarization of the Dirac\nfermions is locked to the momentum direction. This spin-momentum locking\nproperty gives rise to very interesting spin-dependent physical phenomena such\nas the Edelstein and inverse Edelstein effects. However, the spin injection in\npure surface states of TI is very challenging because of the coexistence of the\nhighly conducting bulk states. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the spin\ninjection and observe the inverse Edelstein effect in the surface states of a\ntopological Kondo insulator, SmB6. At low temperatures when only surface\ncarriers are present, a clear spin signal is observed. Furthermore, the\nmagnetic field angle dependence of the spin signal is consistent with\nspin-momentum locking property of surface states of SmB6.\n", "  We report the first ground-based transit observation of K2-3d, a 1.5 R_Earth\nplanet supposedly within the habitable zone around a bright M-dwarf host star,\nusing the Okayama 188 cm telescope and the multi(grz)-band imager MuSCAT.\nAlthough the depth of the transit (0.7 mmag) is smaller than the photometric\nprecisions (1.2, 0.9, and 1.2 mmag per 60 s for the g, r, and z bands,\nrespectively), we marginally but consistently identify the transit signal in\nall three bands, by taking advantage of the transit parameters from K2, and by\nintroducing a novel technique that leverages multi-band information to reduce\nthe systematics caused by second-order extinction. We also revisit previously\nanalyzed Spitzer transit observations of K2-3d to investigate the possibility\nof systematic offsets in transit timing, and find that all the timing data can\nbe explained well by a linear ephemeris. We revise the orbital period of K2-3d\nto be 44.55612 \\pm 0.00021 days, which corrects the predicted transit times for\n2019, i.e., the era of the James Webb Space Telescope, by \\sim80 minutes. Our\nobservation demonstrates that (1) even ground-based, 2 m class telescopes can\nplay an important role in refining the transit ephemeris of small-sized,\nlong-period planets, and that (2) a multi-band imager is useful to reduce the\nsystematics of atmospheric origin, in particular for bluer bands and for\nobservations conducted at low-altitude observatories.\n", "  In a recent work, van Setten and coworkers have presented a carefully\nconverged $G_0W_0$ study of 100 closed shell molecules [J. Chem. Theory Comput.\n11, 5665 (2015)]. For two different codes they found excellent agreement to\nwithin few 10 meV if identical Gaussian basis sets were used. We inspect the\nsame set of molecules using the projector augmented wave method and the Vienna\nab initio simulation package (VASP). For the ionization potential, the basis\nset extrapolated plane wave results agree very well with the Gaussian basis\nsets, often reaching better than 50 meV agreement. In order to achieve this\nagreement, we correct for finite basis set errors as well as errors introduced\nby periodically repeated images. For electron affinities below the vacuum level\ndifferences between Gaussian basis sets and VASP are slightly larger. We\nattribute this to larger basis set extrapolation errors for the Gaussian basis\nsets. For quasi particle (QP) resonances above the vacuum level, differences\nbetween VASP and Gaussian basis sets are, however, found to be substantial.\nThis is tentatively explained by insufficient basis set convergence of the\nGaussian type orbital calculations as exemplified for selected test cases.\n", "  In this paper, we consider the decoy-state Measurement-Device-Independent\nQuantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) with four intensities. The average value of\nsuccessful events and bit errors among the pulse pair set be used to\ninvestigate the successful events of different pulses under the statistical\nfluctuation caused by the finite condition. We demonstrate that the lower bound\nof successful events number n11estimated by our method can be more tight than\nthe result in [28]. Numerical simulations show that our estimation method can\nachieve a higher key rate than existing methods with a relatively weak\nconstraints of experimental devices, such as high dark count rate and low\ndetection efficiency of detectors when data size is N = 109.\n", "  We study form factors of the quantum complex sinh-Gordon theory in the\nalgebraic approach. In the case of exponential fields the form factors can be\nobtained from the known form factors of the $Z_N$-symmetric Ising model. The\nalgebraic construction also provides an Ansatz for form factors of descendant\noperators. We obtain generating functions of such form factors and establish\ntheir main properties: the cluster factorization and reflection equations.\n", "  The ability to effectively guide electromagnetic radiation below the\ndiffraction limit is of the utmost importance in the prospect of all-optical\nplasmonic circuitry. Here, we propose an alternative solution to conventional\nmetal-based plasmonics by exploiting the deep subwavelength confinement and\ntunability of graphene plasmons guided along the apex of a graphene-covered\ndielectric wedge or groove. In particular, we present a quasi-analytic model to\ndescribe the plasmonic eigenmodes in such a system, including the complete\ndetermination of their spectrum and corresponding induced potential and\nelectric field distributions. We have found that the dispersion of wedge/groove\ngraphene plasmons follows the same functional dependence as their flat-graphene\nplasmons counterparts, but now scaled by a (purely) geometric factor in which\nall the information about the system's geometry is contained. We believe our\nresults pave the way for the development of novel custom-tailored photonic\ndevices for subwavelength waveguiding and localization of light based on\nrecently discovered 2D materials.\n", "  3D silicon pixel detectors have been investigated as radiation-hard\ncandidates for the innermost layers of the HL-LHC upgrade of the ATLAS pixel\ndetector. 3D detectors are already in use today in the ATLAS IBL and AFP\nexperiments. These are based on 50x250 um2 large pixels connected to the FE-I4\nreadout chip. Detectors of this generation were irradiated to HL-LHC fluences\nand demonstrated excellent radiation hardness with operational voltages as low\nas 180 V and power dissipation of 12--15 mW/cm2 at a fluence of about 1e16\nneq/cm2, measured at -25 degree C. Moreover, to cope with the higher\noccupancies expected at the HL-LHC, a first run of a new generation of 3D\ndetectors designed for the HL-LHC was produced at CNM with small pixel sizes of\n50x50 and 25x100 um2, matched to the FE-I4 chip. They demonstrated a good\nperformance in the laboratory and in beam tests with hit efficiencies of about\n97% at already 1--2V before irradiation.\n", "  Interface structure at polar/non-polar interfaces has been shown to be a key\nfactor in controlling emergent behavior in oxide heterostructures, including\nthe LaFeO$_3$/$\\textit{n}$-SrTiO$_3$ system. We demonstrate via high energy\nresolution x-ray photoemission that epitaxial LaFeO$_3$/$\\textit{n}$-SrTiO$_3$\n(001) heterojunctions engineered to have opposite interface polarities exhibit\nvery similar band offsets and potential gradients within the LaFeO$_3$ films.\nHowever, differences in the potential gradient within the SrTiO$_3$ layer\ndepending on polarity may promote hole diffusion into LaFeO$_3$ for\napplications in photocatalysis.\n", "  This paper, presents a simple method for accurate calibration of organic\nscintillation detectors. The method is based on the fact that differentiating\nthe response function leads to accurate estimation of the Compton edge. The\ndifferentiation method in addition to the location of the Compton edge, gives\ninsights into the parameters of the folded Gaussian function which is useful\nfor determination of the energy resolution. Moreover, it is observed that the\nuncorrelated noise in the measurement of the response function does not impose\nsignificant uncertainties in the evaluations. By simulation of the bounded\nelectrons and considering the Doppler effects, we are able to calculate a first\nestimation for the intrinsic Doppler resolution of a plastic scintillator,\nbenefiting from the capability of the differentiation method.\n", "  We investigated different dense multirotor UAV traffic simulation scenarios\nin open 2D and 3D space, under realistic environments with the presence of\nsensor noise, communication delay, limited communication range, limited sensor\nupdate rate and finite inertia. We implemented two fundamental self-organized\nalgorithms: one with constant direction and one with constant velocity\npreference to reach a desired target. We performed evolutionary optimization on\nboth algorithms in five basic traffic scenarios and tested the optimized\nalgorithms under different vehicle densities. We provide optimal algorithm and\nparameter selection criteria and compare the maximal flux and collision risk of\neach solution and situation. We found that i) different scenarios and densities\nrequire different algorithmic approaches, i.e., UAVs have to behave differently\nin sparse and dense environments or when they have common or different targets;\nii) a slower-is-faster effect is implicitly present in our models, i.e., the\nmaximal flux is achieved at densities where the average speed is far from\nmaximal; iii) communication delay is the most severe destabilizing\nenvironmental condition that has a fundamental effect on performance and needs\nto be taken into account when designing algorithms to be used in real life.\n", "  For the attractive interaction, the L\\\"uscher's finite volume formula gives\nthe phase shift at negative squared moment $k^2<0$ for the ground state in the\nfinite volume, which corresponds to the analytic continuation of the phase\nshift at $k^2<0$ in the infinite volume. Using this fact, we reexamine\nbehaviors of phase shifts at $k^2 <0$ obtained directly from plateaux of\neffective energy shifts in previous lattice studies for two nucleon systems on\nvarious volumes. We have found that data, based on which existences of the\nbound states are claimed, show singular behaviors of the phase shift at\n$k^2<0$, which seem incompatible with smooth behaviors predicted by the\neffective range expansion. This, together with the fake plateau problem for the\ndetermination of the energy shift, brings a serious doubt on existences of the\n$NN$ bound states claimed in previous lattice studies at pion masses heavier\nthan 300 MeV.\n", "  A brief pedagogical review for students on basic physics of Superluminous\nSupernovae. Almost no references to literature are given, but important\nformulas are derived in some detail.\n", "  Seeded CdSe/CdS nanorods exhibit intense polarized emission along the rod\nmain axis. The degree of linear polarization cannot be explained by dielectric\neffects alone, an additional electronic contribution is present whose nature\nhas not been settled up to date. Using multi-band k.p theory, we analyse the\npotential influence of several factors affecting excitonic emission and show\nthat shear strain is the main electronic mechanism promoting linear\npolarization. It favors energetically light hole excitons over heavy hole ones,\nvia deformation potential, and makes their radiative recombination faster via\npiezoelectricity. Implications of this mechanism are that linear emission can\nbe enhanced by growing long but thin CdS shells around large, prolate CdSe\ncores, which indeed supports and rationalizes recent experimental findings.\nTogether with the well-known dielectric effects, these results pave the way for\ncontrolled degree of linear polarization in dot-in-rods through dedicated\nstructural design.\n", "  Angular-momentum or parity-dependent nonlocal optical potentials for\nnucleon-${}^{16}\\mathrm{O}$ scattering able to fit differential cross section\ndata over the whole angular regime are developed and applied to the description\nof deuteron-${}^{16}\\mathrm{O}$ scattering in the framework of three-body\nFaddeev-type equations for transition operators. Differential cross sections\nand deuteron analyzing powers for elastic scattering and\n${}^{16}\\mathrm{O}(d,p){}^{17}\\mathrm{O}$ transfer reactions are calculated\nusing a number of local and nonlocal optical potentials and compared with\nexperimental data. Angular-momentum or parity-dependence of the optical\npotential turns out to be quite irrelevant in the considered three-body\nreactions while nonlocality is essential for a successful description of the\ndifferential cross section data, especially in transfer reactions.\n", "  The geometry of quantum states provides a unifying framework for estimation\nprocesses based on quantum probes, and it allows to derive the ultimate bounds\nof the achievable precision. We show a relation between the statistical\ndistance between infinitesimally close quantum states and the second order\nvariation of the coherence of the optimal measurement basis with respect to the\nstate of the probe. In Quantum Phase Estimation protocols, this leads to\nidentify coherence as the relevant resource that one has to engineer and\ncontrol to optimize the estimation precision. Furthermore, the main object of\nthe theory i.e., the Symmetric Logarithmic Derivative, in many cases allows to\nidentify a proper factorization of the whole Hilbert space in two subsystems.\nThe factorization allows: to discuss the role of coherence vs correlations in\nestimation protocols; to show how certain estimation processes can be\ncompletely or effectively described within a single-qubit subsystem; and to\nderive lower bounds for the scaling of the estimation precision with the number\nof probes used. We illustrate how the framework works for both noiseless and\nnoisy estimation procedures, in particular those based on multi-qubit\nGHZ-states. Finally we succinctly analyze estimation protocols based on\nzero-temperature critical behaviour. We identify the coherence that is at the\nheart of their efficiency, and we show how it exhibits the non-analyticities\nand scaling behaviour proper of a large class of quantum phase transitions.\n", "  The low-energy properties of the elastic $s-$wave scattering for the\n$n-^{19}$C are studied near the critical condition for the occurrence of an\nexcited Efimov state in $n-n-^{18}$C. It is established to which extent the\nuniversal scaling laws, strictly valid in the zero-range limit, survive when\nfinite range potentials are considered. By fixing the two-neutrons separation\nenergy in $^{20}$C with available experimental data, it is studied the scaling\nof the real ($\\delta_0^R$) and imaginary parts of the $s-$wave phase-shift with\nthe variation of the $n-^{18}$C binding energy. We obtain some universal\ncharacteristics given by the pole-position of $k\\cot(\\delta_0^R)$ and\neffective-range parameters. By increasing the $n-^{18}$C binding energy, it was\nverified that the excited state of $^{20}$C goes to a virtual state, resembling\nthe neutron-deuteron behavior in the triton. It is confirmed that the\nanalytical structure of the unitary cut is not affected by the range of the\npotential or mass asymmetry of the three-body system.\n", "  Contrary to counterfactual definiteness quantum theory teaches us that\nmeasuring instruments are not passively reading predetermined values of\nphysical observables. Counterfactual definiteness allows proving Bell\ninequalities. If the contextual character of quantum measurements is correctly\ntaken into account the proofs of these inequalities may not be done. In recent\ncomputer simulations of idealized Bell experiment predetermined successive\noutcomes of measurements for each setting and predetermined time delays of\ntheir registrations are calculated. Time windows and time delays are used to\nselect various samples. Correlations, estimated using these selected samples\nare consistent with the predictions of quantum theory and the time window\ndependence is similar to the dependence observed in some real experiments. It\nis an important example how correlations can be explained without evoking\nquantum non-locality. However by using a suitable post-selection one may prove\nanything. Since before the post-selection generated samples may not violate\nBell inequalities as significantly as finite samples generated using quantum\npredictions thus one may not conclude that counterfactual definiteness is not\nable to distinguish classical from quantum physics. Moreover we show that for\neach choice of a time window there exists a contextual hidden variable\nprobabilistic model consistent with the post-selection procedure used by the\nauthors what explains why they are able to reproduce quantum predictions.\n", "  We discuss the connection between observable CP violation in the lepton\nsector, the properties of heavy neutrinos and the baryon asymmetry of the\nuniverse in the minimal seesaw model. A measurement of the Dirac phase $\\delta$\nwould allow to make testable predictions for the couplings of the heavy\nneutrinos to individual Standard Model lepton flavours. If any heavy neutral\nleptons are experimentally discovered in the future, this provides a powerful\ntest for the mechanism of neutrino mass generation and baryogenesis.\n", "  In this paper, we study the quantum walk on the 2D Penrose Lattice, which is\nintermediate between periodic and disordered structure. Quantum walk on Penrose\nLattice is less efficient in transport comparing to the regular lattices. By\ncalculating the final remaining probability on the initial nodes and estimating\nthe low bound. Our results show that the broken of translational symmetry\ninduces both the localized states and degeneracy of eigenstates at $E=0$, this\ntwo differences from regular lattices influence efficiency of quantum walk.\nAlso, we observe the transition from inefficient to efficient transport after\nintroducing the near hopping terms, which suggests that we can adjust the\n\"hopping strength\" and achieve a \"phase transition\" progress.\n", "  Dielectric elastomers have recently been proposed for various\nbiologically-relevant applications, in which they may operate in fluidic\nenvironments where surface tension effects may have a significant effect on\ntheir stability and reliability. Here, we present a theoretical analysis\ncoupled with computational modeling for a generalized electromechanical\nanalysis of surface stability in dielectric elastomers accounting for surface\ntension effects. For mechanically deformed elastomers, significant increases in\ncritical strain and instability wavelength are observed for small\nelastocapillary numbers. When the elastomers are deformed electrostatically,\nboth surface tension and the amount of pre-compression are found to\nsubstantially increase the critical electric field while decreasing the\ninstability wavelength.\n", "  The Systematic Normal Form (SysNF) is a canonical form of lattices introduced\nin [Eldar,Shor '16], in which the basis entries satisfy a certain co-primality\ncondition. Using a \"smooth\" analysis of lattices by SysNF lattices we design a\nquantum algorithm that can efficiently solve the following variant of the\nbounded-distance-decoding problem: given a lattice L, a vector v, and numbers b\n= {\\lambda}_1(L)/n^{17}, a = {\\lambda}_1(L)/n^{13} decide if v's distance from\nL is in the range [a/2, a] or at most b, where {\\lambda}_1(L) is the length of\nL's shortest non-zero vector. Improving these parameters to a = b =\n{\\lambda}_1(L)/\\sqrt{n} would invalidate one of the security assumptions of the\nLearning-with-Errors (LWE) cryptosystem against quantum attacks.\n", "  The training of molecular models of quantum mechanical properties based on\nstatistical machine learning requires large datasets which exemplify the map\nfrom chemical structure to molecular property. Intelligent a priori selection\nof training examples is often difficult or impossible to achieve as prior\nknowledge may be sparse or unavailable. Ordinarily representative selection of\ntraining molecules from such datasets is achieved through random sampling. We\nuse genetic algorithms for the optimization of training set composition\nconsisting of tens of thousands of small organic molecules. The resulting\nmachine learning models are considerably more accurate with respect to small\nrandomly selected training sets: mean absolute errors for out-of-sample\npredictions are reduced to ~25% for enthalpies, free energies, and zero-point\nvibrational energy, to ~50% for heat-capacity, electron-spread, and\npolarizability, and by more than ~20% for electronic properties such as\nfrontier orbital eigenvalues or dipole-moments. We discuss and present\noptimized training sets consisting of 10 molecular classes for all molecular\nproperties studied. We show that these classes can be used to design improved\ntraining sets for the generation of machine learning models of the same\nproperties in similar but unrelated molecular sets.\n", "  One of the biggest puzzles in modern cosmology is the observed baryon\nasymmetry in the universe. In current models of baryogenesis gravity plays a\nsecondary role, although the process is believed to have happened in the early\nuniverse, under the influence of an intense gravitational field. In the present\nwork we resume Sakharov's original program for baryogenesis and propose a\ncentral role for gravity in the process. This is achieved through a non-minimal\ncoupling (NMC) between the gravitational field and both the strong interaction\nfield and the quark fields. When in action, the present mechanism leads to\nbaryon number non-conservation and CP violation. Moreover, the NMC induces\nreduced effective quark masses, which favours a first order QCD phase\ntransition. As a consequence, a baryon asymmetry can be attained in the\ntransition from the quark epoch to the hadron epoch.\n", "  Conformal Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) of nanoparticles is an now an\nestablished nanofabrication concept employed by many researchers for\napplications such as creating diffusion barriers, tuning catalysis, or masking\na toxic particle core with a biocompatible shell. To conformally coat many\ngrams of nanoparticles with ALD, long precursor soaking steps, fluidized beds,\nvibrating stages, or rotary feedthroughs are typically needed. While these\nimpressive advancements in ALD techniques dominate literature searches of\nparticle ALD coating, such methods may lead to a more time-intensive or\ncost-prohibitive process than what is required by many typical academic\nresearchers. Thus we have performed this study to explore the limits of static\nplanar ALD particle coating, the simplest method to coat nanoparticles with an\nALD film. Using an Arradiance GEMStar6 ALD system, we have explored a fast and\nsimple static ALD particle coating process. Our protocol produces relatively\nsmall, but still academically useful, quantities of uniformally ALD-coated\nnanospheres. This process can be scaled up to nanoparticle samples in the tens\nof milligram to gram range. We have demonstrated that we can achieve silica or\ntitania spherical particle synthesis, and then uniform ALD coating on the\nnanoparticles, all within 8-10 hours. The diameter of the chemically\nsynthesized silica and titania nanoparticles is tunable from 50 nm up to\ngreater than a micron. The refractive index of the titania nanoparticles is\ntunable from approximately 1.7 to 2.7. This report will be most useful for\nresearchers who are new to particle ALD, or who want to experiment with core\nparticles conformally covered with ALD shells before moving to a more\ncomplicated, higher throughput ALD method. We provide details for particle\nsynthesis, storage, and ALD coating along with a comparison to more\nconventional approaches.\n", "  Efficiency droop effect under high injection in GaN-based light emitting\ndiodes (LEDs) strongly depends on wavelength, which is still not well\nunderstood. In this paper, through differential carrier lifetime measurements\non commercialized near-UV, blue, and green LEDs, their different efficiency\ndroop behaviors are attributed to different carrier lifetimes, which are\nprolonged as wavelength increases. This relationship between carrier lifetime\nand indium composition of InGaN quantum well is believed owing to the\npolarization-induced quantum confinement Stark effect. Long carrier lifetime\nnot only increases the probability of carrier leakage, but also results in high\ncarrier concentration in quantum well. In other words, under the same current\ndensity, the carrier concentration in active region in near-UV LED is the\nlowest while that in green one is the highest. If considering the efficiency\ndroop depending on carrier concentration, the behaviors of LEDs with different\nwavelengths do not show any abnormality. The reason why the efficiency droop\nbecomes more serious under lower temperature can be also explained by this\nmodel as well. Based on this result, the possible solutions to conquer\nefficiency droop are discussed. It seems that decreasing the carrier lifetime\nis a fundamental approach to solve the problem.\n", "  A striking prediction of several extensions of the constituent quark model,\nincluding the unquenched quark model, the pion cloud model and the chiral quark\nmodel, is a proportionality relationship between the quark sea asymmetry and\nthe orbital angular momentum of the proton. We investigate to which extent a\nrelationship of this kind is corroborated by the experiment, through a\nsystematic comparison between expectations based on models and predictions\nobtained from a global analysis of hard-scattering data in perturbative Quantum\nChromodynamics. We find that the data allows the angular momentum of the proton\nto be proportional to its sea asymmetry, though with a rather large range of\nthe optimal values of the proportionality coefficient. Typical values do not\nenable us to discriminate among expectations based on different models. In\norder to make our comparison conclusive, the extrapolation uncertainties on the\nproportionality coefficient should be reduced, hopefully by means of accurate\nmeasurements in the region of small proton momentum fractions, where the data\nis currently lacking. Nevertheless, the unquenched quark model predicts that\nquarks account for a proton spin fraction much larger than that accepted by the\nconventional wisdom. We explicitly demonstrate that such a discrepancy can be\nreabsorbed in the unknown extrapolation region, without affecting the\ndescription of current data, by imposing the unquenched quark model expectation\nas a boundary condition in the analysis of the data itself. We delineate how\nthe experimental programs at current and future facilities may shed light on\nthe region of small momentum fractions.\n", "  In AM CVn binaries, a white dwarf primary accretes material from a\nhelium-rich white dwarf or stellar companion. The unstable ignition of nuclear\nburning via the $3\\alpha$ reaction in an accumulated helium layer powers a\nthermonuclear runaway near accretion rates $\\dot{M} \\lesssim 10^{-6} \\,\n\\mathrm{M_{\\odot} \\ yr^{-1}}$ that may be observed as helium nova or .Ia\nsupernova. Helium burning in the primary's envelope at temperatures $T \\lesssim\n10^{8} \\, \\mathrm{K}$ may proceed via the direct three-body fusion of\n$\\alpha$-particles. Here we show that the direct three-body rate by Nguyen et\nal. (2012) -- which is reduced relative to the extrapolated resonant rate at\ntemperatures $T \\gtrsim 5 \\times 10^{7} \\, \\mathrm{K}$ -- results in novae with\nlonger recurrence times and larger ignition masses. By contrast, we find that\nthe enhancement in the direct three-body rate at temperatures below $T \\lesssim\n5 \\times 10^{7} \\, \\mathrm{K}$ does not result in significant differences in\nnova outburst properties. The most massive envelopes in our models are near the\ndensity threshold for detonation of the helium layer, where an increase in the\ndensity at ignition due to the $3\\alpha$ rate may be important.\n", "  The mass function of freshly formed star clusters is empirically often\ndescribed as a power law. However the cluster mass function of populations of\nyoung clusters over the scale of a galaxy has been found to be described by a\nSchechter-function. Here we address this apparent discrepancy. We assume that\nin an annulus of an isolated self- regulated radially-exponential\naxially-symmetric disk galaxy, the local mass function of very young (embedded)\nclusters is a power law with an upper mass limit which depends on the local\nstar formation rate density. Radial integration of this mass function yields a\ngalaxy-wide embedded cluster mass function. This integrated embedded cluster\nmass function has a Schechter-type form, which results from the addition of\nmany low mass clusters forming at all galactocentric distances and rarer\nmassive clusters only forming close to the center of the galaxy.\n", "  Spectra of sparse non-Hermitian random matrices determine the dynamics of\ncomplex processes on graphs. Eigenvalue outliers in the spectrum are of\nparticular interest, since they determine the stationary state and the\nstability of dynamical processes. We present a general and exact theory for the\neigenvalue outliers of random matrices with a local tree structure. For\nadjacency and Laplacian matrices of oriented random graphs, we derive\nanalytical expressions for the eigenvalue outliers, the first moments of the\ndistribution of eigenvector elements associated with an outlier, the support of\nthe spectral density, and the spectral gap. We show that these spectral\nobservables obey universal expressions, which hold for a broad class of\noriented random matrices.\n", "  A key challenge in understanding the feedback mechanism of AGN in Brightest\nCluster Galaxies (BCGs) is the inherent rarity of catching an AGN during its\nstrong outburst phase. This is exacerbated by the ambiguity of differentiating\nbetween AGN and clusters in X-ray observations. If there is evidence for an AGN\nthen the X-ray emission is commonly assumed to be dominated by the AGN\nemission, introducing a selection effect against the detection of AGN in BCGs.\nIn order to recover these 'missing' clusters, we systematically investigate the\ncolour-magnitude relation around some ~3500 ROSAT All Sky Survey selected AGN,\nlooking for signs of a cluster red sequence. Amongst our 22 candidate systems,\nwe independently rediscover several confirmed systems, where a strong AGN\nresides in a central galaxy. We compare the X-ray luminosity to red sequence\nrichness distribution of our AGN candidate systems with that of a similarly\nselected comparison sample of ~1000 confirmed clusters and identify seven\n'best' candidates (all of which are BL Lac objects), where the X-ray flux is\nlikely to be a comparable mix between cluster and AGN emission. We confirm that\nthe colours of the red sequence are consistent with the redshift of the AGN,\nthat the colours of the AGN host galaxy are consistent with AGN, and, by\ncomparing their luminosities with those from our comparison clusters, confirm\nthat the AGN hosts are consistent with BCGs.\n", "  Using the AdS/CFT duality, we study the destruction of a rotating heavy\nquarkonium due to the entropice force in $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory and a\nconfining YM theory. It is shown that in both theories increasing the angular\nvelocity leads to decreasing the entropic force. This result implies that the\nrotating quarkonium dissociates harder than the static case.\n", "  In this work, the relationship between Carnot engine and Szil\\'ard engine was\ndiscussed. By defining the available information about the temperature\ndifference between two heat reservoirs, the Carnot engine was found to have a\nsame physical essence with Szil\\'ard engine: lossless conversion of available\ninformation. Thus, a generalized Carnot's theorem for wider scope of\napplication can be described as \"all the available information is 100% coded\ninto work\".\n", "  We describe magnetic field sensor based on spin wave interferometer. Its\nsensing element consists of a magnetic cross junction with four micro-antennas\nfabricated at the edges. Two of these antennas are used for spin wave\nexcitation and two others antennas are used for the detection of the inductive\nvoltage produced by the interfering spin waves. Two waves propagating in the\northogonal arms of the cross may accumulate significantly different phase\nshifts depending on the magnitude and the direction of the external magnetic\nfield. This phenomenon is utilized for magnetic field sensing. The sensitivity\nhas maximum at the destructive interference condition, where a small change of\nthe external magnetic field results in a drastic increase of the inductive\nvoltage as well as the change of the output phase. We report experimental data\nobtained on a micrometer scale Y3Fe2(FeO4)3 cross structure. The change of the\ninductive voltage near the destructive interference point exceeds 40 dB per 1\nOe. At the same time, the phase of the output exhibit a {\\pi}-phase shift\nwithin 1 Oe. The data are collected for three different orientations of the\nsensor in magnetic field at room temperature. Taking into account low thermal\nnoise in ferrite structures, the maximum sensitivity of spin wave magnetometer\nmay exceed atta Tesla. Other appealing advantages include compactness, fast\ndata acquisition and wide temperature operating range. The physical limits of\nspin wave interferometers are also discussed.\n", "  We demonstrate pixelation-free real-time widefield endoscopic imaging through\nan aperiodic multicore fiber (MCF) without any distal opto-mechanical elements\nor proximal scanners. Exploiting the memory effect in MCFs the images in our\nsystem are directly obtained without any post-processing using a static\nwavefront correction obtained from a single calibration procedure. Our approach\nallows for video-rate 3D widefield imaging of incoherently illuminated objects\nwith imaging speed not limited by the wavefront shaping device refresh rate.\n", "  We study the influence of the energy spectrum on the extent of the cascade\nrange of a passive tracer in turbulent flows. The interesting cases are when\nthere are two different spectra over the potential range of the tracer cascade\n(in 2D when the tracer forcing is in the inverse energy cascade range, and in\n3D when the Schmidt number Sc is large). The extent of the tracer cascade range\nis then limited by the width of the range for the shallower of the two energy\nspectra. Nevertheless, we show that in dimension $d=2,3$ the tracer cascade\nrange extends (up to a logarithm) to $\\kappa_{d\\text{D}}^{p}$, where\n$\\kappa_{d\\text{D}}$ is the wavenumber beyond which diffusion should dominate\nand $p$ is arbitrarily close to 1, provided Sc is larger than a certain power\n(depending on $p$) of the Grashof number. We also derive estimates which\nsuggest that in 2D, for Sc${}\\sim1$ a wide tracer cascade can coexist with a\nsignificant inverse energy cascade at Grashof numbers large enough to produce a\nturbulent flow.\n", "  Nucleation is an activated process in which the system has to overcome a free\nenergy barrier in order for a first-order phase transition between the\nmetastable and the stable phases to take place. In the liquid-to-solid\ntransition the process occurs between phases of different symmetry, and it is\nthus inherently a multi-dimensional process, in which all symmetries are broken\nat the transition. In this Focus Article, we consider some recent studies which\nhighlight the multi-dimensional nature of the nucleation process. Even for a\nsingle-component system, the formation of solid crystals from the metastable\nmelt involves fluctuations of two (or more) order parameters, often associated\nwith the decoupling of positional and orientational symmetry breaking. In other\nwords, we need at least two order parameters to describe the free-energy of a\nsystem including its liquid and crystalline states. This decoupling occurs\nnaturally for asymmetric particles or directional interactions, focusing here\non the case of water, but we will show that it also affects spherically\nsymmetric interacting particles, such as the hard-sphere system. We will show\nhow the treatment of nucleation as a multi-dimensional process has shed new\nlight on the process of polymorph selection, on the effect of external fields\non the nucleation process, and on glass-forming ability.\n", "  This is an initial study of the longitudinal, single-bunch stability in the\nproposed FACET-II e+ damping ring. It is preliminary because many vacuum\nchamber objects of the ring have not yet been designed.\n", "  We present the first flexion-focused gravitational lensing analysis of the\nfirst of the strong-lensing \"cosmic telescope\" galaxy clusters, observed as\npart of the Hubble Frontier Fields initiative. Using HST observations of Abell\n2744 (z = 0.308), we apply a modified Analytic Image Model (AIM) technique to\nmeasure source galaxy flexion and shear values at a final number density of 82\narcmin$^{-2}$. By using flexion data alone we are able to identify the primary\nmass structure aligned along the heart of the cluster in addition to a major\nsubstructure peak offset 1.43' from the cluster core. We generate two types of\nnonparametric reconstructions: a flexion aperture mass map, which identifies\nthe central potential and substructure peak with mass signal-to-noise of\n3.5$\\sigma$ and 2.3$\\sigma$ respectively; and a convergence map derived\ndirectly from the smoothed flexion field. For the primary peak we find a mass\nof $1.93\\times10^{14}\\,h^{-1}\\,M_{\\odot}$ within a 45\" (145h$^{-1}$ kpc)\naperture, and for the western substructure we find a mass of\n$7.12\\times10^{13}\\,h^{-1}\\,M_{\\odot}$ within a 25\" (80h$^{-1}$ kpc) aperture.\nThe associated peak velocity dispersions were determined to be $\\sigma_v$ =\n1630 km/s and $\\sigma_v$ = 766 km/s, respectively, by fitting nonsingular\nisothermal sphere profiles to the flexion data. Additionally, we use\nsimultaneous shear measurements to independently reconstruct the broader\ncluster mass structure, and find that it is unable to reproduce the small-scale\nstructure associated with the flexion reconstructions. Finally, we perform the\nsame analysis on the Abell 2744 parallel sky field, and find no strong phantom\nsignals in the noise reconstructions.\n", "  We study full QCD at finite density and low temperature with light quark mass\nusing the complex Langevin method. Since the singular drift problem turns out\nto be mild on a $4^3 \\times 8$ lattice we use, the gauge cooling is performed\nonly to control the unitarity norm in this exploratory study. We report on our\npreliminary data obtained from the complex Langevin simulation up to certain\nLangevin time. While the data are still noisy due to lack of statistics, the\nonset of the baryon number density seems to occur at larger $\\mu$ than half the\npion mass, which is the value for the phase quenched QCD. The validity of our\nsimulation is tested by the recently proposed criterion based on the\nprobability distribution of the drift term.\n", "  The two-Higgs-doublet model contains extra Higgs bosons, with mass ranges\nspanning from several hundred GeV to about 1 TeV. We study the possible\nexperimental searches for the neutral Higgs bosons of $A$ and $H$ at the future\nhigh-luminosity LHC runs. Besides of the conventional search modes that are\ninspired by the supersymmetric models, we discuss two search modes which were\nnot quite addressed previously. They are the decay modes of $A\\to hZ$ and $A/H\n\\to t \\bar t$. Thanks to the technique of tagging boosted objects of SM-like\nHiggs bosons and top quarks, we show the improved mass reaches for heavy\nneutral Higgs bosons with masses up to $\\sim{\\cal O}(1)\\,\\TeV$. The modes\nproposed here are complementary to the conventional experimental searches\nmotivated by the MSSM.\n", "  We consider the design of a haloscope experiment (ORGAN) to probe for axions\nat 26.6 GHz. The motivation for this search is to perform the first direct test\nof a result which claims a possible axion signal at this frequency. There are\nmany technical issues and optimisations that must be considered in the design\nof a high mass axion haloscope. We discuss the current status of the ORGAN\nexperiment, as well as its future. We also discuss low mass axion haloscopes\nemploying lumped 3D LC resonators.\n", "  The interference between radiation fields superposed appropriately contains\nall available information about the source. This will be recapitulated for\ncoherent and incoherent fields. We will further analyze a new kind of twisted\n3D interferometer which allows us to generate interferograms with high\ninformation content. The physical basis for these devices is the geometric\nparallel transport of electric fields along a 3D path in space. This concept\nenables us to build very compact 3D interferometers.\n", "  We present the theoretical investigation of the single walled carbon\nnanotubes (SWNTs) as the heating agent of photothermal therapy. In our model,\nthe SWNT is modeled by rigid tube surrounded by cancer cells. In this model, we\nneglect the angle dependence of temperature and assume that the length of SWNT\nis much longer than the radius of tube. We calculated the temperature rise of\nthe SWNT and its surrounding cancer cells during the laser heating by solving\none-dimensional heat conduction equation in steady state condition. We found\nthat the maximum temperature is located at the interface between SWNT and\ncancer cells. This maximum temperature is proportional to the square of SWNTs\ndiameter and diameter of SWNTs depends on their chirality. These results extend\nour understanding of the temperature distribution in SWNT during the laser\nheating process and provide the suggested specification of SWNT for the\nimprovement the photothermal therapy in the future.\n", "  Spontaneous pair production from background fields or spacetimes is one of\nthe most prominent phenomena predicted by quantum field theory. The Schwinger\nmechanism of production of charged pairs by a strong electric field and the\nHawking radiation of all species of particles from a black hole are the\nconsequence of nonperturbative quantum effects. In this review article, the\nvacuum structure and pair production is reviewed in the in-out formalism, which\nprovides a consistent framework for quantum field theory in the sense that the\ncomplex action explains not only the vacuum persistence but also pair\nproduction. The current technology of intense lasers is still lower by a few\norder than the Schwinger limit for electron-positron pair production, while\nmagnetic fields of magnetars on the surface are higher than the Schwinger limit\nand even higher at the core. On the other hand, the zero effective mass of\nelectron and hole in graphene and Dirac or Weyl semimetals will open a window\nfor experimental test of quantum electrodynamics (QED) phenomena in strong\nfields.\n", "  In this contribution we report on the calculation of the next-to-leading\norder (NLO) QCD corrections to the hadro-production of heavy neutral Higgs\nbosons and their decay into top-quark pairs within the type-II\ntwo-Higgs-doublet extension of the standard model (SM). We take into account\nthe contributions from resonant Higgs boson production, the non-resonant SM\n$t\\bar{t}$ background as well as the interference of these two contributions.\nThe NLO corrections to the signal and interference contributions are calculated\nby applying the heavy top-quark mass ($m_t$) limit including an effective\nrescaling. In our NLO calculation the QCD-Higgs interference is evaluated in\nthe resonance region that provides the dominant part of the heavy Higgs-boson\ncontributions. Evaluating representative $CP$-conserving and $CP$-violating\nparameter scenarios within the two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) we present\nresults for different distributions and, in addition, for observables that\ndepend on the top-quark spin.\n", "  A systematic experimental and theoretical study about substrate induced\nmolecular conformation in rubrene thin films by varying film thickness from\nsub-monolayer to multilayer, which currently attracts substantial attention\nwith regard to its application in organic electronics, is performed. The clean\npolycrystalline Au and Ag were used as noble-metals, whereas, H passivated and\nSiO2 terminated Si (100) were used as dielectric substrates. Angle dependent\nnear edge x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (NEXAFS) was employed to\nunderstand the molecular conformation whereas atomic force microscopy (AFM) was\nused to investigate the surface morphologies of the films. X-ray absorption\nspectra (XAS) of rubrene molecules with flat and twisted conformations were\ncalculated using density functional theory (DFT). All the observed NEXAFS\nspectra of rubrene thin films at various thicknesses and onto different\nsubstrates were explained in terms of different combination of the spectral\nintensity from the twisted and the flat molecules. In contrast to general\nfindings, comparatively rough polycrystalline Ag surface is found to support\ngrowth of better quality rubrene films. The results have important implications\nfor the understanding of the substrate induced molecular conformations in\nrubrene thin films with its thickness and are beneficial for the improvement of\nthe device performance.\n", "  Mean-field energy-level shifts arising as a result of strong electrostatic\ndipole interactions within dilute gases of polarized helium Rydberg atoms have\nbeen probed by microwave spectroscopy. The Rydberg states studied had principal\nquantum numbers $n=70$ and 72, and electric dipole moments of up to 14050 D,\nand were prepared in pulsed supersonic beams at particle number densities on\nthe order of $10^{8}$ cm$^{-3}$. Comparisons of the experimental data with the\nresults of Monte Carlo calculations highlight effects of the distribution of\nnearest-neighbor spacings in the pulsed supersonic beams, and the dielectric\nproperties of the strongly polarized Rydberg gases, on the microwave spectra.\nThese observations reflect the emergence of macroscopic electrical properties\nof the atomic samples when strongly polarized.\n", "  The so-called flyby anomaly has encouraged several authors to analyze in\ndetail the minor perturbative contributions to the trajectory of spacecraft\nperforming a flyby manoeuvre. This anomaly consist of an unexplained increase\nor decrease of the asymptotic velocity of the spacecraft after a flyby of the\nEarth in the range of a few mm per second. Some order of magnitude estimations\nhave been performed in recent years to dismiss many possible conventional\neffects as the source of such an anomaly but no explanation has been found yet.\nIn this paper we perform a study of the perturbation induced by ocean tides in\na flybying spacecraft by considering the time dependence of the location of the\nhigh tide as the Moon follows its orbit. We show that this effect implies a\nchange of the spacecraft velocity of a few micrometers per second.\n  We also consider the coupling of tesseral harmonics inhomogeneities and the\nrotation of the Earth and its impact of the spacecraft outgoing velocity.\nSignificant corrections to the observed asymptotic velocities are found in this\ncase but neither their sign nor their magnitude coincide with the anomalies.\nSo, we can also rule this out as a conventional explanation.\n", "  A total of 5 different half-Heusler alloys, two p-type and two n-type with\nthe fifth a charge compensated alloy have been designed and synthesized. The\nthermophysical properties of these alloys have been investigated in the range\n10 K to 1000 K while the magnetic behavior has been studied up to 300 K. The\nelectrical resistivity of all the alloys varies within the range 0.06 to 5\nm{\\Omega} cm indicating that they are in the degenerate semiconductor limits.\nThe temperature dependence of p-type alloys exhibits a transition from metallic\nto semiconducting behavior, typical of topological insulators. The transition\nis found to occur in the range 300 K to 500 K. The n-type and compensated\nalloys exhibit a weak metallic behavior in the complete temperature range. The\nSeebeck coefficient in the p-type alloys increases with temperature reaching a\nmaximum value of 50 microV K-1 while that of the n-type alloys increases\ncontinuously reaching a value of 45 microV K-1 at ~ 800 K. The corresponding\npower factor of the n-type alloy reaches 900 microW m-1 K-2 at ~ 900 K compared\nto a maximum of ~ 250 microW m-1 K-2 at 700 K for the p-type alloy.\nMagnetically the p-type and n-type alloys are found to be paramagnetic while\nthe compensated alloy exhibits a ferromagnetic behavior.\n", "  Single phase Ni substituted LiCo1-xNixO2 solid solutions with x < 0.15 have\nbeen synthesized to study the effect of substitution on the magnetic behavior.\nTwo different techniques, magnetic susceptibility and electron paramagnetic\nresonance, EPR which provide information in two different time windows have\nbeen used. The solid solutions have been found to be single phase with large\ngrains conforming to R-3m rhombohedral structure. The lattice parameters c and\na increase with increasing Ni substitution but with a nearly constant c/a ratio\nof about 4.99 in all the cases indicating that the CoO6 and LiO6 octahedra do\nnot undergo any Jahn-Teller distortions. The room temperature EPR absorption\nspectra clearly shows a peak in all the compounds at a field of 314 mT\ncorresponding to a g-factor of 2.14. The peak width however is found to be a\nstrong function of Ni substitution; increasing with increasing Ni from 3.6 mT\nto 6.5 mT for x = 0.08. The magnetization increases with decreasing temperature\nin all the compounds, a paramagnetic behavior, unlike Li-deficient compounds\nwhich show a Pauli paramagnetic susceptibility. Also, the magnetization\nexhibits thermal irreversibility which vanishes at large magnetic fields in all\nthe compounds. The unsubstituted compound has discontinuities at 200 K and 50 K\ncorresponding to magnetic transitions which disappear on substitution with 2 %\nNi for Co. The effective magnetic moment is found to increase from 0.32 Bohr\nmagnetons to 0.66 Bohr magnetons on increasing the substitution to 0.15. The\nunique feature however is that all the compounds exhibit a clear magnetic\nhysteresis at room temperature with a finite coercivity. The coercivity\nincreases from 31 Oe to 168 Oe for x = 0.04 and then decreases on further\nincreasing of x. A deconvolution of the hysteresis loops clearly shows an\nincreasing paramagnetic component with substitution.\n", "  A comparative study of the structural, microstructural and magnetic\nproperties of CrO$_2$ thin films grown onto (110) and (100) TiO$_2$ rutile\nsingle crystal substrates by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), using CrO$_3$ as\nchromium precursor and either oxygen or argon as carrier gas is presented. Our\nresults show that growth under argon carrier gas leads to high quality CrO$_2$\nepilayers with structural and magnetic properties similar to those obtained\nusing the more standard oxygen carrier gas. Furthermore, we interpret the\nlarger magnetic coercivity observed for the (110) oriented films in terms of\ntheir microstructure, in particular of the highest strain and edge roughness of\nthe building structures of the CrO$_2$ epilayers, which are settled by the\nsubstrate crystallographic orientation.\n", "  The polarization properties of extragalactic radio sources at frequencies\nhigher than 20 GHz are still poorly constrained. However, their\ncharacterization would provide invaluable information about the physics of the\nemission processes and is crucial to estimate their contamination as\nforegrounds of the polarized cosmic microwave background (CMB) angular power\nspectrum on scales < 30 arcmin. In this contribution, after summarizing the\nstate-of-the-art of polarimetric observations in the millimetric wavelength\nbands, we present our observations of a complete sample of 53 sources with S >\n200 mJy (at 20 GHz) carried out with the Australia Telescope Compact Array\nbetween 5.5 and 38 GHz. The analysis clearly shows that polarization properties\ncannot be simply inferred from total intensity ones, as the spectral behaviors\nof the two signals are typically different.\n", "  Magnetic resonance imaging technique known as DWI (diffusion-weighted\nimaging) allows measurement of water diffusivity on a pixel basis for\nevaluating pathology throughout the body and is now routinely incorporated into\nmany body MRI protocols, mainly in oncology. Indeed water molecules motion\nreflects the interactions with other molecules, membranes, cells, and in\ngeneral the interactions with the environment. Microstructural changes as e.g.\ncellular organization and/or integrity then affect the motion of water\nmolecules, and consequently alter the water diffusion properties measured by\nDWI. Then DWI technique can be used to extract information about tissue\norganization at the cellular level indirectly from water motion. In general the\nsignal intensity in DWI can be quantified by using a parameter known as ADC\n(Apparent Diffusion Coefficient) emphasizing that it is not the real diffusion\ncoefficient, which is a measure of the average water molecular motion. In the\nsimplest models, the distribu- tion of a water molecule diffusing in a certain\nperiod of time is considered to have a Gaussian form with its width\nproportional to the ADC. However, water in biological structures often displays\nnon-Gaussian diffusion behavior, consequently the DWI signal shows a more\ncomplex behavior that need to be modeled following different approaches. In\nthis work we explore the possibility to quantify the degree to which water\ndiffusion in biologic tissues is non-Gaussian introducing the AKC parameter\n(Apparent Kurtosis Coefficient). In this work we have realized DWI non-Gaussian\ndiffusion maps to be used in the clinical routine along with standard ADC maps,\ngiving to the radiologist another tool to explore how much structure inside a\nvoxel is organized. In particular in this work some prostate DWI examples have\nbeen analyzed and will be shown.\n", "  Multiple oscillation frequencies separated by close to or less than the\nformal frequency resolution of a data set are a serious problem in the\nfrequency analysis of time series data. We present a new and fully automated\nBayesian approach that searches for close frequencies in time series data and\nassesses their significance by comparison to no signal and a mono-periodic\nsignal. We extensively test the approach with synthetic data sets and apply it\nto the 156 days-long high-precision BRITE photometry of the SPB star HD 201433,\nfor which we find a sequence of nine statistically significant rotationally\nsplit dipole modes.\n", "  Nanoscale chiral skyrmions in noncentrosymmetric helimagnets are promising\nbinary state variables in high-density, low-energy nonvolatile memory.\nSkyrmions are ubiquitous as an ordered, single-domain lattice phase, which\nmakes it difficult to write information unless they are spatially broken up\ninto smaller units, each representing a bit. Thus, the formation and\nmanipulation of skyrmion lattice domains is a prerequisite for memory\napplications. Here, using an imaging technique based on resonant magnetic x-ray\ndiffraction, we demonstrate the mapping and manipulation of skyrmion lattice\ndomains in Cu2OSeO3. The material is particularly interesting for applications\nowing to its insulating nature, allowing for electric field-driven domain\nmanipulation.\n", "  To accurately quantify the effect of solar proton events (SPEs) on the\natmosphere requires a good estimate of the particle energy deposition in the\nmiddle atmosphere (60- 100 km) and how the energy is distributed globally.\nProtons in the energy range 1-20MeV, depositing their energy in the middle\natmosphere, are subject to more complex dynamics with strong day-night\nasymmetries compared to higher-energy particles. Our study targets six SPEs\nfrom 2003 to 2012. By using measurements from the Medium Energy Proton and\nElectron Detector on all available Polar Orbit Environment Satellites (POES),\nwe show that in the main phase of geomagnetic storms the dayside cutoff\nlatitudes are pushed poleward, while the nightside cutoff latitudes have the\nopposite response, resulting in strong day-night asymmetries in the energy\ndeposition. These features cannot bemeasured by the frequently used\nGeostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES). Assuming that the\nprotons impact the polar atmosphere homogeneously above a fixed nominal\nlatitude boundary will therefore give a significant overestimate of the energy\ndeposited in the middle atmosphere during SPEs. We discuss the magnetospheric\nmechanisms responsible for the local time response in the cutoff latitudes and\nprovide a simple applicable parameterization which includes both dayside and\nnightside cutoff latitude variability using only the Dst, the northward\ncomponent of the interplanetary magnetic field, and solar wind pressure. The\nparameterization is utilized on the GOES particle fluxes, and the resulting\nenergy deposition successfully captures the day-night asymmetry in good\nagreement with the energy deposition predicted from the POES measurement.\n", "  We propose further conformal parametrizations for initial data in some\nmodified Einstein gravity theories. Some of them give rise to conformally\ncovariant systems.\n", "  A natural avenue to extend the Standard Model (SM) is to embed it into a more\nsymmetric framework. Here, I focus in Left-Right (LR) Models, which treat left-\nand right-handed chiralities on equal footing. Important information about the\nstructure of LR Models comes from meson-mixing observables. Due to the impact\nof the new contributions to these processes, I consider the calculation of the\nshort-distance QCD effects correcting the LR Model contributions to\nmeson-mixing observables at the Next-to-Leading Order. I then revisit the\nphenomenology of a simple realization of LR Models, containing doublet scalars,\nand combine in a global fit electroweak precision observables, direct searches\nof the new gauge bosons and meson oscillation observables, a task performed\nwithin the CKMfitter statistical framework. Finally, I also cover a different\nissue, namely the modeling of theoretical uncertainties, a class of\nuncertainties specially important for flavour physics. Different frequentist\nschemes are compared, and their differences are illustrated with\nflavour-oriented examples.\n", "  The zoology of singularities for Lorentzian manifold is slightly more\ncomplicated than for Riemannian manifolds. Our present work study\nCauchy-compact globally hyperbolic singular flat spacetimes with extreme\nBTZ-like singular lines. We use the notion of BTZ-extension of a singular\nspacetime introduced in a previous paper to give a description of Moduli spaces\nof such manifolds in term of common Teichm{\\\"u}ller spaces. This description is\nused to construct convex polyhedral cauchy-surface in Cauchy-compact flat\nspacetimes with BTZ.\n", "  The demand for ever-increasing density of information storage and speed of\nmanipulation boosts an intense search for new magnetic materials and novel ways\nof controlling the magnetic bit. Here, we report the synthesis of a\nferromagnetic photovoltaic CH$_3$NH$_3$(Mn:Pb)I$_3$ material in which the\nphoto-excited electrons rapidly melt the local magnetic order through the\nRuderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interactions without heating up the spin system.\nOur finding offers an alternative, very simple and efficient way of optical\nspin control, and opens an avenue for applications in low power, light\ncontrolling magnetic devices.\n", "  We demonstrate the suppression of crosstalk between two dielectric\nnanowaveguides by placing an auxiliary linear waveguide between loaded\nwaveguides spaced by one wavelength. The total cross-sectional dimension of the\nsystem containing two transmission lines is less than two microns that is\nhundred times smaller than a cross-section of a system made of dielectric\nfiber. The propagating modes in these waveguides are the sum and the difference\nof symmetric and antisymmetric modes of the coupled system. Crosstalk is\nsuppressed by matching the wavenumbers of these modes. The analytically\nobtained results are confirmed by numerical simulation.\n", "  The quantum thermal bath (QTB) has been presented as analternative to\npath-integral-based methods to introduce nuclear quantumeffects in molecular\ndynamics simulations. The method has proved to beefficient, yielding accurate\nresults for various systems. However, the QTBmethod is prone to zero-point\nenergy leakage (ZPEL) in highly anharmonicsystems. This is a well-known problem\nin methods based on classicaltrajectories where part of the energy of the\nhigh-frequency modes istransferred to the low-frequency modes leading to a\nwrong energydistribution. In some cases, the ZPEL can have dramatic\nconsequences onthe properties of the system. Thus, we investigate the ZPEL by\ntesting theQTB method on selected systems with increasing complexity in order\nto studythe conditions and the parameters that influence the leakage. We also\nanalyze the consequences of the ZPEL on the structuraland vibrational\nproperties of the system. We find that the leakage is particularly dependent on\nthe damping coefficient and thatincreasing its value can reduce and, in some\ncases, completely remove the ZPEL. When using sufficiently high values for\nthedamping coefficient, the expected energy distribution among the vibrational\nmodes is ensured. In this case, the QTB methodgives very encouraging results.\nIn particular, the structural properties are well-reproduced. The dynamical\nproperties should beregarded with caution although valuable information can\nstill be extracted from the vibrational spectrum, even for large values ofthe\ndamping term.\n", "  Monte Carlo simulations of lattice quantum field theories on Lefschetz\nthimbles are non trivial. We discuss a new Monte Carlo algorithm based on the\nidea of computing contributions to the functional integral which come from\ncomplete flow lines. The latter are the steepest ascent paths attached to\ncritical points, i.e. the basic building blocks of thimbles. The measure to\nsample is thus dictated by the contribution of complete flow lines to the\npartition function. The algorithm is based on a heat bath sampling of the\ngaussian approximation of the thimble: this defines the proposals for a\nMetropolis-like accept/reject step. The effectiveness of the algorithm has been\ntested on a few models, e.g. the chiral random matrix model. We also discuss\nthimble regularization of gauge theories, and in particular the successfull\napplication to 0+1 dimensional QCD and the status and prospects for Yang-Mills\ntheories.\n", "  Phototaxis is an important reaction to light displayed by a wide range of\nmotile microorganisms. Flagellated eukaryotic microalgae in particular, like\nthe model organism Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, steer either towards or away from\nlight by a rapid and precisely timed modulation of their flagellar activity.\nCell steering, however, is only the beginning of a much longer process which\nultimately allows cells to determine their light exposure history. This process\nis not well understood. Here we present a first quantitative study of the long\ntimescale phototactic motility of Chlamydomonas at both single cell and\npopulation levels. Our results reveal that the phototactic strategy adopted by\nthese microorganisms leads to an efficient exposure to light, and that the\nphototactic response is modulated over typical timescales of tens of seconds.\nThe adaptation dynamics for phototaxis and chlorophyll fluorescence show a\nstriking quantitative agreement, suggesting that photosynthesis controls\nquantitatively how cells navigate a light field.\n", "  Feed-in fluctuations induced by renewables are one of the key challenges to\nthe stability and quality of electrical power grids. In particular short-term\nfluctuations disturb the system on a time scale, on which load balancing does\nnot operate yet and the system is intrinsically governed by self-organized\nsynchronization. Wind and solar power are known to be strongly non-Gaussian\nwith intermittent increment statistics in these time scales. We investigate the\nimpact of short-term wind fluctuations on the basis of a Kuramoto-like power\ngrid model considering stability in terms of desynchronization and frequency\nand voltage quality aspects. We compare intermittent feed-in with a realistic\npower spectrum, correlated Gaussian noise of the same spectrum, and Gaussian\nwhite noise. We found out that the likelihood of severe outages is mainly\ndetermined by the temporal correlation of the feed-in. The intermittent nature\nof wind power is transferred into frequency and voltage fluctuations. This\nestablishes a novel type of fluctuations with severe consequences on frequency\nand voltage quality, which are beyond engineering status of knowledge.\n", "  Since 1995, numerous close-in planets have been discovered around low-mass\nstars (M to A-type stars). These systems are susceptible to be tidally\nevolving, in particular the dissipation of the kinetic energy of tidal flows in\nthe host star may modify its rotational evolution and also shape the orbital\narchitecture of the surrounding planetary system. Recent theoretical studies\nhave shown that the amplitude of the stellar dissipation can vary over several\norders of magnitude as the star evolves, and that it also depends on the\nstellar mass and rotation. We present here one of the first studies of the\ndynamics of close-in planets orbiting low-mass stars (from $0.6~M_\\odot$ to\n$1.2~M_\\odot$) where we compute the simultaneous evolution of the star's\nstructure, rotation and tidal dissipation in its external convective envelope.\nWe demonstrate that tidal friction due to the stellar dynamical tide, i.e.\ntidal inertial waves (their restoring force is the Coriolis acceleration)\nexcited in the convection zone, can be larger by several orders of magnitude\nthan the one of the equilibrium tide currently used in celestial mechanics.\nThis is particularly true during the Pre Main Sequence (PMS) phase and to a\nlesser extent during the Sub Giant (SG) phase. Numerical simulations show that\nonly the high dissipation occurring during the PMS phase has a visible effect\non the semi-major axis of close-in planets. We also investigate the effect of\nthe metallicity of the star on the tidal evolution of planets. We find that the\nhigher the metallicity of the star, the higher the dissipation and the larger\nthe tidally-induced migration of the planet.\n", "  Low frequency turbulence in Saturn's magnetosheath is investigated using\nin-situ measurements of the Cassini spacecraft. Focus is put on the magnetic\nenergy spectra computed in the frequency range $\\sim[10^{-4}, 1]$Hz. A set of\n42 time intervals in the magnetosheath were analyzed and three main results\nthat contrast with known features of solar wind turbulence are reported: 1) The\nmagnetic energy spectra showed a $\\sim f^{-1}$ scaling at MHD scales followed\nby an $\\sim f^{-2.6}$ scaling at the sub-ion scales without forming the\nso-called inertial range; 2) The magnetic compressibility and the\ncross-correlation between the parallel component of the magnetic field and\ndensity fluctuations $ C(\\delta n,\\delta B_{||}) $ indicates the dominance of\nthe compressible magnetosonic slow-like modes at MHD scales rather than the\nAlfv\\'en mode; 3) Higher order statistics revealed a monofractal (resp.\nmultifractal) behaviour of the turbulent flow downstream of a\nquasi-perpendicular (resp. quasi-parallel) shock at the sub-ion scales.\nImplications of these results on theoretical modeling of space plasma\nturbulence are discussed.\n", "  Semileptonic decays provide an excellent environment for testing the Standard\nModel (SM). Violation of lepton universality would be a smoking gun for physics\nbeyond the SM. Using semi-tauonic $B$ decays, LHCb finds a value of\n$\\mathcal{R}(D^*) = \\mathcal{B}(\\bar{B}^0 \\to D^{*+} \\tau^{-}\n\\bar{\\nu}_{\\tau})/\\mathcal{B}(\\bar{B}^0 \\to D^{*+} \\mu^{-} \\bar{\\nu}_{\\mu}) =\n0.336 \\pm 0.027 \\rm{(stat)} \\pm 0.030 \\rm{(syst)}$, which is 2.1 standard\ndeviations larger than the value expected from the SM. Moreover, the\nmeasurement of the $CP$ asymmetry in mixing of $B_s^0$ mesons is highly\nsensitive to physics beyond the SM. This article presents the latest result on\nsemileptonic asymmetries; using the full Run 1 dataset, it is found that\n$a_{\\rm{sl}}^s = (0.39 \\pm 0.26 \\rm{(stat)} \\pm 0.20 \\rm{(syst)})\\%$, which is\nconsistent with the Standard Model.\n", "  In this paper we analyze the gravity model in the world passenger\nair-transport network. We show that in the standard form the model is\ninadequate to correctly describe the relationship between passenger flows and\ntypical geo-economic variables that characterize connected countries. We\npropose a model of transfer flights which allows to exploit these discrepancies\nto discover hidden subflows in the network. We illustrate its usefulness by\nretrieving the distance coefficient in the gravity model which is one of the\ndeterminants of the globalization process. Finally, we discuss the correctness\nof the presented approach by comparing the distance coefficient to several well\nknown economical events.\n", "  Here we present an strategy for the derivation of a time-dependent Dyson map\nwhich ensures simultaneously the unitarity of the time evolution and the\nobservability of a quasi-Hermitian Hamiltonian. The time-dependent Dyson map is\nderived through a constructed Schr\\\"{o}dinger-like equation governed by the\nnon-Hermitian Hamiltonian itself; despite its time-dependence our scheme\nensures the time-independence of the metric operator, a necessary condition for\nthe observability of the quasi-Hermitian Hamiltonian. As an illustrative\nexample we consider a driven Harmonic oscillator described by a time-dependent\nnon-Hermitian Hamiltonian. After computing the Dyson map and demonstrating the\ntime-independence of the associated metric operator, we successfully derive an\neigenvalue equation for this time-dependent Hamiltonian which enable us to\nanalyze the $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking process.\n", "  This article reviews the mechanical bidomain model, a mathematical\ndescription how the extracellular matrix and intracellular cytoskeleton are\ncoupled by integrin proteins. The fundamental hypothesis is that differences\nbetween intracellular and extracellular displacements drive\nmechanotransduction. A one-dimensional example illustrates the model, which is\nthen extended to two dimensions. In several cases the equations are solved\nanalytically, illustrating how displacements divide into two parts: monodomain\ndisplacements are identical in both spaces and therefore do not contribute to\nmechanotransduction, whereas bidomain displacements cause mechanotransduction.\nA new length constant depends on the intracellular and extracellular shear\nmoduli and the integrin spring constant, and bidomain effects often occur\nwithin a few length constants of the tissue edge. Numerical methods for solving\nthe model equations are being developed. Precursors to the model and potential\napplications are discussed. The bidomain model may be applicable to cardiac\nremodeling, blood vessel regulation, tissue engineering, stem cell\ndifferentiation, cancer biology, and development.\n", "  Direct quantitative correlations between the orbital order and\northorhombicity is achieved in a number of Fe-based superconductors of 122\nfamily. The former (orbital order) is calculated from first principles\nsimulations using experimentally determined doping and temperature dependent\nstructural parameters while the latter (the orthorhombicity) is taken from\nalready established experimental studies; when normalized, both the above\nquantities quantitatively corresponds to each other in terms of their doping as\nwell as temperature variations. This proves that the structural transition in\nFe-based materials is electronic in nature due to orbital ordering. An\nuniversal correlations among various structural parameters and electronic\nstructure are also obtained. Most remarkable among them is the mapping of two\nFe\\--Fe distances in the low temperature orthorhombic phase, with the band\nenergies E$_{d_{xz}}$, E$_{d_{yz}}$ of Fe at the high symmetry points of the\nBrillouin zone. The fractional co-ordinate $z_{As}$ of $As$ which essentially\ndetermines anion height is inversely (directly) proportional to Fe-As bond\ndistances (with exceptions of K doped BaFe$_2$As$_2$) for hole (electron) doped\nmaterials as a function of doping. On the other hand, Fe-As bond-distance is\nfound to be inversely (directly) proportional to the density of states at the\nFermi level for hole (electron) doped systems. Implications of these results to\ncurrent issues of Fe based superconductivity are discussed.\n", "  We present a comparison of the Gaia DR1 samples of pulsating variable stars -\nCepheids and RR Lyrae type - with the OGLE Collection of Variable Stars aiming\nat the characterization of the Gaia mission performance in the stellar\nvariability domain.\n  Out of 575 Cepheids and 2322 RR Lyrae candidates from the Gaia DR1 samples\nlocated in the OGLE footprint in the sky, 559 Cepheids and 2302 RR Lyrae stars\nare genuine pulsators of these types. The number of misclassified stars is low\nindicating reliable performance of the Gaia data pipeline.\n  The completeness of the Gaia DR1 samples of Cepheids and RR Lyrae stars is at\nthe level of 60-75% as compared to the OGLE Collection dataset. This level of\ncompleteness is moderate and may limit the applicability of the Gaia data in\nmany projects.\n", "  How do the topology and geometry of a tubular network affect the spread of\nparticles within fluid flows? We investigate patterns of effective dispersion\nin the hierarchical, biological transport network formed by Physarum\npolycephalum. We demonstrate that a change in topology - pruning in the\nforaging state - causes a large increase in effective dispersion throughout the\nnetwork. By comparison, changes in the hierarchy of tube radii result in\nsmaller and more localized differences. Pruned networks capitalize on Taylor\ndispersion to increase the dispersion capability.\n", "  We consider the algorithmic problem of community detection in networks. Given\nan undirected friendship graph $G=\\left(V,E\\right)$, a subset $S\\subseteq V$ is\nan $\\left(\\alpha,\\beta\\right)$-community if:\n  * Every member of the community is friends with an $\\alpha$-fraction of the\ncommunity;\n  * Every non-member is friends with at most a $\\beta$-fraction of the\ncommunity.\n  Arora et al [AGSS12] gave a quasi-polynomial time algorithm for enumerating\nall the $\\left(\\alpha,\\beta\\right)$-communities for any constants\n$\\alpha>\\beta$.\n  Here, we prove that, assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH),\nquasi-polynomial time is in fact necessary - and even for a much weaker\napproximation desideratum. Namely, distinguishing between:\n  * $G$ contains an $\\left(1,o\\left(1\\right)\\right)$-community; and\n  * $G$ does not contain an\n$\\left(\\beta+o\\left(1\\right),\\beta\\right)$-community for any\n$\\beta\\in\\left[0,1\\right]$.\n  We also prove that counting the number of\n$\\left(1,o\\left(1\\right)\\right)$-communities requires quasi-polynomial time\nassuming the weaker #ETH.\n", "  In metal organic vapor phase epitaxy of GaN, the growth mode is sensitive to\nreactor temperature. In this study, V-pit-shaped GaN has been grown on normal\nc-plane cone-patterned sapphire substrate by decreasing the growth temperature\nof high-temperature-GaN to around 950 oC, which leads to the 3-dimensional\ngrowth of GaN. The so-called \"WM\" well describes the shape that the bottom of\nGaN V-pit is just right over the top of sapphire cone, and the regular\narrangement of V-pits follows the patterns of sapphire substrate strictly. Two\ntypes of semipolar facets (1101) and (1122) expose on sidewalls of V-pits.\nFurthermore, by raising the growth temperature to 1000 oC, the growth mode of\nGaN can be transferred to 2-demonsional growth. Accordingly, the size of V-pits\nbecomes smaller and the area of c-plane GaN becomes larger, while the total\nthickness of GaN keeps almost unchanged during this process. As long as the\n2-demonsional growth lasts, the V-pits will disappear and only flat c-plane GaN\nremains. This means the area ratio of c-plane and semipolar plane GaN can be\ncontrolled by the duration time of 2-demonsional growth.\n", "  Confluent populations of elongated cells give rise to ordered patterns seen\nin nematic phase liquid crystals. We correlate cell elongation and\nintercellular distance with intercellular alignment using an amorphous spin\nglass model. We compare in vitro time-lapse imaging with Monte Carlo simulation\nresults by framing a novel hard ellipses model in terms of Boltzmann\nstatistics. Furthermore, we find a statistically distinct alignment energy at\nquasi-steady state among fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and pluripotent cell\npopulations when cultured in vitro. These findings have important implications\nin both non-invasive clinical screening of the stem cell differentiation\nprocess and in relating shape parameters to coupling in active crystal systems\nsuch as nematic cell monolayers.\n", "  Full functional and performance tests were performed many times before the\nHard X-ray Modulation Telescope (HXMT) launch. During one of the tests, the\ncount rate curves of the 18 High Energy Detectors (HED) have been found\nincreased consistently within an interval of time. A further study on the\ncorrelation between the count rate and rainfall was carried out,and the\nincreased net spectrum was also analyzed. The analysis results indicate that\nthe short-lived 222Rn decay products (214Pb and 214Bi) in rainwater were\nresponsible for the transient changes of the background radiation spectra in\nHEDs. The results show that the HXMT/HEDs have a good detection sensitivity on\nX/gamma rays, and the detector calibration results are effective.\n", "  The star KIC 8462852 shows a very unusual and hard to comprehend light curve.\nThe dip d7922 absorbs 16% of the starlight. The light curve is unusually smooth\nbut the very steep edges make it hard to find a simple natural explanation by\ncovering due to comets or other well-known planetary objects. We describe a\nmathematical approximation to the light curve, which is motivated by a\nphysically meaningful event of a large stellar beam which generates an orbiting\ncloud. The data might fit to the science fiction idea of star lifting, a mining\ntechnology that could extract star matter. We extend the model to d1519 and\nd1568 using multiple beams and get an encouraging result that fits essential\nparts of the dips but misses other parts of the measured flux. We recommend\nfurther exploration of this concept with refined models.\n", "  I discuss minimally doubled fermions fermions as an ultra-local formulation\non the lattice for sea quarks that realize a non-singlet chiral symmetry. I\nintroduce a non-singlet mass term for Karsten-Wilczek fermions and identify the\nappropriate representation of the SU(2) flavor group at finite lattice spacing.\nI present an algebraic proof that the symmetry of the quark determinant under\ncharge conjugation and reflections of the Euclidean axes is preserved for\nKarsten-Wilczek fermions as sea quarks. Finally, I discuss how the flavor\ncomponents in meson correlation functions with Karsten-Wilczek fermions emerge\nnaturally and I show how taste-breaking can be avoided without fine tuning.\n", "  (Bi1-xSbx)2Se3 thin films have been prepared using molecular beam epitaxy\n(MBE). We demonstrate the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and\ntransport evidence for the existence of strong and robust topological surface\nstates in this ternary system. Large tunability in transport properties by\nvarying the Sb doping level has also been observed, where insulating phase\ncould be achieved at x=0.5. Our results reveal the potential of this system for\nthe study of tunable topological insulator and metal-insulator transition based\ndevice physics.\n", "  A search for the production of a single top quark in association with a Higgs\nboson is performed using the decay $\\text{H} \\to \\text{b} \\bar{\\text{b}}$. The\nrate of this Higgs production mode is particularly sensitive to the relative\nsign of the Higgs boson couplings to fermions and bosons. The 2015 pp\ncollisions data at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV are analyzed. This poster\nfocuses on the discrimination between signal and background events. Upper\nlimits, determined in the two-dimensional plane spanned by the coupling\nmodifiers of the Higgs boson to top quarks and to vector bosons, are presented.\n", "  We used the 50 cm Binocular Network (50BiN) telescope at Delingha Station\n(Qinghai Province) of Purple Mountain Observatory (Chinese Academy of Sciences)\nto obtain simultaneous $V$- and $R$-band observations of the old open cluster\nNGC 188. Our aim was a search for populations of variable stars. We derived\nlight-curve solutions for six W Ursae Majoris (W UMa) eclipsing-binary systems\nand estimated their orbital parameters. The resulting distance to the W UMas is\nindependent of the physical characteristics of the host cluster. We next\ndetermined the current best period--luminosity relations for contact binaries\n(CBs; scatter $\\sigma < 0.10$ mag). We conclude that CBs can be used as\ndistance tracers with better than 5\\% uncertainty. We apply our new relations\nto the 102 CBs in the Large Magellanic Cloud, which yields a distance modulus\nof $(m-M_V)_0=18.41\\pm0.20$ mag.\n", "  Using a Lagrangian framework, we discuss different conceptualizations of the\nblockscale dispersion tensor. We distinguish effective and ensemble blockscale\ndispersion, which measure the impact of subscale velocity fluctuations on\nsolute dispersion. Ensemble dispersion quantifies subscale velocity\nfluctuations between realizations, which overestimates the actual velocity\nvariability. Effective dispersion on the other hand quantifies the actual\nblockscale velocity variability and thus reflects the impact of subscale\nvelocity fluctuations on mixing and spreading. Based on these concepts, we\nquantify the impact of subscale velocity fluctuations on solute particle\nspreading and determine the governing equations for the coarse-grained\nconcentration distributions. We develop analytical and semi-analytical\nexpressions for the average and variance of the blockscale dispersion tensor in\n3D flow fields as a function of the structural parameters characterizing the\nsubsurface. Our results illustrate the relevance of the blockscale, the initial\nscale of the solute body and local-scale dispersion in controlling the\nuncertainty of the plume's dispersive behavior. The analysis performed in this\nwork has implications in numerical modeling (i.e. grid design) and allows to\nquantify the uncertainty of the blockscale dispersion tensor.\n", "  We report the detection of thermal continuum radio emission from the K0 III\ncoronal giant Pollux ($\\beta$ Gem) with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array\n(VLA). The star was detected at 21 and 9 GHz with flux density values of\n$150\\pm21$ and $43\\pm8\\,\\mu$Jy, respectively. We also place a\n$3\\sigma_{\\mathrm{rms}}$ upper limit of $23\\,\\mu$Jy for the flux density at 3\nGHz. We find the stellar disk-averaged brightness temperatures to be\napproximately 9500, 15000, and $<71000\\,$K, at 21, 9, and 3 GHz, respectively,\nwhich are consistent with the values of the quiet Sun. The emission is most\nlikely dominated by optically thick thermal emission from an upper chromosphere\nat 21 and 9 GHz. We discuss other possible additional sources of emission at\nall frequencies and show that there may also be a small contribution from\ngyroresonance emission above active regions, coronal free-free emission and\nfree-free emission from an optically thin stellar wind, particularly at the\nlower frequencies. We constrain the maximum mass-loss rate from Pollux to be\nless than $3.7\\times 10^{-11}\\,M_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ (assuming a wind terminal\nvelocity of 215 km s$^{-1}$), which is about an order of magnitude smaller than\nprevious constraints for coronal giants and is in agreement with existing\npredictions for the mass-loss rate of Pollux. These are the first detections of\nthermal radio emission from a single (i.e., non-binary) coronal giant and\ndemonstrate that low activity coronal giants like Pollux have atmospheres at\nradio frequencies akin to the quiet Sun.\n", "  Design and cryptanalysis of chaotic encryption schemes are major concerns to\nprovide secured information systems. Pursuing our previous research works, some\nwell-defined discrete chaotic iterations that satisfy the reputed Devaney's\ndefinition of chaos have been proposed. In this article, we summarize these\ncontributions and propose applications in the fields of pseudorandom number\ngeneration, hash functions, and symmetric cryptography. For all these\napplications, the proofs of chaotic properties are outlined.\n", "  For a homogeneous Riemannian space (G/H,g), where G is a reductive Lie group\nand g any deformation of the normal metric along the fibers of a homogeneous\nfibration K/H->G/H->G/K, we obtain the equation of motion of a charged particle\nunder a certain electromagnetic field.\n", "  We present preliminary measurements of the cross sections for e+e- --> KS KL\npi0 and KS KL pi0 pi0 obtained using the technique of Initial State Radiation\nwith 469 fb^-1 of e+e- collision data collected with the BABAR detector at or\nnear the Upsilon(4S) resonance. The resonant substructure of KS KL pi0 is\ninvestigated, and branching fractions for the decays of the charmonium\nresonances J/psi and psi(2S) into these final states are measured.\n", "  The electroweak production of single-top quarks in the $t$ channel can be\nchanged by any deviation from the standard model, it is therefore an excellent\nopportunity to search for new physics. In this poster the recent cross-section\nmeasurement performed by the CMS collaboration is presented with the full 2015\ndataset of the LHC Run II at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The cross\nsection and the top/antitop ratio is extracted using a binned maximum\nlikelihood fit to the distribution of a multivariate classifier in events\ncontaining one isolated muon in the final state.\n", "  We study the Restricted Solid on Solid model for surface growth in spatial\ndimension $d=2$ by means of a multi-surface coding technique that allows to\nproduce a large number of samples of samples in the stationary regime in a\nreasonable computational time. Thanks to: (i) a careful finite-size scaling\nanalysis of the critical exponents, (ii) the accurate estimate of the first\nthree moments of the height fluctuations, we can quantify the wandering\nexponent with unprecedented precision: $\\chi_{d=2} = 0.3869(4)$. This figure is\nincompatible with the long-standing conjecture due to Kim and Koesterlitz that\nhypothesized $\\chi_{d=2}=2/5$.\n", "  We report a pressure study on electron doped SrFe$_{2-x}$Co$_x$As$_2$ by\nelectrical-resistivity ($\\rho$) and magnetic-susceptibility ($\\chi$)\nexperiments. Application of either external pressure or Co substitution rapidly\nsuppresses the spin-density wave ordering of the Fe moments and induces\nsuperconductivity in SrFe$_2$As$_2$. At $x=0.2$ the broad superconducting (SC)\ndome in the $T-p$ phase diagram exhibits its maximum $T_{c,{\\rm max}}=20$ K at\na pressure of only $p_{\\rm max}\\approx 0.75$ GPa. In\nSrFe$_{1.5}$Co$_{0.5}$As$_2$ no superconductivity is observed anymore up to 2.8\nGPa. Upon increasing the Co concentration the maximum of the SC dome shifts\ntoward lower pressure accompanied by a decrease in the value of $T_{c,{\\rm\nmax}}$. Even though, superconductivity is induced by both tuning methods, Co\nsubstitution leads to a much more robust SC state. Our study evidences that in\nSrFe$_{2-x}$Co$_x$As$_2$ both, the effect of pressure and Co-substitution, have\nto be considered in order to understand the SC phase-diagram and further\nattests the close relationship of SrFe$_2$As$_2$ and its sister compound\nBaFe$_2$As$_2$.\n", "  This paper derives and analyzes continuous time random walk (CTRW) models in\nradial flow geometries for the quantification of non-local solute transport\ninduced by heterogeneous flow distributions and by mobile-immobile mass\ntransfer processes. To this end we derive a general CTRW framework in radial\ncoordinates starting from the random walk equations for radial particle\npositions and times. The particle density, or solute concentration is governed\nby a non-local radial advection-dispersion equation (ADE). Unlike in CTRWs for\nuniform flow scenarios, particle transition times here depend on the radial\nparticle position, which renders the CTRW non-stationary. As a consequence, the\nmemory kernel characterizing the non-local ADE, is radially dependent. Based on\nthis general formulation, we derive radial CTRW implementations that (i)\nemulate non-local radial transport due to heterogeneous advection, (ii) model\nmultirate mass transfer (MRMT) between mobile and immobile continua, and (iii)\nquantify both heterogeneous advection in a mobile region and mass transfer\nbetween mobile and immobile regions. The expected solute breakthrough behavior\nis studied using numerical random walk particle tracking simulations. This\nbehavior is analyzed by explicit analytical expressions for the asymptotic\nsolute breakthrough curves. We observe clear power-law tails of the solute\nbreakthrough for broad (power-law) distributions of particle transit times\n(heterogeneous advection) and particle trapping times (MRMT model). The\ncombined model displays two distinct time regimes. An intermediate regime, in\nwhich the solute breakthrough is dominated by the particle transit times in the\nmobile zones, and a late time regime that is governed by the distribution of\nparticle trapping times in immobile zones.\n", "  The issue concerning the nature and the role of microstructural\ninhomogeneities in iron chalcogenide superconducting crystals of FeTe0.65Se0.35\nand their correlation with transport properties of this system was addressed.\nPresented data demonstrate that chemical disorder originating from the kinetics\nof the crystal growth process significantly influences the superconducting\nproperties of an Fe-Te-Se system. Transport measurements of the transition\ntemperature and critical current density performed for microscopic bridges\nallow us to deduce the local properties of a superconductor with\nmicrostructural inhomogeneities, and significant differences were noted. The\nvariances observed in the local properties were explained as a consequence of\nweak superconducting links existing in the studied crystals. The results\nconfirm that inhomogeneous spatial distribution of ions and small hexagonal\nsymmetry nanoscale regions with nanoscale phase separation also seem to enhance\nthe superconductivity in this system with respect to the values of the critical\ncurrent density. Magnetic measurements confirm the conclusions drawn from the\ntransport measurements.\n", "  The Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) imprinted a characteristic correlation\nlength in the large-scale structure of the universe that can be used as a\nstandard ruler for mapping out the cosmic expansion history. Here, we discuss\nthe application of the angular two-point correlation function, $w(\\theta)$, to\na sample of luminous red galaxies of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and\nderive two new measurements of the BAO angular scale at $z = 0.235$ and $z =\n0.365$. Since noise and systematics may hinder the identification of the BAO\nsignature in the $w - \\theta$ plane, we also introduce a potential new method\nto localize the acoustic bump in a model-independent way. We use these new\nmeasurements along with previous data to constrain cosmological parameters of\ndark energy models and to derive a new estimate of the acoustic scale $r_s$.\n", "  We study modeling of two-phase flow in highly heterogeneous fractured and\nporous media. The flow behaviour is strongly influenced by mass transfer\nbetween a highly permeable (mobile) fracture domain and less permeable\n(immobile) matrix blocks. We quantify the effective two-phase flow behaviour\nusing a multirate rate mass transfer (MRMT) approach. We discuss the range of\napplicability of the MRMT approach in terms of the pertinent viscous and\ncapillary diffusion time scales. We scrutinize the linearization of capillary\ndiffusion in the immobile regions, which allows for the formulation of MRMT in\nthe form of a non-local single equation model. The global memory function,\nwhich encodes mass transfer between the mobile and the immobile regions, is at\nthe center of this method. We propose two methods to estimate the global memory\nfunction for a fracture network with given fracture and matrix geometry. Both\nemploy a scaling approach based on the known local memory function for a given\nimmobile region. With the first method, the local memory function is calculated\nnumerically, while the second one employs a parametric memory function in form\nof truncated power-law. The developed concepts are applied and tested for\nfracture networks of different complexity. We find that both physically based\nparameter estimation methods for the global memory function provide predictive\nMRMT approaches for the description of multiphase flow in highly heterogeneous\nporous media.\n", "  The most valuable asset of a space mission like Euclid are the data. Due to\ntheir huge volume, the automatic quality control becomes a crucial aspect over\nthe entire lifetime of the experiment. Here we focus on the design strategy for\nthe Science Ground Segment (SGS) Data Quality Common Tools (DQCT), which has\nthe main role to provide software solutions to gather, evaluate, and record\nquality information about the raw and derived data products from a primarily\nscientific perspective. The SGS DQCT will provide a quantitative basis for\nevaluating the application of reduction and calibration reference data, as well\nas diagnostic tools for quality parameters, flags, trend analysis diagrams and\nany other metadata parameter produced by the pipeline. In a large programme\nlike Euclid, it is prohibitively expensive to process large amount of data at\nthe pixel level just for the purpose of quality evaluation. Thus, all measures\nof quality at the pixel level are implemented in the individual pipeline\nstages, and passed along as metadata in the production. In this sense most of\nthe tasks related to science data quality are delegated to the pipeline stages,\neven though the responsibility for science data quality is managed at a higher\nlevel. The DQCT subsystem of the SGS is currently under development, but its\npath to full realization will likely be different than that of other\nsubsystems. Primarily because, due to a high level of parallelism and to the\nwide pipeline processing redundancy, for instance the mechanism of double\nScience Data Center for each processing function, the data quality tools have\nnot only to be widely spread over all pipeline segments and data levels, but\nalso to minimize the occurrences of potential diversity of solutions\nimplemented for similar functions, ensuring the maximum of coherency and\nstandardization for quality evaluation and reporting in the SGS.\n", "  Finding communities in evolving networks is a difficult task and raises\nissues different from the classic static detection case. We introduce an\napproach based on the recent vertex-centred paradigm. The proposed algorithm,\nnamed DynLOCNeSs, detects communities by scanning and evaluating each vertex\nneighbourhood, which can be done independently in a parallel way. It is done by\nmeans of a preference measure, using these preferences to handle community\nchanges. We also introduce a new vertex neighbourhood preference measure, CWCN,\nmore efficient than current existing ones in the considered context.\nExperimental results show the relevance of this measure and the ability of the\nproposed approach to detect classical community evolution patterns such as\ngrow-shrink and merge-split.\n", "  The paper presents new results of the ongoing study of the unusual\nLynx-Cancer void galaxy DDO 68 with record-low-metallicity regions (12+log(O/H)\n~7.14) of the current star formation (SF). They include: a) a new spectrum and\nphotometry with the 6-m SAO RAS telescope (BTA) for the Luminous Blue Variable\n(LBV = DDO68-V1). Photometric data sets are complemented with those based on\nthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST)\narchive images; b) the analysis of the DDO~68 supergiant shell (SGS) and the\nprominent smaller H-alpha arcs/shells visible at the HST image coupled with\nkinematics maps in H-alpha obtained with the Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI)\nat the BTA; c) the list of identified at the HST images of about 50 most\nluminous stars (-9.1 < M_V < -6.0 mag) related to star-forming regions with the\nknown extremely low O/H. This is intended to pave the path for the actual\nscience with the next generation of giant telescopes. We confirm the earlier\nhints on significant variations of the LBV optical light deriving its amplitude\nof dV > 3.7~mag for the first time. New data suggest that in 2008--2010 the LBV\nreached M_V = --10.5 and probably underwent a giant eruption. We argue that the\nstructure of star-forming complexes along the SGS (`Northern Ring') perimeter\nprovides evidence for the sequential induced SF episodes caused by the shell\ngas instabilities and gravitational collapse. The variability of some DDO~68\nluminous extremely metal-poor stars can be monitored with medium-size\ntelescopes at sites with superb seeing.\n", "  The emerging need for efficient, reliable and scalable astronomical catalog\ncross-matching is becoming more pressing in the current data-driven science\nera, where the size of data has rapidly increased up to the Petabyte scale. C3\n(Command-line Catalogue Cross-matching) is a multi-platform tool designed to\nefficiently cross-match massive catalogues from modern astronomical surveys,\nensuring high-performance capabilities through the use of a multi-core parallel\nprocessing paradigm. The tool has been conceived to be executed as a\nstand-alone command-line process or integrated within any generic data\nreduction/analysis pipeline, providing the maximum flexibility to the end user,\nin terms of parameter configuration, coordinates and cross-matching types. In\nthis work we present the architecture and the features of the tool. Moreover,\nsince the modular design of the tool enables an easy customization to specific\nuse cases and requirements, we present also an example of a customized C3\nversion designed and used in the FP7 project ViaLactea, dedicated to\ncross-correlate Hi-GAL clumps with multi-band compact sources.\n", "  In modern physics courses the idea of photon has been teaching through from\nthe einsteinian formulation based on the photoelectric effect. Einstein's\nphoton concept allow the quantization of the electromagnetic field, but does\nnot dwell on the idea of photon as particle. The objective of this paper was to\ndemonstrate that the photon has its origin essentially in the special\nrelativity, the electromagnetic theory and in the symmetry between the\nLorentz's transformations associated flat monochromatic electromagnetic waves\nand particles with zero rest mass. This approach allows to understand the\nwave-particle duality of photon and allows to propose an alternative teaching\nfocused on this duality to develop the course of modern physics.\n", "  In this work, we perform the Lie symmetry analysis on the Einstein-Maxwell\nfield equations in plane symmetric spacetime. Here Lie point symmetries and\noptimal system of one dimensional subalgebras are determined. The similarity\nreductions and exact solutions are obtained in connection to the evolution of\nuniverse. The present study deals with the electromagnetic energy of\ninhomogeneous universe where $F_{12}$ is the non-vanishing component of\nelectromagnetic field tensor. To get a deterministic solution, it is assumed\nthat the free gravitational field is Petrov type-II non-degenerate. The\nelectromagnetic field tensor $F_{12}$ is found to be positive and increasing\nfunction of time. As a special case, to validate the solution set, we discuss\nsome physical and geometric properties of a specific sub-model.\n", "  Heavy right handed neutrinos could not only explain the observed neutrino\nmasses via the seesaw mechanism, but also generate the baryon asymmetry of the\nuniverse via leptogenesis due to their CP-violating interactions in the early\nuniverse. We review recent progress in the theoretical description of this\nnonequilibrium process. Improved calculations are particularly important for a\ncomparison with experimental data in testable scenarios with Majorana masses\nbelow the TeV scale, in which the heavy neutrinos can be found at the LHC, in\nthe NA62 experiment, at T2K or in future experiments, including SHiP, DUNE and\nexperiments at the FCC, ILC or CEPC. In addition, the relevant source of\nCP-violation may be experimentally accessible, and the heavy neutrinos can give\na sizable contribution to neutrinoless double $\\beta$ decay. In these low scale\nleptogenesis scenarios, the matter-antimatter asymmetry is generated at\ntemperatures when the heavy neutrinos are relativistic, and thermal corrections\nto the transport equations in the early universe are large.\n", "  We demonstrate a method which can directly evaluate the radio frequency\ntransfer quality via fiber links at the remote site. Coherent signals are first\ntransferred to the same remote site via two stabilized fiber links. The two\nsignals at the remote site are compared with each other. The relative phase\ndifference can represent transfer stability loss. This evaluation method at the\nremote site has been compared with the traditional one with which the signal is\nevaluated at the local site. The two results match perfectly. It indicates that\nthe method is available to evaluate the transfer performance of radio frequency\n(RF) dissemination in such applications as antenna array systems.\n", "  The open cluster Berkeley 90 is the home to one of the most massive binary\nsystems in the Galaxy, LS III +46$^{\\circ}$11, formed by two identical, very\nmassive stars (O3.5 If* + O3.5 If*), and a second early-O system (LS III\n+46$^{\\circ}$12 with an O4.5 IV((f)) component at least). Stars with spectral\ntypes earlier than O4 are very scarce in the Milky Way, with no more than 20\nexamples. The formation of such massive stars is still an open question today,\nand thus the study of the environments where the most massive stars are found\ncan shed some light on this topic. To this aim, we determine the properties and\ncharacterize the population of Berkeley 90 using optical, near-infrared and\nWISE photometry and optical spectroscopy. This is the first determination of\nthese parameters with accuracy. We find a distance of $3.5^{+0.5}_{-0.5}$ kpc\nand a maximum age of 3 Ma. The cluster mass is around $1000$ $M_{\\odot}$\n(perhaps reaching $1500$ $M_{\\odot}$ if the surrounding population is added),\nand we do not detect candidate runaway stars in the area. There is a second\npopulation of young stars to the Southeast of the cluster that may have formed\nat the same time or slightly later, with some evidence for low-activity ongoing\nstar formation.\n", "  Galaxy cluster merger shocks are the main agent for the thermalization of the\nintracluster medium and the energization of cosmic ray particles in it. Shock\npropagation changes the state of the tenuous intracluster plasma, and the\ncorresponding signal variations are measurable with the current generation of\nX-ray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect instruments. Additionally, non-thermal\nelectrons (re-)energized by the shocks sometimes give rise to extended and\nluminous synchrotron sources known as radio relics, which are prominent\nindicators of shocks propagating roughly in the plane of the sky. In this short\nreview, we discuss how the joint modeling of the non-thermal and thermal signal\nvariations across radio relic shock fronts is helping to advance our knowledge\nof the gas thermodynamical properties and magnetic field strengths in the\ncluster outskirts. We describe the first use of the SZ effect to measure the\nMach numbers of relic shocks, for both the nearest (Coma) and the farthest (El\nGordo) clusters with known radio relics.\n", "  By using first-principles calculations, we investigated the monolayer $ReS_2$\nwith vacancies under strain engineering, specifically focusing on its energy of\nformation, band gap, electron density of states, effective mass and optical\nproperties. The calculated results disclose that S4 defect is more likely to\nform than other kinds of vacancies. Asymmetric deformation induced by strain\nmakes its band structure transformation from direct band gap to indirect band\ngap. The analysis of the partial density of states indicates that the Re-d,\nRe-p and S-d orbitals are the major components of the defect states, being\ndifferent from $MoS_2$, the defect states locate both above and below the Fermi\nlevel. Moreover, the effective mass was sensitive and anisotropic under the\nexternal strain. The reflection spectrum can be greatly tuned by the external\nstrains, which indicates that the ReS2 monolayer has promising applications in\nnanoscale strain sensor and conductance-switch FETs.\n", "  In this paper, the latest results of searches for the standard model Higgs\nboson produced in association with a top quark-antiquark pair\n($\\mathrm{t\\bar{t}H}$), where Higgs decays into photons, bottom quark-antiquark\npair or leptons via $\\mathrm{WW^*}$, $\\mathrm{ZZ^*}$ and $\\mathrm{\\tau\\tau}$\nwill be presented. The analyses have been performed using the\n$\\mathrm{13\\,TeV}$ pp collisions data recorded by the CMS experiment in 2015\nand part of 2016. The results are presented in the form of the best fit to the\nsignal strength ($\\mathrm{\\mu=\\sigma/\\sigma_{SM}}$) measured with respect to\nthe Standard Model prediction and its expected and observed $\\mathrm{95\\%}$\nC.L. upper limits.\n", "  The original charmonium two-body problem, like the $c\\bar c$ structure of the\n$J/\\psi$ meson, has become more involved in the last few years with the\ndiscovery of new resonances such as the tentative molecular state $X(3872)$ or\nthe possible pentaquark one $P_{c}(4380)^{+}$. We discuss herein how these\nexotic states (and others) can be described in a unified way adding higher Fock\nstate components to the naive quark model picture. In particular, we present\nour theoretical results on the pentaquark states $P_{c}(4380)^{+}$ and\n$P_{c}(4450)^{+}$, and on the new charmonium-like resonances $X(4140)$,\n$X(4274)$, $X(4500)$ and $X(4700)$ that have been reported in $2016$ by the\nLHCb Collaboration.\n", "  The two exotic $P_c^+(4380)$ and $P_c^+(4450)$ discovered in $2015$ by the\nLHCb Collaboration, together with the four resonances $X(4140)$, $X(4274)$,\n$X(4500)$ and $X(4700)$, reported in $2016$ by the same collaboration, are\ndescribed in a constituent quark model which has been able to explain the\nproperties of charmonium states from the $J/\\psi$ to the $X(3872)$. Using this\nmodel we found a $\\bar D\\Sigma_c^*$ bound state with $J^P=\\frac{3}{2}^-$ that\nmay be identified with the $P_c^+(4380)$. In the $\\bar D^*\\Sigma_c$ channel we\nfound three possible candidates for the $P_c^+(4450)$ with $J^P=\\frac{1}{2}^-$,\n$\\frac{3}{2}^-$ and $\\frac{3}{2}^+$ with almost degenerated energies. The\n$X(4140)$ resonance appears as a cusp in the $J/\\psi\\phi$ channel due to the\nnear coincidence of the $D_{s}^{\\pm}D_{s}^{\\ast\\pm}$ and $J/\\psi\\phi$ mass\nthresholds. The remaining three $X(4274)$, $X(4500)$ and $X(4700)$ resonances\nappear as conventional charmonium states with quantum numbers $3^{3}P_{1}$,\n$4^{3}P_{0}$ and $5^{3}P_{0}$, respectively; and whose masses and widths are\nslightly modified due to their coupling with the corresponding closest\nmeson-meson thresholds.\n", "  In this paper different types of ECG automatic delineation approaches were\noverviewed. A combination of these approaches was used to create sampling rate\nindependent filtration algorithm for automatic ECG delineation that is capable\nof distinguishing different morphologies of T and P waves and QRS complexes.\nCreated filtration algorithm was compared with algorithme \\`a trous. It was\ninvestigated that continuous wavelets transform with proposed automatic\nadaptation for different sampling rates procedure can be used for delineation\nproblem.\n", "  The local structure and chemical bonding in two-phase amorphous\nCr$_{1-x}$C$_{x}$ nanocomposite thin films are investigated by Cr $K$-edge\n($1s$) X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray\nabsorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopies in comparison to theory. By\nutilizing the computationally efficient \\textit{stochastic quenching} (SQ)\ntechnique, we reveal the complexity of different Cr-sites in the transition\nmetal carbides, highlighting the need for large scale averaging to obtain\ntheoretical XANES and EXAFS spectra for comparison with measurements. As shown\nin this work, it is advantageous to use \\textit{ab initio} theory as an\nassessment to correctly model and fit experimental spectra and investigate the\ntrends of bond lengths and coordination numbers in complex amorphous materials.\nWith sufficient total carbon content ($\\geq$ 30 at\\%), we find that the\nshort-range coordination in the amorphous carbide phase exhibit similarities to\nthat of a Cr$_{7}$C$_{3\\pm{}y}$ structure, while excessive carbons assemble in\nthe amorphous carbon phase.\n", "  We report the magnetic properties of compounds in the KBaRE(BO3)2 family (RE=\nSm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb), materials with a planar triangular lattice\ncomposed of rare earth ions. The samples were analyzed by x-ray diffraction and\ncrystallize in the space group R-3m. Physical property measurements indicate\nthe compounds display predominantly antiferromagnetic interactions between\nspins without any signs of magnetic ordering above 1.8 K. The ideal 2D rare\nearth triangular layers in this structure type make it a potential model system\nfor investigating magnetic frustration in rare-earth-based materials.\n", "  In this paper a novel numerical scheme for finding the sparse self-localized\nstates of a nonlinear system of equations with missing spectral data is\nintroduced. As in the Petviashivili's and the spectral renormalization method,\nthe governing equation is transformed into Fourier domain, but the iterations\nare performed for far fewer number of spectral components (M) than classical\nversions of the these methods with higher number of spectral components (N).\nAfter the converge criteria is achieved for M components, N component signal is\nreconstructed from M components by using the l1 minimization technique of the\ncompressive sampling. This method can be named as compressive spectral\nrenormalization (CSRM) method. The main advantage of the CSRM is that, it is\ncapable of finding the sparse self-localized states of the evolution\nequation(s) with many spectral data missing.\n", "  The effect of finger spreading on hydrodynamic drag in swimming is studied\nboth with a numerical simulation and with laboratory experiments. Both\napproaches are based on the exact same 3D model of the hand with attached\nforearm. The virtual version of the hand with forearm was implemented in a\nnumerical code by means of an immersed boundary method and the physical version\nwas studied in a wind tunnel experiment. An enhancement of the drag coefficient\nof 2 and 5% compared to the case with closed fingers was found for the\nnumerical simulation and experiment, respectively. A 5 and 8% favourable effect\non the (dimensionless) force moment at an optimal finger spreading of 10\ndegrees was found, which indicates that the difference is more outspoken in the\nforce moment. Also an analytical model is proposed, using scaling arguments\nsimilar to the Betz actuator disk model, to explain the drag coefficient as a\nfunction of finger spacing.\n", "  The energy extraction from a Einstein-Born-Infeld (EBI) black hole is\naddressed determining the extension of the ergosphere as well as the\nextractable energy using the irreducible mass concept. These results are\ncompared with the Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) ones; RN is the linear\nelectromagnetic counterpart of the BI black hole. It turns out that for a fixed\ncharge Q, more energy can be extracted from the RN black hole than from the EBI\none. The extreme case is investigated as well, presenting remarkable features,\nfor instance that more energy can be extracted from extreme EBI black holes\nthan from extreme RN, however, extreme EBI black holes lack of a linear\nelectromagnetic black hole limit.\n", "  Geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) are a well-known terrestrial space\nweather hazard. They occur in power transmission networks and are known to have\nadverse effects in both high and mid-latitude countries. Here, we study GICs in\nthe Irish power transmission network (geomagnetic latitude 54.7--58.5$^{\\circ}$\nN) during five geomagnetic storms (06-07 March 2016, 20-21 December 2015, 17-18\nMarch 2015, 29-31 October 2003 and 13-14 March 1989). We simulate electric\nfields using a plane wave method together with two ground resistivity models,\none of which is derived from magnetotelluric measurements (MT model). We then\ncalculate GICs in the 220, 275 and 400~kV transmission network. During the\nlargest of the storm periods studied, the peak electric field was calculated to\nbe as large as 3.8~V~km\\textsuperscript{-1}, with associated GICs of up to 23~A\nusing our MT model. Using our homogenous resistivity model, those peak values\nwere 1.46~V~km\\textsuperscript{-1} and 25.8~A. We find that three 400 and\n275~kV substations are the most likely locations for the Irish transformers to\nexperience large GICs.\n", "  This is a review of ground-state features of the s=1/2 Heisenberg\nantiferromagnet on two-dimensional lattices. A central issue is the interplay\nof lattice topology (e.g. coordination number, non-equivalent nearest-neighbor\nbonds, geometric frustration) and quantum fluctuations and their impact on\npossible long-range order. This article presents a unified summary of all 11\ntwo-dimensional uniform Archimedean lattices which include e.g. the square,\ntriangular and kagome lattice. We find that the ground state of the spin-1/2\nHeisenberg antiferromagnet is likely to be semi-classically ordered in most\ncases. However, the interplay of geometric frustration and quantum fluctuations\ngives rise to a quantum paramagnetic ground state without semi-classical\nlong-range order on two lattices which are precisely those among the 11 uniform\nArchimedean lattices with a highly degenerate ground state in the classical\nlimit. The first one is the famous kagome lattice where many low-lying singlet\nexcitations are known to arise in the spin gap. The second lattice is called\nstar lattice and has a clear gap to all excitations.\n  Modification of certain bonds leads to quantum phase transitions which are\nalso discussed briefly. Furthermore, we discuss the magnetization process of\nthe Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the 11 Archimedean lattices, focusing on\nanomalies like plateaus and a magnetization jump just below the saturation\nfield. As an illustration we discuss the two-dimensional Shastry-Sutherland\nmodel which is used to describe SrCu2(BO3)2.\n", "  We consider a high-$Q$ Duffing oscillator in a weakly non-linear regime with\nthe driving frequency $\\sigma$ varying in time between $\\sigma_i$ and\n$\\sigma_f$ at a characteristic rate $r$. We found that the frequency sweep can\ncause controlled transitions between two stable states of the system. Moreover,\nthese transitions are accomplished via a transient that lingers for a long time\naround the third, unstable fixed point of saddle type. We propose a simple\nexplanation for this phenomenon and find the transient life-time to scale as\n$-(\\ln{|r-r_c|})/\\lambda_r$ where $r_c$ is the critical rate necessary to\ninduce a transition and $\\lambda_r$ is the repulsive eigenvalue of the saddle.\nExperimental implications are mentioned.\n", "  The design of time-independent local Hamiltonians that realise quantum\nalgorithms is derived from the study of perfect state transfer. The novel\nfeatures of this evolution are the perfect realisation of the computation, and\nthe ability to implement operations in parallel rather than sequentially. This\nis applied to a quantum circuit for concatenated error correcting codes, and\nthe properties of the eigenstates are compared to those of topological\nmemories. An erroneous implementation of the algorithm (one where a single\nerror could lead to a fault in the output) is found not to be topological,\nwhereas a true fault-tolerant algorithm possesses self-correcting properties,\nsuggesting the existence of a unifying structure for fault-tolerant memories.\n"]}
