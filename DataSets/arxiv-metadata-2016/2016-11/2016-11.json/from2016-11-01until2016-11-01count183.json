It is shown that this relationship is minimized for the\nstandard coherent states. We obtain the time evolution of the number coherent\nstates by supposing that the Hamiltonian is proportional to the third generator\n$K_0$ of the $su(1,1)$ Lie algebra. Analogous results for the $SU(2)$ Perelomov\nnumber coherent states are found. As examples, we compute the Perelomov\ncoherent states for the pseudoharmonic oscillator and the two-dimensional\nisotropic harmonic oscillator.\n", "  We demonstrate that ultracold polyatomic symmetric top molecules, such as\nmethyl fluoride, loaded into an optical lattice and subject to DC electric and\nmicrowave field dressing, can display topological order via a self-consistent\nanalog of a proximity effect in the internal state space of the molecule. The\nnon-trivial topology arises from pairwise transitions between internal states\ninduced by dipole-dipole interactions and made resonant by the field dressing.\nTopological order is explicitly demonstrated by matrix product state\nsimulations on 1D chains. Additionally, we show that in the limit of pinned\nmolecules our description maps onto a long-range and anisotropic XYZ spin\nmodel, where Majorana fermions are zero-energy edge excitations in the case of\nnearest-neighbor couplings.\n", "  Two methods of constructing 2D Toda $\\tau$-functions that are generating\nfunctions for certain geometrical invariants of a combinatorial nature are\nrelated. The first involves generation of paths in the Cayley graph of the\nsymmetric group $S_n$ by multiplication of the conjugacy class sums $C_\\lambda\n\\in C[S_n]$ in the group algebra by elements of an abelian group of central\nelements. Extending the characteristic map to the tensor product $C[S_n]\\otimes\nC[S_n]$ leads to double expansions in terms of power sum symmetric functions,\nin which the coefficients count the number of such paths. Applying the same map\nto sums over the orthogonal idempotents leads to diagonal double Schur function\nexpansions that are identified as $\\tau$-functions of hypergeometric type. The\nsecond method is the standard construction of $\\tau$-functions as vacuum state\nmatrix elements of products of vertex operators in a fermionic Fock space with\nelements of the abelian group of convolution symmetries. A homomorphism between\nthese two group actions is derived and shown to be intertwined by the\ncharacteristic map composed with fermionization. Applications include\nOkounkov's generating function for double Hurwitz numbers, which count branched\ncoverings of the Riemann sphere with nonminimal branching at two points, and\nvarious analogous combinatorial counting functions.\n", "  A representation of current is presented which can account for ideal\nconduction and distinguish superconductors, superfluids, ideal, and non-ideal\nconductors. The idea of the scheme is that different current operators and\ntransport weights can be constructed based on the number of charge carriers in\nbasic units of conduction. Ideal conductors with basic units of $p$ charge\ncarriers exhibit a flux quantization rule of $\\Phi_B=nhc/(pe)$ (for example\n$p=2$ for BCS). Extension of the current operators to lattice systems is also\npresented. A full diagonalization calculation for an interacting model of\nspinless fermions of all the transport coefficients is carried out. It is shown\nthat in a number of strongly correlated models ideal conduction involving the\nsimultaneous motion of all charge carriers is possible.\n", "  With the couplings between the eight gluons constrained by the structure\nconstants of the su(3) algebra in QCD, one would expect that there should exist\na special basis (or set of bases) for the algebra wherein, unlike in a\nCartan-Weyl basis, {\\em all} gluons interact identically (cyclically) with each\nother, explicitly on an equal footing. We report here particular such bases,\nwhich we have found in a computer search, and we indicate associated $3 \\times\n3$ representations. We conjecture that essentially all cyclic bases for su(3)\nmay be obtained from these making appropriate circulant transformations,and\nthat cyclic bases may also exist for other su(n), n>3.\n", "  By studying the Fr\\\"olicher-Nijenhuis decomposition of cohomology operators\n(that is, derivations $D$ of the exterior algebra $\\Omega (M)$ with\n$\\mathbb{Z}-$degree $1$ and $D^2=0$), we describe new examples of Lie algebroid\nstructures on the tangent bundle $TM$ (and its complexification\n$T^{\\mathbb{C}}M$) constructed from pre-existing geometric ones such as\nfoliations, complex, product or tangent structures. We also describe a class of\nLie algebroids on tangent bundles associated to idempotent endomorphisms with\nnontrivial Nijenhuis torsion.\n", "  Many authors noted that the principle of relativity, together with space-time\nsymmetries, suffices to derive Lorentz-like coordinate transformations between\ninertial frames. These contain a free parameter, $k$, (equal to $c^{-2}$ in\nspecial relativity) which is usually claimed to be empirically determinable, so\nthat special relativity does not need the postulate of constancy of the speed\nof light. I analyze this claim and find that all methods destined to measure\n$k$ fail without further assumptions, similar to the second postulate.\nSpecifically, measuring $k$ requires a signal that travels identically in\nopposite directions (this is unrelated to the conventionality of\nsynchronization, as the one-postulate program implicitly selects the standard\nsynchronization convention). Positing such a property about light is logically\nweaker than Einstein's second postulate but suffices to recover special\nrelativity in full.\n", "  The construction of hypergeometric 2D Toda $\\tau$-functions as generating\nfunctions for quantum Hurwitz numbers is extended here to multispecies\nfamilies. Both the enumerative geometrical significance of these multispecies\nquantum Hurwitz numbers as weighted enumerations of branched coverings of the\nRiemann sphere and their combinatorial significance in terms of weighted paths\nin the Cayley graph of $S_n$ are derived.\n", "  We perform a stability analysis for a fluid-structure interaction problem in\nwhich a spherical elastic shell or membrane is immersed in a 3D viscous,\nincompressible fluid. The shell is an idealised structure having zero\nthickness, and has the same fluid lying both inside and outside. The problem is\nformulated mathematically using the immersed boundary framework in which Dirac\ndelta functions are employed to capture the two-way interaction between fluid\nand immersed structure. The elastic structure is driven parametrically via a\ntime-periodic modulation of the elastic membrane stiffness. We perform a\nFloquet stability analysis, considering the case of both a viscous and inviscid\nfluid, and demonstrate that the forced fluid-membrane system gives rise to\nparametric resonances in which the solution becomes unbounded even in the\npresence of viscosity. The analytical results are validated using numerical\nsimulations with a 3D immersed boundary code for a range of wavenumbers and\nphysical parameter values. Finally, potential applications to biological\nsystems are discussed, with a particular focus on the human heart and\ninvestigating whether or not fluid-structure interaction-mediated instabilities\ncould play a role in cardiac fluid dynamics.\n", "  We study planar random holonomy fields which are processes indexed by paths\non the plane which behave well under the concatenation and\norientation-reversing operations on paths. We define the Planar Markovian\nHolonomy Fields as planar random holonomy fields which satisfy some\nindependence and invariance by area-preserving homeomorphisms properties. We\nuse the theory of braids in the framework of classical probabilities: for\nfinite and infinite random sequences the notion of invariance by braids is\ndefined and we prove a new version of the de-Finetti's Theorem. This allows us\nto construct a family of Planar Markovian Holonomy Fields, the Yang-Mills\nfields, and we prove that any regular Planar Markovian Holonomy Field is a\nplanar Yang-Mills field. This family of planar Yang-Mills fields can be\npartitioned into three categories according to the degree of symmetry: we study\nsome equivalent conditions in order to classify them. Finally, we recall the\nnotion of Markovian Holonomy Fields and construct a bridge between the planar\nand non-planar theories. Using the results previously proved in the article, we\ncompute, for any Markovian Holonomy Field, the \"law\" of any family of\ncontractible loops drawn on a surface.\n", "  We apply the immersed boundary (or IB) method to simulate deformation and\ndetachment of a periodic array of wall-bounded biofilm colonies in response to\na linear shear flow. The biofilm material is represented as a network of\nHookean springs that are placed along the edges of a triangulation of the\nbiofilm region. The interfacial shear stress, lift and drag forces acting on\nthe biofilm colony are computed by using fluid stress jump method developed by\nWilliams, Fauci and Gaver [Disc. Contin. Dyn. Sys. B 11(2):519-540, 2009], with\na modified version of their exclusion filter. Our detachment criterion is based\non the novel concept of an averaged equivalent continuum stress tensor defined\nat each IB point in the biofilm which is then used to determine a corresponding\nvon Mises yield stress; wherever this yield stress exceeds a given critical\nthreshold the connections to that node are severed, thereby signalling the\nonset of a detachment event. In order to capture the deformation and detachment\nbehaviour of a biofilm colony at different stages of growth, we consider a\nfamily of four biofilm shapes with varying aspect ratio. Our numerical\nsimulations focus on the behaviour of weak biofilms (with relatively low yield\nstress threshold) and investigate features of the fluid-structure interaction\nsuch as locations of maximum shear and increased drag. The most important\nconclusion of this work is that the commonly employed detachment strategy in\nbiofilm models based only on interfacial shear stress can lead to incorrect or\ninaccurate results when applied to the study of shear induced detachment of\nweak biofilms. Our detachment strategy based on equivalent continuum stresses\nprovides a unified and consistent IB framework that handles both sloughing and\nerosion modes of biofilm detachment, and is consistent with strategies employed\nin many other continuum based biofilm models.\n", "  An explicit surjection from a set of (locally defined) unconstrained\nholomorphic functions on a certain submanifold of (Sp_1(C) \\times C^{4n}) onto\nthe set HK_{p,q} of local isometry classes of real analytic\npseudo-hyperk\\\"ahler metrics of signature (4p,4q) in dimension 4n is\nconstructed. The holomorphic functions, called prepotentials, are analogues of\nK\\\"ahler potentials for K\\\"ahler metrics and provide a complete\nparameterisation of HK_{p,q}. In particular, there exists a bijection between\nHK_{p,q} and the set of equivalence classes of prepotentials. This affords the\nexplicit construction of pseudo-hyperk\\\"ahler metrics from specified\nprepotentials. The construction generalises one due to Galperin, Ivanov,\nOgievetsky and Sokatchev. Their work is given a coordinate-free formulation and\ncomplete, self-contained proofs are provided. An appendix provides a vital tool\nfor this construction: a reformulation of real analytic G-structures in terms\nof holomorphic frame fields on complex manifolds.\n", "  In view of the current status of measured Higgs boson properties, we consider\na question whether only the Higgs self-interactions can deviate significantly\nfrom the Standard-Model (SM) predictions. This may be possible if the Higgs\neffective potential is irregular at the origin. As an example we investigate an\nextended Higgs sector with singlet scalar(s) and classical scale invariance. We\ndevelop a perturbative formulation necessary to analyze this model in detail.\nThe behavior of a phenomenologically valid potential in the perturbative regime\nis studied around the electroweak scale. We reproduce known results: The Higgs\nself-interactions are substantially stronger than the SM predictions, while the\nHiggs interactions with other SM particles are barely changed. We further\npredict that the interactions of singlet scalar(s), which is a few to several\ntimes heavier than the Higgs boson, tend to be fairly strong. If probed, these\nfeatures will provide vivid clues to the structure of the vacuum. We also\nexamine Veltman's condition for the Higgs boson mass.\n", "  The network of interpersonal connections is one of the possible heterogeneous\nfactors which affect the income distribution emerging from micro-to-macro\neconomic models. In this paper we equip our model discussed in [1,2] with a\nnetwork structure. The model is based on a system of $n$ differential equations\nof the kinetic discretized-Boltzmann kind. The network structure is\nincorporated in a probabilistic way, through the introduction of a link density\n$P(\\alpha)$ and of correlation coefficients $P(\\beta|\\alpha)$, which give the\nconditioned probability that an individual with $\\alpha$ links is connected to\none with $\\beta$ links. We study the properties of the equations and give\nanalytical results concerning the existence, normalization and positivity of\nthe solutions. For a fixed network with $P(\\alpha)=c/\\alpha^q$, we investigate\nnumerically the dependence of the detailed and marginal equilibrium\ndistributions on the initial conditions and on the exponent $q$. Our results\nare compatible with those obtained from the Bouchaud-Mezard model and from\nagent-based simulations, and provide additional information about the\ndependence of the individual income on the level of connectivity.\n", "  We study the asymptotic behaviour of sharp front solutions arising from the\nnonlinear diffusion equation \\theta_t = (D(\\theta)\\theta_x)_x, where the\ndiffusivity is an exponential function D({\\theta}) = D_o exp(\\beta\\theta). This\nproblem arises for example in the study of unsaturated flow in porous media\nwhere {\\theta} represents the liquid saturation. For physical parameters\ncorresponding to actual porous media, the diffusivity at the residual\nsaturation is D(0) = D_o << 1 so that the diffusion problem is nearly\ndegenerate. Such problems are characterised by wetting fronts that sharply\ndelineate regions of saturated and unsaturated flow, and that propagate with a\nwell-defined speed. Using matched asymptotic expansions in the limit of large\n{\\beta}, we derive an analytical description of the solution that is uniformly\nvalid throughout the wetting front. This is in contrast with most other related\nanalyses that instead truncate the solution at some specific wetting front\nlocation, which is then calculated as part of the solution, and beyond that\nlocation the solution is undefined. Our asymptotic analysis demonstrates that\nthe solution has a four-layer structure, and by matching through the adjacent\nlayers we obtain an estimate of the wetting front location in terms of the\nmaterial parameters describing the porous medium. Using numerical simulations\nof the original nonlinear diffusion equation, we demonstrate that the first few\nterms in our series solution provide approximations of physical quantities such\nas wetting front location and speed of propagation that are more accurate (over\na wide range of admissible {\\beta} values) than other asymptotic approximations\nreported in the literature.\n", "  Classical scale invariance is one of the possible solutions to explain the\norigin of the electroweak scale. The simplest extension is the classically\nscale-invariant standard model augmented by a multiplet of gauge singlet real\nscalar. In the previous study it was shown that the properties of the Higgs\npotential deviate substantially, which can be observed in the International\nLinear Collider. On the other hand, since the multiplet does not acquire vacuum\nexpectation value, the singlet components are stable and can be dark matter. In\nthis letter we study the detectability of the real singlet scalar bosons in the\nexperiment of the direct detection of dark matter. It is shown that a part of\nthis model has already been excluded and the rest of the parameter space is\nwithin the reach of the future experiment.\n", "  Empirical calibrations of the stellar age-rotation-activity relation (ARAR)\nrely on observations of the co-eval populations of stars in open clusters. We\nused the Chandra X-ray Observatory to study M37, a 500-Myr-old open cluster\nthat has been extensively surveyed for rotation periods ($P_{\\rm rot}$). M37\nwas observed almost continuously for five days, for a total of 440.5 ksec, to\nmeasure stellar X-ray luminosities ($L_{\\mathrm{X}}$), a proxy for coronal\nactivity, across a wide range of masses. The cluster's membership catalog was\nrevisited to calculate updated membership probabilities from photometric data\nand each star's distance to the cluster center. The result is a comprehensive\nsample of 1699 M37 members: 426 with $P_{\\rm rot}$, 278 with X-ray detections,\nand 76 with both. We calculate Rossby numbers, $R_o = P_{\\rm rot}/\\tau$, where\n$\\tau$ is the convective turnover time, and ratios of the X-ray-to-bolometric\nluminosity, $L_{\\rm X}/L_{\\rm bol}$, to minimize mass dependencies in our\ncharacterization of the rotation-coronal activity relation at 500 Myr. We find\nthat fast rotators, for which $R_o<0.09\\pm0.01$, show saturated levels of\nactivity, with log($L_{\\rm X}/L_{\\rm bol}$)$=-3.06\\pm0.04$. For\n$R_o\\geq0.09\\pm0.01$, activity is unsaturated and follows a power law of the\nform $R_o^\\beta$, where $\\beta$=$-2.03_{-0.14}^{+0.17}$. This is the largest\nsample available for analyzing the dependence of coronal emission on rotation\nfor a single-aged population, covering stellar masses in the range 0.4$-$1.3\n$M_{\\odot}$, $P_{\\rm rot}$ in the range 0.4$-$12.8 d, and $L_{\\rm X}$ in the\nrange 10$^{28.4-30.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Our results make M37 a new benchmark open\ncluster for calibrating the ARAR at ages of $\\approx$500 Myr.\n", "  Phenomenological AdS/QCD models, like hard wall and soft wall, provide\nhadronic mass spectra in reasonable consistency with experimental and (or)\nlattice results. These simple models are inspired in the AdS/CFT correspondence\nand assume that gauge/ gravity duality holds in a scenario where conformal\ninvariance is broken through the introduction of an energy scale.\n  Another important property of hadrons: the decay constant, can also be\nobtained from these models. However, a consistent formulation of an AdS/QCD\nmodel that reproduces the observed behavior of decay constants of vector meson\nexcited states is still lacking. In particular: for radially excited states of\nheavy vector mesons, the experimental data lead to decay constants that\ndecrease with the radial excitation level.\n  We show here that a modified framework of soft wall AdS/QCD involving an\nadditional dimensionfull parameter, associated with an ultraviolet energy\nscale, provides decay constants decreasing with radial excitation level. In\nthis version of the soft wall model the two point function of gauge theory\noperators is calculated at a finite position of the anti-de Sitter space radial\ncoordinate.\n", "  Unitary processes allow for the transfer of work to and from Hamiltonian\nsystems. However, to achieve nonzero power for the practical extraction of\nwork, these processes must be performed within a finite time, which inevitably\ninduces excitations in the system. We show that depending on the time scale of\nthe process and the physical realization of the external driving employed, the\nuse of counterdiabatic quantum driving to extract more work is not always\neffective. We also show that by virtue of the two-time energy measurement\ndefinition of quantum work, the cost of counterdiabatic driving can be\nsignificantly reduced by selecting a restricted form of the driving Hamiltonian\nthat depends on the outcome of the first energy measurement. Lastly, we\nintroduce a measure, the exigency, that quantifies the need for an external\ndriving to preserve quantum adiabaticity which does not require knowledge of\nthe explicit form of the counterdiabatic drivings, and can thus always be\ncomputed. We apply our analysis to systems ranging from a two-level\nLandau-Zener problem to many-body problems, namely, the quantum Ising and\nLipkin-Meshkov-Glick models.\n", "  Motivated by the nonlinear star formation efficiency found in recent\nnumerical simulations by a number of workers, we perform high-resolution\nadaptive mesh refinement simulations of star formation in self-gravitating\nturbulently driven gas. As we follow the collapse of this gas, we find that the\ncharacter of the flow changes at two radii, the disk radius $r_d$, and the\nradius $r_*$ where the enclosed gas mass exceeds the stellar mass. Accretion\nstarts at large scales and works inwards. In line with recent analytical work,\nwe find that the density evolves to a fixed attractor, $\\rho(r,t ) \\rightarrow\n\\rho(r)$, for $r_d<r<r_*$; mass flows through this structure onto a\nsporadically gravitationally unstable disk, and from thence onto the star. In\nthe bulk of the simulation box we find that the random motions $v_T \\sim r^p$\nwith $p \\sim 0.5$, in agreement with Larson's size-linewidth relation. In the\nvicinity of massive star forming regions we find $ p \\sim 0.2-0.3$, as seen in\nobservations. For $r<r_*$, $v_T$ increases inward, with $p=-1/2$. Finally, we\nfind that the total stellar mass $M_*(t)\\sim t^2$ in line with previous\nnumerical and analytic work that suggests a nonlinear rate of star formation.\n", "  The existence and properties of the sigma meson have been controversial for\nalmost six decades, despite playing a central role in the spontaneous chiral\nsymmetry of QCD or in the nucleon-nucleon attraction. This controversy has also\nbeen fed by the strong indications that it is not an ordinary quark-antiquark\nmeson. Here we review both the recent and old experimental data and the model\nindependent dispersive formalisms which have provided precise determinations of\nits mass and width, finally settling the controversy and leading to its new\nname: $f_0(500)$. We then provide a rather conservative average of the most\nrecent and advanced dispersive determinations of its pole position\n$\\sqrt{s_\\sigma}=449^{+22}_{-16}-i(275\\pm12)$.\n  In addition, after comprehensive introductions, we will review within the\nmodern perspective of effective theories and dispersion theory, its relation to\nchiral symmetry, unitarization techniques, its quark mass dependence, popular\nmodels, as well as the recent strong evidence, obtained from the QCD $1/N_c$\nexpansion or Regge theory, for its non ordinary nature in terms of quarks and\ngluons.\n", "  The present paper reports a study on the cosmological consequences arising\nfrom reconstructing $f(T)$ gravity through new holographic-polytropic dark\nenergy. We assume two approaches, namely a particular form of Hubble parameter\n$H$ and a solution for $f(T)$. We obtain the deceleration parameter, effective\nequation of state as well as torsion equation of state parameters from total\ndensity and pressure in both cases. It is interesting to mention here that the\ndeceleration and torsion equation of state represent transition from\ndeceleration to acceleration phase. We study the statefinder parameters under\nboth approaches which result that statefinder trajectories are found to attain\n$\\Lambda$CDM point. The comparison with observational data represents\nconsistent results. Also, we discuss the stability of reconstructed models\nthrough squared speed of sound which represents stability in late times.\n", "  The spectrum of the lightest bound states in N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills\ntheory with SU(2) gauge group, calculated on the lattice, is presented. The\nmasses have first been extrapolated towards vanishing gluino mass and then to\nthe continuum limit. The final picture is consistent with the formation of\ndegenerate supermultiplets.\n", "  In this paper, we have investigated $\\Lambda$CDM type cosmological model in\nHeckmann-Schucking space-time, by using 287 high red shift ($ .3 \\leq z \\leq\n1.4$ ) SN Ia data of observed absolute magnitude along with their possible\nerror from Union 2.1 compilation. We have used $\\chi^{2}$ test to compare Union\n2.1 compilation observed data and corresponding theoretical values of apparent\nmagnitude $(m)$. It is found that the best fit value for $(\\Omega_{m})_0$,\n$(\\Omega_{\\Lambda})_0$ and $(\\Omega_{\\sigma})_0$ are $0.2940$, $0.7058$ and\n$0.0002$ respectively and the derived model represents the features of\naccelerating universe which is consistent with recent astrophysical\nobservations.\n", "  In this paper, we extend the voter model (VM) and the threshold voter model\n(TVM) to include external influences modelled as a jump process. We study the\nnewly-formulated models both analytically and computationally, employing\ndiffusion approximations and mean field approximations. We derive results\npertaining to the probability of reaching consensus on a particular opinion and\nalso the expected consensus time. We find that although including an external\ninfluence leads to a faster consensus in general, this effect is more\npronounced in the VM as compared to the TVM. Our findings suggest the potential\nimportance of \"macro-level\" phenomena such as the external influences as\ncompared to \"micro-level\" local interactions.\n", "  A new singularity free model of anisotroipic compact star is proposed. The\nEinstein field equations are solved in closed form by utilizing Matese \\&\nWhitman mass function. The model parameters $\\rho$, $p_r$ and $p_t$ all are\nwell behaved inside the stellar interior and our model satisfies all the\nrequired conditions to be physically acceptable. The model given in the present\nwork is compatible with observational data of compact objects like SAX J\n1808.4-3658 (SS1), SAX J 1808.4-3658 (SS2) and 4U 1820-30. A particular model\nof 4U 1820-30 is studied in detail and found that it satisfies all the\ncondition needed for physically acceptable model. The present work is the\ngeneralization of Sharma and Ratanpal\\cite{sharma13} model for compact stars\nadmitting quadratic equation of state.\n", "  $Cs_2LiYCl_6:Ce^{3+}$ (CLYC) is an inorganic scintillator that has recently\ngarnered attention for its ability to detect and discriminate between gammas\nand thermal neutrons. We investigate several important performance parameters\nof three different solid state photomultipliers (SSPMs) when reading out CLYC\ncrystals: linearity, energy resolution, and pulse shape and discrimination\nability. These performance parameters are assessed at a variety of temperatures\nbetween -20$^{\\circ}$C and +50$^{\\circ}$C.\n", "  Long duration gamma-ray bursts are a rare subclass of stripped-envelope\ncore-collapse supernovae that launch collimated relativistic outflows (jets).\nAll gamma-ray-burst-associated supernovae are spectroscopically of Type Ic with\nbroad lines, but the fraction of broad-lined Type Ic supernovae harboring\nlow-luminosity gamma-ray-burst remains largely unconstrained. Some supernovae\nshould be accompanied by off-axis $\\gamma$-ray burst jets that remain invisible\ninitially, but then emerge as strong radio sources (as the jets decelerate).\nHowever, this critical prediction of the jet model for gamma-ray bursts has yet\nto be verified observationally. Here, we present K. G. Jansky Very Large Array\nobservations of 15 broad-lined supernovae of Type Ic discovered by the Palomar\nTransient Factory in an untargeted manner. Most of the supernovae in our sample\nexclude radio emission observationally similar to that of the radio-loud,\nrelativistic SN\\,1998bw. We constrain the fraction of 1998bw-like broad-lined\nType Ic supernovae to be <~ 41% (99.865% confidence). Most of the events in our\nsample also exclude off-axis jets similar to GRB 031203 and GRB 030329, but we\ncannot rule out off-axis gamma-ray-bursts expanding in a low-density wind\nenvironment. Three supernovae in our sample are detected in the radio. PTF11qcj\nand PTF14dby show late-time radio emission with average ejecta speeds of\n~(0.3-0.4)c, on the dividing line between relativistic and \"ordinary\"\nsupernovae. The speed of PTF11cmh radio ejecta is poorly constrained. We\nestimate that <~ 85% (99.865% confidence) of the broad-lined Type Ic supernovae\nin our sample may harbor off-axis $\\gamma$-ray-bursts expanding in media with\ndensities in the range probed by this study.\n", "  We investigate from a mathematical perspective how Feynman amplitudes appear\nin the low-energy limit of string amplitudes. In this paper, we prove the\nconvergence of the integrands. We derive this from results describing the\nasymptotic behavior of the height pairing between degree-zero divisors, as a\nfamily of Riemann surfaces degenerates. These are obtained by means of the\nnilpotent orbit theorem in Hodge theory.\n", "  The physics of nematic liquid crystals has been subject of intensive research\nsince the late 19th century. However, because of the limitations of chemistry\nthe focus has been centered around uni- and biaxial nematics associated with\nconstituents bearing a $D_{\\infty h}$ or $D_{2h}$ symmetry respectively. In\nview of general symmetries, however, these are singularly special since nematic\norder can in principle involve any point group symmetry. Given the progress in\ntailoring nano particles with particular shapes and interactions, this vast\nfamily of \"generalized nematics\" might become accessible in the laboratory.\nLittle is known since the order parameter theories associated with the highly\nsymmetric point groups are remarkably complicated, involving tensor order\nparameters of high rank. Here we show that the generic features of the\nstatistical physics of such systems can be studied in a highly flexible and\nefficient fashion using a mathematical tool borrowed from high energy physics:\ndiscrete non-Abelian gauge theory. Explicitly, we construct a family of lattice\ngauge models encapsulating nematic ordering of general three dimensional point\ngroup symmetries. We find that the most symmetrical \"generalized nematics\" are\nsubjected to thermal fluctuations of unprecedented severity. As a result, novel\nforms of fluctuation phenomena become possible. In particular, we demonstrate\nthat a vestigial phase carrying no more than chiral order becomes ubiquitous\ndeparting from high point group symmetry chiral building blocks, such as $I$,\n$O$ and $T$ symmetric matter.\n", "  We propose new five-dimensional gauge theory descriptions of six-dimensional\n$\\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ superconformal field theories arising from type IIA brane\nconfigurations including an $ON^0$-plane. The new five-dimensional gauge\ntheories may have $SO$, $Sp$, and $SU$ gauge groups and further broaden the\nlandscape of ultraviolet complete five-dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=1$\nsupersymmetric gauge theories. When we include an $O8^-$-plane in addition to\nan $ON^0$-plane, T-duality yields two $O7^-$-planes at the intersections of an\n$ON^0$-plane and two $O5^0$-planes. We propose a novel resolution of the\n$O7^-$-plane with four D7-branes in such a configuration, which enables us to\nobtain three different types of five-dimensional gauge theories, depending on\nwhether we resolve either none or one or two $O7^-$-planes. Such different\npossibilities yield a new five-dimensional duality between a D-type $SU$ quiver\nand an $SO-Sp$ quiver theories. We also claim that a twisted circle\ncompactification of a six-dimensional superconformal field theory may lead to a\nfive-dimensional gauge theory different from those obtained by a simple circle\ncompactification.\n", "  In spite of extended efforts, detecting thermoelectric effects in\nsuperconductors have proven to be a challenging task, due to the inherent\nsuperconducting particle-hole symmetry. Here we present a theoretical study of\nan experimentally attainable Superconductor -- Quantum Dot -- Superconductor\n(SC-QD-SC) Josephson Junction with highly tunable thermoelectric properties and\na thermal response that is far larger than previous suggestions. The QD energy\nlevel between the SCs breaks particle-hole symmetry in a gradual manner,\nallowing, in the presence of a temperature gradient, for gate controlled\nappearance of a superconducting thermo-phase. This thermo-phase increases up to\na maximal value of $\\pi/2$ after which thermovoltage is expected to develop.\nUsing time-independent Keldysh countour Green's functions we derive the exact\nthermo-phase and thermal response on the junction. These are shown to be orders\nof magnitude larger than usual SC tunnel junctions with a sharp dependence on\ngate voltage.\n", "  We investigate the dependence of the $L^1\\to L^\\infty$ dispersive estimates\nfor one-dimensional radial Schr\\\"o\\-din\\-ger operators on boundary conditions\nat $0$. In contrast to the case of additive perturbations, we show that the\nchange of a boundary condition at zero results in the change of the dispersive\ndecay estimates if the angular momentum is positive, $l\\in (0,1/2)$. However,\nfor nonpositive angular momenta, $l\\in (-1/2,0]$, the standard $O(|t|^{-1/2})$\ndecay remains true for all self-adjoint realizations.\n", "  We show that a generalized Asymmetric Exclusion Process called ASEP(q,j)\nintroduced by Carinci, Giardina, Redig and Sasamoto converges to the Cole-Hopf\nsolution to the KPZ equation under weak asymmetry scaling.\n", "  In a previous paper (Chassefi\\`ere et al., Icarus 223, 878-891, 2013), we\nhave shown that most volcanic sulfur released to early Mars atmosphere could\nhave been trapped in the cryosphere under the form of CO2-SO2 clathrates. Huge\namounts of sulfur, up to the equivalent of a ~1 bar atmosphere of SO2, would\nhave been stored in the Noachian cryosphere, then massively released to the\natmosphere during Hesperian due to rapidly decreasing CO2 pressure. It would\nhave resulted in the formation of the large sulfate deposits observed mainly in\nHesperian terrains, whereas no or little sulfates are found at the Noachian. In\nthe present paper, we first clarify some aspects of our previous work. We\ndiscuss the possibility of a smaller cooling effect of sulfur particles, or\neven of a net warming effect. We point out the fact that CO2-SO2 clathrates\nformed through a progressive enrichment of a preexisting reservoir of CO2\nclathrates and discuss processes potentially involved in the slow formation of\na SO2-rich upper cryosphere. We show that episodes of sudden destabilization at\nthe Hesperian may generate 1000 ppmv of SO2 in the atmosphere and contribute to\nmaintaining the surface temperature above the water freezing point.\n", "  Exact solutions of the Klein-Gordon-Fock (KGF) general relativistic equation\nthat describe the dynamics of a massive, electrically charged scalar particle\nin the curved spacetime geometry of a charged, rotating Kerr-Newman-(anti) de\nSitter black hole are investigated. In the general case of a rotating, charged,\ncosmological black hole the solution of the KGF equation with the method of\nseparation of variables results in Fuchsian differential equations for the\nradial and angular parts which contain more than three finite singularities and\nthereby generalise the Heun differential equations (HE). For particular values\nof the physical parameters (i.e mass of the scalar particle) these Fuchsian\nequations reduce to Heun equations and the solutions are expressed in terms of\nHeun functions. For other values of the parameters some of the extra singular\npoints are false singular points. We derive the conditions on the coefficients\nof the generalised Fuchsian equation such that a singular point is a false\npoint. In such a case the exact solution of the Fuchsian equation can in\nprinciple be simplified and expressed in terms of Heun functions. We also\nderive the exact solutions of the radial and angular equations for a massive\nscalar (charged) particle in the Kerr-Newman spacetime. The analytic solutions\nare expressed in terms of confluent Heun functions. Moreover, we derived the\nconstraints on the parameters of the theory such that the solution simplifies\nand expressed in terms of confluent Kummer hypergeometric functions. We also\ninvestigate the radial solutions in the KN case in the regions near the event\nhorizon and far from the black hole. Finally, we construct several expansions\nof the solutions of the HE in terms of generalised hypergeometric functions of\nLauricella-Appell.\n", "  Screening currents caused by varying magnetic fields degrade the homogeneity\nand stability of the magnetic fields created by $RE$BCO coated conductor coils.\nThey are responsible for the AC loss, which is also important for other power\napplications containing windings. Since real magnets contain coils exceeding\n10000 turns, accurate modeling tools for this number of turns are necessary for\nmagnet design. This article presents a fast numerical method to model coils\nwith no loss of accuracy. We model a 10400-turn coil for its real geometry and\ncoils of up to 40000 turns with the continuous approximation, which we checked\nthat introduces negligible errors. The screening currents, the Screening\nCurrent Induced Field (SCIF) and the AC loss is analyzed in detail. The SCIF is\nmaximum at the remnant state with a considerably large value and decreases\nsubstantially after one day of relaxation. The instantaneous AC loss for an\nanisotropic magnetic-field dependent $J_c$ is qualitatively different than for\na constant $J_c$, although the loss per cycle is similar. Saturation of the\nmagnetization currents at the end pancakes causes that the maximum AC loss at\nthe first ramp increases with $J_c$. The presented modeling tool can accurately\ncalculate the SCIF and AC loss in practical computing times for coils with any\nnumber of turns used in real windings, enabling parameter optimization.\n", "  High-gain amplifiers of electromagnetic signals operating near the quantum\nlimit are crucial for quantum information systems and ultrasensitive quantum\nmeasurements. However, the existing techniques have a limited gain-bandwidth\nproduct and only operate with weak input signals. Here we demonstrate a\ntwo-port optomechanical scheme for amplification and routing of microwave\nsignals, a system that simultaneously performs high-gain amplification and\nfrequency conversion in the quantum regime. Our amplifier, implemented in a\ntwo-cavity microwave optomechanical device, shows 41 dB of gain and has a high\ndynamic range, handling input signals up to $10^{13}$ photons per second, three\norders of magnitude more than corresponding Josephson parametric amplifiers. We\nshow that although the active medium, the mechanical resonator, is at a high\ntemperature far from the quantum limit, only 4.6 quanta of noise is added to\nthe input signal. Our method can be readily applied to a wide variety of\noptomechanical systems, including hybrid optical-microwave systems, creating a\nuniversal hub for signals at the quantum level.\n", "  The concept of the diffraction limit put forth by Ernst Abbe and others has\nbeen an important guiding principle limiting our ability to tightly focus\nclassical waves, such as light and sound, in the far field. In the past decade,\nnumerous reports have described focusing or imaging with light and sound \"below\nthe diffraction limit\". We argue that the diffraction limit defined in a\nreasonable way, for example in terms of the upper bound on the wave numbers\ncorresponding to the spatial Fourier components of the intensity profile, or in\nterms of the spot size into which at least 50% of the incident power can be\nfocused, still stands unbroken to this day. We review experimental observations\nof \"subwavelength\" or \"sub-diffraction-limit\" focusing, which can be\nprincipally broken down into three broad categories: (i) \"super-resolution\",\ni.e. the technique based on the modification of the pupil of the optical system\nto reduce the width of the central maximum in the intensity distribution at the\nexpense of increasing side bands; (ii) solid immersion lenses, making use of\nmetamaterials with a high effective index; (iii) concentration of intensity by\na subwavelength structure such as an antenna. Even though a lot of interesting\nwork has been done along these lines, none of the hitherto performed\nexperiments violated the sensibly defined diffraction limit.\n", "  Following the ideas of effective field theories, we derive classically\neffective field equations of recently developed Lorentz gauge theory of\ngravity. It is shown that Newton's gravitational constant emerges as an\neffective coupling parameter if an extremely small length is integrated out of\nthe underlying theory. The linear version of the effective theory is shown to\nbe fully consistent with the Newtonian gravity. We also derive a numerical\nsolution for the interior of a star and show that in the non-linear regions,\nthe behavior of the effective theory deviates from the predictions of general\nrelativity.\n", "  We exploit the reduced space of C. elegans postures to develop a novel\ntracking algorithm which captures both simple shapes and also self-occluding\ncoils, an important, yet unexplored, component of worm behavior. We apply our\nalgorithm to show that visually complex, coiled sequences are a superposition\nof two simpler patterns: the body wave dynamics and a head-curvature pulse. We\ndemonstrate the precise coiled dynamics of an escape response and uncover new\nbehaviors in spontaneous, large amplitude coils; deep reorientations occur\nthrough classical Omega-shaped postures and also through larger, new postural\nexcitations which we label here as delta-turns. We find that omega and delta\nturns occur independently, the serpentine analog of a random left-right step,\nsuggesting a distinct triggering mechanism. We also show that omega and delta\nturns display approximately equal rates and adapt to food-free conditions on a\nsimilar timescale, a simple strategy to avoid navigational bias.\n", "  We study the effect of a pure spin current on the Kondo singlet in a diluted\nmagnetic alloy using non-local lateral spin valve structures with highly spin\npolarized Co2FeSi electrodes. Temperature dependence of the non-local spin\nsignals shows a sharp reduction with decreasing temperature, followed by a\nplateau corresponding to the low temperature Fermi liquid regime below the\nKondo temperature (TK). The spin diffusion length of the Kondo alloy is found\nto increase with the evolution of spin accumulation. The results are in\nagreement with the intuitive description that the Kondo singlet cannot survive\nany more in sufficiently large spin accumulation even below TK.\n", "  Angular momentum distribution and its redistribution are of crucial\nimportance in formation and evolution of circumstellar disks. Many molecular\nline observations toward young stellar objects indicate that radial\ndistributions of the specific angular momentum $j$ are more or less universal.\nIn small scales, typically $R\\lesssim$ 100 AU, the specific angular momenta\ndistribute like $j\\propto r^{1/2}$, indicating existence of rotationally\nsupported disk. In outer regions, $R\\gtrsim$ 5000 AU, $j$ increases as the\nradius increases and the slope is steeper than unity, which is supposed to\nreflect the original angular momentum distributions in the maternal molecular\nclouds. And lastly there is a connecting region, 100 AU $\\lesssim R \\lesssim$\n5000 AU, in which $j$-distribution looks almost flat. While this is often\ninterpreted as a consequence of conservation of the specific angular momentum,\nit actually is insufficient and requires a stronger condition that the initial\ndistribution of $j$ must be spatially uniform. However, this requirement is\nunrealistic and inconsistent with observations. In this work, we propose a\nsimple alternative explanation; the flat $j$ profile is produced by strong\nprolongation due to the large velocity gradient in the accreting flow no matter\nwhat the initial $j$ distribution is. We provide a simple analytic model for\ngravitational collapse of molecular clouds. This model can be used to estimate\nages of protostars based solely on the observed rotation profile. We\ndemonstrate its validity in comparison with hydrodynamic simulations, and apply\nthe model to young stellar objects such as L1527 IRS, TMC-1A and B335.\n", "  We study nonlinear optical response of graphene in the quantum Hall regime to\nan intense laser pulse. In particular, we consider harmonic generation process.\nWe demonstrate that the generalized magneto-optical conductivity of graphene on\nthe harmonics of a strong pump laser radiation has a characteristic Hall\nplateaus feature. The plateaus heights depend on the laser intensity and\nbroadening of Landau levels, so that are not quantized exactly. This nonlinear\neffect remains robust against the significant broadening of Landau levels. We\npredict realization of an experiment through the observation of the third\nharmonic signal and nonlinear Faraday effect, which are within the experimental\nfeasibility.\n", "  We report on B2-ordering dependence of magnetostatic surface spin waves in\nferromagnetic FeRh at room temperature. Spin waves transmit over a distance\nlonger than 21 {\\mu}m in highly ordered FeRh alloys even with relatively large\nspin-orbit interaction. The long-range transmission likely arises from the\ninduced Rh moments of the ordered FeRh due to ferromagnetic exchange\ninteraction between Fe and Rh. The results indicate a potential of using FeRh\nin spintronic and magnonic applications by integrating with other fascinating\nmagnetic characteristics of FeRh such as electric field induced magnetic phase\ntransition.\n", "  Optimal embedding in the three-dimensional space of exponentially growing\nsqueezed surfaces, like plants leaves, or 2D colonies of exponentially\nreproducing cells, is considered in the framework of conformal approach. It is\nshown that the boundary profile of a growing tissue is described by the 2D\neikonal equation, which provides the geometric optic approximation for the wave\nfront propagating in the media with inhomogeneous refraction coefficient. The\nvariety of optimal surfaces embedded in 3D is controlled by spatial dependence\nof the refraction coefficient which, in turn, is dictated by the local growth\nprotocol.\n", "  The masses and the leptonic decay constants of vector and axial vector\nheavy-heavy mesons are calculated using the thermal QCD sum rules approach.\nWhile obtaining the QCD sum rules, additional operators in the Wilson expansion\nand also temperature dependency of the continuum threshold are taken into\naccount. The masses and the decay constants remained unchanged up to\n$T\\simeq100~MeV$. After that point, they start to diminish. At the critical\ntemperature, the masses decreased about $3\\%$, $5\\%$ and $14\\%$ for the vector\nmesons $\\Upsilon$, $B_{c}$ and $J/\\psi$; $6\\%$, $7\\%$ and $22\\%$ for the axial\nvector mesons $\\chi_{b1}$, $B_{c}$ and $\\chi_{c1}$, respectively. The decay\nconstants reached about less than $20\\%$ of their vacuum values. The obtained\nresults of the thermal mass and decay constant calculations at zero temperature\nare in a very good agreement with the other non-perturbative calculations at\nvacuum as well as with the experimental data.\n", "  A triple-heterojunction (3HJ) design is employed to improve p-type InAs/GaSb\nheterojunction (HJ) tunnel FETs. The added two HJs (AlInAsSb/InAs in the source\nand GaSb/AlSb in the channel) significantly shorten the tunnel distance and\ncreate two resonant states, greatly improving the ON state tunneling\nprobability. Moreover, the source Fermi degeneracy is reduced by the increased\nsource (AlInAsSb) density of states and the OFF state leakage is reduced by the\nheavier channel (AlSb) hole effective masses. Quantum ballistic transport\nsimulations show, that with V_{DD} = 0.3V and I_{OFF} = 10^{-3}A/m, I_{ON} of\n582A=m (488A=m) is obtained at 30nm (15nm) channel length, which is comparable\nto n-type 3HJ counterpart and significantly exceeding p-type silicon MOSFET.\nSimultaneously, the nonlinear turn on and delayed saturation in the output\ncharacteristics are also greatly improved.\n", "  Topological insulators (TIs) are bulk insulators with exotic 'topologically\nprotected' surface conducting modes. It has recently been pointed out that when\nstacked together, interactions between surface modes can induce diverse phases\nincluding the TI, Dirac semimetal, and Weyl semimetal. However, currently a\nfull experimental understanding of the conditions under which topological modes\ninteract is lacking. Here, working with multilayers of the TI Sb$_2$Te$_3$ and\nthe band insulator GeTe, we provide experimental evidence of a multiple\ntopological modes in a single Sb$_2$Te$_3$-GeTe-Sb$_2$Te$_3$ structure.\nFurthermore, we show that reducing the thickness of the GeTe layer induces a\nphase transition from a Dirac-like phase to a gapped phase. By comparing\ndifferent multilayer structures we demonstrate that this transition occurs due\nto the hybridisation of states associated with different TI films. Our results\ndemonstrate that the Sb$_2$Te$_3$-GeTe system offers strong potential towards\nmanipulating topological states as well as towards controlledly inducing\nvarious topological phases.\n", "  Atomic force microscope (AFM) users often calibrate the spring constants of\ncantilevers using functionality built into individual instruments. This is\nperformed without reference to a global standard, which hinders robust\ncomparison of force measurements reported by different laboratories. In this\narticle, we describe a virtual instrument (an internet-based initiative)\nwhereby users from all laboratories can instantly and quantitatively compare\ntheir calibration measurements to those of others - standardising AFM force\nmeasurements - and simultaneously enabling non-invasive calibration of AFM\ncantilevers of any geometry. This global calibration initiative requires no\nadditional instrumentation or data processing on the part of the user. It\nutilises a single website where users upload currently available data. A\nproof-of-principle demonstration of this initiative is presented using measured\ndata from five independent laboratories across three countries, which also\nallows for an assessment of current calibration.\n", "  We present the first ab initio calculations for $p$-shell hypernuclei\nincluding hyperon-nucleon-nucleon (YNN) contributions induced by a Similarity\nRenormalization Group transformation of the initial hyperon-nucleon\ninteraction. The transformation including the YNN terms conserves the spectrum\nof the Hamiltonian while drastically improving model-space convergence of the\nImportance-Truncated No-Core Shell Model, allowing a precise extraction of\nbinding and excitation energies. Results using a hyperon-nucleon interaction at\nleading order in chiral effective field theory for lower- to mid-$p$-shell\nhypernuclei show a good reproduction of experimental excitation energies while\nhyperon binding energies are typically overestimated. The induced YNN\ncontributions are strongly repulsive and we show that they are related to a\ndecoupling of the $\\Sigma$ hyperons from the hypernuclear system, i.e., a\nsuppression of the $\\Lambda$-$\\Sigma$ conversion terms in the Hamiltonian. This\nis linked to the so-called hyperon puzzle in neutron-star physics and provides\na basic mechanism for the explanation of strong $\\Lambda$NN three-baryon\nforces.\n", "  We study the algebraic properties of plethystic vertex operators, introduced\nin J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 43 405202 (2010), underlying the structure of\nsymmetric functions associated with certain generalized universal character\nrings of subgroups of the general linear group, defined to stabilize tensors of\nYoung symmetry type characterized by a partition of arbitrary shape \\pi. Here\nwe establish an extension of the well-known boson-fermion correspondence\ninvolving Schur functions and their associated (Bernstein) vertex operators:\nfor each \\pi, the modes generated by the plethystic vertex operators and their\nsuitably constructed duals, satisfy the anticommutation relations of a complex\nClifford algebra. The combinatorial manipulations underlying the results\ninvolve exchange identities exploiting the Hopf-algebraic structure of certain\nsymmetric function series and their plethysms.\n", "  Presently, classical optical communication systems employing strong laser\npulses and quantum key distribution (QKD) systems working at single-photon\nlevels are very different communication modalities. Dedicated devices are\ncommonly required to implement QKD. In this paper, we propose a scheme which\nallows classical communication and QKD to be implemented simultaneously using\nthe same communication infrastructure. More specially, we propose a coherent\ncommunication scheme where both the bits for classical communication and the\nGaussian distributed random numbers for QKD are encoded on the same weak\ncoherent pulse, and decoded by the same coherent receiver. Simulation results\nbased on practical system parameters show that both deterministic classical\ncommunication with a bit error rate of 10^{-9} and secure key distribution\ncould be achieved over tens of kilometers single mode fibers. It is conceivable\nthat in the future coherent optical communication network, QKD is operated in\nthe background of classical communication at a minimal cost.\n", "  The contributions of $G'$-boson predicted by the chiral color symmetry of\nquarks to the differential dijet cross-sections in $pp$-collisions at the LHC\nare calculated and analysed in dependence on two free parameters of the model,\nthe $G'$ mass $m_{G'}$ and mixing angle $\\theta_G$. The exclusion and\nconsistency $m_{G'}-\\theta_G$ regions imposed by the ATLAS and CMS data on\ndijet cross-sections are found. Using the CT10 (MSTW~2008) PDF set we show that\nthe $G'$-boson for $\\theta_G=45^{\\circ}$, i.e. the axigluon, with the masses\n$m_{G'} < 2.3 \\,\\, (2.6) \\,\\, \\mbox{TeV}$ and $m_{G'} < 3.35 \\,\\, (3.25) \\,\\,\n\\mbox{TeV}$ is excluded at the probability level of $95\\%$ by the ATLAS and CMS\ndijet data respectively. For the other values of $\\theta_G$ the exclusion\nlimits are more stringent. The $m_{G'}-\\theta_G$ regions consistent with these\ndata at $CL=68\\%$ and $CL=90\\%$ are also found.\n", "  Searches for new physics by the CMS collaboration are interpreted in the\nframework of the phenomenological minimal supersymmetric standard model\n(pMSSM). The data samples used in this study were collected at sqrt(s) = 7 and\n8 TeV and have integrated luminosities of 5.0 and 19.5 inverse-femtobarns,\nrespectively. A global Bayesian analysis is performed, incorporating results\nfrom a broad range of CMS supersymmetry searches, as well as constraints from\nother experiments. Because the pMSSM incorporates several well-motivated\nassumptions that reduce the 120 parameters of the MSSM to just 19 parameters\ndefined at the electroweak scale, it is possible to assess the results of the\nstudy in a relatively straightforward way. Approximately half of the model\npoints in a potentially accessible subspace of the pMSSM are excluded,\nincluding all pMSSM model points with a gluino mass below 500 GeV, as well as\nmodels with a squark mass less than 300 GeV. Models with chargino and\nneutralino masses below 200 GeV are disfavored, but no mass range of model\npoints can be ruled out based on the analyses considered. The nonexcluded\nregions in the pMSSM parameter space are characterized in terms of physical\nprocesses and key observables, and implications for future searches are\ndiscussed.\n", "  A new way of orthogonalizing ensembles of vectors by \"lifting\" them to higher\ndimensions is introduced. This method can potentially be utilized for solving\nquantum decision and computing problems.\n", "  It has been argued recently by Almheiri and Polchinski that the near-horizon\nconformal symmetry of extremal black holes must be broken due to gravitational\nbackreaction at an IR scale linear in $G_N$. In this paper, we show that this\nscale coincides with the so-called `thermodynamic mass gap' of near-extremal\nblack holes, a scale which signals the breakdown of their thermodynamic\ndescription. We also develop a method which extends the analysis of Almheiri\nand Polchinski to more complicated models with extremal throats by studying the\nbulk linearized quantum field theory. Moreover, we show how their original\nmodel correctly captures the universal physics of the near-horizon region of\nnear-extremal black holes at tree level, and conclude that this equivalence of\nthe conformal breaking and mass gap scale is general.\n", "  Recent studies have dealt with the electronic and magnetic ground state\nproperties of the tetraboride material MnB$_4$. So far, however, the ground\nstate properties could not be established unambiguously. Therefore, here we\npresent an experimental study on single-crystalline MnB$_4$ by means of\nresistivity and magnetization measurements. For this, we have developed a\nsample holder that allows four-point ac resistivity measurements on these very\nsmall ($\\sim$\\,100\\,$\\mu$m) samples. With our data we establish that the\nelectronic ground state of MnB$_4$ is intrinsically that of a pseudo-gap\nsystem, in agreement with recent band structure calculations. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate that the material does neither show magnetic order nor a behavior\narising from the vicinity to a magnetically ordered state, this way disproving\nprevious claims.\n", "  Motivated by the recent experimental report of a possible light-induced\nsuperconductivity in A3C60 at high temperature [Mitrano et al., Nature 530, 451\n(2016)], we investigate theoretical mechanisms for enhanced superconductivity\nin A3C60 fullerenes. We find that an `interaction imbalance' corresponding to a\nsmaller value of the Coulomb matrix element for two of the molecular orbitals\nin comparison to the third one, efficiently enhances superconductivity.\nFurthermore, we perform first-principle calculations of the changes in the\nelectronic structure and in the screened Coulomb matrix elements of A3C60,\nbrought in by the deformation associated with the pumped T1u intra-molecular\nmode. We find that an interaction imbalance is indeed induced, with a favorable\nsign and magnitude for superconductivity enhancement. The physical mechanism\nresponsible for this enhancement consists in a stabilisation of the\nintra-molecular states containing a singlet pair, while preserving the orbital\nfluctuations allowing for a coherent inter-orbital delocalization of the pair.\nOther perturbations have also been considered and found to be detrimental to\nsuperconductivity. The light-induced deformation and ensuing interaction\nimbalance is shown to bring superconductivity further into the strong-coupling\nregime.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the color-kinematics duality in nonlinear sigma\nmodel (NLSM). We present explicit polynomial expressions for the kinematic\nnumerators (BCJ numerators). The calculation is done separately in two\nparametrization schemes of the theory using Kawai-Lewellen-Tye relation\ninspired technique, both lead to polynomial numerators. We summarize the\ncalculation in each case into a set of rules that generates BCJ numerators for\nall multilplicities. In Cayley parametrization we find the numerator is\ndescribed by a particularly simple formula solely in terms of momentum kernel.\n", "  We present a fully differential next-to-next-to-leading order calculation of\nt-channel single top-quark production and decay at the LHC under narrow-width\napproximation and neglecting cross-talk between incoming protons. We focus on\nthe fiducial cross sections at 13 TeV, finding that the next-to-next-to-leading\norder QCD corrections can reach the level of -6%. The scale variations are\nreduced to the level of a percent. Our results can be used to improve\nexperimental acceptance estimates and the measurements of the single top-quark\nproduction cross section and the top-quark electroweak couplings.\n", "  The paper collates a complete list of nodeless regular almost-everywhere\nholomorphic (AEH) solutions for a subset of rational canonical Sturm-Liouville\nequations (RCSLEs) exactly quantized on a finite interval by classical Jacobi\npolynomials. The subset was constrained by the requirement that the appropriate\nLiouville transformation results in the Schrodinger equation on the line. The\ncommon remarkable feature of the selected nodeless solutions co-existent with\nthe discrete energy spectrum is that they can be used as seed functions for\nmulti-step 'canonical Liouville-Darboux transformations' (CLDTs) to convert the\nGauss-Reference (GRef) potential (appearing in the resultant Schrodinger\nequation) into its isospectral rational SUSY partners conditionally exactly\nquantized by the so-called 'Jacobi-Seed' Heine polynomials.\n", "  There is evidence that the well-established mass-metallicity relation in\ngalaxies is correlated with a third parameter: star formation rate (SFR). The\nstrength of this correlation may be used to disentangle the relative importance\nof different physical processes (e.g., infall of pristine gas, metal-enriched\noutflows) in governing chemical evolution. However, all three parameters are\nsusceptible to biases that might affect the observed strength of the relation\nbetween them. We analyze possible sources of systematic error, including sample\nbias, application of signal-to-noise ratio cuts on emission lines, choice of\nmetallicity calibration, uncertainty in stellar mass determination, aperture\neffects, and dust. We present the first analysis of the relation between\nstellar mass, gas phase metallicity, and SFR using strong line abundance\ndiagnostics from Dopita et al. (2013) for ~130,000 star-forming galaxies in the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey and provide a detailed comparison of these diagnostics\nin an appendix. Using these abundance diagnostics yields a 30-55% weaker\nanti-correlation between metallicity and SFR at fixed stellar mass than that\nreported by Mannucci et al. (2010). We find that, for all abundance\ndiagnostics, the anti-correlation with SFR is stronger for the relatively few\ngalaxies whose current SFRs are elevated above their past average SFRs. This is\nalso true for the new abundance diagnostic of Dopita et al. (2016), which gives\nanti-correlation between metallicity and SFR only in the high specific star\nformation rate (sSFR) regime, in contrast to the recent results of Kashino et\nal. (2016). The poorly constrained strength of the relation between stellar\nmass, metallicity, and SFR must be carefully accounted for in theoretical\nstudies of chemical evolution.\n", "  We make the assumption that the vacuum correlators of the gauge invariant\nkinetic term of the Higgs doublet are the same before and after the spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking of the theory. Based on this we determine the mass of the\nstandard model Higgs boson at $m_h \\approx 125.07$ GeV by considering one loop\nand the most relevant two loop corrections. This result might suggest that\nthere is a single Higgs boson doublet that contributes to the electroweak\nsymmetry breaking.\n", "  Modified gravity theories with a screening mechanism have acquired much\ninterest recently in the quest for a viable alternative to General Relativity\non cosmological scales, given their intrinsic property of being able to pass\nSolar System scale tests and, at the same time, to possibly drive universe\nacceleration on much larger scales. Here, we explore the possibility that the\nsame screening mechanism, or its breaking at a certain astrophysical scale,\nmight be responsible of those gravitational effects which, in the context of\ngeneral relativity, are generally attributed to Dark Matter. We consider a\nrecently proposed extension of covariant Galileon models in the so-called\n\"beyond Horndeski\" scenario, where a breaking of the Vainshtein mechanism is\npossible and, thus, some peculiar observational signatures should be detectable\nand make it distinguishable from general relativity. We apply this model to a\nsample of clusters of galaxies observed under the \\textit{CLASH} survey, using\nboth new data from gravitational lensing events and archival data from X-ray\nintra-cluster hot gas observations. In particular, we use the latter to model\nthe gas density, and then use it as the only ingredient in the matter clusters'\nbudget to calculate the expected lensing convergence map. Results show that, in\nthe context of this extended Galileon, the assumption of having only gas and no\nDark Matter at all in the clusters is able to match observations. We also\nobtain narrow and very interesting bounds on the parameters which characterize\nthis model. In particular, we find that, at least for one of them, the general\nrelativity limit is excluded at $2\\sigma$ confidence level, thus making this\nmodel clearly statistically different and competitive with respect to general\nrelativity.\n", "  A new feature of the rotating black holes is the existence in their\nergosphere of trajectories of particles with negative and zero energies. Here\nwe analyze general properties of such trajectories comparing them with usual\ntrajectories of particles with positive energy. A comparison with the situation\nin rotating coordinate frame in Minkowski space-time is made. The possibility\nof the unbounded growth of the energy of two colliding particles in the centre\nof mass frame in the ergosphere is analysed.\n", "  Most experimental and theoretical studies of adiabatic optimization use\nstoquastic Hamiltonians, whose ground states are expressible using only real\nnonnegative amplitudes. This raises a question as to whether classical Monte\nCarlo methods can simulate stoquastic adiabatic algorithms with polynomial\noverhead. Here, we analyze diffusion Monte Carlo algorithms. We argue that,\nbased on differences between L1 and L2 normalized states, these algorithms\nsuffer from certain obstructions preventing them from efficiently simulating\nstoquastic adiabatic evolution in generality. In practice however, we obtain\ngood performance by introducing a method that we call Substochastic Monte\nCarlo. In fact, our simulations are good classical optimization algorithms in\ntheir own right, competitive with the best previously known heuristic solvers\nfor MAX-k-SAT at k=2,3,4.\n", "  We study the effect of the chiral symmetry restoration (CSR) on heavy-ion\ncollisions observables in the energy range $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=3-20 GeV within the\nParton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD) transport approach. The PHSD includes the\ndeconfinement phase transition as well as essential aspects of CSR in the dense\nand hot hadronic medium, which are incorporated in the Schwinger mechanism for\nthe hadronic particle production. We adopt different parametrizations of the\nnuclear equation of state from the non-linear $\\sigma-\\omega$ model, which\nenter in the computation of the quark scalar density for the CSR mechanism, in\norder to estimate the uncertainty in our calculations.\n", "  No-signaling theories, which can contain nonlocal correlations stronger than\nclassical correlations but limited by the no-signaling condition, have deepened\nour understanding of the quantum theory. In principle, the nonlocality of these\ntheories can be verified via Bell tests. In practice, however, inefficient\ndetectors may make Bell tests unreliable, which is called the detection\nefficiency loophole. In this work, we show almost tight lower and upper bounds\nof the detector efficiency requirement for demonstrating the nonlocality of\nno-signaling theories, by designing a general class of Bell tests. In\nparticular, we show tight bounds for two scenarios: the bipartite case and the\nmultipartite case with a large number of parties. To some extent, these tight\nefficiency bounds quantify the nonlocality of no-signaling theories.\nFurthermore, our result shows that the detector efficiency can be arbitrarily\nlow even for Bell tests with two parties, by increasing the number of\nmeasurement settings. Our work also sheds light on the detector efficiency\nrequirement for showing the nonlocality of the quantum theory.\n", "  We consider $r$-process nucleosynthesis in outflows from black hole accretion\ndiscs formed in double neutron star and neutron star -- black hole mergers.\nThese outflows, powered by angular momentum transport processes and nuclear\nrecombination, represent an important -- and in some cases dominant --\ncontribution to the total mass ejected by the merger. Here we calculate the\nnucleosynthesis yields from disc outflows using thermodynamic trajectories from\nhydrodynamic simulations, coupled to a nuclear reaction network. We find that\noutflows produce a robust abundance pattern around the second $r$-process peak\n(mass number $A \\sim 130$), independent of model parameters, with significant\nproduction of $A < 130$ nuclei. This implies that dynamical ejecta with high\nelectron fraction may not be required to explain the observed abundances of\n$r$-process elements in metal poor stars. Disc outflows reach the third peak ($\nA \\sim 195$) in most of our simulations, although the amounts produced depend\nsensitively on the disc viscosity, initial mass or entropy of the torus, and\nnuclear physics inputs. Some of our models produce an abundance spike at $A =\n132$ that is absent in the Solar system $r$-process distribution. The spike\narises from convection in the disc and depends on the treatment of nuclear\nheating in the simulations. We conclude that disc outflows provide an important\n-- and perhaps dominant -- contribution to the $r$-process yields of compact\nbinary mergers, and hence must be included when assessing the contribution of\nthese systems to the inventory of $r$-process elements in the Galaxy.\n", "  We use a 440.5 ks Chandra observation of the $\\approx$500-Myr-old open\ncluster M37 to derive the X-ray luminosity functions of its $\\leq1.2$\n$M_{\\odot}$ stars. Combining detections of 162 M37 members with upper limits\nfor 160 non-detections, we find that its G, K, and M stars have a similar\nmedian (0.5$-$7 keV) X-ray luminosity L$_X =10^{29.0}$ erg/s, whereas the\nL$_X$-to-bolometric-luminosity ratio (L$_X$/L$_{bol}$) indicates that M stars\nare more active than G and K stars by $\\approx$1 order of magnitude at 500 Myr.\nTo characterize the evolution of magnetic activity in low-mass stars over their\nfirst $\\approx$600 Myr, we consolidate X-ray and optical data from the\nliterature for stars in six other open clusters: from youngest to oldest, the\nOrion Nebula Cluster (ONC), NGC 2547, NGC 2516, the Pleiades, NGC 6475, and the\nHyades. For these, we homogenize the conversion of instrumental count rates to\nL$_X$ by applying the same one-temperature emission model as for M37, and\nobtain masses using the same empirical mass-absolute magnitude relation (except\nfor the ONC). We find that for G and K stars X-ray activity decreases\n$\\approx$2 orders of magnitude over their first 600 Myr, and for M stars,\n$\\approx$1.5. The decay rate of the median L$_X$ follows the relation L$_X\n\\propto~t^b$, where $b=-0.61\\pm0.12$ for G, $-0.82\\pm0.16$ for K, and\n$-0.40\\pm0.17$ for M stars. In L$_X$/L$_{bol}$ space, the slopes are\n$-0.68\\pm0.12$, $-0.81\\pm0.19$, and $-0.61\\pm0.12$, respectively. These results\nsuggest that for low-mass stars the age-activity relation steepens after\n$\\approx$625 Myr, consistent with the faster decay in activity observed in\nsolar analogs at $t>1$ Gyr.\n", "  We theoretically study the circularly polarized light-induced Floquet state\nin line-node semimetals with time-reversal symmetry and inversion symmetry. It\nis found that the Floquet state can show the photovoltaic anomalous Hall effect\nwhen an applied circularly polarized light gaps out the line node in the bulk\nand leave Weyl point nodes. The Hall conductivity is sensitive to the location\nof Fermi level: When the Fermi level locates at the node, the Hall conductivity\ndepends on the radius of line node and is nearly independent of the intensity\nof light. Away from the line node, the Hall conductivity is dependent on the\nintensity of light. Such a sensitive Fermi-level dependence of the Hall\nconductivity in the presence of a weak laser intensity can have applications in\nphototransistors based on thin films of line-node semimetals.\n", "  We show that a Fermi surface reconstruction due to spiral antiferromagnetic\norder may explain the rapid change in the Hall number as recently observed near\noptimal doping in cuprate superconductors [Badoux~\\textit{et. al.}, Nature\n\\textbf{531}, 210 (2016)]. The single-particle spectral function in the spiral\nstate exhibits hole pockets which look like Fermi arcs due to a strong momentum\ndependence of the spectral weight. Adding charge-density wave order further\nreduces the Fermi surface to a single electron pocket. We propose quantum\noscillation measurements to distinguish between commensurate and spiral\nantiferromagnetic order. Similar results apply to certain metals in which\ntopological order replaces antiferromagnetic order.\n", "  We investigate the static and spherically symmetric solutions in a class of\nthe generalized Proca theory with the nonminimal coupling to the Einstein\ntensor. First, we show that the solutions in the scalar-tensor theory with the\nnonminimal derivative coupling to the Einstein tensor can be those in the\ngeneralized Proca theory with the vanishing field strength. We then show that\nwhen the field strength takes the nonzero value the static and spherically\nsymmetric solutions can be found only for the specific value of the nonminimal\ncoupling constant. Second, we investigate the first-order slow-rotation\ncorrections to the static and spherically symmetric background. We find that\nfor the background with the vanishing electric field strength the slowly\nrotating solution is identical to the Kerr- (anti-) de Sitter solutions in\ngeneral relativity. On the other hand, for the background with the nonvanishing\nelectric field strength the stealth property can realized at the first order in\nthe slow-rotation approximation.\n", "  In some planet formation theories, protoplanets grow gravitationally within a\nyoung star's protoplanetary disk, a signature of which may be a localized\ndisturbance in the disk's radial and/or vertical structure. Using time-series\nphotometric observations by the Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope South\n(KELT-South) project and the All-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN),\ncombined with archival observations, we present the discovery of two extended\ndimming events of the young star, DM Ori. This young system faded by $\\sim$1.5\nmag from 2000 March to 2002 August and then again in 2013 January until 2014\nSeptember (depth $\\sim$1.7 mag). We constrain the duration of the 2000-2002\ndimming to be $<$ 860 days, and the event in 2013-2014 to be $<$ 585 days,\nseparated by $\\sim$12.5 years. A model of the spectral energy distribution\n(SED) indicates a large infrared excess consistent with an extensive\ncircumstellar disk. Using basic kinematic arguments, we propose that DM Ori is\nlikely being periodically occulted by a feature (possibly a warp or\nperturbation) in its circumstellar disk. In this scenario, the occulting\nfeature is located $>$6 AU from the host star, moving at $\\sim$14.6 km/s, and\nis $\\sim$4.9 AU in width. This localized structure may indicate a disturbance\nsuch as may be caused by a protoplanet early in its formation.\n", "  - Paper withdrawn by the author - CMOS Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors for\ncharged particle tracking are considered as technology for numerous experiments\nin heavy ion and particle physics. To match the requirements for those\napplications in terms of tolerance to non-ionizing radiation, it is being tried\nto deplete the sensitive volume of the, traditionally non-depleted, silicon\nsensors.\n  We study the feasibility of this approach for the common case that the\ncollection diodes of the pixel are small as compared to the pixel pitch. An\nanalytic equation predicting the thickness of the depletion depth and the\ncapacity of this point-like junction is introduced. We find that the\npredictions of this equations differs qualitatively from the usual results for\nflat PN junctions and that $dC/dU$-measurements are not suited to measure the\ndepletion depth of diodes with point-like geometry. The predictions of the\nequation is compared with measurements on the depletion depth of CMOS sensors,\nwhich were carried out with a novel measurement protocol. It is found that the\nequation and the measurement results match with each other. By comparing our\nfindings with TCAD simulations, we find that precise simulation models matches\nthe empirical findings while simplified models overestimate the depletion depth\ndramatically. A potential explanation for this finding is introduced and the\nconsequences for the design of CMOS sensors are discussed.\n", "  We perform a theoretical study of non-equilibrium effects in charge transport\nthrough a hybrid single-electron transistor based on a small normal metal (N)\nisland with the gate-controlled number of electrons, tunnel-coupled to\nvoltage-biased superconducting (S) electrodes (SINIS). Focusing on the\nturnstile mode of the transistor operation with the gate voltage driven\nperiodically, and electrons on the island being out of equilibrium, we find\nthat the current quantization accuracy is a non-monotonic function of the\nrelaxation rate $\\Gamma_{\\mathcal{F}}$ of the distribution function\n$\\mathcal{F}(\\epsilon)$ on the island due to tunneling, as compared to the\ndrive frequency $f$, electron-electron $1/\\tau_{ee}$ and electron-phonon\n$1/\\tau_{eph}$ relaxation rates. Surprisingly, in the strongly non-equilibrium\nregime, $f\\gg \\Gamma_{\\mathcal{F}}\\gg\\tau_{ee}^{-1},\\tau_{eph}^{-1}$, the\nturnstile current plateau is recovered, similarly to the ideal equilibrium\nregime, $\\tau_{eph}^{-1}\\gg \\Gamma_{\\mathcal{F}}$. The plateau is destroyed in\nthe quasiequilibrium regime when the electron-electron relaxation is faster\nthan tunneling.\n", "  We present a systematic study of the ac susceptibility of the chiral magnet\nFe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$Si with $x$ = 0.30 covering four orders of magnitude in\nfrequencies from 0.1 Hz to 1 kHz, with particular emphasis to the pronounced\nhistory dependence. Characteristic relaxation times ranging from a few\nmilliseconds to tens of seconds are observed around the skyrmion lattice\nA-phase, the helical-to-conical transition and in a region above $T_C$. The\ndistribution of relaxation frequencies around the A-phase is broad, asymmetric\nand originates from multiple coexisting relaxation processes. The pronounced\ndependence of the magnetic phase diagram on the magnetic history and cooling\nrates as well as the asymmetric frequency dependence and slow dynamics suggest\nmore complicated physical phenomena in Fe$_{0.7}$Co$_{0.3}$Si than in other\nchiral magnets.\n", "  We investigate the spin relaxation and Kondo resistivity caused by magnetic\nimpurities in doped transition metal dichalcogenides monolayers. We show that\nmomentum and spin relaxation times due to the exchange interaction by magnetic\nimpurities, are much longer when the Fermi level is inside the spin split\nregion of the valence band. In contrast to the spin relaxation, we find that\nthe dependence of Kondo temperature $T_K$ on the doping is not strongly\naffected by the spin-orbit induced splitting, although only one of the spin\nspecies are present at each valley. This result, which is obtained using both\nperturbation theory and poor man's scaling methods, originates from the\nintervalley spin-flip scattering in the spin-split region. We further\ndemonstrate the decline in the conductivity with temperatures close to $T_K$\nwhich can vary with the doping. Our findings reveal the qualitative difference\nwith the Kondo physics in conventional metallic systems and other Dirac\nmaterials.\n", "  We theoretically study the motion of magnetic colloidal particles above a\nmagnetic pattern and compare the predictions with Brownian dynamics\nsimulations. The pattern consists of alternating square domains of positive and\nnegative magnetization. The colloidal motion is driven by periodic modulation\nloops of an external magnetic field. There exist loops that induce\ntopologically protected colloidal transport between two different unit cells of\nthe pattern. The transport is very robust against internal and external\nperturbations. Theory and simulations are in perfect agreement.\n", "  The spin resonance peak in the iron-based superconductors is observed in\ninelastic neutron scattering experiments and agrees well with predicted results\nfor the extended s-wave ($s_\\pm$) gap symmetry. On the basis of four-band and\nthree-orbital tight binding models we study the effect of nonmagnetic disorder\non the resonance peak. Spin susceptibility is calculated in the random phase\napproximation with the renormalization of the quasiparticle self-energy due to\nthe impurity scattering in the static Born approximation. We find that the spin\nresonance becomes broader with the increase of disorder and its energy shifts\nto higher frequencies. For the same amount of disorder the spin response in the\n$s_\\pm$ state is still distinct from that of the $s_{++}$ state.\n", "  We report on a direct measurement of cation and anion sub-lattice strain in\nan InAs/GaSb type-II strained layer superlattice (T2SLs) using atomic\nresolution Z-contrast imaging and advanced image processing. Atomic column\npositions in InAs and GaSb are determined by separating the cation and anion\npeak intensities. Analysis of the InAs/GaSb T2SLs reveals the compressive\nstrain in the nominal GaSb layer and tensile strain at interfaces between\nconstituent layers, which indicate In incorporation into the nominal GaSb layer\nand the formation of GaAs like interfaces, respectively. The results are\ncompared with the model-dependent X-ray diffraction measurements in terms of\ninterfacial chemical intermixing and strain. Together, these techniques provide\na robust measurement of atomic-scale strain which is vital to determine T2SL\nproperties.\n", "  Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves have been considered as energy sources for\nheating the solar chromosphere and the corona. Although MHD waves have been\nobserved in the solar atmosphere, there are a lack of quantitative estimates on\nthe energy transfer and dissipation in the atmosphere. We performed\nsimultaneous Hinode and IRIS observations of a sunspot umbra to derive the\nupward energy fluxes at two different atmospheric layers (photosphere and lower\ntransition region) and estimate the energy dissipation. The observations\nrevealed some properties of the observed periodic oscillations in physical\nquantities, such as their phase relations, temporal behaviors, and power\nspectra, making a conclusion that standing slow-mode waves are dominant at the\nphotosphere with their high-frequency leakage, which is observed as upward\nwaves at the chromosphere and the lower transition region. Our estimates of\nupward energy fluxes are $2.0\\times10^7$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ at the\nphotospheric level and $8.3\\times10^4$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ at the lower\ntransition region level. The difference between the energy fluxes is larger\nthan the energy required to maintain the chromosphere in the sunspot umbrae,\nsuggesting that the observed waves can make a crucial contribution to the\nheating of the chromosphere in the sunspot umbrae. In contrast, the upward\nenergy flux derived at the lower transition region level is smaller than the\nenergy flux required for heating the corona, implying that we may need another\nheating mechanism. We should, however, note a possibility that the energy\ndissipated at the chromosphere might be overestimated because of the opacity\neffect.\n", "  We investigate the effects of dichotomous noise added to a classical harmonic\noscillator in the form of stochastic time-dependent gain and loss states, whose\ndurations are sampled from two distinct exponential waiting time distributions.\nDespite the stochasticity, stability criteria can be formulated when averaging\nover many realizations in the asymptotic time limit and serve to determine the\nboundary line in parameter space that separates regions of growing amplitudes\nfrom those of decaying ones. Furthermore, the concept of $\\mathcal{PT}$\nsymmetry remains applicable for such a stochastic oscillator and we use it to\ndistinguish between an underdamped symmetric phase and an overdamped asymmetric\nphase. In the former case, the limit of stability is marked by the same average\nduration for the gain and loss states, whilst in the the latter case, a higher\nduration of the loss state is necessary to keep the system stable. The\noverdamped phase has an ordered structure imposing a position-velocity ratio\nlocking and is viewed as a phase transition from the underdamped phase, which\ninstead displays a broad and more disordered, but nevertheless, $\\mathcal{PT}$\nsymmetric structure. We also address the short time limit and the dynamics of\nthe moments of the position and the velocity with the aim of revealing the\nextremely rich dynamics offered by this apparently quite simple mechanical\nsystem. The notions established so far may be extended and applied in the\nstabilization of light propagation in metamaterials and optical fibres with\nrandomly distributed regions of asymmetric active and passive media.\n", "  We propose an idea that hidden particles can be separated according to gauge\nquantum numbers from the visible ones by the difference of boundary conditions\non extra dimensions. We formulate 5-dimensional gauge theories yielding\nconjugate boundary conditions besides ordinary ones on $S^1/Z_2$, and examine\nphysical implications concerning hidden particles on an extension of the\nstandard model coexisting different types of boundary conditions. A model with\nconjugate boundary conditions is applied on a gauge-Higgs inflation scenario.\n", "  The problem of thermal ignition in a homogeneous gas is revisited from a\nmolecular dynamics perspective. A two-dimensional model is adopted, which\nassumes reactive disks of type A and B in a fixed area that react to form type\nC products if an activation threshold for impact is surpassed. Such a reaction\nliberates kinetic energy to the product particles, representative of the heat\nrelease. The results for the ignition delay are compared with those obtained\nfrom the continuum description assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium, in\norder to assess the role played by molecular fluctuations. Results show two\nregimes of non-equilibrium ignition whereby ignition occurs at different times\nas compared to that from the continuum description. The first regime is at low\nactivation energies, where the ignition time is found to be higher than that\nexpected from theory for all values of heat release, in agreement with\npredictions from Prigogine and Xhrouet who attribute this departure to\nnon-equilibrium effects. Results suggest the ignition is spatially homogeneous\nin this regime. The second regime occurs at high activation energies and\nsufficiently large heat release values. In this regime, ignition times are\nfound to be dependent on domain size, with larger domains yielding shorter\nignition delays than expected. Results for larger systems agree with the\nexpectations by Prigogine and Mahieu, who predict a non-equilibrium reaction\nrate larger than expected for a homogeneous system in equilibrium. Results\nyield a large variance for ignition times under these conditions, suggesting a\ndeparture from homogeneous combustion. The results obtained are in qualitative\nagreement with experimental observations of auto-ignition at relatively low\ntemperatures, where hot-spot ignition and associated ignition delays lower than\npredicted are generally observed.\n", "  Pulsed field gradient (PFG) has been increasingly employed to study anomalous\ndiffusions in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging\n(MRI). However, the analysis of PFG anomalous diffusion is complicated. In this\npaper, a fractal derivative model based modified Gaussian phase distribution\nmethod is proposed to describe PFG anomalous diffusion. By using the phase\ndistribution obtained from the effective phase shift diffusion method based on\nfractal derivatives, and employing some of the traditional Gaussian phase\ndistribution approximation techniques, a general signal attenuation expression\nfor free fractional diffusion is derived. This expression describes a stretched\nexponential function based attenuation, which is distinct from both the\nexponential attenuation for normal diffusion obtained from conventional\nGaussian phase distribution approximation, and the Mittag-Leffler function\nbased attenuation for anomalous diffusion obtained from fractional derivative.\nThe obtained signal attenuation expression can analyze the finite gradient\npulse width (FGPW) effect. Additionally, it can generally be applied to all\nthree types of PFG fractional diffusions classified based on time derivative\norder alpha and space derivative order beta. These three types of fractional\ndiffusions include time-fractional diffusion, space-fractional diffusion, and\ngeneral fractional diffusion. The results in this paper are consistent with\nreported results based on effective phase shift diffusion equation method and\ninstantaneous signal attenuation method. This method provides a new, convenient\napproximation formalism for analyzing PFG anomalous diffusion experiments.\n", "  In this paper the analogy between a thermal engine and a waterwheel is\ndeveloped in details, showing that the analogous of the flow of water in an\nhydraulic engine is the flow of entropy in a thermal one. This analogy mat\nserve to analyse in details the aspects of a thermal engine that are quite\ndistant from pupils' intuition. The discussion is complemented by an\nillustration of the working of thermal and hydraulic engines at the microscopic\nlevel, thus furnishing a view of what heat and work are at this level, and\nintroducing the statistical and information aspects of entropy. Both hydraulic\nand thermal non-ideal engines are also discussed.\n", "  When matter fields are included in chiral perturbation theory, the\nnonvanishing mass in the chiral limit introduces a new energy scale so that the\nloop diagrams including such matter field propagators spoil the usual power\ncounting. However, the power counting breaking terms can be absorbed into\ncounterterms in the chiral Lagrangian. In this paper, we systematically derive\nthese terms to leading one-loop order (next-to-next-to leading order in the\nchiral expansion) at once by calculating the generating functional using the\npath integral. They are then absorbed by counterterms in the next-to-leading\norder Lagrangian. The method can be extended to calculating power counting\nbreaking terms for other matter fields.\n", "  A hexagonal structure of solid molecular hydrogen with $P6_122$ symmetry is\ncalculated to be more stable below about 200 GPa than the monoclinic $C2/c$\nstructure identified previously as the best candidate for phase III. We find\nthat the effects of nuclear quantum and thermal vibrations play a central role\nin the stabilization of $P6_122$. The $P6_122$ and $C2/c$ structures are very\nsimilar and their Raman and infra-red data are in good agreement with\nexperiment. However, our calculations show that the hexagonal $P6_122$\nstructure provides better agreement with the available x-ray diffraction data\nthan the $C2/c$ structure at pressures below about 200 GPa. We suggest that two\nphase-III-like structures may be formed at high pressures, hexagonal $P6_122$\nbelow about 200 GPa and monoclinic $C2/c$ at higher pressures.\n", "  Cs$_2$LiLaBr$_6$:Ce$^{3+}$ (CLLB) is an elpasolite scintillator that offers\nexcellent linearity and gamma-ray energy resolution and sensitivity to thermal\nneutrons with the ability to perform pulse-shape discrimination (PSD) to\ndistinguish gammas and neutrons. Our investigation of CLLB has indicated the\npresence of intrinsic radioactive alpha background that we have determined to\nbe from actinium contamination of the lanthanum component. We measured the\npulse shapes for gamma, thermal neutron, and alpha events and determined that\nPSD can be performed to separate the alpha background with a moderate figure of\nmerit of 0.98. We also measured the electron-equivalent-energy of the alpha\nparticles in CLLB and simulated the intrinsic alpha background from $^{227}$Ac\nto determine the quenching factor of the alphas. A linear quenching\nrelationship $L_{\\alpha} = E_{\\alpha} \\times q + L_0$ was found at alpha\nparticle energies above 5 MeV, with a quenching factor $q = 0.71$ MeVee/MeV and\nan offset $L_0 = - 1.19$ MeVee.\n", "  We investigate observational properties of accretion-induced collapse (AIC)\nof white dwarfs in radio frequencies. If AIC is triggered by accretion from a\ncompanion star, a dense circumstellar medium can be formed around the\nprogenitor system. Then, the ejecta from AIC collide to the dense circumstellar\nmedium, making a strong shock. The strong shock can produce synchrotron\nemission which can be observed in radio frequencies. Even if AIC occurs as a\nresult of white dwarf mergers, we argue that AIC may cause fast radio bursts if\na certain condition is satisfied. If AIC forms neutron stars which are so\nmassive that rotation is required to support themselves (i.e., supramassive\nneutron stars), the supramassive neutron stars may immediately lose their\nrotational energy by the r-mode instability and collapse to black holes. If the\ncollapsing supramassive neutron stars are strongly magnetized, they may emit\nfast radio bursts as previously suggested. The AIC radio transients from the\nsingle-degenerate systems may be detected in the future radio transient surveys\nlike Very Large Array Sky Survey or the Square Kilometer Array transient\nsurvey. Because AIC is suggested to be a gravitational wave source,\ngravitational waves from AIC may be accompanied by radio-bright transients\nwhich can be used to confirm the AIC origin of observed gravitational waves.\n", "  Studying thermal transport at the nanoscale poses formidable experimental\nchallenges due both to the physics of the measurement process and to the issues\nof accuracy and reproducibility. The laser-induced transient thermal grating\n(TTG) technique permits non-contact measurements on nanostructured samples\nwithout a need for metal heaters or any other extraneous structures, offering\nthe advantage of inherently high absolute accuracy. We present a review of\nrecent studies of thermal transport in nanoscale silicon membranes using the\nTTG technique. An overview of the methodology, including an analysis of\nmeasurements errors, is followed by a discussion of new findings obtained from\nmeasurements on both solid and nanopatterned membranes. The most important\nresults have been a direct observation of non-diffusive phonon-mediated\ntransport at room temperature and measurements of thickness-dependent thermal\nconductivity of suspended membranes across a wide thickness range, showing good\nagreement with first-principles-based theory assuming diffuse scattering at the\nboundaries. Measurements on a membrane with a periodic pattern of nanosized\nholes indicated fully diffusive transport and yielded thermal diffusivity\nvalues in agreement with Monte Carlo simulations. Based on the results obtained\nto-date, we conclude that room-temperature thermal transport in membranebased\nsilicon nanostructures is now reasonably well understood.\n", "  Force fields developed with machine learning methods in tandem with quantum\nmechanics are beginning to find merit, given their (i) low cost, (ii) accuracy,\nand (iii) versatility. Recently, we proposed one such approach, wherein, the\nvectorial force on an atom is computed directly from its environment. Here, we\ndiscuss the multi-step workflow required for their construction, which begins\nwith generating diverse reference atomic environments and force data, choosing\na numerical representation for the atomic environments, down selecting a\nrepresentative training set, and lastly the learning method itself, for the\ncase of Al. The constructed force field is then validated by simulating complex\nmaterials phenomena such as surface melting and stress-strain behavior - that\ntruly go beyond the realm of $ab\\ initio$ methods both in length and time\nscales. To make such force fields truly versatile an attempt to estimate the\nuncertainty in force predictions is put forth, allowing one to identify areas\nof poor performance and paving the way for their continual improvement.\n", "  Social interaction dynamics are a special type of group interactions that\nplay a large part in our everyday lives. They dictate how and with whom a\ncertain individual will interact. One of such interactions can be termed\n\"avoidance control\". This everyday situation occurs when two fast-walking\npersons suddenly realize that they are on a frontal collision course and begin\nmaneuvering to avoid collision. If the two walkers' initial maneuverings are in\nthe same direction that can lead to oscillations that lengthen time required to\nreach a stable avoidance trajectory. We introduce a dynamical model with a\nfeedback loop to understand the origin and properties of this oscillation. For\nthe emergence of the oscillatory behavior, two conditions must be satisfied: i)\nthe persons must initiate the avoidance maneuver in the same direction; ii) the\ntime delays in the feedback loop must reverse the phase of the players'\npositions at the oscillation frequency. The oscillation can be terminated at\nany time if one of the walkers decides to stop and/or to communicate. By taking\nover the control of the situation the walker cuts the feedback loop. Similar\noscillatory situations may potentially cause major collisions between\nautonomous vehicles and airplanes with airborne communications, but in\nautopilot mode.\n", "  In this work, a two-dimensional mathematical model is developed to study the\nflow patterns and volumetric flow penetrations in the flow channel over the\nporous electrode layered system in vanadium flow battery with serpentine flow\nfield design. The flow distributions at the interface between the flow channel\nand porous electrode are examined. It is found that the non-linear pressure\ndistributions can distinguish the interface flow distributions under the ideal\nplug flow and ideal parabolic flow inlet boundary conditions. However, the\nvolumetric flow penetration within the porous electrode beneath the flow\nchannel through the integration of interface flow velocity reveals that this\nvalue is identical under both ideal plug flow and ideal parabolic flow inlet\nboundary conditions. The volumetric flow penetrations under the advection\neffects of flow channel and landing/rib are estimated. The maximum current\ndensity achieved in the flow battery can be predicted based on the 100% amount\nof electrolyte flow reactant consumption through the porous electrode beneath\nboth flow channel and landing channel. The corresponding theoretical maximum\ncurrent densities achieved in vanadium flow battery with one and three layers\nof SGL 10AA carbon paper electrode have reasonable agreement with experimental\nresults under a proper permeability.\n", "  This work concerns the semiclassical asymptotics of quantum weighted double\nHurwitz numbers. We compute the leading term of the partition function for\nthree versions of the quantum weighted Hurwitz numbers, as well as lower order\nsemiclassical corrections. The classical limit $\\hbar \\to 0$ is shown to\nreproduce the simple Hurwitz numbers studied by Pandharipande and Okounkov. The\nKP-Toda $\\tau$-function serving as generating function for the quantum Hurwitz\nnumbers is shown to converge in the classical limit to the generating function\nof Pandharipande and Okounkov and, with suitable scaling, so do the partition\nfunction, the weights and expectations of Hurwitz numbers.\n", "  The defining characteristic of Z Cam stars are standstills in their light\ncurves. Some Z Cams exhibit atypical behaviour by going into outburst from a\nstandstill. It has previously been suggested that UY Pup had been a Z Cam star,\nbut it was ruled out due to its long-term light curve. However, in December\n2015 UY Pup went into outburst and unexpectedly entered into a short standstill\ninstead of returning to quiescence. Furthermore, UY Pup exhibited additional\nunusual behaviour with two outbursts detected during its standstill. After this\nstandstill UY Pup made a brief excursion to a quiescence state and slowly rose\nto a longer and well-defined standstill, where it again went into another\noutburst. Through comparative analysis, research, and observational data of UY\nPup it is evident and thus concluded that it is indeed a Z Cam star, in which\nrenders it to be one of only four known anomalous Z Cam stars.\n", "  Given a MAX-2-SAT instance, we define a local maximum to be an assignment\nsuch that changing any single variable reduces the number of satisfied clauses.\nWe consider the question of the number of local maxima that an instance of\nMAX-2-SAT can have. We give upper bounds in both the sparse and nonsparse case,\nwhere the sparse case means that there is a bound $d$ on the average number of\nclauses involving any given variable. The bounds in the nonsparse case are\ntight up to polylogarithmic factors, while in the sparse case the bounds are\ntight up to a multiplicative factor in $d$ for large $d$. Additionally, we\ngeneralize to the question of assignments which are maxima up to changing $k>\n1$ variables simultaneously; in this case, we give explicit constructions with\nlarge (in a sense explained below) numbers of such maxima in the sparse case.\nThe basic idea of the upper bound proof is to consider a random assignment to\nsome subset of the variables and determine the probability that some fraction\nof the remaining variables can be fixed without considering interactions\nbetween them. The bounded results hold in the case of weighted MAX-2-SAT as\nwell. Using this technique and combining with ideas from Ref. 6, we find an\nalgorithm for weighted MAX-2-SAT which is faster for large $d$ than previous\nalgorithms which use polynomial space; this algorithm does require an\nadditional bounds on maximum weights and degree.\n", "  We present a rest-frame composite spectrum for Seyfert 1 galaxies using\nspectra obtained from the DR12 release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).\nThe spectrum is constructed by combining data from a total of 10,112 galaxies,\nspanning a redshift range of 0 to 0.793. We produce an electronic table of the\nmedian and geometric mean composite Seyfert 1 spectrum. We measure the spectral\nindex of the composite spectrum, and compare it with that of the composite\nquasar spectrum. We also measure the flux and width of the strong emission\nlines present in the composite spectrum. We compare the entire spectrum with\nthe quasar spectrum in the context of the AGN unification model. The two\ncomposite spectra match extremely well in the blue part of the spectrum, while\nthere is an offset in flux in the red portion of the spectrum.\n", "  We identify all fast-mode forward shocks, whose sheath regions resulted in a\nmoderate (56 cases) or intense (38 cases) geomagnetic storm during 18.5 years\nfrom January 1997 to June 2015. We study their main properties, interplanetary\ncauses and geo-effects. We find that half (49/94) such shocks are associated\nwith interacting coronal mass ejections (CMEs), as they are either shocks\npropagating into a preceding CME (35 cases) or a shock propagating into the\nsheath region of a preceding shock (14 cases). About half (22/45) of the shocks\ndriven by isolated transients and which have geo-effective sheaths compress\npre-existing southward Bz. Most of the remaining sheaths appear to have planar\nstructures with southward magnetic fields, including some with planar\nstructures consistent with field line draping ahead of the magnetic ejecta. A\ntypical (median) geo-effective shock-sheath structure drives a geomagnetic\nstorm with peak Dst of -88 nT, pushes the subsolar magnetopause location to 6.3\nRe, i.e. below geosynchronous orbit and is associated with substorms with a\npeak AL-index of -1350 nT. There are some important differences between sheaths\nassociated with CME-CME interaction (stronger storms) and those associated with\nisolated CMEs (stronger compression of the magnetosphere). We detail six case\nstudies of different types of geo-effective shock-sheaths, as well as two\nevents for which there was no geomagnetic storm but other magnetospheric\neffects. Finally, we discuss our results in terms of space weather forecasting,\nand potential effects on Earth's radiation belts.\n", "  We study the role of time dependent magnetic ellipticities ($\\epsilon_{B}$)\non the calculation of the braking index of pulsars. Moreover, we study the\nconsequences of such a $\\epsilon_{B}$ on the amplitude of gravitational waves\n(GWs) generated by pulsars with measured braking indices. We show that, since\nthe ellipticity generated by the magnetic dipole is extremely small, the\ncorresponding amplitude of GWs is much smaller than the amplitude obtained via\nthe spindown limit.\n", "  Ultrahigh energy cosmic ray air showers probe particle physics at energies\nbeyond the reach of accelerators. Here we introduce a new method to test\nhadronic interaction models without relying on the absolute energy calibration,\nand apply it to events with primary energy 6-16 EeV (E_CM = 110-170 TeV), whose\nlongitudinal development and lateral distribution were simultaneously measured\nby the Pierre Auger Observatory. The average hadronic shower is 1.33 +- 0.16\n(1.61 +- 0.21) times larger than predicted using the leading LHC-tuned models\nEPOS-LHC (QGSJetII-04), with a corresponding excess of muons.\n", "  We report a measurement of the exclusive production of pairs of charged pions\nin proton-proton collisions, dominated by the process $pp \\rightarrow p^{(*)}\n\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-} p^{(*)}$, where $\\rm p^{(*)}$ stands for a diffractively\ndissociated proton, the $\\pi^{+} \\pi^{-}$ pair is emitted at central rapidities\n$y$, and the incident protons stay intact or dissociate without detection ${\\rm\np^{(*)}}$. The measurement is performed with the CMS detector at the LHC, using\na data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 450~$\\mu$b$^{-1}$\ncollected at a center-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV in 2010. The cross\nsection measured in the phase space defined by pion transverse momentum $p_{\\rm\nT}>0.2$~GeV/c and rapidity $|y|< 2 $ is found to be $20.5~\\pm~0.3~(\\rm\n{stat})~(\\pm~3.1~\\rm {syst})~\\pm$~0.8~(lumi)~$\\mu$b. The differential cross\nsections for $\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}$ pairs as a function of the pion pair invariant\nmass, $p_{\\rm T}$, and $y$, as well as a single-pion differential cross section\nas a function of pion $p_{\\rm T}$ are also measured and compared to several\nphenomenological predictions.\n", "  A well-instrumented Green Bank Telescope (GBT) operating at high frequency\nrepresents a unique scientific resource for the US community. As a\nfilled-aperture, 100m-diameter telescope, the GBT is ideally suited to fast\nmapping of extended, low surface brightness emission with excellent\ninstantaneous frequency coverage. This capability makes the GBT a key facility\nfor a range of cutting edge science described in this document, only possible\nat these frequencies. We note that the ability to perform the necessary\nobservations is unique and highly complementary to the capabilities offered by\ninterferometers, and should be preserved. We argue that rather than divesting\nfrom this exceptional resource, it makes sense for the US community to invest\nmoderately to maintain GBT operations and to instrument it in an optimal\nmanner, enabling it to become an extraordinary complement to existing and\nfuture radio interferometers. Adequately instrumented, the GBT would be a\npillar for 20-115 GHz science in the US and the world.\n", "  A class of long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with a plateau phase in their X-ray\nafterglows obeys a three-dimensional (3D) relation (Dainotti et al. 2016),\nbetween the rest-frame time at the end of the plateau, Ta, its corresponding\nX-ray luminosity, La, and the peak luminosity in the prompt emission, Lpeak. We\nextended the original analysis with X-ray data from July 2014 to July 2016\nachieving a total sample of 183 Swift GRBs with afterglow plateaus and known\nredshifts. We added the most recent GRBs to the previous 'gold sample' (now\nincluding 45 GRBs) and obtained a relation plane with intrinsic scatter\ncompatible within one sigma with the previous result. We compared several GRB\ncategories, such as short with extended emission, X-ray Flashes, GRBs\nassociated with SNe, long-duration GRBs, and the gold sample, composed only by\nGRBs with light curves with good data coverage and relatively flat plateaus and\nevaluated their relation planes. We found that they are not statistically\ndifferent from the fundamental plane derived from the gold sample and that the\nfundamental plane still has the smallest scatter. We compared the jet opening\nangles tabulated in literature with the angles derived using the Eiso-Egamma\nrelation of the method in Pescalli et al. (2015) and calculated the relation\nplane for a sample of long GRBs accounting for the different jet opening\nangles. We observed that this correction does not significantly reduce the\nscatter. In an extended analysis, we found that the fundamental plane is\nindependent from several prompt and afterglow parameters.\n", "  We have conducted laboratory experiments to model important aspects of plumes\nin mantle convection. We focus on the role of the viscosity ratio U (between\nthe ambient fluid and the plume fluid) in determining the plume structure and\ndynamics. In our experiments, we are able to capture geophysical convection\nregimes relevant to mantle convection both for hot spots (when U > 1) and\nplate-subduction (when U < 1) regimes. The planar laser induced fluorescence\n(PLIF) technique is used for flow visualization and characterizing the plume\nstructures. The convection is driven by compositional buoyancy generated by the\nperfusion of lighter fluid across a permeable mesh and the viscosity ratio U is\nsystematically varied over a range from 1/300 to 2500. The planform, near the\nbottom boundary for U=1, exhibits a well-known dendritic line plume structure.\nAs the value of U is increased, a progressive morphological transition is\nobserved from the dendritic-plume structure to discrete spherical plumes,\naccompanied with thickening of the plumes and an increase in the plume spacing.\nIn the vertical section, mushroom-shaped plume heads at U=1 change into\nintermittent spherical-blob shaped plumes at high U, resembling mantle plume\nhot spots in mantle convection. In contrast, for low values of U (~1/300), the\nregime corresponds to subduction of plates in the mantle. In this regime, we\nobserve for the first time that plumes arise from a thick boundary with\ncellular structure and develop into sheet-plumes. We use experimental data to\nquantify these morphological changes and mixing dynamics of the plumes at\ndifferent regimes of U. We also compare our observations on plume spacing with\nvarious models reported in the literature by varying the viscosity ratio and\nthe buoyancy flux.\n", "  An important constraint for galaxy evolution models is how much gas resides\nin galaxies, in particular at the peak of star formation z=1-3. We attempt a\nnovel approach by letting long-duration Gamma Ray Bursts (LGRBs) x-ray their\nhost galaxies and deliver column densities to us. This requires a good\nunderstanding of the obscurer and biases introduced by incomplete follow-up\nobservations. We analyse the X-ray afterglow of all 844 Swift LGRBs to date for\ntheir column density $N_H$. To derive the population properties we propagate\nall uncertainties in a consistent Bayesian methodology. The $N_H$ distribution\ncovers the $10^{20-23}\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ range and shows no evolutionary effect.\nHigher obscurations, e.g. Compton-thick columns, could have been detected but\nare not observed. The $N_H$ distribution is consistent with sources randomly\npopulating a ellipsoidal gas cloud of major axis\n$N_H^\\text{major}=10^{23}\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ with 0.22 dex intrinsic scatter\nbetween objects. The unbiased SHOALS survey of afterglows and hosts allows us\nto constrain the relation between Spitzer-derived stellar masses and X-ray\nderived column densities $N_H$. We find a well-constrained powerlaw relation of\n$N_H=10^{21.7}\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\times\\left(M_{\\star}/10^{9.5}M_{\\odot}\\right)^{1/3}$,\nwith 0.5 dex intrinsic scatter between objects. The Milky Way and the\nMagellanic clouds also follow this relation. From the geometry of the obscurer,\nits stellar mass dependence and comparison with local galaxies we conclude that\nLGRBs are primarily obscured by galaxy-scale gas. Ray tracing of simulated\nIllustris galaxies reveals a relation of the same normalisation, but a steeper\nstellar-mass dependence and mild redshift evolution. Our new approach provides\nvaluable insight into the gas residing in high-redshift galaxies.\n", "  We propose a strategy for searching for theoretically-unanticipated new\nphysics which avoids a large trials factor by focusing on experimental\nstrengths. Searches for resonances decaying into pairs of visible particles are\nexperimentally very powerful due to the localized mass peaks and have a rich\nhistory of discovery. Yet, due to a focus on subsets of theoretically-motivated\nmodels, the landscape of such resonances is far from thoroughly explored. We\nsurvey the existing set of searches, identify untapped experimental\nopportunities and discuss the theoretical constraints on models which would\ngenerate such resonances.\n", "  We have investigated the quantum dynamics of two ultracold bosons inside an\natomic waveguide for two different confinement geometries (cigar-shaped and\ntoroidal waveguides) by quantum Monte Carlo methods. For quasi-1D gases, the\nconfining potential of the waveguide leads to the so-called confinement induced\nresonance (CIR), results in the phase transition of the gas to the impenetrable\nbosonic regime (known as TG gas). In this regime the bosons repel each other\nstrongly and behave like fermions. We reproduce CIR for a cigar-shaped\nwaveguide and analyze the behavior of the system for different conditions.\nMoreover, our analysis demonstrates appearance of CIR for a toroidal waveguide.\nParticularly, we show that the resonance position is dependent on the size of\nthe waveguide, which is in contrast to the cigar shaped waveguides for which it\nis universal.\n", "  Barnum, Crepeau, Gottesman, Tapp, and Smith (quant-ph/0205128) proposed\nmethods for authentication of quantum messages. The first method is an\ninteractive protocol (TQA') based on teleportation. The second method is a\nnoninteractive protocol (QA) in which the sender first encrypts the message\nusing a protocol QEnc and then encodes the quantum ciphertext with an error\ncorrecting code chosen secretly from a set (a purity test code (PTC)).\nEncryption was shown to be necessary for authentication.\n  We augment the protocol QA with an extra step which recycles the entire\nencryption key provided QA accepts the message. We analyze the resulting\nintegrated protocol for quantum authentication and key generation, which we\ncall QA+KG. Our main result is a proof that QA+KG is universal composably (UC)\nsecure in the Ben-Or-Mayers model (quant-ph/0409062). More specifically, this\nimplies the UC-security of (a) QA, (b) recycling of the encryption key in QA,\nand (c) key-recycling of the encryption scheme QEnc by appending PTC. For an\nm-qubit message, encryption requires 2m bits of key; but PTC can be performed\nusing only O(log m) + O(log e) bits of key for probability of failure e. Thus,\nwe reduce the key required for both QA and QEnc, from linear to logarithmic net\nconsumption, at the expense of one bit of back communication which can happen\nany time after the conclusion of QA and before reusing the key. UC-security of\nQA also extends security to settings not obvious from quant-ph/0205128.\n  Our security proof structure is inspired by and similar to that of\nquant-ph/0205128, reducing the security of QA to that of TQA'. In the process,\nwe define UC-secure entanglement, and prove the UC-security of the entanglement\ngenerating protocol given in quant-ph/0205128, which could be of independent\ninterest.\n", "  The trapped rainbow effect has been mostly found on tapered anisotropic\nmetamaterials (MMs) made of low loss noble metals, such as gold, silver, etc.\nIn this work, we demonstrate that an anisotropic MM waveguide made of high loss\nmetal tungsten can also support the trapped rainbow effect similar to the noble\nmetal based structure. We show theoretically that an array of\ntungsten/germanium anisotropic nano-cones placed on top of a reflective\nsubstrate can absorb light at the wavelength range from 0.3 micrometer to 9\nmicrometer with an average absorption efficiency approaching 98%. It is found\nthat the excitation of multiple orders of slow-light resonant modes is\nresponsible for the efficient absorption at wavelengths longer than 2\nmicrometer, and the anti-reflection effect of tapered lossy material gives rise\nto the near perfect absorption at shorter wavelengths. The absorption spectrum\nsuffers a small dip at around 4.2 micrometer where the first order and second\norder slow-light modes get overlapped, but we can get rid of this dip if the\nabsorption band edge at long wavelength range is reduced down to 5 micrometer.\nThe parametrical study reflects that the absorption bandwidth is mainly\ndetermined by the filling ratio of tungsten as well as the bottom diameter of\nthe nano-cones and the interaction between neighboring nano-cones is quite\nweak. Our proposal has some potential applications in the areas of solar energy\nharvesting and thermal emitters.\n", "  The discovery of binary and triple asteroids in addition to the execution of\nspace missions to minor celestial bodies in the past several years have focused\nincreasing attention on periodic orbits around irregular-shaped celestial\nbodies. In the present work, we adopt a polyhedron shape model for providing an\naccurate representation of irregular-shaped bodies, and employ the model to\ncalculate their corresponding gravitational and effective potentials. We also\ninvestigate the characteristics of periodic orbit families and the continuation\nof periodic orbits. We prove a fact, which provides a conserved quantity that\npermits restricting the number of periodic orbits in a fixed energy curved\nsurface about an irregular-shaped body. The collisions of Floquet multipliers\nare maintained during the continuation of periodic orbits around the comet\n1P/Halley. Multiple bifurcations in the periodic orbit families about\nirregular-shaped bodies are also discussed. Three bifurcations in the periodic\norbit family have been found around the asteroid 216 Kleopatra, which include\ntwo real saddle bifurcations and one period-doubling bifurcation.\n", "  It is usually assumed that hydraulic fracture has two symmetrical wings with\nrespect to the fluid injection point. Hence, authors limit themselves to\nmodelling of one half of the fracture. In our work we demonstrate that the case\nof a symmetrical fracture occurs only in a homogeneous reservoir with constant\nphysical parameters and confining {\\it in situ} stress. Otherwise,\ninhomogeneity in the stress or the rock permeability can significantly change\nthe dynamics of the fracture propagation. The mathematical model of the\nhydraulic fracturing used in the paper is adopted from our earlier work\n\\cite{Golovin_Baykin_2016_Pore}. In present paper we perform numerical\nexperiments demonstrating that in case of non-constant confining stress or\nreservoir permeability the fracture is developing non-symmetrically. An\nimportant role is played by the action of the backstress that is formed near\nthe fracture due to the pore pressure. To support this observation we give a\nformal definition of the backstress and compare the values of the backstress\nacting on the two different fracture wings. These numerical experiments\nunderline the importance of the proper modelling of the interaction between\npore and fracturing fluids for the correct simulation of the hydraulic\nfracturing.\n", "  We analyze the shadow of charged stationary axially symmetric space-time\n(Kerr-Sen dilaton-axion black hole). This black hole is defined by a mass $M$,\na spin $a$ and $r_{\\alpha}=Q^{2}/M$, where $Q$ is the electric charge. Shadows\nare investigated in two conditions, i) for an observer at infinity in vacuum\nand ii) for an observer at infinity in the presence of plasma with radial\npower-low density. In vacuum, the shadow of this black hole depends on charge\nand spin parameter. We can see that, increasing electric charge, $Q$ decreases\nthe size of shadow. Also, increasing spin parameter $a$ decreases the size of\nshadow. However, in existence of plasma, parameter of plasma like refraction\nindex, $n$, playing an important role on shadows. In fact, decreasing\nrefraction index decreases the size of shadow.\n", "  We consider a population of interconnected individuals that, with respect to\na piece of information, at each time instant can be subdivided into three\n(time-dependent) categories: agnostics, influenced, and evangelists. A\ndynamical process of information diffusion evolves among the individuals of the\npopulation according to the following rules. Initially, all individuals are\nagnostic. Then, a set of people is chosen from the outside and convinced to\nstart evangelizing, i.e., to start spreading the information. When a number of\nevangelists, greater than a given threshold, communicate with a node v, the\nnode v becomes influenced, whereas, as soon as the individual v is contacted by\na sufficiently much larger number of evangelists, it is itself converted into\nan evangelist and consequently it starts spreading the information. The\nquestion is: How to choose a bounded cardinality initial set of evangelists so\nas to maximize the final number of influenced individuals? We prove that the\nproblem is hard to solve, even in an approximate sense. On the positive side,\nwe present exact polynomial time algorithms for trees and complete graphs. For\ngeneral graphs, we derive exact parameterized algorithms. We also investigate\nthe problem when the objective is to select a minimum number of evangelists\ncapable of influencing the whole network. Our motivations to study these\nproblems come from the areas of Viral Marketing and the analysis of\nquantitative models of spreading of influence in social networks.\n", "  We consider the heat flow of corotational harmonic maps from $\\mathbb R^3$ to\nthe three-sphere and prove the nonlinear asymptotic stability of a particular\nself-similar shrinker that is not known in closed form. Our method provides a\nnovel, systematic, robust, and constructive approach to the stability analysis\nof self-similar blowup in parabolic evolution equations. In particular, we\ncompletely avoid using delicate Lyapunov functionals, monotonicity formulas,\nindirect arguments, or fragile parabolic structure like the maximum principle.\nAs a matter of fact, our approach reduces the nonlinear stability analysis of\nself-similar shrinkers to the spectral analysis of the associated self-adjoint\nlinearized operators.\n", "  The effect of an Aharonov-Bohm (AB) pseudo magnetic field on a two\ndimensional electron gas in graphene is investigated. We consider it modeled as\nin the usual AB effect but since such pseudo field is supposed to be induced by\nelastic deformations, the quantization of the field flux is abandoned. For\ncertain constraints on the orbital angular momentum eigenvalues allowed for the\nsystem, we can observe the zero Landau level failing to develop, due to the\ndegeneracy related to the Dirac valleys $K$ and $K^\\prime$ which is broken. For\ninteger values of the pseudo AB flux, the actual quantum Hall effect is\npreserved. Obtaining the Hall conductivity by summing over all orbital angular\nmomentum eigenvalues, the zero Landau levels is recovered. Since our problem is\nclosed related to the case where topological defects on a graphene sheet are\npresent, the questions posed here are helpful if one is interested to probe the\neffects of a singular curvature in these systems.\n", "  The Poincare and Poincare-Weyl gauge theories of gravitation with Lagrangians\nquadratic on curvature and torsion in post-Riemannian spaces with the Dirac\nscalar field is discussed in a historical aspect. The various hypothesizes\nconcerning the models of a dark matter with the help of a scalar field are\nconsidered. The new conformal Weyl-Dirac theory of gravitation is proposed,\nwhich is a gravitational theory in Cartan-Weyl space-time with the Dirac scalar\nfield representing the dark matter model. A static spherically symmetric\nsolution of the field equations in vacuum for a central compact mass is\nobtained as the metrics conformal to the Yilmaz-Rosen metrics. On the base of\nthis solution one considers a radial movement of an interplanetary spacecraft\nstarting from the Earth. Using the Newton approximation one obtains that the\nasymptotic line-of-sight velocity in this case depends from the parameters of\nthe solution, and therefore one can obtain on basis of the observable data the\nvalues of these parameters.\n", "  Vibrational-excitation cross sections of ground electronic state of carbon\ndioxide molecule by electron-impact through the CO2-(2\\Pi) shape resonance is\nconsidered in the separation of the normal modes approximation. Resonance\ncurves and widths are computed for each vibrational mode. The calculations\nassume decoupling between normal modes and employ the local complex potential\nmodel for the treatment of the nuclear dynamics, usually adopted for the\nelectron-scattering involving diatomic molecules. Results are presented for\nexcitation up to 10 vibrational levels in each mode and comparison with data\npresent in the literature is discussed.\n", "  We explain how to incorporate the action of local integrals of motion into\nthe fermionic basis for the sine-Gordon model and its UV CFT. The examples up\nto the level 4 are presented. Numerical computation support the results.\nPossible applications are discussed.\n", "  We predict that electrons in an ion channel can gain ultra-relativistic\nenergies by simultaneously interacting with a laser pulse and,\ncounter-intuitively, with a decelerating electric field. The crucial role of\nthe decelerating field is to maintain high-amplitude betatron oscillations,\nthereby enabling constant rate energy flow to the electrons via the direct\nlaser acceleration mechanism. Multiple harmonics of the betatron motion can be\nemployed. Injecting electrons into a decelerating phase of a laser wakefield\naccelerator is one practical implementation of the scheme.\n", "  We utilize a homodyne detection technique to achieve a new sensitivity limit\nfor atom-based, absolute radio-frequency electric field sensing of $\\mathrm{5\n\\mu V cm^{-1} Hz^{-1/2} }$. A Mach-Zehnder interferometer is used for the\nhomodyne detection. With the increased sensitivity, we investigate the dominant\ndephasing mechanisms that affect the performance of the sensor. In particular,\nwe present data on power broadening, collisional broadening and transit time\nbroadening. Our results are compared to density matrix calculations. We show\nthat photon shot noise in the signal readout is currently a limiting factor. We\nsuggest that new approaches with superior readout with respect to photon shot\nnoise are needed to increase the sensitivity further.\n", "  The aim of this work is to examine the exponential rates at which\nentanglement distillation occur in three-qubits systems. The approach we will\nfollow to elucidate the entanglement concentration is based on the Schur-Weyl\ndecomposition and the Keyl-Werner theorem. In order to clearly state the main\nresults of this work we will have to introduce the notion of SLOCC equivalence\nand the covariant algebra which will allow us to classify states in different\n\\emph{entanglement classes}. Our main results comprehend the asymptotic rates\nfor the probability of being in an invariant subspace in the Wedderburn\ndecomposition of the state with effective Kronecker coefficient\n$g_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma}=1$. We will also present a combinatorial formula for the\neffective Kronecker coefficient for two-row Young diagrams. With this work we\nhope to shed some light in the way a multipartite system is entangled and at\nwhich rate can we convey entanglement for further applications.\n", "  Low-loss optical isolators and circulators are critical nonreciprocal\ncomponents for signal routing and protection, but their chip-scale integration\nis not yet practical using standard photonics foundry processes. The\nsignificant challenges that confront integration of magneto-optic nonreciprocal\nsystems on chip have made imperative the exploration of magnet free\nalternatives. However, none of these approaches have yet demonstrated linear\noptical isolation with ideal characteristics over a microscale footprint -\nsimultaneously incorporating large contrast with ultralow forward loss - having\nfundamental compatibility with photonic integration in standard waveguide\nmaterials. Here we demonstrate that complete linear optical isolation can be\nobtained within any dielectric waveguide using only a whispering-gallery\nmicroresonator pumped by a single-frequency laser. The isolation originates\nfrom a nonreciprocal induced transparency based on a coherent light-sound\ninteraction, with the coupling originating from the traveling-wave Brillouin\nscattering interaction, that breaks time-reversal symmetry within the\nwaveguide-resonator system. Our result demonstrates that material-agnostic and\nwavelength-agnostic optical isolation is far more accessible for chip-scale\nphotonics than previously thought.\n", "  Mechanism of nuclear reactions on 197Au induced by 11B ions at energies above\nCoulomb barrier was studied by induced-activity method and gamma-spectroscopy.\nThe cross sections of the reaction fragments from 197Au induced by 11B ions\nwere measured at bombarding energies 137.5 and 255.5 MeV. The fission process\nwas investigated by using multimodal fission approach at the energy 137.5 MeV,\nand pure symmetric distribution at 255.5 MeV. It was observed that the\ntransferred linear momentum provides the information on the initial\nprojectile-target information. The fissility for both fission reactions under\nstudy was deduced from measured fission cross section using the total inelastic\ncross section. Comparison with proton-induced fission shown, that the linear\nmomentum transferred to the fissile system depends on the probe.\n", "  The third-order optical nonlinearity in optical waveguides has found\napplications in optical switching, optical wavelength conversion, optical\nfrequency comb generation, and ultrafast optical signal processing. The\ndevelopment of an integrated waveguide platform with a high nonlinearity is\ntherefore important for nonlinear integrated photonics. Here, we report the\nobservation of an enhancement in the nonlinearity of an air-cladding silicon\npedestal waveguide. We observe enhanced nonlinear spectral broadening compared\nto a conventional silicon-on-insulator waveguide. At the center wavelength of\n1555 nm, the nonlinear-index coefficient of air-cladding silicon pedestal\nwaveguide is measured to be about 5% larger than that of a conventional\nsilicon-on-insulator waveguide. We observe enhanced spectral broadening from\nself-phase modulation of an optical pulse in the pedestal waveguide. The\ninteraction of light with the confined acoustic phonons in the pedestal\nstructure gives rise to a larger nonlinear-index coefficient. The experimental\nresults agree well with the theoretical models.\n", "  Sr2IrO4 exhibits a novel insulating state assisted by spin-orbit\ninteractions. A series of polycrystalline samples of Sr2-xIrO4 have been\nsynthesized. It is found that deep Sr-vacancies of Sr2-xIrO4 greatly reduce the\nrotation of IrO6 octahedral, and more importantly, a significant structural\nchange occurs around x = 0.48 in both the lattice constants and the Ir-O2 bond\nlength. An insulator-metal transition (IMT) appears and a non-Fermi-liquid\nmetallic electronic state has been proved at x>0.48 in Sr2-xIrO4. Furthermore,\na sudden drop emerges of the localization temperature T0 and the\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) transition temperature TN in Sr1.5IrO4, together with\nthe Curie-Weiss temperature reversing its sign. These abrupt changes are\nclosely related with the reduction of the rotation crystal structure.\n", "  The radiance of thermal emission, as described by Plancks law, depends only\non the emissivity and temperature of a body, and increases monotonically with\ntemperature rise at any emitted wavelength. Nonthermal radiation, such as\nphotoluminescence (PL), is a fundamental light matter interaction that\nconventionally involves the absorption of an energetic photon, thermalization,\nand the emission of a redshifted photon. Until recently, the role of rate\nconservation when thermal excitation is significant, has not been studied in\nany nonthermal radiation. A question: What is the overall emission rate if a\nhigh quantum efficiency (QE), PL material, is heated to a temperature where it\nthermally emits a rate of 50 photons/sec at its bend edge, while in parallel is\nPL excited at a rate of 100 photons/sec. Recently, we discovered that the\nanswer is an overall rate of 100 blueshifted photons/sec. In contrast to\nthermal emission, the PL rate is conserved with temperature increase, while\neach photon is blueshifted. Further rise in temperature leads to an abrupt\ntransition to thermal emission where the photon rate increases sharply. These\nfindings show that PL is an ideal optical heat pump. Here we study, for the\nfirst time, the emission rate of PL radiation at moderate QE where nonradiative\nprocesses dominate the dynamics. Though conservation of photon rate does not\napply, we predict that the emission rate at 100% QE is an upper limit for the\noverall emission rate regardless of the QE. Also, the transition temperature to\nthermal emission is QE independent.\n", "  We describe the static dielectric response of ferroelastic-dielectric\nmicrocomposites. Dependence on temperature, pressure and concentration is\nconsidered for temperatures in the paraelastic transition. In recent years\nthere has been considerable interest in perovskite oxides for application in\nsolid oxide fuel cells (SOFC), exhaust gas sensors in automobiles, membranes\nfor separation processes and as catalysts, which are of the ferroeleastic\nnature, f.e. of the ($ LaSrCoO_{3}$) type. Ferroelastic-dielectric\nmicrocomposites and measurement of their properties may improve properties of\nperovskite oxides for these applications.\n", "  Debate topic for Effective Field Theory (EFT) is the choice of a \"basis\" for\n$\\mrdim = 6$ operators Clearly all bases are equivalent as long as they are a\n\"basis\", containing a minimal set of operators after the use of equations of\nmotion and respecting gauge invariance. From a more formal point of view a\nbasis is characterized by its closure with respect to renormalization.\nEquivalence of bases should always be understood as a statement for the\nS-matrix and not for the Lagrangian, as dictated by the equivalence theorem.\nAny phenomenological approach that misses one of these ingredients is still\nacceptable for a preliminar analysis, as long as it does not pretend to be an\nEFT. Here we revisit the equivalence theorem and its consequences for EFT when\ntwo sets of higher dimensional operators are connected by a set of non-linear,\nnoninvariant, field reparametrizations.\n", "  We perform a complete Hamiltonian analysis of the BFCG action for a general\nLie 2-group by using the Dirac procedure. We show that the resulting dynamical\nconstraints eliminate all local degrees of freedom which implies that the BFCG\ntheory is a topological field theory.\n", "  Applications of metallic metamaterials have generated significant interest in\nrecent years. Electromagnetic behavior of metamaterials in the optical range is\nusually characterized by a local-linear response. In this article, we develop a\nfinite-difference time-domain (FDTD) solution of the hydrodynamic model that\ndescribes a free electron gas in metals. Extending beyond the local-linear\nresponse, the hydrodynamic model enables numerical investigation of nonlocal\nand nonlinear interactions between electromagnetic waves and metallic\nmetamaterials. By explicitly imposing the current continuity constraint, the\nproposed model is solved in a self-consistent manner. Charge, energy and\nangular momentum conservation laws of high-order harmonic generation have been\ndemonstrated for the first time by the Maxwell-hydrodynamic FDTD model. The\nmodel yields nonlinear optical responses for complex metallic metamaterials\nirradiated by a variety of waveforms. Consequently, the multiphysics model\nopens up unique opportunities for characterizing and designing nonlinear\nnanodevices.\n", "  We propose the resource theory of a special antiunitary asymmetry in quantum\ntheory. The notion of antiunitary asymmetry, in particular, ${\\cal\nPT}$-asymmetry is different from the usual resource theory for asymmetry about\nunitary representation of a symmetry group, as the ${\\cal PT}$ operator is an\nantiunitary operator with ${\\cal P}$ being any self-inverse unitary and ${\\cal\nT}$ being the time-reversal operations. Here, we introduce the ${\\cal\nPT}$-symmetric states, ${\\cal PT}$-covariant operations and ${\\cal\nPT}$-asymmetry measures. For single qubit system, we find duality relations\nbetween the ${\\cal PT}$-asymmetry measures and the coherence. Moreover, for\ntwo-qubit states we prove the duality relations between the ${\\cal\nPT}$-asymmetry measures and entanglement measure such as the concurrence. This\ngives a resource theoretic interpretation to the concurrence which is lacking\ntill today. Thus, the ${\\cal PT}$-asymmetry measure and entanglement can be\nviewed as two sides of an underlying resource. Finally, the ${\\cal\nPT}$-symmetric dynamics is discussed and some open questions are addressed.\n", "  In this paper we provide using the Clifford and spin-Clifford formalism and\nsome few results of the extensor calculus a derivation of the conservation laws\nthat follow directly from the Dirac-Hestenes equation (DHE) describing a\nDirac-Hestenes spinor field (DHSF) in interaction with an external\nelectromagnetic field without using the Lagrangian formalism. In particular, we\nshow that the energy-momentum and total angular momentum extensors of a DHSF is\nnot conserved in spacetime regions permitting the existence of a null\nelectromagnetic field F but a non null electromagnetic potential A. These\nresults have been used together with some others recently obtained (e.g., that\nthe classical relativistic Hamilton-Jacobi equation is equivalent to a DHE\nsatisfied by a particular class of DHSF) to obtain the correct relativistic\nquantum potential when the Dirac theory is interpreted as a de Broglie-Bohm\ntheory. Some results appearing in the literature on this issue are criticized\nand the origin of some misconceptions is detailed with a rigorous mathematical\nanalysis.\n", "  Electromagnetic effects in the leptonic decay rates $\\pi^+ \\to \\mu^+ \\nu$ and\n$K^+ \\to \\mu^+ \\nu$ are evaluated for the first time on the lattice. Following\na method recently proposed in Ref. [1] the emission of virtual photons at\nleading order in the electromagnetic coupling is evaluated on the lattice and\nthe infrared divergence computed for a point-like meson at finite lattice\nvolume is subtracted. The physical decay rate is then obtained by adding the\nemission of real and virtual photons regularised with a photon mass. Using the\ngauge ensembles produced by the European Twisted Mass Collaboration with $N_f =\n2 + 1 + 1$ dynamical quarks the feasibility of our approach is demonstrated.\nPreliminary results for the electromagnetic corrections to charged (neutral)\npion and kaon masses as well as to the leptonic decay rates of charged pions\nand kaons are presented.\n", "  We bring up the fact that the bulk thermal properties of the hadron gas, as\nmeasured on the lattice, preclude a very fast rising of the number of resonance\nstates in the QCD spectrum, as assumed by the Hagedorn hypothesis, unless a\nsubstantial repulsion between hadronic resonances is present. If the Hagedorn\ngrowth continued above masses ~1.8 GeV, then the thermodynamic functions would\nnoticeably depart from the measured lattice values at temperatures above 140\nMeV, just below the transition temperature to quark-gluon plasma.\n", "  Expansions over Legendre functions are suggested as a model-independent way\nof compact presentation of modern precise and high-statistics data for\ntwo-hadron reactions. Some properties of the expansions are described.\n", "  In earlier work, we used a gauge independent Abelian Decomposition to show\nthat Abelian degrees of freedom are wholly responsible for the static quark\npotential. The restricted Abelian field can be split into two terms, a Maxwell\nterm and a $\\theta$ (Dirac) term. The $\\theta$ term's contribution to the\nstring tension can be analysed theoretically and numerically, and arises\nbecause of the existence of a certain type of monopole. While the Abelian field\ncan be constructed without gauge fixing, its two component parts are\ngauge-dependent, with a gauge transformation moving the topological features\nfrom one part to another. This allows us to isolate and identify the\ntopological objects responsible for confinement by constructing a gauge where\nthe $\\theta$ term wholly accounts for the string tension. We confirm the\npresence of these monopoles in lattice simulations of SU(2) Yang-Mills theory.\n", "  We present new Blue Straggler Star (BSS) catalogs in 38 Milky Way globular\nclusters (GCs) based on multi-passband and multi-epoch treasury survey data\nfrom the Hubble Space Telescope. We measure precise astrometry and relative\nproper motions of stars in all target clusters and performed a subsequent\ncluster membership selection. We study the accuracy of our proper motion\nmeasurements using estimates of central velocity dispersions and find very good\nagreement with previous studies in the literature. Finally, we present a\nhomogeneous BSS selection method, that expands the classic BSS selection\nparameter space to more evolved BSS evolutionary stages. We apply this method\nto the proper-motion cleaned GC star catalogs in order to define proper-motion\ncleaned BSS catalogs in all 38 GCs, which we make publicly available to enable\nfurther study and follow-up observations.\n", "  Single crystals of a ternary relaxor ferroelectric system,\n0.29Pb(In1/2Nb1/2)O3-0.45Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.26PbTiO3, have been studied using\ntriple-axis based elastic and inelastic neutron scattering. Elastic diffuse\nscattering confirms the presence of polar nano-regions (PNRs) in this system.\nThe PNRs emerge at the Burns temperature, TB = 630 K and then grow continuously\nin population and correlation size as the crystal cools down to 100 K. At 300\nK, characteristic 'butterfly' and ellipsoid shaped diffuse scattering patterns\nare observed on the HK0 reciprocal space plane. Electrical poling along the\n[110] direction produces a marked asymmetry in the diffuse scattering patterns,\nwith the parallel-to-the-field components enhanced while the\nperpendicular-to-the-field components suppressed. Several low energy phonon\nbranches along the [001] and [111] directions were studied. Most significantly,\nthe PNR-acoustic phonon coupling is confirmed for the [110] transverse acoustic\n(TA) phonons polarized along the [1-10] real space direction and the [100] TA\nphonons. This coupling appears to be anisotropic and correlated with the\ndistribution of PNRs, and also affected by the relative length scales of the\nPNRs and phonon wave vectors. The well-known 'waterfall' phenomenon is observed\non the [001] and [110] transverse optical (TO) branches, near the zone center.\nThe optical phonon measurements also reveal a lowest-energy, zone center soft\nTO mode, whose squared phonon energy increase linearly with decreasing\ntemperature below the TB.\n", "  Masses of $^{52g,52m}$Co were measured for the first time with an accuracy of\n$\\sim 10$ keV, an unprecedented precision reached for short-lived nuclei in the\nisochronous mass spectrometry. Combining our results with the previous\n$\\beta$-$\\gamma$ measurements of $^{52}$Ni, the $T=2$, $J^{\\pi}=0^+$ isobaric\nanalog state (IAS) in $^{52}$Co was newly assigned, questioning the\nconventional identification of IASs from the $\\beta$-delayed proton emissions.\nUsing our energy of the IAS in $^{52}$Co, the masses of the $T=2$ multiplet fit\nwell into the Isobaric Multiplet Mass Equation. We find that the IAS in\n$^{52}$Co decays predominantly via $\\gamma$ transitions while the proton\nemission is negligibly small. According to our large-scale shell model\ncalculations, this phenomenon has been interpreted to be due to very low\nisospin mixing in the IAS.\n", "  ESASky is a new science-driven discovery portal for all ESA astronomical\nmissions that gives users worldwide a simplified access to high-level\nscience-ready products from ESA and other data providers. The tool features a\nsky exploration interface and a single/multiple target interface, and it\nrequires no prior knowledge of specific details of each mission.

The\nfirst version of the tool, released in May 2016, provides access to imaging\ndata and a number of catalogues. Future releases will enable retrieval of\nspectroscopic data and will incorporate futures to allow time-domain\nexploration and the study of Solar System objects.\n", "  The high current density required by Magnetic Tunneling Junction (MTJ)\nswitching driven by Spin Transfer Torque (STT) effect leads to large power\nconsumption and severe reliability issues therefore hinder the timetable for\nSTT Magnetic Random Access Memory (STT-MRAM) to mass market. By utilizing\nVoltage Controlled Magnetic Anisotropy (VCMA) effect, the MTJ can be switched\nby voltage effect and is postulated to achieve ultra-low power (fJ). However,\nthe VCMA coefficient measured in experiments is far too small for MTJ dimension\nbelow 100 nm. Here in this work, a novel approach for the amplification of VCMA\neffect which borrow ideas from negative capacitance is proposed. The\nfeasibility of the proposal is proved by physical simulation and in-depth\nanalysis.\n", "  The Standard Model has been effective way beyond expectations in foreseeing\nthe result of almost all the experimental tests done up so far. In it,\nneutrinos are massless. Nonetheless, in recent years we have collected solid\nproofs indicating little but non zero masses for the neutrinos (when contrasted\nwith those of the charged leptons). These masses permit neutrinos to change\ntheir flavor and oscillate, indeed a unique treat. In these lectures, I discuss\nthe properties and the amazing potential of neutrinos in and beyond the\nStandard Model.\n", "  We present the results of applying our inside-out velocity projection and\nflux modulation mapping techniques to the Doppler tomography of magnetic\ncataclysmic variables. The inside-out tomogram is constructed by directly\nprojecting phase-resolved spectra onto the inside-out framework. In addition,\nour flux modulation mapping technique extracts any information related to the\nmodulation of the line flux by utilising consecutive half-phase tomograms. We\napply this to both the standard and the inside-out techniques. Our test cases,\nthe polars HU Aqr and V834 Cen, and the intermediate polar PQ Gem, were chosen\nbecause of their known accretion characteristics, namely ballistic, magnetic\nand curtain dominated accretion, respectively. In all three cases the\ninside-out tomogram better exposes low-velocity emission details which are\noverly compacted in the standard tomogram. This is especially apparent for the\nmid-inclination V834 Cen where the almost blob-like blended lower velocity\nemission in the standard tomogram is more exposed in the inside-out tomogram,\nmaking it easier to distinguish between the ballistic and magnetically confined\naccretion flows that are evident in the trailed spectra. Similarly, the\ninside-out tomogram enhances high velocity emission details which are washed\nout in the standard tomogram. This is particularly effective in revealing the\nhigh velocity magnetic accretion flows in the polars HU Aqr and V834 Cen. The\naddition of our flux modulation technique gives a significant improvement in\nreproducing the trailed input spectra adding more confidence to the\ninterpretation of the Doppler maps. Furthermore, amplitude and phase maps are\nconstructed that further reveal amplitude and phasing characteristics of the\nemission components in the three test cases.\n", "  Dielectric breakdown has historically been of great interest from the\nperspectives of fundamental physics and electrical reliability. However, to\ndate, the anisotropy in the dielectric breakdown has not been discussed. Here,\nwe report an anisotropic dielectric breakdown strength (EBD) for h-BN, which is\nused as an ideal substrate for two-dimensional (2D) material devices. Under a\nwell-controlled relative humidity, EBD values in the directions both normal and\nparallel to the c axis (EBD+c & EBD//c) were measured to be 3 and 12 MV/cm,\nrespectively. When the crystal structure is changed from sp3 of cubic-BN (c-BN)\nto sp2 of h-BN, EBD+c for h-BN becomes smaller than that for c-BN, while EBD//c\nfor h-BN drastically increases. Therefore, h-BN can possess a relatively high\nEBD concentrated only in the direction parallel to the c axis by conceding a\nweak bonding direction in the highly anisotropic crystal structure. This\nexplains why the EBD//c for h-BN is higher than that for diamond. Moreover, the\npresented EBD value obtained from the high quality bulk h-BN crystal can be\nregarded as the standard for qualifying the crystallinity of h-BN layers grown\nvia chemical vapor deposition for future electronic applications.\n", "  The integration of high-k oxide on graphene using atomic layer deposition\nrequires an electrically reliable buffer layer. In this study, Y was selected\nas the buffer layer due to the highest oxidation ability in rare earth elements\nand various oxidation methods (atmospheric, high-pressure O2 and ozone) were\napplied to the Y metal buffer layer. By optimizing oxidation conditions of the\ntop gate insulator, we successfully improve the capacitance of top gate Y2O3\ninsulator and demonstrate a large Ion/Ioff ratio for bilayer graphene under an\nexternal electric field.\n", "  The quantum theory of polarized light allows one to model scattering in the\nsolar atmosphere for inferring its properties. This powerful approach has\nrevealed two key long-standing problems in solar physics: the puzzling dilemmas\nbetween theory and observations in several anomalously polarized spectral lines\nand the need for inferring the ubiquitous weak chromospheric magnetic fields,\nwhich requires discriminating the Hanle effect in dynamic optically thick\nplasmas. However, the ever-present dynamics, i.e., the temporal evolution of\nheatings and macroscopic motions, has been widely disregarded when modeling and\ninterpreting the scattering polarization. This has hindered a consistent\ntheoretical solution to the puzzle while falsifying the Hanle diagnosis. Here,\nwe show that the dynamical evolution is a keystone for solving both problems\nbecause its systematic impact allows an explanation of the observations from\n'anomalous' instantaneous polarization signals. Evolution accounted for, we\nreproduce amplitudes and (spectral and spatial) shapes of the Ca I 4227 A\npolarization at solar disk center, identifying a restrictive arrangement of\nmagnetic fields, kinematics, heatings, and spatio-temporal resolution. We find\nthat the joint action of dynamics, Hanle effect, and low temporal resolutions\nmimics Zeeman linear polarization profiles, the true weak-field Zeeman signals\nbeing negligible. Our results allow reinterpretation of many polarization\nsignals of the solar spectra and support time-dependent scattering polarization\nas a powerful tool for deciphering the spatio-temporal distribution of\nchromospheric heatings and fields. This approach may be a key aid in developing\nthe Hanle diagnosis for the solar atmosphere.\n", "  The D$_1$ enigma is an anomaly, which was first observed on the Sun as a\nsymmetric polarization peak centered in the core of the sodium D$_1$ line that\nis expected to be intrinsically unpolarizable. To resolve this problem the\nunderlying physics was later explored in the laboratory for D$_1$ scattering at\npotassium vapor. The experiment showed that the scattering phase matrix element\n$P_{21}$ is positive while $P_{22}$ is negative, although standard quantum\nscattering theory predicts that both should be zero. This experimental\ncontradiction is currently the main manifestation of the D$_1$ enigma.\nSubsequent theoretical studies showed that such polarization effects may arise\nif scattering theory is extended to allow for interference effects due to level\nsplittings of the ground state, in contrast to standard scattering theory,\nwhich only allows for interferences from level splittings of the intermediate\nstate. Previous attempts to implement this idea had to rely on heuristic\narguments to allow modeling of the experimental data. In the present paper we\ndevelop a formulation of the theory that can be self-consistently applied to\nquantum systems with any combination of electronic and nuclear spins. No\nstatistical equilibrium or optical pumping is needed. The atom is assumed to be\nunpolarized at the beginning of each scattering event. The theory is capable of\nexplaining both the phase matrix behavior of the laboratory data and the\nexistence of a symmetric polarization peak in the core of the solar D$_1$ line.\nWe also use it to predict the polarization structures that we expect to see in\na next-generation laboratory experiment with the rubidium isotopes $^{87}$Rb\nand $^{85}$Rb.\n", "  Based on the recently-established Master kinetic equation and related Master\nconstant H-theorem which describe the statistical behavior of the\nBoltzmann-Sinai classical dynamical system for smooth and hard spherical\nparticles, the problem is posed of determining a microscopic statistical\ndescription holding for an incompressible Navier-Stokes fluid. The goal is\nreached by introducing a suitable mean-field interaction in the Master kinetic\nequation. The resulting Modified Master Kinetic Equation (MMKE) is proved to\nwarrant at the same time the condition of mass-density incompressibility and\nthe validity of the Navier-Stokes fluid equation. In addition, it is shown that\nthe conservation of the Boltzmann-Shannon entropy can similarly be warranted.\nApplications to the plane Couette and Poiseuille flows are considered showing\nthat they can be regarded as final decaying states for suitable non-stationary\nflows. As a result, it is shown that an arbitrary initial stochastic $1-$body\nPDF evolving in time by means of MMKE necessarily exhibits the phenomenon of\nDecay to Kinetic Equilibrium (DKE), whereby the $1-$body PDF asymptotically\nrelaxes to a stationary and spatially-uniform Maxwellian PDF.\n", "  Phonons (collective atomic vibrations in solids) are more effective in\ntransporting heat than photons. This is the reason why the conduction mode of\nheat transport in nonmetals (mediated by phonons) is dominant compared to the\nradiation mode of heat transport (mediated by photons). However, since phonons\nare unable to traverse a vacuum gap (unlike photons) it is commonly believed\nthat two bodies separated by a gap cannot exchange heat via phonons. Recently,\na mechanism was proposed by which phonons can transport heat across a vacuum\ngap - through Van der Waals interaction between two bodies with gap less than\nwavelength of light. Such heat transfer mechanisms are highly relevant for\nheating (and cooling) of nanostructures; the heating of the flying heads in\nmagnetic storage disks is a case in point. Here, the theoretical derivation for\nmodeling phonon transmission is revisited and extended to the case of two\nbodies made of different materials separated by a vacuum gap. Magnitudes of\nphonon transmission, and hence the heat transfer, for commonly used materials\nin the micro and nano-electromechanical industry are calculated and compared\nwith the calculation of conduction heat transfer through air for small gaps.\n", "  In the context of the recent synchronicity problem in $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology,\ncoasting models such as the classic Milne model and the $R_h=ct$ model have\nattracted much attention. Also, a very recent analysis of supernovae Ia data is\nreported to favour models with constant expansion rates. We point out that the\nnonempty $R_h=ct$ model has some known antecedents in the literature. Some of\nthese are published even before the discovery of the accelerated expansion and\nwere shown to have none of the cosmological problems and also that $H_0t_0=1$\nand $\\Omega_m/\\Omega_{dark \\; energy}$ = some constant of the order of unity.\nIn this paper, we also derive such a model by a complex extension of scale\nfactor in the Milne model.\n", "  Based on the consideration that the black hole horizon and the cosmological\nhorizon of Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black hole in de Sitter space are not\nindependent each other, we conjecture the total entropy of the system should\nhave an extra term contributed from the entanglement between the two horizons,\nexcept for the sum of the two horizon entropies. Making use of the globally\neffective first law and the effective thermodynamic quantities, we derive the\ntotal entropy and find that it will diverge as the two horizons tends to\ncoincide.\n", "  The main subjects of the PhD dissertation concern cosmological models\nconsidered in Palatini f(R) gravity and scalar-tensor theories. We introduce a\nsimple generalization of the LCDM model based on Palatini modified gravity with\nquadratic Starobinsky term. A matter source is provided by generalized\nChaplygin gas. The statistical analysis of our model is investigated. We use\ndynamical system approach to study the evolution of the Universe. The model\nreaches a very good agreement with the newest experimental data and yields an\ninflationary epoch caused by a singularity of the type III. The present-day\naccelerated expansion is also provided by the model. We also show that the Lie\nand Noether symmetry approaches are very useful tools in cosmological\nconsiderations. We examine two other models of Extended Theories of Gravity\n(ETGs): the novel hybrid metric-Palatini gravity and a minimally coupled to\ngravity scalar field. The first one is applied to homogeneous and isotropic\nmodel while in the scalar-tensor theory we study anisotropic universes. We use\nthe symmetries in order to find unknown forms of potential and to solve\nclassical field equations in both models. The symmetries also are very helpful\nin searching exact and invariant solutions of Wheeler-DeWitt equations. In the\nlast part we are interested in equilibrium configurations and stability\nconditions of relativistic stars in the framework of scalar-tensor theories.\nFirstly, we show that TOV-like form of the equilibrium equations can be\nobtained for a wide class of ETGs if generalized energy density and pressure\nare defined. According to our studies, a neutron star is a stable system for\nthe minimally coupled scalar field model. There is a supplement including notes\non symmetries as well as dynamical systems approach. The illustrative examples\nof applications are also provided.\n", "  Is it physically feasible to perform chromospheric diagnosis using spatial\nmaps of scattering polarization at the solar disk center? To investigate it we\nsynthesized polarization maps (in 8542 Angstroms) resulting from MHD solar\nmodels and NLTE radiative transfer calculations that consider Hanle effect and\nvertical macroscopic motions. After explaining the physical con- text of\nforward scattering and presenting our results, we arrive at the definition of\nHanle polarity inversion lines. We show how such features can give support for\na clearer chromospheric diagnosis in which the magnetic and dynamic effects in\nthe scattering polarization could be disentangled.\n", "  Optimized light-matter coupling in semiconductor nanostructures is a key to\nunderstand their optical properties and can be enabled by advanced fabrication\ntechniques. Using in-situ electron beam lithography combined with a\nlow-temperature cathodoluminescence imaging, we deterministically fabricate\nmicrolenses above selected InAs quantum dots (QDs) achieving their efficient\ncoupling to the external light field. This enables to perform four-wave mixing\nmicro-spectroscopy of single QD excitons, revealing the exciton population and\ncoherence dynamics. We infer the temperature dependence of the dephasing in\norder to address the impact of phonons on the decoherence of confined excitons.\nThe loss of the coherence over the first picoseconds is associated with the\nemission of a phonon wave packet, also governing the phonon background in\nphotoluminescence (PL) spectra. Using theory based on the independent boson\nmodel, we consistently explain the initial coherence decay, the zero-phonon\nline fraction, and the lineshape of the phonon-assisted PL using realistic\nquantum dot geometries.\n", "  We present a study of variable stars in globular cluster NGC 6401. The\ncluster is only $5.3\\degr$ away from the Galactic centre and suffers from\nstrong differential reddening. The photometric precision afforded us by\ndifference image analysis resulted in improved sensitivity to variability in\nformerly inaccessible interior regions of the cluster. We find 23 RRab and 11\nRRc stars within one cluster radius (2.4$\\arcmin$), for which we provide\ncoordinates, finder-charts and time-series photometry. Through Fourier\ndecomposition of the RR Lyrae star light curves we derive a mean metallicity of\n[Fe/H]$_{\\mathrm{UVES}} = -1.13 \\pm 0.06$ (${\\rm [Fe/H]}_{\\mathrm{ZW}} = -1.25\n\\pm 0.06$), and a distance of $d\\approx 6.35 \\pm 0.81$ kpc. Using the RR Lyrae\npopulation, we also determine that NGC 6401 is an Oosterhoff type I cluster.\n", "  This is a Reply to Nemirovskii Comment [Phys. Rev. B 94, 146501 (2016)] on\nthe Khomenko et al, [Phys.Rev. B v.91, 180504(2016)], in which a new form of\nthe production term in Vinen's equation for the evolution of the vortex-line\ndensity $\\cal L$ in the thermal counterflow of superfluid $^4$He in a channel\nwas suggested. To further substantiate the suggested form which was questioned\nin the Comment, we present a physical explanation for the improvement of the\nclosure suggested in Khomenko et al [Phys.Rev. B v. 91, 180504(2016)] in\ncomparison to the form proposed by Vinen. We also discuss the closure for the\nflux term, which agrees well with the numerical results without any fitting\nparameters.\n", "  Sharing rides could drastically improve the efficiency of car and taxi\ntransportation. Unleashing such potential, however, requires understanding how\nurban parameters affect the fraction of individual trips that can be shared, a\nquantity that we call shareability. Using data on millions of taxi trips in New\nYork City, San Francisco, Singapore, and Vienna, we compute the shareability\ncurves for each city, and find that a natural rescaling collapses them onto a\nsingle, universal curve. We explain this scaling law theoretically with a\nsimple model that predicts the potential for ride sharing in any city, using a\nfew basic urban quantities and no adjustable parameters. Accurate\nextrapolations of this type will help planners, transportation companies, and\nsociety at large to shape a sustainable path for urban growth.\n", "  We consider a cantilever mechanical oscillator(MO) made of diamond. There is\na nitrogen-vacancy(NV) center at the end of the cantilever. Two magnetic tips\ninduce strong second order magnetic field gradient near the NV center. Under a\ncoherent driving on MO, we find that the coupling between the MO and the NV\ncenter can be greatly enhanced. We studied how to realize quantum state\ntransfer between MO and NV center and generate entanglement between them. We\nalso proposed a scheme to generate the two-mode squeezing between different MO\nmodes by coupling them to the same NV center. The decoherence and dissipation\neffects for both MO and NV center are numerically calculated by taking the\npresent experimental parameters. It is found that high fidelity quantum state\ntransfer, entanglement generation, and large two-mode squeezing could be\nachieved.\n", "  In recent years, there has been growing interest in the study of\ncoevolutionary games on networks. Despite much progress, little attention has\nbeen paid to spatially embedded networks, where the underlying geographic\ndistance, rather than the graph distance, is an important and relevant aspect\nof the partner rewiring process. It thus remains largely unclear how individual\npartner rewiring range preference, local vs. global, emerges and affects\ncooperation. Here we explicitly address this issue using a coevolutionary model\nof cooperation and partner rewiring range preference in spatially embedded\nsocial networks. In contrast to local rewiring, global rewiring has no distance\nrestriction but incurs a one-time cost upon establishing any long range link.\nWe find that under a wide range of model parameters, global partner switching\npreference can coevolve with cooperation. Moreover, the resulting partner\nnetwork is highly degree-heterogeneous with small average shortest path length\nwhile maintaining high clustering, thereby possessing small-world properties.\nWe also discover an optimum availability of reputation information for the\nemergence of global cooperators, who form distant partnerships at a cost to\nthemselves. From the coevolutionary perspective, our work may help explain the\nubiquity of small-world topologies arising alongside cooperation in the real\nworld.\n", "  We present our study of the differential cross section for the Higgs boson\nproduction in $k_T$-factorization framework. The $k_T$-factorization formalism\nincludes a convolution over unintegrated parton distribution functions (uPDF)\nand off-shell parton level matrix element. The off-shell matrix element\ncalculated considering initial gluons to be off-shell. We have considered only\ngluon fusion process which is dominant production mechanism for the Higgs boson\nproduction at LHC. We have used Ciafaloni-Catani-Fiorani-Marchesini (CCFM) uPDF\nbased on CCFM evolution equations. We have compared our results with fixed\norder estimates up to NNLO+NNLL obtained using HRes tool within collinear\nfactorization framework as well as with the ATLAS and CMS measurements of the\ncorresponding differential distributions. This study will play an important\nrole in understanding differential cross section within $k_T$-factorization\nframework.\n", "  We present a method to compute the two-point functions for an $O(N)$ scalar\nfield model in de Sitter spacetime, avoiding the well known infrared problems\nfor massless fields. The method is based on an exact treatment of the Euclidean\nzero modes and a perturbative one of the nonzero modes, and involves a partial\nresummation of the leading secular terms. This resummation, crucial to obtain a\ndecay of the correlation functions, is implemented along with a double\nexpansion in an effective coupling constant $\\sqrt\\lambda$ and in $1/N$. The\nresults reduce to those known in the leading infrared approximation and\ncoincide with the ones obtained directly in Lorentzian de Sitter spacetime in\nthe large $N$ limit. The new method allows for a systematic calculation of\nhigher order corrections both in $\\sqrt\\lambda$ and in $1/N$.\n", "  This study addresses high electric field transport in multilayer black\nphosphorus (BP) field effect transistors (FETs) with self-heating and thermal\nspreading by dielectric engineering. Interestingly, we found that multilayer BP\ndevice on a SiO2 substrate exhibited a maximum current density of 3.3 x 10E10\nA/m2 at an electric field of 5.58 MV/m, several times higher than multilayer\nMoS2. Our breakdown thermometry analysis revealed that self-heating was impeded\nalong BP-dielectric interface, resulting in a thermal plateau inside the\nchannel and eventual Joule breakdown. Using a size-dependent electro-thermal\ntransport model, we extracted an interfacial thermal conductance of 1-10 MW/m2\nK for the BP-dielectric interfaces. By using hBN as a dielectric material for\nBP instead of thermally resistive SiO2 (about 1.4 W/m K), we observed a 3 fold\nincrease in breakdown power density and a relatively higher electric field\nendurance together with efficient and homogenous thermal spreading because hBN\nhad superior structural and thermal compatibility with BP. We further confirmed\nour results based on micro-Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy, and\nobserved that BP devices on hBN exhibited centrally localized hotspots with a\nbreakdown temperature of 600K, while the BP device on SiO2 exhibited a hotspot\nin the vicinity of the electrode at 520K.\n", "  In the process of understanding nuclear collisions, reliable extrapolations\nfrom pp collisions, based on Glauber models, are highly desirable, though\nseldomly accurate. We review the inclusion of diffractive excitations and argue\nthat they provide an important contribution to centrality observables in pA\ncollisions. We present a method for distinguishing between diffractively and\nnon-diffractively wounded nucleons, and a proof-of-principle for an\nextrapolation of multiparton interaction models built on this.\n", "  General violations of Lorentz symmetry can be described by the Standard-Model\nExtension (SME) framework. The SME predicts modifications to existing physics\nand can be tested in high-precision experiments. By looking for small\ndeviations from Newton gravity, short-range gravity experiments are expected to\nbe sensitive to possible gravitational Lorentz-violation signals. With two\ngroup's short-range gravity data analyzed recently, no nonminimal Lorentz\nviolation signal is found at the micron distance scale, which gives stringent\nconstraints on nonminimal Lorentz-violation coefficients in the SME.\n", "  In this talk we present our results on the sensitivity to the neutrino mass\nhierarchy, the octant of the mixing angle and the CP phase in the future long\nbaseline experiments T2HK and DUNE as well as in the atmospheric neutrino\nobservation at Hyperkamiokande (HK).\n", "  In this talk we discuss the possibility to test the hypothesis, which has\nbeen proposed to explain the tension between the mass-squared differences of\nthe solar neutrino and KamLAND experiments by the non-standard flavor-dependent\ninteraction in neutrino propagation, with the atmospheric neutrino observations\nat the future Hyper-Kamiokande experiment.\n", "  The QCD phase diagram at imaginary chemical potential exhibits a rich\nstructure and studying it can constrain the phase diagram at real values of the\nchemical potential. Moreover, at imaginary chemical potential standard\nnumerical techniques based on importance sampling can be applied, since no sign\nproblem is present. In the last decade, a first understanding of the QCD phase\ndiagram at purely imaginary chemical potential has been developed, but most of\nit is so far based on investigations on coarse lattices ($N_\\tau=4$,\n$a=0.3\\:$fm). Considering the $N_f=2$ case, at the Roberge-Weiss critical value\nof the imaginary chemical potential, the chiral/deconfinement transition is\nfirst order for light/heavy quark masses and second order for intermediate\nvalues of the mass: there are then two tricritical masses, whose position\nstrongly depends on the lattice spacing and on the discretization. On\n$N_\\tau=4$, we have the chiral $m_\\pi^{\\text{tric.}}=400\\:$MeV with unimproved\nstaggered fermions and $m_\\pi^{\\text{tric.}}\\gtrsim900\\:$MeV with unimproved\npure Wilson fermions. Employing finite size scaling we investigate the change\nof this tricritical point between $N_\\tau=4$ and $N_\\tau=6$ as well as between\nWilson and staggered discretizations.\n", "  Fluorescein is perhaps the most commonly used substance to visualize tear\nfilm thickness and dynamics; better understanding of this process aids\nunderstanding of dry eye syndrome which afflicts millions of people. We study a\nmathematical model for tear film flow, evaporation, solutal transport and\nfluorescence over the exposed ocular surface during the interblink. Transport\nof the fluorescein ion by fluid flow in the tear film affects the intensity of\nfluorescence via changes in concentration and tear film thickness. Evaporation\ncauses increased osmolarity and potential irritation over the ocular surface;\nit also alters fluorescein concentration and thus fluorescence. Using thinning\nrates from in vivo measurements together with thin film equations for flow and\ntransport of multiple solutes, we compute dynamic results for tear film\nquantities of interest. We compare our computed intensity distributions with in\nvivo observations. A number of experimental features are recovered by the\nmodel.\n", "  When a macroscopic concentration gradient is present across a binary mixture,\nlong-ranged non-equilibrium concentration fluctuations (NCF) appear as a\nconsequence of the coupling between the gradient and spontaneous equilibrium\nvelocity fluctuations. Long-ranged equilibrium concentration fluctuations (ECF)\nmay be also observed when the mixture is close to a critical point. Here we\nstudy the interplay between NCF and critical ECF in a near critical mixture\naniline/cyclohexane in the presence of a vertical concentration gradient. To\nthis aim, we exploit a commercial optical microscope and a simple, custom-made,\ntemperature-controlled cell to obtain simultaneous static and dynamic\nscattering information on the fluctuations. We first characterise the critical\nECF at fixed temperature $T$ above the upper critical solution temperature\n$T_{c}$, in the wide temperature range $T-T_{c}\\in[0.1,30]$ $^{o}$C. In this\nrange, we observe the expected critical scaling behaviour for both the\nscattering intensity and the mass diffusion coefficient and we determine the\ncritical exponents $\\gamma$, $\\nu$ and $\\eta$, which are found in agreement\nwith the 3D Ising values. We then study the system in the two-phase region\n($T<T_{c}$). In particular, we characterise the interplay between ECF and NCF\nwhen the mixture, initially at a temperature $T_{i}$, is rapidly brought to a\ntemperature $T_{f}>T_{i}$. During the transient, a vertical diffusive mass flux\nis present that causes the onset of NCF, whose amplitude vanishes with time, as\nthe flux goes to zero. We also study the time dependence of the equilibrium\nscattering intensity $I_{eq}$, of the crossover wave-vector $q_{co}$ and of the\ndiffusion coefficient $D$ during diffusion and find that all these quantities\nexhibit an exponential relaxation enslaved to the diffusive kinetics.\n", "  Titanyl-phthalocyanines catalytic ability towards oxygen reduction is\ndemonstrated in experimental literature. Our recent theoretical simulations\nrevealed electronic structure origin of catalytic ability in peripherally and\naxially substituted triplet and singlet titanyl-phthalocyanines. However, the\norigin of high electron transfer ability to spontaneously reduce peroxide in\nchlorine substituted singlet complex and triplet state Ti(II)Pc complexes\nremain elusive. Thus, we performed density functional theory calculations to\nstudy Ti(IV)Pc and their tailored peripheral substituted complexes as\nrepresentative compounds of titanyl-phthalocyanines for charge mobilities,\nreorganization energies and electronic couplings. In addition,\noxo(phthalocyaninato)titanium(IV) (TiOPc) convex and concave compounds were\ninvestigated to benchmark the method. Based on the results, Reorganization\nenergies of triplet state Ti(II)Pc and their tailored peripheral substituted\ncomplexes are compared with Ti(IV)Pc singlet complexes in order to understand\nthe charge mobility. Chlorine substituted complex demonstrates higher electron\nhopping rate due to higher electronic coupling in comparison to other halogens.\nSimilarly, weak electron-donating methyl group increases the electron transport\nrate. Moreover, halogen substituted Ti(II)Pc complexes elucidate lower\nreorganization energies. The lowest reorganization energy is predicted for\nchlorine substituted Ti(II)Pc complex, which is 0.09 eV. Therefore, higher\nelectronic coupling and lower reorganization energies can be considered as the\norigin of higher electron transfer ability of these complexes. Furthermore,\nincrease electron hopping rate due to weak electron-donating substituents\nprovide a method to produce efficient n-channel organic field-effect\ntransistors with higher electron mobility.\n", "  This paper deals with the statistical signal pro- cessing over graphs for\ntracking infection diffusion in social networks. Infection (or Information)\ndiffusion is modeled using the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model.\nMean field approximation is employed to approximate the discrete valued\ninfected degree distribution evolution by a deterministic ordinary differential\nequation for obtaining a generative model for the infection diffusion. The\ninfected degree distribution is shown to follow polynomial dynamics and is\nestimated using an exact non- linear Bayesian filter. We compute posterior\nCramer-Rao bounds to obtain the fundamental limits of the filter which depend\non the structure of the network. Considering the time-varying nature of the\nreal world networks, the relationship between the diffusion thresholds and the\ndegree distribution is investigated using generative models for real world\nnetworks. In addition, we validate the efficacy of our method with the\ndiffusion data from a real-world online social system, Twitter. We find that\nSIS model is a good fit for the information diffusion and the non-linear filter\neffectively tracks the information diffusion.\n", "  A detailed investigation of the functionality of inverted organic\nphotovoltaics (OPVs) using bare Ag contacts as top electrode is presented. The\ninverted OPVs without hole transporting layer (HTL) exhibit a significant gain\nin hole carrier selectivity and power conversion efficiency (PCE) after\nexposure in ambient conditions. Inverted OPVs comprised of\nITO/ZnO/poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl):phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester\n(P3HT:PCBM)/Ag demonstrate over 3.5% power conversion efficiency only if the\ndevices are exposed in air for over 4 days. As concluded through a series of\nmeasurements, the oxygen presence is essential to obtain fully operational\nsolar cell devices without HTL. Moreover, accelerated stability tests under\ndamp heat conditions (RH=85% and T=65oC) performed to non-encapsulated OPVs\ndemonstrate that HTL-free inverted OPVs exhibit comparable stability to the\nreference inverted OPVs. Importantly, it is shown that bare Ag top electrodes\ncan be efficiently used in inverted OPVs using various high performance\npolymer:fullerene bulk heterojunction material systems demonstrating 6.5% power\nconversion efficiencies.\n", "  SU(2) gauge theory with a single fermion in the fundamental representation is\na minimal non-Abelian candidate for the dark matter sector, which is presently\nmissing from the standard model. Having only a single flavor provides a natural\nmechanism for stabilizing dark matter on cosmological timescales. Preliminary\nlattice results are presented and discussed in the context of dark matter\nphenomenology.\n", "  We analyze recent results on isoscalar $\\pi\\pi$ scattering from a $N_f=2+1$\nlattice simulation by the HadronSpectrum collaboration by re-summing the\ntwo-flavor chiral scattering amplitude of the next-to-leading order in the\nso-called inverse amplitude method. The lattice data can be well extrapolated\nto the physical pion mass. We also find that both $I=0$ and $I=1$ lattice data\ncan be described simultaneously for pion masses up to $M_{\\pi}=236$ MeV.\n", "  We present two new connections between the inhomogeneous stochastic higher\nspin six vertex model in a quadrant and integrable stochastic systems from the\nMacdonald processes hierarchy. First, we show how Macdonald $q$-difference\noperators with $t=0$ (an algebraic tool crucial for studying the corresponding\nMacdonald processes) can be utilized to get $q$-moments of the height function\n$\\mathfrak{h}$ in the higher spin six vertex model first computed in\narXiv:1601.05770 using Bethe ansatz. This result in particular implies that for\nthe vertex model with the step Bernoulli boundary condition, the value of\n$\\mathfrak{h}$ at an arbitrary point\n$(N+1,T)\\in\\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge2}\\times\\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge1}$ has the same distribution\nas the last component $\\lambda_N$ of a random partition under a specific $t=0$\nMacdonald measure. On the other hand, it is known that\n$\\mathbf{x}_N:=\\lambda_N-N$ can be identified with the location of the $N$th\nparticle in a certain discrete time $q$-TASEP started from the step initial\nconfiguration. The second construction we present is a coupling of this\n$q$-TASEP and the higher spin six vertex model (with the step Bernoulli\nboundary condition) along time-like paths providing an independent\nprobabilistic explanation of the equality of $\\mathfrak{h}(N+1,T)$ and\n$\\mathbf{x}_N+N$ in distribution. Combined with the identification of averages\nof observables between the stochastic higher spin six vertex model and Schur\nmeasures (which are $t=q$ Macdonald measures) obtained recently in\narXiv:1608.01553, this produces GUE Tracy--Widom asymptotics for a discrete\ntime $q$-TASEP with the step initial configuration and special jump parameters.\n", "  We present results from model tests to investigate the effect of drafting in\nswimming, in particular for the lead swimmer. The drag for scaled-model passive\nswimmers was determined accurately at Froude numbers comparable to conditions\nfor actual human swimmers. Several positions of a draft swimmer at different\nseparations behind and alongside the lead swimmer were investigated. It was\nfound that a lead swimmer can experience an advantage from a draft swimmer.\nSeveral other positions of the draft swimmer relative to the frontal wave\ngenerated by the lead swimmer were also considered. These results indicate\nfavourable and undesirable positions during passing.\n", "  We study the fully nonlinear, nonlocal dynamics of two-dimensional\nmulticomponent vesicles in a shear flow with matched viscosity of the inner and\nouter fluids. Using a nonstiff, pseudo-spectral boundary integral method, we\ninvestigate dynamical patterns induced by inhomogeneous bending for a two phase\nsystem. Numerical results reveal that there exist novel phase-treading and\ntumbling mechanisms that cannot be observed for a homogeneous vesicle. In\nparticular, unlike the well-known steady tank-treading dynamics characterized\nby a fixed inclination angle, here the phase-treading mechanism leads to\nunsteady periodic dynamics with an oscillatory inclination angle. When the\naverage phase concentration is around 1/2, we observe tumbling dynamics even\nfor very low shear rate, and the excess length required for tumbling is\nsignificantly smaller than the value for the single phase case. We summarize\nour results in phase diagrams in terms of the excess length, shear rate, and\nconcentration of the soft phase. These findings go beyond the well known\ndynamical regimes of a homogeneous vesicle and highlight the level of\ncomplexity of vesicle dynamics in a fluid due to heterogeneous material\nproperties.\n", "  In lattice QCD the computation of one-particle irreducible (1PI) Green's\nfunctions with a large number (> 2) of legs is a challenging task. Besides\ntuning the lattice spacing and volume to reduce finite size effects, the\nproblems associated with the estimation of higher order moments via Monte Carlo\nmethods and the extraction of 1PI from complete Green's functions are\nlimitations of the method. Herein, we address these problems revisiting the\ncalculation of the three gluon 1PI Green's function.\n", "  We report on our recent results regarding numerical simulations of the four\ndimensional, N=1 Supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with SU(3) gauge symmetry and\nlight dynamical gluinos.\n", "  The Lueders postulate is reviewed and implications for the distinguishability\nof observables are discussed. As an example the distinguishability of two\nsimilar observables for spin-1/2 particles is described. Implementation issues\nare briefly analyzed.\n"]}
