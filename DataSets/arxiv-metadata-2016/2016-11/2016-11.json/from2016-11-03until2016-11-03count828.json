sites (origins) along the chromosome. Stochastic initiation\nimplies fluctuations in the time to complete and may lead to cell death if\nreplication takes longer than the cell cycle time ($\\approx 25$ min).\nSurprisingly, although the typical replication time is about 20 min, \\textit{in\nvivo} experiments show that replication fails to complete only about 1 in 300\ntimes. How is replication timing accurately controlled despite the\nstochasticity? Biologists have proposed two solutions to this\n\"random-completion problem.\" The first solution uses randomly located origins\nbut increases their rate of initiation as S phase proceeds, while the second\nuses regularly spaced origins. In this paper, we investigate the\nrandom-completion problem using a type of model first developed to describe the\nkinetics of first-order phase transitions. Using methods from the field of\nextreme-value statistics, we derive the distribution of replication-completion\ntimes for a finite genome. We then argue that the biologists' first solution to\nthe problem is not only consistent with experiment but also nearly optimizes\nthe use of replicative proteins. We also show that spatial regularity in origin\nplacement does not alter significantly the distribution of replication times\nand, thus, is not needed for the control of replication timing.\n", "  The theory of two counter-propagating polarized beams interacting in a\nrandomly birefringent fiber via the Kerr and Raman effects is developed and\napplied to the quantitative description of Raman polarizers in the undepleted\nregime. Here Raman polarizers, first reported by Martinelli et. al. [Opt.\nExpress. 17, 947 (2009)], are understood as Raman amplifiers operating in the\nregime in which an initially weak unpolarized beam is converted into an\namplified fully polarized beam towards the fiber output. Three parameters are\nselected for the characterization of a Raman polarizer: the degree of\npolarization of the outcoming beam, its state of polarization, and its gain.\nAll of these parameters represent quantities that are averaged over all random\npolarization states of the initially unpolarized signal beam. The presented\ntheory is computer friendly and applicable to virtually all practically\nrelevant situations, including the case of co-propagating beams, and in\nparticular to the undepleted as well as the depleted regimes of the Raman\npolarizer.\n", "  Fluctuations of conserved quantities are predicted to be sensitive to the\ncorrelation length and connected to the thermodynamic susceptibility. Thus,\nmoments of net-baryon, net-charge and net-strangeness have been extensively\nstudied theoretically and experimentally to explore phase structure and bulk\nproperties of QCD matters created in heavy ion collision experiment. As the\nmoments analysis is statistics hungry study, the error estimation is crucial to\nextract physics information from the limited experimental data. In this paper,\nwe will derive the limit distributions and error formula based on Delta theorem\nin statistics for various order moments used in the experimental data analysis.\nThe Monte Carlo simulation is also applied to test the error formula.\n", "  The behavior of an electron in an external uniform electromagnetic background\ncoupled to a harmonic potential, with noncommuting space coordinates, is\nconsidered in this work. The thermodynamics of the system is studied. Matrix\nvector coherent states (MVCS) as well as quaternionic vector coherent states\n(QVCS), satisfying required properties, are also constructed and discussed.\n", "  In cells, helicase translocation along nucleic acid is essential for many\nbiological processes. However, so far, the mechanism of this translocation is\nnot fully understood. Recent studies show that helicase might translocate\nthrough two processes, active process and passive process, with different\ntranslocation rate. In this study, a model including such two processes is\npresented. In which, each of these two processes consists of two sub-processes,\nchemical sub-process in which needed translocation factors are attached, and\nmechanochemical sub-process in which helicase makes a forward translocation\nstep. Helicase can switch stochastically between these two processes with\nexternal force dependent rates. By this model, ribosome translocation along\nmessage RNA is detailed discussed. We found that, with the increase of external\nforce, the mean translocation rate of ribosome increases from one lower limit\nto one upper limit, and both of these two limits increase with concentrations\nof the translocation factors. Under high external force, ribosome translocates\nmainly through active process. At saturating concentrations of translocation\nfactors, the translocation is governed by mechanochemical sub-processes.\n", "  We show that the standard Calogero Lax matrix can be interpreted as a\nfunction on the fuzzy sphere and the Avan-Talon r-matrix as a function on the\ndirect product of two fuzzy spheres. We calculate the limiting Lax function and\nr-function when the fuzzy sphere tends to the ordinary sphere and we show that\nthey define an integrable model interpreted as a large N Calogero model by\nBordemann, Hoppe and Theisen.\n", "  For a general subcritical second-order elliptic operator $P$ in a domain\n$\\Omega \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ (or noncompact manifold), we construct\nHardy-weight $W$ which is optimal in the following sense. The operator $P -\n\\lambda W$ is subcritical in $\\Omega$ for all $\\lambda < 1$, null-critical in\n$\\Omega$ for $\\lambda = 1$, and supercritical near any neighborhood of infinity\nin $\\Omega$ for any $\\lambda > 1$. Moreover, if $P$ is symmetric and $W>0$,\nthen the spectrum and the essential spectrum of $W^{-1}P$ are equal to\n$[1,\\infty)$, and the corresponding Agmon metric is complete.\n  Our method is based on the theory of positive solutions and applies to both\nsymmetric and nonsymmetric operators. The constructed Hardy-weight is given by\nan explicit simple formula involving two distinct positive solutions of the\nequation $Pu=0$, the existence of which depends on the subcriticality of $P$ in\n$\\Omega$.\n", "  A new (\\gamma_n,\\sigma_k)-KP hierarchy with two new time series \\gamma_n and\n\\sigma_k, which consists of \\gamma_n-flow, \\sigma_k-flow and mixed \\gamma_n and\n\\sigma_k evolution equations of eigenfunctions, is proposed. Two reductions and\nconstrained flows of (\\gamma_n,\\sigma_k)-KP hierarchy are studied. The dressing\nmethod is generalized to the (\\gamma_n,\\sigma_k)-KP hierarchy and some\nsolutions are presented.\n", "  The onset of the asymmetry of planetary nebulae (PNe) is expected to occur\nduring the late Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) and early post-AGB phases of low-\nand intermediate-mass stars. Among all post-AGB objects, the most heavily\nobscured ones might have escaped the selection criteria of previous studies\ndetecting extreme axysimmetric structures in young PNe. Since the most heavily\nobscured post-AGB sources can be expected to descend from the most massive PN\nprogenitors, these should exhibit clear asymmetric morphologies. We have\nobtained VISIR-VLT mid-IR images of four heavily obscured post-AGB objects\nbarely resolved in previous Spitzer IRAC observations to analyze their\nmorphology and physical conditions across the mid-IR. The VISIR-VLT images have\nbeen deconvolved, flux calibrated, and used to construct RGB composite pictures\nas well as color and optical depth maps that allow us to study the morphology\nand physical properties of the extended emission of these sources. We have\ndetected extended emission from the four objects in our sample and resolved it\ninto several structural components that are greatly enhanced in the temperature\nand optical depth maps. They reveal the presence of asymmetry in three young\nPNe (IRAS 15534-5422, IRAS 17009-4154, and IRAS 18454+0001), where the\nasymmetries can be associated with dusty torii and slightly bipolar outflows.\nThe fourth source (IRAS 18229-1127), a possible post-AGB star, is better\ndescribed as a rhomboidal detached shell. The heavily obscured sources in our\nsample do not show extreme axisymmetric morphologies. This is at odds with the\nexpectation of highly asymmetrical morphologies in post-AGB sources descending\nfrom massive PN progenitors. The sources presented in this paper may be\nsampling critical early phases in the evolution of massive PN progenitors,\nbefore extreme asymmetries develop.\n", "  We consider general hamiltonian systems with quadratic interaction potential\nand $N<\\infty$ degrees of freedom, only $m$ of which have contact with external\nworld, that is subjected to damping and random stationary external forces. We\nshow that, as $t\\to\\infty$, already for $m=1$, the unique limiting distribution\nexists for almost all interactions. Moreover, it is Gibbs if the external force\nis the white noise, but typically not Gibbs for gaussian processes with smooth\ntrajectories. This conclusion survives also in the thermodynamic limit\n$N\\to\\infty$.\n", "  We seek to identify the primary agents causing Forbush decreases (FDs)\nobserved at the Earth in high rigidity cosmic rays. In particular, we ask if\nsuch FDs are caused mainly by coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from the Sun that\nare directed towards the Earth, or by their associated shocks. We use the muon\ndata at cutoff rigidities ranging from 14 to 24 GV from the GRAPES-3 tracking\nmuon telescope to identify FD events. We select those FD events that have a\nreasonably clean profile, and can be reasonably well associated with an\nEarth-directed CME and its associated shock. We employ two models: one that\nconsiders the CME as the sole cause of the FD (the CME-only model) and one that\nconsiders the shock as the only agent causing the FD (the shock-only model). We\nuse an extensive set of observationally determined parameters for both these\nmodels. The only free parameter in these models is the level of MHD turbulence\nin the sheath region, which mediates cosmic ray diffusion (into the CME, for\nthe CME-only model and across the shock sheath, for the shock-only model).\n  We find that good fits to the GRAPES-3 multi-rigidity data using the CME-only\nmodel require turbulence levels in the CME sheath region that are only slightly\nhigher than those estimated for the quiet solar wind. On the other hand,\nreasonable model fits with the shock-only model require turbulence levels in\nthe sheath region that are an order of magnitude higher than those in the quiet\nsolar wind.\n  This observation naturally leads to the conclusion that the Earth-directed\nCMEs are the primary contributors to FDs observed in high rigidity cosmic rays.\n", "  Organic scintillators are often chosen as radiation detectors for their fast\ndecay time and their low Z, while inorganic ones are used when high light ields\nare required. In this paper we show that a para-terphenyl based detector has a\nblend of properties of the two categories that can be optimal for energy and\nposition measurements of low energy charged particles. On 0.1%\ndiphenylbutadiene doped para-terphenyl samples we measure a light yield\n3.5+-0.2 times larger than a typical organic scintillator (EJ-200), and a\nrejection power for 660 keV photons, with respect to electrons of the same\nenergy, ranging between 3-11%, depending on the signal threshold. We also\nmeasure a light attenuation length = 4.73+-0.06 mm and we demonstrate that,\nwith the measurements performed in this paper, a simulation based on FLUKA can\nproperly reproduce the measured spectra.\n", "  For a scattering problem of tight-binding Bloch electrons by a weak random\nsurface potential, a generalized Levinson theorem is put forward showing the\nequality of the total density of surface states and the density of the total\ntime delay. The proof uses explicit formulas for the wave operators in the new\nrescaled energy and interaction (REI) representation, as well as an index\ntheorem for adequate associated operator algebras.\n", "  We present the results of atomistic and ab initio simulation of several\ndifferent tilt grain boundaries (GB) in silicon. The boundary structures\nobtained with genetic algorithm turned out to have no coordination defects,\ni.e. all silicon atoms restored their tetrahedral coordination during the\nstructure optimisation. That concerns previously known symmetric {\\Sigma} 5\n(130), {\\Sigma} 3 (211) and {\\Sigma} 29 (520) boundaries as well as previously\nunknown asymmetric {\\Sigma} 9 (-255)/(-211), {\\Sigma} 3 (-255)/(211) and\n{\\Sigma} 13 (790)/(3 11 0) structures. We have performed an extensive study of\ndefect segregation on the boundaries, including neutral vacancy and carbon,\nphosphorus and boron impurities. A clear correlation between the segregation\nenergy of the defect and local geometry of the boundary site where the defect\nis segregated has been revealed. We suggest a simple purely geometric model for\nevaluation of approximate segregation energies of the listed defects.\n", "  PIXELATED geiger-mode avalanche photodiodes(PPDs), often called silicon\nphotomultipliers (SiPMs) are emerging as an excellent replacement for\ntraditional photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) in a variety of detectors, especially\nthose for subatomic physics experiments, which requires extensive test and\noperation procedures in order to achieve uniform responses from all the\ndevices. In this paper, we show for two PPD brands, Hamamatsu MPPC and SensL\nSPM, that the dark noise rate, breakdown voltage and rate of correlated\navalanches can be inferred from the sole measure of dark current as a function\nof operating voltage, hence greatly simplifying the characterization procedure.\nWe introduce a custom electronics system that allows measurement for many\ndevices concurrently, hence allowing rapid testing and monitoring of many\ndevices at low cost. Finally, we show that the dark current of Hamamastu\nMulti-Pixel Photon Counter (MPPC) is rather independent of temperature at\nconstant operating voltage, hence the current measure cannot be used to probe\ntemperature variations. On the other hand, the MPPC current can be used to\nmonitor light source conditions in DC mode without requiring strong temperature\nstability, as long as the integrated source brightness is comparable to the\ndark noise rate.\n", "  Using the orbit method we attempt to reveal geometric and algebraic meaning\nof separation of variables for the integrable systems on coadjoint orbits in an\n$\\mathfrak{sl}(3)$ loop algebra. We consider two types of generic orbits\nembedded into a common manifold, endowed with two nonsingular Lie-Poisson\nbrackets. We prove that separation of variables on orbits of both types is\nrealized by the same variables of separation. We also construct the integrable\nsystems on these orbits: a coupled 3-component nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequation and an isotropic SU(3) Landau-Lifshitz equation.\n", "  We consider the integrable system of isotropic SU(3) Landau-Lifshits equation\nas a Hamiltonian system on a coadjoint orbit of the SU(3) loop group. We\nconnect the mentioned equation with an isotropic SU(3) magnet because it\ndescribes the mean fields of magnetic and quadrupole moments in a spin-1\nlattice. For the system of isotropic SU(3) Landau-Lifshits equation we perform\nseparation of variables in Sklyanin's manner, and integrate in the lowest\nfinite gap where the spectral curve is elliptic.\n", "  We study collisions of moving nonlinear-Schr\\\"{o}dinger solitons with a\n$\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric dipole embedded into the one-dimensional self-focusing\nor defocusing medium. Accurate analytical results are produced for bright\nsolitons, and, in a more qualitative form, for dark ones. In the former case,\nan essential aspect of the approximation is that it must take into regard the\nintrinsic chirp of the soliton, thus going beyond the framework of the simplest\nquasi-particle description of the soliton's dynamics. Critical velocities\nseparating reflection and transmission of the incident bright solitons are\nfound by means of numerical simulations, and in the approximate semi-analytical\nform. An exact solution for the dark soliton pinned by the complex\n$\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric dipole is produced too.\n", "  Rectangular matrix solutions of the defocusing nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger\nequation (dNLS) are considered on a semi-strip. Evolution of the corresponding\nWeyl function is described in terms of the initial-boundary conditions. Then\ninitial condition is recovered from the boundary conditions. Thus, solutions of\ndNLS are recovered from the boundary conditions.\n", "  In this paper, we considered new solutions for four-dimensional\nasymptotically AdS black holes with scalar hair and discuss about Hawking\ntemperature in the context of dark energy by using the tunneling method. We\nobtain modification of the Hawking temperature due to presence of the dark\nenergy.\n", "  We consider a hamiltonian system on the real line, consisting of real scalar\nfield $\\phi(x,t)$ and point particle with trajectory $y(t)$. The dynamics of\nthis system is defined by the system of two equations: wave equation for the\nfield, <<radiated>> by the point particle, and Newton's equation for the\nparticle in its own field. We find the solution where the particle is strongly\ndamped, but the kinetic and interaction energies of the field increase linearly\nin time, in despite of the full energy conservation.\n", "  When a flux quantum is pushed through a gapped two-dimensional tight-binding\noperator, there is an associated spectral flow through the gap which is shown\nto be equal to the index of a Fredholm operator encoding the topology of the\nFermi projection. This is a natural mathematical formulation of Laughlin's\nGedankenexperiment. It is used to provide yet another proof of the bulk-edge\ncorrespondence. Furthermore, when applied to systems with time reversal\nsymmetry, the spectral flow has a characteristic $Z_2$ signature, while for\nparticle-hole symmetric systems it leads to a criterion for the existence of\nzero energy modes attached to half-flux tubes. Combined with other results,\nthis allows to explain all strong invariants of two-dimensional topological\ninsulators in terms of a single Fredholm operator.\n", "  We report an experimental demonstration of a nonclassical imaging mechanism\nwith super-resolving power beyond the Rayleigh limit. When the classical image\nis completely blurred out due to the use of a small imaging lens, by taking\nadvantage of the intensity fluctuation correlation of thermal light, the\ndemonstrated camera recovered the image of the resolution testing gauge. This\nmethod could be adapted to long distance imaging, such as satellite imaging,\nwhich requires large diameter camera lenses to achieve high image resolution.\n", "  We consider configurations of $N$ charged particles on the interval with\nnearest neighbour Coulomb interaction and constant external force. For\ndifferent values of external force we find 4 different phases of the asymptotic\nparticle density for the configuration corresponding to the minimum of the\nenergy.\n", "  More than 50 years after the dawn of X-ray astronomy, the dynamical\nparameters of the prototypical X-ray binary Sco X-1 are still unknown. We\ncombine a Monte Carlo analysis, which includes all the previously known orbital\nparameters of the system, along with the K-correction to set dynamical\nconstraints to the masses of the compact object (M1<1.73 Msun) and the\ncompanion star (0.28 Msun<M2<0.70 Msun). For the case of a canonical neutron\nstar mass of M1= 1.4 Msun, the orbital inclination is found to be lower than 40\ndegree. We also present the best near-infrared spectrum of the source to date.\nThere is no evidence of donor star features on it, but we are able to constrain\nthe veiling factor as a function of the spectral type of the secondary star.\nThe combination of both techniques restricts the spectral type of the donor to\nbe later than K4 and luminosity class IV. It also constrains the contribution\nof the companion light to the infrared emission of Sco X-1 to be lower than 33\npercent. This implies that the accretion related luminosity of the system in\nthe K band is larger than 4 x 10E35 erg/s.\n", "  We obtain the Misner-Sharp mass in the massive gravity for a four dimensional\nspacetime with a two dimensional maximally symmetric subspace via the inverse\nunified first law method. Significantly, the stress energy is conserved in this\ncase with a widely used reference metric. Based on this property we confirm the\nderived Misner-Sharp mass by the conserved charge method. We find that the\nexistence of the Misner-sharp mass in this case does not lead to extra\nconstraint for the massive gravity, which is notable in modified gravities. In\naddition, as a special case, we also investigate the Misner-Sharp mass in the\nstatic spacetime. Especially, we take the FRW universe into account for\ninvestigating the thermodynamics of the massive gravity. The result shows that\nthe massive gravity can be in thermodynamic equilibrium, which fills in the gap\nin the previous studies of thermodynamics in the massive gravity.\n", "  We find a B\\\"acklund transformation between 4-dimensional Mart\\'{\\i}nez\nAlonso -- Shabat and Ferapontov -- Khusnutdinova equations.\n", "  Light beams can be symmetric under different transformations: translations,\nrotations, mirror symmetries, duality transformations, etc. In this thesis, a\nsystematic way of characterizing these symmetries is presented. Then, it is\nshown that light beams symmetric under different transformations can be used to\ncontrol light-matter interactions at the nano-scale. Particular applications\nare developed, both theoretically and experimentally. Inducing a dual behaviour\non a non-dual sample, the excitation of high multipolar order resonances and\nthe measurement of circular dichroism using vortex beams are among them.\n", "  We study inverse scattering problems at a fixed energy for radial\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger operators on $\\R^n$, $n \\geq 2$. First, we consider the class\n$\\mathcal{A}$ of potentials $q(r)$ which can be extended analytically in $\\Re z\n\\geq 0$ such that $\\mid q(z)\\mid \\leq C \\ (1+ \\mid z \\mid )^{-\\rho}$, $\\rho\n\\textgreater{} \\frac{3}{2}$. If $q$ and $\\tilde{q}$ are two such potentials and\nif the corresponding phase shifts $\\delta\\_l$ and $\\tilde{\\delta}\\_l$ are\nsuper-exponentially close, then $q=\\tilde{q}$. Secondly, we study the class of\npotentials $q(r)$ which can be split into $q(r)=q\\_1(r) + q\\_2(r)$ such that\n$q\\_1(r)$ has compact support and $q\\_2 (r) \\in \\mathcal{A}$. If $q$ and\n$\\tilde{q}$ are two such potentials, we show that for any fixed\n$a\\textgreater{}0$, ${\\ds{\\delta\\_l - \\tilde{\\delta}\\_l \\ = \\ o \\left(\n\\frac{1}{l^{n-3}} \\ \\left( {\\frac{ae}{2l}}\\right)^{2l}\\right)}}$ when $l\n\\rightarrow +\\infty$ if and only if $q(r)=\\tilde{q}(r)$ for almost all $r \\geq\na$. The proofs are close in spirit with the celebrated Borg-Marchenko\nuniqueness theorem, and rely heavily on the localization of the Regge poles\nthat could be defined as the resonances in the complexified angular momentum\nplane. We show that for a non-zero super-exponentially decreasing potential,\nthe number of Regge poles is always infinite and moreover, the Regge poles are\nnot contained in any vertical strip in the right-half plane. For potentials\nwith compact support, we are able to give explicitly their asymptotics. At\nlast, for potentials which can be extended analytically in $\\Re z \\geq 0$ with\n$\\mid q(z)\\mid \\leq C \\ (1+ \\mid z \\mid )^{-\\rho}$, $\\rho \\textgreater{}1$ , we\nshow that the Regge poles are confined in a vertical strip in the complex\nplane.\n", "  We have shown in previous work that the rigorous equivalence of the\nSchr\\\"odinger and Heisenberg pictures requires that one uses Born-Jordan\nquantization in place of Weyl quantization. It also turns out that the\nso-called Dahl-Springborg angular momentum dilemma disappears if one uses\nBorn--Jordan quantization. These two facts strongly suggest that the latter is\nthe only true quantization procedure, and this leads to a redefinition of phase\nspace quantum mechanics, where the usual Wigner distribution has to be replaced\nwith a new distribution.\n", "  Nonlinear localized magnetic excitations in one dimensional magnonic crystal\nis investigated under periodic magntic field. The governing Landau-Lifshitz\nequation is transformed into variable coefficient nonlinear Schrodinger\nequation(VCNLS) using sterographic projection. The VCNLS equation is in general\nnonintegrable, by using painleve analysis necessary conditions for the VCNLS\nequation to pass Weiss-Tabor-Carnevale (WTC) Painleve test are obtained. A\nsufficient integrability condition is obtained by further exploring a\ntransformation, which can map the VCNLS equation into the well-known standard\nnonlinear Schrodinger equation. The transformation built a systematic\nconnection between the solution of the standard nonlinear Schrodinger equation\nand VC-NLS equation. The results shows the excitation of magnetization in the\nform of soliton has spatialperiod exists on the background of spin Bloch waves.\nSuch solution exisits only certain constrain conditions on the coefficient of\nthe VCNLS equation are satisfied. The analytical results suggest a way to\ncontrol the dynamics of magnetization in the form of solitons by an appropriate\nspatial modulation of the nonlinearity coefficient in the governing VCNLS\nequation which is determined by the ferromagnetic materials which forms the\nmagnonic crystal.\n", "  Our exact theory for continuous harmonic perturbation of a one dimensional\nmodel atom by parametric variations of its potential is generalized for the\ncases when a) the atom is exposed to short pulses of an external harmonic\nelectric field and b) the forcing is represented by short bursts of different\nshape changing the strength of the binding potential. This work is motivated\nnot only by the wide use of laser pulses for atomic ionization, but also by our\nearlier study of the same model which successfully described the ionization\ndynamics in all orders, i.e. the multi-photon processes, though being treated\nby the non-relativistic Schr\\\"odinger equation. In particular, it was shown\nthat the bound atom cannot survive the excitation of its potential caused by\nany non-zero frequency and amplitude of the continuous harmonic forcing. Our\npresent analysis found important laws of the atomic ionization by short pulses,\nin particular the efficiency of ionizing this model system and presumably real\nones as well.\n", "  We describe general constraints on the elliptic genus of a 2d supersymmetric\nconformal field theory which has a gravity dual with large radius in Planck\nunits. We give examples of theories which do and do not satisfy the bounds we\nderive, by describing the elliptic genera of symmetric product orbifolds of\n$K3$, product manifolds, certain simple families of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces,\nand symmetric products of the \"Monster CFT.\" We discuss the distinction between\ntheories with supergravity duals and those whose duals have strings at the\nscale set by the AdS curvature. Under natural assumptions we attempt to\nquantify the fraction of (2,2) supersymmetric conformal theories which admit a\nweakly curved gravity description, at large central charge.\n", "  As a quantum device, a quantum heat engine (QHE) is described by a Hermitian\nHamiltonian.However, since it is an open system, reservoirs have to be imposed\nphenomenologically without any description in the context of quantum mechanics.\nA non-Hermitian system is expected to describe an open system which exchanges\nenergy and particles with external reservoirs. Correspondingly,such an exchange\ncan be adiabatic in the context of quantum mechanics. We first propose a\nnon-Hermitian QHE by a concrete simple two-level system, which is an S = 1/2\nspin in a complex external magnetic field. The non-Hermitian PT -symmetric\nHamiltonian, as a self-contained one,describes both working medium and\nreservoirs. A heat-engine cycle is composed of completely quantum adiabatic\nprocesses. Surprisingly, the heat efficiency is obtained to be the same as that\nof Hermitian quantum Otto cycle. A classical analogue of this scheme is also\npresented. Our finding paves the way for revealing what the role of a\nnon-Hermitian Hamiltonian plays in physics.\n", "  We present quantum holonomy theory, which is a non-perturbative theory of\nquantum gravity coupled to fermionic degrees of freedom. The theory is based on\na C*-algebra that involves holonomy-diffeomorphisms on a 3-dimensional manifold\nand which encodes the canonical commutation relations of canonical quantum\ngravity formulated in terms of Ashtekar variables. Employing a Dirac type\noperator on the configuration space of Ashtekar connections we obtain a\nsemi-classical state and a kinematical Hilbert space via its GNS construction.\nWe use the Dirac type operator, which provides a metric structure over the\nspace of Ashtekar connections, to define a scalar curvature operator, from\nwhich we obtain a candidate for a Hamilton operator. We show that the classical\nHamilton constraint of general relativity emerges from this in a semi-classical\nlimit and we then compute the operator constraint algebra. Also, we find states\nin the kinematical Hilbert space on which the expectation value of the Dirac\ntype operator gives the Dirac Hamiltonian in a semi-classical limit and thus\nprovides a connection to fermionic quantum field theory. Finally, an\nalmost-commutative algebra emerges from the holonomy-diffeomorphism algebra in\nthe same limit.\n", "  The quantization of mirror curves to toric Calabi--Yau threefolds leads to\ntrace class operators, and it has been conjectured that the spectral properties\nof these operators provide a non-perturbative realization of topological string\ntheory on these backgrounds. In this paper, we find an explicit form for the\nintegral kernel of the trace class operator in the case of local P1xP1, in\nterms of Faddeev's quantum dilogarithm. The matrix model associated to this\nintegral kernel is an O(2) model, which generalizes the ABJ(M) matrix model. We\nfind its exact planar limit, and we provide detailed evidence that its 1/N\nexpansion captures the all genus topological string free energy on local P1xP1.\n", "  We analyse the effects of Robin boundary conditions on quantum field theories\nof spin 0, 1 and 1/2. In particular, we show that these conditions always lead\nto the appearance of edge states that play a significant role in quantum Hall\neffect and topological insulators. We prove in a rigorous way the existence of\nspectral lower bounds on the kinetic term of the Hamiltonian, which guarantees\nthe stability and consistency of massive field theories when the mass is larger\nthan the lower bound of the kinetic term. We also find an upper bound for the\ndeepest edge state. The explicit dependence of both bounds on the boundary\nconditions and the size of the system is derived under very general conditions.\nFor fermionic systems we analyse the case of Atiyah-Patodi-Singer and chiral\nbag boundary conditions. We point out the existence of edge states also in\nthese cases and show that they disappear for small enough systems. Stability is\ngranted in this case.\n", "  This article studies the planar Potts model and its random-cluster\nrepresentation. We show that the phase transition of the nearest-neighbor\nferromagnetic $q$-state Potts model on $\\mathbb Z^2$ is continuous for\n$q\\in\\{2,3,4\\}$, in the sense that there exists a unique Gibbs state, or\nequivalently that there is no ordering for the critical Gibbs states with\nmonochromatic boundary conditions. The proof uses the random-cluster model with\ncluster-weight $q\\ge1$ (note that $q$ is not necessarily an integer) and is\nbased on two ingredients:\n  1. The fact that the two-point function for the free state decays\nsub-exponentially fast for cluster-weights $1\\le q\\le 4$, which is derived\nstudying parafermionic observables on a discrete Riemann surface.\n  2. A new result proving the equivalence of several properties of critical\nrandom-cluster models:\n  - the absence of infinite-cluster for wired boundary conditions,\n  - the uniqueness of infinite-volume measures,\n  - the sub-exponential decay of the two-point function for free boundary\nconditions,\n  - a Russo-Seymour-Welsh type result on crossing probabilities in rectangles\nwith arbitrary boundary conditions.\n  The result leads to a number of consequences concerning the scaling limit of\nthe random-cluster model with $1\\le q \\le 4$. It shows that the family of\ninterfaces (for instance for Dobrushin boundary conditions) are tight when\ntaking the scaling limit and that any sub-sequential limit can be parametrized\nby a Loewner chain. We also study the effect of boundary conditions on these\nsub-sequential limits. Let us mention that the result should be instrumental in\nthe study of critical exponents as well.\n", "  We consider the strong field asymptotics for the occurrence of zero modes of\ncertain Weyl-Dirac operators on $\\mathbb{R}^3$. In particular we are interested\nin those operators $\\mathcal{D}_{B}$ for which the associated magnetic field\n$B$ is given by pulling back a $2$-form $\\beta$ from the sphere $\\mathbb{S}^2$\nto $\\mathbb{R}^3$ using a combination of the Hopf fibration and inverse\nstereographic projection. If $\\int_{\\mathbb{S}^2}\\beta\\neq0$ we show that \\[\n\\sum_{0\\le t\\le T}\\mathrm{dim}\\,\\mathrm{Ker}\\,\\mathcal{D}_{tB}\n=\\frac{T^2}{8\\pi^2}\\,\\biggl\\lvert\\int_{\\mathbb{S}^2}\\beta\\biggr\\rvert\\,\\int_{\\mathbb{S}^2}\\lvert{\\beta}\\rvert+o(T^2)\n\\] as $T\\to+\\infty$. The result relies on Erd\\H{o}s and Solovej's\ncharacterisation of the spectrum of $\\mathcal{D}_{tB}$ in terms of a family of\nDirac operators on $\\mathbb{S}^2$, together with information about the strong\nfield localisation of the Aharonov-Casher zero modes of the latter.\n", "  Metamaterials offer a powerful way to manipulate a variety of physical fields\nranging from wave fields (electromagnetic field, acoustic field, elastic wave,\netc.), static fields (static magnetic field, static electric field) to\ndiffusive fields (thermal field, diffusive mass). However, the relevant reports\nand studies are usually conducted on a single physical field or functionality.\nIn this study, we proposed and experimentally demonstrated a bifunctional\nmetamaterial which can manipulate thermal and electric fields simultaneously\nand independently. Specifically, a composite with independently controllable\nthermal and electric conductivity was introduced, on the basis of which a\nbifunctional device capable of shielding thermal flux and concentrating\nelectric current simultaneously was designed, fabricated and characterized.\nThis work provides an encouraging example of metamaterials transcending their\nnatural limitations, which offers a promising future in building a broad\nplatform for manipulation of multi-physics field.\n", "  We analyze spin-0 relativistic scattering of charged particles propagating in\nthe exterior, $\\Lambda \\subset \\mathbb{R}^3$, of a compact obstacle $K \\subset\n\\mathbb{R}^3$. The connected components of the obstacle are handlebodies. The\nparticles interact with an electro-magnetic field in $\\Lambda$ and an\ninaccessible magnetic field localized in the interior of the obstacle (through\nthe Aharonov-Bohm effect). We obtain high-momenta estimates, with error bounds,\nfor the scattering operator that we use to recover physical information: We\ngive a reconstruction method for the electric potential and the exterior\nmagnetic field and prove that, if the electric potential vanishes, circulations\nof the magnetic potential around handles (or equivalently, by Stokes' theorem,\nmagnetic fluxes over transverse sections of handles) of the obstacle can be\nrecovered, modulo $2 \\pi$. We additionally give a simple formula for the\nhigh-momenta limit of the scattering operator in terms of certain magnetic\nfluxes, in the absence of electric potential. If the electric potential does\nnot vanish, the magnetic fluxes on the handles above referred can be only\nrecovered modulo $\\pi$ and the simple expression of the high-momenta limit of\nthe scattering operator does not hold true.\n", "  Traveling wave solutions of degenerate coupled $\\ell$-KdV equations are\nstudied. Due to symmetry reduction these equations reduce to one ODE,\n$(f')^2=P_n(f)$ where $P_n(f)$ is a polynomial function of $f$ of degree\n$n=\\ell+2$, where $\\ell \\geq 3$ in this work. Here $\\ell$ is the number of\ncoupled fields. There is no known method to solve such ordinary differential\nequations when $\\ell \\geq 3$. For this purpose, we introduce two different type\nof methods to solve the reduced equation and apply these methods to degenerate\nthree-coupled KdV equation. One of the methods uses the Chebyshev's Theorem. In\nthis case we find several solutions some of which may correspond to solitary\nwaves. The second method is a kind of factorizing the polynomial $P_n(f)$ as a\nproduct of lower degree polynomials. Each part of this product is assumed to\nsatisfy different ODEs.\n", "  The speed of light in the global positioning system (GPS) is theoretically\ninvestigated through the analysis of navigation equations together with metric\ntensors for light speed constancy.\n", "  We explore quantum signatures of classical chaos by studying the rate of\ninformation gain in quantum tomography. The tomographic record consists of a\ntime series of expectation values of a Hermitian operator evolving under\napplication of the Floquet operator of a quantum map that possesses (or lacks)\ntime reversal symmetry. We find that the rate of information gain, and hence\nthe fidelity of quantum state reconstruction, depends on the symmetry class of\nthe quantum map involved. Moreover, we find an increase in information gain and\nhence higher reconstruction fidelities when the Floquet maps employed increase\nin chaoticity. We make predictions for the information gain and show that these\nresults are well described by random matrix theory in the fully chaotic regime.\nWe derive analytical expressions for bounds on information gain using random\nmatrix theory for different class of maps and show that these bounds are\nrealized by fully chaotic quantum systems.\n", "  We investigate the interaction of tin alloying with tensile strain and n-type\ndoping for improving the performance of a Ge-based laser for on-chip optical\ninterconnects. Using a modified tight-binding formalism that incorporates the\neffect of tin alloying on conduction band changes, we calculate how threshold\ncurrent density and slope efficiency are affected by tin alloying in the\npresence of tensile strain and n-type doping. Our results show that while there\nexists a negative interaction between tin alloying and n-type doping, tensile\nstrain can be effectively combined with tin alloying to dramatically improve\nthe Ge gain medium in terms of both reducing the threshold and increasing the\nexpected slope efficiency. Through quantitative modeling we find the best\ndesign to include large amounts of both tin alloying and tensile strain but\nonly moderate amounts of n-type doping if researchers seek to achieve the best\npossible performance in a Ge-based laser.\n", "  In this paper, we propose a new approach to calculate multi-soliton solutions\nof Camassa-Holm (CH) equation and modified Camassa-Holm (MCH) equation with aid\nof Darboux transformation (DT). The new approach simplifies the approach\npresented in {\\it Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A} {\\bf 460} 2617-2627 (2004). We first\nmap the CH and MCH equation to a negative order KdV (NKdV) equation by a\nreciprocal transformation. Then we proceed to apply the DT to solve the NKdV\nequation in the usual way. Finally we invert the reciprocal transformation to\nrecover the solutions of the CH equation and MCH equation.\n", "  The sub-cycle dynamics of electrons driven by strong laser fields is central\nto the emerging field of attosecond science. We demonstrate how the dynamics\ncan be probed through high-order harmonic generation, where different\ntrajectories leading to the same harmonic order are initiated at different\ntimes, thereby probing different field strengths. We find large differences\nbetween the trajectories with respect to both their sensitivity to driving\nfield ellipticity and resonant enhancement. To accurately describe the\nellipticity dependence of the long trajectory harmonics we must include a\nsub-cycle change of the initial velocity distribution of the electron and its\nexcursion time. The resonant enhancement is observed only for the long\ntrajectory contribution of a particular harmonic when a window resonance in\nargon, which is off-resonant in the field-free case, is shifted into resonance\ndue to a large dynamic Stark shift.\n", "  We establish simple connections between response functions of the dynamical\nDirac systems and $A$-amplitudes and Weyl functions of the spectral Dirac\nsystems. Using these connections we propose a new and rigorous procedure to\nrecover a general-type dynamical Dirac system from its response function as\nwell as a procedure to construct explicit solutions of this problem.\n", "  Using the Lax representation with non-removable parameter, we construct two\nhierarchies of nonlocal conservation laws for the 3D rdDym equation $u_{ty} =\nu_xu_{xy} - u_yu_{xx}$ and describe the algebras of nonlocal symmetries in the\ncorresponding coverings.\n", "  We present quantum mechanical calculations of Auger decay rates for two\nRubidium Rydberg atoms with weakly overlapping electron clouds. We neglect\nexchange effects and consider tensor products of independent atom states\nforming an approximate basis of the two-electron state space. We consider large\nsets of two-atom states with randomly chosen quantum numbers and find that the\ncharge overlap between the two Rydberg electrons allows one to characterise the\nmagnitude of the Auger decay rates. If the electron clouds overlap by more than\none percent, the Auger decay rates increase approximately exponentially with\nthe charge overlap. This finding is independent of the energy of the initial\nstate.\n", "  We explore gravitating relativistic spheres composed of an anisotropic,\nbarotropic uid. We assume a bi-polytropic equation of state which has a linear\nand a power-law terms. The generalized Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV)\nequation which describes the hydrostatic equilibrium is obtained. The full\nsystem of equations are solved for solutions which are regular at the origin\nand asymptotically flat. Conditions for the appearance of horizon and a basic\ntreatment of stability are also discussed.\n", "  Recently, S.W. Kahler studied the solar energetic particle (SEP) event\ntimescales associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from spacecraft data\nanalysis. They obtained different timescales of SEP events, such as TO, the\nonset time from CME launch to SEP onset, TR, the rise time from onset to half\nthe peak intensity (0.5Ip), and TD, the duration of the SEP intensity above\n0.5Ip. In this work, we solve SEPs transport equation considering ICME shocks\nas energetic particle sources. With our modeling assumptions, our simulations\nshow similar results to Kahler's spacecraft data analysis that the weighted\naverage of TD increases with both CME speed and width. Besides, from our\nsimulation results, we suggest TD is directly dependent on CME speed, but not\ndependent on CME width, which were not achieved from the observation data\nanalysis.\n", "  This review is dedicated to some recent results on Weyl theory, inverse\nproblems, evolution of the Weyl functions and applications to integrable wave\nequations in a semistrip and quarter-plane. For overdetermined initial-boundary\nvalue problems, we consider some approaches, which help to reduce the number of\nthe initial-boundary conditions. The interconnections between dynamical and\nspectral Dirac systems, between response and Weyl functions are studied as\nwell.\n", "  We consider the effectiveness of foreground cleaning in the recovery of\nCosmic Microwave Background (CMB) polarization sourced by gravitational waves\nfor tensor-to-scalar ratios in the range $0<r<0.1$. Using the planned survey\narea, frequency bands, and sensitivity of the Cosmology Large Angular Scale\nSurveyor (CLASS), we simulate maps of Stokes $Q$ and $U$ parameters at 40, 90,\n150, and 220 GHz, including realistic models of the CMB, diffuse Galactic\nthermal dust and synchrotron foregrounds, and Gaussian white noise. We use\nlinear combinations (LCs) of the simulated multifrequency data to obtain\nmaximum likelihood estimates of $r$, the relative scalar amplitude $s$, and LC\ncoefficients. We find that for 10,000 simulations of a CLASS-like experiment\nusing only measurements of the reionization peak ($\\ell\\leq23$), there is a 95%\nC.L. upper limit of $r<0.017$ in the case of no primordial gravitational waves.\nFor simulations with $r=0.01$, we recover at 68% C.L.\n$r=0.012^{+0.011}_{-0.006}$. The reionization peak corresponds to a fraction of\nthe multipole moments probed by CLASS, and simulations including\n$30\\leq\\ell\\leq100$ further improve our upper limits to $r<0.008$ at 95% C.L.\n($r=0.01^{+0.004}_{-0.004}$ for primordial gravitational waves with $r=0.01$).\nIn addition to decreasing the current upper bound on $r$ by an order of\nmagnitude, these foreground-cleaned low multipole data will achieve a cosmic\nvariance limited measurement of the E-mode polarization's reionization peak.\n", "  General considerations in general relativity and quantum mechanics are known\nto potentially rule out continuous global symmetries in the context of any\nconsistent theory of quantum gravity. Assuming the validity of such\nconsiderations, we derive stringent bounds from gamma-ray, X-ray, cosmic-ray,\nneutrino, and CMB data on models that invoke global symmetries to stabilize the\ndark matter particle. We compute up-to-date, robust model-independent limits on\nthe dark matter lifetime for a variety of Planck-scale suppressed\ndimension-five effective operators. We then specialize our analysis and apply\nour bounds to specific models including the Two-Higgs-Doublet, Left-Right,\nSinglet Fermionic, Zee-Babu, 3-3-1 and Radiative See-Saw models. {Assuming that\n(i) global symmetries are broken at the Planck scale, that (ii) the\nnon-renormalizable operators mediating dark matter decay have $O(1)$ couplings,\nthat (iii) the dark matter is a singlet field, and that (iv) the dark matter\ndensity distribution is well described by a NFW profile}, we are able to rule\nout fermionic, vector, and scalar dark matter candidates across a broad mass\nrange (keV-TeV), including the WIMP regime.\n", "  We compare the standard 50%-efficient single beam splitter method for\nBell-state measurement to a proposed 75%-efficient auxiliary-photon-enhanced\nscheme [W. P. Grice, Phys. Rev. A 84, 042331 (2011)] in light of realistic\nconditions. The two schemes are compared with consideration for high input\nstate photon loss, auxiliary state photon loss, detector inefficiency and\ncoupling loss, detector dark counts, and non-number-resolving detectors. We\nalso analyze the two schemes when multiplexed arrays of non-number-resolving\ndetectors are used. Furthermore, we explore the possibility of utilizing\nspontaneous parametric down-conversion as the auxiliary photon pair source\nrequired by the enhanced scheme. In these different cases, we determine the\nbounds on the detector parameters at which the enhanced scheme becomes superior\nto the standard scheme and describe the impact of the different imperfections\non measurement success rate and discrimination fidelity. This is done using a\ncombination of numeric and analytic techniques. For many of the cases\ndiscussed, the size of the Hilbert space and the number of measurement outcomes\ncan be very large, which makes direct numerical solutions computationally\ncostly. To alleviate this problem, all of our numerical computations are\nperformed using pure states. This requires tracking the loss modes until\nmeasurement and treating dark counts as variations on measurement outcomes\nrather than modifications to the state itself. In addition, we provide\napproximate analytic expressions that illustrate the effect of different\nimperfections on the Bell-state analyzer quality.\n", "  Euler's equations for a two-dimensional system can be written in Hamiltonian\nform, where the Poisson bracket is the Lie-Poisson bracket associated to the\nLie algebra of divergence free vector fields. We show how to derive the Poisson\nbrackets of 2d hydrodynamics of ideal fluids as a reduction from the one\nassociated to the full algebra of vector fields. Motivated by some recent\nresults about the deformations of Lie-Poisson brackets of vector fields, we\nstudy the dispersive deformations of the Poisson brackets of Euler's equation\nand show that, up to the second order, they are trivial.\n", "  We examine transient axial creeping flow in the annular gap between a rigid\ncylinder and a concentric elastic tube. The gap is initially filled with a thin\nfluid layer. The study focuses on viscous-elastic time-scales for which the\nrate of solid deformation is of the same order-of-magnitude as the velocity of\nthe fluid. We employ an elastic shell model and the lubrication approximation\nto obtain a forced nonlinear diffusion equation governing the viscous-elastic\ninteraction. In the case of an advancing liquid front into a configuration with\na negligible film layer (compared with the radial deformation of the elastic\ntube), the governing equation degenerates into a forced porous medium equation,\nfor which several closed-form solutions are presented. In the case where the\ninitial film layer is non-negligible, self-similarity is used to devise\npropagation laws for a pressure driven liquid front. When advancing external\nforces are applied on the tube, the formation of dipole structures is shown to\ndominate the initial stages of the induced flow and deformation regimes. These\nare variants of the dipole solution of the porous medium equation. Finally,\nsince the rate of pressure propagation decreases with the height of the liquid\nfilm, we show that isolated moving deformation patterns can be created and\nsuperimposed to generate a moving wave-like deformation field. The presented\ninteraction between viscosity and elasticity may be applied to fields such as\nsoft-robotics and micro-scale or larger swimmers by allowing for the\ntime-dependent control of an axisymmetric compliant boundary.\n", "  We develop a framework that facilitates the study of the causal structure of\nspacetimes with a causally preferred foliation. Such spacetimes may arise as\nsolutions of Lorentz-violating theories, e.g. Horava gravity. Our framework\nallows us to rigorously define concepts such as black/white holes and to\nformalize the notion of a `universal horizon', that has been previously\nintroduced in the simpler setting of static and spherically symmetric\ngeometries. We also touch upon the issue of development and prove that\nuniversal horizons are Cauchy horizons when evolution depends on boundary data\nor asymptotic conditions. We establish a local characterisation of universal\nhorizons in stationary configurations. Finally, under the additional assumption\nof axisymmetry, we examine under which conditions these horizons are cloaked by\nKilling horizons, which can act like usual event horizons for low-energy\nexcitations.\n", "  The existence of inequivalent valleys K and K' in the momentum space of\ntwo-dimensional hexagonal lattices provides a new electronic degree of freedom,\nthe manipulation of which can potentially lead to new types of electronics, in\nanalogy to the role played by electron spin. In materials with broken inversion\nsymmetry, such as an electrically gated bilayer graphene, the momentum-space\nBerry curvature $\\Omega$ carries opposite sign in the K and K' valleys. A sign\nreversal of $\\Omega$ along an internal boundary of the sheet gives rise to\ncounter-propagating one-dimensional conducting modes encoded with opposite\nvalley indices. These metallic states are topologically protected against\nbackscattering in the absence of valley-mixing scattering, and thus can carry\ncurrent ballistically. In bilayer graphene, the reversal of $\\Omega$ can occur\nat the domain wall of AB and BA stacked domains, or at the line junction of two\noppositely gated regions. The latter approach can provide a scalable platform\nto implement valleytronic operations such as valves and waveguides, but is\ntechnically challenging to realize. Here we fabricate a dual-split-gate\nstructure in bilayer graphene and demonstrate transport evidence of the\npredicted metallic states. They possess a mean free path of up to a few hundred\nnanometers in the absence of a magnet field. The application of perpendicular\nmagnetic field suppresses backscattering significantly and enables a\n400-nanometer-long junction to exhibit conductance close to the ballistic limit\nof 4 $e^2/h$ at 8 Tesla. Our experiment paves the path to the realization of\ngate-controlled ballistic valley transport and the development of valleytronic\napplications in atomically thin materials.\n", "  A quantum particle subjected to a constant force undergoes an accelerated\nmotion following a parabolic path, which differs from the classical motion just\nbecause of wave packet spreading (quantum diffusion). However, when a periodic\npotential is added (such as in a crystal) the particle undergoes Bragg\nscattering and an oscillatory (rather than accelerated) motion is found,\ncorresponding to the famous Bloch oscillations. Here we introduce an\nexactly-solvable quantum Hamiltonian model, corresponding to a generalized\nWannier-Stark Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$, in which a quantum particle shows an\nintermediate dynamical behavior, namely an oscillatory motion superimposed to\nan accelerated one. Such a novel dynamical behavior is referred to as {\\it\naccelerated Bloch oscillations}. Analytical expressions of the spectrum,\nimproper eigenfunctions and propagator of the generalized Wannier-Stark\nHamiltonian $\\hat{H}$ are derived. Finally, it is shown that acceleration and\nquantum diffusion in the generalized Wannier-Stark Hamiltonian are prevented\nfor Airy wave packets, which undergo a periodic breathing dynamics that can be\nreferred to as {\\it Airy-Bloch oscillations}.\n", "  We use \\textit{ab initio} calculations to systematically study the phase\ndiagram of multiferroic Sr$_{1-x}$Ba$_x$MnO$_3$ ($0 \\leq x \\leq 1$) as a\nfunction of chemical doping, epitaxial strain and external pressure. We find\nthat by replacing Sr with Ba in cubic SrMnO$_3$ and imposing epitaxial strain,\nthe material can be tuned to the vicinity of a first order transition between\ntwo multiferroic phases, one antiferromagnetic with a smaller polarization and\none ferromagnetic with a larger polarization. A giant effective\nmagneto-electric coupling and cross-field control (electric field control of\nmagnetism or magnetic field control of polarization) can be achieved in the\nvicinity of the transition. The dependence of the theoretically computed\ntransition point on the choice of exchange correlation functionals is\ndetermined and is found to be non-negligible. We also show that the perovskite\nstructure of BaMnO$_3$ can be stabilized relative to its hexagonal polymorphs\nat pressures larger than 20 GPa.\n", "  It will be shown that the comment [1] contains numerous errors,\nmisconceptions, inaccuracies, false assumptions, misunderstandings and\nunjustified claims. The analysis of the comment is built on a false assumption\nthat the terminal current of an antenna fed by a waveguide is independent of\nfrequency. This false assumption arises from the misunderstandings on the basic\ntheory of transmission lines and misconceptions of normalization for a linear\nsystem. As a result, all the equations obtained from the assumption in the\ncomment are incorrect, and the related discussions are untruthful. The delta\ngap source modeling has been abused in the comment, and this is reflected in\nthe numerical results in the comment that give rise to negative stored energy.\nThe main results of the commented paper have been misinterpreted by the authors\nof the comment, and the related analysis is established on illogical reasoning.\nThe comment fails to pinpoint any errors in the commented paper. Instead, it\nreveals that the main results obtained by the authors of the comment in their\nprevious publication [2] are incorrect.\n", "  Robust heteroclinic cycles in equivariant dynamical systems in R^4 have been\na subject of intense scientific investigation because, unlike heteroclinic\ncycles in R^3, they can have an intricate geometric structure and complex\nasymptotic stability properties that are not yet completely understood. In a\nrecent work, we have compiled an exhaustive list of finite subgroups of O(4)\nadmitting the so-called simple heteroclinic cycles, and have identified a new\nclass which we have called pseudo-simple heteroclinic cycles. By contrast with\nsimple heteroclinic cycles, a pseudo-simple one has at least one equilibrium\nwith an unstable manifold which has dimension 2 due to a symmetry. Here, we\nanalyse the dynamics of nearby trajectories and asymptotic stability of\npseudo-simple heteroclinic cycles in R^4.\n", "  We investigate theoretically shear banding in large amplitude oscillatory\nshear (LAOS) of polymers and wormlike micelles. In LAOStrain we find banding at\nlow frequencies and sufficiently high strain rate amplitudes in fluids for\nwhich the underlying constitutive curve of shear stress as a function of shear\nrate is non-monotonic. This is the direct analogue of quasi steady state\nbanding seen in slow strain rate sweeps along the flow curve. At higher\nfrequencies and sufficiently high strain amplitudes we report a different but\nrelated phenomenon, which we call `elastic' shear banding. This is associated\nwith an overshoot in the elastic (Lissajous-Bowditch) curve of stress as a\nfunction of strain. We suggest that this may arise widely even in fluids that\nhave a monotonic underlying constitutive curve, and so do not show steady state\nbanding under a steadily applied shear flow. In LAOStress we report banding in\nfluids that shear thin strongly enough to have either a negatively, or weakly\npositively, sloping region in the underlying constitutive curve, noting again\nthat fluids in the latter category do not display steady state banding in a\nsteadily applied flow. This banding is triggered in each half cycle as the\nstress magnitude transits the region of weak slope in an upward direction, such\nthat the fluid effectively yields. Our numerics are performed in the Rolie-poly\nmodel of polymeric fluids, but we also provide arguments suggesting that our\nresults should apply more widely. Besides banding in the shear rate profile,\nwhich can be measured by velocimetry, we also predict banding in the shear and\nnormal stress components, measurable by birefringence. As a backdrop to\nunderstanding the new results on shear banding in LAOS, we also briefly review\nearlier work on banding in other time-dependent protocols, focusing in\nparticular on shear startup and step stress.\n", "  We have carried out wall-resolved unstructured fully-compressible\nNavier--Stokes simulations of a complete standing-wave thermoacoustic\npiezoelectric (TAP) engine model inspired by the experimental work of Smoker et\nal. (2012). The model is axisymmetric and comprises a 51 cm long resonator\ndivided into two sections: a small diameter section enclosing a thermoacoustic\nstack, and a larger diameter section capped by a piezoelectric diaphragm tuned\nto the thermoacoustically amplified mode (388 Hz). The diaphragm is modelled\nwith multi-oscillator broadband time-domain impedance boundary conditions\n(TDIBCs), providing higher fidelity over single-oscillator approximations.\nSimulations are first carried out to the limit cycle without energy extraction.\nThe observed growth rates are shown to be grid-convergent and are verified\nagainst a numerical dynamical model based on Rott's theory. The latter is based\non a staggered grid approach and allows jump conditions in the derivatives of\npressure and velocity in sections of abrupt area change and the inclusion of\nlinearized minor losses. The stack geometry maximizing the growth rate is also\nfound. At the limit cycle, thermoacoustic heat leakage and frequency shifts are\nobserved, consistent with experiments. Upon activation of the piezoelectric\ndiaphragm, steady acoustic energy extraction and a reduced pressure amplitude\nlimit cycle are obtained. A heuristic closure of the limit cycle acoustic\nenergy budget is presented, supported by the linear dynamical model and the\nnonlinear simulations. The developed high-fidelity simulation framework\nprovides accurate predictions of thermal-to-acoustic and acoustic-to-mechanical\nenergy conversion (via TDIBCs), enabling a new paradigm for the design and\noptimization of advanced thermoacoustic engines.\n", "  Non-geometric flux-scaling vacua provide promising starting points to realize\naxion monodromy inflation via the F-term scalar potential. We show that these\nvacua can be uplifted to Minkowski and de Sitter by adding an anti D3-brane or\na D-term containing geometric and non-geometric fluxes. These uplifted\nnon-supersymmetric models are analyzed with respect to their potential to\nrealize axion monodromy inflation self-consistently. Admitting rational values\nof the fluxes, we construct examples with the required hierarchy of mass\nscales.\n", "  It is known that a large class of integrable hydrodynamic type systems can be\nconstructed through the Lauricella function, a generalization of the classical\nGauss hypergeometric function. In this paper, we construct novel class of\nintegrable hydrodynamic type systems which govern the dynamics of critical\npoints of confluent Lauricella type functions defined on finite dimensional\nGrassmannian Gr(2,n), the set of 2xn matrices of rank two. Those confluent\nfunctions satisfy certain degenerate Euler-Poisson-Darboux equations. It is\nalso shown that in general, hydrodynamic type system associated to the\nconfluent Lauricella function is given by an integrable and non-diagonalizable\nquasi-linear system of a Jordan matrix form. The cases of Grassmannian Gr(2,5)\nfor two component systems and Gr(2,6) for three component systems are\nconsidered in details.\n", "  We study coagulation-fragmentation equations inspired by a simple model\nproposed in fisheries science to explain data for the size distribution of\nschools of pelagic fish. Although the equations lack detailed balance and admit\nno $H$-theorem, we are able to develop a rather complete description of\nequilibrium profiles and large-time behavior, based on recent developments in\ncomplex function theory for Bernstein and Pick functions. In the\nlarge-population continuum limit, a scaling-invariant regime is reached in\nwhich all equilibria are determined by a single scaling profile. This universal\nprofile exhibits power-law behavior crossing over from exponent $-\\frac23$ for\nsmall size to $-\\frac32$ for large size, with an exponential cut-off.\n", "  We model the neuronal circuit of the C.elegans soil worm in terms of\nHindmarsh-Rose systems of ordinary differential equations, dividing its circuit\ninto six communities pointed out by the walktrap and Louvain methods. Using the\nnumerical solution of these equations, we analyze important measures of\ndynamical complexity, namely synchronicity, the largest Lyapunov exponent, and\nthe $\\Phi_{\\mbox{AR}}$ auto-regressive integrated information theory measure,\nwhich has been suggested to reflect different levels of consciousness. We show\nthat $\\Phi_{\\mbox{AR}}$ provides a useful measure of the information contained\nin the C.elegans brain dynamic network. Our analysis reveals that the C.elegans\nbrain dynamic network generates more information than the sum of its\nconstituent parts, and that attains higher levels of integrated information for\ncouplings for which either all its communities are highly synchronized, or\nthere is a mixed state of highly synchronized and desynchronized communities.\nBoth situations are characterized by relatively low chaotic behavior.\n", "  Various Li compounds are commonly used at neutron facilities as neutron\nabsorbers. These compounds provide one of the highest ratios of neutron\nattenuation to $\\gamma$-ray production. Unfortunately, the usage of these\ncompounds can also give rise to fast neutron emission with energies up to\nalmost 16 MeV. Historically, some details in this fast neutron production\nmechanism can be absent from some modeling packages under some optimization\nscenarios. In this work, we tested Geant4 to assess the performance of this\nsimulation toolkit for the fast neutron generation mechanism. We compare the\nresults of simulations performed with Geant4 to available measurements. The\noutcome of our study shows that results of the Geant4 simulations are in good\nagreement with the available measurements for $^6$Li fast neutron production,\nand suitable for neutron instrument background evaluation at spallation neutron\nsources.\n", "  In this paper we consider the phenomenon of superpositions in quantum\nmechanics and suggest a way to deal with the idea in a logical setting from a\nsyntactical point of view, that is, as subsumed in the language of the\nformalism, and not semantically. We restrict the discussion to the\npropositional level only. Then, after presenting the motivations and a possible\nworld semantics, the formalism is outlined and we also consider within this\nschema the claim that superpositions may involve contradictions, as in the case\nof the Schr\\\"odinger's cat, which (it is usually said) is both alive and dead.\nWe argue that this claim is a misreading of the quantum case. Finally, we\nsketch a new form of quantum logic that involves three kinds of negations and\npresent the relationships among them. The paper is a first approach to the\nsubject, introducing some main guidelines to be developed by a `syntactical'\nlogical approach to quantum superpositions.\n", "  Starting from the framework defined by Matveev and Shevchishin we derive the\nlocal and the global structure for the four types of super-integrable Koenigs\nmetrics. These dynamical systems are always defined on non-compact manifolds,\nnamely $\\,{\\mb R}^2\\,$ and $\\,{\\mb H}^2$. The study of their geodesic flows is\nmade easier using their linear and quadratic integrals. Using Carter (or\nminimal) quantization we show that the formal superintegrability is preserved\nat the quantum level and in two cases, for which all of the geodesics are\nclosed, it is even possible to compute the discrete spectrum of the quantum\nhamiltonian.\n", "  We study the slow crossing of non-equilibrium quantum phase transitions in\nperiodically-driven systems. We explicitly consider a spin chain with a uniform\ntime-dependent magnetic field and focus on the Floquet state that is\nadiabatically connected to the ground state of the static model. We find that\nthis {\\it Floquet ground state} undergoes a series of quantum phase transitions\ncharacterized by a non-trivial topology. To dinamically probe these\ntransitions, we propose to start with a large driving frequency and slowly\ndecrease it as a function of time. Combining analytical and numerical methods,\nwe uncover a Kibble-Zurek scaling that persists in the presence of moderate\ninteractions. This scaling can be used to experimentally demonstrate\nnon-equilibrium transitions that cannot be otherwise observed.\n", "  We report the discovery of K2-31b, the first confirmed transiting hot Jupiter\ndetected by the K2 space mission. We combined K2 photometry with FastCam lucky\nimaging and FIES and HARPS high-resolution spectroscopy to confirm the\nplanetary nature of the transiting object and derived the system parameters.\nK2-31b is a 1.8-Jupiter-mass planet on an 1.26-day-orbit around a G7\\,V star\n($M_\\star=0.91$~\\Msun, $R_\\star=0.78$~\\Rsun). The planetary radius is poorly\nconstrained (0.7$<$$R_\\mathrm{p}$$<$1.4~\\Rjup), owing to the grazing transit\nand the low sampling rate of the K2 photometry.\n", "  In this paper we review the appearance and utility of a nilpotent chiral\nmultiplet in the context of supergravity, string theory and cosmology. Coupling\na nilpotent chiral superfield to supergravity, one obtains what is called pure\ndS supergravity, a supergravity theory without scalar degrees of freedom that\nnaturally has de Sitter (dS) solutions, and in which supersymmetry is\nnon-linearly realized. We extend previous results that couple this dS\nsupergravity to chiral and vector multiplets and derive the most general\nsupergravity action for a single nilpotent chiral multiplet coupled to\nsupergravity and an arbitrary number of chiral and vector multiplets.\n", "  We present theoretical studies of high-order harmonic generation (HHG) driven\nby plasmonic fields in two-electron atomic systems. Comparing the two-active\nelectron and single-active electron approximation models of the negative\nhydrogen ion atom, we provide strong evidence that a double non-sequential\ntwo-electron recombination appears to be the main responsible for the HHG\ncutoff extension. Our analysis is carried out by means of a reduced\none-dimensional numerical integration of the two-electron time-dependent\nSchr\\\"odinger equation (TDSE), and on investigations of the classical electron\ntrajectories resulting from the Newton's equation of motion. Additional\ncomparisons between the negative hydrogen ion and the helium atom suggest that\nthe double recombination process depends distinctly on the atomic target. Our\nresearch paves the way to the understanding of strong field processes in\nmulti-electronic systems driven by spatially inhomogeneous fields.\n", "  We consider the sine-Gordon equation on metric graphs with simple topologies\nand derive vertex boundary conditions from the fundamental conservation laws,\nsuch as energy and current conservation. Traveling wave solutions for star and\ntree graphs are obtained analytically in the form of kink, antikink and\nbreather solitons for a special case. It is shown that these solutions provide\nreflectionless soliton transmission at the graph vertex. We find the sum rule\nfor bond-dependent coefficients making the sine-Gordon equation embedded on the\ngraph completely integrable. For the general case the problem is solved\nnumerically and the vertex scattering is quantified. Applications of the\nobtained results to Josephson junction networks, DNA double helix and elastic\nfibre networks are discussed.\n", "  We discuss the four-dimensional massless spectrum of supersymmetric Minkowski\ncompactifications of ten-dimensional heterotic supergravity, including the\nanomaly cancelation condition. This can be calculated from restrictions arising\nfrom F-term conditions in a four-dimensional effective theory. The results\nagree with computations of the infinitesimal moduli space recently performed\nfrom a ten-dimensional perspective. The paper is based on a talk given by Eirik\nEik Svanes in Leuven for the workshop on \"The String Theory Universe\".\n", "  We present a general methodology for electromagnetic homogenization and\ncharacterization of bianisotropic metasurfaces formed by regular or random\narrangements of small arbitrary inclusions at the interface of two different\nisotropic media. These topologies can provide the most general electric and\nmagnetic surface-bound dipolar responses to incident electromagnetic waves. The\napproach unites and generalizes the earlier theories developed independently by\ntwo research groups: the joint group of profs. Holloway and Kuester and the\njoint group of profs. Simovski and Tretyakov. We demonstrate the use of both\nformalisms in several example cases and discuss the differences between the two\napproaches. Furthermore, we generalize the known theories for the bianisotropic\nmetasurfaces located at interfaces between two different media or on a\nsubstrate. The generalized framework allows characterization of both periodical\nor amorphous metasurfaces. The developed analytical theory can be used in the\nanalysis and synthesis of metasurfaces for a wide variety of applications.\n", "  We describe rapid, random-access loading of a two-dimensional (2D)\nsurface-electrode ion-trap array based on two crossed photo-ionization laser\nbeams. With the use of a continuous flux of pre-cooled neutral atoms from a\nremotely-located source, we achieve loading of a single ion per site while\nmaintaining long trap lifetimes and without disturbing the coherence of an ion\nquantum bit in an adjacent site. This demonstration satisfies all major\ncriteria necessary for loading and reloading extensive 2D arrays, as will be\nrequired for large-scale quantum information processing. Moreover, the already\nhigh loading rate can be increased by loading ions in parallel with only a\nconcomitant increase in photo-ionization laser power and no need for additional\natomic flux.\n", "  We study the number of nodal domains of toral Laplace eigenfunctions.\nFollowing Nazarov-Sodin's results for random fields and Bourgain's\nde-randomisation procedure we establish a precise asymptotic result for\n\"generic\" eigenfunctions. Our main results in particular imply an optimal lower\nbound for the number of nodal domains of generic toral eigenfunctions.\n", "  This note discusses the connection between generalised geometry and flux\ncompactifications of string theory. Firstly, we explain in a pedestrian manner\nhow the supersymmetry constraints of type II ${\\mathcal{N}}=1$ flux\ncompactifications can be restated as integrability constraints on certain\ngeneralised complex structures. This reformulation uses generalised complex\ngeometry, a mathematical framework that geometrizes the B-field. Secondly, we\ndiscuss how exceptional generalised geometry may provide a similar\ngeometrization of the RR fields. Thirdly, we examine the connection between\ngeneralised geometry and non-geometry, and finally we present recent\ndevelopments where generalised geometry is used to construct explicit examples\nof flux compactifications to flat space.\n", "  Soft behaviour of closed string amplitudes involving dilatons, gravitons and\nanti-symmetric tensors, is studied in the framework of bosonic string theory.\nThe leading double soft limit of gluons is analysed as well, starting from\nscattering amplitudes computed in the open bosonic string. Field theory\nexpressions are then obtained by sending the string tension to infinity. The\npresented results have been derived in the papers of Ref.[1].\n", "  We investigate the critical behavior of pion superfluidity in the frame of\nfunctional renormalization group. By solving the flow equation in the SU(2)\nlinear sigma model with pion superfluidity at finite temperature and isospin\ndensity, and making comparison with the fixed point analysis of the flow\ndiagram in a general $O(N)$ model at zero temperature and density but with\ncontinuous dimension, the pion superfluidity is a second order phase transition\nsubject to a $O(2)$ universality class with a dimension crossover from\n$d_{\\text{eff}}=4$ to $d_{\\text{eff}}=3$. The usually used large $N$ expansion\ngives a temperature independent critical exponent $\\beta$ and agrees with the\nrenormalization group only at zero temperature.\n", "  The unitary evaporation of a black hole (BH) in an initially pure state must\nlead to the eventual purification of the emitted radiation. It follows that the\nlate radiation has to be entangled with the early radiation and, as a\nconsequence, the entanglement among the Hawking pair partners has to decrease\ncontinuously from maximal to vanishing during the BH's life span. Starting from\nthe basic premise that both the horizon radius and the center of mass of a\nfinite-mass BH are fluctuating quantum mechanically, we show how this process\nis realized. First, it is shown that the horizon fluctuations induce a small\namount of variance in the total linear momentum of each created pair. This is\nin contrast to the case of an infinitely massive BH, for which the total\nmomentum of the produced pair vanishes exactly on account of momentum\nconservation. This variance leads to a random recoil of the BH during each\nemission and, as a result, the center of mass of the BH undergoes a quantum\nrandom walk. Consequently, the uncertainty in its momentum grows as the square\nroot of the number of emissions. We then show that this uncertainty controls\nthe amount of deviation from maximal entanglement of the produced pairs and\nthat this deviation is determined by the ratio of the cumulative number of\nemitted particles to the initial BH entropy. Thus, the interplay between the\nhorizon and center-of-mass fluctuations provides a mechanism for teleporting\nentanglement from the pair partners to the BH and the emitted radiation.\n", "  We explore the electronic structure, orbital character and topological aspect\nof a monolayer MoS$_2$ nanoribbon using tight-binding (TB) and low-energy\n(${\\bm k}\\cdot{\\bm p} $) models. We obtain a mid-gap edge mode in the zigzag\nribbon of monolayer MoS$_2$, which can be traced back to the topological\nproperties of the bulk band structure. Monolayer MoS$_2$ can be considered as a\nvalley Hall insulator. The boundary conditions at armchair edges mix the\nvalleys on the edges, and a gap is induced in the edge modes. The spin-orbit\ncoupling in the valence band reduces the hybridization of the bulk states.\n", "  We present experimental results on dense corn-starch suspensions as examples\nof non-Brownian, nearly-hard particles that undergo continuous and\ndiscontinuous shear thickening (CST and DST) at intermediate and high densities\nrespectively. Our results offer strong support for recent theories involving a\nstress-dependent effective contact friction among particles. We show however\nthat in the DST regime, where theory might lead one to expect steady-state\nshear bands oriented layerwise along the vorticity axis, the real flow is\nunsteady. To explain this, we argue that steady-state banding is generically\nruled out by the requirement that, for hard non-Brownian particles, the solvent\npressure and the normal-normal component of the particle stress must balance\nseparately across the interface between bands. (Otherwise there is an\nunbalanced migration flux.) However, long-lived transient shear-bands remain\npossible.\n", "  Magnetic impurities are responsible for many interesting phenomena in\ncondensed matter systems, notably the Kondo effect and quantum phase\ntransitions. Here we present a holographic model of a magnetic impurity that\ncaptures the main physical properties of the large-spin Kondo effect. We\nestimate the screening length of the Kondo cloud that forms around the impurity\nfrom a calculation of entanglement entropy and show that our results are\nconsistent with the g-theorem.\n", "  Metasurfaces composed of planar arrays of sub-wavelength artificial\nstructures show promise for extraordinary light manipulation; they have yielded\nnovel ultrathin optical components such as flat lenses, wave plates,\nholographic surfaces and orbital angular momentum manipulation and detection\nover a broad range of electromagnetic spectrum. However the optical properties\nof metasurfaces developed to date do not allow for versatile tunability of\nreflected or transmitted wave amplitude and phase after fabrication, thus\nlimiting their use in a wide range of applications. Here, we experimentally\ndemonstrate a gate-tunable metasurface that enables dynamic electrical control\nof the phase and amplitude of the plane wave reflected from the metasurface.\nTunability arises from field-effect modulation of the complex refractive index\nof conducting oxide layers incorporated into metasurface antenna elements which\nare configured in a reflectarray geometry. We measure a phase shift of {\\pi}\nand ~ 30% change in the reflectance by applying 2.5 V gate bias. Additionally,\nwe demonstrate modulation at frequencies exceeding 10 MHz, and electrical\nswitching of +/-1 order diffracted beams by electrical control over subgroups\nof metasurface elements, a basic requirement for electrically tunable\nbeam-steering phased array metasurfaces. The proposed tunable metasurface\ndesign with high optical quality and high speed dynamic phase modulation\nsuggests applications in next generation ultrathin optical components for\nimaging and sensing technologies, such as reconfigurable beam steering devices,\ndynamic holograms, tunable ultrathin lens, nano-projectors, and nanoscale\nspatial light modulators. Importantly, our design allows complete integration\nwith electronics and hence electrical addressability of individual metasurface\nelements.\n", "  Generalized geometry provides the framework for a systematic approach to\nnon-symmetric metric gravity theory and naturally leads to an\nEinstein-Kalb-Ramond gravity theory with totally anti-symmetric contortion. The\napproach is related to the study of the low-energy effective closed string\ngravity actions.\n", "  We study the decay law for a moving unstable particle. The usual\ntime-dilatation formula states that the decay width for an unstable state\nmoving with a momentum $p$ and mass $M$ is $\\tilde{\\Gamma}_{p}=\\Gamma\nM/\\sqrt{p^{2}+M^{2}}$ with $\\Gamma$ being the decay width in the rest frame. In\nagreement with previous studies, we show that in the context of QM as well as\nQFT this equation is \\textit{not} correct provided that the quantum measurement\nis performed in a reference frame in which the unstable particle has momentum\n$p$ (note, a momentum eigenstate is \\textit{not} a velocity eigenstate in QM).\nWe then give, to our knowledge for the first time, an analytic expression of an\nimproved formula and we show that the deviation from $\\tilde{\\Gamma}_{p}$ has a\nmaximum for $p/M=\\sqrt{2/3},$ but is typically \\textit{very} small. Then, the\nresult can be easily generalized to a momentum wave packet and also to an\narbitrary initial state. Here, we give a very general expression of the\nnon-decay probability. As a next step, we show that care is needed when one\nmakes a boost of an unstable state with zero momentum/velocity: namely, the\nresulting state has zero overlap with the elements of the basis of unstable\nstates (it is already decayed!). However, when considering a spread in\nvelocity, one finds again that $\\tilde{\\Gamma }_{p}$ is typically a very good\napproximation. The study of a velocity wave-packet represents an interesting\nsubject which constitutes one of the main outcomes of the present\nmanuscript.\\textbf{ }In the end, it should be stressed that there is no\nwhatsoever breaking of special relativity, but as usual in QM, one should\nspecify which kind of measurement on which kind of state is performed.\n", "  We review strongly coupled and extra dimensional models of electroweak\nsymmetry breaking. Models examined include warped extra dimensions, bulk Higgs,\n\"little\" Higgs, dilaton Higgs, composite Higgs, twin Higgs, quantum critical\nHiggs, and \"fat\" SUSY Higgs. We also discuss current bounds and future LHC\nsearches for this class of models.\n", "  In a class of left-right symmetric models for linear seesaw, a neutrinoless\ndouble beta decay induced by the left- and right-handed charged currents\ntogether will only depend on the breaking details of left-right and electroweak\nsymmetries. This neutrinoless double beta decay can reach the experimental\nsensitivities if the right-handed charged gauge boson is below the 100 TeV\nscale.\n", "  Branes at a $\\mathbb{F}_0$ singularity give rise to two different toric\nquiver gauge theories, which are related by Seiberg duality. We study where in\nthe K\\\"ahler moduli space each of them is physically realized.\n", "  We argue that all consistent 4D quantum field theories obey a\nspacetime-averaged weak energy inequality $\\langle T^{00} \\rangle \\ge -C/L^4$,\nwhere $L$ is the size of the smearing region, and $C$ is a positive constant\nthat depends on the theory. If this condition is violated, the theory has\nstates that are indistinguishable from states of negative total energy by any\nlocal measurement, and we expect instabilities or other inconsistencies. We\napply this condition to 4D conformal field theories, and find that it places\nconstraints on the OPE coefficients of the theory. The constraints we find are\nweaker than the \"conformal collider\" constraints of Hofman and Maldacena. We\nspeculate that there may be theories that violate the Hofman-Maldacena bounds,\nbut satisfy our bounds. In 3D CFTs, the only constraint we find is equivalent\nto the positivity of 2-point function of the energy-momentum tensor, which\nfollows from unitarity. Our calculations are performed using momentum-space\nWightman functions, which are remarkably simple functions of momenta, and may\nbe of interest in their own right.\n", "  We construct the full linearisation functor which takes a graded bundle of\ndegree $k$ (a particular kind of graded manifold) and produces a $k$-fold\nvector bundle. We fully characterise the image of the full linearisation\nfunctor and show that we obtain a subcategory of $k$-fold vector bundles\nconsisting of symmetric $k$-fold vector bundles equipped with a family of\nmorphisms indexed by the symmetric group ${\\mathbb S}_k$. Interestingly, for\nthe degree 2 case this additional structure gives rise to the notion of a\nsymplectical double vector bundle, which is the skew-symmetric analogue of a\nmetric double vector bundle. We also discuss the related case of fully\nlinearising $N$-manifolds, and how one can use the full linearisation functor\nto \"superise\" a graded bundle.\n", "  We review some recent developments in the construction of integrable $\\eta$-\nand $\\lambda$-deformations of the $AdS_5 \\times S^5$ superstring. We highlight\ntheir link with Poisson-Lie T-duality.\n", "  Generation of heralded single photons has recently been demonstrated using\nspontaneous four-wave mixing in integrated microresonators. While the results\nof coincidence measurements on the generated photon pairs from these systems\nshow promise for their utility in heralding applications, such measurements do\nnot reveal all of the effects of photon losses within the resonator. These\neffects, which include a significant degradation of the heralding efficiency,\ndepend strongly on the relative strengths of the coupling of the ring modes to\nloss modes and channel modes. We show that the common choice of critical\ncoupling does not optimize the rate of successfully heralded photons, and\nderive the coupling condition needed to do so, as well as the condition needed\nto maximize the rate of coincidence counts. Optimizing these rates has a\nconsiderable negative effect on the heralding efficiency.\n", "  Theories with approximate no-scale structure, such as the Large Volume\nScenario, have a distinctive hierarchy of multiple mass scales in between TeV\ngaugino masses and the Planck scale, which we call SUSY's Ladder. This is a\nparticular realization of Split Supersymmetry in which the same small parameter\nsuppresses gaugino masses relative to scalar soft masses, scalar soft masses\nrelative to the gravitino mass, and the UV cutoff or string scale relative to\nthe Planck scale. This scenario has many phenomenologically interesting\nproperties, and can avoid dangers including the gravitino problem, flavor\nproblems, and the moduli-induced LSP problem that plague other supersymmetric\ntheories. We study SUSY's Ladder using a superspace formalism that makes the\nmysterious cancelations in previous computations manifest. This opens the\npossibility of a consistent effective field theory understanding of the\nphenomenology of these scenarios, based on power-counting in the small ratio of\nstring to Planck scales. We also show that four-dimensional theories with\napproximate no-scale structure enforced by a single volume modulus arise only\nfrom two special higher-dimensional theories: five-dimensional supergravity and\nten-dimensional type IIB supergravity. This gives a phenomenological argument\nin favor of ten dimensional ultraviolet physics which is different from\nstandard arguments based on the consistency of superstring theory.\n", "  We apply the quadrature-based perturbation method of Dalgarno and Lewis to\nthe evaluation of the nonlinear optical response of quantum systems. This\ngeneral operator method for perturbation theory allows us to derive exact\nexpressions for the first three electronic polarizabilities which require only\na good estimate of the ground state wave function, makes no explicit reference\nto the underlying potential, and avoids complexities arising from excited state\ndegeneracies. We apply this method to simple examples in 1D quantum mechanics\nfor illustration, exploring the sensitivity of this method to variational\nsolutions as well as poor numerical sampling. Finally, to the best of our\nknowledge, we extend the Dalgarno-Lewis method for for the first time to\ntime-harmonic perturbations, allowing dispersion characteristics to be\ndetermined from the unperturbed ground state wave function alone.\n", "  In this paper we consider entanglement entropies in two-dimensional conformal\nfield theories in the presence of topological interfaces. Tracing over one side\nof the interface, the leading term of the entropy remains unchanged. The\ninterface however adds a subleading contribution, which can be interpreted as a\nrelative (Kullback-Leibler) entropy with respect to the situation with no\ndefect inserted. Reinterpreting boundaries as topological interfaces of a\nchiral half of the full theory, we rederive the left/right entanglement entropy\nin analogy with the interface case. We discuss WZW models and toroidal bosonic\ntheories as examples.\n", "  We present an accurate and efficient algorithm to calculate the electrostatic\ninteraction of charged point particles with partially periodic boundary\nconditions that are confined along the nonperiodic direction by two metallic\nparallel plates. The method preserves the original boundary conditions and\nhence, it does not introduce any kind of artifacts. In addition, it enjoys the\nquasilinear complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(N\\ln(N))$, where $N$ being the number of\nparticles in the simulation box. In fact, based on the superposition principle\nin electrostatics, the problem is split into two electrostatic problems where\neach one can be calculated by the appropriate Poisson solver. In this paper we\napply the method to sodium chloride ultrathin films and investigate its\ndielectric response with respect to external bias voltage. We show how\naccurately in this method one can obtain the total charge induced on metallic\nboundaries to an arbitrary precision.\n", "  String consistency conditions are stronger than anomaly cancellation and can\nrequire the addition of exotics in the visible sector. We study such exotics\nand demonstrate that they may account for the modest excess at $750$ GeV in\nrecent diphoton resonance searches performed by the ATLAS and CMS\ncollaborations. In a previous analysis of type II MSSM D-brane quivers we\nsystematically added up to five exotics for the sake of satisfying string\nconsistency conditions. Using this dataset, we demonstrate that 89780 of the\n89964 quivers have exotics, 78155 of which include singlets that may couple to\nMSSM or exotic multiplets with coupling structures governed by $U(1)$\nsymmetries that are often anomalous. We demonstrate that certain sets of\nexotics are far preferred over others and study the structure of singlet\ncouplings to heavy exotics carrying standard model charges. Typical\npossibilities include singlets that may decay to vector-like quarks and / or\nvector-like leptons and subsequently to two photons. We show that a narrow\nwidth diphoton excess can be accounted for while evading existing bounds if\nmultiple exotics are added, with vector-like leptons of mass $M_L\\lesssim 375$\nGeV and vector-like quarks with masses up to $\\simeq 3$ TeV. However, a large\nwidth $(\\Gamma/M \\sim 0.06)$, as suggested by the ATLAS data, cannot be easily\naccommodated in this framework. Renormalization group equations with GUT-scale\nboundary conditions show that these supersymmetric models are perturbative and\nstable. Type IIA compactifications on toroidal orbifolds allow for $O(10)$\nYukawa couplings in the ultraviolet. We also discuss the possibility of\naccounting for the diphoton excess in a low string scale scenario via the decay\nof string axions.\n", "  The strength of chaos in large $N$ quantum systems can be quantified using\n$\\lambda_L$, the rate of growth of certain out-of-time-order four point\nfunctions. We calculate $\\lambda_L$ to leading order in a weakly coupled matrix\n$\\Phi^4$ theory by numerically diagonalizing a ladder kernel. The computation\nreduces to an essentially classical problem.\n", "  A review of analyses based upon anti-parallel vortex structures suggests that\nstructurally stable vortex structures with eroding circulation may offer a path\nto the study of rapid vorticity growth in solutions of Euler's equations in $\n\\scriptstyle{\\mathbb{R}}^3$. We examine here the possible formation of such a\nstructure in axisymmetric flow without swirl, leading to maximal growth of\nvorticity as $t^{4/3}$. Our study suggests that the optimizing flow giving the\n$t^{4/3}$ growth mimics an exact solution of Euler's equations representing an\neroding toroidal vortex dipole which locally conserves kinetic energy. The\ndipole cross-section is a perturbation of the classical Sadovskii dipole having\npiecewise constant vorticity, which breaks the symmetry of closed streamlines.\nThe structure of this perturbed Sadovskii dipole is analyzed asymptotically at\nlarge times, and its predicted properties are verified numerically.\n", "  We derive explicit formulas for solutions of the Bethe Ansatz equations of\nthe Gaudin model associated to the tensor product of one arbitrary\nfinite-dimensional irreducible module and one vector representation for all\nsimple Lie algebras of classical type. We use this result to show that the\nBethe Ansatz is complete in any tensor product where all but one factor are\nvector representations and the evaluation parameters are generic. We also show\nthat except for the type D, the joint spectrum of Gaudin Hamiltonians in such\ntensor products is simple.\n", "  The so-called Jackiw-Pi (JP) model for massive vector fields is a three\ndimensional, gauge invariant and parity preserving model which was discussed in\nseveral contexts. In this paper we have discussed its quantum aspects through\nthe introduction of Planck scale objects, i.e., via noncommutativity and the\nwell known BV quantization. Namely, we have constructed the JP noncommutative\nspacetime version and we have provided the BV quantization of the commutative\nJP model and we have discussed its features. The noncommutativity has\nintroduced interesting new objects in JP's Planck scale framework.\n", "  The influence of photon-momentum recoil on adiabatic population transfer in\nan atomic three-level lambda system is studied. It is shown that the Doppler\nfrequency shifts, due to atomic motion can play an important role in adiabatic\npopulation transfer processes of atomic internal states by a pair of laser\nfields. For the limiting case of slow atoms ( Doppler shift much smaller than\nthe photon recoil energy) the atoms occupy the same target state regardless of\nthe order of switching of laser fields, while for the case of fast atoms\ninteracting with the intuitive sequence of pulses, the target state is the\nintermediate atomic state. It is shown that these processes are robust with\nrespect to parameter fluctuations, such as the laser pulse area and the\nrelative spatial offset (delay) of the laser beams. The obtained results can be\nused for the control of temporal evolution of atomic populations in atomic\nbeams by externally adjustable Doppler shifts.\n", "  Analyzing some well established facts, we give a model-independent\nparameterization of black hole quantum computing in terms of a set of macro and\nmicro quantities and their relations. These include the relations between the\nextraordinarily-small energy gap of black hole qubits and important time-scales\nof information-processing, such as, scrambling time and Page's time. We then\nshow, confirming and extending previous results, that other systems of nature\nwith identical quantum informatics features are attractive Bose-Einstein\nsystems at the critical point of quantum phase transition. Here we establish a\ncomplete isomorphy between the quantum computational properties of these two\nsystems. In particular, we show that the quantum hair of a critical condensate\nis strikingly similar to the quantum hair of a black hole. Irrespectively\nwhether one takes the similarity between the two systems as a remarkable\ncoincidence or as a sign of a deeper underlying connection, the following is\nevident. Black holes are not unique in their way of quantum information\nprocessing and we can manufacture black hole based quantum computers in labs by\ntaking advantage of quantum criticality.\n", "  Chirality is an intriguing property of certain molecules, materials or\nartificial nanostructures, which allows them to interact with the spin angular\nmomentum of the impinging light field. Due to their chiral geometry, they can\ndistinguish between left- and right-hand circular polarization states or\nconvert them into each other. Here, we introduce a novel approach towards\noptical chirality, which is observed in individual two-dimensional and\ngeometrically mirror-symmetric nanostructures. In this scheme, the chiral\noptical response is induced by the chosen heterogeneous material composition of\na particle assembly and the corresponding resonance behavior of the\nconstituents it is built from, which breaks the symmetry of the system. As a\nproof of principle, we investigate such a structure composed of individual\nsilicon and gold nanoparticles both experimentally as well as numerically. Our\nproposed concept constitutes a novel approach for designing two-dimensional\nchiral media tailored at the nanoscale.\n", "  A new class is introduced of M2-branes solutions of d=11 supergravity that\ninclude internal fluxes obeying Englert equation in 7-dimensions. A simple\ncriterion for the existence of Killing spinors in such backgrounds is\nestablished. Englert equation is viewed as the generalization to d=7 of\nBeltrami equation defined in d=3 and it is trated accordingly. All 2-brane\nsolutions of minimal d=7 supergracity can be uplifted to d=11 and have N > 4 or\nN = 4 supersymmetry. It is shown that the simple group PSL(2,7) is\ncrystallographic in d=7 having an integral action on the A7 root lattice. By\nmeans of this point-group and of the T7 torus obtained quotiening R7 with the\nA7 root lattice we were able to construct new M2 branes with Englert fluxes and\nN < 4. In particular we exhibit here an N=1 solution depending on 4-parameters\nand admitting a large non abelian discrete symmetry, namely G21 = Z3 semidirect\nproduct with Z7 = subgroup of PSL(2,7). The dual d=3 field theories have the\nsame symmetries and have complicated non linear interactions.\n", "  A new approach to the Kaluza theory and its relation to the gauge theory is\npresented. Two degenerate metrics on the $4+d$-dimensional total manifold are\nused, one corresponding to the spacetime metric and giving the fiber of the\ngauge bundle, and the other one to the metric of the fiber and giving the\nhorizontal bundle of the connection. When combined, the two metrics give the\nKaluza metric and its generalization to the non-abelian case, justifying thus\nhis choice. Considering the two metrics as fundamental rather than the Kaluza\nmetric explains why Kaluza's theory should not be regarded as five-dimensional\nvacuum gravity. This approach suggests that the only evidence of extra\ndimensions is given by the existence of the gauge forces, explaining thus why\nother kinds of evidence are not available. In addition, because the degenerate\nmetric corresponding to the spacetime metric vanishes along the extra\ndimensions, the lengths in the extra dimensions is zero, preventing us to\ndirectly probe them. Therefore this approach suggests that it is not justified\nto search for experimental evidence of the extra dimensions as if they are\nmerely extra spacetime dimensions. On the other hand the new approach uses a\nvery general formalism, which can be applied to known and new generalizations\nof the Kaluza theory aiming to achieve more and make different experimental\npredictions.\n", "  We develop an efficient procedure for counting holomorphic functions on a\nhyperKahler cone that has a resolution as a cotangent bundle of a homogeneous\nspace by providing a formula for computing the corresponding Highest Weight\nGenerating function.\n", "  An imaging system is presented that is capable of far-detuned non-destructive\nimaging of a Bose-Einstein condensate with the signal proportional to the\nsecond spatial derivative of the density. Whilst demonstrated with application\nto $^{85}\\text{Rb}$, the technique generalizes to other atomic species and is\nshown to be capable of a signal to noise of ${\\sim}25$ at $1$GHz detuning with\n$100$ in-trap images showing no observable heating or atom loss. The technique\nis also applied to the observation of individual trajectories of stochastic\ndynamics inaccessible to single shot imaging. Coupled with a fast optical phase\nlock loop, the system is capable of dynamically switching to resonant\nabsorption imaging during the experiment.\n", "  Measurement and estimation of parameters are essential for science and\nengineering, where the main quest is to find out the highest achievable\nprecision with given resources and design schemes to attain it. Two schemes,\nthe sequential feedback scheme and the parallel scheme, are usually studied in\nquantum parameter estimation. While the sequential feedback scheme represents\nthe most general scheme, it remains unknown whether it can outperform the\nparallel scheme for any quantum estimation tasks. In this Letter we show that\nthe sequential feedback scheme has a 3-fold improvement over the parallel\nscheme for Hamiltonian parameter estimations on 2-dimensional systems, and an\norder of $O(d+1)$ improvement for Hamiltonian parameter estimation on\n$d-$dimensional systems. We also show that, contrary to the conventional\nbelief, it is possible to simultaneously achieve the highest precision for\nestimating all three components of a magnetic field, which sets a benchmark on\nthe local precision limit for the estimation of a magnetic field.\n", "  Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (SQUID) metamaterials are\nsuperconducting artificial media whose function relies both on their geometry\nand the extraordinary properties of superconductivity and the Josephson effect.\nRecent experiments on one- and two-dimensional radio-frequency (rf) SQUID\nmetamaterials have revealed their wide-band tuneability, significantly reduced\nlosses, dynamic multistability, and tunable broadband transparency. The\nsimplest version of an rf SQUID involves a superconducting ring interrupted by\na Josephson junction; this device is a highly nonlinear resonator with a strong\nresponse to applied magnetic fields. SQUID metamaterials exhibit peculiar\nmagnetic properties such as negative diamagnetic permeability, predicted both\nfor the quantum and the classical regime. The applied alternating fields induce\n(super)currents in the SQUID rings, which are therefore coupled through\ndipole-dipole magnetic forces. This interaction is weak due to its magnetic\nnature. However, it couples the SQUIDs non-locally since it falls-off as the\ninverse cube of their center-to-center distance.\n", "  The common behavior of a wave is determined by wave parameters of its medium,\nwhich are generally associated with the characteristic oscillations of its\ncorresponding elementary particles. In the context of metamaterials, the\ndecoupled excitation of these fundamental oscillations would provide an ideal\nplatform for top-down and reconfigurable access to the entire space of\nconstitutive wave parameters; however, this has remained as a conceivable\nproblem that must be accomplished, after being pointed out by Pendry. Here, by\nfocusing on acoustic metamaterials, we achieve the decoupling of density $\\rho$\n, modulus B$^{-1}$, and bianisotropy {\\xi} near the Dirac point, by separating\nthe paths of particle momentum to conform to the characteristic oscillations of\neach macroscopic wave parameter. Independent access to all octants of wave\nparameter space ($\\rho$ , B$^{-1}$, $\\xi$) = (+/-,+/-,+/-) is thus realized\nusing a single platform that we call an omni meta-atom; as a building block\nthat achieves top-down access to the target properties of metamaterials. With\nprecision access to the target ($\\rho$ , B$^{-1}$, $\\xi$ ), we also propose a\nbianisotropic meta-surface for independent shaping of transmission- and\nreflection-wave fronts, and a zero-index anisotropic waveguide for\npressure-velocity conversion.\n", "  Despite being ubiquitous, out-of-equilibrium quantum systems are much less\nunderstood than systems at equilibrium. Progress in the field has benefited\nfrom a symbiotic relationship between theoretical studies and new experiments\non coherent dynamics. The present work strengthens this connection by providing\na general picture of the relaxation process of isolated lattice many-body\nquantum systems that are routinely studied in experiments with cold atoms, ions\ntraps, and nuclear magnetic resonance. We show numerically and analytically\nthat the long-time decay of the probability for finding the system in its\ninitial state necessarily shows a power-law behavior $\\propto t^{ - \\gamma }$.\nThis happens independently of the details of the system, such as integrability,\nlevel repulsion, and the presence or absence of disorder. Information about the\nspectrum, the structure of the initial state, and the number of particles that\ninteract simultaneously is contained in the value of $\\gamma$. From it, we can\nanticipate whether the initial state will or will not thermalize.\n", "  The standard model of femtosecond filamentation is based on phenomenological\nassumptions which suggest that the ionization-induced carriers can be treated\nas free according to the Drude model, while the nonlinear response of the bound\ncarriers follows the all-optical Kerr effect. Here, we demonstrate that the\nadditional plasma generated at a multiphoton resonance dominates the saturation\nof the nonlinear refractive index. Since resonances are not captured by the\nstandard model, we propose a modification of the latter in which ionization\nenhancements can be accounted for by an ionization rate obtained from\nnon-Hermitian Floquet theory. In the adiabatic regime of long pulse envelopes,\nthis augmented standard model is in excellent agreement with direct quantum\nmechanical simulations. Since our proposal maintains the structure of the\nstandard model, it can be easily incorporated into existing codes of filament\nsimulation.\n", "  Based on DFT and Berry curvature calculations, we predict that quantum\nanomalous hall effect (QAHE) can be realized in two dimensional\nanti-ferromagnetic (AFM) NiRuCl6 with zero net magnetic moment. By tuning\nspin-orbits coupling (SOC), we find that the topological properties of NiRuCl6\ncome from its energy band reversal. The results indicate that NiRuCl6 behaves\nas AFM Chern insulator and its spin-polarized electronic structure and strong\nspin-orbits coupling (SOC) are the origin of QAHE. Considering the\ncompatibility between AFM and insulator, AFM Chern insulator is more suitable\nto realize high temperature QAHE because generally Neel temperature of AFM\nsystems is more easily improved than Curie temperature of ferromagnetic (FM)\nsystems. Due to the different magnetic coupling mechanism between FM and AFM\nChern insulator, AFM Chern insulator provides a new way to archive high\ntemperature QAHE in experiments.\n", "  Contribution of plasma oscillation to the broadband terahertz emission is\nrevealed by interacting two-color laser pulses with a supersonic jet of\nnitrogen molecules. Temporal and spectral shifts of THz waves are observed as\nthe plasma density varies. The former owes to the changing refractive index of\nthe THz waves, and the latter correlates to the varying plasma frequency.\nSimulation of considering photocurrents, plasma oscillation and decaying plasma\ndensity explains the broadband THz spectrum and the varying THz spectrum.\nPlasma oscillation only contributes to THz waves at low plasma density owing to\nnegligible plasma absorption. At the longer medium or higher density, the\ncombining effects of plasma oscillation and absorption results in the observed\nlow-frequency broadband THz spectra.\n", "  Coupling an electromechanical resonator with carbon-nanotube quantum dots is\na significant method to control both the electronic charge and the spin quantum\nstates. By exploiting a novel micro-transfer technique, we fabricate two\nstrongly-coupled and electrically-tunable mechanical resonators on a single\ncarbon nanotube for the first time. The frequency of the two resonators can be\nindividually tuned by the bottom gates, and strong coupling is observed between\nthe electron charge and phonon modes of each resonator. Furthermore, the\nconductance of either resonator can be nonlocally modulated by the phonon modes\nin the other resonator. Strong coupling is observed between the phonon modes of\nthe two resonators, which provides an effective long distance electron-electron\ninteraction. The generation of phonon-mediated-spin entanglement is also\ntheoretically analyzed for the two resonators. This strongly-coupled nanotube\nelectromechanical resonator array provides an experimental platform for future\nstudies of the coherent electron-phonon interaction, the phonon mediated\nlong-distance electron interaction, and entanglement state generation.\n", "  Influences of topological defect and dislocation on conductivity behavior of\ncharge carries in external electromagnetic fields are studied. Particularly the\nquantum Hall effect is investigated in detail. It is found that the nontrivial\ndeformations of spacetime due to topological defect and dislocation produce an\nelectric current at the leading order of perturbation theory. This current then\ninduces a deformation on the Hall conductivity. The corrections on the Hall\nconductivity depend on the external electric fields, the size of the sample and\nthe momentum of the particle.\n", "  The dipole phenomenology, which has been quite successful applied to various\nhard reactions, especially on nuclear targets, is applied for calculation of\nGribov inelastic shadowing. This approach does not include ad hoc procedures,\nwhich are unavoidable in calculations done in hadronic representation. Several\nexamples of Gribov corrections evaluated within the dipole description are\npresented.\n", "  A new approach to the free fall experiment with UCN is proposed. The idea is\nthat the experiment is performed with neutrons from different equidistant lines\nof a discrete energy spectrum with a precisely known distance between the\nlines. Such a spectrum may be formed by neutron diffraction from a moving phase\ngrating. Time-of-flight values of neutrons from different lines of the spectrum\nmust be measured. Neither the initial neutron energy, nor the geometry\nparameters of the installation are required to be known in this method.\n", "  We study the effect of particles shape on the radiative heat transfer in a\nthree-body system. It is found that the radiative heat flux between two\nnanoparticles in a three body system can be tuned by the shape of the third\nparticle. In particular, we show that the heat flux is very sensitive to the\nparticle shapes and slight mismatches of shapes results in either enhanced or\nsuppressed heat flux.\n", "  In this letter, we provide evidence for universality in the low-energy\nexpansion of tree-level string interactions. More precisely, in the\nalpha'-expansion of tree-level scattering amplitudes, we conjecture that the\nleading transcendental coefficient at each order in alpha' is universal for all\nperturbative string theories. We have checked this universality up to seven\npoints and trace its origin to the ability to restructure the disk integrals of\nopen bosonic string into those of the superstring. The accompanying kinematic\nfunctions have the same low-energy limit and do not introduce any\ntranscendental numbers in their alpha'-corrections. Universality in the\nclosed-string sector then follows from the KLT-relations.\n", "  Debate persists as to whether the cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ can\ndirectly modify the power of a gravitational lens. With the aim of\nreestablishing a consensus on this issue, I conduct a comprehensive analysis of\ngravitational lensing in the Schwarzschild--de Sitter spacetime, wherein the\neffects of $\\Lambda$ should be most apparent. The effective lensing law is\nfound to be in precise agreement with the $\\Lambda=0$ result:\n$\\alpha_\\mathrm{eff} = 4m/b_\\mathrm{eff}+15\\pi m^2/4b_\\mathrm{eff}^2\n+O(m^3/b_\\mathrm{eff}^3)$, where the effective bending angle\n$\\alpha_\\mathrm{eff}$ and impact parameter $b_\\mathrm{eff}$ are defined by the\nangles and angular diameter distances measured by a comoving cosmological\nobserver. [These observers follow the timelike geodesic congruence which (i)\nrespects the continuous symmetries of the spacetime and (ii) approaches local\nisotropy most rapidly at large distance from the lens.] The effective lensing\nlaw can be derived using lensed or unlensed angular diameter distances,\nalthough the inherent ambiguity of unlensed distances generates an additional\nuncertainty $O(m^5/\\Lambda b_\\mathrm{eff}^7)$. I conclude that the cosmological\nconstant does not interfere with the standard gravitational lensing formalism.\n", "  We demonstrate that the limiting energy available for ejected electrons in\ndouble beta decay is diminished by about 400 eV due to inelastic processes in\nthe electronic shell.\n", "  We consider biased ensembles of trajectories associated with large deviations\nof currents in equilibrium systems. The biased ensembles are characterised by\nnon-zero currents and lack the time-reversal symmetry of the equilibrium state,\nbut we show that they retain a generalised time-reversal symmetry, involving a\nspatial transformation that inverts the current. This means that these\nensembles lack dissipation. Hence, they differ significantly from\nnon-equilibrium steady states where currents are induced by external forces.\nOne consequence of this result is that maximum entropy assumptions\n(MaxEnt/MaxCal), widely used for modelling thermal systems away from\nequilibrium, have quite unexpected implications, including apparent superfluid\nbehaviour in a classical model of shear flow.\n", "  A newly synthesized layered material C2N was investigated based on many- body\nperturbation theory using GW plus Bethe-Salpeter equation approach. The\nelectronic band gap was determined to be ranging from 3.75 to 1.89 eV from\nmonolayer to bulk. Significant GW quasiparticle corrections, of more than 0.9\neV, to the Kohn-Sham band gaps from the local density approximation (LDA)\ncalculations are found. Strong excitonic effects play a crucial role in optical\nproperties. We found large binding energies of greater than 0.6 eV for bound\nexcitons in few-layer C2N, while it is only 0.04 eV in bulk C2N. All the\nstructures exhibit strong and broad optical absorption in the visible light\nregion, which makes C2N a promising candidate for solar energy conversion, such\nas photocatalytic water splitting.\n", "  The globally increased demand for helium-3 along with the limited\navailability of this gas calls for the development of alternative technologies\nfor the large ESS instrumentation pool. We report on the CASCADE Project - a\nnovel detection system, which has been developed for the purposes of neutron\nspin echo spectroscopy. It features 2D spatially resolved detection of thermal\nneutrons at high rates. The CASCADE detector is composed of a stack of solid\nboron-10 coated Gas Electron Multiplier foils, which serve both as a neutron\nconverter and as an amplifier for the primary ionization deposited in the\nstandard Argon-CO2 counting gas environment. This multi-layer setup efficiently\nincreases the detection efficiency and serves as a helium-3 alternative. It has\nfurthermore been possible to extract the signal of the charge traversing the\nstack to identify the very thin conversion layer of about 1 micrometer. This\nallows the precise determination of the time-of-flight, necessary for the\napplication in MIEZE spin echo techniques.\n", "  In the framework of quantum computation with mixed states, a fuzzy\nrepresentation of CNOT gate is introduced. In this representation, the\nincidence of non-factorizability is specially investigated.\n", "  In this work we present the fundamental ideas of inference over paths, and\nshow how this formalism implies the continuity equation, which is central for\nthe derivation of the main partial differential equations that constitute\nnon-equilibrium statistical mechanics. Equations such as the Liouville\nequation, Fokker-Planck equation, among others can be recovered as particular\ncases of the continuity equation, under different probability fluxes. We derive\nthe continuity equation in its most general form through what we call the \\bf\ntime-slicing equation, which lays down the procedure to go from the\nrepresentation in terms of a path probability functional $\\rho[X()]$ to a\ntime-dependent probability density $\\rho(x; t)$. The original probability\nfunctional $\\rho[X()]$ can in principle be constructed from different methods\nof inference; in this work we sketch an application using the maximum path\nentropy or maximum caliber principle.\n", "  Topological quantum materials represent a new class of matter with both\nexotic physical phenomena and novel application potentials. Many Heusler\ncompounds, which exhibit rich emergent properties such as unusual magnetism,\nsuperconductivity and heavy fermion behaviour, have been predicted to host\nnon-trivial topological electronic structures. The coexistence of topological\norder and other unusual properties makes Heusler materials ideal platform to\nsearch for new topological quantum phases (such as quantum anomalous Hall\ninsulator and topological superconductor). By carrying out angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and ab initio calculations on rare-earth\nhalf-Heusler compounds LnPtBi (Ln=Lu, Y), we directly observed the unusual\ntopological surface states on these materials, establishing them as first\nmembers with non-trivial topological electronic structure in this class of\nmaterials. Moreover, as LnPtBi compounds are non-centrosymmetric\nsuperconductors, our discovery further highlights them as promising candidates\nof topological superconductors.\n", "  The so called \"incomplete hole shell filling\" phenomenon, that is the\nbreaking of the Aufbau principle was reported by D. Reuter et al., [Phys. Rev.\nLett. 94, 026808] in the hole charging spectra of quantum dot when results were\ninterpreted in context of s/p/d shell system - typical for electrons. We report\nan example of inter-particle-interaction induced Aufbau principle violation\neven if it is applied to one-particle Kohn-Luttinger eigenstates. We present a\nk-dot-p/configuration-interaction study that concerns multiple holes confined\nin InGaAs/GaAs self-assembled cylindrical quantum dot. Eigenenergies and\neigenvectors of up to six hole ground states were obtained - along with\ncorresponding one-hole orbital occupations - and discussed in context of the\nAufbau principle.\n  PACS numbers: 73.21.La, 81.07.Ta, 71.70.Gm\n", "  The plasma response to Resonant Magnetic Perturbations (RMPs) in ASDEX\nUpgrade is modeled with the non-linear resistive MHD code JOREK, using input\nprofiles that match those of the experiments as closely as possible. The RMP\nconfiguration for which Edge Localized Modes are best mitigated in experiments\nis related to the largest edge kink response observed near the X-point in\nmodeling. On the edge resonant surfaces $q = m/n$, the coupling between the m +\n2 kink component and the m resonant component is found to induce the\namplification of the resonant magnetic perturbation. The ergodicity and the\n3D-displacement near the X-point induced by the resonant amplification can only\npartly explain the density pumpout observed in experiments.\n", "  We investigate $B \\bar B$ systems by computing potentials of two static\nquarks in the presence of two quarks of finite mass using lattice QCD. By\nsolving the Schr\\\"odinger equation we check whether these potentials are\nsufficiently attractive to host bound states. Particular focus is put on the\nexperimentally most promising bottomonium-like tetraquark candidate $Z_b^\\pm$\nwith quantum numbers $I(J^P)=1(1^+)$.\n", "  Starting from a sigma-model for a doubled target-space geometry, we show that\nthe number of target-space dimensions can be reduced by half through a gauging\nprocedure. We apply this formalism to a class of backgrounds relevant for\ndouble field theory, and illustrate how choosing different gaugings leads to\nstring-theory configurations T-dual to each other. We furthermore discuss that\ngiven a conformal doubled theory, the reduced theories are conformal as well.\n  As an example we consider the three-dimensional SU(2) WZW model and show that\nthe only possible reduced backgrounds are the cigar and trumpet CFTs in two\ndimensions, which are indeed T-dual to each other.\n", "  The dispersion measure of extragalactic radio transients, such as of recently\ndiscovered Fast Radio Burst FRB150418, can be used to measure the column\ndensity of free electrons in the intergalactic medium. The same electrons also\nscatter the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons, affecting precision\nmeasurements of cosmological parameters. We explore the connection between the\ndispersion measure of radio transients existing during the Epoch of\nReionization (EoR) and the total optical depth for the CMB, $\\tau_{CMB}$,\nshowing that the existence of such transients would provide a new sensitive\nprobe of $\\tau_{CMB}$. As an example, we consider the population of FRBs.\nAssuming they exist during the EoR, we show that: (i) such sources can probe\nthe reionization history by measuring $\\tau_{CMB}$ to sub-percent accuracy, and\n(ii) they can be detected with high significance by an instrument such as the\nSquare Kilometer Array.\n", "  An azimuthally electric-polarized vector beam (APB), with a polarization\nvortex, has a salient feature that it contains a magnetic-dominant region\nwithin which electric field ideally has a null while longitudinal magnetic\nfield is maximum. Fresnel diffraction theory and plane-wave spectral (PWS)\ncalculations are applied to quantify field features of such a beam upon\nfocusing through a lens. The diffraction-limited full width at half maximum\n(FWHM) of the beam's longitudinal magnetic field intensity profile and\ncomplementary FWHM (CFWHM) of the beam's annular-shaped total electric field\nintensity profile are examined at the lens's focal plane as a function of the\nlens's paraxial focal distance. Then, we place a subwavelength dense dielectric\nMie scatterer in the minimum-waist plane of a self-standing converging APB and\ndemonstrate for the first time that a very high resolution magnetic field at\noptical frequency is achieved with total magnetic field FWHM of 0.23{\\lambda}\n(i.e., magnetic field spot area of 0.04{\\lambda}^2) within a magnetic-dominant\nregion. The theory shown here is valuable for development of optical microscopy\nand spectroscopy systems based on magnetic dipolar transitions which are in\ngeneral much weaker than their electric counterparts.\n", "  In this review many of the well known tools for the analysis of Complex\nsystems are used in order to study the global coupling of the turbulent\nconvection zone with the solar atmosphere where the magnetic energy is\ndissipated explosively. Several well documented observations are not easy to\ninterpret with the use of Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) and/or Kinetic numerical\ncodes. Such observations are: (1) The size distribution of the Active Regions\n(AR) on the solar surface, (2) The fractal and multi fractal characteristics of\nthe observed magnetograms, (3) The Self-Organised characteristics of the\nexplosive magnetic energy release and (4) the very efficient acceleration of\nparticles during the flaring periods in the solar corona. We review briefly the\nwork published the last twenty five years on the above issues and propose\nsolutions by using methods borrowed from the analysis of complex systems. The\nscenario which emerged is as follows: (a) The fully developed turbulence in the\nconvection zone generates and transports magnetic flux tubes to the solar\nsurface. Using probabilistic percolation models we were able to reproduce the\nsize distribution and the fractal properties of the emerged and randomly moving\nmagnetic flux tubes. (b) Using a Non Linear Force Free (NLFF) magnetic\nextrapolation numerical code we can explore how the emerged magnetic flux tubes\ninteract nonlinearly and form thin and Unstable Current Sheets (UCS) inside the\ncoronal part of the AR. (c) The fragmentation of the UCS and the redistribution\nof the magnetic field locally, when the local current exceeds a Critical\nthreshold, is a key process which drives avalanches and forms coherent\nstructures. This local reorganization of the magnetic field, enhances the\nenergy dissipation and influences the global evolution of the complex magnetic\ntopology.\n", "  We analyze the superconformal index of the N=3 supersymmetric Z_k generalized\norientifold theories recently proposed. In the large N limit we derive the\nindex from the Kaluza-Klein modes in AdS_5 x S^5/Z_k, which are obtained from\nones in AdS_5 x S^5 by a simple projection. For the ordinary Z_2 orientifold\ncase the agreement with the gauge theory calculation is explicitly confirmed,\nand for Z_k with k > 2 we perform a few consistency checks with known results\nfor N=3 theories. We also study finite N corrections by analyzing wrapped\nD3-branes and discrete torsions in the dual geometry.\n", "  Characterizing buried layers and interfaces is critical for a host of\napplications in nanoscience and nano-manufacturing. Here we demonstrate\nnon-invasive, non-destructive imaging of buried interfaces using a tabletop,\nextreme ultraviolet (EUV), coherent diffractive imaging (CDI) nanoscope. Copper\nnanostructures inlaid in SiO2 are coated with 100 nm of aluminum, which is\nopaque to visible light and thick enough that neither optical microscopy nor\natomic force microscopy can image the buried interfaces. Short wavelength (29\nnm) high harmonic light can penetrate the aluminum layer, yielding\nhigh-contrast images of the buried structures. Moreover, differences in the\nabsolute reflectivity of the interfaces before and after coating reveal the\nformation of interstitial diffusion and oxidation layers at the Al-Cu and\nAl-SiO2 boundaries. Finally, we show that EUV CDI provides a unique capability\nfor quantitative, chemically-specific imaging of buried structures, and the\nmaterial evolution that occurs at these buried interfaces, compared with all\nother approaches.\n", "  Contrary to the general belief, there has recently been quite a few examples\nof unitary evolution of quantum cosmological models. The present work gives\nmore examples, namely Bianchi type VI and type II. These examples are important\nas they involve varying spatial curvature unlike the most talked about\nhomogeneous but anisotropic cosmological models like Bianchi I, V and IX. We\nexhibit either explicit example of the unitary solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt\nequation, or at least show that a self-adjoint extension is possible.\n", "  The formation of coherent structures in noise driven phenomena and in\nTurbulence is a complex and fundamental question. A particulary important\nstructure is the so-called Rogue Wave (RW) that arises as the sudden appearance\nof a localized and giant peak. First studied in Oceanography, RWs have been\nextensively investigated in Optics since 2007, in particular in optical fibers\nexperiments on supercontinua and optical turbulence. However the typical time\nscales underlying the random dynamics in those experiments prevented --up to\nnow-- the direct observation of isolated RWs. Here we report on the direct\nobservation of RWs, using an ultrafast acquisition system equivalent to\nmicroscope in the time domain. The RWs are generated by nonlinear propagation\nof random waves inside an optical fiber, and recorded with $\\sim 250$~fs\nresolution. Our experiments demonstrate the central role played by\n\"breathers-like\" solutions of the one-dimensional nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger\nequation (1D-NLSE) in the formation of RWs\n", "  We apply parallel approaches in the study of continuous spectra to adiabatic\nstellar models. We seek continuum eigenmodes for the LAWE formulated as both\nfinite difference and linear differential equations. In particular, we apply\nmethods of Jacobi matrices and methods of subordinancy theory in these\nrespective formulations. We find certain pressure-density conditions which\nadmit positive-measured sets of continuous oscillation spectra under plausible\nconditions on density and pressure. We arrive at results of unbounded\noscillations and computational or, perhaps, dynamic instability.\n", "  A numerical investigation of two locally applied drag reducing control\nschemes is carried out in the configuration of a spatially developing turbulent\nboundary layer (TBL). One control is designed to damp near-wall turbulence and\nthe other induces constant mass flux in the wall-normal direction. Both control\nschemes yield similar local drag reduction rates within the control region.\nHowever, the flow development downstream of the control significantly differs:\npersistent drag reduction is found for the uniform blowing case whereas drag\nincrease is found for the turbulence damping case. In order to account for this\ndifference the formulation of a global drag reduction rate is suggested. It\nrepresents the reduction of the streamwise force exerted by the fluid on a\nfinite length plate. Furthermore, it is shown that the far downstream\ndevelopment of the TBL after the control region can be described by a single\nquantity, namely a streamwise shift of the uncontrolled boundary layer, i.e. a\nchanged virtual origin. Based on this result, a simple model is developed that\nallows relating for the local drag reduction rate to the global one without the\nneed of conducting expensive simulations or measurements far downstream of the\ncontrol region.\n", "  The metal--insulator transition (MIT) for the square, simple cubic, and\nbody-centered cubic lattices is investigated within the $t-t'$ Hubbard model at\nhalf-filling by using both the Hartree-Fock approximation (HFA) generalized for\nthe case of spiral order and Kotliar-Ruckenstein slave-boson approach. It turns\nout that magnetic scenario of MIT becomes superior over non-magnetic one. The\nelectron correlations lead to some suppression of the spiral phases in\ncomparison with HFA. We found the presence of metallic antiferromagnetic\n(spiral) phase in the case of three-dimensional lattices.\n", "  Spectrum Broadcast Structures are a new and fresh concept in the\nquantum-to-classical transition, introduced recently in the context of\ndecoherence and the appearance of objective features in quantum mechanics.\nThese are specific quantum state structures, responsible for an apparent\nobjectivity of a decohered state of a system. Recently they have been shown to\nappear in the well known Quantum Brownian Motion model, however the final\nanalysis relied on numerics. Here, after a presentation of the main concepts,\nwe perform analytical studies of the model, showing the timescales and the\nefficiency of the spectrum broadcast structure formation. We consider a massive\ncentral system and a somewhat simplified environment being random with a\nuniform distribution of the frequencies.\n", "  We discuss the transition paths in a coupled bistable system consisting of\ninteracting multiple identical bistable motifs. We propose a simple model of\ncoupled bistable gene circuits as an example, and show that its transition\npaths are bifurcating. We then derive a criterion to predict the bifurcation of\ntransition paths in a generalized coupled bistable system. We confirm the\nvalidity of the theory for the example system by numerical simulation. We also\ndemonstrate in the example system that, if the steady states of individual gene\ncircuits are not changed by the coupling, the bifurcation pattern is not\ndependent on the number of gene circuits. We further show that the transition\nrate exponentially decreases with the number of gene circuits when the\ntransition path does not bifurcate, while a bifurcation facilitates the\ntransition by lowering the quasi-potential energy barrier.\n", "  The recent detection by Advanced LIGO of gravitational waves (GW) from the\nmerging of a binary black hole system sets new limits on the merging rates of\nmassive primordial black holes (PBH) that could be a significant fraction or\neven the totality of the dark matter in the Universe. aLIGO opens the way to\nthe determination of the distribution and clustering of such massive PBH. If\nPBH clusters have a similar density to the one observed in ultra-faint dwarf\ngalaxies, we find merging rates comparable to aLIGO expectations. Massive PBH\ndark matter predicts the existence of thousands of those dwarf galaxies where\nstar formation is unlikely because of gas accretion onto PBH, which would\npossibly provide a solution to the missing satellite and too-big-to-fail\nproblems. Finally, we study the possibility of using aLIGO and future GW\nantennas to measure the abundance and mass distribution of PBH in the range [5\n- 200] Msun to 10\\% accuracy.\n", "  We study replication identities satisfied by conformal characters of a 2D\nCFT, providing a natural framework for a physics interpretation of the famous\nHauptmodul property of Monstrous Moonshine, and illustrate the underlying ideas\nin simple cases.\n", "  A hypothetic Hidden Sector of the Universe, consisting of sterile fermions\n(\"sterinos\") and sterile mediating bosons (\"sterons\") of mass dimension 1 (not\n2!) - the last described by an antisymmetric tensor field - requires to exist\nalso a scalar isovector and scalar isoscalar in order to be able to construct\nelectroweak invariant coupling (before spontaneously breaking its symmetry).\n", "  We propose, and illustrate via a neural network example, two different\napproaches to coarse-graining large heterogeneous networks. Both approaches are\ninspired from, and use tools developed in, methods for uncertainty\nquantification in systems with multiple uncertain parameters - in our case, the\nparameters are heterogeneously distributed on the network nodes. The approach\nshows promise in accelerating large scale network simulations as well as\ncoarse-grained fixed point, periodic solution and stability analysis. We also\ndemonstrate that the approach can successfully deal with structural as well as\nintrinsic heterogeneities.\n", "  GRB 050709 was the first short Gamma-ray Burst (sGRB) with an identified\noptical afterglow. In this work we report a re-analysis of the publicly\navailable data of this event and the discovery of a Li-Paczynski\nmacronova/kilonova that dominates the optical/IR signal at t $>$ 2.5 days. Such\na signal would arise from ~0.05 M$_\\odot$ r-process material launched by a\ncompact binary merger. The implied mass ejection supports the suggestion that\ncompact binary mergers are significant and possibly main sites of heavy\nr-process nucleosynthesis. We have re-analyzed all afterglow data from nearby\nshort and hybrid GRBs. A statistical study of sGRB/macronova connection reveals\nthat macronova may have taken place in all these GRBs though the fraction as\nlow as 0.18 cannot be ruled out. The identification of two of the three\nmacronova candidates in the I-band implies a more promising detection prospect\nfor ground-based surveys.\n", "  Gas separation of a binary gaseous mixture is one of characteristic phenomena\nin the micro-scale flows that differ from the conventional size flows. In this\nwork, the separation in a binary gas mixture flows through a microchannel is\ninvestigated by the lattice Boltzmann method with a diffuse-bounce-back (DBB)\nboundary condition. The separation degree and rate are measured in the He--Ar\nand Ne--Ar systems for different mole fractions, pressure ratios, and Knudsen\nnumbers. The results show that the separation phenomenon in the He--Ar mixture\nis more obvious than that in the Ne--Ar mixture at the same mole fraction owing\nto the larger molecular mass ratio. In addition, the increase in the pressure\nratio reduces the difference in the molecular velocities between the two\nspecies, and the separation phenomenon becomes weaker. However, the gas\nseparation is enhanced with an increase in the Knudsen number. This is because\nthe resulting rarefaction effect reduces the interactions between the gas\nmolecules of the two species, and thus increases the difference in the\nmolecular velocity.\n", "  Quantum Chromodynamics, the theory of strong interactions, predicts several\ntypes of bound states. Among them are mesons ($q\\bar{q}$) and baryons ($qqq$),\nwhich have been the only states observed in experiments for years. However, in\nthe last decade, many states that do not fit this picture have been observed at\n$B$-factories (BaBar, Belle and CLEO), at $\\tau$-charm facilities (CLEO-c,\nBESIII) and also at proton-proton colliders (CDF, D0, LHCb, ATLAS, CMS). There\nis growing evidence that at least some of the new charmonium- and\nbottomonium-like states, the so-called XYZ mesons, are new forms of matter such\nas quark-gluon hybrids, mesonic molecules or different arrangements of\ntetraquarks, pentaquarks... Effective Field Theories (EFTs) have been\nconstructed for heavy-quark-antiquark bound states, but a general study of the\nXYZ mesons within the same framework has not yet been done. The scope of this\nconference proceedings is to discuss the possibilities we have in developing\nnovel EFTs that, characterizing the conventional quarkonium states, facilitate\nalso the systematic and model-independent description of the new exotic matter,\nin particular, the hybrid mesons.\n", "  Control of electromagnetic waves using engineered materials is very important\nin a wide range of applications, therefore there is always a continuous need\nfor new and more efficient solutions. Known natural and artificial materials\nand surfaces provide a particular functionality in the frequency range they\noperate but cast a \"shadow\" and produce reflections at other frequencies. Here,\nwe introduce a concept of multifunctional engineered materials that possess\ndifferent predetermined functionalities at different frequencies. Such response\ncan be accomplished by cascading metasurfaces (thin composite layers) that are\ndesigned to perform a single operation at the desired frequency and are\ntransparent elsewhere. Previously, out-of-band transparent metasurfaces for\ncontrol over reflection and absorption were proposed. In this paper, to\ncomplete the full set of functionalities for wave control, we synthesize\ntransmitarrays that tailor transmission in a desired way, being \"invisible\"\nbeyond the operational band. The designed transmitarrays for wavefront shaping\nand anomalous refraction are tested numerically and experimentally. To\ndemonstrate our concept of multifunctional engineered materials, we have\ndesigned a cascade of three metasurfaces that performs three different\nfunctions for waves at different frequencies. Remarkably, applied to volumetric\nmetamaterials, our concept can enable a single composite possessing desired\nmultifunctional response.\n", "  The honeycomb-lattice ruthenate Li$_2$RuO$_3$ is made heavily Li-deficient by\nchemical oxidation by iodine. The delithiation triggers a different phase\nLi$_{2-x}$RuO$_3$, the \"D-phase\", with superlattice. For the first time we\ndisclose the magnetic and structural properties of the D-phase in the\ndimer-solid state. The low temperature magnetic susceptibility and the bond\nlengths indicate a bonding configuration consisting of both Ru$^{4+}$-Ru$^{4+}$\nand Ru$^{5+}$-Ru$^{5+}$ dimers.\n", "  Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are optically active layered\nmaterials providing potential for fast optoelectronics and on-chip photonics.\nWe demonstrate electrically driven single-photon emission from localised sites\nin tungsten diselenide (WSe2) and tungsten disulphide (WS2). To achieve this,\nwe fabricate a light emitting diode structure comprising single layer graphene,\nthin hexagonal boron nitride and TMD mono- and bi-layers. Photon correlation\nmeasurements are used to confirm the single-photon nature of the spectrally\nsharp emission. These results present the TMD family as a platform for hybrid,\nbroadband, atomically precise quantum photonics devices.\n", "  We consider RG flows obtained by a relevant deformation from unitary and\ncompact two-dimensional (0,2) SCFTs. We point out that an N=2 super-Kac-Moody\nalgebra present in the UV is preserved by the flow and does not mix with the\nR-current. On the other hand, a direct sum of N=2 algebras in the UV theory\nleads to a few complications in determining the IR R-symmetry; nevertheless, in\nflows without accidental IR symmetries, we determine the IR R-symmetry and show\nthat it maximizes the IR central charge.\n", "  The gravitational wave observations GW150914 and GW151226 by Advanced LIGO\nprovide the first opportunity to learn about physics in the extreme gravity\nenvironment of coalescing binary black holes. The LIGO Scientific Collaboration\nand the Virgo Collaboration have verified that this observation is consistent\nwith General Relativity. This paper expands their analysis to a larger class of\nanomalies, highlighting the inferences that can be drawn on non-standard\ntheoretical physics mechanisms. We find that these events constrain a plethora\nof mechanisms associated with the generation and propagation of gravitational\nwaves, including the activation of scalar fields, gravitational leakage into\nlarge extra dimensions, the variability of Newton's constant, a modified\ndispersion relation, gravitational Lorentz violation and the strong equivalence\nprinciple. Though other observations limit many of these mechanisms already,\nGW150914 and GW151226 are unique in that they are direct probes of dynamical\nstrong-field gravity and of gravitational wave propagation. We also show that\nGW150914 constrains inferred properties of exotic compact object alternatives\nto Kerr black holes. We argue, however, that the true potential for GW150914 to\nboth rule out exotic objects and constrain physics beyond General Relativity is\nseverely limited by the lack of understanding of the merger regime in almost\nall relevant modified gravity theories. This event thus significantly raises\nthe bar that these theories have to pass, both in terms of having a sound\ntheoretical underpinning, and being able to solve the equations of motion for\nbinary merger events. We conclude with a discussion of the additional\ninferences that can be drawn if the lower-confidence observation of an\nelectromagnetic counterpart to GW150914 holds true; this would provide dramatic\nconstraints on the speed of gravity and gravitational Lorentz violation.\n", "  Relative relocation methods are commonly used to precisely relocate\nearthquake clusters consisting of similar waveforms. Repeating waveforms are\noften recorded at volcanoes, where, however, the crust structure is expected to\ncontain strong heterogeneities and therefore the 1D velocity model assumption\nthat is made in most location strategies is not likely to describe reality. A\npeculiar cluster of repeating low-frequency seismic events was recorded on the\nsouth flank of Katla volcano (Iceland) from 2011. As the hypocentres are\nlocated at the rim of the glacier, the seismicity may be due to volcanic or\nglacial processes. Information on the size and shape of the cluster may help\nconstraining the source process. The extreme similarity of waveforms points to\na very small spatial distribution of hypocentres. In order to extract\nmeaningful information about size and shape of the cluster, we minimize\nuncertainty by optimizing the cross-correlation measurements and\nrelative-relocation process. With a synthetic test we determine the best\nparameters for differential-time measurements and estimate their uncertainties,\nspecifically for each waveform. We design a relocation strategy to work without\na predefined velocity model, by formulating and inverting the problem to seek\nchanges in both location and slowness, thus accounting for azimuth, take-off\nangles and velocity deviations from a 1D model. We solve the inversion\nexplicitly in order to propagate data errors through the calculation. With this\napproach we are able to resolve a source volume few tens of meters wide on\nhorizontal directions and around 100 meters in depth. There is no suggestion\nthat the hypocentres lie on a single fault plane and the depth distribution\nindicates that their source is unlikely to be related to glacial processes as\nthe ice thickness is not expected to exceed few tens of meters in the source\narea.\n", "  We summarize various cases where chaotic orbits can be described\nanalytically. First we consider the case of a magnetic bottle where we have\nnon-resonant and resonant ordered and chaotic orbits. In the sequence we\nconsider the hyperbolic Henon map, where chaos appears mainly around the\norigin, which is an unstable periodic orbit. In this case the chaotic orbits\naround the origin are represented by analytic series (Moser series). We find\nthe domain of convergence of these Moser series and of similar series around\nother unstable periodic orbits. The asymptotic manifolds from the various\nunstable periodic orbits intersect at homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits that\nare given analytically. Then we consider some Hamiltonian systems and we find\ntheir homoclinic orbits by using a new method of analytic prolongation. An\napplication of astronomical interest is the domain of convergence of the\nanalytical series that determine the spiral structure of barred-spiral\ngalaxies.\n", "  Heavy quarkonium hybrids are studied in an effective field theory framework.\nCoupled and uncoupled Schr\\\"odinger equations are obtained for different\nquantum numbers of the hybrid states. The results are discussed and compared to\nother approaches.\n", "  The role of ion polarisation and finite Larmor radius on the isotope effect\non turbulent tokamak edge transport and flows is investigated by means of local\nelectromagnetic multi-species gyro-fluid computations. Transport is found to be\nreduced with the effective plasma mass for protium, deuterium and tritium\nmixtures. This isotope effect is found for both cold and warm ion models, but\nsignificant influence of finite Larmor radius and polarisation effects are\nidentified. Sheared flow reduction of transport through self generated\nturbulent zonal flows and geodesic acoustic modes in the present model (not\nincluding neoclassical flows) is found to play only a minor role on regulating\nisotopically improved confinement.\n", "  From a grammar point of view, the role of punctuation marks in a sentence is\nformally defined and well understood. In semantic analysis punctuation plays\nalso a crucial role as a method of avoiding ambiguity of the meaning. A\ndifferent situation can be observed in the statistical analyses of language\nsamples, where the decision on whether the punctuation marks should be\nconsidered or should be neglected is seen rather as arbitrary and at present it\nbelongs to a researcher's preference. An objective of this work is to shed some\nlight onto this problem by providing us with an answer to the question whether\nthe punctuation marks may be treated as ordinary words and whether they should\nbe included in any analysis of the word co-occurences. We already know from our\nprevious study (S.~Dro\\.zd\\.z {\\it et al.}, Inf. Sci. 331 (2016) 32-44) that\nfull stops that determine the length of sentences are the main carrier of\nlong-range correlations. Now we extend that study and analyze statistical\nproperties of the most common punctuation marks in a few Indo-European\nlanguages, investigate their frequencies, and locate them accordingly in the\nZipf rank-frequency plots as well as study their role in the word-adjacency\nnetworks. We show that, from a statistical viewpoint, the punctuation marks\nreveal properties that are qualitatively similar to the properties of the most\nfrequent words like articles, conjunctions, pronouns, and prepositions. This\nrefers to both the Zipfian analysis and the network analysis. By adding the\npunctuation marks to the Zipf plots, we also show that these plots that are\nnormally described by the Zipf-Mandelbrot distribution largely restore the\npower-law Zipfian behaviour for the most frequent items.\n", "  The TauSpinner algorithm allows to modify the physics of the Monte Carlo\ngenerated samples due to the changed assumptions of event production dynamics,\nwithout re-generating events. To each event it attributes weights: the spin\neffects of tau-lepton production or decay, or the production mechanism are\nmodified. There is no need to repeat the detector response simulation. We\ndocument the extension to 2 to 4 processes in which the matrix elements for the\nparton-parton scattering amplitudes into a tau-lepton pair and two outgoing\npartons are used. Tree-level matrix elements for the Standard Model processes,\nincluding the Higgs boson production are used. Automatically generated codes by\nMadGraph5 have been adapted. Tests of the matrix elements, reweighting\nalgorithm and numerical results are presented. For averaged tau lepton\npolarisation, we perform comparison of 2 to 2 and 2 to 4 matrix elements used\nto calculate the spin weight in pp to tau tau j j events. We show, that for\nevents with tau-lepton pair close to the Z-boson peak, the tau-lepton\npolarisation calculated using 2 to 4 matrix elements is very close to the one\ncalculated using 2 to 2 Born process only. For the m_(tautau) masses above the\nZ-boson peak, the effect from including 2 to 4 matrix elements is also\nmarginal, however when restricting into subprocesses qq,q bar q to tau tau j j\nonly, it can lead to a 10% difference on the predicted tau-lepton polarisation.\nChoice of electroweak scheme can have significant impact. The modification of\nthe electroweak or strong interaction can be performed with the re-weighting\ntechnique. TauSpinner v.2.0.0, allows to introduce non-standard couplings for\nthe Higgs boson and study their effects in the vector-boson-fusion. The\ndiscussion is relegated to forthcoming publications.\n", "  We analyse the impact of the statistical uncertainties of the the\nnucleon-nucleon interaction, based on the Granada-2013 np-pp database, on the\nbinding energies of the triton and the alpha particle using a bootstrap method,\nby solving the Faddeev equations for $^3$H and the Yakubovsky equations for\n$^4$He respectively. We check that in practice about 30 samples prove enough\nfor a reliable error estimate. An extrapolation of the well fulfilled Tjon-line\ncorrelation predicts the experimental binding of the alpha particle within\nuncertainties.\n", "  Filming and controlling plasmons at buried interfaces with nanometer (nm) and\nfemtosecond (fs) resolution has yet to be achieved and is critical for next\ngeneration plasmonic/electronic devices. In this work, we use light to excite\nand shape a plasmonic interference pattern at a buried metal-dielectric\ninterface in a nanostructured thin film. Plasmons are launched from a\nphotoexcited array of nanocavities and their propagation is filmed via\nphoton-induced near-field electron microscopy (PINEM). The resulting movie\ndirectly captures the plasmon dynamics, allowing quantification of their group\nvelocity at approximately 0.3c, consistent with our theoretical predictions.\nFurthermore, we show that the light polarization and nanocavity design can be\ntailored to shape transient plasmonic gratings at the nanoscale. These results,\ndemonstrating dynamical imaging with PINEM, pave the way for the fs/nm\nvisualization and control of plasmonic fields in advanced heterostructures\nbased on novel 2D materials such as graphene, MoS$_2$, and ultrathin metal\nfilms.\n", "  We investigate the microwave magnetic field confinement in several microwave\n3D-cavities, using 3D finite-element analysis to determine the best design and\nachieve strong coupling between microwave resonant cavity photons and solid\nstate spins. Specifically, we design cavities for achieving strong coupling of\nelectromagnetic modes with an ensemble of nitrogen vacancy (NV) defects in\ndiamond. We report here a novel and practical cavity design with a magnetic\nfilling factor of up to 4 times (2 times higher collective coupling) than\npreviously achieved using 1D superconducting cavities with small mode volume.\nIn addition, we show that by using a double-split resonator cavity, it is\npossible to achieve up to 200 times better cooperative factor than the\ncurrently demonstrated with NV in diamond. These designs open up further\nopportunities for studying strong and ultra-strong coupling effects on spins in\nsolids using alternative systems with a wider range of design parameters.\n", "  We develop a model for the coupling of quasi-normal modes in open photonic\nsystems consisting of two resonators. By expressing the modes of the coupled\nsystem as a linear combination of the modes of the individual particles, we\nobtain a generalized eigenvalue problem involving small size dense matrices. We\napply this technique to dielectric rod dimmer of rectangular cross section for\nTransverse Electric (TE) polarization in a two-dimensional (2D) setup. The\nresults of our model show excellent agreement with full-wave finite element\nsimulations. We provide a convergence analysis, and a simplified model with a\nfew modes to study the influence of the relative position of the two\nresonators. This model provides interesting physical insights on the coupling\nscheme at stake in such systems and pave the way for systematic and efficient\ndesign and optimization of resonances in more complicated systems, for\napplications including sensing, antennae and spectral filtering.\n", "  We investigate the Pleba\\'nski class of electrodynamical theories, i.e.,\ntheories of nonlinear vacuum electrodynamics that derive from a\nLorentz-invariant Lagrangian (or Hamiltonian). In any such theory the light\nrays are the lightlike geodesics of two optical metrics that depend on the\nelectromagnetic background field. A set of necessary and sufficient conditions\nis found whose fulfillment secures that the optical metrics are causal in the\nsense that the light rays are lightlike or timelike with respect to the\nunderlying space-time metric. Thereupon we derive conditions on the Lagrangian,\nor the Hamiltonian, of the theory such that the causality conditions are\nsatisfied for all background fields. (The allowed values of the field strength\ntensor are those for which the excitation tensor is finite and real.) The\ngeneral results are illustrated with several examples.\n", "  Quantum gravity may have as much to tell us about the foundations and\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics as it does about gravity. The Copenhagen\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics and Everett's Relative State Formulation\nare complementary descriptions which in a sense are dual to one another. My\npurpose here is to discuss this duality in the light of the of ER=EPR\nconjecture.\n", "  We experimentally and theoretically investigate injection locking of quantum\ndot (QD) microlasers in the regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED). We\nobserve frequency locking and phase-locking where cavity enhanced spontaneous\nemission enables simultaneous stable oscillation at the master frequency and at\nthe solitary frequency of the slave microlaser. Measurements of the\nsecond-order autocorrelation function prove this simultaneous presence of both\nmaster and slave-like emission, where the former has coherent character with\n$g^{(2)}(0)=1$ while the latter one has thermal character with $g^{(2)}(0)=2$.\nSemi-classical rate-equations explain this peculiar behavior by cavity enhanced\nspontaneous emission and a low number of photons in the laser mode.\n", "  Migration of planetary systems caused by the action of dissipative forces may\nlead the planets to be trapped in a resonance. In this work we study the\nconditions and the dynamics of such resonant trapping. Particularly, we are\ninterested in finding out whether resonant capture ends up in a long-term\nstable planetary configuration. For two planet systems we associate the\nevolution of migration with the existence of families of periodic orbits in the\nphase space of the three-body problem. The family of circular periodic orbits\nexhibits a gap at the 2:1 resonance and an instability and bifurcation at the\n3:1 resonance. These properties explain the high probability of 2:1 and 3:1\nresonant capture at low eccentricities. Furthermore, we study the resonant\ncapture of three-planet systems. We show that such a resonant capture is\npossible and can occur under particular conditions. Then, from the migration\npath of the system, stable three-planet configurations, either symmetric or\nasymmetric, can be determined.\n", "  Background: Atomic spectral lines from different isotopes display a small\nshift in energy, commonly referred to as the line isotope shift. One of the\ncomponents of the isotope shift is the field shift, which depends on the extent\nand the shape of the nuclear charge density distribution. Purpose: To\ninvestigate how sensitive field shifts are with respect to variations in the\nnuclear size and shape and what information of nuclear charge distributions\nthat can be extracted from measured field shifts. Methods: Nuclear properties\nare obtained from nuclear density functional theory calculations based on the\nSkyrme-Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approach. These results are combined with\nmulticonfiguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock methods to obtain realistic field shifts.\nResults: Phenomena such as nuclear deformation and variations in the\ndiffuseness of nuclear charge distributions give measurable contributions to\nthe field shifts. Using a novel approach, we demonstrate the possibility to\nextract new information concerning the nuclear charge densities from the\nobserved field shifts. Conclusions: Combining methods used in atomic and\nnuclear structure theory gives an improved description of field shifts.\nExtracting additional nuclear information from measured field shifts is\npossible in the near future with improved experimental methods.\n", "  The scaling of the fundamental limits of the second hyperpolarizability is\nused to define the intrinsic second hyperpolarizability, which aids in\nidentifying material classes with ultralarge nonlinear-optical response per\nunit of molecular size. The intrinsic nonlinear response is a size-independent\nmetric that we apply to comparing classes of molecular homologues, which are\nmade by adding repeat units to extend their lengths. Several new figures of\nmerit are proposed that quantify not only the intrinsic nonlinear response, but\nalso how the second hyperpolarizability increases with size within a molecular\nclass. Scaling types can be classified into sub-scaling, nominal scaling that\nfollows the theory of limits, and super-scaling behavior. Super-scaling\nhomologues that have large intrinsic nonlinearity are the most promising\nbecause they efficiently take advantage of increased size. We apply our\napproach to data in the literature to identify the best super-scaling molecular\nparadigms and articulate the important underlying parameters.\n", "  We apply scaling and the theory of the fundamental limits of the second-order\nmolecular susceptibility to identify material classes with ultralarge\nnonlinear-optical response. Size effects are removed by normalizing all\nnonlinearities to get intrinsic values so that the scaling behavior of a series\nof molecular homologues can be determined. Several new figures of merit are\nproposed that quantify the desirable properties for molecules that can be\ndesigned by adding a sequence of repeat units, and used in the assessment of\nthe data. Three molecular classes are found. They are characterized by\nsub-scaling, nominal scaling, or super-scaling. Super-scaling homologues most\nefficiently take advantage of increased size. We apply our approach to data\ncurrently available in the literature to identify the best super-scaling\nmolecular paradigms with the aim of identifying desirable traits of new\nmaterials.\n", "  The quantum oscillator and Kepler-Coulomb problems in $d$-dimensional spaces\nwith constant curvature are analyzed from several viewpoints. In a deformed\nsupersymmetric framework, the corresponding nonlinear potentials are shown to\nexhibit a deformed shape invariance property. By using the point canonical\ntransformation method, the two deformed Schr\\\"odinger equations are mapped onto\nconventional ones corresponding to some shape-invariant potentials, whose\nrational extensions are well known. The inverse point canonical transformations\nthen provide some rational extensions of the oscillator and Kepler-Coulomb\npotentials in curved space. The oscillator on the sphere and the Kepler-Coulomb\npotential in a hyperbolic space are studied in detail and their extensions are\nproved to be consistent with already known ones in Euclidean space. The\npartnership between nonextended and extended potentials is interpreted in a\ndeformed supersymmetric framework. Those extended potentials that are\nisospectral to some nonextended ones are shown to display deformed shape\ninvariance, which in the Kepler-Coulomb case is enlarged by also translating\nthe degree of the polynomial arising in the rational part denominator.\n", "  Coalescence is an important hydrodynamic event that frequently takes place in\nnature as well as in industry. Here we provide an experimental study on short\ntime dynamics of water coalescence, particularly when a water droplet comes in\ncontact with a flat water surface, by utilizing high-resolution\nhigh-penetration ultrafast X-ray microscopy. Our results demonstrate a\npossibility that an extreme curvature difference between a drop and a flat\nsurface can significantly modify the hydrodynamics of water coalescence, which\nis unexpected in the existing theory. We suggest a plausible explanation for\nwhy coalescence can be modified by an extreme curvature difference.\n", "  The extended Linear Sigma Model (eLSM) is an effective model of QCD which\nincludes in the mesonic sector (pseudo)scalar and (axial-)vector quarkonia\nmesons as well as one dilaton/glueball field and in the baryonic sector the\nnucleon doublet and its chiral partner in the mirror assignment. The chiral\npartner of the pion turns out to be the resonance $f_{0}(1370),$ which is then\npredominantly a quarkonium state. As a consequence, $f_{0}(500)$ is\npredominately not a quarkonium state but a four-quark object and is at first\nnot part of the model. Yet, $f_{0}(500)$ is important in the baryonic sector\nand affects nuclear matter saturation, the high-density behavior, and\nnucleon-nucleon scattering. In these proceedings, we show how to enlarge the\ntwo-flavour version of the eLSM in order to include the four-quark field\n$f_{0}(500)$ in a chiral invariant manner. We then discuss homogeneous and\ninhomogeneous chiral restoration in a dense medium.\n", "  We study three-flavor octet baryons by using the so-called extended Linear\nSigma Model (eLSM). Within a quark-diquark picture, the requirement of a mirror\nassignment naturally leads to the consideration of four spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$\nbaryon multiplets. A reduction of the Lagrangian to the two-flavor case leaves\nfour doublets of nucleonic states which mix to form the experimentally observed\nstates $N(939)$, $N(1440)$, $N(1535)$ and $N(1650)$. We determine the\nparameters of the nucleonic part of the Lagrangian from a fit to masses and\ndecay properties of the aforementioned states. By tracing their masses when\nchiral symmetry is restored, we conclude that the pairs $N(939)$, $N(1535)$ and\n$N(1440)$, $N(1650)$ form chiral partners.\n", "  We tune the dimensionality of pancake-shaped strongly-interacting $^6$Li\nFermi gas clouds from two-dimensional (2D) to quasi-2D, by controlling the\nratio of the radial Fermi energy $E_F$ to the harmonic oscillator energy\n$h\\nu_z$ in the tightly confined direction. In the 2D regime, where\n$E_F<<h\\nu_z$, the measured radio frequency resonance spectra are in agreement\nwith 2D-BCS theory. In the quasi-2D regime, where $E_F\\simeq h\\nu_z$, the\nmeasured spectra deviate significantly from 2D-BCS theory. For both regimes,\nthe measured cloud radii disagree with 2D-BCS mean field theory, but agree\napproximately with predictions using a free energy derived from the\nBethe-Goldstone equation.\n", "  We study three properties of a holographic superconductor related to\nconductivities, where momentum relaxation plays an important role. First, we\nfind that there are constraints between electric, thermoelectric and thermal\nconductivities. The constraints are analytically derived by the Ward identities\nregarding diffeomorphism from field theory perspective. We confirm them by\nnumerically computing all two-point functions from holographic perspective.\nSecond, we investigate Homes' law and Uemura's law for various high-temperature\nand conventional superconductors. They are empirical and (material independent)\nuniversal relations between the superfluid density at zero temperature, the\ntransition temperature, and the electric DC conductivity right above the\ntransition temperature. In our model, it turns out that the Homes' law does not\nhold but the Uemura's law holds at small momentum relaxation related to\ncoherent metal regime. Third, we explicitly show that the DC electric\nconductivity is finite for a neutral scalar instability while it is infinite\nfor a complex scalar instability. This shows that the neutral scalar\ninstability has nothing to do with superconductivity as expected.\n", "  In this analysis we explore the phenomenological constraints of models with\nnon-holomorphic soft SUSY breaking terms in a beyond the MSSM scenario having\nidentical particle content. The model referred as NHSSM shows various promising\nfeatures like the possibility of a strong reduction in electroweak fine-tuning\neven for a scenario of a heavy higgsino type of LSP, a fact that is unavailable\nin pMSSM models. The other important aspect is satisfying the muon $g-2$ data\neven for a small $\\tan\\beta$ via a small value of coupling $A_\\mu'$ associated\nwith the tri-linear non-holomorphic soft term. Thus, a large SUSY contribution\nto muon $g-2$ is possible even for a significantly large smuon mass $m_{\\tilde\n{\\mu_1}}$. The Higgs mass radiative corrections are contributed by both the\nholomorphic and non-holomorphic trilinear soft parameters $A_t$ and $A_t'$,\nthus diluting the requirement to have a larger $A_t$ to satisfy the Higgs mass\ndata. The model also provides with valid parameter space satisfying the\nconstraint of $B \\rightarrow X_s +\\gamma$ for large values of $\\tan\\beta$, a\nscenario unfavourable in pMSSM.\n", "  What happens when the time evolution of a fluctuating interface is\ninterrupted with resetting to a given initial configuration after random time\nintervals $\\tau$ distributed as a power-law $\\sim \\tau^{-(1+\\alpha)};~\\alpha >\n0$? For an interface of length $L$ in one dimension, and an initial flat\nconfiguration, we show that depending on $\\alpha$, the dynamics as $L \\to\n\\infty$ exhibits a rich long-time behavior. Without resetting, the interface\nwidth grows unbounded with time as $t^\\beta$, where $\\beta$ is the so-called\ngrowth exponent. We show that introducing resetting induces for $\\alpha>1$ and\nat long times fluctuations that are bounded in time. Corresponding to such a\nstationary state is a distribution of fluctuations that is strongly\nnon-Gaussian, with tails decaying as a power-law. The distribution exhibits a\ncusp for small argument, implying that the stationary state is out of\nequilibrium. For $\\alpha<1$, resetting is unable to counter the otherwise\nunbounded growth of fluctuations in time, so that the distribution of\nfluctuations remains time dependent with an ever-increasing width even at long\ntimes. Although stationary for $\\alpha>1$, the width of the interface grows\nforever with time as a power-law for $1<\\alpha < \\alpha^{({\\rm w})}$, and\nconverges to a finite constant only for larger $\\alpha$, thereby exhibiting a\ncrossover at $\\alpha^{({\\rm w})}=1+2\\beta$. The time-dependent distribution of\nfluctuations for $\\alpha<1$ exhibits for small argument another interesting\ncrossover behavior, from cusp to divergence, across $\\alpha^{({\\rm\nd})}=1-\\beta$. We demonstrate these results by exact analytical results for the\nparadigmatic Edwards-Wilkinson (EW) dynamical evolution of the interface, and\nfurther corroborate our findings by extensive numerical simulations of\ninterface models in the EW and the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class.\n", "  The statistical thermodynamics of binary mixtures of polyatomic species was\ndeveloped on a generalization in the spirit of the lattice-gas model and the\nquasi-chemical approximation (QCA). The new theoretical framework is obtained\nby combining: (i) the exact analytical expression for the partition function of\nnon-interacting mixtures of linear $k$-mers and $l$-mers (species occupying $k$\nsites and $l$ sites, respectively) adsorbed in one dimension, and its extension\nto higher dimensions; and (ii) a generalization of the classical QCA for\nmulticomponent adsorbates and multisite-occupancy adsorption. The process is\nanalyzed through the partial adsorption isotherms corresponding to both species\nof the mixture. Comparisons with analytical data from Bragg-Williams\napproximation (BWA) and Monte Carlo simulations are performed in order to test\nthe validity of the theoretical model. Even though a good fitting is obtained\nfrom BWA, it is found that QCA provides a more accurate description of the\nphenomenon of adsorption of interacting polyatomic mixtures.\n", "  Using the recently advanced Galilean gauge theory (GGT) we give a\ncomprehensive construction of torsional Newton Cartan geometry. The coupling of\na Galilean symmetric model with background NC geometry following GGT is\nillustrated by a free nonrelativistic scalar field theory. The issue of spatial\ndiffeomorphisn \\cite{SW, BMM3} is focussed from a new angle. The expression of\nthe torsionful connection is worked out which is in complete parallel with the\nrelativistic theory. Also smooth transition of the connection to its well known\ntorsionless expression is demonstrated. A complete (implicit) expression of the\ntorsion tensor for the Newton Cartan spacetime is provided where the first\norder variables occur in a suggestive way. The well known result for the\ntemporal part of torsion is reproduced from our expression.\n", "  By direct magnetization measurements, performed employing a new detection\nscheme, we demonstrate an electrical control of magnetization in wurtzite\n(Ga,Mn)N. In this dilute magnetic insulator the Fermi energy is pinned by Mn\nions in the mid-gap region, and the Mn3+ ions show strong single-ion\nanisotropy. We establish that (Ga,Mn)N sustains an electric field up to at\nleast 5 MV/cm, indicating that Mn doping turns GaN into a worthwhile\nsemi-insulating material. Under these conditions, the magnetoelectric coupling\nmay be driven by the inverse piezoelectric effect that stretches the elementary\ncell along the c axis and, thus, affects the magnitude of magnetic anisotropy.\nWe develop a corresponding theory and show that it describes the experimentally\ndetermined dependence of magnetization on the electric field quantitatively\nwith no adjustable parameters as a function of the magnetic field and\ntemperature. In this way, our work bridges two research domains developed so\nfar independently: piezoelectricity of wurtzite semiconductors and electrical\ncontrol of magnetization in hybrid and composite magnetic structures containing\npiezoelectric components.\n", "  In this work the SMASH model is presented (\"Simulating Many Accelerated\nStrongly-Interacting Hadrons\"), a next-generation hadronic transport approach,\nwhich is designed to describe the non-equilibrium evolution of hadronic matter\nin heavy-ion collisions. We discuss first dilepton spectra obtained with SMASH\nin the few-GeV energy range of GSI/FAIR, where the dynamics of hadronic matter\nis dominated by the production and decay of various resonance states. In\nparticular we show how electromagnetic transition form factors can emerge in a\ntransport picture under the hypothesis of vector-meson dominance.\n", "  Motivated to understand the behavior of biological filaments interacting with\nmembranes of various types, we study a theoretical model for the shape and\nthermodynamics of intrinsically-helical filaments bound to curved membranes. We\nshow filament-surface interactions lead to a host of non-uniform shape\nequilibria, in which filaments progressively unwind from their native twist\nwith increasing surface interaction and surface curvature, ultimately adopting\nuniform-contact curved shapes. The latter effect is due to non-linear coupling\nbetween elastic twist and bending of filaments on anisotropically-curved\nsurfaces, such as the cylindrical surfaces considered here. Via a combination\nof numerical solutions and asymptotic analysis of shape equilibria we show that\nfilament conformations are critically sensitive to the surface curvature in\nboth the strong- and weak-binding limits. These results suggest that local\nstructure of membrane-bound chiral filaments is generically sensitive to the\ncurvature-radius of the surface to which it is bound, even when that radius is\nmuch larger than the filament intrinsic pitch. Typical values of elastic\nparameters and interaction energies for several prokaryotic and eukaryotic\nfilaments indicate that biopolymers are inherently very sensitive to the\ncoupling between twist, interactions and geometry and that this could be\nexploited for regulation of a variety of processes such as the targeted\nexertion of forces, signaling and self-assembly in response to geometric cues\nincluding the local mean and Gaussian curvatures.\n", "  In the light of the new 13 TeV dilepton data set with $ 3.2\\, {\\rm fb^{-1}}$\nintegrated luminosity from the ATLAS collaboration, we derive limits on the\n$Z^{\\prime}$ mass in the context of left-right symmetric models and exploit the\ncomplementarity with dijet and $lljj$ data, as well as neutrinoless double beta\ndecay. We keep the ratio of the left- and right-handed gauge coupling free in\norder to take into account different patterns of left-right symmetry breaking.\nBy combining the dielectron and dimuon data we can exclude $Z^{\\prime}$ masses\nbelow $3$ TeV for $g_R=g_L$, and for $g_R \\sim 1$ we rule out masses up to\n$\\sim 4$ TeV. Those comprise the strongest direct bounds on the $Z^{\\prime}$\nmass from left-right models up to date. We show that in the usual plane of\nright-handed neutrino and charged gauge boson mass, dilepton data can probe a\nregion of parameter space inaccessible to neutrinoless double beta decay and\n$lljj$ studies. Lastly, through the mass relation between $W_R$ and\n$Z^{\\prime}$ we present an indirect bound on the lifetime of neutrinoless\ndouble beta decay using dilepton data. Our results prove that the often ignored\ndilepton data in the context of left-right models actually provide important\ncomplementary limits.\n", "  We investigate the discovery potential of singly produced top-philic\nresonances at the high luminosity (HL) LHC in the four-top final state. Our\nanalysis spans over the fully-hadronic, semi-leptonic, and same-sign dilepton\nchannels where we present concrete search strategies adequate to a boosted\nkinematic regime and high jet-multiplicity environments. We utilize the\nTemplate Overlap Method (TOM) with newly developed template observables for\ntagging boosted top quarks, a large-radius jet variable $M_J$ and customized\nb-tagging tactics for background discrimination. Our results show that the\nsame-sign dilepton channel gives the best sensitivity among the considered\nchannels, with an improvement of significance up to 10%-20% when combined with\nboosted-top tagging. Both the fully-hadronic and semi-leptonic channels yield\ncomparable discovery potential and contribute to further enhancements in the\nsensitivity by combining all channels. Finally, we show the sensitivity of a\ntop-philic resonance at the LHC and HL-LHC by showing the $2\\sigma$ exclusion\nlimit and $5\\sigma$ discovery reach, including a combination of all three\nchannels.\n", "  Renormalization Group (RG) theory provides the theoretical framework to\ndefine Effective Theories (ETs), i.e. systematic low-resolution approximations\nof arbitrary microscopic models. Markov State Models (MSMs) are shown to be\nrigorous ETs for Molecular Dynamics (MD). Based on this fact, we use Real Space\nRG to vary the resolution of a MSM and define an algorithm for clustering\nmicrostates into macrostates. The result is a lower dimensional stochastic\nmodel which, by construction, provides the optimal coarse-grained Markovian\nrepresentation of the system's relaxation kinetics. To illustrate and validate\nour theory, we analyze a number of test systems of increasing complexity,\nranging from synthetic toy models to two realistic applications, built form\nall-atom MD simulations. The computational cost of computing the\nlow-dimensional model remains affordable on a desktop computer even for\nthousands of microstates.\n", "  Various new physics models, e.g., theories of compositeness, can accommodate\nthe color singlet excited leptons that interact with the leptons, quarks,\nleptoquarks, etc. A particular type of excited lepton, which at low energies\ninteracts with the Standard Model fermions mainly through the four-fermion\ncoupling to lepton and quark-antiquark (or lepton-antilepton) pair, we call\nleptomeson. These new particles may contribute to variety of the experimental\nanomalies such as the discrepancy in the muon g-2. We propose that the\nleptomesons can generate also the baryon asymmetry that explains the imbalance\nin ordinary matter and antimatter in the observable universe. We consider the\ntwo types of scenarios for this baryogenesis via leptogenesis to occur from\neither leptomeson oscillations or decays. Both possibilities do not contradict\nto the small masses of the observable neutrinos and the proton stability.\nMoreover they can be relevant for the near future collider experiments and do\nnot suffer from the gravitino problem.\n", "  This paper demonstrates a possible new microfiber bio near field lens that\nuses minor ampullate spider silk,spun from the Nephila edulis spider, to create\na real time image of a surface using near field optical techniques. The\nmicrofiber bio lens is the world's first natural superlens created by exploring\nbiological materials. The resolution of the surface image overcomes the\ndiffraction limit, with the ability to resolve patterns at 100 nm under a\nstandard white light source in reflection mode. This resolution offers further\ndevelopments in superlens technology and paves the way for new bio optics.\n", "  We present a numerical solution of the quantum Lenard-Balescu equation using\na spectral method, namely an expansion in Laguerre polynomials. This method\nexactly conserves both particles and energy and facilitates the integration\nover the dielectric function. To demonstrate the method, we solve the\nequilibration problem for a spatially homogeneous one-component plasma with\nvarious initial conditions. Unlike the more usual Landau/Fokker-Planck system,\nthis method requires no input Coulomb logarithm; the logarithmic terms in the\ncollision integral arise naturally from the equation along with the\nnon-logarithmic order-unity terms. The spectral method can also be used to\nsolve the Landau equation and a quantum version of the Landau equation in which\nthe integration over the wavenumber requires only a lower cutoff. We solve\nthese problems as well and compare them with the full Lenard-Balescu solution\nin the weak-coupling limit. Finally, we discuss the possible generalization of\nthis method to include spatial inhomogeneity and velocity anisotropy.\n", "  We study the quantum mechanics of magnetic skyrmions in the vicinity of the\nskyrmion-crystal to ferromagnet phase boundary in two-dimensional magnets. We\nshow that the skyrmion excitation has an energy dispersion that splits into\nmultiple bands due to the combination of magnus force and the underlying\nlattice. Condensation of the skyrmions can give rise to an intermediate phase\nbetween the skyrmion crystal and ferromagnet: a quantum liquid, in which\nskyrmions are not spatially localized. We show that the critical behavior\ndepends on the spin size $S$ and the topological number of the skyrmion.\nExperimental signatures of quantum skyrmions in inelastic neutron-scattering\nmeasurements are also discussed.\n", "  We show that the proposed Large Hadron electron Collider (LHeC) will provide\nan opportunity to search for left-right symmetry and establish lepton number\nviolation, complementing current and planned searches based on LHC data and\nneutrinoless double beta decay. We consider several plausible configurations\nfor the LHeC -- including different electron energies and polarizations, as\nwell as distinct values for the charge misidentification rate. Within\nleft-right symmetric theories we determine the values of right-handed neutrino\nand gauge boson masses that could be tested at the LHeC after one, five and ten\nyears of operation. Our results indicate that this collider might probe, via\nthe $\\Delta L =2$ signal $e^-p\\to e^+jjj$, Majorana neutrino masses up to 1 TeV\nand $W_R$ masses up to 6.5 TeV. Interestingly, part of this parameter space is\nbeyond the expected reach of the LHC and of future neutrinoless double beta\ndecay experiments.\n", "  We reveal through extensive DFT calculations, confronted to key experimental\nfacts, the hidden penta-silicene nature of single and double strand chiral Si\nnanoribbons perfectly aligned on Ag(110) surfaces, that were discovered in\n2005, but whose structure remained elusive. We thus simultaneously demonstrate\nthe existence of penta-silicene, a recently conjectured novel pentagonal\nsilicon allotrope, which remained unveiled for 11 years, and which materializes\na paradigmatic shift from normal hexagonal silicene.\n", "  In quantum information science, the external control of qubits must be\nbalanced with the extreme isolation of the qubits from the environment. Atomic\nqubit systems typically mitigate this balance through the use of gated laser\nfields that can create superpositions and entanglement between qubits. Here we\npropose the use of high-order optical Stark shifts from optical fields to\nmanipulate the splitting of atomic qubits that are insensitive to other types\nof fields. We demonstrate a fourth-order AC Stark shift in a trapped atomic ion\nsystem that does not require extra laser power beyond that needed for other\ncontrol fields. We individually address a chain of tightly-spaced trapped ions\nand show how these controlled shifts can produce an arbitrary product state of\nten ions as well as generate site-specific magnetic field terms in a simulated\nspin Hamiltonian.\n", "  Over the last two decades, intensive research efforts have been devoted to\nthe suppressions of photoluminescence (PL) blinking and Auger recombination in\nmetal-chalcogenide nanocrystals (NCs), with significant progresses being made\nonly very recently in several specific heterostructures. Here we show that\nnonblinking PL is readily available in the newly-synthesized perovskite CsPbI3\n(cesium lead iodide) NCs, and their Auger recombination of charged excitons is\ngreatly slowed down, as signified by a PL lifetime about twice shorter than\nthat of neutral excitons. Moreover, spectral diffusion is completely absent in\nsingle CsPbI3 NCs at the cryogenic temperature, leading to a resolution-limited\nPL linewidth of ~200 {\\mu}eV.\n", "  Hamamatsu single anode R7761 and multi-anode R5900-00-M16 Photomultiplier\nTubes have been characterized for use in a Secondary Emission (SE) Ionization\nCalorimetry study. SE Ionization Calorimetry is a novel technique to measure\nelectromagnetic shower particles in extreme radiation environments. The\ndifferent operation modes used in these tests were developed by modifying the\nconventional PMT bias circuit. These modifications were simple changes to the\narrangement of the voltage dividers of the baseboard circuits. The PMTs with\nmodified bases, referred to as operating in SE mode, are used as an SE detector\nmodule in an SE calorimeter prototype, and placed between absorber materials\n(Fe, Cu, Pb, W, etc.). Here, the technical design of different operation modes,\nas well as the characterization measurements of both SE modes and the\nconventional PMT mode are reported.\n", "  We propose a new approach for generating synthetic earthquake catalogues\nbased on the physics of soft glasses. The continuum approach produces\nyield-stress materials based on Lattice-Boltzmann simulations. We show that, if\nthe material is stimulated below yield stress, plastic events occur, which have\nstrong similarities with seismic events. Based on a suitable definition of\ndisplacement in the continuum, we show that the plastic events obey a\nGutenberg-Richter law with exponents similar to those for real earthquakes. We\nfurther find that average acceleration, energy release, stress drop and\nrecurrence times scale with the same exponent. The approach is fully\nself-consistent and all quantities can be calculated at all scales without the\nneed of ad hoc friction or statistical laws. We therefore suggest that our\napproach may lead to new insight into understanding of the physics connecting\nthe micro and macro scale of earthquakes.\n", "  Following Vasisht et al's identification of the second critical point\n(Tc2,Pc2) for liquid silicon in the Stillinger-Weber (S-W) model for silicon,\nwe study the variation of Tc2,Pc2 with tetrahedral repulsion parameter in an\nextension of the earlier \"potential tuning\" study of this system. We use the\nsimple isochoric cooling approach to identify the location of the second\ncritical point as a function of the \"tuning\" or \"tetrahedrality\", parameter\n{\\lambda}, and identify two phenomena of high interest content. The first is\nthat the second critical point pressure Pc2, becomes less negative as {\\lambda}\ndecreases from the silicon value (meaning the drive to high tetrahedrality is\ndecreased) and reaches zero pressure at the same value of lambda as earlier\nfound to mark the onset of glassforming ability in an earlier study of this\ntunable system. The second is that, as the Tc,2 approaches the temperature of\nthe liquid-gas spinodal, {\\lambda}>22, the behavior of the temperature of\nmaximum density TMD switches from the behavior seen in most current water pair\npotential models (locus of TMDs has a maximum), to the behavior seen in\nempirical engineering multiparameter equations of state (EoS) (and also by two\nparameter Speedy isothermal expansion EoS) for water, according to which the\nlocus of TMDs of HDL phase has no maximum, and the EoS for HDL has no second\ncritical point. At {\\lambda}= 23 the behavior is isomorphic with that of the mW\nmodel of water, which is now seen to conform to the \"critical point free\"\nscenario for water.\n", "  We report the first calorimetric detection of individual He2* excimers within\na bath of superfluid 4He. The detector used in this work is a single\nsuperconducting titanium transition edge sensor (TES) with an energy resolution\nof ~1 eV, immersed directly in the helium bath. He2* excimers are produced in\nthe surrounding bath using an external gamma-ray source. These excimers exist\neither as short-lived singlet or long-lived triplet states. We demonstrate\ndetection of both states: in the singlet case the calorimeter records the\nabsorption of a prompt 15 eV photon, and in the triplet case the calorimeter\nrecords a direct interaction of the molecule with the TES surface, which\ndeposits a distinct fraction of the 15 eV, released upon decay, into the\nsurface. We also briefly discuss the detector fabrication and characterization.\n", "  A new theoretical approach is proposed to predict a practical upper limit to\nthe efficiency of a very large wind farm. The new theory suggests that the\nefficiency of ideal turbines in an ideal very large wind farm depends primarily\non a non-dimensional parameter $\\lambda/C_{f0}$, where $\\lambda$ is the ratio\nof the rotor swept area to the land area (for each turbine) and $C_{f0}$ is a\nnatural friction coefficient observed before constructing the farm. When\n$\\lambda/C_{f0}$ approaches to zero, the new theory goes back to the classical\nactuator disc theory, yielding the well-known Betz limit. When $\\lambda/C_{f0}$\nincreases to a large value, the maximum power coefficient of each turbine\nreduces whilst a normalised power density of the farm increases asymptotically\nto an upper limit. A CFD analysis of an infinitely large wind farm with\n'aligned' and 'displaced' array configurations is also presented to validate a\nkey assumption used in the new theory.\n", "  The interaction between graphene and copper (111) surface have been\ninvestigated using the molecular dynamics simulations. We have shown that it is\npossible to fit Lennard-Jones potential leading to the correct values of the\nbinding energy and the binding distance and, at the same time, yielding\nexperimentally observed Moir\\'e superstructures. The dependencies of the\nbinding energy, the binding distance and the graphene thickness on the\nparameters of the potential and the rotational angle are presented.\n", "  We introduce a new analysis method to deal with stationary non-Gaussian\nnoises in gravitational wave detectors in terms of the independent component\nanalysis. First, we consider the simplest case where the detector outputs are\nlinear combinations of the inputs, consisting of signals and various noises,\nand show that this method may be helpful to increase the signal-to-noise ratio.\nNext, we take into account the time delay between the inputs and the outputs.\nFinally, we extend our method to nonlinearly correlated noises and show that\nour method can identify the coupling coefficients and remove non-Gaussian\nnoises. Although we focus on gravitational wave data analysis, our methods are\napplicable to the detection of any signals under non-Gaussian noises.\n", "  We discuss the role of the three-nucleon isospin T=3/2 amplitude in elastic\nneutron-deuteron scattering and in the deuteron breakup reaction. The\ncontribution of this amplitude originates from charge-independence breaking of\nthe nucleon-nucleon potential and is driven by the difference between\nneutron-neutron (proton-proton) and neutron-proton forces. We study the\nmagnitude of that contribution to the elastic scattering and breakup\nobservables, taking the locally regularized chiral N4LO nucleon-nucleon\npotential supplemented by the chiral N2LO three-nucleon force. For comparison\nwe employ also the Av18 nucleon-nucleon potential combined with the Urbana IX\nthree-nucleon force. We find that the isospin T=3/2 component is important for\nthe breakup reaction and the proper treatment of charge-independence breaking\nin this case requires the inclusion of the 1S0 state with isospin T=3/2. For\nneutron-deuteron elastic scattering the T=3/2 contributions are insignificant\nand charge-independence breaking can be accounted for by using the effective\nt-matrix generated with the so-called \"2/3-1/3\" rule.\n", "  A GEANT4-based simulation is developed for the endcap time of flight (ETOF)\nupgrade based on multi-gap resistive plate chambers (MRPC) for the BESIII\nexperiment. The MRPC prototype and the simulation method are described. Using a\nfull Monte-Carlo simulation, the influence of high voltage and threshold on\ntime resolution and detection efficiency are investigated. The preliminary\nresults from simulation are presented and are compared with the experimental\ndata taken with the prototype MRPC modules.\n", "  The India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO) is planning to build a magnetized\niron calorimeter detector (ICAL) in which Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) will\nbe the active detector elements. A study of the performance of RPCs, made using\nelectrodes of various thicknesses, is pivotal in optimizing the design\nparameters of the ICAL RPCs. We fabricated RPCs with glasses of various\nthicknesses and studied their performance in the same environmental conditions.\nA study of detector efficiency, noise rate, time resolution and charge\ndistribution is presented in this paper.\n", "  This study investigates the dynamics of non-isothermal swirling jets\nundergoing vortex breakdown, with an emphasis on helical coherent structures.\nIt is proposed that the dominant helical coherent structure can be suppressed\nby heating the recirculation bubble. This proposition is assessed with Stereo\nParticle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements of the breakdown region of\nisothermal and heated swirling jets. The coherent kinetic energy of the\ndominant helical structure was derived from PIV snapshots via Proper Orthogonal\nDecomposition. For one set of experimental parameters, mild heating is found to\nincrease the energy content of the dominant helical mode. Strong heating leads\nto a reduction by 30\\% of the coherent structures energy. For a second set of\nexperimental parameters, no alteration of the dominant coherent structure is\ndetectable. Local linear stability analysis of the time-averaged velocity\nfields shows that the key difference between the two configurations is the\ndensity ratio at the respective wavemaker location. A density ratio of\napproximately 0.8 is found to correlate to a suppression of the global mode in\nthe experiments. A parametric study with model density and velocity profiles\nindicates the most important parameters that govern the local absolute growth\nrate: The density ratio and the relative position of the density profiles and\nthe inner shear layer.\n", "  Nanophotonic optomechanical devices allow observation of nanoscale vibrations\nwith sensitivity that has dramatically advanced metrology of nanomechanical\nstructures [1-9] and has the potential to impact studies of nanoscale physical\nsystems in a similar manner [10, 11]. Here we demonstrate this potential with a\nnanophotonic optomechanical torque magnetometer and radiofrequency (RF)\nmagnetic susceptometer. Exquisite readout sensitivity provided by a nanocavity\nintegrated within a torsional nanomechanical resonator enables observations of\nthe unique net magnetization and RF-driven responses of single mesoscopic\nmagnetic structures in ambient conditions. The magnetic moment resolution is\nsufficient for observation of Barkhausen steps in the magnetic hysteresis of a\nlithographically patterned permalloy island [12]. In addition, significantly\nenhanced RF susceptibility is found over narrow field ranges and attributed to\nthermally assisted driven hopping of a magnetic vortex core between neighboring\npinning sites [13]. The on-chip magneto-susceptometer scheme offers a promising\npath to powerful integrated cavity optomechanical devices for quantitative\ncharacterization of magnetic micro- and nanosystems in science and technology.\n", "  Crystallization is one of the most important phase transformations of first\norder. In the case of metals and alloys, the liquid phase is the parent phase\nof materials production. The conditions of the crystallization process control\nthe as-solidified material in its chemical and physical properties. Nucleation\ninitiates the crystallization of a liquid. It selects the crystallographic\nphase, stable or meta-stable. Its detailed knowledge is therefore mandatory for\nthe design of materials. We present techniques of containerless processing for\nnucleation studies of metals and alloys. We demonstrate the power of these\nmethods for crystal nucleation of stable solids but in particular also for\ninvestigations of crystal nucleation of metastable solids at extreme\nundercooling. This concerns the issue of heterogeneous versus homogeneous\nnucleation and non-equilibrium conditions. The results are analyzed within\nclassical nucleation theory, where the activation energy of homogeneous\nnucleation depends on the interfacial energy and the difference of Gibbs free\nenergies of solid and liquid. The interfacial energy acts as barrier for the\nnucleation process. Its experimental determination is difficult in the case of\nmetals. In the second part of this work we therefore explore the use of\ncolloidal suspensions as models for the crystallization process. Their\nnucleation process is observed in situ by optical techniques and ultra-small\nangle X-ray diffraction using high intensity synchrotron radiation. It allows\nan unambiguous discrimination of homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation as\nwell as the determination of the interfacial free energy of the solid-liquid\ninterface. Our results are used to construct Turnbull plots of colloids, which\nare discussed in relation to Turnbull plots of metals and support the\nhypothesis that colloids are useful model systems to investigate crystal\nnucleation.\n", "  In the present work we report a study on the viscous extended holographic\nRicci dark energy (EHRDE) model under the assumption of existence of bulk\nviscosity in the linear barotropic fluid and the EHRDE in the framework of\nstandard Eckart theory of relativistic irreversible thermodynamics and it has\nbeen observed that the non-equilibrium bulk viscous pressure is significantly\nsmaller than the local equilibrium pressure. We have studied the equation of\nstate (EoS) parameter and observed that the EoS behaves like \"quintom\" and is\nconsistent with the constraints set by observational data sets from SNLS3, BAO\nand Planck + WMAP9 + WiggleZ measurements in the reference S. Kumar and L. Xu,\n\\emph{Phys. Lett. B},\\textbf{737}, 244 (2014). Analysis of statefinder\nparameters has shown the possibility of attainment of $\\Lambda$CDM phase under\ncurrent model and at the same time it has been pointed out that the for $z=0$\ni.e. current universe, the statefinder pair is different from that of\n$\\Lambda$CDM and the $\\Lambda$CDM can be attained in a later stage of the\nuniverse. An analysis of stability has shown that although the viscous EHRDE\nalong with viscous barotropic is classically unstable in the present epoch, it\ncan lead to a stable universe in very late stage. Considering an universe\nenveloped by event horizon we have observed validity of generalized second law\nof thermodynamics.\n", "  This work investigates the properties of convection in stars with particular\nemphasis on entrainment across the upper convective boundary (CB). Idealised\nsimulations of turbulent convection in the O-burning shell of a massive star\nare performed in $4\\pi$ geometry on $768^3$ and $1536^3$ grids, driven by a\nrepresentative heating rate. A heating series is also performed on the $768^3$\ngrid. The $1536^3$ simulation exhibits an entrainment rate at the upper CB of\n$1.33\\times10^{-6}~M_\\odot~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The $768^3$ simulation with the\nsame heating rate agrees within 17 per cent. The entrainment rate at the upper\nconvective boundary is found to scale linearly with the driving luminosity and\nwith the cube of the shear velocity at the upper boundary, while the radial RMS\nfluid velocity scales with the cube root of the driving luminosity, as\nexpected. The mixing is analysed in a 1D diffusion framework, resulting in a\nsimple model for CB mixing. The analysis confirms previous findings that\nlimiting the MLT mixing length to the distance to the CB in 1D simulations\nbetter represents the spherically-averaged radial velocity profiles from the 3D\nsimulations and provides an improved determination of the reference diffusion\ncoefficient $D_0$ for the exponential diffusion CB mixing model in 1D. From the\n3D simulation data we adopt as the convective boundary the location of the\nmaximum gradient in the horizontal velocity component which has $2\\sigma$\nspatial fluctuations of $\\approx0.17 H_P$ . The exponentially decaying\ndiffusion CB mixing model with $f = 0.03$ reproduces the spherically-averaged\n3D abundance profiles.\n", "  Loss-induced transmission in waveguides, and reversed pump dependence in\nlasers, are two prominent examples of counter-intuitive effects in\nnon-Hermitian systems with patterned gain and loss. By analyzing the eigenvalue\ndynamics of complex symmetric matrices when a system parameter is varied, we\nintroduce a general set of theoretical conditions for these two effects. We\nshow that these effects arise in any irreducible system where the gain or loss\nis added to a subset of the elements of the system, without the need for\nparity-time symmetry or for the system to be near an exceptional point. These\nresults are confirmed using full-wave numerical simulations. The conditions\npresented here vastly expand the design space for observing these effects. We\nalso show that a similarly broad class of systems exhibit a loss-induced\nnarrowing of the density of states.\n", "  In this article, we investigate the mathematical relationship between a (3+1)\ndimensional gravity model inside Anti-de Sitter space $\\rm AdS_4$, and a (2+1)\ndimensional superconducting system on the asymptotically flat boundary of $\\rm\nAdS_4$ (in the absence of gravity). We consider a simple case of the Type II\nsuperconducting model (in terms of Ginzburg-Landau theory) with an external\nperpendicular magnetic field ${\\bf H}$. An interaction potential $V(r,\\psi) =\n\\alpha(T)|\\psi|^2/r^2+\\chi|\\psi|^2/L^2+\\beta|\\psi|^4/(2 r^k )$ is introduced\nwithin the Lagrangian system. This provides more flexibility within the model,\nwhen the superconducting system is close to the transition temperature $T_c$.\nOverall, our result demonstrates that the two Ginzburg-Landau differential\nequations can be directly deduced from Einstein's theory of general relativity.\n", "  Single-emitter microscopy has emerged as a promising method of imaging\nnanostructures with nanoscale resolution. This technique uses the centroid\nposition of an emitters far-field radiation pattern to infer its position to a\nprecision that is far below the diffraction limit. However, nanostructures\ncomposed of high-dielectric materials such as noble metals can distort the\nfar-field radiation pattern. Nanoparticles also exhibit a more complex range of\ndistortions, because in addition to introducing a high dielectric surface, they\nalso act as efficient scatterers. Thus, the distortion effects of nanoparticles\nin single-emitter microscopy remains poorly understood. Here we demonstrate\nthat metallic nanoparticles can significantly distort the accuracy of\nsingle-emitter imaging at distances exceeding 300 nm. We use a single quantum\ndot to probe both the magnitude and the direction of the metallic\nnanoparticle-induced imaging distortion and show that the diffraction spot of\nthe quantum dot can shift by more than 35 nm. The centroid position of the\nemitter generally shifts away from the nanoparticle position, in contradiction\nto the conventional wisdom that the nanoparticle is a scattering object that\nwill pull in the diffraction spot of the emitter towards its center. These\nresults suggest that dielectric distortion of the emission pattern dominates\nover scattering. We also show that by monitoring the distortion of the quantum\ndot diffraction spot we can obtain high-resolution spatial images of the\nnanoparticle, providing a new method for performing highly precise,\nsub-diffraction spatial imaging. These results provide a better understanding\nof the complex near-field coupling between emitters and nanostructures, and\nopen up new opportunities to perform super-resolution microscopy with higher\naccuracy.\n", "  We investigate the distribution and temperature-dependent optical properties\nof sharp, zero-phonon emission from defect-based single photon sources in\nmultilayer hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) flakes. We observe sharp emission\nlines from optically active defects distributed across an energy range that\nexceeds 500 meV. Spectrally-resolved photon-correlation measurements verify\nsingle photon emission, even when multiple emission lines are simultaneously\nexcited within the same h-BN flake. We also present a detailed study of the\ntemperature-dependent linewidth, spectral energy shift, and intensity for two\ndifferent zero-phonon lines centered at 575 nm and 682 nm, which reveals a\nnearly identical temperature dependence despite a large difference in\ntransition energy. Our temperature-dependent results are best described by a\nlattice vibration model that considers piezoelectric coupling to in-plane\nphonons. Finally, polarization spectroscopy measurements suggest that whereas\nthe 575 nm emission line is directly excited by 532 nm excitation, the 682 nm\nline is excited indirectly.\n", "  In the present work we investigate the behavior of all three components of\npersistent spin current in a quasi-periodic Fibonacci ring subjected to Rashba\nand Dresselhaus spin-orbit interactions. Analogous to persistent charge current\nin a conducting ring where electrons gain a Berry phase in presence of magnetic\nflux, spin Berry phase is associated during the motion of electrons in presence\nof a spin-orbit field which is responsible for the generation of spin current.\nThe interplay between two spin-orbit fields along with quasi-periodic Fibonacci\nsequence on persistent spin current is described elaborately, and from our\nanalysis, we can estimate the strength of any one of two spin-orbit couplings\ntogether with on-site energy, provided the other is known.\n", "  For a fixed average energy, the simultaneous estimation of multiple phases\ncan provide a better total precision than estimating them individually. We show\nthis for a multimode interferometer with a phase in each mode, using Gaussian\ninputs and passive elements, by calculating the covariance matrix. The quantum\nCram\\'{e}r-Rao bound provides a lower bound to the covariance matrix via the\nquantum Fisher information matrix, whose elements we derive to be the\ncovariances of the photon numbers across the modes. We prove that this bound\ncan be saturated. In spite of the Gaussian nature of the problem, the\ncalculation of non-Gaussian integrals is required, which we accomplish\nanalytically. We find our simultaneous strategy to yield no more than a\nfactor-of-2 improvement in total precision, possibly because of a fundamental\nperformance limitation of Gaussian states. Our work shows that no modal\nentanglement is necessary for simultaneous quantum-enhanced estimation of\nmultiple phases.\n", "  We present a review of quantum computation with neutral atom qubits. After an\noverview of architectural options and approaches to preparing large qubit\narrays we examine Rydberg mediated gate protocols and fidelity for two- and\nmulti-qubit interactions. Quantum simulation and Rydberg dressing are\nalternatives to circuit based quantum computing for exploring many body quantum\ndynamics. We review the properties of the dressing interaction and provide a\nquantitative figure of merit for the complexity of the coherent dynamics that\ncan be accessed with dressing. We conclude with a summary of the current status\nand an outlook for future progress.\n", "  A lattice model for the study of mixtures of associating liquids is proposed.\nSolvent and solute are modeled by adapting the associating lattice gas (ALG)\nmodel. The nature of interaction solute/solvent is controlled by tuning the\nenergy interactions between the patches of ALG model. We have studied three set\nof parameters, resulting on, hydrophilic, inert and hydrophobic interactions.\nExtensive Monte Carlo simulations were carried out and the behavior of pure\ncomponents and the excess properties of the mixtures have been studied. The\npure components: water (solvent) and solute, have quite similar phase diagrams,\npresenting: gas, low density liquid, and high density liquid phases. In the\ncase of solute, the regions of coexistence are substantially reduced when\ncompared with both the water and the standard ALG models. A numerical procedure\nhas been developed in order to attain series of results at constant pressure\nfrom simulations of the lattice gas model in the grand canonical ensemble. The\nexcess properties of the mixtures: volume and enthalpy as the function of the\nsolute fraction have been studied for different interaction parameters of the\nmodel. Our model is able to reproduce qualitatively well the excess volume and\nenthalpy for different aqueous solutions. For the hydrophilic case, we show\nthat the model is able to reproduce the excess volume and enthalpy of mixtures\nof small alcohols and amines. The inert case reproduces the behavior of large\nalcohols such as, propanol, butanol and pentanol. For last case (hydrophobic),\nthe excess properties reproduce the behavior of ionic liquids in aqueous\nsolution.\n", "  A thought experiment is considered on observation of instantaneous collapse\nof an extended wave packet. According to relativity of simultaneity, such a\ncollapse being instantaneous in some reference frame must be a lasting process\nin other frames. But according to quantum mechanics, collapse is instantaneous\nin any frame. Mathematical structure of quantum mechanics eliminates any\ncontradictions between these two apparently conflicting statements. Here the\ninvariance of quantum-mechanical collapse is shown to follow directly from the\nBorn postulate, without any use of mathematical properties of quantum\noperators. The consistency of quantum mechanics with Relativity is also shown\nfor instant disentanglement of a composite system.\n", "  When parton distributions are falling steeply as the momentum fractions of\nthe partons increases, there are effects that occur at each order in $\\alpha_s$\nthat combine to affect hard scattering cross sections and need to be summed. We\nshow how to accomplish this in a leading approximation in the context of a\nparton shower Monte Carlo event generator.\n", "  Transverse spin angular momentum (SAM) of light and associated transverse\nchiral optical forces have received tremendous attention recently as the latter\nmay lead to an optical separation of chiral biomolecules. In this context, the\nrelative magnitude of chiral and non-chiral forces represents a challenge for\nthe implementation of chiral separation schemes. In this work we demonstrate\nthat, by spatially separating the maxima of transverse spin density from the\ngradient of field intensity, it is possible to dominate chiral-specific\ncomponents of the force over non-chiral ones. To that end, we study optical\nnanofibers and nanowires as a candidate for such scheme and demonstrate that in\ntheir vicinity, chiral optical forces can emerge that are stronger than\ngradient and scattering forces. This finding may be of significance in the\ndesign of improved optical separation schemes for chiral biomolecules.\n", "  Glass based Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) are going to be used as an active\nelement in the Iron Calorimeter (ICAL) experiment at the India based Neutrino\nObservatory (INO), which is being constructed to study atmospheric neutrinos.\nThough the RPC detector operational parameters are more or less finalized, the\nreadout electronics is being developed using various technologies. The ICAL\nexperiment will consist of about 29,000 RPC detectors of 2 m $\\times$ 2 m in\nsize with each detector having 64 readout channels both in the X and Y\ndirections. The present study focusses on multi-channel electronics based on\nSiGe 350 nm technology as an option for the INO-ICAL RPC detectors. The study\nincludes commissioning and usage of frontend application specific integrated\ncircuit (ASIC) HARDROC chip in which 64 channels are handled independently to\nperform zero suppression. We present first testbench results using the HARDROC\nchip with the aim to use it finally in the ICAL experiment.\n", "  Photons do not interact directly with each other, but conditional control of\none beam by another can be achieved with non-linear optical media at high field\nintensities. It is exceedingly difficult to reach such intensities at the\nsingle photon level but proposals have been made to obtain effective\ninteractions by scattering photons from single transitions. We report here\neffective interactions between photons created using a quantum dot weakly\ncoupled to a cavity. We show that a passive single-photon non-linearity can\nmodify the counting statistics of a Poissonian beam, sorting the photons in\nnumber. This is used to create strong correlations between detection events and\nsort polarisation correlated photons from an uncorrelated stream using a single\nspin. These results pave the way for optical switches operated by single quanta\nof light.\n", "  The effects of wall velocity slip on the linear stability of a gravity-driven\nmiscible two-fluid flow down an incline are examined. The fluids have the\nmatched density but different viscosity. A smooth viscosity stratification is\nachieved due to the presence of a thin mixed layer between the fluids. The\nresults show that the presence of slip exhibits a promise for stabilizing the\nmiscible flow system by raising the critical Reynolds number at the onset and\ndecreasing the bandwidth of unstable wave numbers beyond the threshold of the\ndominant instability. This is different from its role in the case of a single\nfluid down a slippery substrate where slip destabilizes the flow system at the\nonset. Though the stability properties are analogous to the same flow system\ndown a rigid substrate, slip is shown to delay the surface mode instability for\nany viscosity contrast. It has a damping/promoting effect on the overlap modes\n(which exist due to the overlap of critical layer of dominant disturbance with\nthe mixed layer) when the mixed layer is away/close from/to the slippery\ninclined wall. The trend of slip effect is influenced by the location of the\nmixed layer, the location of more viscous fluid and the mass diffusivity of the\ntwo fluids. The stabilizing characteristics of slip can be favourably used to\nsuppress the non-linear breakdown which may happen due to the coexistence of\nthe unstable modes in a flow over a substrate with no slip. The results of the\npresent study suggest that it is desirable to design a slippery surface with\nappropriate slip sensitivity in order to meet a particular need for a specific\napplication.\n", "  Metallic ferromagnets subjected to a temperature gradient exhibit a magnonic\ndrag of the electric current. We address this problem by solving a stochastic\nLandau-Lifshitz equation to calculate the magnon-drag thermopower. The\nlong-wavelength magnetic dynamics result in two contributions to the\nelectromotive force acting on electrons: (1) An adiabatic Berry-phase force\nrelated to the solid angle subtended by the magnetic precession and (2) a\ndissipative correction thereof, which is rooted microscopically in the\nspin-dephasing scattering. The first contribution results in a net force\npushing the electrons towards the hot side, while the second contribution drags\nelectrons towards the cold side, i.e., in the direction of the magnonic drift.\nThe ratio between the two forces is proportional to the ratio between the\nGilbert damping coefficient $\\alpha$ and the coefficient $\\beta$ parametrizing\nthe dissipative contribution to the electromotive force.\n", "  In bimodal FM-AFM, two flexural modes are excited simultaneously. The total\nvertical oscillation deflection range of the tip is the sum of the peak-to-peak\namplitudes of both flexural modes (sum amplitude). We show atomically resolved\nimages of KBr(100) in ambient conditions in bimodal AFM that display a strong\ncorrelation between image quality and sum amplitude. When the sum amplitude\nbecomes larger than about 200 pm, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is\ndrastically decreased. We propose this is caused by the temporary presence of\none or more water layers in the tip-sample gap. These water layers screen the\nshort range interaction and must be displaced with each oscillation cycle.\nFurther decreasing the sum amplitude, however, causes a decrease in SNR.\nTherefore, the highest SNR in ambient conditions is achieved when the sum\namplitude is slightly less than the thickness of the primary hydration layer.\n", "  Coupled order parameters in phase-transition materials can be controlled\nusing various driving forces such as temperature, magnetic and electric field,\nstrain, spin-polarized currents and optical pulses. Tuning the material\nproperties to achieve efficient transitions would enable fast and low-power\nelectronic devices. Here we show that the first-order metamagnetic phase\ntransition in FeRh films becomes strongly asymmetric in mesoscale structures.\nIn patterned FeRh stripes we observed pronounced supercooling and an\navalanche-like abrupt transition from the ferromagnetic to the\nantiferromagnetic phase while the reverse transition remains nearly continuous\nover a broad temperature range. Although modest asymmetry signatures have been\nfound in FeRh films, the effect is dramatically enhanced at the mesoscale. The\nasymmetry in the transitions is independent of applied magnetic fields and the\nactivation volume of the antiferromagnetic phase is more than two orders of\nmagnitude larger than typical magnetic heterogeneities observed in films. The\ncollective behavior upon cooling results from the role of long-range\nferromagnetic exchange correlations that become important at the mesoscale and\nshould be a general property of first-order magnetic phase transitions.\n", "  Compressive fluctuations are a minor yet significant component of\nastrophysical plasma turbulence. In the solar wind, long-wavelength compressive\nslow-mode fluctuations lead to changes in $\\beta_{\\parallel \\mathrm p}\\equiv\n8\\pi n_{\\mathrm p}k_{\\mathrm B}T_{\\parallel \\mathrm p}/B^2$ and in $R_{\\mathrm\np}\\equiv T_{\\perp \\mathrm p}/T_{\\parallel \\mathrm p}$, where $T_{\\perp \\mathrm\np}$ and $T_{\\parallel \\mathrm p}$ are the perpendicular and parallel\ntemperatures of the protons, $B$ is the magnetic field strength, and\n$n_{\\mathrm p}$ is the proton density. If the amplitude of the compressive\nfluctuations is large enough, $R_{\\mathrm p}$ crosses one or more instability\nthresholds for anisotropy-driven microinstabilities. The enhanced field\nfluctuations from these microinstabilities scatter the protons so as to reduce\nthe anisotropy of the pressure tensor. We propose that this scattering drives\nthe average value of $R_{\\mathrm p}$ away from the marginal stability boundary\nuntil the fluctuating value of $R_{\\mathrm p}$ stops crossing the boundary. We\nmodel this \"fluctuating-anisotropy effect\" using linear Vlasov--Maxwell theory\nto describe the large-scale compressive fluctuations. We argue that this effect\ncan explain why, in the nearly collisionless solar wind, the average value of\n$R_{\\mathrm p}$ is close to unity.\n", "  Exact solvability (ES) of one-dimensional quantum potentials $V(x)$ is a\nvague concept. We propose that beyond its most conventional range the ES status\nshould be attributed also to many less common interaction models for which the\nwave functions remain piecewise proportional to special functions. The claim is\nsupported by constructive analysis of a toy model $V(x)= -g^2\\exp (-|x|)$. The\ndetailed description of the related bound-state and scattering solutions of\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation is provided in terms of Bessel functions which are\nproperly matched in the origin.\n", "  The open string metric arises kinematically in studying fluctuations of open\nstring degrees of freedom on a D-brane. An observer, living on a probe D-brane,\ncan send signals through the spacetime by using such fluctuations on the probe,\nthat propagate in accordance with a metric which is conformal to the open\nstring metric. Event horizons can emerge in the open string metric when one\nconsiders a D-brane with an electric field on its worldvolume. Here, we\nemphasize the role of and investigate, in details, the causal structure of the\nresulting open string event horizon and demonstrate, among other things, its\nclose similarities to an usual black hole event horizon in asymptotically\nAdS-spaces. To that end, we analyze relevant geodesics, Penrose diagrams and\nvarious causal holographic observables for a given open string metric. For\nanalytical control, most of our calculations are performed in an asymptotically\nAdS$_3$-background, however, we argue that the physics is qualitatively the\nsame in higher dimensions. We also discuss how this open string metric arises\nfrom an underlying D-brane configuration in string theory.\n", "  Association rules mining (ARM) is one of the most important problems in\nknowledge discovery and data mining. Given a transaction database that has a\nlarge number of transactions and items, the task of ARM is to acquire\nconsumption habits of customers by discovering the relationships between\nitemsets (sets of items). In this paper, we address ARM in the quantum settings\nand propose a quantum algorithm for the key part of ARM, finding out frequent\nitemsets from the candidate itemsets and acquiring their supports.\nSpecifically, for the case in which there are $M_f^{(k)}$ frequent $k$-itemsets\nin the $M_c^{(k)}$ candidate $k$-itemsets ($M_f^{(k)} \\leq M_c^{(k)}$), our\nalgorithm can efficiently mine these frequent $k$-itemsets and estimate their\nsupports by using parallel amplitude estimation and amplitude amplification\nwith complexity $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{k\\sqrt{M_c^{(k)}M_f^{(k)}}}{\\epsilon})$,\nwhere $\\epsilon$ is the error for estimating the supports. Compared with the\nclassical counterpart, classical sampling-based algorithm, whose complexity is\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{kM_c^{(k)}}{\\epsilon^2})$, our quantum algorithm\nquadratically improves the dependence on both $\\epsilon$ and $M_c^{(k)}$ in the\nbest case when $M_f^{(k)}\\ll M_c^{(k)}$ and on $\\epsilon$ alone in the worst\ncase when $M_f^{(k)}\\approx M_c^{(k)}$.\n", "  We propose a scheme to generate gamma-ray photons with an orbital angular\nmomentum (OAM) and high energy simultaneously from laser-plasma interactions by\nirradiating a circularly polarized Laguerre-Gaussian laser on a thin plasma\ntarget. The spin angular momentum and OAM are first transferred to electrons\nfrom the driving laser photons, and then the OAM is transferred to the\ngamma-ray photons from the electrons through quantum radiation. This scheme has\nbeen demonstrated using three-dimensional quantum electrodynamics\nparticle-in-cell simulation. The topological charge, chirality and\ncarrier-envelope phase of the short ultra-intense vortex laser can be revealed\naccording to the pattern feature of the energy density of radiated photons.\n", "  An approach is discussed on the determination of the leading order hadronic\ncontribution to the muon anomaly, $a_\\mu^{HAD}$, based entirely on theory. This\nmethod makes no use of $e^+ e^-$ annihilation data, a likely source of the\ncurrent discrepancy between theory and experiment beyond the $3\\, \\sigma$\nlevel. What this method requires is essentially knowledge of the first\nderivative of the vector current correlator at zero-momentum. In the\nheavy-quark sector this is obtained from the well known heavy quark expansion\nin perturbative QCD, leading to values of $a_\\mu^{HAD}$ in the charm- and\nbottom-quark region which were fully confirmed by later lattice QCD (LQCD)\nresults. In the light-quark sector, using recent preliminary LQCD results for\nthe first derivative of the vector current correlator at zero-momentum leads to\nthe value $a_\\mu^{HAD} = (729 - 871)\\, \\times\\,10^{-10}$, which is\nsignificantly larger than values obtained from using $e^+ e^-$ data. A separate\napproach based on the operator product expansion (OPE), and designed to quench\nthe contribution of these data, reduces the discrepancy by at least 40\\%. In\naddition, it exposes a tension between the OPE and $e^+ e^-$ data, thus\nsuggesting the blame for the discrepancy on the latter.\n", "  We consider a mean-field model of coupled phase oscillators with quenched\ndisorder in the natural frequencies and coupling strengths. A fraction $p$ of\noscillators are positively coupled, attracting all others, while the remaining\nfraction $1-p$ are negatively coupled, repelling all others. The frequencies\nand couplings are deterministically chosen in a manner which correlates them,\nthereby correlating the two types of disorder in the model. We first explore\nthe effect of this correlation on the system's phase coherence. We find that\nthere is a a critical width $\\gamma_c$ in the frequency distribution below\nwhich the system spontaneously synchronizes. Moreover, this $\\gamma_c$ is\nindependent of $p$. Hence, our model and the traditional Kuramoto model\n(recovered when $p=1$) have the same critical width $\\gamma_c$. We next explore\nthe critical behavior of the system by examining the finite-size scaling and\nthe dynamic fluctuation of the traditional order parameter. We find that the\nmodel belongs to the same universality class as the Kuramoto model with\ndeterministically (not randomly) chosen natural frequencies for the case of\n$p<1$.\n", "  We investigate global symmetries for 6D SCFTs and LSTs having a single\n\"unpaired\" tensor, that is, a tensor with no associated gauge symmetry. We\nverify that for every such theory built from F-theory whose tensor has Dirac\nself-pairing equal to -1, the global symmetry algebra is a subalgebra of\n$\\mathfrak{e}_8$. This result is new if the F-theory presentation of the theory\ninvolves a one-parameter family of nodal or cuspidal rational curves (i.e.,\nKodaira types $I_1$ or $II$) rather than elliptic curves (Kodaira type $I_0$).\nFor such theories, this condition on the global symmetry algebra appears to\nfully capture the constraints on coupling these theories to others in the\ncontext of multi-tensor theories. We also study the analogous problem for\ntheories whose tensor has Dirac self-pairing equal to -2 and find that the\nglobal symmetry algebra is a subalgebra of $\\mathfrak{su}(2)$. However, in this\ncase there are additional constraints on F-theory constructions for coupling\nthese theories to others.\n", "  We systematically analyze the local combinations of gauge groups and matter\nthat can arise in 6D F-theory models over a fixed base. We compare the\nlow-energy constraints of anomaly cancellation to explicit F-theory\nconstructions using Weierstrass and Tate forms, and identify some new local\nstructures in the \"swampland' of 6D supergravity and SCFT models that appear\nconsistent from low-energy considerations but do not have known F-theory\nrealizations. In particular, we classify and carry out a local analysis of all\nenhancements of the irreducible gauge and matter contributions from\n\"non-Higgsable clusters,\" and on isolated curves and pairs of intersecting\nrational curves of arbitrary self-intersection. Such enhancements correspond\nphysically to unHiggsings, and mathematically to tunings of the Weierstrass\nmodel of an elliptic CY threefold. We determine the shift in Hodge numbers of\nthe elliptic threefold associated with each enhancement. We also consider local\ntunings on curves that have higher genus or intersect multiple other curves,\ncodimension two tunings that give transitions in the F-theory matter content,\ntunings of abelian factors in the gauge group, and generalizations of the\n\"$E_8$\" rule to include tunings and curves of self-intersection zero. These\ntools can be combined into an algorithm that in principle enables a finite and\nsystematic classification of all elliptic CY threefolds and corresponding 6D\nF-theory SUGRA models over a given compact base (modulo some technical caveats\nin various special circumstances), and are also relevant to the classification\nof 6D SCFT's. To illustrate the utility of these results, we identify some\nlarge example classes of known CY threefolds in the Kreuzer-Skarke database as\nWeierstrass models over complex surface bases with specific simple tunings, and\nwe survey the range of tunings possible over one specific base.\n", "  Decays $K^{+} \\rightarrow \\mu^{+}\\nu_{\\mu} \\nu \\bar \\nu$ and\n$K^{+}\\rightarrow e^{+}\\nu_{e} \\nu \\bar \\nu$ are examined to the leading order\nin momenta in the framework of Chiral Perturbation Theory. Predictions of the\nStandard Model for the muon and electron differential energy spectra and\nbranching ratios of $K_{\\mu 3 \\nu}$ and $K_{e 3 \\nu}$ are presented.\n", "  It has been known for some time that the cosmological Friedmann equation\ndeduced from General Relativity can be also obtained within the Newtonian\nframework under certain assumptions. We use this result together with quantum\ncorrections to the Newtonian potentials to derive a set a of quantum corrected\nFriedmann equations. We examine the behavior of the solutions of these modified\ncosmological equations paying special attention to the sign of the quantum\ncorrections. We find different quantum effects crucially depending on this\nsign. One such a solution displays a qualitative resemblance to other quantum\nmodels like Loop Quantum Gravity or non-commutative geometry.\n", "  New results for electric dipole strength in the chain of even-even Calcium\nisotopes with the mass numbers A = 40 - 54 are presented. Starting from the\ncovariant Lagrangian of Quantum Hadrodynamics, spectra of collective vibrations\n(phonons) and phonon-nucleon coupling vertices for $J \\leq 6$ and normal parity\nwere computed in a self-consistent relativistic quasiparticle random phase\napproximation (RQRPA). These vibrations coupled to Bogoliubov two-quasiparticle\nconfigurations (2q$\\otimes$phonon) form the model space for the calculations of\nthe dipole response function in the relativistic quasiparticle time blocking\napproximation (RQTBA). The results for giant dipole resonance in the latter\napproach are compared to those obtained in RQRPA and to available data.\nEvolution of the dipole strength with neutron number is investigated for both\nhigh-frequency giant dipole resonance (GDR) and low-lying strength. Development\nof a pygmy resonant structure on the low-energy shoulder of GDR is traced and\nanalyzed in terms of transition densities. A dependence of the pygmy dipole\nstrength on the isospin asymmetry parameter is extracted.\n", "  This paper describes the result of overall studies from development to\ncharacterization of undulator radiation. After three years of upgrading, PLS-II\n[1, 2] has been operating successfully since 21st March 2012. During the\nupgrade, we developed and installed an in-vacuum undulator (IVU) that generates\nbrilliant X-ray beam. The IVU with 3 GeV electron beam generates undulator\nradiation up to ~ 21 keV using 11th higher harmonic. The characterizations of\nthe undulator radiation at an X-ray beam line in PLS-II agreed well with the\nsimulation. Based on this performance demonstration, the in-vacuum undulator is\nsuccessfully operating at PLS-II.\n", "  Bethe/Gauge correspondence as it is usually stated is ill-defined in five\ndimensions and needs a \"non-perturbative\" completion; a related problem also\nappears in three dimensions. It has been suggested that this problem, probably\ndue to incompleteness of Omega background regularization in odd dimension, may\nbe solved if we consider gauge theory on compact $S^5$ and $S^3$ geometries. We\nwill develop this idea further by giving a full Bethe/Gauge correspondence\ndictionary on $S^5$ and $S^3$ focussing mainly on the eigenfunctions of (open\nand closed) relativistic 2-particle Toda chain and its quantized spectral\ncurve: these are most properly written in terms of non-perturbatively completed\nNS open topological strings. A key ingredient is Faddeev's modular double\nstructure which is naturally implemented by the $S^5$ and $S^3$ geometries.\n", "  We study the near field to the far field evolution of spin angular momentum\n(SAM) density and the Poynting vector of the scattered waves from spherical\nscatterers. The results show that at the near field, the SAM density and the\nPoynting vector are dominated by their transverse components. While the former\n(transverse SAM) is independent of the helicity of the incident circular\npolarization state, the latter (transverse Poynting vector) depends upon the\npolarization state. It is further demonstrated that the magnitudes and the\nspatial extent of the transverse SAM and the transverse momentum components can\nbe controllably enhanced by exploiting the interference of the transverse\nelectric and transverse magnetic scattering modes.\n", "  Near the band edge of photonic crystal waveguides, localized modes appear due\nto disorder. We demonstrate a new method to elucidate spatial profile of the\nlocalized modes in such systems using precise local tuning. Using deconvolution\nwith the known thermal profile, the spatial profile of a localized mode with\nquality factor ($Q$) $>10^5$ is successfully reconstructed with a resolution of\n$2.5 \\ \\mu $m.\n", "  Weak lensing convergence peaks are a promising tool to probe nonlinear\nstructure evolution at late times, providing additional cosmological\ninformation beyond second-order statistics. Previous theoretical and\nobservational studies have shown that the cosmological constraints on\n$\\Omega_m$ and $\\sigma_8$ are improved by a factor of up to ~ 2 when peak\ncounts and second-order statistics are combined, compared to using the latter\nalone. We study the origin of lensing peaks using observational data from the\n154 deg$^2$ Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey. We found that while\nhigh peaks (with height $\\kappa$ >3.5 $\\sigma_\\kappa$, where $\\sigma_\\kappa$ is\nthe r.m.s. of the convergence $\\kappa$) are typically due to one single massive\nhalo of ~$10^{15}M_\\odot$, low peaks ($\\kappa$ <~ $\\sigma_\\kappa$) are\nassociated with constellations of 2-8 smaller halos (<~$10^{13}M_\\odot$). In\naddition, halos responsible for forming low peaks are found to be significantly\noffset from the line-of-sight towards the peak center (impact parameter >~\ntheir virial radii), compared with ~0.25 virial radii for halos linked with\nhigh peaks, hinting that low peaks are more immune to baryonic processes whose\nimpact is confined to the inner regions of the dark matter halos. Our findings\nare in good agreement with results from the simulation work by Yang el al.\n(2011).\n", "  We consider the nucleon-nucleon scattering problem by applying time-ordered\nperturbation theory to the Lorentz invariant formulation of baryon chiral\nperturbation theory. Using a symmetry preserving higher derivative form of the\neffective Lagrangian, we exploit the freedom of the choice of the\nrenormalization condition and obtain an integral equation for the scattering\namplitude with an improved ultraviolet behavior. The resulting formulation is\nused to quantify finite regulator artifacts in two-nucleon phase shifts as well\nas in the chiral extrapolations of the S-wave scattering lengths and the\ndeuteron binding energy. This approach can be straightforwardly extended to\nanalyze few-nucleon systems and processes involving external electroweak\nsources.\n", "  We consider a general network of harmonic oscillators driven out of thermal\nequilibrium by coupling to several heat reservoirs at different temperatures.\nThe action of the reservoirs is implemented by Langevin forces. Assuming the\nexistence and uniqueness of the steady state of the resulting process, we\nconstruct a canonical entropy production functional which satisfies the\nGallavotti--Cohen fluctuation theorem, i.e., a global large deviation principle\nwith a rate function I(s) obeying the Gallavotti--Cohen fluctuation relation\nI(-s)-I(s)=s for all s. We also consider perturbations of our functional by\nquadratic boundary terms and prove that they satisfy extended fluctuation\nrelations, i.e., a global large deviation principle with a rate function that\ntypically differs from I(s) outside a finite interval. This applies to various\nphysically relevant functionals and, in particular, to the heat dissipation\nrate of the network. Our approach relies on the properties of the maximal\nsolution of a one-parameter family of algebraic matrix Riccati equations. It\nturns out that the limiting cumulant generating functions of our functional and\nits perturbations can be computed in terms of spectral data of a Hamiltonian\nmatrix depending on the harmonic potential of the network and the parameters of\nthe Langevin reservoirs. This approach is well adapted to both analytical and\nnumerical investigations.\n", "  We describe a novel high-speed front-end electronic board (FEB) for\ninterfacing an array of 32 Silicon Photo-multipliers (SiPM) with a computer.\nThe FEB provides individually adjustable bias on the SiPMs, and performs\nlow-noise analog signal amplification, conditioning and digitization. It\nprovides event timing information accurate to 1.3 ns RMS. The back-end data\ninterface is realized on the basis of 100 Mbps Ethernet. The design allows\ndaisy-chaining of up to 256 units into one network interface, thus enabling\ncompact and efficient readout schemes for multi-channel scintillating\ndetectors, using SiPMs as photo-sensors.\n", "  A plasma flow behind a relativistic electron bunch propagating through a cold\nplasma is found assuming that the transverse and longitudinal dimensions of the\nbunch are small and the bunch can be treated as a point charge. In addition,\nthe bunch charge is assumed small. A simplified system of equations for the\nplasma electrons is derived and it is shown that, through a simple rescaling of\nvariables, the bunch charge can be eliminated from the equations. These\nequations have a unique solution, with an ion cavity formed behind the driver.\nThe equations are solved numerically and the scaling of the cavity dimensions\nwith the driver charge is obtained. A numerical solution for the case of a\npositively charged driver is also found.\n", "  We present a substantial generalisation of a classical result by Lie on\nintegrability by quadratures. Namely, we prove that all vector fields in a\nfinite-dimensional transitive and solvable Lie algebra of vector fields on a\nmanifold can be integrated by quadratures.\n", "  General Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity with a cosmological constant allows two\n(A)dS spacetimes as its vacuum solutions. We find a critical point in the\nparameter space where the two (A)dS spacetimes coalesce into one and the\nlinearized perturbations lack any bilinear kinetic terms. The vacuum\nperturbations hence loose their interpretation as linear graviton modes at the\ncritical point. Nevertheless, the critical theory admits black hole solutions\ndue to the nonlinear effect. We also consider Einstein gravity extended with\ngeneral quadratic curvature invariants and obtain critical points where the\ntheory has no bilinear kinetic terms for either the scalar trace mode or the\ntransverse modes. Such critical phenomena are expected to occur frequently in\ngeneral higher derivative gravities.\n", "  The RAON accelerator of the Rare Isotope Science Project (RISP) has been\ndeveloped to create and accelerate various kinds of stable heavy ion beams and\nrare isotope beams for a wide range of the science applications. In the RAON\naccelerator, the rare isotope beams generated by the Isotope Separation On-Line\n(ISOL) system will be transported through the post accelerator, namely, from\nthe post Low Energy Beam Transport (LEBT) system and the post Radio Frequency\nQuadrupole (RFQ) to the superconducting linac (SCL3). The accelerated beams\nwill be put to use in the low energy experimental hall or accelerated again by\nthe superconducting linac (SCL2) in order to be used in the high energy\nexperimental hall. In this paper, we will describe the results of the\nstart-to-end simulations with the rare isotope beams generated by the ISOL\nsystem in the post accelerator of the RAON accelerator. In addition, the error\nanalysis and correction at the superconducting linac SCL3 will be presented.\n", "  We study the scalar kaonic states $K_{0}^{\\ast}(800)$ and\n$K_{0}^{\\ast}(1430)$ by using a relativistic QFT Lagrangian in which only a\nsingle kaonic field corresponding to the well-established scalar state\n$K_{0}^{\\ast}(1430)$ is considered and in which both derivative and\nnon-derivative interaction terms are taken into account. Even if the scalar\nspectral function shows a unique peak close to $1.4$ GeV, we find two poles in\nthe complex plane: $1.413\\pm0.002-i(0.127\\pm0.003)$ GeV, which is related to\nthe seed quark-antiquark state $K_{0}^{\\ast}(1430),$ and\n$0.746\\pm0.019-i(262\\pm0.014)$ GeV, which is an additional companion pole\nrelated to $K_{0}^{\\ast}(800)$. As a further investigation for increasing\n$N_{c}$ confirms, $K_{0}^{\\ast}(800)$ emerges as a dynamically generated\nfour-quark object as a consequence of pion-kaon loops.\n", "  Applying the dispersion approach we compute perturbative QCD corrections to\nthe power suppressed soft contribution of $B \\to \\gamma \\ell \\nu$ at leading\ntwist. QCD factorization for the $B \\to \\gamma^{\\ast}$ form factors is\ndemonstrated explicitly for the hard-collinear transverse polarized photon at\none loop, with the aid of the method of regions. While the one-loop hard\nfunction is identical to the matching coefficient of the QCD weak current $\\bar\nu \\, \\gamma_{\\mu \\perp} \\, (1- \\gamma_5) \\, b$ in soft-collinear effective\ntheory, the jet function from integrating out the hard-collinear fluctuations\ndiffers from the corresponding one entering the factorization formula of $B \\to\n\\gamma \\ell \\nu$. Furthermore, we evaluate the sub-leading power contribution\nto the $B \\to \\gamma$ form factors from the three-particle $B$-meson\ndistribution amplitudes (DAs) at tree level. The soft contribution to the $B\n\\to \\gamma$ form factors from the three-particle $B$-meson DAs is shown to be\nof the same power compared with the corresponding hard correction, in contrast\nto the two-particle counterparts. Numerically the next-to-leading-order QCD\ncorrection to the soft two-particle contribution in $B \\to \\gamma$ form factors\nwill induce an approximately $\\left (10 \\sim 20 \\right) \\%$ shift to the\ntree-level contribution at $\\lambda_B(\\mu_0)=354 \\, {\\rm MeV}$. Albeit of power\nsuppression parametrically, the soft two-particle correction can decrease the\nleading power predictions for the $B \\to \\gamma$ form factors by an amount of\n$\\left (10 \\sim 30 \\right) \\%$ with the same value of $\\lambda_B(\\mu_0)$.\nEmploying the phenomenological model of the three-particle $B$-meson DAs\ninspired by a QCD sum rule analysis, the three-particle contribution to the $B\n\\to \\gamma$ form factors is predicted to be of ${\\cal O} (1 \\%)$, at leading\norder in $\\alpha_s$, with the default theory inputs.\n", "  In the storage ring of PLS-II, we reduced mechanical displacement of electron\nbeam position monitors (e-BPMs) that is caused by heating during e-beam\nstorage. The orbit feedback system intends that the electron beam pass through\nthe center of the BPM, so to provide stable photon beam into beamlines the BPM\npickup itself must be stable to sub-micrometer precision. Thermal deformation\nof the vacuum chambers on which the BPM pickups are mounted is inevitable when\nthe electron beam current is changed by unintended beam abort. We reduced this\ndeformation by improving the vacuum chamber support and by enhancing the water\ncooling. We report the thermo-mechanical analysis and displacement measurements\nof BPM pickups after the improvements.\n", "  We compute the SBS gain for a metamaterial comprising a cubic lattice of\ndielectric spheres suspended in a background dielectric material. Theoretical\nmethods are presented to calculate the optical, acoustic, and opto-acoustic\nparameters that describe the SBS properties of the material at long\nwavelengths. Using the electromagnetic and strain energy densities we\naccurately characterise the optical and acoustic properties of the\nmetamaterial. From a combination of energy density methods and perturbation\ntheory, we recover the appropriate terms of the photoelastic tensor for the\nmetamaterial. We demonstrate that electrostriction is not necessarily the\ndominant mechanism in the enhancement and suppression of the SBS gain\ncoefficient in a metamaterial, and that other parameters, such as the Brillouin\nlinewidth, can dominate instead. Examples are presented that exhibit an order\nof magnitude enhancement in the SBS gain as well as perfect suppression.\n", "  The non-linear effects caused by the intrinsic field transverse roll-off in\nan Elliptically Polarizing Undulator with 72-mm period and maximum peak field\nof 0.72 T (EPU72) on the dynamics aperture of the Pohang Light Source II\n(PLS-II) were investigated. A kick map and Frequency map analysis both\ndemonstrated that EPU72 will not reduce the lifetime or cause injection\nproblems in PLS-II.\n", "  In probabilistic (Bayesian) inferences, we typically want to compute\nproperties of the posterior distribution, describing knowledge of unknown\nquantities in the context of a particular dataset and the assumed prior\ninformation. The marginal likelihood, also known as the \"evidence\", is a key\nquantity in Bayesian model selection. The Diffusive Nested Sampling algorithm,\na variant of Nested Sampling, is a powerful tool for generating posterior\nsamples and estimating marginal likelihoods. It is effective at solving complex\nproblems including many where the posterior distribution is multimodal or has\nstrong dependencies between variables. DNest4 is an open source (MIT licensed),\nmulti-threaded implementation of this algorithm in C++11, along with associated\nutilities including: i) RJObject, a class template for finite mixture models,\n(ii) A Python package allowing basic use without C++ coding, and iii)\nExperimental support for models implemented in Julia. In this paper we\ndemonstrate DNest4 usage through examples including simple Bayesian data\nanalysis, finite mixture models, and Approximate Bayesian Computation.\n", "  The RAON, a superconducting linear accelerator for RISP (Rare Isotope Science\nProject), will use a charge stripper in order to increase the charge states of\nthe heavy ions for effective acceleration in the higher energy part of the\nlinac. The charge stripper affects the beam qualities by scattering when the\nheavy ions go through the charge stripper. Moreover we have to select and\naccelerate proper charge states between 77+ and 81+ for uranium beam case in\norder to satisfy the beam power requirement at an IF (Inflight Fragmentation)\ntarget. This work focuses on the beam optics affected by the charge stripper in\nthe 180-dgree bending section.\n", "  We discuss the emergence of bound states in the low-energy spectrum of the\nstring-net Hamiltonian in the presence of a string tension. In the ladder\ngeometry, we show that a single bound state arises either for a finite tension\nor in the zero-tension limit depending on the theory considered. In the latter\ncase, we perturbatively compute the binding energy as a function of the total\nquantum dimension. We also address this issue in the honeycomb lattice where\nthe number of bound states in the topological phase depends on the total\nquantum dimension. Finally, the internal structure of these bound states is\nanalyzed in the zero-tension limit.\n", "  In contrast to a Hermitian system, in which zero modes are usually degenerate\nand localized edge state in the thermodynamic limit, the zero mode of a finite\nnon-Hermitian system can be a single nontrivial long-range entangled state at\nthe exceptional point (EP). In this work, we demonstrate this feature with a\nconcrete example based on exact solutions. Numerical simulations show that the\nentangled state can be generated through the dynamic process with a high\nfidelity.\n", "  We analyse the production of a top quark pair through a heavy scalar at the\nLHC. We first review the main features of the signal as well as the\ninterference with the top-anti-top background at leading order in QCD. We then\nstudy higher order QCD effects. While the background and the signal can be\nobtained at NNLO and NLO in QCD respectively, that is not the case for their\ninterference, which is currently known only at LO. In order to improve the\naccuracy of the prediction for the interference term, we consider the effects\nof extra QCD radiation, i.e. the $2 \\to 3$ (loop-induced) processes and obtain\nan estimate of the NLO corrections. As a result, we find that the contribution\nof the interference is important both at the total cross-section level and,\nmost importantly, for the line-shape of the heavy scalar. In particular for\nresonances with widths larger than a couple of percent of the resonance mass,\nthe interference term distorts the invariant mass distribution and generically\nleads to a non-trivial peak-dip structure. We study this process in a\nsimplified model involving an additional scalar or pseudoscalar resonance as\nwell as in the Two-Higgs-Doublet-Model for a set of representative benchmarks.\nWe present the constraints on simplified models featuring an extra scalar as\nset by the LHC searches for top-anti-top resonances, and the implications of\nthe 750 GeV diphoton excess recently reported by CMS and ATLAS for the top pair\nproduction assuming a scalar or a pseudoscalar resonance.\n", "  This paper describes the design study of a gantry for a carbon beam. The\ndesigned gantry is compact such that its size is comparable to the size of the\nproton gantry. This is possible by introducing superconducting double helical\ncoils for dipole magnets. The gantry optics is designed in such a way that it\nprovides rotation-invariant optics and variable beam size as well as\npoint-to-parallel scanning of a beam. For large-aperture magnet,\nthree-dimensional magnetic field distribution is obtained by invoking a\ncomputer code, and a number of particles are tracked by integrating equations\nof motion numerically together with three-dimensional interpolation. The\nbeam-shape distortion due to the fringe field is reduced to an acceptable level\nby optimizing the coil windings with the help of genetic algorithm.\nHigher-order transfer coefficients are calculated and shown to be reduced\ngreatly with appropriate optimization of the coil windings.\n", "  A microwave ion source is used as an ion source of 100-MeV proton accelerator\nat Korea Multipurpose Accelerator Complex (KOMAC). The specifications of the\nion source are 50 keV in energy and 20 mA in peak current. The plasma is\noperated in CW mode using magnetron and the pulse beam is extracted using\nsemiconductor switch located in the extraction power supply. The beam\ncharacteristics were measured based on the pulse voltage and current. A test\nstand was also installed to study the beam characteristics of the ion source in\noff-line. In this paper, the pulse beam characteristics of the ion source are\npresented and the installation of the test stand is reported.\n", "  A progogype 5-GHz 500-kW CW klystron (model E3762 provided by Toshiba\nElectron Tubes & Devices Co. Ltd.) has been operating as the RF source for the\nlower hybrid current drive (LHCD) system in the KSTAR tokamak. In order to\ninvestigate how the efficiency of the 5-GHz 500-kW CW klystron prototype could\nbe enhanced, the cavity design study is being carried out with simulation code\nbased on the main klystron operation parameters. This is being done by\nsimulating klystron performances for various cavity parameters including the\nnumber of cavities, inter-cavity distance, and cavity tuning frequencies. The\nsimulation has been done with the FCI (field charge interaction) code aided by\na matlab script for scanning input parameters. Initial set of scan parameters\nwas obtained by benchmarking the E3762 klystron. It was possible to obtain\noptimized design parameters with better efficiency for a cavity system adopting\na multi-cell output cavity. However, the multi-cell output cavity is prone to\nproduce a self-oscillation due to the prolonged (several half RF periods)\nbeam-field interaction along its multiple gaps. We have checked the feasibility\nof the optimization by evaluating the stability of output cavity system. The\nstability is given by the ratio of a beam-loading conductance to the circuit\nconductance.\n", "  We present a method for optimization of the multi-turn injection effciency\nfor medical synchrotron. We show that for given injection energy the injection\nefficiency can be greatly enhanced by choosing transverse tunes appropriately\nas well as optimizing the injection bump and the number of turns required for\nbeam injection. We verify our study by applying the method to the Korea Heavy\nIon Medical Accelerator (KHIMA) synchrotron which is currently built at the\ncampus of Dongnam Institute of Radiological and Medical Sciences (DIRAMS) in\nBusan, Korea. First the frequency map analysis is performed with the help of\nELEGANT and ACCSIM codes. The tunes which yield the good injection efficiency\nare then selected. With these tunes the injection bump and the number of turns\nrequired for injection are then optimized by tracking a number of particles up\nto one thousand turns after injection beyond which there is no further beam\nloss. Results for optimization of the injection efficiency for proton ion are\npresented.\n", "  We present a parametrization of the pair correlation function and the static\nstructure factor of the Coulomb one component plasma (OCP) from the weakly\ncoupled regime to the strongly coupled regime. Recent experiments strongly\nsuggest that the OCP model can play the role of a reference system for warm\ndense matter. It can provide the ionic static structure factor that is\nnecessary to interpret the x-ray Thomson scattering measurements, for instance.\nWe illustrate this with the interpretation of a x-ray diffraction spectrum\nrecently measured, using a Bayesian method that requires many evaluations of\nthe static structure factor to automatically calibrate the parameters. For\nstrongly coupled dusty plasmas, the proposed parametrization of the Coulomb OCP\npair correlation function can be related to the Yukawa one, including\nscreening. Further prospects to parametrize the static structure of Yukawa\nsystems are also discussed.\n", "  We have utilised a high spatial resolution imaging method, Differential Phase\nContrast (DPC) performed in a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM),\nfor precise measurement of the magnetic induction distribution in skyrmion\nstates in noncentrosymmetric magnetically ordered materials. Applied to\ninvestigate the internal structure of hexagonal skyrmion lattice cells,\nstabilised by an out-plane applied magnetic field in an FeGe nanowedge\nspecimen, mapping of the in-plane component of magnetic induction has yielded\n\"average\" skyrmion profiles and observation of internal six-fold symmetry. With\nincreasing field strength, the diameter of \"average\" skyrmion cores was\nobserved to decrease accompanied by a non-linear variation of the lattice\nperiodicity. Variations in structure for individual skyrmions were studied\nutilising an advanced DPC detection scheme with a variety of symmetry lowering\ndistortions being observed. Our observations are consistent with a theoretical\nphenomenological model, which has predicted the structure of hexagonal skyrmion\nlattice cells and also that twisting states near to the material surfaces\nprovide a basis for energetic stabilisation of the skyrmion lattice over the\nconical phase. There was good agreement with experiment for predictions of bulk\nskyrmion structure and their response (core-size & lattice periodicity\nvariation) to an applied field.\n", "  We investigate homogeneous nuclear matter within the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock\n(BHF) approach in the limits of isospin-symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) as well\nas pure neutron matter at zero temperature. The study is based on realistic\nrepresentations of the internucleon interaction as given by Argonne v18, Paris,\nNijmegen I and II potentials, in addition to chiral N$^{3}$LO interactions,\nincluding three-nucleon forces up to N$^{2}$LO. Particular attention is paid to\nthe presence of di-nucleon bound states structures in $^1\\textrm{S}_0$ and\n$^3\\textrm{SD}_1$ channels, whose explicit account becomes crucial for the\nstability of self-consistent solutions at low densities. A characterization of\nthese solutions and associated bound states is discussed. We confirm that\ncoexisting BHF single-particle solutions in SNM, at Fermi momenta in the range\n$0.13-0.3$~fm$^{-1}$, is a robust feature under the choice of realistic\ninternucleon potentials.\n", "  We investigate the properties of parity-time symmetric periodic photonic\nstructures using Heesh-Shubnikov group theory. Classical group theory cannot be\nused to categorize the symmetry of the eigenmodes because the time-inversion\noperator is antiunitary. Fortunately, corepresentations of Heesh-Shubnikov\ngroups have been developed to characterize the effect of antiunitary operators\non eigenfunctions. Using the example structure of a one-dimensional photonic\nlattice, we identify the corepresentations of eigenmodes at both low and high\nsymmetry points in the photonic band diagram. We find that thresholdless\nparity-time transitions are associated with particular classes of\ncorepresentations. The approach is completely general and can be applied to\nparity-time symmetric photonic lattices of any dimension. The predictive power\nof this approach provides a powerful design tool for parity-time symmetric\nphotonic device design.\n", "  The susceptibility of finite-density QCD matter to vorticity is introduced,\nas an analog of magnetic susceptibility. It describes the spin polarization of\nquarks and antiquarks in finite-density QCD matter induced by rotation. We\nestimate this quantity in the chirally broken phase using the mixed\ngauge-gravity anomaly at finite baryon density. It is proposed that the\nvortical susceptibility of QCD matter is responsible for the polarization of\n$\\Lambda$ and ${\\bar \\Lambda}$ hyperons observed recently in heavy ion\ncollisions at RHIC by the STAR Collaboration.\n", "  We extend our lattice QCD potential based study arXiv:1509.07366 (JHEP 1512\n(2015) 101) of the in-medium properties of heavy quark bound states to P-wave\nbottomonium and charmonium. Similar to the behavior found in the S-wave channel\ntheir spectra show a characteristic broadening, as well as mass shifts to lower\nenergy with increasing temperature. In contrast to the S-wave states, finite\nangular momentum leads to the survival of spectral peaks even at temperatures,\nwhere the continuum threshold reaches below the bound state remnant mass. We\nelaborate on the ensuing challenges in defining quarkonium dissolution, present\nestimates of melting temperatures for the spin averaged $\\chi_b$ and $\\chi_c$\nstates and contrast the findings to recent direct lattice NRQCD studies of\nP-wave quarkonium. As an application to heavy-ion collisions we estimate the\ncontribution of feed down to S-wave quarkonium through the P-wave states after\nfreezeout.\n", "  We study valence fluctuations in the extended Anderson model on\ntwo-dimensional Penrose lattice, using the real-space dynamical mean-field\ntheory combined with the continuous-time Monte Carlo method. Calculating\n$f$-electron number, $c$-$f$ spin correlations, and magnetic susceptibility at\neach site, we find site-dependent formations of the singlet state and valence\ndistribution at low temperatures, which are reflected by the quasiperiodic\nlattice structure. The bulk magnetic susceptibility is also addressed.\n", "  We consider quantum field theories on supermanifolds using integral forms.\nThe latter are used to define a geometric theory of integration and they are\nessential for a consistent action principle. The construction relies on Picture\nChanging Operators, analogous to the one introduced in String Theory. As an\napplication, we construct a geometric action principle for N=1 D=3\nsuper-Chern-Simons theory.\n", "  The possibility that the so-called \"lithium problem\", i.e. the disagreement\nbetween the theoretical abundance predicted for primordial $^7$Li assuming\nstandard nucleosynthesis and the value inferred from astrophysical\nmeasurements, can be solved through a non-thermal BBN mechanism has been\ninvestigated by several authors. In particular, it has been shown that the\ndecay of a MeV-mass particle, like, e.g., a sterile neutrino, decaying after\nBBN not only solves the lithium problem, but also satisfies cosmological and\nlaboratory bounds, making such a scenario worth to be investigated in further\ndetail. In this paper, we constrain the parameters of the model with the\ncombination of current data, including Planck 2015 measurements of temperature\nand polarization anisotropies of the CMB, FIRAS limits on spectral distortions,\nastrophysical measurements of primordial abundances and laboratory constraints.\nWe find that a sterile neutrino with mass $M_S=4.35_{-0.17}^{+0.13}\\,MeV$ (at\n$95\\%$ c.l.), a decay time $\\tau_S=1.8_{-1.3}^{+2.5}\\cdot 10^5\\,s$ (at $95\\%$\nc.l.) and an initial density $\\bar{n}_S/\\bar{n}_{cmb}=1.7_{-0.6}^{+3.5}\\cdot\n10^{-4}$ (at $95\\%$ c.l.) in units of the number density of CMB photons,\nperfectly accounts for the difference between predicted and observed $^7$Li\nprimordial abundance. This model also predicts an increase of the effective\nnumber of relativistic degrees of freedom at the time of CMB decoupling $\\Delta\nN_{eff}^{cmb}\\equiv N_{eff}^{cmb}-3.046=0.34_{-0.14}^{+0.16}$ at $95\\%$ c.l..\nThe required abundance of sterile neutrinos is incompatible with the standard\nthermal history of the Universe, but could be realized in a low reheating\ntemperature scenario. We provide forecasts for future experiments finding that\nthe combination of measurements from the COrE+ and PIXIE missions will allow to\nsignificantly reduce the permitted region for the sterile lifetime and density.\n", "  For the search for additional Higgs bosons in the Minimal Supersymmetric\nStandard Model (MSSM) as well as for future precision analyses in the Higgs\nsector precise knowledge of their production properties is mandatory. We\nevaluate the cross sections for the charged Higgs boson production at e+e-\ncolliders in the MSSM with complex parameters (cMSSM). The evaluation is based\non a full one-loop calculation of the production mechanism e+e- -> H+H- and\ne+e- -> H^\\pm W^\\mp, including soft and hard QED radiation. The dependence of\nthe Higgs boson production cross sections on the relevant cMSSM parameters is\nanalyzed numerically. We find sizable contributions to many cross sections.\nThey are, depending on the production channel, roughly of 5-10% of the\ntree-level results, but can go up to 20% or higher. The full one-loop\ncontributions are important for a future linear e+e- collider such as the ILC\nor CLIC.\n", "  Nonclassical states of macroscopic objects are promising for ultrasensitive\nmetrology as well as testing quantum mechanics. In this work, we investigate\ndissipative mechanical quantum state engineering in an optically levitated\nnanodiamond. First, we study single-mode mechanical squeezed states by\nmagnetically coupling the mechanical motion to a dressed three-level system\nprovided by a Nitrogen-vacancy center in the nanoparticle. Quantum coherence\nbetween the dressed levels is created via microwave fields to induce a\ntwo-phonon transition, which results in mechanical squeezing. Remarkably, we\nfind that in ultrahigh vacuum quantum squeezing is achievable at room\ntemperature with feedback cooling. For moderate vacuum, quantum squeezing is\npossible with cryogenic temperature. Second, we present a setup for two\nmechanical modes coupled to the dressed three levels, which results in two-mode\nsqueezing analogous to the mechanism of the single-mode case. In contrast to\nprevious works, our study provides a deterministic method for engineering\nmacroscopic squeezed states without the requirement for a cavity.\n", "  In previous work, we have shown that elliptic fibrations with two sections,\nor Mordell-Weil rank one, can always be mapped birationally to a Weierstrass\nmodel of a certain form, namely, the Jacobian of a $\\mathbb{P}^{112}$ model.\nMost constructions of elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau manifolds with two\nsections have been carried out assuming that the image of this birational map\nwas a \"minimal\" Weierstrass model. In this paper, we show that for some\nelliptically fibered Calabi-Yau manifolds with Mordell-Weil rank-one, the\nJacobian of the $\\mathbb{P}^{112}$ model is not minimal. Said another way,\nstarting from a Calabi-Yau Weierstrass model, the total space must be blown up\n(thereby destroying the \"Calabi-Yau\" property) in order to embed the model into\n$\\mathbb{P}^{112}$. In particular, we show that the elliptic fibrations studied\nrecently by Klevers and Taylor fall into this class of models.\n", "  This presentation focuses on the optimization of the trigger unit of a\nsix-rod TVS. The different configurations of the trigger pin and of the trigger\nelectrode have been considered to study the electric field distribution at the\ntriple points of the unit embedded in the cathode. To optimize the field\nenhancement, electric field simulations with a planar and a circular heads of\nthe trigger pin in combinations with a convex and a concave shaped trigger\nelectrodes have been done. The simulations were done with an applied trigger\npulse voltage of Utrigger = 5 kV and with a discharge voltage the main switch\nof Uswitch = 20 kV. The experimental values had been Utrigger = 40 kV and\nUswitch = 5 kV. The simulation results show that the combination of a circular\ntrigger pin head and a concave trigger electrode yields the highest electric\nfield of 9.6 .106 V/m at the triple point. In-parallel experiments have been\nperformed with those four trigger configurations. The results of the\nexperiments however cannot yet clearly confirm the trend in the results of the\nfield simulations.\n", "  We propose and experimentally demonstrate a tunable band-notched line-defect\nwaveguide in a surface-wave photonic crystal, which consists of a straight\nline-defect waveguide and side-coupled defect cavities. A tunable narrow\nstopband can be observed in the broadband transmission spectra. We also\ndemonstrate that both the filtering levels and filtering frequencies of the\nband-notched line-defect waveguide can be conveniently tuned through changing\nthe total number and the pillar height of the side-coupled defect cavities. The\nband-notch function is based on the idea that the propagating surface modes\nwith the resonance frequencies of the side-coupled defect cavities will be\ntightly localized around the defect sites, being filtered from the waveguide\noutput. Transmission spectra measurements and direct near-field profiles\nimaging are performed at microwave frequencies to verify our idea and design.\nThese results may enable new band-notched devices design and provide routes for\nthe realization of tunable surface-wave filters on a single metal surface.\n", "  We consider vacuum decay in the presence of a non-minimal coupling to\ngravity. We extend the usual thin-wall solution to include the non-minimal\ncoupling. We also perform a full numerical study and discuss the validity of\nthe new thin-wall approximation. Implications of a large cosmological constant,\nwhose influence on the geometry boosts the tunnelling rate, are discussed. Our\nresults show that the influence of the non-minimal coupling differs\nsignificantly between the cases of Minkowski and deSitter backgrounds. In the\nlatter the decay probability quickly decreases when the coupling grows and in\nfact the vacuum can be made absolutely stable simply due to introduction of the\nnon-minimal coupling. In the case of Minkowski background the effect is much\nweaker and the decay rate even increases for small values of the non-minimal\ncoupling.\n", "  The performance of mid-infrared erbium doped fiber lasers has dramatically\nimproved in the last few years. In this paper we present a numerical model that\nprovides valuable insight into the dynamics of a dual-wavelength pumped fiber\nlaser that can operate on the 3.5 micron and 2.8 micron bands. This model is a\nmuch needed tool for optimizing and understanding the performance of these\nlaser systems. Comparisons between simulation and experimental results for\nthree different systems are presented.\n", "  We discuss different models for the spin structure of the nonperturbative\npomeron: scalar, vector, and rank-2 symmetric tensor. The ratio of\nsingle-helicity-flip to helicity-conserving amplitudes in polarised high-energy\nproton-proton elastic scattering, known as the complex r_5 parameter, is\ncalculated for these models. We compare our results to experimental data from\nthe STAR experiment. We show that the spin-0 (scalar) pomeron model is clearly\nexcluded by the data, while the vector pomeron is inconsistent with the rules\nof quantum field theory. The tensor pomeron is found to be perfectly consistent\nwith the STAR data.\n", "  The EDELWEISS-III direct dark matter search experiment uses cryogenic HP-Ge\ndetectors Fully covered with Inter-Digitized electrodes (FID). They are\noperated at low fields ($<1\\;\\mathrm{V/cm}$), and as a consequence\ncharge-carrier trapping significantly affects both the ionization and heat\nenergy measurements. This paper describes an analytical model of the signals\ninduced by trapped charges in FID detectors based on the Shockley-Ramo theorem.\nIt is used to demonstrate that veto electrodes, initially designed for the sole\npurpose of surface event rejection, can be used to provide a sensitivity to the\ndepth of the energy deposits, characterize the trapping in the crystals,\nperform heat and ionization energy corrections and improve the ionization\nbaseline resolutions. These procedures are applied successfully to actual data.\n", "  The electron-positron pair production accompanying interaction of a\ncircularly polarized laser pulse with a foil is studied for laser intensities\nhigher than $10^{24}$W cm$^{-2}$. The laser energy penetrates into the foil due\nto the effect of the relativistic hole-boring. It is demonstrated that the\nelectron-positron plasma is produced as a result of quantum-electrodynamical\ncascading in the field of the incident and reflected laser light in front of\nthe foil. The incident and reflected laser light makes up the circularly\npolarized standing wave in the reference frame of the hole-boring front and the\npair density peaks near the nodes and antinodes of the wave. A model based on\nthe particle dynamics with radiation reaction effect near the magnetic nodes is\ndeveloped. The model predictions are verified by 3D PIC-MC simulations.\n", "  We study DNA denaturation by integrating elasticity -- as described by the\nGaussian network model -- with bond binding energies, distinguishing between\ndifferent base-pair and stacking energies. We use exact calculation, within the\nmodel, of the Helmholtz free-energy of any partial denaturation state, which\nimplies that the entropy of all formed bubbles (\"loops\") is accounted for.\nConsidering base-pair bond removal single events, the bond designated for\nopening is chosen by minimizing the free-energy difference for the process,\nover all remaining base-pair bonds. Despite of its great simplicity, for\nseveral known DNA sequences our results are in accord with available\ntheoretical and experimental studies. Moreover, we report free-energy profiles\nalong the denaturation pathway, which allow to detect stable or meta-stable\npartial denaturation states, composed of \"bubbles\", as local free-energy minima\nseparated by barriers. Our approach allows to study very long DNA strands with\ncommonly available computational power, as we demonstrate for a few random\nsequences in the range 200-800 base-pairs. For the latter we also elucidate the\nself-averaging property of the system. Implications for the well known\nbreathing dynamics of DNA are elucidated.\n", "  When a laser passes through underdense plasmas, Raman and Brillouin\nBackscattering can reflect a substantial portion of the incident laser energy.\nThis is a major loss mechanism, for example, in employing lasers in inertial\nconfinement fusion. However, by slow rotation of the incident linear\npolarization, the overall reflectivity can be reduced significantly. Particle\nin cell simulations show that, for parameters similar to those of indirect\ndrive fusion experiments, polarization rotation reduces the reflectivity by a\nfactor of $5$. A general, fluid-model based, analytical estimation for the\nreflectivity reduction agrees with simulations. However, in identifying the\nsource of the backscatter reduction, it is difficult to disentangle the\nrotating polarization from the frequency separation based approach used to\nengineer the beam's polarization. Although the backscatter reduction arises\nsimilarly to other approaches that employ frequency separation, in the case\nhere, the intensity remains constant in time.\n", "  We point out that when doubly-charged bileptons are pair produced at the LHC,\nkinematics dictate that they are both almost at rest in the lab frame and\ntherefore their decays lead to final state muons in a characteristic X-shape\nwith only very tiny track curvature because of the high muon energies. Such\nX-events have essentially no standard model background and provide a smoking\ngun for the 331 model.\n", "  We present the reduction of the correlation functions of the Ising model on\nthe anisotropic square lattice to complete elliptic integrals of the first,\nsecond and third kind, the extension of Kramers-Wannier duality to anisotropic\ncorrelation functions, and the linear differential equations for these\nanisotropic correlations. More precisely, we show that the anisotropic\ncorrelation functions are homogeneous polynomials of the complete elliptic\nintegrals of the first, second and third kind. We give the exact dual\ntransformation matching the correlation functions and the dual correlation\nfunctions. We show that the linear differential operators annihilating the\ngeneral two-point correlation functions are factorised in a very simple way, in\noperators of decreasing orders.\n", "  Formation of high spatial frequency laser induced periodic surface structures\n(HSFL) in germanium by femtosecond mid-IR pulses with wavelengths between\n$\\lambda=2.0$ and $3.6 \\; \\mathrm{\\mu m}$ was studied with varying angle of\nincidence and polarization. The period of these structures varied from\n$\\lambda/3$ to $\\lambda/8$. A modified surface-scattering model including Drude\nexcitation and the optical Kerr effect explains spatial period scaling of HSFL\nacross the mid-IR wavelengths. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) shows the\npresence of a $30 \\; \\mathrm{n m}$ amorphous layer above the structure of\ncrystalline germanium. Various mechanisms including two photon absorption and\ndefect-induced amorphization are discussed as probable causes for the formation\nof this layer.\n", "  Even denominator fractional quantum Hall states in a ZnO quantum well reveal\ninteresting phase transitions in a tilted magnetic field. We have analyzed the\nplanar electron gas in ZnO, confined in a parabolic potential in the third\ndimension, perpendicular to the plane of the electron gas. Since the Landau\nlevel gap is very small in this system we have included the screened Coulomb\npotential in order to include the effects of all the Landau levels. We observe\nan incompressible state - compressible state phase transition induced by the\ntilted field. Additionally, the 5/2 state has been experimentally found to be\nmissing in this system. We however propose that a wider quantum well may help\nto stabilize the incompressible phase at the 5/2 filling factor.\n", "  The black hole information paradox is among the most outstanding puzzles in\nphysics. I argue here there is yet another black hole quandary which, in light\nof the recent direct detection of gravitational waves by Advanced LIGO, reveals\na new window to probe the nature of spacetime in the forthcoming era of\n'precision gravity.'\n", "  Comment on O. Gendelman, Y. G. Pollack, I. Procaccia, S. Sengupta, and J.\nZylberg, Physical Review Letters 116, 078001 (2016).\n", "  There exists a fundamental tradeoff between spectral resolution and the\nefficiency or throughput for all optical spectrometers. The primary factors\naffecting the spectral resolution and throughput of an optical spectrometer are\nthe size of the entrance aperture and the optical power of the focusing\nelement. Thus far collective optimization of the above mentioned has proven\ndifficult. Here, we introduce the concept of high-throughput computational\nslits (HTCS), a numerical technique for improving both the effective spectral\nresolution and efficiency of a spectrometer. The proposed HTCS approach was\nexperimentally validated using an optical spectrometer configured with a 200 um\nentrance aperture, test, and a 50 um entrance aperture, control, demonstrating\nimprovements in spectral resolution of the spectrum by ~ 50% over the control\nspectral resolution and improvements in efficiency of > 2 times over the\nefficiency of the largest entrance aperture used in the study while producing\nhighly accurate spectra.\n", "  The PLS-II has a 100 MeV pre-injector for the 3 GeV Linac. A thermionic gun\nproduces electron charge of 200 pC with a bunch duration of 500 ps by a 250 ps\ntriggering pulser. At the pre-injector, one of the most important beam\nparameters to identify the beam quality is a transverse emittance of electron\nbunches. Therefore we measure the beam emittance and twiss functions at 100 MeV\nin order to match the beam optics to beam transport line and go through it to\nthe storage ring. To get the transverse emittance measurement, well-known\ntechnique, quadrupole scan, is used at the pre-injector. The emittance were\n0.591 mm-mrad in horizontal and 0.774 mm-mrad in vertical direction.\n", "  We study the scenario of higgsino dark matter in the context of a\nnon-standard cosmology with a period of matter-domination prior to Big-Bang\nnucleosynthesis. Matter-domination changes the dark matter relic abundance if\nit ends via reheating to a temperature below the higgsino thermal freeze-out\ntemperature. We perform a model independent analysis of the higgsino dark\nmatter production in such scenario. We show that light higgsino-type dark\nmatter is possible for reheating temperatures close to 1 GeV. We study the\nimpact of dark matter indirect detection and collider physics in this context.\nWe show that Fermi-LAT data rules out non-thermal higgsinos with masses below\n300 GeV. Future indirect dark matter searches from Fermi-LAT and CTA would be\nable to cover essentially the full parameter space. Contrary to the thermal\ncase, collider signals from a 100 TeV collider could fully test the non-thermal\nhiggsino. In the second part of the paper we discuss the motivation of such\nnon-thermal cosmology from the perspective of string theory with late-time\ndecaying moduli for both KKLT and LVS moduli stabilization mechanisms. We\ndescribe the impact of embedding dark matter higgsino in these scenarios.\n", "  The Coleman formula for vacuum decay and bubble nucleation has been used to\nestimate the tunneling rate in models of axion monodromy in recent literature.\nHowever, several of Coleman's original assumptions do not hold for such models.\nHere we derive a new estimate with this in mind using a similar Euclidean\nprocedure. We find that there are significant regions of parameter space for\nwhich the tunneling rate in axion monodromy is not well approximated by the\nColeman formula. However, there is also a regime relevant to large field\ninflation in which both estimates parametrically agree. We also briefly comment\non the applications of our results to the relaxion scenario.\n", "  We prove that the normalisation of the stationary state of the multi-species\nasymmetric simple exclusion process (mASEP) is a specialisation of a\nKoornwinder polynomial. As a corollary we obtain that the normalisation of\nmASEP factorises as a product over multiple copies of the two-species ASEP.\n", "  Observations of jets in X-ray binaries show a correlation between radio power\nand black hole spin. This correlation, if confirmed, points towards the idea\nthat relativistic jets may be powered by the rotational energy of black holes.\nIn order to examine this further, we perform general-relativistic radiative\ntransport calculations on magnetically arrested accretion flows, which are\nknown to produce powerful jets via the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism. We find\nthat the X-ray and gamma-ray emission strongly depend on spin and inclination\nangle. Surprisingly, the high-energy power does not show the same dependence on\nspin as the BZ jet power, but instead can be understood as a redshift effect.\nIn particular, photons observed perpendicular to the spin axis suffer little\nnet redshift until originating from close to the horizon. Such observers see\ndeeper into the hot, dense, highly-magnetized inner disk region. This effect is\nlargest for rapidly rotating black holes due to a combination of frame dragging\nand decreasing horizon radius. While the X-ray emission is dominated by the\nnear horizon region, the near-infrared radiation originates at larger radii.\nTherefore, the ratio of X-ray to near-infrared power is an observational\nsignature of black hole spin.\n", "  The model of self-avoiding lattice walks and the asymptotic analysis of\npower-series have been two of the major research themes of Tony Guttmann. In\nthis paper we bring the two together and perform a new analysis of the\ngenerating functions for the number of square lattice self-avoiding walks and\nsome of their metric properties such as the mean-square end-to-end distance.\nThe critical point $x_c$ for self-avoiding walks is known to a high degree of\naccuracy and we utilise this knowledge to undertake a new numerical analysis of\nthe series using biased differential approximants. The new method is major\nadvance in asymptotic power-series analysis in that it allows us to bias\ndifferential approximants to have a singularity of order $q$ at $x_c$. When\nbiasing at $x_c$ with $q\\geq 2$ the analysis yields a very accurate estimate\nfor the critical exponent $\\gamma=1.3437500(3)$ thus confirming the conjectured\nexact value $\\gamma=43/32$ to 8 significant digits and removing a long-standing\nminor discrepancy between exact and numerical results. The analysis of the\nmean-square end-to-end distance yields $\\nu=0.7500002(4)$ thus confirming the\nexact value $\\nu=3/4$ to 7 significant digits.\n", "  Resonant magnetic perturbations (RMP) have extensively been demonstrated as a\nplausible technique for mitigating or suppressing large edge localized modes\n(ELMs). Associated with this is a substantial amount of theory and modelling\nefforts during recent years. Various models describing the plasma response to\nthe RMP fields have been proposed in the literature, and are briefly reviewed\nin this work. Despite their simplicity, linear response models can provide\nalternative criteria, than the vacuum field based criteria, for guiding the\nchoice of the coil configurations to achieve the best control of ELMs. The role\nof the edge peeling response to the RMP fields is illustrated as a key\nindicator for the ELM mitigation in low collisionality plasmas, in various\ntokamak devices.\n", "  We study the dynamo instability for a Kazantsev-Kraichnan flow with three\nvelocity components that depends only on two-dimensions u = (u(x, y, t), v(x,\ny, t), w(x, y, t)) often referred to as 2.5 dimensional (2.5D) flow. Within the\nKazantsev-Kraichnan frame- work we derive the governing equations for the\nsecond order magnetic field correlation function and examine the growth rate of\nthe dynamo instability as a function of the control parameters of the system.\nIn particular we investigate the dynamo behaviour for large magnetic Reynolds\nnumbers Rm and flows close to being two-dimensional and show that these two\nlimiting procedures do not commute. The energy spectra of the unstable modes\nare derived analytically and lead to power-law behaviour that differs from the\nthree dimensional and two dimensional case. The results of our analytical\ncalculation are compared with the results of numerical simulations of dynamos\ndriven by prescribed fluctuating flows as well as freely evolving turbulent\nflows, showing good agreement.\n", "  Sub-Doppler, saturation dip, spectra of lines in the $v_1 + v_3$, $v_1 +\n2v_4$ and $v_3 + 2v_4$ bands of $^{14}$NH$_3$ have been measured by frequency\ncomb-referenced diode laser absorption spectroscopy. The observed spectral line\nwidths are dominated by transit time broadening, but show resolved or\npartially-resolved hyperfine splittings that are primarily determined by the\n$^{14}$N quadrupole coupling. Modeling of the observed line shapes based on the\nknown hyperfine level structure of the ground state of the molecule shows that,\nin nearly all cases, the excited state level has hyperfine splittings similar\nto the same rotational level in the ground state. The data provide accurate\nfrequencies for the line positions and easily separate lines overlapped in\nDoppler-limited spectra. The observed hyperfine splittings can be used to make\nand confirm rotational assignments and ground state combination differences\nobtained from the measured frequencies are comparable in accuracy to those\nobtained from conventional microwave spectroscopy. One upper state level shows\nvery clear differences from the expected splittings. Examination of the known\nvibration-rotation level structure shows there is a near degeneracy between\nthis level in $v_1+v_3$ and a rotational level in the $v_1 + 2v_4$ manifold\nwhich is of the appropriate symmetry to be mixed by magnetic hyperfine terms\nthat couple ortho- and para- forms of the molecule.\n", "  In this paper we consider the parametrizations of gluon transverse momentum\ndependent (TMD) correlators in terms of TMD parton distribution functions\n(PDFs). These functions, referred to as TMDs, are defined as the Fourier\ntransforms of hadronic matrix elements of nonlocal combinations of gluon\nfields. The nonlocality is bridged by gauge links, which have characteristic\npaths (future or past pointing), giving rise to a process dependence that\nbreaks universality. For gluons, the specific correlator with one future and\none past pointing gauge link is, in the limit of small $x$, related to a\ncorrelator of a single Wilson loop. We present the parametrization of Wilson\nloop correlators in terms of Wilson loop TMDs and discuss the relation between\nthese functions and the small-$x$ `dipole' gluon TMDs. This analysis shows\nwhich gluon TMDs are leading or suppressed in the small-$x$ limit. We discuss\nhadronic targets that are unpolarized, vector polarized (relevant for\nspin-$1/2$ and spin-$1$ hadrons), and tensor polarized (relevant for spin-$1$\nhadrons). The latter are of interest for studies with a future Electron-Ion\nCollider with polarized deuterons.\n", "  The correspondence between on-shell diagrams in maximally supersymmetric\nYang-Mills theory and cluster varieties in the Grassmannian remains largely\nunexplored beyond the planar limit. In this article, we describe a systematic\nprogram to survey such 'on-shell varieties', and use this to provide a complete\nclassification in the case of $G(3,6)$. In particular, we find exactly 24\ntop-dimensional varieties and 10 co-dimension one varieties in $G(3,6)$---up to\nparity and relabeling of the external legs. We use this case to illustrate some\nof the novelties found for non-planar varieties relative to the case of\npositroids, and describe some of the features that we expect to hold more\ngenerally.\n", "  Dirac and Weyl semimetals form an ideal platform for testing ideas developed\nin high energy physics to describe massless relativistic particles. One such\nquintessentially field-theoretic idea of chiral anomaly already resulted in the\nprediction and subsequent observation of the pronounced negative\nmagnetoresistance in these novel materials for parallel electric and magnetic\nfields. Here we predict that the chiral anomaly occurs - and has experimentally\nobservable consequences - when real electromagnetic fields E and B are replaced\nby strain-induced pseudo-electromagnetic fields e and b. For example, a uniform\npseudomagnetic field b is generated when a Weyl semimetal nanowire is put under\ntorsion. In accord with the chiral anomaly equation we predict a negative\ncontribution to the wire resistance proportional to the square of the torsion\nstrength. Remarkably, left and right moving chiral modes are then spatially\nsegregated to the bulk and surface of the wire forming a \"topological coaxial\ncable\". This produces hydrodynamic flow with potentially very long relaxation\ntime. Another effect we predict is the ultrasonic attenuation and\nelectromagnetic emission due to a time periodic mechanical deformation causing\npseudoelectric field e. These novel manifestations of the chiral anomaly are\nmost striking in the semimetals with a single pair of Weyl nodes but also occur\nin Dirac semimetals such as Cd3As2 and Na3Bi and Weyl semimetals with unbroken\ntime reversal symmetry.\n", "  A recent comment highlights a discussion at the PATRAS Workshop on Axions,\nWIMPs and WISPs relating to a recent publication. We respond to this comment,\nand detail a calculation error in the original letter.\n", "  We report on the development of a diode laser system - the `Faraday laser' -\nusing an atomic Faraday filter as the frequency-selective element. In contrast\nto typical external-cavity diode laser systems which offer tunable output\nfrequency but require additional control systems in order to achieve a stable\noutput frequency, our system only lases at a single frequency, set by the peak\ntransmission frequency of the internal atomic Farady filter. Our system has\nboth short-term and long-term stability of less than 1~MHz, which is less than\nthe natural linewidth of alkali-atomic D-lines, making similar systems suitable\nfor use as a `turn-key' solution for laser cooling experiments.\n", "  Conical intersections (CI) between molecular potential energy surfaces with\nnon-vanishing non-adiabatic couplings generally occur in any molecule\nconsisting of at least three atoms. They play a fundamental role in describing\nthe molecular dynamics beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation and have been\nused to understand a large variety of effects, from photofragmentation and\nisomerization to more exotic applications such as exciton fission in\nsemiconductors. However, few studies have used the features of a CI as a tool\nfor coherent control. Here we demonstrate two modes of control around a conical\nintersection. The first uses a continuous light field to control the population\non the two intersecting electronic states in the vicinity of a CI. The second\nuses a pulsed light field to control wavepackets that are subjected to the\ngeometric phase shift in transit around a CI. This second technique is likely\nto be useful for studying the role of nuclear dynamics in electronic coherence\nphenomena.\n", "  Topological Insulator-based devices can transport electrons/photons at the\nsurfaces of materials without any back reflections, even in the presence of\nobstacles. Topological properties have recently been studied using\nnon-reciprocal materials such as gyromagnetics or using bianisotropy. However,\nthese effects usually saturate at optical frequencies and limit our ability to\nscale down devices. In order to implement topological devices that we introduce\nin this paper for the terahertz range, we show that semiconductors can be\nutilized via their cyclotron resonance in combination with small magnetic\nfields. We propose novel terahertz operating devices such as the topological\ntunable power splitter and the topological circulator. This work opens new\nperspectives in the design of terahertz integrated devices and circuits with\nhigh functionality.\n", "  In this contribution I would like to discuss briefly the recent developments\nof the nuclear configuration interaction shell model approach. As examples, we\napply the model to calculate the structure and decay properties of low-lying\nstates in neutron-deficient nuclei around $^{100}$Sn and $^{208}$Pb that are of\ngreat experimental and theoretical interests.\n", "  In order to illustrate the adaptation of traditional continuum numerical\ntechniques to the study of complex network systems, we use the equation-free\nframework to analyze a dynamically evolving multigraph. This approach is based\non coupling short intervals of direct dynamic network simulation with\nappropriately-defined lifting and restriction operators, mapping the detailed\nnetwork description to suitable macroscopic (coarse-grained) variables and\nback. This enables the acceleration of direct simulations through Coarse\nProjective Integration (CPI), as well as the identification of coarse\nstationary states via a Newton-GMRES method. We also demonstrate the use of\ndata-mining, both linear (principal component analysis, PCA) and nonlinear\n(diffusion maps, DMAPS) to determine good macroscopic variables (observables)\nthrough which one can coarse-grain the model. These results suggest methods for\ndecreasing simulation times of dynamic real-world systems such as\nepidemiological network models. Additionally, the data-mining techniques could\nbe applied to a diverse class of problems to search for a succint,\nlow-dimensional description of the system in a small number of variables.\n", "  We present the supersymmetric extension of the recently constructed\nE$_{8(8)}$ exceptional field theory -- the manifestly U-duality covariant\nformulation of the untruncated ten- and eleven-dimensional supergravities. This\ntheory is formulated on a (3+248) dimensional spacetime (modulo section\nconstraint) in which the extended coordinates transform in the adjoint\nrepresentation of E$_{8(8)}$. All bosonic fields are E$_{8(8)}$ tensors and\ntransform under internal generalized diffeomorphisms. The fermions are tensors\nunder the generalized Lorentz group SO(1,2)$\\times$SO(16), where SO(16) is the\nmaximal compact subgroup of E$_{8(8)}$. Vanishing generalized torsion\ndetermines the corresponding spin connections to the extent they are required\nto formulate the field equations and supersymmetry transformation laws. We\ndetermine the supersymmetry transformations for all bosonic and fermionic\nfields such that they consistently close into generalized diffeomorphisms. In\nparticular, the covariantly constrained gauge vectors of E$_{8(8)}$ exceptional\nfield theory combine with the standard supergravity fields into a single\nsupermultiplet. We give the complete extended Lagrangian and show its\ninvariance under supersymmetry. Upon solution of the section constraint the\ntheory reduces to full D=11 or type IIB supergravity.\n", "  We consider scenarios of Higgs compositeness where the Higgs doublet arises\nas a pseudo-Nambu Goldstone boson. Our focus is the physical scalar (\"radial\")\nexcitation associated with the global symmetry breaking vacuum, which we call\nthe \"global Higgs\". For the minimal case of a $SO(5)/SO(4)$ coset, the\ncouplings of the global Higgs to Standard Model (SM) particles are fully\ndetermined by group theoretical factors and two decay constants. The global\nHiggs also couples to the composite resonances of the theory, inducing an\ninteraction with the SM gauge bosons at one-loop. We thoroughly analyze\nrepresentative fermionic sectors, considering a global Higgs both in the $\\bf\n5$ and $\\bf 14$ representations of $SO(5)$ and taking into account the\nrenormalization group evolution of couplings in the composite sector. We derive\nthe one-loop effective couplings and all decays of the global Higgs, showing\nthat its decay width over mass can range from $ O (10^{-3})$ to $ O(1)$.\nBecause of the multiplicity of the resonances, the coupling of the global Higgs\nto gluons is sizeable, potentially opening a new window into composite models\nat the LHC.\n", "  Multiple-band electronic structure and proximity to antiferromagnetic (AF)\ninstability are the key properties of iron-based superconductors. We explore\nthe influence of scattering by the AF spin fluctuations on transport of\nmultiple-band metals above the magnetic transition. A salient feature of\nscattering on the AF fluctuations is that it is strongly enhanced at the Fermi\nsurface locations where the nesting is perfect (\"hot spots\" or \"hot lines\"). We\nreview derivation of the collision integral for the Boltzmann equation due to\nAF-fluctuations scattering. In the paramagnetic state, the enhanced scattering\nrate near the hot lines leads to anomalous behavior of electronic transport in\nmagnetic field. We explore this behavior by analytically solving Boltzmann\ntransport equation with approximate transition rates. This approach accounts\nfor return scattering events and is more accurate than the relaxation-time\napproximation. The magnetic-field dependences are characterized by two very\ndifferent field scales, the lower scale is set by the hot-spot width and the\nhigher scale is set by the total scattering amplitude. A conventional\nmagnetotransport behavior is limited to magnetic fields below the lower scale.\nIn the wide range in between these two scales the longitudinal conductivity has\nlinear dependence on the magnetic field and the Hall conductivity has quadratic\ndependence. The linear dependence of the diagonal component reflects growth of\nthe Fermi-surface area affected by hot spots proportional to the magnetic\nfield. We discuss applicability of this theoretical framework for describing of\nanomalous magnetotransport properties in different iron pnictides and selenides\nin the paramagnetic state.\n", "  In this paper we extend the form of interaction term into the non-linear\nregime in the ghost dark energy model. A general form of non-linear interaction\nterm is presented and cosmic dynamic equations are obtained. Next, the model is\ndetailed for two special choice of the non-linear interaction term. According\nto this the universe transits at suitable time ($z\\sim 0.8$) from deceleration\nto acceleration phase which alleviate the coincidence problem. Squared sound\nspeed analysis revealed that for one class of non-linear interaction term\n$v_s^2$ can gets positive. This point is an impact of the non-linear\ninteraction term and we never find such behavior in non interacting and\nlinearly interacting ghost dark energy models. Also statefinder parameters are\nintroduced for this model and we found that for one class the model meets the\n$\\Lambda CDM$ while in the second choice although the model approaches the\n$\\Lambda CDM$ but never touch that.\n", "  We examine holographic renormalization by the singular value decomposition\n(SVD) of matrix data generated by the Monte Carlo snapshot of the 2D classical\nIsing model at criticality. To take the continuous limit of the SVD enables us\nto find the mathematical form of each SVD component by the inverse Mellin\ntransformation as well as the power-law behavior of the SVD spectrum. We find\nthat each SVD component is characterized by the two-point spin correlator with\na finite correlation length. Then, the continuous limit of the decomposition\nindex in the SVD corresponds to the inverse of the correlation length. These\nfeatures strongly suggest that the SVD contains mathematical structure the same\nas the holographic renormalization.\n", "  The theory of the fundamental limits (TFL) of nonlinear optics is a powerful\ntool for experimentalists seeking to create molecules and materials with large\nresponses, and for theorists who are seeking to understand how the basic\nelements of quantum theory delineate the boundaries within which these searches\nshould be conducted. On a practical level, the TFL provides a metric for\nmeasuring the performance or 'goodness' of new molecules, relative to what is\npossible. Explorations of large sets of structures within the theory provide\ninsight into new design rules for creating more active molecules. This article\nis a review of the TFL, starting with a history of its development and its\nfirst use to discover that all molecules as of the year 2000 fell a factor of\n30 below the limits, and continuing to the present day where the theory\ncontinues to provide research opportunities and challenges. The review focuses\non off-resonant nonlinear optics in order to sharply focus on the key elements\nof the TFL, but pointers are provided to the literature for near- and\non-resonance applications.\n", "  In the past, magnetic images acquired using scanning Superconducting Quantum\nInterference Device (SQUID) microscopy have been interpreted using simple\nmodels for the sensor point spread function. However, more complicated modeling\nis needed when the characteristic dimensions of the field sensitive areas in\nthese sensors become comparable to the London penetration depth. In this paper\nwe calculate the response of SQUIDs with deep sub-micron pickup loops to\ndifferent sources of magnetic fields by solving coupled London's and Maxwell's\nequations using the full sensor geometry. Tests of these calculations using\nvarious field sources are in reasonable agreement with experiments. These\ncalculations allow us to more accurately interpret sub-micron spatial\nresolution data obtained using scanning SQUID microscopy.\n", "  We devise a method to shortcut the adiabatic evolution of a spin-1 Bose gas\nwith an external magnetic field as the control parameter. An initial many-body\nstate with almost all bosons populating the Zeeman sublevel $m=0$, is evolved\nto a final state very close to a macroscopic spin-singlet condensate, a\nfragmented state with three macroscopically occupied Zeeman states. The\nshortcut protocol, obtained by an approximate mapping to a harmonic oscillator\nHamiltonian, is compared to linear and exponential variations of the control\nparameter. We find a dramatic speedup of the dynamics when using the shortcut\nprotocol.\n", "  The exact factorization of an electron-nuclear wavefunction [A. Abedi, N. T.\nMaitra, and E. K. U. Gross, Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 123002 (2010)] allows us to\ndefine the rigorous nuclear time-dependent Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation (TDSE) with\na time-dependent potential-energy surface (TDPES) that fully accounts for the\ncoupling to the electronic motion and drives the nuclear wavepacket dynamics.\nHere, we study whether the propagation of multiple classical trajectories can\nreproduce the quantum nuclear motion in strong-field processes when their\nmotions are governed by the quantum Hamilton-Jacobi equation derived by\napplying Bohmian mechanics to this exact nuclear TDSE. We demonstrate that\nmultiple classical trajectories propagated by the force from the gradient of\nthe exact TDPES plus the Bohmian quantum potential can reproduce the\nstrong-field dissociation dynamics of a one-dimensional model of the H$_2^+$\nmolecule. Our results show that the force from the Bohmian quantum potential\nplays a non-negligible role in yielding quantum nuclear dynamics in the\nstrong-field process studied here, where ionization and/or splitting of nuclear\nprobability density occurs.\n", "  In this paper, we present the recent progress in the development of a series\nof gyrotrons at FIR UF that have opened the road to many novel applications in\nthe high-power Terahertz science and technology. The current status of the\nresearch in this actively developing field is illustrated by the most\nrepresentative examples in which the developed gyrotrons are used as powerful\nand frequency tunable sources of coherent radiation operating in a CW regime.\nAmong them are high-precision spectroscopic techniques (most notably DNP-NMR,\nESR, XDMR, and studies of the hyperfine splitting of the energy levels of\npositronium), treatment and characterization of advanced materials, new medical\ntechnologies.\n", "  The rotating regular Hayward's spacetime, apart from mass ($M$) and angular\nmomentum ($a$), has an additional deviation parameter ($g$) due to the magnetic\ncharge, which generalizes the Kerr black hole when $g\\neq0$, and for $g=0$, it\ngoes over to the Kerr black hole. We analyze how the ergoregion is affected by\nthe parameter $g$ to show that the area of ergoregion increases with increasing\nvalues of $g$. Further, for each $g$, there exist critical $a_E$, which\ncorresponds to a regular extremal black hole with degenerate horizons\n$r=r^E_H$, and $a_E$ decrease whereas $r^E_H$ increases with an increase in the\nparameter $g$. Ban{\\~a}dos, Silk and West (BSW) demonstrated that the extremal\nKerr black hole can act as a particle accelerator with arbitrarily high\ncenter-of-mass energy ($E_{CM}$) when the collision of two particles takes\nplace near the horizon. We study the BSW process for two particles with\ndifferent rest masses, $m_1$ and $m_2$, moving in the equatorial plane of\nextremal Hayward's black hole for different values of $g$, to show that\n$E_{CM}$ of two colliding particles is arbitrarily high when one of the\nparticles takes a critical value of angular momentum. For a nonextremal case,\nthere always exist a finite upper bound for the $E_{CM}$, which increases with\nthe deviation parameter $g$. Our results, in the limit $g \\rightarrow 0$,\nreduces to that of the Kerr black hole.\n", "  Optical whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonators are a powerful and versatile\ntool used in many branches of science. Fine tuning of the central frequency and\nline width of individual resonances is however desirable in a number of\napplications including frequency conversion, optical communications and\nefficient light-matter coupling. To this end we present a detailed theoretical\nanalysis of dielectric tuning of WGMs supported in axisymmetric resonators.\nUsing the Bethe-Schwinger equation and adopting an angular spectrum field\nrepresentation we study the resonance shift and mode broadening of high $Q$\nWGMs when a planar dielectric substrate is brought close to the resonator.\nParticular focus is given to use of a uniaxial substrate with an arbitrarily\naligned optic axis. Competing red and blue resonance shifts ($\\sim 30$ MHz),\nderiving from generation of a near field material polarisation and back action\nfrom the radiation continuum respectively, are found. Anomalous resonance\nshifts can hence be observed depending on the substrate material, whereas mode\nbroadening on the order of $\\sim 50$ MHz can also be simply realised.\nFurthermore, polarisation selective coupling with extinction ratios of $> 10^4$\ncan be achieved when the resonator and substrate are of the same composition\nand their optic axes are chosen correctly. Double refraction and properties of\nout-coupled beams are also discussed.\n", "  (abridged) The fairly recent detection of a variety of anions in the\nInterstellar Molecular Clouds have underlined the importance of realistically\nmodeling the processes governing their abundance. To this aim, our earlier\ncalculations for the radiative electron attachment (REA) rates for C4H-, C6H-,\nand C8H- are employed to generate the corresponding column density ratios of\nanion/neutral (A/N) relative abundances. The latter are then compared with\nthose obtained from observational measurements. The calculations involved the\ntime-dependent solutions of a large network of chemical processes over an\nextended time interval and included a series of runs in which the values of REA\nrates were repeatedly scaled. Macroscopic parameters for the clouds' modeling\nwere also varied to cover a broad range of physical environments. It was found\nthat, within the range and quality of the processes included in the present\nnetwork,and selected from state-of-the-art astrophysical databases, the REA\nvalues required to match the observed A/N ratios needed to be reduced by orders\nof magnitude for C4H- case, while the same rates for C6H- and C8H- only needed\nto be scaled by much smaller factors. The results suggest that the generally\nproposed formation of interstellar anions by REA mechanism is overestimated by\ncurrent models for the C4H- case, for which is likely to be an inefficient path\nto formation. This path is thus providing a rather marginal contribution to the\nobserved abundances of C4H-, the latter being more likely to originate from\nother chemical processes in the network, as we discuss in some detail in the\npresent work.Possible physical reasons for the much smaller differences against\nobservations found instead for the values of the (A/N) ratios in two other,\nlonger members of the series are put forward and analyzed within the\nevolutionary modeling discussed in the present work.\n", "  We introduce an orbital-optimized double-hybrid (DH) scheme using the\noptimized-effective-potential (OEP) method. The orbitals are optimized using a\nlocal potential corresponding to the complete exchange-correlation energy\nexpression including the second-order M{{\\o}}ller-Plesset (MP2) correlation\ncontribution. We have implemented a one-parameter version of this OEP-based\nself-consistent DH scheme using the BLYP density-functional approximation and\ncompared it to the corresponding non-self-consistent DH scheme for calculations\non a few closed-shell atoms and molecules. While the OEP-based self-consistency\ndoes not provide any improvement for the calculations of ground-state total\nenergies and ionization potentials, it does improve the accuracy of electron\naffinities and restores the meaning of the LUMO orbital energy as being\nconnected to a neutral excitation energy. Moreover, the OEP-based\nself-consistent DH scheme provides reasonably accurate exchange-correlation\npotentials and correlated densities.\n", "  We propose a new perspective on Turbulence using Information Theory. We\ncompute the entropy rate of a turbulent velocity signal and we particularly\nfocus on its dependence on the scale. We first report how the entropy rate is\nable to describe the distribution of information amongst scales, and how one\ncan use it to isolate the injection, inertial and dissipative ranges, in\nperfect agreement with the Batchelor model and with a fBM model. In a second\nstage, we design a conditioning procedure in order to finely probe the\nasymmetries in the statistics that are responsible for the energy cascade. Our\napproach is very generic and can be applied to any multiscale complex system.\n", "  Standard-Model Higgs bosons are dominantly produced via the gluon-fusion\nmechanism $gg \\to H$ at the LHC, i.e. in a loop-mediated process with top loops\nproviding the dominant contribution. For the measured Higgs boson mass of $\\sim\n125$ GeV the limit of heavy top quarks provides a reliable approximation as\nlong as the relative QCD corrections are scaled with the full mass-dependent LO\ncross section. In this limit the Higgs coupling to gluons can be described by\nan effective Lagrangian. The same approach can also be applied to the coupling\nof more than one Higgs boson to gluons. We will derive the effective Lagrangian\nfor multi-Higgs couplings to gluons up to N$^4$LO thus extending previous\nresults for more than one Higgs boson. Moreover we discuss gluonic Higgs\ncouplings up to NNLO, if several heavy quarks contribute.\n", "  Our ability to interpret and glean useful information from the large body of\nobservations of strongly magnetised neutron stars rests largely on our\ntheoretical understanding of magnetic field equilibria. We answer the following\nquestion: is one free to arbitrarily prescribe magnetic equilibria such that\nfluid degrees of freedom can balance the equilibrium equations? We examine this\nquestion for various models for neutron star matter; from the simplest\nsingle-fluid barotrope to more realistic non-barotropic multifluid models with\nsuperfluid/superconducting components, muons and entropy. We do this for both\naxi- and non-axisymmetric equilibria, and in Newtonian gravity and general\nrelativity. We show that, in axisymmetry, the most realistic model allows\ncomplete freedom in choosing a magnetic field equilibrium whereas\nnon-axisymmetric equilibria are never completely arbitrary.\n", "  Lepton number violation is searched for at the LHC using same-sign leptons\nplus jets. The standard lore is that the ratio of same-sign lepton to\nopposite-sign lepton events, $R_{ll}$, is equal to $R_{ll}=1$ ($R_{ll}=0$) for\nMajorana (Dirac) neutrinos. We argue that for \"quasi-Dirac\" neutrinos, $R_{ll}$\ncan have any value between 0 and 1, the precise value being controlled by the\nmass splitting versus the width of the quasi-Dirac resonances. A measurement of\n$R_{ll}\\neq 0,1$ would then contain valuable information about the origin of\nneutrino masses. We consider as an example the inverse seesaw mechanism in a\nleft-right symmetric scenario, which is phenomenologically particularly\ninteresting since all the heavy states in the high energy completion of the\nmodel could be within experimental reach. A prediction of this scenario is a\ncorrelation between the values of $R_{ll}$ and the ratio between the rates for\nheavy neutrino decays into standard model gauge bosons, and into three body\nfinal states $ljj$ mediated by off-shell $W_R$ exchange.\n", "  We present a formula for the Hilbert series that counts gauge invariant\nchiral operators in a large class of 3d ${\\cal N} \\ge 2$\nYang-Mills-Chern-Simons theories. The formula counts 't Hooft monopole\noperators dressed by gauge invariants of a residual gauge theory of massless\nfields in the monopole background. We provide a general formula for the case of\nabelian theories, where nonperturbative corrections are absent, and consider a\nfew examples of nonabelian theories where nonperturbative corrections are well\nunderstood. We also analyze in detail nonabelian ABJ(M) theories as well as\nworldvolume theories of M2-branes probing Calabi-Yau fourfold and hyperK\\\"ahler\ntwofold singularities with ${\\cal N} = 2$ and ${\\cal N} = 3$ supersymmetry.\n", "  This paper addresses the linear and nonlinear three-dimensional propagation\nof an electron wave in a collisionless plasma that may be inhomogeneous,\nnonstationary, anisotropic and even weakly magnetized. The wave amplitude,\ntogether with any hydrodynamic quantity characterizing the plasma (density,\ntemperature,...) are supposed to vary very little within one wavelength or one\nwave period. Hence, the geometrical optics limit is assumed, and the wave\npropagation is described by a first order differential equation. This equation\nexplicitly accounts for three-dimensional effects, plasma inhomogeneity, Landau\ndamping, and the collisionless dissipation and electron acceleration due to\ntrapping. It is derived by mixing results obtained from a direct resolution of\nthe Vlasov-Poisson system and from a variational formalism involving a nonlocal\nLagrangian density. In a one-dimensional situation, abrupt transitions are\npredicted in the coefficients of the wave equation. They occur when the state\nof the electron plasma wave changes, from a linear wave to a wave with trapped\nelectrons. In a three dimensional geometry, the transitions are smoother,\nespecially as regards the nonlinear Landau damping rate, for which a very\nsimple effective and accurate analytic expression is provided.\n", "  In this work, a systematic protocol is proposed to automatically parametrize\nimplicit solvent models with polar and nonpolar components. The proposed\nprotocol utilizes the classical Poisson model or the Kohn-Sham density\nfunctional theory (KSDFT) based polarizable Poisson model for modeling polar\nsolvation free energies. For the nonpolar component, either the standard model\nof surface area, molecular volume, and van der Waals interactions, or a model\nwith atomic surface areas and molecular volume is employed. Based on the\nassumption that similar molecules have similar parametrizations, we develop\nscoring and ranking algorithms to classify solute molecules. Four sets of\nradius parameters are combined with four sets of charge force fields to arrive\nat a total of 16 different parametrizations for the Poisson model. A large\ndatabase with 668 experimental data is utilized to validate the proposed\nprotocol. The lowest leave-one-out root mean square (RMS) error for the\ndatabase is 1.33k cal/mol. Additionally, five subsets of the database, i.e.,\nSAMPL0-SAMPL4, are employed to further demonstrate that the proposed protocol\noffers some of the best solvation predictions. The optimal RMS errors are 0.93,\n2.82, 1.90, 0.78, and 1.03 kcal/mol, respectively for SAMPL0, SAMPL1, SAMPL2,\nSAMPL3, and SAMPL4 test sets. These results are some of the best, to our best\nknowledge.\n", "  In this paper we systematically evaluate the variation in the reversal delay\nof a nanomagnet driven by a longitudinal spin current while under the influence\nof thermal noise. We then use the results to evaluate the performance of an\nAll-Spin-Logic (ASL) circuit. First, we review and expand on the physics of\npreviously-published analytical models on stochastic nanomagnet switching. The\nlimits of previously established models are defined and it is shown that these\nmodels are valid for nanomagnet reversal times < 200 ps. Second, the insight\nobtained from previous models allows us to represent the probability density\nfunction (PDF) of the nanomagnet switching delay using the double exponential\nfunction of the Frechet distribution. The PDF of a single nanomagnet is\nextended to more complex nanomagnet circuit configurations. It is shown that\nthe delay-variation penalty incurred by nanomagnets arranged in parallel\nconfiguration is dwarfed by the average delay increase for nanomagnets arranged\nin a series configuration. Finally, we demonstrate the impact of device-level\nperformance variation on the circuit behavior using ASL logic gates. While the\nanalysis presented in this paper uses an ASL-AND gate as the prototype\nswitching circuit in the spin domain, the physical concepts are generic and can\nbe extended to any complex spin-based circuit.\n", "  Device figures of merit are commonly employed to assess bulk material\nproperties for a particular device class, yet these properties ultimately\noriginate in the linear and nonlinear susceptibilities of the material which\nare not independent of each other. In this work, we calculate the electro-optic\ndevice figure of merit based on the half-wave voltage and linear loss, which is\nimportant for phase modulators and serves as the simplest example of the\napproach. This figure of merit is then related back to the microscopic\nproperties in the context of a dye-doped polymer, and its fundamental limits\nare obtained to provide a target. Surprisingly, the largest figure of merit is\nnot always associated with a large nonlinear-optical response, the quantity\nthat is most often the focus of optimization. An important lesson to materials\ndesign is that the figure of merit alone should be optimized. The best device\nmaterials can have low nonlinearity provided that the loss is low; or, near\nresonance high loss may be desirable because it is accompanied by\nresonantly-enhanced, ultra-large nonlinear response so device lengths are\nshort. Our work shows which frequency range of operation is most promising for\noptimizing the material figure of merit for electro-optic devices.\n", "  In the present paper, DFT (Density Functional Theory) based first-principles\nmethods are applied to investigate the mechanical and bonding properties of\nnewly synthesized T2 phase superconductor Ta5GeB2 for the first time. The\ncalculated lattice constants are in reasonable agreement with the experiment.\nThe elastic constants (Cij), bulk modulus (B), shear modulus (G), Young's\nmodulus (Y), Poisson ratio (nu), Pugh ratio (G/B), and elastic anisotropy\nfactor, A, of Ta5GeB2 are calculated to explore the mechanical behavior of the\ncompound.To give an explanation of the bonding nature of this new ternary\ntetragonal system, the band structure, density of states, and Mulliken atomic\npopulation are investigated. The estimated Debye temperature and Vickers\nhardness are also used to justify both the mechanical and bonding properties of\nTa5GeB2.\n", "  (abridged) We report rest-frame submillimeter H2O emission line observations\nof 11 HyLIRGs/ULIRGs at z~2-4 selected among the brightest lensed galaxies\ndiscovered in the Herschel-ATLAS. Using the IRAM NOEMA, we have detected 14 new\nH2O emission lines. The apparent luminosities of the H2O emission lines are\n$\\mu L_{\\rm{H_2O}} \\sim 6-21 \\times 10^8 L_\\odot$, with velocity-integrated\nline fluxes ranging from 4-15 Jy km s$^{-1}$. We have also observed CO emission\nlines using EMIR on the IRAM 30m telescope in seven sources. The velocity\nwidths for CO and H2O lines are found to be similar. With almost comparable\nintegrated flux densities to those of the high-J CO line, H2O is found to be\namong the strongest molecular emitters in high-z Hy/ULIRGs. We also confirm our\npreviously found correlation between luminosity of H2O ($L_{\\rm{H_2O}}$) and\ninfrared ($L_{\\rm{IR}}$) that $L_{\\rm{H_2O}} \\sim L_{\\rm{IR}}^{1.1-1.2}$, with\nour new detections. This correlation could be explained by a dominant role of\nfar-infrared (FIR) pumping in the H2O excitation. Modelling reveals the FIR\nradiation fields have warm dust temperature $T_\\rm{warm}$~45-75 K, H2O column\ndensity per unit velocity interval $N_{\\rm{H_2O}}/\\Delta V \\gtrsim 0.3 \\times\n10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ km$^{-1}$ s and 100 $\\mu$m continuum opacity $\\tau_{100} >\n1$ (optically thick), indicating that H2O is likely to trace highly obscured\nwarm dense gas. However, further observations of $J\\geq4$ H2O lines are needed\nto better constrain the continuum optical depth and other physical conditions\nof the molecular gas and dust. We have also detected H2O+ emission in three\nsources. A tight correlation between $L_{\\rm{H_2O}}$ and $L_{\\rm{H_2O^+}}$ has\nbeen found in galaxies from low to high redshift. The velocity-integrated flux\ndensity ratio between H2O+ and H2O suggests that cosmic rays generated by\nstrong star formation are possibly driving the H2O+ formation.\n", "  Structured metallic tips are increasingly important for optical\nspectroscopies such as tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS), with plasmonic\nresonances frequently cited as a mechanism for electric field enhancement. We\nprobe the local optical response of sharp and spherical-tipped atomic force\nmicroscopy (AFM) tips using a scanning hyperspectral imaging technique to\nidentify plasmonic behaviour. Localised surface plasmon resonances which\nradiatively couple with far-field light are found only for spherical AFM tips,\nwith little response for sharp AFM tips, in agreement with numerical\nsimulations of the near-field response. The precise tip geometry is thus\ncrucial for plasmon-enhanced spectroscopies, and the typical sharp cones are\nnot preferred.\n", "  Detection jitter quantifies variance introduced by the detector in the\ndetermination of photon arrival time. It is a crucial performance parameter for\nsystems using superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs). In\nthis work, we have demonstrated that the detection timing jitter is limited in\npart by the spatial variation of photon detection events along the length of\nthe wire. This distribution causes the generated electrical pulses to arrive at\nthe readout at varied times. We define this jitter source as geometric jitter\nsince it is related to the length and area of the SNSPD. To characterize the\ngeometric jitter, we have constructed a novel differential cryogenic readout\nwith less than 7 ps of electronic jitter that can amplify the pulses generated\nfrom the two ends of an SNSPD. By differencing the measured arrival times of\nthe two electrical pulses, we were able to partially cancel out the difference\nof the propagation times and thus reduce the uncertainty of the photon arrival\ntime. Our experimental data indicates that the variation of the differential\npropagation time was a few ps for a 3 {\\mu}m x 3 {\\mu}m device while it\nincreased up to 50 ps for a 20 {\\mu}m x 20 {\\mu}m device. In a 20 {\\mu}m x 20\n{\\mu}m large SNSPD, we achieved a 20% reduction in the overall detection timing\njitter for detecting telecom-wavelength photons by using the differential\ncryogenic readout. The geometric jitter hypothesis was further confirmed by\nstudying jitter in devices that consisted of long wires with 1-{\\mu}m-long\nnarrowed regions used for sensing photons.\n", "  We investigate the classical stability of supersymmetric, asymptotically\nflat, microstate geometries with five non-compact dimensions. Such geometries\nadmit an \"evanescent ergosurface\": a timelike hypersurface of infinite\nredshift. On such a surface, there are null geodesics with zero energy relative\nto infinity. These geodesics are stably trapped in the potential well near the\nergosurface. We present a heuristic argument indicating that this feature is\nlikely to lead to a nonlinear instability of these solutions. We argue that the\nprecursor of such an instability can be seen in the behaviour of linear\nperturbations: nonlinear stability would require that all linear perturbations\ndecay sufficiently rapidly but the stable trapping implies that some linear\nperturbation decay very slowly. We study this in detail for the most symmetric\nmicrostate geometries. By constructing quasinormal modes of these geometries we\nshow that generic linear perturbations decay slower than any inverse power of\ntime.\n", "  Organic semiconductors tend to self-assemble into highly ordered and oriented\nmorphologies with anisotropic optical properties. Studying these optical\nanisotropies provides insight into processing-dependent structural properties\nand informs the photonic design of organic photovoltaic and light-emitting\ndevices. Here, we measure the anisotropic optical properties of spin-cast films\nof the n-type polymer P(NDI2OD-T2) using momentum-resolved absorption and\nemission spectroscopies. We quantify differences in the optical anisotropies of\nfilms deposited with distinct face-on and edge-on morphologies. In particular,\nwe infer a substantially larger out-of-plane tilt angle of the optical\ntransition dipole moment in high temperature annealed, edge-on films.\nMeasurements of spectral differences between in-plane and out-of-plane dipoles,\nfurther indicate regions of disordered polymers in low temperature annealed\nface-on films that are otherwise obscured in traditional X-ray and optical\ncharacterization techniques. The methods and analysis developed in this work\nprovide a way to identify and quantify subtle optical and structural\nanisotropies in organic semiconductors that are important for understanding and\ndesigning highly efficient thin film devices.\n", "  We demonstrate the operation of an all-optical buffer based on temporal\ncavity solitons stored in a nonlinear passive fiber ring resonator. Unwanted\nacoustic interactions between neighboring solitons are suppressed by modulating\nthe phase of the external laser driving the cavity. A new locking scheme is\npresented that allows the buffer to operate with an arbitrarily large number of\ncavity solitons in the loop. Experimentally, we are able to demonstrate the\nstorage of 4536 bits of data, written all-optically into the fiber ring at 10\nGb/s, for 1 minute.\n", "  The discontinuous Galerkin finite element method (DG-FEM) is successfully\napplied to treat a broad variety of transport problems numerically. In this\nwork, we use the full capacity of the DG-FEM to solve the radiative transfer\nequation in spherical symmetry. We present a discontinuous Galerkin method to\ndirectly solve the spherically-symmetric radiative transfer equation as a\ntwo-dimensional problem. The transport equation in spherical atmospheres is\nmore complicated than in the plane-parallel case due to the appearance of an\nadditional derivative with respect to the polar angle. The DG-FEM formalism\nallows for the exact integration of arbitrarily complex scattering phase\nfunctions, independent of the angular mesh resolution. We show that the\ndiscontinuous Galerkin method is able to describe accurately the radiative\ntransfer in extended atmospheres and to capture discontinuities or complex\nscattering behaviour which might be present in the solution of certain\nradiative transfer tasks and can, therefore, cause severe numerical problems\nfor other radiative transfer solution methods.\n", "  We discuss the use of massive vectors for the interpretation of some recent\nexperimental anomalies, with special attention to the muon $g-2$. We restrict\nour discussion to the case where the massive vector is embedded into a\nspontaneously broken gauge symmetry, so that the predictions are not affected\nby the choice of an arbitrary energy cut-off. Extended gauge symmetries,\nhowever, typically impose strong constraints on the mass of the new vector\nboson and for the muon $g-2$ they basically rule out, barring the case of\nabelian gauge extensions, the explanation of the discrepancy in terms of a\nsingle vector extension of the standard model. We finally comment on the use of\nmassive vectors for $B$-meson decay and di-photon anomalies.\n", "  High energy resolution, hard X-ray spectroscopies are powerful element\nselective probes of the electronic and local structure of matter, with diverse\napplications in chemistry, physics, biology and materials science. The routine\napplication of these techniques is hindered by the complicated and slow access\nto synchrotron radiation facilities. Here we propose a new, economic, easily\noperated laboratory high resolution von H\\'amos type X-ray spectrometer, which\noffers rapid transmission experiments for X-ray absorption, and is also capable\nof recording X-ray emission spectra. The use of a cylindrical analyzer crystal\nand a position sensitive detector enabled us to build a maintenance free,\nflexible setup with low operational costs, while delivering synchrotron grade\nsignal to noise measurements in reasonable acquisition times. We demonstrate\nthe proof of principle and give examples for both measurement types. Finally,\ntracking of a several day long chemical transformation, a case better suited\nfor laboratory than synchrotron investigation, is also presented.\n", "  Controllable doping of two-dimensional materials is highly desired for ideal\ndevice performance in both hetero- and p-n homo-junctions. Herein, we propose\nan effective strategy for doping of MoS2 with nitrogen through a remote N2\nplasma surface treatment. By monitoring the surface chemistry of MoS2 upon N2\nplasma exposure using in-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, we identified\nthe presence of covalently bonded nitrogen in MoS2, where substitution of the\nchalcogen sulfur by nitrogen is determined as the doping mechanism.\nFurthermore, the electrical characterization demonstrates that p-type doping of\nMoS2 is achieved by nitrogen doping, in agreement with theoretical predictions.\nNotably, we found that the presence of nitrogen can induce compressive strain\nin the MoS2 structure, which represents the first evidence of strain induced by\nsubstitutional doping in a transition metal dichalcogenide material. Finally,\nour first principle calculations support the experimental demonstration of such\nstrain, and a correlation between nitrogen doping concentration and compressive\nstrain in MoS2 is elucidated.\n", "  The current most stringent constraints on exotic scalar or tensor couplings\nin neutron and nuclear $\\beta$ decay, involving left-handed neutrinos, are\nobtained from the Fierz interference term. The sensitivity to this term in a\ncorrelation coefficient is usually driven by an energy-averaged kinematic\nfactor that increases monotonically toward smaller values of the $\\beta$\nendpoint energies. We first point out here that this property does not hold for\ncertain differential observables that are directly sensitive to the Fierz term,\nsuch as the $\\beta$ or the recoil energy spectrum. This observation is relevant\nfor the selection of sensitive transitions in searches for exotic couplings\nthrough spectrum shape measurements. We then point out previous errors in the\nexploitation of measurements of the $\\beta-\\nu$ angular correlation coefficient\nand discuss their impact on the extraction of constraints on exotic couplings.\n", "  We describe and analyze some novel approaches for studying the dynamics of\nIsing spin glass models. We first briefly consider the variational approach\nbased on minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between independent\ntrajectories and the real ones and note that this approach only coincides with\nthe mean field equations from the saddle point approximation to the generating\nfunctional when the dynamics is defined through a logistic link function, which\nis the case for the kinetic Ising model with parallel update. We then spend the\nrest of the paper developing two ways of going beyond the saddle point\napproximation to the generating functional. In the first one, we develop a\nvariational perturbative approximation to the generating functional by\nexpanding the action around a quadratic function of the local fields and\nconjugate local fields whose parameters are optimized. We derive analytical\nexpressions for the optimal parameters and show that when the optimization is\nsuitably restricted, we recover the mean field equations that are exact for the\nfully asymmetric random couplings (M\\'ezard and Sakellariou, 2011). However,\nwithout this restriction the results are different. We also describe an\nextended Plefka expansion in which in addition to the magnetization, we also\nfix the correlation and response functions. Finally, we numerically study the\nperformance of these approximations for Sherrington-Kirkpatrick type couplings\nfor various coupling strengths, degrees of coupling symmetry and external\nfields. We show that the dynamical equations derived from the extended Plefka\nexpansion outperform the others in all regimes, although it is computationally\nmore demanding. The unconstrained variational approach does not perform well in\nthe small coupling regime, while it approaches dynamical TAP equations of\n(Roudi and Hertz, 2011) for strong couplings.\n", "  Biofilms are ubiquitous macro-colonies of bacteria that develop at various\ninterfaces (solid-liquid, solid-gas or liquid-gas). The formation of biofilms\nstarts with the attachment of individual bacteria to an interface, where they\nproliferate and produce a slimy polymeric matrix - two processes that result in\ncolony growth and spreading. Recent experiments on the growth of biofilms on\nagar substrates under air have shown that for certain bacterial strains, the\nproduction of the extracellular matrix and the resulting osmotic influx of\nnutrient-rich water from the agar into the biofilm are more crucial for the\nspreading behaviour of a biofilm than the motility of individual bacteria. We\npresent a model which describes the biofilm evolution and the advancing biofilm\nedge for this spreading mechanism. The model is based on a gradient dynamics\nformulation for thin films of biologically passive liquid mixtures and\nsuspensions, supplemented by bioactive processes which play a decisive role in\nthe osmotic spreading of biofilms. It explicitly includes the wetting\nproperties of the biofilm on the agar substrate via a disjoining pressure and\ncan therefore give insight into the interplay between passive surface forces\nand bioactive growth processes.\n", "  This paper presents a detailed analysis of the pseudocontact shift (PCS)\nfield induced by a mobile spin label that is viewed as a probability density\ndistribution with an associated effective magnetic susceptibility anisotropy.\nIt is demonstrated that non-spherically-symmetric density can lead to\nsignificant deviations from the commonly used point dipole approximation for\nPCS. Analytical and numerical solutions are presented for the general partial\ndifferential equation that describes the non-point case. It is also\ndemonstrated that it is possible, with some reasonable approximations, to\nreconstruct paramagnetic centre probability distributions from the experimental\nPCS data.\n", "  We discuss the neutrino flavor structures in the Occam's razor approach for\nthe Dirac neutrino mass matrices. We assume that the charged lepton mass matrix\ntakes a diagonal base, while the right-handed Majorana neutrino mass matrix is\nalso diagonal and we consider nine patterns of the four zero textures for the\nDirac neutrinos mass matrices. We numerically analyze the left-handed Majorana\nneutrino mass matrices for nine patterns of the Dirac neutrino mass matrices\nand we found two interesting patterns where both normal and inverted neutrino\nmass hierarchies can be realized. We also found if the neutrino mass is normal\nhierarchy, this scenario will be likely to be excluded by the measurements of\nthe Dirac CP violating phase in the T2K and NO$\\nu $A neutrino experiments, for\ninstance. On the other hand, if the neutrino mass is inverted hierarchy, this\nscenario will be also likely to be excluded by the measurements of neutrinoless\ndouble beta decay experiments, e.g., KamLAND-Zen experiment.\n", "  Representing the electrodynamics of relativistically drifting particle\nensembles in discrete, co-propagating Galilean coordinates enables the\nderivation of a Particle-in-Cell algorithm that is intrinsically free of the\nNumerical Cherenkov Instability, for plasmas flowing at a uniform velocity.\nApplication of the method is shown by modeling plasma accelerators in a\nLorentz-transformed optimal frame of reference.\n", "  The main aim of the study is to perform the long-term stability test of gain\nof the single mask triple GEM detector. A simple method is used for this long-\nterm stability test using a radioactive X-ray source with high activity. The\ntest is continued till accumulation of charge per unit area > 12.0 mC/mm2. The\ndetails of the chamber fabrication, the test set-up, the method of measurement\nand the test results are presented in this paper.\n", "  We report our experimental results on phase-sensitive amplification (PSA) in\nnon-degenerate signal-idler configuration using ultra-narrow coherent\npopulation oscillations in metastable helium at room temperature. We achieved a\nhigh PSA gain of nearly 7 with a bandwidth of 200 kHz, by using the system at\nresonance in a single-pass scheme. Further, the measured minimum gain is close\nto the ideal value, showing that we have a pure PSA. This is also confirmed\nfrom our phase-to-phase transfer curves measurements, illustrating that we have\na nearly perfect squeezer, which is interesting for a variety of applications.\n", "  FastDIRC is a novel fast Monte Carlo and reconstruction algorithm for DIRC\ndetectors. A DIRC employs rectangular fused-silica bars both as Cherenkov\nradiators and as light guides. Cherenkov-photon imaging and time-of-propagation\ninformation are utilized by a DIRC to identify charged particles. GEANT-based\nDIRC Monte Carlo simulations are extremely CPU intensive. The FastDIRC\nalgorithm permits fully simulating a DIRC detector more than 10000 times faster\nthan using GEANT. This facilitates designing a DIRC-reconstruction algorithm\nthat improves the Cherenkov-angle resolution of a DIRC detector by about 30%\ncompared to existing algorithms. FastDIRC also greatly reduces the time\nrequired to study competing DIRC-detector designs.\n", "  We experimentally isolate and directly observe multimode solitons in few-mode\ngraded-index fiber. By varying the input energy and modal composition of the\nlaunched pulse, we observe a continuous variation of multimode solitons with\ndifferent spatiotemporal properties. They exhibit an energy-volume relation\nthat is distinct from those of single-mode and fully spatiotemporal solitons.\n", "  The ATLAS Forward Proton (AFP) detector is intended to measure protons\nscattered at small angles from the ATLAS interaction point. To this end, a\ncombination of 3D Silicon pixel tracking modules and Quartz-Cherenkov\ntime-of-flight (ToF) detectors is installed 210m away from the interaction\npoint at both sides of ATLAS. Beam tests with an AFP prototype detector\ncombining tracking and timing sub-detectors and a common readout have been\nperformed at the CERN-SPS test-beam facility in November 2014 and September\n2015 to complete the system integration and to study the detector performance.\nThe successful tracking-timing integration was demonstrated. Good tracker hit\nefficiencies above 99.9% at a sensor tilt of 14{\\deg}, as foreseen for AFP,\nwere observed. Spatial resolutions in the short pixel direction with 50 {\\mu}m\npitch of 5.5 +/- 0.5 {\\mu}m per pixel plane and of 2.8 +/- 0.5 {\\mu}m for the\nfull four-plane tracker at 14{\\deg} were found, largely surpassing the AFP\nrequirement of 10 {\\mu}m. The timing detector showed also good hit efficiencies\nabove 99%, and a full-system time resolution of 35 +/- 6 ps was found for the\nToF prototype detector with two Quartz bars in-line (half the final AFP size)\nwithout dedicated optimisation, fulfilling the requirements for initial\nlow-luminosity AFP runs.\n", "  New experimental data on the pd -> 3He pi+ pi- reaction obtained with the\nCOSY-MOMO detector below the three-pion threshold are presented. The reaction\nwas also studied in inverse kinematics with a deuteron beam and the higher\ncounting rates achieved were especially important at low excess energies. The\ncomparison of these data with inclusive pd -> 3He+X rates allowed estimates\nalso to be made of pi0 pi0 production. The results confirm our earlier findings\nthat close to threshold there is no enhancement at low excitation energies in\nthe pi+ pi- system, where the data seem largely suppressed compared to phase\nspace. Possible explanations for this behavior, such as strong p- waves in the\npi+pi- -system or the influence of two-step processes, are explored.\n", "  The process of $^{67}$Cu nuclide photoproduction in the zinc dioxide\nnanoparticles immersed in the water media was simulated. We calculated the\nescape fractions of $^{67}$Cu nuclei and corresponding ranges in water for\nnanoparticle sizes from 40 nm to 80 nm and incident photons energies from 12\nMeV to 30 MeV. Usage of capturing nanoparticles for accumulation of the escaped\n$^{67}$Cu nuclei is also discussed.\n", "  [Abridged] Context. Stellar activity is an important source of systematic\nerrors and uncertainties in the characterization of exoplanets. Most of the\ntechniques used to correct for this activity focus on an ad hoc data reduction.\nAims. We have developed a software for the combined fit of transits and stellar\nactivity features in high-precision long-duration photometry. Our aim is to\ntake advantage of the modelling to derive correct stellar and planetary\nparameters, even in the case of strong stellar activity. Methods. We use an\nanalytic approach to model the light curve. The code KSint, modified by adding\nthe evolution of active regions, is implemented into our Bayesian modelling\npackage PASTIS. The code is then applied to the light curve of CoRoT-2. The\nlight curve is divided in segments to reduce the number of free parameters\nneeded by the fit. We perform a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis in two ways.\nIn the first, we perform a global and independent modelling of each segment of\nthe light curve, transits are not normalized and are fitted together with the\nactivity features, and occulted features are taken into account during the\ntransit fit. In the second, we normalize the transits with a model of the\nnon-occulted activity features, and then we apply a standard transit fit, which\ndoes not take the occulted features into account. Results. Our model recovers\nthe activity features coverage of the stellar surface and different rotation\nperiods for different features. We find variations in the transit parameters of\ndifferent segments and show that they are likely due to the division applied to\nthe light curve. Neglecting stellar activity or even only bright spots while\nnormalizing the transits yields a $\\sim 1.2\\sigma$ larger and $2.3\\sigma$\nsmaller transit depth, respectively. The stellar density also presents up to\n$2.5\\sigma$ differences depending on the normalization technique...\n", "  The geometry-dependent ionization behavior of the ammonia molecule is\ninvestigated. Different theoretical approaches for obtaining the ionization\nyield are compared, all of them showing a strong dependence of the ionization\nyield on the inversion coordinate at long wavelengths ($\\geq$ 800 nm). It is\nshown how this effect can be exploited to create and probe nuclear wave packets\nin neutral ammonia using Lochfra{\\ss}. Furthermore, imaging of a wave packet\ntunneling through the barrier of a double-well potential in real time is\ndiscussed.\n", "  We trap absorbing micro-particles in air by photophoretic forces generated\nusing a single loosely focused Gaussian trapping beam. We measure a component\nof the radial Brownian motion of a trapped particle cluster and determine the\npower spectral density, mean squared displacement, and normalized position and\nvelocity autocorrelation functions in order to characterize the photophoretic\nbody force in a quantitative fashion for the first time. The trapped particles\nalso undergo spontaneous rotation due to the action of this force. This is\nevident from the spectral density that displays clear peaks at the rotation and\nthe particles' inertial resonance frequencies. We fit the spectral density to\nthe well-known analytical function derived from the Langevin equation, measure\nthe resonance and rotation frequencies and determine values for particle mass\nthat we verify at different trapping laser powers with reasonable accuracy.\n", "  (abridged). We outline LBCS (the LOFAR Long-Baseline Calibrator Survey),\nwhose aim is to identify sources suitable for calibrating the\nhighest-resolution observations made with the International LOFAR Telescope,\nwhich include baselines >1000 km. Suitable sources must contain significant\ncorrelated flux density (50-100mJy) at frequencies around 110--190~MHz on\nscales of a few hundred mas. At least for the 200--300-km international\nbaselines, we find around 1 suitable calibrator source per square degree over a\nlarge part of the northern sky, in agreement with previous work. This should\nallow a randomly selected target to be successfully phase calibrated on the\ninternational baselines in over 50% of cases. Products of the survey include\ncalibrator source lists and fringe-rate and delay maps of wide areas --\ntypically a few degrees -- around each source. The density of sources with\nsignificant correlated flux declines noticeably with baseline length over the\nrange 200--600~km, with good calibrators on the longest baselines appearing\nonly at the rate of 0.5 per square degree. Coherence times decrease from 1--3\nminutes on 200-km baselines to about 1 minute on 600-km baselines, suggesting\nthat ionospheric phase variations contain components with scales of a few\nhundred kilometres. The longest median coherence time, at just over 3 minutes,\nis seen on the DE609 baseline, which at 227km is close to being the shortest.\nWe see median coherence times of between 80 and 110 seconds on the four longest\nbaselines (580--600~km), and about 2 minutes for the other baselines. The\nsuccess of phase transfer from calibrator to target is shown to be influenced\nby distance, in a manner that suggests a coherence patch at 150-MHz of the\norder of 1 degree.\n", "  SPIFFI is an AO-fed integral field spectrograph operating as part of SINFONI\non the VLT, which will be upgraded and reused as SPIFFIER in the new VLT\ninstrument ERIS. In January 2016, we used new technology developments to\nperform an early upgrade to optical subsystems in the SPIFFI instrument so\nongoing scientific programs can make use of enhanced performance before ERIS\narrives in 2020. We report on the upgraded components and the performance of\nSPIFFI after the upgrade, including gains in throughput and spatial and\nspectral resolution. We show results from re-commissioning, highlighting the\npotential for scientific programs to use the capabilities of the upgraded\nSPIFFI. Finally, we discuss the additional upgrades for SPIFFIER which will be\nimplemented before it is integrated into ERIS.\n", "  We investigated the temperature dependence of the switching current for a\nperpendicularly magnetized CoFeB film deposited on a nanocrystalline tungsten\nfilm with large oxygen content: nc-W(O). The spin Hall angle\n$|\\Theta_\\mathrm{SH}| \\approx 0.22$ is independent of temperature, whereas the\nswitching current increases strongly at low temperature. We show that the\nnc-W(O) is insensitive to annealing. It thus can be a good choice for the\nintegration of spin Hall driven writing of information in magnetic memory or\nlogic devices that require a high-temperature annealing process during\nfabrication.\n", "  Nonlinear optical phenomena in nanostructured materials have been challenging\nour perceptions of nonlinear optical processes that have been explored since\nthe invention of lasers. For example, the ability to control optical field\nconfinement, enhancement, and scattering almost independently, allows nonlinear\nfrequency conversion efficiencies to be enhanced by many orders of magnitude\ncompared to bulk materials. Also, the subwavelength length scale renders phase\nmatching issues irrelevant. Compared with plasmonic nanostructures, dielectric\nresonator metamaterials show great promise for enhanced nonlinear optical\nprocesses due to their larger mode volumes. Here, we present, for the first\ntime, resonantly enhanced second-harmonic generation (SHG) using Gallium\nArsenide (GaAs) based dielectric metasurfaces. Using arrays of cylindrical\nresonators we observe SHG enhancement factors as large as 104 relative to\nunpatterned GaAs. At the magnetic dipole resonance we measure an absolute\nnonlinear conversion efficiency of ~2X10^(-5) with ~3.4 GW/cm2 pump intensity.\nThe polarization properties of the SHG reveal that both bulk and surface\nnonlinearities play important roles in the observed nonlinear process.\n", "  The Ott-Antonsen (OA) ansatz [Chaos 18, 037113 (2008), Chaos 19, 023117\n(2009)] has been widely used to describe large systems of coupled phase\noscillators. If the coupling is sinusoidal and if the phase dynamics does not\ndepend on the specific oscillator, then the macroscopic behavior of the systems\ncan be fully described by a low-dimensional dynamics. Does the corresponding\nmanifold remain attractive when introducing an intrinsic dependence between an\noscillator's phase and its dynamics by additional, oscillator specific\nparameters? To answer this we extended the OA ansatz and proved that\nparameter-dependent oscillatory systems converge to the OA manifold given\ncertain conditions. Our proof confirms recent numerical findings that already\nhinted at this convergence. Furthermore we offer a thorough mathematical\nunderpinning for networks of so-called theta neurons, where the OA ansatz has\njust been applied. In a final step we extend our proof by allowing for\ntime-dependent and multi-dimensional parameters as well as for network\ntopologies other than global coupling. This renders the OA ansatz an excellent\nstarting point for the analysis of a broad class of realistic settings.\n", "  This is an overview of the adaptive optics used in Advanced LIGO (aLIGO),\nknown as the thermal compensation system (TCS). The thermal compensation system\nwas designed to minimize thermally-induced spatial distortions in the\ninterferometer optical modes and to provide some correction for static\ncurvature errors in the core optics of aLIGO. The TCS is comprised of ring\nheater actuators, spatially tunable CO$_{2}$ laser projectors and Hartmann\nwavefront sensors. The system meets the requirements of correcting for nominal\ndistortion in Advanced LIGO to a maximum residual error of 5.4nm, weighted\nacross the laser beam, for up to 125W of laser input power into the\ninterferometer.\n", "  We obtain the exact solution of the one-loop mode-coupling equations for the\ndynamical structure function in the framework of non-linear fluctuating\nhydrodynamics in one space dimension for the strictly hyperbolic case where all\ncharacteristic velocities are different. All solutions are characterized by\ndynamical exponents which are Kepler ratios of consecutive Fibonacci numbers,\nwhich includes the golden mean as a limiting case. The scaling form of all\nhigher Fibonacci modes are asymmetric L\\'evy-distributions. Thus a hierarchy of\nnew dynamical universality classes is established. We also compute the precise\nnumerical value of the Pr\\\"ahofer-Spohn scaling constant to which scaling\nfunctions obtained from mode coupling theory are sensitive.\n", "  We report on the experimental observation of coherent cavity soliton\nfrequency combs in silica microspheres. Specifically, we demonstrate that\ncareful alignment of the microsphere relative to the coupling fiber taper\nallows for the suppression of higher-order spatial modes, reducing mode\ninteractions and enabling soliton formation. Our measurements show that the\ntemporal cavity solitons have sub-100-fs durations, exhibit considerable Raman\nself-frequency shift, and generally come in groups of three or four,\noccasionally with equidistant spacing in the time domain. RF amplitude noise\nmeasurements and spectral interferometry confirm the high coherence of the\nobserved soliton frequency combs, and numerical simulations show good agreement\nwith experiments.\n", "  With the high-order harmonic generation (HHG) from plasma sur- faces it is\npossible to turn a laser pulse into a train of attosecond or even zeptosecond\npulses in the backward radiation. These attosecond pulses may have amplitude\nseveral orders of magnitude higher than that of the laser pulse under\nappropriate conditions. We study this process in detail, especially the\nnanobunching of the plasma electron density. We derive an analytical expression\nthat describes the electron density pro- file and obtain a good agreement with\nparticle-in-cell simulation results. We investigate the most efficient case of\nHHG at moderate laser intensity (I = 2*10^20 W/cm^2 ) on the over-dense plasma\nslab with an exponential profile pre-plasma. Subsequently we calculate the\nspectra of a single at- tosecond pulse from the backward radiation using our\nexpression for the density shape in combination with the equation for the\nspectrum of the nanobunch radiation.\n", "  Context. We have recently investigated the origin of chemical signatures\nobserved in Galactic halo stars by means of a stochastic chemical evolution\nmodel. We have found that rotating massive stars are a promising way to explain\nseveral signatures observed in these fossil stars. Aims. In the present paper\nwe discuss how the extremely metal-poor halo star TYC 8442-1036-1, for which we\nhave now obtained detailed abundances from VLT-UVES spectra, fits into the\nframework of our previous work. Methods. We apply a standard 1D LTE analysis to\nthe spectrum of this star. We measure the abundances of 14 chemical elements;\nfor Na, Mg, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni and Zn we compute the abundances\nusing equivalent widths; for C, Sr and Ba we obtain the abundances by means of\nsynthetic spectra generated by MOOG. Results. We find an abundance of [Fe/H]=\n$-$3.5 $\\pm$0.13 dex based on our high resolution spectrum; this points to an\niron content lower by a factor of three (0.5 dex) compared to the one obtained\nby a low resolution spectrum. The star has a [C/Fe] = 0.4 dex, and it is not\ncarbon enhanced like most of the stars at this metallicity. Moreover, this star\nlies in the plane [Ba/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] in a relatively unusual position, shared\nby a few others galactic halo stars that is only marginally explained by our\npast results. Conclusions. The comparison of the model results with the\nchemical abundance characteristics of this group of stars can be improved if we\nconsider in our model the presence of faint supernovae coupled with rotating\nmassive stars. These results seem to imply that rotating massive stars and\nfaint supernovae scenarios are complementary to each other, and are both\nrequired in order to match the observed chemistry of the earliest phases of the\nchemical enrichment of the Universe.\n", "  We study the integrable $\\eta$ and $\\lambda$-deformations of supercoset\nstring sigma models, the basic example being the deformation of the $AdS_5\n\\times S^5$ superstring. We prove that the kappa symmetry variations for these\nmodels are of the standard Green-Schwarz form, and we determine the target\nspace supergeometry by computing the superspace torsion. We check that the\n$\\lambda$-deformation gives rise to a standard (generically type II*)\nsupergravity background; for the $\\eta$-model the requirement that the target\nspace is a supergravity solution translates into a simple condition on the\nR-matrix which enters the definition of the deformation. We further construct\nall such non-abelian R-matrices of rank four which solve the homogeneous\nclassical Yang-Baxter equation for the algebra so(2,4). We argue that the\ncorresponding backgrounds are equivalent to sequences of non-commuting\nTsT-transformations, and verify this explicitly for some of the examples.\n", "  Electric dipole moments and charged-lepton flavour-violating processes are\nextremely sensitive probes for new physics, complementary to direct searches as\nwell as flavour-changing processes in the quark sector. Beyond the\n\"smoking-gun\" feature of a potential significant measurement, however, it is\ncrucial to understand their implications for new physics models quantitatively.\nThe corresponding multi-scale problem of relating the existing high-precision\nmeasurements to fundamental parameters can be approached model-independently to\na large extent; however, care must be taken to include the uncertainties from\nespecially nuclear and QCD calculations properly.\n", "  The {\\AA}ngstr\\\"om-sized probe of the scanning transmission electron\nmicroscope can visualize and collect spectra from single atoms. This can\nunambiguously resolve the chemical structure of materials, but not their\nisotopic composition. Here we differentiate between two isotopes of the same\nelement by quantifying how likely the energetic imaging electrons are to eject\natoms. First, we measure the displacement probability in graphene grown from\neither $^{12}$C or $^{13}$C and describe the process using a quantum mechanical\nmodel of lattice vibrations coupled with density functional theory simulations.\nWe then test our spatial resolution in a mixed sample by ejecting individual\natoms from nanoscale areas spanning an interface region that is far from\natomically sharp, mapping the isotope concentration with a precision better\nthan 20%. Although we use a scanning instrument, our method should be\napplicable to any atomic resolution transmission electron microscope and to\nother low-dimensional materials.\n", "  We construct vector rogue wave solutions of the two-dimensional two coupled\nnonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equations with distributed coefficients, namely\ndiffraction, nonlinearity and gain parameters through similarity transformation\ntechnique. We transform the two-dimensional two coupled variable coefficients\nnonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equations into Manakov equation with a constraint\nthat connects diffraction and gain parameters with nonlinearity parameter. We\ninvestigate the characteristics of the constructed vector rogue wave solutions\nwith four different forms of diffraction parameters. We report some interesting\npatterns that occur in the rogue wave structures. Further, we construct vector\ndark rogue wave solutions of the two-dimensional two coupled nonlinear\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equations with distributed coefficients and report some novel\ncharacteristics that we observe in the vector dark rogue wave solutions.\n", "  The talk presents the main lines of biography of the prominent physicist and\nbright personality. Also given is a necessarily brief description of Gribov's\nscientific work.\n", "  Future applications of antiferromagnets (AFs) in many spintronics devices\nrely on the precise manipulation of domain walls. The conventional approach\nusing static magnetic fields is inefficient due to the low susceptibility of\nAFs. Recently proposed electrical manipulation with spin-orbit torques is\nrestricted to metals with a specific crystal structure.\n  Here we propose an alternative, broadly applicable approach: using asymmetric\nmagnetic field pulses to induce controlled ratchet motion of AF domain walls.\n  The efficiency of this approach is based on three peculiarities of AF\ndynamics. First, a time-dependent magnetic field couples with an AF order\nparameter stronger than a static magnetic field, which leads to higher mobility\nof the domain walls. Second, the rate of change of the magnetic field couples\nwith the spatial variation of the AF order parameter inside the domain and this\nenables synchronous motion of multiple domain walls with the same structure.\nThird, tailored asymmetric field pulses in combination with static friction can\nprevent backward motion of domain walls and thus lead to the desired controlled\nratchet effect.\n  The proposed use of an external field, rather than internal spin-orbit\ntorques, avoids any restrictions on size, conductivity, and crystal structure\nof the AF material.\n  We believe that our approach paves a way for the development of new AF-based\ndevices based on controlled motion of AF domain walls.\n", "  The photoproduction of $\\omega$ and $\\eta^\\prime$ mesons off carbon and\nniobium nuclei has been measured as a function of the meson momentum for\nincident photon energies of 1.2-2.9 GeV at the electron accelerator ELSA. The\nmesons have been identified via the $\\omega \\rightarrow \\pi^0 \\gamma\n\\rightarrow 3 \\gamma$ and $\\eta^\\prime\\rightarrow \\pi^0 \\pi^0\\eta \\rightarrow 6\n\\gamma$ decays, respectively, registered with the CBELSA/TAPS detector system.\nFrom the measured meson momentum distributions the momentum dependence of the\ntransparency ratio has been determined for both mesons. Within a Glauber\nanalysis the in-medium $\\omega$ and $\\eta^\\prime$ widths and the corresponding\nabsorption cross sections have been deduced as a function of the meson\nmomentum. The results are compared to recent theoretical predictions for the\nin-medium $\\omega$ width and $\\eta^\\prime$-N absorption cross sections. The\nenergy dependence of the imaginary part of the $\\omega$- and\n$\\eta^\\prime$-nucleus optical potential has been extracted. The finer binning\nof the present data compared to the existing data allows a more reliable\nextrapolation towards the production threshold. The modulus of the imaginary\npart of the $\\eta^\\prime$ nucleus potential is found to be about three times\nsmaller than recently determined values of the real part of the\n$\\eta^\\prime$-nucleus potential, which makes the $\\eta^\\prime$ meson a suitable\ncandidate for the search for meson-nucleus bound states. For the $\\omega$\nmeson, the modulus of the imaginary part near threshold is comparable to the\nmodulus of the real part of the potential. As a consequence, only broad\nstructures can be expected which makes the observation of $\\omega$ mesic states\nvery difficult experimentally.\n", "  We performed an angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy study of\nBaMn$_2$As$_2$ and BaMn$_2$Sb$_2$, which are isostructural to the parent\ncompound BaFe$_2$As$_2$ of the 122 family of ferropnictide superconductors. We\nshow the existence of a strongly $k_z$-dependent band gap with a minimum at the\nBrillouin zone center, in agreement with their semiconducting properties.\nDespite the half-filling of the electronic 3$d$ shell, we show that the band\nstructure in these materials is almost not renormalized from the Kohn-Sham\nbands of density functional theory. Our photon energy dependent study provides\nevidence for Mn-pnictide hybridization, which may play a role in tuning the\nelectronic correlations in these compounds.\n", "  Guided growth of semiconductor nanowires in nanotube templates has been\nconsidered as a potential platform for reproducible integration of III-Vs on\nsilicon or other mismatched substrates. Herein, we report on the challenges and\nprospects of molecular beam epitaxy of InAs nanowires on SiO2/Si nanotube\ntemplates. We show how and under which conditions the nanowire growth is\ninitiated by In-assisted vapor-liquid-solid growth enabled by the local\nconditions inside the nanotube template. The conditions for high yield of\nvertical nanowires are investigated in terms of the nanotube depth, diameter\nand V/III flux ratios. We present a model that further substantiates our\nfindings. This work opens new perspectives for monolithic integration of III-Vs\non the silicon platform enabling new applications in the electronics,\noptoelectronics and energy harvesting arena.\n", "  We report on ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG) Al0.75Ga0.25N channel\nmetal-insulator-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MISFET) with\nheterostructure engineered low-resistance ohmic contacts. The low intrinsic\nelectron affinity of AlN (0.6 eV) leads to large Schottky barriers at\nmetal-AlGaN interface, resulting in highly resistive ohmic contacts. In this\nwork, we use reverse compositional graded n++ AlGaN contact layer to achieve\nupward electron affinity grading, leading to a low specific contact resistance\nof 1.9x10-6 ohm.cm2 to n-Al0.75Ga0.25N channels (bandgap ~ 5.3 eV) with\nnon-alloyed contacts. We also demonstrate UWBG Al0.75Ga0.25N channel MISFET\ndevice operation employing compositional graded n++ ohmic contact layer and 20\nnm atomic layer deposited Al2O3 as the gate-dielectric.\n", "  Within the context of vector mediators, is a new signal observed in flavor\nchanging interactions, particularly in the neutral mesons systems\n$K^{0}-\\bar{K}^{0}$, $D^{0}-\\bar{D}^{0}$ and $B^0-\\bar{B^0}$, consistent with\ndilepton resonance searches at the LHC? In the attempt to address this very\nsimple question, we discuss the complementarity between flavor changing neutral\ncurrent (FCNC) and dilepton resonance searches at the LHC run 2 at $13$TeV with\n$3.2\\, {\\rm fb^{-1}}$ of integrated luminosity, in the context of vector\nmediators at tree level. Vector mediators, are often studied in the flavor\nchanging framework, specially in the light of the recent LHCb anomaly observed\nat the rare B decay. However, the existence of stringent dilepton bound\nseverely constrains flavor changing interactions, due to restrictive limits on\nthe $Z^{\\prime}$ mass. We discuss this interplay explicitly in the well\nmotivated framework of a 3-3-1 scheme, where fermions and scalars are arranged\nin the fundamental representation of the weak SU(3) gauge group. Due to the\npaucity of relevant parameters, we conclude dilepton data leave little room for\na possible new physics signal stemming from these systems, unless a very\npeculiar texture parametrization is used in the diagonalization of the CKM\nmatrix. In other words, if a signal is observed in such flavor changing\ninteractions, it is unlikely comes from a 3-3-1 model.\n", "  Magnetic field can penetrate into type-II superconductors in the form of\nAbrikosov vortices, which are magnetic flux tubes surrounded by circulating\nsupercurrents often trapped at defects referred to as pinning sites. Although\nthe average properties of the vortex matter can be tuned with magnetic fields,\ntemperature or electric currents, handling of individual vortices remains\nchallenging and has been demonstrated only with sophisticated magnetic force,\nsuperconducting quantum interference device or strain-induced scanning local\nprobe microscopies. Here, we introduce a far-field optical method based on\nlocal heating of the superconductor with a focused laser beam to realize a\nfast, precise and non-invasive manipulation of individual Abrikosov vortices,\nin the same way as with optical tweezers. This simple approach provides the\nperfect basis for sculpting the magnetic flux profile in superconducting\ndevices like a vortex lens or a vortex cleaner, without resorting to static\npinning or ratchet effects. Since a single vortex can induce a Josephson phase\nshift, our method also paves the way to fast optical drive of Josephson\njunctions, with potential massive parallelization of operations.\n", "  Observing the motion of the nuclear wavepackets during a molecular reaction,\nin both space and time, is crucial for understanding and controlling the\noutcome of photoinduced chemical reactions. We have imaged the motion of a\nvibrational wavepacket in isolated iodine molecules using ultrafast electron\ndiffraction with relativistic electrons. The time-varying interatomic distance\nwas measured with a precision 0.07 {\\AA} and temporal resolution of 230 fs\nfull-width at half-maximum (FWHM). The method is not only sensitive to the\nposition but also the shape of the nuclear wavepacket.\n", "  Violations of Bell inequalities are better preserved by turbulent atmospheric\nchannels than by comparable optical fibers in the scenario of copropagating\nentangled photons [A.A. Semenov and W. Vogel, Phys. Rev. A 81, 023835 (2010);\narXiv:0909.2492]. Here we reexamine this result for the case of\ncounterpropagation also considering the fact that each receiver registers\nso-called double-click events, which are caused by dark counts, stray light,\nand multi-photon entangled pairs. We show that advantages of the atmospheric\nlinks are feasible only for the copropagation scenario in the case of strong\nfluctuations of losses. For counterpropagation, the violations of Bell\ninequalities can be improved with an additional postselection procedure testing\nthe channel transmittance.\n", "  We address the transverse mobility of spatial solitons in competing\nparity-time-symmetric linear and nonlinear lattices. The competition between\nout-of-phase linear and nonlinear lattices results in a drastic mobility\nenhancement within a range of soliton energies. We show that within such range,\nthe addition of even a small imaginary part in the linear potential makes\nsoliton mobility strongly asymmetric. The minimal phase tilt required for\nsetting solitons into radiationless motion across the lattice in the direction\nopposite to that of the internal current drops to nearly zero, while the\nminimal phase tilt required for motion in the opposite direction notably\nincreases. For a given initial phase tilt, the velocity of soliton motion grows\nwith an increase of the balanced gain/losses. In this regime of enhanced\nmobility, tilted solitons can efficiently drag other solitons that were\ninitially at rest, to form moving soliton pairs.\n", "  Single photons are very useful resources in quantum information science. In\nreal applications it is often required that the photons have a well-defined\nspectral (or equivalently temporal) modal structure. For example, a rising\nexponential pulse is able to fully excite a two-level atom while a Gaussian\npulse cannot. This motivates the study of continuous-mode single-photon Fock\nstates. Such states are characterized by a spectral (or temporal) pulse shape.\nIn this paper we investigate the statistical property of continuous-mode\nsingle-photon Fock states. Instead of the commonly used normal ordering (Wick\norder), the tool we proposed is the Wigner spectrum. The Wigner spectrum has\ntwo advantages: 1) it allows to study continuous-mode single-photon Fock states\nin the time domain and frequency domain simultaneously; 2) because it can deal\nwith the Dirac delta function directly, it has the potential to provide more\ninformation than the normal ordering where the Dirac delta function is always\ndiscarded. We also show how various control methods in particular coherent\nfeedback control can be used to manipulate the pulse shapes of continuous-mode\nsingle-photon Fock states.\n", "  A density functional theory is proposed for strongly interacting fermions\nwith arbitrary large negative scattering length. The functional has only two\nparameters that are directly fixed to reproduce the universal properties of\nunitary gas: the so-called \"Bertsch parameter\" $\\xi_0$ and a parameter $\\eta_e$\nrelated to the possible influence of the effective range $r_e$ at infinite\nscattering length $a$. Using most recent quantum Monte-Carlo (QMC) estimates of\nthese two parameters, it is shown that the functional properly reproduces the\nexperimental measurements of interacting Fermi systems not only at unitarity\nbut also away from this limit over a wide range of $(ak_F)^{-1}$ values. The\nfunctional is applied to obtain an expression of the Tan's contact parameter\nincluding the effect of $r_e$. Application is finally made to neutron matter.\nIt is shown that most recent QMC results are well reproduced.\n", "  We demonstrate how an acoustic phonon bath when coupled to a quantum dot with\nthe help of a bichromatic laser field may effectively form a quantum squeezed\nreservoir. This approach allows to achieve an arbitrary degree of squeezing of\nthe effective reservoir and it incorporates the properties of the reservoir\ninto two parameters, which can be controlled by varying the ratio of the Rabi\nfrequencies of the bichromatic field. It is found that for unequal Rabi\nfrequencies, the effective reservoir may appear as a quantum squeezed field of\nordinary or inverted harmonic oscillators. When the Rabi frequencies are equal\nthe effective reservoir appears as a perfectly squeezed field in which the\ndecay of one of the polarization quadratures of the quantum dot dipole moment\nis inhibited. The decay of the quantum dot to a stationary state which depends\non the initial coherence is predicted. This unusual result is shown to be a\nconsequence of a quantum-nondemolition type coupling of the quantum dot to the\nengineered squeezed reservoir. The effect of the initial coherence on the\nsteady-state dressed-state population distribution and the fluorescence\nspectrum is discussed in details. The complete polarization of the dressed\nstate population and asymmetric spectra composed of only a single Rabi sideband\npeak are obtained under strictly resonant excitation.\n", "  We call \\textit{monomer} a B-DNA base pair and study, analytically and\nnumerically, electron or hole oscillations in \\textit{monomers},\n\\textit{dimers} and \\textit{trimers}. We employ two Tight Binding (TB)\napproaches: (I) at the base-pair level, using the on-site energies of the base\npairs and the hopping parameters between successive base pairs i.e. \\textit{a\nwire model}, and (II) at the single-base level, using the on-site energies of\nthe bases and the hopping parameters between neighbouring bases, specifically\nbetween (a) two successive bases in the same strand, (b) complementary bases\nthat define a base pair, and (c) diagonally located bases of successive base\npairs, i.e. \\textit{an extended ladder model} since it also includes the\ndiagonal hoppings (c). For \\textit{monomers}, with TB II, we predict periodic\ncarrier oscillations with frequency $f \\approx$ 50-550 THz. For\n\\textit{dimers}, with TB I, we predict periodic carrier oscillations with $f\n\\approx$ 0.25-100 THz. For \\textit{trimers made of identical monomers}, with TB\nI, we predict periodic carrier oscillations with $f \\approx$ 0.5-33 THz. In\nother cases, either with TB I or TB II, the oscillations may be not strictly\nperiodic, but Fourier analysis shows similar frequency content. For dimers and\ntrimers, TB I and TB II are successfully compared giving complementary aspects\nof the oscillations.\n", "  Ring-like structures in the ISM are commonly associated with high-mass stars.\nKinematic studies of large structures in GMCs toward these ring-like structures\nmay help us to understand how massive stars form. The origin and properties of\nthe ring-like structure G345.45+1.50 is investigated through observations of\nthe 13CO(3-2) line. The aim of the observations is to determine the kinematics\nin the region and to compare physical characteristics estimated from gas\nemission with those previously determined using dust continuum emission. The\n13CO(3-2) line was mapped toward the whole ring using the APEX telescope. The\nring is found to be expanding with a velocity of 1.0 km/s, containing a total\nmass of 6.9e3 Msun, which agrees well with that determined using 1.2 mm dust\ncontinuum emission. An expansion timescale of 3e6 yr and a total energy of 7e46\nerg are estimated. The origin of the ring might have been a supernova\nexplosion, since a 35.5 cm source, J165920-400424, is located at the center of\nthe ring without an infrared counterpart. The ring is fragmented, and 104\nclumps were identified with diameters of between 0.3 and 1.6 pc, masses of\nbetween 2.3 and 7.5e2 Msun, and densities of between 1.0e2 and 1.0e4 cm^-3. At\nleast 18% of the clumps are forming stars, as is shown in infrared images.\nAssuming that the clumps can be modeled as Bonnor-Ebert spheres, 13 clumps are\ncollapsing, and the rest of them are in hydrostatic equilibrium with an\nexternal pressure with a median value of 4e4 K cm^-3. In the region, the\nmolecular outflow IRAS 16562-3959 is identified, with a velocity range of 38.4\nkm/s, total mass of 13 Msun, and kinematic energy of 7e45 erg. Finally, five\nfilamentary structures were found at the edge of the ring with an average size\nof 3 pc, a width of 0.6 pc, a mass of 2e2 Msun, and a column density of 6e21\ncm^-2.\n", "  Graphene based transistors relying on a conventional structure cannot switch\nproperly because of the absence of an energy gap in graphene. To overcome this\nlimitation, a barristor device was proposed, whose operation is based on the\nmodulation of the graphene-semiconductor (GS) Schottky barrier by means of a\ntop gate, and demonstrating an ON-OFF current ratio up to $10^5$. Such a large\nnumber is likely due to the realization of an ultra clean interface with\nvirtually no interface trapped charge. However, it is indeed technologically\nrelevant to know the impact that the interface trapped charges might have on\nthe barristor's electrical properties. We have developed a physics based model\nof the gate tunable GS heterostructure where non-idealities such as Fermi Level\nPinning (FLP) and a \"bias dependent barrier lowering effect\" has been\nconsidered. Using the model we have made a comprehensive study of the\nbarristor's expected digital performance.\n", "  From the high vibrational dipolar strength offered by molecular liquids, we\ndemonstrate that a molecular vibration can be ultra-strongly coupled to\nmultiple IR cavity modes, with Rabi splittings reaching $24\\%$ of the vibration\nfrequencies. As a proof of the ultra-strong coupling regime, our experimental\ndata unambiguously reveal the contributions to the polaritonic dynamics coming\nfrom the anti-resonant terms in the interaction energy and from the dipolar\nself-energy of the molecular vibrations themselves. In particular, we measure\nthe opening of a genuine vibrational polaritonic bandgap of ca. $60$ meV. We\nalso demonstrate that the multimode splitting effect defines a whole\nvibrational ladder of heavy polaritonic states perfectly resolved. These\nfindings reveal the broad possibilities in the vibrational ultra-strong\ncoupling regime which impact both the optical and the molecular properties of\nsuch coupled systems, in particular in the context of mode-selective chemistry.\n", "  The analytic continuation of imaginary-time quantum Monte Carlo data to\nextract real-frequency spectra remains a key problem in connecting theory with\nexperiment. Here we present a fast and efficient stochastic optimization method\n(FESOM) as a more accessible variant of the stochastic optimization method\nintroduced by Mishchenko et al. and benchmark the resulting spectra with those\nobtained by the standard Maximum Entropy method for three representative test\ncases, in- cluding data taken from studies of the two-dimensional Hubbard\nmodel. We generally find that our FESOM approach gives spectra similar to the\nMaximum Entropy results. In particular, while the Maximum Entropy method gives\nsuperior results when the quality of the data is strong, we find that FESOM is\nable to resolve fine structure with more detail when the quality of the data is\npoor. In addition, because of its stochastic nature, the method provides\ndetailed information on the frequency dependent uncertainty of the resulting\nspectra, while the Maximum Entropy method does so only for the spectral weight\nintegrated over a finite frequency region. We therefore believe that this\nvariant of the stochastic optimization approach provides a viable alternative\nto the routinely used Maximum Entropy method especially for data with poor\nquality.\n", "  We demonstrate that important information about linear optical circuits can\nbe obtained through the phase shift induced by integrated optical resonators.\nAs a proof of principle, the phase of an unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer\nis determined. Then the method is applied to a complex optical circuit designed\nfor linear optical quantum computation. In this controlled-NOT gate with qubit\ninitialization and tomography stages, the relative phases are determined as\nwell as the coupling ratios of its directional couplers.\n", "  NGC 1365 is a Seyfert 2 galaxy with a starburst ring in its nuclear region.\nIn this work we look at the XMM Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS) data from\nfour 2012-13, three 2007 and two 2004 observations of NGC 1365. We characterise\nthe narrow-line emitting gas visible by XMM RGS and make comparisons between\nthe 2012-13 spectra and those from 2004-07, already published. This source is\nusually absorbed within the soft X-ray band, with a typical neutral column\ndensity of >1.5 x 10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$, and only 1 observation of the 9 we\ninvestigate shows low enough absorption for the continuum to emerge in the soft\nX-rays. We stack all observations from 2004-07, and separately three of the\nfour observations from 2012-13, analysing the less absorbed observation\nseparately. We first model the spectra using gaussian profiles representing the\nnarrow line emission. We fit physically motivated models to the 2012-13 stacked\nspectra, with collisionally ionised components representing the starburst\nemission and photoionised line emission models representing the AGN line\nemission. The collisional and photoionised emission line models are fitted\ntogether on top of a physical continuum and absorption model. The X-ray narrow\nemission line spectrum of NGC 1365 is well represented by a combination of two\ncollisionally ionised and three photoionised phases of emitting gas, all with\nhigher than solar nitrogen abundances. This physical model was fitted to the\n2012-13 stacked spectrum, and yet also fits well to the 2004-07 stacked\nspectrum, without changing any characteristics of the emitting gas phases. Our\n2004-07 results are consistent with previous emission line work using these\ndata, with 5 additional emission lines detected in both this and the 2012-13\nstacked spectra. We also estimate the distance of the X-ray line-emitting\nphotoionised gas from the central source to be <300 pc.\n", "  We consider a fermionic dark matter (DM) particle in renormalizable Standard\nModel (SM) gauge interactions in a simple $t$-channel model. The DM particle\ninteractions with SM fermions is through the exchange of scalar and vector\nmediators which carry colour or lepton number. In the case of coloured\nmediators considered in this study, we find that if the DM is thermally\nproduced and accounts for the observed relic density almost the entire\nparameter space is ruled out by the direct detection observations. The bounds\nfrom the monojet plus missing energy searches at the Large Hadron Collider are\nless stringent in this case. In contrast for the case of Majorana DM, we obtain\nstrong bounds from the monojet searches which rule out DM particles of mass\nless than about a few hundred GeV for both the scalar and vector mediators.\n", "  High-pressure phase of boron oxide, orthorhombic \\b{eta}-B2O3, has been\nstudied in situ by synchrotron X-ray diffraction to 22 GPa and Raman scattering\nto 46 GPa at room temperature. The bulk modulus of \\b{eta}-B2O3 has been found\nto be 169(3) GPa that is in good agreement with our ab initio calculations.\nRaman and IR spectra of \\b{eta}-B2O3 have been measured at ambient pressure,\nall experimentally observed bands have been attributed to the theoretically\ncalculated ones, and the mode assignment has been performed. Based on the data\non Raman shift as a function of pressure, combined with equation-of-state data,\nthe Gr\\\"uneisen parameters of all experimentally observed Raman bands have been\ncalculated. \\b{eta}-B2O3 enriched by 10B isotope has been synthesized, and the\neffect of boron isotopic substitution on Raman spectra has been studied.\n", "  We have investigated a recently proposed halo-based model, Camelus, for\npredicting weak-lensing peak counts, and compared its results over a collection\nof 162 cosmologies with those from N-body simulations. While counts from both\nmodels agree for peaks with $\\mathcal{S/N}>1$ (where $\\mathcal{S/N}$ is the\nratio of the peak height to the r.m.s. shape noise), we find $\\approx 50\\%$\nfewer counts for peaks near $\\mathcal{S/N}=0$ and significantly higher counts\nin the negative $\\mathcal{S/N}$ tail. Adding shape noise reduces the\ndifferences to within $20\\%$ for all cosmologies. We also found larger\ncovariances that are more sensitive to cosmological parameters. As a result,\ncredibility regions in the $\\{\\Omega_m, \\sigma_8\\}$ are $\\approx 30\\%$ larger.\nEven though the credible contours are commensurate, each model draws its\npredictive power from different types of peaks. Low peaks, especially those\nwith $2<\\mathcal{S/N}<3$, convey important cosmological information in N-body\ndata, as shown in \\cite{DietrichHartlap, Kratochvil2010}, but \\textsc{Camelus}\nconstrains cosmology almost exclusively from high significance peaks\n$(\\mathcal{S/N}>3)$. Our results confirm the importance of using a\ncosmology-dependent covariance with at least a 14\\% improvement in parameter\nconstraints. We identified the covariance estimation as the main driver behind\ndifferences in inference, and suggest possible ways to make Camelus even more\nuseful as a highly accurate peak count emulator.\n", "  We introduce the concepts of perpetual points and periodic perpetual loci in\ndiscrete--time systems (maps). The occurrence and analysis of these points/loci\nare shown and basic examples are considered. We discuss the potential usage and\nproperties of introduced concepts. The comparison of perpetual points and loci\nin discrete--time and continuous--time systems is presented. Discussed methods\ncan be widely applied in other dynamical systems.\n", "  Controlling the transport, trapping, and filtering of nanoparticles is\nimportant for many applications. By virtue of their weak response to gravity\nand their thermal motion, various physical mechanisms can be exploited for such\noperations on nanoparticles. However, the manipulation based on optical forces\nis potentially most appealing since it constitutes a highly deterministic\napproach. Plasmonic nanostructures have been suggested for this purpose, but\nthey possess the disadvantages of locally generating heat and trapping the\nnanoparticles directly on surface. Here, we propose the use of dielectric rings\nmade of high permittivity materials for trapping nanoparticles. Thanks to their\nability to strongly localize the field in space, nanoparticles can be trapped\nwithout contact. We use a semi-analytical method to study the ability of these\nrings to trap nanoparticles. Results are supported by full-wave simulations.\nApplication of the trapping concept to nanoparticle filtration is suggested.\n", "  Although Epsilon-Near-Zero metamaterials (ENZ) offer many unconventional ways\nto play with light, the optical impedance mismatch with surroundings can limit\nthe efficiency of future devices. We report here on the improvement of the\ntransmittance of an Epsilon-Near-Zero (ENZ) wavefront shaper. We first address\nin this paper the way to enhance the transmittance of a plane wave through a\nlayer of ENZ material thanks to a numerical optimization approach based on the\nTransfer Matrix Method. We then transpose the one dimensional approach to a two\ndimensional case where the emission of a dipole is shaped into a plane wave by\nan ENZ device with a design that optimizes the transmittance. As a result, we\ndemonstrate a transmittance efficiency of 15 \\% that is 4 orders of magnitude\nhigher than previous devices proposed in the literature for wavefront shaping\napplications. This work aims at paving the way for future efficient ENZ devices\nby offering new strategies to optimize the transmittance through ENZ materials.\n", "  We investigate the effect of shear and strain in graphene bilayers, under\nconditions where the distortion of the lattice gives rise to a smooth\none-dimensional modulation in the stacking sequence of the bilayer. We show\nthat strain and shear produce characteristic Moir\\'e patterns which can have\nthe same visual appearance on a large scale, but representing graphene bilayers\nwith quite different electronic properties. The different features in the\nlow-energy electronic bands can be ascribed to the effect of a fictitious\nnon-Abelian gauge field mimicking the smooth modulation of the stacking order.\nStrained and sheared bilayers show a complementary behavior, which can be\nunderstood from the fact that the non-Abelian gauge field acts as a repulsive\ninteraction in the former, expelling the electron density away from the\nstacking domain walls, while behaving as a confining interaction leading to\nlocalization of the electronic states in the sheared bilayers. In this latter\ncase, the presence of the effective gauge field explains the development of\nalmost flat low-energy bands, resembling the form of the zeroth Landau level\ncharacteristic of a Dirac fermion field. The estimate of the gauge field\nstrength in those systems gives a magnitude of the order of several tens of\nTesla, implying a robust phenomenology that should be susceptible of being\nobserved in suitably distorted bilayer samples.\n", "  We demonstrated that a triple-gated GaAs quantum point contact, which has an\nadditional surface gate between a pair of split gates to strengthen the lateral\nconfinement, produces the well-defined quantized conductance and\nFabry-P\\'erot-type (FP-type) oscillations on it even using a relatively low\nmobility wafer. A one-dimensional phenomenological model potential was\ndeveloped to explain the oscillatory behavior. By combining the model\ncalculations and dc bias spectroscopy, we obtained detailed information about\nthe energy scales of the oscillatory structures. The relationships between the\nFP-type oscillations and the anomaly below the first plateau will be addressed.\n", "  We examine the \"transmissibility\" of a simulated two-dimensional pack of\nfrictionless disks formed by confining dilute disks in a shrinking, periodic\nbox to the point of mechanical stability. Two opposite boundaries are then\nremoved, thus allowing a set of free motions. Small free displacements on one\nboundary then induce proportional displacements on the opposite boundary.\nTransmissibility is the ability to distinguish different perturbations by their\ndistant responses. We assess transmissibility by successively identifying free\northonormal modes of motion that have the {\\em smallest} distant responses. The\nlast modes to be identified in this \"pessimistic\" basis are the most\ntransmissive. The transmitted amplitudes of these most transmissive modes fall\noff exponentially with mode number. Similar exponential falloff is seen in a\nsimple elastic medium, though the responsible modes differ greatly in structure\nin the two systems. Thus the marginal pack's transmissibility is qualitatively\nsimilar to that of a simple elastic medium. We compare our results with recent\nfindings based on the projection of the space of free motion onto interior\nsites.\n", "  Parity-time ($\\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry is one of the most important\naccomplishments in optics over the past decade. Here the concept of\n$\\mathcal{PT}$ mode-locking of a laser is introduced, in which active phase\nlocking of cavity axial modes is realized by asymmetric mode coupling in a\ncomplex time crystal. $\\mathcal{PT}$ mode-locking shows a transition from\nsingle to double pulse emission as the $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry breaking point\nis crossed. The transition can show a turbulent behavior, depending on a\ndimensionless modulation parameter that plays the same role as the Reynolds\nnumber in hydrodynamic flows.\n", "  We study the effect of a single driven tracer particle in a bath of other\nparticles performing the random average process on an infinite line using a\nstochastic hydrodynamics approach. We consider arbitrary fixed as well as\nrandom initial conditions and compute the two-point correlations. For quenched\nuniform and annealed steady state initial conditions we show that in the large\ntime $T$ limit the fluctuations and the correlations of the positions of the\nparticles grow subdiffusively as $\\sqrt{T}$ and have well defined scaling forms\nunder proper rescaling of the labels. We compute the corresponding scaling\nfunctions exactly for these specific initial configurations and verify them\nnumerically. We also consider a non translationally invariant initial condition\nwith linearly increasing gaps where we show that the fluctuations and\ncorrelations grow superdiffusively as $T^{3/2}$ at large times.\n", "  In conjunction with ab initio potential energy and dipole moment surfaces for\nthe electronic ground state, we have made a theoretical study of the radiative\nlifetimes for the hydronium ion H$_3$O$^{+}$ and its deuterated isotopologues.\nWe compute the ro-vibrational energy levels and their associated wavefunctions\ntogether with Einstein coefficients for the electric dipole transitions. A\ndetailed analysis of the stability of the ro-vibrational states have been\ncarried out and the longest-living states of the hydronium ions have been\nidentified. We report estimated radiative lifetimes and cooling functions for\ntemperatures $<$ 200 K. A number of long-living meta-stable states are\nidentified, capable of population trapping.\n", "  Coherent electron spin dynamics in 10-nm-wide InGaAs/InAlAs quantum wells is\nstudied from 10 K to room temperature using time-resolved Kerr rotation. The\nspin lifetime exceeds 1 ns at 10 K and decreases with temperature. By varying\nthe spatial overlap between pump and probe pulses, a diffusive velocity is\nimprinted on the measured electron spins and a spin precession in the\nspin-orbit field is measured. A Rashba symmetry of the SOI is determined. By\ncomparing the spatial precession frequency gradient with the spin decay rate,\nan upper limit for the Rashba coefficients $\\alpha$ of 2$\\times$10$^{-12}$ eVm\nis estimated.\n", "  Faster magnetic recording technology is indispensable to massive data storage\nand big data sciences. {All-optical spin switching offers a possible solution},\nbut at present it is limited to a handful of expensive and complex rare-earth\nferrimagnets. The spin switching in more abundant ferromagnets may\nsignificantly expand the scope of all-optical spin switching. Here by studying\n40,000 ferromagnetic spins, we show that it is the optical spin-orbit torque\nthat determines the course of spin switching in both ferromagnets and\nferrimagnets. Spin switching occurs only if the effective spin angular momentum\nof each constituent in an alloy exceeds a critical value. Because of the strong\nexchange coupling, the spin switches much faster in ferromagnets than\nweakly-coupled ferrimagnets. This establishes a paradigm for all-optical spin\nswitching. The resultant magnetic field (65 T) is so big that it will\nsignificantly reduce high current in spintronics, thus representing the\nbeginning of photospintronics.\n", "  We propose a current-in-plane spin-valve field-effect transistor\n(CIP-SV-FET), which is composed of a ferromagnet / nonferromagnet / ferromagnet\ntrilayer structure and a gate electrode. This is a promising device alternative\nto spin metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors. Here, we fabricate\na ferromagnetic-semiconductor GaMnAs-based CIP-SV-FET and demonstrate its basic\noperation of the resistance modulation both by the magnetization configuration\nand by the gate electric field. Furthermore, we present the\nelectric-field-assisted magnetization reversal in this device.\n", "  An all-optical detection method for the detection of acoustic pressure waves\nis demonstrated. The detection system is based on a stripped (bare) single-mode\nfiber. The fiber vibrates as a standard cantilever and the optical output from\nthe fiber is imaged to a displacement-sensitive optical detector. The absence\nof a conventional microphone makes the demonstrated system less susceptible to\nthe effects that a hazardous environment might have on the sensor. The sensor\nis also useful for measurements in high temperature (above $200^{\\circ}$C)\nenvironments where conventional microphones will not operate. The\nproof-of-concept of the all-optical detection method is demonstrated by\ndetecting sound waves generated by the photo-acoustic effect of NO$_2$ excited\nby a 455 nm LED, where a detection sensitivity of approximately 50 ppm was\nachieved.\n", "  Magnetic rotational spectroscopy is based on the use of magnetic micron-size\nwires for viscosity measurements. Submitted to a rotational magnetic field with\nincreasing frequency, the wires undergo a hydrodynamic instability between a\nsynchronous and an asynchronous regime. From a comparison between predictions\nand experiments, the static shear viscosity and elastic modulus of wormlike\nmicellar solutions are here determined. The values agree with the determination\nby cone-and-plate rheometry.\n", "  We report current-direction dependent or unidirectional magnetoresistance\n(UMR) in magnetic/nonmagnetic topological insulator (TI) heterostructures,\nCr$_x$(Bi$_{1-y}$Sb$_y$)$_{2-x}$Te$_3$/(Bi$_{1-y}$Sb$_y$)$_2$Te$_3$, that is\nseveral orders of magnitude larger than in other reported systems. From the\nmagnetic field and temperature dependence, the UMR is identified to originate\nfrom the asymmetric scattering of electrons by magnons. In particular, the\nlarge magnitude of UMR is an outcome of spin-momentum locking and a small Fermi\nwavenumber at the surface of TI. In fact, the UMR is maximized around the Dirac\npoint with the minimal Fermi wavenumber.\n", "  We present experimental studies of the power spectrum and other fluctuation\nproperties in the spectra of microwave networks simulating chaotic quantum\ngraphs with violated time reversal in- variance. On the basis of our data sets\nwe demonstrate that the power spectrum in combination with other long-range and\nalso short-range spectral fluctuations provides a powerful tool for the\nidentification of the symmetries and the determination of the fraction of\nmissing levels. Such a pro- cedure is indispensable for the evaluation of the\nfluctuation properties in the spectra of real physical systems like, e.g.,\nnuclei or molecules, where one has to deal with the problem of missing levels.\n", "  In this paper, we study the covariant form of the non-relativistic\nSchrodinger-Pauli equation in the space-time generated by a cosmic string and\ndiscuss the solutions of this equation in present of interaction between the\nmagnetic dipole momentum and electromagnetic field. We study the influence of\nthe topology on this system. We obtain the solution of radial part as well as\nthe energy levels. We consider all thermodynamic properties of neutral particle\nin magnetic cosmic string background by using an approach based on the\npartition function method.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the thermodynamics of higher-dimensional $f(R)$\nblack holes in the extended phase space. Both the analytic expressions and\nnumerical results for the possible critical physical quantities are obtained.\nIt is proved that meaningful critical specific volume only exists when $p$ is\nodd. This unique phenomenon may be attributed to the combined effect of $f(R)$\ngravity and conformally invariant Maxwell field. It is also shown that the\nratio $P_cv_c/T_c$ differs from that of higher dimensional charged AdS black\nholes in Einstein gravity. However, the ratio for four-dimensional $f(R)$ black\nholes is the same as that of four-dimensional RN-AdS black holes, implying that\n$f(R)$ gravity does not influence the ratio. So the ratio may be related to\nconformally invariant Maxwell field. To probe the phase transition, we derive\nthe explicit expression of the Gibbs free energy with its graph plotted. Phase\ntransition analogous to the van der Waals liquid-gas system take place between\nthe small black hole and the large black hole. Classical swallow tail behavior,\ncharacteristic of first order phase transition, can also be observed in the\nGibbs free energy graph. Critical exponents are also calculated. It is shown\nthat these exponents are exactly the same as those of other AdS black holes,\nimplying that neither $f(R)$ gravity nor conformally invariant Maxwell field\ninfluence the critical exponents. Since the investigated black hole solution\ndepends on the form of the function $f(R)$, we discuss in detail how our\nresults put constraint on the form of the function $f(R)$ and we also present a\nsimple example.\n", "  In a counter-ion only charged fluid, Coulomb coupling is quantified by a\nsingle dimensionless parameter. Yet, the theoretical treatment of moderately to\nstrongly coupled charged fluids is a difficult task, central to the\nunderstanding of a wealth of soft matter problems, including biological\nsystems. We show that the corresponding coupling regime can be remarkably well\ndescribed by a single particle treatment, which, at variance with previous\nworks, takes due account of inter-ionic interactions. To this end, the\nprototypical problem of a planar charged dielectric interface is worked out.\nTesting our predictions against Monte Carlo simulation data reveals an\nexcellent agreement.\n", "  The size-dependent contact angle and the drying and wetting morphological\ntransition are studied with respect to the volume change for a spherical\ncap-shaped droplet placed on a spherical substrate. The line-tension effect is\nincluded using the rigorous formula for the Helmholtz free energy in the\ndroplet capillary model. A morphological drying transition from a cap-shaped to\na spherical droplet occurs when the substrate is hydrophobic and the droplet\nvolume is small, similar to the transition predicted on a flat substrate. In\naddition, a morphological wetting transition from a cap-shaped to a wrapped\nspherical droplet occurs for a hydrophilic substrate and a large droplet\nvolume. The contact angle depends on the droplet size: it decreases as the\ndroplet volume increases when the line tension is positive, whereas it\nincreases when the line tension is negative. The spherical droplets and wrapped\ndroplets are stable when the line tension is positive and large.\n", "  The full spin density fluctuations (SDF) spectra in 3d paramagnetic metals\nare analyzed from first principles using the linear response technique. Using\nthe calculated complete wavevector and energy dependence of the dynamic spin\nsusceptibility, we obtain the most important, but elusive, characteristic of\nSDF in solids: on-site spin correlator (SC). We demonstrate that the SDF have a\nmixed character consisting of interacting collective and single-particle\nexcitations of similar strength spreading continuously over the entire\nBrillouin zone and a wide energy range up to femtosecond time scales. These\nexcitations cannot be adiabatically separated and their intrinsically\nmultiscale nature should be always taken into account for a proper description\nof metallic systems. Overall, in all studied systems, despite the lack of local\nmoment, we found a very large SC resulting in an effective fluctuating moment\nof the order of several Bohr magnetons.\n", "  Reply to the Comment [arXiv:1609.04476] on a recent work in PRL [Phys. Rev.\nLett. 116, 036601 (2016), arXiv:1511.02994v2].\n", "  The monochromatic and geometrically anisotropic acoustic field generated by\n400 nm and 120 nm diameter copper nanowires simply dropped on a 10 $\\mu$m\nsilicon membrane is investigated in transmission using three-dimensional\ntime-resolved femtosecond pump-probe experiments. Two pump-probe time-resolved\nexperiments are carried out at the same time on both side of the silicon\nsubstrate. In reflection, the first radial breathing mode of the nanowire is\nexcited and detected. In transmission, the longitudinal and shear waves are\nobserved. The longitudinal signal is followed by a monochromatic component\nassociated with the relaxation of the nanowire's first radial breathing mode.\nFinite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) simulations are performed and accurately\nreproduce the diffracted field. A shape anisotropy resulting from the large\naspect ratio of the nanowire is detected in the acoustic field. The orientation\nof the underlying nanowires is thus acoustically deduced.\n", "  We demonstrate, through 3-dimensional discrete dislocation dynamics\nsimulations, that the com- plex dynamical response of nano and micro crystals\nto external constraints can be tuned. Under load rate control, strain bursts\nare shown to exhibit scale-free avalanche statistics, similar to critical\nphenomena in many physical systems. For the other extreme of displacement rate\ncontrol, strain burst response transitions to quasi-periodic oscillations,\nsimilar to stick-slip earthquakes. External load mode control is shown to\nenable a qualitative transition in the complex collective dynamics of\ndislocations from self-organized criticality to quasi-periodic oscillations.\n", "  We propose that mass-imbalanced superconductivity is realized in an effective\ntwo-channel Kondo lattice, and its characteristic property appears in\nelectromagnetic responses such as the Meissner effect. Starting from an\neffective two-channel Kondo lattice model as a low-energy effective theory, and\napproximating it with two mean-field order parameter components in a\nself-consistent fashion, it is shown that the balance of the two components is\nsensitively reflected in the magnitude of the Meissner kernel, while\nthermodynamic properties are little affected by the balance. This remarkable\nbehavior is understood by the localized character of one partner in the Cooper\npair, namely, the effect of the mass imbalance. We briefly mention the\nrelevance to the huge enhancement of the upper critical field under pressure\nobserved in Pr 1-2-20 systems.\n", "  This paper is devoted to the construction of what we will call {\\em exactly\nsolvable models}, i.e. of quantum mechanical systems described by an\nHamiltonian $H$ whose eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be explicitly\nconstructed out of some {\\em minimal ingredients}. In particular, motivated by\nPT-quantum mechanics, we will not insist on any self-adjointness feature of the\nHamiltonians considered in our construction. We also introduce the so-called\nbicoherent states, we analyze some of their properties and we show how they can\nbe used for quantizing a system. Some examples, both in finite and in\ninfinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, are discussed.\n", "  We study the properties of composite free layers with perpendicular\nanisotropy. The free layers are made of a soft FeCoB layer ferromagnetically\ncoupled by a variable spacer (Ta, W, Mo) to a very anisotropic [Co/Ni]\nmultilayer embodied in a magnetic tunnel junction meant for spin torque memory\napplications. For this we use broadband ferromagnetic resonance to follow the\nfield dependence of the acoustical and optical excitation of the composite free\nlayer in both in-plane and out-of-plane applied fields. The modeling provides\nthe interlayer exchange coupling, the anisotropies and the damping factors. The\npopular Ta spacer are outperformed by W and even more by Mo, which combines the\nstrongest interlayer exchange coupling without sacrificing anisotropies,\ndamping factors and transport properties.\n", "  We propose a novel method to enhance the transverse magneto-optical Kerr\neffect (TMOKE) in the magneto-plasmonic (MP) nanostructures by means of the\nactive dielectric layer. We report the theoretical analysis of the\nmagnetoplasmonic structure with a ferromagnetic dielectric doped with\nrear-earth ions (Nd3+) as the example of a gain layer. The enhancement takes\nplace near the surface plasmon polariton (SPP) resonances of the\nnanostructures. The stimulated emission of the dopants in the field of SPP wave\npartially compensates its losses. It is shown that due to a decrease of SPP\ndamping a Q-factor of the MP resonance increases and the TMOKE is increased in\ncomparison with the passive nanostructure.\n", "  Over the past 10 years, we have developed at University Paris Sud a first\nyear course on geometrical optics centered on experimentation. In contrast with\nthe traditional top-down learning structure usually applied at university, in\nwhich practical sessions are often a mere verification of the laws taught\nduring preceding lectures, this course promotes \"active learning\" and focuses\non experiments made by the students. Interaction among students and self\nquestioning are strongly encouraged and practicing comes first, before any\ntheoretical knowledge. Through a series of concrete examples, the present paper\ndescribes the philosophy underlying the teaching in this course. We demonstrate\nthat not only geometrical optics can be taught through experiments, but also\nthat it can serve as a useful introduction to experimental physics. Feedback\nover the last ten years shows that our approach succeeds in helping students to\nlearn better and acquire motivation and autonomy. This approach can easily be\napplied to other fields of physics.\n", "  The quantum states representing classical phase space are given, and these\nare used to formulate quantum statistical mechanics as a formally exact double\nperturbation expansion about classical statistical mechanics. One series of\nquantum contributions arises from the non-commutativity of the position and\nmomentum operators. Although the formulation of the quantum states differs, the\npresent results for separate averages of position operators and of momentum\noperators agree with Wigner (1932) and Kirkwood (1933). The second series\narises from wave function symmetrization, and is given in terms of $l$-particle\npermutation loops in an infinite order re-summation. The series gives\nanalytically the known exact result for the quantum ideal gas to all orders.\nThe leading correction corrects a correction given by Kirkwood.\n  The first four quantum corrections to the grand potential are calculated for\na Lennard-Jones fluid using the hypernetted chain closure. For helium on liquid\nbranch isotherms, the corrections range from several times to 1\\% of the total\nclassical pressure, with the effects of non-commutativity being significantly\nlarger in magnitude than those of wave function symmetrization. All corrections\nare found to be negligible for argon at the densities and temperatures studied.\nThe calculations are computationally trivial as the method avoids having to\ncompute eigenfunctions, eigenvalues, and numerical symmetrization.\n", "  We investigate the ground-state properties of a two-species condensate of\ninteracting bosons in a double-well potential. Each atomic species is described\nby a two-space-mode Bose-Hubbard model. The coupling of the two species is\ncontrolled by the interspecies interaction $W$. To analyze the ground state\nwhen $W$ is varied in both the repulsive ($W>0$) and the attractive ($W<0$)\nregime, we apply two different approaches. First we solve the problem\nnumerically i) to obtain an exact description of the ground-state structure and\nii ) to characterize its correlation properties by studying (the appropriate\nextensions to the present case of) the quantum Fisher information, the\ncoherence visibility and the entanglement entropy as functions of $W$. Then we\napproach analytically the description of the low-energy scenario by means of\nthe Bogoliubov scheme. In this framework the ground-state transition from\ndelocalized to localized species (with space separation for $W>0$, and mixing\nfor $W<0$) is well reproduced. These predictions are qualitatively corroborated\nby our numerical results. We show that such a transition features a spectral\ncollapse reflecting the dramatic change of the dynamical algebra of the\nfour-mode model Hamiltonian.\n", "  We propose an entropic measure of non-classical correlations in general mixed\nstates of fermion systems, based on the loss of information due to the unread\nmeasurement of the occupancy of single particle states of a given basis. When\nminimized over all possible single particle bases, the measure reduces to an\nentanglement entropy for pure states and vanishes only for states which are\ndiagonal in a Slater determinant basis. The approach is also suitable for\nstates having definite number parity yet not necessarily a fixed particle\nnumber, in which case the minimization can be extended to all bases related\nthrough a Bogoliubov transformation if quasiparticle mode measurements are also\nconsidered. General stationary conditions for determining the optimizing basis\nare derived. For a mixture of a general pure state with the maximally mixed\nstate, a general analytic evaluation of the present measure and optimizing\nbasis is provided, which shows that non-entangled mixed states may nonetheless\nexhibit a non-zero information loss.\n", "  Low-energy collective electronic excitations exhibiting sound-like linear\ndispersion have been intensively studied both experimentally and theoretically\nfor a long time. However, coherent acoustic plasmon modes appearing in\ntime-domain measurements are rarely observed due to Landau damping by the\nsingle-particle continua. Here we report on the observation of coherent\nacoustic Dirac plasmon (CADP) modes excited in indirectly (electrostatically)\nopposite-surface coupled films of the topological insulator Bi2Se3. Using\ntransient second harmonic generation, a technique capable of independently\nmonitoring the in-plane and out-of-plane electron dynamics in the films, the\nGHz-range oscillations were observed without corresponding oscillations in the\ntransient reflectivity. These oscillations were assigned to the transverse\nmagnetic and transverse electric guided CADP modes induced by the evanescent\nguided Lamb acoustic waves and remained Landau undamped due to fermion\ntunneling between the opposite-surface Dirac states.\n", "  Up-conversion single photon detector (UCSPD) has been widely used in many\nresearch fields including quantum key distribution (QKD), lidar, optical time\ndomain reflectrometry (OTDR) and deep space communication. For the first time\nin laboratory, we have developed an integrated four-channel all-fiber UCSPD\nwhich can work in both free-running and gate modes. This compact module can\nsatisfy different experimental demands with adjustable detection efficiency and\ndark count. We have characterized the key parameters of the UCSPD system.\n", "  The distinction between the damping coefficient and the effective non-linear\nmobility of driven particles in active micro-rheology of supercooled liquids is\nexplained in terms of individual and collective dynamics. The effective\nmobility arises as a collective effect which gives insight into the energy\nlandscape of the system. On the other hand, the damping coefficient is a\nconstant that modulates the effect of external forces over the thermal energy\nwhich particles have at their disposition to perform Brownian motion. For long\ntimes, these thermal fluctuations become characterized in terms of an effective\ntemperature that is a consequence of the dynamic coupling between kinetic and\nconfigurational degrees of freedom induced by the presence of the strong\nexternal force. The interplay between collective mobility and effective\ntemperature allows to formulate a generalized Stokes-Einstein relation that may\nbe used to determine the collective diffusion coefficient. The explicit\nrelations we deduce reproduce simulation data remarkably well.\n", "  Reentrant integer quantum Hall (RIQH) states are believed to be correlated\nelectron solid phases, though their microscopic description remains unclear. As\nbias current increases, longitudinal and Hall resistivities measured for these\nstates exhibit multiple sharp breakdown transitions, a signature unique to RIQH\nstates. A comparison of RIQH breakdown characteristics at multiple voltage\nprobes indicates that these signatures can be ascribed to a phase boundary\nbetween broken-down and unbroken regions, spreading chirally from source and\ndrain contacts as a function of bias current and passing voltage probes one by\none. The chiral sense of the spreading is not set by the chirality of the edge\nstate itself, instead depending on electron- or hole-like character of the RIQH\nstate.\n", "  The coupled dynamics of entangled polymers which span a broad time and length\nscales govern the unique viscoelastic properties of polymers. To follow chain\nmobility by numerical simulations from the intermediate Rouse and reptation\nregimes to the late time diffusive regime, highly coarse grained models with\npurely repulsive interactions between monomers are widely used since they are\ncomputationally the most efficient. Here using large scale molecular dynamics\nsimulations the effect of including the attractive interaction between monomers\non the dynamics of entangled polymers melts is explored for the first time over\nwide temperature range. Attractive interactions has little effect on the local\npacking for all temperatures T and on the chain mobility for T higher than\nabout twice the glass transition Tg. These results, across a broad range of\nmolecular weight, show that to study the dynamics of entangled polymers melts\nthe interactions can be treated as pure repulsive, confirming a posteriori the\nvalidity of previous studies and opening the way to new large scale numerical\nsimulations.\n", "  Spin dipole (SD) strengths for double beta-decay (DBD) nuclei were studied\nexperimentally for the first time by using measured cross sections of (3He,t)\ncharge exchange reactions (CERs). Then SD nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) for\nlow-lying 2- states were derived from the experimental SD strengths by\nreferring to the experimental GT (Gamow-Teller) and F (Fermi) strengths. They\nare consistent with the empirical SD NMEs based on the quasi-particle model\nwith the empirical effective SD coupling constant. The CERs are used to\nevaluate the SD NME, which is associated with one of the major components of\nthe neutrino-less DBD NME.\n", "  We present a microscopic study of superconductivity in OsB2 , and discuss the\norigin and characteristic length scales of the superconducting state. From\nfirst-principles we show that OsB2 is characterized by three different Fermi\nsheets, and we prove that this fermiology complies with recent\nquantum-oscillation experiments. Using the found microscopic properties, and\nexperimental data from the literature, we employ Ginzburg-Landau relations to\nreveal that OsB2 is a distinctly type-I superconductor with very low\nGinzburg-Landau parameter kappa - a rare property among compound materials. We\nshow that the found coherence length and penetration depth corroborate the\nmeasured thermodynamic critical field. Moreover, our calculation of the\nsuperconducting gap structure using anisotropic Eliashberg theory and ab initio\ncalculated electron-phonon interaction as input reveals a single but\nanisotropic gap. The calculated gap spectrum is shown to give an excellent\naccount for the unconventional behavior of the superfluid density of OsB2\nmeasured in experiments as a function of temperature. This reveals that gap\nanisotropy can explain such behavior, observed in several compounds, which was\npreviously attributed solely to a two-gap nature of superconductivity.\n", "  We investigate experimentally and numerically the field-free orientation of\nthe symmetric top molecule of methyl-iodide at high temperature using a\nterahertz radiation generated by a plasma induced by a two-color laser beam.\nThe degree of orientation is measured from the free-induction decay emitted by\nthe sample. The observed experimental signal is reproduced with a good accuracy\nby numerical simulations.\n", "  Enhanced diffusion of passive tracers immersed in active fluids is a\nuniversal feature of active fluids and has been extensively studied in recent\nyears. Similar to microrheology for equilibrium complex fluids, the unusual\nenhanced particle dynamics reveal intrinsic properties of active fluids.\nNevertheless, previous studies have shown that the translational dynamics of\nspherical tracers are qualitatively similar, independent of whether active\nparticles are pushers or pullers---the two fundamental classes of active\nfluids. Is it possible to distinguish pushers from pullers by simply imaging\nthe dynamics of passive tracers? Here, we investigated the diffusion of\nisolated ellipsoids in algal C. reinhardtii suspensions---a model for\npuller-type active fluids. In combination with our previous results on\npusher-type E. coli suspensions [Peng et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 068303\n(2016)], we showed that the dynamics of asymmetric tracers show a profound\ndifference in pushers and pullers due to their rotational degree of freedom.\nAlthough the laboratory-frame translation and rotation of ellipsoids are\nenhanced in both pushers and pullers, similar to spherical tracers, the\nanisotropic diffusion in the body frame of ellipsoids shows opposite trends in\nthe two classes of active fluids. An ellipsoid diffuses fastest along its major\naxis when immersed in pullers, whereas it diffuses slowest along the major axis\nin pushers. This striking difference can be qualitatively explained using a\nsimple hydrodynamic model. In addition, our study on algal suspensions reveals\nthat the influence of the near-field advection of algal swimming flows on the\ntranslation and rotation of ellipsoids shows different ranges and strengths.\nOur work provides not only new insights into universal organizing principles of\nactive fluids, but also a convenient tool for detecting the class of active\nparticles.\n", "  Layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) provide an ideal platform for\nexploring the effects of dimensionality on correlated electronic phases such as\ncharge density wave (CDW) order. When TMDs are reduced in thickness to the 2-D\nlimit, it is expected that the substrates will exert considerable influence on\nthe electron states. Here we report a study of the charge density wave (CDW)\nstate in 1T-TiSe2 nanosheets of different thicknesses when the sheets are\nencapsulated by hexagonal Boron Nitride (h-BN) or supported on SiO2 substrate.\nOur results show that dimensionality reduction results in an enhancement of CDW\norder and that disorder and substrate phonons tends to destroy CDW order,\npreventing observation of intrinsic CDW transition in ultrathin samples.\nEncapsulated 10 nm thick 1T-TiSe2 samples exhibit intrinsic CDW with transition\ntemperature as high as 235 K. Our study points out that choosing the right\nsubstrate is important in the search for room temperature CDW materials.\n", "  This work is devoted to the thermodynamics of gravitational clustering, a\ncollective phenomenon with a great relevance in the $N$-body cosmological\nproblem. We study a classical self-gravitating gas of identical\nnon-relativistic particles defined on the sphere $\\mathbb{S}^{3}\\subset\n\\mathbb{R}^{4}$ by considering gravitational interaction that corresponds to\nthis geometric space. The analysis is performed within microcanonical\ndescription of an isolated Hamiltonian system by combining continuum\napproximation and steepest descend method. According to numerical solution of\nresulting equations, the gravitational clustering can be associated with two\nmicrocanonical phase transitions. A first phase transition with a continuous\ncharacter is associated with breakdown of $SO(4)$ symmetry of this model. The\nsecond one is the gravitational collapse, whose continuous or discontinuous\ncharacter crucially depends on the regularization of short-range divergence of\ngravitation potential. We also derive the thermodynamic limit of this model\nsystem, the astrophysical counterpart of Gibbs-Duhem relation, the order\nparameters that characterize its phase transitions and the equation of state.\nOther interesting behavior is the existence of states with negative heat\ncapacities, which appear when the effects of gravitation turn dominant for\nenergies sufficiently low. Finally, we comment the relevance of some of these\nresults in the study of astrophysical and cosmological situations. Special\ninterest deserves the gravitational modification of the equation of state due\nto the local inhomogeneities of matter distribution. Although this feature is\nsystematically neglected in studies about Universe expansion, the same one is\nable to mimic an effect that is attributed to the dark energy: a negative\npressure.\n", "  We provide a review of the experimental and theoretical research in the field\nof quantum tomography with an emphasis on recently developed adaptive\nprotocols. Several statistical frameworks for adaptive experimental design are\ndiscussed. We argue in favor of the Bayesian approach, highlighting both its\nadvantages for a statistical reconstruction of unknown quantum states and\nprocesses, and utility for adaptive experimental design. The discussion is\nsupported by an analysis of several recent experimental implementations and\nnumerical recipes.\n", "  Randomly branching polymers with {\\em annealed} connectivity are model\nsystems for ring polymers and chromosomes. In this context, the branched\nstructure represents transient folding induced by topological constraints. Here\nwe present computer simulations of melts of annealed randomly branching\npolymers of $3 \\le N \\le 1800$ segments in $d=2$ and $d=3$ dimensions. In all\ncases, we perform a detailed analysis of the observed tree connectivities and\nspatial conformations. Our results are in excellent agreement with an\nasymptotic scaling of the average tree size of $R \\sim N^{1/d}$, suggesting\nthat the trees behave as compact, {\\it territorial} fractals. The observed\nswelling relative to the size of ideal trees, $R\\sim N^{1/4}$, demonstrates\nthat excluded volume interactions are only partially screened in melts of\nannealed trees. Overall, our results are in good qualitative agreement with the\npredictions of Flory theory. In particular, we find that the trees swell by the\ncombination of modified branching and path stretching. However, the former\neffect is subdominant and difficult to detect in $d=3$ dimensions.\n", "  We demonstrate a size sensitive experimental scheme which enables\nbidirectional transport and fractionation of paramagnetic colloids in a fluid\nmedium. It is shown that two types of magnetic colloidal particles with\ndifferent sizes can be simultaneously transported in opposite directions, when\ndeposited above a stripe-patterned ferrite garnet film subjected to a\nsquare-wave magnetic modulation. Due to their different sizes, the particles\nare located at distinct elevations above the surface, and they experience two\ndifferent energy landscapes, generated by the modulated magnetic substrate. By\ncombining theoretical arguments and numerical simulations, we reveal such\nenergy landscapes, which fully explain the bidirectional transport mechanism.\nThe proposed technique does not require pre-imposed channel geometries such as\nin conventional microfluidics or lab-on-a-chip systems, and permits remote\ncontrol over the particle motion, speed and trajectory, by using relatively low\nintense magnetic fields.\n", "  A simple approach to describe the long-wavelength dispersion of the\nlongitudinal (plasmon) mode of the classical one-component-plasma (OCP), with\nthe main objective to correctly capture the onset of negative dispersion, is\nproposed. The approach is applicable to both three-dimensional and\ntwo-dimensional OCP. The predicted onset of negative dispersion compares well\nwith the available results from numerical simulations and more sophisticated\ntheoretical models.\n", "  Photosynthesis has been a long-standing research interest due to its\nfundamental importance. Recently, studies on photosynthesis processes also have\ninspired attention from a thermodynamical aspect when considering\nphotosynthetic apparatuses as biological quantum heat engines. Quantum\ncoherence is shown to play a crucial role in enhancing the performance of these\nquantum heat engines. Based on the experimentally reported structure, we\npropose a quantum heat engine model with a non-Markovian vibrational mode. We\nshow that one can obtain a performance enhancement easily for a wide range of\nparameters in the presence of the vibrational mode. Our results provide\ninsights into the photosynthetic processes and a design principle mimicking\nnatural organisms.\n", "  The unconventional superconductivity in the noncentrosymmetric LaNiC$_2$, and\nits evolution with pressure, is analyzed basing on the {\\it ab initio}\ncomputations and the full Eliashberg formalism. First principles calculations\nof the electronic structure, phonons and the electron-phonon coupling are\nreported in the pressure range 0-15 GPa. The thermodynamic properties of the\nsuperconducting state were determined numerically solving the Eliashberg\nequations. We found that already at $p=0$ GPa, the superconducting parameters\ndeviate from the BCS-type, and a large value of the Coulomb pseudopotential\n$\\mu^{\\star}=0.22$ is required to get the critical temperature $T_c = 2.8$~K\nconsistent with experiment. If such $\\mu^{\\star}$ is used, the Eliashberg\nformalism reproduces also the experimentally observed values of the\nsuperconducting order parameter, the electronic specific heat jump at the\ncritical temperature, and the change of the London penetration depth with\ntemperature. This shows, that deviation of the above-mentioned parameters from\nthe BCS predictions do not prejudge on the triplet or multiple gap nature of\nthe superconductivity in this compound. Under the external pressure,\ncalculations predict continuous increase of the electron-phonon coupling\nconstant in the whole pressure range 0-15~GPa, consistent with the\nexperimentally observed increase in $T_c$ for the pressure range 0-4~GPa, but\ninconsistent with the drop of $T_c$ above 4~GPa and the disappearance of the\nsuperconductivity above 7~GPa, reported experimentally. The disappearance of\nsuperconductivity may be accounted for by increasing the $\\mu^{\\star}$ to 0.36\nat 7~GPa, which supports the hypothesis of the formation of a new high-pressure\nelectronic phase, which competes with the superconductivity.\n", "  We build on a previously reported frequency comb of mode spacing 0.136 nm in\na fiber ring cavity of varying normal dispersion [1], to generate, for the\nfirst time, a frequency comb of mode spacing 0.144 nm centered at 978.544 nm to\ndemonstrate the symmetry-breaking. By controlling the birefringence of the\noptical cavity through fiber stretching and polarization control, the spacing\nof the comb lines increases from 0.136 nm to 0.144 nm, and this small change in\nmode spacing generates very different spectral symmetry-breaking in the\nfrequency comb relative to the frequency comb of mode spacing 0.136 nm.\nInterestingly, non-uniform depletion of primary modes is also observed. The\nexperimental results are an important contribution in the continuing effort of\nunderstanding the dynamics of frequency combs involving large number of modes,\nnontrivial nonlinear waves and deterministic chaos.\n", "  In his Comment, Temesv\\'{a}ri objects to a remark in our paper [Phys.\\ Rev.\\\nB {\\bf 91}, 104432 (2015)] that his result for the form of the Almeida-Thouless\n(AT) line obtained in an earlier paper with Parisi [Nucl.\\ Phys.\\ B {\\bf 858},\n293 (2012)] in six dimensions can be obtained by taking the limit of $d \\to 6$\nin the equations valid for $d>6$, but that this violated one of the\ninequalities needed for their validity. He is just pointing out that they gave\na derivation of the form of the AT line in six dimensions in [Nucl.\\ Phys.\\ B\n{\\bf 858}, 293 (2012)] which avoided this difficulty. However, it is still a\nperturbative approach, and does not deal with the lack of a perturbative fixed\npoint found by Bray and Roberts [J. Phys. C {\\bf 13}, 5405 (1980)] long ago.\n", "  We study polarization squeezing of a light beam initially in the coherent\nstate using the nonlinear interaction hamiltonian $ H=k\\big(\\hat\na_{x}^{\\dagger2}+{\\hat a_{x}}^2\\big)$. For the degree of polarization\nsqueezing, we use a definition written in the final form by the authors and\nalso used in earlier papers. We find that the polarization squeezing can be\nvery high and the degree of polarization squeezing can be less than unity by a\nvery small amount. We achieve the polarization squeezing even for very low beam\nintensity under some conditions involving phase angles in the polarization\nmodes.\n", "  We present here a microscopic two-band model based on the structure of\nenergetic levels of holes in $\\mathrm{CuO}_{2}$ conducting layers of cuprates.\nWe prove that two energetically near-lying interacting bands can explain the\nelectron-hole asymmetry. Indeed, we rigorously analyze the phase diagram of the\nmodel and show that the critical temperatures for fermion densities below\nhalf-filling can manifest a very different behavior as compared to the case of\ndensities above half-filling. This fact results from the inter-band interaction\nand intra-band Coulomb repulsion in interplay with thermal fluctuations between\ntwo energetic levels. So, if the energy difference between bands is too big\nthen the asymmetry disappears. Moreover, the critical temperature turns out to\nbe a non-monotonic function of the fermion density and the phase diagram of our\nmodel shows \"superconducting domes\" as in high-$T_{c}$ cuprate superconductors.\nThis explains why the maximal critical temperature is attained at donor\ndensities away from the maximal one. Outside the superconducting phase and for\nfermion densities near half-filling the thermodynamics governed by our\nHamiltonian corresponds, as in real high-$T_c$ materials, to a Mott-insulating\nphase. The nature of the inter-band interaction can be electrostatic (screened\nCoulomb interaction), magnetic (for instance some Heisenberg-type one-site\nspin-spin interaction), or a mixture of both. If the inter-band interaction is\npredominately magnetic then - additionally to the electron-hole asymmetry - we\nobserve a reentering behavior meaning that the superconducting phase can only\noccur in a finite interval of temperatures. This phenomenon is rather rare, but\nhas also been observed in the so-called magnetic superconductors.\n", "  Understanding the crossover from quantum to classical transport phenomena has\nbecome of fundamental importance not only for technological applications due to\nthe creation of sub-10nm transistors - an important building block of our\nmodern life - but also for elucidating the role played by quantum mechanics in\nthe evolutionary fitness of biological complexes. This article provides a basic\nintroduction into the nature of charge and energy transport in the quantum and\nclassical regimes. It discusses the characteristic transport properties in both\nlimits, and demonstrates how they can be connected through the loss of quantum\nmechanical coherence. The salient features of the crossover physics are\nidentified, and their importance in opening new transport regimes and in\nunderstanding efficient and robust energy transport in biological complexes are\ndemonstrated.\n", "  There currently exist many observations which are not consistent with the\ncosmological principle. We review these observations with a particular emphasis\non those relevant for Square Kilometre Array (SKA). In particular, several\ndifferent data sets indicate a preferred direction pointing approximately\ntowards the Virgo cluster. We also observe a hemispherical anisotropy in the\nCosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR) temperature fluctuations. Although\nthese inconsistencies may be attributed to systematic effects, there remains\nthe possibility that they indicate new physics and various theories have been\nproposed to explain them. One possibility, which we discuss in this review, is\nthe generation of perturbation modes during the early pre-inflationary epoch,\nwhen the Universe may not obey the cosmological principle. Better measurements\nwill provide better constraints on these theories. In particular, we propose\nmeasurement of the dipole in number counts, sky brightness, polarized flux and\npolarization orientations of radio sources. We also suggest test of alignment\nof linear polarizations of sources as a function of their relative separation.\nFinally we propose measurement of hemispherical anisotropy or equivalently\ndipole modulation in radio sources.\n", "  Mass spectrometry and photoemission spectroscopy of a graphite hollow cathode\nsource identify the parameters of the transition from the C(3) dominated\ndischarge to the sooting plasma. The transition is a function of the shape and\nprofile of a special cusp magnetic field which is a function of radius and\nazimuth angle, the geometry of the source, the discharge current, and pressure.\nCharacteristic atomic and molecular emission lines and bands in the C(3)\ndischarge transform into broad bands emitted by the excited soot. We identify\nfour prominent emission bands between 300 to 400 nm to be the hallmark of the\nsooting plasma.\n", "  Recently the simulation of quantum field theories using man-made physical\nsystems has become realistic. In this publication we present numerical results\nwhich support the use of quantum simulation experiments to study quantum field\ntheories at non-zero chemical potential. We have numerically simulated the\n(1+1)-d $\\mathbb{C}$P(2) model, which shares several interesting features with\nQCD, namely asymptotic freedom, a dynamically generated mass gap and\ntopological sectors, via dimensional reduction of a (2+1)-d microscopic theory\nof SU(3) quantum spins. Numerical results for the particle number density as a\nfunction of chemical potential are presented.\n", "  The detection of supernova relic neutrinos could provide precious information\non the evolution of the universe, the formation of stars, the mechanism of\nsupernova bursts and the related neutrino physics. Many experiments, such as\nKamland, Borexino, Sudbury Neutrino Observatory and Super-Kamiokande have\nconducted searches for the supernova relic neutrinos. However, no supernova\nrelic neutrino signal has been observed until now. This paper reports the\nbackground study on the supernova relic neutrinos search for the future\nneutrino experiment in SuperK-Gd project. The expected event rate for various\nbackground sources and supernova relic neutrino models are calculated,\nrespectively.\n", "  We present preliminary results of the running of the coupling in SU(2) gauge\ntheory with 6 massless fundamental representation fermion flavors. We measure\nthe coupling using the gradient flow method with Schr\\\"odinger functional\nboundary conditions. The results are consistent with the perturbation theory in\nthe weak coupling and we see an indication of an infrared fixed point at strong\ncoupling.\n", "  We report the influence on the superconducting critical temperature $T_c$ in\ndoped SrTiO$_3$ of the substitution of the natural $^{16}$O atoms by the\nheavier isotope $^{18}$O. We observe that for a wide range of doping this\nsubstitution causes a strong ($\\sim 50 \\%$) enhancement of $T_c$. Also the\nmagnetic critical field $H_{c2}$ is increased by a factor $\\sim 2$. Such a\nstrong impact on $T_c$ and $H_{c2}$, with a sign opposite to conventional\nsuperconductors, is unprecedented. The observed effect could be the consequence\nof strong coupling of the doped electrons to lattice vibrations (phonons), a\nnotion which finds support in numerous optical and photo-emission studies. The\nunusually large size of the observed isotope effect supports a recent model for\nsuperconductivity in these materials based on strong coupling to the\nferroelectric soft modes of SrTiO$_{3}$.\n", "  Four fermion interactions appear in many models of Beyond Standard Model\nphysics. In Technicolour and composite Higgs models Standard Model fermion\nmasses can be generated by four fermion terms. They are also expected to modify\nthe dynamics of the new strongly interacting sector. In particular in\ntechnicolour models it has been suggested that they can be used to break\ninfrared conformality and produce a walking theory with a large mass anomalous\ndimension. We study the SU(2) gauge theory with 2 adjoint fermions and a\nchirally symmetric four fermion term. We demonstrate chiral symmetry breaking\nat large four fermion coupling and study the phase diagram of the model.\n", "  The extraction of neutrino mixing parameters and the CP-violating phase\nrequires knowledge of the neutrino energy. This energy must be reconstructed\nfrom the final state of a neutrino-nucleus reaction since all long-baseline\nexperiments use nuclear targets. This reconstruction requires detailed\nknowledge of the neutrino reactions with bound nucleons and of the final state\ninteractions of hadrons with the nuclear environment. Quantum-kinetic transport\ntheory can be used to build an event generator for this reconstruction that\ntakes basic nuclear properties, such as binding, into account. Some examples\nare discussed that show the effects of nuclear interactions on observables in\nlong-baseline experiments\n", "  Recording an album brings singers, producers, musicians, audio engineers, and\nmany other professions together. We know from the press that a few\n\"super\"-producers work with many artists. But how does the large-scale social\nstructure of the music industry look like? What is the social network behind\nthe finest albums of all time? In this paper we studied the large-scale\nstructure of music collaborations using the tools of network science. We\nconsidered all albums in Rolling Stone Magazine's list of '500 Greatest Albums\nof All Time' and the '1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die' by Robert\nDimery. We found that the existing research on collaboration networks is\ncorroborated by the particular collaboration network in the music industry.\nFurthermore, it has been found that the most important professions of the music\nindustry in terms of connectivity were main artists and engineers.\n", "  We used fluorescence spectroscopic measurements as a probe to study the\nself-healing properties of anthraquinone derivative molecules doped in\npoly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). 2,4-dibromo anthraquinone dye doped in PMMA\nrecovers after photodegradation. Its dynamics differs from other anthraquinone\nderivative molecules. This could be due to the relatively heavier bromine atom\nattached to one of the carbon atoms of the benzene ring. In this paper, we will\ndiscuss the self-healing properties of 2,4-dibromo anthraquinone doped in PMMA\nmatrix. We also tested the correlated chromophore domain model (CCrDM) and have\ncharacterized the self-healing properties by determining the CCrDM parameters.\nWe also estimated the self-absorption of fluorescence signal by the dye\nmolecule without which the analysis of the self-recovery of the molecule would\nbe incomplete.\n", "  In our original article (Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2012, 14, 60446053) a\nconvergence problem resulted in an averaging error in computing the entropy\nfrom a set of Wang-Landau Monte-Carlo simulations. Here we report corrected\nresults for the freezing temperature of the homopolymer chain as a function of\nthe range of the non-bonded interaction. We find that the previously reported\nforward-flux sampling (FFS) and brute-force (BF) simulation results are in\nagreement with the revised Wang-Landau (WL) calculations. This confirms the\nutility of FFS for computing crystallisation rates in systems of this kind.\n", "  Routing in NDN networks must scale in terms of forwarding table size and\nrouting protocol overhead. Hyperbolic routing (HR) presents a potential\nsolution to address the routing scalability problem, because it does not use\ntraditional forwarding tables or exchange routing updates upon changes in\nnetwork topologies. Although HR has the drawbacks of producing sub-optimal\nroutes or local minima for some destinations, these issues can be mitigated by\nNDN's intelligent data forwarding plane. However, HR's viability still depends\non both the quality of the routes HR provides and the overhead incurred at the\nforwarding plane due to HR's sub-optimal behavior. We designed a new forwarding\nstrategy called Adaptive Smoothed RTT-based Forwarding (ASF) to mitigate HR's\nsub-optimal path selection. This paper describes our experimental investigation\ninto the packet delivery delay and overhead under HR as compared with\nNamed-Data Link State Routing (NLSR), which calculates shortest paths. We run\nemulation experiments using various topologies with different failure\nscenarios, probing intervals, and maximum number of next hops for a name\nprefix. Our results show that HR's delay stretch has a median close to 1 and a\n95th-percentile around or below 2, which does not grow with the network size.\nHR's message overhead in dynamic topologies is nearly independent of the\nnetwork size, while NLSR's overhead grows polynomially at least. These results\nsuggest that HR offers a more scalable routing solution with little impact on\nthe optimality of routing paths.\n", "  Laplacian growth is the study of interfaces that move in proportion to\nharmonic measure. Physically, it arises in fluid flow and electrical problems\ninvolving a moving boundary. We survey progress over the last decade on\ndiscrete models of (internal) Laplacian growth, including the abelian sandpile,\ninternal DLA, rotor aggregation, and the scaling limits of these models on the\nlattice Z^d as the mesh size goes to zero. These models provide a window into\nthe tools of discrete potential theory: harmonic functions, martingales,\nobstacle problems, quadrature domains, Green functions, smoothing. We also\npresent one new result: rotor aggregation in Z^d has O(log r) fluctuations\naround a Euclidean ball, improving a previous power-law bound. We highlight\nseveral open questions, including whether these fluctuations are O(1).\n", "  In a two-dimensional electron gas, the electron-electron interaction\ngenerally becomes stronger at lower carrier densities and renormalizes the\nFermi liquid parameters such as the effective mass of carriers. We combine\nexperiment and theory to study the effective masses of electrons and holes\n$m^*_e$ and $m^*_h$ in bilayer graphene in the low carrier density regime of\norder 1 * 10^11 cm^-2. Measurements use temperature-dependent low-field\nShubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations are observed in high-mobility hexagonal\nboron nitride (h-BN) supported samples. We find that while $m^*_e$ follows a\ntight-binding description in the whole density range, $m^*_h$ starts to drop\nrapidly below the tight-binding description at carrier density n = 6 * 10^11\ncm^-2 and exhibits a strong suppression of 30% when n reaches 2 * 10^11 cm^-2.\nContributions from electron-electron interaction alone, evaluated using several\ndifferent approximations, cannot explain the experimental trend. Instead, the\neffect of potential fluctuation and the resulting electron-hole puddles play a\ncrucial role. Calculations including both the electron-electron interaction and\ndisorder effects explain the experimental data qualitatively and\nquantitatively. This study reveals an unusual disorder effect unique to\ntwo-dimensional semi-metallic systems.\n", "  Strongly noncircular outer stellar disks have been found in two unbarred SA0\ngalaxies by analyzing spectroscopic data on the rotation of stars and\nphotometric data on the shape and orientation of the isophotes. In NGC 502, the\noval distortion of the disk is manifested as two elliptical rings, the inner\nand the outer ones, covering wide radial zones between the bulge and the disk\nand at the outer edge of the stellar disk. Such a structure may be a\nconsequence of the so-called \"dry\" minor merger - multiple accretion of\ngas-free satellites. In NGC 5485, the kinematical major axis does not coincide\nwith the orientation of isophotes in the disk-dominated region, and for this\ngalaxy the conclusion about its global triaxial structure is unavoidable.\n", "  We demonstrate that efficient and nearly field-independent charge separation\nin organic planar heterojunction solar cells can be described by an incoherent\nhopping mechanism. We model the separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs\ncreated at donor-acceptor organic interfaces. By using kinetic Monte Carlo\nsimulations that include the effect of on-chain delocalization we show that\nefficient charge extraction to the electrodes requires bipolar transport and\nincreased dimensionality. This model explains experimental results of almost\nfield independent charge separation in some molecular systems and provides\nimportant guidelines at the molecular level for maximizing the efficiencies of\norganic solar cells.\n", "  A Discrete Fourier Transform Method (DFTM) for discrimination between the\nsignal of neutrons and gamma rays in organic scintillation detectors is\npresented. The method is based on the transformation of signals into the\nfrequency domain using the sine and cosine Fourier transforms in combination\nwith the discrete Fourier transform. The method is largely benefited from\nconsiderable differences that usually is available between the zero-frequency\ncomponents of sine and cosine and the norm of the amplitude of the DFT for\nneutrons and gamma-ray signals. Moreover, working in frequency domain naturally\nresults in considerable suppression of the unwanted effects of various noise\nsources that is expected to be effective in time domain methods. The proposed\nmethod could also be assumed as a generalized nonlinear weighting method that\ncould result in a new class of pulse shape discrimination methods, beyond\ndefinition of the DFT. A comparison to the traditional Charge Integration\nMethod (CIM), as well as the Frequency Gradient Analysis Method (FGAM) and the\nWavelet Packet Transform Method (WPTM) has been presented to demonstrate the\napplicability and efficiency of the method for real-world applications. The\nmethod, in general, shows better discrimination Figure of Merits (FoMs) at both\nthe low-light outputs and in average over the studied energy domain. A noise\nanalysis has been performed for all of the abovementioned methods. It reveals\nthat the frequency domain methods (FGAM and DFTM) are less sensitive to the\nnoise effects.\n", "  The use of bots as virtual confederates in online field experiments holds\nextreme promise as a new methodological tool in computational social science.\nHowever, this potential tool comes with inherent ethical challenges. Informed\nconsent can be difficult to obtain in many cases, and the use of confederates\nnecessarily implies the use of deception. In this work we outline a design\nspace for bots as virtual confederates, and we propose a set of guidelines for\nmeeting the status quo for ethical experimentation. We draw upon examples from\nprior work in the CSCW community and the broader social science literature for\nillustration. While a handful of prior researchers have used bots in online\nexperimentation, our work is meant to inspire future work in this area and\nraise awareness of the associated ethical issues.\n", "  We study the scaling properties of Higgs-Yukawa models. Using the technique\nof Finite-Size Scaling, we are able to derive scaling functions that describe\nthe observables of the model in the vicinity of a Gaussian fixed point. A\nfeasibility study of our strategy is performed for the pure scalar theory in\nthe weak-coupling regime. Choosing the on-shell renormalisation scheme gives us\nan advantage to fit the scaling functions against lattice data with only a\nsmall number of fit parameters. These formulae can be used to determine the\nuniversality of the observed phase transitions, and thus play an essential role\nin future investigations of Higgs-Yukawa models, in particular in the strong\nYukawa coupling region.\n", "  We report on the various types of Peierls like two dimensional structural\nmodulations and relative phase stability of 2H and 1T poly-types in MoS2-ReS2\nand WS2-ReS2 alloy system. Theoretical calculation predicts a polytype phase\ntransition cross over at ~50 at.% of Mo and W in ReS2 in both monolayer and\nbulk form, respectively. Experimentally, two different types of structural\nmodulations at 50% and a modulation corresponding to trimerization at 75% alloy\ncomposition is observed for MoS2-ReS2 and only one type of modulation is\nobserved at 50% WS2-ReS2 alloy system. The 50% alloy system is found to be a\nsuitable monolithic candidate for metal semiconductor transition with minute\nexternal perturbation. ReS2 is known to be in 2D Peierls distorted 1Td\nstructure and forms a chain like superstructure. Incorporation of Mo and W\natoms in the ReS2 lattice modifies the metal-metal hybridization between the\ncations and influences the structural modulation and electronic property of the\nsystem. The results offer yet another effective way to tune the electronic\nstructure and poly-type phases of this class of materials other than\nintercalation, strain, and vertical stacking arrangement.\n", "  The Akebono satellite was launched in 1989 to observe the Earth's\nmagnetosphere and plasmasphere. Omega was a navigation system with 8 ground\nstations transmitter and had transmission pattern that repeats every 10 s. From\n1989 to 1997, the PFX on board the Akebono satellite received signals at 10.2\nkHz from these stations. Huge amounts of PFX data became valuable for studying\nthe propagation characteristics of VLF waves in the ionosphere and\nplasmasphere. In this study, we introduce a method for automatic detection of\nOmega signals from the PFX data in a systematic way, it involves identifying a\ntransmission station, calculating the delay time, and estimating the signal\nintensity. We show the reliability of the automatic detection system where we\nable to detect the omega signal and confirmed its propagation to the opposite\nhemisphere along the Earth's magnetic field lines. For more than three years\n(39 months), we detected 43,734 and 111,049 signals in the magnetic and\nelectric field, respectively, and demonstrated that the proposed method is\npowerful enough for the statistical analyses.\n", "  We study polycrystalline samples of the hexagonal pnictides, CaAgP and\nCaAgAs, both of which are ideal candidates for line-node Dirac semimetals. The\npolycrystalline samples of CaAgP and CaAgAs obtained in this study are\nlow-carrier metals, where hole carriers are dominant. By combining the hole\ncarrier densities estimated from Hall coefficients and the electronic\nstructures calculated by first principles calculations, both samples are found\nto have a ring-torus Fermi surface, derived from a ring-shaped Dirac line node.\nIn the phosphide sample, the Fermi energy EF is located at around the end of\nthe linear dispersion region of the electronic bands, while the EF in the\narsenide sample exists in the middle of this region, suggesting that the\narsenide is a more promising system for uncovering the physics of line-node\nDirac semimetals.\n", "  We discuss heavy-quark dynamics in the quark-gluon plasma under a strong\nmagnetic field induced by colliding nuclei. By the use of the diagrammatic\nresummation techniques for Hard Thermal Loop and the external magnetic field,\nwe show analytic results of heavy-quark diffusion coefficient and drag force\nwhich become anisotropic due to the preferred spatial orientation in the\nmagnetic field. We argue that the anisotropic diffusion coefficient gives rise\nto an enhancement/suppression of the heavy-quark elliptic flow depending on the\ntransverse momentum.\n", "  We report the current status of $\\varepsilon_K$, the indirect CP violation\nparameter in the neutral kaon system, evaluated using the lattice QCD inputs.\nWe use lattice QCD to fix $\\hat{B}_K$, $\\xi_0$, $\\xi_2$, $|V_{us}|$,\n$m_c(m_c)$, and $|V_{cb}|$. Since Lattice 2015, FLAG updated $\\hat{B}_K$,\nexclusive $V_{cb}$ has been updated with new lattice data in the $\\bar{B}\\to\nD\\ell\\nu$ decay channel, and RBC-UKQCD has updated $\\xi_0$ and $\\xi_2$. Our\npreliminary results show that the standard model evaluation of $\\varepsilon_K$\nwith exclusive $|V_{cb}|$ (lattice QCD inputs) has $3.2\\sigma$ tension with the\nexperimental value, while that of $\\varepsilon_K$ with inclusive $|V_{cb}|$\n(heavy quark expansion) shows no tension.\n", "  The drift term appearing in an anaylitically obtained kinetic equation for a\npoint vortex system is evidenced numerically. It is revealed that the local\ntemperature in a region where the vortices are frequently transported by the\ndiffusion and the drift terms characterizes system temperature and its sign is\ndefinitely negative. Simulation results clearly show a ransport process of the\nvortices by the diffusion term (outside the clumps) and the drift term (inside\nthe clumps), which gives a key mechanism of the self-organization, i.e.,\ncondensation of the same-sign vortices.\n", "  Competing phenomena in low dimensional systems can generate exotic electronic\nphases, either through symmetry breaking or a non-trivial topology. In\ntwo-dimensional (2D) systems, the interplay between superfluidity, disorder and\nrepulsive interactions is especially fruitful in this respect although both the\nexact nature of the phases and the microscopic processes at play are still open\nquestions. In particular, in 2D, once superconductivity is destroyed by\ndisorder, an insulating ground state is expected to emerge, as a result of a\ndirect superconductor-to-insulator quantum phase transition. In such systems,\nno metallic state is theoretically expected to survive to the slightest\ndisorder. Here we map out the phase diagram of amorphous NbSi thin films as\nfunctions of disorder and film thickness, with two metallic phases in between\nthe superconducting and insulating ones. These two dissipative states, defined\nby a resistance which extrapolates to a finite value in the zero temperature\nlimit, each bear a specific dependence on disorder. We argue that they\noriginate from an inhomogeneous destruction of superconductivity, even if the\nsystem is morphologically homogeneous. Our results suggest that superconducting\nfluctuations can favor metallic states that would not otherwise exist.\n", "  We study the properties of 66 galaxies with kinematically misaligned gas and\nstars from MaNGA survey. The fraction of kinematically misaligned galaxies\nvaries with galaxy physical parameters, i.e. M*, SFR and sSFR. According to\ntheir sSFR, we further classify these 66 galaxies into three categories, 10\nstar-forming, 26 \"Green Valley\" and 30 quiescent ones. The properties of\ndifferent types of kinematically misaligned galaxies are different in that the\nstar-forming ones have positive gradient in D4000 and higher gas-phase\nmetallicity, while the green valley/quiescent ones have negative D4000\ngradients and lower gas-phase metallicity on average. There is evidence that\nall types of the kinematically misaligned galaxies tend to live in more\nisolated environment. Based on all these observational results, we propose a\nscenario for the formation of star forming galaxies with kinematically\nmisaligned gas and stars - the progenitor accretes misaligned gas from a\ngas-rich dwarf or cosmic web, the cancellation of angular momentum from gas-gas\ncollisions between the pre-existing gas and the accreted gas largely\naccelerates gas inflow, leading to fast centrally-concentrated star-formation.\nThe higher metallicity is due to enrichment from this star formation. For the\nkinematically misaligned green valley and quiescent galaxies, they might be\nformed through gas-poor progenitors accreting kinematically misaligned gas from\nsatellites which are smaller in mass.\n", "  In this paper, the problem of a two-dimensional Duffin-Petiau-Kemmer (DKP)\noscillator in the presence of a coulomb potential in the cosmic string\nbackground is solved. The eigensolutions of the problem in question have been\nfound, and the influence of the cosmic string space-time on the eigenvalues has\nbeen analyzed.\n", "  We studied the spin-flip excitations of a double-decker nickelocene molecule\n(Nc) adsorbed on Cu(100) by means of inelastic tunneling spectroscopy (IETS),\nX-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) and density functional theory\ncalculations (DFT). The results show that the molecule preserves its magnetic\nmoment and magnetic anisotropy not only on Cu(100), but also in different\nmetallic environments including the tip apex. Taking advantage of the efficient\nspin-flip excitation of this molecule, we show how such a molecular\nfunctionalized tip boosts the inelastic signal of a surface supported Nc by\nalmost one order of magnitude thanks to a double spin-excitation process.\n", "  In multi-resolution simulations, different system components are\nsimultaneously modelled at different levels of resolution, these being smoothly\ncoupled together. In the case of enzyme systems, computationally expensive\natomistic detail is needed in the active site to capture the chemistry of\nsubstrate binding. Global properties of the rest of the protein also play an\nessential role, determining the structure and fluctuations of the binding site;\nhowever, these can be modelled on a coarser level. Similarly, in the most\ncomputationally efficient scheme only the solvent hydrating the active site\nrequires atomistic detail. We present a methodology to couple atomistic and\ncoarse-grained protein models, while solvating the atomistic part of the\nprotein in atomistic water. This allows a free choice of which protein and\nsolvent degrees of freedom to include atomistically, without loss of accuracy\nin the atomistic description. This multi-resolution methodology can\nsuccessfully model stable ligand binding, and we further confirm its validity\nvia an exploration of system properties relevant to enzymatic function. In\naddition to a computational speedup, such an approach can allow the\nidentification of the essential degrees of freedom playing a role in a given\nprocess, potentially yielding new insights into biomolecular function.\n", "  Albeit the standard model is the most successful model of particles physics,\nit still has some theoretical shortcomings, for instance the hierarchy problem,\nthe absence of dark matter, etc. Supersymmetric extensions of the standard\nmodel could be a possible solution to these problems. One of the building\nblocks of these supersymmetric models are supersymmetric gauge theories. It is\nexpected that they exhibit interesting features like confinement, chiral\nsymmetry breaking, magnetic monopoles and the like. We present new results on\nN=2 Super Yang Mills theory in two dimensions. The lattice action is derived by\na dimensional reduction of the N=1 Super Yang Mills theory in four dimensions.\nBy preserving the R symmetry of the four dimensional model we can exploit Ward\nidentities to fine tune our parameters of the model to obtain the chiral and\nsupersymmetric continuum limit. This allows us to calculate the mass spectrum\nat the physical point and compare these results with effective field theories.\n", "  Aniline is an organic compound with the stoichiometric expression\n$C_{6}H_{5}NH_{2}$; consisting of a phenyl structure attached to an amino\ngroup. It is colorless, but it slowly oxidizes and resinifies in air, giving a\nred-brown tint to aged samples. Until now, there are only few researches on\nAniline considering low magnetic fields. In this work, we study Aniline\nmolecule under different high magnetic fields using density functional theory\nmethods including independent particle and interacting particle approaches. We\nobtain charge density distrubitions, energy dispersions, dipol moments and\nforces as functions of position and magnetic field. Our numerical results show\nthat magnetic field affects electron density of the considered molecule. As a\nresult, it is observed that there are strong fluctuations in energy dispersion.\n", "  Land Surface Temperature (LST) is one of the key parameters in the physics of\nland-surface processes on regional and global scales, combining the results of\nall surface-atmosphere interactions and energy fluxes between the surface and\nthe atmosphere. With the advent of the European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel 3\n(S3) satellite, accurate LST retrieval methodologies are being developed by\nexploiting the synergy between the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) and\nthe Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR). In this paper we\nexplain the implementation in the Basic ENVISAT Toolbox for (A)ATSR and MERIS\n(BEAM) and the use of one LST algorithm developed in the framework of the\nSynergistic Use of The Sentinel Missions For Estimating And Monitoring Land\nSurface Temperature (SEN4LST) project. The LST algorithm is based on the\nsplit-window technique with an explicit dependence on the surface emissivity.\nPerformance of the methodology is assessed by using MEdium Resolution Imaging\nSpectrometer/Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (MERIS/AATSR) pairs,\ninstruments with similar characteristics than OLCI/ SLSTR, respectively. The\nLST retrievals were properly validated against in situ data measured along one\nyear (2011) in three test sites, and inter-compared to the standard AATSR\nlevel-2 product with satisfactory results. The algorithm is implemented in BEAM\nusing as a basis the MERIS/AATSR Synergy Toolbox. Specific details about the\nprocessor validation can be found in the validation report of the SEN4LST\nproject.\n", "  We study a unique behavioral network data set (based on periodic surveys and\non electronic logs of dyadic contact via smartphones) collected at the\nUniversity of Notre Dame.The participants are a sample of members of the\nentering class of freshmen in the fall of 2011 whose opinions on a wide variety\nof political and social issues and activities on campus were regularly recorded\n- at the beginning and end of each semester - for the first three years of\ntheir residence on campus. We create a communication activity network implied\nby call and text data, and a friendship network based on surveys. Both networks\nare limited to students participating in the NetSense surveys. We aim at\nfinding student traits and activities on which agreements correlate well with\nformation and persistence of links while disagreements are highly correlated\nwith non-existence or dissolution of links in the two social networks that we\ncreated. Using statistical analysis and machine learning, we observe several\ntraits and activities displaying such correlations, thus being of potential use\nto predict social network evolution.\n", "  New configuration of confinement structure is utilized to improve\noptoelectronic performances, including threshold current, AC current gain as\nwell as optical bandwidth and optical output power of single quantum well\ntransistor laser. Considering the drift component in addition to the diffusion\nterm in electron current density, a new continuity equation is developed to\nanalyze the proposed structures. Physical parameters including, electron\nmobility, recombination lifetime, optical confinement factor, electron capture\ntime and photon lifetime is calculated for new structures. Based on solving\ncontinuity equation in separate confinement heterostructures, threshold current\nreduces 67% and optical output power increases 37%.\n", "  These notes provide an introduction to recent work by Kevin Costello in which\nintegrable lattice models of classical statistical mechanics in two dimensions\nare understood in terms of quantum gauge theory in four dimensions. This\nconstruction will be compared to the more familiar relationship between quantum\nknot invariants in three dimensions and Chern-Simons gauge theory. (Based on a\nWhittaker Colloquium at the University of Edinburgh and a lecture at Strings\n2016 in Beijing.)\n", "  Developing an Enhanced Geothermal System, otherwise known as EGS, is a\ncomplex process and is dependent on range of geological and operating\nvariables. Stresses in and around EGS are believed to be either sound and\nnon-harming or violent and catastrophic among different groups involved,\ndirectly or indirectly, in EGS. Pros and cons of EGS have been under discussion\nand research for a while now. This paper addresses issues associated with\nstress redistribution during and after working cycle of EGS and gives a new\ninsight in understanding the behavior of stresses redistribution in and around\nbasement rock. As the basement rock is thermo-elastically connected to the\ncountry rock, newly generated stresses interact with the existing in-situ\nstresses under prevailing conditions of geological, design and operating\nvariables. Variables dictating the continuous, safe and efficient working of\nEGS are also outlined in detailed sections. Guidelines for future of the\nresearch related to stress redistribution in EGS are also part of this paper.\n", "  With the availability of large integral-field unit (IFU) spectral surveys of\nnearby galaxies, there is now the potential to extract spectral information\nfrom across the bulges and discs of galaxies in a systematic way. This\ninformation can address questions such as how these components built up with\ntime, how galaxies evolve and whether their evolution depends on other\nproperties of the galaxy such as its mass or environment. We present BUDDI, a\nnew approach to fit the two-dimensional light profiles of galaxies as a\nfunction of wavelength to extract the spectral properties of these galaxies'\ndiscs and bulges. The fitting is carried out using GalfitM, a modified form of\nGalfit which can fit multi-waveband images simultaneously. The benefit of this\ntechnique over traditional multi-waveband fits is that the stellar populations\nof each component can be constrained using knowledge over the whole image and\nspectrum available. The decomposition has been developed using commissioning\ndata from the SDSS-IV Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA) survey with\nredshifts z<0.14 and coverage of at least 1.5 effective radii for a spatial\nresolution of 2.5 arcsec FWHM and field of view of >22 arcsec, but can be\napplied to any IFU data of a nearby galaxy with similar or better spatial\nresolution and coverage. We present an overview of the fitting process, the\nresults from our tests, and we finish with example stellar population analyses\nof early-type galaxies from the MaNGA survey to give an indication of the\nscientific potential of applying bulge-disc decomposition to IFU data.\n", "  Structure, function and dynamics of many biomolecular systems can be\ncharacterized by the energetic variational principle and the corresponding\nsystems of partial differential equations (PDEs). This principle allows us to\nfocus on the identification of essential energetic components, the optimal\nparametrization of energies, and the efficient computational implementation of\nenergy variation or minimization. Given the fact that complex biomolecular\nsystems are structurally non-uniform and their interactions occur through\ncontact interfaces, their free energies are associated with various interfaces\nas well, such as solute-solvent interface, molecular binding interface, lipid\ndomain interface, and membrane surfaces. This fact motivates the inclusion of\ninterface geometry, particular its curvatures, to the parametrization of free\nenergies. Applications of such interface geometry based energetic variational\nprinciples are illustrated through three concrete topics: the multiscale\nmodeling of biomolecular electrostatics and solvation that includes the\ncurvature energy of the molecular surface, the formation of microdomains on\nlipid membrane due to the geometric and molecular mechanics at the lipid\ninterface, and the mean curvature driven protein localization on membrane\nsurfaces. By further implicitly representing the interface using a phase field\nfunction over the entire domain, one can simulate the dynamics of the interface\nand the corresponding energy variation by evolving the phase field function,\nachieving significant reduction of the number of degrees of freedom and\ncomputational complexity. Strategies for improving the efficiency of\ncomputational implementations and for extending applications to coarse-graining\nor multiscale molecular simulations are outlined.\n", "  In the past the analyses of inelastic p+p collision for example in terms of\nthe hadron gas model have assumed that always both protons participate in the\ninteraction. In this article we show that (at sqrt(s) = 17.3 GeV ) on average\nonly 1,89 protons are interacting. Measurements of the mean multiplicities of\nprotons, neutrons, charged pions, charged kaons and {\\Lambda} hyperons allow to\ncompute the number of initial state nucleons using conservation of baryon\nnumber, strangeness, and isospin. We further argue that once the number of\ninitial state nucleons is given and the mean multiplicities of protons and\ncharged pions are known in p+p interactions at center-of-mass energies below a\nfew tens of GeV, the yields of net neutrons, kaons, and hyperons can be\nestimated with a precision of a few percent using again baryon and isospin\nconservation.\n", "  The convex hull on three points in two dimensional euclidean space of three\nflat edges (trihedron) was studied. The Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization of the\narea of space is performed. It is shown that it reproduces exactly the\nequidistant spacing spectrum found elsewhere.\n", "  A formula expressing the fermionic determinant (a large order polynomial) as\nan infinite product of smaller determinants is derived and discussed. These\nsmaller determinants are of a fixed size, independent of the size of the\nlattice and are indexed by loops of increasing length.\n", "  The analysis of the dynamics of delays propagation is one of the major topics\ninside Air Transport Management research. Delays are generated by the elements\nof the system, but their propagation is a global process fostered by\nrelationships inside the network. If the topology of such propagation process\nhas been extensively studied in the literature, little attention has been\ndevoted to the fact that such topology may have a dynamical nature. Here we\ndifferentiate between two phases of the system by applying two causality\nmetrics, respectively describing the standard phase (i.e. propagation of normal\ndelays) and a disrupted one (corresponding to abnormal and unexpected delays).\nWe identify the critical point triggering the change of the topology of the\nsystem, in terms of delays magnitude, using a historical data set of flights\ncrossing Europe in 2011. We anticipate that the proposed results will open new\ndoors towards the understanding of the delay propagation dynamics and the\nmitigation of extreme events.\n", "  We present an experimental study of the microwave power and the linear\npolarization angle dependence of the microwave-induced magnetoresistance\noscillations in the high-mobility GaAs/AlGaAs two-dimensional electron system.\nExperimental results show the sinusoidal dependence of the oscillatory\nmagnetoresistance extrema as a function of the polarization angle. Yet, as the\nmicrowave power increases, the angular dependence includes additional harmonic\ncontent, and it begins to resemble the absolute value of the cosine function.\nWe present a theory to explain such peculiar behavior.\n", "  We define double principal bundles (DPBs), for which the frame bundle of a\ndouble vector bundle, double Lie groups and double homogeneous spaces are basic\nexamples. It is shown that a double vector bundle can be realized as the\nassociated bundle of its frame bundle. Also dual structures, gauge\ntransformations and connections in DPBs are investigated.\n", "  We propose a set of silicon reflective transmission filters for\nlight-recycling displays that are compatible with high-throughput\nnanofabrication technologies and have excellent angular stability.\n", "  Membrane proteins deform the surrounding lipid bilayer, which can lead to\nmembrane-mediated interactions between neighboring proteins. Using the\nmechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) as a model system, we\ndemonstrate how the observed differences in protein structure can affect\nmembrane-mediated interactions and cooperativity among membrane proteins. We\nfind that distinct oligomeric states of MscL lead to distinct gateway states\nfor the clustering of MscL, and predict signatures of MscL structure and\nspatial organization in the cooperative gating of MscL. Our modeling approach\nestablishes a quantitative relation between the observed shapes and cooperative\nfunction of membrane~proteins.\n", "  We present our results obtained from gauge cooled complex Langevin\nsimulations in 1+1d QCD at non-zero densities in the strong coupling regime\nwith unrooted staggered fermions. For small quark masses there are regions of\nthe chemical potential where this method fails to reproduce correct results. In\nthese parameter ranges we studied the effect of different gauge cooling schemes\non the distributions of the fermion determinant as well as of observables.\n", "  The current state of the art for large-scale quantum-mechanical simulations\nis the planewave (PW) pseudopotential method, as implemented in codes such as\nVASP, ABINIT, and many others. However, since the PW method uses a global\nFourier basis, with strictly uniform resolution at all points in space, it\nsuffers from substantial inefficiencies in calculations involving atoms with\nlocalized states, such as first-row and transition-metal atoms, and requires\nsignificant nonlocal communications, which limit parallel efficiency.\nReal-space methods such as finite-differences and finite-elements have\npartially addressed both resolution and parallel-communications issues but have\nbeen plagued by one key disadvantage relative to PW: excessive number of\ndegrees of freedom needed to achieve the required accuracies. We present a\nreal-space partition of unity finite element (PUFE) method to solve the\nKohn-Sham equations of density functional theory. In the PUFE method, we build\nthe known atomic physics into the solution process using partition-of-unity\nenrichment techniques in finite element analysis. The method developed herein\nis completely general, applicable to metals and insulators alike, and\nparticularly efficient for deep, localized potentials, as occur in calculations\nat extreme conditions of pressure and temperature. Full self-consistent\nKohn-Sham calculations are presented for LiH, involving light atoms, and CeAl,\ninvolving heavy atoms with large numbers of atomic-orbital enrichments. We find\nthat the new PUFE approach attains the required accuracies with substantially\nfewer degrees of freedom, typically by an order of magnitude or more, than the\nPW method. We compute the equation of state of LiH and show that the computed\nlattice constant and bulk modulus are in excellent agreement with reference PW\nresults, while requiring an order of magnitude fewer degrees of freedom to\nobtain.\n", "  This work summarizes a series of studies on two-dimensional granular impact,\nwhere an intruding object strikes a granular material at high speed. Many\nprevious studies on granular impact have used a macroscopic force law, which is\ndominated by an inertial drag term proportional to the intruder velocity\nsquared. The primary focus here is on the microscopic force response of the\ngranular material, and how the grain-scale effects give rise to this inertial\ndrag term. We show that the inertial drag arises from intermittent collisions\nwith force-chain-like structures. We construct a simple collisional model to\nexplain the inertial drag, as well as off-axis instability and rotations.\nFinally, we show how the granular response changes when the intruder speed\napproaches $d/t_c$, leading to a failure of the inertial drag description in\nthis regime. Here, $d$ is the mean particle diameter and $t_c$ the\ncharacteristic momentum-transfer time between two grains.\n", "  Artificial spin ices were originally introduced as analogs of the pyrochlore\nspin ices, but have since become a much richer field . The original attraction\nof building nanotechnological analogs of the pyrochlores were threefold: to\nallow room temperature studies of geometrical frustration; to provide model\nstatistical mechanical systems where all the relevant parameters in an\nexperiment can be tuned by design; and to be able to examine the exact\nmicrostate of those systems using advanced magnetic microscopy methods. From\nthis beginning the field has grown to encompass studies of the effects of\nquenched disorder, thermally activated dynamics, microwave frequency responses,\nmagnetotransport properties, and the development of lattice geometries--with\nrelated emergent physics---that have no analog in naturally-occurring\ncrystalline systems. The field also offers the prospect of contributing to\nnovel magnetic logic devices, since the arrays of nanoislands that form\nartificial spin ices are similar in many respects to those that are used in the\ndevelopment of magnetic quantum cellular automata. In this chapter, I review\nthe experimental aspects of this story, complementing the theoretical chapter\nby Gia-Wei Chern.\n", "  The LSST data management science pipelines software consists of more than\n100,000 lines of Python 2 code. LSST operations will begin after support for\nPython 2 has been dropped by the Python community in 2020, and we must\ntherefore plan to migrate the codebase to Python 3. During the transition\nperiod we must also support our community of active Python 2 users and this\ncomplicates the porting significantly. We have decided to use the Python future\npackage as the basis for our port to enable support for Python 2 and Python 3\nsimultaneously, whilst developing with a mindset more suited to Python 3. In\nthis paper we report on the current status of the port and the difficulties\nthat have been encountered.\n", "  We study the out of equilibrium dynamics of inflationary phase transitions\nand compute the resulting spectrum of metric perturbations relevant to\nobservation. We show that simple single field models of inflation may produce\nan adiabatic perturbation spectrum with a blue spectral tilt and that the\nprecise spectrum depends on initial conditions at the outset of inflation.\n", "  It is emphasized that the existence of a very light axion is consistent with\nthe strong CP invariance and cosmological and astrophysical constraints. The\nattempt to embed the very light axion in superstring models is discussed.\n", "  For a universe presently dominated by static or dynamic vacuum energy,\ncosmological constant (LCDM) or quintessence (QCDM), we calculate the\nasymptotic collapsed mass fraction as function of the present ratio of vacuum\nenergy to clustered mass, \\Omega_{Q0}/\\Omega_{m0}. Identifying these collapsed\nfractions as anthropic probabilities, we find the value \\Omega_{Q0}/\\Omega_{m0}\n\\sim 2 to be reasonably likely in LCDM, and very likely in QCDM.\n", "  We describe the observable features of the recently proposed Extended\nQuintessence scenarios on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropy\nspectra. In this class of models a scalar field $\\phi$, assumed to provide most\nof the cosmic energy density today, is non-minimally coupled to the Ricci\ncurvature scalar $R$. We implement the linear theory of cosmological\nperturbations in scalar tensor gravitational theories to compute CMB\ntemperature and polarization spectra. All the interesting spectral features are\naffected: on sub-degree angular scales, the acoustic peaks change both in\namplitude and position; on larger scales the low redshift dynamics enhances the\nIntegrated Sachs Wolfe effect. These results show how the future CMB\nexperiments could give information on the vacuum energy as well as on the\nstructure of the gravitational Lagrangian term.\n", "  In this talk, I review a number of particle-physics models that lead to the\ncreation of magnetic fields in the early universe and address the complex\nproblem of evolving such primordial magnetic fields into the fields observed\ntoday. Implications for future observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background\n(CMB) are discussed. Focussing on first-order phase transitions in the early\nuniverse, I describe how magnetic fields arise in the collision of expanding\ntrue-vacuum bubbles both in Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theories.\n", "  Cosmic ray antiprotons have been detected for over 20 years and are now\nmeasured reliably. Standard particle and astrophysics predict a conventional\nspectrum and abundance of secondary antiprotons consistent with all current\nmeasurements. These measurements place limits on exotic Galactic antiproton\nsources and non-standard antiproton properties. Complications arise,\nparticularly at low energies, with heliospheric modulation of cosmic ray fluxes\nand production of standard secondaries from A > 1 nuclear targets. Future\nexperiments and theoretical developments are discussed.\n", "  There appear to be three challenges that any theory of dark matter must face:\n(i) why is $\\Omega_{DM}$ of the same order as $\\Omega_{Baryons}$ ? (ii) what\nare the near solar mass objects ($\\sim 0.5 M_{\\odot}$) observed by the MACHO\nmicrolensing project ? and (iii) understanding the shallow core density profile\nof the halos of dwarf as well as low surface brightness galaxies. The popular\ncold dark matter candidates, the SUSY LSP and the axion fail to meet these\nchallenges. We argue that in the mirror model suggested recently to explain the\nneutrino anomalies, the mirror baryons being 15-20 times heavier than familiar\nbaryons, can play the role of the cold dark matter and provide reasonable\nexplanation of all three above properties without extra assumptions.\n", "  In a model recently proposed by Albrecht and Skordis it was suggested that\nthe observed accelerated expansion of the universe could be caused by a scalar\nfield which is trapped in a local minimum of an exponential potential modified\nby a polynomial prefactor. We show that scalar field cosmologies with this kind\nof local minimum in the potential are stable and do not decay to the true\nvacuum if they fulfill the observational constraints from the Type Ia\nSupernovae experiments. Further we briefly sketch how this potential could be\nrelated to a potential of interacting D-branes.\n", "  I review a number of particle-physics models that lead to the creation of\nmagnetic fields in the early universe and address the complex problem of\nevolving such primordial magnetic fields into the fields observed today.\nImplications for future observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)\nare briefly discussed.\n", "  The properties of nearby galaxy clusters limit the range of cosmological\nparameters consistent with our universe. We describe the limits which arise\nfrom studies of the intracluster medium (ICM) mass fraction fICM and\nconsideration of the possible sources of systematic error:\nOmega_M<0.44h_{50}^{-1/2} at 95% confidence. We emphasize that independent of\nType Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) observations, this cluster study, taken together\nwith published cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy studies, indicates\na non-zero quintessence or dark energy component Omega_Q>0.\n  We then discuss future galaxy cluster surveys which will probe the abundance\nof galaxy clusters to intermediate and high redshift. We investigate the\nsensitivity of these surveys to the cosmological density parameter Omega_M and\nthe equation of state parameter w of any quintessence component. In particular,\nwe show that cluster survey constraints from a proposed large solid angle X-ray\nsurvey are comparable in precision and complementary in nature to constraints\nexpected from future CMB anisotropy and SNe Ia studies.\n", "  The late infall of cold dark matter onto an isolated galaxy such as our own\nproduces flows with definite velocity vectors at any physical point in the\ngalactic halo. It also produces caustics which are places where the dark matter\ndensity is very large. The outer caustics are topological spheres whereas the\ninner caustics are rings. The self-similar model of galactic halo formation\npredicts that the caustic ring radii $a_n$ follow the approximate law $a_n \\sim\n1/n$. In a recent study of 32 extended and well-measured galactic rotation\ncurves, we found evidence for this law.\n", "  Analysed in the framework of homogeneous FLRW models, the magnitude-redshift\ndata from high redshift supernovae yield, as a primary result, a strictly\npositive cosmological constant. Another reading of the currently published\nmeasurements does not exclude a possible ruling out of the Cosmological\nPrinciple and, thus, also, of the cosmological constant hypothesis. It is shown\nhow shortly coming data can be used to settle this fondamental issue,\npertaining to both cosmology and particle physics.\n", "  We investigate the possibility that electromagnetic fluctuations are\namplified in expanding universe by parametric resonance, during the oscillatory\nregime of a scalar field to which they are coupled. We consider scalar\nelectrodynamics and we find that electromagnetic fluctuations undergo\nexponential instabilities. This mechanism could have some relevance for the\nproblem of large scale primordial magnetic fields.\n", "  GLAST, a detector for cosmic gamma rays in the range from 20 MeV to 300 GeV,\nwill be launched in space in 2005. Breakthroughs are expected in particular in\nthe study of particle acceleration mechanisms in space and of gamma ray bursts,\nand maybe on the search for cold dark matter; but of course the most exciting\ndiscoveries could come from the unexpected.\n", "  Active Galactic Nuclei are fueled from material (gas or stars) that are in\ngeneral far away from the gravitational influence of the central black hole,\nthe engine thought to be responsible for their activity. The required material\nhas a lot of angular momentum, that is a priori quite difficult to evacuate.\nThe various dynamical mechanisms that may play a role in this game are\nreviewed, including m=2 perturbations (bars and spirals), m=1 perturbations\n(spirals, warps, lopsidedness), and tidal interactions between galaxies and\nmergers. In the latest stages of the merger, a binary black hole could be\nformed, and its influence on the dynamics and fueling is discussed. Starbursts\nare often associated with AGN, and the nature of their particular connection,\nand their role in the nuclear fueling is described. Evolution of the fueling\nefficiency with redshift is addressed.\n", "  We investigate the possibility that ultra high energy cosmic rays (E > 10^19\neV) are related to the distribution of matter on large scales. The large scale\nstructure (LSS) data stems from the recent IRAS PSCz redshift survey. We\npresent preliminary predictions drawn from an anisotropic distribution of\nsources which follows the galaxy distribution.\n", "  MACHe3 (MAtrix of Cells of superfluid He3) is a project of a new detector for\ndirect Dark Matter Search. The idea is to use superfluid He3 as a sensitive\nmedium. The existing device, the superfluid He3 cell, will be briefly\nintroduced. Then a description of the MACHe3 project will be presented, in\nparticular the background rejection and the neutralino event rate that may be\nachieved with such a device.\n", "  We generalize the spherical collapse model for the formation of dark matter\nhalos to apply in a universe with arbitrary positive cosmological constant. We\ncalculate the critical condition for collapse of an overdense region and give\nexact values of the characteristic densities and redshifts of its evolution.\n", "  A massive black hole is present at the centre of our galaxy and inevitably\naccretes dark matter particles, creating a region of very high particle\ndensity. The annihilation rate is enhanced with a large number of e+e- pairs\nproduced either directly or by successive decays of mesons. We evaluate the\nsynchrotron emission (and self-absorption) associated with the propagation of\nthese particles through the galactic magnetic field and give constraints on the\nvalues of mass and cross section of the dark matter particles.\n", "  Some of the arguments which support the strong concensus for an $\\Omega_o$ =\n0.3, $\\lambda_o$ = 0.7 model are reexamined. Corrections for Malmquist bias,\nlocal flow and metallicity suggest a revised value for $H_o$ of 63 $\\pm$ 6\nkm/s/Mpc, improving the age problems for an $\\Omega_o$ = 1 universe. The latest\nCMB results may require a high baryon density and hence new physics, for\nexample a strong lepton asymmetry. Difficulties for the $\\Omega_o$ = 1 model\nwith cluster evolution, the baryon content of clusters, and the evidence from\nType Ia supernovae favouring low $\\Omega_o$, $\\Lambda > 0$ models, are\ndiscussed critically.\n", "  Clusters of galaxies are strong emitters of EUV and soft X-rays substantially\nin excess of the contribution from the hot intra-cluster medium at X-ray\ntemperatures. After the initial discovery of EUV excess emission in the Virgo\ncluster, the phenomenon was reported also for the Coma, A1795 and A2199\nclusters. Recent reobservations confirmed the finding, and further searches on\na large sample of nearby galaxy clusters are clearly revealing the cosmological\nimpact of the discovery.\n", "  We have studied the effects on the gamma-ray flux on Earth by neutralino\nannihilations in caustic rings of dark matter in the Galactic halo. The caustic\nring model by Sikivie has been used where dark matter particles are assumed to\npossess angular momentum with respect to the Galactic centre. The computer code\nDarkSUSY was then used to examine the supersymmetric implications on the flux.\nWe conclude that a small signal might be detectable under very optimistic\nassumptions, but under these only.\n", "  The question of the nature of the dark matter in the Universe remains one of\nthe most outstanding unsolved problems in basic science. One of the best\nmotivated particle physics candidates is the lightest supersymmetric particle,\nassumed to be the lightest neutralino. We here describe DarkSUSY, an advanced\nnumerical FORTRAN package for supersymmetric dark matter calculations which we\nrelease for public use. With the help of this package, the masses and\ncompositions of various supersymmetric particles can be computed, for given\ninput parameters of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model\n(MSSM). For the lightest neutralino, the relic density is computed, using\naccurate methods which include the effects of resonances, pair production\nthresholds and coannihilations. Accelerator bounds are checked to identify\nviable dark matter candidates. Finally, detection rates are computed for a\nvariety of detection methods, such as direct detection and indirect detection\nthrough antiprotons, gamma-rays and positrons from the Galactic halo or\nneutrinos from the center of the Earth or the Sun.\n", "  A new Solar System population of Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP)\ndark matter has been proposed to exist. We investigate the implications of this\npopulation on indirect signals in neutrino telescopes (due to WIMP\nannihilations in the Earth) for the case when the WIMP is the lightest\nneutralino of the MSSM, the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard\nmodel. The velocity distribution and capture rate of this new population is\nevaluated and the flux of neutrino-induced muons from the center of the Earth\nin neutrino telescopes is calculated. We show that the effects of the new\npopulation can be crucial for masses around 60-120 GeV, where enhancements of\nthe predicted muon flux from the center of the Earth by up to a factor of 100\ncompared to previously published estimates occur. As a result of the new WIMP\npopulation, neutrino telescopes should be able to probe a much larger region of\nparameter space in this mass range.\n", "  We have searched for axions which could have been produced in the solar core\nusing an axion helioscope with a 2.3m-long 4T superconducting magnet. Axion\nmass region up to m_a=0.26eV was newly explored by introducing\ndispersion-matching gas. Preliminary analysis sets a limit on axion-photon\ncoupling constant to be less than (6.4--9.6)e-10 GeV^{-1} (95%CL) for this mass\nregion from the absence of the axion signal. This is more stringent than the\nlimit inferred from the solar age consideration and also more stringent than\nthe recent helioseismological bound.\n", "  This paper summarizes a project designed to study abundances in a sample of\nplanetary nebulae representing a broad range in progenitor mass and\nmetallicity. We collect abundances of C, N, and O determined for the entire\nsample and compare them with theoretical predictions of planetary nebula\nabundances from a grid of intermediate-mass star models. We find very good\nagreement between observations and theory, lending strong support to our\ncurrent understanding of nucleosynthesis in stars with progenitor masses below\n8 solar masses. This agreement between observation and theory also supports the\nvalidity of published stellar yields of C and N in the study of the abundance\nevolution of these two elements.\n", "  SIMPLE (Superheated Instrument for Massive ParticLE searches) employs\nsuperheated droplet detectors (SDDs) to search for Weakly Interacting Massive\nParticle (WIMP) dark matter. As a result of the intrinsic SDD insensitivity to\nminimum ionizing particles and high fluorine content of target liquids,\ncompetitive WIMP limits were already obtained at the early prototype stage. We\ncomment here on the expected immediate increase in sensitivity of the program\nand on future plans to exploit this promising technnique.\n", "  The UV-X continuum, the X-ray spectral features, and the variability in these\nbands provide powerful tools for studying the innermost regions of AGNs from\nwhich we gain an insight into the accretion process. In this chapter the\ndiscussion focusses on luminous AGN, i.e. Seyfert galaxies and quasars. The\nstandard accretion disk model (a stationary geometrically thin disk) is\ndescribed, and vertically averaged solutions for the radial structure are\ngiven. The emission of the standard disk is discussed using different\napproximations, and it is compared to the observations. This leads to the\nconclusion that more complex models are required, such as the irradiated disk\nand the disk-corona models. The advantage of this last model is that it\nexplains the overall UV-X spectral distribution. In the framework of these disk\nmodels, the profile, intensity, and variability properties of the X-ray iron\nline can be explained by reprocessing at the surface of the cold disk very\nclose to the black hole (the \"relativistic disk model\"). An alternative\npossibility is discussed, where the UV-X continuum is produced by a\nquasi-spherical distribution of dense clouds surrounded by (or embedded in) a\nhot medium. In such a model the iron line profile could be due to\nComptonization instead of relativistic effects.\n", "  Preliminary results obtained with 320g bolometers with simultaneous\nionization and heat measurements are described. After a few weeks of data\ntaking, data accumulated with one of these detectors are beginning to exclude\nthe upper part of the DAMA region. Prospects for the present run and the second\nstage of the experiment, EDELWEISS-II, using an innovative reversed cryostat\nallowing data taking with 100 detectors, are briefly described.\n", "  The cosmological evolution of neutral hydrogen is an efficient way of tracing\nstructure formation with redshift. It indicates the rate of evolution of gas\ninto stars and hence the gas consumption and rate star formation history of the\nUniverse. In measuring HI, quasar absorbers have proven to be an ideal tool and\nwe use observations from a recent survey for high-redshift quasar absorption\nsystems together with data gathered from the literature to measure the\ncosmological comoving mass density of neutral gas. This paper assumes\nOmega_M=0.3, Omega_lambda=0.7 and h=0.65.\n", "  We adopt up-to-date 7Li yields from asymptotic giant branch stars in order to\nstudy the temporal evolution of this element in the solar neighbourhood.\nSeveral lithium stellar sources are considered besides the AGBs: Type II\nsupernovae, novae, low-mass giants. Galactic cosmic ray nucleosynthesis is\ntaken into account as well. We conclude that AGB stars do not substantially\ncontribute to 7Li enrichment on a Galactic scale. Therefore, a significant 7Li\nproduction from novae and low-mass stars is needed to explain the late, steep\nrise of the 7Li abundance in disk stars and the meteoritic 7Li abundance.\n", "  In this paper we present some results concerning the study of the development\nof galactic winds in blue compact galaxies. In particular, we model a situation\nvery similar to that of the galaxy IZw18, the most metal poor and unevolved\ngalaxy known locally. To do that we compute the chemo-dynamical evolution of a\ngalaxy in the case of one istantaneous isolated starburst as well as in the\ncase of two successive instantaneous starbursts. We show that in both cases a\nmetal enriched wind develops and that the metals produced by the type Ia SNe\nare lost more efficiently than those produced by type II SNe. We also find that\none single burst is able to enrich chemically the surrounding region in few\nMyr. Both these results are the effect of the assumed efficiency of energy\ntransfer from SNe to ISM and to the consideration of type Ia SNe in this kind\nof problem. The comparison with observed abundances of IZw18 suggests that this\ngalaxy is likely to have suffered two bursts in its life, with the previous\nbeing less intense than the last one.\n", "  We update the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) calculations on the basis of the\nrecent NACRE compilation of reaction rates. In particular, we calculate the\nuncertainties related to the nuclear reaction rates on the abundances of 7Li\nand compare our results with an other recent analysis.\n", "  We review the main sources of LiBeB production and show that a primary\nmechanism is at work in the early Galaxy involving both ejection and\nacceleration of He, C and O at moderate energy, which by nuclear interaction\nwith\n  H and He produce light isotopes. The precise measurement of the Be abundance\nat [Fe/H] = -3.3 and of $^6Li$ in halo stars find an explanation in this\nframework. Thus, the preservation of $^6Li$ in the atmosphere of metal poor\nstars implied, points toward the fact the Spite plateau reflects the primordial\nvalue of Li. Consequently, it can be used as a baryodensitometer.\n", "  At present, there are several feasible observational probes of the first\nstars in the universe. Here, we examine the constraints on early stellar\nactivity from the metallicity of the high-redshift Ly-$\\alpha$ clouds, from the\neffects of stellar ionizing photons on reionization and the cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB), and from the implications of gravitational microlensing\nresults for the presence of stellar remnants in galactic halos. We also discuss\nwhether the above signatures are consistent with each other, i.e., if they\nreflect the same population of stars.\n", "  A general review of the relevance of classical novae for the chemical\nevolution of the Galaxy, as well as for Galactic radioactivity is presented. A\nspecial emphasis is put on the pioneering work done by Jim Truran in this field\nof research. The impact of recent developments in nuclear astrophysics on nova\nnucleosynthesis, together with the prospects for observability of novae\nradioactivities with the INTEGRAL satellite are discussed.\n", "  Thin and Thick disk metallicities overlap, but alpha(Fe) relations differ;\nthere is also a hiatus in time before the first thin-disk stars, with a minimum\nmetallicity [Fe/H] = -0.6. Thus there are two `G-dwarf' problems. We fit\nmetallicity distribution functions (MDFs) for the two disks derived by Wyse &\nGilmore (1995) with analytical models (for O and Mg). The Thick disk fits a\nsimple inflow model with effective yield and final [Mg/H] about the same as for\nthe Thin Disk, excluding continuous mass loss from the former as a source of\nprompt initial enrichment (PIE) for the latter. The Thin disk has a narrow MDF\nfitted (rather poorly) with a closed model having PIE from some other source,\nor more elegantly with a slow infall model similar to the `two-inflow' scenario\nof Matteucci et al., but with a PIE and a severe break in the age-metallicity\nrelation. Implications for radio-active cosmochronology are investigated.\n", "  A review is presented of the p-process in Type II supernovae, one of its\ngoals being to enlighten the changes in views on this nucleosynthesis mechanism\nsince the work of Jean and Jim on the subject in 1975. Specific discussions are\nalso devoted to cases of particular interest, like the light Mo and Ru stable\nisotopes, the rare nuclide 138La or the radionuclide 146Sm. Some comments of\ndiverse natures are also made on the r-process. These considerations do not aim\nat really providing an exhaustive review of the many nuclear physics and\nastrophysics intricacies of this process. In contrast, they are hoped to\ncomplement or to put in perspective other views that are often expressed in\nrelation with this nucleosynthesis mechanism\n", "  The 8m class telescopes allow for the first time to study stars of external\ngalaxies with the same resolution and S/N ratio which has been so far used for\nGalactic stars. It is quite likely that this study will shake some of our\ncurrent beliefs. In this poster we highlight some of the results which have\nbeen obtained for two giants in the Sgr dSph thanks to the UVES spectrograph on\nthe ESO 8.2m Kueyen telescope. Further details on the observations and data\nanalysis may be found in Bonifacio et al (2000).\n", "  UVES observations at ESO/VLT of the DLA at z=3.39 towards QSO 0000-2621\nprovided refined abundances for Fe, Si, N, Ni, and new abundances for O, Ar, P,\nZn, Cr, H2. These determinations confirm that the system has remarkable\nproperties with the lowest metallicity, a very low H2 molecular fraction and it\nhas no detectable presence of dust. The [alpha/Fe-peak] ratio is ~ 0.1\nchallenging current models of chemical evolution. The O/Ar and O/S ratios are\nthe same as those observed in BCGs, suggesting a universal IMF.\n", "  We discuss the highlights of our recent research, specifically the refractory\nvs. volatile interpretation of the rise of [O/Fe] with decreasing [Fe/H], and\nthe issue of primary vs. secondary evolution of Be.\n", "  Observations of metal-poor Galactic halo stars indicate that the abundance\npattern of the (heaviest) neutron-capture elements is consistent with the\nscaled solar system r-process abundances. Utilizing the radioactive (r-process)\nelement thorium, age determinations have been made for several of these same\nstars, placing constraints on both Galactic and cosmological age estimates.\n", "  In a brief review of abundances neutron-capture elements (Z > ~30) in\nmetal-poor halo stars, attention is called to their star-to-star scatter, the\ndominance of r-process synthesis at lowest metallicities, the puzzle of the\nlighter members of this element group, and the possibility of a better\nr-/s-process discriminant.\n", "  We examine the characteristics of nucleosynthesis in 'hypernovae', i.e.,\nsupernovae with very large explosion energies ($\\gsim 10^{52}$ ergs).\nImplications for the cosmic chemical evolution and the abundances in M82 are\ndiscussed.\n", "  A LiBeB evolution model including Galactic Cosmic Ray nucleosynthesis, the\n$\\nu$-process, novae, AGB and C-stars is presented. We have included Galactic\nCosmic Ray Nucleosynthesis (GCRN) in a complete Chemical Evolution Model that\ntakes into account 76 stable isotopes from hydrogen to zinc. Any successful\nLiBeB evolution model should also be compatible with other observational\nconstraints like the age-metallicity relation, the G-dwarf distribution or the\nevolution of other elements. At the same time, we have checked how different\nwould be a model that took into account the last observations by Wakker et al.\n(1999) of metal-enriched clouds falling onto the disk, from a primordial infall\nmodel.\n", "  Unhappily, there has been a maelstrom of problems for dark matter theories\nover the last few years and many serious difficulties still have no resolution\nin sight. This article reviews the evidence for dark matter in galaxies. The\nhaloes built up by hierarchical merging in dark matter cosmogonies are cusped\nand dominated by dark matter at the center. Evidence from the microlensing\noptical depth towards Baade's Window and from dynamical modelling of the\nGalactic bar already suggests that the Galactic halo is not cusped. Similarly,\nevidence from the stability of unbarred disk galaxies, as well as the survival\nof fast bars in barred galaxies, suggests that the this result holds good more\ngenerally. Judged on the data from galactic scales alone, the case for dark\nmatter is weak and non-standard theories of gravity provide a better\ndescription. Of course, non-standard theories of gravity have their own\nproblems, but not on galactic scales.\n", "  Adopting a single degenerate scenario for Type Ia supernova progenitors with\nthe metallicity effect, we make a prediction of the cosmic supernova rate\nhistory as a composite of the supernova rates in spiral and elliptical\ngalaxies, and compare with the recent observational data up to z ~ 0.55.\n", "  Over the past three years, our confidence in the inferred values of\ncosmological parameters has increased dramatically, confirming that the flat\nmatter dominated Universe that dominated cosmological model building for the\npast 20 years does not correspond to the Universe in which we live. I review\nrecent developments here and quote best fit current values for fundamental\ncosmological parameters.\n", "  The hierarchical cold dark matter (CDM) model for structure formation is a\nwell defined and testable model. Direct detection is the best technique for\nconfirming the model yet predictions for the energy and density distribution of\nparticles on earth remain inadequate. Axially symmetric collapse of\ncollisionless dark matter can leave observable caustic rings in phase space and\nthis model is frequently used to make experimental predictions (Sikivie 1999).\nSuch cold collapses inevitably suffer from radial orbit instabilities that\nproduce unrealistic bar-like halos. Moreover, this model bears no relation to\nthe hierarchical growth of CDM galactic halos which form via a complicated\nsequence of mergers and violent relaxation. This process destroys any symmetry\nand phase wraps existing caustics on a scale comparable to the first objects to\ncollapse. Since axions can cluster on microscopic scales and free streaming of\nneutralinos only erases structure smaller than \\sim 100 (GeV/m_{CDM}) A.U., the\ndynamical effects of caustics in the Galactic halo are expected to be\nnegligible.\n", "  We briefly review the fundamentals of nuclear gamma-ray line astronomy\n(radioactive astronomy), focusing on its role to decipher the intimate physics\nof supernovae, either immediatly (via $^{56}Co)$ or after a time delay (via\n$^{44}Ti$). All kinds of supernovae can be in principle tested through their\nradioactivities and their associated gamma-ray lines.\n  Dedicated to the spectroscopy and imaging of celestial sources in the 15 keV\nto 10 MeV band, the ESA scientific observatory INTEGRAL will open a golden age\nof nuclear astrophysics in Europe\n", "  Primordial evaluations of the deuterium abundance should provide one of the\nbest tests of Big Bang nucleosynthesis models. Space as well as ground based\nobservations seem however to result in different values. This asks for more\nobservations in different astrophysical sites in order to link present day\ninterstellar medium D/H evaluations to primordial ones. New investigations,\nmade with FUSE (the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer launched in June\n1999), are presented and in the case of the white dwarf G191-B2B line of sight\na low D/H evaluation of 1.16 (+/-0.24) x 10^-5 (2 sigma) is confirmed. This\nseems to indicate that D/H variations are probably present in the nearby\ninterstellar medium. The FUSE observations should help us reach in a near\nfuture a better global view of the evolution of that key element.\n", "  We have computed a grid of multiphase chemical evolution models whose results\nare valid for any spiral galaxy, using as input the maximum rotation velocity\nand the morphological type or index T.\n", "  The formation of the Milky Way is discussed within the context of the cold\ndark matter scenario. Several problems arise which can be solved if the Galaxy\nexperienced an early phase of gas heating and decoupling from the dark matter\nsubstructure. This model combines the Eggen, Lynden-Bell and Sandage picture of\na monolithic protogalactic collapses with the Searle and Zinn picture of an\nearly merging phase of substructures into one consistent scenario of Galactic\nformation.\n", "  Experimentally have we got what it takes to pursue the direct observation of\nWIMP interactions down to sensitivities of a few events /100 kg/year? For a Ge\ntarget with a low energy threshold (<20 keVr) this corresponds to a\nWIMP-nucleon sigma~10^-46 cm^2. A number of recent theoretical papers, making\ncalculations in SUSY-based frameworks, show many (>5) orders of magnitude\nspread in the possible interaction rates for models consistent with existing\nCosmology and Accelerator bounds. Some theorists, but certainly not all, are\nable to generate models, that lead to interaction rates at the few /kg/day that\nwould be implied by the current DAMA annual modulation signal. All theorists\ndemonstrate models that generate much lower interaction rates. This paper takes\nan unashamed experimentalist`s view of the issues that arise when looking\nforward to constructing 1 tonne WIMP detectors.\n", "  Continuum and emission-line variability of active galactic nuclei provides a\npowerful probe of microarcsecond scale structures in the central regions of\nthese sources. In this contribution, we review basic concepts and methodologies\nused in analyzing AGN variability. We develop from first principles the basics\nof reverberation mapping, and pay special attention to emission-line transfer\nfunctions. We discuss application of cross-correlation analysis to AGN light\ncurves. Finally, we provide a short review of recent important results in the\nfield.\n", "  Among a number of gamma-ray bursts whose host galaxies are known, GRB971214\nstands out for its high redshift(z=3.25) and the Lya emission line having a\nP-Cygni type profile. which is interpreted to be a direct consequence of the\nexpanding supershell. From a simple Voigt-fitting analysis, we estimate the\nexpansion velocity of the supershell and the neutral column density. The theory\non the evolution of supernova remnants is used to propose that the supershell\nis at the adiabatic phase, with its radius $R=10E^{1/2}_{53}$pc, its age\nt=4.7\\times 10^3 E^{1/2}_{53} yrs, and the density of the ambient medium\n$n_1=5.4E^{-1/2}_{53} cm^{-3}$, where $E_{53}=E/10^{53}$ ergs. I estimate the\nkinetic energy of the supershell to be $E_k=7.3\\times 10^{52} E_{53}$ ergs. I\nprovide an observational evidence that the gamma-ray burst can occur in a giant\nH II region whose environment is similar to that in star-forming galaxies.\n", "  Using the Chandra ACIS-I instruments, we have carried out the deepest X-ray\nobservation on a typical Galactic plane region at l 28.5 deg, where no discrete\nX-ray sources have been known previously. We have detected, as well as strong\ndiffuse emission, 275 new point X-ray sources (4 sigma confidence) within two\npartially overlapping fields (~250 arcmin^2 in total) down to ~3 x 10^{-15} erg\ns^{-1} cm^{-2} (2 -- 10 keV) or ~ 7 x 10^{-16} erg s^{-1} cm^{-2} (0.5 -- 2\nkeV). We have studied spectral distribution of these point sources, and found\nthat very soft sources detected only below ~ 3 keV are more numerous than hard\nsources detected only above ~ 3 keV. Only small number of sources are detected\nboth in the soft and hard bands. Surface density of the hard sources is almost\nconsistent with that at high Galactic regions, thus most of the hard sources\nare considered to be Active Galactic Nuclei seen through the milky way. On the\nother hand, some of the bright hard X-ray sources which show extremely flat\nspectra and iron line or edge features are considered to be Galactic,\npresumably quiescent dwarf novae. The soft sources show thermal spectra and\nsmall interstellar hydrogen column densities, and some of them exhibit X-ray\nflares. Therefore, most of the soft sources are probably X-ray active nearby\nlate type stars.\n", "  I discuss results from the recent spectroscopic survey for solar-type pre-MS\nstars in the Lower Centaurus-Crux (LCC) and Upper Centaurus-Lupus (UCL) OB\nsubgroups by Mamajek, Meyer, & Liebert (2002, AJ, 124, 1670). LCC and UCL are\nsubgroups of the Sco-Cen OB association, and the two nearest OB subgroups to\nthe Sun. In the entire survey of 110 pre-main sequence stars, there exists only\none Classical T Tauri star (PDS 66), implying that only ~1% of ~1 Msun stars\nare still accreting at age 13$\\pm$7 (1$\\sigma$) Myr. Accounting for\nobservational errors, the HRD placement of the pre-MS stars is consistent with\nthe bulk of star-formation taking place within 5-10 Myr. In this contribution,\nI estimate conservative upper limits to the intrinsic velocity dispersions of\nthe post-T Tauri stars in the LCC and UCL subgroups (<1.6 km/s and <2.2 km/s,\nrespectively; 95% CL) using Monte-Carlo simulations of Tycho-2 proper motions\nfor candidate subgroup members. I also demonstrate that a new OB subgroup\nrecently proposed to exist in Chamaeleon probably does not.\n", "  The sigma Orionis cluster is a young association evolving under the\ndisruptive influence of its massive O-star namesake. We are analysing this\ncluster as part of a program to characterise the influence of O-stars on the\nearly stages of stellar evolution. At an age of approximately 4 Myr, this\ncluster is at a crucial stage in terms of disk evolution and therefore it is a\nkey case to better constrain disk dissipation timescales. We have obtained RI\nphotometry and optical spectroscopy of the sigma Ori cluster; we have analysed\nthe Li I and Na I features to establish cluster membership. We have thus\ngathered a unique sample of spectroscopically confirmed low-mass cluster\nmembers and brown dwarfs. Disk frequencies from K-band excesses from 2MASS\nsuggest that less than 7% of the very low-mass sigma Ori members have disks, in\nstark contrast with even younger clusters (e.g. Trapezium). However,\nnear-infrared disk frequencies have to be taken with caution. We are currently\nundertaking an L-band (imaging) and mid-infrared (imaging and spectroscopy)\nprogram to identify and probe the properties of circumstellar disks around\nyoung stars in this cluster. Preliminary results indicate that at least 30% of\ncluster members have circumstellar disks.\n", "  We present Halpha spectropolarimetry of a large sample of pre-main sequence\n(PMS) stars of low and intermediate mass, and argue that the technique is a\npowerful tool in studying the circumstellar geometry around these objects. For\nthe intermediate mass (2 -- 15 Msun) Herbig Ae/Be stars we find that 16 out of\n23 show a line effect, which immediately implies that flattening is common\namong these objects. Furthermore, we find a significant difference in Halpha\nspectropolarimetry behaviour between the Herbig Be and Ae groups. For the\nHerbig Be stars, the concept of an electron scattering disc is shown to be a\nuseful concept to explain the depolarizations seen in this spectral range. At\nlower masses, more complex Halpha polarimetry behaviour starts to appear. The\nconcept of a compact source of Halpha emission that is formed close to the\nstellar surface, for instance by hot spots due to magnetospheric accretion, is\npostulated as a working hypothesis to qualitatively explain the Halpha\nspectropolarimetry behaviour around Herbig Ae and lower mass (M < 2 Msun) T\nTauri stars. The striking resemblance in spectropolarimetric behaviour between\nthe T Tauri star RY Tau and the Herbig Ae stars suggests a common origin of the\npolarized line photons, and hints that low and higher mass pre-main sequence\nstars may have more in common than had hitherto been suspected.\n", "  We use our Monte Carlo radiative transfer code to study non-embedded\nprestellar cores and cores that are embedded at the centre of a molecular\ncloud. Our study indicates that the temperature inside embedded cores is lower\nthan in isolated non-embedded cores, and generally less than 12 K, even when\nthe cores are surrounded by an ambient cloud of small visual extinction (Av~5).\nOur study shows that the best wavelength region to observe embedded cores is\nbetween 400 and 500 microns, where the core is quite distinct from the\nbackground. We also predict that very sensitive observations (~1-3 MJy/sr) at\n170-200 microns can be used to estimate how deeply a core is embedded in its\nparent molecular cloud. Finally, we present preliminary results of asymmetric\nmodels of non-embedded cores.\n", "  The scientific goal of the SACY (Search for Associations Containing\nYoung-stars) was to identify possible associations of stars younger than the\nPleiades Association among optical counterparts of the ROSAT X-ray bright\nsources. High-resolution spectra for possible optical counterparts later than\nG0 belonging to HIPPARCOS and/or TYCHO-2 catalogs were obtained in order to\nassess both the youth and the spatial motion of each target. More than 1000\nROSAT sources were observed, covering a large area in the Southern Hemisphere.\nThe newly identified young stars present a patchy distribution in UVW and XYZ,\nrevealing the existence of huge nearby young associations. Here we present the\nassociations identified in this survey.\n", "  Observations of young stellar objects, such as classical T Tauri stars\n(CTTSs), show evidence of accretion disks (ADs), outflows and jets. It is shown\nthat Alfven waves (AWs) are important in all of these phenomena. AWs can be\ncreated by turbulence in the AD and magnetosphere of a CTTS. Jets, stellar\noutflows, and the heating of the central regions of ADs may be due to the\ndamping of AWs. Our recent investigations of the heating of the AD and the\nmagnetosphere by AWs as well as of the structures produced in outflows from ADs\ninitiated by turbulent AWs, are discussed. We comment on the possible\nimportance of AWs in resolving the energy and angular momentum problems of\nCTTSs.\n", "  We review observational evidence and open issues related to the process of\nmagnetospheric accretion in T Tauri stars. Emphasis is put on recent numerical\nsimulations and observational results which suggest that the interaction\nbetween the stellar magnetosphere and the inner accretion disk is a highly time\ndependent process on timescales ranging from hours to months.\n", "  Microlensed double-image quasars have sent a consistent message that the\nbaryonic dark matter consists of a population of free-roaming planet mass\nobjects, as summarized previously. These were previously predicted to have\nformed at the time of recombination, 300,000 years after the Big Bang, whence\nthey collapsed on a Kelvin Helmholz time scale. Today they are glimpsed as the\ncometary knots in planetary nebulae. But they probably also nucleate the\nmysterious Lyman-alpha clouds and cause a reduction in the transparency of the\nuniverse to distant quasars and supernovae.\n", "  We have carried out the dark matter search with a 116g direction-sensitive\nstilbene crystal in Kamioka Observatory. With the crystal fixed to the earth,\nwe searched the modulation of thelight output. No modulation signal was found\ndue to the small size of the detector crystal and the higher background rate\nyet to be eliminated. However, it demonstrated the effectiveness of the method\nof direction sensitive search for the dark matter with an implementation of the\nanisotropic organic scintillation crystal.\n", "  This article reviews the life and death of a scientific theory.\n", "  We present first competitive results on WIMP dark matter using the\nphonon-light-detection technique. A particularly strong limit for WIMPs with\ncoherent scattering results from selecting a region of the phonon-light plane\ncorresponding to tungsten recoils. The observed count rate in the neutron band\nis compatible with the rate expected from neutron background. CRESST is\npresently being upgraded with a 66 channel SQUID readout system, a neutron\nshield and a muon veto system. This results in a significant improvement in\nsensitivity.\n", "  The dark matter problem will be solved only when all of the dark matter is\naccounted for. Although wimps may be discovered in direct detection experiments\nsoon, we will not know what fraction of the dark matter halo they compose until\nwe measure their local density. In this talk, I will offer a novel method to\ndetermine the mass of a wimp from direct detection experiments alone using\nkinematical consistency constraints. I will then describe a general method to\nestimate the local density of wimps using both dark matter detection and hadron\ncollider data when it becomes available. These results were obtained in\ncollaboration with Gordon Kane at the University of Michigan.\n", "  The WARP programme for dark matter search with a double phase argon detector\nis presented. In such a detector both excitation and ionization produced by an\nimpinging particle are evaluated by the contemporary measurement of primary\nscintillation and secondary (proportional) light signal, this latter being\nproduced by extracting and accelerating ionization electrons in the gas phase.\nThe proposed technique, verified on a 2.3 liters prototype, could be used to\nefficiently discriminate nuclear recoils, induced by WIMP's interactions, and\nmeasure their energy spectrum. An overview of the 2.3 liters results and of the\nproposed 100 liters detector is shown.\n", "  This paper presents a brief review of the evidence for dark matter in the\nUniverse on the scales of galaxies. In the interests of critically and\nobjectively testing the dark matter paradigm on these scales, this evidence is\nweighed against that from the only other game in town, modified Newtonian\ndynamics. The verdict is not as clear cut as one might have hoped.\n", "  The project of a micro-TPC matrix of cells of 3He for direct detection of\nnon-baryonic dark matter is presented. The privileged properties of 3He for\nthis detection are highlighted. The double detection: ionization-projection of\ntracks is explained and its rejection evaluated. The specific capabilities of\nthis project with respect to other experiments are mentioned and its\ncomplementarities concerning the supersymmetric phenomenology explicitly\nshowed.\n", "  Until the advent of XMM-Newton, the cluster soft excess (CSE) was the subject\nof some controversy due to both data analysis issues and uncertainties with the\nsoft excess emission mechanism. XMM-Newton observations have finally laid to\nrest any doubts as to the existence of the CSE and have also given tantalising\nclues as to the nature of its emission mechanism. Here we report on the\nanalysis of XMM-Newton observations of a number of CSE clusters in an attempt\nto improve the analysis and understanding of the CSE. Included as part of the\nstudy is an analysis of the effects of background subtraction, which calls to\nquestion the integrity of the claimed O VII line discovery, though not the soft\nexcess itself. We also give details of both thermal and non-thermal fits to the\nCSE cluster Abell 3112.\n", "  Dark energy might have an influence on the formation of non--linear\nstructures during the cosmic history. For example, in models in which dark\nenergy couples to dark matter, it will be non--homogeneous and will influence\nthe collapse of a dark matter overdensity. We use the spherical collapse model\nto estimate how much influence dark energy might have.\n", "  In this proceeding, we briefly review three recent results. First, we show\nthat halos formed in simulations with gas cooling are significantly rounder\nthan halos formed in dissipationless $N$-body simulations. The increase in\nprinciple axis ratios is $\\delta (c/a) ~ 0.2 - 0.4$ in the inner halo and\nremains significant at large radii. Second, we discuss the CDM substructure\ncrisis and demonstrate the sensitivity of the crisis to the spectrum of\nprimordial density fluctuations on small scales. Third, we assess the ability\nof experiments like VERITAS and GLAST to detect $\\gamma$-rays from neutralino\ndark matter annihilation in dark subhalos about the MW.\n", "  The scientific motivation is reviewed for a next generation radio observatory\noperating at frequencies between about 200 MHz and 2 GHz with about 2 orders of\nmagnitude greater sensitivity than that which is currently available, together\nwith sub-arcsecond angular resolution. Instrumental concepts for the telescope\nare discussed, highlighting the role of mass produced receiver elements and\ndigital electronics in increasing cost-effectiveness while actively reducing\nthe instrument's sensitivity to radio frequency interference.\n", "  The extragalactic applications of NIR surveys are summarized with a focus on\nthe ability to map the interstellar extinction of our Galaxy. Very preliminary\nextraction of galaxies on a set of 180 consecutive images is presented, and the\nresults illustrate some of the pitfalls in attempting an homogeneous extraction\nof galaxies from these wide-angle and shallow surveys.\n", "  I introduce the two classes of pulsar, white-dwarf binaries, and describe for\neach what we have learned from a specific system, PSR J1012+5307 and PSR\nB0655+64, respectively, summarising what has been done, presenting new results,\nand discussing what the future may hold. Briefly, for the companion of PSR\nJ1012+5307 we find a DA spectrum, and infer a mass of about 0.16Msun, the\nlowest among all spectroscopically identified white dwarfs. Combined with a\nradial-velocity orbit, a neutron-star mass between 1.5 and 3.2Msun (95% conf.)\nis derived. The companion of PSR B0655+64 shows strong Swan C2 bands, i.e., it\nis a DQ star. Unlike anything reported for other DQs, however, it shows\nvariations in strength of the bands by a factor two. Most likely, the\nvariations are periodic, with a period of about 9.7h. This is substantially\nshorter than the 1-day orbital period, which can likely be understood in terms\nof its past evolution.\n", "  The current status of the problem of whether neutron stars can form, in close\nbinary systems, by accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of white dwarfs is\nexamined. We find that, in principle, both initially cold C+O white dwarfs in\nthe high-mass tail of their mass distribution in binaries and O+Ne+Mg white\ndwarfs can produce neutron stars. Which fractions of neutron stars in different\ntypes of binaries (or descendants from binaries) might originate from this\nprocess remains uncertain.\n", "  Through the triple-alpha process occurring in red giant stars the bulk of the\ncarbon existing in our universe is produced. We calculated the change of the\ntriple-alpha reaction rate for slight variations of the nucleon-nucleon force\nusing a microscopic 12-body model. Stellar model calculations for a low-mass,\nintermediate-mass and massive star using the different triple-alpha reaction\nrates obtained with different strengths of the N-N interaction have been\nperformed. Even with a change of 0.4% in the strength of N-N force,\ncarbon-based life appears to be impossible, since all the stars then would\nproduce either almost solely carbon or oxygen, but could not produce both\nelements.\n", "  A number of recent experiments have showed that surfactants can modify the\ngrowth mode of an epitaxial film, suppressing islanding and promoting\nlayer-by-layer growth. Here a set of coupled equations are introduced to\ndescribe the coupling between a growing interface and a thin surfactant layer\ndeposited on the top of the nonequilibrium surface . The equations are derived\nusing the main experimentally backed characteristics of the system and basic\nsymmetry principles. The system is studied using a\ndynamic-renormalization-group scheme, which provides scaling relations between\nthe roughness exponents. It is found that the surfactant may drive the system\ninto a novel phase, in which the surface roughness is negative, corresponding\nto a flat surface.\n", "  We report current progress on the synthesis of methods to alleviate two major\ndifficulties in implementing a Monte Carlo Renormalization Group (MCRG) for\nquantum systems. In particular, we have utilized the loop-algorithm to reduce\ncritical slowing down, and we have implemented an MCRG method in which the\nsymmetries of the classical equivalent model need not be fully understood,\nsince the Renormalization Group is given by the Monte Carlo simulation. We\nreport preliminary results obtained when the resulting MCRG method is applied\nto the d=1 XXZ model. Our results are encouraging. However, since this model\nhas a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, it does not yet provide a full test of\nour MCRG method.\n", "  Several nonlinear stochastic differential equations have been proposed in\nconnection with self-organized critical phenomena. Due to the threshold\ncondition involved in its dynamic evolution an infinite number of\nnonlinearities arises in a hydrodynamic description. We study two models with\ndifferent noise correlations which make all the nonlinear contribution to be\nequally relevant below the upper critical dimension. The asymptotic values of\nthe critical exponents are estimated from a systematic expansion in the number\nof coupling constants by means of the dynamic renormalization group.\n", "  We review some aspects of current knowledge regarding the decay of metastable\nphases in many-particle systems. In particular we emphasize recent theoretical\nand computational developments and numerical results regarding homogeneous\nnucleation and growth in kinetic Ising and lattice-gas models. An introductory\ndiscussion of the droplet theory of homogeneous nucleation is followed by a\ndiscussion of Monte Carlo and transfer-matrix methods commonly used for\nnumerical study of metastable decay, including some new algorithms. Next we\ndiscuss specific classes of systems. These include a brief discussion of recent\nprogress for fluids, and more exhaustive considerations of ferromagnetic Ising\nmodels ({\\it i.e.}, attractive lattice-gas models) with weak long-range\ninteractions and with short-range interactions. Whereas weak-long-range-force\n(WLRF) models have infinitely long-lived metastable phases in the\ninfinite-range limit, metastable phases in short-range-force (SRF) models\neventually decay, albeit extremely slowly. Recent results on the finite-size\nscaling of metastable lifetimes in SRF models are reviewed, and it is pointed\nout that such effects may be experimentally observable.\n", "  This is an expanded version of the lectures given at the Trieste Summer\nSchool 1992 on Low-dimensional Quantum Field Theories for Condensed Matter\nPhysicists.\n", "  We review recent numerical progress in the study of finite dimensional\nstrongly disordered magnetic systems like spin glasses and random field\nsystems. In particular we report in some details results for the critical\nproperties and the non-equilibrium dynamics of Ising spin glasses. Furthermore\nwe present an overview over recent investigations on the random field Ising\nmodel and finally of quantum spin glasses.\n", "  Models of adhesion of extended particles on linear and planar substrates are\nof interest in interpreting surface deposition in colloid, polymer, and certain\nbiological systems. An introduction is presented to recent theoretical advances\nin modeling these processes. Effects of diffusional relaxation are surveyed in\ndetail, including results obtained by analytical, large-scale numerical,\nmean-field and scaling approaches.\n", "  We present a critical discussion of recent experimental probes of the pairing\nstate of the high temperature superconductors, focusing primarily, but not\nexclusively, on \\Yba, where the best data currently exist. Penetration depth\nmeasurements near \\Tc\\ give no indication of an extra transition, indicating\nthat the pairing state is a one-dimensional representation of the crystal\nsymmetry. Penetration depth measurements at low temperatures provide strong\nevidence for a change in sign of the gap function over the Fermi surface.\nQuantum mechanical phase interference experiments generally confirm this and in\naddition show that the nodal positions are consistent with a \\dx2y2\\ pairing\nstate. This pairing state is consistent with photoemission measurements of the\ngap function, Raman scattering, the effect on \\Tc\\ of impurities, and many\nother data (reviewed by two of us previously) which indicate the presence of\nlow lying excitations in the superconducting state. We also discuss evidence\nthat apparently does not fit in with a \\dx2y2\\ pairing state, and we describe\npossible alternative scenarios.\n", "  We review some elementary aspects of the critical properties of the series of\nmetal-insulator transitions that constitute the integer quantum Hall effect.\nNumerical work has proven essential in charting out this phenomenon. Without\nbeing complete, we review network models that seem to capture the essentials of\nthis critical phenomenon.\n", "  We review the fermionic Chern-Simons field theory for the Fractional Quantum\nHall Effect (FQHE). We show that in this field theoretic approach to the\nproblem of interacting electrons moving in a plane in the presence of an\nexternal magnetic field, the FQHE states appear naturally as the semiclassical\nstates of the theory. In this framework, the FQHE states are the unique ground\nstates of a system of electrons on a fixed geometry. The excitation spectrum is\nfully gapped and these states can be viewed as infrared stable fixed points of\nthe system. It is shown that the long distance, low energy properties of the\nsystem are described exactly by this theory. It is further shown that, in this\nlimit, the actual ground state wave function has the Laughlin form. We also\ndiscuss the application of this theory to the problem of the FQHE in bilayers\nand in unpolarized single layer systems.\n", "  We review the models developed and techniques used in recent years to study\nthe kinetics of phase ordering in a class of complex fluids, namely, ternary\nmicroemulsions and micellar solutions.\n", "  Metallic films are important in catalysis, magneto-optic storage media, and\ninterconnects in microelectronics, and it is crucial to predict and control\ntheir morphologies. The evolution of a growing crystal is determined by the\nbehavior of each individual atom, but technologically relevant structures have\nto be described on a time scale of the order of (at least) tenths of a second\nand on a length scale of nanometers. An adequate theory of growth should\ndescribe the atomistic level on very short time scales (femtoseconds), the\nformation of small islands (microseconds), as well as the evolution of\nmesoscopic and macroscopic structures (tenths of seconds).\n  The development of efficient algorithms combined with the availability of\ncheaper and faster computers has turned density functional theory (DFT) into a\nreliable and feasible tool to study the microscopic aspects of growth phenomena\n(and many other complex processes in materials science, condensed matter\nphysics, and chemistry). In this paper some DFT results for diffusion\nproperties on metallic surfaces are presented. Particularly, we will discuss\nthe current understanding of the influences of strain on the diffusion (energy\nbarrier and prefactor) of a single adatom on a substrate.\n  A DFT total energy calculation by its nature is primarily a static\ncalculation. An accurate way to describe the spatial and temporal development\nof a growing crystal is given by kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC). We will describe\nthe method and its combination with microscopic parameters obtained from ab\ninitio calculations. It is shown that realistic ab initio kinetic Monte Carlo\nsimulations are able to predict an evolving mesoscopic structure on the basis\nof microscopic details.\n", "  We provide details of a shorter letter and cond-mat/9702098 and some new\nresults. We describe a Chern-Simons theory for the fractional quantum Hall\nstates in which magnetoplasmon degrees of freedom enter. We derive correlated\nwavefunctions, operators for creating quasiholes and composite fermions and\nbosons (which are electrons bound to zeros). We show how the charge of these\nparticles and mass gets renormalized to the final values and compute the\neffective mass approximately. By deriving a hamiltonian description of the\ncomposite fermions and bosons and their charge and current operators, we make\nprecise and reconcile many notions that have been associated with them.\n", "  We review recent simulation studies of interfaces between immiscible\nhomopolymer phases. Special emphasis is given to the presentation of efficient\nsimulation techniques and powerful methods of data analysis, such as the\nanalysis of capillary wave spectra. Possible reasons for polymer\nincompatibility and ways to relate model dependent interaction parameters to an\neffective Flory Huggins parameter are discussed. Various interfaces are then\nconsidered and characterised with respect to their microscopic structure and\nthermodynamic properties. In particular, interfaces between homopolymers of\nequal or disparate stiffness are studied, interfaces containing diblock\ncopolymers, and interfaces confined in thin films. The results are related to\nthe phase behaviour of ternary homopolymer/copolymer systems, and to wetting\ntransitions in thin films.\n", "  The low-energy physics of systems coupled to their surroundings is understood\nby truncating to effective Hamiltonians; these tend to reduce to a few\ncanonical forms, involving coupling to \"baths\" of oscillators or spins. The\nmethod for doing this is demonstrated using examples from magnetism,\nsuperconductivity, and measurement theory, as is the way one then solves for\nthe low-energy dynamics. Finally, detailed application is given to the exciting\nrecent Quantum relaxation and tunneling work in naomagnets.\n", "  The composite fermion picture has had a remarkable number of recent successes\nboth in the description of the fractional quantized Hall states and in the\ndescription on the even denominator Fermi liquid like states. In this review we\ngive an introductory account of the Chern-Simons fermion theory, focusing on\nthe description of the even denominator states as unusual Fermi liquids.\nContents include:\n  1.

Last Words\n", "  We present a Riesz-like hyperholomorphic functional calculus for a set of\nnon-commuting operators based on the Clifford analysis. Applications to the\nquantum field theory are described. Keywords: Functional calculus, Weyl\ncalculus, Riesz calculus, Clifford analysis, quantization, quantum field\ntheory. AMSMSC Primary:47A60, Secondary: 81T10\n", "  The energy conditions of general relativity permit one to deduce very\npowerful and general theorems about the behaviour of strong gravitational\nfields and cosmological geometries. However, the energy conditions these\ntheorems are based on are beginning to look a lot less secure than they once\nseemed: (1) there are subtle quantum effects that violate all of the energy\nconditions, and more tellingly (2), there are also relatively benign looking\nclassical systems that violate all the energy conditions. This opens up a\nPandora's box of rather disquieting possibilities --- everything from negative\nasymptotic mass, to traversable wormholes, to warp drives, up to and including\ntime machines.\n", "  The stability of our vacuum is analyzed and several aspects concerning this\nquestion are reviewed. 1) In the standard Glashow-Weinberg-Salam (GWS) model we\nreview the instability towards the formation of a bubble of lower energy\ndensity and how the rate of such bubble formation process compares with the age\nof the Universe for the known values of the GWS model. 2) We also review the\nrecent work by one of us (E.I.G) concerning the vacuum instability question in\nthe context of a model that solves the cosmological constant problem. It turns\nout that in such model the same physics that solves the cosmological constant\nproblem makes the vacuum stable. 3) We review our recent work concerning the\ninstability of elementary particle embedded in our vacuum, towards the\nformation of an infinite Universe. Such process is not catastrophic. It leads\nto a \"bifurcation type\" instability in which our Universe is not eaten by a\nbubble (instead a baby universe is born). This universe does not replace our\nUniverse rather it disconnects from it (via a wormhole) after formation.\n", "  Upcoming gravitational wave-experiments promise a window for discovering new\nphysics in astronomy. Detection sensitivity of the broadband laser\ninterferometric detectors LIGO/VIRGO may be enhanced by matched filtering with\naccurate wave-form templates. Where analytic methods break down, we have to\nresort to numerical relativity, often in Hamiltonian or various hyperbolic\nformulations. Well-posed numerical relativity requires consistency with the\nelliptic constraints of energy and momentum conservation. We explore this using\na choice of gauge in the future and a dynamical gauge in the past. Applied to a\npolarized Gowdy wave, this enables solving {\\em all} ten vacuum Einstein\nequations. Evolution of the Schwarzschild metric in 3+1 and, more generally,\nsufficient conditions for well-posed numerical relativity continue to be open\nchallenges.\n", "  The structure of the general, inhomogeneous solution of (bosonic)\nEinstein-matter systems in the vicinity of a cosmological singularity is\nconsidered. We review the proof (based on ideas of\nBelinskii-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz and technically simplified by the use of the\nArnowitt-Deser-Misner Hamiltonian formalism) that the asymptotic behaviour, as\none approaches the singularity, of the general solution is describable, at each\n(generic) spatial point, as a billiard motion in an auxiliary Lorentzian space.\nFor certain Einstein-matter systems, notably for pure Einstein gravity in any\nspacetime dimension D and for the particular Einstein-matter systems arising in\nString theory, the billiard tables describing asymptotic cosmological behaviour\nare found to be identical to the Weyl chambers of some Lorentzian Kac-Moody\nalgebras. In the case of the bosonic sector of supergravity in 11 dimensional\nspacetime the underlying Lorentzian algebra is that of the hyperbolic Kac-Moody\ngroup E(10), and there exists some evidence of a correspondence between the\ngeneral solution of the Einstein-three-form system and a null geodesic in the\ninfinite dimensional coset space E(10)/K (E(10)), where K (E(10)) is the\nmaximal compact subgroup of E(10).\n", "  This talk discusses the relation between spacetime-dependent scalars, such as\ncouplings or fields, and the violation of Lorentz symmetry. A specific\ncosmological supergravity model demonstrates how scalar fields can acquire\ntime-dependent expectation values. Within this cosmological background,\nexcitations of these scalars are governed by a Lorentz-breaking dispersion\nrelation. The model also contains couplings of the scalars to the\nelectrodynamics sector leading to the time dependence of both the\nfine-structure parameter alpha and the theta angle. Through these couplings,\nthe variation of the scalars is also associated with Lorentz- and CPT-violating\neffects in electromagnetism.\n", "  The quantum potential approach makes it possible to construct a complementary\npicture of quantum mechanical evolution which reminds classical equation of\nmotion. The only difference as compared to equations of motion for the\nunderlying classical system is the presence of an additional potential term\nbeing a functional of the real part of the wavefunction. In the present paper\nthis approach is applied to the quantum theory of gravity based on Wheeler --\nDe Witt equation. We describe the derivation of the `quantum Einstein equation'\nand discuss the new features of their solutions.\n", "  We have shown that, as in the case of black holes, an ergosphere itself with\nno event horizon inside can evaporate spontaneously, giving energy radiation to\nspatial infinity until the ergoregion disappears. However, the feature of his\nquantum ergoregion instability is very much different from black hole\nradiation. It is rather analogous to a laser amplification. This analysis is\nbased on the canonical quantization of a neutral scalar field in the presence\nof unstable modes characterized by complex frequencies in a simple model for a\nrapidly rotating star.\n", "  We study the implications of a scalar-tensorial gravity for the metric of an\nisolated self-gravitating superconducting cosmic string. These modifications\nare induced by an arbitrary coupling of a massless scalar field to the usual\ntensorial field in the gravitational Lagrangian. We derive the metric in the\nweak-field approximation and we analyse the behaviour of light in this\nspacetime. We end with some discussions.\n", "  We present a sudy of the interactions of Q-balls with matter, and their\nenergy losses in the earth, for a large range of velocities. These calculations\nare used to computethe fractional geometrical acceptance of underground\ndetectors. Furthermore we computed the light yield in liquidscintillators, the\nionization in streamer tubes and the Restricted Energy Loss in nuclear track\ndetectors.\n", "  After a brief presentation of the MACRO detector we discuss the updated data\non atmospheric muon neutrinos, and the interpretation in terms of neutrino\noscillations.\n", "  SIMPLE is an experimental search for evidence of spin-dependent dark matter,\nbased on superheated droplet detectors using C$_{2}$ClF$_{5}$. We report\npreliminary results of a 0.6 kgdy exposure of five one liter devices, each\ncontaining $\\sim$10 g active mass, in the 1500 mwe LSBB (Rustrel, France). In\ncombination with improvements in detector sensitivity, the results exclude a\nWIMP--proton interaction above 5 pb at M$_{\\chi}$ = 50 GeV/c$^{2}$.\n", "  I present measurements by the CDF collaboration of the Standard Model three\ngeneration CKM matrix element Vtb and of a special case extension with\nadditional assumptions, using current Tevatron ttbar data. I then show how we\ncan significantly improve the precision on Vtb and at the same time extend the\nmeasurement so it is not constrained by Standard Model assumptions, using\nsingle top production at the upgraded Tevatron.\n", "  Studies on the structure of the photon are presented by means of the\nextraction of a leading order effective parton distribution in the photon and\nmeasurements of inclusive jet differential cross sections in photoproduction.\nMeasurements of the internal structure of jets have been performed and are also\npresented as a function of the transverse energy and pseudorapidity of the\njets.\n", "  Measurements of the hadronic final state at HERA are reviewed, which aim at\nthe investigation of the parton dynamics of the proton at small Bjorken x.\n", "  This review addresses the question of the chirality of $b$ quark weak\ncouplings from a theoretical and from a purely phenomenological point of view.\nDue to their small magnitude $b$ decay couplings are subject to possible large\ncorrections from right-handed terms, on the one hand, and do not affect the\nweak interactions of the first two quark families in any observable manner, on\nthe other hand. This motivated an $SU(2)_L\\times SU(2)_R\\times U(1)$ model with\npurely right-handed $b$-decay couplings. The model is consistent with\nexperiments, including recent measurements of a lepton forward-backward\nasymmetry in $B\\to D^*\\ell\\nu$ and of radiative $B$ decays. Parity violating\nasymmetries in semileptonic decays of polarized $\\Lambda_b$ baryons produced in\n$Z^0$ decays provide a promising way of measuring the chirality of the $b$ to\n$c$ current.\n", "  Many complex systems are representable as macroscopic set of elements which\ninteract by simple rules. The complex macroscopically relevant phenomena are\nthen the result of the generic emergence of a space-time multi-scale dynamics.\nCritical Slowing Down labels the emerging global features and describes their\ncomplex collective evolution. This paradigm is quite universal and extends to a\nvery wide range of systems and disciplines.\n", "  First we discuss various topological objects (monopoles, ``minopoles'' and\n``hybrids'') which may be important for the confinement mechanism in various\nabelian projections. The second topic is the string between quark and\nantiquark. The standard quantum string with the Nambu-Goto action exists only\nin D=26. If we start from the field theory, in which the string excitations\nexist, and change the variables in the path integral to the string variables,\nthen the Jacobian appears. This Jacobian generates the correction to the\nNambu-Goto action. For this effective action the conformal anomaly cancels in\nD=4. Thus we get the quantum string theory in D=4.\n", "  The condensation of monopoles (dual superconductivity) of QCD vacuum is\nreviewed. Direct evidence is produced that the system, in the confined phase,\nis a dual superconductor.\n", "  The effect of the strange quark in the finite temperature phase transition of\nQCD is studied on the lattice. Using the one-plaquette gauge action and the\nWilson quark action, the transition in the chiral limit is shown to be\ncontinuous for the case of degenerate two flavors, $N_F=2$, while it is of\nfirst order for $N_F \\geq 3$. For a more realistic case of massless up and down\nquarks and a light strange quark, $N_F=2+1$, clear two state signals are\nobserved both for $m_s \\simeq 150$ and 400 MeV. In contrast to a previous\nresult with staggered quarks, this suggests a first order transition in the\nreal world. In order to see the implication of these results to the continuum\nlimit, we started to study these issues using improved actions. First results\nusing a RG improved gauge action combined with the standard Wilson quark is\npresented for the case of $N_F=2$: With this action the finite temperature\ntransition is shown to be continuous in the chiral limit confirming the result\nof the standard action. Furthermore, not like the case of the standard action\nwhere lattice artifacts make the transition once very strong at intermediate\nvalues of the hopping parameter $K$ on $N_t=4$ and 6 lattices, a smooth\ncrossover is found for the improved action when we increase $1/K-1/K_c$, in\naccord with a naive expectation about the fate of second order chiral\ntransition at finite $m_q$.\n", "  We present evidence that the existence of a first order phase transition in\ncompact U(1) with Wilson action is not related to monopole loops wrapping\naround the toroidal lattice, as has been previously suggested. Our analysis is\nbased on the suppression of such loops by `soft boundary conditions' that\ncorrespond to an infinitely large chemical potential for the monopoles on the\nboundary, during the updating process. It is observed that the double peak\nstructure characteristic for the first order phase transition reappears at\nsufficiently large lattice sizes and separations from the lattice boundary.\n", "  We discuss a class of saddle-point configurations in SU(2) lattice gauge\ntheory in three Euclidean dimensions. These configurations are smooth on the\nscale of the lattice and have an action density exhibiting localized peaks, as\nhas been seen in cooled and extremized Monte Carlo generated lattices. Large\nWilson loops centered on the action peaks show a unit of Z(2) flux. We discuss\nthe generation of these configurations and measurements of the Creutz ratios on\nthem.\n", "  This is the short review of Monte-Carlo studies of quark confinement in\nlattice QCD. After abelian projections both in the maximally abelian and\nPolyakov gauges, it is seen that the monopole part alone is responsible for\nconfinement. A block spin transformation on the dual lattice suggests that\nlattice $SU(2)$ QCD is always ( for all $\\beta$) in the monopole condensed\nphase and so in the confinement phase in the infinite volume limit.\n", "  We present results on the spin-independent quark-antiquark potential in SU(3)\ngauge theory from a simulation on a 48^3*64 lattice at Beta = 6.8,\ncorresponding to a volume of (1.7 fm)^3. Moreover, a comprehensive analysis of\nspin- and velocity-dependent potentials is carried out for SU(2) gauge theory,\nwith emphasis on the short range structure, on lattices with resolutions\nranging from .02 fm to .04 fm.\n", "  The spacial distribution of fields and currents in confining theories can\ngive direct evidence of dual superconductivity. We would like to discuss the\ntechniques for finding these properties and calculating the superconductivity\nparameters in lattice simulations. We have seen dual Abrikosov vortices\ndirectly in pure U(1) and SU(2) and others have also seen them in SU(3). In the\nnon-Abelian cases the system appears to be near the borderline between type I\nand II. We also discuss the response of the supercurrents to external fields.\n", "  We present SU(3) gluon propagators calculated on 48*48*48*N_t lattices at\nbeta=6.8 where N_t=64 (corresponding the confinement phase) and N_t=16\n(deconfinement) with the bare gauge parameter,alpha, set to be 0.1. In order to\navoid Gribov copies, we employ the stochastic gauge fixing algorithm. Gluon\npropagators show quite different behavior from those of massless gauge fields:\n(1) In the confinement phase, G(t) shows massless behavior at small and large\nt, while around 5<t<15 it behaves as massive particle, and (2) effective mass\nobserved in G(z) becomes larger as z increases. (3) In the deconfinement phase,\nG(z) shows also massive behavior but effective mass is less than in the\nconfinement case. In all cases, slope masses are increasing functions of t or\nz, which can not be understood as addtional physical poles.\n", "  In this talk I will discuss the current picture of color confinement. In\nparticular, I will show how it can be tested microscopically. It is stressed\nthat the color magnetic monopoles in this picture are dyons. Furthermore, the\nrole of instantons is illuminated.\n", "  Pseudoscalar correlator is measured in a singular (monopole dominant) and a\nregular (photon dominant) parts of a maximal abelian field on SU(2) lattice. In\nthe abelian field and its singular part, light pseudoscalar boson are observed\nsimilar to that in SU(2) field. On the other hand , the correlator in the\nregular part behaves like a product of free quark and anti-quark. Obtained\nresults give a support for a possibility that monopole condensation is\nresponsible for chiral symmetry breaking as well as confinement. Correlation\nbetween monopoles and instantons is also investigated by observing topological\ncharge. A field including monopoles carrys topological charge with good\ncorrelation to that in original SU(2) gauge field while that including only\nphotons shows no topological charge.\n", "  We review the application of lattice QCD to the phenomenology of b- and\nc-quarks. After a short discussion of the lattice techniques used to evaluate\nhadronic matrix elements and the corresponding systematic uncertainties, we\nsummarise results for leptonic decay constants, B--Bbar mixing, semileptonic\nand rare radiative decays. A discussion of the determination of heavy quark\neffective theory parameters is followed by an explanation of the difficulty in\napplying lattice methods to exclusive nonleptonic decays.\n", "  I describe a new way for baryogenesis to proceed, which evades many of the\nproblems of GUT and electroweak scenarios. If the reheat temperature after\ninflation is below the electroweak scale, neither GUT baryon production nor\ntraditional electroweak baryogenesis can occur. However, non-thermal production\nof sphaleron configurations via preheating could generate the observed baryon\nasymmetry of the universe. Such low scale baryon production is particularly\nattractive since it evades a number of strong constraints on reheating from\ngravitino and moduli production.\n", "  We show that neutrino cross sections are direction dependent in a background\nmagnetic field.\n", "  Supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model predict the existence of\nQ-balls, some of which can be entirely stable. Both stable and unstable Q-balls\ncan play an important role in cosmology.\n  In particular, Affleck-Dine baryogenesis can result in a copious production\nof stable baryonic Q-balls, which can presently exist as a form of dark matter.\nFormation and decay of unstable Q-balls can also have some important effects on\nbaryogenesis and phase transitions.\n", "  In this talk we discuss a few relevant aspects of heterotic M-theory. These\nare the stabilization of the two relevant moduli (the length of the eleventh\nsegment (pi rho) and the volume of the internal six manifold (V)) in models\nwhere supersymmetry is broken by multiple gaugino condensation and\nnon-perturbative corrections to the Kahler potential; the existence of almost\nflat directions in the scalar potential; the possibility of lifting them, and\ntheir role in constructing a viable model of inflation. Finally, we review the\nstatus of the moduli problem within these models. T\n", "  New CP violating phases in the MSSM can affect both the abundance and\ndetection of neutralino dark matter. We discuss the effect of including\ncosmological constraints in the limits on new sources of CP violation in the\nMSSM and the effects of new CP violating parameters on dark matter densities\nand detection.\n", "  A mass-shift of the axion propagating in an external constant homogenious\nmagnetic field is calculated. The contributions via an electron loop and a\nvirtual photon are examined. It is shown that the virtual photon contribution\ndominates substantially over the electron-loop one. Under the conditions of the\nearly Universe the electron-loop contribution to the massless axion mass-shift\nis equal to zero while the virtual photon contribution is finite and can be of\norder of the recent restrictions on the axion mass.\n", "  R-parity violation in the supersymmetric standard model could be the origin\nof neutrino masses and mixing accounting for the atmospheric and solar neutrino\noscillations. More interestingly, this hypothesis may be tested in future\ncolliders by detecting lepton number violating decays of the lightest\nsupersymmetric particle. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis for the\ndetermination of sneutrino vacuum expectation values from the one-loop\neffective scalar potential, and also for the one-loop renormalization of\nneutrino masses and mixing. Applying our results to theories with gauge\nmediated supersymmetry breaking, we discuss the effects of the one-loop\ncorrections and how the realistic neutrino mass matrices arise.\n", "  In first-order phase transitions in the early universe, the bubble wall is\nexpected to be significantly slowed-down by its interaction with the\nsurrounding plasma. We examine the behaviour of the phase of the Higgs field\nafter two-bubble collisions, and find that phase differences equilibrate much\nmore quickly in slow-moving bubbles than in those which expand at the speed of\nlight. This could lead to a significant reduction in the initial density of\ntopological defects formed at a first-order phase transition.\n", "  The cosmology of a brane-universe embedded in a higher dimensional bulk\nspacetime presents some peculiarities not seen in ordinary (3+1) dimensional\ngravity. I summarize the current understanding, with emphasis on the suggestion\nby Randall and Sundrum that the bulk is 5-D anti-deSitter space, leading to a\nsolution of the weak scale hierarchy problem.\n", "  Placing a high-Tc superconductor in an increasing external magnetic field,\nthe flux first penetrates the sample through an Abrikosov vortex lattice, and\nthen a first order transition is observed by which the system goes to the\nnormal phase. We discuss the cosmological motivation for considering the\nelectroweak phase transition in the presence of an external magnetic field, the\nanalogies this system might have with the superconductor behaviour described\nabove, and in particular whether at large physical Higgs masses, corresponding\nto the high-Tc regime, an analogue of the vortex phase and an associated first\norder phase transition could be generated.\n", "  The real-time dynamics of finite-temperature gauge theories can be\napproximated, to leading-order accuracy in the coupling constants, by a\nclassical field theory with the hard thermal loop Lagrangian. I show how this\napproach can be used in numerical lattice simulations to study dynamics of the\nAbelian Higgs model in or slightly out of equilibrium.\n", "  Several issues related to the lensing of ultra-high energy cosmic rays by the\nGalactic magnetic field are discussed.\n", "  I review the construction of the Exact Parity or Mirror Matter Model and\nexplain how it solves the solar and atmospheric neutrino problems. The\noscillation driven relic neutrino asymmetry amplification phenomenon is then\nused to demonstrate the consistency of the model with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis.\n", "  This talk is a status report on our study of quantum transport equations\nrelevant for baryogenesis computations. Our main finding is that, as a\nconsequence of localization in space, the quasiparticle picture of the plasma\ndynamics breaks down at first non-trivial order in gradient expansion. While in\nthis talk we focus on bosons, we expect that a similar picture holds for\nfermions. We then argue that the quasiparticle picture is recovered in the\nadiabatic limit of frequent scattering.\n", "  This talk is based on the article hep-ph/9903517 written in collaboration\nwith Sven Bergmann and Yuval Grossman. An analysis of the effective potential\nfor neutrino propagation in matter, assuming a generic set of Lorentz invariant\nnon-derivative interactions is presented. In addition to vector and axial\nvector couplings, also tensor interactions can give coherent effects if the\nmedium is polarized, and the components of a tensor potential transverse to the\ndirection of neutrino propagation can induce a neutrino spin-flip.\n", "  Cosmology cannot rule out the solution nu_mu <-> nu_s to the atmospheric\nneutrino data and thus only Earth experiments will be able to give a definitive\nanswer. This conclusion holds when a generation of lepton number is taken into\naccount and one assumes that the sterile neutrino is also slightly mixed with\nan eV-tau neutrino. This result cannot be spoiled by a chaotic generation of\nlepton domains.\n", "  A new theoretical framework for computation of the relic abundance of cold\ndark matter particles such as LSP is presented and some generic features of new\nresults are discussed. The most important is a generalization of the Boltzmann\nequation to include off-shell effects and its thermal average over cosmic\nmedium. It is shown that at very low temperatures, much below the mass of\nannihilating particles, equilibrium abundance is suppressed only by powers of\ntemperature instead of the exponential Boltzmann factor. This change gives a\nlarger relic abundance when heavy particles freeze out at these low\ntemperatures.\n", "  Neutrinoless double beta decay belongs to the most sensitive tools for the\nsearch of new physics beyond the standard model. The recent half life limit of\nthe Heidelberg-Moscow experiment implies restrictive bounds on the absolute\nmass scale in the neutrino sector. Possible improvements by the GENIUS project\nprovide a unique possibility to reconstruct the neutrino mass spectrum. Further\nconstraints on new interactions in the neutrino sector are given in a\nmodel-independent way. Consequences for neutrino anomalies and theories beyond\nthe standard model such as left-right symmetric models, R-parity violating SUSY\nand leptoquarks are discussed. The potential of double beta decay experiments\nin the search for WIMP dark matter is reviewed.\n", "  In the MSSM, cosmological scalar field condensates formed along flat\ndirections of the scalar potential (Affleck-Dine condensates) are typically\nunstable with respect to formation of Q-balls, a type of non-topological\nsoliton. I discuss the creation and growth of the quantum seed fluctuations\nwhich catalyse the collapse of the condensate. In D-term inflation models, the\nfluctuations of squark fields in the flat directions also give rise to\nisocurvature density fluctuations stored in the Affleck-Dine condensate. After\nthe condensate breaks up, these can be perturbations in the baryon number, or,\nin the case where the present neutralino density comes directly from B-ball\ndecay, perturbations in the number of dark matter neutralinos. The latter case\nresults in a large enhancement of the isocurvature perturbation, which should\nbe observable by PLANCK.\n", "  The current status of non-accelerator based searches for effects of a\nnon-vanishing neutrino mass is reviewed. Beside the direct kinematical methods\nthis includes searches for magnetic moments and a discussion of the solar\nneutrino problem. Double beta decay is not included.\n", "  This is a short review on the subject of symmetry nonrestoration at high\ntemperature. Special emphasis is put on experimental discoveries and different\ntheoretical mechanisms. At the end, possible cosmological applications are\nbriefly mentioned.\n", "  In this contribution we will shortly review the main mechanism through which\nprimordial magnetic fields may affect the electroweak baryogenesis. It is shown\nthat although strong magnetic fields might enhance the strength of the\nelectroweak phase transition, no benefit is found for baryogenesis once the\neffect of the field on the sphaleron rate is taken into account. The possible\nrole of hypermagnetic helicity for the electroweak baryogenesis is shortly\ndiscussed.\n", "  The origin of the matter-antimatter asymmetry remains one of the most\nfundamental problems of cosmology. In this talk I present a novel scenario for\nbaryogenesis at the electroweak scale, without the need for a first order phase\ntransition. It is based on the out of equilibrium resonant production of long\nwavelength Higgs and gauge configurations, at the end of a period of inflation,\nwhich induces a large rate of sphaleron transitions, before thermalization at a\ntemperature below critical.\n", "  I review a computation of the baryon asymmetry arising from a first order\nelectroweak phase transition in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard model by\nclassical force mechanism (CFM). I focus on CP violation provided by the\ncharginos and show that it is the usually neglected sum of the two Higgsino\nfields, H_1+H_2, which gives a larger contribution to the baryon asymmetry than\ndoes the combination H_1-H_2. In fact, the latter contribution is exactly zero\nin CFM, because it is associated with a phase transformation of the fields.\nBaryogenesis is found to be most effective in MSSM CFM when only $\\tilde t_R$\nis light, which lends independent support for the \"light stop scenario\", and it\nremains viable for CP-violating phases as small as \\delta_\\mu \\sim {\\it few}\n\\times 10^{-3}.\n", "  The first measurements of CP violation in the B system will probably extract\n$\\sin 2\\alpha$, $\\sin 2\\beta$ and $\\cos 2\\gamma$. Assuming that the CP angles\n$\\alpha$, $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ are the interior angles of the unitarity\ntriangle, this determines the angle set $(\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma)$ up to a twofold\ndiscrete ambiguity. The presence of this discrete ambiguity can make the\ndiscovery of new physics difficult: if only one of the two solutions is\nconsistent with constraints from other measurements in the B and K systems, one\nis not sure whether new physics is present or not. I present examples of this\nsituation, and discuss ways to resolve the discrete ambiguity.\n", "  Brief review of some current topics, including gravitino creation and large\nextra dimensions.\n", "  A cosmological pseudoscalar field coupled to hypercharge topological number\ndensity can exponentially amplify hyperelectric and hypermagnetic fields in the\nsymmetric phase of the electroweak plasma while coherently rolling or\noscillating, leading to the formation of a condensate of topological number\ndensity. The topological number can be converted, under certain conditions,\ninto baryon number in sufficient amount to explain the observed baryon\nasymmetry of the universe. We focus on a singlet elementary hypercharge axion\n(HCA) whose only coupling to standard model fields is to hypercharge\ntopological number density. This model has two parameters: the mass $m$ and\ndecay constant $M$ of the HCA. We describe this new mechanism for baryogenesis\nand outline the region of the parameter space in which the mechanism is\nefficient. We show that present colliders can already put interesting\nconstraints on both parameters, and that future colliders will improve the\ndetection capabilities very significatively.\n", "  We discuss a heterotic-string solution in which the observable sector\neffective field theory just below the string scale reduces to that of the MSSM,\nwith the standard observable gauge group being just SU(3)_C x SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y\nand the SU(3)_C x SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y-charged spectrum of the observable sector\nconsisting solely of the MSSM spectrum. Associated with this model is a set of\ndistinct flat directions of vacuum expectation values (VEVs) of fields that all\nproduce solely the MSSM spectrum. Some of these directions only involve VEVs of\nnon-Abelian singlet fields while others also contain VEVs of non-Abelian\ncharged fields.\n", "  We briefly review the phenomenological implications of the minimal\nsupersymmetric standard model (MSSM) with explicit radiative breaking of CP\ninvariance in the Higgs sector for the LEP2 and Tevatron colliders.\n", "  I summarize results of two-loop effective potential calculations of the\nlightest CP-even Higgs boson mass in the minimal supersymmetric standard model.\n", "  A neutrino mass-mixing scheme which successfully avoids the \"alpha effect,\"\nallowing r-process nucleosynthesis in the neutrino-heated ejecta of supernovae,\nquite independently requires the same parameters as the scheme which best fits\nall current indications for neutrino mass. The significance for particle\nphysics is this independent evidence for (1) at least one light sterile\nneutrino, nu_s; (2) a near maximally-mixed nu_mu-nu_tau doublet split from a\nlower mass nu_mu-nu_s doublet; (3) nu_mu-nu_e mixing >~ 10^-4; and (4) a\nsplitting between the doublets (measured by the nu_mu-nu_e mass difference) >~\n1 eV^2, favoring the upper part of the LSND range. If correct, it is\ntantalizing that neutrinos with tiny masses which mix with sterile species have\nprofound effects on massive objects and the creation of the heaviest elements.\n", "  At moderate to large tan(beta), it is no longer possible to simultaneously\ndiagonalize the masses of quarks and their couplings to the neutral Higgs\nbosons. The resulting flavor violations of the form (\\bar b_R d_L H) and (\\bar\nb_R s_L H) do not generate large meson-anti-meson mixing amplitudes but do\ngenerate large contributes to rare decays such as B_s -> mu mu. Run II of the\nTevatron willl probe a large region of interesting MSSM parameter space through\nthis decay channel. This talk is based on results obtained with K.S. Babu and\npresented in hep-ph/9909476.\n", "  Angular and energy distributions for leptons and bottom quarks in the process\ne+e- --> t tbar --> l/b ... have been calculated assuming the most general\ntop-quark couplings. The double distributions depend both on modification of\nthe top-quark production and tbW decay vertices. However, the leptonic angular\ndistribution turned out to be insensitive to non-standard parts of tbW vertex.\nThe method of optimal observables have been used to estimate sensitivity of\nfuture measurements at linear e+e- colliders\n", "  In this talk, I briefly review collider signatures for two models of extra\ndimensions. The first one was proposed by Arkani-Hamed {\\it et al.} that\ngravity is free to propagate in extra dimensions of very large size ($\\alt 1$\nmm). Collider signatures for this model can be divided into two types: (i)\nemission of real gravitons into extra dimensions, and (ii) exchanges of virtual\ngravitons. The second model was proposed by Pomarol {\\it et al.} and Dienes\n{\\it et al.} that the SM gauge bosons are allowed to propagate in extra\ndimensions. Collider signatures for the second model are due to the existence\nof the Kaluza-Klein (KK) states of $\\gamma$, $W$, $Z$, and $g$ bosons.\n", "  Three different methods, using $B_d\\to J/\\psi K_S$, $J/\\psi K_S \\pi^0$,\n$B_d\\to K^-\\pi^+, \\pi^+\\pi^-$ and $B_u\\to K^- \\pi^0, \\bar K^0 \\pi^-,\n\\pi^-\\pi^0$, to extract hadronic model independent information about new\nphysics are discussed in this talk.\n", "  The existence of extra chiral generations is strongly disfavored by the\nprecision electroweak data if all the extra fermions are heavier than m_Z.\nHowever fits as good as the SM can be obtained if one allows the new neutral\nleptons to have masses close to 50 GeV. In the framework of SUSY models\nprecision measurements cannot exclude one additional generation of heavy\nfermions if chargino and neutralino have masses around 60 GeV with delta_m\naround 1 GeV.\n", "  Though LEP II direct searches still cannot exclude a chargino nearly\ndegenerate with the lightest neutralino if its mass is only slightly above half\nof the Z boson mass and the sneutrino is light, it can be excluded indirectly\nanalyzing precision data. In this particular limit simple analytical formulas\nfor oblique electroweak radiative corrections are presented.\n", "  The triangular basis is proposed as an efficient way of analyzing general\nquark mass matrices. Applying the method to hermitian hierarchical matrices\nwith five texture zeros, analytic predictions for quark mixing can be readily\nobtained. One unique texture pair is found most favorable with present data.\nSome remarks are also made concerning parallel textures between the up and down\nquark mass matrices with four zeros.\n", "  I review the mechanism of electroweak baryogenesis within the framework of a\nstring motivated supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model with large\nflavor-independent CP-violating phases. Possible implications for the Higgs\nsector are considered in correlation with the properties of the right-handed\nstop. I also comment on the compatibility of supersymmetric electroweak\nbaryogenesis with various CP-violating observables.\n", "  We review the possibilities that the Kaluza-Klein excitations of graviton\nstates induce electroweak symmetry breaking and that electroweak symmetry\nbreaking could have a large impact on KK phenomenology.\n", "  Electroweak symmetry breaking may be naturally induced by the observed quark\nand gauge fields in extra dimensions without a fundamental Higgs field. We show\nthat a composite Higgs doublet can arise as a bound state of $(t, b)_L$ and a\nlinear combination of the Kaluza-Klein states of $t_R$, due to QCD in extra\ndimensions. The top quark mass depends on the number of active $t_R$\nKaluza-Klein modes, and is consistent with the experimental value.\n", "  If the mixing angles in each of the seesaw sectors are all small, and the\nneutrino masses are hierarchical, we study the conditions for large neutrino\nmixing using triangular matrices. In particular, the implication of the\nneutrino oscillation data for the mass hierarchy in the heavy Majorana sector\nis examined, and the heavy Majorana scales are shown to depend sensitively on\nthe solar mixing angle.\n", "  Ultra-high-energy, >10^19 eV, cosmic-ray and high energy, ~10^14 eV, neutrino\nproduction in GRBs is discussed in the light of recent GRB and cosmic-ray\nobservations. Emphasis is put on model predictions that can be tested with\noperating and planned cosmic-ray and neutrino detectors, and on the prospects\nof testing for neutrino properties.\n", "  In this talk, I discuss recent developments concerning the possibility of\nlarge extra spacetime dimensions. After briefly reviewing how such dimensions\ncan lower the fundamental GUT, Planck, and string scales, I then outline how\nthese scenarios lead to a new higher-dimensional seesaw mechanism for\ngenerating neutrino oscillations --- perhaps even without neutrino masses. I\nalso discuss how extra dimensions lead to new mechanisms contributing to the\n``invisibility'' of the QCD axion. This talk reports on work done in\ncollaboration with Emilian Dudas and Tony Gherghetta.\n", "  In this talk, I will discuss the mechanism of nonthermal production of the\nneutralino cold dark matter from the decay of cosmic strings and the embedded\ndefects, the $\\pi$ and $\\eta^\\prime$ strings in the strong interaction sector\nof the standard model.\n", "  We give a brief summary of present bounds on the size of possible\nextra-dimensions from collider experiments.\n", "  Recent evidence for neutrino oscillations has revolutionized the study of\nneutrino masses and mixing.

Such zero modes change the underlying cosmology; for\nexample, the string can carry a current. We consider the stability of fermion\nzero modes to interactions with particles in the surrounding plasma. We also\nconsider cosmological constraints on such theories, particulary those with a\nchiral fermion zero mode, such as arises in a class of supersymmetric models.\n", "  The possibility that the Fermi scale is the only fundamental energy scale of\nNature is under serious consideration at present, yet cosmic rays may already\nhave provided direct evidence of new physics at a much higher scale. The recent\ndetection of very high energy particles with no plausible astrophysical sources\nsuggests that these originate from the slow decays of massive particles\nclustered in the halo of our Galaxy. Such particles had in fact been predicted\nto exist beforehand with mass and lifetime in the range required to explain the\nobservations.

These include the effects of\nuncertainties in the wimp velocity and wimp density and of the effects of\nuncertainties in the quark densities of the proton. Also analyzed are the\neffects of non-universalities in the gaugino sector and their effects on\ndetermining the nature of cold dark matter, i.e., if the neutralino is bino\nlike, higgsino like, or wino like. The maximum and the minimum elastic\nneutralino proton cross sections are discussed and a comparison of the direct\nand the indirect detection arising from the capture and annihilation of\nneutralinos in the core of the earth and the sun is given. Some of the other\nrecent developments are summarized.\n", "  Two germanium detectors are currently operating in the Canfranc Underground\nLaboratory at 2450 m.w.e looking for WIMP dark matter. One is a 2 kg 76Ge IGEX\ndetector (RG-2) which has an energy threshold of 4 keV and a low-energy\nbackground rate of about 0.3 c/keV/kg/day. The other is a small (234 g) natural\nabundance Ge detector (COSME), of low energy threshold (2.5 keV) and an energy\nresolution of 0.4 keV at 10 keV which is looking for WIMPs and for solar\naxions. The analysis of 73 kg-days of data taken by COSME in a search for solar\naxions via their photon Primakoff conversion and Bragg scattering in the Ge\ncrystal yields a 95% C.L. limit for the axion-photon coupling g < 2.8 10^-9\nGeV^-1. These data, analyzed for WIMP searches provide an exclusion plot for\nWIMP-nucleon spin-independent interaction which improves previous plots in the\nlow mass region. On the other hand, the exclusion plot derived from the 60\nkg-days of data from the RG-2 IGEX detector improves the exclusion limits\nderived from other ionization (non thermal) germanium detector experiments in\nthe region of WIMP masses from 30 to 100 GeV recently singled out by the\nreported DAMA annual modulation effect.\n", "  Within the Lorentz invariant formalizm for description of neutrino evolution\nin electromagnetic fields and matter we consider neutrino spin oscillations in\nthe circular polarized electromagnetic wave, the amplitude of which is a\nmodulated function of time.

Also in the light of the contradictive results from the DAMA and CDMS\nexperiments the Genius TF, a new experimental setup is proposed. The Genius TF\ncould probe the DAMA evidence region using the WIMP nucleus recoil signal and\nWIMP annual modulation signature simultaneously. Besides that it can prove the\nlong term feasibility of the detector technique to be implemented into the\nGENIUS setup and will in this sense be a first step towards the realization of\nthe GENIUS experiment.\n", "  We briefly review some theoretical issues involved in the direct detection of\nsupersymmetric (SUSY) dark matter. After a brief discussion of the allowed SYSY\nparameter space we focus on the determination of the traditional neutralino\ndetection rates, in experiments which measure the energy of the recoiling\nnucleus, such as the coherent and spin induced rates and the dependence of the\nrate on the motion of the Earth (modulation effect). Then we examine the novel\nfeatures appearing in directional experiments, which detect the recoiling\nnucleus in a given direction. Next we estimate the branching ratios for\ntransitions to accessible excited nuclear levels. Finally we estimate the event\nrates leading to the atom ionization and subsequent detection of the outgoing\nelectrons.\n", "  In this talk, instantons are discussed in the presence of Lorentz violation.\nConventional topological arguments are applied to classify the modified\nsolutions to the Yang-Mills equations according to the topological charge.\nExplicit perturbations to the instantons are calculated in detail for the case\nof unit topological charge.\n", "  We develop statistical mechanics for a nonrelativisitic ideal gas in the\npresence of Lorentz violating background fields. The analysis is performed\nusing the Standard-Model Extension (SME). We derive the corresponding laws of\nthermodynamics and find that, to lowest order in Lorentz violation, the scalar\nthermodynamic variables are corrected by a rotationally invariant combination\nof the Lorentz terms which can be interpreted in terms of a (frame dependent)\neffective mass. We find that spin couplings can induce a temperature\nindependent polarization in the gas that is not present in the conventional\ncase.\n", "  In this talk, we discuss the potential for the indirect detection of\nKaluza-Klein dark matter using neutrino telescopes and cosmic positron\nexperiments. We find that future kilometer-scale neutrino telescopes, such as\nIceCube, as well as future experiments capable of measuring the cosmic positron\nspectrum, such as PAMELA and AMS-02, will be quite sensitive to this scenario.\nCurrent data from the HEAT experiment can also be explained by the presence of\nKaluza-Klein dark matter in the Galactic halo.\n", "  In this talk we show how Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) can occur for\nMajorana neutrinos, without inducing LIV in the charged leptons via radiative\ncorrections. Such ``electrophobic'' LIV is due to the Majorana nature of the\nLIV operator together with electric charge conservation. Being free from the\nstrong constraints coming from the charged lepton sector, electrophobic LIV can\nin principle be as large as current neutrino experiments permit. On the other\nhand electrophobic LIV could be naturally small if it originates from LIV in\nsome singlet ``right-handed neutrino'' sector, and is felt in the physical\nleft-handed neutrinos via a see-saw mechanism.\n", "  Neutrino oscillations provide an opportunity for sensitive tests of Lorentz\ninvariance. This talk reviews some aspects of Lorentz violation in neutrinos\nand the prospect of testing Lorentz invariance in neutrino-oscillation\nexperiments. A general Lorentz-violating theory for neutrinos is discussed, and\nsome signals of Lorentz violation are identified.\n", "  We extend the commonly used mSUGRA framework to allow complex soft terms. We\nshow how these phases can induce large changes of the SUSY threshold\ncorrections to the b quark mass and affect the neutralino relic density\npredictions of the model. We present some specific models with large SUSY\nphases which can accommodate the fermion electric dipole moment constraints and\na neutralino relic density within the WMAP bounds.\n", "  A status report is given of some recent theoretical and experimental\ninvestigations looking for signals of Lorentz violation in QED. Experiments\nwith light, charged particles, and atoms have exceptional sensitivity to small\nshifts in energy caused by Lorentz violation, including effects that could\noriginate from new physics at the Planck scale.\n", "  We address the direct detection of neutralino dark matter in the framework of\nthe Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. We conduct a detailed\nanalysis of the parameter space, taking into account all the available\nconstraints from LEPII, and compute the neutralino-nucleon cross section. We\nfind that sizable values for the detection cross section, within the reach of\ndark matter detectors, are attainable in this framework, and are associated\nwith the exchange of very light Higgses, $m_{h_1^0}\\lesssim 70$ GeV, the latter\nexhibiting a significant singlet composition.\n", "  Broken spacetime symmetries might emerge from a fundamental physical theory.\nThe effective low-energy theory might be expected to exhibit violations of\nsupersymmetry and Lorentz invariance. Some illustrative models which combine\nsupersymmetry and Lorentz violation are described, and a superspace formulation\nis given.\n", "  Atomic clocks, masers, and other precision oscillators are likely to be\nplaced on the International Space Station and other satellites in the future.\nThese instruments will have the potential to measure Lorentz-violation\ncoefficients, and in particular may provide access to parts of the\nLorentz-violation coefficient space at levels not accessible with Earth-based\nexperiments. The basic issues are outlined in this proceedings.\n", "  In this talk, the stationary limit of Lorentz-violating electrodynamics is\ndiscussed. As illustrated by some simple examples, the general solution\nincludes unconventional mixing of electrostatic and magnetostatic effects. I\ndiscuss a high-sensitivity null-type measurement, exploiting Lorentz-violating\nelectromagnetostatic effects, that could improve existing limits on parity-odd\ncoefficients for Lorentz violation in the photon sector.\n", "  We study the Cherenkov effect in the context of the Maxwell-Chern-Simons\n(MCS) limit of the Standard Model Extension. We present a method to determine\nthe exact radiation rate for a point charge.\n", "  We discuss the mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking in supersymmetric\nversions of the standard model. After briefly reviewing the possible sources of\nsupersymmetry breaking, we show how the required pattern of symmetry breaking\ncan automatically result from the structure of quantum corrections in the\ntheory. We demonstrate that this radiative breaking mechanism works well for a\nheavy top quark and can be combined in unified versions of the theory with\nexcellent predictions for the running couplings of the model. (To be published\nin ``Perspectives in Higgs Physics'', G. Kane editor.)\n", "  We discuss how to experimentally study the symmetry breaking sector by\nobserving $W_L W_L \\rightarrow W_L W_L$ interactions in the TeV region. We\ndiscuss some general features of the event structure in the signal and\nbackground events. Various tricks to enhance the signal--to--background ratio\nare also presented. We show how to detect longitudinal $W$--bosons either in\nthe central rapidity region of the detector or in the beam pipe direction.\n", "  We explore to what extent the various assumptions behind the standard model\nas well as the observed quantization of electric charges of quarks and leptons\ncan be understood using the Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomalies. The effect of\nincluding a non-zero neutrino mass on these considerations is also discussed.\n", "  The problem of electroweak symmetry breaking is reviewed with discussion of\nfuture relevant experimentation at LHC and $e^+e^-$ linear colliders. The\npossibility of strong electroweak symmetry breaking is examined in more detail,\nusing the BESS (Breaking Electroweak Symmetry Strongly) model as a basis for\nthe discussion. The formal constructions are briefly presented and the possible\nexpectations at future colliders are summarized.\n", "  After a brief discussion of how chiral dynamics has evolved from the\n``universal V-A theory of weak interactions'', we present some evidence that\nsymmetry breaking for the vector meson multiplet is not simpler than but rather\nanalogous to that for the pseudoscalar multiplet. This provides a motivation\nfor speculating on how to extend in a systematic way the chiral perturbation\ntheory program to include vectors.\n", "  We review recent experimental results on B meson decays. These include\nmeasurements of the inclusive production of charmed and non-charmed mesons and\nbaryons, the reconstruction of a large number of exclusive hadronic final\nstates with charmed mesons, the search for exclusive hadronic final states\nwithout charmed mesons, and the first observation of the decay B-> K* gamma\nwhich is described by an electromagnetic penguin diagram. The theoretical\nimplications of these results will be considered. The figures can be obtained\nin postscript format EMAIL from kh@ohstpy.mps.ohio-state.edu.\n", "  The implications of precision $Z$ and $W$-pole and neutral current data for\ntesting the standard electroweak model, determining its parameters, and\nsearching for new physics, are described.\n", "  A recent development in finite temperature field theory, the so-called\nBraaten-Pisarski method, and its application to properties of a quark-gluon\nplasma, possibly formed in relativistic heavy ion collisions, are reviewed. In\nparticular parton damping rates, the energy loss of energetic partons,\nthermalization times, viscosity, and production and damping rates of hard\nphotons are discussed.\n", "  We discuss the direct measurement of the trilinear vector boson couplings in\npresent and future collider experiments. The major goals of such experiments\nwill be the confirmation of the Standard Model (SM) predictions and the search\nfor signals of new physics. We review our current theoretical understanding of\nanomalous trilinear gauge boson self-interactions. If the energy scale of the\nnew physics is $\\sim 1$ TeV, these low energy anomalous couplings are expected\nto be no larger than ${\\cal O}(10^{-2})$. Constraints from high precision\nmeasurements at LEP and low energy charged and neutral current processes are\ncritically reviewed.\n", "  In recent years, significant progress was reached in understanding of vacuum\nand hadronic structure. We review recent works on the {\\it point-to-point\ncorrelation functions}, comparing those obtained from phenomenology,\n``instanton liquid\" models and on the lattice. The second topic is physics of\nchiral symmetry restoration, which may lead to observable hadron modification\nand unusual event-per-event fluctuations. We discuss collective flow and\nphenomena related with a remarkable ``softness\" of the equation of state near\nthe phase transition, as well as phenomena at small $p_t$. We also describe\nrecent ideas on the mechanism of chiral restoration, based on formation of {\\it\npolarized instanton-antiinstanton molecules}. The third part, related to\nquark-gluon plasma, is related mainly with the issue of initial equilibration\nof QGP in high energy collisions. We discuss different ``parton cascade\"\napproaches and argue that {\\it multi-gluon} processes dominate them. We briefly\ndiscuss predictions for RHIC and LHC energies.\n", "  We analyze the manifestations of new matter particles predicted by models of\nnew physics beyond the Standard Model, at present and future high--energy\ncolliders. We consider both the production of these new particles and some of\ntheir indirect signatures at $pp$ and $eP$ colliders as well as TeV $\\ee$\ncolliders with their $\\ee, e \\gamma, \\gamma \\gamma$ and $e^- e^-$ modes. The\nreport is arranged into four main sections plus an overview. These sections\nwill deal separately with exotic and excited fermions, difermions, and new\ninteractions.\n", "  The discovery potential and diagnostic abilities of proposed future colliders\nfor new heavy neutral ($Z'$) and charged ($W'$) gauge bosons are summarized.\nTypical bounds achievable on $M_{Z',W'}$ at the TEVATRON, DI-TEVATRON, LHC, 500\nGeV NLC, and 1 TeV NLC are $\\sim$1~TeV, $\\sim$2~TeV, $\\sim$4~TeV, 1--3~TeV, and\n2--6~TeV, respectively. For $M_{Z'} \\sim$1 TeV the LHC will have the capability\nto determine the magnitude of normalized $Z'$ quark and lepton couplings to\naround $10-20\\%$, while the NLC would allow for determination of the couplings\n(including their signs) with a factor of 2 larger error-bars, provided heavy\nflavor tagging and longitudinal polarization of the electron beam is available.\n", "  We show on the basis of an effective theory of QCD that a wide variety of\nobservables in the hadron world is governed by the chiral symmetry together\nwith an interplay between the axial anomaly and the explicit symmetry breaking\ndue to the current quark mass. We also discuss the nature of the chiral\ntransition at finite temperature and related dynamical phenomena using the\neffective Lagrangian. Some phenomenological implications of the small vector\ncoupling (``vector limit'') at high temperatures are suggested.\n", "  In QCD with two massless quarks, the chiral phase transition is plausibly in\nthe same universality class as the classical O(4) magnet. To test this\nhypothesis, critical exponents characterizing the behaviour of universal\nquantities near the 2nd order critical point can be calculated and compared to\nresults from lattice simulations. Present simulations already allow many\nqualitative tests; quantitative tests await future simulations with longer\ncorrelation lengths. In a heavy ion collision, a long correlation length would\nlead to large fluctuations in the number ratio of neutral to charged pions.\nUnfortunately, no equilibrium correlation length gets long enough for this to\noccur. Modelling the dynamics of the chiral order parameter in a far from\nequilibrium transition by quenching in the linear sigma model suggests that\nlong wavelength modes of the pion field can be amplified. This could have\ndramatic phenomenological consequences. Theoretical advances include attempts\nto relax the quench approximation and to include expansion and quantum effects.\nLong wavelength pion oscillations arise in a number of theoretical treatments;\nhowever, all involve idealizations and are at best qualitative guides. It is up\nto experimentalists to determine whether such phenomena occur; detection in a\nheavy ion collision would imply an out of equilibrium chiral transition.\n", "  We discuss the motivations and implications of models of low-energy\nsupersymmetry. We present the case for the minimal supersymmetric standard\nmodel, which we define to include the minimal particle content and soft\nsupersymmetry-breaking interactions which are universal at the GUT or Planck\nscale. This model is in agreement with all present experimental results, and\nyet depends on only a few unknown parameters and therefore maintains\nconsiderable predictive power. From the theoretical side, it arises naturally\nin the context of supergravity models. We discuss radiative electroweak\nsymmetry breaking and the superpartner spectrum in this scenario, with some\nadded emphasis on regions of parameter space leading to unusual or interesting\nexperimental signals at future colliders. We then examine how these results may\nbe affected by various modifications and extensions of the minimal model,\nincluding GUT effects, extended gauge, Higgs, and matter sectors, non-universal\nsupersymmetry breaking, non-conservation of R-parity, and dynamical\nsupersymmetry breaking at low energies.\n", "  Numerical simulations of quantum chromodynamics at nonzero temperature\nprovide information from first principles about the physical properties of the\nquark gluon plasma. Because the lattice approximation can be refined\nindefinitely, results of lattice simulations now provide the most reliable\nbasis for our understanding of the nonperturbative characteristics of the\nplasma and of the high temperature phase transition. Following a brief overview\nof the methodology of lattice gauge theory at nonzero temperature, recent\nresults and insights from lattice simulations are discussed. These include our\nunderstanding of the phase diagram of QCD, the nature of the phase transition,\nand the structure of the plasma.\n", "  The Bethe-Salpeter (BS) equation for scalar-scalar bound states in scalar\ntheories without derivative coupling is formulated and solved in Minkowski\nspace. This is achieved using the perturbation theory integral representation\n(PTIR), which allows these amplitudes to be expressed as integrals over weight\nfunctions and known singularity structures and hence allows us to convert the\nBS equation into an integral equation involving weight functions. We obtain\nnumerical solutions using this formalism for a number of scattering kernels to\nillustrate the generality of the approach. It applies even when the na\\\"{\\i}ve\nWick rotation is invalid. As a check we verify, for example, that this method\napplied to the special case of the massive ladder exchange kernel reproduces\nthe same results as are obtained by Wick rotation.\n", "  It is shown that the semirelativistic $q \\bar{q}$ potential, the relativistic\nflux tube model and a confining Bethe--Salpeter equation can be derived from\nQCD first principles in a unified point of view.\n", "  We derive a confining $ q \\bar{q}$ Bethe--Salpeter equation starting from the\nsame assumptions on the Wilson loop integral already adopted in the derivation\nof a semirelativistic heavy quark potential. We show that, by standard\napproximations, an effective meson squared mass operator can be obtained from\nour BS kernel and that, from this, by ${1\\over m^2}$ expansion, the\ncorresponding Wilson loop potential is recovered, spin--dependent and\nvelocity--dependent terms included. We also show, that, on the contrary,\nneglecting spin--dependent terms, relativistic flux tube model is reproduced.\n", "  Julian Schwinger began the construction of Source Theory in 1966 in response\nto the then apparent failure of quantum field theory to describe strong\ninteractions, the physical remoteness of renormalization, and the utility of\neffective actions in describing chiral dynamics. I will argue that the source\ntheory development was not really so abrupt a break with the past as Julian may\nhave implied, for the ideas and techniques in large measure were present in his\nwork at least as early as 1951. Those techniques and ideas are still of\nfundamental importance to theoretical physics, so much so that the designation\n``source theory'' has become superfluous. Julian did a great deal of innovative\nphysics during the last 30 years of his life, and I will touch on some of the\nmajor themes. The impact of much of this work is not yet apparent. (Invited\ntalk at Washington APS/AAPT meeting)\n", "  Hot scalar electrodynamics is adopted as a toy model for a hot gluon plasma\nto display some aspects of the compulsory resummation of hard thermal loops\nwhen next-to-leading order quantities at soft momentum scales are to be\ncalculated. [Talk given by A.K.R. at a one-day meeting dedicated to the memory\nof Tanguy ALTHERR, held on November 4, 1994 at CERN, Geneva. To appear in a\nGedenkschrift published by World Scientific.]\n", "  We survey how quarkonia can be used to probe colour deconfinement in\nrelativistic nuclear collisions.\n", "  We describe long distance QCD by a dual theory in which the fundamental\nvariables are dual potentials coupled to monopole fields and use this dual\ntheory to determine the effective Lagrangian for constituent quarks. We find\nthe color field distribution surrounding a quark anti-quark pair to first order\nin their velocities. Using these distributions we eliminate the dual potentials\nand obtain an effective interaction Lagrangian $L_I ( \\vec x_1 \\, , \\vec x_2 \\,\n; \\vec v_1 \\, , \\vec v_2 )$ depending only upon the quark and anti-quark\ncoordinates and velocities, valid to second order in their velocities. We\npropose $ L_I $ as the Lagrangian describing the long distance interaction of\nconstituent quarks.\n", "  We study the properties of quarks, being confined in hadrons, with the\nSchwinger-Dyson equation in the dual Ginzburg-Landau Theory. Magnetic monopole\ncondensation, which provides quark confinement, is demonstrated responsible\nalso for dynamical chiral-symmetry breaking. We discuss then the recovery of\nthe chiral symmetry at finite temperature.\n", "  Nonperturbative QCD is studied with the dual Ginzburg-Landau theory, where\ncolor confinement is realized through the dual Higgs mechanism by QCD-monopole\ncondensation. We obtain a general analytic formula for the string tension. A\ncompact formula is derived for the screened inter-quark potential in the\npresence of light dynamical quarks. The QCD phase transition at finite\ntemperature is studied using the effective potential formalism. The string\ntension and the QCD-monopole mass are largely reduced near the critical\ntemperature, $T_c$. The surface tension is estimated from the effective\npotential at $T_c$. We propose also a new scenario of the quark-gluon-plasma\ncreation through the color-electric flux-tube annihilation. Finally, we discuss\na close relation between instantons and QCD-monopoles.\n", "  In a constituent quark model at nonzero temperature, the amplitude for $\\pi^0\n\\rightarrow 2 \\gamma$ vanishes in a chirally symmetric phase, while that for\n$\\pi^0 \\sigma \\rightarrow 2 \\gamma$ does not.\n", "  Phenomenology of a strongly-interacting electroweak symmetry breaking sector\nat current and future colliders is reviewed.\n", "  We review CP violation in various extensions of the electroweak sector of the\nStandard Model. A particular emphasis is put on supersymmetric models. We\ndescribe the two CP problems of supersymmetry, concerning $d_N$ and\n$\\epsilon_K$. We critically review the various mechanisms that have been\nsuggested to solve these problems: exact universality, approximate CP symmetry,\nalignment, approximate universality and heavy squarks. We explain how future\nmeasurements of CP violation will test these mechanisms. We describe extensions\nof the quark sector and their implications on CP asymmetries in neutral B\ndecays, on the $K_L \\to \\pi \\nu \\bar\\nu$ decay and on $\\Delta\\Gamma(B_s)$. We\ndiscuss CP violation in charged scalar exchange in models with natural flavor\nconservation and explain how transverse lepton polarization in meson decays can\nprobe such models. CP violation in neutral scalar exchange arises in models of\nhorizontal symmetries and may be manifest in heavy quark (b and t) physics. We\ndescribe the implications of Left-Right Symmetric models on $d_N$,\n$\\epsilon_K$, $\\epsilon'/\\epsilon$ and CP asymmetries in B decays. Finally, we\nbriefly discuss the potential of future measurements of CP violation to\ndiscover New Physics.\n", "  We review the present theoretical and experimental status of heavy quark\nproduction in high-energy collisions. In particular, we cover hadro- and\nphotoproduction at fixed target experiments, at HERA and at the hadron\ncolliders, as well as aspects of heavy quark production in e+e- collisions at\nthe Z0 peak.\n", "  We review the theory and phenomenology of heavy-quark symmetry, exclusive\nweak decays of B mesons, inclusive decay rates and lifetimes of b hadrons.\n", "  After reviewing briefly the upper bounds on the mass of the lightest Higgs\nboson in the most general unconstrained minimal supersymmetric extension of the\nStandard Model, we discuss various arguments which reduce the parameter space\nof the model and give stronger predictions for $M_{h^0}$. First, the\nconstraints from the presently available experimental data are summarized.\nNext, the role of of several additional theoretical assumptions is studied,\nafter extrapolating the model to high energy scales. The most important ones\nare: perturbative validity up to the GUT scale and the electroweak symmetry\nbreaking. A Higgs boson with $M_{h^0}<$100 GeV is predicted in several\nscenarios. Its absence in that mass range will have important implications for\nthe parameter space of the model.\n", "  We consider the phenomenology of the Standard Model intermediate mass Higgs\nboson, $71 GeV < M_h < 2 M_W$. The motivation for a Higgs boson in this mass\nregion is emphasized. The branching ratios for the Higgs boson, including\nelectroweak and QCD radiative corrections, are presented, along with production\ncross sections for $e^+e^-, \\mu^+\\mu^-, \\gamma\\gamma$, and hadronic\ninteractions. Search strategies are surveyed briefly.\n", "  We review the constraints on Higgs boson properties from effective potential\nmethods. In the Standard Model, the requirement of stability (or metastability)\nof the standard electroweak minimum puts an upper bound on the scale of new\nphysics as a function of the Higgs mass. This upper bound is below the Planck\nscale if the Higgs weights $\\simlt$ 130 GeV. In supersymmetric extensions of\nthe Standard Model the former methods are useful to compute the Higgs mass\nspectrum, and couplings, after resumming higher loop effects. In particular, if\nthe Higgs mass weights $\\simgt$ 130 GeV, the minimal supersymmetric extension\nof the Standard Model will be ruled out, while its non-minimal supersymmetric\nextension containing singlets is only marginally allowed.\n", "  We consider Flavour Changing Neutral Current processes in the framework of\nthe supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model. FCNC constraints on the\nstructure of sfermion mass matrices are reviewed. Furthermore, we analyze\nsupersymmetric contributions to FCNC transitions which remain in the limit of\nflavour-conserving sfermion mass matrices. Implications of the FCNC constraints\non the structure of sfermion mass matrices for SUSY breaking and sfermion mass\ngeneration are discussed. We conclude that the supersymmetric flavour problem\nis intriguing but perhaps not as severe as it is commonly believed.\n", "  Electroweak Baryogenesis is a particularly attractive theoretical scenario,\nsince it relies on physics which can be tested at present high energy collider\nfacilities. Within the Standard Model, it has been shown that the requirement\nof preserving the baryon number generated at the weak scale leads to strong\nbounds on the Higgs mass, which are already inconsistent with the present\nexperimental limits. In the Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the Standard\nModel we demonstrate that light stop effects can render the electroweak phase\ntransition sufficiently strongly first order, opening the possibility of\nelectroweak baryogenesis for values of the Higgs mass at the LEP2 reach. The\ngeneration of the observed baryon asymmetry also requires small chargino masses\nand new CP-violating phases associated with the stop and Higgsino mass\nparameters. We discuss the direct experimental tests of this scenario and other\nrelevant phenomenological issues related to it.\n", "  We review the highlights of quark mixing, particle-antiparticle mixing, CP\nviolation and rare K- and B-decays in the Standard Model. The top quark\ndiscovery, the precise measurement of its mass, the improved knowledge of the\ncouplings $V_{cb}$ and $V_{ub}$, and the calculations of NLO short distance QCD\ncorrections improved considerably the predictions for various decay rates, the\ndetermination of the couplings $V_{td}$ and $V_{ts}$ and of the complex phase\nin the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix. After presenting the general\ntheoretical framework for weak decays, we discuss the following topics in\ndetail: i) the CKM matrix, its most convenient parametrizations and the\nunitarity triangle, ii) the CP-violating parameter $\\epsilon_K$ and\n$B^0_{d,s}-\\bar B^0_{d,s}$ mixings, iii) the ratio $\\epsilon'/\\epsilon$, iv)\nthe rare K-decays $K_L\\to\\pi^0e^+e^-$, $K^+\\to\\pi^+\\nu\\bar\\nu$,\n$K_L\\to\\pi^0\\nu\\bar\\nu$ and $K_L\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-$, v) the radiative decays $B\\to\nX_s\\gamma$ and $B\\to X_s l^+l^-$, vi) the rare B-decays $B\\to\nX_{s,d}\\nu\\bar\\nu$ and $B_{d,s}\\to l^+l^-$, vii) CP violation in neutral and\ncharged B-decays putting emphasis on clean determinations of the angles of the\nunitarity triangle, and viii) the role of electroweak penguins in B-decays. We\npresent several future visions demonstrating very clearly the great potential\nof CP asymmetries in B-decays and of clean K-decays such as $K^+\\to\\pi^+\\nu\n\\bar\\nu$ and $K_L\\to\\pi^0\\nu\\bar\\nu$ in the determination of the CKM parameters\nand in decisive testing of the Standard Model. An outlook for the coming years\nends our review.\n", "  The pure leptonic or semileptonic character of tau decays makes them a good\nlaboratory to test the structure of the weak currents and the universality of\ntheir couplings to the gauge bosons. The hadronic tau decay modes constitute an\nideal tool for studying low-energy effects of the strong interactions in very\nclean conditions; a well-known example is the precise determination of the QCD\ncoupling from tau-decay data. New physics phenomena, such as a non-zero\ntau-neutrino mass or violations of (flavour / CP) conservation laws can also be\nsearched for with tau decays.\n", "  I review the ability of the LHC (large hadron collider), NLC (next linear\nlepton collider) and FMC (first muon collider) to detect and study Higgs\nbosons, with emphasis on the Higgs bosons of extended Higgs sectors, especially\nthose of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM). Particular attention\nis given to means for distinguishing the lightest neutral CP-even Higgs boson\nof the MSSM from the single Higgs boson of the minimal Standard Model (SM).\n", "  We present a detailed study of non-leptonic two-body decays of B mesons based\non a generalized factorization hypothesis. We discuss the structure of\nnon-factorizable corrections and present arguments in favour of a simple\nphenomenological description of their effects. To evaluate the relevant\ntransition form factors in the factorized decay amplitudes, we use information\nextracted from semileptonic decays and incorporate constraints imposed by\nheavy-quark symmetry. We discuss tests of the factorization hypothesis and show\nhow unknown decay constants may be determined from non-leptonic decays. In\nparticular, we find f_{Ds}=(234+-25) MeV and f_{Ds*}=(271+-33) MeV.\n", "  CP-violating effects in non-leptonic $B_s$-meson decays are reviewed. Special\nemphasis is given to implications arising from the width difference\n$\\Delta\\Gamma_s$ between the $B_s$ mass eigenstates. If $\\Delta\\Gamma_s$ is\nfound to be sizable, certain untagged $B_s$-meson decays may allow interesting\nprobes of CP violation, extractions of the CKM angle $\\gamma$ and the\nWolfenstein parameter $\\eta$, and may indicate physics beyond the Standard\nModel.\n", "  The aspon model spontaneously breaks CP symmetry and makes qualitatively\ndifferent predictions for CP asymmetries in B decay from the KM mechanism of\nthe Standard Model. It further predicts the existence of the aspon gauge boson\nand of heavy long-lived quarks, both lying below 1TeV in mass.\n", "  We consider $B^{\\pm,0} \\to \\rho^0(\\omega)h^{\\pm,0}$, where $\\rho^0(\\omega)$\ndecays to $\\pi^+\\pi^-$ and $h$ is any hadronic final state, such as $\\pi$ or\n$K$. We find a large direct CP asymmetry in B-meson decays via $\\rho \\omega$\ninterference. A possible method to determine weak phases, such as $\\phi_{2,3}$,\nis discussed. The experimental feasibility is also shown.\n", "  We propose a new method to extract the value of |Vtd/Vts| from the ratio of\nthe decay distributions dBr/ds[B->Xd l^+ l^-}] and dBr/ds[B Xs l^+ l^-].\n", "  Non-leptonic two-body decays are discussed on the basis of a generalized\nfactorization approach. It is shown that a satisfactory description of numerous\ndecay processes can be given using the same two parameters a_1^{eff} and\na_2^{eff}. Although in general process-dependent, these parameters are not\nexpected to change markedly. In fact, within error limits, there is no evidence\nfor a process dependence in energetic B-decays. The success of factorization\nallows the determination of decay constants from non-leptonic decays. For the\nD_s meson one obtains f_{D_s}=(234\\pm25) MeV, for the D^*_s meson\nf_{D_s^*}=(271\\pm33) MeV. The ratio a_2^{eff}/a_1^{eff} is positive in B-decays\nand negative in D-decays corresponding to constructive and destructive\ninterference in B^- and D^+ decays, respectively. Qualitatively, this can be\nunderstood considering the different scales or \\alpha_s-values governing the\ninteraction among the outgoing quarks. The running of \\alpha_s is also the\ncause of the observed strong increase of the amplitude of lowest isospin when\ngoing to low energy transitions.\n", "  Phenomenological CP-violating parameters in decays of neutral B-mesons are\ndiscussed with special attention to the degree of their measurability.\nImportant role of the sign of \\Delta m_B is emphasized. We briefly describe how\nit could be determined experimentally.\n", "  A brief description is given of BTeV a proposed program at the Fermilab\ncollider sited at the C0 intersection region. The main goals are measurement of\nmixing, CP violation and rare decays in both the $b$ and charm systems. The\ndetector is a two arm forward-backward spectrometer capable of triggering on\ndetached vertices and dileptons, and possessing excellent particle\nidentification, electron, photon and muon detection.\n", "  This summary of the 2nd International Conference on B Physics and CP\nViolation (Honolulu, 24--27 March, 1997) contains, in addition to what is\nimplied in the title, some extended remarks on the limitations of theory as\nwell as speculations regarding nonperturbative enhancement of decay modes of\nthe class b -> s + charmless hadrons.\n", "  Measurements of the polarization of the lepton and D* in the exclusive\nsemileptonic B decays, B to D l nu and B to D* l nu, can be used to separate\nand identify the non-standard model sources of T violation. These T-odd\neffects, estimated in both supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric models, could\nbe within the reach of the planned B factories.\n", "  To provide focus to my review of charm theory at the B-Physics and\nCP-Violation conference, I consider theoretical issues related to possible\ncharm studies at B-factories. A few topics of interest to the author are\nstressed -- rare decays, CP-violating asymmetries and ${\\bar D}^0 - D^0$\nmixing.\n", "  We review the origin of soft supersymmetry-breaking terms in N=1 supergravity\nmodels of particle physics. We first consider general formulae for those terms\nin general models with a hidden sector breaking supersymmetry at an\nintermediate energy scale. The results for some simple models are given. We\nthen consider the results obtained in some simple superstring models in which\nparticular assumptions about the origin of supersymmetry breaking are made.\nThese are models in which the seed of supersymmetry breaking is assumed to be\noriginated in the dilaton/moduli sector of the theory.\n", "  A critical review of the theoretical understanding of the lifetimes of beauty\nhadrons is given. A model-independent analysis using the heavy-quark expansion\nallows for a description of the lifetime ratios tau(B-)/tau(B0) and\ntau(Lambda_b)/tau(B0) in a small region of parameter space. It is demonstrated\nthat the lifetime ratio tau(B-)/tau(B0) cannot be used to extract the decay\nconstant of the B meson. Implications for the semileptonic branching ratio and\ncharm yield in B decays are pointed out.\n", "  In this talk I will discuss the extraction of the CKM angle $\\gamma$ at\nB-factories through the interference of the subprocesses $B^-\\to K^- D^0$ and\n$B^- \\to K^-\\bar D^0$. This seemingly impossible interference may be\naccomplished by allowing both $D^0$ and $\\bar D^0$ to decay to a common final\nstate. If only CP eigenstate decay modes of the $D$ are considered, the\nbranching ratio for $B^- \\to \\bar D^0 K^-$ must be experimentally I describe\nwhy this determination is likely to be experimentally impossible. On the other\nhand, if more general $D$ decays are considered, the angle $\\gamma$ may then be\ndetermined. In fact, it is possible that a reasonable determination of $\\gamma$\nmay be made with O(10^8) B's.\n", "  We make a systematic analysis of the effects of new physics in the B decay\namplitudes on the CP asymmetries in neutral B decays. Although these are\nexpected to be smaller than new physics effects on the mixing amplitude, they\nare easier to probe in some cases. The effects of new contributions to the\nmixing amplitude are felt universally across all decay modes, whereas the\neffects of new decay amplitudes could vary from mode to mode. In particular the\nprediction that the CP asymmetries in the B decay modes with $b\\to c\\bar c s$,\n$b \\to c\\bar c d$, $ b\\to c \\bar u d$ and $ b\\to s \\bar s s$ should all measure\nthe same quantity (sin(2\\beta) in the Standard Model) could be violated.\n", "  The definitions and properties of elastic and inelastic Isgur-Wise form\nfactors are reviewed. The nature of the \"missing\" exclusive semi-leptonic decay\nfraction is identified. The role that completeness sum rules play in relating\nform factors, spectroscopy, and model building is outlined.\n", "  I discuss the theory of heavy baryon spectroscopy, emphasizing predictions\nwhich follow from light and heavy quark symmetries.\n", "  I briefly discuss the derivation of dispersive sum rules constraining\nsemileptonic form-factors. I outline the use of these constraints in the\ncontext of charmless semileptonic decays and suggest how, in combination with\nother theoretical and experimental information, they may reduce the\nuncertainties in the extraction of $V_{ub}$.\n", "  We review the status of heavy neutral gauge bosons, Z', with emphasis on\nconstraints that arise in supersymmetric models, especially those motivated\nfrom superstring compactifications. We first summarize the current\nphenomenological constraints and the prospects for Z' detection and diagnostics\nat the LHC and NLC. After elaborating on the status and (lack of) predictive\npower for general models with an additional Z', we concentrate on motivations\nand successes for Z' physics in supersymmetric theories in general and in a\nclass of superstring models in particular. We review phenomenologically viable\nscenarios with the Z' mass in the electroweak or in the intermediate scale\nregion.\n", "  We review the loop effects of the low energy supersymmetry. The global\nsuccess of the Standard Model rises two related questions: how strongly the\nmass scales of the superpartners are constrained and can they be, nevertheless,\nindirectly seen in precision measurements. The bulk of the electroweak data is\nwell screened from supersymmetric loop effects, due to the structure of the\ntheory, even with superpartners generically light, $O(M_Z)$. The only exception\nare the left-handed squarks of the third generation which have to be $\\simgt\nO(300$ GeV) to maintain the success of the SM. The other superpartners can\nstill be light, at their present experimental mass limits, and would manifest\nthemselves through virtual corrections to the small number of observables such\nas $R_b, b \\to s\\gamma, K^0-\\bar K^0$ and $B^0-\\bar B^0$ mixing and a few more\nfor large $tan\\beta$. Those effects require still higher experimental precision\nto be detectable.\n", "  The electric dipole moment of the muon ($d_\\mu$) is evaluated in a two Higgs\ndoublet model with a softly broken discrete symmetry. For $\\tan\\beta \\equiv\n|v_2|/|v_1| \\sim 1$, contributions from two loop diagrams involving the $t$\nquark and the $W$ boson dominate; while for $\\tan\\beta \\gsim 10$, contributions\nfrom two loop diagrams involving the $b$ quark and the $\\tau$ lepton are\ndominant. For $8 \\gsim \\tan\\beta \\gsim 4$, significant cancellation occurs\namong the contributions from two loop diagrams and the one loop contribution\ndominates for $\\tan\\beta \\sim 7$. For $\\tan\\beta \\gsim 15$, the calculated\n$d_\\mu$ can be close to the reach of a recently proposed experiment at the\nBrookhaven National Laboratory.\n", "  We give a summary about the various contributions which have to be calculated\nin order to obtain the next-to-leading logarithmic result for the branching\nratio $BR(B \\to X_s \\gamma)$. Combining all these ingredients, which were\nobtained by different groups, a complete next-to-leading-logarithmic prediction\nof the inclusive decay rate was recently presented in the literature. The\ntheoretical uncertainty in the partonic decay rate is now at the 10% level,\ni.e., less than half of the error in the previous leading-logarithmic result.\nWe also mention the impact of non-perturbative corrections which scale like\n$1/m_b^2$ and discuss in some more detail the recently discovered corrections\nwhich scale like $1/m_c^2$. It turns out that the $1/m_b^2$- and the $1/m_c^2$\nterms lead to corrections to the branching ratio $BR(B \\to X_s \\gamma)$ well\nbelow the 10% level.\n", "  Our analysis suggests that the charmless yield in B decays is enhanced over\ntraditional estimates. The c c.bar pair produced in b to c c.bar transitions\nmay be seen significantly as light hadrons due to non-perturbative effects.\nExisting data samples at Upsilon(4S) and Z^0 factories allow key measurements\nwhich are outlined.\n", "  The development of supergravity unified models and their implications for\ncurrent and future experiments are discussed.\n", "  The odderon singularity is studied in perturbative QCD in the framework of\nthe Bartels-Kwieci\\'nski-Praszalowicz (BKP) equation. Arguments for the odderon\nintercept being exactly equal to unity are given. Besides, a variational method\nbased on a complete system of one-gluon functions is presented. For the\nodderon, the highest intercept calculated by this method is\n$1-(N_c\\alpha_{s}/\\pi) 0.45$. Comparison to other calculations is shown.\n", "  In this talk we discuss rare B decays (b -> s gamma, b -> s g, b -> s l^+\nl^-), B-\\bar{B} oscillations and CP violation in B physics in the context of\nlow-energy SUSY. We outline the variety of predictions that arise according to\nthe choice of the SUSY extension ranging from what we call the \"minimal\"\nversion of the MSSM to models without flavour universality or with broken\nR-parity. In particular, we provide a model-independent parameterization of the\nSUSY FCNC and CP-violating effects which is useful in tackling the problem in\ngeneric low-energy SUSY. We show how rare B decays and CP violation in B-decay\namplitudes may be complementary to direct SUSY searches at colliders, in\nparticular for what concerns extensions of the most restrictive version of the\nMSSM.\n", "  This talk summarized the proof of hard-scattering factorization for exclusive\ndeep-inelastic processes, such as diffractive meson production.\n", "  I provide a pedagogical introduction to supersymmetry. The level of\ndiscussion is aimed at readers who are familiar with the Standard Model and\nquantum field theory, but who have had little or no prior exposure to\nsupersymmetry. Topics covered include: motivations for supersymmetry, the\nconstruction of supersymmetric Lagrangians, superspace and superfields, soft\nsupersymmetry-breaking interactions, the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model\n(MSSM), R-parity and its consequences, the origins of supersymmetry breaking,\nthe mass spectrum of the MSSM, decays of supersymmetric particles, experimental\nsignals for supersymmetry, and some extensions of the minimal framework.\n", "  The concept of resolved virtual photons in addition to direct deep inelastic\n$ep$ scattering is used to simulate the 2+1 jet - rate and the forward jet\ncross section, which cannot be described by direct LO/NLO processes. With\nstandard DGLAP evolution of the parton densities of the virtual photon and the\nproton the HERA data can be described, provided a sufficiently large scale for\nthe hard scattering matrix element is used.\n", "  We outline the existing descriptions of the charm component of the deep\ninelastic proton structure function F2. We discuss recent approaches to include\ncharm mass effects in the parton evolution equations and the coefficient\nfunctions.\n", "  The \"triple-Regge\" analysis of subleading Reggeon contributions to the\ndiffractive structure function in DIS at HERA is presented. The recently\npublished data allow to estimate the only free parameter of the analysis\nrelated to the ratio of the RRP and PPP couplings. The large value of this\nratio is prefered which is in agreement with analyses of soft hadronic\ninteractions. The role of the subleading Reggeons as well as pions for the fast\nforward neutron production in diffractive processes is estimated. The forward\npiN state production is also discussed.\n", "  In the present talk diffraction in deep inelastic scattering is discussed in\nthe framework of the semiclassical approach. The main emphasis is on the\npossibility of a consistent semiclassical description of both hard and soft\ncolour singlet exchange processes. This approach allows the comparison of hard\nand soft colour neutralization in diffractive electroproduction of\nhigh-$p_\\perp$ jets or heavy quarks.\n", "  Using the dipole picture describing the $1/N_C$ limit of QCD at small $x$ and\nthe conformal invariance properties of the BFKL kernel in transverse coordinate\nspace, we show that the 1->p dipole densities can be expressed in terms of dual\nShapiro-Virasoro amplitudes B_{2p+2} and their generalization including\nnon-zero conformal spins. We discuss the possibility of an effective closed\nstring theory of interacting QCD dipoles.\n", "  This talks examines the effect of angular ordering on the small-x evolution\nof the unintegrated gluon distribution, and discusses the characteristic\nfunction for the CCFM equation.\n", "  We argue that a Standard Model decoupling limit is generically the necessary\ningredient which makes scenarios of electro-weak symmetry breaking viable. This\napplies especially also to models of dynamical electro-weak symmetry breaking.\nAdditional requirements are only that the mass predictions of a given model\n(e.g. predictions or theoretical limits on the Higgs or top mass) are\nconsistent with existing data. We discuss the necessary ingredients for\ndynamical symmetry breaking and present a dynamically broken\nleft-right-symmetric model as an example. The model exhibits such a decoupling\nlimit, is phenomenologically viable and leads to interesting mass predictions\nand relations which are further examined.\n", "  We compute the onium-onium scattering amplitude at fixed impact parameter in\nthe framework of the perturbative QCD dipole model. Relying on the conformal\nproperties of the dipole cascade and of the elementary dipole-dipole scattering\namplitude, we obtain an exact result for this onium-onium scattering amplitude,\nwhich is proved to be identical to the BFKL result, and which is frame\ninvariant. The asymptotic expression for this amplitude at fixed impact\nparameter agrees with previous numerical simulations.\n", "  We discuss how to experimentally study the electroweak symmetry breaking\n(EWSB) sector by observing $WW \\to WW$ interactions in the TeV region. We\ndiscuss some general features of the event structure in the signal and the\nbackground events. Various techniques to enhance the signal-to-background ratio\nare also presented. We show how to detect longitudinal W-bosons either in the\ncentral rapidity region of the detector or in the beam pipe direction. Finally,\nwe globally classify the sensitivities of the Large Hadron Collider and the\nLinear Colliders to probing the next-to-leading order bosonic operators of the\nelectroweak chiral lagrangian used to parametrize models of strongly coupled\nEWSB sector.\n", "  We discuss the prospect of studying physics at short distances, such as\nPlanck length or GUT scale, using supersymmetry as a probe. Supersymmetry\nbreaking parameters contain information on all physics below the scale where\nthey are induced. We will gain insights into grand unification (or in some\ncases string theory) and its symmetry breaking pattern combining measurements\nof gauge coupling constants, gaugino masses and scalar masses. Once the\nsuperparticle masses are known, it removes the main uncertainty in the analysis\nof proton decay, flavor violation and electric dipole moments. We will be able\nto discuss the consequence of flavor physics at short distances quantitatively.\n", "  Applications of QCD sum rules to exclusive decays of heavy mesons are\nreviewed. In detail, we discuss the calculations of the B and $D$ decay\nconstants, the heavy-to-light form factors $f^+(p^2)$ and $f^0(p^2)$, and the\nstrong couplings $g_{B^*B\\pi}$ and $g_{D^*D\\pi}$. Predictions are presented for\nthe semileptonic weak decays $B \\to \\pi \\bar{l} \\nu_l$ and $B \\to \\rho \\bar{l}\n\\nu_l$, and used to extract $V_{ub}$ from the measured decay widths. Results\nare also shown on $D \\to \\pi \\bar{l} \\nu_l$ and $D^* \\to D \\pi$. Furthermore,\nwe reconsider the factorization hypothesis in nonleptonic two-body decays, and\ndescribe a sum rule estimate of the nonfactorizable contribution to the\namplitude of $B \\to J/\\psi K$.\n", "  While internal space-time symmetries of relativistic particles are dictated\nby the little groups of the Poincar\\'e group, it is possible to construct\nrepresentations of the little group for massive particles starting from\nharmonic oscillator wave functions for the quark model. The resulting\noscillator wave functions are covariant and can be Lorentz-boosted. It is thus\npossible to obtain the parton model by boosting the quark model. A review of\nWigner's theory of the little groups is given. It is shown that the covariant\noscillator wave functions become squeezed as as the system becomes boosted. It\nis shown also that the Lorentz-squeezed quark distribution exhibits the\npeculiarities of Feynman's parton model including the lack of coherence in the\ncalculation of cross sections. A historical review of the concept of covariance\nis given.\n", "  Potential hints for New Physics enhanced b -> sg dipole operators are\nreviewed. Implications for inclusive kaon spectra, and corrresponding search\nstrategies are discussed. Remarkably, all B meson rare decay constraints can be\nevaded. Large CP asymmetries are expected if new contributions to the dipole\noperators contain non-trivial weak phases. A critical comparison of eta'\nproduction in the Standard Model and in models with enhanced b -> sg is\npresented. A Standard Model explanation of the large B -> eta' Xs rate measured\nby CLEO poses a challenge, evidently requiring novel non-perturbative order of\nmagnitude enhancement of gluon anomaly mediated contributions. However, in the\ncase of enhanced b -> sg the existence of a cocktail solution is very likely.\n", "  We show that large SUSY phases have no significant effect on the relic\ndensity of the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). However, they are very\nsignificant for the detection rates. We emphasise that the phase of the\ntrilinear coupling increase the direct and indirect detection rates.\n", "  Physical scenarios, leading to highly energetic stochastic gravitational\nwaves backgrounds (for frequencies ranging from the $\\mu$Hz up to the GHz) are\nexamined. In some cases the typical amplitude of the logarithmic energy\nspectrum can be even eight orders of magnitude larger than the ordinary\ninflationary prediction. Scaling violations in the frequency dependence of the\nenergy density of the produced gravitons are discussed.\n", "  We review some aspects of moduli in string theory. We argue that one should\nfocus on {\\it approximate moduli spaces}, and that there is evidence that such\nspaces exist non-perturbatively. We ask what it would mean for string theory to\npredict low energy supersymmetry. Aspects of two proposed mechanisms for fixing\nthe moduli are discussed, and solutions to certain cosmological problems\nassociated with moduli are proposed.\n", "  Non-supersymmetric black holes carrying both electric and magnetic charge\nwith respect to a single Kaluza-Klein gauge field have much in common with\nsupersymmetric black holes. Angular momentum conservation and other general\nphysics principles underlies some of their basic features. Kaluza-Klein black\nholes are interpreted in string theory as bound states of D6-branes and\nD0-branes. The microscopic theory reproduces the full nonlinear mass formula of\nthe extremal black holes.\n", "  I contemplate the possibility that the mismatch between the maximally\nsymmetric point (the free fermionic point) and the strictly self-dual point in\nthe Narain moduli space plays a role in the string vacuum selection. The role\nof self-duality in the recent formulation of quantum mechanics from an\nequivalence postulate, and the new perspective that it offers on the\nfoundations of quantum gravity and the origin of mass, are discussed.\n", "  We discuss spacetime singularity resolution in the context of the\ngravity/gauge correspondence, for brane systems which give rise to gauge\ntheories with eight supercharges and no hypermultiplets. The discussion is\naimed at non-experts. Writeup of talk on hep-th/9911161 with C.V.Johnson and\nJ.Polchinski, given in various forms at: PASCOS-99, Aspen winter conference\n`Way Beyond the Standard Models', Banff CIAR Gravity+Cosmology Programme\nMeeting.\n", "  The presence of cosmological perturbations affects the background metric and\nmatter configuration in which the perturbations propagate. This effect, studied\na long time ago for gravitational waves, also is operational for scalar\ngravitational fluctuations, inhomogeneities which are believed to be more\nimportant in inflationary cosmology. The back-reaction of fluctuations can be\ndescribed by an effective energy-momentum tensor. The issue of coordinate\ninvariance makes the analysis more complicated for scalar fluctuations than for\ngravitational waves. We show that the back-reaction of fluctuations can be\ndescribed in a diffeomorphism-invariant way. In an inflationary cosmology, the\nback-reaction is dominated by infrared modes. We show that these modes give a\ncontribution to the effective energy-momentum tensor of the form of a negative\ncosmological constant whose absolute value grows in time. We speculate that\nthis may lead to a self-regulating dynamical relaxation mechanism for the\ncosmological constant. This scenario would naturally lead to a finite remnant\ncosmological constant with a magnitude corresponding to $\\Omega_{\\Lambda} \\sim\n1$.\n", "  We briefly review the history and current status of models of particle\ninteractions in which massless mediators are given, not by fundamental gauge\nfields as in the Standard Model, but by composite degrees of freedom of\nfermionic systems. Such models generally require the breaking of Lorentz\ninvariance. We describe schemes in which the photon and the graviton emerge as\nGoldstone bosons from the breaking of Lorentz invariance, as well as\ngeneralizations of the quantum Hall effect in which composite excitations yield\nmassless particles of all integer spins. While these schemes are of limited\ninterest for the photon (spin 1), in the case of the graviton (spin 2) they\noffer a possible solution to the long-standing UV problem in quantum linear\ngravity.\n", "  We obtain the propagators for spin 1/2 fermions and sfermions in\nLorentz-violating supergravity.\n", "  The divergence structure of supergravity has long been a topic of concern\nbecause of the theory's non-renormalizability. In the context of string theory,\nwhere perturbative finiteness should be achieved, the supergravity counterterm\nstructures remain nonetheless of importance because they still occur, albeit\nwith finite coefficients. The leading nonvanishing supergravity counterterms\nhave a particularly rich structure that has a bearing on the preservation of\nsupersymmetry in string vacua in the presence of perturbative string\ncorrections. Although the holonomy of such manifolds is deformed by the\ncorrections, a Killing spinor structure nevertheless can persist. The\nintegrability conditions for the existence of such Killing spinors remarkably\nremain consistent with the perturbed effective field equations.\n", "  We discuss the interpertation of the $c=1$ matrix model as two-dimensional\nstring theory in a dilaton-black hole background. The nonperturbative\nformulation of $c=1$ matrix model in terms of an integrable model of\nnonrelativistic fermions enables us to study the quantum fate of the classical\nblack hole singularity. We find that the classical singularity is wiped out by\nquantum corrections when summed to all orders.\n", "  Some old and new evidence for the existence of the string (planar random\nsurfaces) representation of multicolour QCD are reviewed. They concern the\nrandom surface representation of the strong coupling expansion in lattice\nmulticolour gauge theory in any dimension. Our old idea of modified strong\ncoupling expansion in terms of planar random surfaces, valid for the physical\nweak coupling phase of the four-dimensional QCD, is explained in detail. Some\nchecks of the validity of this expansion are proposed. (The lectures given in\nthe Trieste Spring School and Workshop-1993 on String Theory).\n", "  We review some aspects of the relation between ordinary coherent states and\nq-deformed generalized coherent states with some of the simplest cases of\nquantum Lie algebras. In particular, new properties of (q-)coherent states are\nutilized to provide a path integral formalism allowing to study a modified form\nof q-classical mechanics, to probe some geometrical consequences of the\nq-deformation and finally to construct Bargmann complex analytic realizations\nfor some quantum algebras.\n", "  Lectures presented at the Spring School, Trieste, Italy 1993.\n", "  We present a review of the status of $W$ string theories, their physical\nspectra, and their interactions. (Based on review talks given at the Trieste\nSpring Workshop, and the Strings 93 meeting at Berkeley, May 1993.)\n", "  We construct a class of quantum mechanical theories which are invariant under\nfermionic transformations similar to supersymmetry transformations. The\ngenerators of the transformations in this case, however, satisfy a BRST-like\nalgebra.\n", "  I render the substance of the discussions I had with Robert E. Marshak\nshortly before his death, wherein the kinship between the ``neutrino paradigm''\n---espoused by Marshak--- and the central notion of K-cycle in noncommutative\ngeometry (NCG) was found. In that context, we give a brief account of the\nConnes--Lott reconstruction of the Standard Model (SM).\n", "  I discuss recent progress in our understanding of two barriers in quantum\ngravity: $c > 1$ in the case of 2d quantum gravity and $D > 2$ in the case of\nEuclidean Einstein-Hilbert gravity formulated in space-time dimensions $D >2$.\n", "  Aspects of the monopole condensation picture of confinement are discussed.\nFirst, the nature of the monopole singularities in the abelian projection\napproach is analysed. Their apparent gauge dependence is shown to have a\nnatural interpretation in terms of 't~Hooft-Polyakov-like monopoles in\neuclidean SU(2) gauge theory. Next, the results and predictions of a\nrealization of confinement through condensation of such monopoles are\nsummarized and compared with numerical data.\n", "  We analyze topological objects in pure QCD in the presence of external quarks\nby calculating the distributions of instanton and monopole densities around\nstatic color sources. We find a suppression of the densities close to external\nsources and the formation of a flux tube between a static quark--antiquark\npair. The similarity in the behavior of instantons and monopoles around static\nsources might be due to a local correlation between these topological objects.\nOn an $8^{3} \\times 4$ lattice at $\\beta=5.6$, it turns out that topological\nquantities are correlated approximately two lattice spacings.\n", "  In this paper I review the multiplet calculus of $N = 1$, $D = 1$ local\nsupersymmetry with applications to the construction of models for spinning\nparticles in background fields, and models with space-time supersymmetry. New\nfeatures include a non-linear realization of the local supersymmetry algebra\nand the coupling to anti-symmetric tensor fields of both odd and even rank. The\nnon-linear realization allows the construction of a $D = 1$\ncosmological-constant term, which provides a mass term in the equations of\nmotion.\n", "  We review some of our recent results concerning the relationship between the\nReal-Space Renormalization Group method and Quantum Groups. We show this\nrelation by applying real-space RG methods to study two quantum group invariant\nHamiltonians, that of the XXZ model and the Ising model in a transverse field\n(ITF) defined in an open chain with appropriate boundary terms. The quantum\ngroup symmetry is preserved under the RG transformation except for the\nappearence of a quantum group anomalous term which vanishes in the classical\ncase. This is called {\\em the quantum group anomaly}. We derive the new qRG\nequations for the XXZ model and show that the RG-flow diagram obtained in this\nfashion exhibits the correct line of critical points that the exact model has.\nIn the ITF model the qRG-flow equations coincide with the tensor product\ndecomposition of cyclic irreps of $SU_q(2)$ with $q^4=1$.\n", "  We briefly review models of relativistic particles with spin. Departing from\nthe oldest attempts to describe the spin within the lagrangian framework we\npass through various non supersymmetric models. Then the component and\nsuperfield formulations of the spinning particle and superparticle models are\nreviewed. Our focus is mainly on the classical side of the problem, but some\nquantization questions are mentioned as well.\n", "  Recently it was shown that an asymptotic behaviour of $SU(N)$ gauge theory\nfor large $N$ is described by q-deformed quantum field. The master fields for\nlarge N theories satisfy to standard equations of relativistic field theory but\nfields satisfy $q$-deformed commutation relations with $q=0$. These commutation\nrelations are realized in the Boltzmannian Fock space. The master field for\ngauge theory does not take values in a finite-dimensional Lie algebra however\nthere is a non-Abelian gauge symmetry. The gauge master field for a subclass of\nplanar diagrams, so called half-planar diagrams, is also considered. A\nrecursive set of master fields summing up a matreoshka of 2-particles reducible\nplanar diagrams is briefly described.\n", "  This is an introductory review on the eleven-dimensional description of the\nBPS bound states of type II superstring theories, and on the role of\nsupermembranes in M-theory. The first part describes classical solutions of 11d\nsupergravity which upon dimensional reduction and T-dualities give bound states\nof NS-NS and R-R p-branes of type IIA and IIB string theories. In some cases\n(e.g. (q_1,q_2) string bound states of type IIB string theory), these\nnon-perturbative objects admit a simple eleven-dimensional description in terms\nof a fundamental 2-brane. The BPS excitations of such 2-brane are calculated\nand shown to exactly match the mass spectrum for the BPS (q_1,q_2) string bound\nstates. Different 11d representations of the same bound state can be used to\nprovide inequivalent (T-dual) descriptions of the oscillating BPS states. This\npermits to test T-duality beyond perturbation theory and, in certain cases, to\nevade membrane instabilities by going to a stable T-dual representation. We\nfinally summarize the results indicating in what regions of the modular\nparameter space a supermembrane description for M-theory on R^9 x T^2 seems to\nbe adequate.\n", "  BPS configurations of intersecting branes have many applications in string\ntheory. We attempt to provide an introductory and pedagogical review of\nsupergravity solutions corresponding to orthogonal BPS intersections of branes\nwith an emphasis on eleven and ten space-time dimensions. Recent work on BPS\nsolutions corresponding to non-orthogonally intersecting branes is also\ndiscussed. These notes are based on lectures given at the APCTP Winter School\n\"Dualities of Gauge and String Theories\", Korea, February 1997.\n", "  We construct nearly topological Yang-Mills theories on eight dimensional\nmanifolds with a special holonomy group. These manifolds are the Joyce manifold\nwith $Spin(7)$ holonomy and the Calabi-Yau manifold with SU(4) holonomy. An\ninvariant closed four form $T_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}$ on the manifold allows us to\ndefine an analogue of the instanton equation, which serves as a topological\ngauge fixing condition in BRST formalism. The model on the Joyce manifold is\nrelated to the eight dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. Topological\ndimensional reduction to four dimensions gives non-abelian Seiberg-Witten\nequation.\n", "  We review the structure $D=6, N=1$ string vacua with emphasis on the\ndifferent connections due to T-dualities and S-dualities. The topics discussed\ninclude: Anomaly cancellation; K3 and orbifold $D=6, N=1$ heterotic\ncompactifications; T-dualities between $E_8\\times E_8$ and $Spin(32)/Z_2$\nheterotic vacua; non-perturbative heterotic vacua and small instantons; N=2\nType-II/Heterotic duality in D=4 ; F-theory/heterotic duality in D=6; and\nheterotic/heterotic duality in six and four dimensions.\n", "  A new family of supergravity theories in odd dimensions is presented. The\nLagrangian densities are Chern-Simons forms for the connection of a\nsupersymmetric extension of the anti-de Sitter algebra. The superalgebras are\nthe supersymmetric extensions of the AdS algebra for each dimension, thus\ncompleting the analysis of van Holten and Van Proeyen, which was valid for N=1\nand for D=2,3,4,mod 8. The Chern-Simons form of the Lagrangian ensures\ninvariance under the gauge supergroup by construction and, in particular, under\nlocal supersymmetry. Thus, unlike standard supergravity, the local\nsupersymmetry algebra closes off-shell and without requiring auxiliary fields.\nThe Lagrangian is explicitly given for D=5, 7 and 11. In all cases the\ndynamical field content includes the vielbein, the spin connection, N\ngravitini, and some extra bosonic ``matter'' fields which vary from one\ndimension to another. The superalgebras fall into three families: osp(m|N) for\nD=2,3,4, mod 8, osp(N|m) for D=6,7,8, mod 8, and su(m-2,2|N) for D=5 mod 4,\nwith m=2^{[D/2]}. The possible connection between the D=11 case and M-Theory is\nalso discussed.\n", "  This talk gives an introduction into the subject of Seiberg-Witten curves and\ntheir relation to integrable systems. We discuss some motivations and origins\nof this relation and consider explicit construction of various families of\nSeiberg-Witten curves in terms of corresponding integrable models.\n", "  The role of mesons, particularly the pion, in the structure of nucleons is\nreviewed and investigated. Since quark-antiquark pairs are likely to\n``transform\" into mesons at large distances, mesons are expected to contribute\nto nucleon structure. Their effects on the Gottfried sum rule, on the\nstrangeness content of the nucleon, and on the spin of the nucleon are\ndiscussed.\n", "  Charge independence and charge symmetry are approximate symmetries of nature,\nviolated by the perturbing effects of the mass difference between up and down\nquarks and by electromagnetic interactions. The observations of the symmetry\nbreaking effects in nuclear and particle physics and the implications of those\neffects are reviewed.\n", "  We study elementary processes for production of dileptons from nucleons,\neither through NN bremsstrahlung or through photon-induced reactions. We\nemphasize the dependence of the expected cross-sections on the electromagnetic\nformfactor of the nucleon in the time-like regime and point out that the\nmentioned reactions can provide important information on the validity of vector\nmeson dominance for the nucleon. We also study the off-shell dependence of the\nformfactors.\n", "  Beta-decay and muon-capture experiments in nuclei are reviewed. The conserved\nvector current hypothesis is confirmed through the observed constancy of the\nvector coupling constant determined from the superallowed Fermi transitions and\nfrom the measurement of the weak-magnetism term in mirror Gamow-Teller\ntransitions. The axial-vector and pseudoscalar coupling constants in the\nnucleon are determined from neutron decay and muon capture on the proton\nrespectively. In finite nuclei, evidence for these coupling constants being\nreduced relative to their free-nucleon values is discussed. Meson-exchange\ncurrents are shown to be an important correction to the time-like part of the\naxial current as evident in first-forbidden beta decays. Tests of the Standard\nModel are discussed, as well as extensions beyond it involving right-hand\ncurrents and scalar interactions.\n", "  We review the progress in understanding the strange particle yields in\nnuclear collisions and their role in signalling quark-gluon plasma formation.\nWe report on new insights into the formation mechanisms of strange particles\nduring ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions and discuss interesting new\ndetails of the strangeness phase diagram. In the main part of the review we\nshow how the measured (multi-)strange particle abundances can be used as a\ntesting ground for chemical equilibration in nuclear collisions, and how the\nresults of such an analysis lead to important constraints on the collision\ndynamics and space-time evolution of high energy heavy-ion reactions.\n", "  The status of the field of nuclear parity violation---both experimental and\ntheoretical---is reviewed, with special emphasis on those results which have\nbeen obtained since the 1985 review article by Adelberger and Haxton.\n", "  It is shown that in the Standard Model, the property of charge quantization\nholds for a Higgs with arbitrary isospin and hypercharge. These defining\nquantum numbers of the Higgs remain unconstrained while the whole basic and\nfundamental structure of the Standard Model remains intact. Hence it is shown\nthat the Higgs cannot be a physical particle. Higgs is the underlying `vacuum'\nover which the whole edifice of the Standard Model stands. Also on most general\ngrounds it is established here that as per the Standard Model there is no\nelectric charge above the electro-weak phase transition temperature. Hence\nthere was no electric charge present in the Early Universe. The Superstring\nTheories are flawed in as much as they are incompatible with this requirement.\n", "  We will derive both quaternion and octonion algebras as the Clebsch-Gordan\nalgebras based upon the su(2) Lie algebra by considering angular momentum\nspaces of spin one and three. If we consider both spin 1 and 1/2 states, then\nthe same method will lead to the Lie-super algebra osp(1,2). Also, the quantum\ngeneralization of the method is discussed on the basis of the quantum group\n$su_q(2)$.\n", "  In the last few years, theoretical study of quantum systems serving as\ncomputational devices has achieved tremendous progress. We now have strong\ntheoretical evidence that quantum computers, if built, might be used as a\ndramatically powerful computational tool. This review is about to tell the\nstory of theoretical quantum computation. I left out the developing topic of\nexperimental realizations of the model, and neglected other closely related\ntopics which are quantum information and quantum communication. As a result of\nnarrowing the scope of this paper, I hope it has gained the benefit of being an\nalmost self contained introduction to the exciting field of quantum\ncomputation.\n  The review begins with background on theoretical computer science, Turing\nmachines and Boolean circuits. In light of these models, I define quantum\ncomputers, and discuss the issue of universal quantum gates. Quantum\nalgorithms, including Shor's factorization algorithm and Grover's algorithm for\nsearching databases, are explained. I will devote much attention to\nunderstanding what the origins of the quantum computational power are, and what\nthe limits of this power are. Finally, I describe the recent theoretical\nresults which show that quantum computers maintain their complexity power even\nin the presence of noise, inaccuracies and finite precision. I tried to put all\nresults in their context, asking what the implications to other issues in\ncomputer science and physics are. In the end of this review I make these\nconnections explicit, discussing the possible implications of quantum\ncomputation on fundamental physical questions, such as the transition from\nquantum to classical physics.\n"]}
