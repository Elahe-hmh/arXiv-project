A few years ago,\nmany astronomers might not have been able to answer that question properly.\nThis is today hopefully not the case anymore, because mainstream facilities,\nsuch as the VLTI, the Keck-I or the CHARA array, offer now this delicate\ntechnique to an astronomer who wants to observe his favourite object at the\nhighest angular resolution available. The large teaching effort on what is\ninterferometry and for what purpose it can be used, together with weak, but\nalready convincing imaging capabilities, make the technique reaching a ?mature?\nstate. I will not discuss here the details of the technique, as already many\nbooklets are now published on the subject, but rather describe what makes\nlong-baseline stellar interferometry attractive for the field of hot star\nastrophysics.\n", "  We revisit here the stability of a deformable interface that separates a\nfully-developed turbulent gas flow from a thin layer of laminar liquid. Unlike\nprevious work, the turbulent base state velocity profile proposed here requires\nonly a specification of a flowrate or pressure drop, and no a posteriori choice\nof parameters. Moreover, the base state contains sufficient detail such that it\nallows for instability due to a viscosity-contrast mechanism (which turns out\nto be dominant) as well as instability due to a critical-layer-type mechanism,\nand it is validated against the experimental and numerical data available in\nthe literature. Furthermore, the effect of perturbations in the turbulent\nstress distributions is investigated, and demonstrated, for the first time, to\nbe small for cases wherein the liquid layer is thin. The detailed modelling of\nthe liquid layer elicits two unstable modes, and mode competition can occur,\nalthough in most cases the instability is due to the viscosity-contrast\nmechanism. In particular, there is the possibility that surface roughness can\nreduce the growth rate of the interfacial mode, and promote a liquid-layer\ninstability to the status of most dangerous mode. Our base-state model\nfacilitates a new definition of `slow' and `fast' waves. We use our linear\nstability analysis to determine the factors that affect the wave speed and\ndemonstrate that the waves are `slow' according to the definition proposed\nhere. Finally, we compare our results with experimental data, and good\nagreement is obtained.\n", "  We consider a general class of infinite dimensional reversible differential\nsystems. Assuming a non resonance condition on the linear frequencies, we\nconstruct for such systems almost invariant pseudo norms that are closed to\nSobolev-like norms. This allows us to prove that if the Sobolev norm of index\n$s$ of the initial data $z_0$ is sufficiently small (of order $\\epsilon$) then\nthe Sobolev norm of the solution is bounded by $2\\epsilon$ during very long\ntime (of order $\\epsilon^{-r}$ with $r$ arbitrary). It turns out that this\ntheorem applies to a large class of reversible semi linear PDEs including the\nnon linear Schr\\\"odinger equation on the d-dimensional torus. We also apply our\nmethod to a system of coupled NLS equations which is reversible but not\nHamiltonian.\n  We also notice that for the same class of reversible systems we can prove a\nBirkhoff normal form theorem that in turn implies the same bounds on the\nSobolev norms. Nevertheless the technics that we use to prove the existence of\nquasi invariant pseudo norms is much more simple and direct.\n", "  Thin-film-like high temperature superconducting Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x single\ncrystals (TSB) with a typical thickness of 20-200 nm is produced by mechanical\nexfoliation. The TSB, which shows excellent superconductivity, can adhere\nfirmly to the substrate by van der Waals force. The TSB may find important\napplications in fabricating high temperature superconducting devices. Intrinsic\nJosephson junctions made of the TSB are demonstrated. A very interesting\nfinding is that the TSB can follow exactly the topology of the substrate,\nmaking it possible to fabricate superconducting devices with artificial\nstructures by using substrate template, for instance, step-edge Josephson\njunctions.\n", "  The European Space Agency's Planck satellite was launched on 14 May 2009, and\nhas been surveying the sky stably and continuously since 13 August 2009. Its\nperformance is well in line with expectations, and it will continue to gather\nscientific data until the end of its cryogenic lifetime. We give an overview of\nthe history of Planck in its first year of operations, and describe some of the\nkey performance aspects of the satellite. This paper is part of a package\nsubmitted in conjunction with Planck's Early Release Compact Source Catalogue,\nthe first data product based on Planck to be released publicly. The package\ndescribes the scientific performance of the Planck payload, and presents\nresults on a variety of astrophysical topics related to the sources included in\nthe Catalogue, as well as selected topics on diffuse emission.\n", "  This paper shows the correlation between chemical order, lattice strains and\nmagnetic properties of Heusler Co2FeAl films epitaxially grown on MgO(001). A\ndetailed magnetic characterization has been performed using vector field\nmagnetometery combined with numerical Stoner-Wohlfarth analysis. We demonstrate\nthe presence of three types of in-plane anisotropies: one biaxial, as expected\nfor the cubic symmetry, and other two uniaxial ones. The three anisotropies\nshow different behavior with the annealing temperature. The biaxial anisotropy\nshows a monotonous increase. The uniaxial anisotropy, parallel with the hard\nbiaxial axes, related to the chemical homogeneity, decreases, while the other,\nsupposed to have magnetostatic origin, remains constant.\n", "  We study the macroscopic entanglement properties of a low dimensional quantum\nspin system by investigating its magnetic properties at low temperatures and\nhigh magnetic fields. The tempera- ture and magnetic field dependence of\nentanglement from the susceptibility and magnetization data comparing the\nexperimental extraction with theoretical estimates are given. Extraction of\nentan- glement has been made possible through the macroscopic witness operators\nmagnetic susceptibility. The protocol followed in doing so has been outlined in\nsome recent work. Various plots of entan- glement comparing the experimental\nextraction with theoretical estimates are given. Quantitative comparison\nbetween concurrence and entanglement witness is given for both the theoretical\nand experimental results. Theory and experiments match over a wide range of\ntemperature and field. The spin system studied is a chain, which exhibits\ndimerisation and yields fascinating entanglement properties when the\ntemperature and magnetic field is varied. These spin systems exhibit quantum\nphase transition (QPT) at low temperatures, when the magnetic field is swept\nthrough a critical value. We show explicitly for the first time, using tools\nused in quantum information processing (QIP), that quantum phase transition\n(QPT) can be captured experimentally using canonically conjugate observables.\nMacroscopically, quantum complementarity relation clearly delineates entangled\nstates from separable states across the QPT. We have estimated the partial\ninformation sharing in this system from our magnetization and susceptibility\ndata. The complementarity relation has been experimentally verified to hold in\nthis system\n", "  We show that the Elko Lagrangian dark matter candidate is gauge-invariant\nunder local gauge transformations and that non-abelian gauge invariance can be\nset up quite naturally. This leads naturally to Elko symmetry currents. These\nElko symmetry currents can then be coupled with the symmetry currents of the\nElectroweak theory to form interaction Hamiltonian densities, thus providing a\nnatural mechanism for Elko particles to interact directly with Standard Model\nmatter in addition to the Higgs particle. This could have profound implications\nfor the detection of Elko at the LHC. We also show that in a certain sense Elko\nfields are non-local even along the axis of locality. This may make direct\ndetection of Elko difficult. We propose that Elko would therefore still seem\ndark to us, as far as direct detection efforts are concerned. We propose\nhowever, that the allowed gauge interactions between Elko and the electroweak\nsector of the Standard Model may result in the possibility of new experiments\nto be devised to look for Elko indirectly via studying the Standard Model\nparticles that are involved in an Elko interaction. Such new experiments could\ncomplement existing ideas of developing experiments to detect the Elko\nparticles based on their interaction with the Higgs particle.\n", "  Novel analysis of finite dimensional Hilbert space is outlined. The approach\nbypasses general, inherent, difficulties present in handling angular variables\nin finite dimensional problems: The finite dimensional, d, Hilbert space\noperators are underpinned with finite geometry which provide intuitive\nperspective to the physical operators. The analysis emphasizes a central role\nfor projectors of mutual unbiased bases (MUB) states, extending thereby their\nuse in finite dimensional quantum mechanics studies. Interrelation among the\nHilbert space operators revealed via their (finite) dual affine plane geometry\n(DAPG) underpinning are displayed and utilized in formulating the finite\ndimensional ubiquitous Radon transformation and its inverse illustrating phase\nspace-like physics encoded in lines and points of the geometry. The finite\ngeometry required for our study is outlined.\n", "  The strong-coupling regime between an electronic transition and the photonic\nmode of a optical resonator manifests itself in the lifting of the degeneracy\nbetween the two modes and the creation of two polariton states with mixed\noptical and electronic character. This phenomenon has been studied in atoms,\nexcitons in semiconductors and quantum electrodynamics circuits based on\nJosephson junctions. Recently, there is also strong interest to study similar\neffects using intersubband transitions in quantum wells in the terahertz, where\nthe ultra strong coupling regime can be reached and new physical effects have\nbeen predicted. An other interesting feature of this system is that, in\ncontrast to systems based on superconductors, the ultra strong coupling regime\ncan be maintained up to room temperature. In this work, we demonstrate that\nparabolic quantum wells coupled to LC circuit resonators in the ultra strong\ncoupling regime can achieve terahertz emission up to room temperature.\n", "  We use point contact spectroscopy to probe $\\rm{AEFe_2As_2}$ ($\\rm{AE=Ca, Sr,\nBa}$) and $\\rm{Fe_{1+y}Te}$. For $\\rm{AE=Sr, Ba}$ we detect orbital\nfluctuations above $T_S$ while for AE=Ca these fluctuations start below $T_S$.\nCo doping preserves the orbital fluctuations while K doping suppresses it. The\nfluctuations are only seen at those dopings and temperatures where an in-plane\nresistive anisotropy is known to exist. We predict an in-plane resistive\nanisotropy of $\\rm{Fe_{1+y}Te}$ above $T_S$. Our data are examined in light of\nthe recent work by W.-C. Lee and P. Phillips (arXiv:1110.5917v2). We also study\nhow joule heating in the PCS junctions impacts the spectra. Spectroscopic\ninformation is only obtained from those PCS junctions that are free of heating\neffects while those PCS junctions that are in the thermal regime display bulk\nresistivity phenomenon.\n", "  The first of the two related papers analising and explaining the origin,\nmanifestations and parodoxical features of the quantum potential (QP) from the\nnon-relativistic and relativistic point of view. QP arises in the quantum\nHamiltonian, under various procedures of quantization of the systems whose\nHamilton functions are the positive-definite quadratic forms in momenta with\ncoefficients depending on the coordinates in (n-dimensional) configurational\nspace (natural systems). Owing to the Riemannian structure thus introduced in\nthe space, the result of quantization is considered as quantum mecanics (QM) of\na particle. Contradiction of QP to the Principles of General Covariance and\nEquivalence is discussed. It is found that actually the historically first\nHilbert space based quantization by E. Schr\\\"odinger (1926), after revision in\nthe modern framework of QM, also leads to QP in the form that B. DeWitt had\nbeen found 26 years later. Efforts to avoid QP or reduce its drawbacks are\ndiscussed. The general conclusion is that some form of QP and a violation of\nthe principles of general relativity induced by it are apparently inevitable in\nthe non-relativistic QM. It is shown also that Feynman quantization singles out\ntwo versions of QP, which both determine two bi-scalar propagators which fix\ntwo different algorithms of path integral calculation. In the accompanying\npaper under the same general title and the subtitle \"The Relativistic Point of\nView\", relation of the non-relativistic QP to the quantum theory of the scalar\nfield non-minimally coupled to the curved space-time metric is considered.\n", "  Given a field vacuum state in a black hole spacetime, this state can be\nanalysed in terms of how it is perceived (in terms of particle content) by\ndifferent observers. This can be done by means of the effective-temperature\nfunction introduced by Barcel\\'o et al. in [1]. In Barbado et al. [2], this\nfunction was analysed in a case by case basis for a number of interesting\nsituations. In this work, we find a general analytic expression for the\neffective-temperature function which, apart from the vacuum state choice,\ndepends on the position, the local velocity and the acceleration of the\nspecific observer. We give a clear physical interpretation of the quantities\nappearing in the expression, and illustrate its potentiality with a few\nexamples.\n", "  Spin excitations are one of the top candidates for mediating electron pairing\nin unconventional superconductors. Their coupling to superconductivity is\nevident in a large number of systems, by the observation of an abrupt\nredistribution of magnetic spectral weight at the superconducting transition\ntemperature, Tc, for energies comparable to the superconducting gap. Here we\nreport inelastic neutron scattering measurements on Fe-based superconductors,\nFe1-x (Ni/Cu)x Te0.5 Se0.5, that emphasize an additional signature. The overall\nshape of the low energy magnetic dispersion changes from two incommensurate\nvertical columns at T >> Tc to a distinctly different U-shaped dispersion at\nlow temperature. Importantly, this spectral reconstruction is apparent for\ntemperature up to ~3Tc. If the magnetic excitations are involved in the pairing\nmechanism, their surprising modification on the approach to Tc demonstrates\nthat strong interactions are involved.\n", "  Neutral particles ejected from biological material under ultra short laser\nablation have been investigated by laser post-ionization time-of-flight mass\nspectrometry. It could be shown, that beside ionized species, a substantial\namount of neutral particles is ejected. A temporal study of the ablation plume\nis carried out by recording neutral particle time-of- flight mass spectra as a\nfunction of delay time between the ablation and post-ionization pulse. Close\nthe ablation threshold, the mechanism of ejection is found to be of\npredominantely mechanical nature, driven by the relaxation of the laser-induced\npressure. In this regime of stress confinement, the ejection results in very\nbroad velocity distributions and extremely low velocities.\n", "  In a magnetically driven electronic nematic state, an externally applied\nuniaxial strain rounds the nematic transition and increases the magnetic\ntransition temperature. We study both effects in a simple classical model of\nthe iron-pnictides expressed in terms of local SO(N) spins (with N = 3) which\nwe solve to leading order in 1=N. The magnetic transition temperature is shown\nto increase linearly in response to an external strain while a sharp crossover,\nwhich is a remnant of the nematic transition, can only be identified for\nextremely small strain. We show that these results can reasonably account for\nrecent neutron experimental data in BaFe2As2 by C. Dhital et al [1].\n", "  We analytically work out the long-term orbital perturbations induced by a\nhomogeneous circular ring of radius Rr and mass mr on the motion of a test\nparticle in the cases (I): r > R_r and (II): r < R_r. In order to extend the\nvalidity of our analysis to the orbital configurations of, e.g., some proposed\nspacecraftbased mission for fundamental physics like LISA and ASTROD, of\npossible annuli around the supermassive black hole in Sgr A* coming from tidal\ndisruptions of incoming gas clouds, and to the effect of artificial space\ndebris belts around the Earth, we do not restrict ourselves to the case in\nwhich the ring and the orbit of the perturbed particle lie just in the same\nplane. From the corrections to the standard secular perihelion precessions,\nrecently determined by a team of astronomers for some planets of the Solar\nSystem, we infer upper bounds on mr for various putative and known annular\nmatter distributions of natural origin (close circumsolar ring with R_r =\n0.02-0.13 au, dust ring with R_r = 1 au, minor asteroids, Trans-Neptunian\nObjects). We find m_r <= 1.4 10^-4 m_E (circumsolar ring with R_r = 0.02 au),\nm_r <= 2.6 10^-6 m_E (circumsolar ring with R_r = 0.13 au), m_r <= 8.8 10^-7\nm_E (ring with R_r = 1 au), m_r <= 7.3 10^-12 M_S (asteroidal ring with R_r =\n2.80 au), m_r <= 1.1 <= 10^-11 M_S (asteroidal ring with R_r = 3.14 au), m_r <=\n2.0 10^-8 M_S (TNOs ring with R_r = 43 au). In principle, our analysis is valid\nboth for baryonic and non-baryonic Dark Matter distributions.\n", "  We put forward a theory on the optical force exerted upon a dipolar particle\nby a stationary and ergodic partially coherent light field. We show through a\nrigorous analysis that the ensemble averaged electromagnetic force is given in\nterms of a partial gradient of the space variable diagonal elements of the\ncoherence tensor. Further, by following this result we characterize the\nconservative and non-conservative components of this force. In addition, we\nestablish the propagation law for the optical force in terms of the coherence\nfunction of light at a diffraction plane. This permits us to evaluate the\neffect of the degree of coherence on the force components by using the\narchetypical configuration of Young's two apertures diffraction pattern, so\noften employed to characterize coherence of waves.\n", "  We show that submicron Silicon spheres, whose polarizabilities are completely\ngiven by their two first Mie coefficients, are an excellent laboratory to test\neffects of both angle-suppressed and resonant differential scattering cross\nsections. Specifically, outstanding scattering angular distributions, with zero\nforward or backward scattered intensity, (i.e., the so-called Kerker's\nconditions), previously discussed for hypothetical magnetodielectric particles,\nare now observed for those Si objects in the near infrared. Interesting new\nconsequences for the corresponding optical forces are derived from the\ninterplay, both in and out resonance, between the electric and magnetic induced\ndipoles.\n", "  We report the first study on the optical force exerted by an evanescent wave\non a small sphere with both electric and magnetic response to the incident\nfield, immersed in an arbitrary nondissipative medium. New expressions and\neffects from their gradient, radiation pressure, and curl components are\nobtained due to the particle induced electric and magnetic dipoles, as well as\nto their mutual interaction. We predict possible dramatic changes in the force\ndepending on either the host medium, the polarization and the nature of the\nsurface wave.\n", "  We demonstrate that the interaction between two emitters can be controlled by\nmeans of the efficient excitation of surface plasmon modes in graphene. We\nconsider graphene surface plasmons supported by either two-dimensional graphene\nsheets or one-dimensional graphene ribbons, showing in both cases that the\ncoupling between the emitters can be strongly enhanced or suppressed. The\nsuper- and subradiant regimes are investigated in the reflection and\ntransmission configurations. Importantly, the length scale of the coupling\nbetween emitters, which in vacuum is fixed by the free space wavelength, is now\ndetermined by the wavelength of the graphene surface plasmons that can be\nextremely short and be tuned at will via a gate voltage.\n", "  Given an arbitrary statistical theory, different from quantum mechanics, how\nto decide which are the nonclassical correlations? We present a formal\nframework which allows for a definition of nonclassical correlations in such\ntheories, alternative to the current one. This enables one to formulate\nextrapolations of some important quantum mechanical features via adequate\nextensions of reciprocal maps relating states of a system with states of its\nsubsystems. These extended maps permit one to generalize i) separability\nmeasures to any arbitrary statistical model as well as ii) previous\nentanglement criteria. The standard definition of entanglement becomes just a\nparticular case of the ensuing, more general notion.\n", "  In this paper, we study a theoretical method to calculate the conductance\nacross a square barrier potential in monolayer graphene. We have obtained an\nanalytical expression for the transmission coefficient across a potential\nbarrier for monolayer graphene. Using the transmission coefficient obtained we\nhave an analytical expression for the conductance. This expression will be used\nto calculate the conductance in the case in which there is a potential barrier,\nwhich in our case will modelise the behaviour of a top gate voltage of a field\neffect transistor. Once this analysis has been performed we study the scenario\nin which carriers scatter with the potential barrier with different incidence\nangles and we have found that for any incident angle an effective gap is\ninduced.\n", "  Context: The presence of a turbulent magnetic field in the quiet Sun has been\nunveiled observationally using different techniques. The magnetic field is\nquasi-isotropic and has field strengths weaker than 100G. It is pervasive and\nmay host a local dynamo. Aims: We aim to determine the length scale of the\nturbulent magnetic field in the quiet Sun. Methods: The Stokes V area asymmetry\nis sensitive to minute variations in the magnetic topology along the line of\nsight. Using data provided by Hinode-SOT/SP instrument, we performed a\nstatistical study of this quantity.We classified the different magnetic regimes\nand infer properties of the turbulent magnetic regime. In particular we\nmeasured the correlation length associated to these fields for the first time.\nResults: The histograms of Stokes V area asymmetries reveal three different\nregimes: one organized, quasi-vertical and strong field (flux tubes or other\nstructures of the like); a strongly asymmetric group of profiles found around\nfield concentrations; and a turbulent isotropic field. For the last, we confirm\nits isotropy and measure correlation lengths from hundreds of kilometers down\nto 10km, at which point we lost sensitivity. A crude attempt to measure the\npower spectra of these turbulent fields is made. Conclusions: In addition to\nconfirming the existence of a turbulent field in the quiet Sun, we give further\nprove of its isotropy.We also measure correlation lengths down to 10km. The\ncombined results show magnetic fields with a large span of length scales, as\nexpected from a turbulent cascade.\n", "  Recently, we have experimentally demonstrated a continuous loading mechanism\nfor an optical dipole trap from a guided atomic beam [1]. The observed\nevolution of the number of atoms and temperature in the trap are consequences\nof the unusual trap geometry. In the present paper, we develop a model based on\na set of rate equations to describe the loading dynamics of such a mechanism.\nWe consider the collision statistics in the non-uniform trap potential that\nleads to twodimensional evaporation. The comparison between the resulting\ncomputations and experimental data allows to identify the dominant loss process\nand suggests ways to enhance the achievable steady-state atom number.\nConcerning subsequent evaporative cooling, we find that the possibility of\ncontrolling axial and radial confinement independently allows faster\nevaporation ramps compared to single beam optical dipole traps.\n", "  We consider the shape of the curves of \"Andreev\" conductance of non-ballistic\npoint contact NS heterosystems depending on the bias voltage at the contact.\nThe obtained shape of those curves is caused by the contribution from the\nmechanism of coherent scattering by impurities which doubles the scattering\ncross section. The behavior of generalized and differential conductance is\ncompared for ballistic and non-ballistic transport regimes. The criteria are\nconsidered allowing one to discriminate between those regimes with the\ncorresponding conduction curves similar in appearance. The analysis is extended\nto the case of non-ballistic transport in NS point contacts with exotic\nsuperconductors, molybdenum carbide Mo-C and oxypnictide\nLa[O$_{1-x}$F$_{x}$]FeAs from a group of iron-based superconductors.\n", "  The phase-space of a simple synchronization model is thoroughly investigated.\nThe model considers two-mode stochastic oscillators, coupled through a\npulse-like interaction controlled by simple optimization rules. A complex phase\nspace is uncovered as a function of two relevant model parameters that are\nrelated to the optimization threshold and the periods of the two oscillation\nmodes. Several phases with different periodic global output signals are\nidentified. It is shown that the system exhibits partial synchronization under\nunexpectedly general conditions.\n", "  The effects of aliovalent rare earth substitution on the physical properties\nof Sr0.3Ca0.7Fe2As2 solid solutions are explored. Electrical transport,\nmagnetic susceptibility and structural characterization data as a function of\nLa substitution into (Sr_1-y_Ca_y)_1-x_La_x_Fe2As2 single crystals confirm the\nability to suppress the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature from 200 K in\nthe undoped compound down to 100 K approaching the solubility limit of La.\nDespite up to ~30% La substitution, the persistence of magnetic order and lack\nof any signature of superconductivity above 10 K present a contrasting phase\ndiagram to that of Ca1-xLaxFe2As2, indicating that the suppression of magnetic\norder is necessary to induce the high-temperature superconducting phase\nobserved in Ca1-xLaxFe2As2.\n", "  Some of the assumptions of cosmology, as based on the simplest version of\nGeneral Relativity, are discussed. It is argued that by slight modifications of\nstandard gravitation theory, our notion of the sources of gravity {the right\nhand side of Einstein's equations{, could be something radically different from\nwhat is usually expected. One example is exhibited to prove the point, and some\nconsequences are discussed.\n", "  Within the four generation Standard Model, the Higgs couplings to gluons and\nto photons deviate in a significant way from the predictions of the three\ngeneration Standard Model. As a consequence, large departures in several Higgs\nproduction and decay channels are expected. Recent Higgs search results,\npresented by ATLAS, CMS and CDF, hint on the existence of a Higgs boson with a\nmass around 125 GeV. Using these results and assuming such a Higgs boson, we\nderive exclusion limits on the four generation Standard Model. For m_H = 125\nGeV, the model is excluded at 99.9% confidence level. For 124 GeV <= m_H <= 127\nGeV, an exclusion limit above 95% confidence level is found.\n", "  Nitrogen-doped epitaxial graphene grown on SiC(000?1) was prepared by\nexposing the surface to an atomic nitrogen flux. Using Scanning Tunneling\nMicroscopy (STM) and Spectroscopy (STS), supported by Density Functional Theory\n(DFT) calculations, the simple substitution of carbon by nitrogen atoms has\nbeen identified as the most common doping configuration. High-resolution images\nreveal a reduction of local charge density on top of the nitrogen atoms,\nindicating a charge transfer to the neighboring carbon atoms. For the first\ntime, local STS spectra clearly evidenced the energy levels associated with the\nchemical doping by nitrogen, localized in the conduction band. Various other\nnitrogen-related defects have been observed. The bias dependence of their\ntopographic signatures demonstrates the presence of structural configurations\nmore complex than substitution as well as hole-doping.\n", "  A current constrained approach is proposed to calculate negative differential\nconductance in molecular nano-junctions. A four-site junction is considered\nwhere a steady-state current is forced by inserting only the two central sites\nwithin the circuit. The two lateral sites (representing e.g. dangling molecular\ngroups) do not actively participate in transport, but exchange electrons with\nthe two main sites. These auxiliary sites allow for a variable number of\nelectrons within the junction, while, as required by the current constrained\napproach, the total number of electrons in the system is kept constant. We\ndiscuss the conditions for negative differential conductance in terms of\ncooperativity, variability of the number of electrons in the junction, and\nelectron correlations.\n", "  We have spectroscopically identified about 100 G-, K- and M-type members of\nthe Scorpius Centaurus complex. To deduce the age of these young stars we\ncompare their Li $\\lambda$6708 absorption line strengths against those of stars\nin the TW Hydrae association and $\\beta$ Pictoris moving group. These line\nstrengths indicate that Sco-Cen stars are younger than $\\beta$ Pic stars whose\nages of ~12 Myr have previously been derived from a kinematic traceback\nanalysis. Our derived age,~10Myr, for stars in the LCC and UCL subgroups of\nScoCen is younger than previously published ages based on the moving cluster\nmethod and upper main sequence fitting. The discrepant ages are likely due to\nan incorrect (or lack of) cross-calibration between model-dependent and\nmodel-independent age-dating methods.\n", "  In the course of the XMM-Newton survey of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC),\ntwo new bright X-ray sources were discovered exhibiting the spectral\ncharacteris- tics of High Mass X-ray Binaries - but revealing only weak\nevidence for pulsations in just one of the objects(at 153s in\nXMMUJ010743.1-715953). The accurate X- ray source locations permit the\nidentification of these X-ray source with Be stars, thereby strongly suggesting\nthese systems are new Be/X-ray binaries. From blue spectra the proposed\nclassification for XMMUJ010633.1-731543 is B0.5-1Ve and for\nXMMUJ010743.1-715953 it is B2IV-Ve.\n", "  We analyze the phenomenology of the top-pion and top-Higgs states in models\nwith strong top dynamics, and translate the present LHC searches for the\nStandard Model Higgs into bounds on these scalar states. We explore the\npossibility that the new state at a mass of approximately 125 GeV observed at\nthe LHC is consistent with a neutral pseudoscalar top-pion state. We\ndemonstrate that a neutral pseudoscalar top-pion can generate the diphoton\nsignal at the observed rate. However, the region of model parameter space where\nthis is the case does not correspond to classic topcolor-assisted technicolor\nscenarios with degenerate charged and neutral top-pions and a top-Higgs mass of\norder twice the top mass; rather, additional isospin violation would need to be\npresent and the top dynamics would be more akin to that in top seesaw models.\nMoreover, the interpretation of the new state as a top-pion can be sustained\nonly if the ZZ (four-lepton) and WW (two-lepton plus missing energy) signatures\ninitially observed at the 3? level decline in significance as additional data\nis accrued.\n", "  We study the fate of gravitational collapse of a tachyon field matter. In\npresence of an inverse square potential a black hole forms. Loop quantum\ncorrections lead to the avoidance of classical singularities, which is followed\nby an outward flux of energy.\n", "  Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain materials are known to substantially alter their\nstatic and dynamic properties when experiencing an effective transverse\nstaggered field originating from the varying local environment of the\nindividual spins. We present a temperature-, angular- and field-dependent 29Si\nNMR study of the model compound BaCu2Si2O7. The experimental data are\ninterpreted in terms of the divergent low-temperature transverse\nsusceptibility, predicted by theory for spin chains in coexisting longitudinal\nand transverse staggered fields. Our analysis first employs a\nfinite-temperature \"Density Matrix Renormalization Group\" (DMRG) study of the\nrelevant one-dimensional Hamiltonian. Next we compare our numerical with the\npresently known analytical results. With an analysis based on crystal\nsymmetries we show how the anisotropic contribution to the sample magnetization\nis experimentally accessible even below the ordering temperature, in spite of\nits competition with the collinear order parameter of the antiferromagnetic\nphase. The modification of static and dynamic properties of the system due to\nthe presence of a local transverse staggered field (LTSF) acting on the\none-dimensional spin array are argued to cause the unusual spin reorientation\ntransitions observed in BaCu2Si2O7. On the basis of a Ginzburg-Landau type\nanalysis, we discuss aspects of competing spin structures in the presence of\nmagnetic order and the enhanced transverse susceptibility.\n", "  Hybrid quantum systems with inherently distinct degrees of freedom play a key\nrole in many physical phenomena. Famous examples include cavity quantum\nelectrodynamics, trapped ions, or electrons and phonons in the solid state.\nHere, a strong coupling makes the constituents loose their individual character\nand form dressed states. Apart from fundamental significance, hybrid systems\ncan be exploited for practical purpose, noteworthily in the emerging field of\nquantum information control. A promising direction is provided by the\ncombination between long-lived atomic states and the accessible electrical\ndegrees of freedom in superconducting cavities and qubits. Here we integrate\ncircuit cavity quantum electrodynamics with phonons. Besides coupling to a\nmicrowave cavity, our superconducting transmon qubit interacts with a phonon\nmode in a micromechanical resonator, thus representing an atom coupled to two\ndifferent cavities. We measure the phonon Stark shift, as well as the splitting\nof the qubit spectral line into motional sidebands, which feature transitions\nbetween the dressed electromechanical states. In the time domain, we observe\ncoherent conversion of qubit excitation to phonons as sideband Rabi\noscillations. This is a model system having potential for a quantum interface,\nwhich may allow for storage of quantum information in long-lived phonon states,\ncoupling to optical photons, or for investigations of strongly coupled quantum\nsystems near the classical limit.\n", "  Neutron penumbral imaging technique has been successfully used as the\ndiagnosis method in Inertial Confined Fusion. To help the design of the imaging\nsystems in the future in CHINA. We construct the Monte carlo imaging system by\nGeant4. Use the point spread function from the simulation and decode algorithm\n(Lucy-Rechardson algorithm) we got the recovery image.\n", "  We present a promising approach to the extremely fast sensing and correction\nof small wavefront errors in adaptive optics systems. As our algorithm's\ncomputational complexity is roughly proportional to the number of actuators, it\nis particularly suitable to systems with 10,000 to 100,000 actuators. Our\napproach is based on sequential phase diversity and simple relations between\nthe point-spread function and the wavefront error in the case of small\naberrations. The particular choice of phase diversity, introduced by the\ndeformable mirror itself, minimizes the wavefront error as well as the\ncomputational complexity. The method is well suited for high-contrast\nastronomical imaging of point sources such as the direct detection and\ncharacterization of exoplanets around stars, and it works even in the presence\nof a coronagraph that suppresses the diffraction pattern. The accompanying\npaper in these proceedings by Korkiakoski et al. describes the performance of\nthe algorithm using numerical simulations and laboratory tests.\n", "  We study the absorption spectra of the yellow excitons in Cu$_2$O in high\nmagnetic fields using polarization-resolved optical absorption measurements\nwith a high frequency resolution. We show that the symmetry of the yellow\nexciton results in unusual selection rules for the optical absorption of\npolarized light and that the mixing of ortho- and para- excitons in magnetic\nfield is important. Our calculation of the energies of the yellow exciton\nseries in an arbitrary magnetic field gives an excellent fit to experimental\ndata and allows us to understand the complex structure of excitonic levels and\ntheir magnetic field dependence, which resolves the old-standing disagreement\nbetween the results of optical absorption and cyclotron resonance measurements.\n", "  We present a detailed study of the magnetic properties of unique cluster\nassembled solids namely Mn doped Ge46 and Ba8Ge46 clathrates using density\nfunctional theory. We find that ferromagnetic (FM) ground states may be\nrealized in both the compounds when doped with Mn. In Mn2Ge44, ferromagnetism\nis driven by hybridization induced negative exchange splitting, a generic\nmechanism operating in many diluted magnetic semiconductors. However, for\nMn-doped Ba8Ge46 clathrates incorporation of conduction electrons via Ba\nencapsulation results in RKKY-like magnetic interactions between the Mn ions.\nWe show that our results are consistent with the major experimental\nobservations for this system.\n", "  The composite systems can be non-uniquely decomposed into parts (subsystems).\nNot all decompositions (structures) of a composite system are equally\nphysically relevant. In this paper we answer on theoretical ground why it may\nbe so. We consider a pair of mutually un-coupled modes in the phase space\nrepresentation that are subjected to the independent quantum amplitude damping\nchannels. By investigating asymptotic dynamics of the degrees of freedom, we\nfind that the environment is responsible for the structures non-equivalence.\nOnly one structure is distinguished by both locality of the environmental in\nuence on its subsystems and a classical-like description.\n", "  Solid-state qubits hold the promise to achieve unmatched combination of\nsensitivity and spatial resolution. To achieve their potential, the qubits need\nhowever to be shielded from the deleterious effects of the environment. While\ndynamical decoupling techniques can improve the coherence time, they impose a\ncompromise between sensitivity and bandwidth, since to higher decoupling power\ncorrespond higher frequencies of the field to be measured. Moreover, the\nperformance of pulse sequences is ultimately limited by control bounds and\nerrors. Here we analyze a versatile alternative based on continuous driving. We\nfind that continuous dynamical decoupling schemes can be used for AC\nmagnetometry, providing similar frequency constraints on the AC field and\nimproved sensitivity for some noise regimes. In addition, the exibility of\nphase and amplitude modulation could yield superior robustness to driving\nerrors and a better adaptability to external experimental scenarios.\n", "  Based on specific heat (C_m) and entropy evaluation, different magnetic phase\ndiagrams of Ce compounds can be recognized: I) with the entropy of the ordered\nphase (S_MO) decreasing with their order temperature (T_ord): S_MO => 0 as\nT_ord => 0, being these systems the only candidates for Quantum Critical\nbehavior. II) with phase boundaries ending at a finite temperature Critical\nPoint because their Cm(T_ord) jumps (\\Delta C_m) do not decrease sufficiently\nwith T_ord producing a S_MO bottleneck, and III) those showing a transference\nof degrees of freedom to a non-magnetic heavy fermion (HF) component, with\ntheir \\Delta C_m vanishing at T >> 0. There is also a IV) group of Ce HF\nfermions which do not order magnetically because they are tuned at T_ord = 0.\nThese compounds are at the top of the lim(T=>0) of \\delta S_m/\\delta T = \\gamma\n. values because they collect the highest density of low energy excitations.\nFrom the analysis of Cm(T)=T and S_m(T) results performed on these selected Ce\nternaries, a quantitative determination of an upper limit for the density of\nexcitations is obtained, excluding any evidence of C_m(T)/T divergency at T =>\n0 in agreement with thermodynamic laws.\n", "  In this paper we analyze the theoretical limits of a metamaterial converter\nthat allows for linear-to- elliptical polarization transformation with any\ndesired ellipticity and ellipse orientation. We employ the transmission line\napproach providing a needed level of the design generalization. Our analysis\nreveals that the maximal conversion efficiency for transmission through a\nsingle metamaterial layer is 50%, while the realistic re ection configuration\ncan give the conversion efficiency up to 90%. We show that a double layer\ntransmission converter and a single layer with a ground plane can have 100%\npolarization conversion efficiency. We tested our conclusions numerically\nreaching the designated limits of efficiency using a simple metamaterial\ndesign. Our general analysis provides useful guidelines for the metamaterial\npolarization converter design for virtually any frequency range of the\nelectromagnetic waves.\n", "  This letter presents a new, solely thermodynamical argument for considering\nthe states of the quantum isolated horizon of a black hole as distinguishable.\nWe claim that only if the states are distinguishable, the thermodynamic entropy\nis an extensive quantity and can be well-defined. To show this, we make a\ncomparison with a classical ideal gas system whose statistical description\nmakes only sense if an additional 1/N!-factor is included in the state counting\nin order to cure the Gibbs paradox. The case of the statistical description of\na quantum isolated horizon is elaborated, to make the claim evident.\n", "  Graphene placed in a magnetic field possesses an extremely high\nmid/far-infrared optical nonlinearity originating from its unusual band\nstructure and selection rules for the optical transitions near the Dirac point.\nHere we study the linear and nonlinear optical response of graphene in strong\nmagnetic and optical fields using quantum- mechanical density-matrix formalism.\nWe calculate the power of coherent terahertz radiation generated as a result of\nfour-wave mixing in graphene. We show that even one monolayer of graphene gives\nrise to appreciable nonlinear frequency conversion efficiency and Raman gain\nfor modest intensities of incident infrared radiation.\n", "  We report the results of a search for axions from the 14.4 keV M1 transition\nfrom Fe-57 in the core of the sun using the axio-electric effect in TeO2\nbolometers. The detectors are 5x5x5 cm3 crystals operated at about 10 mK in a\nfacility used to test bolometers for the CUORE experiment at the Laboratori\nNazionali del Gran Sasso in Italy. An analysis of 43.65 kg d of data was made\nusing a newly developed low energy trigger which was optimized to reduce the\ndetectors energy threshold. An upper limit of 0.63 c kg-1 d-1 was established\nat 95% C.L.. From this value, a lower bound at 95% C.L. was placed on the\nPeccei-Quinn energy scale of fa >= 0.76 10**6 GeV for a value of S=0.55 for the\nflavor-singlet axial vector matrix element. Bounds are given for the interval\n0.15 < S < 0.55.\n", "  The unfolding program TRUEE is a software package for the numerical solution\nof inverse problems. The algorithm was first applied in the FORTRAN77 program\nRUN. RUN is an event-based unfolding algorithm which makes use of the Tikhonov\nregularization. It has been tested and compared to different unfolding\napplications and stood out with notably stable results and reliable error\nestimation. TRUEE is a conversion of RUN to C++, which works within the\npowerful ROOT framework. The program has been extended for more\nuser-friendliness and delivers unfolding results which are identical to RUN.\nBeside the simplicity of the installation of the software and the generation of\ngraphics, there are new functions, which facilitate the choice of unfolding\nparameters and observables for the user. In this paper, we introduce the new\nunfolding program and present its performance by applying it to two exemplary\ndata sets from astroparticle physics, taken with the MAGIC telescopes and the\nIceCube neutrino detector, respectively.\n", "  We introduce a discrete linear lossy system with an embedded \"hot spot\" (HS),\ni.e., a site carrying linear gain and complex cubic nonlinearity. The system\ncan be used to model an array of optical or plasmonic waveguides, where\nselective excitation of particular cores is possible. Localized modes pinned to\nthe HS are constructed in an implicit analytical form, and their stability is\ninvestigated numerically. Stability regions for the modes are obtained in the\nparameter space of the linear gain and cubic gain/loss. An essential result is\nthat the interaction of the unsaturated cubic gain and self-defocusing\nnonlinearity can produce stable modes, although they may be destabilized by\nfinite amplitude perturbations. On the other hand, the interplay of the cubic\nloss and self-defocusing gives rise to a bistability.\n", "  The problem of moving of a charged particle in electromagnetic field is\nconsidered in terms of tomographic probability representation. The coherent and\nFock states of a charge moving in varying homogeneous magnetic field are\nstudied in the tomographic probability representation of quantum mechanics. The\nstates are expressed in terms of quantum tomograms. The Fock state tomograms\nare given in the form of probability distributions described by multivariable\nHermite polynomials with time-dependent arguments. The obtained results are\ngeneralized in the present work and are applied to determining the transition\nprobabilities between Landau levels. Transition probabilities are calculated\nusing the symplectic tomograms instead of the wave functions. The same method\nis used in obtaining the transition probabilities between the Landau levels\npossessed by a charge moving in varying electromagnetic field.\n", "  We show that the magnetic state of individual manganese phthalocyanine (MnPc)\nmolecules on a Bi(110) surface is modified when the Mn2+ center coordinates to\nCO molecules adsorbed on top. Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy we\nidentified this change in magnetic properties from the broadening of a\nKondo-related zero-bias anomaly when the CO-MnPc complex is formed. The\noriginal magnetic state can be recovered by selective desorption of individual\nCO molecules. First principle calculations show that the CO molecule reduces\nthe spin of the adsorbed MnPc from S = 1 to S = 1=2 and strongly modifies the\nrespective screening channels, driving a transition from an underscreened Kondo\nstate to a state of mix-valence.\n", "  The electron acceptor molecule TCNQ is found in either of two distinct\ninteger charge states when embedded into a monolayer of a charge\ntransfer-complex on a gold surface. Scanning tun- neling spectroscopy\nmeasurements identify these states through the presence/absence of a zero-bias\nKondo resonance. Increasing the (tip-induced) electric field allows us to\nreversibly induce the ox- idation/reduction of TCNQ species from their anionic\nor neutral ground state, respectively. We show that the different ground states\narise from slight variations in the underlying surface potential, pictured here\nas the gate of a three-terminal device.\n", "  Some inequalities for probability vector are discussed. The probability\nrepresentation of quantum mechanics where the states are mapped onto\nprobability vectors (either finite or infinite dimensional) called the state\ntomograms is used. Examples of inequalities for qudit tomograms and a state\nextended uncertainly relation are considered. Tomographic cumulant related to\nphoton state tomographic probability distributions is introduced and it is used\nas parameter of the state nongaussianity.\n", "  While a natural ultraviolet cutoff, presumably at the Planck length, is\nwidely assumed to exist in nature, it has proven difficult to implement a\nminimum length scale covariantly. A key reason is that the presence of a fixed\nminimum length would seem to contradict the ability of Lorentz transformations\nto contract lengths. In this paper, we implement a fully covariant Planck scale\ncutoff by cutting off the spectrum of the d'Alembertian. In this scenario,\nconsistent with Lorentz contractions, wavelengths that are arbitrarily smaller\nthan the Planck length continue to exist. However, the dynamics of modes of\nwavelengths that are significantly smaller than the Planck length possess a\nvery small bandwidth. This has the effect of freezing the dynamics of such\nmodes. While both, wavelengths and bandwidths, are frame dependent, Lorentz\ncontraction and time dilation conspire to make the freezing of modes of\ntransplanckian wavelengths covariant. In particular, we show that this\nultraviolet cutoff can be implemented covariantly also in curved spacetimes. We\nfocus on Friedmann Robertson Walker (FRW) spacetimes and their much-discussed\ntransplanckian question: The physical wavelength of each comoving mode was\nsmaller than the Planck scale at sufficiently early times. What was the mode's\ndynamics then? Here, we show that in the presence of the covariant UV cutoff,\nthe dynamical bandwidth of a comoving mode is essentially zero up until its\nphysical wavelength starts exceeding the Planck length. In particular, we show\nthat under general assumptions, the number of dynamical degrees of freedom of\neach comoving mode all the way up to some arbitrary finite time is actually\nfinite. Our results also open the way to calculating the impact of this natural\nUV cutoff on inflationary predictions for the CMB.\n", "  We investigate the photoionization spectrum of helium by attosecond XUV\npulses both in the spectral region of doubly excited resonances as well as\nabove the double ionization threshold. In order to probe for convergence, we\ncompare three techniques to extract photoelectron spectra from the wavepacket\nresulting from the integration of the time-dependent Schr\u007foedinger equation in\na finite-element discrete variable representation basis. These techniques are:\nprojection on products of hydrogenic bound and continuum states, projection\nonto multi-channel scattering states computed in a B-spline close-coupling\nbasis, and a technique based on exterior complex scaling (ECS) implemented in\nthe same basis used for the time propagation. These methods allow to monitor\nthe population of continuum states in wavepackets created with ultrashort\npulses in different regimes. Applications include photo cross sections and\nanisotropy parameters in the spectral region of doubly excited resonances,\ntime-resolved photoexcitation of autoionizing resonances in an attosecond\npump-probe setting, and the energy and angular distribution of correlated\nwavepackets for two-photon double ionization.\n", "  By coating a three-dimensional topological insulator (TI) with a\nferromagnetic film supporting an in-plane magnetic vortex, one breaks the\ntime-reversal symmetry (TRS) without generating a mass gap. It rather yields\nelectronic states bound to the vortex center which have different probabilities\nassociated with each spin mode. In addition, its associate current (around the\nvortex center) is partially polarized with an energy gap separating the most\nexcited bound state from the scattered ones. Charged zero-modes also appear as\nfully polarized modes localized near the vortex center. From the magnetic point\nof view, the observation of such a special current in a TI-magnet sandwich\ncomes about as an alternative technique for detecting magnetic vortices in\nmagnetic thin films.\n", "  The Abelian Sandpile Model is a discrete diffusion process defined on graphs\n(Dhar [10], Dhar et al. [11]) which serves as the standard model of\nself-organized criticality. The transience class of a sandpile is defined as\nthe maximum number of particles that can be added without making the system\nrecurrent ([3]). Using elementary combinatorial arguments and symmetry\nproperties, Babai and Gorodezky (SODA 2007,[2]) demonstrated a bound of O(n^30)\non the transience class of an nxn grid. This was later improved by Choure and\nVishwanathan (SODA 2012,[7]) to O(n^7) using techniques based on harmonic\nfunctions on graphs. We improve this bound to O(n^7 log n). We also demonstrate\ntight bounds on certain resistance ratios over grid networks. The tools used\nfor deriving these bounds may be of independent interest.\n", "  Precision is a virtue throughout science in general and in optics in\nparticular where carefully fabricated nanometer-scale devices hold great\npromise for both classical and quantum photonics [1-6]. In such nanostructures,\nunavoidable imperfections often impose severe performance limits but, in\ncertain cases, disorder may enable new functionalities [7]. Here we demonstrate\non-chip random nanolasers where the cavity feedback is provided by the\nintrinsic disorder in a semiconductor photonic-crystal waveguide, leading to\nAnderson localization of light [8]. This enables highly efficient and broadband\ntunable lasers with very small mode volumes. We observe an intriguing interplay\nbetween gain, dispersion-controlled slow light, and disorder, which determines\nthe cross-over from ballistic transport to Anderson localization. Such a\nbehavior is a unique feature of non-conservative random media that enables the\ndemonstration of all-optical control of random lasing. Our statistical analysis\nshows a way towards ultimate thresholdless random nanolasers.\n", "  We investigate how short and long electron trajectory contributions to high\nharmonic emission and their interferences give access to intra-molecular\ndynamics. In the case of unaligned molecules, we show experimental evidences\nthat the long trajectory signature is more dependent upon the molecule than the\nshort one, providing a high sensitivity to cation nuclear dynamics within 100's\nof as to few fs. Using theoretical approaches based on Strong Field\nApproximation and Time Dependent Schrodinger Equation, we examine how quantum\npath interferences encode electronic motion whilst molecules are aligned. We\nshow that the interferences are dependent on channels superposition and upon\nwhich ionisation channel is involved. In particular, quantum path interferences\nencodes electronic migration signature while coupling between channels is\nallowed by the laser field. Hence, molecular quantum path interferences is a\npromising method for Attosecond Spectroscopy, allowing the resolution of\nultra-fast charge migration in molecules after ionisation in a self-referenced\nmanner.\n", "  Quantum key distribution over probabilistic quantum repeaters is addressed.\nWe compare, under practical assumptions, two such schemes in terms of their\nsecure key generation rates per quantum memory. The two schemes under\ninvestigation are the one proposed by Duan et al. in [Nat. 414, 413 (2001)] and\nthat of Sangouard et al. in [Phys. Rev. A 76, 050301 (2007)]. We consider\nvarious sources of imperfection in both protocols, such as nonzero\ndouble-photon probabilities at the sources, dark counts in detectors, and\ninefficiencies in the channel, photodetectors and memories. We also consider\nmemory decay and dephasing processes in our analysis. For the latter system, we\ndetermine the maximum value of the double-photon probability beyond which\nsecretkey distillation is not possible. We also find the crossover distance\nbeyond which the repeater schemes outperform the non-repeater ones. We finally\ncompare the two protocols in terms of their achievable secret key generation\nrates at their optimal settings\n", "  The inverse of the Vandermonde and confluent Vandermonde matrices are\npresented. In the case of the Vandermonde matrix, we present a decomposition in\nthree factors, one of them a diagonal matrix. The evaluation of such inverse\nmatrices is a key point to find functions of a matrix, namely exponential\nfunctions (evolution operators)and logarithmic functions (entropies) in quantum\nmechanical topics.\n", "  LHC provides a excellent laboratory to probe massive gravitons effects in\nscenarios with low scale gravity up to several Tev. Based on this fact, in the\npresent work we are interested in analyzing the possible constraints on the\nfree parameters of the gravity Lagrangian in 4 dimensions recently studied in\nthe reference [1] taking only the torsion effects into account, in order to\ngenerate mass for the graviton. We shall consider a effective fields theory\napproach, in which the gravity is excited by the torsion but not the metric.\n", "  Mid-IR observations of planetary nebulae (PNe) have revealed diffuse emission\nassociated to their main nebular shells and outer envelopes or haloes. The\ninterpretation of this emission is uncertain because the broad-band mid-IR\nimages may include contributions of different components. In particular, the\nSpitzer IRAC 8 {\\mu}m images, that best reveal these nebular features, can\ninclude contributions not only of H2 lines, but also those of ionic species,\nPAH features, and thermal dust continuum emission. To investigate the nature of\nthe emission detected in mid-IR observations of a sample of 10 PNe, we have\nobtained narrow-band near-IR H2 {\\lambda}2.122 {\\mu}m and optical [N II]\n{\\lambda}6584 ?A images. The comparison between these images confrm that a\nsignificant fraction of the emission detected in the IRAC 8 {\\mu}m images can\nbe attributed to molecular hydrogen, thus confirming the utility of these\nmid-IR images to investigate the molecular component of PNe. We have also\ndetected H2 emission from PNe whose physical structure cannot be described as\nbipolar, but rather as ellipsoidal or barrel-like. These detections suggest\nthat, as more sensitive observations of PNe in the H2 {\\lambda}2.122 line are\nacquired, the detection of H2 emission is not exclusive of bipolar PNe,\nalthough objects with this morphology are still the brightest H2 emitters.\nFinally, we remark that the bright H2 emission from the equatorial ring of a\nbipolar PN does not arise from a photodissociation region shielded from the UV\nstellar radiation by the ring itself, but from dense knots and clumps embedded\nwithin the ionized material of the ring.\n", "  We investigate the magnetic properties of a range of low-dimensional\nferromagnets using a combination of first-principles calculations and atomistic\nspin dynamics simulations. This approach allows us to evaluate the ground state\nand finite temperature properties of experimentally well characterized systems\nsuch as Co/Cu(111), Co/Cu(001), Fe/Cu(001) and Fe/W(110), for different\nthicknesses of the magnetic layer. We compare our calculated spin wave spectra\nwith experimental data available in the literature, and find a good\nquantitative agreement. We also predict magnon spectra for systems for which no\nexperimental data exist at the moment, and estimate the role of temperature\neffects.\n", "  We study the dynamics of the noncommutative fuid in the Snyder space\nperturbatively at the first order in powers of the noncommutative parameter.\nThe linearized noncommutative fluid dynamics is described by a system of\ncoupled linear partial differential equations in which the variables are the\nfluid density and the fluid potentials. We show that these equations admit a\nset of solutions that are monocromatic plane waves for the fluid density and\ntwo of the potentials and a linear function for the third potential. The\nenergy-momentum tensor of the plane waves is calculated.\n", "  Origami is the archetype of a structural material with unusual mechanical\nproperties that arise almost exclusively from the geometry of its constituent\nfolds and forms the basis for mechanical metamaterials with an extreme\ndeformation response. Here we consider a simple periodically folded structure\nMiura-ori, which is composed of identical unit cells of mountain and valley\nfolds with four-coordinated ridges, defined completely by 2 angles and 2\nlengths. We use the geometrical properties of a Miura-ori plate to characterize\nits elastic response to planar and non-planar piece- wise isometric\ndeformations and calculate the two-dimensional stretching and bending response\nof a Miura-ori sheet, and show that the in-plane and out-of-plane Poisson's\nratios are equal in magnitude, but opposite in sign. Our geometric approach\nalso allows us to solve the inverse design problem of determining the geometric\nparameters that achieve the optimal geometric and mechanical response of such\nstructures.\n", "  In this paper we analyze the use of time splitting techniques for solving\nshallow water equation. We discuss some properties that these schemes should\nsatisfy so that interactions between the source term and the shock waves are\ncontrolled. This paper shows that these schemes must be well balanced in the\nmeaning expressed by Greenberg and Leroux [5]. More specifically, we analyze in\nwhat cases it is enough to verify an Approximate C-property and in which cases\nit is required to verify an Exact C-property (see [1], [2]). We also include\nsome numerical tests in order to justify our reasoning.\n", "  The doping of graphene to tune its electronic structure is essential for its\nfurther use in carbon based electronics. Adapting strategies from classical\nsilicon based semiconductor technology, we use the incorporation of heteroatoms\nin the 2D graphene network as a straightforward way to achieve this goal. Here,\nwe report on the synthesis of boron-doped graphene on Ni(111) in a chemical\nvapor deposition process of triethylborane on the one hand and by segregation\nof boron from the bulk on the other hand. The chemical environment of boron was\ndetermined by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and angle resolved photoelectron\nspectroscopy was used to analyze the impact on the band structure. Doping with\nboron leads to a shift of the graphene bands to lower binding energies. The\nshift depends on the doping concentration and for a doping level of 0.3 ML a\nshift of up to 1.2 eV is observed. The experimental results are in agreement\nwith density-functional calculations. Furthermore, our calculations suggest\nthat doping with boron leads to graphene preferentially adsorbed in the top-fcc\ngeometry, since the boron atoms in the graphene lattice are then adsorbed at\nsubstrate fcc-hollow sites. The smaller adsorption distance of boron compared\nto carbon leads to a bending of the graphene sheet in the vicinity of the boron\natoms. By comparing calculations of doped and undoped graphene on Ni(111), as\nwell as the respective free-standing cases, we are able to distinguish between\nthe effects that doping and adsorption have on the band structure of graphene.\nBoth, doping and bonding to the surface, result in opposing shifts on the\ngraphene bands.\n", "  We show that gels formed by arrested spinodal decomposition of protein\nsolutions exhibit elastic properties in two distinct frequency domains, both\nelastic moduli exhibiting a remarkably strong dependence on volume fraction.\nConsidering the large difference between the protein size and the\ncharacteristic length of the network we model the gels as porous media and show\nthat the high and low frequency elastic moduli can be respectively attributed\nto stretching and bending modes. The unexpected decoupling of the two modes in\nthe frequency domain is attributed to the length scale involved: while\nstretching mainly relates to the relative displacement of two particles,\nbending involves the deformation of a strand with a thickness of the order of a\nthousand particle diameters.\n", "  We present the experimental evidence for the presence of spinodal\ndecomposition of the magnetic ions in the Ge/1-x-y/Cr/x/Eu/y/Te samples with\nchemical composition varying in the range of 0.015 < x < 0.057 and 0.003 < y <\n0.042. The ferromagnetic transition at temperatures 50 < T < 57 K was observed,\nindependent of the chemical composition. The long-range carrier mediated\nitinerant magnetic interactions seem to be responsible for the observed\nferromagnetic order. The magnetic irreversibility with coercive field H/C/ =\n5?63 mT and the saturation magnetization M/S/ <? 2?6 emu/g are found to\nstrongly depend on the chemical composition of the alloy.\n", "  Using field-angle, temperature, and back-gate-voltage dependence of the weak\nanti-localization (WAL) and universal conductance fluctuations of thin\nBi1.5Sb0.5Te1.7Se1.3 topological-insulator single crystals, in combination with\ngate-tuned Hall resistivity measurements, we reliably separated the surface\nconduction of the topological nature from both the bulk conduction and\ntopologically trivial surface conduction. We minimized the bulk conduction in\nthe crystals and back-gate tuned the Fermi level to the topological\nbottom-surface band while keeping the top surface insensitive to back-gating\nwith the optimal crystal thickness of ~?100 nm. We argue that the WAL effect\noccurring by the coherent diffusive motion of carriers in relatively low\nmagnetic fields is more essential than other transport tools such as the\nShubnikov-de Hass oscillations for confirming the conduction by the\ntopologically protected surface state. Our approach provides a highly coherent\npicture of the surface transport properties of TIs and a reliable means of\ninvestigating the fundamental topological nature of surface conduction and\npossible quantum-device applications related to momentum-locked spin\npolarization in surface states.\n", "  Using a general relativistic exact model for spherical structures in a\ncosmological background, we have put forward an algorithm to calculate the test\nparticle geodesics within such cosmological structures in order to obtain the\nvelocity profile of stars or galaxies. The rotation curve thus obtained is\nbased on a density profile and is independent of any mass definition which is\nnot unique in general relativity. It is then shown that this general\nrelativistic rotation curves for a toy model and a NFW density profile are\nalmost identical to the corresponding Newtonian one, although the general\nrelativistic masses may be quite different.\n", "  It is shown that dyad vectors on a local domain of complex-number valued\nsurface, when squared, form a set of four quaternion algebra units. A model of\nproto-particle is built by the dyad's rotation and stretching; this\ntransformation violates metric properties of the surface, but the defect is\ncured by a stability condition for normalization functional over an abstract\nspace. If the space is the physical one then the stability condition is\nprecisely Schr\u007fodinger equation; separated real and imaginary parts of the\ncondition are respectively equation of mass conservation and Hamilton-Jacoby\nequation. A 3D particle (composed of the proto-particle's parts) has to be\nconceived as a rotating massive point, its Lagrangian automatically becoming\nthat of relativistic classical particle, energy and momentum proportional to\nPlanck constant. In uence of a vector field onto the particle's propagation\ncauses automatic appearance of Pauli spin term in Schr\u007fodinger equation.\n", "  We discuss the implementation of a beam splitter for electron waves in a\nquantum Hall bilayer. Our architecture exploits inter-layer tunneling to mix\nedge states belonging to different layers. We discuss the basic working\nprinciple of the proposed coherent edge mixer, possible interferometric\nimplementations based on existing semiconductor-heterojunction technologies,\nand advantages with respect to canonical quantum Hall interferometers based on\nquantum point contacts.\n", "  Ground-plane cloaks, which transform a curved mirror into a flat one, and\nrecently reported at wavelengths ranging from the optical to the visible\nspectrum, bring the realm of optical illusion a step closer to reality.\nHowever, all carpet-cloaking experiments have thus far been carried out in the\nfar-field. Here, we demonstrate numerically and experimentally that a\ndielectric photonic crystal (PC) of a complex shape made of a honeycomb array\nof air holes can scatter waves in the near field like a PC with a at boundary\nat stop band frequencies. This mirage effect relies upon a specific arrangement\nof dielectric pillars placed at the nodes of a quasi-conformal grid dressing\nthe PC. Our carpet is shown to work throughout the range of wavelengths 1500nm\nto 1650nm within the stop band extending from 1280 to 1940 nm. The device has\nbeen fabricated using a single- mask advanced nanoelectronics technique on\nIII-V semiconductors and the near field measurements have been carried out in\norder to image the wave fronts's curvatures around the telecommunication\nwavelength 1550 nm.\n", "  We present neutron scattering measurements on single crystals of lightly\ndoped $La_{2-x}Ba_{x}CuO_{4}$, with $0 \\leq x \\leq? 0.035$. These reveal the\nevolution of the magnetism in this prototypical doped Mott insulator from a\nthree dimensional (3D) commensurate (C) antiferromagnetic ground state, which\norders at a relatively high TN, to a two dimensional (2D) incommensurate (IC)\nground state with finite ranged static correlations, which appear below a\nrelatively low effective TN. At low temperatures, the 2D IC magnetism co-exists\nwith the 3D C magnetism for doping concentrations as low as ? 0.0125. We find\nno signal of a 3D C magnetic ground state by x $\\sim$? 0.025, consistent with\nthe upper limit of x $\\sim$? 0.02 observed in the sister family of doped Mott\ninsulators, $La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}$. The 2D IC ground states observed for\n$0.0125 \\leq x \\leq 0.035$ are diagonal, and are rotated by 45 degrees within\nthe orthorhombic basal plane compared with those previously reported for\nsamples with superconducting ground states: $La_{2-x}Ba_{x}CuO_{4}$, with $0.05\n\\leq? x \\leq? 0.095. We construct a phase diagram based solely on magnetic\norder parameter measurements, which displays much of the complexity of standard\nhigh temperature superconductivity phase diagrams discussed in the literature.\nAnalysis of high energy-resolution inelastic neutron scattering at moderately\nlow temperatures shows a progressive depletion of the very low energy dynamic\nmagnetic susceptibility as x increases from 0.0125 to 0.035. This low energy,\ndynamic susceptibility falls off? with increasing temperature on a scale much\nhigher than the effective 2D IC TN appropriate to these materials. Appreciable\ndynamic 2D IC magnetic fluctuations inhabit much of the \"pseudogap\" regime of\nthe phase diagram.\n", "  Waves fail to propagate in random media. First predicted for quantum\nparticles in the presence of a disordered potential, Anderson localization has\nbeen observed also in classical acoustics, electromagnetism and optics. Here,\nfor the first time, we report the observation of Anderson localization of pairs\nof entangled photons in a two-particle discrete quantum walk affected by\nposition dependent disorder. A quantum walk on a disordered lattice is realized\nby an integrated array of interferometers fabricated in glass by femtosecond\nlaser writing. A novel technique is used to introduce a controlled phase shift\ninto each unit mesh of the network. Polarization entanglement is exploited to\nsimulate the different symmetries of the two-walker system. We are thus able to\nexperimentally investigate the genuine effect of (bosonic and fermionic)\nstatistics in the absence of interaction between the particles. We will show\nhow different types of randomness and the symmetry of the wave-function affect\nthe localization of the entangled walkers.\n", "  We investigate the calculation of the magnetic form factors of nano-objects\nwith complex geometrical shapes and non homogeneous magnetization\ndistributions. We describe a numerical procedure which allows to calculate the\n3D magnetic form factor of nano-objects from realistic magnetization\ndistributions obtained by micromagnetic calculations. This is illustrated in\nthe canonical cases of spheres, rods and platelets. This work is a first step\ntowards a 3D vectorial reconstruction of the magnetization at the nanometric\nscale using neutron scattering techniques.\n", "  In simulations of a 12.5PW laser (focused intensity I = 4x10^23W/cm^2)\nstriking a solid aluminium target 10% of the laser energy is converted to\ngamma-rays. A dense electron-positron plasma is generated with a maximum\ndensity of 10^26/m^3; seven orders of magnitude denser than pure e-e+ plasmas\ngenerated with 1PW lasers. When the laser power is increased to 320PW (I =\n10^25W/cm^2) 40% of the laser energy is converted to gamma-ray photons and 10%\nto electron-positron pairs. In both cases there is strong feedback between the\nQED emission processes and the plasma physics; the defining feature of the new\n`QED-plasma' regime reached in these interactions.\n", "  Trapped degenerate dipolar Bose and Fermi gases of cylindrical symmetry with\nthe polarization vector along the symmetry axis are only stable for the\nstrength of dipolar interaction below a critical value. In the case of bosons,\nthe stability of such a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) is investigated\nfor different strengths of contact and dipolar interactions using variational\napproximation and numerical solution of a mean-field model. In the disk shape,\nwith the polarization vector perpendicular to the plane of the disk, the atoms\nexperience an overall dipolar repulsion and this fact should contribute to the\nstability. However, a complete numerical solution of the dynamics leads to the\ncollapse of a strongly disk-shaped dipolar BEC due to the long-range\nanisotropic dipolar interaction. In the case of fermions, the stability of a\ntrapped single-component degenerate dipolar Fermi gas is studied including the\nHartree-Fock exchange and Brueckner-Goldstone correlation energies in the local\ndensity approximation valid for a large number of atoms. Estimates for the\nmaximum allowed number of polar Bose and Fermi molecules in BEC and degenerate\nFermi gas are given.\n", "  [Abbreviated] We review the results of high dispersion spectroscopy of 17\ncircumnuclear starforming regions (CNSFRs) in 3 nearby early spiral galaxies,\nNGC2903, NGC3310 and NGC3351. We find that single Gaussian fitting to the\nH$\\beta$ and [OIII]5007A line profiles results in velocity dispersions around\n32km/s and 52km/s, respectively, while the IR CaII triplet cross-correlation\ntechnique provides stellar velocity dispersion values close to 50km/s. Even\nthough multiple kinematical components are present, the relation between gas\nvelocity dispersion and Balmer emission line luminosity (L-sigma relation)\nreproduces the correlation for disk giant HII regions albeit with a larger\nscatter. The scatter in the L-sigma relation is considerably reduced when\ntheoretical evolutionary corrections are applied suggesting that an age range\nis present in the sample of CNSFRs. To analyse the observed complex profiles,\nwe performed multiple Gaussian component fits to the Hbeta and [OIII]?5007A\nlines obtaining optimal fits with two Gaussians of different width. These best\nfits indicate that the narrower component has average velocity dispersion close\nto 23km/s while the broader component shows average values in the range\n50-60km/s for both lines, close to the observed stellar velocity dispersions.\nThe fluxes of the broad and narrow Hbeta components are similar. This is not\nthe case for [OIII]5007A for which the broad components have higher fluxes than\nthe narrow ones, thus producing a clear segregation in their [OIII]/Hbeta\nratios. We suggest a possible scenario for understanding the behaviour of\nCNSFRs in the L-sigma and sigma_gas-sigma_star diagrams involving an inner\ngaseous disk responsible for the narrow component of the emission lines.\n", "  How does immigrant integration in a country change with immigration density?\nGuided by a statistical mechanics perspective we propose a novel approach to\nthis problem. The analysis focuses on classical integration quantifiers such as\nthe percentage of jobs (temporary and permanent) given to immigrants, mixed\nmarriages, and newborns with parents of mixed origin. We find that the average\nvalues of different quantifi?ers may exhibit either linear or non-linear growth\non immigrant density and we suggest that social action, a concept identified by\nMax Weber, causes the observed non- linearity. Using the statistical mechanics\nnotion of interaction to quantitatively emulate social action, a unified\nmathematical model for integration is proposed and it is shown to explain both\ngrowth behaviors observed. The linear theory instead, ignoring the possibility\nof interaction effects would underestimate the quantifiers up to 30% when\nimmigrant densities are low, and overestimate them as much when densities are\nhigh. The capacity to quantitatively isolate different types of integration\nmechanisms makes our framework a suitable tool in the quest for more efficient\nintegration policies.\n", "  We investigate the thermodynamics of one-dimensional Bose gases in the\nstrongly correlated regime. To this end, we prepare ensembles of independent 1D\nBose gases in a two-dimensional optical lattice and perform high-resolution in\nsitu imaging of the column-integrated density distribution. Using an inverse\nAbel transformation we derive effective one-dimensional line-density profiles\nand compare them to exact theoretical models. The high resolution allows for a\ndirect thermometry of the trapped ensembles. The knowledge about the\ntemperature enables us to extract thermodynamic equations of state such as the\nphase-space density, the entropy per particle and the local pair correlation\nfunction.\n", "  We study the Harmonic and Dirac Oscillator problem extended to a\nthree-dimensional noncom- mutative space where the noncommutativity is induced\nby a shift of the dynamical variables with generators of SL(2;R) in a unitary\nirreducible representation. The Hilbert space gets the structure of a direct\nproduct with the representation space as a factor, where there exist operators\nwhich realize the algebra of Lorentz transformations. The spectrum of these\nmodels are considered in perturbation theory, both for small and large\nnoncommutativity parameters, finding no constraints between coordinates and\nmomenta noncom- mutativity parameters. Since the representation space of the\nunitary irreducible representations SL(2;R) can be realized in terms of spaces\nof square-integrable functions, we conclude that these models are equivalent to\nquantum mechanical models of particles living in a space with an additional\ncompact dimension.\n  PACS: 03.65.-w; 11.30.Cp; 02.40.Gh\n", "  The standard method of Quantum State Tomography (QST) relies on the\nmeasurement of a set of noncommuting observables, realized in a series of\nindependent experiments. Ancilla Assisted QST (AAQST) proposed by Nieuwenhuizen\nand co-workers (Phys. Rev. Lett., 92, 120402 (2004)) greatly reduces the number\nof independent measurements by exploiting an ancilla register in a known\ninitial state. In suitable conditions AAQST allows mapping out density matrix\nof an input register in a single experiment. Here we describe methods for\nexplicit construction of AAQST experiments in multi-qubit registers. We also\nreport nuclear magnetic resonance studies on AAQST of (i) a two- qubit input\nregister using a one-qubit ancilla in an isotropic liquid-state system and (ii)\na three-qubit input register using a two-qubit ancilla register in a partially\noriented system. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of AAQST in\nsuch many-qubit registers.\n", "  The incompatibility between the Lorentz invariance of classical\nelectromagnetism and the Galilean invariance of continuum mechanics is one of\nthe major barriers to prevent two theories from merging. In this note, a\nsystematic approach of obtaining Galilean invariant field variables and\nequations of electromagnetism within the semi-relativistic limit is reviewed\nand extended. In particular, the Galilean invariant forms of Poynting's theorem\nand the momentum identity, two most important electromagnetic identities in the\nthermomechanical theory of continua, are presented. In this note, we also\nintroduce two frequently used stronger limits, namely the magnetic and the\nelectric limit. The reduction of Galilean invariant variables and equations\nwithin these stronger limits are discussed.\n", "  Imaging techniques give a fundamental support to medical diagnostics during\nthe pathology discovery as well as for the characterization of biological\nstructures. The imaging methods involve electromagnetic waves in a frequency\nrange that spans from some Hz to GHz and over. Most of these methods involve\nscanning of wide human body areas even if only small areas need to be analyzed.\nIn this paper, a numerical method to evaluate the shape of micro-structures for\napplication in the medical field, with a very low invasiveness for the human\nbody, is proposed. A flexible thin-wire antenna radiates the VHF waves and\nthen, by measuring the spatial magnetic field distribution it is possible to\nreconstruct the micro-structures image by estimating the location of the\nantenna against a sensors panel. The typical inverse problem described above is\nsolved numerically, and first simulation results are presented in order to show\nthe validity and the robustness of the proposed approach.\n", "  Graphene has vast promising applications on the nanoelectronics and\nspintronics because of its unique magnetic and electronic properties. Making\nuse of an ab initio spin-polarized density functional theory, implemented by\nthe method of Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof 06(HSE06) hybrid functional, the\nproperties of nitrogen substitutional dopants in semi-metal monolayer graphene\nwere investigated. We found from our calculation, that introducing nitrogen\ndoping would possibly break energy degeneracy with respect to spin(spin\nsymmetry breaking) at some doping concentrations with proper dopant\nconfigurations. The spin symmetry breaking would cause spin-polarized effects,\nwhich induce magnetic response in graphene. This paper systematically analyzed\nthe dependence of magnetic moments and band gaps in graphene on doping\nconcentrations of nitrogen atoms, as well as dopant configurations.\n", "  We exploit the evolution in time of the transmission matrix following pulse\nexcitation of a random medium to focus radiation at a selected time delay t'\nand position r. The temporal profile of a focused microwave pulse is the same\nas the incident Gaussian pulse. The contrast in space at time t' of the focused\nwave is determined by the participation number of transmission eigenvalues M'\nand the size N' of the measured transmission matrix. The initial rise and\nsubsequent decay in contrast observed reflects the distribution of decay rates\nof the quasi-normal modes within the sample.\n", "  We review recent theoretical and experimental efforts aimed at the\ninvestigation of the physics of interacting disordered bosons (so-called dirty\nbosons) in the context of quantum magnetism. The physics of dirty bosons is\nrelevant to a wide variety of condensed matter systems, encompassing Helium in\nporous media, granular superconductors and ultracold atoms in disordered\noptical potentials, to cite a few. Nevertheless, the understanding of the\ntransition from a localized, Bose-glass phase to an ordered, superfluid\ncondensate phase still represents a fundamentally open problem. Still to be\nconstructed is also a quantitative description of the highly inhomogeneous and\nstrongly correlated phases connected by the transition. We discuss how\ndisordered magnetic insulators in a strong magnetic field can provide a well\ncontrolled realization of the above transition. Combining numerical simulations\nwith experiments on real materials can shed light on some fundamental\nproperties of the critical behavior, such as the scaling of the critical\ntemperature to condensation close to the quantum critical point.\n", "  We demonstrate that an array of optical antennas may render a thin layer of\nrandomly oriented semiconductor nanocrystals into an enhanced and highly\ndirectional source of polarized light. The array sustains collective plasmonic\nlattice resonances which are in spectral overlap with the emission of the\nnanocrystals over narrow angular regions. Consequently, different photon\nenergies of visible light are enhanced and beamed into definite directions.\n", "  The structure optimization, phonon, and ab initio finite temperature\nmolecular dynamics calculations have been performed to predict that bilayer\nsilicene has stable structure with AB stacking geometry and is more favorable\nenergetically to synthesize than monolayer silicene, a two-dimensional\nhoneycomb lattice with buckled geometry. Marvellously, its electronic bands\nshow that the charge carriers behave like relativistic Dirac fermions with\nlinear energy dispersions near the K points. An insightful analysis has been\npresented to understand the low-energy electronic excitations based on\ntight-binding approximation, and we suggest that the component of sp3\nhybridization in the buckled geometry blocks the interlayer hopping, so the\nlinear dispersion can be preserved.\n", "  It is usually stated that quantum mechanics presents problems with the\nidentity of particles, the most radical position -supported by E. Schr\u007fodinger-\nasserting that elementary particles are not individuals. But the subject goes\ndeeper, and it is even possible to obtain states with an undefined particle\nnumber. In this work we present a set theoretical framework for the description\nof undefined particle number states in quantum mechanics which provides a\nprecise logical meaning for this notion. This construction goes in the line of\nsolving a problem posed by Y. Manin, namely, to incorporate quantum mechanical\nnotions at the foundations of mathematics. We also show that our system is\ncapable of representing quantum superpositions.\n", "  The second law of thermodynamics tells us which state transformations are so\nstatistically unlikely that they are effectively forbidden. Its original\nformulation, due to Clausius, states that \"Heat can never pass from a colder to\na warmer body without some other change, connected therewith, occurring at the\nsame time\". The second law applies to systems composed of many particles\ninteracting; however, we are seeing that one can make sense of thermodynamics\nin the regime where we only have a small number of particles interacting with a\nheat bath. Is there a second law of thermodynamics in this regime? Here, we\nfind that for processes which are cyclic or very close to cyclic, the second\nlaw for microscopic systems takes on a very different form than it does at the\nmacroscopic scale, imposing not just one constraint on what state\ntransformations are possible, but an entire family of constraints. In\nparticular, we find a family of free energies which generalise the traditional\none, and show that they can never increase. We further find that there are\nthree regimes which determine which family of second laws govern state\ntransitions, depending on how cyclic the process is. In one regime one can\ncause an apparent violation of the usual second law, through a process of\nembezzling work from a large system which remains arbitrarily close to its\noriginal state. These second laws are not only relevant for small systems, but\nalso apply to individual macroscopic systems interacting via long-range\ninteractions, which only satisfy the ordinary second law on average. By making\nprecise the definition of thermal operations, the laws of thermodynamics take\non a simple form with the first law defining the class of thermal operations,\nthe zeroeth law emerging as a unique condition ensuring the theory is\nnontrivial, and the remaining laws being a monotonicity property of our\ngeneralised free energies.\n", "  Adinkras are graphs that can describe off-shell supermultiplets in 1\ndimension with a Lie superalgebra known as Garden algebra. In this paper, I\nshow that the degrees of freedom of the adinkra can be represented by a\nsubgraph called a baobab. Because the structure of adinkras and baobabs are\nvery general, I will show that all finite-dimensional Lie superalgebras can be\nsimilarly described by more general Lie adinkras and Lie baobabs. Furthermore,\nit will be shown that adinkras can represent forward error correction block\ncodes, and bit erasures in Garden algebra adinkras can be corrected using logic\ncircuits derived from baobabs.\n", "  Densities of persistent orbital and spin magnetic moment currents of an\nelectron in a cylindrical nanolayer in the presence of external axial magnetic\nfield are considered. For the mentioned current densities analytical\nexpressions are obtained. The conditions when in the system only spin magnetic\nmoment current is present are defined. Dependencies of orbital and spin\nmagnetic moment currents on geometrical parameters of nanolayer are derived. It\nis shown that in the case of layered geometry the dependence of spin magnetic\nmoment current on radial coordinate has a non-monotonic behavior. This is the\npeculiarity of layered geometry of nanostructure and it is due to the behavior\nof wave function of the system along the radial direction. Dependent on the\ndirections of the field and orbital rotation of the electron there are defined\nvalues of radial coordinates when the orbital current disappears. The\ntransition to the case of cylindrical quantum dot is discussed as well.\n", "  A bottleneck situation in one-lane traffic-flow is typically modelled with a\nconstant demand of entering cars. However, in practice this demand may depend\non the density of cars in the bottleneck. The present paper studies a simple\nbimodal realization of this mechanism to which we refer to as density-feedback\ncontrol (DFC): If the actual density in the bottleneck is above a certain\nthreshold, the reservoir density of possibly entering cars is reduced to a\ndifferent constant value. By numerical solution of the discretized viscid\nBurgers equation a rich stationary phase diagram is found. In order to maximize\nthe flow, which is the goal of typical traffic-management strategies, we find\nthe optimal choice of the threshold. Analytical results are verified by\ncomputer simulations of the microscopic TASEP with DFC.\n", "  It is believed that there is no efficient classical algorithm to determine\nthe linear structure of Boolean function. We investigate an extension of\nSimon's period-finding quantum algorithm, and propose an efficient quantum\nalgorithm to determine the linear structure of Boolean function.\n", "  In this paper we consider geometrical two-photon optics of Bessel-Gaussian\nmodes generated in spontaneous parametric down-conversion of a Gaussian pump\nbeam. We provide a general theoretical expression for the orbital angular\nmomentum (OAM) spectrum and Schmidt number in this basis and show how this may\nbe varied by control over the radial degree of freedom, a continuous parameter\nin Bessel-Gaussian modes. As a test we first implement a back-projection\ntechnique to classically predict, by experiment, the quantum correlations for\nBessel-Gaussian modes produced by three holographic masks, a blazed axicon,\nbinary axicon and a binary Bessel function. We then proceed to test the theory\non the down-converted photons using the binary Bessel mask. We experimentally\nquantify the number of usable OAM modes and confirm the theoretical prediction\nof a flattening in the OAM spectrum and a concomitant increase in the OAM\nbandwidth. The results have implications for the control of dimensionality in\nquantum states.\n", "  Transport in InAs/GaSb heterostructures with different InAs layer thicknesses\nis studied using a six-terminal Hall bar geometry with a 2-$\\mu$m edge channel\nlength. For a sample with a 12-nm-thick InAs layer, non-local resistance\nmeasurements with various current/voltage contact configurations reveal that\nthe transport is dominated by edge channels with negligible bulk contribution.\nSystematic non-local measurements allow us to extract the resistance of\nindividual edge channels, revealing sharp resistance uctuations indicative of\ninelastic scattering. Our results show that the InAs/GaSb system can be\ntailored to have conducting edge channels while keeping a gap in the bulk\nregion and provide a way of studying 2D topological insulators even when\nquantized transport is absent.\n", "  This is an overview of the solar modulation of cosmic rays in the\nheliosphere. It is a broad topic with numerous intriguing aspects so that a\nresearch framework has to be chosen to concentrate on. The review focuses on\nthe basic paradigms and departure points without presenting advanced\ntheoretical or observational details for which there exists a large number of\ncomprehensive reviews. Instead, emphasis is placed on numerical modeling which\nhas played an increasingly significant role as computational resources have\nbecome more abundant. A main theme is the progress that has been made over the\nyears. The emphasis is on the global features of CR modulation and on the\ncauses of the observed 11-year and 22-year cycles and charge-sign dependent\nmodulation. Illustrative examples of some of the theoretical and observational\nmilestones are presented, without attempting to review all details or every\ncontribution made in this field of research. Controversial aspects are\ndiscussed where appro- priate, with accompanying challenges and future\nprospects. The year 2012 was the centennial celebration of the discovery of\ncosmic rays so that several general reviews were dedicated to historical\naspects so that such developments are brie y presented only in a few cases.\n", "  In this study for particular states of bipartite quantum system in 2n?2m\ndimensional Hilbert space state, similar to m or n-qubit density matrices\nrepresented in Bloch sphere we call them generalized Bloch sphere states(GBSS),\nwe give an efficient optimization procedure so that analytic evaluation of\nquantum discord can be performed. Using this optimization procedure, we find an\nexact analytical formula for the optimum positive operator valued measure\n(POVM) that maximize the measure of the classical correlation for these states.\nThe presented optimization procedure also is used to show that for any concave\nentropy function the same POVMs are sufficient for quantum discord of mentioned\nstates. Furthermore, We show that such optimization procedure can be used to\ncalculate the geometric measure of quantum discord (GMQD) and then an explicit\nformula for GMQD is given. Finally, a complete geometric view is presented for\nquantum discord of GBSS. Keywords: Quantum Discord, Generalized Bloch Sphere\nStates, Dirac matrices, Bipartite Quantum System. PACs Index: 03.67.-a,\n03.65.Ta, 03.65.Ud\n", "  The asteroseismic and planetary studies, like all research related to stars,\nneed precise and accurate stellar atmospheric parameters as input. We aim at\nderiving the effective temperature (Teff), the surface gravity (log g), the\nmetallicity ([Fe/H]), the projected rotational velocity (v sin i) and the MK\ntype for 169 F, G, K, and M-type Kepler targets which were observed\nspectroscopically from the ground with five different instruments. We use two\ndifferent spectroscopic methods to analyse 189 high-resolution,\nhigh-signal-to-noise spectra acquired for the 169 stars. For 67 stars, the\nspectroscopic atmospheric parameters are derived for the first time. KIC\n9693187 and 11179629 are discovered to be double-lined spectroscopic binary\nsystems. The results obtained for those stars for which independent\ndeterminations of the atmospheric parameters are available in the literature\nare used for a comparative analysis. As a result, we show that for solar-type\nstars the accuracy of present determinations of atmospheric parameters is +/-\n150 K in Teff, +/- 0.15 dex in [Fe/H], and +/-? 0.3 dex in log g. Finally, we\nconfirm that the curve-of-growth analysis and the method of spectral synthesis\nyield systematically different atmospheric parameters when they are applied to\nstars hotter than 6,000 K.\n", "  We study one-dimensional lattice systems with pair-wise interactions of\ninfinite range. We show projective convergence of Markov measures to the unique\nequilibrium state. For this purpose we impose a slightly stronger condition\nthan summability of variations on the regularity of the interaction. With our\ncondition we are able to explicitly obtain stretched exponential bounds for the\nrate of mixing of the equilibrium state. Finally we show convergence for the\nentropy of the Markov measures to that of the equilibrium state via the\nconvergence of their topological pressure.\n", "  Being able to accurately estimate stellar parameters based on spectral\nobservations is important not only for understanding the stars themselves but\nit is also vital for the determination of exoplanet parameters. M dwarfs are\ndiscussed as targets for planet detection as these stars are less massive, less\nluminous and have smaller radii making it possible to detect smaller and\nlighter planets. Therefore M-dwarfs could prove to be a valuable source for\nexamining the lower mass end of planet distribution, but in order to do that,\none must first take care to understand the characteristics of the host stars\nwell enough. Up to date, there are several families of stellar model\natmospheres. We focus on the ATLAS9, MARCS and Drift-Phoenix families in the\nM-dwarf parameter space. We examine the differences in the (Tgas, pgas)\nstructures, synthetic photometric fluxes and related colour indices.We find\ndiscrepancies in the hotter regions of the stellar atmosphere between the ATLAS\nand MARCS models. The MARCS and Drift-Phoenix models appear to agree to a\nbetter extend with variances of less than 300K. We have compiled the broad-band\nsynthetic photometric fluxes of all models for the Johnson UBVRI and 2MASS\nJHKs. The fluxes of MARCS differ from both ATLAS and Drift-Phoenix models in\nthe optical range.\n", "  A Newtonian mechanics model is essentially the model of a point body in an\ninertial reference frame. How to describe extended bodies in non-inertial\n(vibrational) reference frames with the random initial conditions? One of the\nmost general description (known as the higher derivatives formalism) consists\nin taking into account the infinite number of the higher order temporal\nderivatives of the coordinates in the Lagrange function. Such formalism\ndescribes physical objects in the infinite dimensional space does not\ncontradict quantum mechanics and infinite dimensional Hilbert space.\n", "  We challenge claims that the principle of maximum entropy production produces\nphysical phenomenological relations between conjugate currents and forces, even\nbeyond the linear regime, and that currents in networks arrange themselves to\nmaximize entropy production as the system approaches the steady state. In\nparticular: (1) we show that Ziegler's principle of thermodynamic orthogonality\nleads to stringent reciprocal relations for higher order response coefficients,\nand in the framework of stochastic thermodynamics, we exhibit a simple explicit\nmodel that does not satisfy them; (2) on a network, enforcing Kirchhoff's\ncurrent law, we show that maximization of the entropy production prescribes\nreciprocal relations between coarse-grained observables, but is not responsible\nfor the onset of the steady state, which is rather due to the minimum entropy\nproduction principle.\n", "  Single photons are of paramount importance to future quantum technologies,\nincluding quantum communication and computation. Nonlinear photonic devices\nusing parametric processes offer a straightforward route to generating photons,\nhowever additional nonlinear processes may come into play and interfere with\nthese sources. Here we analyse these sources in the presence of multi-photon\nprocesses for the first time. We conduct experiments in silicon and gallium\nindium phosphide photonic crystal waveguides which display inherently different\nnonlinear absorption processes, namely two-photon (TPA) and three-photon\nabsorption (ThPA), respectively. We develop a novel model capturing these\ndiverse effects which is in excellent quantitative agreement with measurements\nof brightness, coincidence-to-accidental ratio (CAR) and second-order\ncorrelation function g(2)(0), showing that TPA imposes an intrinsic limit on\nheralded single photon sources. We devise a new figure of merit, the quantum\nutility (QMU), enabling direct comparison and optimisation of single photon\nsources.\n", "  The new widefield radio telescopes, such as: ASKAP,MWA, LOFAR, eVLA and SKA;\nwill produce spectral-imaging data-cubes (SIDC) of unprecedented volumes in the\norder of hundreds of Petabytes. Servicing such data as images to the end-user\nmay encounter challenges unforeseen during the development of IVOA SIAP. We\ndiscuss the requirements for extremely large SIDC, and in this light we analyse\nthe applicability of approach taken in the ISO/IEC 15444 (JPEG2000) standards.\n", "  A new angular momentum projection for systems of particles with arbitrary\nspins is formulated based on the Heine-Stieltjes correspondence, which can be\nregarded as the solutions of the mean-field plus pairing model in the strong\npairing interaction G ->Infinity limit. Properties of the Stieltjes zeros of\nthe extended Heine-Stieltjes polynomials, of which the roots determine the\nprojected states, and the related Van Vleck zeros are discussed. The\nelectrostatic interpretation of these zeros is presented. As examples,\napplications to n nonidentical particles of spin-1/2 and to identical bosons or\nfermions are made to elucidate the procedure and properties of the Stieltjes\nzeros and the related Van Vleck zeros. It is shown that the new angular\nmomentum projection for n identical bosons or fermions can be simplified with\nthe branching multiplicity formula of U(N) supset O(3) and the special choices\nof the parameters used in the projection. Especially, it is shown that the\nsolutions for identical bosons can always be expressed in terms of zeros of\nJacobi polynomials. However, unlike non-identical particle systems, the\nn-coupled states of identical particles are non-orthogonal with respect to the\nmultiplicity label after the projection.\n", "  We consider tunnel ionization of an atom or molecule in a strong field within\nan analytical treatment of the R-matrix method, in which an imaginary boundary\nis set up inside the classically forbidden region that acts as a source of\nionized electrons. These electrons are then propagated in the semiclassical\napproximation, and relying on a numerical solution of the inner region, which\nis accessible using quantum chemical techniques, we describe the subsequent\nevolution of the ionized electron and the ionic core.\n  Importantly, we show that correlation interactions between the ionized\nelectrons and those left behind in the core can play a role during ionization,\nand that interactions can occur while the electron is still inside the\nclassically forbidden region that enable tunnelling from channels normally\nsubject to far greater exponential suppression since they are subject to higher\nand wider tunnelling barriers.\n  This interaction can be described analytically using saddle-point methods\nthat find the dominant contributions to the temporal, spatial and momentum\nintegrals that make up the expressions for the ionization yield. However, these\nmethods yield results for the angular distributions of the ionized electron\nthat do not necessarily match experiment and which yield physically\nunsatisfactory solutions.\n  In this report we develop a formalism to evaluate these integrals exactly,\nwhich yields more precise calculations of the angular distributions while at\nthe same time providing the language, in terms of exchange of angular momentum,\nwith which to understand their origins and their differences from previous\ncases, thus giving an insight into the fundamental physics of the correlation\ninteraction process.\n", "  We give an analytical result for the quantum Fisher information of entangled\ncoherent States in a lossy Mach-Zehnder Interferometer recently proposed by J.\nJoo et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 083601(2011)]. For small loss of photons, we\nfind that the entangled coherent state can surpass the Heisenberg limit.\nFurthermore, The formalism developed here is applicable to the study of phase\nsensitivity of multipartite entangled coherent states.\n", "  The temperature dependence of optical constants of titanium nitride thin film\nis investigated using spectroscopic ellipsometry between 1.4 to 5 eV in the\ntemperature range 300 K to 650 K in steps of 50 K. The real and imaginary parts\nof the dielectric functions \"1(E) and \"2(E) increase marginally with increase\nin temperature. A Drude Lorentz dielectric analysis based on free electron and\noscillator model are carried out to describe the temperature behavior. The\nparameters of the Lorentz oscillator model also showed that the relaxation time\ndecreased with temperature while the oscillator energies increased. This study\nshows that owing to marginal change in the refractive index with temperature,\ntitanium nitride can be employed for surface plasmon sensor applications even\nin environments where rise in temperature is imminent.\n", "  Fractional Chern insulators (FCIs), having properties similar to those of the\nfractional quantum Hall effect, have been established numerically in various\ntoy models. To fully explore their fundamental physics and to develop practical\napplications, material realization is indispensable. Here we theoretically\npredict a realization of FCI in a two-dimensional organometallic material,\nwhich is known to have the prerequisite topological at bands. Using numerical\nexact diagonalization we demonstrate that the presence of strong electronic\ncorrelations and fractional filling of such a system could lead to a rich phase\ndiagram, including Abelian fractional quantum Hall (FQH), Fermi-liquid, and\nWigner crystal states. In particular, the FQH state has been confirmed\nsystematically by calculating the topological ground-state degeneracies,\ntopological Chern number, and the quasihole excitation spectrum as well as the\nparticle entanglement spectrum. Future experimental realization of the FQH\nstate in such material may provide a route for developing practical\napplications of FCI with no need of the extreme conditions.\n", "  We study some of the salient features of the arrival statistics and\nexploration properties of mortal random walkers, that is, walkers that may die\nas they move, or as they wait to move. Such evanescence or death events have\nprofound consequences for quantities such as the number of distinct sites\nvisited which are relevant for the computation of encounter-controlled rates in\nchemical kinetics. We exploit the observation that well-known methods developed\ndecades ago for immortal walkers are widely applicable to mortal walkers. The\nparticular cases of exponential and power-law evanescence are considered in\ndetail. Finally, we discuss the relevance of our results to the target problem\nwith mortal traps and a particular application thereof, namely, the defect\ndiffusion model. Evanescence of defects is postulated as a possible\ncomplementary contribution or perhaps even an alternative to anomalous\ndiffusion to explain observed stretched exponential relaxation behavior.\n", "  In this paper, we describe the design, construction and performance of an\napparatus installed in the Aberdeen Tunnel laboratory in Hong Kong for studying\nspallation neutrons induced by cosmic-ray muons under a vertical rock\noverburden of 611 meter water equivalent (m.w.e.). The apparatus comprises of\nsix horizontal layers of plastic-scintillator hodoscopes for determining the\ndirection and position of the incident cosmic-ray muons. Sandwiched between the\nhodoscope planes is a neutron detector filled with 650 kg of liquid\nscintillator doped with about 0.06% of Gadolinium by weight for improving the\nefficiency of detecting the spallation neutrons. Performance of the apparatus\nis also presented.\n", "  Noncommutative phase spaces are generated and classified in the framework of\ncentrally extended anisotropic planar kinematical Lie groups as well as in the\nframework of noncentrally extended planar absolute time Lie groups. Through\nthese constructions the coordinates of the phase spaces do not commute due to\nthe presence of naturally introduced fields giving rise to minimal couplings.\nBy symplectic realizations methods, physical interpretations of generators\ncoming from the obtained structures are given.\n", "  Aims.The aim of this study is a detailed abundance analysis of the newly\ndiscovered r-rich star HE 1405 0822, which has [Fe=H]=-2.40. This star shows\nenhancements of both r- and s-elements, [Ba/Fe]= +1.95 and [Eu/Fe]=1.54, for\nwhich reason it is called r+s star. Methods.Stellar parameters and element\nabundances were determined by analying high-quality VLT/UVES spectra. We used\nFe I line excitation equilibria to derive the effective temperature. The\nsurface gravity was calculated from the Fei/Feii and Ti I/Ti II equilibria.\nResults.We determined accurate abundances for 39 elements, including 19\nneutron-capture elements. HE 1405-0822 is a red giant. Its strong enhancements\nof C, N, and s-elements are the consequence of enrichment by a former AGB\ncompanion with an initial mass of less than 3 M_Sun. The heavy n-capture\nelement abundances (including Eu, Yb, and Hf) seen in HE 1405-0822 do not agree\nwith the r-process pattern seen in strongly r-process-enhanced stars. We\ndiscuss possible enrichment scenarios for this star. The enhanced alpha\nelements can be explained as the result of enrichment by supernovae of type II.\nNa and Mg may have partly been synthesized in a former AGB companion, when the\nprimary 22^Ne acted as a neutron poison in the 13^C-pocket.\n", "  Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), neutron diffaction (ND), x-ray diffraction,\nmagnetic susceptibility and specific heat measurements on the frustrated A-site\nspinel CoAl2O4 compound reveal a collinear antiferromagnetic ordering below Tn\n= 9.8(2) K. A high quality powder sample characterized by x-ray diffraction\nthat indicates a relatively low Co-Al inversion parameter x = 0.057(20) in\n(Co1-xAlx)[Al2-xCox]O4, shows a broad maximum around 15 K in magnetic\nsusceptibility and a sharp peak at Tn in heat capacity. The average ordered\nmagnetic moment of Co^2+ (S = 3/2) ions at the A-site is estimated to be 2.4(1)\nBohr magneton from NMR and 1.9(5) Bohr magneton from ND which are smaller than\nthe expected value of 3 Bohr magneton for S = 3/2 and g = 2. Antiferromagnetic\nspin uctuations and correlations in the paramagnetic state are revealed from\nthe magnetic susceptibility, NMR and ND measurements, which are due to spin\nfrustration and site inversion effects in the system. The ND data also show\nshort-range dynamic magnetic ordering that persists to a temperature that is\nalmost twice Tn.\n", "  We discuss the process to obtain Poisson brackets among the phase-space\nvariables of a system of a charged particle on a Poincar\\'e hyperboloid in the\npresence of a uniform magnetic field. We show that after quantization the Dirac\nbracket algebra becomes the algebra of ISO(1,2). The representation of this\nalgebra is explicitly analyzed and the Hamiltonian of this system has been\nderived.\n", "  Dimensional analysis is a simple qualitative method for determining essential\nconnections between physical quantities. It is applicable to a multitude of\nphysics problems, many of which canbe introduced early on in a university\nphysics curriculum. Despite the relative simplicity of theapproach, it is\nrarely included in physics curricula. Here, we apply dimensional analysis to\nfind the radiated power from an electric dipole. Employing dimensional\nanalysis, we demonstrate a straightforward way to derive the latter without the\nneed for complex mathematical treatments.\n", "  We have investigated the influence of 3d-4f spin interaction on magnetic and\nmagnetocaloric properties of DyCrO$_4$ and HoCrO$_4$ compounds by magnetization\nand heat capacity measurements. Both the compounds exhibit complicated magnetic\nproperties and huge magnetic entropy change around the ferromagnetic transition\ndue to the strong competition between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic\nsuperexchange interactions. For a field change of 8 T, the maximum values of\nmagnetic entropy change ($\\Delta S_{M}^{max}$), adiabatic temperature change\n($\\Delta T_{ad}$), and refrigerant capacity (RC) reach 29 J kg$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$,\n8 K, and 583 J kg$^{-1}$, respectively for DyCrO$_4$ whereas the corresponding\nvalues for HoCrO$_4$ are 31 J kg$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$, 12 K, and 622 J kg$^{-1}$.\n$\\Delta S_{M}^{max}$, $\\Delta T_{ad}$, and RC are also quite large for a\nmoderate field change. The large values of magnetocaloric parameters suggest\nthat the zircon-type DyCrO$_4$ and HoCrO$_4$ could be the potential magnetic\nrefrigerant materials for liquefaction of hydrogen.\n", "  We explain a new construction of self-dual string solutions to the\nnon-abelian two-form self-duality equation proposed in \\cite{CK}. This class of\nself-dual strings is determined by the BPS monopoles in four-dimensions and the\nself dual string charge is given by the charge of the monopole. Our\nconstruction covers the SO(4) invariant self-dual string solutions found\npreviously. We have also constructed, based on the 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole,\na singular solution that describes two finitely separated M5-branes meeting\nmidway in between. We comment that as BPS monopoles are generally given by the\nNahm construction, our construction suggests that a generalized Nahm transform\nmay exist for the non-abelian self-dual strings.\n", "  The superconducting state formed due to direct intra-orbital pairing in\ntetragonal multi-band superconductor Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ has different properties\nthan the state formed due to intra-band pairing. In particular, the theory\noperating with direct intra-orbital pairing successfully explains the Kerr\nrotation of reflected light polarization observed several years ago. Here we\napply intra-orbital approach to the problem of Ginzburg-Landau description of\nbasal plane upper critical field in this material. It is shown that typical for\ntwo component superconducting state additional phase transition in the vortex\nstate at $H<H_{c2}$ for all four crystallographic directions of magnetic field\nin the basal plane and the basal plane upper critical field anisotropy still\nare inevitable properties even in case of direct intra-orbital pairing.\n", "  At present there is an effort to reconcile the results of the DAMA experiment\nwith those from other Dark Matter experiments such as CoGeNT, CRESST, CDMS, and\nall LXe experiments. The author suggests a new model describing the Dark Matter\nsignal as the result of collisions of very light (1-to-few GeV/c^2) WIMPs with\nhydrogen, and compares it with currently accepted models of collisions with\nheavy nuclei (Na, Ge or Xe). The hydrogen target would come from\nH-contamination of NaI(Tl), Ge and CaWO4 crystals. Initial tuning indicates\nthat one can explain the modulation amplitude of DAMA and CoGeNT with this\nmodel, assuming a WIMP-proton cross section between 10^33 and 10^32 cm^2. This\npaper should be considered to be a new idea which will need substantial new\nexperimental input from all involved experiments.\n", "  Every Maximally Entangled State (MES) of two d-dimensional particles is shown\nto be a product state of suitably chosen collective coordinates. The state may\nbe viewed as defining a \"point\" in a \"phase space\" like d^2 array representing\nd^2 orthonormal Maximally Entangled States basis for the Hilbert space. A\nfinite geometry view of MES is presented and its relation with the afore\nmentioned \"phase space\" is outlined: \"straight lines\" in the space depict\nproduct of single particle mutually unbiased basis (MUB) states, inverting\nthereby Schmidt's diagonalization scheme in giving a product single particle\nstates as a d-terms sum of maximally entangled states. To assure self\nsufficiency the essential mathematical results are summarized in the\nappendices.\n", "  Understanding how stimuli and synaptic connectivity in uence the statistics\nof spike patterns in neural networks is a central question in computational\nneuroscience. Maximum Entropy approach has been successfully used to\ncharacterize the statistical response of simultaneously recorded spiking\nneurons responding to stimuli. But, in spite of good performance in terms of\nprediction, the fitting parameters do not explain the underlying mechanistic\ncauses of the observed correlations. On the other hand, mathematical models of\nspiking neurons (neuro-mimetic models) provide a probabilistic mapping between\nstimulus, network architecture and spike patterns in terms of conditional\nproba- bilities. In this paper we build an exact analytical mapping between\nneuro-mimetic and Maximum Entropy models.\n", "  The so-called measurement problem of quantum theory (QT) is still lacking a\nsatisfactory, or at least widely agreed upon, solution. A number of theories,\nknown as interpretations of quantum theory, have been proposed and found\ndiffering acceptance among physicists. Most of the proposed theories try to\nexplain what happens during a QT measurement using a modification of the\ndeclarative equations that define the possible results of a measurement of QT\nobservables or by making assumptions outside the scope of falsifiable physics.\nThis paper proposes a solution to the QT measurement problem in terms of a\nmodel of the process for the evolution of two QT systems that interact in a way\nthat represents a measurement. The model assumes that the interactions between\nthe measured QT object and the measurement apparatus are \"normal\" interactions\nwhich adhere to the laws of quantum field theory. This causes certain\nlimitations associated with QT measurements.\n", "  BL Lac objects are active nuclei, hosted in massive elliptical galaxies, the\nemission of which is dominated by a relativistic jet closely aligned with the\nline of sight. This implies the existence of a parent population of sources\nwith a misaligned jet, that have been identified with low-power radiogalaxies.\nThe spectrum of BL Lacs, dominated by non-thermal emission over the whole\nelectromagnetic range, together with bright compact radio cores, high\nluminosities, rapid and large amplitude flux variability at all frequencies and\nstrong polarization make these sources an optimal laboratory for high energy\nastrophysics. A most distinctive characteristic of the class is the weakness or\nabsence of spectral lines, that historically hindered the identification of\ntheir nature and ever thereafter proved to be a hurdle in the determination of\ntheir distance. In this paper we review the main observational facts that\ncontribute to the present basic interpretation of this class of active\ngalaxies. We overview the history of the BL Lac objects research field and\ntheir population as it emerged from multi-wavelength surveys. The properties of\nthe flux variability and polarization, compared with those at radio, X-ray and\ngamma-ray frequencies, are summarized together with the present knowledge of\nthe host galaxies, their environments, and central black hole masses. We focus\nthis review on the optical observations, that played a crucial role in the\nearly phase of BL Lacs studies, and, in spite of extensive radio, X-ray, and\nrecently gamma-ray observations, could represent the future major contribution\nto the unveiling of the origin of these sources. In particular they could\nprovide a firm conclusion on the long debated issue of the cosmic evolution of\nthis class of active galactic nuclei and on the connection between formation of\nsupermassive black holes and relativistic jets.\n", "  In this paper we address the one-dimensional problem of stochastic renewal in\ndifferent damping environments. An ensemble of particles with some specified\ninitial distribution in phase space are allowed to evolve stochastically till a\ncertain instant of time (say,$tau$), when a restoring force is applied to bring\nthem back to some point in configuration space. The physical quantities of\ninterest that have been studied are the Survival Probability and the First\nPassage distribution for return to the specified target point. We observe\nnontrivial dependence of these quantities on $tau$ as well as on the width of\nthe initial distribution, which has been taken to be Gaussian in position and\nvelocity.\n", "  This paper reports the development of a methodology combining microstrip\nferromagnetic resonance (MS-FMR) and digital image correlation (DIC) in order\nto silmuteanously measure the voltage-induced strains and the magnetic\nresonance in artificial magnetoelectric heterostructures (magnetic\nfilms/piezoelectric substrate? or magnetic films/flexible\nsubstrate/piezoelectric actuator ?). The overall principle of the technique and\nthe related analytical modelling are described. It is powerful to estimate the\nmagnetostriction coefficient of ferromagnetic thin films and can be used to\ndetermine the effective magnetoelectric coefficient of the whole\nheterostructures in addition to the piezoelectric coefficient related to the\nin-plane voltage-induced strains. This methodology can be applied to system for\nwhich the strains are well transmitted at the different interfaces.\n", "  The spectrum of r-1 and r-2 type potentials of diatomic molecules in radial\nSchrodinger equation are calculated by using the formalism of asymptotic\niteration method. The alternative method is used to solve eigenvalues and\neigenfunctions of Mie potential, Kratzer-Fues potential, Coulomb potential, and\nPseudoharmonic potential by determining the $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma$ and\n$\\sigma$ parameters.\n"]}
