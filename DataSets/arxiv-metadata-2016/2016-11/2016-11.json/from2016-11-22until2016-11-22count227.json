We cool a\nsingle ion with a laser on the 2S1/2 to 2P1/2 transition as usual, but repump\nvia the 2P3/2 level. By filtering out light on the cooling transition and\ndetecting only the fluorescence from the 2P_3/2 to 2S1/2 decays, we suppress\nthe scattered laser light background count rate to 1 per second while\nmaintaining a signal of 29000 per second with moderate saturation of the\ncooling transition. This scheme will be particularly useful for experiments\nwhere ions are trapped in close proximity to surfaces, such as the trap\nelectrodes in microfabricated ion traps, which leads to high background scatter\nfrom the cooling beam.\n", "  We give detailed exposition of modern differential geometry from global\ncoordinate independent point of view as well as local coordinate description\nsuited for actual computations. In introduction, we consider Euclidean spaces\nand different structures on it; rotational, Lorentz, and Poincare groups;\nspecial relativity. The main body of the manuscript includes manifolds, tensor\nfields, differential forms, integration, Riemannian and Lorentzian metrics,\nconnection on vector and frame fiber bundles, affine geometry, Lie groups,\ntransformation groups, homotopy and fundamental group, coverings, principal and\nassociated fiber bundles, connections on fiber bundles, Killing vector fields,\ngeodesics and extremals, symplectic and Poisson manifolds, Clifford algebras,\nprinciple of least action, canonical formalism for constrained systems.\nApplications of differential geometry in quantum theory (adiabatic theorem,\nBerry phase, Aharonov-Bohm effect), general relativity and geometric theory of\ndefects are described. We give introduction to general relativity and its\nHamiltonian formulation; describe scalar, spinor, electromagnetic and\nYang-Mills fields. Riemannian and Lorentzian surfaces with one Killing vector\nfield are discussed in detail, and their global structure is described using\nconformal block method. We also classified all global vacuum solutions of the\nEinstein equations, which have the form of warped product metrics of two\nsurfaces. The manuscript is not a textbook, and intended for efficient reader.\n", "  Previously, Pahlavan, Rouhani and Takook have introduced a novel $N=1$\nsuper-symmetric algebra in de Sitter space-time. This paper is an attempt to\nbuild a proper $N=1$ super-symmetric field theory of classical level in the de\nSitter space. The generators, gauge transformations and different fields in a\n5-dimensional ambient space notation are defined and corresponding super-space\nand super-fields are introduced. Finally, the $N=1$ super-symmetry Lagrangian\nin the de Sitter ambient space notation has been derived.\n", "  We study the non-equilibrium transport properties of a highly anisotropic\ntwo-dimensional lattice of spin-1/2 particles governed by a Heisenberg XXZ\nHamiltonian. The anisotropy of the lattice allows us to approximate the system\nat finite temperature as an array of incoherently coupled one-dimensional\nchains. We show that in the regime of strong intrachain interactions, the weak\ninterchain coupling considerably boosts spin transport in the driven system.\nInterestingly, we show that this enhancement increases with the length of the\nchains, which is related to superdiffusive spin transport. We describe the\nmechanism behind this effect, compare it to a similar phenomenon in single\nchains induced by dephasing, and explain why the former is much stronger.\n", "  We apply the method of direct perturbation theory for the Foldy-Wouthuysen\n(FW) transformation upon the Dirac-Pauli Hamiltonian subject to external\nelectromagnetic fields. The exact FW transformations exist and agree with those\nobtained by Eriksen's method for two special cases. In the weak-field limit of\nstatic and homogeneous electromagnetic fields, by mathematical induction on the\norders of $1/c$ in the power series, we rigorously prove the long-held\nspeculation: the FW transformed Dirac-Pauli Hamiltonian is in full agreement\nwith the classical counterpart, which is the sum of the orbital Hamiltonian for\nthe Lorentz force equation and the spin Hamiltonian for the\nThomas-Bargmann-Michel-Telegdi equation.\n", "  In this study we, remembering the experience with topological Dirac variables\nin the non-Abelian Yang-Mills-Higgs (YMH) model with vacuuum BPS monopole\nsolutions, attempt to construct similar for the Abelian $U(1)$ model. We show\nthat QED, as one understands it commonly, is only the topologically trivial\nsector ($n=0$) of this Abelian $U(1)$ model. For $n\\neq 0$ one gets Dirac\nmonopole modes. In both the cases, $n=0$ and $n\\neq 0$, the theory can be\nquantized via the Hamiltonian reduction in terms of Dirac variables.\n", "  We compute the probability that a bipartite quantum state is separable by\nMonte Carlo sampling. This is carried out for rebits, qubits and quaterbits. We\nsampled $5\\times 10^{11}$ points for each of these three cases. The results\nstrongly support conjectures for certain rational values of these probabilities\nthat have been found by other methods.\n", "  The search for topologically non-trivial states of matter has become an\nimportant goal for condensed matter physics. Here, we give a theoretical\nintroduction to the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect based on magnetic\ntopological insulators in two-dimension (2D) and three-dimension (3D). In 2D\ntopological insulators, magnetic order breaks the symmetry between the\ncounter-propagating helical edge states, and as a result, the quantum spin Hall\neffect can evolve into the QAH effect. In 3D, magnetic order opens up a gap for\nthe topological surface states, and chiral edge state has been predicted to\nexist on the magnetic domain walls. We present the phase diagram in thin films\nof a magnetic topological insulator and review the basic mechanism of\nferromagnetic order in magnetically doped topological insulators. We also\nreview the recent experimental observation of the QAH effect. We discuss more\nrecent theoretical work on the coexistence of the helical and chiral edge\nstates, multi-channel chiral edge states, the theory of the plateau transition,\nand the thickness dependence in the QAH effect.\n", "  The idea of blocking in configuration space has played an important role in\nthe development of the RG ideas. However, despite being half a century old and\nhaving had a huge intellectual impact, generic numerical methods to perform\nblocking for lattice models have progressed more slowly than sampling methods.\nBlocking may be essential to deal with near conformal situations. Typically,\nblocking methods have smaller statistical errors but larger systematic errors\nthan sampling methods. This situation is evolving with recent developments\nbased on the Tensor RG (TRG) method. We report recent results for spin and\ngauge lattice models obtained with this new method regarding searches for fixed\npoints, calculations of critical exponents and resolutions of sign problems. An\ninteresting model for comparison is the 2-dimensional O(2) model with a\nchemical potential which has a sign problem with conventional Monte Carlo but\nallows sampling with the worm algorithm and blocking with various TRG\nformulations. We compare the efficiency and accuracy of these two methods.\n", "  We compute the $B\\to\\pi\\ell\\nu$ semileptonic form factors and update the\ndetermination of the CKM matrix element $|V_{ub}|$. We use the MILC asqtad\nensembles with $N_f=2+1$ sea quarks at four different lattice spacings in the\nrange $a \\approx 0.045$~fm to $0.12$~fm. The lattice form factors are\nextrapolated to the continuum limit using SU(2) staggered chiral perturbation\ntheory in the hard pion limit, followed by an extrapolation in $q^2$ to the\nfull kinematic range using a functional $z$-parameterization. The extrapolation\nis combined with the experimental measurements of the partial branching\nfraction to extract $|V_{ub}|$. Our preliminary result is $|V_{ub}|=(3.72\\pm\n0.14)\\times 10^{-3}$, where the error reflects both the lattice and\nexperimental uncertainties, which are now on par with each other.\n", "  We present a study of spectroscopy of SU(4) lattice gauge theory coupled to\ntwo flavors of Dirac fermions in the anti-symmetric two index representation.\nThe fermion representation is real, and the pattern of chiral symmetry breaking\nis SU(2Nf) -> SO(2Nf) with Nf flavors of Dirac fermions. It is an interesting\ngeneralization of QCD, for several reasons: it allows direct exploration of an\nalternate large Nc expansion, it can be simulated at non-zero chemical\npotential with no sign problem, and several UV completions of composite Higgs\nsystems are built on it. We present preliminary results on the baryon and meson\nspectra of the theory and compare them with SU(3) results and with expectations\nfor large Nc scaling.\n", "  Compressible flows around blunt objects have diverse applications, but\npresent analytic treatments are inaccurate and limited to narrow parameter\nregimes. We show that the flow in front of an axisymmetric body is accurately\nderived analytically using a low order expansion of the perpendicular gradients\nin terms of the parallel velocity. This reproduces both subsonic and supersonic\nflows measured and simulated for a sphere, including the transonic regime and\nthe bow shock properties.\n", "  A search for pair production of third-generation scalar leptoquarks decaying\nto top quark and tau lepton pairs is presented using proton-proton collision\ndata at a center-of-mass energy of sqrt(s) = 8 TeV collected with the CMS\ndetector at the LHC and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7\ninverse femtobarns. The search is performed using events that contain an\nelectron or a muon, a hadronically decaying tau lepton, and two or more jets.\nThe observations are found to be consistent with the standard model\npredictions. Assuming that all leptoquarks decay to a top quark and a tau\nlepton, the existence of pair produced, charge -1/3, third-generation\nleptoquarks up to a mass of 685 GeV is excluded at 95% confidence level. This\nresult constitutes the first direct limit for leptoquarks decaying into a top\nquark and a tau lepton, and may also be applied directly to the pair production\nof bottom squarks decaying predominantly via the R-parity violating coupling\nlambda'[333].\n", "  Tensor network states and specifically matrix-product states have proven to\nbe a powerful tool for simulating ground states of strongly correlated spin\nmodels. Recently, they have also been applied to interacting fermionic\nproblems, specifically in the context of quantum chemistry. A new freedom\narising in such non-local fermionic systems is the choice of orbitals, it being\nfar from clear what choice of fermionic orbitals to make. In this work, we\npropose a way to overcome this challenge. We suggest a method intertwining the\noptimisation over matrix product states with suitable fermionic Gaussian mode\ntransformations. The described algorithm generalises basis changes in the\nspirit of the Hartree-Fock method to matrix-product states, and provides a\nblack box tool for basis optimisation in tensor network methods.\n", "  Modified gravity and generalized second law (GSL) of thermodynamics are\ninteresting topics in the modern cosmology. In this regard, we investigate the\nGSL of gravitational thermodynamics in the framework of modified Gauss-Bonnet\ngravity or f(G)-gravity. We consider a spatially FRW universe filled with the\nmatter and radiation enclosed by the dynamical apparent horizon with the\nHawking temperature. For two viable f(G) models, we first numerically solve the\nset of differential equations governing the dynamics of f(G)-gravity. Then, we\nobtain the evolutions of the Hubble parameter, the Gauss-Bonnet curvature\ninvariant term, the density and equation of state parameters as well as the\ndeceleration parameter. In addition, we check the energy conditions for both\nmodels and finally examine the validity of the GSL. For the selected f(G)\nmodels, we conclude that both models have a stable de Sitter attractor. The\nequation of state parameters behave quite similar to those of the LCDM model in\nthe radiation/matter dominated epochs, then they enter the phantom region\nbefore reaching the de Sitter attractor with w=-1. The deceleration parameter\nstarts from the radiation/matter dominated eras, then transits from a cosmic\ndeceleration to acceleration and finally approaches a de Sitter regime at late\ntimes, as expected. Furthermore, the GSL is respected for both models during\nthe standard radiation/matter dominated epochs. Thereafter when the universe\nbecomes accelerating, the GSL is violated in some ranges of scale factor. At\nlate times, the evolution of the GSL predicts an adiabatic behavior for the\naccelerated expansion of the universe.\n", "  We consider four dimensional CHL models with sixteen spacetime\nsupersymmetries obtained from orbifolds of type IIA superstring on K3 x T^2 by\na Z_N symmetry acting (possibly) non-geometrically on K3. We show that most of\nthese models (in particular, for geometric symmetries) are self-dual under a\nweak-strong duality acting on the heterotic axio-dilaton modulus S by a \"Fricke\ninvolution\" S --> -1/NS. This is a novel symmetry of CHL models that lies\noutside of the standard SL(2,Z)-symmetry of the parent theory, heterotic\nstrings on T^6. For self-dual models this implies that the lattice of purely\nelectric charges is N-modular, i.e. isometric to its dual up to a rescaling of\nits quadratic form by N. We verify this prediction by determining the lattices\nof electric and magnetic charges in all relevant examples. We also calculate\ncertain BPS-saturated couplings and verify that they are invariant under the\nFricke S-duality. For CHL models that are not self-dual, the strong coupling\nlimit is dual to type IIA compactified on T^6/Z_N, for some Z_N-symmetry\npreserving half of the spacetime supersymmetries.\n", "  One-atom thick crystalline layers and their vertical heterostructures carry\nthe promise of designer electronic materials that are unattainable by standard\ngrowth techniques. In order to realize their potential it is necessary to\nisolate them from environmental disturbances in particular those introduced by\nthe substrate. But finding and characterizing suitable substrates, and\nminimizing the random potential fluctuations they introduce, has been a\npersistent challenge in this emerging field. Here we show that Landau-level\n(LL) spectroscopy is exquisitely sensitive to potential fluctuations on both\nlocal and global length scales. Harnessing this technique we demonstrate that\nthe insertion of an intermediate graphene layer provides superior screening of\nsubstrate induced disturbances, more than doubling the electronic mean free\npath. Furthermore, we find that the proximity of hBN acts as a nano-scale\nvacuum cleaner, dramatically suppressing the global potential fluctuations.\nThis makes it possible to fabricate high quality devices on standard SiO2\nsubstrates.\n", "  We investigate some simple and surprising properties of a one-dimensional\nBrownian trajectory with diffusion coefficient $D$ that starts at the origin\nand reaches $X$ either: (i) at time $T$ or (ii) for the first time at time $T$.\nWe determine the most likely location of the first-passage trajectory from\n$(0,0)$ to $(X,T)$ and its distribution at any intermediate time $t<T$. A\nfirst-passage path typically starts out by being repelled from its final\nlocation when $X^2/DT\\ll 1$. We also determine the distribution of times when\nthe trajectory first crosses and last crosses an arbitrary intermediate\nposition $x<X$. The distribution of first-crossing times may be unimodal or\nbimodal, depending on whether $X^2/DT\\ll 1$ or $X^2/DT\\gg 1$. The form of the\nfirst-crossing probability in the bimodal regime is qualitatively similar to,\nbut more singular than, the well-known arcsine law.\n", "  Light carries spin and orbital angular momentum. These dynamical properties\nare determined by the polarization and spatial degrees of freedom of light.\nModern nano-optics, photonics, and plasmonics, tend to explore subwavelength\nscales and additional degrees of freedom of structured, i.e.,\nspatially-inhomogeneous, optical fields. In such fields, spin and orbital\nproperties become strongly coupled with each other. We overview the fundamental\norigins and important applications of the main spin-orbit interaction phenomena\nin optics. These include: spin-Hall effects in inhomogeneous media and at\noptical interfaces, spin-dependent effects in nonparaxial (focused or\nscattered) fields, spin-controlled shaping of light using anisotropic\nstructured interfaces (metasurfaces), as well as robust spin-directional\ncoupling via evanescent near fields. We show that spin-orbit interactions are\ninherent in all basic optical processes, and they play a crucial role at\nsubwavelength scales and structures in modern optics.\n", "  The role of noise in the transport properties of quantum excitations is a\ntopic of great importance in many fields, from organic semiconductors for\ntechnological applications to light-harvesting complexes in photosynthesis. In\nthis paper we study a semi-classical model where a tight-binding Hamiltonian is\nfully coupled to an underlying spatially extended nonlinear chain of atoms. We\nshow that the transport properties of a quantum excitation are subtly modulated\nby (i) the specific type (local vs non-local) of exciton-phonon coupling and by\n(ii) nonlinear effects of the underlying lattice. We report a non-monotonic\ndependence of the exciton diffusion coefficient on temperature, in agreement\nwith earlier predictions, as a direct consequence of the lattice-induced\nfluctuations in the hopping rates due to long-wavelength vibrational modes. A\nstandard measure of transport efficiency confirms that both nonlinearity in the\nunderlying lattice and off-diagonal exciton-phonon coupling promote transport\nefficiency at high temperatures, preventing the Zeno-like quench observed in\nother models lacking an explicit noise-providing dynamical system.\n", "  It has been shown that there are not only transverse but also longitudinal\ncouplings between microwave fields and a superconducting qubit with broken\ninversion symmetry of the potential energy. Using multiphoton processes induced\nby longitudinal coupling fields and frequency matching conditions, we design a\nuniversal algorithm to produce arbitrary superpositions of two-mode photon\nstates of microwave fields in two separated transmission line resonators, which\nare coupled to a superconducting qubit. Based on our algorithm, we analyze the\ngeneration of evenly-populated states and NOON states. Compared to other\nproposals with only single-photon process, we provide an efficient way to\nproduce entangled microwave states when the interactions between\nsuperconducting qubits and microwave fields are in the ultrastrong regime.\n", "  In quantum gravity, a foamy structure of space-time leads to Lorentz\ninvariance violation (LIV). As the most energetic astrophysical processes in\nthe Universe, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) provide an effective way to probe quantum\ngravity effects. We use continuous spectra of 20 short GRBs detected by the\nSwift satellite to give a conservative lower limit of quantum gravity energy\nscale $M_\\textrm{QG} $. Due to the LIV effect, photons with different energy\nhave different velocities. This will lead to the delayed arrival of high energy\nphotons relative to the low energy ones. Based on the fact that the LIV-induced\ntime delay can't be longer than the duration of a GRB, we present the most\nconservative estimation of the quantum gravity energy scales from 20 short\nGRBs. The most strict constraint, $M_\\textrm{QG}>5.05\\times10^{14}$ GeV, is\nfrom GRB 140622A.\n", "  Various groups have demonstrated that antineutrino monitoring can be\nsuccessful in assessing the plutonium content in water-cooled nuclear reactors\nfor nonproliferation applications. New reactor designs and concepts incorporate\nnontraditional fuels types and chemistry. Understanding how these properties\naffect the antineutrino emission from a reactor can extend the applicability of\nantineutrino monitoring. Thorium molten salt reactors (MSR) breed U-233, that\nif diverted constitute a direct use material as defined by the International\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The antineutrino spectrum from the fission of\nU-233 has been estimated for the first time, and the feasibility of detecting\nthe diversion of 8 kg of U-233, within a 30 day timeliness goal has been\nevaluated. The antineutrino emission from a thorium reactor operating under\nnormal conditions is compared to a diversion scenario by evaluating the daily\nantineutrino count rate and the energy spectrum of the detected antineutrinos\nat a 25 meter standoff. It was found that the diversion of a significant\nquantity of U-233 could not be detected within the current IAEA timeliness\ndetection goal using either tests. A rate-time based analysis exceeded the\ntimeliness goal by 23 days, while a spectral based analysis exceeds this goal\nby 31 days.\n", "  We present a coarse-grained model for evaluation of interactions of globular\nproteins with nanoparticles. The protein molecules are represented by one bead\nper aminoacid and the nanoparticle by a homogeneous sphere that interacts with\nthe aminoacids via a central force that depends on the nanoparticle size. The\nproposed methodology is used to predict the adsorption energies for six common\nhuman blood plasma proteins on hydrophobic charged or neutral nanoparticles of\ndifferent sizes as well as the preferred orientation of the molecules upon\nadsorption. Our approach allows one to rank the proteins by their binding\naffinity to the nanoparticle, which can be used for predicting the composition\nof the NP-protein corona. The predicted ranking is in good agreement with known\nexperimental data for protein adsorption on surfaces.\n", "  In November 2010, we performed a search for a $^{4}\\mbox{He}$-$\\eta$ bound\nstate by measuring the excitation function for the $dd\\rightarrow$\n$^{3}\\mbox{He} n \\pi{}^{0}$ and $dd\\rightarrow$ $^{3}\\mbox{He} p \\pi{}^{-}$\nreactions in the vicinity of the $\\eta$ production threshold with the WASA\ndetector.~The experiment was carried out using a deuteron COSY beam and\ndeuteron pellet target. The beam momentum varied continuously in each of\nacceleration cycle from 2.127 GeV/c to 2.422 GeV/c, which corresponds to a\nrange of excess energy $Q$ $\\in$(-70,30)MeV. This dissertation is about the\nsearch for $^{4}\\mbox{He}$-$\\eta$ bound state in $dd\\rightarrow$ $^{3}\\mbox{He}\nn \\pi{}^{0}$ reaction. The excitation function for the process was determined\nafter identification of all outgoing particles and the application of the\nselection conditions based on Monte Carlo simulations of $\\eta$-mesic helium\nproduction and its decay via excitation of the $N^{*}$ resonance. No narrow\nstructure of the $\\eta$-mesic helium was observed in the excitation function.\nThe upper limit of the total cross section for the bound state formation and\nits decay in $dd\\rightarrow({}^{4}\\mbox{He}$-$\\eta)_{bound} \\rightarrow$\n$^{3}\\mbox{He} n \\pi{}^{0}$ process was determined on the 90% confidence level.\nIt varies from 21 to 36 nb for the bound state width ranging from 5 MeV to 50\nMeV, respectively. However, an indication for a broad state was observed. The\nkinematic region, where we expect the evidence of the signal from the bound\nstate, cannot be fully described only by the combination of the considered\nbackground processes. In contrast, the experimental excitation function is very\nwell fitted by the background contributions for the region where the signal is\nnot expected.\n", "  Edge effects play an important role for many properties of graphene. While\nmost works have focused on the effects from isolated free edges, we present a\nnovel knotting phenomenon induced by the interactions between a pair of free\nedges in graphene, and investigate its effect on the buckling of monolayer\ngraphene. Upon compression, the buckling of graphene starts gradually in the\nform of two buckling waves from the warped edges. The collision of these two\nbuckling waves results in the creation of a knot structure in graphene. The\nknot structure enables the buckled graphene to exhibit two unique post-buckling\ncharacteristics. First, it induces a five-fold increase in graphene's\nmechanical stiffness during the buckling process. Second, the knotted structure\nenables graphene to exhibit a mechanically stable post-buckling regime over a\nlarge (3%) compressive strain regime, which is significantly larger than the\ncritical buckling strain of about 0.5%. The combination of these two effects\nenables graphene to exhibit an unexpected post-buckling stability that has\npreviously not been reported. We predict that numerical simulations or\nexperiments should observe two distinct stress strain relations for the\nbuckling of identical graphene samples, due to the characteristic randomness in\nthe formation process of the knot structure.\n", "  Consideration of various hydrodynamic phenomena involves the study of the\nNavier-Stokes (N-S) equations, what is hard enough for analytical and numerical\ninvestigations since already in three-dimensional (3D) case it is a challenging\ntask to study the limit behavior of N-S solutions. The low-order models (LOMs)\nderived from the initial N-S equations by Galerkin method allow one to overcome\ndifficulties in studying the limit behavior and existence of attractors. Among\nthe simple LOMs with chaotic attractors there are famous Lorenz system, which\nis an approximate model of two-dimensional convective flow and\nGlukhovsky-Dolzhansky model, which describes a convective process in\nthree-dimensional rotating fluid and can be considered as an approximate model\nof the World Ocean. One of the widely used dimensional characteristics of\nattractors is the Lyapunov dimension. In the study we follow a rigorous\napproach for the definition of the Lyapunov dimension and justification of its\ncomputation by the Kaplan-Yorke formula, without using statistical physics\nassumptions. The exact Lyapunov dimension formula for the global attractors is\nobtained and peculiarities of the Lyapunov dimension estimation for\nself-excited and hidden attractors are discussed. A tutorial on numerical\nestimation of the Lyapunov dimension on the example of the\nGlukhovsky-Dolzhansky model is presented.\n", "  Quantum channels, which are completely positive and trace preserving\nmappings, can alter the dimension of a system; e.g., a quantum channel from a\nqubit to a qutrit. We study the convex set properties of dimension-altering\nquantum channels, and particularly the channel decomposition problem in terms\nof convex sum of extreme channels. We provide various quantum circuit\nrepresentations of extreme and generalized extreme channels, which can be\nemployed in an optimization to approximately decompose an arbitrary channel.\nNumerical simulations of low-dimensional channels are performed to demonstrate\nour channel decomposition scheme.\n", "  The effect of pressure on the structural, elastic and electronic properties\nof the intermetallic compound MgCu with a CsCl-type structure have been\ninvestigated using ab-initio technique. The optical properties have been\nstudied under normal pressure. We have carried out the plane-wave\npseudopotential approach within the framework of the first-principle density\nfunctional theory (DFT) implemented within the CASTEP code. The calculated\nstructural parameters show a good agreement with the experimental and other\ntheoretical results.\n", "  The spin-momentum locking at the Dirac surface state of a topological\ninsulator (TI) offers a distinct possibility of a highly efficient\ncharge-to-spin current (C-S) conversion compared with spin Hall effects in\nconventional paramagnetic metals. For the development of TI-based spin current\ndevices, it is essential to evaluate its conversion efficiency quantitatively\nas a function of the Fermi level EF position. Here we exemplify a coefficient\nof qICS to characterize the interface C-S conversion effect by using spin\ntorque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) for (Bi1-xSbx)2Te3 thin films whose EF\nis tuned across the band gap. In bulk insulating conditions, interface C-S\nconversion effect via Dirac surface state is evaluated as nearly constant large\nvalues of qICS, reflecting that the qICS is inversely proportional to the Fermi\nvelocity vF that is almost constant. However, when EF traverses through the\nDirac point, the qICS is remarkably suppressed possibly due to the degeneracy\nof surface spins or instability of helical spin structure. These results\ndemonstrate that the fine tuning of the EF in TI based heterostructures is\ncritical to maximizing the efficiency using the spin-momentum locking\nmechanism.\n", "  In all our well-established theories, it is assumed that events are embedded\nin a global causal structure such that, for every pair of events, the causal\norder between them is always fixed. However, the possible interplay between\nquantum mechanics and general relativity may require a revision of this\nparadigm. The process matrix framework keeps the validity of quantum physics\nlocally but does not assume the existence of a global causal order. It allows\nto describe causal structures corresponding to a quantum superposition of 'A is\nbefore B' and 'B is before A'. So far, the framework has been developed only\nfor finite-dimensional systems, and a straightforward generalization to\ninfinite dimensions leads to singularities. Such generalization is necessary\nfor continuous-variable systems and is a prerequisite for quantum fields on\nindefinite causal structures. Here we develop the process-matrix framework for\ncontinuous-variable systems. We encounter and solve the problems of\nsingularities. Moreover, we study an example of a process in infinite\ndimensions, and we derive correlations exhibiting intereference due to\nprocesses in which A is before B and B is before A.\n", "  Starting from a microscopic model for a spherically symmetric active Janus\nparticle, we study the interactions between two such active motors. The ambient\nfluid mediates a long range hydrodynamic interaction between two motors. This\ninteraction has both direct and indirect hydrodynamic contributions. The direct\ncontribution is due to the propagation of fluid flow that originated from a\nmoving motor and affects the motion of the other motor. The indirect\ncontribution emerges from the re-distribution of the ionic concentrations in\nthe presence of both motors. Electric force exerted on the fluid from this\nionic solution enhances the flow pattern and subsequently changes the motion of\nboth motors. By formulating a perturbation method for very far separated\nmotors, we derive analytic results for the transnational and rotational\ndynamics of the motors. We show that the overall interaction at the leading\norder, modifies the translational and rotational speeds of motors which scale\nas ${\\cal O}\\left([1/D]^3\\right)$ and ${\\cal O}\\left([1/D]^4\\right)$ with their\nseparation, respectively. Our findings open up the way for studying the\ncollective dynamics of synthetic micro motors.\n", "  This essay considers a model quantum universe consisting of a very large box\ncontaining a screen with two slits and an observer (us) that can pass though\nthe slits. We apply the modern quantum mechanics of closed systems to calculate\nthe probabilities for alternative histories of how we move through the universe\nand what we see. After passing through the screen with the slits, the quantum\nstate of the universe is a superposition of classically distinguishable\nhistories. We are then living in a superposition. Some frequently asked\nquestions about such situations are answered using this model. The model's\nrelationship to more realistic quantum cosmologies is briefly discussed.\n", "  In theories, whose Lorentz invariance is violated by involvement of an\nexternal any-rank tensor, we show that the standard relativistic rule still\nholds true for summing the signal speed, understood as the group velocity of a\nwave, with the speed of the reference frame. Provided a superluminal signal is\navailable, this observation enables one to arrange a closed time cycle and\nhence causality violation, notwithstanding the Lorentz noninvariance. Also an\noptical anisotropy of a moving medium, isotropic at rest, is revealed.\n", "  We discuss the Tensor Renormalization Group (TRG) method for the O(2) model\nwith a chemical potential in 1+1 dimensions with emphasis on near\ngapless/conformal situations. We emphasize the role played by the late Leo\nKadanoff in the development of this theoretical framework. We describe the\nentanglement entropy in the superfluid phase (see arXiv:1507.01471 for\ndetails). We present recent progress on optimized truncation methods.\n", "  Finding equilibration times is a major unsolved problem in physics with few\nanalytical results. Here we look at equilibration times for quantum gases of\nbosons and fermions in the regime of negligibly weak interactions, a setting\nwhich not only includes paradigmatic systems such as gases confined to boxes,\nbut also Luttinger liquids and the free superfluid Hubbard model. To do this,\nwe focus on two classes of measurements: (i) coarse-grained observables, such\nas the number of particles in a region of space, and (ii) few-mode\nmeasurements, such as phase correlators and correlation functions. We show\nthat, in this setting, equilibration occurs quite generally despite the fact\nthat the particles are not interacting. Furthermore, for coarse-grained\nmeasurements the timescale is generally at most polynomial in the number of\nparticles N, which is much faster than previous general upper bounds, which\nwere exponential in N. For local measurements on lattice systems, the timescale\nis typically linear in the number of lattice sites. In fact, for one\ndimensional lattices, the scaling is generally linear in the length of the\nlattice, which is optimal. Additionally, we look at a few specific examples,\none of which consists of N fermions initially confined on one side of a\npartition in a box. The partition is removed and the fermions equilibrate\nextremely quickly in time O(1/N).\n", "  We investigate the nature of quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase of the\nspin-$1/2$ nearest-neighbor XXZ antiferromagnet on the kagome lattice. Recent\nnumerical calculations suggest that such a kagome spin liquid is insensitive to\nthe XXZ anisotropy and is adjacent to a chiral spin liquid phase. Reformulating\nthe problem in terms of a $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory with dynamical bosonic\nspinons, we propose that the kagome spin liquid can be understood as a\ndeconfined critical phase extended by the $U(1)$ gauge fluctuation from a\ndeconfined critical point between a symmetry-protected topological phase and a\nsuperfluid phase. Crucially, the stability of this QSL is ensured by the gauge\nfluctuation and hence our description necessarily falls beyond the conventional\nmean-field constructions of QSLs. Our work also makes an interesting connection\nbetween the critical spin liquid, deconfined criticality, symmetry protected\ntopological phase and topological order.\n", "  The experimental value of ${\\rm H_{3}S}$ isotope coefficient decreases from\n$2.37$ to $0.31$ in the pressure range from $130$ GPa to $200$ GPa. We have\nshown that the value of $0.31$ is correctly reproduced in the framework of the\nclassical Eliashberg approach. On the other hand, the anomalously large value\nof the isotope coefficient ($2.37$) may be associated with the strong\nrenormalization of the normal state by the electron density of states.\n", "  We investigate the dependence of the energy gap ($G$) on the temperature\n($T$) for the electron-doped high-temperature superconductors. The following\ncompounds, in the form of the thin films, have been taken into consideration:\n$\\rm La_{2-x}Ce_xCuO_{4}$ (LCCO), $\\rm Pr_{2-x}Ce_xCuO_{4}$ (PCCO), and $\\rm\nNd_{2-x}Ce_xCuO_4$ (NCCO). It was found that $G\\left(T\\right)$ deviates from\nthe BCS prediction more, if a concentration of cerium assumes the lower values.\nFor the lowest concentration (in the case of LCCO and NCCO), the function\n$G\\left(T\\right)$ is not quite like the BCS curve, which is connected with the\nexistence of the residual Nernst region. Next, it has been pointed out that the\nNCCO superconductor becomes structurally unstable for the maximum concentration\nof cerium, which is leading to the anomalous dependence of the energy gap on\nthe temperature and the induction of the wide Nernst region.\n", "  The experimental data from the RHIC and LHC experiments of invariant pT\nspectra in A+A and p + p collisions are analysed with Tsallis distributions in\ndifferent approaches. The information about the freeze-out surface in terms of\nfreeze-out volume, temperature, chemical potential and radial flow velocity for\ndifferent particle species are obtained. Further, these parameters are studied\nas a function of the mass of the secondary particles. A mass-dependent\ndifferential freeze-out is observed which does not seem to distinguish between\nparticles and their antiparticles. Further a mass-hierarchy in the radial flow\nis observed, meaning heavier particles suffer lower radial flow. Tsallis\ndistribution function at finite chemical potential is used to study the mass\ndependence of chemical potential. The peripheral heavy-ion and proton-proton\ncollisions at the same energies seem to be equivalent in terms of the extracted\nthermodynamic parameters.\n", "  We investigate the impact of astrophysical systematics on cosmic shear\ncosmological parameter constraints from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope\nLensing Survey (CFHTLenS), and the concordance with cosmic microwave background\nmeasurements by Planck. We present updated CFHTLenS cosmic shear tomography\nmeasurements extended to degree scales using a covariance calibrated by a new\nsuite of N-body simulations. We analyze these measurements with a new model\nfitting pipeline, accounting for key systematic uncertainties arising from\nintrinsic galaxy alignments, baryonic effects in the nonlinear matter power\nspectrum, and photometric redshift uncertainties. We examine the impact of the\nsystematic degrees of freedom on the cosmological parameter constraints, both\nindependently and jointly. When the systematic uncertainties are considered\nindependently, the intrinsic alignment amplitude is the only degree of freedom\nthat is substantially preferred by the data. When the systematic uncertainties\nare considered jointly, there is no consistently strong preference in favor of\nthe more complex models. We quantify the level of concordance between the\nCFHTLenS and Planck datasets by employing two distinct data concordance tests,\ngrounded in Bayesian evidence and information theory. We find that the two data\nconcordance tests largely agree with one another, and that the level of\nconcordance between the CFHTLenS and Planck datasets is sensitive to the exact\ndetails of the systematic uncertainties included in our analysis, ranging from\ndecisive discordance to substantial concordance as the treatment of the\nsystematic uncertainties becomes more conservative. The least conservative\nscenario is the one most favored by the cosmic shear data, but it is also the\none that shows the greatest degree of discordance with Planck. The data and\nanalysis code are public at https://github.com/sjoudaki/cfhtlens_revisited\n", "  In this work we revisit the construction of theories for a massive vector\nfield with derivative self-interactions such that only the 3 desired\npolarizations corresponding to a Proca field propagate. We start from the\ndecoupling limit by constructing healthy interactions containing second\nderivatives of the Stueckelberg field with itself and also with the transverse\nmodes. The resulting interactions can then be straightforwardly generalized\nbeyond the decoupling limit. We then proceed to a systematic construction of\nthe interactions by using the Levi-Civita tensors. Both approaches lead to a\nfinite family of allowed derivative self-interactions for the Proca field. This\nconstruction allows us to show that some higher order terms recently introduced\nas new interactions trivialize in 4 dimensions by virtue of the Cayley-Hamilton\ntheorem. Moreover, we discuss how the resulting derivative interactions can be\nwritten in a compact determinantal form, which can also be regarded as a\ngeneralization of the Born-Infeld lagrangian for electromagnetism. Finally, we\ngeneralize our results for a curved background and give the necessary\nnon-minimal couplings guaranteeing that no additional polarizations propagate\neven in the presence of gravity.\n", "  Quantum coherence is a critical resource for many operational tasks.\nUnderstanding how to quantify and manipulate it also promises to have\napplications for a diverse set of problems in theoretical physics. For certain\napplications, however, one requires coherence between the eigenspaces of\nspecific physical observables, such as energy, angular momentum, or photon\nnumber, and it makes a difference which eigenspaces appear in the\nsuperposition. For others, there is a preferred set of subspaces relative to\nwhich coherence is deemed a resource, but it is irrelevant which of the\nsubspaces appear in the superposition. We term these two types of coherence\nunspeakable and speakable respectively. We argue that a useful approach to\nquantifying and characterizing unspeakable coherence is provided by the\nresource theory of asymmetry when the symmetry group is a group of\ntranslations, and we translate a number of prior results on asymmetry into the\nlanguage of coherence. We also highlight some of the applications of this\napproach, for instance, in the context of quantum metrology, quantum speed\nlimits, quantum thermodynamics, and NMR. The question of how best to treat\nspeakable coherence as a resource is also considered. We review a popular\napproach in terms of operations that preserve the set of incoherent states,\npropose an alternative approach in terms of operations that are covariant under\ndephasing, and we outline the challenge of providing a physical justification\nfor either approach. Finally, we note some mathematical connections that hold\namong the different approaches to quantifying coherence.\n", "  Laser-driven ion accelerators have the advantages of compact size, high\ndensity, and short bunch duration over conventional accelerators. Nevertheless,\nit is still challenging to simultaneously enhance the yield and quality of\nlaser-driven ion beams for practical applications. Here we propose a scheme to\naddress this challenge via the use of emerging multi-petawatt lasers and a\ndensity-modulated target. The density-modulated target permits its ions to be\nuniformly accelerated as a dense block by laser radiation pressure. In\naddition, the beam quality of the accelerated ions is remarkably improved by\nembedding the target in a thick enough substrate, which suppresses hot electron\nrefluxing and thus alleviates plasma heating. Particle-in-cell simulations\ndemonstrate that almost all ions in a solid-density plasma of a few microns can\nbe uniformly accelerated to about 25% of the speed of light by a laser pulse at\nan intensity around 1022 W/cm2. The resulting dense block of energetic ions may\ndrive fusion ignition and more generally create matter with unprecedented high\nenergy density.\n", "  We study the necking dynamics of a filament of complex fluid or soft solid in\nuniaxial tensile stretching at constant imposed Hencky strain rate\n$\\dot\\varepsilon$, by means of linear stability analysis and nonlinear (slender\nfilament) simulations. We demonstrate necking to be an intrinsic flow\ninstability that arises as an inevitable consequence of the constitutive\nbehaviour of essentially any material (with a possible rare exception, which we\noutline). We derive criteria for the onset of necking that are reportable\nsimply in terms of characteristic signatures in the shapes of the\nexperimentally measured rheological response functions, and should therefore\napply universally to all materials. As evidence of their generality, we\nnumerically show them to hold in six popular constitutive models of polymers\nand soft glasses. Two distinct modes of necking instability are predicted. The\nfirst is relatively gentle, and sets in when the tensile stress signal first\ncurves down as a function of the time $t$ (or accumulated strain\n$\\epsilon=\\dot\\varepsilon t$) since the inception of the flow. The second is\nmore violent, and sets in when a carefully defined `elastic derivative' of the\ntensile force first slopes down as a function of $t$ (or $\\dot\\varepsilon$). In\nthe limit of fast flow $\\dot\\varepsilon\\tau\\to\\infty$, where $\\tau$ is the\nmaterial's characteristic stress relaxation time, this second mode reduces to\nthe Consid\\'ere criterion for necking in solids. However we show that the\nConsid\\'ere criterion fails to correctly predict the onset of necking in any\nviscoelastic regime of finite imposed $\\dot\\varepsilon\\tau$. Finally, we\nelucidate the way these modes of instability manifest themselves in entangled\nlinear polymers, wormlike micelles and branched polymers. We demonstrate four\ndistinct regimes as a function of imposed strain rate, consistent with\nexperimental master curves.\n", "  Serious searches for the weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) have now\nbegun. In this context, the most important questions that need to be addressed\nare: \"To what extent can we constrain the WIMP models in the future?\" and \"What\nwill then be the remaining unexplored regions in the WIMP parameter space for\neach of these models?\" In our quest to answer these questions, we classify WIMP\nin terms of quantum number and study each case adopting minimality as a guiding\nprinciple. As a first step, we study one of the simple cases of the minimal\ncomposition in the well-tempered fermionic WIMP regime, namely the\nsinglet-doublets WIMP model. We consider all available constraints from direct\nand indirect searches and also the predicted constraints coming from the near\nfuture and the future experiments. We thus obtain the current status, the near\nfuture prospects and the future prospects of this model in all its generality.\nWe find that in the future, this model will be constrained almost solely by the\nfuture direct dark matter detection experiments (as compared to the weaker\nindirect and collider constraints) and the cosmological (relic density)\nconstraints and will hence be gradually pushed to the corner of the\ncoannihilation region, if no WIMP signal is detected. Future lepton colliders\nwill then be useful in exploring this region not constrained by any other\nexperiments.\n", "  Understanding the temperature dependence of the optical properties of thin\nmetal films is critical for designing practical devices for high temperature\napplications in a variety of research areas, including plasmonics and\nnear-field radiative heat transfer. Even though the optical properties of bulk\nmetals at elevated temperatures have been studied, the temperature-dependent\ndata for thin metal films, with thicknesses ranging from few tens to few\nhundreds of nanometers, is largely missing. In this work we report on the\noptical constants of single- and polycrystalline gold thin films at elevated\ntemperatures in the wavelength range from 370 to 2000 nm. Our results show that\nwhile the real part of the dielectric function changes marginally with\nincreasing temperature, the imaginary part changes drastically. For\n200-nm-thick single- and polycrystalline gold films the imaginary part of the\ndielectric function at 500 0C becomes nearly twice larger than that at room\ntemperature. In contrast, in thinner films (50-nm and 30-nm) the imaginary part\ncan show either increasing or decreasing behavior within the same temperature\nrange and eventually at 500 0C it becomes nearly 3-4 times larger than that at\nroom temperature. The increase in the imaginary part at elevated temperatures\nsignificantly reduces the surface plasmon polariton propagation length and the\nquality factor of the localized surface plasmon resonance for a spherical\nparticle. We provide experiment-fitted models to describe the\ntemperature-dependent gold dielectric function as a sum of one Drude and two\nCritical Point oscillators. These causal analytical models could enable\naccurate multiphysics modelling of gold-based nanophotonic and plasmonic\nelements in both frequency and time domains.\n", "  Motivated by understanding the power of quantum computation with restricted\nnumber of qubits, we give two complete characterizations of unitary quantum\nspace bounded computation. First we show that approximating an element of the\ninverse of a well-conditioned efficiently encoded $2^{k(n)}\\times 2^{k(n)}$\nmatrix is complete for the class of problems solvable by quantum circuits\nacting on $\\mathcal{O}(k(n))$ qubits with all measurements at the end of the\ncomputation. Similarly, estimating the minimum eigenvalue of an efficiently\nencoded Hermitian $2^{k(n)}\\times 2^{k(n)}$ matrix is also complete for this\nclass. In the logspace case, our results improve on previous results of Ta-Shma\n[STOC '13] by giving new space-efficient quantum algorithms that avoid\nintermediate measurements, as well as showing matching hardness results.\n  Additionally, as a consequence we show that PreciseQMA, the version of QMA\nwith exponentially small completeness-soundess gap, is equal to PSPACE. Thus,\nthe problem of estimating the minimum eigenvalue of a local Hamiltonian to\ninverse exponential precision is PSPACE-complete, which we show holds even in\nthe frustration-free case. Finally, we can use this characterization to give a\nprovable setting in which the ability to prepare the ground state of a local\nHamiltonian is more powerful than the ability to prepare PEPS states.\n  Interestingly, by suitably changing the parameterization of either of these\nproblems we can completely characterize the power of quantum computation with\nsimultaneously bounded time and space.\n", "  We generated a computational approach to analyze the biomechanics of\nepithelial cell aggregates, either island or stripes or entire monolayers, that\ncombines both vertex and contact-inhibition-of-locomotion models to include\nboth cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion. Examination of the distribution of\ncell protrusions (adhesion to the substrate) in the model predicted high order\nprofiles of cell organization that agree with those previously seen\nexperimentally. Cells acquired an asymmetric distribution of basal protrusions,\ntraction forces and apical aspect ratios that decreased when moving from the\nedge to the island center. Our in silico analysis also showed that tension on\ncell-cell junctions and apical stress is not homogeneous across the island.\nInstead, these parameters are higher at the island center and scales up with\nisland size, which we confirmed experimentally using laser ablation assays and\nimmunofluorescence. Without formally being a 3-dimensional model, our approach\nhas the minimal elements necessary to reproduce the distribution of cellular\nforces and mechanical crosstalk as well as distribution of principal stress in\ncells within epithelial cell aggregates. By making experimental testable\npredictions, our approach would benefit the mechanical analysis of epithelial\ntissues, especially when local changes in cell-cell and/or cell-substrate\nadhesion drive collective cell behavior.\n", "  Formation, evolution, and dispersal processes of protoplanetary disks are\ninvestigated and the disk lifetime is estimated. Gravitational collapse of a\npre-stellar core forms both a central star and a protoplanetary disk. The\ncentral star grows by accretion from the disk, and irradiation by the central\nstar heats up the disk and generates thermal wind, which results in the disk\ndispersal. We calculate the evolution of protoplanetary disks from their parent\npre-stellar cores to dispersal of the disks. We find that the disk lifetimes of\ntypical pre-stellar cores are around 2--4 million years (Myr). A pre-stellar\ncore with high angular momentum forms a larger disk whose lifetime is long,\nwhile a disk around a X-ray luminous star has a short lifetime. Integrating the\ndisk lifetimes under various mass and angular velocity of prestellar cores and\nX-ray luminosities of young stellar objects, we obtain disk fraction at a given\nstellar age and mean lifetime of the disks. Our model indicates that the mean\nlifetime of protoplanetary disks is 3.7 Myr, which is consistent with the\nobservational estimate from young stellar clusters. We also find that the\ndispersion of X-ray luminosity is needed to reproduce the observed disk\nfraction.\n", "  In the recent progress in nonequilibrium thermodynamics, information has been\nrecognized as a kind of thermodynamic resource that can drive thermodynamic\ncurrent without any direct energy injection. In this paper, we establish the\nframework of linear irreversible thermodynamics for a broad class of autonomous\ninformation processing. In particular, we prove that the Onsager reciprocity\nholds true with information: The linear response matrix is well-defined, and is\nshown symmetric with both of the information affinity and the conventional\nthermodynamic affinity. As an application, we derive a universal bound for the\nefficiency at maximum power for information-driven engines in the linear\nregime. Our result reveals the fundamental role of information flow in linear\nirreversible thermodynamics, and would be applicable to study the role of\ninformation in biological systems.\n", "  We consider the minimal 3-3-1 model with three sterile neutrinos transforming\nas singlet under the $SU(3)_L\\otimes U(1)_X$ symmetry. This model, with or\nwithout sterile neutrinos, predicts flavor violating interactions in both quark\nand lepton sectors, since all the charged fermions mass matrices can not be\nassumed diagonal in any case. Here we accommodate the lepton masses and the\nPontecorvo-Maki-Nakawaga-Sakata matrix at the same time, and as consequence the\nYukawa couplings and the unitary matrices which diagonalize the mass matrices\nare not free parameters anymore. We study some phenomenological consequences,\ni.e., $l_i\\to l_jl_k \\bar{l}_k$ and $l_i\\to l_j\\gamma$ which are induced by\nneutral and doubly charged particles present in the model. In particular we\nfind that if the decay $\\mu\\to ee\\bar{e}$ is observed in the future, the only\nparticle in the model that could explain this decay is the doubly charged\nvector bilepton.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the generalised monogamy inequalities of\nconvex-roof extended negativity (CREN) in multi-level systems. The generalised\nmonogamy inequalities provide the upper and lower bounds of bipartite\nentanglement, which are obtained by using CREN and the CREN of assistance\n(CRENOA). Furthermore, we show that the CREN of multi-qubit pure states\nsatisfies some monogamy relations. Additionally, we test the generalised\nmonogamy inequalities for qudits by considering the partially coherent\nsuperposition of a generalised W-class state in a vacuum and show that the\ngeneralised monogamy inequalities are satisfied in this case as well.\n", "  It is known that Schr\\\"odinger equation fails in describing the dynamics of\nhighly energetic particles. We propose to quantify this lack of Lorentz\ncovariance by evaluating the probability for a particle to be measured outside\nthe set of light cones which are compatible to its initial wave function. We\nconsider a simple case of a particle released from a box, which, in turn, is\ninside a larger container. It is shown that besides the increasing error at\nrelativistic energies, there may be a complete breakdown, with Schr\\\"odinger\ndynamics implying in deterministic, superluminal signaling for Lorentz factors\nabove 129. In addition, we give an exact asymptotic expression for the\nviolation in local causality by employing the stationary exponent method, from\nwhich the Compton wave length of the particle naturally arises as the relevant\nscale for the stationary points.\n", "  We revisit the compatibility between the chaotic inflation, which provides a\nnatural solution to the initial condition problem, and the metastable\nelectroweak vacuum, which is suggested by the results of LHC and the current\nmass measurements of top quark and Higgs boson. It is known that the chaotic\ninflation poses a threat to the stability of the electroweak vacuum because it\neasily generates large Higgs fluctuations during inflation or preheating and\ntriggers the catastrophic vacuum decay. In this paper, we propose a simple\ncosmological solution in which the vacuum is stabilized during chaotic\ninflation, preheating and after that. This simple solution naturally predicts\nthe formation of primordial black holes. We find interesting parameter regions\nwhere the present dark matter density is provided by them. Also, the thermal\nleptogenesis can be accommodated in our scenario.\n", "  In the process of protostar formation, astrophysical gas clouds undergo\nthermodynamically irreversible processes and emit heat and radiation to their\nsurroundings. Due the emission of this energy one can envision an idealized\nsituation in which the gas entropy remains nearly constant. In this setting, we\nderive in this paper interior solutions to the Einstein equations of General\nRelativity for spheres which consist of isentropic gas. To accomplish this\nobjective we derive a single equation for the cumulative mass distribution in\nthe protostar. From a solution of this equation one can infer readily the\ncoefficients of the metric tensor. In this paper we present analytic and\nnumerical solutions for the structure of the isentropic self-gravitating gas.\nIn particular we look for solutions in which the mass distribution indicates\nthe presence of shells, a possible precursor to solar system formation. Another\npossible physical motivation for this research comes from the observation that\ngamma ray bursts are accompanied by the ejection of large amounts of\nthermodynamically active gas at relativistic velocities. Under these conditions\nit is natural to use the equations of general relativity to inquire about the\nstructure of the ejected mass.\n", "  We determine the band structure and spin texture of WTe2 by spin- and\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (SARPES). With the support of\nfirst-principles calculations, we reveal the existence of spin polarization of\nboth the Fermi arc surface states and bulk Fermi pockets. Our results support\nWTe2 to be a type-II Weyl semimetal candidate and provide important information\nto understand its extremely large and nonsaturating magnetoresistance.\n", "  The open stadium billiard has a survival probability, $P(t)$, that depends on\nthe rate of escape of particles through the leak. It is known that the decay of\n$P(t)$ is exponential early in time while for long times the decay follows a\npower law. In this work we investigate an open stadium billiard in which the\nleak is free to rotate around the boundary of the stadium at a constant\nvelocity, $\\omega$. It is found that $P(t)$ is very sensitive to $\\omega$. For\ncertain $\\omega$ values $P(t)$ is purely exponential while for other values the\npower law behaviour at long times persists. We identify three ranges of\n$\\omega$ values corresponding to three different responses of $P(t)$. It is\nshown that these variations in $P(t)$ are due to the interaction of the moving\nleak with Marginally Unstable Periodic Orbits (MUPOs).\n", "  We claim that the anti-relativistic statement in de Sangro et al., Eur. Phys.\nJ. C 75, 137 (2015) that the Coulomb field of a moving charge propagates\nrigidly with it, cannot as a matter of fact be inferred from the measurements\nreported in that reference. Registered is not the passing of the Coulomb disk,\nbut the acceleration-dependent part of the Lienard-Wiechert field.\n", "  Joint measurements of two observables reveal that every state is\nnonclassical, with the only trivial exception of the state with density matrix\nproportional to the identity. This naturally includes states considered\nuniversally as classical-like, such as SU(2) and Glauber coherent states. We\nshow that this holds because we can always find a joint measurement whose\nstatistics is not separable.\n", "  The generalized version of a lower dimensional model where vector and axial\nvector interaction get mixed up with different weight is considered. The\nbosonized version of which does not posses the local gauge symmetry. An attempt\nhas been made here to construct BRST invariant reformulation of this model\nusing Batalin Fradlin and Vilkovisky formalism. It is found that the extra\nfield needed to make it gauge invariant turns into Wess-Zumino scalar with\nappropriate choice of gauge fixing. An application of finite field dependent\nBRST and anti-BRST transformation is also made here in order to show the\ntransmutation between the BRST symmetric and the usual non-symmetric version of\nthe model.\n", "  Correlations between light neutrino observables are arguably the strongest\npredictions of lepton avour models based on (discrete) symmetries, except for\nthe very few cases which unambiguously predict the full set of leptonic mixing\nangles. A subclass of these correlations are neutrino mass sum rules, which\nconnect the three (complex) light neutrino mass eigenvalues among each other.\nThis connection constrains both the light neutrino mass scale and the Majorana\nphases, so that mass sum rules generically lead to a nonzero value of the\nlightest neutrino mass and to distinct predictions for the e ective mass probed\nin neutrinoless double beta decay. However, in nearly all cases known, the\nneutrino mass sum rules are not exact and receive corrections from various\nsources. We introduce a formalism to handle these corrections perturbatively in\na model-independent manner, which overcomes issues present in earlier\napproaches. Our ansatz allows us to quantify the modi cation of the predictions\nderived from neutrino mass sum rules. We show that, in most cases, the\npredictions are fairly stable: while small quantitative changes can appear,\nthey are generally rather mild. We therefore establish the predictivity of\nneutrino mass sum rules on a level far more general than previously known.\n", "  To date, the intrinsic thermal conductivity tensor of bulk black phosphorus\n(BP), an important 2D material, is still unknown, since recent studies focus on\nBP flakes not on bulk BP. Here we report the anisotropic thermal conductivity\ntensor of bulk BP, for temperature range 80 - 300 K. Our measurements are\nsimilar to prior measurements on submicron BP flakes along zigzag and armchair\naxes, but are >25% higher in the through-plane axis, suggesting that phonon\nmean-free-paths are substantially longer in the through-plane direction. We\nfind that despite the anisotropy in thermal conductivity, phonons are\npredominantly scattered by the same Umklapp processes in all directions. We\nalso find that the phonon relaxation time is rather isotropic in the basal\nplanes, but is highly anisotropic in the through-plane direction. Our work\nadvances fundamental knowledge of anisotropic scattering of phonons in BP and\nis an important benchmark for future studies on thermal properties of BP\nnanostructures.\n", "  We study non-Fermi liquid states that arise at the quantum critical points\nassociated with the spin density wave (SDW) and charge density wave (CDW)\ntransitions in metals with twofold rotational symmetry. We use the dimensional\nregularization scheme, where a one-dimensional Fermi surface is embedded in\n$3-\\epsilon$ dimensional momentum space. In three dimensions, quasilocal\nmarginal Fermi liquids arise both at the SDW and CDW critical points : the\nspeed of the collective mode along the ordering wavevector is logarithmically\nrenormalized to zero compared to that of Fermi velocity. Below three\ndimensions, however, the SDW and CDW critical points exhibit drastically\ndifferent behaviors. At the SDW critical point, a stable anisotropic non-Fermi\nliquid state is realized for small $\\epsilon$, where not only time but also\ndifferent spatial coordinates develop distinct anomalous dimensions. The\nnon-Fermi liquid exhibits an emergent algebraic nesting as the patches of Fermi\nsurface are deformed into a universal power-law shape near the hot spots. Due\nto the anisotropic scaling, the energy of incoherent spin fluctuations disperse\nwith different power laws in different momentum directions. At the CDW critical\npoint, on the other hand, the perturbative expansion breaks down immediately\nbelow three dimensions as the interaction renormalizes the speed of charge\nfluctuations to zero within a finite renormalization group scale through a\ntwo-loop effect. The difference originates from the fact that the vertex\ncorrection anti-screens the coupling at the SDW critical point whereas it\nscreens at the CDW critical point.\n", "  We propose a systematic procedure to optimize quantum state tomography\nprotocols for continuous variable systems based on excitation counting preceded\nby a displacement operation. Compared with conventional tomography based on\nHusimi or Wigner function measurement, the excitation counting approach can\nsignificantly reduce the number of measurement settings. We investigate both\ninformational completeness and robustness, and provide a bound of\nreconstruction error involving the condition number of the sensing map. We also\nidentify the measurement settings that optimize this error bound, and\ndemonstrate that the improved reconstruction robustness can lead to an order of\nmagnitude reduction of estimation error with given resources. This optimization\nprocedure is general and can incorporate prior information of the unknown state\nto further simplify the protocol.\n", "  We study the necking of a filament of complex fluid or soft solid subject to\nuniaxial tensile stretching, under conditions of constant imposed stress and\nforce, by means of linear stability analysis and nonlinear simulations. We\ndemonstrate necking to be a flow instability that is an unavoidable consequence\nof the constitutive behaviour of essentially any viscoelastic material. We\nderive criteria for the onset of necking that can be reported in terms of\ncharacteristic signatures in the shapes of the experimentally measured material\nfunctions, and that should therefore apply universally to all materials. To\nconfirm their generality, we show them to hold numerically in six constitutive\nmodels. Under conditions of constant stress, we find two distinct dynamical\nregimes as a function of time. In the first regime the strain rate quickly\nattains a value prescribed by the fluid's underlying homogeneous constitutive\ncurve, at the given stress. In this first regime, no appreciable necking\narises. A second regime then ensues in which the homogeneous flow destabilises\nto form a neck. This necking instability can occur via two distinct modes. The\nfirst mode is relatively gentle and arises in any regime where the slope of the\nconstitutive curve is positive. It has a rate of necking per accumulated strain\nunit set by the inverse of the slope of the constitutive curve. The second mode\nsets in when a carefully defined `elastic derivative' of the tensile force\nfirst slopes down as a function of the time. We discuss the way in which these\nmodes of instability manifest themselves in entangled polymeric fluids,\ndemonstrating four distinct regimes of necking behaviour as a function of\nstress. Under conditions of constant imposed force, typically the flow sweeps\nup the underlying constitutive curve of the fluid in question, with instability\nto necking in any regime where that curve is positively sloping.\n", "  Synchrotron radiation of relativistic electrons in storage rings naturally\nleads to the process of damping of betatron oscillations. Damping time and\ntransverse beam emittance can be reduced by wigglers or undulators while the\nbeam parameters are still well defined by the common radiation integrals, based\non the properties of synchrotron radiation. However, the quantum excitation of\nbetatron oscillations in principle can be considerably reduced if an electron\nradiation occurs due to the Thomson scattering in the periodic electromagnetic\nfield. After a brief introduction we compare radiation properties for different\ncases and suggest the modification of the radiation integrals.\n", "  New class of reference distribution functions for numerical approximation of\nthe solution of the Fokker-Planck equations associated to the charged particle\ndynamics in tokamak are studied. The reference distribution functions are\nobtained by maximization of the generalized Renyi entropy under scale-invariant\nrestrictions. Explicit analytic form, with algebraic decay, that is a\ngeneralization of the previous distribution with exponential tails was derived.\n", "  We consider models of chaotic inflation driven by the real parts of a\nconjugate pair of Higgs superfields involved in the spontaneous breaking of a\ngrand unification symmetry at a scale assuming its Supersymmetric value.\nEmploying Kaehler potentials with a prominent shift-symmetric part proportional\nto c- and a tiny violation, proportional to c+, included in a logarithm we show\nthat the inflationary observables provide an excellent match to the recent\nPlanck and Bicep2/Keck Array results setting, e.g., 0.0064<= c+/c-<1/N where\nN=2 or 3 is the prefactor of the logarithm. Deviations of these prefactors from\ntheir integer values above are also explored and a region where hilltop\ninflation occurs is localized. Moreover, we analyze two distinct possible\nstabilization mechanisms for the non-inflaton accompanying superfield, one tied\nto higher order terms and one with just quadratic terms within the argument of\na logarithm with positive prefactor Ns<6. In all cases, inflation can be\nattained for subplanckian inflaton values with the corresponding effective\ntheories retaining the perturbative unitarity up to the Planck scale.\n", "  We report on the design and characterization of a low-temperature external\ncavity diode laser (ECDL) system for broad wavelength tuning. The performance\nachieved with multiple diode models addresses the scarcity of commercial red\nlaser diodes below 633 nm, which is a wavelength range relevant to spectroscopy\nof many molecules and ions. Using a combination of multiple-stage\nthermoelectric cooling and water cooling, the operating temperature of a laser\ndiode is lowered to -64{\\deg}C, more than 85{\\deg}C below the ambient\ntemperature. The laser system integrates temperature and diffraction grating\nfeedback tunability for coarse and fine wavelength adjustments, respectively.\nFor two different diode models, single-mode operation was achieved with 38 mW\noutput power at 616.8 nm and 69 mW at 622.6 nm, more than 15 nm below their\nambient temperature free-running wavelengths. The ECDL design can be used for\ndiodes of any available wavelength, allowing individual diodes to be tuned\ncontinuously over tens of nanometers and extending the wavelength coverage of\ncommercial laser diodes.\n", "  In recent years there have been significant improvements in the sensitivity\nand the angular resolution of the instruments dedicated to the observation of\nthe Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). ACTPol is the first polarization\nreceiver for the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and is observing the CMB sky\nwith arcmin resolution over about 2000 sq. deg. Its upgrade, Advanced ACTPol\n(AdvACT), will observe the CMB in five frequency bands and over a larger area\nof the sky. We describe the optimization and implementation of the ACTPol and\nAdvACT surveys. The selection of the observed fields is driven mainly by the\nscience goals, that is, small angular scale CMB measurements, B-mode\nmeasurements and cross-correlation studies. For the ACTPol survey we have\nobserved patches of the southern galactic sky with low galactic foreground\nemissions which were also chosen to maximize the overlap with several galaxy\nsurveys to allow unique cross-correlation studies. A wider field in the\nnorthern galactic cap ensured significant additional overlap with the BOSS\nspectroscopic survey. The exact shapes and footprints of the fields were\noptimized to achieve uniform coverage and to obtain cross-linked maps by\nobserving the fields with different scan directions. We have maximized the\nefficiency of the survey by implementing a close to 24 hour observing strategy,\nswitching between daytime and nighttime observing plans and minimizing the\ntelescope idle time. We describe the challenges represented by the survey\noptimization for the significantly wider area observed by AdvACT, which will\nobserve roughly half of the low-foreground sky. The survey strategies described\nhere may prove useful for planning future ground-based CMB surveys, such as the\nSimons Observatory and CMB Stage IV surveys.\n", "  We present a non-equilibrium Green's functional approach to study the\ndynamics following a quench in weakly interacting Bose Hubbard model (BHM). The\ntechnique is based on the self-consistent solution of a set of equations which\nrepresents a particular case of the most general set of Hedin's equations for\nthe interacting single-particle Green's function. We use the ladder\napproximation as a skeleton diagram for the two-particle scattering amplitude\nuseful, through the self-energy in the Dyson equation, for finding the\ninteracting single-particle Green's function. This scheme is then implemented\nnumerically by a parallelized code. We exploit this approach to study the\ncorrelation propagation after a quench in the interaction parameter, for one\n(1D) and two (2D) dimensions. In particular, we show how our approach is able\nto recover the crossover from ballistic to diffusive regime by increasing the\nboson-boson interaction. Finally we also discuss the role of a thermal initial\nstate on the dynamics both for 1D and 2D Bose Hubbard models, finding that\nsurprisingly at high temperature a ballistic evolution is restored.\n", "  We explore the properties of discrete-time stochastic processes with a\nbounded state space, whose deterministic limit is given by a map of the unit\ninterval. We find that, in the mesoscopic description of the system, the large\njumps between successive iterates of the process can result in probability\nleaking out of the unit interval, despite the fact that the noise is\nmultiplicative and vanishes at the boundaries. By including higher-order terms\nin the mesoscopic expansion, we are able to capture the non-Gaussian nature of\nthe noise distribution near the boundaries, but this does not preclude the\npossibility of a trajectory leaving the interval. We propose a number of\nprescriptions for treating these escape events, and we compare the results with\nthose obtained for the metastable behavior of the microscopic model, where\nescape events are not possible. We find that, rather than truncating the noise\ndistribution, censoring this distribution to prevent escape events leads to\nresults which are more consistent with the microscopic model. The addition of\nhigher moments to the noise distribution does not increase the accuracy of the\nfinal results, and it can be replaced by the simpler Gaussian noise.\n", "  The gravitational wave signal GW150914, recently detected by LIGO and Virgo\ncollaborations, is used to place a bound on the scale of quantum fuzziness of\nnon-commutative space-time. We show that the leading non-commutative correction\nto the phase of the gravitational waves produced by a binary system appears at\nthe 2nd order of the post- Newtonian expansion. This correction is proportional\nto $\\Lambda^2 \\equiv |\\theta^{0i}|^2/(l_P t_P)^2$, where $\\theta^{\\mu \\nu}$ is\nthe antisymmetric tensor of non-commutativity. To comply with GW150914 data, we\nfind that $\\sqrt{\\Lambda} \\lesssim 6$, namely less than one order of magnitude\nabove the Planck scale. This is the most stringent bound on non-commutative\nscale, exceeding the previous constraints from particle physics processes by\n$\\sim 15$ orders of magnitude.\n", "  Many-body localization (MBL) in a one-dimensional Fermi Hubbard model with\nrandom on-site interactions is studied. While for this model all\nsingle-particle states are trivially delocalized, it is shown that for\nsufficiently strong disordered interactions the model is many-body localized.\nIt is therefore argued that MBL does not necessary rely on localization of the\nsingle-particle spectrum. This model provides a convenient platform to study\npure MBL phenomenology, since Anderson localization in this model does not\nexist. By examining various forms of the interaction term a dramatic effect of\nsymmetries on charge transport is demonstrated. A possible realization in a\ncold atom experiments is proposed.\n", "  In fall of 2015, the two LIGO detectors measured the gravitational wave\nsignal GW150914, which originated from a pair of merging black holes. In the\nfinal 0.2 seconds (about 8 gravitational-wave cycles) before the amplitude\nreached its maximum, the observed signal swept up in amplitude and frequency,\nfrom 35 Hz to 150 Hz. The theoretical gravitational-wave signal for merging\nblack holes, as predicted by general relativity, can be computed only by full\nnumerical relativity, because analytic approximations fail near the time of\nmerger. Moreover, the nearly-equal masses, moderate spins, and small number of\norbits of GW150914 are especially straightforward and efficient to simulate\nwith modern numerical-relativity codes. In this paper, we report the modeling\nof GW150914 with numerical-relativity simulations, using black-hole masses and\nspins consistent with those inferred from LIGO's measurement. In particular, we\nemploy two independent numerical-relativity codes that use completely different\nanalytical and numerical methods to model the same merging black holes and to\ncompute the emitted gravitational waveform; we find excellent agreement between\nthe waveforms produced by the two independent codes. These results demonstrate\nthe validity, impact, and potential of current and future studies using\nrapid-response, targeted numerical-relativity simulations for better\nunderstanding gravitational-wave observations.\n", "  We report new results on the conformal properties of an important strongly\ncoupled gauge theory, a building block of composite Higgs models beyond the\nStandard Model. With twelve massless fermions in the fundamental representation\nof the SU(3) color gauge group, an infrared fixed point of the $\\beta$-function\nwas recently reported in the theory (Cheng:2014jba) with uncertainty in the\nlocation of the critical gauge coupling inside the narrow $[ 6.0<g_*^2<6.4]$\ninterval and widely accepted since as the strongest evidence for a conformal\nfixed point and scale invariance in the theory with model-building\nimplications. Using the exact same renormalization scheme as the previous\nstudy, we show that no fixed point of the $\\beta$-function exists in the\nreported interval. Our findings eliminate the only seemingly credible evidence\nfor conformal fixed point and scale invariance in the $N_f=12$ model whose\ninfrared properties remain unresolved. The implications of the recently\ncompleted 5-loop QCD beta function for arbitrary flavor number are discussed\nwith respect to our work.\n", "  The photovoltaic effect in a Weyl semimetal due to the adiabatic quantum\nphase is studied. We particularly focus on the case in which an external ac\nelectric field is applied to the semimetal. In this setup, we show that a\nphotocurrent is induced by the ac electric field. By considering a generalized\nWeyl Hamiltonian with nonlinear terms, it is shown that the photocurrent is\ninduced by circularly, rather than linearly, polarized light. This photovoltaic\ncurrent can be understood as an emergent electromagnetic induction in the\nmomentum space; the Weyl node is a magnetic monopole in the momentum space, of\nwhich the electric field is induced by the circular motion. This result is\ndistinct from conventional photovoltaic effects, and potentially useful for\nexperimentally identifying Weyl semimetals in chiral crystals.\n", "  We apply a recently developed theory for metastability in open quantum\nsystems to a one-dimensional dissipative quantum Ising model. Earlier results\nsuggest this model features either a non-equilibrium phase transition or a\nsmooth but sharp crossover, where the stationary state changes from\nparamagnetic to ferromagnetic, accompanied by strongly intermittent emission\ndynamics characteristic of first-order coexistence between dynamical phases. We\nshow that for a range of parameters close to this transition/crossover point\nthe dynamics of the finite system displays pronounced metastability, i.e., the\nsystem relaxes first to long-lived metastable states, before eventual\nrelaxation to the true stationary state. From the spectral properties of the\nquantum master operator we characterise the low-dimensional manifold of\nmetastable states, which are shown to be probability mixtures of two,\nparamagnetic and ferromagnetic, metastable phases. We also show that for long\ntimes the dynamics can be approximated by a classical stochastic dynamics\nbetween the metastable phases that is directly related to the intermittent\ndynamics observed in quantum trajectories and thus the dynamical phases.\n", "  We use differential Ramsey interferometry of ultracold atoms to characterize\nthe vector light shift (VLS) from a far-off resonance optical dipole trap at\n$\\lambda = 1064\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. The VLS manifests as a `fictitious' magnetic\nfield, which we perceive as a change in the Larmor frequency of two spinor\ncondensates exposed to different intensities of elliptically polarized light.\nWe use our measurement scheme to diagnose the light-induced magnetic field and\nsuppress it to $2.1(8)\\times10^{-4}$ of its maximum value, by making the\ntrapping light linearly polarized with a quarter-wave plate in each beam. Our\nsensitive measurement of the VLS-induced field demonstrates high-precision,\nin-vacuo interferometric polarimetry of dipole trapping light and can be\nadapted to measure vector shifts from other lasers, advancing the application\nof optically trapped atoms to precision metrology.\n", "  Lithographically fabricated MoS2 field effect transistors suffer from several\ncritical imperfections, including low sub-threshold swings, large turn-on gate\nvoltages (VT), and wide device-to-device variability. The large magnitude and\nvariability of VT stems from unclean interfaces, trapped charges in the\nunderlying substrate, and sulfur vacancies created during the mechanical\nexfoliation process. In this study, we demonstrate a simple and reliable oxygen\nplasma treatment, which mitigates the effects of unintentional doping created\nby surface defect cites, such as S vacancies, and surface contamination. This\nplasma treatment restores charge neutrality to the MoS2 and shifts the\nthreshold turn-on voltage towards 0V. Out of the 8 devices measured, all\nexhibit a shift of the FET turn-on voltage from an average of -18.7V to -0.9V.\nThe oxygen plasma treatment passivates these defects, which reduces surface\nscattering, causing increased mobility and improved subthreshold swing. For\nas-prepared devices with low mobilities (~0.01cm2/V.s), we observe up to a\n190-fold increase in mobility after exposure to the oxygen plasma. Perhaps the\nmost important aspect of this oxygen plasma treatment is that it reduces the\ndevice-to-device variability, which is a crucial factor in realizing any\npractical application of these devices.\n", "  We provide a gravitational argument in favour of the covariant holographic\nentanglement entropy proposal. In general time-dependent states, the proposal\nasserts that the entanglement entropy of a region in the boundary field theory\nis given by a quarter of the area of a bulk extremal surface in Planck units.\nThe main element of our discussion is an implementation of an appropriate\nSchwinger-Keldysh contour to obtain the reduced density matrix (and its powers)\nof a given region, as is relevant for the replica construction. We map this\ncontour into the bulk gravitational theory, and argue that the saddle point\nsolutions of these replica geometries lead to a consistent prescription for\ncomputing the field theory Renyi entropies. In the limiting case where the\nreplica index is taken to unity, a local analysis suffices to show that these\nsaddles lead to the extremal surfaces of interest. We also comment on various\nproperties of holographic entanglement that follow from this construction.\n", "  We discuss the parameter space reach of future experiments searching for\nheavy neutral leptons (HNLs) at the GeV scale in terms of neutrino mass models\nwith three HNL generations. We focus on two classes of models: Generic\nassumptions (such as random mass matrices or the Casas-Ibarra parameterization)\nand flavor symmetry-generated models. We demonstrate that the generic\napproaches lead to comparable parameter space predictions, which tend to be at\nleast partially within the reach of future experiments. On the other hand,\nspecific flavor symmetry models yield more refined predictions, some of these\ncan be more clearly excluded. We also highlight the importance to measure the\nflavor-dependent couplings of the HNLs as a model discriminator, and we clarify\nthe impact of assumptions frequently used in the literature to show the\nparameter space reach for the active-sterile mixings.\n", "  The LHCb experiment is one of four major experiments at the LHC. Despite\nbeing designed for the study of beauty and charm particles, it has made\nimportant contributions in other areas, such as the production and decay of $W$\nand $Z$ bosons. Such measurements can be used to study and constrain parton\ndistribution functions, as well as to test perturbative quantum chromodynamics\nin hard scattering processes. The angular structure of $Z$ boson decays to\nleptons can also be studied and used to measure the weak mixing angle. The\nphase space probed by LHCb is particularly sensitive to this quantity, and the\nLHCb measurement using the dimuon final state is currently the most precise\ndetermination of $\\sin^2\\theta^\\text{lept.}_\\text{eff.}$ at the LHC. LHCb\nmeasurements made using data collected during the first period of LHC\noperations (LHC Run 1) are discussed in this review. The article also considers\nthe potential impact of related future measurements.\n", "  Lead-halide perovskites are promising materials for opto-electronic\napplications. Recent reports indicated that their mechanical and electronic\nproperties are strongly affected by the lattice vibrations. Herein we report\nfar-infrared spectroscopy measurements of CH$_{3}$NH$_{3}$Pb(I/Br/Cl)$_{3}$\nthin films and single crystals at room temperature and a detailed quantitative\nanalysis of the spectra. We find strong broadening and anharmonicity of the\nlattice vibrations for all three halide perovskites, which indicates dynamic\ndisorder of the lead-halide cage at room temperature. We determine the\nfrequencies of the transversal and longitudinal optical phonons, and use them\nto calculate, via appropriate models, the static dielectric constants, polaron\nmasses, electron-phonon coupling constants, and upper limits for the\nphonon-scattering limited charge carrier mobilities. Within the limitations of\nthe model used, we can place an upper limit of 200$\\,$cm$^{2}$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$\nfor the room temperature charge carrier mobility in MAPbI$_{3}$ single\ncrystals. Our findings are important for the basic understanding of charge\ntransport processes and mechanical properties in metal halide perovskites.\n", "  In this paper, we study gauged solutions associated to a massive vector field\nrepresenting a spin-one condensate, namely the Proca field. We focus on regular\nspherically-symmetric solutions which we construct either using a\nself-interaction potential or general relativity in order to glue the solutions\ntogether. We start generating non-gravitating solutions, so-called, Proca\nQ-balls and charged Proca Q-balls. Then, we turn-on backreaction on the metric,\nallowing gravity to hold together the Proca condensate, to study the so-called\nProca stars, charged Proca stars, Proca Q-stars and charged Proca Q-stars.\n", "  We present all-multiplicity evidence that the tree-level S-matrix of gluons\nand gravitons in heterotic string theory can be reduced to color-ordered\nsingle-trace amplitudes of the gauge multiplet. Explicit amplitude relations\nare derived for up to three gravitons, up to two color traces and an arbitrary\nnumber of gluons in each case. The results are valid to all orders in the\ninverse string tension $\\alpha'$ and generalize to the ten-dimensional\nsuperamplitudes which preserve 16 supercharges. Their field-theory limit\nresults in an alternative proof of the recently discovered relations between\nEinstein-Yang-Mills amplitudes and those of pure Yang-Mills theory.\nSimilarities and differences between the integrands of the Cachazo-He-Yuan\nformulae and the heterotic string are investigated.\n", "  We explore some aspects of three-dimensional higher-spin holography by\nstudying scalar fluctuations in the background of higher-spin black holes. We\nfurnish an independent derivation of the bulk-boundary propagator by purely\ninvoking a well-known infinite dimensional matrix representation of\n$hs[\\lambda]$ algebra related to its construction as a quotient of the\nuniversal enveloping algebra of $sl(2)$, thus evading the need in previous\nliterature to perform an analytic continuation from some integer to $\\lambda$.\nThe propagator and the boundary two-point functions are derived for black hole\nsolutions in $hs[\\lambda]\\times hs[\\lambda]$ Chern-Simons theory with spin-3\nand spin-4 charges up to second-order in the potentials. We match them with\nthree- and four-point torus correlation functions of the putative dual\nconformal field theory which has $\\mathcal{W}_\\infty [\\lambda]$ symmetry and is\ndeformed by higher-spin currents.\n", "  We present a general derivation of the spectrum of excitations for gapless\nstates of zero entropy density in Bethe ansatz solvable models. Our formalism\nis valid for an arbitrary choice of bare energy function which is relevant to\nsituations where the Hamiltonian for time evolution differs from the\nHamiltonian in a (generalized) Gibbs ensemble, i.e. out of equilibrium. The\nenergy of particle and hole excitations, as measured with the time-evolution\nHamiltonian, is shown to include additional contributions stemming from the\nshifts of the Fermi points that may now have finite energy. The finite-size\neffects are also derived and the connection with conformal field theory\ndiscussed. The critical exponents can still be obtained from the finite-size\nspectrum, however the velocity occurring here differs from the one in the\nconstant Casimir term. The derivation highlights the importance of the phase\nshifts at the Fermi points for the critical exponents of asymptotes of\ncorrelations. We generalize certain results known for the ground state and\ndiscuss the relation to the dressed charge (matrix). Finally, we discuss the\nfinite-size corrections in the presence of an additional particle or hole which\nare important for dynamical correlation functions.\n", "  We model vertical breathing mode perturbations in the Milky Way's stellar\ndisc and study their effects on estimates of the local dark matter density,\nsurface density, and vertical force. Evidence for these perturbations, which\ninvolve compression and expansion of the Galactic disc perpendicular to its\nmidplane, come from the SEGUE, RAVE, and LAMOST surveys. We show that their\nexistence may lead to systematic errors of $10\\%$ or greater in the vertical\nforce $K_z(z)$ at $|z|=1.1\\,{\\rm kpc}$. These errors translate to $\\gtrsim\n25\\%$ errors in estimates of the local dark matter density. Using different\nmono-abundant subpopulations as tracers offers a way out: if the inferences\nfrom all tracers in the Gaia era agree, then the dark matter determination will\nbe robust. Disagreement in the inferences from different tracers will signal\nthe breakdown of the unperturbed model and perhaps provide the means for\ndetermining the nature of the perturbation.\n", "  We study the collective magnetic excitations of the recently discovered\n$C_{4}$ symmetric spin-density wave states of iron-based superconductors with\nparticular emphasis on their orbital character based on an itinerant\nmultiorbital approach. This is important since the $C_{4}$ symmetric\nspin-density wave states exist only at moderate interaction strengths where\ndamping effects from a coupling to the continuum of particle-hole excitations\nstrongly modifies the shape of the excitation spectra compared to predictions\nbased on a local moment picture. We uncover a distinct orbital polarization\ninherent to magnetic excitations in $C_{4}$ symmetric states, which provide a\nroute to identify the different commensurate magnetic states appearing in the\ncontinuously updated phase diagram of the iron-pnictide family.\n", "  Optically active spins in solid-state systems can be engineered to emit\nphotons that are entangled with the spin in the solid. This allows for\napplications such as quantum communications, quantum key distribution, and\ndistributed quantum computing. Recently, there has been a strong interest in\nsilicon carbide defects, as they emit very close to the telecommunication\nwavelength, making them excellent candidates for long range quantum\ncommunications. In this work we develop explicit schemes for spin-photon\nentanglement in several SiC defects: the silicon monovacancy, the silicon\ndivacancy, and the NV center in SiC. Distinct approaches are given for (i)\nsingle-photon and spin entanglement and (ii) the generation of long strings of\nentangled photons. The latter are known as cluster states and comprise a\nresource for measurement-based quantum information processing.\n", "  Using transient fluorescent spectra at time-zero, we develop a\ndensity-resolved fluorescent spectroscopic method for investigating\nphotoproducts in CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite and related photophysics. The density\ndependent dynamical co-existence of excitons and free carriers over a wide\ndensity range is experimentally observed for the first time. The exciton\nbinding energy (EB) and the effective mass of electron-hole pair can be\nestimated based on such co-existence. No ionic polarization is found\ncontributing to photophysical behavior. It also solves the conflict between the\nlarge experimentally measured EB and the small predicted values. The\nspectroscopic method also helps to detect the true free carrier density under\ncontinuous illumination without the interference of ionic conductivity. Our\nmethods and results profoundly enrich the study and understanding of the\nphotophysics in perovskite materials for photovoltaic applications.\n", "  Gossip algorithms is a common term to describe protocols for unreliable\ninformation dissemination in natural networks, which are not optimally designed\nfor efficient communication between network entities. We consider application\nof gossip algorithms to quantum networks and show that any quantum network can\nbe updated to optimal configuration with local operations and classical\ncommunication. This allows to seed-up -- in the best case exponentially -- the\nquantum information dissemination. Irrespective of the initial configuration of\nthe quantum network, the update requiters at most polynomial number of local\noperations and classical communication.\n", "  We introduce a generic scheme to perform non-perturbative linked cluster\nexpansions in long-range ordered quantum phases. Clusters are considered to be\nsurrounded by an ordered reference state leading to effective edge-fields in\nthe exact diagonalization on clusters which break the associated symmetry of\nthe ordered phase. Two approaches, based either on a self-consistent solution\nof the order parameter or on minimal sensitivity with respect to the\nground-state energy per site, are formulated to find the optimal edge-field in\neach NLCE order. Furthermore, we investigate the scaling behavior of the NLCE\ndata sequences towards the infinite-order limit. We apply our scheme to gapped\nand gapless ordered phases of XXZ Heisenberg models on various lattices and for\nspins 1/2 and 1 using several types of cluster expansions ranging from a\nfull-graph decomposition, rectangular clusters, up to more symmetric square\nclusters. It is found that the inclusion of edge-fields allows to regularize\nnon-perturbative linked-cluster expansions in ordered phases yielding\nconvergent data sequences. This includes the long-range spin-ordered ground\nstate of the spin-1/2 and spin-1 Heisenberg model on the square and triangular\nlattice as well as the trimerized valence bond crystal of the spin-1 Heisenberg\nmodel on the kagome lattice.\n", "  The optical theorem relates the total scattering cross-section of a given\nstructure with its forward scattering, but does not impose any restrictions on\nother directions. Strong backward-forward asymmetry in scattering could be\nachieved by exploring retarded coupling between particles, exhibiting both\nelectric and magnetic resonances. Here, a hybrid magneto-electric particle\n(HMEP), consisting of a split ring resonator acting as a magnetic dipole and a\nwire antenna acting as an electric dipole, is shown to possess asymmetric\nscattering properties. When illuminated from opposite directions with the same\npolarization of the electric field, the structure has exactly the same forward\nscattering, while the backward scattering is drastically different. The\nscattering cross section is shown to be as low as zero at a narrow frequency\nrange when illuminated from one side, while being maximal at the same frequency\nrange when illuminated from the other side. Theoretical predictions of the\nphenomena are supported with both numerical and experimental conformations,\nobtained at the GHz frequency range, and all are in a good agreement with each\nother. HMEP meta-particles could be used as building blocks for various\nmetamaterials assembling solar cells, invisibility cloaks, holographic masks\nand more.\n", "  Electron emission from nanometric size emitters becomes of increasing\ninterest due to its involvement to sharp electron sources, vacuum breakdown\nphenomena and various other vacuum nanoelectronics applications. The most\ncommonly used theoretical tools for the calculation of electron emission are\nstill nowadays the Fowler-Nordheim and the Richardson-Laue-Dushman equations\nalthough it has been shown since the 1990's that they are inadequate for\nnanometrically sharp emitters or in the intermediate thermal-field regime. In\nthis paper we develop a computational method for the calculation of emission\ncurrents and Nottingham heat, which automatically distinguishes among different\nemission regimes, and implements the appropriate calculation method for each.\nOur method covers all electron emission regimes (thermal, field and\nintermediate), aiming to maximize the calculation accuracy while minimizing the\ncomputational time. As an example, we implemented it in atomistic simulations\nof the thermal evolution of Cu nanotips under strong electric fields and found\nthat the predicted behaviour of such nanotips by the developed technique\ndiffers significantly from estimations obtained based on the Fowler-Nordheim\nequation. Finally, we show that our tool can be also successfully applied in\nthe analysis of experimental I-V data.\n", "  Here, the particle-wave duality principle is generalized to accommodate the\nnon-relativistic quantum mechanics of interacting (correlated) particles.\nThrough the creation and propagation of concurrent stochastic ensembles of\nwalkers in physical and in Hilbert spaces one can correctly predict the ground\nstate and the time evolution of a subsystem of a larger quantum system in a\nquantum Monte Carlo manner. It is shown that such walker ensembles can be\nconstructed straightforwardly through a random sampling (windowing) applied to\nthe mean-field approximation. Our calculations reveal that although the\nresulting individual quantum trajectories may differ significantly from those\npredicted by the many-body Schr\\\"odinger equation, the evolution of the\nparticle distribution and the decoherence due to the Coulomb interaction can be\naccounted for correctly using an explicitly parameterized quantum non-locality.\n", "  Topological magnon insulators in insulating Kagom\\'e ferromagnets have been\nextensively studied in a series of papers. It has been established that\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is the key ingredient to observe a\nnontrivial topological magnon with edge modes. However, insulating\nantiferromagnets on the Kagom\\'e lattice are frustrated systems considered as a\nplayground for studying quantum spin liquid physics. In these systems the DMI\ncan induce a coplanar but noncollinear magnetic orders with a $\\mathbf{q}=0$\npropagating wavevector. We show that topological magnon bands are absent in\nthis coplanar spin texture in sharp contrast to collinear ferromagnets with\nDMI. Hence, geometrically frustrated Kagom\\'e antiferromagnets can be deemed\ntopologically trivial. The presence of an out-of-plane magnetic field in these\nfrustrated magnets induces noncoplanar spin textures exhibiting a nonzero spin\nscalar chirality. We show that the field-induced spin chirality provides\ntopological magnon bands in Kagom\\'e antiferromagnets without the need of DMI\nand survives in the chiral spin liquid phase of frustrated magnets. Possible\nexperimentally material includes iron jarosite KFe$_3$(OH)$_{6}$(SO$_{4}$)$_2$.\n", "  Anomalous diffusion exists widely in polymer and biological systems. Pulsed\nfield gradient (PFG) techniques have been increasingly used to study anomalous\ndiffusion in NMR and MRI. However, the interpretation of PFG anomalous\ndiffusion is complicated. Moreover, there is not an exact signal attenuation\nexpression based on fractional derivatives for PFG anomalous diffusion, which\nincludes the finite gradient pulse width effect. In this paper, a new method, a\nMainardi-Luchko-Pagnini (MLP) phase distribution approximation, is proposed to\ndescribe PFG fractional diffusion. MLP phase distribution is a non-Gaussian\nphase distribution. From the fractional diffusion equation based on fractional\nderivatives in both real space and phase space, the obtained probability\ndistribution function is a MLP distribution. The MLP distribution leads to a\nMittag-Leffler function based PFG signal attenuation rather than the\nexponential or stretched exponential attenuation that is obtained from a\nGaussian phase distribution (GPD) under a short gradient pulse approximation.\nThe MLP phase distribution approximation is employed to get a complete signal\nattenuation expression E{\\alpha}(-Dfb*{\\alpha},\\b{eta}) that includes the\nfinite gradient pulse width effect for all three types of PFG fractional\ndiffusion. The results obtained in this study are in agreement with the results\nfrom the literature. These results provide a new, convenient approximation\nformalism to interpret complex PFG fractional diffusion experiments.\n", "  Direct imaging of exoplanets by reflected starlight is extremely challenging\ndue to the large luminosity ratio to the primary star. Wave-front control is a\ncritical technique to attenuate the speckle noise in order to achieve an\nextremely high contrast. We present a phase quantization study of a spatial\nlight modulator for wave front control to meet the contrast requirement of\ndetection of a terrestrial planet in the habitable zone of a solar-type star.\nWe perform the numerical simulation by employing the SLM with different phase\naccuracy and actuator numbers, which are related to the achievable contrast. We\nuse an optimization algorithm to solve the quantization problems that is\nmatched to the controllable phase step of the SLM. Two optical configurations\nare discussed with the SLM located before and after the coronagraph focal plane\nmask. The simulation result has constrained the specification for SLM phase\naccuracy in the above two optical configurations. Finally, we have demonstrated\nthat a SLM with more actuators can deliver a competitive contrast performance\nto that by using a deformable mirror.\n", "  The production of two meson electromagnetic bound states and free meson pairs\n$\\pi^+\\pi^-$, $K^+K^-$, $\\pi^+ K^{\\mp}$ in relativistic collisions has been\nconsidered. It is shown that making use of the exact Coulomb wave function for\ndimesoatom (DMA) allows one to calculate the yield of any nS state with desired\naccuracy. The relative probabilities of production of DMA and meson pairs in\nthe free state are estimated. The amplitude of DMA transition from 1S to 2P\nstate, which is essential for the pionium Lamb shift measurements, has been\nobtained.\n", "  The study of the Higgs boson properties is one of the most important tasks to\nbe accomplished in the next years, at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and at\nfuture colliders such as the Future Circular Collider in hadron-hadron mode\n(FCC-hh), the potential 100 TeV follow-up of the LHC machine. In this view the\nprecise study of the Higgs couplings to weak gauge bosons is crucial and\nrequires as much information as possible. After the recent calculation of the\nnext-to-leading order QCD corrections to the production cross sections and\ndifferential distributions of a Standard Model Higgs boson in association with\na pair of weak bosons, matched with parton shower in the POWHEG-BOX framework,\nwe present the gluon fusion correction $g g\\to H W^+_{} W^-_{} ( H Z Z)$ to the\nprocess $p p \\to H W^+_{} W^-_{} (H Z Z)$. This correction can be sizeable and\namounts to $+3\\,\\%$ ($+10\\,\\%$) in the $H W^+_{} W^-_{}$ process and $+5\\,\\%$\n($+18\\,\\%$) in the $H Z Z$ process at the LHC (FCC-hh). We also present the\nfirst study of the impact of the bottom--quark initiated channels $b\\bar{b}\\to\nH W^+_{} W^-_{} / H Z Z$ and find that they induce a significant $+18\\,\\%$\ncorrection in the $H W^+_{} W^-_{}$ channel at the FCC-hh. We present results\non total cross sections and distributions at the LHC and at the FCC-hh.\n", "  We present the Renormalization Group improvement of the Twin Higgs effective\npotential at cubic order in logarithmic accuracy. We first introduce a\nmodel-independent low-energy effective Lagrangian that captures both the\npseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson nature of the Higgs field and the twin light\ndegrees of freedom charged under a copy of the Standard Model. We then apply\nthe background field method to systematically re-sum all the one loop diagrams\ncontributing to the potential. We show how this technique can be efficient to\nimplicitly renormalize the higher-dimensional operators in the twin sector\nwithout classifying all of them. A prediction for the Higgs mass in the Twin\nHiggs model is derived and found to be of the order of $M_H \\sim 120\n~\\text{GeV}$ with an ultraviolet cut-off $m_*\\sim 10-20 ~\\text{TeV}$.\nIrrespective of any possible ultraviolet completion of the low-energy\nLagrangian, the infrared degrees of freedom alone are therefore enough to\naccount for the observed value of the Higgs mass through running effects.\n", "  We present a comprehensive investigation of the polarization properties of\nnon-polar a-plane InGaN quantum dots (QDs) and their origin with statistically\nsignificant experimental data and rigorous k.p modelling. The unbiased\nselection and study of 180 individual QDs allow us to compute an average\npolarization degree of 0.90, with a standard deviation of only 0.08. When\ncoupled with theoretical insights, we show that a-plane InGaN QDs are highly\ninsensitive to size differences, shape anisotropies, and indium content\nfluctuations. Furthermore, 91% of the studied QDs exhibit a polarization axis\nalong the crystal [1-100] axis, with the other 9% polarized orthogonal to this\ndirection. When coupled with their ability to emit single-photons, a-plane QDs\nare good candidates for the generation of linearly polarized single-photons, a\nfeature attractive for quantum cryptography protocols.\n", "  We report measurements of Hanbury Brown and Twiss correlation of coherent\nlight transmitted through disordered one-dimensional photonic lattices.\nAlthough such a lattice exhibits transverse Anderson localization when a single\ninput site is excited, uniform excitation precludes its observation. By\nexamining the Hanbury Brown--Twiss correlation for a uniformly excited\ndisordered lattice, we observe intensity anticorrelations associated with\nphoton antibunching--a signature of non-Gaussian statistics. Although the\nmeasured average intensity distribution is uniform, transverse Anderson\nlocalization nevertheless underlies the observed anticorrelation.\n", "  Monochromatic coherent light traversing a disordered photonic medium evolves\ninto a random field whose statistics are dictated by the disorder level. Here\nwe demonstrate experimentally that light statistics can be deterministically\ntuned in certain disordered lattices, even when the disorder level is held\nfixed, by controllably breaking the excitation symmetry of the lattice modes.\nWe exploit a lattice endowed with disorder-immune chiral symmetry in which the\neigenmodes come in skew-symmetric pairs. If a single lattice site is excited, a\n\"photonic thermalization gap\" emerges: the realm of sub-thermal light\nstatistics is inaccessible regardless of the disorder level. However, by\nexciting two sites with a variable relative phase, as in a traditional two-path\ninterferometer, the chiral symmetry is judiciously broken and interferometric\ncontrol over the light statistics is exercised, spanning sub-thermal and\nsuper-thermal regimes. These results may help develop novel incoherent lighting\nsources from coherent lasers.\n", "  The formation of gaps -- forbidden ranges in the values of a physical\nparameter -- is a ubiquitous feature of a variety of physical systems: from\nenergy bandgaps of electrons in periodic lattices and their analogs in\nphotonic, phononic, and plasmonic systems to pseudo energy gaps in aperiodic\nquasicrystals. Here, we report on a `thermalization' gap for light propagating\nin finite disordered structures characterized by disorder-immune chiral\nsymmetry -- the appearance of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors in\nskew-symmetric pairs. In this class of systems, the span of sub- thermal photon\nstatistics is inaccessible to input coherent light, which -- once the steady\nstate is reached -- always emerges with super-thermal statistics no matter how\nsmall the disorder level. We formulate an independent constraint that must be\nsatisfied by the input field for the chiral symmetry to be `activated' and the\ngap to be observed. This unique feature enables a new form of photon-statistics\ninterferometry: the deterministic tuning of photon statistics -- from\nsub-thermal to super-thermal -- in a compact device, without changing the\ndisorder level, via controlled excitation-symmetry-breaking realized by\nsculpting the amplitude or phase of the input coherent field.\n", "  To accommodate the recently observed non-zero reactor mixing angle\n$\\theta_{13}$, we consider the lepton mixing matrix as Tri-bimaximal mixing\n(TBM) form in the leading order along with a perturbation in neutrino sector.\nThe perturbation is taken to be a rotation in 23 plane followed by a rotation\nin 13 plane, i.e., $R_{23}(\\theta_{23}')R_{13}(\\theta_{13}',\\phi)$. We obtain\nthe allowed values of the parameters $\\theta_{23}'$, $\\theta_{13}'$ and $\\phi$,\nwhich can accommodate all the observed mixing angles consistently and calculate\nthe phenomenological observables such as the Dirac CP violating phase\n($\\delta_{CP}$), Jarlskog invariant ($J_{CP}$), effective majorana mass\n$M_{ee}^{\\nu}$, and $m_{\\nu_e}$, the electron neutrino mass. We find that\n$\\delta_{CP}$ can take any values between $0$ and $-\\pi/2$ and $M_{ee}^{\\nu}$\nalways comes below its experimental upper limit.\n", "  Motivated by recent experimental progress in studying weak decays of the\n$\\Lambda_c$ baryon we investigate its semileptonic decays in the framework of\nthe relativistic quark model based on the quasipotential approach with the\nQCD-motivated potential. The form factors of the $\\Lambda_c\\to \\Lambda l\\nu_l$\nand $\\Lambda_c\\to nl\\nu_l$ decays are calculated in the whole accessible\nkinematical region without extrapolations and additional model assumptions.\nRelativistic effects are systematically taken into account including\ntransformations of baryon wave functions from the rest to moving reference\nframe and contributions of the intermediate negative-energy states. Baryon wave\nfunctions found in the previous mass spectrum calculations are used for the\nnumerical evaluation. Comprehensive predictions for decay rates, asymmetries\nand polarization parameters are given. They agree well with available\nexperimental data.\n", "  We report $^{125}$Te nuclear magnetic resonance and $^{181}$Ta nuclear\nquadrupole resonance studies on single-crystal Ta$_{4}$Pd$_{3}$Te$_{16}$, which\nhas a quasi-one-dimensional structure and superconducts below $T_{\\rm c}=4.3$\nK. $^{181}$Ta with spin $I=7/2$ is sensitive to quadrupole interactions, while\n$^{125}$Te with spin $I=1/2$ can only relax by magnetic interactions. By\ncomparing the spin-lattice relaxation rate ( $1/T_{1}$) of $^{181}$Ta and\n$^{125}$Te, we found that electric-field-gradient (EFG) fluctuations develop\nbelow $80$ K. The EFG fluctuations are enhanced with decreasing temperature due\nto the fluctuations of a charge density wave that sets in at $T_{\\rm CDW}=20$\nK, below which the spectra are broadened and $1/T_{1}T$ drops sharply. In the\nsuperconducting state, $1/T_{1}$ shows a Hebel-Slichter coherence peak just\nbelow $T_{\\rm c}$ for $^{125}$Te, indicating that Ta$_{4}$Pd$_{3}$Te$_{16}$ is\na full-gap superconductor without nodes in the gap function. The coherence peak\nis absent in the $1/T_{1}$ of $^{181}$Ta due to the strong EFG fluctuations.\n", "  Using $N$-body+SPH simulations of galaxies falling into a cluster, we study\nthe evolution of their radial density profiles. When evolved in isolation,\ngalaxies develop a type~II (down-bending) profile. In the cluster, the\nevolution of the profile depends on the minimum cluster-centric radius the\ngalaxy reaches, which controls the degree of ram pressure stripping. If the\ngalaxy falls to $\\sim 50\\%$ of the virial radius, then the profile remains\ntype~II, but if the galaxy reaches down to $\\sim 20\\%$ of the virial radius the\nbreak weakens and the profile becomes more type~I like. The velocity\ndispersions are only slightly increased in the cluster simulations compared\nwith the isolated galaxy; random motion therefore cannot be responsible for\nredistributing material sufficiently to cause the change in the profile type.\nInstead we find that the joint action of radial migration driven by\ntidally-induced spirals and the outside-in quenching of star formation due to\nram pressure stripping alters the density profile. As a result, this model\npredicts a flattening of the age profiles amongst cluster lenticulars with\ntype~I profiles, which can be observationally tested. %\n", "  By systematically comparing experimental and theoretical transport\nproperties, we identify the polar optical phonon scattering as the dominant\nmechanism limiting electron mobility in beta-Ga2O3 to lower than 200 cm2/Vs at\n300 K for donor doping densities lower than 1018 cm-3. In spite of similar\nelectron effective mass of beta-Ga2O3 to GaN, the electron mobility is 10x\nlower because of a massive Frohlich interaction, due to the low phonon energies\nstemming from the crystal structure and strong bond ionicity. Based on the\ntheoretical and experimental analysis, we provide an empirical expression for\nelectron mobility in beta-Ga2O3 that should help calibrate its potential in\nhigh performance device design and applications.\n", "  We address Bloch oscillations of a spin-orbit coupled atom in periodic\npotentials of two types: Optical and Zeeman lattices. We show that in optical\nlattices the spin-orbit coupling allows controlling the direction of atomic\nmotion and may lead to complete suppression of the oscillations at specific\nvalues of the coupling strength. In Zeeman lattices the energy bands are found\nto cross each other at the boundaries of the Brillouin zone, resulting in\nperiod-doubling of the oscillations. In all cases, the oscillations are\naccompanied by rotation of the pseudo-spin, with a dynamics that is determined\nby the strength of the spin-orbit coupling. The predicted effects are discussed\nalso in terms of a Wannier-Stark ladder, which in optical lattices consist of\ntwo mutually-shifted equidistant sub-ladders.\n", "  The dynamics of a radiating charge is one of the oldest unsettled problems in\nclassical physics. The standard Lorentz-Abraham-Dirac (LAD) equation of motion\nis known to suffer from several pathologies and ambiguities. This paper briefly\nreviews these issues, and reports on a new model that fixes these difficulties\nin a natural way. This model is based on a hypothesis that there is an\ninfinitesimal time delay between action and reaction. This can be related to\nFeynman's regularization scheme, leading to a quasi-local QED with a natural UV\ncutoff, hence without the need for renormalization as the divergences are\nabsent. Besides leading to a pathology-free equation of motion, the new model\npredicts a modification of the Larmor formula that is testable with current and\nnear future ultra-intense lasers.\n", "  Motivated by a demand for explicit genus 1 Belyi maps from theoretical\nphysics, we give an efficient method of explicitly computing genus one Belyi\nmaps by (1) composing covering maps from elliptic curves to the Riemann sphere\nwith simpler (univariate) genus zero Belyi maps, as well as by (2) composing\nfurther with isogenies between elliptic curves. This gives many new explicit\ndessins on the doubly periodic plane, including several which have been\nrealized in the physics literature as so-called brane-tilings in the context of\nquiver gauge theories.\n", "  We make a detailed comparison between the direct method and the HAL QCD\npotential method for the baryon-baryon interactions, taking the $\\Xi\\Xi$ system\nat $m_\\pi= 0.51$ GeV in 2+1 flavor QCD and using both smeared and wall quark\nsources. The energy shift $\\Delta E_\\mathrm{eff}(t)$ in the direct method shows\nthe strong dependence on the choice of quark source operators, which means that\nthe results with either (or both) source are false. The time-dependent HAL QCD\nmethod, on the other hand, gives the quark source independent $\\Xi\\Xi$\npotential, thanks to the derivative expansion of the potential, which absorbs\nthe source dependence to the next leading order correction. The HAL QCD\npotential predicts the absence of the bound state in the $\\Xi\\Xi$($^1$S$_0$)\nchannel at $m_\\pi= 0.51$ GeV, which is also confirmed by the volume dependence\nof finite volume energy from the potential. We also demonstrate that the origin\nof the fake plateau in the effective energy shift $\\Delta E_\\mathrm{eff}(t)$ at\n$t \\sim 1$ fm can be clarified by a few low-lying eigenfunctions and\neigenvalues on the finite volume derived from the HAL QCD potential, which\nimplies that the ground state saturation of $\\Xi\\Xi$($^1$S$_0$) requires $t\n\\sim 10$ fm in the direct method for the smeared source on $(4.3 \\\n\\mathrm{fm})^3$ lattice, while the HAL QCD method does not suffer from such a\nproblem.\n", "  We present a preliminary design for a novel neutron detection system that is\ncompact, lightweight, and low power consuming, utilizing the CubeSat platform\nmaking it suitable for space-based applications. This is made possible using\nthe scintillating crystal lithium indium diselenide ($^6$LiInSe$_2$), the first\ncrystal to include $^6$Li in the crystalline structure, and a silicon avalanche\nphotodiode (Si-APD). The schematics of this instrument are presented as well as\nthe response of the instrument to initial testing under alpha radiation. A\nprincipal aim of this work is to demonstrate the feasibility of such a neutron\ndetection system within a CubeSat platform. The entire end-to-end system\npresented here is 10 cm x 10 cm x 15 cm, weighs 670 grams and requires 5 Volts\ndirect current at 3 Watts.\n", "  We report an investigation of temperature- and doping-dependent\nthermoelectric behaviors of topological semimetal Cd3As2. The electrical\nconductivity, thermal conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, and figure of merit\n(ZT) are calculated by using Boltzmann transport theory. The calculated\nthermoelectric properties of the pristine Cd3As2 match well the experimental\nresults. The electron or hole doping, especially the latter, is found improving\nmuch the thermoelectric behaviors of the material. The optimum merit ZT of\nCd3As2 with electron doping is found to be about 0.5 at T=700 K with n=1x1020\ncm-3, much larger than the maximum experimental value obtained for the pristine\nCd3As2 (~0.15). For the p-type Cd3As2, the maximal value of the Seebeck\ncoefficient as a function of temperature increases apparently with the increase\nof the hole doping concentration and its position shifts drastically towards\nthe lower temperature region compared to that of the n-type Cd3As2, leading to\nthe optimum merit ZT of about 0.5 obtained at low temperature of 500K (p=1x1020\ncm-3) in the p-type Cd3As2.\n", "  Cuprous (I) oxide (Cu_{2}O) based solar cells were fabricated with the use of\nthe electrodeposition technique at nanometre scale, and the structural,\nmorphological and electrical properties were investigated. The Cu_{2}O layers\nwere electrodeposited on crystalline and polycrystalline copper substrates. To\ncomplete the Cu_{2}O/Cu(100) and Cu_{2}O/Cu interfaces as the solar cells the\ntop electrodes of silver paste were painted on the rear of Cu_{2}O. The\ntheoretical analysis of the current voltage curve was provided to determine the\nvalues of electrical parameters of the most efficient solar cell of\nAg/Cu_{2}O/Cu(100) and clearly indicate presence of two Schottky barriers at\ninterfaces.\n", "  In this work we consider the following question: given a mechanical\nmicroswimming mechanism, does increased deformability of the swimmer body\nhinder or promote the motility of the swimmer? To answer this we study a\nmicroswimmer model composed of deformable beads connected with springs. We\ndetermine the velocity of the swimmer analytically, starting from the forces\ndriving the motion and assuming that the oscillations in the effective radii of\nthe beads are known and are much smaller than the radii themselves. We find\nthat to the lowest order, only the driving frequency mode of the surface\noscillations contributes to the swimming velocity, and that this velocity may\nboth rise and fall with the deformability of the beads depending on the spring\nconstant. To test these results, we run immersed boundary lattice Boltzmann\nsimulations of the swimmer, and show that they reproduce both the\nvelocity-promoting and velocity-hindering effects of bead deformability\ncorrectly in the predicted parameter ranges. Our results mean that for a\ngeneral swimmer, its elasticity determines whether passive deformations of the\nswimmer body, induced by the fluid flow, aid or oppose the motion.\n", "  We present two magnetometry-based methods suitable for assessing gradients in\nthe critical temperature and hence the composition of multifilamentary\nsuperconductors: AC magnetometry and Scanning Hall Probe Microscopy. The\nnovelty of the former technique lies in the iterative evaluation procedure we\ndeveloped, whereas the strength of the latter is the direct visualization of\nthe temperature dependent penetration of a magnetic field into the\nsuperconductor. Using the example of a PIT Nb3Sn wire, we demonstrate the\napplication of these techniques, and compare the respective results to each\nother and to EDX measurements of the Sn distribution within the sub-elements of\nthe wire.\n", "  The Minimal Supersymmetric Extension of the Standard Model (MSSM) is able to\nexplain the current data from neutrino physics. Unfortunately Split\nSupersymmetry as low energy approximation of this theory fails to generate a\nsolar square mass difference, including after the addition of bilinear R-Parity\nViolation. In this work, it is shown how one can derive an effective low energy\ntheory from the MSSM in the spirit of Split Supersymmetry, which has the\npotential of explaining the neutrino phenomenology. This is achieved by going\nbeyond leading order in the process of integrating out heavy scalars from the\noriginal theory, which results in non-renormalizable operators in the effective\nlow energy theory. It is found that in particular a $d=8$ operator is crucial\nfor the generation of the neutrino mass differences.\n", "  We present a timing analysis of two Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer observations\nof the microquasar GRS 1915+105 during the heartbeat state. The\nphase-frequency-power maps show that the intermediate-frequency aperiodic X-ray\nvariability weakens as the source softens in the slow rise phase, and when the\nquasi-periodic oscillation disappears in the rise phase of the pulse of the\ndouble-peaked class its sub-harmonic is still present with a hard phase lag. In\nthe slow rise phase, the energy-frequency-power maps show that most of the\naperiodic variability is produced in the corona, and may also induce the\naperiodic variability observed at low energies from an accretion disk, which is\nfurther supported by the soft phase lag especially in the\nintermediate-frequency range (with a time delay up to 20 ms). In the rise phase\nof the pulse, the low-frequency aperiodic variability is enhanced significantly\nand there is a prominent hard lag (with a time delay up to 50 ms), indicating\nthat the variability is induced by extension of the disk toward small radii as\nimplied by the increase in flux and propagates into the corona. However, during\nthe hard pulse of the double-peaked class, the variability shows no significant\nlag, which may be attributed to an optically thick corona. These timing results\nare generally consistent with the spectral results presented by Neilsen et al.\n(2011, 2012) which indicated that the slow rise phase corresponds to a local\nEddington limit and the rise phase of the pulse corresponds to a radiation\npressure instability in the disk.\n", "  We discuss the reduction of errors in the calculation of the form factor\n$f_+^{K \\pi}(0)$ with HISQ fermions on the $N_f=2+1+1$ MILC configurations from\nincreased statistics on some key ensembles, new data on ensembles with lattice\nspacings down to 0.042 fm and the study of finite-volume effects within\nstaggered ChPT. We also study the implications for the unitarity of the CKM\nmatrix in the first row and for current tensions with leptonic determinations\nof $\\vert V_{us}\\vert$.\n", "  We investigate the melting phenomena of pristine, free-standing infinite and\nfinite size graphene sheets via molecular dynamics simulation using AIREBO\npotential as implemented in the LAMMPS package. In our simulations, the\ntemperature of the systems under investigation are systematically heated up\nusing two independent heating protocols so that the resultant melting\ntemperatures from both schemes can be checked against each other for\nconsistency. The melting temperature of infinite graphene sheet is obtained by\nfollowing three independent computational experiments. In the first experiment,\nwe simulate the melting of various finite size graphenes, and then determine\nthe melting temperature of infinite graphene sheet as the temperature at which\nthe finite graphenes asymptotically grow in size. In the second experiment, we\nsimulate the melting of infinite single-wall carbon-nanotubes (SWCNTs) with\ndifferent radius, and then determine the melting temperature of infinite\ngraphene sheet as the temperature at which the radius of SWCNTs asymptotically\ngrows in size. In the third experiment, we heat up an infinite graphene that is\nformed by constructing a rectangular supercell which is subjected to periodic\nboundary condition at it sides. Melting temperature for infinite graphene\nobtained based on the first approach yields $\\sim$ 5799 K $\\pm$ 22 K. The\nsecond approach yield $\\sim$5302 K $\\pm$ 36 K, whereas $\\sim$5355 $\\pm$ 140 K\nfrom the third. There is an apparent disparity between the results from the\nfirst experiment and that of the second and third experiments due to\ndifferences in the technical details in these MD simulations. We cautiously\nconclude that, based on the consistency of the data of the second and third\nexperiments, that a free-standing infinite graphene sheet melts at the\ntemperature of 5302 K $\\pm$ 36 K, using AIREBO forcefield.\n", "  We have studied the breakdown of the integer quantum Hall (QH) effect with\nfully broken symmetry, in an ultra-high mobility graphene device sandwiched\nbetween two single crystal hexagonal boron nitride substrates. The evolution\nand stabilities of the QH states are studied quantitatively through the\nnonlinear transport with dc Hall voltage bias. The mechanism of the QH\nbreakdown in graphene and the movement of the Fermi energy with the electrical\nHall field are discussed. This is the first study in which the stabilities of\nfully symmetry broken QH states are probed all together. Our results raise the\npossibility that the v=6 states might be a better target for the quantum\nresistance standard.\n", "  We show how to construct pseudorandom permutations (PRPs) that remain secure\neven if the adversary can query the permutation on a quantum superposition of\ninputs. Such PRPs are called \\emph{quantum-secure}. Our construction combines a\nquantum-secure pseudorandom \\emph{function} together with constructions of\n\\emph{classical} format preserving encryption. By combining known results, we\nobtain the first quantum-secure PRP in this model whose security relies only on\nthe existence of one-way functions. Previously, to the best of the author's\nknowledge, quantum security of PRPs had to be assumed, and there were no prior\nsecurity reductions to simpler primitives, let alone one-way functions.\n", "  The Escaramujo Project was a series of eight hands-on laboratory courses on\nHigh Energy Physics and Astroparticle Instrumentation, in Latinamerican\nInstitutions. The Physicist Federico Izraelevitch traveled on a van with his\nwife and dogs from Chicago to Buenos Aires teaching the courses. The sessions\ntook place at Institutions in Mexico, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Colombia, Ecuador,\nPeru and Bolivia at an advanced undergraduate and graduate level. During these\nworkshops, each group built a modern cosmic ray detector based on plastic\nscintillator and silicon photomultipliers, designed specifically for this\nproject. After the courses, a functional detector remained at each institution\nto be used by the faculty to facilitate the training of future students and to\nsupport and enable local research activities. The five-days workshops covered\ntopics such as elementary particle and cosmic ray Physics, radiation detection\nand instrumentation, low-level light sensing with solid state devices,\nfront-end analog electronics and object-oriented data analysis (C++ and ROOT).\nThroughout this initiative, about a hundred of talented and highly motivated\nyoung students were reached. With the detector as a common thread, they were\nable to understand the designing principles and the underlying Physics involved\nin it, build the device, start it up, characterize it, take data and analyze\nit, mimicking the stages of a real elementary particle Physics experiment.\nBesides the aims to awaken vocations in science, technology and engineering,\nThe Escaramujo Project was an effort to strengthen the integration of\nLatinamerican academic institutions into the international scientific\ncommunity.\n", "  Unravelling the main initial dynamics responsible for chiral recognition is a\nkey stepin the understanding of many biological processes. However this\nchallenging task requires a sensitive enantiospecic probe to investigate\nmolecular dynamics on their natural femtosecond timescale. Here we show that,\nin the gas phase, the ultrafast relaxationdynamics of photoexcited chiral\nmolecules can be tracked by recording Time-ResolvedPhotoElectron Circular\nDichroism (TR-PECD) resulting from the photoionisation bya circularly polarized\nprobe pulse. A large forward/backward asymmetry along theprobe propagation axis\nis observed in the photoelectron angular distribution. Its evolution with\npump-probe delay reveals ultrafast dynamics that are inaccessible in\ntheangle-integrated photoelectron spectrum nor via the usual electron emission\nanisotropyparameter ($\\beta$). PECD, which originates from the electron\nscattering in the chiral molecular potential, appears as a new sensitive\nobservable for ultrafast molecular dynamicsin chiral systems.\n", "  In their Comment [arXiv:1609.06174 (2016)], Kuklov and Svistunov argue that\n(a) our discussion of the role of basal-plane dislocations in mass-flow\njunction experiments in our recent Letter (Phys. Rev. Lett. 117, 045301 (2016))\nis misleading, (b) our results do not provide new insight into dislocation\ndissociation nor superfluidity of dislocation cores and (c) our calculations\nlack control of the numerical data. Here we offer our Reply.\n", "  Six billion years from now, while evolving on the asymptotic giant branch\n(AGB), the Sun will metamorphose from a red giant into a beautiful planetary\nnebula. This spectacular evolution will impact the Solar System planets, but\nobservational confirmations of the predictions of evolution models are still\nelusive as no planet orbiting an AGB star has yet been discovered. The nearby\nAGB red giant L2 Puppis (d = 64 pc) is surrounded by an almost edge-on\ncircumstellar dust disk. We report new observations with ALMA at very high\nangular resolution (18 x 15 mas) in band 7 (f ~ 350 GHz) that allow us to\nresolve the velocity profile of the molecular disk. We establish that the gas\nvelocity profile is Keplerian within the central cavity of the dust disk,\nallowing us to derive the mass of the central star L2 Pup A, mA = 0.659 +/-\n0.011 +/- 0.041 Msun (+/- 6.6%). From evolutionary models, we determine that L2\nPup A had a near-solar main sequence mass, and is therefore a close analog of\nthe future Sun in 5 to 6 Gyr. The continuum map reveals the presence of a\nsecondary source (B) at a radius of 2 AU contributing fB/ fA = 1.3 +/- 0.1% of\nthe flux of the AGB star. L2 Pup B is also detected in CO emission lines at a\nradial velocity of vB = 12.2 +/- 1.0 km/s. The close coincidence of the center\nof rotation of the gaseous disk with the position of the continuum emission\nfrom the AGB star allows us to constrain the mass of the companion to mB = 12\n+/- 16 MJup. L2 Pup B is most likely a planet or low mass brown dwarf with an\norbital period around 5 years. Its continuum brightness and molecular emission\nsuggest that it may be surrounded by an extended molecular atmosphere or an\naccretion disk. L2 Pup therefore emerges as a promising vantage point on the\ndistant future of our Solar System.\n", "  Improving software citation and credit continues to be a topic of interest\nacross and within many disciplines, with numerous efforts underway. In this\nBirds of a Feather (BoF) session, we started with a list of actionable ideas\nfrom last year's BoF and other similar efforts and worked alone or in small\ngroups to begin implementing them. Work was captured in a common Google\ndocument; the session organizers will disseminate or otherwise put this\ninformation to use in or for the community in collaboration with those who\ncontributed.\n", "  A new method for measuring chance-coincidence backgrounds during the\ncollection of coincidence data is presented. The method relies on acquiring\ndata with near-zero dead time, which is now realistic due to the increasing\ndeployment of flash electronic-digitizer (waveform digitizer) techniques. An\nexperiment designed to use this new method is capable of acquiring more\ncoincidence data, and a much reduced statistical fluctuation of the measured\nbackground. A statistical analysis is presented, and used to derive a figure of\nmerit for the new method. Factors of four improvement over other analyses are\nrealistic. The technique is illustrated with preliminary data taken as part of\na program to make new measurements of the prompt fission neutron spectra at Los\nAlamos Neutron Science Center. It is expected that the these measurements will\noccur in a regime where the maximum figure of merit will be exploited.\n", "  Optimized topology of bi-material acoustic metamaterial lattice plates is\nstudied for maximized locally resonant bandgap of flexural guided waves.\nOptimized layout of the two relatively stiff and compliant material phases in\nthe design domain is explored, free from any restrictions on the topology and\nshape of the relevant domains. Multiobjective optimization is performed through\nwhich maximized effective stiffness or minimized overall mass of the bandgap\ntopology is additionally ensured. Extreme and selected intermediate optimized\ntopologies of Pareto fronts are presented and their bandgap efficiencies and\neffective stiffness are compared. The bi-material constitution of selected\ntopologies are further altered and modal band structure of resultant\nmultilateral and porous designs are evaluated. Novel, core-shell like, locally\nresonant bandgaps are introduced. It is shown that how the bandgap efficiency\nand structural mass and/or stiffness can be optimized through optimized\nmicrostructural design of the matrix and the resonating core domains.\n", "  Vibrational coupling is relevant not only for dissipation of excess energy\nafter chemical reactions but also for elucidating molecular structure and\ndynamics. It is particularly important for OH stretch vibrational spectra of\nwater, for which it is known that in bulk both intra- and intermolecular\ncoupling alter the intensity and line shape of the spectra. In contrast with\nbulk, the unified picture of the inter/intra-molecular coupling of OH groups at\nthe water-air interface has been lacking. Here, combining sum-frequency\ngeneration experiments and simulation for isotopically diluted water and\nalcohols, we unveil effects of inter- and intramolecular coupling on the\nvibrational spectra of interfacial water. Our results show that both inter- and\nintramolecular coupling contribute to the OH stretch vibrational response of\nthe neat H2O surface, with intramolecular coupling generating a double-peak\nfeature, while the intermolecular coupling induces a significant red shift in\nthe OH stretch response.\n", "  High-throughput computational materials design promises to greatly accelerate\nthe process of discovering new materials and compounds, and of optimizing their\nproperties. The large databases of structures and properties that result from\ncomputational searches, as well as the agglomeration of data of heterogeneous\nprovenance leads to considerable challenges when it comes to navigating the\ndatabase, representing its structure at a glance, understanding\nstructure-property relations, eliminating duplicates and identifying\ninconsistencies. Here we present a case study, based on a data set of\nconformers of amino acids and dipeptides, of how machine-learning techniques\ncan help addressing these issues. We will exploit a recently developed strategy\nto define a metric between structures, and use it as the basis of both\nclustering and dimensionality reduction techniques showing how these can help\nreveal structure-property relations, identify outliers and inconsistent\nstructures, and rationalise how perturbations (e.g. binding of ions to the\nmolecule) affect the stability of different conformers.\n", "  Despite the inherently quantum mechanical nature of hydrogen bonding, it is\nunclear how nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) alter the strengths of hydrogen\nbonds. With this in mind, we use ab initio path integral molecular dynamics to\ndetermine the absolute contribution of NQEs to the binding in DNA base pair\ncomplexes, arguably the most important hydrogen-bonded systems of all. We find\nthat depending on the temperature, NQEs can either strengthen or weaken the\nbinding within the hydrogen-bonded complexes. As a somewhat counterintuitive\nconsequence, NQEs can have a smaller impact on hydrogen bond strengths at\ncryogenic temperatures than at room temperature. We rationalize this in terms\nof a competition of NQEs between low-frequency and high-frequency vibrational\nmodes. Extending this idea, we also propose a simple model to predict the\ntemperature dependence of NQEs on hydrogen bond strengths in general.\n", "  We consider a vertical cavity composed of two chambers separated by a\nretractable thermally insulated thin membrane. The upper and lower chambers are\nfilled with an incompressible Boussinesq fluid and maintained at temperatures\n$T_2$ and $T_1>T_2$, respectively by two separate heaters. Upon retraction of\nthe membrane, the two fluid masses form an unstably stratified configuration\nwith cold and heavy fluid overlying a warmer and lighter fluid and separated by\na non-free interface across which there is a jump in the density. The aim of\nthis paper is to determine the threshold conditions for convection onset and\nassociated fluid flow patterns induced by this discontinuous density\nstratification. We find that the discontinuity of the density profile leads to\nthe appearance of temperature perturbation iso-contours that have a lens shape\ninstead of the classical oval shape and that the mixing is confined to near the\nlocation of the density jump with stagnant and isothermal fluid away from the\ndiscontinuity. We derive the flux conditions at the discontinuity interface and\nshow that it acts like a heat sink for both the lower and upper fluid layers.\nMoreover, we put forth the dependence of the stability threshold parameters for\nconvection onset on the locus of the density discontinuity. The experimental\nset-up suggested in the paper can be used to test the predictions of the\npresent theory.\n", "  Numerous experimental and theoretical studies have focused on low-dimensional\nsystems locally perturbed by the biased tip of a scanning force microscope. In\nall cases either open or closed weakly gate-tunable nanostructures have been\ninvestigated, such as quantum point contacts, open or closed quantum dots, etc.\nWe study the behaviour of the conductance of a quantum point contact with a\ngradually forming adjacent cavity in series under the influence of a scanning\ngate. Here, an initially open quantum point contact system gradually turns into\na closed cavity system. We observe branches and interference fringes known from\nquantum point contacts coexisting with irregular conductance fluctuations.\nUnlike the branches, the fluctuations cover the entire area of the cavity. In\ncontrast to previous studies, we observe and investigate branches under the\ninfluence of the confining stadium potential, which is gradually built up. We\nfind that the branches exist only in the area surrounded by cavity top gates.\nAs the stadium shrinks, regular fringes originate from tip-induced\nconstrictions leading to quantized conduction. In addition, we observe arc-like\nareas reminiscent of classical electron trajectories in a chaotic cavity. We\nalso argue that electrons emanating from the quantum point contact spread out\nlike a fan leaving branch-like regions of enhanced backscattering.\n", "  We present XID+ a new generation of software for prior-based photometry\nextraction in the Herschel SPIRE maps. Based on a Bayesian framework, XID+\nallows the inclusion of prior information and gives access to the full\nposterior probability distribution of fluxes. XID+ is developed within the\nHerschel Extragalactic Legacy Project (HELP) and is available at\nhttps://github.com/H-E-L-P/XID_plus.\n", "  In high energy physics, results from searches for new particles or rare\nprocesses are often reported using a modified frequentist approach, known as\n$\\rm{CL_s}$ method. In this paper, we study the properties of the derivatives\nof $\\rm{CL_s}$ and $\\rm{CL_{s+b}}$ as signal strength estimators if the\nconfidence levels are interpreted as credible intervals. Our approach allows\nobtaining best fit points and $\\chi^2$ functions which can be used for\nphenomenology studies. In addition, this approach can be used to incorporate\n$\\rm{CL_s}$ results into Bayesian combinations.\n", "  Below we study theoretically and numerically the asymptotics of the algebraic\npart of the spectrum for the quasi-exactly solvable sextic potential, its level\ncrossing points, and its monodromy in the complex plane of its parameter. We\nalso discuss connection between the quasi-exactly solvable sextic and the\nclassical quartic potential.\n", "  We consider two point charges in electrostatic interaction between them\nwithin the framework of a nonlinear model, associated with QED, that provides\nfiniteness of their field energy. We argue that if the two charges are equal to\neach other the repulsion force between them disappears when they are infinitely\nclose to each other, but remains as usual infinite if their values are\ndifferent. This implies that within any system to which such a model may be\napplicable the point charge is fractional, it may only be $2^n$-fold of a\ncertain fundamental charge, n=0,1,2... We find the common field of the two\ncharges in a dipole approximation, where the separation between them is much\nsmaller than the observation distance.\n", "  In our previous research, it has been demonstrated that such inelastic\nprocesses in atom Rydberg-atom collisions, as chemi-ionization and (n-n')\nmixing, should be considered together. Here we will review the present state of\nthe art and the actual problems will be discussed. In this context, we will\nconsider the influence of the (n-n')-mixing during a symmetric atom\nRydberg-atom collision processes on the intensity of chemi-ionization process.\nIt will be taken into account H(1s) + H*(n) collisional systems, where the\nprincipal quantum number n $>>$ 1. It will be demonstrated that the inclusion\nof (n-n') mixing in the calculation, influences significantly on the values of\nchemi-ionization rate coefficients, particularly in the lower part of the block\nof the Rydberg states. Different possible channels of the (n-n')-mixing\ninfluence on chemi-ionization rate coefficients will be demonstrated. The\npossibility of interpretation of the (n-n')-mixing influence will be considered\non the basis of two existing methods for describing of the inelastic processes\nin symmetrical atom Rydberg-atom collisions.\n", "  We present an \"uncertainty principle\" for quantum channels, showing a\nrelationship between the dimensions of the range of a channel and the range of\nits complement. We examine some interesting specific cases, and discuss\nconsequences for privacy of quantum channels.\n", "  Negative feedback is a powerful approach capable of improving several aspects\nof a system. In linear electronics, it has been critical for allowing\ninvariance to device properties. Negative feedback is also known to enhance\nlinearity in amplification, which is one of the most important foundations of\nlinear electronics. At the same time, thousands of transistors types have been\nmade available, suggesting that these devices, in addition to their known\nvariability of parameters, have distinguishing properties. The current work\nreports a systematic approach to quantifying the potential of negative\nfeedback, with respect to bipolar transistors, as a means to providing device\ninvariance and linearity. Several methods, including concepts from multivariate\nstatistics and complex systems, are applied at the theoretical as well as\nexperimental levels, and a number of interesting results are obtained and\ndiscussed. For instance, it has been verified that the transistors types indeed\nhave well-defined characteristics which clearly segregate them into groups. The\naddition of feedback at moderate and intense levels promoted uniformization of\nthe properties of these transistors when used in a class A common emitter\nconfiguration. However, such effect occurred with different efficiency\nregarding the considered device features, and even intense feedback was unable\nto completely eliminate device dependence. This indicates that it would be\ninteresting to consider the device properties in linear design even when\nnegative feedback is applied. We also verified that the linearization induced\nin the considered experiments is relatively modest, with effects that depend on\ntype of transfer function of the original devices.\n", "  In a recent manuscript published in the Arxives (arXiv:1610.03049v1), it is\nclaimed that it should be more appropriate to refer to the equation of\nhydrostatic equilibrium in a static spherically symmetric spacetime, supported\nby an isotropic perfect fluid, as the \"Oppenheimer-Volkoff (OV) equation\",\ninstead of the \"Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV)\", as is frequently done. As we\nshall see in this brief note, such a claim is not supported by the existing\nbibliography.\n", "  It is shown that in (2+1)-dimensional condensed matter systems, induced\ngravitational Chern-Simons (CS) action can play a crucial role for coherent\nspin transport in a finite geometry, provided zero-curvature condition is\nsatisfied on the boundary. The role of the resultant KdV solitons is\nexplicated. The fact that KdV solitons can pass through each other without\ninterference, represent 'resistanceless' spin transport.\n", "  The $1/4$-filled organic compound,\n$\\delta$-(EDT-TTF-CONMe$_{2}$)$_{2}$AsF$_6$ is a frustrated two-dimensional\ntriangular magnetic system as shown by high-frequency (111.2 and 222.4 GHz)\nelectron spin resonance (ESR) and structural data in the literature. The\nmaterial gradually orders antiferromagnetically below 40~K but some\nmagnetically disordered domains persist down to 4 K. We propose that in defect\nfree regions frustration prevents true magnetic order down to at least 4 K in\nspite of the large first- and second-neighbor exchange interactions along\nchains and between chains, respectively. The antiferromagnetic (AFM) order\ngradually developing below 40 K nucleates around structural defects that\nlocally cancel frustration. Two antiferromagnetic resonance modes mapped in the\nprincipal planes at 4~K are assigned to the very weakly interacting\none-dimensional molecular chains in antiferromagnetic regions.\n", "  A technique is proposed to cool Fermi gases to the regime of quantum\ndegeneracy based on the expected inhibition of spontaneous emission due to the\nPauli principle. The reduction of the linewidth for spontaneous emission\noriginates a corresponding reduction of the Doppler temperature, which under\nspecific conditions may give rise to a runaway process through which fermions\nare progressively cooled. The approach requires a combination of a\nmagneto-optical trap as a cooling system and an optical dipole trap to enhance\nquantum degeneracy. This results in expected Fermi degeneracy factors $T/T_F$\ncomparable to the lowest values recently achieved, with potential for a direct\nimplementation in optical lattices. The experimental demonstration of this\ntechnique should also indirectly provide a macroscopic manifestation of the\nPauli exclusion principle at the atomic physics level.\n", "  In the coming era of massive surveys (e.g. LSST, SKA), the role of the\ndatabase designers and the algorithms they choose to adopt becomes the decisive\nfactor in scientific progress. Systems that allow/encourage users/scientists to\nbe more creative with the reduction/analysis algorithms can greatly enhance\nscientific productivity. The separation/modularity of the detection processes\nand catalog production is one proposal for achieving `Reduction/analysis\nalgorithms for large databases and vice versa' (a key theme for the 26th\nADASS). With the new noise-based detection paradigm, non-parametric detection\nis now possible for astronomical objects to very low surface brightness limits.\nIn our implementation, one software (NoiseChisel) is in charge of detection and\nanother (MakeCatalog) is in charge of catalog production. This modularity has\nmany advantages for pipeline developers, and more importantly, it empowers\nscientific curiosity and creativity.\n", "  Transient opto-electrical measurements of methylammonium lead iodide (MALI)\nperovskite solar cells (PSCs) are performed and analyzed in order to elucidate\nthe operating mechanisms. The current response to a light pulse or voltage\npulse shows an extraordinarily broad dynamic range covering 9 orders of\nmagnitude in time - from microseconds to minutes - until steady-state is\nreached. Evidence of a slowly changing charge density at the perovskite layer\nboundaries is found, which is most probably caused by mobile ions.\nCurrent-voltage curves (IV curves) are measured with very fast scan-rate after\nkeeping the cell for several seconds at a constant voltage as proposed by Tress\net al. Numerical drift-diffusion simulations reproduce the measured IV curves\nusing different distributions of ions in the model. Analysing the band diagram\nof the simulation result sheds light on the operating mechanism. To further\ninvestigate the effects at short time scales (below milliseconds)\nphoto-generated charge extraction by linearly increasing voltage (photo-CELIV)\nexperiments are performed. We postulate that mobility imbalance in combination\nwith deep hole trapping leads to dynamic doping causing effects from\nmicroseconds to milliseconds. Comprehensive transient drift-diffusion\nsimulations of the photo-CELIV experiments strengthen this hypothesis. This\nadvanced characterization approach combining dynamic response measurements and\nnumerical simulations represents a key step on the way to a comprehensive\nunderstanding of device working mechanisms in emerging perovskite solar cells.\n", "  Stars are not perfectly spherically symmetric. They are deformed by rotation\nand magnetic fields. Until now, the study of stellar shapes has only been\npossible with optical interferometry for a few of the fastest-rotating nearby\nstars. We report an asteroseismic measurement, with much better precision than\ninterferometry, of the asphericity of an A-type star with a rotation period of\n100 days. Using the fact that different modes of oscillation probe different\nstellar latitudes, we infer a tiny but significant flattening of the star's\nshape of $\\Delta R/R = (1.8 \\pm 0.6) \\times 10^{-6}$. For a stellar radius $R$\nthat is $2.24$ times the solar radius, the difference in radius between the\nequator and the poles is $\\Delta R = 3 \\pm 1$ km. Because the observed $\\Delta\nR/R$ is only one-third of the expected rotational oblateness, we conjecture the\npresence of a weak magnetic field on a star that does not have an extended\nconvective envelope. This calls to question the origin of the magnetic field.\n", "  The nucleation of crystals in liquids is one of nature's most ubiquitous\nphenomena, playing an important role in areas such as climate change and the\nproduction of drugs. As the early stages of nucleation involve exceedingly\nsmall time and length scales, atomistic computer simulations can provide unique\ninsight into the microscopic aspects of crystallization. In this review, we\ntake stock of the numerous molecular dynamics simulations that in the last few\ndecades have unraveled crucial aspects of crystal nucleation in liquids. We put\ninto context the theoretical framework of classical nucleation theory and the\nstate of the art computational methods, by reviewing simulations of e.g. ice\nnucleation or crystallization of molecules in solutions. We shall see that\nmolecular dynamics simulations have provided key insight into diverse\nnucleation scenarios, ranging from colloidal particles to natural gas hydrates,\nand that in doing so the general applicability of classical nucleation theory\nhas been repeatedly called into question. We have attempted to identify the\nmost pressing open questions in the field. We believe that by improving (i.)\nexisting interatomic potentials; and (ii.) currently available enhanced\nsampling methods, the community can move towards accurate investigations of\nrealistic systems of practical interest, thus bringing simulations a step\ncloser to experiments.\n", "  We experimentally demonstrate ultrathin flat lenses with a thickness of 7\n{\\AA}, which corresponds to the fundamental physical limit of the thickness of\nthe material, is fabricated in a large area, monolayer, CVD-prepared tungsten\nchalcogenides single crystals using the low-cost flexible laser writing method.\nThe lenses apply the ultra-high refractive index to introduce abrupt amplitude\nmodulation of the incident light to achieve three-dimensional (3D) focusing\ndiffraction-limited resolution (0.5{\\lambda}) and a focusing efficiency as high\nas 31%. An analytical physical model based diffraction theory is derived to\nsimulate the focusing process, which shows excellent agreement with the\nexperimental results.\n", "  Monolayer MoS2, MoSe2, MoTe2, WS2, WSe2, and black phosphorous field effect\ntransistors (FETs) operating in the low-voltage (LV) regime (0.3V) with\ngeometries from the 2019 and 2028 nodes of the 2013 International Technology\nRoadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) are benchmarked along with an ultra-thin-body\nSi FET. Current can increase or decrease with scaling, and the trend is\nstrongly correlated with the effective mass. For LV operation at the 2028 node,\nan effective mass of ~0.4 m0, corresponding to that of WSe2, gives the maximum\ndrive current. The short 6 nm gate length combined with LV operation is\nforgiving in its requirements for material quality and contact resistances. In\nthis LV regime, device and circuit performance are competitive using currently\nmeasured values for mobilities and contact resistances for the monolayer\ntwo-dimensional materials.\n", "  We investigate the antiferromagnetic insulating state of the recently\ndiscovered double perovskites Sr$_2$XOsO$_6$ (X$=$Sc, Mg) by using ab-initio\ncalculations (based on Density Functional Theory and Dynamical Mean-Field\nTheory) to elucidate the interplay between electronic correlations and\nspin-orbit coupling. The structural details of Sr$_2$XOsO$_6$ (X$=$Sc, Mg)\ninduce band narrowing effects which enhance local electronic correlations. The\nhalf-filled $5d^3$ orbitals of Os in Sr$_2$ScOsO$_6$ fall into a magnetically\nordered correlated regime, which is slightly affected and reduced by the\nspin-orbit coupling. The electronic configuration $5d^2$ of Os in\nSr$_2$MgOsO$_6$ responses differently to electronic correlations promoting a\nless localized state than Sr$_2$ScOsO$_6$ at the same strength of electronic\ninteractions. We find that the inclusion of spin-orbit coupling drives\nSr$_2$MgOsO$_6$ toward insulating behaviour and promotes a large tendency in\nformation of orbital magnetization antiparallel to the spin moment. The\nformation of the AFM state is linked to the evidence of correlated Hubbard\nbands in the paramagnetic solution of Sr$_2$XOsO$_6$ (X$=$Sc, Mg).\n", "  Nature of photon trajectories in a curved spacetime around black holes are\nstudied without constraining their motion to any plane. Impacts of photon\nbending are separately scrutinized for Keplerian and CENBOL components of Two\nComponent Advective Flow (TCAF) model. Parameters like Red shift, Bolometric\nFlux, temperature profile and time of arrival of photons are also computed.\n", "  Coagulation-fragmentation processes describe the stochastic association and\ndissociation of particles in clusters. Cluster dynamics with cluster-cluster\ninteractions for a finite number of particles has recently attracted attention\nespecially in stochastic analysis and statistical physics of cellular biology,\nas novel experimental data is now available, but their interpretation remains\nchallenging.} We derive here probability distribution functions for clusters\nthat can either aggregate upon binding to form clusters of arbitrary sizes or a\nsingle cluster can dissociate into two sub-clusters. Using combinatorics\nproperties and Markov chain representation, we compute steady-state\ndistributions and moments for the number of particles per cluster in the case\nwhere the coagulation and fragmentation rates follow a detailed balance\ncondition. We obtain explicit and asymptotic formulas for the cluster size and\nthe number of clusters in terms of hypergeometric functions. To further\ncharacterize clustering, we introduce and discuss two mean times: one is time\ntwo particles spend together before they separate and other is the time they\nspend separated before they meet again for the first time. Finally we discuss\napplications of the present stochastic coagulation-fragmentation framework in\ncell biology.\n", "  We refine our dynamical Schroedinger-Langevin scheme designed for dealing\nwith the suppression of quarkonium states in URHIC in order to allow for\nfeed-downs from higher states and present updated results for the $R_{AA}$ as a\nfunction of the centrality.\n", "  Size-dependent quantization of energy spectrum of conducting electrons in\nsolids leads to oscillating dependence of electronic properties on\ncorresponding dimension(s). In conventional metals with typical energy Fermi\nEF~1 eV and the charge carrier's effective masses m* of the order of free\nelectron mass m0, the quantum size phenomena provide noticeable impact only at\nnanometer scales. Here we experimentally demonstrate that in single-crystalline\nsemimetal bismuth nanostructures the electronic conductivity non-monotonously\ndecreases with reduction of the effective diameter. In samples grown along the\nparticular crystallographic orientation the electronic conductivity abruptly\nincreases at scales of about 50 nm due to metal-to-insulator transition\nmediated by the quantum confinement effect. The experimental findings are in\nreasonable agreement with theory predictions. The quantum-size phenomena should\nbe taken into consideration to optimize operation of the next generation of\nultra-small quantum nanoelectronic circuits.\n", "  We report on the hydrogen sorption investigation of the mixed alkali cluster\nintercalated fulleride series NaxLi6-xC60. These compounds are isostructural to\nNa6C60 and Li6C60 while the cubic lattice parameter is linearly dependent on x.\nThe H2 absorption/desorption was studied by means of charge/discharge kinetic\nand coupled calorimetric - manometric measurements. By varying the\nstoichiometry, we found the best compromise between absorption rate,\ntemperature and amount of hydrogen in Na1Li5C60. This system is able to\nreversibly absorb up to 4.3 wt% H2 at 280 {\\deg}C, which is 70 {\\deg}C lower in\ntemperature than its parent compound Li6C60. Furthermore, the kinetics is\nimproved of 67% with respect Li6C60 and the dehydrogenation enthalpy is 13\nkJ/mol H2 lower.\n", "  In dynamo power-based scaling laws, the power $P$ injected by buoyancy forces\nis measured by a so-called flux-based Rayleigh number, denoted as ${\\rm\nRa}_Q^*$ (see Christensen and Aubert, 2006). Whereas it is widely accepted that\nthis parameter is measured (as opposite to controlled) in dynamos driven by\ndifferential heating, the literature is much less clear concerning its nature\nin the case of imposed heat flux. We clarify this issue by highlighting that in\nthat case, the ${\\rm Ra}_{Q}^*$ parameter becomes controlled only in the limit\nof large Nusselt numbers (${\\rm Nu} \\gg 1$).\n  We then address the issue of the robustness of the original relation between\n$P$ and ${\\rm Ra}_Q^*$ with the geometry and the thermal boundary conditions.\nWe show that in the cartesian geometry, as in the spherical geometry with a\ncentral mass distribution, this relation is purely linear, in both differential\nand fixed-flux heating. However, we show that in the geometry commonly studied\nby geophysicists (spherical with uniform mass distribution), its validity\nplaces an upper-bound on the strength of the driving which can be envisaged in\na fixed Ekman number simulation. An increase of the Rayleigh number indeed\nyields deviations (in terms of absolute correction) from the linear relation\nbetween $P$ and ${\\rm Ra}_Q^*$. We conclude that in such configurations, the\nparameter range for which $P$ is controlled is limited.\n", "  The concept of a screening mass is a powerful tool to simplify the intricate\nphysics of in-medium test charges surrounded by light charge carriers. While it\nhas been successfully used to describe electromagnetic properties, its\ndefinition and computation in QCD is plagued by questions of gauge invariance\nand the presence of non-perturbative contributions from the magnetic sector.\nHere we present a recent alternative definition of a gauge invariant Debye mass\nparameter following closely the original idea of Debye and Hueckel. Our test\ncharges are a static heavy quark-antiquark pair whose complex potential and its\nin-medium modification can be extracted using lattice QCD. By combining in a\ngeneralized Gauss-Law the non-perturbative aspects of quark binding with a\nperturbative ansatz for the medium effects, we succeed to describe the lattice\nvalues of the potential with a single temperature dependent parameter, in turn\nidentified with a Debye mass. We find that its behavior, as evaluated in a\nrecent quenched lattice QCD study, deviates from that in other approaches, such\nas hard-thermal-loop perturbation theory or from electric field correlators on\nthe lattice. In particular around the phase transition its values tend to zero\nsignificantly faster than at weak-coupling.\n", "  The bound states of a heavy quark and antiquark ($c\\bar{c}, b\\bar{b}$) are\nideal probes to explore the quark-gluon plasma created in relativistic\nheavy-ion collisions at the RHIC and LHC. Not only have they become\nexperimentally accessible with high precision but also efficient tools, so\ncalled effective field theories (EFT) have been developed to treat them\ntheoretically. Here we present recent progress in understanding the in-medium\nbehavior of heavy-quarkonium with the help of EFT's combined with\nnon-perturbative and first principles simulations in lattice QCD. In particular\nwe discuss computations of heavy quarkonium spectral functions with the help of\nBayesian unfolding methods and the physics we can extract from them.\nLimitations and the underlying assumptions of the used approaches are pointed\nout.\n", "  An overview of the most recent measurements of inclusive top quark pair\nproduction cross section is presented. The results are obtained using data\ncollected with the CMS experiment in proton-proton collisions at centre-of-mass\nenergies of 5.02, 7, 8 and 13 TeV. The data are compared with the predictions\nfrom perturbative QCD calculations at full NNLO+NNLL accuracy.\n", "  We investigate the soft mode at the QCD critical point (CP) on the basis of\nthe functional renormalization group. We calculate the spectral functions in\nthe meson channels in the two-flavor quark--meson model. Our result shows that\nthe energy of the peak position of the particle--hole mode in the sigma channel\nbecomes vanishingly small as the system approaches the QCD CP, which is a\nmanifestation of the softening of the phonon mode. We also extract the\ndispersion curves of the mesonic and the phonon mode, a hydrodynamic mode which\nleads to a finding that the dispersion curve of the sigma-mesonic mode crosses\nthe light-cone into the space-like momentum region, and then eventually merges\ninto the phonon mode as the system approaches further close to the CP. This may\nsuggest that the sigma-mesonic mode forms the soft mode together with the\nhydrodynamic mode at the CP.\n", "  We study possible applications of high critical temperature nodal\nsuperconductors for the search for Majorana bound states in the DIII class. We\npropose a microscopic analysis of the proximity effect induced by d-wave\nsuperconductors on a semiconductor wire with strong spin-orbit coupling. We\ncharacterize the induced superconductivity on the wire employing a numerical\nself-consistent tight-binding Bogoliubov-de Gennes approach, and analytical\nconsiderations on the Green's function. The order parameter induced on the\nwire, the pair correlation function, and the renormalization of the Fermi\npoints are analyzed in detail, as well as the topological phase diagram in the\ncase of weak coupling. We highlight optimal Hamiltonian parameters to access\nthe nontrivial topological phase which could display time-reversal invariant\nMajorana doublets at the boundaries of the wire.\n", "  In this paper, we study the behavior of the eigenvalues of the one and two\ndimensions of q-deformed Dirac oscillator. The eigensolutions have been\nobtained by using a method based on the q-deformed creation and annihilation\noperators in both dimensions. For a two-dimensional case, we have used the\ncomplex formalism which reduced the problem to the problem of one dimensional\ncase. The influence of the q-numbers on the eigenvalues has been well analyzed.\nAlso, the connection between the q-oscillator and a quantum optics is well\nestablished. Finally, for very small deformation \\eta, we have mentioned to\nexistence of well-known q-deformed version of Zitterbewegung in relativistic\nquantum dynamics, and calculated the partition function and all thermal\nquantities such as the free energy, total energy, entropy and specific heat:\nhere we consider only the case of a pure phase (q=e^{i\\eta}). The extension to\nthe case of graphene has been discussed\n", "  Tunable orbit angular momentum (OAM) of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) is\ntheoretically studied with appropriately designed metasurfaces. By controlling\nboth the orientation angle and spatial position of nano aperture array on an\nultrathin gold film, the field distributions of the surface waves can be\nengineered to contain both spin dependent and independent OAM components.\nSimultaneous control over the geometric phase and optical path difference\ninduced phase (dynamic phase) provides extra degrees of freedom for\nmanipulating OAM of SPPs. We show that arbitrary combination of OAM numbers can\nbe realized for the SPPs excited by incident light of different circular\npolarizations. The results provides powerful control over the OAM of SPPs,\nwhich will have potential applications on optical trapping, imaging,\ncommunications and quantum information processing.\n", "  The grain boundary (GB) energy is a quantity of fundamental importance for\nunderstanding several key properties of graphene. Here we present a\ncomprehensive theoretical and numerical study of the entire space of symmetric\nand asymmetric graphene GBs. We have simulated over 79,000 graphene GBs to\nexplore the configuration space of GBs in graphene. We use a generalized\nRead-Shockley theory and the Frank-Bilby relation to develop analytical\nexpressions for the GB energy as a function of the misorientation angle and the\nline angle, and elucidate the salient structural features of the low energy GB\nconfigurations.\n", "  The equations for a self-similar solution of an inviscid incompressible fluid\nare mapped into an integral equation which hopefully can be solved by\niteration. It is argued that the exponent of the similarity are ruled by\nKelvin's theorem of conservation of circulation. The end result is an iteration\nwith a nonlinear term entering in a kernel given by a 3D integral (in general\n3D flow) or 2D (for swirling flows), which seems to be within reach of present\nday computational power. Because of the slow decay of the similarity solution\nat large distances the total energy is diverging and recent mathematical\nresults excluding a solution of the self-similar solution of Euler equation do\nnot apply.\n", "  We demonstrate the lattice QCD calculation of the long distance contribution\nto $\\epsilon_K$. Due to the singular, short-distance structure of $\\epsilon_K$,\nwe must perform a short-distance subtraction and introduce a corresponding\nlow-energy constant determined from perturbation theory, which we calculate at\nNext Leading Order (NLO). We perform the calculation on a $24^3 \\times 64$\nlattice with a pion mass of 329 MeV. This work is a complete calculation, which\nincludes all connected and disconnected diagrams.\n", "  In this work a new non-minimally coupled model is presented, where a generic\nfunction $f(R)$ of the scalar curvature factors the usual Einstein-Hilbert\naction functional, motivated by relevant results obtained from similar models.\nIts cosmological dynamics are derived and the possibility of attaining a phase\nof accelerated expansion is assessed. To further probe the possible\nimplications of the model, a dynamical system formulation is established, and\nused to assess the scenarios where $f(R)$ assumes a power-law or exponential\nform.\n", "  In this work we discuss in detail the known solutions of the stationary\nSchr\\\"odinger equation subject to a deformable hyperbolic tangent potential\nexactly soluble $ V(x) = \\frac {V_0} {2} (1+ \\tanh (\\delta x)) $. We find the\nanalytical solutions in terms of Gauss hypergeometric functions for the\nscattering states with energy greater than the maximum value of the potential.\nWe also discussed the case for the energy lower than the maximum and the\nsimilarities and differences with the abrupt step potential in both cases. We\ngraphically illustrate the relevant physical situations to the problem.\n", "  Laser-driven collisonless electrostatic shock formation and the subsequent\nion acceleration have been studied in near critical density plasmas.\nParticle-in-cell simulations show that both the speed of laser-driven\ncollisionless electrostatic shock and the energies of shock-accelerated ions\ncan be greatly enhanced due to fast laser propagation in near critical density\nplasmas. However, a response time longer than tens of laser wave cycles is\nrequired before the shock formation in a near critical density plasma, in\ncontrast to the quick shock formation in a highly overdense target. More\nimportant, we find that some ions can be reflected by the collisionless shock\neven if the electrostatic potential jump across the shock is smaller than the\nion kinetic energy in the shock frame, which seems against the conventional\nion-reflection condition. These anomalous ion reflections are attributed to the\nstrongly time-oscillating electric field accompanying laser-driven\ncollisionless shock in a near critical density plasma.\n", "  We study the Minimal R-symmetric Supersymmetric Standard Model (MRSSM) at the\nquantum level. The thesis consists of two parts. First one treats about the\nelectroweak sector of the model. Among others, it identifies the parameter\nregion allowed by the electroweak precision observables. Since the MRSSM\ncontains an $SU(2)_L$-triplet with a non-zero vacuum expectation value the\nemphasis is put on the calculation of the $W$ boson mass. To that end, a full\none-loop calculation of $m_W$ augmented with the leading two-loop SM result is\npresented. The region is then checked against the measurement of the Higgs\nboson mass. For this, the full one-loop and leading two-loop corrections to the\nHiggs boson mass in the MRSSM are calculated. Devised benchmark points,\nconsistent with both of these observables, are shown to fulfill also a number\nof additional experimental constraints like properties of the Higgs boson(s),\n$b$-physics observables and vacuum stability. Correlating all of these\nobservables allows to put bounds on the parameters of the model. Second part of\nthe thesis treats about the strongly interacting scalar sector. First, NLO QCD\ncorrections to the production of scalar gluon (sgluon) pair at the LHC are\ncalculated. A set of $K$-factors for a selected sgluon masses at 13 and 14 TeV\nLHC is presented. This calculation is applied to constrain the sgluon mass\nusing 2015 data set from Run 2 of the LHC. To that end, a same-sign lepton\nsearch by ATLAS is recasted for the case of the production of the sgluon pair\ndecaying to $t\\bar{t}$ pairs. The analysis is reproduced with the help of\nshower Monte Carlo softwares and the program performing a fast detector\nresponse simulation. The analysis shows that already using 3.2/fb of integrated\nluminosity the exclusion limits from Run 2 are competitive with the 8 TeV ones.\n", "  In this paper, we announce results from our thesis, which studies for the\nfirst time the categorification of the theory of generalized permutohedra. The\nvector spaces in the categorification are tightly constrained by certain\ncontinuity relations which appeared in physics in the mid 20th century. We\ndescribe here the action of the symmetric group on the vector spaces in this\ncategorification. Generalized permutohedra are replaced by vector spaces of\ncharacteristic functions of polyhedral cones about faces of permutohedra,\ncalled plates, due to A. Ocneanu. The symmetric group acts on plates by\ncoordinate permutation.\n  In combinatorics, the Eulerian numbers count the number of permutations with\na given number of ascent and descents. The classical Worpitzky identity expands\na power $r^p$ as a sum of Eulerian numbers, with binomial coefficients. In our\nthesis, for the main result we generalize the classical Worpitzky identity to\nan isomorphism of symmetric group modules, corresponding geometrically to the\ntiling of a scaled simplex by unit hypersimplices. In the categorification, the\nvolume of a hypersimplex is replaced by the complex-linear dimension of a\nvector space associated to it. The main technical aspect of the proof of the\ncharacter formula for the simplex involves a partition of unity of a\ncommutative algebra of translations on a discrete torus, and a certain modular\nDiophantine equation.\n  A detailed paper is in preparation.\n", "  We report the first observation of the polarization of\n$\\Lambda/\\bar{\\Lambda}$ hyperons transverse to its production plane in $e^+e^-$\nannihilation. We observe a significant polarization that rises with the\nfractional energy carried by the hyperon as well as its transverse momentum. To\ndefine the production plane, we use the direction of the hyperon momentum\ntogether with either the thrust axis in the event or the momentum vector of a\nhadron in the opposite hemisphere. Furthermore, we investigate the\ncontributions to the hyperon polarization from the feed-down from\n$\\Sigma^0/\\bar{\\Sigma}^0$ and $\\Lambda_c^{\\pm}$ decays. This measurement uses a\ndataset of 800.4\\~fb$^{-1}$ collected by the Belle experiment at or near a\ncenter-of-mass energy of 10.58 GeV.\n", "  Recent ALMA observations of high-redshift normal galaxies have been providing\na great opportunity to clarify the general origin of dust in the Universe, not\nbiased to very bright special objects even at $z>6$. To clarify what constraint\nwe can get for the dust enrichment in normal galaxies detected by ALMA, we use\na theoretical model that includes major processes driving dust evolution in a\ngalaxy; that is, dust condensation in stellar ejecta, dust growth by the\naccretion of gas-phase metals, and supernova destruction. Using the dust\nemission fluxes detected in two normal galaxies at $z>6$ by ALMA as a\nconstraint, we can get the range of the time-scales (or efficiencies) of the\nabove mentioned processes. We find that if we assume extremely high\ncondensation efficiency in stellar ejecta ($f_{\\mathrm{in}} \\ga 0.5$), rapid\ndust enrichment by stellar sources in the early phase may be enough to explain\nthe observed ALMA flux, unless dust destruction by supernovae in those galaxies\nis stronger than that in nearby galaxies. If we assume a condensation\nefficiency expected from theoretical calculations ($f_{\\mathrm{in}} \\la 0.1$),\nstrong dust growth (even stronger than assumed for nearby galaxies if they are\nmetal-poor galaxies) is required. These results indicate that the normal\ngalaxies detected by ALMA at $z>6$ are biased to objects (i) with high dust\ncondensation efficiency in stellar ejecta, (ii) with strong dust growth in very\ndense molecular clouds, or (iii) with efficient dust growth because of fast\nmetal enrichment up to solar metallicity. A measurement of metallicity is\ncrucial to distinguish among these possibilities.\n", "  The highly successful Dirac equation can predict peculiar effects such as\nKlein tunneling and the \"Zitterbewegung\" (German for \"trembling motion\") of\nelectrons. From the time it was first identified by Erwin Schrodinger,\nZitterbewegung (ZB) has been considered a key to understanding relativistic\nquantum mechanics. However, observing the original ZB of electrons is too\ndifficult, and instead various emulations using entity models have been\nproposed, producing several successes. Expectations are high regarding charge\ntransports in semiconductors and graphene; however, very few reports have\nappeared on them. Here, we report that ZB has a surprisingly large effect on\ncharge transports when we play \"flat pinball\" with such trembling electrons in\na semiconductor nanostructure. The stage here is a narrow strip of InAs\ntwo-dimensional electron gas with a strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Six\nquantum point contacts (QPCs) are attached to the strip as pinball pockets. The\nZB appeared as a large reproducible conductance fluctuation versus in-plane\nmagnetic fields in the transport between two QPCs. Numerical simulations\nsuccessfully reproduced our experimental observations, certifying that ZB\ncauses a new type of conductance fluctuation.\n", "  We review the role of self-consistency in density functional theory. We apply\na recent analysis to both Kohn-Sham and orbital-free DFT, as well as to\nPartition-DFT, which generalizes all aspects of standard DFT. In each case, the\nanalysis distinguishes between errors in approximate functionals versus errors\nin the self-consistent density. This yields insights into the origins of many\nerrors in DFT calculations, especially those often attributed to\nself-interaction or delocalization error. In many classes of problems, errors\ncan be substantially reduced by using `better' densities. We review the history\nof these approaches, many of their applications, and give simple pedagogical\nexamples.\n", "  We investigate the energy spectrum and the corresponding eigenfunctions of a\n2D Dirac oscillator confined by an antidot potential in the presence of a\nmagnetic field and Aharonov-Bohm flux field. Analytical solutions are obtained\nand compared with the results of the Schr\\\"odinger equation found in the\nliterature. Further, the dependence of the spectrum on the magnetic quantum\nnumber and on the repulsive potential is discussed.\n", "  We first review the method to calculate the spectral functions in the\nfunctional renormalization group (FRG) approach, which has been recently\ndeveloped. We also provide the numerical stability conditions given by the\npresent authors for a generic nonlinear evolution equation that are necessary\nfor obtaining the accurate effective potential from the flow equation in the\nFRG. As an interesting example, we report the recent calculation of the\nspectral functions of the mesonic and particle-hole excitations using a chiral\neffective model of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD); we extract the dispersion\nrelations from them and try to reveal the nature of the soft modes at the QCD\ncritical point (CP) where the phase transition is second order. Our result\nshows that a clear development and the softening of the phonon mode in the\nspace-like region as the system approaches the CP; furthermore it turns out\nthat the sigma mesonic mode once in the time-like region gets to merge with the\nphonon mode in the close vicinity of the CP, implying a novel possibility about\nthe nature of the soft mode of the QCD CP.\n", "  Numerical study of the hydrodynamics of thin sheets and ribbons presents\ndifficulties associated with resolving multiple length scales. To circumvent\nthese difficulties, asymptotic methods have been developed to describe the\ndynamics of slender fibres and ribbons. However, such theories entail\nrestrictions on the shapes that can be studied, and often break down in regions\nwhere standard boundary element methods are still impractical. In this paper we\ndevelop a regularised stokeslet method for ribbons and sheets in order to\nbridge the gap between asymptotic and boundary element methods. The method is\nvalidated against the analytical solution for plate ellipsoids, as well as the\ndynamics of ribbon helices and an experimental microswimmer. We then\ndemonstrate the versatility of this method by calculating the flow around a\ndouble helix, and the swimming dynamics of a microscale \"magic carpet\".\n", "  With regard to generic two-component systems, the theory of first variations\nof global quantities is reviewed and explicit expressions are inferred for\nsubsystem potential energies and potential-energy tensors. Performing a\nconceptual experiment, a physical interpretation of subsystem potential\nenergies and potential-energy tensors is discussed. Subsystem tidal radii are\ndefined by requiring an unbound component in absence of the other one. To this\nrespect, a few guidance examples are presented as: (i) an embedding and an\nembedded homogeneous sphere; (ii) an embedding and an embedded truncated,\nsingular isothermal sphere where related centres are sufficiently distant;\n(iii) a homogeneous sphere and a Roche system i.e. a mass point surrounded by a\nvanishing atmosphere. The results are discussed and compared with the findings\nof earlier investigations.\n", "  Is wave function collapse a prediction of the Schr\\\"odinger equation? This\nunusual problem is explored in an enlarged framework of interpretation, where\nquantum dynamics is considered exact and its interpretation is extended to\ninclude local entanglement of two systems, including a macroscopic one. This\nproperty of local entanglement, which results directly from the Schr\\\"odinger\nequation but is unrelated with observables, is measured by local probabilities,\nfundamentally distinct from quantum probabilities and evolving nonlinearly.\nWhen applied to a macroscopic system and the fluctuations in its environment,\nlocal entanglement can also inject a formerly ignored species of incoherence\ninto the quantum state of this system,. When applied to a quantum measurement,\nthe conjunction of these two effects suggests a self-consistent mechanism of\ncollapse, which would directly derive from the Schr\\\"odinger equation. (This\nwork develops and improves significantly a previously circulated version with\nthe same title [23])\n", "  We present a method to probe real-time dynamics in quantum mesoscopic systems\nusing Ramsey interferometry. This allows us to explore the effect of\ninteractions on quasi-particles in the time domain. We investigate the\ndephasing effects of an ohmic environment on an electron-hole pair in a tunnel\njunction. We show that dynamical Coulomb blockade phenomena can be observed for\nresistances much smaller than the quantum of resistance. Moreover, the\ncrossover between high and low impedance limits can be probed for a constant\nresistance by a proper control of the voltage modulation.\n", "  Selected recent contributions involving fluctuating velocity fields to the\nrapidly developing domain of stochastic field theory are reviewed. Functional\nrepresentations for solutions of stochastic differential equations and master\nequations are worked out in detail with an em- phasis on multiplicative noise\nand the inherent ambiguity of the functional method. Application to stochastic\nmodels of isotropic turbulence of multi-parameter expansions in regulators of\ndimensional and analytic renormalization is surveyed. Effects of the choice of\nthe renormalization scheme are investigated. Special attention is paid to the\nrole and properties of the minimal subtraction scheme. Analysis of the\nconsequences of symmetry breaking of isotropic turbulence with the use of the\nrenormalization-group method is demonstrated by the effects due to helicity,\nstrong and weak anisotropy. A careful description is given of the influence of\nturbulent advection on paradigmatic reaction-diffusion problems.\n", "  Biomolecules are complex systems stabilized by a delicate balance of weak\ninteractions, making it important to assess all energetic contributions in an\naccurate manner. However, it is a priori unclear which contributions make more\nof an impact. Here, we examine stacked polyglutamine (polyQ) strands, a peptide\nrepeat often found in amyloid aggregates. We investigate the role of hydrogen\nbond (HB) cooperativity, van der Waals (vdW) dispersion interactions, and\nquantum contributions to free energies, including anharmonicities through\ndensity functional theory and ab initio path integral simulations. Of these\nvarious factors, we find that the largest impact on structural stabilization\ncomes from vdW interactions. HB cooperativity is the second largest\ncontribution as the size of the stacked chain grows. Competing nuclear quantum\neffects make the net quantum contribution small but very sensitive to\nanharmonicities, vdW, and the number of HBs. Our results suggest that a\nreliable treatment of these systems can only be attained by considering all of\nthese components.\n", "  The temperature of the working environment is a key factor in determining the\nproperties of semiconductor detectors, and it affects the absolute accuracy and\nstability of the standard detector. In order to determine the temperature\ncoefficient of CdTe detector used for X-rays detection, a precise temperature\ncontrol system was designed. In this experiment, detectors and radiographic\nsource were set inside the thermostat with temperature of 0-40 Celsius degree,\nso that the temperature can be regulated for the test of the temperature\ncoefficient of CdTe detector. Studies had shown that, with the increase of the\ntemperature, the energy resolution and detection efficiency of the CdTe\ndetector would deteriorate, and under 10 Celsius degree the detectors have\nbetter performance with the 8 keV X-rays.\n", "  This proceeding summarises a talk given on the state-of-the-art of debris\ndisc modelling. We first review the basics of debris disc physics, which is\nfollowed by a short overview of the state-of-the-art in terms of modelling dust\nand gas in debris disc systems.\n", "  We revisit the $t154$ variant of the Biroli-Mezard lattice glass,\ncomplementing previous studies by studying statics and dynamics under periodic\nboundary conditions as well as systems confined in cavities with amorphous\nboundaries. We compute the point-to-se correlation and relaxation times under\nthe different boundary conditions. Results point to a scenario with dynamics\nruled by structural correlations.\n", "  In this contribution we investigate the phase diagram of QCD in the presence\nof an isospin chemical potential. To alleviate the infrared problems of the\ntheory associated with pion condensation, we introduce the pionic source as an\ninfrared regulator. We discuss various methods to extrapolate the results to\nvanishing pionic source, including a novel method based on the singular value\nspectrum of the massive Dirac operator, a leading-order reweighting and a\nspline Monte-Carlo fit. Our main results concern the phase transition boundary\nbetween the normal and the pion condensation phases and the\nchiral/deconfinement transition temperature as a function of the chemical\npotential. In addition, we perform a quantitative comparison between our direct\nresults and a Taylor-expansion obtained at zero chemical potential to assess\nthe applicability range of the latter.\n", "  Universal extra dimension models with Kaluza-Klein parity provide us\nexcellent candidates for dark matter. We consider phenomenological universal\nextra dimension models where the Kaluza-Klein (KK) mass spectrum is different\nfrom that of the minimal universal extra dimension model, and compute the\nthermal relic abundance of the first KK mode of the photon taking into account\nthe production of second KK particles. It is pointed out that its thermal relic\nabundance depends significantly on the mass degeneracy between the KK-photon\nand other KK particles because of considerable coannihilation effects. The\ncosmologically favored compactification scale is shown to range from around 1\nTeV to a few TeV even in the cases where one of the first KK particles is\ntightly degenerate with the first KK photon in mass.\n", "  In this work, a new type of high through-put Czerny-Turner spectrometer has\nbeen developed which allows to acquire multiple channels simultaneously with a\nrepetition time on the order of \\SI{10}{\\us} at different wavelengths. The\nspectrometer has been coupled to the edge charge exchange recombination system\nat ASDEX Upgrade which has been recently refurbished with new lines of sight.\nConstruction features, calibration methods, and initial measurements obtained\nwith the new setup will be presented.\n", "  We investigate the low-energy phase excitations of the quasi-one-dimensional\ncharge density wave (CDW) in $\\mathrm{K}_{0.3}\\mathrm{Mo}\\mathrm{O}_3$, by\ndirect probing of infrared-active CDW-lattice modes (phase-phonons) with\nultrafast terahertz spectroscopy. Both the nonequilibrium response and\ntemperature dependence of the bands are reconciled by generalizing the\ntime-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory, beyond that previously applied to the\namplitude-phonons, to include impurity effects, while the photoinduced\nblue-shifts are attributed to a reduction of the electron-phonon coupling\ninduced by a long-lived free-carrier population.\n", "  An analysis is presented of events containing jets including at least one\n$b$-tagged jet, sizable missing transverse momentum, and at least two charged\nleptons including a pair of the same electric charge, with the scalar sum of\nthe jet and lepton transverse momenta being large. Standard Model processes\nrarely produce these final states, but several models of physics beyond the\nStandard Model predict an enhanced production rate of such events. Specific\nmodels with this feature are considered here: vector-like $T$, $B$, and\n$T_{5/3}$ quark pair production, and four top quark production under three\nscenarios (Standard Model, contact interaction, and extra-dimensions). A data\nsample of 3.2 fb$^{-1}$ of $pp$ collisions at a center-of-mass energy of\n$\\sqrt{s}$=13 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider\nis used in this analysis. Several signal regions are defined, in which the\nconsistency between the data yield and the background-only hypothesis is\nchecked, and 95% confidence level limits are set on various signal models. The\nfocus here is on models yielding signatures with four top quarks.\n", "  Interaction between the solar wind and the Earth's magnetosphere is\nassociated with large-scale currents in the ionosphere at polar latitudes that\nflow along magnetic field lines (Birkeland currents) and horizontally. These\ncurrent systems are tightly linked, but their global behaviors are rarely\nanalyzed together. In this paper, we present estimates of the average global\nBirkeland currents and horizontal ionospheric currents from the same set of\nmagnetic field measurements. The magnetic field measurements, from the low\nEarth orbiting $\\textit{Swarm}$ and CHAMP satellites, are used to co-estimate\npoloidal and toroidal parts of the magnetic disturbance field, represented in\nmagnetic apex coordinates. The use of apex coordinates reduces effects of\nlongitudinal and hemispheric variations in the Earth's main field. We present\nglobal currents from both hemispheres during different sunlight conditions. The\nresults show that the Birkeland currents vary with the conductivity, which\ndepends most strongly on solar EUV emissions on the dayside and on particle\nprecipitation at pre-midnight magnetic local times. In sunlight, the horizontal\nequivalent current flows in two cells, resembling an opposite ionospheric\nconvection pattern, which implies that it is dominated by Hall currents. By\ncombining the Birkeland current maps and the equivalent current, we are able to\ncalculate the total horizontal current, without any assumptions about the\nconductivity. We show that the total horizontal current is close to zero in the\npolar cap when it is dark. That implies that the equivalent current, which is\nsensed by ground magnetometers, is largely canceled by the horizontal closure\nof the Birkeland currents.\n", "  Half-life values are widely used in nuclear chemistry to model the\nexponential decay of the quantified radionuclides. The analysis of existing\ndata reveals a general lack of information on the performed experiments and an\nalmost complete absence of uncertainty budgets. This is the situation for 31Si,\nthe radionuclide produced via neutron capture reaction recently used to\nquantify trace amounts of 30Si in a sample of the silicon material highly\nenriched in 28Si and used for the determination of the Avogadro constant. In\norder to improve the quality of the now recommended 157.36(26) min value, we\ncarried out repeated observations of the 31Si decay rate via gamma-ray\nspectrometry measurements. This paper reports the result we obtained, including\ndetails of the experiment and the evaluation of the uncertainty.\n", "  The solar-wind magnetosphere interaction primarily occurs at altitudes where\nthe dipole component of Earth's magnetic field is dominating. The disturbances\nthat are created in this interaction propagate along magnetic field lines and\ninteract with the ionosphere-thermosphere system. At ionospheric altitudes, the\nEarth's field deviates significantly from a dipole. North-South asymmetries in\nthe magnetic field imply that the magnetosphere ionosphere-thermosphere (M-I-T)\ncoupling is different in the two hemispheres. In this paper we review the\nprimary differences in the magnetic field at polar latitudes, and the\nconsequences that these have for the M-I-T coupling. We focus on two\ninterhemispheric differences which are thought to have the strongest effects:\n1) A difference in the offset between magnetic and geographic poles in the\nNorthern and Southern Hemispheres, and 2) differences in the magnetic field\nstrength at magnetically conjugate regions. These asymmetries lead to\ndifferences in plasma convection, neutral winds, total electron content, ion\noutflow, ionospheric currents and auroral precipitation.\n", "  Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a difficult-to-treat\ninfection that only in the European Union affects about 150,000 patients and\ncauses extra costs of 380 million Euros annually to the health-care systems.\nIncreasing efforts have been taken to mitigate the epidemics and to avoid\npotential outbreaks in low endemic settings. Understanding the population\ndynamics of MRSA through modeling is essential to identify the causal\nmechanisms driving the epidemics and to generalize conclusions to different\ncontexts. We develop an innovative high-resolution spatiotemporal contact\nnetwork model of interactions between patients to reproduce the hospital\npopulation in the context of the Stockholm County in Sweden and simulate the\nspread of MRSA within this population. Our model captures the spatial and\ntemporal heterogeneity caused by human behavior and by the dynamics of mobility\nwithin wards and hospitals. We estimate that in this population the epidemic\nthreshold is at about 0.008. We also identify that these heterogeneous contact\npatterns cause the emergence of super-spreader patients and a polynomial growth\nof the epidemic curve. We finally study the effect of standard intervention\ncontrol strategies and identify that screening is more effective than improved\nhygienic in order to cause smaller or null outbreaks.\n", "  Observational manifestations of far evolved stars at the asymptotic giants\nbranch and their nearest descendants are briefly considered. Main results of\ntheir chemical composition determinations based on long term high resolution\nspectroscopy at the 6-m telescope are also briefly summed up. A new kind of\npeculiarity of optical spectra is found and discussed: splitting or asymmetry\nof strongest absorptions in the optical spectra of selected post-AGB stars with\nenvelopes and atmospheres enriched in carbon and s-process heavy metals.\n", "  A novel approach for a delay line interferometer (DLI) based purely on\nforward Bragg scattering is proposed. We have numerically and experimentally\ndemonstrated that a Bragg grating can deliver the functionality of a DLI in its\ntransmission mode along a single common interfering optical path, instead of\nthe conventional DLI implementation with two interfering optical paths. As a\nproof of concept, a fiber Bragg grating has been designed and fabricated,\nshowing the desired functionality in the transmission mode of the Bragg\ngrating. The proposed \"Bragg-DLI\" approach is applicable to any kind of Bragg\ngrating technology, such as volume Bragg gratings, dielectric mirrors, silicon\nphotonics, and other optical waveguide based Bragg structures.\n", "  We present RBC/UKQCD's charm project using $N_f=2+1$ flavour ensembles with\ninverse lattice spacings in the range $1.73-2.77\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$ and two\nphysical pion mass ensembles. Domain wall fermions are used for the light as\nwell as the charm quarks. We discuss our strategy for the extraction of the\ndecay constants $f_D$ and $f_{D_s}$ and their extrapolation to the continuum\nlimit, physical pion masses and the physical heavy quark mass. Our preliminary\nresults are $f_D=208.7(2.8)\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$ and\n$f_{D_s}=246.4(1.9)\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$ where the quoted error is statistical only.\nWe outline our current approach to extend the reach in the heavy quark mass and\npresent preliminary results.\n", "  A common optical potential for $^4$He+$^{12}$C at intermediate bombarding\nenergies, which is essential in analyzing exotic nuclei with $^4$He clusters,\nwas obtained based on the S\\~{a}o Paulo potential (SPP). Among systematic\noptical potentials for $^4$He+$^{12}$C, this potential has the merit of using a\nfixed imaginary part of Woods-Saxon form. By optical-model calculations, this\npotential reproduced the experimental elastic scattering angular distributions\nof $^4$He+$^{12}$C well within the energy range of 26\\,$A$--60\\,$A$ MeV. It was\nalso applied successfully in calculations of the breakup reactions of\n$^6$Li+$^{12}$C and $^6$He+$^{12}$C with a three-body continuum discretized\ncoupled-channels method.\n", "  Doppler backscattering of optical laser photons on a \"flying mirror\" of\nrelativistic electrons promises to yield coherent photons with MeV-range\nenergies. We compare the nuclear interaction of such a laser pulse with the\nstandard atom-laser interaction. The mean-field description of atoms must be\nreplaced by a rate equation and the classical field strength, far too faint in\nnuclei, by the dipole transition rate. Significant nuclear excitation occurs\nfor photon numbers much smaller than typical for atoms. That drastically\nreduces the requirements on the experimental realization of a \"flying mirror\".\n", "  Using the continuous limit approximation in the dynamical system we study a\nnonlinear partial differential equation which corresponds to the generalization\nof both the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam and the Frenkel-Kontorova models. This generalized\nmodel can be considered as a model for the description nonlinear dislocation\nwaves in the crystal lattice. We obtain the nonlinear partial differential\nequation for the description of dislocations. Taking into account the wave\nmoving in one direction we obtain another nonlinear evolution equation. Using\nthe Painlev\\'e test we analyze the integrability of this equation. We find that\nthere exist an integrable case of the partial differential equation for\nnonlinear dislocations. The Lax pair for the solution of the Cauchy problem is\nfound. The solution of the Cauchy problem for nonlinear evolution equation is\ndiscussed. One and the two-soliton solutions for the nonlinear evolution\nequation are presented. The influence of parameters on the propagation of one\nand the two-soliton solutions is analyzed and demonstrated.\n", "  Ion beam irradiation of semiconductors is a method to produce regular\nperiodic nanoscale patterns self-organized on wafer scale. At low temperatures,\nthe surface of semiconductors is typically amorphized by the ion beam. Above a\nmaterial dependent dynamic recrystallization temperature however, the surface\nremains crystalline and ion beam irradiation produces regular arrays of faceted\nripples on III-V semiconductors. This provides a powerful single-step technique\nfor the production of nanostructures on a large area. On $(001)$ surfaces these\nripples are parallel to the $[1\\bar{1}0]$ direction without any external\nanisotropy. The origin of this self-alignment was not fully understood until\nnow. A simple experiment exposing the front side and back side of a GaAs$(001)$\nwafer to the ion beam clarifies its origin and proves that the ripples align to\nthe Ga dimer rows. As the direction of Ga dimer rows rotates by 90{\\deg} on the\nback side, the orientation of the ripples also rotates by 90{\\deg} to $[110]$.\nWe discuss the experimental results in view of a model where the pattern\nformation is driven by creation of vacancies and ad-atoms by the ion beam and\ntheir diffusion, which is linked to the direction of dimers on the surface.\n", "  We explore the structural, electronic, bonding, mechanical, thermodynamic and\nsuperconducting properties of two newly discovered isostructural bulk\nsuperconductors barium iridium phosphide BaIr2P2 (Tc ~ 2.1 K) and barium\niridium arsenide BaIr2As2 (Tc ~ 2.45 K). The optimized structural parameters of\nboth the compounds show good agreement with the experimentally evaluated\nvalues. The replacement of P by As mostly affects the c value, whereas a\nremains approximately the same. Metallic conductivity is observed for both the\nsuperconductors. The analysis of DOS, Mulliken atomic populations and total\ncharge density revel a complex bonding in BaIr2P2 and BaIr2As2 with ionic,\ncovalent and metallic characteristics. Mechanical and dynamical stability of\nboth the phases is confirmed by analyzing the elastic constant data.\n", "  It is known that an engine with ideal efficiency ($\\eta =1$ for a chemical\nengine and $e = e_{\\rm Carnot}$ for a thermal one) has zero power because a\nreversible cycle takes an infinite time. However, at least from a theoretical\npoint of view, it is possible to conceive (irreversible) engines with nonzero\npower that can reach ideal efficiency. Here this is achieved by replacing the\nusual linear transport law by a sublinear one and taking the step-function\nlimit for the particle current (chemical engine) or heat current (thermal\nengine) versus the applied force. It is shown that in taking this limit exact\nthermodynamic inequalities relating the currents to the entropy production are\nnot violated.\n", "  Collective spin ensembles known as skyrmion bubbles can exist in ultrathin\nmagnetic film heterostructures and promise miniscule diameters and low-power\nall-electrical manipulation. The nucleation, identification and manipulation of\nskyrmions is of great interest, in part, because of their non-trivial topology.\nHere we ascertain the topology of 100 nm isolated hedgehog skyrmion bubbles and\nprobe their response to external fields at room temperature in [ Pt \\ Co (0.8\nnm) \\ Ir ] films. We find that structural disorder can stabilize skyrmion\nbubble states which exhibit creep-like domain wall motion. This makes the\nextraction of DMI from observations difficult and could explain the larger than\npredicted bubble sizes observed in interfacial DMI films. Intriguingly, we\nreport on a critical size for hedgehog skyrmions, above which the bubbles lose\ncircular symmetry and take up an irregular shape. Combining Lorentz TEM and\nfully three dimensional multi-layered simulations, we demonstrate the unique\nbehavior of these topologically non-trivial spin textures.\n", "  The strongly interacting Bose gas is one of the most fundamental paradigms of\nquantum many-body physics and the subject of many experimental and theoretical\ninvestigations. We review recent progress on strongly correlated Bose gases,\nstarting with a description of beyond mean-field corrections. We show that the\nEfimov effect leads to non universal phenomena and to a metastability of the\nlow temperature Bose gas through three-body recombination to deeply bound\nmolecular states. We outline differences and similarities with ultracold Fermi\ngases, discuss recent experiments on the unitary Bose gas, and finally present\na few perspectives for future research.\n", "  Transverse momentum spectra of identified pions, Kaons , protons and Lambdas\nproduced at mid-rapidity (0 < ycm < 0.5) in p-Pb collisions at root(sNN) = 5.02\nTeV is studied for different collision centralities by using a Unified\nStatistical Thermal Freeze-out Model (USTFM). A fairly good agreement is seen\nbetween the calculated results and the experimental data points taken from the\nALICE experiment. Kinetic freeze-out conditions are extracted from the fits of\nthe transverse momentum spectra of these hadrons for each centrality class. A\ncomparison of the obtained freeze-out parameters with those of heavy-ion\ncollisions (Pb + Pb) is made and discussed.\n", "  We study numerically the oscillation death state in the phase oscillator\nmodel proposed byWinfree. We found that the phases in this state follow very\nsimple rules, actually, besides intrinsic properties of the oscillators, such\nas natural frequency and pulse shape, they depend only on the inverse of the\ndegree. Other topological properties such as transitivity or associativity\nseems to play no role on this state. Furthermore, we found that\ndegree-frequency correlation helps to inhibit oscillation death. Simple\nanalytical approximations corroborate the numerical results.\n", "  WEST (Tungsten Environment in Steady-State Tokamak) will be operating by the\nend of 2016 as a test bed for the ITER divertor components in long pulse\noperation. In this context, radiative cooling of highly ionized impurities like\ntungsten (W) sputtered from Plasma Facing Components (PFC) into the plasma core\nis a critical issue since even small impurity concentrations below 10-4 degrade\nsignificantly plasma performances and can lead to radiative collapse. In the\nplasma core, tungsten emission is dominant in the Soft X-ray (SXR) range 0.1\nkeV -- 15 keV with complex contributions from line transition, radiative\nrecombination and Bremsstrahlung emission.This paper presents the recent\ndevelopment of a synthetic SXR diagnostic using GEM (Gas Electron Multiplier)\ndetectors. This diagnostic will be used on WEST for W transport studies and\nwill be equipped with two new GEM based poloidal cameras allowing 2D\ntomographic reconstructions with spectral resolution in energy bands. Thus once\nGEM response to plasma emissivity is characterized thanks to synthetic\ndiagnostic, it offers new possibilities to disentangle the different SXR\ncontributions in harsh fusion environments like e.g. WEST or ITER with respect\nto conventional semiconductor diodes working in current mode. Emitted SXR\nspectrum from the plasma is modelled thanks to ADAS database from given WEST\nscenario. The synthetic diagnostic includes Lines of Sight (LoS) etendues of\nthe two cameras as well as probability of photoabsorption through filters,\nphotoionization in the detection gas mixture (Ar-CO2), and transport of\nelectron avalanches in the gas through GEM foils as computed with Magboltz.\nLocal SXR emissivity is then retrieved from tomographic inversion using a\nMinimum Fisher Information (MFI) algorithm.\n", "  Rabi oscillations is a key phenomenon among the variety of quantum optical\neffects that manifests itself in the periodic oscillations of a two-level\nsystem between the ground and excited states when interacting with\nelectromagnetic field. Commonly, the rate of these oscillations scales\nproportionally with the magnitude of the electric field probed by the two-level\nsystem. Here, we investigate the interaction of light with a two-level quantum\nemitter possessing permanent dipole moments. The semi-classical approach to\nthis problem predicts slowing down and even full suppression of Rabi\noscillations due to asymmetry in diagonal components of the dipole moment\noperator of the two-level system. We consider behavior of the system in the\nfully quantized picture and establish the analytical condition of Rabi\noscillations collapse. These results for the first time emphasize the behavior\nof two-level systems with permanent dipole moments in the few photon regime,\nand suggest observation of novel quantum optical effects.\n", "  We study the phase space dynamics of the non-minimally coupled\nMetric-Scalar-Torsion model in both Jordan and Einstein frames. We specifically\ncheck for the existence of critical points which yield stable solutions\nrepresenting the current state of accelerated expansion of the universe fuelled\nby the Dark Energy. It is found that such solutions do indeed exist, subject to\nconstraints on the free model parameter. In fact the evolution of the universe\nat these stable critical points exactly matches the evolution given by the\ncosmological solutions we found analytically in our previous work on the\nsubject.\n", "  We present a progress report on a new class of multigrid solver algorithm\nsuitable for the solution of 5d chiral fermions such as Domain Wall fermions\nand the Continued Fraction overlap. Unlike HDCG \\cite{Boyle:2014rwa}, the\nalgorithm works directly on a nearest neighbour fine operator. The fine\noperator used is Hermitian indefinite, for example $\\Gamma_5 D_{dwf}$, and\nconvergence is achieved with an indefinite matrix solver such as outer\niteration based on conjugate residual. As a result coarse space representations\nof the operator remain nearest neighbour, giving an 8 point stencil rather than\nthe 81 point stencil used in HDCG. It is hoped this may make it viable to\nrecalculate the matrix elements of the little Dirac operator in an HMC\nevolution.\n", "  The jet quenching phenomenon in heavy ion collisions provides a strong\nevidence of the modification of parton shower in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP).\nJet substructure observables can probe various aspects of the jet formation\nmechanism. They contain useful information about the QGP and allow us to study\nthe medium properties in great details. Here we present theoretical\ncalculations of jet shapes and cross sections in proton-proton and lead-lead\ncollisions at the LHC using soft-collinear effective theory, with Glauber gluon\ninteractions in the medium. We find that resumming large logarithms in the jet\nsubstructure calculation is necessary for precise theoretical predictions. The\nresummation is performed using renormalization group evolution between\ncharacteristic jet scales. We also find that the medium induces power\ncorrections to jet shapes. In the end we present the comparison between our\ncalculations with the recent measurements at the LHC with very good agreement.\nOur calculations help initiate precise jet modification studies in heavy ion\ncollisions.\n", "  Apparent variability of the longitudinal magnetic fields in most stars is\ncaused by rotation, which quantitavely changes projection of the magnetic field\nconfiguration on the line of sight. This is a purely geometrical effect and is\nnot related to possible intrinsic changes of the field. In some stars we\nobserve changes of the magnetic phase curve with time, which means that\nparameters of the magnetic field change. Such changes occur in some objects in\ntime scale of several years, which is few orders of magnitude faster than\npredicted by theory. Those changes imply need for improvement of the theory of\nmagnetic field evolution. We demonstrate changes of the rotational phase curves\nin few stars.\n", "  Form-invariance (covariance) and frame-indifference (objectivity) are two\nnotions in classical continuum mechanics which have attracted much attention\nand controversy over the past decades. Particularly in turbulence modelling it\nseems that there still is a need for clarification. The aim and purpose of this\nstudy is fourfold: (i) To achieve consensus in general on definitions and\nprinciples when trying to establish an invariant theory for modelling\nconstitutive structures and dynamic processes in mechanics, where special focus\nis put on the principle of Material Frame-Indifference (MFI). (ii) To show that\nin constitutive modelling MFI can only be regarded as an approximation that\nneeds to be reduced to a weaker statement when trying to advance it to an axiom\nof nature. (iii) To convince that in dynamical modelling, as in turbulence, MFI\nmay not be utilized as a modelling guideline, not even in an approximative\nsense. Instead, its reduced form has to be supplemented by a second,\nindependent axiom that includes the microscopic (fluctuating) description of\nthe dynamical processes. Concerning Navier-Stokes turbulence, the axiom of\nTurbulent Frame-Indifference (TFI) is stated in which turbulence has to be\nmodelled consistently with the invariant properties of the deterministic\nNavier-Stokes equations, and finally (iv) to propose a novel invariant\nmodelling ansatz both for constitutive and dynamical modelling that allows to\ninclude the (mean) velocity field as an own independent modelling variable,\nhowever, not in an absolute but only in the relative sense as a velocity\ndifference; a result that would systematically improve current modelling\nprocedures in extended thermodynamics and turbulence theory to be more\nconsistent with physical observations.\n", "  Statistical model of strongly anisotropic fully developed turbulence of the\nweakly compressible fluid is considered by means of the field theoretic\nrenormalization group. The corrections due to compressibility to the infrared\nform of the kinetic energy spectrum have been calculated in the leading order\nin Mach number expansion. Furthermore, in this approximation the validity of\nthe Kolmogorov hypothesis on the independence of dissipation length of velocity\ncorrelation functions in the inertial range has been proved.\n", "  Field theoretic renormalization group and the operator product expansion are\napplied to a model of a passive scalar field, advected by the Gaussian strongly\nanisotropic velocity field. Inertial-range anomalous scaling behavior is\nestablished, and explicit asymptotic expressions for the n-th order structure\nfunctions of scalar field are obtained; they are represented by superpositions\nof power laws with nonuniversal (dependent on the anisotropy parameters)\nanomalous exponents. In the limit of vanishing anisotropy, the exponents are\nassociated with tensor composite operators built of the scalar gradients, and\nexhibit a kind of hierarchy related to the degree of anisotropy: the less is\nthe rank, the less is the dimension and, consequently, the more important is\nthe contribution to the inertial-range behavior. The leading terms of the even\n(odd) structure functions are given by the scalar (vector) operators. For the\nfinite anisotropy, the exponents cannot be associated with individual operators\n(which are essentially ``mixed'' in renormalization), but the aforementioned\nhierarchy survives for all the cases studied. The second-order structure\nfunction is studied in more detail using the renormalization group and\nzero-mode techniques.\n", "  Interplay of kinematic and magnetic forcing in a model of a conducting fluid\nwith randomly driven magnetohydrodynamic equations has been studied in space\ndimensions $d\\ge 2$ by means of the renormalization group. A perturbative\nexpansion scheme, parameters of which are the deviation of the spatial\ndimension from two and the deviation of the exponent of the powerlike\ncorrelation function of random forcing from its critical value, has been used\nin one-loop approximation. Additional divergences have been taken into account\nwhich arise at two dimensions and have been inconsistently treated in earlier\ninvestigations of the model. It is shown that in spite of the additional\ndivergences the kinetic fixed point associated with the Kolmogorov scaling\nregime remains stable for all space dimensions $d\\ge 2$ for rapidly enough\nfalling off correlations of the magnetic forcing. A scaling regime driven by\nthermal fluctuations of the velocity field has been identified and analyzed.\nThe absence of a scaling regime near two dimensions driven by the fluctuations\nof the magnetic field has been confirmed. A new renormalization scheme has been\nput forward and numerically investigated to interpolate between the $\\epsilon$\nexpansion and the double expansion.\n", "  The influence of helicity on the stability of scaling regimes, on the\neffective diffusivity, and on the anomalous scaling of structure functions of a\npassive scalar advected by a Gaussian solenoidal velocity field with finite\ncorrelation time is investigated by the field theoretic renormalization group\nand operator product expansion within two-loop approximation. The influence of\nhelicity on the scaling regimes is discussed and shown in the plane of\nexponents $\\epsilon-\\eta$, where $\\epsilon$ characterizes the energy spectrum\nof the velocity field in the inertial range $E\\propto k^{1-2\\epsilon}$, and\n$\\eta$ is related to the correlation time at the wave number $k$ which is\nscaled as $k^{-2+\\eta}$. The restrictions given by nonzero helicity on the\nregions with stable fixed points which correspond to the scaling regimes are\nanalyzed in detail. The dependence of the effective diffusivity on the helicity\nparameter is discussed. The anomalous exponents of the structure functions of\nthe passive scalar field which define their anomalous scaling are calculated\nand it is shown that although the separate composite operators which define\nthem strongly depend on the helicity parameter the resulting two-loop\ncontributions to the critical dimensions of the structure functions are\nindependent of helicity. Details of calculations are shown.\n"]}
