and different methods of optimizing\nover extensions of the states. One is a generalization of the squashed\nentanglement where one takes the mutual information of parties conditioned on\nthe state's extension and takes the infimum over such extensions. Additivity of\nthe multipartite squashed entanglement is proved for both versions of the\nmultipartite information which turn out to be related. The second one is based\non taking classical extensions. This scheme is generalized, which enables to\nconstruct measures of entanglement based on the {\\it mixed convex roof} of a\nquantity, which in contrast to the standard convex roof method involves\noptimization over all decompositions of a density matrix rather than just the\ndecompositions into pure states. As one of the possible applications of these\nresults we prove that any multipartite monotone is an upper bound on the amount\nof multipartite distillable key. The findings are finally related to analogous\nresults in classical key agreement.\n", "  We have designed a system to stabilize the gain of a submillimeter heterodyne\nreceiver against thermal fluctuations of the mixing element. In the most\nsensitive heterodyne receivers, the mixer is usually cooled to 4 K using a\nclosed-cycle cryocooler, which can introduce ~1% fluctuations in the physical\ntemperature of the receiver components. We compensate for the resulting mixer\nconversion gain fluctuations by monitoring the physical temperature of the\nmixer and adjusting the gain of the intermediate frequency (IF) amplifier that\nimmediately follows the mixer. This IF power stabilization scheme, developed\nfor use at the Submillimeter Array (SMA), a submillimeter interferometer\ntelescope on Mauna Kea in Hawaii, routinely achieves a receiver gain stability\nof 1 part in 6,000 (rms to mean). This is an order of magnitude improvement\nover the typical uncorrected stability of 1 part in a few hundred. Our gain\nstabilization scheme is a useful addition to SIS heterodyne receivers that are\ncooled using closed-cycle cryocoolers in which the 4 K temperature fluctuations\ntend to be the leading cause of IF power fluctuations.\n", "  We summarise the mathematical foundation of the holographic method of\nmeasuring the reflector profile of an antenna or radio telescope. In\nparticular, we treat the case, where the signal source is located at a finite\ndistance from the antenna under test, necessitating the inclusion of the\nso-called Fresnel field terms in the radiation integrals. We assume a ``full\nphase'' system with reference receiver to provide the reference phase. We\ndescribe in some detail the hardware and software implementation of the system\nused for the holographic measurement of the 12m ALMA prototype submillimeter\nantennas. We include a description of the practicalities of a measurement and\nsurface setting. The results for both the VertexRSI and AEC\n(Alcatel-EIE-Consortium) prototype ALMA antennas are presented.\n", "  The remote sensing of gases in complex mixtures at atmospheric pressure is a\nchallenging problem and much attention has been paid to it. The most\nfundamental difference between this application and highly successful\nastrophysical and upper atmospheric remote sensing is the line width associated\nwith atmospheric pressure broadening, ~ 5 GHz in all spectral regions. In this\npaper, we discuss quantitatively a new approach that would use a short pulse\ninfrared laser to modulate the submillimeter/terahertz (SMM/THz) spectral\nabsorptions on the time scale of atmospheric relaxation. We show that such a\nscheme has three important attributes: (1) The time resolved pump makes it\npossible and efficient to separate signal from atmospheric and system clutter,\nthereby gaining as much as a factor of 10^6 in sensitivity, (2) The 3-D\ninformation matrix (infrared pump laser frequency, SMM/THz probe frequency, and\ntime resolved SMM/THz relaxation) can provide orders of magnitude greater\nspecificity than a sensor that uses only one of these three dimensions, and (3)\nThe congested and relatively weak spectra associated with large molecules can\nactually be an asset because the usually deleterious effect of their\noverlapping spectra can be used to increase signal strength.\n", "  Thin film coatings have been essential in development of several micro and\nnano-scale devices. To realize thin film coatings various deposition techniques\nare employed, each yielding surface morphologies with different characteristics\nof interest. Therefore, understanding and control of the surface growth is of\ngreat interest. In this paper, we devise a novel network-based modeling of the\ngrowth dynamics of such thin films and nano-structures. We specifically map\ndynamic steps taking place during the growth to components (e.g., nodes, links)\nof a corresponding network. We present initial results showing that this\nnetwork-based modeling approach to the growth dynamics can simplify our\nunderstanding of the fundamental physical dynamics such as shadowing and\nre-emission effects.\n", "  The Tore Supra tokamak is the largest superconducting magnetic fusion\nfacility, has been devoted to long-duration high-performance discharge\nresearch. With a steady-state magnetic field and water cooled plasma facing\ncomponents, discharges up to 6 minutes 24 seconds duration with injected /\nextracted energy up to 1 GJ have been performed. The Tore Supra real time\nmeasurements and control (RTMC) system has been upgraded to address schemes\ndedicated to long pulse operation with simultaneous control of an increasing\nnumber of plasma parameters. This includes plasma equilibrium control with\npossible self calibration during the discharge, plasma density control with\npossible pellet injection, current profile control to avoid\nmagneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities and infrared monitoring of plasma\nfacing components preventing overheating. Most of these improvements are\nrelevant to the tokamaks operation in a fully steady state regime.\n", "  Low-density parity check (LDPC) codes are a significant class of classical\ncodes with many applications. Several good LDPC codes have been constructed\nusing random, algebraic, and finite geometries approaches, with containing\ncycles of length at least six in their Tanner graphs. However, it is impossible\nto design a self-orthogonal parity check matrix of an LDPC code without\nintroducing cycles of length four.\n  In this paper, a new class of quantum LDPC codes based on lines and points of\nfinite geometries is constructed. The parity check matrices of these codes are\nadapted to be self-orthogonal with containing only one cycle of length four.\nAlso, the column and row weights, and bounds on the minimum distance of these\ncodes are given. As a consequence, the encoding and decoding algorithms of\nthese codes as well as their performance over various quantum depolarizing\nchannels will be investigated.\n", "  Two new relative entropy quantities, called the min- and max-relative\nentropies, are introduced and their properties are investigated. The well-known\nmin- and max- entropies, introduced by Renner, are obtained from these. We\ndefine a new entanglement monotone, which we refer to as the max-relative\nentropy of entanglement, and which is an upper bound to the relative entropy of\nentanglement. We also generalize the min- and max-relative entropies to obtain\nsmooth min- and max- relative entropies. These act as parent quantities for the\nsmooth Renyi entropies, and allow us to define the analogues of the mutual\ninformation, in the Smooth Renyi Entropy framework. Further, the spectral\ndivergence rates of the Information Spectrum approach are shown to be obtained\nfrom the smooth min- and max-relative entropies in the asymptotic limit.\n", "  We discuss characterization of single-photon wave packets by measuring\nHong-Ou-Mandel interference with a weak coherent pulse. A complete multimode\ncalculation is presented and effects of multiphoton terms in the coherent field\nas well as the impact of source and detection imperfections are discussed.\n", "  We report on the setup and characterization of a 698 nm master-slave diode\nlaser system to probe the 1S0-3P0 clock transition of strontium atoms confined\nin a one-dimensional optical lattice. A linewidth in the order of around 100 Hz\nof the laser system has been measured with respect to an ultrastable 657 nm\ndiode laser with 1 Hz linewidth using a femtosecond fiber comb as transfer\noscillator. The laser has been used to measure the magnetically induced 1S0-3P0\nclock transition in 88Sr where a linewidth of 165 Hz has been observed. The\ntransfer oscillator method provides a virtual beat signal between the two diode\nlasers that has been used to phase lock the 698 nm laser to the 1 Hz linewidth\nlaser at 657 nm, transferring its stability to the 698 nm laser system.\n", "  The effect of fractal clusters on magnetic and transport properties of\npercolative superconductors is studied. The superconductor contains percolative\nsuperconducting cluster carrying a transport current and clusters of a normal\nphase. It is found that normal phase clusters have essential fractal features.\nThe fractal dimension of the boundary of normal phase clusters is estimated.\nThe current-voltage characteristics of superconductors containing fractal\nclusters are obtained. It is found that the fractality of the cluster boundary\nintensifies pinning. This feature permits to enhance the current-carrying\ncapability of the superconductors.\n", "  In this letter, an approach for designing a tunable and steerable antenna is\npresented. The antenna model is based on a wideband bow-tie radiating element\nmounted above an active Artificial Magnetic Conductor (AMC). The AMC geometry\nconsists of a Frequency Selective Surface (FSS) printed on a thin grounded\ndielectric slab in which some chip-set varactor diodes are placed between the\nmetallic elements and the backing plane through vias. The resulting antenna can\nbe tuned over the S-Band by simply changing all varactor capacitances through\nan appropriate biasing voltage. Moreover, this structure can operate a beam\nscanning over each working frequency by applying an appropriate biasing voltage\nto the active elements of the AMC surface in accordance to leaky radiation\nprinciples. The low profile active antenna is characterized by an overall\nthickness of 5.32 mm, which corresponds to approximately lambda/24 at the\ncentre of the operating band.\n", "  Using a large deviations approach we calculate the probability distribution\nof the mutual information of MIMO channels in the limit of large antenna\nnumbers. In contrast to previous methods that only focused at the distribution\nclose to its mean (thus obtaining an asymptotically Gaussian distribution), we\ncalculate the full distribution, including its tails which strongly deviate\nfrom the Gaussian behavior near the mean. The resulting distribution\ninterpolates seamlessly between the Gaussian approximation for rates $R$ close\nto the ergodic value of the mutual information and the approach of Zheng and\nTse for large signal to noise ratios $\\rho$. This calculation provides us with\na tool to obtain outage probabilities analytically at any point in the $(R,\n\\rho, N)$ parameter space, as long as the number of antennas $N$ is not too\nsmall. In addition, this method also yields the probability distribution of\neigenvalues constrained in the subspace where the mutual information per\nantenna is fixed to $R$ for a given $\\rho$. Quite remarkably, this eigenvalue\ndensity is of the form of the Marcenko-Pastur distribution with square-root\nsingularities, and it depends on the values of $R$ and $\\rho$.\n", "  In this paper we theoretically study propagation of steady state ultrashort\npulse in dissipative medium. We considered two cases (i) medium consists of\nlossy metallic nanostructures embedded into a gain material and (ii) the gain\nmaterial is embedded directly into the nanostructures. We found the shape and\nvelocity of an optical pulse coupled with the polarization wave.\n", "  The influence of fast neutrons on the occupancy and the single tube\nresolution of ATLAS muon drift detectors was investigated by exposing a chamber\nbuilt out of 3 layers of 3 short standard drift tubes to neutron flux-densities\nof up to 16 kHz/cm2 at a neutron energy of E=11 MeV. Pulse shape capable NE213\nscintillaton detectors and a calibrated BF3 neutron detector provided\nmonitoring of the neutron flux-density and energy. The sensitivity of the drift\nchamber to the neutrons was measured to be 4*10-4 by comparing data sets with\nand without neutron background. For the investigation of tracks of cosmic muons\ntwo silicon-strip detectors above and underneath the chamber allow to compare\nmeasured drift-radii with reference tracks. Alternatively, the single tube\nresolution was determined using the triple-sum method. The comparison between\ndata with and without neutron irradiation shows only a marginal effect on the\nresolution and little influence on the muon track reconstruction.\n", "  An established body of literature shows that a student's affect can be linked\nto her epistemological stance [1]. In this literature, the epistemology is\ngenerally taken as a belief or stance toward a discipline, and the affective\nstance applies broadly to a discipline or classroom culture. A second, emerging\nline of research, however, shows that a student in a given discipline can shift\nbetween multiple locally coherent epistemological stances [2]. To begin uniting\nthese two bodies of literature, toward the long-term goal of incorporating\naffect into fine-grained models of in-the-moment cognitive dynamics, we present\na case study of \"Judy\", an undergraduate engineering major. We argue that a\nfine-grained aspect of Judy's affect, her annoyance at a particular kind of\nhomework problem, stabilizes a context-dependent epistemological stance she\ndisplays, about an unbridgeable gulf she perceives to exist between real and\nideal circuits.\n", "  For the SwissFEL Free Electron Laser project at the Paul Scherrer Institute,\na pulsed High Gradient (HG) electron gun was used to study low emittance\nelectron sources. Different metals and surface treatments for the cathode and\nanode were studied for their HG suitability. Diamond Like Carbon (DLC) coatings\nare found to perform exceptionally well for vacuum gap insulation. A set of DLC\ncoated electrodes with different coating parameters were tested for both vacuum\nbreakdown and photo electron emission. Surface electric fields over 250MV/m\n(350 - 400kV, pulsed) were achieved without breakdown. From the same surface,\nit was possible to photo-emit an electron beam at gradients up to 150MV/m. The\ntest setup and the experimental results are presented\n", "  (abridged) We study the hydrodynamic evolution of a non-spherical\ncore-collapse supernova in two spatial dimensions. We find that our model\ndisplays a strong tendency to expand toward the pole. We demonstrate that this\nexpansion is a physical property of the low-mode, SASI instability. The SASI\nleaves behind a large lateral velocity gradient in the post shock layer which\naffects the evolution for minutes and hours later. This results in a prolate\ndeformation of the ejecta and a fast advection of Ni-rich material from\nmoderate latitudes to the polar regions. This effect might actually be\nresponsible for the global asymmetry of the nickel lines in SN 1987A. The\nsimulations demonstrate that significant radial and lateral motions in the\npost-shock region, produced by convective overturn and the SASI during the\nearly explosion phase, contribute to the evolution for minutes and hours after\nshock revival. They lead to both later clump formation, and a significant\nprolate deformation of the ejecta which are observed even as late as one week\nafter the explosion. As pointed out recently by Kjaer et al., such an ejecta\nmorphology is in good agreement with the observational data of SN 1987A.\nSystematic future studies are needed to investigate how the SASI-induced\nlate-time lateral expansion depends on the dominant mode of the SASI, and to\nwhich extent it is affected by the dimensionality of the simulations. The\nimpact on and importance of the SASI for the distribution of iron group nuclei\nand the morphology of the young SNR argues for future three-dimensional\nexplosion and post-explosion studies on singularity-free grids that cover the\nentire sphere. Given the results of our 2D resolution study, present 3D\nsimulations must be regarded as underresolved, and their conclusions must be\nverified by a proper numerical convergence analysis in three dimensions.\n", "  Performance demands for high and super-high luminosity at the LHC (up to\n10^35 cm^(-2) sec^(-1) after the 2017 shutdown) and at future colliders demand\nhigh resolution tracking detectors with very fast time response and excellent\ntemporal and spatial resolution. We are investigating a new radiation detector\ntechnology based on Plasma Display Panels (PDP), the underlying engine of panel\nplasma television displays. The design and production of PDPs is supported by\nfour decades of industrial development. Emerging from this television\ntechnology is the Plasma Panel Sensor (PPS), a novel variant of the\nmicropattern radiation detector. The PPS is fundamentally an array of\nmicro-Geiger plasma discharge cells operating in a non-ageing, hermetically\nsealed gas mixture . We report on the PPS development program, including design\nof a PPS Test Cell.\n", "  Deconvolution is essential for radio interferometric imaging to produce\nscientific quality data because of finite sampling in the Fourier plane. Most\ndeconvolution algorithms are based on CLEAN which uses a grid of image pixels,\nor clean components. A critical matter in this process is the selection of\npixel size for optimal results in deconvolution. As a rule of thumb, the pixel\nsize is chosen smaller than the resolution dictated by the interferometer. For\nimages consisting of unresolved (or point like) sources, this approach yields\noptimal results. However, for sources that are not point like, in particular\nfor partially resolved sources, the selection of right pixel size is still an\nopen issue. In this paper, we investigate the limitations of pixelization in\ndeconvolving extended sources. In particular, we pursue the usage of\northonormal basis functions to model extended sources yielding better results\nthan by using clean components.\n", "  The value memristor devices offer to the neuromorphic computing hardware\ndesign community rests on the ability to provide effective device models that\ncan enable large scale integrated computing architecture application\nsimulations. Therefore, it is imperative to develop practical, functional\ndevice models of minimum mathematical complexity for fast, reliable, and\naccurate computing architecture technology design and simulation. To this end,\nvarious device models have been proposed in the literature seeking to\ncharacterize the physical electronic and time domain behavioral properties of\nmemristor devices. In this work, we analyze some promising and practical\nnon-quasi-static linear and non-linear memristor device models for neuromorphic\ncircuit design and computing architecture simulation.\n", "  The recent availability of blue sensitive silicon photomultipliers allows the\ndirect readout of blue emitting plastic scintillator tiles without the use of a\nwavelength shifting fiber. Such directly read out tiles, without light guides,\nare attractive for the use in highly granular calorimeters that use large\nnumbers of individual cells and in other applications where very compact\ndesigns are needed. However, the total signal amplitude and the uniformity of\nthe response can be problematic in such cases. We have developed a scanning\nsetup to investigate the response of scintillator tiles with SiPM readout in\ndetail. It was used to develop optimized scintillator tile geometries for\nhighly granular hadronic calorimetry at future colliders and to investigate the\nfeasibility of a SiPM readout for the trigger of the ATLAS ALFA luminosity\ndetectors. We report on results obtained with specialized scintillator tile\ngeometries, discuss first results obtained with directly coupled SiPM readout\nof the ATLAS ALFA trigger tiles and introduce the application of fiberless\nreadout in an experiment to study the time structure of hadronic showers.\n", "  Visualisation and analysis of terabyte-scale datacubes, as will be produced\nwith the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), will pose\nchallenges for existing astronomy software and the work practices of\nastronomers. Focusing on the proposed outcomes of WALLABY (Widefield ASKAP\nL-Band Legacy All-Sky Blind Survey), and using lessons learnt from HIPASS (HI\nParkes All Sky Survey), we identify issues that astronomers will face with\nWALLABY data cubes. We comment on potential research directions and possible\nsolutions to these challenges.\n", "  The muon detection system of the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at the CERN\nLarge Hadron Collider is based on different technologies for muon tracking and\ntriggering. In particular, the muon system in the endcap disks of the detector\nconsists of Resistive Plate Chambers for triggering and Cathode Strip Chambers\nfor tracking. At present, the endcap muon system is only partially instrumented\nwith the very forward detector region remaining uncovered. In view of a\npossible future extension of the muon endcap system, we report on a feasibility\nstudy on the use of Micro-Pattern Gas Detectors, in particular Gas Electron\nMultipliers, for both muon triggering and tracking. Results on the construction\nand characterization of small tripleGas Electron Multiplier prototype detectors\nare presented.\n", "  Graphene field-effect transistors are fabricated utilizing single-crystal\nhexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), an insulating isomorph of graphene, as the gate\ndielectric. The devices exhibit mobility values exceeding 10,000 cm2/V-sec and\ncurrent saturation down to 500 nm channel lengths with intrinsic\ntransconductance values above 400 mS/mm. The work demonstrates the favorable\nproperties of using h-BN as a gate dielectric for graphene FETs.\n", "  When classical information is sent over a channel with quantum-state\nmodulation alphabet, such as the free-space optical (FSO) channel, attaining\nthe ultimate (Holevo) limit to channel capacity requires the receiver to make\njoint measurements over long codeword blocks. In recent work, we showed a\nreceiver for a pure-state channel that can attain the ultimate capacity by\napplying a single-shot optical (unitary) transformation on the received\ncodeword state followed by simultaneous (but separable) projective measurements\non the single-modulation-symbol state spaces. In this paper, we study the\nultimate tradeoff between photon efficiency and spectral efficiency for the FSO\nchannel. Based on our general results for the pure-state quantum channel, we\nshow some of the first concrete examples of codes and laboratory-realizable\njoint-detection optical receivers that can achieve fundamentally higher\n(superadditive) channel capacity than receivers that physically detect each\nmodulation symbol one at a time, as is done by all conventional (coherent or\ndirect-detection) optical receivers.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the recent photoemission-type experiment on\n$^{40}$K Fermi gases done by JILA group. Including pairing fluctuations within\na strong-coupling $T$-matrix theory, as well as effects of a harmonic trap\nwithin the local density approximation, we calculate photoemission spectra in\nthe BCS (Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer)-BEC (Bose-Einstein condensation) crossover\nregion. We show that the energy resolution of the current photoemission\nexperiment is enough to detect the pseudogap phenomenon. We also show how the\npseudogap in single-particle excitations continuously changes into the\nsuperfluid gap, as one decreases the temperature below the superfluid phase\ntransition temperature. Our results would be useful for the study of\nsingle-particle properties of ultracold Fermi gases in the BCS-BEC crossover.\n", "  The aim of this paper is to determine quantum master and filter equations for\nsystems coupled to continuous-mode single photon fields. The system and field\nare described using a quantum stochastic unitary model, where the\ncontinuous-mode single photon state for the field is determined by a wavepacket\npulse shape. The master equation is derived from this model and is given in\nterms of a system of coupled equations. The output field carries information\nabout the system from the scattered photon, and is continuously monitored. The\nquantum filter is determined with the aid of an embedding of the system into a\nlarger system, and is given by a system of coupled stochastic differential\nequations. An example is provided to illustrate the main results.\n", "  Consider the set of all sequences of $n$ outcomes, each taking one of $m$\nvalues, that satisfy a number of linear constraints. If $m$ is fixed while $n$\nincreases, most sequences that satisfy the constraints result in frequency\nvectors whose entropy approaches that of the maximum entropy vector satisfying\nthe constraints. This well-known \"entropy concentration\" phenomenon underlies\nthe maximum entropy method.\n  Existing proofs of the concentration phenomenon are based on limits or\nasymptotics and unrealistically assume that constraints hold precisely,\nsupporting maximum entropy inference more in principle than in practice. We\npresent, for the first time, non-asymptotic, explicit lower bounds on $n$ for a\nnumber of variants of the concentration result to hold to any prescribed\naccuracies, with the constraints holding up to any specified tolerance, taking\ninto account the fact that allocations of discrete units can satisfy\nconstraints only approximately. Again unlike earlier results, we measure\nconcentration not by deviation from the maximum entropy value, but by the\n$\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$ distances from the maximum entropy-achieving frequency\nvector. One of our results holds independently of the alphabet size $m$ and is\nbased on a novel proof technique using the multi-dimensional Berry-Esseen\ntheorem. We illustrate and compare our results using various detailed examples.\n", "  We present a classification-based approach to identify quasi-stellar radio\nsources (quasars) in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and evaluate its performance\non a manually labeled training set. While reasonable results can already be\nobtained via approaches working only on photometric data, our experiments\nindicate that simple but problem-specific features extracted from spectroscopic\ndata can significantly improve the classification performance. Since our\napproach works orthogonal to existing classification schemes used for building\nthe spectroscopic catalogs, our classification results are well suited for a\nmutual assessment of the approaches' accuracies.\n", "  We describe the development of two circularly symmetric antennas with high\npolarization purity and low spillover. Both were designed to be used in an\nall-sky polarization and intensity survey at 5 GHz (the C-Band All-Sky Survey,\nC-BASS). The survey requirements call for very low levels of cross-polar\nleakage and far-out sidelobes. Two different existing antennas, with 6.1-m and\n7.6-m diameter primaries, were adapted by replacing the feed and secondary\noptics, resulting in identical beam performances of 0.73deg FWHM,\ncross-polarization better than -50 dB, and far-out sidelobes below -70 dB. The\npolarization purity was realized by using a symmetric low-loss dielectric foam\nsupport structure for the secondary mirror, avoiding the need for secondary\nsupport struts. Ground spill-over was largely reduced by using absorbing\nbaffles around the primary and secondary mirrors, and by the use of a\nlow-sidelobe profiled corrugated feedhorn. The 6.1-m antenna and receiver have\nbeen completed and test results show that the optics meet their design goals.\n", "  At present, part of the forward RPC muon system of the CMS detector at the\nCERN LHC remains uninstrumented in the high-\\eta region. An international\ncollaboration is investigating the possibility of covering the 1.6 < |\\eta| <\n2.4 region of the muon endcaps with large-area triple-GEM detectors. Given\ntheir good spatial resolution, high rate capability, and radiation hardness,\nthese micro-pattern gas detectors are an appealing option for simultaneously\nenhancing muon tracking and triggering capabilities in a future upgrade of the\nCMS detector. A general overview of this feasibility study will be presented.\nThe design and construction of small (10\\times10 cm2) and full-size trapezoidal\n(1\\times0.5 m2) triple-GEM prototypes will be described. During detector\nassembly, different techniques for stretching the GEM foils were tested.\nResults from measurements with x-rays and from test beam campaigns at the CERN\nSPS will be shown for the small and large prototypes. Preliminary simulation\nstudies on the expected muon reconstruction and trigger performances of this\nproposed upgraded muon system will be reported.\n", "  We study localisation effects of strong disorder on the spectral and\ndynamical properties of (matrix and scalar) Schroedinger operators with\nnon-monotone random potentials, on the d-dimensional lattice. Our results\ninclude dynamical localisation, i.e. exponentially decaying bounds on the\ntransition amplitude in the mean. They are derived through the study of\nfractional moments of the resolvent, which are finite due to\nresonance-diffusing effects of the disorder. One of the byproducts of the\nanalysis is a nearly optimal Wegner estimate. A particular example of the class\nof systems covered by our results is the discrete alloy-type Anderson model.\n", "  We give a physically compelling definition of the instantaneous reactive\nenergy density associated with an arbitrary transient electromagnetic field in\nvacuum.\n", "  Reconstruction of biochemical reaction networks is a central topic in systems\nbiology which raises crucial theoretical challenges in system identification.\nNonlinear Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) that involve polynomial and\nrational functions are typically used to model biochemical reaction networks.\nSuch nonlinear models make the problem of determining the connectivity of\nbiochemical networks from time-series experimental data quite difficult. In\nthis paper, we present a network reconstruction algorithm that can deal with\nmodel descriptions under the form of polynomial and rational functions. Rather\nthan identifying the parameters of linear or nonlinear ODEs characterised by\npre-defined equation structures, our methodology allows us to determine the\nnonlinear ODEs structure together with their associated reaction constants. To\nsolve the network reconstruction problem, we cast it as a Compressive Sensing\n(CS) problem and use Bayesian Sparse Learning (BSL) algorithms as an efficient\nway to obtain its solution.\n", "  Interpreting samples from likelihood or posterior probability density\nfunctions is rarely as straightforward as it seems it should be. Producing\npublication-quality graphics of these distributions is often similarly painful.\nIn this short note I describe pippi, a simple, publicly-available package for\nparsing and post-processing such samples, as well as generating high-quality\nPDF graphics of the results. Pippi is easily and extensively configurable and\ncustomisable, both in its options for parsing and post-processing samples, and\nin the visual aspects of the figures it produces. I illustrate some of these\nusing an existing supersymmetric global fit, performed in the context of a\ngamma-ray search for dark matter. Pippi can be downloaded and followed at\nhttp://github.com/patscott/pippi .\n", "  In the last decades cosmological N-body dark matter simulations have enabled\nab initio studies of the formation of structure in the Universe. Gravity\namplified small density fluctuations generated shortly after the Big Bang,\nleading to the formation of galaxies in the cosmic web. These calculations have\nled to a growing demand for methods to analyze time-dependent particle based\nsimulations. Rendering methods for such N-body simulation data usually employ\nsome kind of splatting approach via point based rendering primitives and\napproximate the spatial distributions of physical quantities using kernel\ninterpolation techniques, common in SPH (Smoothed Particle\nHydrodynamics)-codes. This paper proposes three GPU-assisted rendering\napproaches, based on a new, more accurate method to compute the physical\ndensities of dark matter simulation data. It uses full phase-space information\nto generate a tetrahedral tessellation of the computational domain, with mesh\nvertices defined by the simulation's dark matter particle positions. Over time\nthe mesh is deformed by gravitational forces, causing the tetrahedral cells to\nwarp and overlap. The new methods are well suited to visualize the cosmic web.\nIn particular they preserve caustics, regions of high density that emerge, when\nseveral streams of dark matter particles share the same location in space,\nindicating the formation of structures like sheets, filaments and halos. We\ndemonstrate the superior image quality of the new approaches in a comparison\nwith three standard rendering techniques for N-body simulation data.\n", "  This paper investigates cultural dynamics in social media by examining the\nproliferation and diversification of clearly-cut pieces of content: quoted\ntexts. In line with the pioneering work of Leskovec et al. and Simmons et al.\non memes dynamics we investigate in deep the transformations that quotations\npublished online undergo during their diffusion. We deliberately put aside the\nstructure of the social network as well as the dynamical patterns pertaining to\nthe diffusion process to focus on the way quotations are changed, how often\nthey are modified and how these changes shape more or less diverse families and\nsub-families of quotations. Following a biological metaphor, we try to\nunderstand in which way mutations can transform quotations at different scales\nand how mutation rates depend on various properties of the quotations.\n", "  Influence maximization is the problem of finding a set of influential users\nin a social network such that the expected spread of influence under a certain\npropagation model is maximized. Much of the previous work has neglected the\nimportant distinction between social influence and actual product adoption.\nHowever, as recognized in the management science literature, an individual who\ngets influenced by social acquaintances may not necessarily adopt a product (or\ntechnology), due, e.g., to monetary concerns. In this work, we distinguish\nbetween influence and adoption by explicitly modeling the states of being\ninfluenced and of adopting a product. We extend the classical Linear Threshold\n(LT) model to incorporate prices and valuations, and factor them into users'\ndecision-making process of adopting a product. We show that the expected profit\nfunction under our proposed model maintains submodularity under certain\nconditions, but no longer exhibits monotonicity, unlike the expected influence\nspread function. To maximize the expected profit under our extended LT model,\nwe employ an unbudgeted greedy framework to propose three profit maximization\nalgorithms. The results of our detailed experimental study on three real-world\ndatasets demonstrate that of the three algorithms, \\textsf{PAGE}, which assigns\nprices dynamically based on the profit potential of each candidate seed, has\nthe best performance both in the expected profit achieved and in running time.\n", "  This paper examines the statistical mechanical and thermodynamical\nconsequences of variable phase-space volume element $h_I=\\bigtriangleup\nx_i\\bigtriangleup p_i$. Varying $h_I$ leads to variations in the amount of\nmeasured information of a system but the maximum entropy remains constant due\nto the uncertainty principle. By taking $h_u\\rightarrow 0^+$ an infinite\nunobservable entropy is attained leading to an infinite unobservable energy per\nparticle and an unobservable chemical equilibrium between all particles. The\namount of heat fluxing though measurement apparatus is formulated as a function\nof $h_I$ for systems in steady state equilibrium as well as the number of\nmeasured particles or sub-particles so any system can be described as unitary\nor composite in number. Some example systems are given using variable $h_I$.\n", "  Because networks can be used to represent many complex systems, they have\nattracted considerable attention in physics, computer science, sociology, and\nmany other disciplines. One of the most important areas of network science is\nthe algorithmic detection of cohesive groups (i.e., \"communities\") of nodes. In\nthis paper, we algorithmically detect communities in social networks and image\ndata by optimizing multislice modularity. A key advantage of modularity\noptimization is that it does not require prior knowledge of the number or sizes\nof communities, and it is capable of finding network partitions that are\ncomposed of communities of different sizes. By optimizing multislice modularity\nand subsequently calculating diagnostics on the resulting network partitions,\nit is thereby possible to obtain information about network structure across\nmultiple system scales. We illustrate this method on data from both social\nnetworks and images, and we find that optimization of multislice modularity\nperforms well on these two tasks without the need for extensive\nproblem-specific adaptation. However, improving the computational speed of this\nmethod remains a challenging open problem.\n", "  A real-time Quantum Key Distribution System is developed in this paper. In\nthe system, based on the feature of Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA),\nsecure key extraction control and algorithm have been optimally designed to\nperform sifting, error correction and privacy amplification altogether in\nreal-time. In the QKD experiment information synchronization mechanism and\nhigh-speed classic data channel are designed to ensure the steady operation of\nthe system. Decoy state and synchronous laser light source are used in the\nsystem, while the length of optical fiber between Alice and Bob is 20 km. With\nphotons repetition frequency of 20 MHz, the final key rate could reach 17 kbps.\nSmooth and robust operation is verified with 6-hour continuous test and\nassociated with encrypted voice communication test.\n", "  We define a new phenomenon for communication over noisy quantum channels. The\ninvestigated solution is called polaractivation and based on quantum polar\nencoding. Polaractivation is a natural consequence of the channel polarization\neffect in quantum systems and makes possible to open the hidden capacity\nregions of a noisy quantum channel by using the idea of rate increment. While\nin case of a classical channel only the rate of classical communication can be\nincreased, in case of a quantum channel the channel polarization and the rate\nimprovement can be exploited to open unreachable capacity regions. We\ndemonstrate the results for the opening of private classical capacity-domain.\nWe prove that the method works for arbitrary quantum channels if a given\ncriteria in the symmetric classical capacity is satisfied. We also derived a\nnecessary lower bound on the rate of classical communication for the\npolaractivation of private classical capacity-domain.\n", "  We investigate a quantum coding for quantum communication over a PD\n(partially degradable) degradable quantum channel. For a PD channel, the\ndegraded environment state can be expressed from the channel output state up to\na degrading map. PD channels can be restricted to the set of optical channels\nwhich allows for the parties to exploit the benefits in experimental quantum\ncommunications. We show that for a PD channel, the partial degradability\nproperty leads to higher quantum data rates in comparison to those of a\ndegradable channel. The PD property is particular convenient for quantum\ncommunications and allows one to implement the experimental quantum protocols\nwith higher performance. We define a coding scheme for PD-channels and give the\nachievable rates of quantum communication.\n", "  We derive a modular fluid-flow network congestion control model based on a\nlaw of fundamental nature in networks: the conservation of information. Network\nelements such as queues, users, and transmission channels and network\nperformance indicators like sending/acknowledgement rates and delays are\nmathematically modelled by applying this law locally. Our contributions are\ntwofold. First, we introduce a modular metamodel that is sufficiently generic\nto represent any network topology. The proposed model is composed of building\nblocks that implement mechanisms ignored by the existing ones, which can be\nrecovered from exact reduction or approximation of this new model. Second, we\nprovide a novel classification of previously proposed models in the literature\nand show that they are often not capable of capturing the transient behavior of\nthe network precisely. Numerical results obtained from packet-level simulations\ndemonstrate the accuracy of the proposed model.\n", "  We report on simulation results that shows optimum photon absorption by\nsuperconducting nanowires can happen at a fill-factor that is much less than\n100%. We also present experimental results on high performance of our\nsuperconducting nanowire single photon detectors realized using NbTiN on\noxidized silicon.\n", "  Collaboration networks arise when we map the connections between scientists\nwhich are formed through joint publications. These networks thus display the\nsocial structure of academia, and also allow conclusions about the structure of\nscientific knowledge. Using the computer science publication database DBLP, we\ncompile relations between authors and publications as graphs and proceed with\nexamining and quantifying collaborative relations with graph-based methods. We\nreview standard properties of the network and rank authors and publications by\ncentrality. Additionally, we detect communities with modularity-based\nclustering and compare the resulting clusters to a ground-truth based on\nconferences and thus topical similarity. In a second part, we are the first to\ncombine DBLP network data with data from the Dagstuhl Seminars: We investigate\nwhether seminars of this kind, as social and academic events designed to\nconnect researchers, leave a visible track in the structure of the\ncollaboration network. Our results suggest that such single events are not\ninfluential enough to change the network structure significantly. However, the\nnetwork structure seems to influence a participant's decision to accept or\ndecline an invitation.\n", "  We consider stochastic electro-mechanical dynamics of an overdamped power\nsystem in the vicinity of the saddle-node bifurcation associated with the loss\nof global stability such as voltage collapse or phase angle instability.\nFluctuations of the system state vector are driven by random variations of\nloads and intermittent renewable generation. In the vicinity of collapse the\npower system experiences so-called phenomenon of critical slowing-down\ncharacterized by slowing and simultaneous amplification of the system state\nvector fluctuations. In generic case of a co-dimension 1 bifurcation\ncorresponding to the threshold of instability it is possible to extract a\nsingle mode of the system state vector responsible for this phenomenon. We\ncharacterize stochastic fluctuations of the system state vector using the\nformal perturbative expansion over the lowest (real) eigenvalue of the system\npower flow Jacobian and verify the resulting expressions for correlation\nfunctions of the state vector by direct numerical simulations. We conclude that\nthe onset of critical slowing-down is a good marker of approach to the\nthreshold of global instability. It can be straightforwardly detected from the\nanalysis of single-node autostructure and autocorrelation functions of system\nstate variables and thus does not require full observability of the grid.\n", "  As the rate of content production grows, we must make a staggering number of\ndaily decisions about what information is worth acting on. For any flourishing\nonline social media system, users can barely keep up with the new content\nshared by friends. How does the user-interface design help or hinder users'\nability to find interesting content? We analyze the choices people make about\nwhich information to propagate on the social media sites Twitter and Digg. We\nobserve regularities in behavior which can be attributed directly to cognitive\nlimitations of humans, resulting from the different visibility policies of each\nsite. We quantify how people divide their limited attention among competing\nsources of information, and we show how the user-interface design can mediate\ninformation spread.\n", "  Analysis of information retrieved from microblogging services such as Twitter\ncan provide valuable insight into public sentiment in a geographic region. This\ninsight can be enriched by visualising information in its geographic context.\nTwo underlying approaches for sentiment analysis are dictionary-based and\nmachine learning. The former is popular for public sentiment analysis, and the\nlatter has found limited use for aggregating public sentiment from Twitter\ndata. The research presented in this paper aims to extend the machine learning\napproach for aggregating public sentiment. To this end, a framework for\nanalysing and visualising public sentiment from a Twitter corpus is developed.\nA dictionary-based approach and a machine learning approach are implemented\nwithin the framework and compared using one UK case study, namely the royal\nbirth of 2013. The case study validates the feasibility of the framework for\nanalysis and rapid visualisation. One observation is that there is good\ncorrelation between the results produced by the popular dictionary-based\napproach and the machine learning approach when large volumes of tweets are\nanalysed. However, for rapid analysis to be possible faster methods need to be\ndeveloped using big data techniques and parallel methods.\n", "  The focused organization theory of social ties proposes that the structure of\nhuman social networks can be arranged around extra-network foci, which can\ninclude shared physical spaces such as homes, workplaces, restaurants, and so\non. Until now, this has been difficult to investigate on a large scale, but the\nhuge volume of data available from online location-based social services now\nmakes it possible to examine the friendships and mobility of many thousands of\npeople, and to investigate the relationship between meetings at places and the\nstructure of the social network. In this paper, we analyze a large dataset from\nFoursquare, the most popular online location-based social network. We examine\nthe properties of city-based social networks, finding that they have common\nstructural properties, and that the category of place where two people meet has\nvery strong influence on the likelihood of their being friends. Inspired by\nthese observations in combination with the focused organization theory, we then\npresent a model to generate city-level social networks, and show that it\nproduces networks with the structural properties seen in empirical data.\n", "  Information garnered from activity on location-based social networks can be\nharnessed to characterize urban spaces and organize them into neighborhoods. In\nthis work, we adopt a data-driven approach to the identification and modeling\nof urban neighborhoods using location-based social networks. We represent\ngeographic points in the city using spatio-temporal information about\nFoursquare user check-ins and semantic information about places, with the goal\nof developing features to input into a novel neighborhood detection algorithm.\nThe algorithm first employs a similarity metric that assesses the homogeneity\nof a geographic area, and then with a simple mechanism of geographic\nnavigation, it detects the boundaries of a city's neighborhoods. The models and\nalgorithms devised are subsequently integrated into a publicly available,\nmap-based tool named Hoodsquare that allows users to explore activities and\nneighborhoods in cities around the world.\n  Finally, we evaluate Hoodsquare in the context of a recommendation\napplication where user profiles are matched to urban neighborhoods. By\ncomparing with a number of baselines, we demonstrate how Hoodsquare can be used\nto accurately predict the home neighborhood of Twitter users. We also show that\nwe are able to suggest neighborhoods geographically constrained in size, a\ndesirable property in mobile recommendation scenarios for which geographical\nprecision is key.\n", "  We consider the problem of controlling the propagation of an epidemic\noutbreak in an arbitrary network of contacts by investing on disease awareness\nthroughout the network. We model the effect of agent awareness on the dynamics\nof an epidemic using the SAIS epidemic model, an extension of the SIS epidemic\nmodel that includes a state of \"awareness\". This model allows to derive a\ncondition to control the spread of an epidemic outbreak in terms of the\neigenvalues of a matrix that depends on the network structure and the\nparameters of the model. We study the problem of finding the cost-optimal\ninvestment on disease awareness throughout the network when the cost function\npresents some realistic properties. We propose a convex framework to find\ncost-optimal allocation of resources. We validate our results with numerical\nsimulations in a real online social network.\n", "  (abridged) There exists a substantial disagreement between computer\nsimulation results and high-energy density laboratory experiments of the\nRayleigh-Taylor instability Kuranz et al. (2010).\n  We adopt the Braginskii formulation for transport in hot, dense plasma,\nimplement and verify the additional physics modules, and conduct a\ncomputational study of a single-mode RTI in two dimensions with various\ncombinations of the newly implemented modules.\n  We find that magnetic fields reach levels on the order of 11 MG in the\nabsence of thermal conduction. We observe denting of the RT spike tip and\ngeneration of additional higher order modes as a result of these fields.\nContrary to interpretation presented in earlier work Nishiguchi (2002), the\nadditional mode is not generated due to modified anisotropic heat transport\neffects but due to dynamical effect of self-generated magnetic fields.\n  The main effects of thermal conduction are a reduction of the RT instability\ngrowth rate (by about 20% for conditions considered here) and inhibited mixing\non small scales. In this case, the maximum self-generated magnetic fields are\nweaker (approximately 1.7 MG). These self-generated magnetic fields are of very\nsimilar strength compared to magnetic fields observed recently in HED\nlaboratory experiments Manuel et al. (2012).\n  We find that thermal conduction plays the dominant role in the evolution of\nthe model RTI system considered. It smears out small-scale structure and\nreduces the RTI growth rate. This may account for the relatively featureless RT\nspikes seen in experiments, but does not explain mass extensions observed in\nexperiments.\n  Resistivity and related heat source terms were not included in the present\nwork, but we estimate their impact on RTI as modest and not affecting our main\nconclusions. Resistive effects will be discussed in detail in the next paper in\nthe series.\n", "  IAXO, the new International AXion Observatory, will feature the most\nambitious detector for solar axions to date. Axions are hypothetical particles\nwhich were postulated to solve one of the puzzles arising in the standard model\nof particle physics, namely the strong CP (Charge conjugation and Parity)\nproblem. This detector aims at achieving a sensitivity to the coupling between\naxions and photons of one order of magnitude beyond the limits of the current\ndetector, the CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST). The IAXO detector relies on a\nhigh-magnetic field distributed over a very large volume to convert solar\naxions to detectable X-ray photons. Inspired by the ATLAS barrel and end-cap\ntoroids, a large superconducting toroid is being designed. The toroid comprises\neight, one meter wide and twenty one meters long racetrack coils. The assembled\ntoroid is sized 5.2 m in diameter and 25 m in length and its mass is about 250\ntons. The useful field in the bores is 2.5 T while the peak magnetic field in\nthe windings is 5.4 T. At the operational current of 12 kA the stored energy is\n500 MJ. The racetrack type of coils are wound with a reinforced Aluminum\nstabilized NbTi/Cu cable and are conduction cooled. The coils optimization is\nshortly described as well as new concepts for cryostat, cold mass, supporting\nstructure and the sun tracking system. Materials selection and sizing,\nconductor, thermal loads, the cryogenics system and the electrical system are\ndescribed. Lastly, quench simulations are reported to demonstrate the system's\nsafe quench protection scheme.\n", "  Mapping our universe in 3D by imaging the redshifted 21 cm line from neutral\nhydrogen has the potential to overtake the cosmic microwave background as our\nmost powerful cosmological probe, because it can map a much larger volume of\nour Universe, shedding new light on the epoch of reionization, inflation, dark\nmatter, dark energy, and neutrino masses. We report on MITEoR, a pathfinder\nlow-frequency radio interferometer whose goal is to test technologies that\ngreatly reduce the cost of such 3D mapping for a given sensitivity. MITEoR\naccomplishes this by using massive baseline redundancy both to enable automated\nprecision calibration and to cut the correlator cost scaling from N^2 to NlogN,\nwhere N is the number of antennas. The success of MITEoR with its 64\ndual-polarization elements bodes well for the more ambitious HERA project,\nwhich would incorporate many identical or similar technologies using an order\nof magnitude more antennas, each with dramatically larger collecting area.\n", "  Reactions to posts in an online social network show different dynamics\ndepending on several textual features of the corresponding content. Do similar\ndynamics exist when images are posted? Exploiting a novel dataset of posts,\ngathered from the most popular Google+ users, we try to give an answer to such\na question. We describe several virality phenomena that emerge when taking into\naccount visual characteristics of images (such as orientation, mean saturation,\netc.). We also provide hypotheses and potential explanations for the dynamics\nbehind them, and include cases for which common-sense expectations do not hold\ntrue in our experiments.\n", "  Recent work on Ultra Long Period Cepheids (ULPCs) has suggested their\nusefulness as a distance indicator, but has not commented on their relationship\nas compared with other types of variable stars. In this work, we use Fourier\nanalysis to quantify the structure of ULPC light curves and compare them to\nClassical Cepheids and Mira variables. Our preliminary results suggest that the\nlow order Fourier parameters of ULPCs show a continuous trend defined by\nClassical Cepheids after the resonance around 10 days. However their Fourier\nparameters also overlapped with those from Miras, which make the classification\nof long period variable stars difficult based on the light curves information\nalone.\n", "  The amount of collected data in many scientific fields is increasing, all of\nthem requiring a common task: extract knowledge from massive, multi parametric\ndata sets, as rapidly and efficiently possible. This is especially true in\nastronomy where synoptic sky surveys are enabling new research frontiers in the\ntime domain astronomy and posing several new object classification challenges\nin multi dimensional spaces; given the high number of parameters available for\neach object, feature selection is quickly becoming a crucial task in analyzing\nastronomical data sets. Using data sets extracted from the ongoing Catalina\nReal-Time Transient Surveys (CRTS) and the Kepler Mission we illustrate a\nvariety of feature selection strategies used to identify the subsets that give\nthe most information and the results achieved applying these techniques to\nthree major astronomical problems.\n", "  Vapor cell atomic clocks exhibit reduced frequency stability for averaging\ntime between about one hundred and a few thousand seconds. Here we report a\nstudy on the impact of the main parameters on the mid-to-long term instability\nof a buffer-gas vapor cell Cs clock, based on coherent population trapping\n(CPT). The CPT signal is observed on the Cs D1 line transmission, using a\ndouble $\\Lambda$ scheme and a Ramsey interrogation technique. The effects on\nthe clock frequency of the magnetic field, the cell temperature, and the laser\nintensities are reported. We show in particular that the laser intensity shift\nis temperature dependent. Along with the laser intensity ratio and laser\npolarization properties, this is one of the most important parameters.\n", "  The massive amounts of geolocation data collected from mobile phone records\nhas sparked an ongoing effort to understand and predict the mobility patterns\nof human beings. In this work, we study the extent to which social phenomena\nare reflected in mobile phone data, focusing in particular in the cases of\nurban commute and major sports events. We illustrate how these events are\nreflected in the data, and show how information about the events can be used to\nimprove predictability in a simple model for a mobile phone user's location.\n", "  We investigate the possibility of generating and studying turbulence in\nplasma by means of high-energy density laser-driven experiments. Our focus is\nto create supersonic, self-magnetized turbulence with characteristics that\nresemble those found in the interstellar medium (ISM).\n  We consider a target made of a spherical core surrounded by a shell made of\ndenser material. The shell is irradiated by a sequence of laser pulses sending\ninward-propagating shocks that convert the inner core into plasma and create\nturbulence. In the context of the evolution of the ISM, the shocks play the\nrole of supernova remnant shocks and the core represents the ionized\ninterstellar medium. We consider the effects of both pre-existing and\nself-generating magnetic fields and study the evolution of the system by means\nof two-dimensional numerical simulations.\n  We find that the evolution of the turbulent core is generally, subsonic with\nrms-Mach number $M_t\\approx 0.2$. We observe an isotropic, turbulent velocity\nfield with an inertial range power spectra of $P(k)\\propto k^{-2.3}$. We\naccount for the effects of self-magnetization and find that the resulting\nmagnetic field has characteristic strength $\\approx 3\\times 10^{4}$ G. The\ncorresponding plasma beta is $\\approx 1\\times 10^{4}$--$1\\times 10^{5}$,\nindicating that the magnetic field does not play an important role in the\ndynamical evolution of the system.\n  The natural extension of this work is to study the system evolution in\nthree-dimensions, with various laser drive configurations, and targets with\nshells and cores of different masses. The latter modification may help to\nincrease the turbulent intensity and possibly create transonic turbulence. One\nof the key challenges is to obtain transonic turbulent conditions in a\nquasi-steady state environment.\n", "  We study the evolution of the collapsing core of a 15 Msun blue supergiant\nsupernova progenitor from the core bounce until 1.5 seconds later. We present a\nsample of hydrodynamic models parameterized to match the explosion energetics\nof SN 1987A.\n  We find the spatial model dimensionality to be an important contributing\nfactor in the explosion process. Compared to two-dimensional simulations, our\nthree-dimensional models require lower neutrino luminosities to produce equally\nenergetic explosions. We estimate that the convective engine in our models is\n4% more efficient in three dimensions than in two dimensions. We propose that\nthe greater efficiency of the convective engine found in three-dimensional\nsimulations might be due to the larger surface-to-volume ratio of convective\nplumes, which aids in distributing energy deposited by neutrinos.\n  We do not find evidence of the standing accretion shock instability nor\nturbulence being a key factor in powering the explosion in our models. Instead,\nthe analysis of the energy transport in the post-shock region reveals\ncharacteristics of penetrative convection. The explosion energy decreases\ndramatically once the resolution is inadequate to capture the morphology of\nconvection on large scales. This shows that the role of dimensionality is\nsecondary to correctly accounting for the basic physics of the explosion.\n  We also analyze information provided by particle tracers embedded in the\nflow, and find that the unbound material has relatively long residency times in\ntwo-dimensional models, while in three dimensions a significant fraction of the\nexplosion energy is carried by particles with relatively short residency times.\n", "  In this paper we study the production and decays of a light pseudoscalar\nboson $\\phi^0$ with $m_{\\phi^0} \\leq m_h/2$ appeared in the left-right twin\nHiggs (LRTH) model, and explore its phenomenological consequences when the\nlatest LHC Higgs data are taken into account. We found that (a) the decay rate\n$Br(h\\to \\phi^0\\phi^0)$ can be as large as $80\\%$ and can suppress\nsignificantly the visible $\\gamma\\gamma$ signal rate, but the latest LHC Higgs\ndata put a strong constraint on it: $Br(h \\to \\phi^0\\phi^0) \\leq 30\\%$ at\n$3\\sigma$ level; (b) the $p$-value of the LRTH model is around $0.6$, smaller\nthan that of the SM in most of the parameter space and approaches the SM value\n$0.8$ for a sufficiently large $f$ parameter; (c) the neutral pseudoscalar\n$\\phi^0$ dominantly decay into $b\\bar{b}$ and the decay rate $Br(\\phi^0\\to\nb\\bar{b})$ can be larger than $80\\%$ for $m_{\\phi^0}\\leq 60$ GeV, and the\nsecond main decay mode is $\\phi^0\\to \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$ with a branching ratio\nabout $14\\%$; and (d) at the future $e^-e^+$ collider with $\\sqrt{s}=250$ GeV,\nthe processes $e^{+}e^{-}\\to Zh\\to Z(\\phi^0\\phi^0)\\to Z(4b,2b2\\tau)$ are\npromising for discovering such a light pseudoscalar $\\phi^0$.\n", "  This paper shows that the variance of load bus voltage magnitude in a small\npower system test case increases monotonically as the system approaches a Hopf\nbifurcation. This property can potentially be used as a method for monitoring\noscillatory stability in power grid using high-resolution phasor measurements.\nIncreasing variance in data from a dynamical system is a common sign of a\nphenomenon known as critical slowing down (CSD). CSD is slower recovery of\ndynamical systems from perturbations as they approach critical transitions.\nEarlier work has focused on studying CSD in systems approaching voltage\ncollapse; In this paper, we investigate its occurrence as a power system\napproaches a Hopf bifurcation.\n", "  The superadiabatic quantum driving, producing a perfect adiabatic transfer on\na given Hamitonian by introducing an additional Hamiltonian, is theoretically\nanalysed for transfers within a three-level system. Our starting point is the\nstimulated Raman adiabatic passage, realized through different schemes of laser\npulses. We determine the superadiabatic correction for each scheme. The\nfidelity, robustness and transfer time of all the superadiabatic transfer\nschemes are discussed. We derive that all superadiabatic corrections are based\non a $\\pi$- (or near-$\\pi$)-area pulse coupling between the initial and final\nstates. The benefits in the protocol robustness overcome the difficulties\nassociated to the actual implementation of the three-level superadiabatic\ntransfer.\n", "  Large sensor-based infrastructures for radio astronomy will be among the most\nintensive data-driven projects in the world, facing very high power demands.\nThe geographically wide distribution of these infrastructures and their\nassociated processing High Performance Computing (HPC) facilities require Green\nInformation and Communications Technologies (ICT). A combination is needed of\nlow power computing, efficient data storage, local data services, Smart Grid\npower management, and inclusion of Renewable Energies. Here we outline the\nmajor characteristics and innovation approaches to address power efficiency and\nlong-term power sustainability for radio astronomy projects, focusing on Green\nICT for science.\n", "  The advent of synoptic sky surveys has spurred the development of techniques\nfor real-time classification of astronomical sources in order to ensure timely\nfollow-up with appropriate instruments. Previous work has focused on algorithm\nselection or improved light curve representations, and naively convert light\ncurves into structured feature sets without regard for the time span or phase\nof the light curves. In this paper, we highlight the violation of a fundamental\nmachine learning assumption that occurs when archival light curves with long\nobservational time spans are used to train classifiers that are applied to\nlight curves with fewer observations. We propose two solutions to deal with the\nmismatch in the time spans of training and test light curves. The first is the\nuse of classifier committees where each classifier is trained on light curves\nof different observational time spans. Only the committee member whose training\nset matches the test light curve time span is invoked for classification. The\nsecond solution uses hierarchical classifiers that are able to predict source\ntypes both individually and by sub-group, so that the user can trade-off an\nearlier, more robust classification with classification granularity. We test\nboth methods using light curves from the MACHO survey, and demonstrate their\nusefulness in improving performance over similar methods that naively train on\nall available archival data.\n", "  Since more than two years, the First G-APD Cherenkov Telescope (FACT) is\noperating successfully at the Canary Island of La Palma. Apart from its purpose\nto serve as a monitoring facility for the brightest TeV blazars, it was built\nas a major step to establish solid state photon counters as detectors in\nCherenkov astronomy.\n  The camera of the First G-APD Cherenkov Telesope comprises 1440 Geiger-mode\navalanche photo diodes (G-APD aka. MPPC or SiPM) for photon detection. Since\nproperties as the gain of G-APDs depend on temperature and the applied voltage,\na real-time feedback system has been developed and implemented. To correct for\nthe change introduced by temperature, several sensors have been placed close to\nthe photon detectors. Their read out is used to calculate a corresponding\nvoltage offset. In addition to temperature changes, changing current introduces\na voltage drop in the supporting resistor network. To correct changes in the\nvoltage drop introduced by varying photon flux from the night-sky background,\nthe current is measured and the voltage drop calculated. To check the stability\nof the G-APD properties, dark count spectra with high statistics have been\ntaken under different environmental conditions and been evaluated.\n  The maximum data rate delivered by the camera is about 240 MB/s. The recorded\ndata, which can exceed 1 TB in a moonless night, is compressed in real-time\nwith a proprietary loss-less algorithm. The performance is better than gzip by\nalmost a factor of two in compression ratio and speed. In total, two to three\nCPU cores are needed for data taking. In parallel, a quick-look analysis of the\nrecently recorded data is executed on a second machine. Its result is publicly\navailable within a few minutes after the data were taken.\n  [...]\n", "  We theoretically investigate the quantum correlations (in terms of\nconcurrence of indistinguishable electrons) in a prototype molecular system\n(hydrogen molecule). With the assistance of the standard approximations of the\nlinear combination of atomic orbitals and the configuration interaction methods\nwe describe the electronic wavefunction of the ground state of the H2 molecule.\nMoreover, we managed to find a rather simple analytic expression for the\nconcurrence (the most used measure of quantum entanglement) of the two\nelectrons when the molecule is in its lowest energy. We have found that\nconcurrence does not really show any relation to the construction of the\nchemical bond.\n", "  Macroscopic body is considered as a system, consisting of an infinite number\nof quantum particles. Mechanical motion of the system center of mass in\nphysical space is described, using Feynman's representation of the quantum\nevolution. It is shown that the center of mass of the system moves accordingly\nwith the minimum action principle if action functional is much higher then\nPlank's constant.\n", "  We calculate orbits, tidal radii, and bulge-bar and disk shocking destruction\nrates for 63 globular clusters in our Galaxy. Orbits are integrated in both an\naxisymmetric and a non-axisymmetric Galactic potential that includes a bar and\na 3D model for the spiral arms. With the use of a Monte Carlo scheme, we\nconsider in our simulations observational uncertainties in the kinematical data\nof the clusters. In the analysis of destruction rates due to the bulge-bar, we\nconsider the rigorous treatment of using the real Galactic cluster orbit,\ninstead of the usual linear trajectory employed in previous studies. We compare\nresults in both treatments. We find that the theoretical tidal radius computed\nin the nonaxisymmetric Galactic potential compares better with the observed\ntidal radius than that obtained in the axisymmetric potential. In both Galactic\npotentials, bulge-shocking destruction rates computed with a linear trajectory\nof a cluster at its perigalacticons give a good approximation to the result\nobtained with the real trajectory of the cluster. Bulge-shocking destruction\nrates for clusters with perigalacticons in the inner Galactic region are\nsmaller in the non-axisymmetric potential, as compared with those in the\naxisymmetric potential. For the majority of clusters with high orbital\neccentricities (e > 0.5), their total bulge+disk destruction rates are smaller\nin the non-axisymmetric potential.\n", "  The plasmonic structures exhibiting narrowband resonances (NBR) are of a\ngreat interest for various applications. We propose to use hysteresis behavior\nin a 1D system of nonlinear nanoresonators in order to achieve the NRB; the\nnonlinearity is provided by saturation of a two-level quantum system coupled\nwith the nanoresonators (nanolaser/spaser configuration). Quantum Dots (QD)\nwere assumed as quantum systems; their numerical parameters have been adopted\nfor estimations. Role of the loss compensation on the quality of the NBR is\nshown for below (under compensation) and above threshold (generating spasers)\noperation modes. Amplitude and phase detection schemes of the prospective\nexperimental realization are compared using the developed model. Possible\nsensor oriented applications of the proposed system are discussed.\n", "  The aim of the present paper is to study the dynamics of a dumbbell satellite\nmoving in a gravity field generated by an oblate body considering the effect of\nthe zonal harmonic parameter. We prove that the pass trajectory of the mass\ncenter of the system is periodic and different from the classical one when the\neffect of the zonal harmonic parameter is non zero. Moreover, we complete the\nclassical theory show- ing that the equations of motion in the satellite\napproximation can be reduced to Beletsky's equation when the zonal harmonic\nparameter is zero. The main tool for proving these results is the\nLindstedt{Poincare's technique.\n", "  We analyze the non-Markovianity degree for random unitary evolution of\nd-level quantum systems. It is shown how non-Markovianity degree is\ncharacterized in terms of local decoherence rates. In particular we derive a\nsufficient condition for vanishing of the back ow of information.\n", "  We study the collective electron dynamics in C60 clusters within the Time\nDependent Thomas Fermi method in the frame of jellium model. The results\nregarding the optical spectrum are in good agreement with the experimental\ndata, our simulations being able to reproduce both resonances from 20eV and\n40eV . We compare also, the results with those from other theoretical\napproaches and investigate the implications of quantum effects including\nexchange-correlation corrections, or gradient corrections from a Weizsacker\nterm. The nature of the second resonance is studied using transition densities\nand analysing the probability current amplitudes.\n", "  The generalized tight-binding model, based on the subenvelope functions of\ndistinct sublattices, is developed to investigate the magnetic quantization in\nsliding bilayer graphenes. The relative shift of two graphene layers induces a\ndramatic transformation between the Dirac-cone structure and the parabolic band\nstructure, and thus leads to drastic changes of Landau levels (LLs) in the\nspatial symmetry, initial formation energy, intergroup anti-crossing, state\ndegeneracy and semiconductor-metal transition. There exist three kinds of LLs,\ni.e., well-behaved, perturbed and undefined LLs, which are characterized by a\nspecific mode, a main mode plus side modes, and a disordered mode,\nrespectively. Such LLs are clearly revealed in diverse magneto-optical\nselection rules. Specially, the undefined LLs frequently exhibit intergroup\nanti-crossings in the field-dependent energy spectra, and show a large number\nof absorption peaks without optical selection rules.\n", "  We have studied the dynamics of a spin-torque nanooscillator's (STNO) phase\nlocked loop (PLL) generating microwave oscillations in a broad range of\nfrequencies under the effect of direct current and external magnetic field.\nBifurcations in the system caused by a change in the frequency detuning of\nsynchronized oscillations are considered. Bands of phase locking and\nsynchronism are determined. The existence of a phase locking band in the\nfilterless PLL of STNOs basically distinguishes these oscillators from other\ntypes of microwave generators.\n", "  It was shown recently that entanglement of identical particles has a feature\ncalled dualism [Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 140404 (2013)], which is fundamentally\nconnected with quantum indistinguishability. Here we report an experiment that\nobserves the entanglement duality for the first time with two identical\nphotons, which manifest polarization entanglement when labeled by different\npaths or path entanglement when labeled by polarization states. By adjusting\nthe mismatch in frequency or arrival time of the entangled photons, we tune the\nphoton indistinguishability from quantum to classical limit and observe that\nthe entanglement duality disappears under emergence of classical\ndistinguishability, confirming it as a characteristic feature of quantum\nindistinguishable particles.\n", "  We use Schwinger Bosons as prepotentials for lattice gauge theory to define\nlocal linking oper- ators and calculate their action on linking states for 2 +\n1 dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory. We develop a diagrammatic technique\nand associate a set of (lattice Feynman) rules to compute the entire loop\ndynamics diagrammatically. The physical loop space is shown to contain only\nnon- intersecting loop configurations after solving the Mandelstam constraint.\nThe smallest plaquette loops are contained in the physical loop space and other\nconfigurations are generated by the action of a set of fusion operators on this\nbasic loop states enabling one to charaterize any arbitrary loop by the basic\nplaquette together with the fusion variables. Consequently, the full\nKogut-Susskind Hamiltonian and the dynamics of all possible non-intersecting\nphysical loops are formulated in terms of these fusion variables.\n", "  The paper aims to spell out the relevance of the Berry phase in view of the\nquestion what the minimal mathematical structure is that accounts for all\nobservable quantum phenomena. The question is both of conceptual and of\nontological interest. While common wisdom tells us that the quantum structure\nis represented by the structure of the projective Hilbert space, the\nappropriate structure rich enough to account for the Berry phase is the U(1)\nbundle over that projective space. The Berry phase is ultimately rooted in the\ncurvature of this quantum bundle, it cannot be traced back to the Hamiltonian\ndynamics alone. This motivates the ontological claim in the final part of the\npaper that, if one strives for a realistic understanding of quantum theory\nincluding the Berry phase, one should adopt a form of ontic structural realism.\n", "  The Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) is a new low frequency interferometric\nradio telescope, operating in the remote Murchison Radio Observatory in Western\nAustralia. In this paper we present the first MWA observations of the well\nknown radio relics in Abell 3667 (A3667) between 120 and 226 MHz. We clearly\ndetect the radio relics in A3667 and present flux estimates and spectral\nindices for these features. The average spectral index of the north-west (NW)\nand south-east (SE) relics is -0.9 +/- 0.1 between 120 and 1400 MHz. We are\nable to resolve spatial variation in the spectral index of the NW relic from\n-1.7 to -0.4, which is consistent with results found at higher frequencies.\n", "  Bioclimate-driven regression analysis is a widely used approach for modelling\necological niches and zonation. Although the bioclimatic complexity of the\nEuropean continent is high, a particular combination of 12 climatic and\ntopographic covariates was recently found able to reliably reproduce the\necological zoning of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United\nNations (FAO) for forest resources assessment at pan-European scale, generating\nthe first fuzzy similarity map of FAO ecozones in Europe. The reproducible\nprocedure followed to derive this collection of bioclimatic indices is now\npresented. It required an integration of data-transformation modules (D-TM)\nusing geospatial tools such as Geographic Information System (GIS) software,\nand array-based mathematical implementation such as semantic array programming\n(SemAP). Base variables, intermediate and final covariates are described and\nsemantically defined by providing the workflow of D-TMs and the mathematical\nformulation following the SemAP notation. Source layers to derive base\nvariables were extracted by exclusively relying on global-scale public open\ngeodata in order for the same set of bioclimatic covariates to be reproducible\nin any region worldwide. In particular, two freely available datasets were\nexploited for temperature and precipitation (WorldClim) and elevation (Global\nMulti-resolution Terrain Elevation Data). The working extent covers the\nEuropean continent to the Urals with a resolution of 30 arc-second. The\nproposed set of bioclimatic covariates will be made available as open data in\nthe European Forest Data Centre (EFDAC). The forthcoming complete set of D-TM\ncodelets will enable the 12 covariates to be easily reproduced and expanded\nthrough free software.\n", "  The Cooperative Motion Algorithm is an efficient lattice method to simulate\ndense polymer systems and is often used with two different criteria to generate\na Markov chain in the configuration space. While the first method is the\nwell-established Metropolis algorithm, the other one is an heuristic algorithm\nwhich needs justification. As an introductory step towards justification for\nthe 3D lattice polymers, we study a simple system which is the binary equimolar\nuid on a 2D triangular lattice. Since all lattice sites are occupied only\nselected type of motions are considered, such the vacancy movements, swapping\nneighboring lattice sites (Kawasaki dynamics) and cooperative loops. We compare\nboth methods, calculating the energy as well as heat capacity as a function of\ntemperature. The critical temperature, which was determined using the Binder\ncumulant, was the same for all methods with the simulation accuracy and in\nagreement with the exact critical temperature for the Ising model on the 2D\ntriangular lattice. In order to achieve reliable results at low temperatures we\nemploy the parallel tempering algorithm which enables simultaneous simulations\nof replicas of the system in a wide range of temperatures.\n", "  Effective data visualization is a key part of the discovery process in the\nera of big data. It is the bridge between the quantitative content of the data\nand human intuition, and thus an essential component of the scientific path\nfrom data into knowledge and understanding. Visualization is also essential in\nthe data mining process, directing the choice of the applicable algorithms, and\nin helping to identify and remove bad data from the analysis. However, a high\ncomplexity or a high dimensionality of modern data sets represents a critical\nobstacle. How do we visualize interesting structures and patterns that may\nexist in hyper-dimensional data spaces? A better understanding of how we can\nperceive and interact with multi dimensional information poses some deep\nquestions in the field of cognition technology and human computer interaction.\nTo this effect, we are exploring the use of immersive virtual reality platforms\nfor scientific data visualization, both as software and inexpensive commodity\nhardware. These potentially powerful and innovative tools for multi dimensional\ndata visualization can also provide an easy and natural path to a collaborative\ndata visualization and exploration, where scientists can interact with their\ndata and their colleagues in the same visual space. Immersion provides benefits\nbeyond the traditional desktop visualization tools: it leads to a demonstrably\nbetter perception of a datascape geometry, more intuitive data understanding,\nand a better retention of the perceived relationships in the data.\n", "  Wigner's argument inferring Bell-type inequality for the EPR-Bohm entangled\nstate is generalized here for any N-partite state. This is based on assuming\nfor the relevant dichotomic observables the existence of the overall joint\nprobability distributions, satisfying the locality condition, that would yield\nthe measurable marginal probabilities. For any N, such Generalized Wigner's\nInequality (GWI) is violated by quantum mechanics for all pure entangled\nstates. The efficacy of GWI is probed, comparing with the Seevinck-Svetlichny\nmultipartite Bell-type inequality, by calculating threshold visibilities for\nthe quadripartite GHZ, Cluster andWstates that determine their respective\nrobustness with respect to the quantum mechanical violation of GWI in the\npresence of white noise.\n", "  In this series of papers, we investigate the projective framework initiated\nby Jerzy Kijowski and Andrzej Oko{\\l}\\'ow, which describes the states of a\nquantum (field) theory as projective families of density matrices. The present\nfirst paper aims at clarifying the classical structures that underlies this\nformalism, namely projective limits of symplectic manifolds. In particular,\nthis allows us to discuss accurately the issues hindering an easy\nimplementation of the dynamics in this context, and to formulate a strategy for\novercoming them.\n", "  We fabricated thin-films made from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) with embedded\nhigh-index (n~1.9-2.2) microspheres for super-resolution imaging applications.\nTo control the position of microspheres, such films can be translated along the\nsurface of the nanoplasmonic structure to be imaged. Microsphere-assisted\nimaging, through these matrices, provided lateral resolution of ~{\\lambda}/7 in\nnanoplasmonic dimer arrays with an illuminating wavelength {\\lambda}=405 nm.\nSuch thin films can be used as contact optical components to boost the\nresolution capability of conventional microscopes.\n", "  Among composite-dark-matter scenarios, one of the simplest and most\npredictive is that of O-helium (OHe) dark atoms, in which a lepton-like doubly\ncharged particle O is bound with a primordial helium nucleus, and is the main\nconstituent of dark matter. This model liberates the physics of dark matter\nfrom many unknown features of new physics, and it demands a deep understanding\nof the details of known nuclear and atomic physics, which are still somewhat\nunclear in the case of nuclear interacting \"atomic\" shells. So far the model\nhas relied on the dominance of elastic scattering of OHe with the matter. In\nview of the uncertainty in our understanding of OHe interaction with nuclei we\nstudy the opposite scenario, in which inelastic nuclear reactions dominate the\nOHe interactions with nuclei. We show that in this case all the OHe atoms bind\nwith extra He nuclei, forming doubly charged O-beryllium ions, which behave\nlike anomalous helium, causing potential problems with overabundance of\nanomalous isotopes in terrestrial matter.\n", "  The concept of symmetry breaking and the emergence of corresponding local\norder parameters constitute the pillars of modern day many body physics. The\ntheory of quantum entanglement is currently leading to a paradigm shift in\nunderstanding quantum correlations in many body systems and in this work we\nshow how symmetry breaking can be understood from this wavefunction centered\npoint of view. We demonstrate that the existence of symmetry breaking is a\nconsequence of the geometric structure of the convex set of reduced density\nmatrices of all possible many body wavefunctions. The surfaces of those convex\nbodies exhibit non-analytic behavior in the form of ruled surfaces, which turn\nout to be the defining signatures for the emergence of symmetry breaking and of\nan associated order parameter.\n  We illustrate this by plotting the convex sets arising in the context of\nthree paradigmatic examples of many body systems exhibiting symmetry breaking:\nthe quantum Ising model in transverse magnetic field, exhibiting a second order\nquantum phase transition; the classical Ising model at finite temperature in\ntwo dimensions, which orders below a critical temperature $T_c$; and a system\nof free bosons at finite temperature in three dimensions, exhibiting the\nphenomenon of Bose-Einstein condensation together with an associated order\nparameter $\\langle\\psi\\rangle$. Remarkably, these convex sets look all very\nmuch alike. We believe that this wavefunction based way of looking at phase\ntransitions demystifies the emergence of order parameters and provides a unique\nnovel tool for studying exotic quantum phenomena.\n", "  Recent years have witnessed growing interest in the use of Artificial Neural\nNetworks (ANNs) for vision, classification, and inference problems. An\nartificial neuron sums N weighted inputs and passes the result through a\nnon-linear transfer function. Large-scale ANNs impose very high computing\nrequirements for training and classification, leading to great interest in the\nuse of post-CMOS devices to realize them in an energy efficient manner. In this\npaper, we propose a spin-transfer-torque (STT) device based on Domain Wall\nMotion (DWM) magnetic strip that can efficiently implement a Soft-limiting\nNon-linear Neuron (SNN) operating at ultra-low supply voltage and current. In\ncontrast to previous spin-based neurons that can only realize hard-limiting\ntransfer functions, the proposed STT-SNN displays a continuous resistance\nchange with varying input current, and can therefore be employed to implement a\nsoft-limiting neuron transfer function. Soft-limiting neurons are greatly\npreferred to hard-limiting ones due to their much improved modeling capacity,\nwhich leads to higher network accuracy and lower network complexity. We also\npresent an ANN hardware design employing the proposed STT-SNNs and Memristor\nCrossbar Arrays (MCA) as synapses. The ultra-low voltage operation of the\nmagneto metallic STT-SNN enables the programmable MCA-synapses, computing\nanalog-domain weighted summation of input voltages, to also operate at\nultra-low voltage. We modeled the STT-SNN using micro-magnetic simulation and\nevaluated them using an ANN for character recognition. Comparisons with analog\nand digital CMOS neurons show that STT-SNNs can achieve more than two orders of\nmagnitude lower energy consumption.\n", "  As CMOS nears the end of the projected scaling roadmap, significant effort\nhas been devoted to the search for new materials and devices that can realize\nmemory and logic. Spintronics, is one of the promising directions for the\nPost-CMOS era. While the potential of spintronic memories is relatively well\nknown, realizing logic remains an open and critical challenge. All Spin Logic\n(ASL) is a recently proposed logic style that realizes Boolean logic using\nspin-transfer-torque (STT) devices based on the principle of non-local spin\ntorque. ASL has advantages such as density, non-volatility, and low operating\nvoltage. However, it also suffers from drawbacks such as low speed and static\npower dissipation. Recent work has shown that, in the context of simple\narithmetic circuits (adders, multipliers), the efficiency of ASL can be greatly\nimproved using techniques that utilize its unique characteristics. An\nevaluation of ASL across a broad range of circuits, considering the known\noptimization techniques, is an important next step in determining its\nviability. In this work, we propose a systematic methodology for the synthesis\nof ASL circuits. Our methodology performs various optimizations that benefit\nASL, such as intra-cycle power gating, stacking of ASL nanomagnets, and\nfine-grained logic pipelining. We utilize the proposed methodology to evaluate\nthe suitability of ASL implementations for a wide range of benchmarks viz.\nrandom combinational and sequential logic, digital signal processing circuits,\nand the Leon SPARC3 general-purpose processor. Based on our evaluation, we\nidentify (i) the large current requirement of nanomagnets at fast switching\nspeeds, (ii) the static power dissipation in the all-metallic devices, and\n(iii) the short spin flip length in interconnects as key bottlenecks that limit\nthe competitiveness of ASL.\n", "  In a recent preprint [arXiv:1412.2677] Richard Gill has criticized an\nexperimental proposal published in a journal of theoretical physics which\ndescribes how to detect a macroscopic signature of fermionic sign changes. Here\nI point out that Gill's worries stem from his own elementary algebraic and\nconceptual mistakes, and present several event-by-event numerical simulations\nwhich bring out his mistakes by explicit computations.\n", "  This paper presents the physical concept and test results of sample data of\nthe high-speed hardware true random number generator design based on typically\nused for High Energy Physics hardware. Main features of this concept are the\nhigh speed of the true random numbers generation (tens of Mbt/s), miniature\nsize and estimated lower production cost. This allows the use of such a device\nnot only in large companies and government offices but for the end-user data\ncryptography, in classrooms, in scientific Monte-Carlo simulations, computer\ngames and any other place where large number of true random numbers is\nrequired. The physics of the operations principle of using a Geiger-mode\navalanche photo detector is discussed and the high quality of the data\ncollected is demonstrated.\n", "  This paper presents a novel circuit level model that explains and confirms\nthe extra combinational delays in a SRAM-FPGA (Virtex-5) due to radiation,\nwhich matches the experimental results by proton irradiation at TRIUMF.\n", "  Nonlinear spatial encoding magnetic (SEM) fields have been studied to\ncomplement multichannel RF encoding and accelerate MRI scans. Published schemes\ninclude PatLoc, O-Space, Null Space, 4D-RIO, and others, but the large variety\nof possible approaches to exploiting nonlinear SEMs remains mostly unexplored.\nBefore, we have presented a new approach, Fast ROtary Nonlinear Spatial\nACquisition (FRONSAC) imaging, where the nonlinear fields provide a small\nrotating perturbation to standard linear trajectories. While FRONSAC encoding\ngreatly improves image quality, at the highest accelerations or weakest FRONSAC\nfields, some undersampling artifacts remain. However, the under-sampling\nartifacts that occur with FRONSAC encoding are relatively incoherent and well\nsuited to the compressed sensing (CS) reconstruction. CS provides a\nsparsity-promoting convex strategy to reconstruct images from highly\nundersampled datasets. The work presented here combines the benefits of FRONSAC\nand CS. Simulations illustrate that this combination can further improve image\nreconstruction with FRONSAC gradients of low amplitudes and frequencies.\n", "  In the joule balance developed at National Institute of Metrology (NIM), the\ndynamic phase of a watt balance is replaced by the mutual inductance\nmeasurement in an attempt to provide an alternative method for the kg\nredefinition. But for this method a rather large current in the exciting coil,\nis needed to offer the necessary magnetic field in the force weighing phase,\nand the coil heating becomes an important uncertainty source. To reduce coil\nheating, a new coil system, in which a ferromagnetic material is used to\nincrease the magnetic field was designed recently. But adopting the\nferromagnetic material brings the difficulty from the nonlinear characteristic\nof material. This problem can be removed by measuring the magnetic flux linkage\ndifference of the suspended coil at two vertical positions directly to replace\nthe mutual inductance parameter. Some systematic effects of this magnet are\ndiscussed.\n", "  Sampling errors are inevitable when measuring the ocean; thus, to achieve a\ntrustable set of observations requires a quality control (QC) procedure capable\nto detect spurious data. While manual QC by human experts minimizes errors, it\nis inefficient to handle large datasets and vulnerable to inconsistencies\nbetween different experts. Although automatic QC circumvents those issues, the\ntraditional methods results in high rates of false positives. Here, I propose a\nnovel approach to automatically QC oceanographic data based on the anomaly\ndetection technique. Multiple tests are combined into a single,\nmultidimensional criterion that learns the behavior of the good measurements,\nand identifies bad samples as outliers. When applied to 13 years of\nhydrographic profiles, the anomaly detection resulted in the best\nclassification performance, reducing the error by at least 50%. An open source\nPython package, CoTeDe, was developed to provide state of the art tools to\nquality control oceanographic data.\n", "  Generally, social network analysis has often focused on the topology of the\nnetwork without considering the characteristics of individuals involved in\nthem. Less attention is given to study the behavior of individuals, considering\nthey are the basic entity of a graph. Given a mobile social network graph, what\nare good features to extract key information from the nodes? How many distinct\nneighborhood patterns exist for ego nodes? What clues does such information\nprovide to study nodes over a long period of time?\n  In this report, we develop an automated system in order to discover the\noccurrences of prototypical ego-centric patterns from data. We aim to provide a\ndata-driven instrument to be used in behavioral sciences for graph\ninterpretations. We analyze social networks derived from real-world data\ncollected with smart-phones. We select 13 well-known network measures,\nespecially those concerned with ego graphs. We form eight feature subsets and\nthen assess their performance using unsupervised clustering techniques to\ndiscover distinguishing ego-centric patterns. From clustering analysis, we\ndiscover that eight distinct neighborhood patterns have emerged. This\ncategorization allows concise analysis of users' data as they change over time.\nThe results provide a fine-grained analysis for the contribution of different\nfeature sets to detect unique clustering patterns. Last, as a case study, two\ndatasets are studied over long periods to demonstrate the utility of this\nmethod. The study shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach in\ndiscovering important trends from data.\n", "  We prove that a harmonic oscillator driven by Lindblad dynamics where the\ntypical drive and loss channels are two-photon processes instead of\nsingle-photon ones, converges to a protected subspace spanned by two coherent\nstates of opposite amplitude. We then characterize the slow dynamics induced by\na perturbative single-photon loss on this protected subspace, by performing\nadiabatic elimination in the Lindbladian dynamics.\n", "  We discuss the procedure of extracting the photoproduction cross section for\nneutral pseudoscalar mesons off neutrons from deuteron data. The main statement\nis that the final-state interaction (FSI) corrections for the proton and\nneutron target are in general not equal, but for pi0 production there are\nspecial cases were they have to be identical and there are large regions in the\nparameter space of incident photon energy and pion polar angle, \\theta^*, where\nthey happen to be quite similar. The corrections for both target nucleons are\npractically identical for $\\pi_0$ production in the energy range of the\nDelta(1232)3/2+ resonance due to the specific isospin structure of this\nexcitation. Also above the $\\Delta$-isobar range large differences between\nproton and neutron correction factors are only predicted for extreme forward\nangles ($\\theta^*$ < 20 deg), but the results are similar for larger angles.\nNumerical results for the gp-->pi0p and gn-->pi0n correction factors are\ndiscussed. Also the model description for the available data on the\ndifferential gd-->pi0pn cross sections are given.\n", "  The interaction of Stone-Wales topological defects in graphene has been\nstudied through computer simulation. This simulation has revealed\nconfigurations of two defects with energies below the energy of a monolayer\nwith two spaced defects. This indicates the attraction between defects and the\npossibility of the formation of their clusters. The attraction is due to the\ninterference between defect-induced wavy distortions of the structure of the\nmonolayer. In this case, the amplitude of transverse displacement of atoms near\na pair of defects reaches 2-3 angstroms. Such a strong deformation of graphene\nby Stone-Wales defects can be one of the reasons for its experimentally\nobserved \"crumpled\" texture.\n", "  Visible light communication (VLC) has become a promising research topic in\nrecent years, and finds its wide applications in indoor environments.\nParticularly, for location based services (LBS), visible light also provides a\npractical solution for indoor positioning. Multipath-induced dispersion is one\nof the major concerns for complex indoor environments. It affects not only the\ncommunication performance but also the positioning accuracy. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the impact of multipath reflections on the positioning accuracy of\nindoor VLC positioning systems. Combined Deterministic and Modified Monte Carlo\n(CDMMC) approach is applied to estimate the channel impulse response\nconsidering multipath reflections. Since the received signal strength (RSS)\ninformation is used for the positioning algorithm, the power distribution from\none transmitter in a typical room configuration is first calculated. Then, the\npositioning accuracy in terms of root mean square error is obtained and\nanalyzed.\n", "  Visible light communications (VLC) have recently attracted a growing interest\nand can be a potential solution to realize indoor wireless communication with\nhigh bandwidth capacity for RF-restricted environments such as airplanes and\nhospitals. Optical based orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)\nsystems have been proposed in the literature to combat multipath distortion and\nintersymbol interference (ISI) caused by multipath signal propagation. In this\npaper, we present a robust timing synchronization scheme suitable for\nasymmetrically clipped (AC) OFDM based optical intensity modulated direct\ndetection (IM/DD) wireless systems. Our proposed method works perfectly for\nACO-OFDM, Pulse amplitude modulated discrete multitone (PAM-DMT) and discrete\nHartley transform (DHT) based optical OFDM systems. In contrast to existing\nOFDM timing synchronization methods which are either not suitable for AC OFDM\ntechniques due to unipolar nature of output signal or perform poorly, our\nproposed method is suitable for AC OFDM schemes and outperforms all other\navailable techniques. Both numerical and experimental results confirm the\naccuracy of the proposed method. Our technique is also computationally\nefficient as it requires very few computations as compared to conventional\nmethods in order to achieve good accuracy.\n", "  Function optimization and finding simultaneous solutions of a system of\nnonlinear equations (SNE) are two closely related and important optimization\nproblems. However, unlike in the case of function optimization in which one is\nrequired to find the global minimum and sometimes local minima, a database of\nchallenging SNEs where one is required to find stationary points (extrama and\nsaddle points) is not readily available. In this article, we initiate building\nsuch a database of important SNE (which also includes related function\noptimization problems), arising from Science, Engineering and Economics. After\nproviding a short review of the most commonly used mathematical and\ncomputational approaches to find solutions of such systems, we provide a\npreliminary list of challenging problems by writing the Mathematical\nformulation down, briefly explaning the origin and importance of the problem\nand giving a short account on the currently known results, for each of the\nproblems. We anticipate that this database will not only help benchmarking\nnovel numerical methods for solving SNEs and function optimization problems but\nalso will help advancing the corresponding research areas.\n", "  The key rate of the B92 quantum key distribution protocol had not been\nreported before this research when the number of qubits is finite. We compute\nit by using the security analysis framework proposed by Scarani and Renner in\n2008.\n", "  This paper is concerned with a translation invariant network of identical\nquantum stochastic systems subjected to external quantum noise. Each node of\nthe network is directly coupled to a finite number of its neighbours. This\nnetwork is modelled as an open quantum harmonic oscillator and is governed by a\nset of linear quantum stochastic differential equations. The dynamic variables\nof the network satisfy the canonical commutation relations. Similar large-scale\nnetworks can be found, for example, in quantum metamaterials and optical\nlattices. Using spatial Fourier transform techniques, we obtain a sufficient\ncondition for stability of the network in the case of finite interaction range,\nand consider a mean square performance index for the stable network in the\nthermodynamic limit. The Peres-Horodecki-Simon separability criterion is\nemployed in order to obtain sufficient and necessary conditions for quantum\nentanglement of bipartite systems of nodes of the network in the Gaussian\ninvariant state. The results on stability and entanglement are extended to the\ninfinite chain of the linear quantum systems by letting the number of nodes go\nto infinity. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the results.\n", "  Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) is a rapidly emerging bioimaging\nmodality that seeks to reconstruct an estimate of the absorbed optical energy\ndensity within an object. Conventional PACT image reconstruction methods assume\na constant speed-of-sound (SOS), which can result in image artifacts when\nacoustic aberrations are significant. It has been demonstrated that\nincorporating knowledge of an object's SOS distribution into a PACT image\nreconstruction method can improve image quality. However, in many cases, the\nSOS distribution cannot be accurately and/or conveniently estimated prior to\nthe PACT experiment. Because variations in the SOS distribution induce\naberrations in the measured photoacoustic wavefields, certain information\nregarding an object's SOS distribution is encoded in the PACT measurement data.\nBased on this observation, a joint reconstruction (JR) problem has been\nproposed in which the SOS distribution is concurrently estimated along with the\nsought-after absorbed optical energy density from the photoacoustic measurement\ndata. A broad understanding of the extent to which the JR problem can be\naccurately and reliably solved has not been reported. In this work, a series of\nnumerical experiments is described that elucidate some important properties of\nthe JR problem that pertain to its practical feasibility. To accomplish this,\nan optimization-based formulation of the JR problem is developed that yields a\nnon-linear iterative algorithm that alternatingly updates the two image\nestimates. Heuristic analytic insights into the reconstruction problem are also\nprovided. These results confirm the ill-conditioned nature of the joint\nreconstruction problem that will present significant challenges for practical\napplications.\n", "  An interrelation between a topological design of network and efficient\nalgorithm on it is important for its applications to communication or\ntransportation systems. In this paper, we propose a design principle for a\nreliable routing in a store-carry-forward manner based on autonomously moving\nmessage-ferries on a special structure of fractal-like network, which consists\nof a self-similar tiling of equilateral triangles. As a collective adaptive\nmechanism, the routing is realized by a relay of cyclic message-ferries\ncorresponded to a concatenation of the triangle cycles and using some good\nproperties of the network structure. It is recoverable for local accidents in\nthe hierarchical network structure. Moreover, the design principle is\ntheoretically supported with a calculation method for the optimal service rates\nof message-ferries derived from a tandem queue model for stochastic processes\non a chain of edges in the network. These results obtained from a combination\nof complex network science and computer science will be useful for developing a\nresilient network system.\n", "  We derive a rigorous classification of topologically stable Fermi surfaces of\nnon-interacting, discrete translation-invariant systems from electronic band\ntheory, adiabatic evolution and their topological interpretations. For systems\non an infinite crystal it is shown that there can only be topologically\nunstable Fermi surfaces. For systems on a half- space and with a gapped bulk,\nour derivation naturally yields a $\\mathit{K}$-theory classification. Given the\n$d-1$-dimensional surface Brillouin zone $\\mathrm{X}_{s}$ of a $d$-dimensional\nhalf-space, our result implies that different classes of globally stable Fermi\nsurfaces belong in $\\mathit{K^{-1}}\\mathrm{(X_{s})}$ for systems with only\ndiscrete translation-invariance. This result has a chiral anomaly inflow\ninterpretation, as it reduces to the spectral flow for $d = 2$. Through\nequivariant homotopy methods we extend these results for symmetry classes\n$AI,\\,AII,\\, C$ and $D$ and discuss their corresponding anomaly inflow\ninterpretation.\n", "  Temporal steering and violation of the Leggett-Garg inequality are two\ndifferent ways of probing the violation of macro-realistic assumptions in\nquantum mechanics. It is shown here that under unitary evolution and projective\nmeasurements the two types of temporal correlations lead to similar results.\nHowever, their inequivalence may be exhibited if either one of them is relaxed,\ni.e., by employing either generalized measurements, or noisy evolution, as we\nshow here using relevant examples.\n", "  Attenuation of ultrasound often follows near power laws which cannot be\nmodeled with conventional viscous or relaxation wave equations. The same is\noften the case for shear wave propagation in tissue also.\n  More general temporal memory operators in the wave equation can describe such\nbehavior. They can be justified in four ways: 1) Power laws for attenuation\nwith exponents other than two correspond to the use of convolution operators\nwith a temporal memory kernel which is a power law in time. 2) The\ncorresponding constitutive equation is also a convolution, often with a\ntemporal power law function. 3) It is also equivalent to an infinite set of\nrelaxation processes which can be formulated via the complex compressibility.\n4) The constitutive equation can also be expressed as an infinite sum of higher\norder derivatives.\n  An extension to longitudinal waves in a nonlinear medium is also provided.\n", "  Artificial gauge fields for neutral particles such as photons, recently\nattracted a lot of attention in various fields ranging from photonic crystals\nto ultracold atoms in optical lattices to optomechanical arrays. Here we point\nout that, among all implementations of gauge fields, the optomechanical setting\nallows for the most natural extension where the gauge field becomes dynamical.\nThe mechanical oscillation phases determine the effective artificial magnetic\nfield for the photons, and once these phases are allowed to evolve, they\nrespond to the flow of photons in the structure. We discuss a simple three-site\nmodel where we identify four different regimes of the gauge-field dynamics.\nFurthermore, we extend the discussion to a two-dimensional lattice. Our\nproposed scheme could for instance be implemented using optomechanical\ncrystals.\n", "  The conceptual design study of a hadron Future Circular Collider (FCC-hh)\nwith a center-of-mass energy of the order of 100 TeV in a new tunnel of 80-100\nkm circumference assumes the determination of the basic requirements for its\ndetectors. A superconducting solenoid magnet of 12 m diameter inner bore with\nthe central magnetic flux density of 6 T is proposed for a FCC-hh experimental\nsetup. The coil of 24.518 m long has seven 3.5 m long modules included into one\ncryostat. The steel yoke with a mass of 21 kt consists of two barrel layers of\n0.5 m radial thickness, and 0.7 m thick nose disk, four 0.6 m thick end-cap\ndisks, and three 0.8 m thick muon toroid disks each side. The outer diameter of\nthe yoke is 17.7 m; the length without the forward muon toroids is 33 m. The\nair gaps between the end-cap disks provide the installation of the muon\nchambers up to the pseudorapidity of \\pm 3.5. The conventional forward muon\nspectrometer provides the measuring of the muon momenta in the pseudorapidity\nregion from \\pm 2.7 to \\pm 4.6. The magnet modeled with Cobham's program TOSCA.\nThe total Ampere-turns in the superconducting solenoid coil are 127.25\nMA-turns. The stored energy is 43.3 GJ. The axial force onto each end-cap is\n480 MN. The stray field at the radius of 50 m off the coil axis is 14.1 mT and\n5.4 mT at the radius of 100 m. All other parameters presented and discussed.\n", "  The paper presents a general geometric approach to energy-momentum tensors in\nLagrangian field theories, based on a Hilbert-type definition. The approach is\nconsistent with the ones defining energy-momentum tensors in terms of\nhypermomentum maps given by the diffeomorphism invariance of the Lagrangian -\nand, in a sense, complementary to these, with the advantage of an increased\nsimplicity of proofs and also, opening up new insights into the topic. A\nspecial attention is paid to the particular cases of metric and metric-affine\ntheories.\n", "  Big Data are revolutionizing nearly every aspect of the modern society. One\narea where this can have a profound positive societal impact is the field of\nHealth Care Informatics (HCI), which faces many challenges. The key idea behind\nthis study is: can we use some of the experience and technical and\nmethodological solutions from the fields that have successfully adapted to the\nBig Data era, namely astronomy and space science, to help accelerate the\nprogress of HCI? We illustrate this with examples from the Virtual Observatory\nframework, and the NCI EDRN project. An effective sharing and reuse of tools,\nmethods, and experiences from different fields can save a lot of effort, time,\nand expense. HCI can thus benefit from the proven solutions to big data\nchallenges from other domains.\n", "  Given an arbitrary $2^w \\times 2^w$ unitary matrix $U$, a powerful matrix\ndecomposition can be applied, leading to four different syntheses of a\n$w$-qubit quantum circuit performing the unitary transformation. The\ndemonstration is based on a recent theorem by F\\\"uhr and Rzeszotnik,\ngeneralizing the scaling of single-bit unitary gates ($w=1$) to gates with\narbitrary value of~$w$. The synthesized circuit consists of controlled 1-qubit\ngates, such as NEGATOR gates and PHASOR gates. Interestingly, the approach\nreduces to a known synthesis method for classical logic circuits consisting of\ncontrolled NOT gates, in the case that $U$ is a permutation matrix.\n", "  Markovian reservoir engineering, in which time evolution of a quantum system\nis governed by a Lindblad master equation, is a powerful technique in studies\nof quantum phases of matter and quantum information. It can be used to drive a\nquantum system to a desired (unique) steady state, which can be an exotic phase\nof matter difficult to stabilize in nature. It can also be used to drive a\nsystem to a unitarily-evolving subspace, which can be used to store, protect,\nand process quantum information. In this paper, we derive a formula for the map\ncorresponding to asymptotic (infinite-time) Lindbladian evolution and use it to\nstudy several important features of the unique state and subspace cases. We\nquantify how subspaces retain information about initial states and show how to\nuse Lindbladians to simulate any quantum channels. We show that the quantum\ninformation in all subspaces can be successfully manipulated by small\nHamiltonian perturbations, jump operator perturbations, or adiabatic\ndeformations. We provide a Lindblad-induced notion of distance between\nadiabatically connected subspaces. We derive a Kubo formula governing linear\nresponse of subspaces to time-dependent Hamiltonian perturbations and determine\ncases in which this formula reduces to a Hamiltonian-based Kubo formula. As an\napplication, we show that (for gapped systems) the zero-frequency Hall\nconductivity is unaffected by many types of Markovian dissipation. Finally, we\nshow that the energy scale governing leakage out of the subspaces, resulting\nfrom either Hamiltonian/jump-operator perturbations or corrections to adiabatic\nevolution, is different from the conventional Lindbladian dissipative gap and,\nin certain cases, is equivalent to the excitation gap of a related Hamiltonian.\n", "  In the weak measurement (WM) scenario involving weak interaction and\npostselection by projective measurement, the empirical significance of weak\nvalues is manifested in terms of shifts in the measurement pointer's mean\nposition and mean momentum. In this context, a general quantitative treatment\nis presented in this paper by taking into account the hitherto unexplored\neffect of correlations among the pointer degrees of freedom which pertain to an\narbitrary multidimensional preselected pointer state. This leads to an\nextension of the earlier results, showing that, for complex weak values, the\ncorrelations among different pointer degrees of freedom can crucially affect\nthe way the imaginary parts of the weak values are related to the observed\nshifts of the mean pointer position and momentum. The particular relevance of\nthis analysis is discussed in the case of sequential weak interactions,\nfollowed by a postselection (called sequential WM) which, in the special case,\nreduces to the usual WM scheme involving a single weak interaction and\npostseletion, modified by the effect of pointer state correlations.\n", "  Higher order harmonic flow $v_n$ (with $n\\ge4$) in heavy-ion collisions can\nbe measured either with respect to their own plane, or with respect to a plane\nconstructed using lower-order harmonics. By assuming that higher flow harmonics\nare the superposition of medium nonlinear and linear responses to initial\nanisotropies, we propose a set of nonlinear response coefficients $\\chi_n$'s,\nwhich are independent of initial state by construction. In experiments,\n$\\chi_n$'s can be extracted as the ratio between higher order harmonic flow\nmeasured in the plane constructed by $v_2$ and $v_3$, and moments of lower\norder harmonic flow. Simulations with single-shot hydrodynamics and AMPT model\nlead to results of these nonlinear response coefficients in good agreement with\nthe experimental data at the LHC energy. Predictions for $v_7$ and $v_8$\nmeasured with respect to plane of lower order harmonics are given accordingly.\n", "  This overview article describes the legacy prospect and discovery potential\nof the Dark Energy Survey (DES) beyond cosmological studies, illustrating it\nwith examples from the DES early data. DES is using a wide-field camera (DECam)\non the 4m Blanco Telescope in Chile to image 5000 sq deg of the sky in five\nfilters (grizY). By its completion the survey is expected to have generated a\ncatalogue of 300 million galaxies with photometric redshifts and 100 million\nstars. In addition, a time-domain survey search over 27 sq deg is expected to\nyield a sample of thousands of Type Ia supernovae and other transients. The\nmain goals of DES are to characterise dark energy and dark matter, and to test\nalternative models of gravity; these goals will be pursued by studying large\nscale structure, cluster counts, weak gravitational lensing and Type Ia\nsupernovae. However, DES also provides a rich data set which allows us to study\nmany other aspects of astrophysics. In this paper we focus on additional\nscience with DES, emphasizing areas where the survey makes a difference with\nrespect to other current surveys. The paper illustrates, using early data (from\n`Science Verification', and from the first, second and third seasons of\nobservations), what DES can tell us about the solar system, the Milky Way,\ngalaxy evolution, quasars, and other topics. In addition, we show that if the\ncosmological model is assumed to be Lambda+ Cold Dark Matter (LCDM) then\nimportant astrophysics can be deduced from the primary DES probes. Highlights\nfrom DES early data include the discovery of 34 Trans Neptunian Objects, 17\ndwarf satellites of the Milky Way, one published z > 6 quasar (and more\nconfirmed) and two published superluminous supernovae (and more confirmed).\n", "  In the standard electroweak theory that describes nature, the Chern-Simons\nnumber associated with the vacua as well as the unstable sphaleron solutions\nplay a crucial role in the baryon number violating processes. We recall why the\nChern-Simons number should be generalized from a set of discrete values to a\ndynamical (quantum) variable. Via the construction of an appropriate Hopf\ninvariant and the winding number, we discuss how the geometric information in\nthe gauge fields is also captured in the Higgs field. We then discuss the\nchoice of the Hopf variable in relation to the Chern-Simons variable.\n", "  Macroscopic realism is the name for a class of modifications to quantum\ntheory that allow macroscopic objects to be described in a\nmeasurement-independent manner, while largely preserving a fully quantum\nmechanical description of the microscopic world. Objective collapse theories\nare examples which aim to solve the quantum measurement problem through\nmodified dynamical laws. Whether such theories describe nature, however, is not\nknown. Here we describe and implement an experimental protocol capable of\nconstraining theories of this class, that is more noise tolerant and\nconceptually transparent than the original Leggett-Garg test. We implement the\nprotocol in a superconducting flux qubit, and rule out (by ~84 s.d.) those\ntheories which would deny coherent superpositions of 170 nA currents over a ~10\nns timescale. Further, we address the 'clumsiness loophole' by determining\nclassical disturbance with control experiments. Our results constitute strong\nevidence for the superposition of states of nontrivial macroscopic\ndistinctness.\n", "  Propagation of light through a uniaxial material is studied using field\ntheoretical methods. The materials is modeled by cubic lattice of oriented\nclassical Lorentz oscillators. A two-step coarse graining approach is applied.\nAt the bulk level, excitations of the coupled light-matter system, or\npolaritons, are described by a Proca-type equation for massive vector bosons.\nOn the microscopic level, multiple scattering is used to relate the sub-luminal\nspeed of the polaritons to the polarizability of the Lorentz oscillators. For\neach direction of propagation of the polaritons, three independent\npolarizations exist, consistent with the integer spin of massive vector bosons.\nReflection and refraction are calculated by imposing the requirement of a\nuniform gauge for the electromagnetic vector potential across the interface of\nthe uniaxial molecular material and vacuum. Reflectance spectra near the\nresonance frequency are calculated. The spectra feature a characteristic\nminimum in middle of the reflection band, in agreement with experiment. An\nincident unpolarized light beam is predicted to refract into three different\nrays. The model supports surface bound excitations and predicts a Goos-Haenchen\nshift of the reflected beam upon reflection of light incident from vacuum onto\nthe material.\n", "  Temporal and spectral information extracted from a stream of photons received\nfrom astronomical sources is the foundation on which we build understanding of\nvarious objects and processes in the Universe. Typically astronomers fit a\nnumber of models separately to light curves and spectra to extract relevant\nfeatures. These features are then used to classify, identify, and understand\nthe nature of the sources. However, these feature extraction methods may not be\noptimally sensitive to unknown properties of light curves and spectra. One can\nuse the raw light curves and spectra as features to train classifiers, but this\ntypically increases the dimensionality of the problem, often by several orders\nof magnitude. We overcome this problem by integrating light curves and spectra\nto create an abstract image and using wavelet analysis to extract important\nfeatures from the image. Such features incorporate both temporal and spectral\nproperties of the astronomical data. Classification is then performed on those\nabstract features. In order to demonstrate this technique, we have used\ngamma-ray burst (GRB) data from the NASA's Swift mission to classify GRBs into\nhigh- and low-redshift groups. Reliable selection of high-redshift GRBs is of\nconsiderable interest in astrophysics and cosmology.\n", "  In this communication, a fast reconstruction algorithm is proposed for\nfluorescence \\textit{blind} structured illumination microscopy (SIM) under the\nsample positivity constraint. This new algorithm is by far simpler and faster\nthan existing solutions, paving the way to 3D and/or real-time 2D\nreconstruction.\n", "  A framework based on generalized hierarchical random graphs (GHRGs) for the\ndetection of change points in the structure of temporal networks has recently\nbeen developed by Peel and Clauset [1]. We build on this methodology and extend\nit to also include the versatile stochastic block models (SBMs) as a parametric\nfamily for reconstructing the empirical networks. We use five different\ntechniques for change point detection on prototypical temporal networks,\nincluding empirical and synthetic ones. We find that none of the considered\nmethods can consistently outperform the others when it comes to detecting and\nlocating the expected change points in empirical temporal networks. With\nrespect to the precision and the recall of the results of the change points, we\nfind that the method based on a degree-corrected SBM has better recall\nproperties than other dedicated methods, especially for sparse networks and\nsmaller sliding time window widths.\n", "  Elaborating on our previous presentation, where the term {\\it dipolar\nquantization} was introduced, we argue here that adopting\n$L_0-(L_1+L_{-1})/2+{\\bar L}_0-({\\bar L}_1+{\\bar L}_{-1})/2$ as the Hamiltonian\ninstead of $L_0+{\\bar L}_0$ yields an infinite circumference limit in\ntwo-dimensional conformal field theory. The new Hamiltonian leads to dipolar\nquantization instead of radial quantization. As a result, the new theory\nexhibits a continuous and strongly degenerated spectrum in addition to the\nVirasoro algebra with a continuous index. Its Hilbert space exhibits a\ndifferent inner product than that obtained in the original theory. The\nidiosyncrasy of this particular Hamiltonian is its relation to the so-called\nsine-square deformation, which is found in the study of a certain class of\nquantum statistical systems. The appearance of the infinite circumference\nexplains why the vacuum states of sine-square deformed systems are coincident\nwith those of the respective closed-boundary systems.\n", "  Charged-particle distributions are measured in proton-proton collisions at a\ncentre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, using a data sample of nearly 9 million\nevents, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 170 $\\mu$b$^{-1}$,\nrecorded by the ATLAS detector during a special Large Hadron Collider fill. The\ncharged-particle multiplicity, its dependence on transverse momentum and\npseudorapidity and the dependence of the mean transverse momentum on the\ncharged-particle multiplicity are presented. The measurements are performed\nwith charged particles with transverse momentum greater than 500 MeV and\nabsolute pseudorapidity less than 2.5, in events with at least one charged\nparticle satisfying these kinematic requirements. Additional measurements in a\nreduced phase space with absolute pseudorapidity less than 0.8 are also\npresented, in order to compare with other experiments. The results are\ncorrected for detector effects, presented as particle-level distributions and\nare compared to the predictions of various Monte Carlo event generators.\n", "  Project Matsu is a collaboration between the Open Commons Consortium and NASA\nfocused on developing open source technology for the cloud-based processing of\nEarth satellite imagery. A particular focus is the development of applications\nfor detecting fires and floods to help support natural disaster detection and\nrelief. Project Matsu has developed an open source cloud-based infrastructure\nto process, analyze, and reanalyze large collections of hyperspectral satellite\nimage data using OpenStack, Hadoop, MapReduce, Storm and related technologies.\n  We describe a framework for efficient analysis of large amounts of data\ncalled the Matsu \"Wheel.\" The Matsu Wheel is currently used to process incoming\nhyperspectral satellite data produced daily by NASA's Earth Observing-1 (EO-1)\nsatellite. The framework is designed to be able to support scanning queries\nusing cloud computing applications, such as Hadoop and Accumulo. A scanning\nquery processes all, or most of the data, in a database or data repository.\n  We also describe our preliminary Wheel analytics, including an anomaly\ndetector for rare spectral signatures or thermal anomalies in hyperspectral\ndata and a land cover classifier that can be used for water and flood\ndetection. Each of these analytics can generate visual reports accessible via\nthe web for the public and interested decision makers. The resultant products\nof the analytics are also made accessible through an Open Geospatial Compliant\n(OGC)-compliant Web Map Service (WMS) for further distribution. The Matsu Wheel\nallows many shared data services to be performed together to efficiently use\nresources for processing hyperspectral satellite image data and other, e.g.,\nlarge environmental datasets that may be analyzed for many purposes.\n", "  We study two ways of summing an infinite family of noncommutative spectral\ntriples. First, we propose a definition of the integration of spectral triples\nand give an example using algebras of Toeplitz operators acting on weighted\nBergman spaces over the unit ball of $\\mathbb{C}^n$. Secondly, we construct a\nspectral triple associated to a general polygonal self-similar set in\n$\\mathbb{C}$ using algebras of Toeplitz operators on Hardy spaces. In this\ncase, we show that we can recover the Hausdorff dimension of the fractal set.\n", "  The protoplanetary disk around the F-type star HD 135344B (SAO 206462) is in\na transition stage and shows many intriguing structures both in scattered light\nand thermal (sub-)millimeter emission which are possibly related to planet\nformation processes. We study the morphology and surface brightness of the disk\nin scattered light to gain insight into the innermost disk regions, the\nformation of protoplanets, planet-disk interactions traced in the surface and\nmidplane layers, and the dust grain properties of the disk surface. We have\ncarried out high-contrast polarimetric differential imaging (PDI) observations\nwith VLT/SPHERE and obtained polarized scattered light images with ZIMPOL in R-\nand I-band and with IRDIS in Y- and J-band. The scattered light images reveal\nwith unprecedented angular resolution and sensitivity the spiral arms as well\nas the 25 au cavity of the disk. Multiple shadow features are discovered on the\nouter disk with one shadow only being present during the second observation\nepoch. A positive surface brightness gradient is observed in the stellar\nirradiation corrected images in southwest direction possibly due to an\nazimuthally asymmetric perturbation of the temperature and/or surface density\nby the passing spiral arms. The disk integrated polarized flux, normalized to\nthe stellar flux, shows a positive trend towards longer wavelengths which we\nattribute to large aggregate dust grains in the disk surface. Part of the the\nnon-azimuthal polarization signal in the Uphi image of the J-band observation\ncould be the result of multiple scattering in the disk. The detected shadow\nfeatures and their possible variability have the potential to provide insight\ninto the structure of and processes occurring in the innermost disk regions.\n", "  We calculate the total and the differential cross section for $np$ scattering\nat low energies in the isospin $I=1$ channel within the so-called extended\nLinear Sigma Model. This model contains conventional (pseudo)scalar and\n(axial--)vector mesons, as well as the nucleon and its chiral partner within\nthe mirror assignment. In order to obtain good agreement with experimental data\nanalysis results we need to consider two additional resonances: the lightest\nscalar state $f_{0}(500)$ and a dibaryon state with quantum numbers $I=1,$\n$J^{P}=0^{+}$ (also known as $^{1}S_{0}$ resonance). The resonance $f_{0}(500)$\nis coupled to nucleons in a chirally invariant way through the mirror\nassignment and is crucial for a qualitatively correct description of the shape\nof the differential cross section. On the other hand, the dibaryon is exchanged\nin the $s$--channel and is responsible of the large cross section close to\nthreshold. We compare our results to data analysis results performed by the\nSAID program of the CNS Data Analysis Center (in the following \"SAID results\").\n", "  We propose a general framework to simulate stochastic trajectories with\narbitrarily long memory dependence and efficiently evaluate large deviation\nfunctions associated to time-extensive observables. This extends the \"cloning\"\nprocedure of Giardin\\'a et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 120603 (2006)] to\nnon-Markovian systems. We demonstrate the validity of this method by testing\nnon-Markovian variants of an ion-channel model and the Totally Asymmetric\nExclusion Process, recovering results obtainable by other means.\n", "  In a recent paper Lechner, Hauke and Zoller (LHZ) described a means to\ntranslate a Hamiltonian of $N$ spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ particles with 'all-to-all'\ninteractions into a larger physical lattice with only on-site energies and\nlocal parity constraints. LHZ used this mapping to propose a novel form of\nquantum annealing. Here we provide a stabiliser-based formulation within which\nwe can describe both this prior approach and a wide variety of variants.\nExamples include a triangular array supporting all-to-all connectivity, and\nmoreover arrangements requiring only $2N$ or $N\\log N$ spins but providing\ninteresting bespoke connectivities. Further examples show that arbitrarily high\norder logical terms can be efficiently realised, even in a strictly 2D layout.\nOur stabilisers can correspond to either even-parity constraints, as in the LHZ\nproposal, or as odd-parity constraints. Considering the latter option applied\nto the original LHZ layout, we note it may simplify the physical realisation\nsince the required ancillas are only spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ systems (i.e. qubits,\nrather than qutrits) and moreover the interactions are very simple. We make a\npreliminary assessment of the impact of this design choices by simulating small\n(few-qubit) systems; we find some indications that the new variant may maintain\na larger minimum energy gap during the annealing process.\n", "  The conventional slow-roll approximation is broken in the so-called \"ultra\nslow-roll\" models of inflation, for which the inflaton potential is exactly (or\nextremely) flat. The interesting nature of (canonical) ultra slow-roll\ninflation is that the curvature perturbation grows on superhorizon scales, but\nhas a scale-invariant power spectrum. We study the ultra slow-roll inflationary\ndynamics in the presence of non-canonical kinetic terms of the scalar field,\nnamely ultra slow-roll G-inflation. We compute the evolution of the curvature\nperturbation and show that the primordial power spectrum follows a broken power\nlaw with an oscillation feature. It is demonstrated that this could explain the\nlack of large-scale power in the cosmic microwave background temperature\nanisotropies. We also point out that the violation of the null energy condition\nis prohibited in ultra slow-roll G-inflation and hence a blue tensor tilt is\nimpossible as long as inflation is driven by the potential. This statement is,\nhowever, not true if the energy density is dominated by the kinetic energy of\nthe scalar field.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate stability of a class of analytic neural\nnetworks with the synaptic feedback via event-triggered rules. This model is\ngeneral and include Hopfield neural network as a special case. These\nevent-trigger rules can efficiently reduces loads of computation and\ninformation transmission at synapses of the neurons. The synaptic feedback of\neach neuron keeps a constant value based on the outputs of the other neurons at\nits latest triggering time but changes at its next triggering time, which is\ndetermined by certain criterion. It is proved that every trajectory of the\nanalytic neural network converges to certain equilibrium under this\nevent-triggered rule for all initial values except a set of zero measure. The\nmain technique of the proof is the Lojasiewicz inequality to prove the\nfiniteness of trajectory length. The realization of this event-triggered rule\nis verified by the exclusion of Zeno behaviors. Numerical examples are provided\nto illustrate the efficiency of the theoretical results.\n", "  Detection of non-overlapping and overlapping communities are essentially the\nsame problem. However, current algorithms focus either on finding overlapping\nor non-overlapping communities. We present a generalized framework that can\nidentify both non-overlapping and overlapping communities, without any prior\ninput about the network or its community distribution. To do so, we introduce a\nvertex-based metric, GenPerm, that quantifies by how much a vertex belongs to\neach of its constituent communities. Our community detection algorithm is based\non maximizing the GenPerm over all the vertices in the network. We demonstrate,\nthrough experiments over synthetic and real-world networks, that GenPerm is\nmore effective than other metrics in evaluating community structure. Further,\nwe show that due to its vertex-centric property, GenPerm can be used to unfold\nseveral inferences beyond community detection, such as core-periphery analysis\nand message spreading. Our algorithm for maximizing GenPerm outperforms six\nstate-of-the-art algorithms in accurately predicting the ground-truth labels.\nFinally, we discuss the problem of resolution limit in overlapping communities\nand demonstrate that maximizing GenPerm can mitigate this problem.\n", "  In Coles-Piani's recent remarkable version of the entropic uncertainty\nprinciple, the entropic sum is controlled by the first and second maximum\noverlaps between the two projective measurements. We generalize the entropic\nuncertainty relation in the presence of quantum memory and find the exact\ndependence on all $d$ largest overlaps between two measurements on any\n$d$-dimensional Hilbert space. The corresponding entropic uncertainty principle\nin the absence of quantum memory is also derived. Our bounds are strictly\ntighter than previous entropic bounds in the presence of quantum memory, which\nhave potential applications to quantum cryptography with entanglement witnesses\nand quantum key distributions.\n", "  Single-shot quantum channel discrimination is a fundamental task in quantum\ninformation theory. It is well known that entanglement with an ancillary system\ncan help in this task, and furthermore that an ancilla with the same dimension\nas the input of the channels is always sufficient for optimal discrimination of\ntwo channels. A natural question to ask is whether the same holds true for the\noutput dimension. That is, in cases when the output dimension of the channels\nis (possibly much) smaller than the input dimension, is an ancilla with\ndimension equal to the output dimension always sufficient for optimal\ndiscrimination? We show that the answer to this question is \"no\" by\nconstruction of a family of counterexamples. This family contains instances\nwith arbitrary finite gap between the input and output dimensions, and still\nhas the property that in every case, for optimal discrimination, it is\nnecessary to use an ancilla with dimension equal to that of the input.\n  The proof relies on a characterization of all operators on the trace norm\nunit sphere that maximize entanglement negativity. In the case of density\noperators we generalize this characterization to a broad class of entanglement\nmeasures, which we call weak entanglement measures. This characterization\nallows us to conclude that a quantum channel is reversible if and only if it\npreserves entanglement as measured by any weak entanglement measure, with the\nstructure of maximally entangled states being equivalent to the structure of\nreversible maps via the Choi isomorphism. We also include alternate proofs of\nother known characterizations of channel reversibility.\n", "  We show that the existence of black holes with classical skyrmion hair\ninvalidates standard proofs that global charges, such as the baryon number,\ncannot be conserved by a black hole. By carefully analyzing the standard\narguments based on a Gedankenexperiment in which a black hole is\nseemingly-unable to return the baryon number that it swallowed, we identify\ninconsistencies in this reasoning, which does not take into the account neither\nthe existence of skyrmion black holes nor the baryon/skyrmion correspondence.\nWe then perform a refined Gedankenexperiment by incorporating the new knowledge\nand show that no contradiction with conservation of baryon number takes place\nat any stage of black hole evolution. Our analysis also indicates no conflict\nbetween semi-classical black holes and the existence of baryonic gauge\ninteraction arbitrarily-weaker than gravity. Next, we study classical cross\nsections of a minimally-coupled massless probe scalar field scattered by a\nskyrmion black hole. We investigate how the skyrmion hair manifests itself by\ncomparing this cross section with the analogous cross section caused by a\nSchwarzschild black hole which has the same ADM mass as the skyrmion black\nhole. Here we find an order-one difference in the positions of the\ncharacteristic peaks in the cross sections. The peaks are shifted to smaller\nscattering angles when the skyrmion hair is present. This comes from the fact\nthat the skyrmion hair changes the near horizon geometry of the black hole when\ncompared to a Schwarzschild black hole with same ADM mass. We keep the study of\nthis second aspect general so that the qualitative results which we obtain can\nalso be applied to black holes with classical hair of different kind.\n", "  In the SM gauge symmetries and fermion content of neutrinos, charged leptons\nand quarks, we study the effective four-fermion operators of Einstein-Cartan\ntype and their contributions to the Schwinger-Dyson equations of fermion\nself-energy functions. The study is motivated by the speculation that these\nfour-fermion operators are probably originated due to the quantum gravity that\nprovides the natural regularization for chiral-symmetric gauge field theories.\nIn the chiral-gauge symmetry breaking phase, as to achieve the energetically\nfavorable ground state, only the top-quark mass is generated via the\nspontaneous symmetry breaking, and other fermion masses are generated via the\nexplicit symmetry breaking induced by the top-quark mass, four-fermion\ninteractions and fermion-flavor mixing matrices. A phase transition from the\nsymmetry breaking phase to the chiral-gauge symmetric phase at TeV scale occurs\nand the drastically fine-tuning problem can be resolved. In the infrared\nfixed-point domain of the four-fermion coupling for the SM at low energies, we\nqualitatively obtain the hierarchy patterns of the SM fermion Dirac masses,\nYukawa couplings and family-flavor mixing matrices with three additional\nright-handed neutrinos $\\nu^f_R$. Large Majorana masses and lepton-symmetry\nbreaking are originated by the four-fermion interactions among $\\nu^f_R$ and\ntheir left-handed conjugated fields $\\nu^{fc}_R$. Light masses of gauged\nMajorana neutrinos in the normal hierarchy ($10^{-5}-10^{-2}$ eV) are obtained\nconsistently with neutrino oscillations. We present some discussions on the\ncomposite Higgs phenomenology and forward-backward asymmetry of $t\\bar\nt$-production, as well as remarks on the candidates of light and heavy dark\nmatter particles (fermions, scalar and pseudoscalar bosons).\n", "  After four years of data taking, the IceCube neutrino telescope has detected\n54 high-energy starting events (HESE, or contained-vertex events) with\ndeposited energies above 20TeV. They represent the first ever detection of\nhigh-energy extraterrestrial neutrinos and therefore, the first step in\nneutrino astronomy. In order to study the energy, flavor and isotropy of the\nastrophysical neutrino flux arriving at Earth, we perform different analyses of\ntwo different deposited energy intervals, [10 TeV $-$ 10 PeV] and [60 TeV $-$\n10 PeV]. We first consider an isotropic unbroken power-law spectrum and\nconstrain its shape, normalization and flavor composition. Our results are in\nagreement with the preliminary IceCube results, although we obtain a slightly\nsofter spectrum. We also find that current data are not sensitive to a possible\nneutrino-antineutrino asymmetry in the astrophysical flux. Then, we show that\nalthough a two-component power-law model leads to a slightly better fit, it\ndoes not represent a significant improvement with respect to a single power-law\nflux. Finally, we analyze the possible existence of a North-South asymmetry,\nhinted at by the combination of the HESE sample with the through-going muon\ndata. If only using HESE data, the scarce statistics from the northern\nhemisphere does not allow us to reach any conclusive answer, which indicates\nthat the HESE sample alone is not driving the potential North-South asymmetry.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the fluid/gravity correspondence in the\nframework of massive Einstein gravity. Treating the gravitational mass terms as\nan effective energy-momentum tensor and utilizing the Petrov-like boundary\ncondition on a timelike hypersurface, we find that the perturbation effects of\nmassive gravity in bulk can be completely governed by the incompressible\nNavier-Stokes equation living on the cutoff surface under the near horizon and\nnonrelativistic limits. Furthermore, we have concisely computed the ratio of\ndynamical viscosity to entropy density for two massive Einstein gravity\ntheories, and found that they still saturate the Kovtun-Son-Starinets (KSS)\nbound.\n", "  The mechanism of decoherence for a quantum system with rotational degrees of\nfreedom is studied. From a simple model of elastic scattering, we show that the\nnon-diagonal density matrix elements of the system exponentially decay. The\ndecay rate depends on the difference of scattering amplitudes for different\nrotational configurations, leading to the gradual loss of quantum coherence\nbetween the pointer states in the system orientational space. For a dielectric\nellipsoid immersed in a photon-gas environment (assuming no absorption), the\ndecay rate is found to be proportional to the seventh power of the temperature.\nFor an ellipsoidal object interacting with mass particles, the decay rate is\nproportional to the 5/2 power of the temperature. Both are different from the\ncase of translational decoherence induced by the same environment scattering.\nFor photon scattering, the coherence time in the rotational degrees of freedom\nis shown to be much shorter than that in the translational degrees of freedom.\n", "  In the search for an explanation for the current acceleration of the\nUniverse, scalar fields are the most simple and useful tools to build models of\ndark energy. This field, however, must in principle couple with the rest of the\nworld and not necessarily in the same way to different particles or fluids. We\nprovide the most complete dynamical system analysis to date, consisting of a\ncanonical scalar field conformally and disformally coupled to both dust and\nradiation. We perform a detailed study of the existence and stability\nconditions of the systems and comment on constraints imposed on the disformal\ncoupling from Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis and given current limits on the\nvariation of the fine-structure constant.\n", "  In the minimal seesaw model, we derive required constraints on Dirac neutrino\nmasses inducing maximal CP violation in neutrino oscillations. If the maximal\natmospheric neutrino mixing is further assumed, Dirac neutrino masses are\nuniquely determined to respect $\\mu$-$\\tau$ flavored CP symmetry for neutrinos.\n", "  We propose to couple single atomic qubits to photons incident on a cavity\ncontaining an atomic ensemble of a different species that mediates the coupling\nvia Rydberg interactions. Subject to a classical field and the cavity field,\nthe ensemble forms a collective dark state which is resonant with the input\nphoton, while excitation of a qubit atom leads to a secondary \"dark\" state that\nsplits the cavity resonance. The two different dark state mechanisms yield zero\nand $\\pi$ reflection phase shifts and can be used to implement quantum gates\nbetween atomic and optical qubits.\n", "  Recent realizations of quantum gas microscope offer the possibility of\ncontinuous monitoring of the dynamics of a quantum many-body system at the\nsingle-particle level. By analyzing effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonians of\ninteracting bosons in an optical lattice and continuum, we demonstrate that the\nbackaction of quantum measurement shifts the quantum critical point and gives\nrise to a unique critical phase beyond the terrain of the standard universality\nclass. We perform mean-field and strong-coupling-expansion analyses and show\nthat non-Hermitian contributions shift the superfluid--to-Mott-insulator\ntransition point. Using a low-energy effective field theory, we discuss\ncritical behavior of the one-dimensional interacting Bose gas subject to the\nmeasurement backaction. We derive an exact ground state of the effective\nnon-Hermitian Hamiltonian and find a unique critical behavior beyond the\nTomonaga-Luttinger liquid universality class. We propose experimental\nimplementations of post-selections using quantum gas microscopes to simulate\nthe non-Hermitian dynamics and argue that our results can be investigated with\ncurrent experimental techniques in ultracold atoms.\n", "  Optical Whispering Gallery Modes (WGMs) derive their name from a famous\nacoustic phenomenon of guiding a wave by a curved boundary observed nearly a\ncentury ago. This phenomenon has a rather general nature, equally applicable to\nsound and all other waves. It enables resonators of unique properties\nattractive both in science and engineering. Very high quality factors of\noptical WGM resonators persisting in a wide wavelength range spanning from\nradio frequencies to ultraviolet light, their small mode volume, and tunable\nin- and out- coupling make them exceptionally efficient for nonlinear optical\napplications. Nonlinear optics facilitates interaction of photons with each\nother and with other physical systems, and is of prime importance in quantum\noptics. In this paper we review numerous applications of WGM resonators in\nnonlinear and quantum optics. We outline the current areas of interest,\nsummarize progress, highlight difficulties, and discuss possible future\ndevelopment trends in these areas.\n", "  We present a newly developed software package which implements a wide range\nof routines frequently used in Weak Gravitational Lensing (WL). With the\ncontinuously increasing size of the WL scientific community we feel that easy\nto use Application Program Interfaces (APIs) for common calculations are a\nnecessity to ensure efficiency and coordination across different working\ngroups. Coupled with existing open source codes, such as CAMB and Gadget2,\nLensTools brings together a cosmic shear simulation pipeline which,\ncomplemented with a variety of WL feature measurement tools and parameter\nsampling routines, provides easy access to the numerics for theoretical studies\nof WL as well as for experiment forecasts. Being implemented in python,\nLensTools takes full advantage of a range of state--of--the art techniques\ndeveloped by the large and growing open--source software community\n(scipy,pandas,astropy,scikit-learn,emcee). We made the LensTools code available\non the Python Package Index and published its documentation on\nhttp://lenstools.readthedocs.io\n", "  We discuss a left-right symmetric extension of the Standard Model in which\nthe three additional right-handed neutrinos play a central role in explaining\nthe baryon asymmetry of the Universe, the dark matter abundance and the ultra\nenergetic signal detected by the IceCube experiment. The energy spectrum and\nneutrino flux measured by IceCube are ascribed to the decays of the lightest\nright-handed neutrino $N_1$, thus fixing its mass and lifetime, while the\nproduction of $N_1$ in the primordial thermal bath occurs via a freeze-in\nmechanism driven by the additional $SU(2)_R$ interactions. The constraints\nimposed by IceCube and the dark matter abundance allow nonetheless the heavier\nright-handed neutrinos to realize a standard type-I seesaw leptogenesis, with\nthe $B-L$ asymmetry dominantly produced by the next-to-lightest neutrino $N_2$.\nFurther consequences and predictions of the model are that: the $N_1$\nproduction implies a specific power-law relation between the reheating\ntemperature of the Universe and the vacuum expectation value of the $SU(2)_R$\ntriplet; leptogenesis imposes a lower bound on the reheating temperature of the\nUniverse at $7\\times10^9\\,\\mbox{GeV}$. Additionally, the model requires a\nvanishing absolute neutrino mass scale $m_1\\simeq0$.\n", "  The nematic-superconductor state is an example of a quantum liquid crystal\nthat breaks gauge as well as rotation invariance. It was conjectured to exist\nin the pseudogap regime of the cuprates high $T_c$ superconductors. The\nnematic-superconductor state is characterized by two complex order parameters:\none of them is related with superconductivity and the other one describes a\nnematic order. It supports two main classes of topological defects:\nhalf-vortices and disclinations. In this paper we present a Ginzburg-Landau\napproach to study the structure of these topological defects. Due to a\ngeometrical coupling between the superconductor and the nematic order\nparameters, we show that vortices are strongly coupled with disclinations. We\nhave found a restoring force between vortices and disclinations that produces\nharmonic excitations whose natural frequency depends on the geometrical\ncoupling constant and the superconductor condensation energy. Moreover, in a\nregime with high density of defects, we have found a structural phase\ntransition between vortex-disclination lattices with different symmetries.\n", "  The settling of heavy spherical particles in a column of quiescent fluid is\ninvestigated. The performed experiments cover a range of Galileo numbers ($110\n\\leq \\text{Ga} \\leq 310$) for a fixed density ratio of $\\Gamma = \\rho_p/\\rho_f\n= 2.5$. In this regime the particles are known (M. Jenny, J. Du\\v{s}ek and G.\nBouchet, Journal of Fluid Mechanics 508, 201 (2004).) to show a variety of\nmotions. It is known that the wake undergoes several transitions for increasing\n$\\text{Ga}$ resulting in particle motions that are successively: vertical,\noblique, oblique oscillating, and finally chaotic. Not only does this change\nthe trajectory of single, isolated, settling particles, but it also changes the\ndynamics of a swarm of particles as collective effects become important even\nfor dilute suspensions, with volume fraction up to $\\Phi_V =\n\\mathcal{O}\\left(10^{-3}\\right)$, which are investigated in this work.\nMulti-camera recordings of settling particles are recorded and tracked over\ntime in 3 dimensions. A variety of analysis are performed and show a strong\nclustering behavior. The distribution of the cell areas of the Vorono\\\"i\ntessellation in the horizontal plane are compared to that of a random\ndistribution of particles and shows clear clustering. Moreover, a negative\ncorrelation was found between the Vorono\\\"i area and the particle velocity;\nclustered particles fall faster. In addition, the angle between two adjacent\nparticles and the vertical is calculated and compared to a homogeneous\ndistribution of particles, clear evidence of vertical alignment of particles is\nfound. The experimental findings are compared to simulations.\n", "  Quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect is promising for achieving dissipationless\ntransport devices due to the robust gapless states inside insulating bulk gap.\nHere, by using first-principles calculations, we discover group-IV chalcogenide\nSi2Te2 film to be a 2D QSH insulator with a fundamental band gap of 0.29 eV,\nwhich is tunable under external strain. This nontrivial topological phase stems\nfrom band inversion between the Si-px,y and Te-px,y orbitals, demonstrated by a\nsingle pair of topologically protected helical edge states with Dirac point\nlocating in the bulk gap. Notably, the characteristic properties of edge\nstates, such as the Fermi velocity and edge shape, can be tuned by edge\nmodifications. Additionally, the h-BN semiconductor is an ideal substrate for\nexperimental realization of 2D Si2Te2 film, without destroying its nontrivial\ntopology. Our works open a new route for designing topological spintronics\ndevices based on 2D silicon-based films.\n", "  We demonstrate that the occurrence of symmetry breaking phase transitions\ntogether with the emergence of a local order parameter in classical statistical\nphysics is a consequence of the geometrical structure of probability space. To\nthis end we investigate convex sets generated by expectation values of certain\nobservables with respect to all possible probability distributions of classical\nq-state spins on a two-dimensional lattice, for several values of q. The\nextreme points of these sets are then given by thermal Gibbs states of the\nclassical q-state Potts model. As symmetry breaking phase transitions and the\nemergence of associated order parameters are signaled by the appearance ruled\nsurfaces on these sets, this implies that symmetry breaking is ultimately a\nconsequence of the geometrical structure of probability space. In particular we\nidentify the different features arising for continuous and first order phase\ntransitions and show how to obtain critical exponents and susceptibilities from\nthe geometrical shape of the surface set. Such convex sets thus also constitute\na novel and very intuitive way of constructing phase diagrams for many body\nsystems, as all thermodynamically relevant quantities can be very naturally\nread off from these sets.\n", "  Owing to the presence of strong static correlation effects, accurate\nprediction of the electronic properties (e.g., the singlet-triplet energy gaps,\nvertical ionization potentials, vertical electron affinities, fundamental gaps,\nsymmetrized von Neumann entropy, active orbital occupation numbers, and\nreal-space representation of active orbitals) of cyclacenes with n fused\nbenzene rings (n = 4-100) has posed a great challenge to traditional electronic\nstructure methods. To meet the challenge, we study these properties using our\nnewly developed thermally-assisted-occupation density functional theory\n(TAO-DFT), a very efficient method for the study of large systems with strong\nstatic correlation effects. Besides, to examine the role of cyclic topology,\nthe electronic properties of cyclacenes are also compared with those of acenes.\nSimilar to acenes, the ground states of cyclacenes are singlets for all the\ncases studied. In contrast to acenes, the electronic properties of cyclacenes,\nhowever, exhibit oscillatory behavior (for n <= 30) in the approach to the\ncorresponding properties of acenes with increasing number of benzene rings. On\nthe basis of the calculated orbitals and their occupation numbers, the larger\ncyclacenes are shown to exhibit increasing polyradical character in their\nground states, with the active orbitals being mainly localized at the\nperipheral carbon atoms.\n", "  The A-site spinel material, CoAl2O4, is a physical realization of the\nfrustrated diamond-lattice antiferromagnet, a model in which is predicted to\ncontain unique incommensurate or `spin-spiral liquid' ground states. Our\nprevious single-crystal neutron scattering study instead classified it as a\n`kinetically-inhibited' antiferromagnet, where the long ranged correlations of\na collinear Neel ground state are blocked by the freezing of domain wall motion\nbelow a first-order phase transition at T* = 6.5 K. The current paper expands\non our original results in several important ways. New elastic and inelastic\nneutron measurements are presented that show our initial conclusions are\naffected by neither the sample measured nor the instrument resolution, while\nmeasurements to temperatures as low as T = 250 mK limit the possible role being\nplayed by low-lying thermal excitations. Polarized diffuse neutron measurements\nconfirm reports of short-range antiferromagnetic correlations and diffuse\nstreaks of scattering, but major diffuse features are explained as signatures\nof overlapping critical correlations between neighboring Brillouin zones.\nFinally, and critically, this paper presents detailed elastic and inelastic\nmeasurements of magnetic correlations in a single-crystal of MnAl2O4, which\nacts as an unfrustrated analogue to CoAl2O4. The unfrustrated material is shown\nto have a classical continuous phase transition to Neel order at T_N = 39 K,\nwith collective spinwave excitations and Lorentzian-like critical correlations\nwhich diverge at the transition. Direct comparison between the two compounds\nindicates that CoAl2O4 is unique, not in the nature of high-temperature diffuse\ncorrelations, but rather in the nature of the frozen state below T*. The higher\nlevel of cation inversion in the MnAl2O4 sample indicates that this novel\nbehavior is primarily an effect of greater next-nearest-neighbor exchange.\n", "  The Lambda polarization, the analyzing power, and the Lambda spin transfer\ncoefficient of the reaction pp -> p K+ Lambda were measured at beam momenta of\n2.70 GeV/c and 2.95 GeV/c, corresponding to excess energies of 122 MeV and 204\nMeV. While the analyzing power and the spin transfer coefficient do not change\nsignificantly with the excess energy, the Lambda polarization varies strongly\nand changes its sign. As this is the first measurement of polarization\nobservables below an excess energy of 200 MeV, the change of the sign of the\nLambda polarization was not observed before. The high statistics of the data\n(~200 k events for each momentum) enables detailed studies of the dependence of\nthe Lambda polarization and the analyzing power on the center of mass momentum\nof the particles. The results of the spin transfer coefficient are in\nqualitative agreement with the DISTO experiment. The Lambda polarization data\nof 2.95 GeV/c are only conform with the DISTO experiment, while both the 2.70\nGeV/c and 2.95 GeV/c data differ strongly from all previous measurements,\nwhether exclusive or inclusive.\n", "  We theoretically analyse the cooling dynamics of a high-Q mode of a\nmechanical resonator, when the structure is also an optical cavity and is\ncoupled with a NV center. The NV center is driven by a laser and interacts with\nthe cavity photon field and with the strain field of the mechanical oscillator,\nwhile radiation pressure couples mechanical resonator and cavity field.\nStarting from the full master equation we derive the rate equation for the\nmechanical resonator's motion, whose coefficients depend on the system\nparameters and on the noise sources. We then determine the cooling regime, the\ncooling rate, the asymptotic temperatures, and the spectrum of resonance\nfluorescence for experimentally relevant parameter regimes. For these\nparameters, we consider an electronic transition, whose linewidth allows one to\nperform sideband cooling, and show that the addition of an optical cavity in\ngeneral does not improve the cooling efficiency. We further show that pure\ndephasing of the NV center's electronic transitions can lead to an improvement\nof the cooling efficiency.\n", "  We present a novel quasiparticle state driven by a supercurrent in GaAs (100)\nquantum wells in proximity to an $s$-wave superconductor, which can be tuned by\nthe superconducting velocity. Rich features such as the suppressed Cooper\npairings, large quasiparticle density and non-monotonically tunable momentum\ncurrent can be realized by varying the superconducting velocity. In the\ndegenerate regime, the quasiparticle Fermi surface is composed by two arcs,\nreferred to as Fermi arcs, which are contributed by the electron- and hole-like\nbranches. The D'yakonov-Perel' spin relaxation is explored, and intriguing\nphysics is revealed when the Fermi arc emerges. Specifically, when the order\nparameter tends to zero, it is found that the branch-mixing scattering is\nforbidden in the quasi-electron band. When the condensation process associated\nwith the annihilation of the quasi-electron and quasi-hole is {\\em slow}, this\nindicates that the electron- and hole-like Fermi arcs in the quasi-electron\nband are independent. The open structure of the Fermi arc leads to the nonzero\nangular-average of the effective magnetic field due to the spin-orbit coupling,\nwhich acts as an effective Zeeman field. This Zeeman field leads to the spin\noscillations even in the strong scattering regime. Moreover, in the strong\nscattering regime, we show that the open structure of the Fermi arc also leads\nto the insensitiveness of the spin relaxation to the momentum scattering, in\ncontrast to the conventional motional narrowing situation. Nevertheless, with a\n{\\em finite} order parameter, the branch-mixing scattering can be triggered,\nopening the inter-branch spin relaxation channel, which is dominant in the\nstrong scattering regime. In contrast to the situation with an extremely small\norder parameter,....(omitted due to the limit of space)\n", "  We investigate the exceptional points (EPs) in a non-Hermitian system\ncomposed of a pair of graphene sheets with different losses. There are two\nsurface plasmon polaritons (SPP) modes in the graphene waveguide. By varying\nthe distance between two graphene sheets and chemical potential of graphene,\nthe EPs appear as the eigenvalues, that is, the wave vectors of the two modes\ncoalesce. The cross conversion of eigenmodes and variation of geometric phase\ncan be observed by encircling the EP in the parametric space formed by the\ngeometric parameters and chemical potential of graphene. At the same time, a\ncertain input SPP mode may lead to completely different output. The study paves\na way to the development of nanoscale sensitive optical switches and sensors.\n", "  We have investigated Se substitution effect to superconductivity of an\noptimally-doped BiS2-based superconductor Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2. Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex\nsamples with x = 0-1 were synthesized. With increasing x, in-plane chemical\npressure is enhanced. For x = 0.6, 0.8, and 1, superconducting transitions with\na large shielding volume fraction are observed in magnetic susceptibility\nmeasurements, and the highest Tc is 3.8 K for x = 0.8. From low-temperature\nelectrical resistivity measurements, a zero-resistivity state is observed for\nall the samples, and the highest Tc is observed for x = 0.8. With increasing Se\nconcentration, characteristics of electrical resistivity changes from\nsemiconducting-like to metallic, suggesting that the emergence of bulk\nsuperconductivity is linked with the enhanced metallicity. A superconductivity\nphase diagram of the Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex superconductor is established.\nTemperature dependences of electrical resistivity show an anomalous two-step\ntransition under high magnetic fields. Hence, the resistivity data are analyzed\nwith assuming in-plane anisotropy of upper critical field.\n", "  In this paper we consider 3-form dark energy (DE) models with interactions in\nthe dark sector. We aim to distinguish the phenomenological interactions that\nare defined through the dark matter (DM) and the DE energy densities. We do our\nanalysis mainly in two stages. In the first stage, we identify the\nnon-interacting 3-form DE model which generically leads to an abrupt late-time\ncosmological event which is known as the little sibling of the Big Rip (LSBR).\nWe classify the interactions which can possibly avoid this late-time abrupt\nevent. We also study the parameter space of the model that is consistent with\nthe interaction between DM and DE energy densities at present as indicated by\nrecent studies based on BAO and SDSS data. In the later stage, we\nobservationally distinguish those interactions using the statefinder hierarchy\nparameters $\\{ S_{3}^{(1)}\\,,\\, S_{4}^{(1)}\\} \\,,\\,\\{ S_{3}^{(1)}\\,,\\,\nS_{5}^{(1)}\\} .$ We also compute the growth factor parameter $\\epsilon(z)$ for\nthe various interactions we consider herein and use the composite null\ndiagnostic (CND) $\\{ S_{3}^{(1)}\\,,\\,\\epsilon(z)\\} $ as a tool to characterise\nthose interactions by measuring their departures from the concordance model. In\naddition, we make a preliminary analysis of our model in light of the recently\nreleased data by SDSS~III on the measurement of the linear growth rate of\nstructure.\n", "  A search is presented for dark matter produced in association with a\nhadronically decaying W or Z boson using 3.2 /fb of pp collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s}$=13 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider.\nEvents with a hadronic jet compatible with a W or Z boson and with large\nmissing transverse momentum are analysed. The data are consistent with the\nStandard Model predictions and are interpreted in terms of both an effective\nfield theory and a simplified model containing dark matter.\n", "  In view of the large discrepancy about the associated production of a prompt\n$J/\\psi$ and a $Z$ boson between the ATLAS data at $\\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV and\ntheoretical predictions for Single Parton Scattering (SPS) contributions, we\nperform an evaluation of the corresponding cross section at one loop accuracy\n(Next-to-Leading Order, NLO) in a quark-hadron-duality approach, also known as\nthe Colour-Evaporation Model (CEM). This work is motivated by (i) the extremely\ndisparate predictions based on the existing NRQCD fits conjugated with the\nabsence of a full NLO NRQCD computation and (ii) the fact that we believe that\nsuch an evaluation provides a likely upper limit of the SPS cross section. In\naddition to these theory improvements, we argue that the ATLAS estimation of\nthe Double Parton Scattering (DPS) yield may be underestimated by a factor as\nlarge as 3 which then reduces the size of the SPS yield extracted from the\nATLAS data. Our NLO SPS evaluation also allows us to set an upper limit on\n$\\sigma_{\\rm eff}$ driving the size of the DPS yield. Overall, the discrepancy\nbetween theory and experiment may be smaller than expected, which calls for\nfurther analyses by ATLAS and CMS, for which we provide predictions, and for\nfull NLO computations in other models. As an interesting side product of our\nanalysis, we have performed the first NLO computation of $d\\sigma / dP_T$ for\nprompt single-$J/\\psi$ production in the CEM from which we have fit the CEM\nnon-pertubative parameter at NLO using the most recent ATLAS data.\n", "  A common problem which is faced by the researchers when dealing with arterial\ncarotid imaging data is the registration of the geometrical structures between\ndifferent imaging modalities or different timesteps. The use of the \"Patient\nPosition\" DICOM field is not adequate to achieve accurate results due to the\nfact that the carotid artery is a relatively small structure and even\nimperceptible changes in patient position and/or direction make it difficult.\nWhile there is a wide range of simple/advanced registration techniques in the\nliterature, there is a considerable number of studies which address the\ngeometrical structure of the carotid artery without using any registration\ntechnique. On the other hand the existence of various registration techniques\nprohibits an objective comparison of the results using different registration\ntechniques. In this paper we present a method for estimating the statistical\nsignificance that the choice of the registration technique has on the carotid\ngeometry. One-Way Analysis of Variance(ANOVA) showed that the p-values were\n<0.0001 for the distances of the lumen from the centerline for both right and\nleft carotids of the patient case that was studied.\n", "  In this paper we define, independent of theories, two discriminant matrices\ninvolving a solution to the scattering equations in four dimensions, the ranks\nof which are used to divide the solution set into a disjoint union of subsets.\nWe further demonstrate, {entirely within the Cachazo-He-Yuan formalism,} that\neach subset of solutions gives nonzero contribution to tree-level\n$\\text{N}^{k}\\text{MHV}$ gauge/gravity amplitudes only for a specific value of\n$k$. Thus the solutions can be characterized by the rank of their discriminant\nmatrices, which in turn determines the value of $k$ of the $\\text{N}^{k}\n\\text{MHV}$ amplitudes a solution can support. As another application of the\ntechnique developed, we show analytically that in Einstein-Yang-Mills theory,\nif all gluons have the same helicity, the tree-level single-trace amplitudes\nmust vanish.\n", "  A radiative model of quark and lepton masses utilizing the binary tetrahedral\n($T^{\\prime}$) flavor symmetry, or horizontal symmetry, is proposed which\nproduces the first two generation of quark masses through their interactions\nwith vector-like quarks that carry charges under an additional $U(1)$. By\nsoftly-breaking the $T^{\\prime}$ to a residual $Z_4$ through the vector-like\nquark masses, a CKM mixing angle close to the Cabibbo angle is produced. In\norder to generate the cobimaximal neutrino oscillation pattern\n($\\theta_{13}\\neq0,\\theta_{23}=\\pi/4,\\delta_{CP}=\\pm \\pi/2$) and protect the\nhorizontal symmetry from arbitrary corrections in the lepton sector, there are\nautomatically two stabilizing symmetries in the dark sector. Several benchmark\ncases where the correct relic density is achieved in a multi-component DM\nscenario, as well as the potential collider signatures of the vector-like\nquarks are discussed.\n", "  We develop a new class of supergravity cosmological models where inflation is\ninduced by terms in the K\\\"ahler potential which mix a nilpotent superfield $S$\nwith a chiral sector $\\Phi$. As the new terms are non-(anti)holomorphic, and\nhence cannot be removed by a K\\\"ahler transformation, these models are\nintrinsically K\\\"ahler potential driven. Such terms could arise for example due\nto a backreaction of an anti-D3 brane on the string theory bulk geometry. We\nshow that this mechanism is very general and allows for a unified description\nof inflation and dark energy, with controllable SUSY breaking at the vacuum.\nWhen the internal geometry of the bulk field is hyperbolic, we prove that small\nperturbative K\\\"ahler corrections naturally lead to $\\alpha$-attractor\nbehaviour, with inflationary predictions in excellent agreement with the latest\nPlanck data\n", "  In view of the LHC upgrade phases towards the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC),\nthe ATLAS experiment plans to upgrade the Inner Detector with an all-silicon\nsystem. The n-on-p silicon technology is a promising candidate to achieve a\nlarge area instrumented with pixel sensors, since it is radiation hard and cost\neffective. The paper reports on the performance of novel n-on-p edgeless planar\npixel sensors produced by FBK-CMM, making use of the active trench for the\nreduction of the dead area at the periphery of the device. After discussing the\nsensor technology an overview of the first beam test results will be given.\n", "  Magnetic fields (B-fields) play a key role in the formation and evolution of\nprotoplanetary disks, but their properties are poorly understood due to the\nlack of observational constraints. Using CanariCam at the 10.4-m Gran\nTelescopio Canarias, we have mapped out the mid-infrared polarization of the\nprotoplanetary disk around the Herbig Ae star AB Aur. We detect ~0.44%\npolarization at 10.3 micron from AB Aur's inner disk (r < 80 AU), rising to\n~1.4% at larger radii. Our simulations imply that the mid-infrared polarization\nof the inner disk arises from dichroic emission of elongated particles aligned\nin a disk B-field. The field is well ordered on a spatial scale commensurate\nwith our resolution (~50 AU), and we infer a poloidal shape tilted from the\nrotational axis of the disk. The disk of AB Aur is optically thick at 10.3\nmicron, so polarimetry at this wavelength is probing the B-field near the disk\nsurface. Our observations therefore confirm that this layer, favored by some\ntheoretical studies for developing magneto-rotational instability and its\nresultant viscosity, is indeed very likely to be magnetized. At radii beyond\n~80 AU, the mid-infrared polarization results primarily from scattering by dust\ngrains with sizes up to ~1 micron, a size indicating both grain growth and,\nprobably, turbulent lofting of the particles from the disk mid-plane.\n", "  We demonstrate a plasmonic route to control the collective spontaneous\nemission of two-level quantum emitters. Superradiance and subradiance effects\nare observed over distances comparable to the operating wavelength inside\nplasmonic nanochannels. These plasmonic waveguides can provide an effective\nepsilon-near-zero operation in their cut-off frequency and Fabry-Perot\nresonances at higher frequencies. The related plasmonic resonant modes are\nfound to efficiently enhance the constructive (superradiance) or destructive\n(subradiance) interference between different quantum emitters located inside\nthe waveguides. By increasing the number of emitters located in the elongated\nplasmonic channel, the superradiance effect is enhanced at the\nepsilon-near-zero operation, leading to a strong coherent increase in the\ncollective spontaneous emission rate. In addition, the separation distance\nbetween neighboring emitters and their emission wavelengths can be changed to\ndynamically control the collective emission properties of the plasmonic system.\nIt is envisioned that the dynamic modification between quantum superradiant and\nsubradiant modes will find applications in quantum entanglement of qubits,\nlow-threshold nanolasers and efficient sensors.\n", "  FASPAX (Fermi-Argonne Semiconducting Pixel Array X-ray detector) is being\ndeveloped as a fast integrating area detector with wide dynamic range for time\nresolved applications at the upgraded Advanced Photon Source (APS.) A burst\nmode detector with intended $\\mbox{13 $MHz$}$ image rate, FASPAX will also\nincorporate a novel integration circuit to achieve wide dynamic range, from\nsingle photon sensitivity to $10^{\\text{5}}$ x-rays/pixel/pulse. To achieve\nthese ambitious goals, a novel silicon sensor design is required. This paper\nwill detail early design of the FASPAX sensor. Results from TCAD optimization\nstudies, and characterization of prototype sensors will be presented.\n", "  In this paper we describe an analytic method able to give the multiplication\ntable(s) of the set(s) involved in an $S$-expansion process (with either\nresonance or $0_S$-resonant-reduction) for reaching a target Lie (super)algebra\nfrom a starting one, after having properly chosen the partitions over subspaces\nof the considered (super)algebras. This analytic method gives us a simple set\nof expressions to find the partitions over the set(s) involved in the process.\nThen, we use the information coming from both the initial (super)algebra and\nthe target one for reaching the multiplication table(s) of the mentioned\nset(s). Finally, we check associativity with an auxiliary computational\nalgorithm, in order to understand whether the obtained set(s) can describe\nsemigroup(s) or just abelian set(s) connecting two (super)algebras. We also\ngive some interesting examples of application, which check and corroborate our\nanalytic procedure and also generalize some result already presented in the\nliterature.\n", "  We consider a Lagrangian of interacting scalar fields. We divide the\nLagrangian into two parts. The first part is to describe either the dark matter\n(DM) or the inflaton (IN) depending on the choice of the self-interaction. The\nsecond part constitutes an environment of an infinite number of scalar fields\ninteracting linearly with the first part. We approximate the environment by a\nwhite noise obtaining a Langevin equation. We show that the resulting\nFokker-Planck equation has solutions determining a relation between the\ndiffusion constant, the cosmological constant and the temperature. As a\nconsequence of the Langevin approximation the energy-momentum tensor of the\ndark matter and the inflaton is not conserved. The compensating energy-momentum\ntensor is interpreted as the dark energy (DE). We insert the total\nenergy-momentum in Einstein equations. We show that under special initial\nconditions Einstein equations have a solution with a constant ratio of DM/DE\nand IN/DE densities.\n", "  We develop a non-linear semi-parametric Gaussian process model to estimate\nperiods of Miras with sparsely-sampled light curves. The model uses a\nsinusoidal basis for the periodic variation and a Gaussian process for the\nstochastic changes. We use maximum likelihood to estimate the period and the\nparameters of the Gaussian process, while integrating out the effects of other\nnuisance parameters in the model with respect to a suitable prior distribution\nobtained from earlier studies. Since the likelihood is highly multimodal for\nperiod, we implement a hybrid method that applies the quasi-Newton algorithm\nfor Gaussian process parameters and search the period/frequency parameter over\na dense grid.\n  A large-scale, high-fidelity simulation is conducted to mimic the sampling\nquality of Mira light curves obtained by the M33 Synoptic Stellar Survey. The\nsimulated data set is publicly available and can serve as a testbed for future\nevaluation of different period estimation methods. The semi-parametric model\noutperforms an existing algorithm on this simulated test data set as measured\nby period recovery rate and quality of the resulting Period-Luminosity\nrelations.\n", "  We develop a general theory for describing phase coexistence between\nnonequilibrium steady states in Brownian systems, based on power functional\ntheory (M. Schmidt and J.M. Brader, J. Chem. Phys. 138, 214101 (2013)). We\napply the framework to the special case of fluid-fluid phase separation of\nactive soft sphere swimmers. The central object of the theory, the dissipated\nfree power, is calculated via computer simulations and compared to a simple\nanalytical approximation. The theory describes well the simulation data and\npredicts motility-induced phase separation due to avoidance of dissipative\nclusters.\n", "  We analyze the electronic structure in the three-dimensional (3D) crystal\nformed by the $sp^2$ hybridized orbitals ($K_4$ crystal), by the tight-binding\napproach based on the first-principles calculation. We discover that the bulk\nDirac-cone dispersions are realized in the $K_4$ crystal. In contrast to the\ngraphene, the energy dispersions of the Dirac cones are isotropic in 3D and the\npseudospin $S=1$ Dirac cones emerge at the $\\Gamma$ and $H$ points of the bcc\nBrillouin zone, where three bands become degenerate and merge at a single point\nbelonging to the $T_2$ irreducible representation. In addition, the usual\n$S=1/2$ Dirac cones emerge at the $P$ point. By focusing the hoppings between\nthe nearest-neighbor sites, we show an analytic form of the tight-binding\nHamiltonian with a $4\\times 4 $ matrix, and we give an explicit derivation of\nthe $S=1$ and $S=1/2$ Dirac-cone dispersions. We also analyze the effect of the\nspin-orbit coupling to examine how the degeneracies at Dirac points are lifted.\nAt the $S=1$ Dirac points, the spin-orbit coupling lifts the energy level with\nsixfold degeneracy into two energy levels with two-dimensional $\\bar E_2$ and\nfour-dimensional $\\bar F$ representations. Remarkably, all the dispersions near\nthe $\\bar F$ point show the linear dependence in the momentum with different\nvelocities. We derive the effective Hamiltonian near the $\\bar F$ point and\nfind that the band contact point is described by the $S=3/2$ Weyl point.\n", "  The measurement of the direction of WIMP-induced nuclear recoils is a\ncompelling but technologically challenging strategy to provide an unambiguous\nsignature of the detection of Galactic dark matter. Most directional detectors\naim to reconstruct the dark-matter-induced nuclear recoil tracks, either in gas\nor solid targets. The main challenge with directional detection is the need for\nhigh spatial resolution over large volumes, which puts strong requirements on\nthe readout technologies. In this paper we review the various detector readout\ntechnologies used by directional detectors. In particular, we summarize the\nchallenges, advantages and drawbacks of each approach, and discuss future\nprospects for these technologies.\n", "  In this paper, we study the observability of the top-Higgs flavor changing\nneutral current (FCNC) $tqh$ coupling through the process $pp\\to qg\\to t(\\to\n\\ell^{+}b\\nu)h(\\to \\gamma\\gamma)$ at the Large Hadron Collider~(LHC), where\n$\\ell=e, \\mu$. Our numerical results show that, in some parameter regions, the\nLHC may observe the above signals at the $5\\sigma$ level. Otherwise, the\nbranching ratios $Br(t\\to uh)$ and $Br(t\\to ch)$ can be respectively probed to\n$0.036\\%$ and $0.13\\%$ at $3\\sigma$ level at 14 TeV LHC with the high\nintegrated luminosity of 3000 fb$^{-1}$. On the other hand, studying the charge\nratio for the lepton in top quark decay can be not only used to discriminate\nbetween signal and backgrounds, but also used to discriminate between $tuh$ and\n$tch$ couplings, for which anomalous single top production comes from the up\ninitiated channel and charm initiated channel.\n", "  As a new step in the study of rectangularly-colored knot polynomials, we\nreformulate the prescription of arXiv:1606.06015 for twist knots in the\ndouble-column representations $R=[rr]$ in terms of skew Schur polynomials.\nThese, however, are mysteriously shifted from the standard topological locus,\nwhat makes further generalization to arbitrary $R=[r^s]$ not quite\nstraightforward.\n", "  We found the probability for the neutrinoless double electron capture in the\ncase of $KK$ capture. We clarified the mechanism of the energy transfer from\nthe nucleus to the bound electrons. This enabled us to obtain the equations for\nthe probability of the $2EC0\\nu$ process which modify those obtained earlier.\nWe found that the probability of the process is three orders of magnitude\nlarger than it was supposed earlier.\n", "  An anisotropic Kondo semiconductor CeOs$_2$Al$_{10}$ exhibits an unusual\nantiferromagnetic order at rather high transition temperature $T_0$ of 28.5 K.\nTwo possible origins of the magnetic order have been proposed so far, one is\nthe Kondo coupling of the hybridization between the conduction ($c$) and the\n$4f$ states and the other is the charge-density wave/charge ordering along the\northorhombic $b$ axis. To clarify the origin of the magnetic order, we have\ninvestigated the electronic structure of hole- and electron-doped\nCeOs$_2$Al$_{10}$ [Ce(Os$_{1-y}$Re$_y$)$_2$Al$_{10}$ and\nCe(Os$_{1-x}$Ir$_x$)$_2$Al$_{10}$, respectively] by using optical conductivity\nspectra along the $b$ axis. The intensity of the $c$-$f$ hybridization gap at\n$\\hbar\\omega\\sim50$ meV continuously decreases from $y=0.10$ to $x=0.12$ via\n$x=y=0$. The intensity of the charge excitation observed at $\\hbar\\omega\\sim20$\nmeV has the maximum at $x=y=0$ as similar with the doping dependence of $T_{\\rm\n0}$. The fact that the charge excitation is strongly related to the magnetic\norder strengthens the possibility of the charge density wave/charge ordering as\nthe origin of the magnetic order.\n", "  Realistic simulations of experiments at large scale photon facilities, such\nas optical laser laboratories, synchrotrons, and free electron lasers, are of\nvital importance for the successful preparation, execution, and analysis of\nthese experiments investigating ever more complex physical systems, e.g.\nbiomolecules, complex materials, and ultra-short lived states of highly excited\nmatter. Traditional photon science modelling takes into account only isolated\naspects of an experiment, such as the beam propagation, the photon-matter\ninteraction, or the scattering process, making idealized assumptions about the\nremaining parts, e.g.\\ the source spectrum, temporal structure and coherence\nproperties of the photon beam, or the detector response. In SIMEX, we have\nimplemented a platform for complete start-to-end simulations, following the\nradiation from the source, through the beam transport optics to the sample or\ntarget under investigation, its interaction with and scattering from the\nsample, and its registration in a photon detector, including a realistic model\nof the detector response to the radiation. Data analysis tools can be hooked up\nto the modelling pipeline easily. This allows researchers and facility\noperators to simulate their experiments and instruments in real life scenarios,\nidentify promising and unattainable regions of the parameter space and\nultimately make better use of valuable beamtime.\n  This work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported\nLicense: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/.\n", "  In this note we describe the theory of functional asynchronous networks and\none of the main results, the Modularization of Dynamics Theorem, which for a\nlarge class of functional asynchronous networks gives a factorization of\ndynamics in terms of constituent subnetworks. For these networks we can give a\ncomplete description of the network function in terms of the function of the\nevents comprising the network and thereby answer a question originally raised\nby Alon in the context of biological networks.\n", "  The newly discovered BaPt$_2$As$_2$ shows a structural distortion at around\n275~K, followed by the emergence of superconductivity at lower temperatures.\nHere we identify the presence of charge density wave (CDW) order at room\ntemperature and ambient pressure using single crystal x-ray diffraction, with\nboth a superlattice and an incommensurate modulation, where there is a change\nof the superlattice structure below $\\simeq$ 275~K. Upon applying pressure,\nBaPt$_2$As$_2$ shows a rich temperature-pressure phase diagram with multiple\npressure-induced transitions at high temperatures, the emergence or\ndisappearance of which are correlated with sudden changes in the\nsuperconducting transition temperature $T_c$. These findings demonstrate that\nBaPt$_2$As$_2$ is a promising new system for studying competing interactions\nand the relationship between high-temperature electronic instabilities and\nsuperconductivity.\n", "  A common feature in the thermodynamic analysis of homogeneous and isotropic\nworld models is the assumption that the temperature of the fluids inside the\ncosmic horizon (including dark energy) coincides with the temperature of the\nlatter, whether it be either the event or the apparent horizon. We examine up\nto what extent this assumption may be justified, given that these temperatures\nevolve under different time-temperature laws. We argue that while radiation\ncannot reach thermal equilibrium with the horizon, non-relativistic matter may,\nand dark energy might though only approximately.\n", "  Subregion duality in AdS/CFT implies certain constraints on the geometry:\nentanglement wedges must contain causal wedges, and nested boundary regions\nmust have nested entanglement wedges. We elucidate the logical connections\nbetween these statements and the Quantum Focussing Conjecture, Quantum Null\nEnergy Condition, Boundary Causality Condition, and Averaged Null Energy\nCondition. Our analysis does not rely on the classical limit of bulk physics,\nbut instead works to all orders in $G\\hbar \\sim 1/N$. This constitutes a\nnontrivial check on the consistency of subregion duality, entanglement wedge\nreconstruction, and holographic entanglement entropy beyond the classical\nregime.\n", "  The dynamic processes of magnetic reconnection and turbulence cause magnetic\nislands/flux-ropes generation. The in-situ observations suggest that the\ncoalescence or/and contraction of magnetic islands are responsible to the\ncharged particle acceleration (keV to MeV energy range). Numerical simulations\nalso support this acceleration mechanism. However, the most fundamental\nquestion raise here is, does this mechanism contribute to the cosmic rays\nacceleration? To answer this, we report, in-situ evidence of flux-ropes\nformation, their magnetic re-connection and its manifestation as cosmic ray\n(GeV charged particle) acceleration in interplanetary counterpart of coronal\nmass ejection(ICME). Further, we propose that cosmic ray (high and/or\nultra-high energy) acceleration by Fermi mechanism is valid not only through\nstochastic reflections of particles from the shock boundaries but also through\nthe boundaries of contracting magnetic islands or/and their merging via\nmagnetic re-connection. This has significant implications on cosmic ray origin\nand their acceleration process.\n", "  Valley-polarized currents can be generated by local straining of\nmulti-terminal graphene devices. The pseudo-magnetic field created by the\ndeformation allows electrons from only one valley to transmit and a current of\nelectrons from a single valley is generated at the opposite side of the locally\nstrained region. We show that valley filtering is most effective with bumps of\na certain height and width. Despite the fact that the highest contribution to\nthe polarized current comes from electrons from the lowest sub-band,\ncontributions of other sub-bands are not negligible and can significantly\nenhance the output current.\n", "  An active swimmer can tow a passive cargo by binding it to form a\nself-propelling dimer. The orientation of the cargo relative to the axis of the\nactive dimer's head is determined by the hydrodynamic interactions associated\nwith the propulsion mechanism of the latter. We show how the tower-cargo\nangular configuration greatly influences the dimer's diffusivity and,\ntherefore, the efficiency of the active swimmer as a micro-towing motor.\n", "  The performance of nitrogen vacancy (NV$^{-}$) based magnetic sensors\nstrongly depends on the stability of nitrogen vacancy centers near the diamond\nsurface. The sensitivity of magnetic field detection is diminished as the\nNV$^{-}$ turns into the neutralized charge state NV$^{0}$. We investigate the\nneutralization of NV$^{-}$ and calculate the ratio of NV$^{0}$ to total NV\n(NV$^{-}$+NV$^{0}$) caused by a hydrogen terminated diamond with a surface\nwater layer. We find that NV$^{-}$ neutralization exhibits two distinct\nregions: near the surface, where the NV$^{-}$ is completely neutralized, and in\nthe bulk, where the\\ neutralization ratio is inversely proportional to depth\nfollowing the electrostatic force law. In addition, small changes in\nconcentration can lead to large differences in neutralization behavior. This\nphenomenon allows one to carefully control the concentration to decrease the\nNV$^{-}$ neutralization. The presence of nitrogen dopant greatly reduces\nNV$^{-}$ neutralization as the nitrogen ionizes in preference to NV$^{-}$\nneutralization at the same depth. The water layer pH also affects\nneutralization. If the pH is very low due to cleaning agent residue, then we\nsee a change in the band bending and the reduction of the $2$-dimensional hole\ngas (DHG) region. Finally, we find that dissolved carbon dioxide resulting from\ndirect contact with the atmosphere at room temperature hardly affects the\nNV$^{-}$ neutralization.\n", "  We determine the absolute magnitude (H) distribution (or size-frequency\ndistribution, SFD; $N(H) \\propto 10^{\\alpha H}$ where $\\alpha$ is the slope of\nthe distribution) for near-Earth objects (NEO) with $13<H<30$ and Asteroid\nRetrieval Mission (ARM) targets with $27<H<31$ that were detected by the 1\\st\\\ntelescope of the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System -\nPan-STARRS1 (e.g. Kaiser et al. 2002, Kaiser 2004, Hodapp et al. 2004). The NEO\nand ARM target detection efficiencies were calculated using the Greenstreet et\nal. (2012) NEO orbit distribution. The debiased Pan-STARRS1 NEO absolute\nmagnitude distribution is more complex than a single slope power law - it shows\ntwo transitions - at H$\\sim$16 from steep to shallow slope, and in the\n$21<H<23$ interval from a shallow to steep slope, which is consistent with\nother recent works (e.g. Mainzer et al. 2011c, Brown et al. 2013, Harris and\nD`Abramo 2015). We fit $\\alpha = 0.48\\pm0.02$ for NEOs with $13<H<16$, $\\alpha\n= 0.33\\pm0.01$ for NEOs with $16<H<22$, and $\\alpha = 0.62\\pm0.03$ for the\nsmaller objects with $H>22$. There is also another change in slope from steep\nto shallow around H=27. The three ARM target candidates detected by Pan-STARRS1\nin one year of surveying have a corrected SFD with slope $\\alpha =\n0.40^{+0.33}_{-0.45}$.\n  We also show that the window for follow up observations of small\n(H$\\gtrsim$22) NEOs with the NASA IRTF telescope and Arecibo and Goldstone\nradars are extremely short - on order of days, and procedures for fast response\nmust be implemented in order to measure physical characteristics of small\nEarth-approaching objects. CFHT's MegaCam and Pan-STARRS1 have longer observing\nwindows and are capable of following-up more NEOs due to their deeper limiting\nmagnitudes and wider fields of view.\n", "  We have implemented the Tsallis q-statistics in the Weibull model of particle\nproduction known as the q-Weibull distribution to describe the\ntransverse-momentum (pT ) distribution of the charged hadrons at mid-rapidity\nmeasured at RHIC and LHC energies. The model describes the data remarkably well\nfor the entire pT range measured in nucleus-nucleus and nucleon-nucleon\ncollisions. The proposed distribution is based on the non-extensive Tsallis\nq-statistics which replaces the usual thermal equilibrium assumption of\nhydrodynamical models. The parameters of the distribution can be related to the\nvarious aspects of complex dynamics associated with such collision process.\n", "  To clarify how the electronic state of Sr1-xLaxRuO3 evolves with La doping,\nwe conducted photoemission (PES) experiments using soft x-rays. The spectral\nshape of the Ru 4d derived peak near the Fermi level changes significantly with\nincreasing x. This variation indicates that a spectral weight transfer from the\ncoherent to incoherent component occurs due to an enhancement of the electron\ncorrelation effect. Resonant PES experiments at the La 3d_{5/2} edge have\nconfirmed that there is no significant contribution of the La 5d state in the\nenergy range where the spectral weight transfer is observed. Using the\ndependence of the photoelectron mean free path on the photon energy, we\nsubtracted the surface components from the PES spectra and confirmed that the\nenhancement of the electron correlation effect with La doping is an intrinsic\nbulk phenomenon. On the other hand, a large portion of the coherent component\nremains at the Fermi level up to x = 0.5, reflecting that the Ru 4d state still\nhas itinerant characteristics. Moreover, we found that the PES spectra hardly\ndepend on the temperature and do not exhibit a discernible change with magnetic\nordering, suggesting that the temperature variation of the exchange splitting\ndoes not follow the prediction of the Stoner theory. The presently obtained\nexperimental results indicate that the electron correlation effect plays an\nimportant role in Sr1-xLaxRuO3 and that the Ru 4d electrons possess both local\nand itinerant characteristics.\n", "  A low temperature hydrothermal route has been developed, and pure phase\nBa$_2$Ni$_3$F$_{10}$ nanowires have been successfully prepared under the\noptimized conditions. Under the 325 nm excitation, the Ba$_2$Ni$_3$F$_{10}$\nnanowires exhibit three emission bands with peak positions locating at 360 nm,\n530 nm, and 700 nm, respectively. Combined with the first-principles\ncalculations, the photoluminescence property can be explained by the electron\ntransitions between the t2g and eg orbitals. Clear hysteresis loops observed\nbelow the temperature of 60 K demonstrates the weak ferromagnetism in\nBa$_2$Ni$_3$F$_{10}$ nanowires, which has been attributed to the surface strain\nof nanowires. Exchange bias with blocking temperature of 55 K has been\nobserved, which originates from the magnetization pinning under the cooling\nfield due to antiferromagnetic core/weak ferromagnetic shell structure of\nBa2Ni3F10 nanowires.\n", "  One of the most accurate approaches for calculating lattice thermal\nconductivity, $\\kappa_l$, is solving the Boltzmann transport equation starting\nfrom third-order anharmonic force constants. In addition to the underlying\napproximations of ab-initio parameterization, two main challenges are\nassociated with this path. High computational costs and lack of automation in\nthe frameworks using this methodology affect the discovery rate of novel\nmaterials with ad-hoc properties. Here, we present the\nAutomatic-Anharmonic-Phonon-Library, AAPL. It efficiently computes interatomic\nforce constants by making effective use of crystal symmetry analysis, it solves\nthe Boltzmann transport equation to obtain $\\kappa_l$, and allows a fully\nintegrated operation with minimum user intervention, a rational addition to the\ncurrent high-throughput accelerated materials development framework AFLOW. We\nshow an \"experiment versus theory\" study of the approach, we compare accuracy\nand speed with respect to other available packages, and for materials\ncharacterized by strong electron localization and correlation, we demonstrate\nthat it is possible to improve accuracy without increasing computational\nrequirements by combining AAPL with the pseudo-hybrid functional ACBN0.\n", "  We prove that conformal nets of finite index are an instance of the notion of\na factorization algebra. This result is an ingredient in our proof that, for\n$G=SU(n)$, the Drinfel'd center of the category of positive energy\nrepresentations of the based loop group is equivalent to the category of\npositive energy representations of the free loop group.\n", "  We study an interacting spinless Bose-Einstein condensate to clarify\ntheoretically whether the spectra of its quasiparticles (one-particle\nexcitations) and collective modes (two-particle excitations) are identical, as\nconcluded by Gavoret and Nozi\\`eres [Ann. Phys. 28, 349 (1964)]. We derive\nanalytic expressions for their first and second moments so as to extend the\nBijl-Feynman formula for the peak of the collective-mode spectrum to its width\n(inverse lifetime) and also to the one-particle channel. The obtained formulas\nindicate that the width of the collective-mode spectrum manifestly vanishes in\nthe long-wavelength limit, whereas that of the quasiparticle spectrum\napparently remains finite. We also evaluate the peaks and widths of the two\nspectra numerically for a model interaction potential in terms of the Jastrow\nwave function optimized by a variational method. It is thereby found that the\nwidth of the quasiparticle spectrum increases towards a constant as the\nwavenumber decreases. This marked difference in the spectral widths implies\nthat the two spectra are distinct. In particular, the lifetime of the\nquasiparticles remains finite even in the long-wavelength limit.\n", "  We present electronic structure calculations of a CrO$_{2}$ compound in the\nparamagnetic state within the computational scheme of density-functional theory\ncombined with dynamical mean-field theory. We find that CrO$_{2}$ in the\nparamagnetic state is a strongly-correlated Hund's metal with mixed-valent Cr\nions. At high temperatures, CrO$_{2}$ shows an orbital-selective Mott phase, in\nwhich the Cr $d_{xy}$ orbital is Mott-localized while the other Cr $t_{2g}$ $d$\norbitals remain itinerant. When the temperature is lowered, the\norbital-selective Mott state is found to evolve into a Kondo-like heavy-fermion\nstate with a small pseudo gap at the Fermi level if the system remains in the\nparamagnetic state.\n", "  Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to understand the role of twin\nboundaries on deformation behaviour of body-centred cubic (BCC) iron (Fe)\nnanopillars. The twin boundaries varying from one to five providing twin\nboundary spacing in the range 8.5 - 2.8 nm were introduced perpendicular to the\nloading direction. The simulation results indicated that the twin boundaries in\nBCC Fe play a contrasting role during deformation under tensile and compressive\nloadings. During tensile deformation, a large reduction in yield stress was\nobserved in twinned nanopillars compared to perfect nanopillar. However, the\nyield stress exhibited only marginal variation with respect to twin boundary\nspacing. On the contrary, a decrease in yield stress with increase in twin\nboundary spacing was obtained during compressive deformation. This contrasting\nbehaviour originates from difference in operating mechanisms during yielding\nand subsequent plastic deformation. It has been observed that the deformation\nunder tensile loading was dominated mainly by twin growth mechanism, due to\nwhich the twin boundaries offers a negligible resistance to slip of twinning\npartials. This is reflected in the negligible variation of yield stress as a\nfunction of twin boundary spacing. On the other hand, the deformation was\ndominated by nucleation and slip of full dislocations under compressive\nloading. The twin boundaries offer a strong repulsive force on full\ndislocations resulting in the yield stress dependence on twin boundary spacing.\nFurther, it has been observed that the curved twin boundary can acts as a\nsource for full dislocation. The occurrence of twin-twin interaction during\ntensile deformation and dislocation-twin interaction during compressive\ndeformation were presented and discussed.\n", "  This article reviews low-temperature heat transport studies of spin-gapped\nquantum magnets in the last few decades. Quantum magnets with small spins and\nlow dimensionality exhibit a variety of novel phenomena. Among them, some\nsystems are char-acteristic of having quantum-mechanism spin gap in their\nmagnetic excitation spectra, including spin-Peierls systems, S = 1 Haldane\nchains, S = 1/2 spin ladders, and spin dimmers. In some particular spin-gapped\nsystems, the XY-type antiferromagnetic state induced by magnetic field that\ncloses the spin gap can be described as a magnon Bose-Einstein condensation\n(BEC). Heat transport is effective in probing the magnetic excitations and\nmagnetic phase transitions, and has been extensively studied for the\nspin-gapped systems. A large and ballistic spin thermal conductivity was\nobserved in the two-leg Heisenberg S = 1/2 ladder compounds. The characteristic\nof magnetic thermal transport of the Haldane chain systems is quite\ncontroversial on both the theoretical and experimental results. For the\nspin-Peierls system, the spin excitations can also act as heat carriers. In\nspin-dimer compounds, the magnetic excitations mainly play a role of scattering\nphonons. The magnetic excitations in the magnon BEC systems displayed dual\nroles, carrying heat or scattering phonons, in different materials.\n", "  A theoretical model is provided to address the parameters influencing the\nelectronic properties of kink-structured carbon chain at 0K. It is studied by\nthe principle of DFT and solving the numerical 1D time-independent\nSchr\\\"odinger equation of electron and phonon simultaneously. Two different\nlengths of branches A and B, are occupied alternatively to generate the\nasymmetric carbon chain. The ratio of the asymmetric branch length,RAB=A/B,\nplays an important role in the electronic density of states DOS around Fermi\nlevel Ef . The highest DOS(Ef) occurs if the RAB equals to 2 and while the\nFermi level coincides with the Von-Hove singularity at RAB=3. The location of\nthe singularity point relative to the Ef is controllable via branch length\ninterestingly. By comparison with the symmetric case, tuning the branch length\nasymmetrically shows a stronger impact to shift the Ef to the singularity\npoint. The numerical solution of the 1D time independent Schrodinger equation\nof phonon indicates that the kink reinforces the charge fluctuations but the\nfluctuations are minimized when the RAB goes up. Based on the simulation\nresults, the electron phonon coupling of the carbon nanowire decreases with\nchain length. In comparison to the symmetric structure, the electron phonon\ncoupling of the asymmetric carbon chain is higher. The maximum electron phonon\ncoupling of the asymmetric carbon chain takes place at RAB=2 . However, the\nweakening of the electron phonon coupling is observed owing to ultrahigh\nconcentration of kinks. The reduction of the electron phonon coupling of the\ncarbon chain is occurred under pressure.\n", "  In outside the body HIFU treatment that focused ultrasound beams hit severely\nwith cancer tissue layer especially the soft one, at the time of passage of the\nbody different layers as long as they want to reach tumor, put their own way\ncomponents under mechanical and even thermal influence and they can cause skin\nlesions. To reduce this effect a specific mechanical model can be used that\nmeans body tissue is considered as a mechanical model, it is affected when\npassing sound mechanical waves through it and each layer has an average heat.\nGradually sound intensity decreases through every layer passage, finally in one\ndirection a decreased intensity sound reach tumor tissue. If sound propagated\ndirections increase, countless waves with decreased intensity are gathered upon\nthe tumor tissue that causes a lot of heat focus on tumor tissue. Depending on\nthe kind and mechanical properties of the tissue, intensity of each sound wave\nwhen it passes through tissue can be controlled to reduce damages outside the\ntumor tissue.\n", "  A model algorithm is proposed to study subsequent partitions of complex\nnetworks describing social structures. The partitions are supposed to appear as\nactions of rivaling leaders corresponding to nodes with large degrees. The\ncondition of a partition is that the distance between two leaders is at least\nthree links. This ensures that the layer of nearest neighbours of each leader\nremains attached to him. As a rule, numerically calculated size distribution of\nfragments of scale-free Albert-Barabasi networks reveals one large fragment\nwhich contains the original leader (hub of the network), and a number of small\nfragments with opponents that are described by two Weibull distributions.\nNumerical simulations and mean-field theory reveal that size of the larger\nfragment scales as the square root of the initial network size. The algorithm\nis applied to the data on political blogs in U.S. (L. Adamic and N. Glance,\nProc. WWW-2005). The obtained fragments are clearly polarized; either they\nbelong to Democrats, or to the GOP.\n", "  Top quark physics measurements performed using data from the ATLAS detector\nat the LHC rely on efficient reconstruction and precise calibration of leptons,\njets and missing transverse energy. A review of the techniques used to\nreconstruct such objects is given, with an emphasis on the uncertainties\nachieved for energy calibration and efficiency measurements, illustrated with\ntheir impact on key top quark physics results.\n", "  We present here the linear regime of the Einstein's field equations in the\ncharacteristic formulation. Through a simple decomposition of the metric\nvariables in spin-weighted spherical harmonics, the field equations are\nexpressed as a system of coupled ordinary differential equations. The process\nfor decoupling them leads to a simple equation for $J$ - one of the Bondi-Sachs\nmetric variables - known in the literature as the master equation. Then, this\nlast equation is solved in terms of Bessel's functions of the first kind for\nthe Minkowski's background, and in terms of the Heun's function in the\nSchwarzschild's case. In addition, when a matter source is considered, the\nboundary conditions across the time-like world tubes bounding the source are\ntaken into account. These boundary conditions are computed for all multipole\nmodes. Some examples as the point particle binaries in circular and eccentric\norbits, in the Minkowski's background are shown as particular cases of this\nformalism.\n", "  We construct explicit spin configurations for the breather solution of a\none-dimensional Heisenberg ferromagnetic spin system. This corresponds to the\nbreather soliton solution of the gauge equivalent nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequation. There are three broad cases, wherein the solution shows distinct\nbehavior. Of particular interest to our study is the rogue behavior in spin\nfield terms.\n", "  The JAXA Hayabusa-2 mission was approved in 2010 and launched on December 3,\n2014. The spacecraft will arrive at the near-Earth asteroid 162173 Ryugu in\n2018 where it will perform a survey, land and obtain surface material, then\ndepart in Dec 2019 and return to Earth in Dec 2020. We observed Ryugu with the\nHerschel Space Observatory in Apr 2012 at far-IR thermal wavelengths, supported\nby several ground-based observations to obtain optical lightcurves. We\nreanalysed previously published Subaru-COMICS and AKARI-IRC observations and\nmerged them with a Spitzer-IRS data set. In addition, we used a large set of\nSpitzer-IRAC observations obtained in the period Jan to May, 2013. The data set\nincludes two complete rotational lightcurves and a series of ten\n\"point-and-shoot\" observations. The almost spherical shape of the target\ntogether with the insufficient lightcurve quality forced us to combine\nradiometric and lightcurve inversion techniques in different ways to find the\nobject's key physical and thermal parameters. We find that the solution which\nbest matches our data sets leads to this C class asteroid having a retrograde\nrotation with a spin-axis orientation of (lambda = 310-340 deg; beta = -40+/-15\ndeg) in ecliptic coordinates, an effective diameter (of an equal-volume sphere)\nof 850 to 880 m, a geometric albedo of 0.044 to 0.050 and a thermal inertia in\nthe range 150 to 300 Jm-2s-0.5K-1. Based on estimated thermal conductivities of\nthe top-layer surface in the range 0.1 to 0.6 WK-1m-1, we calculated that the\ngrain sizes are approximately equal to between 1 and 10 mm. The finely\nconstrained values for this asteroid serve as a `design reference model', which\nis currently used for various planning, operational and modelling purposes by\nthe Hayabusa2 team.\n", "  We prove that $t$-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equations on finite-dimensional\nHilbert spaces determined by $t$-dependent Hermitian Hamiltonian operators can\nbe described through Lie systems admitting a Vessiot--Guldberg Lie algebra of\nK\\\"ahler vector fields. This result is extended to other related Schr\\\"odinger\nequations, e.g. projective ones, and their properties are studied through\nPoisson, presymplectic and K\\\"ahler structures. This leads to derive nonlinear\nsuperposition rules for them depending in a lower (or equal) number of\nsolutions than standard linear ones. Special attention is paid to applications\nin $n$-qubit systems.\n", "  Density functional theory (DFT) studies of weakly interacting complexes have\nrecently focused on the importance of van der Waals dispersion forces whereas,\nthe role of exchange has received far less attention. Here, by exploiting the\nsubtle binding between water and a boron and nitrogen doped benzene derivative\n(1,2-azaborine) we show how exact exchange can alter the binding conformation\nwithin a complex. Benchmark values have been calculated for three orientations\nof the water monomer on 1,2-azaborine from explicitly correlated quantum\nchemical methods, and we have also used diffusion quantum Monte Carlo. For a\nhost of popular DFT exchange-correlation functionals we show that the lack of\nexact exchange leads to the wrong lowest energy orientation of water on\n1,2-azaborine. As such, we suggest that a high proportion of exact exchange and\nthe associated improvement in the electronic structure could be needed for the\naccurate prediction of physisorption sites on doped surfaces and in complex\norganic molecules. Meanwhile to predict correct absolute interaction energies\nan accurate description of exchange needs to be augmented by dispersion\ninclusive functionals, and certain non-local van der Waals functionals (optB88-\nand optB86b-vdW) perform very well for absolute interaction energies. Through a\ncomparison with water on benzene and borazine (B$_3$N$_3$H$_6$) we show that\nthese results could have implications for the interaction of water with doped\ngraphene surfaces, and suggest a possible way of tuning the interaction energy.\n", "  We study scalar QCD at nonzero density in the strong coupling limit. It has a\nsign problem which looks structurally similar to the one in QCD. We show first\ndata for the reweighting factor. After introducing dual variables by\nintegrating out the SU(3) gauge links, we find that at least 3 flavors are\nneeded for a nontrivial dependence on the chemical potential. In this dual\nrepresentation there is no sign problem remaining. The dual variables are\npartially constrained, thus we propose to use a hybrid approach for the\nupdates: For unconstrained variables local updates can be used, while for\nconstrained variables using updates based on the worm algorithm is more\npromising.\n", "  Experimental results on the metal-insulator transition and related phenomena\nin strongly interacting two-dimensional electron systems are discussed. Special\nattention is given to recent results for the strongly enhanced spin\nsusceptibility, effective mass, and thermopower in low-disordered silicon\nMOSFETs.\n", "  We present a comparative study of the magnetic and electrical properties of\npolycrystalline and nanocrystalline Y2Ir2O7, the latter prepared using a new\nchemical route. We find that reduction in particle size leads to enhanced\nferromagnetism and orders of magnitude enhancement of electrical conductivity\nin the nanocrystalline sample. Based on x ray photoelectron spectroscopy and x\nray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy results, the phenomenon is\nattributed to the increased fraction of pentavalent oxidation state of Iridium\nand the resulting increase in double exchange interaction along with the\nweakening of spin orbit coupling strength in the nanocrystalline sample\ncompared to the bulk.\n", "  We consider weak gravity at accelerations $\\alpha<a_H$ when Rindler and\ncosmological horizon collude at $R_H=c/H$, where $c$ is the velocity of light\nand $H$ is the Hubble parameter. This is manifest in reduced inertia $m$, below\nthe value $m_0$ in Newtonian gravity. Striking evidence for a sharp transition\nto weak gravity is found in galaxy rotation curves. Their sensitivity to the\ncosmological background is expressed by correlations to the deceleration\nparameter $q=1-(4\\pi a_0/cH)^{2}$ and $q=-1/2 -3\n(\\Omega_b/\\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{\\pi})^{1/2}$, where $a_0$ is Milgrom's scale in the\nbaryonic Tully-Fisher relation of spiral galaxies and $\\Omega_b$ is the\nbaryonic matter density. The Planck value $\\Omega_b=0.048$ with $H\\simeq 73$ km\ns$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ shows $q\\simeq-0.85$. Future surveys may determine\n$Q_0=\\left.dq(z)/dz\\right|_{z=0}$ to provide a direct test for dynamical dark\nenergy ($Q_0>2.5$) versus $\\Lambda$CDM ($Q_0<1$).\n", "  Establishing a reliable communication interface between the brain and\nelectronic devices is of paramount importance for exploiting the full potential\nof neural prostheses. Current microelectrode technologies for recording\nelectrical activity, however, evidence important shortcomings, e.g. challenging\nhigh density integration. Solution-gated field-effect transistors (SGFETs), on\nthe other hand, could overcome these shortcomings if a suitable transistor\nmaterial were available. Graphene is particularly attractive due to its\nbiocompatibility, chemical stability, flexibility, low intrinsic electronic\nnoise and high charge carrier mobilities. Here, we report on the use of an\narray of flexible graphene SGFETs for recording spontaneous slow waves, as well\nas visually evoked and also pre-epileptic activity in vivo in rats. The\nflexible array of graphene SGFETs allows mapping brain electrical activity with\nexcellent signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), suggesting that this technology could\nlay the foundation for a future generation of in vivo recording implants.\n", "  By analyzing hot-wire velocity data taken in an open channel flow, an\nunambiguous definition of surface-layer thickness is here provided in terms of\nthe cross-over scale between backward and forward energy fluxes. It is shown\nthat the turbulence in the surface layer does not conform to the classical\ndescription of two-dimensional turbulence, since the direct energy cascade\npersists at scales smaller than the cross-over scale, comparable with the\ndistance from the free-surface.\n  The multifractal analysis of the one-dimensional surrogate of the turbulent\nkinetic energy dissipation rate in terms of generalized dimensions and\nsingularity spectrum indicates that intermittency is strongly depleted in the\nsurface layer, as shown by the singularity spectrum contracted to a single\npoint.\n  The combination of intermittency indicators and energy fluxes allowed to\nidentify the specific nature of the surface layer as alternative to classical\nparadigms of three- and two-dimensional turbulence which cannot fully capture\nthe global behavior of turbulence near a free-surface.\n", "  Renewed interest has been witnessed in utilizing the piezoelectric response\nof $PbZr_{0.52}Ti_{0.48}O_{3}$ (PZT) films on glass substrates for applications\nsuch as data storage and adaptive optics. Accordingly, new methodologies are\nbeing explored to grow well-oriented PZT thin films to harvest a large\npiezoelectric response. However, thin film piezoelectric response is\nsignificantly reduced compared to intrinsic response due to substrate induced\nclamping, even when films are well-oriented. Here, a novel method is presented\nto grow preferentially (100)-oriented PZT films on glass substrates by\nutilizing crystalline nanosheets as seed layers. Furthermore, increasing the\nrepetition frequency up to 20 Hz during pulsed laser deposition helps to tune\nthe film microstructure to hierarchically ordered columns that leads to reduced\nclamping and enhanced piezoelectric response evidenced by transmission electron\nmicroscopy and analytical calculations. A large piezoelectric response of 280\npm/V is observed in optimally tuned structure which almost triples the highest\nreported piezoelectric response on glass. To confirm that the clamping\ncompromises the piezoelectric response, denser films are deposited using a\nlower repetition frequency and a $BiFeO_{3}$ buffer layer resulting in\nsignificantly reduced piezoelectric responses. This paper demonstrates a novel\nmethod for PZT integration on glass substrates without compromising the large\npiezoelectric response.\n", "  Astrophysical neutrinos are powerful tools to study fundamental properties of\nparticle physics. We perform a general new physics study on ultra high energy\nneutrino flavor content by introducing effective operators. We find that at the\ncurrent limits on these operators, new physics terms cause maximal effects on\nthe flavor content, however, the flavor content at Earth is confined to a\nregion related to the initial flavor content.\n", "  We revisit the production of baryon asymmetries in the minimal type I seesaw\nmodel with heavy Majorana singlets in the GeV range. We include \"washout\"\neffects from scattering processes with gauge bosons, higgs decays and inverse\ndecays, besides the dominant top scatterings. We show that in the minimal model\nwith two singlets, and for an inverted light neutrino ordering, future\nmeasurements from SHiP and neutrinoless double beta decay could in principle\nprovide sufficient information to predict the matter-antimatter asymmetry in\nthe universe.\n", "  Far from being just a 2-level Quantum system the Qubit is a Unit Quaternion,\nalso known as a Spinor. Therefore it follows that the Qubit is a 4-dimensional\nvector which traces a path on the surface of the unit 3-sphere. This is the\nmeaning of the global phase.\n", "  We study the violent phase of the merger of massive binary white dwarf\nsystems. Our aim is to characterize the conditions for explosive burning to\noccur, and identify a possible explosion mechanism of Type Ia supernovae. The\nprimary components of our model systems are carbon-oxygen (C/O) white dwarfs,\nwhile the secondaries are made either of C/O or of pure helium. We account for\ntidal effects in the initial conditions in a self-consistent way, and consider\ninitially well-separated systems with slow inspiral rates. We study the merger\nevolution using an adaptive mesh refinement, reactive, Eulerian code in three\ndimensions, assuming symmetry across the orbital plane. We use a co-rotating\nreference frame to minimize the effects of numerical diffusion, and solve for\nself-gravity using a multi-grid approach. We find a novel detonation mechanism\nin C/O mergers with massive primaries. Here the detonation occurs in the\nprimary's core and relies on the combined action of tidal heating, accretion\nheating, and self-heating due to nuclear burning. The exploding structure is\ncompositionally stratified, with a reverse shock formed at the surface of the\ndense ejecta. The existence of such a shock has not been reported elsewhere.\nThe explosion energy ($1.6\\times 10^{51}$ erg) and $^{56}$Ni mass (0.86\nM$_\\odot$) are consistent with a SN Ia at the bright end of the luminosity\ndistribution, with an approximated decline rate of $\\Delta m_{15}(B)\\approx\n0.99$. Our study does not support double-detonation scenarios in the case of a\nsystem with a 0.6 M$_\\odot$ helium secondary and a 0.9 M$_\\odot$ primary.\nAlthough the accreted helium detonates, it fails to ignite carbon at the base\nof the boundary layer or in the primary's core.\n", "  Centaurs are objects whose orbits are found between those of the giant\nplanets. They are supposed to originate mainly from the TransNeptunian objects,\nand they are among the sources of NearEarth Objects.TransNeptunian Objects\n(TNOs) cross Neptune's orbit and produce the Centaurs. We investigate their\ninteractions with main belt asteroids to determine if chaotic scattering caused\nby close encounters and impacts by these bodies may have played a role in the\ndynamical evolution of the main belt. We find that Centaurs and TNOs that reach\nthe inner Solar System can modify the orbits of main belt asteroids, though\nonly if their mass is of the order of 1 billion less the mass of the sun for\nsingle encounters or, one order less in the case of multiple close encounters.\nCentaurs and TNOs are unlikely to have significantly dispersed young asteroid\nfamilies in the main belt, but they can have perturbed some old asteroid\nfamilies. Current main belt asteroids that originated as Centaurs or\nTrans-Neptunian Objects may lie in the outer belt with short lifetime less than\n4 My, most likely between 2.8 au and 3.2 au at larger eccentricities than\ntypical of main belt asteroids.\n", "  We use a sample of \\textit{Swift} gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) to analyze the\nAmati and Yonetoku correlations. The first relation is between $E_{p,i}$, the\nintrinsic peak energy of the prompt GRB emission, and $E_{iso}$, the equivalent\nisotropic energy. The second relation is between $E_{p,i}$ and $L_{iso}$, the\nisotropic peak luminosity. We select a sample of 71 \\textit{Swift} GRBs that\nhave a measured redshift and whose observed $E^{obs}_p$ is within the interval\nof energy 15-150 keV with a relative uncertainty of less than 70\\%. We seek to\nfind correlation relations for long-duration GRBs (LGRBs) with a peak photon\nflux $P_{ph}\\geq 2.6~ \\mathrm{ph/cm^{2}/s}$. Uncertainties (error bars) on the\nvalues of the calculated energy flux \\textit{P}, the energy $E_{iso}$, and the\npeak isotropic luminosity $L_{iso}$ are estimated using a Monte Carlo approach.\nWe find 27 \\textit{Swift} LGRBs that satisfy all our constraints. Results of\nour analyses of the sample of 71 GRBs and the selected subsample (27 GRBs) are\nin good agreement with published results. The plots of the two relations for\nall bursts show a large dispersion around the best straight lines in the sample\nof 71 LGRBs but not so much in the subsample of 27 GRBs.\n", "  A numerical thought experiment with two momentum correlated particles is\npresented, in which particle A passes through a series of zig-zagging slits and\nparticle B moves unobstructedly. It is shown that, if particle A's meandering\npath is monitored by successive non-detections, particle B will loosely adhere\nto a similar trajectory without violating momentum conservation. The discussion\nrelates this apparent telekinetic influence, which is a standard quantum\nmechanical result, to supposedly real telekinesis and to Stapp's hypothesis on\nintention in quantum physics.\n", "  We present new spectroscopic observations of two high redshift radio\ngalaxies, TXS 0211-122 (z=2.34) and TXS 0828+193 (z=2.57), known to be\nassociated with large Ly$\\alpha$ halos. The observations were taken with the\nslits placed perpendicularly to the radio axis. With access to pre-existing\nKeck II observations taken with the slit placed along the radio axis we are\nable to compare the properties of the gas in different regions of the galaxies.\n  In both objects we detect spatially extended Ly$\\alpha$ emission\nperpendicularly to the radio axis. In TXS 0211-122, the flux and velocity\nprofiles of Ly$\\alpha$ are strongly affected by HI absorption/scattering. In\nline with previous studies, we find evidence for outflowing gas along the radio\naxis which may be the result of jet-gas interactions. In the slit oriented\nperpendicularly to the radio axis we find less perturbed gas kinematics,\nsuggesting outflows of ionized gas in this object are focused along the radio\njet axis. Additionally, we find evidence for a giant, UV-emitting arc or\nshell-like structure surrounding the radio galaxy Ly$\\alpha$ halo, possibly\nresulting from feedback activity.\n  In TXS 0828+193 a large Ly$\\alpha$ halo ($\\sim$56 kpc) is detected\nperpendicularly to the radio axis. Along both slit position angles we find\nevidence for outflowing gas, which we argue is part of an approximately\nspherical, expanding shell or bubble of gas powered by feedback activity in the\ncentral regions of the galaxy. Our results suggest a diversity in the spatial\ndistribution of ionized outflows in powerful radio galaxies at z$\\sim$2.5.\n", "  The spectrum of the two-dimensional continuum Dirac operator in the presence\nof a uniform background magnetic field consists of Landau levels, which are\ndegenerate and separated by gaps. On the lattice the Landau levels are spread\nout by discretization artefacts, but a remnant of their structure is clearly\nvisible (Hofstadter butterfly). If one switches on a non-Abelian interaction,\nthe butterfly structure will be smeared out, but the lowest Landau level (LLL)\nwill still be separated by a gap from the rest of the spectrum. In this talk we\ndiscuss how one can define the LLL in QCD and check how well certain physical\nquantities are approximated by taking into account only the LLL.\n", "  We review the ALPHA collaboration strategy for obtaining the QCD coupling at\nhigh scale. In the three-flavor effective theory it avoids the use of\nperturbation theory at $\\alpha > 0.2$ and at the same time has the physical\nscales small compared to the cutoff $1/a$ in all stages of the computation. The\nresult $\\Lambda_\\overline{MS}^{(3)}=332(14)$~MeV is translated to\n$\\alpha_\\overline{MS}(m_Z)=0.1179(10)(2)$ by use of (high order) perturbative\nrelations between the effective theory couplings at the charm and beauty quark\n\"thresholds\". The error of this perturbative step is discussed and estimated as\n$0.0002$.\n", "  A strongly first-order electroweak phase transition is a necessary\nrequirement for Electroweak Baryogenesis. We investigate the plausibility of\nobtaining a strong phase transition in a Two-Higgs-Doublet Model of type II\nwith a minimal amount of $CP$ violation. By performing a Bayesian fit where we\nconstrain the scalar sector with indirect and direct measurements, we find that\ncurrent data disfavours a first-order phase transition in this model. This\nresult is mainly driven by the interplay of three effects: Constraints from the\nLHC Higgs data on the magnitude of the quartic couplings, the requirement of a\n$H^\\pm$ heavier than around 490 GeV to avoid large contributions to $BR(b\n\\rightarrow s\\gamma)$ and the fact that a first-order phase transition requires\nrelatively light scalar states in addition to the 125 GeV Higgs. For similar\nreasons we find that a \"hidden-Higgs\" scenario, in which the 125 GeV state is\nidentified with the next-to-lightest scalar, is disfavoured by current data\nindependent of any requirement on the phase transition strength.\n", "  Maxwell Electrodynamics can be described either in Minkowski space-time or in\na dynamically equivalent way in a curved geometry constructed in terms of the\nelectromagnetic field. For this the field must have a superior bound limited by\na maximum value of its energy. After showing such geometric equivalence we\ninvestigate the possibility that new processes dependent on the metric\nstructure may appear. In particular for very high values of the field a direct\ncoupling of uncharged particles to the electromagnetic field is predicted.\n", "  Phase retrieval and imaging phase measurements are fields of intense\nresearch. It has recently been shown that phase retrieval from self-referencing\ninterferograms (SRI) can be reformulated leading to a stable, linear equation\nprovided the amplitude of the field is known from prior measurement steps\n(HOLOCAM). Consequently, the numerical solution thereof is straightforward.\nThis is a big achievement since convergence is otherwise not always guaranteed.\nApplications are expected in X-ray microscopy, general phase retrieval,\nholography, tomography and optical imaging.\n", "  Polycrystalline M-type hexagonal Strontium hexaferrite and its modified\nsystems by Cobalt (Co) and Titanium (Ti) were successfully prepared by the\nsolid state reaction method. The single phase formation of all the systems and\nwell grain growth of micrometer range was confirmed by X-ray diffraction\npattern and Scanning Electron Microscopic image respectively. The impedance\nspectroscopy and dielectric properties were investigated in a selected\nfrequency & temperature range. The room temperature M-H loop study for\nStrontium hexaferrite and Cobalt modified Strontium hexaferrite was carried out\nby Vibrate Sample Magnetometer. From the investigation it was found that, the\ngrain, grain boundary and electrode polarization have significant effect on\ndielectric relaxation and conduction mechanism for all the systems. From M-H\nloop study it was found that Co modified system has drastic reduction of\ncoercive field.\n", "  One trend in dark matter direct detection is the development of techniques\nwhich will lower experimental thresholds and achieve sensitivity to light mass\ndark matter particles. In doing so, it is necessary to have an understanding of\nthe low energy spectrum of the major background components. Geant4 has a number\nof specialized low energy physics processes that can be implemented when\nsimulating an experimental geometry. To understand this low energy region for\nthe Super Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (SuperCDMS), a variety of these models\nhave been simulated and compared against theoretical calculations and SuperCDMS\ncalibration data. Most of the low energy processes include a more complete\ndescription of the atomic structure, allowing us to observe the phenomenon of\nCompton steps in the simulation. An important application of this low energy\nbackground modeling is for the SuperCDMS low ionization threshold experiment\n(CDMSlite). CDMSlite has reached world-leading sensitivities in the search for\nlow mass weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter. Using\nNeganov-Trofinov-Luke phonon amplification, CDMSlite has achieved a threshold\nof less than 60 eV for electron recoils. The dark matter sensitivity of the\nCDMSlite-Soudan data can be improved by understanding and modeling the\nexperimental backgrounds down to this threshold. Development of the machinery\nfor creating a low energy background model will also be useful in the future\nSuperCDMS-SNOLAB experiment which will run multiple high voltage detectors in\nCDMSlite mode.\n", "  We derive the escape velocity profile for an Einasto density field in an\naccelerating universe and demonstrate its physical viability by comparing\ntheoretical expectations to both light-cone data generated from N-body\nsimulations and archival data on 20 galaxy clusters. We demonstrate that the\nprojection function ($g(\\beta )$) is deemed physically viable only for the\ntheoretical expectation that includes a cosmology-dependent term. Using\nsimulations, we show that the inferred velocity anisotropy is more than\n6{\\sigma} away from the expected value for the theoretical profile that ignores\nthe acceleration of the universe. In the archival data, we constrain the\naverage velocity anisotropy parameter of a sample of 20 clusters to be $\\beta\n={0.248}_{-0.360}^{+0.164}$ at the 68% confidence level. Lastly, we briefly\ndiscuss how our analytic model may be used as a novel cosmological probe based\non galaxy clusters.\n", "  State-of-the-art lattice QCD calculations of scattering amplitudes in\ncoupled-channel $D\\pi$, $D\\eta$ and $D_{s}\\bar{K}$ scattering, as well elastic\n$DK$ scattering are discussed. The methodology employed allows a determination\nof the relevant poles in the scattering matrix, while also providing a measure\nof the coupling of each channel to a given pole. By investigating $S$, $P$ and\n$D$ wave interactions, the nature of states with $J^{P} = 0^{+}$, relevant for\nthe $D^{*}_{0}(2400)$ and $D^{*}_{s0}(2317)$, as well as states with $J^{P} =\n1^{-}, 2^{+}$ are discussed.\n", "  Location-based social media make it possible to understand social and\ngeographic aspects of human activities. However, previous studies have mostly\nexamined these two aspects separately without looking at how they are linked.\nThe study aims to connect two aspects by investigating whether there is any\ncorrelation between social connections and users' check-in locations from a\nsocio-geographic perspective. We constructed three types of networks: a\npeople-people network, a location-location network, and a city-city network\nfrom former location-based social media Brightkite and Gowalla in the U.S.,\nbased on users' check-in locations and their friendships. We adopted some\ncomplexity science methods such as power-law detection and head/tail breaks\nclassification method for analysis and visualization. Head/tail breaks\nrecursively partitions data into a few large things in the head and many small\nthings in the tail. By analyzing check-in locations, we found that users'\ncheck-in patterns are heterogeneous at both the individual and collective\nlevels. We also discovered that users' first or most frequent chec-in locations\ncan be the representatives of users' spatial information. The constructed\nnetworks based on these locations are very heterogeneous, as indicated by the\nhigh ht-index. Most importantly, the node degree of the networks correlates\nhighly with the population at locations (mostly with R-square being 0.7) or\ncities (above 0.9). This correlation indicates that the geographic\ndistributions of the social media users relate highly to their online social\nconnections.\n  Keywords: social networks, check-in locations, natural cities, power law,\nhead/tail breaks, ht-index\n", "  In this work we investigate temperature dependence of electronic structure of\nsystem with strong electronic correlations and strong electron-phonon\ninteraction modeling cuprates in the frameworks of the three-band p-d-Holstein\nmodel by a polaronic version of the generalized tight binding (GTB) method.\nWithin this approach the electronic structure is formed by polaronic\nquasiparticles constructed as excitations between initial and final polaronic\nmultielectron states. Temperature effect is taken into account by occupation\nnumbers of local excited polaronic states and variations in the magnitude of\nspin-spin correlation functions and it is manifested in the redistribution of\nthe spectral weight over the Hubbard polaron subbands, and the temperature\ndependent band structure. Temperature increasing leads to broadening of the\nspectral function peak at the top of the valence band, shift of the peak, the\ndecreasing of the peak intensity, the growth of bandwidth and reduction of the\ninsulator energy gap. These effects are in a qualitative agreement to the\ntemperature dependence of the ARPES spectra observed in the undoped HTSC\ncuprates.\n", "  This paper presents a novel numerical optimisation method for infinite\ndimensional optimisation. The functional optimisation makes minimal assumptions\nabout the functional and without any specific knowledge on the derivative of\nthe functional. The algorithm has been tested on several physical systems\n(brachistochrone and catenary problems) and it is shown that the solutions\nobtained are close to the actual solutions in one thousand functional\nevaluations. It is also shown that for the tested cases, the new algorithm\nprovides better convergence to the optimum value compared to the tested\nexisting algorithms.\n", "  We analyze all available RXTE data on a sample of 13 low mass X-ray binaries\nwith known neutron star spin that are not persistent pulsars. We carefully\nmeasure the correlations between the centroid frequencies of the quasi-periodic\noscillations (QPOs). We compare these correlations to the prediction of the\nrelativistic precession model (RPM) that, due to frame dragging, a QPO will\noccur at the Lense-Thirring precession frequency $\\nu_{LT}$ of a test particle\norbit whose orbital frequency is the upper kHz QPO frequency $\\nu_u$. Contrary\nto the most prominent previous studies, we find two different oscillations in\nthe range predicted for $\\nu_{LT}$ that are simultaneously present over a wide\nrange of $\\nu_u$. Additionally, one of the low frequency noise components\nevolves into a (third) QPO in the $\\nu_{LT}$ range when $\\nu_u$ exceeds 600 Hz.\nThe frequencies of these QPOs all correlate to $\\nu_u$ following power laws\nwith indices between 0.4$-$3.3, significantly exceeding the predicted value of\n2.0 in 80$\\%$ of the cases (at 3 to >20$\\sigma$). Also, there is no evidence\nthat the neutron star spin frequency affects any of these three QPO frequencies\nas would be expected for frame dragging. Finally, the observed QPO frequencies\ntend to be higher than the $\\nu_{LT}$ predicted for reasonable neutron star\nspecific moment of inertia. In the light of recent successes of precession\nmodels in black holes, we briefly discuss ways in which such precession can\noccur in neutron stars at frequencies different from test particle values and\nconsistent with those observed. A precessing torus geometry and other torques\nthan frame dragging may allow precession to produce the observed frequency\ncorrelations, but can only explain one of the three QPOs in the $\\nu_{LT}$\nrange.\n", "  We are developing a Wide-Field Imaging Interferometry Testbed (WIIT) in\nsupport of design studies for NASA's future space interferometry missions, in\nparticular the SPIRIT and SPECS far-infrared/submillimeter interferometers.\nWIIT operates at optical wavelengths and uses Michelson beam combination to\nachieve both wide-field imaging and high-resolution spectroscopy. It will be\nused chiefly to test the feasibility of using a large-format detector array at\nthe image plane of the sky to obtain wide-field interferometry images through\nmosaicing techniques. In this setup each detector pixel records interferograms\ncorresponding to averaging a particular pointing range on the sky as the\noptical path length is scanned and as the baseline separation and orientation\nis varied. The final image is constructed through spatial and spectral Fourier\ntransforms of the recorded interferograms for each pixel, followed by a\nmosaic/joint-deconvolution procedure of all the pixels. In this manner the\nimage within the pointing range of each detector pixel is further resolved to\nan angular resolution corresponding to the maximum baseline separation for\nfringe measurements.\n  We present the motivation for building the testbed, show the optical,\nmechanical, control, and data system design, and describe the image processing\nrequirements and algorithms. WIIT is presently under construction at NASA's\nGoddard Space Flight Center.\n", "  A novel inversion technique is proposed to compute parametric maps showing\nthe temperature, density and chemical composition of cosmic hot gas from X-ray\nhyper-spectral images. The parameters are recovered by constructing a unique\nnon-linear mapping derived by combining a physics-based modelling of the X-ray\nspectrum with the selection of optimal bandpass filters. Preliminary results\nand analysis are presented.\n", "  We review some of the recent developments and challenges posed by the data\nanalysis in modern digital sky surveys, which are representative of the\ninformation-rich astronomy in the context of Virtual Observatory. Illustrative\nexamples include the problems of an automated star-galaxy classification in\ncomplex and heterogeneous panoramic imaging data sets, and an automated,\niterative, dynamical classification of transient events detected in synoptic\nsky surveys. These problems offer good opportunities for productive\ncollaborations between astronomers and applied computer scientists and\nstatisticians, and are representative of the kind of challenges now present in\nall data-intensive fields. We discuss briefly some emergent types of scalable\nscientific data analysis systems with a broad applicability.\n", "  In this paper, a review on dielectric mixtures and the importance of the\nnumerical simulations of dielectric mixtures are presented. It stresses on the\ninterfacial polarization observed in mixtures. It is shown that this\npolarization can yield different dielectric responses depending on the\nproperties of the constituents and their concentrations. Open question on the\nsubject are also introduced.\n", "  This work presents new experimental results on low-temperature (LT)\ncharacterization of local rf properties of passive superconducting (SC)\nmicrowave devices using a novel Laser Scanning Microscope (LSM). In this\ntechnique, a modulated laser beam is focused onto and scanned over the surface\nof a resonant SC device to probe the spatial distribution of rf current. The\nhighly localized photo-induced change of the kinetic inductance of the SC\ndevice produces both a shift of the resonant frequency f_0 and change of the\nquality factor Q. An image of these changes is recorded as the laser spot is\nscanned over the device. We present the first measurements of spatially\nresolved intermodulation response in a High Temperature Superconducting (HTS)\nco-planar waveguide resonator, opening up a new window into the local origins\nof nonlinearity in the HTS materials.\n", "  We present experimental results on the behaviour of a superconducting YBCO/Au\nmeander of length L submitted to short circuit tests with constant voltage\npulses. The meander, at the beginning of the short-circuit, is divided in two\nregions; one, with a length L1 proportional to the applied voltage, which first\nswitches into a highly dissipative state (HDS) while the rest remains\nsuperconducting. Then the rest of the meander will progressively switch into\nthe normal state due to the propagation of this HDS (few m/s) from both ends.\nThe part L1 has to initially support a power density proportional to r.Jp^2 (r\nis the resistivity of the bilayer and Jp the peak current density). To avoid\nlocal excessive dissipation of power and over heating on one part of the wafer\nin the initial period, we have developed a novel design in order to distribute\nthe dissipating section of the meander into many separated small dissipative\nzones. Furthermore the apparent propagation velocity of these dissipative zones\nis increased by the number of propagation fronts. We will show results obtained\non 3kW (300V, 10A) FCL on a 2\" wafer which confirm the benefits of this new\ndesign.\n", "  Using a sample with a split back-gate, a linear frequency dependence of the\nac quantum Hall resistance was observed. The frequency coefficient, which is\ndue to dielectric losses produced by leakage current between the 2DEG and the\nback-gates, can be turned from a positive to a negative values by increasing\nthe back-gate voltage. More interestingly, by removing theses back-gates, the\nlosses can be considerably reduced leading to a residual frequency coefficient\non the order of (0.03+-0.03) ppm/kHz. Moreover, at 1 kHz, an extremely flat\nplateau was observed over a magnetic field range of 1.4 T. These results\nclearly indicate that the audio frequency dependence of the QHR is to a large\nextend related to the measurement apparatus and does not originate from the\nphysical transport properties of the 2DEG.\n", "  In this communication, we report on the anisotropy of the superconducting\nproperties of multifilamentary Bi-based tapes experimentally investigated by AC\nmagnetic susceptibility measurements. The susceptibility $\\chi= \\chi' - j\n\\chi''$ was measured using a commercial system and a couple of orthogonal\npick-up coils. The $\\chi''$ vs. temperature curves were shown to exhibit two\npeaks. The smaller of the peaks, occurring near T = 72K, was only visible for\nparticular field directions and within a given frequency window. Such results\npoint out the role played by the phase difference between the applied magnetic\nfield and the internal magnetic field seen by the filaments.\n", "  The uniqueness theorem for Tsallis entropy was presented in {\\it H.Suyari,\nIEEE Trans. Inform. Theory, Vol.50, pp.1783-1787 (2004)} by introducing the\ngeneralized Shannon-Khinchin's axiom. In the present paper, this result is\ngeneralized and simplified as follows: {\\it Generalization}: The uniqueness\ntheorem for Tsallis relative entropy is shown by means of the generalized\nHobson's axiom. {\\it Simplification}: The uniqueness theorem for Tsallis\nentropy is shown by means of the generalized Faddeev's axiom.\n", "  We present fabrication and characterization procedures of devices for circuit\nquantum electrodynamics (cQED). We have made 3 GHz cavities with quality\nfactors in the range 10^4--10^6, which allow access to the strong coupling\nregime of cQED. The cavities are transmission line resonators made by\nphotolithography. They are coupled to the input and output ports via gap\ncapacitors. An Al-based Cooper pair box is made by ebeam lithography and Dolan\nbridge double-angle evaporation in superconducting resonators with high quality\nfactor. An important issue is to characterize the quality factor of the\nresonators. We present an RF-characterization of superconducting resonators as\na function of temperature and magnetic field. We have realized different\nversions of the system with different box-cavity couplings by using different\ndielectrics and by changing the box geometry. Moreover, the cQED approach can\nbe used as a diagnostic tool of qubit internal losses.\n", "  We have implemented a resonant circuit that uses a SQUID as a flux-sensitive\nJosephson inductor for qubit readout. In contrast to the conventional switching\ncurrent measurement that generates undesired quasi-particles when the SQUID\nswitches to the voltage state, our approach keeps the readout SQUID biased\nalong the supercurrent branch during the measurement. By incorporating the\nSQUID inductor in a high-Q resonant circuit, we can distinguish the two flux\nstates of a niobium persistent-current (PC) qubit by observing a shift in the\nresonant frequency of both the magnitude and the phase spectra. The readout\ncircuit was also characterized in the nonlinear regime to investigate its\npotential use as a nonlinear amplifier.\n", "  We investigated the effect of continuous-wave (cw) UV laser radiation on\nsingle-mode Ge-doped H2- loaded optical fibers. An innovative technique was\ndeveloped to measure the optical absorption (OA) induced in the samples by\nirradiation, and to study its dependence from laser fluence. The combined use\nof the electron spin resonance (ESR) technique allowed the structural\nidentification of several radiation-induced point defects, among which the\nGe(1) (GeO4 -) is found to be responsible of induced OA in the investigated\nspectral region.\n", "  The paper is concerned with the interplay between network structure and\ntraffic dynamics in a communications network, from the viewpoint of end-to-end\nperformance of packet transfer. We use a model of network generation that\nallows the transition from random to scale-free networks. Specifically, we are\nable to consider three different topologycal types of networks: (a) random; (b)\nscale-free with \\gamma=3; (c) scale free with \\gamma=2. We also use an LRD\ntraffic generator in order to reproduce the fractal behavior that is observed\nin real world data communication. The issue is addressed of how the traffic\nbehavior on the network is influenced by the variable factors of the\ntransmission rates and queue length restrictions at the network vertices. We\nshow that these factors can induce drastic changes in the throughput and\ndelivery time of network performance and are able to counter-balance some\nundesirable effects due to the topology.\n", "  We have developed a scanning near-field microwave microscope that operates at\ncryogenic temperatures. Our system uses an open-ended coaxial probe with a 200\nmm inner conductor diameter and operates from 77 to 300 K in the 0.01-20 GHz\nfrequency range. In this paper, we present microwave images of the electric\nfield distribution above a Tl2Ba2CaCu2O8 microstrip resonator at 77 K, measured\nat several heights. In addition, we describe the use of a frequency-following\ncircuit to study the influence of the probe on the resonant frequency of the\ndevice.\n", "  We have developed scanning near-field microwave microscopes which can image\nelectrodynamic properties of superconducting materials on length scales down to\nabout 2 $\\mu$m. The microscopes are capable of quantitative imaging of sheet\nresistance of thin films, and surface topography. We demonstrate the utility of\nthe microscopes through images of the sheet resistance of a YBa2Cu3O7-d thin\nfilm wafer, images of bulk Nb surfaces, and spatially resolved measurements of\nTc of a YBa2Cu3O7-d thin film. We also discuss some of the limitations of the\nmicroscope and conclude with a summary of its present capabilities.\n", "  A new method for analyzing low density parity check (LDPC) codes and low\ndensity generator matrix (LDGM) codes under bit maximum a posteriori\nprobability (MAP) decoding is introduced. The method is based on a rigorous\napproach to spin glasses developed by Francesco Guerra. It allows to construct\nlower bounds on the entropy of the transmitted message conditional to the\nreceived one. Based on heuristic statistical mechanics calculations, we\nconjecture such bounds to be tight. The result holds for standard irregular\nensembles when used over binary input output symmetric channels. The method is\nfirst developed for Tanner graph ensembles with Poisson left degree\ndistribution. It is then generalized to `multi-Poisson' graphs, and, by a\ncompletion procedure, to arbitrary degree distribution.\n", "  This paper analyzes the information content of medical images, with 3-D MRI\nimages as an example, in terms of information entropy. The results of the\nanalysis justify the use of Pixel Difference Coding for preserving all\ninformation contained in the original pictures, lossless coding in other words.\nThe experimental results also indicate that the compression ratio CR=2:1 can be\nachieved under the lossless constraints. A pratical implementation of Pixel\nDifference Coding which allows interactive retrieval of local ROI (Region of\nInterest), while maintaining the near low bound information entropy, is\ndiscussed.\n", "  Measurements and design equations for a two section impedance transforming\nhybrid suitable for MMIC applications and a new method of synthesis for\nmultisection branch-line hybrids are reported. The synthesis method allows the\nresponse to be specified either of Butterworth or Chebyshev type. Both\nsymmetric (with equal input and output impedances) and non-symmetric (impedance\ntransforming) designs are feasible. Starting from a given number of sections,\ntype of response, and impedance transformation ratio and for a specified\nmidband coupling, power division ratio, isolation or directivity ripple\nbandwidth, the set of constants needed for the evaluation of the reflection\ncoefficient response is first calculated. The latter is used to define a\ndriving point impedance of the circuit, synthesize it and obtain the branch\nline immittances with the use of the concept of double length unit elements\n(DLUE). The experimental results obtained with microstrip hybrids constructed\nto test the validity of the brute force optimization and the synthesized\ndesigns show very close agreement with the computed responses.\n", "  The superconducting ac generator has the greatest potential for large-scale\ncommercial application of superconductivity that can benefit the public.\nElectric power is a vital ingredient of modern society, and generation may be\nconsidered to be the vital ingredient of a power system. This articles gives\nbackground, and an insight into the physics and engineering of superconducting\npower generation.\n", "  In electrically substituted radiometers, the ultra low noise control of the\ntemperature is required. In this framework, we present results dedicated to the\ntemperature regulation of copper plates, 3 cm diameter and 1 mm thick, using\nYBa2Cu3O7-d (YBCO) transition edge sensors (TES). One of the TES was used as\nthe active thermometer of the temperature control unit, whereas the two others\nmeasured the plate temperature behavior. Two heating resistors were wound along\na spiral pattern, just underneath the copper plate, to minimize the heating\ndelay. The correlation between the two TES was clearly highlighted by applying\na small heat perturbation through the second distributed resistor, the path of\nwhich closely follows that of the main resistor. Calibrated temperature\noscillations of 30 microK rms at 10mHz together with spectral analysis were\nmeasured and a temperature resolution in the range of a few microK rms was\nachieved.\n", "  Few examples of the exploitation of molecular magnetic properties in\nmolecular electronics are known to date. Here we propose the realization of\nSelf assembled monolayers (SAM) of a particular stable organic radical. This\nradical is meant to be used as a standard molecule on which to prove the\nvalidity of a single spin reading procedure known as ESR-STM. We also discuss a\nrange of possible applications, further than ESR-STM, of magnetic monolayers of\nsimple purely organic magnetic molecule.\n", "  Thin gap chambers (TGCs) are used for the muon trigger system in the forward\nregion of the LHC experiment ATLAS. The TGCs are expected to provide a trigger\nsignal within 25 ns of the bunch spacing. An extensive system test of the ATLAS\nmuon spectrometer has been performed in the H8 beam line at the CERN SPS during\nthe last few years. A relational database was used for storing the conditions\nof the tests as well as the configuration of the system. This database has\nprovided the detector control system with the information needed for\nconfiguration of the front end electronics. The database is used to assist the\nonline operation and maintenance. The same database is used to store the non\nevent condition and configuration parameters needed later for the offline\nreconstruction software. A larger scale of the database has been produced to\nsupport the whole TGC system. It integrates all the production, QA tests and\nassembly information. A 1/12th model of the whole TGC system is currently in\nuse for testing the performance of this database in configuring and tracking\nthe condition of the system. A prototype of the database was first implemented\nduring the H8 test beams. This paper describes the database structure, its\ninterface to other systems and its operational performance.\n", "  Hyperspectroscopy is a new method of surface image taking, providing\nsimultaneously high position and spectral resolutions which allow one to make\nsome conclusions about chemical compositions of the surfaces. We are now\nstudying applications of the hyperspctroscopic technique to be used for\nmedicine. This may allow one to develop early diagnostics of some illnesses, as\nfor example, skin cancer. For image taking advanced MCPs are currently used,\nsensitive in the spectral interval of 450-850 nm. One of the aims of this work\nis to extend the hyperspectrocpic method to the UV region of spectra: 185-280\nnm. For this we have developed and successfully tested innovative 1D and 2D UV\nsealed photosensitive gaseous detectors with resistive electrodes. These\ndetectors are superior MCPs due to the very low rate of noise pulses and thus\ndue to the high signal to noise ratio. Other important features of these\ndetectors are that they have excellent position resolutions - 30 micron in\ndigital form, are vibration stable and are spark protected. The first results\nfrom the application of these detectors for spectroscopy, hyperspectroscopy and\nthe flame detection are presented.\n", "  Cryogenic Sapphire Oscillators (CSO) developed at UWA have now been in\noperation around the world continuously for many years. Such oscillators, due\nto their excellent spectral purity are essential for interrogating atomic\nfrequency standards at the limit of quantum projection noise; otherwise\naliasing effects will dominate the frequency stability due to the periodic\nsampling between successive interrogations of the atomic transition. For this\nreason, UWA oscillators are now operational at NMI (Sydney), LNE-SYRTE (Paris),\nthe French Space Agency (CNES, Toulouse) and at UWA (Perth). Other\napplications, which have attracted attention in recent years, include tests on\nfundamental principles of physics, such as tests of Lorentz invariance. This\npaper reports on the long-term operation and performance of such oscillators.\nWe compare the long-term drift of some different CSOs. The drift rates turn out\nto be linear over many years and in the same direction. However, the magnitude\nseems to vary by more than one order of magnitude between the oscillators,\nranging from 10^14 per day to a few parts in 10^13 per day.\n", "  A computer-aided detection (CADe) system for microcalcification cluster\nidentification in mammograms has been developed in the framework of the\nEU-founded MammoGrid project. The CADe software is mainly based on wavelet\ntransforms and artificial neural networks. It is able to identify\nmicrocalcifications in different datasets of mammograms (i.e. acquired with\ndifferent machines and settings, digitized with different pitch and bit depth\nor direct digital ones). The CADe can be remotely run from GRID-connected\nacquisition and annotation stations, supporting clinicians from geographically\ndistant locations in the interpretation of mammographic data. We report and\ndiscuss the system performances on different datasets of mammograms and the\nstatus of the GRID-enabled CADe analysis.\n", "  Amongst the most remarkable successes of quantum computation are Shor's\nefficient quantum algorithms for the computational tasks of integer\nfactorisation and the evaluation of discrete logarithms. In this article we\nreview the essential ingredients of these algorithms and draw out the unifying\ngeneralization of the so-called abelian hidden subgroup problem. This involves\nan unexpectedly harmonious alignment of the formalism of quantum physics with\nthe elegant mathematical theory of group representations and fourier transforms\non finite groups. Finally we consider the non-abelian hidden subgroup problem\nmentioning some open questions where future quantum algorithms may be expected\nto have a substantial impact.\n", "  We expand on our work on Quantum Data Hiding -- hiding classical data among\nparties who are restricted to performing only local quantum operations and\nclassical communication (LOCC). We review our scheme that hides one bit between\ntwo parties using Bell states, and we derive upper and lower bounds on the\nsecrecy of the hiding scheme. We provide an explicit bound showing that\nmultiple bits can be hidden bitwise with our scheme. We give a preparation of\nthe hiding states as an efficient quantum computation that uses at most one\nebit of entanglement. A candidate data hiding scheme that does not use\nentanglement is presented. We show how our scheme for quantum data hiding can\nbe used in a conditionally secure quantum bit commitment scheme.\n", "  Recent progress in quantum physics has made it possible to perform\nexperiments in which individual quantum systems are monitored and manipulated\nin real time. The advent of such new technical capabilities provides strong\nmotivation for the development of theoretical and experimental methodologies\nfor quantum feedback control. The availability of such methods would enable\nradically new approaches to experimental physics in the quantum realm.\nLikewise, the investigation of quantum feedback control will introduce crucial\nnew considerations to control theory, such as the uniquely quantum phenomena of\nentanglement and measurement back-action. The extension of established analysis\ntechniques from control theory into the quantum domain may also provide new\ninsight into the dynamics of complex quantum systems. We anticipate that the\nsuccessful formulation of an input-output approach to the analysis and\nreduction of large quantum systems could have very general applications in\nnon-equilibrium quantum statistical mechanics and in the nascent field of\nquantum information theory.\n", "  Tradeoffs between the information rate and fidelity of quantum\nerror-correcting codes are discussed. Quantum channels to be considered are\nthose subject to independent errors and modeled as tensor products of copies of\na general completely positive linear map, where the dimension of the underlying\nHilbert space is a prime number. On such a quantum channel, the highest\nfidelity of a quantum error-correcting code of length $n$ and rate R is proven\nto be lower bounded by 1 - \\exp [-n E(R) + o(n)] for some function E(R). The\nE(R) is positive below some threshold R', which implies R' is a lower bound on\nthe quantum capacity. The result of this work applies to general discrete\nmemoryless channels, including channel models derived from a physical law of\ntime evolution, or from master equations.\n", "  Authentication is a well-studied area of classical cryptography: a sender S\nand a receiver R sharing a classical private key want to exchange a classical\nmessage with the guarantee that the message has not been modified by any third\nparty with control of the communication line. In this paper we define and\ninvestigate the authentication of messages composed of quantum states. Assuming\nS and R have access to an insecure quantum channel and share a private,\nclassical random key, we provide a non-interactive scheme that enables S both\nto encrypt and to authenticate (with unconditional security) an m qubit message\nby encoding it into m+s qubits, where the failure probability decreases\nexponentially in the security parameter s. The classical private key is 2m+O(s)\nbits. To achieve this, we give a highly efficient protocol for testing the\npurity of shared EPR pairs. We also show that any scheme to authenticate\nquantum messages must also encrypt them. (In contrast, one can authenticate a\nclassical message while leaving it publicly readable.) This has two important\nconsequences: On one hand, it allows us to give a lower bound of 2m key bits\nfor authenticating m qubits, which makes our protocol asymptotically optimal.\nOn the other hand, we use it to show that digitally signing quantum states is\nimpossible, even with only computational security.\n", "  Future wired and wireless communication systems will employ pure or combined\nCode Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technique, such as in the European 3G\nmobile UMTS or Power Line Telecommunication system, but also several 4G\nproposal includes e.g. multi carrier (MC) CDMA. Former examinations carried out\nthe drawbacks of single user detectors (SUD), which are widely employed in\nnarrowband IS-95 CDMA systems, and forced to develop suitable multiuser\ndetection schemes to increase the efficiency against interference. However, at\nthis moment there are only suboptimal solutions available because of the rather\nhigh complexity of optimal detectors. One of the possible receiver technologies\ncan be the quantum assisted computing devices which allows high level\nparallelism in computation. The first commercial devices are estimated for the\nnext years, which meets the advert of 3G and 4G systems. In this paper we\nanalyze the error probability and give tight bounds in a static and dynamically\nchanging environment for a novel quantum computation based Quantum Multiuser\ndetection (QMUD) algorithm, employing quantum counting algorithm, which\nprovides optimal solution.\n", "  We consider the problem of designing an optimal quantum detector to minimize\nthe probability of a detection error when distinguishing between a collection\nof quantum states, represented by a set of density operators. We show that the\ndesign of the optimal detector can be formulated as a semidefinite programming\nproblem. Based on this formulation, we derive a set of necessary and sufficient\nconditions for an optimal quantum measurement. We then show that the optimal\nmeasurement can be found by solving a standard (convex) semidefinite program\nfollowed by the solution of a set of linear equations or, at worst, a standard\nlinear programming problem. By exploiting the many well-known algorithms for\nsolving semidefinite programs, which are guaranteed to converge to the global\noptimum, the optimal measurement can be computed very efficiently in polynomial\ntime.\n  Using the semidefinite programming formulation, we also show that the rank of\neach optimal measurement operator is no larger than the rank of the\ncorresponding density operator. In particular, if the quantum state ensemble is\na pure-state ensemble consisting of (not necessarily independent) rank-one\ndensity operators, then we show that the optimal measurement is a pure-state\nmeasurement consisting of rank-one measurement operators.\n", "  An ideal controlled-NOT gate followed by projective measurements can be used\nto identify specific Bell states of its two input qubits. When the input qubits\nare each members of independent Bell states, these projective measurements can\nbe used to swap the post-selected entanglement onto the remaining two qubits.\nHere we apply this strategy to produce heralded two-photon polarization\nentanglement using Bell states that originate from independent parametric\ndown-conversion sources, and a particular probabilistic controlled-NOT gate\nthat is constructed from linear optical elements. The resulting implementation\nis closely related to an earlier proposal by Sliwa and Banaszek\n[quant-ph/0207117], and can be intuitively understood in terms of familiar\nquantum information protocols. The possibility of producing a ``pseudo-demand''\nsource of two-photon entanglement by storing and releasing these heralded pairs\nfrom independent cyclical quantum memory devices is also discussed.\n", "  We introduce a ``Statistical Query Sampling'' model, in which the goal of an\nalgorithm is to produce an element in a hidden set $Ssubseteqbit^n$ with\nreasonable probability. The algorithm gains information about $S$ through\noracle calls (statistical queries), where the algorithm submits a query\nfunction $g(cdot)$ and receives an approximation to $Pr_{x in S}[g(x)=1]$. We\nshow how this model is related to NMR quantum computing, in which only\nstatistical properties of an ensemble of quantum systems can be measured, and\nin particular to the question of whether one can translate standard quantum\nalgorithms to the NMR setting without putting all of their classical\npost-processing into the quantum system. Using Fourier analysis techniques\ndeveloped in the related context of {em statistical query learning}, we prove a\nnumber of lower bounds (both information-theoretic and cryptographic) on the\nability of algorithms to produces an $xin S$, even when the set $S$ is fairly\nsimple. These lower bounds point out a difficulty in efficiently applying NMR\nquantum computing to algorithms such as Shor's and Simon's algorithm that\ninvolve significant classical post-processing. We also explicitly relate the\nnotion of statistical query sampling to that of statistical query learning.\n  An extended abstract appeared in the 18th Aunnual IEEE Conference of\nComputational Complexity (CCC 2003), 2003.\n  Keywords: statistical query, NMR quantum computing, lower bound\n", "  The problem of open-loop dynamical control of generic open quantum systems is\naddressed. In particular, I focus on the task of effectively switching off\nenvironmental couplings responsible for unwanted decoherence and dissipation\neffects. After revisiting the standard framework for dynamical decoupling via\ndeterministic controls, I describe a different approach whereby the controller\nintentionally acquires a random component. An explicit error bound on\nworst-case performance of stochastic decoupling is presented.\n", "  We show that oblivious transfer can be seen as the classical analogue to a\nquantum channel in the same sense as non-local boxes are for maximally\nentangled qubits.\n", "  Quantum cryptography is the only approach to privacy ever proposed that\nallows two parties (who do not share a long secret key ahead of time) to\ncommunicate with provably perfect secrecy under the nose of an eavesdropper\nendowed with unlimited computational power and whose technology is limited by\nnothing but the fundamental laws of nature. This essay provides a personal\nhistorical perspective on the field. For the sake of liveliness, the style is\npurposely that of a spontaneous after-dinner speech.\n", "  We show that there exists a universal quantum Turing machine (UQTM) that can\nsimulate every other QTM until the other QTM has halted and then halt itself\nwith probability one. This extends work by Bernstein and Vazirani who have\nshown that there is a UQTM that can simulate every other QTM for an arbitrary,\nbut preassigned number of time steps. As a corollary to this result, we give a\nrigorous proof that quantum Kolmogorov complexity as defined by Berthiaume et\nal. is invariant, i.e. depends on the choice of the UQTM only up to an additive\nconstant. Our proof is based on a new mathematical framework for QTMs,\nincluding a thorough analysis of their halting behaviour. We introduce the\nnotion of mutually orthogonal halting spaces and show that the information\nencoded in an input qubit string can always be effectively decomposed into a\nclassical and a quantum part.\n", "  We propose two experimental schemes to implement arbitrary unitary single\nqubit operations on single photons encoded in time-bin qubits. Both schemes\nrequire fiber optics components that are available with current technology.\n", "  Quantum phenomena of interest in connection with applications to computation\nand communication almost always involve generating specific transfers between\neigenstates, and their linear superpositions. For some quantum systems, such as\nspin systems, the quantum evolution equation (the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation) is\nfinite-dimensional and old results on controllability of systems defined on on\nLie groups and quotient spaces provide most of what is needed insofar as\ncontrollability of non-dissipative systems is concerned. However, in an\ninfinite-dimensional setting, controlling the evolution of quantum systems\noften presents difficulties, both conceptual and technical. In this paper we\npresent a systematic approach to a class of such problems for which it is\npossible to avoid some of the technical issues. In particular, we analyze\ncontrollability for infinite-dimensional bilinear systems under assumptions\nthat make controllability possible using trajectories lying in a nested family\nof pre-defined subspaces. This result, which we call the Finite Controllability\nTheorem, provides a set of sufficient conditions for controllability in an\ninfinite-dimensional setting. We consider specific physical systems that are of\ninterest for quantum computing, and provide insights into the types of quantum\noperations (gates) that may be developed.\n", "  We prove unconditional security for a quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol\nbased on distilling pbits (twisted ebits) [quant-ph/0309110] from an arbitrary\nuntrusted state that is claimed to contain distillable key. Our main result is\nthat we can verify security using only public communication -- via parameter\nestimation of the given untrusted state. The technique applies even to bound\nentangled states, thus extending QKD to the regime where the available quantum\nchannel has zero quantum capacity. We also show how to convert our\npurification-based QKD schemes to prepare-measure schemes.\n", "  We consider ergodic causal classical-quantum channels (cq-channels) which\nadditionally have a decaying input memory. In the first part we develop some\nstructural properties of ergodic cq-channels and provide equivalent conditions\nfor ergodicity. In the second part we prove the coding theorem with weak\nconverse for causal ergodic cq-channels with decaying input memory. Our proof\nis based on the possibility to introduce joint input-output state for the\ncq-channels and an application of the Shannon-McMillan theorem for ergodic\nquantum states. In the last part of the paper it is shown how this result\nimplies coding theorem for the classical capacity of a class of causal ergodic\nquantum channels.\n", "  In this paper, a construction of a pair of \"regular\" quasi-cyclic LDPC codes\nas ingredient codes for a quantum error-correcting code is proposed. That is,\nwe find quantum regular LDPC codes with various weight distributions.\nFurthermore our proposed codes have lots of variations for length, code rate.\nThese codes are obtained by a descrete mathematical characterization for model\nmatrices of quasi-cyclic LDPC codes.\n  Our proposed codes achieve a bounded distance decoding (BDD) bound, or known\nas VG bound, and achieve a lower bound of the code length.\n", "  We show the equivalence of two different notions of quantum channel capacity:\nthat which uses the entanglement fidelity as its criterion of success in\ntransmission, and that which uses the minimum fidelity of pure states in a\nsubspace of the input Hilbert space as its criterion. As a corollary, any\nsource with entropy rate less than the capacity may be transmitted with high\nentanglement fidelity. We also show that a restricted class of encodings is\nsufficient to transmit any quantum source which may be transmitted on a given\nchannel. This enables us to simplify a known upper bound for the channel\ncapacity. It also enables us to show that the availability of an auxiliary\nclassical channel from encoder to decoder does not increase the quantum\ncapacity.\n", "  The hypothesis testing problem of two quantum states is treated. We show a\nnew inequality between the error of the first kind and the second kind, which\ncomplements the result of Hiai and Petz to establish the quantum version of\nStein's lemma. The inequality is also used to show a bound on the first kind\nerror when the power exponent for the second kind error exceeds the quantum\nrelative entropy, and the bound yields the strong converse in the quantum\nhypothesis testing. Finally, we discuss the relation between the bound and the\npower exponent derived by Han and Kobayashi in the classical hypothesis\ntesting.\n", "  The non-linear microwave surface impedance of patterned YBCO thin films, was\nmeasured using a suspended line resonator in the presence of a perpendicular DC\nmagnetic field of magnitude comparable to that of the microwave field.\nSignature of the virgin state was found to be absent even for relatively low\nmicrowave power levels. The microwave loss was initially found to decrease for\nsmall applied DC field before increasing again. Also, non-linearities inherent\nin the sample were found to be substantially suppressed at low powers at these\napplied fields. These two features together can lead to significant improvement\nin device performance.\n"]}
