Krylov-Bogoliubov-Mitropolsky averaging in the canonical\nformulation can be used as a method for constructing effective Hamiltonians in\nthe theory of strongly correlated electron systems. As an example, we consider\nthe transition from the Hamiltonians of the Hubbard and Anderson models to the\nrespective Hamiltonians of the t-J and Kondo models. This is a very general\nmethod, has several advantages over other methods, and can be used to solve a\nwide range of problems in the physics of correlated systems.\n", "  We consider newtonian dynamics of $N$ charged particles on the circle with\nnearest neigbour interaction with Coulomb repulsive potential $r^{-1}$ . Also\nthere is an external accelerating force which is nonzero only on a small part\nof the circle. We construct homogeneous solutions where the velocities of all\nparticles are approximately equal and their density is approximately uniform.\nThis gives a qualitative mathematical model for some features of the direct\nelectric current (DC), in agreement with a suggestion by R. Feynman.\n", "  We analyse statistics of the real eigenvalues of gl(N,R)-valued Brownian\nmotion (the 'Ginibre evolution') in the limit of large $N$. In particular, we\ncalculate the limiting two-time correlation function of spin variables\nassociated with real eigenvalues of the Ginibre evolution. We also show how the\nformalism of spin variables can be used to compute the fixed time correlation\nfunctions of real eigenvalues discovered originally by Forrester and Nagao and\nBorodin and Sinclair.\n", "  We study a DeGroot-like opinion dynamics model in which agents may oppose\nother agents. As an underlying motivation, in our setup, agents want to adjust\ntheir opinions to match those of the agents of their 'in-group' and, in\naddition, they want to adjust their opinions to match the 'inverse' of those of\nthe agents of their 'out-group'. Our paradigm can account for persistent\ndisagreement in connected societies as well as bi- and multi-polarization.\nOutcomes depend upon network structure and the choice of deviation function\nmodeling the mode of opposition between agents. For a particular choice of\ndeviation function, which we call soft opposition, we derive necessary and\nsufficient conditions for long-run polarization. We also consider social\ninfluence (who are the opinion leaders in the network?) as well as the question\nof wisdom in our naive learning paradigm, finding that wisdom is difficult to\nattain when there exist sufficiently strong negative relations between agents.\n", "  Feynman diagrams are a pictorial way of describing integrals predicting\npossible outcomes of interactions of subatomic particles in the context of\nquantum field physics. It is highly desirable to have an intrinsic mathematical\ninterpretation of Feynman diagrams, and in this article we find the\nrepresentation-theoretic meaning of a particular kind of Feynman diagrams\ncalled the two-loop ladder diagram. This is done in the context of\nrepresentations of a Lie group U(2,2), its Lie algebra u(2,2) and quaternionic\nanalysis. The results and techniques developed in this article are used in [L]\nto provide a mathematical interpretation of all conformal four-point integrals\n- including those described by the n-loop ladder diagrams - in the context of\nrepresentations U(2,2) and quaternionic analysis. Moreover, this\nrepresentation-quaternionic model produces a proof of \"magic identities\" in the\nMinkowski metric space.\n  No prior knowledge of physics or Feynman diagrams is assumed from the reader.\nWe provide a summary of all relevant results from quaternionic analysis to make\nthe article self-contained.\n", "  We propose a conceptually new method for solving nonlinear inverse scattering\nproblems (ISPs) such as are commonly encountered in tomographic ultrasound\nimaging, seismology and other applications. The method is inspired by the\ntheory of nonlocality of physical interactions and utilizes the relevant\nformalism. We formulate the ISP as a problem whose goal is to determine an\nunknown interaction potential $V$ from external scattering data. Although we\nseek a local (diagonally-dominated) $V$ as the solution to the posed problem,\nwe allow $V$ to be nonlocal at the intermediate stages of iterations. This\nallows us to utilize the one-to-one correspondence between $V$ and the T-matrix\nof the problem, $T$. Here it is important to realize that not every $T$\ncorresponds to a diagonal $V$ and we, therefore, relax the usual condition of\nstrict diagonality (locality) of $V$. An iterative algorithm is proposed in\nwhich we seek $T$ that is (i) compatible with the measured scattering data and\n(ii) corresponds to an interaction potential $V$ that is as\ndiagonally-dominated as possible. We refer to this algorithm as to the\ndata-compatible T-matrix completion (DCTMC). This paper is Part I in a two-part\nseries and contains theory only. Numerical examples of image reconstruction in\na strongly nonlinear regime are given in Part II. The method described in this\npaper is particularly well suited for very large data sets that become\nincreasingly available with the use of modern measurement techniques and\ninstrumentation.\n", "  Randomness is a vital resource for modern day information processing,\nespecially for cryptography. A wide range of applications critically rely on\nabundant, high quality random numbers generated securely. Here we show how to\nexpand a random seed at an exponential rate without trusting the underlying\nquantum devices. Our approach is secure against the most general adversaries,\nand has the following new features: cryptographic level of security, tolerating\na constant level of imprecision in the devices, requiring only a unit size\nquantum memory per device component for the honest implementation, and allowing\na large natural class of constructions for the protocol. In conjunct with a\nrecent work by Chung, Shi and Wu, it also leads to robust unbounded expansion\nusing just 2 multi-part devices. When adapted for distributing cryptographic\nkeys, our method achieves, for the first time, exponential expansion combined\nwith cryptographic security and noise tolerance. The proof proceeds by showing\nthat the Renyi divergence of the outputs of the protocol (for a specific\nbounding operator) decreases linearly as the protocol iterates. At the heart of\nthe proof are a new uncertainty principle on quantum measurements, and a method\nfor simulating trusted measurements with untrusted devices.\n", "  Aims. Following the recent detection of 36ArH+ in the Crab nebula spectrum,\nwe have computed the photodissociation rate of ArH+ in order to constrain the\nphysical processes at work in this environment. Methods. Photodissociation\ncross sections of ArH+ are computed in an ab initio approach including explicit\naccount of spin-orbit coupling. Results. We report the photodissociation cross\nsection of ArH+ as a function of wavelength. Photodissociation probabilities\nare derived for different impinging radiation fields.The photodissociation\nprobability of for a very small unshielded cloud surrounded on all sides by the\nunshielded InterStellar Radiation Field (ISRF) model described by Draine (1978)\nis equal to 9.9e-12 s-1 and 1.9e-9 s-1 in the Crab nebula conditions. The\ndependence on the visual extinction is obtained by using the Meudon Photon\nDominated Region (PDR) code and corresponding analytical fits are provided.\nConclusions. These data will help to produce a realistic chemical network to\ninterpret the observations. Photodissociation of ArH+ is found to be moderate\nand the presence of this molecular ion is mainly dependent on the molecular\nfraction\n", "  We present a study of the structure of the Galactic interstellar medium\nthrough the Delta-variance technique, related to the power spectrum and the\nfractal properties of infrared/sub-mm maps. Through this method, it is possible\nto provide quantitative parameters which are useful to characterize different\nmorphological and physical conditions, and to better constrain the theoretical\nmodels. In this respect, the Herschel Infrared Galactic Plane Survey carried\nout at five photometric bands from 70 to 500 \\mu m constitutes an unique\ndatabase for applying statistical tools to a variety of regions across the\nMilky Way. In this paper, we derive a robust estimate of the power-law portion\nof the power spectrum of four contiguous 2{\\deg}x2{\\deg} Hi-GAL tiles located\nin the third Galactic quadrant (217{\\deg} < l < 225{\\deg}, -2{\\deg} < b <\n0{\\deg}). The low level of confusion along the line of sight testified by CO\nobservations makes this region an ideal case. We find very different values of\nthe power spectrum slope from tile to tile but also from wavelength to\nwavelength (2 < \\beta < 3), with similarities between fields attributable to\ncomponents located at the same distance. Thanks to the comparison with models\nof turbulence, an explanation of the determined slopes in terms of the fractal\ngeometry is also provided, and possible relations with the underlying physics\nare investigated. In particular, an anti-correlation between ISM fractal\ndimension and star formation efficiency is found for the two main distance\ncomponents observed in these fields. A possible link between the fractal\nproperties of the diffuse emission and the resulting clump mass function is\ndiscussed.\n", "  We analyze recently-measured total reaction cross sections for 24-38Mg\nisotopes incident on 12C targets at 240 MeV/nucleon by using the folding model\nand antisymmetrized molecular dynamics(AMD). The folding model well reproduces\nthe measured reaction cross sections, when the projectile densities are\nevaluated by the deformed Woods-Saxon (def-WS) model with AMD deformation.\nMatter radii of 24-38Mg are then deduced from the measured reaction cross\nsections by fine-tuning the parameters of the def-WS model. The deduced matter\nradii are largely enhanced by nuclear deformation. Fully-microscopic AMD\ncalculations with no free parameter well reproduce the deduced matter radii for\n24-36Mg, but still considerably underestimate them for 37,38Mg. The large\nmatter radii suggest that 37,38Mg are candidates for deformed halo nucleus. AMD\nalso reproduces other existing measured ground-state properties (spin-parity,\ntotal binding energy, and one-neutron separation energy) of Mg isotopes.\nNeutron-number (N) dependence of deformation parameter is predicted by AMD.\nLarge deformation is seen from 31Mg with N = 19 to a drip-line nucleus 40Mg\nwith N = 28, indicating that both the N = 20 and 28 magicities disappear. N\ndependence of neutron skin thickness is also predicted by AMD.\n", "  We derive the generalized magneto-absorption spectra for curved graphene\nnanorib- bons and carbon nanotubes by using the Peierls tight-binding model.\nThe main spectral characteristics and the optical selection rules result from\nthe cooperative or competitive relationships between the geometric structure\nand a magnetic field. In curved ribbons, the dominant selection rule remains\nunchanged during the variation of the curvature. When the arc angle increases,\nthe prominent peaks are split, with some even vanishing as the angle exceeds a\ncritical value. In carbon nanotubes, the angular-momentum coupling induces\nextra selection rules, of which more are revealed due to the increase of either\n(both) of the factors: tube diameter and field strength. Particularly once the\ntwo factors exceed certain critical values, the optical spectra could reflect\nthe quasi-Landau-level structures. The identifying features of the spec- tra\nprovide insight into optical excitations for curved systems with either open or\nclosed boundary condition.\n", "  In a class of Randall-Sundrum(RS) models, matter fermions and gauge bosons\nlive in a five dimensional bulk, while the Higgs boson lives in a four\ndimensional visible brane. The Higgs boson can mix with a radion, by a\nHiggs-radion mixing term. It is difficult to directly discover the heavy\nKaluza-Klein(KK) particles at the Large Hadron Collider(LHC), because the mass\nof the lightest KK particle is expected to be above 10 TeV to satisfy\nconstraints from avor changing neutral currents(FCNC). Instead, the precision\nmeasurements of the Higgs sector at the high luminosity LHC(HL-LHC) and the\nInternational Linear Collider(ILC) is a promising way to observe the deviation\noriginating from the Higgs-radion mixing and radiative corrections from the KK\ngauge bosons and matter fermions. For some cases, those effects are separately\ndetermined, providing valuable information on the model. We perform an\nextensive scan of the model parameters to see the expected deviations of the\nHiggs couplings. We also choose several reference points consistent with the\ncurrent data to show the precision of the fundamental parameter measurements at\nthe future colliders. We also study the radion-Z-Z coupling in the model and\ndiscuss the role of the ILC for radion search.\n", "  In this paper we study the chiral phase transition of QCD at finite\ntemperature and density by using the rank-2 confining separable gluon\npropagator model in the framework of Dyson-Schwinger Equations. The critical\nend point is located at (T_CEP, {\\mu}_CEP) = (69 MeV, 270.3 MeV). It is also\nfound that the first order phase transition might not end at one point, but\nexperiences a two-phase coexisting meta-stable state. A comparison with the\nresults in the previous literature is given.\n", "  The paper deals with an integrodifferential operator which models numerous\nphenomena in superconductivity, in biology and in viscoelasticity.\nInitialboundary value problems with Neumann, Dirichlet and mixed boundary\nconditions are analyzed. An asymptotic analysis is achieved proving that for\nlarge t, the in uences of the initial data vanish, while the effects of\nboundary disturbances are everywhere bounded.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the motional excitation of a single ion caused\nby spring-constant and position uctuations of a harmonic trap during trap\nshuttling processes. A detailed study of the sensitivity on noise for several\ntransport protocols and noise spectra is provided. The effect of slow\nspring-constant drifts is also analyzed. Trap trajectories that minimize the\nexcitation are designed combining invariant-based inverse engineering,\nperturbation theory, and optimal control.\n", "  Combining first-principles calculations and spin- and angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy measurements, we identify the helical spin textures\nfor three different Dirac cone states in the interfaced systems of a 2D\ntopological insulator (TI) of Bi(111) bilayer and a 3D TI Bi2Se3 or Bi2Te3. The\nspin texture is found to be the same for the intrinsic Dirac cone of Bi2Se3 or\nBi2Te3 surface state, the extrinsic Dirac cone of Bi bilayer state induced by\nRashba effect, and the hybridized Dirac cone between the former two states.\nFurther orbit- and atom-resolved analysis shows that s and pz orbits have a\nclockwise (counterclockwise) spin rotation tangent to the iso-energy contour of\nupper (lower) Dirac cone, while px and py orbits have an additional radial spin\ncomponent. The Dirac cone states may reside on different atomic layers, but\nhave the same spin texture. Our results suggest that the unique spin texture of\nDirac cone states is a signature property of spin-orbit coupling, independent\nof topology.\n", "  Spin torque from spin current applied to a nanoscale region of a ferromagnet\ncan act as negative magnetic damping and thereby excite self-oscillations of\nits magnetization. In contrast, spin torque uniformly applied to the\nmagnetization of an extended ferromagnetic film does not generate\nself-oscillatory magnetic dynamics but leads to reduction of the saturation\nmagnetization. Here we report studies of the effect of spin torque on a system\nof intermediate dimensionality - a ferromagnetic nanowire. We observe coherent\nself-oscillations of magnetization in a ferromagnetic nanowire serving as the\nactive region of a spin torque oscillator driven by spin orbit torques. Our\nwork demonstrates that magnetization self-oscillations can be excited in a\none-dimensional magnetic system and that dimensions of the active region of\nspin torque oscillators can be extended beyond the nanometer length scale.\n", "  We consider a general multidimensional stochastic differential delay equation\n(SDDE) with state-dependent colored noises. We approximate it by a stochastic\ndifferential equation (SDE) system and calculate its limit as the time delays\nand the correlation times of the noises go to zero. The main result is proven\nusing a theorem about convergence of stochastic integrals by Kurtz and Protter.\nIt formalizes and extends a result that has been obtained in the analysis of a\nnoisy electrical circuit with delayed state-dependent noise, and may be used as\na working SDE approximation of an SDDE modeling a real system where noises are\ncorrelated in time and whose response to noise sources depends on the system's\nstate at a previous time.\n", "  We report on the design, fabrication and characterization of superconducting\ncoplanar waveguide resonators with nanoscopic constrictions. By reducing the\nsize of the center line down to 50 nm, the radio frequency currents are\nconcentrated and the magnetic field in its vicinity is increased. The device\ncharacteristics are only slightly modified by the constrictions, with changes\nin resonance frequency lower than 1% and internal quality factors of the same\norder of magnitude as the original ones. These devices could enable the\nachievement of higher couplings to small magnetic samples or even to single\nmolecular spins and have applications in circuit quantum electrodynamics,\nquantum computing and electron paramagnetic resonance.\n", "  In this paper we define the notion of an open Markov process. An open Markov\nprocess is a generalization of an ordinary Markov process in which populations\nare allowed to flow in and out of the system at certain boundary states. We\nshow that the rate of change of relative entropy in an open Markov process is\nless than or equal to the flow of relative entropy through its boundary states.\nThis can be viewed as a generalization of the Second Law for open Markov\nprocesses. In the case of a Markov process whose equilibrium obeys detailed\nbalance, this inequality puts an upper bound on the rate of change of the free\nenergy for any non-equilibrium distribution.\n", "  Real-world multi-layer networks feature nontrivial dependencies among links\nof different layers. Here we argue that, if links are directed, dependencies\nare twofold. Besides the ordinary tendency of links of different layers to\nalign as the result of `multiplexity', there is also a tendency to anti-align\nas the result of what we call `multireciprocity', i.e. the fact that links in\none layer can be reciprocated by \\emph{opposite} links in a different layer.\nMultireciprocity generalizes the scalar definition of single-layer reciprocity\nto that of a square matrix involving all pairs of layers. We introduce\nmultiplexity and multireciprocity matrices for both binary and weighted\nmultiplexes and validate their statistical significance against maximum-entropy\nnull models that filter out the effects of node heterogeneity. We then perform\na detailed empirical analysis of the World Trade Multiplex (WTM), representing\nthe import-export relationships between world countries in different\ncommodities. We show that the WTM exhibits strong multiplexity and\nmultireciprocity, an effect which is however largely encoded into the degree or\nstrength sequences of individual layers. The residual effects are still\nsignificant and allow to classify pairs of commodities according to their\ntendency to be traded together in the same direction and/or in opposite ones.\nWe also find that the multireciprocity of the WTM is significantly lower than\nthe usual reciprocity measured on the aggregate network. Moreover, layers with\nlow (high) internal reciprocity are embedded within sets of layers with\ncomparably low (high) mutual multireciprocity. This suggests that, in the WTM,\nreciprocity is inherent to groups of related commodities rather than to\nindividual commodities. We discuss the implications for international trade\nresearch focusing on product taxonomies, the product space, and\nfitness/complexity metrics.\n", "  Observing and controlling complex networks are of paramount interest for\nunderstanding complex physical, biological and technological systems. Recent\nstudies have made important advances in identifying sensor or driver nodes,\nthrough which we can observe or control a complex system. Yet, the\nobservational uncertainty induced by measurement noise and the energy required\nfor control continue to be significant challenges in practical applications.\nHere we show that the variability of control energy and observational\nuncertainty for different directions of the state space depend strongly on the\nnumber of driver nodes. In particular, we find that if all nodes are directly\ndriven, control is energetically feasible, as the maximum energy increases\nsublinearly with the system size. If, however, we aim to control a system\nthrough a single node, control in some directions is energetically prohibitive,\nincreasing exponentially with the system size. For the cases in between, the\nmaximum energy decays exponentially when the number of driver nodes increases.\nWe validate our findings in several model and real networks, arriving to a\nseries of fundamental laws to describe the control energy that together deepen\nour understanding of complex systems.\n", "  Redundancy is commonly used to guarantee continued functionality in networked\nsystems. However, often many nodes are vulnerable to the same failure or\nadversary. A \"backup\" path is not sufficient if both paths depend on nodes\nwhich share a vulnerability.For example, if two nodes of the Internet cannot be\nconnected without using routers belonging to a given untrusted entity, then all\nof their communication-regardless of the specific paths utilized-will be\nintercepted by the controlling entity.In this and many other cases, the\nvulnerabilities affecting the network are disjoint: each node has exactly one\nvulnerability but the same vulnerability can affect many nodes. To discover\noptimal redundancy in this scenario, we describe each vulnerability as a color\nand develop a \"color-avoiding percolation\" which uncovers a hidden\ncolor-avoiding connectivity. We present algorithms for color-avoiding\npercolation of general networks and an analytic theory for random graphs with\nuniformly distributed colors including critical phenomena. We demonstrate our\ntheory by uncovering the hidden color-avoiding connectivity of the Internet. We\nfind that less well-connected countries are more likely able to communicate\nsecurely through optimally redundant paths than highly connected countries like\nthe US. Our results reveal a new layer of hidden structure in complex systems\nand can enhance security and robustness through optimal redundancy in a wide\nrange of systems including biological, economic and communications networks.\n", "  We consider multi-particle systems with linear deterministic hamiltonian\ndynamics. Besides Liouville measure it has continuum of invariant tori and thus\ncontinuum of invariant measures. But if one specified particle is subjected to\na simple linear deterministic transformation (velocity flip) in random time\nmoments, we prove convergence to Liouville measure for any initial state. For\nthe proof it appeared necessary to study non-linear transformations on the\nenergy surface.\n", "  We study the large-$n$ limit of the probability $p_{2n,2k}$ that a random\n$2n\\times 2n$ matrix sampled from the real Ginibre ensemble has $2k$ real\neigenvalues. We prove that, $$\\lim_{n\\rightarrow \\infty}\\frac {1}{\\sqrt{2n}}\n\\log p_{2n,2k}=\\lim_{n\\rightarrow \\infty}\\frac {1}{\\sqrt{2n}} \\log p_{2n,0}=\n-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\zeta\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right),$$ where $\\zeta$ is the\nRiemann zeta-function. Moreover, for any sequence of non-negative integers\n$(k_n)_{n\\geq 1}$, $$\\lim_{n\\rightarrow \\infty}\\frac {1}{\\sqrt{2n}} \\log\np_{2n,2k_n}=-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\zeta\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right),$$ provided\n$\\lim_{n\\rightarrow \\infty} \\left(n^{-1/2}\\log(n)\\right) k_{n}=0$.\n", "  If the second law of thermodynamics forbids a transition from one state to\nanother, then it is still possible to make the transition happen by using a\nsufficient amount of work. But if we do not have access to this amount of work,\ncan the transition happen probabilistically? In the thermodynamic limit, this\nprobability tends to zero, but here we find that for finite-sized systems, it\ncan be finite. We compute the maximum probability of a transition or a\nthermodynamical fluctuation from any initial state to any final state, and show\nthat this maximum can be achieved for any final state which is block-diagonal\nin the energy eigenbasis. We also find upper and lower bounds on this\ntransition probability, in terms of the work of transition. As a bi-product, we\nintroduce a finite set of thermodynamical monotones related to the\nthermo-majorization criteria which governs state transitions, and compute the\nwork of transition in terms of them. The trade-off between the probability of a\ntransition, and any partial work added to aid in that transition is also\nconsidered. Our results have applications in entanglement theory, and we find\nthe amount of entanglement required (or gained) when transforming one pure\nentangled state into any other.\n", "  This is Part II of the paper series on data-compatible T-matrix completion\n(DCTMC), which is a method for solving nonlinear inverse problems. Part I of\nthe series contains theory and here we present simulations for inverse\nscattering of scalar waves. The underlying mathematical model is the scalar\nwave equation and the object function that is reconstructed is the medium\nsusceptibility. The simulations are relevant to ultrasound tomographic imaging\nand seismic tomography. It is shown that DCTMC is a viable method for solving\nstrongly nonlinear inverse problems with large data sets. It provides not only\nthe overall shape of the object but the quantitative contrast, which can\ncorrespond, for instance, to the variable speed of sound in the imaged medium.\n", "  We present measurements of radioactive contamination in the high-resistivity\nsilicon charge-coupled devices (CCDs) used by the DAMIC experiment to search\nfor dark matter particles. Novel analysis methods, which exploit the unique\nspatial resolution of CCDs, were developed to identify $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$\nparticles. Uranium and thorium contamination in the CCD bulk was measured\nthrough $\\alpha$ spectroscopy, with an upper limit on the $^{238}$U\n($^{232}$Th) decay rate of 5 (15) kg$^{-1}$ d$^{-1}$ at 95% CL. We also\nsearched for pairs of spatially correlated electron tracks separated in time by\nup to tens of days, as expected from $^{32}$Si-$^{32}$P or\n$^{210}$Pb-$^{210}$Bi sequences of $\\beta$ decays. The decay rate of $^{32}$Si\nwas found to be $80^{+110}_{-65}$ kg$^{-1}$ d$^{-1}$ (95% CI). An upper limit\nof $\\sim$35 kg$^{-1}$ d$^{-1}$ (95% CL) on the $^{210}$Pb decay rate was\nobtained independently by $\\alpha$ spectroscopy and the $\\beta$ decay sequence\nsearch. These levels of radioactive contamination are sufficiently low for the\nsuccessful operation of CCDs in the forthcoming 100 g DAMIC detector.\n", "  We derive an analytic expression for the height correlation function of a\nrough surface based on the inverse wave scattering method of Kirchhoff theory.\nThe expression directly relates the height correlation function to diffuse\nscattered intensity along a linear path at fixed polar angle. We test the\nsolution by measuring the angular distribution of light scattered from rough\nsilicon surfaces, and comparing extracted height correlation functions to those\nderived from atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results agree closely with AFM\nover a wider range of roughness parameters than previous formulations of the\ninverse scattering problem, while relying less on large-angle scatter data. Our\nexpression thus provides an accurate analytical equation for the height\ncorrelation function of a wide range of surfaces based on measurements using a\nsimple, fast experimental procedure.\n", "  We study a diluted Blume-Capel model of 3-state sites as an attempt to\nunderstand how some social processes as cooperation or organization happen. For\nthis aim we study the effect of the complex network topology on the equilibrium\nproperties of the model, by focusing on three different substrates: random\ngraph, Watts-Strogatz and Newman substrates.\n", "  In this note, we prove Strichartz estimates for scattering states of scalar\ncharge transfer models in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$. Based on the idea of the proof of\nStrichartz estimates which follows \\cite{CM,RSS}, we also show the energy of\nthe whole evolution is bounded independently of time without using the phase\nspace method, for example, in \\cite{Graf}. One can easily generalize our\nargument to $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for $n\\geq3$. Finally, in the last section, we\ndiscuss the extension of these results to matrix charge transfer models in\n$\\mathbb{R}^{3}$.\n", "  Supersymmetric $SO(10)$ grand unified models with renormalizable Yukawa\ncouplings involving only ${\\bf 10}$ and $\\overline{\\bf 126}$ Higgs fields have\nbeen shown to realize the fermion masses and mixings economically. In previous\nworks, the sum rule of the fermion mass matrices are given by inputting the\nquark matrices, and the neutrino mixings are predicted in this framework. Now\nthe three neutrino mixings have been measured, and in this paper, we give the\nsum rule by inputting the lepton mass matrices, which makes clear certain\nfeatures of the solution, especially if the vacuum expectation values of ${\\bf\n126}+ \\overline{\\bf126}$ ($v_R$) are large and the right-handed neutrinos are\nheavy. We perform the $\\chi^2$ analyses to fit the fermion masses and mixings\nusing the sum rule. In previous works, the best fit appears at $v_R \\sim\n10^{13}$ GeV, and the fit at the large $v_R$ scale ($\\sim 10^{16}$ GeV) has\nbeen less investigated. Our expression of the sum rule has a benefit to\nunderstand the flavor structure in the large $v_R$ solution. Using the fit\nresults, we perform the calculation of the $\\mu \\to e\\gamma$ process and the\nelectric dipole moment of electron, and the importance of $v_R$ dependence\nemerges in low energy phenomena. We also show the prediction of the CP phase in\nthe neutrino oscillations, which can be tested in the near future.\n", "  The multiferroic compound CuO exhibits low temperature magnetic properties\nsimilar to antiferromagnetic iron oxides, while the electronic properties have\nmuch more in common with the high $T_c$ cuprate superconductors. This suggests\nnovel possibilities for the ultrafast optical excitation of magnetism. On the\nbasis on atomistic spin dynamics simulations, we study the effect of\nphonon-assisted multimagnon absorption and photodoping on the spin dynamics in\nthe vicinity of the first-order phase transition from collinear to spin-spiral\nmagnetic order. Similar as in recent experiments, we find that for both\nexcitations the phase transition can proceed on the picosecond timescale.\nInterestingly, however, these excitation mechanisms display very distinct\ndynamics. Following photodoping, the spin system first cools down on sub-ps\ntimescales, which we explain as an ultrafast magnetocaloric effect. Opposed to\nthis, following phonon-assisted multimagnon excitation the spin systems rapidly\nheats up and subsequently evolves to the noncollinear phase even under the\ninfluence of isotropic exchange interactions alone.\n", "  Light diffusion is usually associated with thick, opaque media. Indeed,\nmultiple scattering is necessary for the onset of the diffusive regime and such\ncondition is generally not met in almost transparent media. Nonetheless, at\nlong enough times, transport in an infinite thin slab is still determined by a\nmultiple scattering process whose complete characterization is lacking. In this\npaper we show that, after a short transient, the mean square width of the\ntransmitted intensity still exhibits a simple linear increase with time as\npredicted by diffusion theory, even at optical thickness as low as one.\nInterestingly, such linear growth is predicted not to depend neither on the\nslab thickness nor on its refractive index contrast, yet the accuracy of this\nsimple approximation in the ballistic-to-diffusive regime hasn't been\ninvestigated so far. By means of Monte Carlo simulations, we find clear\nevidence that boundary conditions play an active role in redefining the very\nasymptotic value of the diffusion coefficient by directly modifying the\nstatistical distributions underlying light transport in such media. In this\nrespect, we demonstrate the need to distinguish between a set of intrinsic and\neffective transport parameters, whose relation and interplay with boundary\nconditions remains to be fully understood.\n", "  In this paper an extended scalability condition is proposed to achieve the\nground-state stability for a class of multipartite quantum systems which may\ninvolve two-body interactions, and an explicit procedure to construct the\ndissipation control is presented. Moreover, we show that dissipation control\ncan be used for automatic error correction in addition to stabilization. We\ndemonstrate the stabilization and error correction of three-qubit repetition\ncode states using dissipation control.\n", "  We revisit the stability of the complex structure moduli in the large volume\nregime of type-IIB flux compactifications. We argue that when the volume is not\nexponentially large, such as in K\\\"ahler uplifted dS vacua, the quantum\ncorrections to the tree-level mass spectrum can induce tachyonic instabilities\nin this sector. We discuss a Random Matrix Theory model for the classical\nspectrum of the complex structure fields, and derive a new stability bound\ninvolving the compactification volume and the (very large) number of moduli. We\nalso present a new class of vacua for this sector where the mass spectrum\npresents a finite gap, without invoking large supersymmetric masses. At these\nvacua the complex structure sector is protected from tachyonic instabilities\neven at non-exponential volumes. A distinguishing feature is that all fermions\nin this sector are lighter than the gravitino.\n", "  We prove sharp remainder bounds for the Berezin-Toeplitz quantization and\npresent applications to semiclassical quantum measurements.\n", "  Forbidden transitions between energy levels typically involve violation of\nselection rules imposed by symmetry and/or conservation laws. A nanomagnet\ntunneling between up and down states violates angular momentum conservation\nbecause of broken rotational symmetry. Here we report observations of highly\nforbidden transitions between spin states in a Ni$_4$ single-molecule magnet in\nwhich a single photon can induce the spin to change by several times $\\hbar$,\nnearly reversing the direction of the spin. These observations are understood\nas tunneling-assisted transitions that lift the standard $\\Delta m = \\pm 1$\nselection rule for single-photon transitions. These transitions are observed at\nlow applied fields, where tunneling is dominated by the molecule's intrinsic\nanisotropy and the field acts as a perturbation. Such transitions can be\nexploited to create macroscopic superposition states that are not typically\naccessible through single-photon $\\Delta m = \\pm 1$ transitions.\n", "  In the present article we analyze Non-Perturbative Renormalization Group flow\nequations in the order phase of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $O(N)$ invariant scalar\nmodels in the derivative expansion approximation scheme. We first address the\nbehavior of the leading order approximation (LPA), discussing for which\nregulators the flow is smooth and gives a convex free energy and when it\nbecomes singular. We improve the exact known solutions in the \"internal\" region\nof the potential and exploit this solution in order to implement a numerical\nalgorithm that is much more stable that previous ones for $N>1$. After that, we\nstudy the flow equations at second order of the Derivative Expansion and\nanalyze how and when LPA results change. We also discuss the evolution of field\nrenormalization factors.\n", "  We report on the generation of single-photon pulse trains at a repetition\nrate of up to 1 GHz. We achieve this high speed by modulating the external\nvoltage applied on an electrically contacted quantum dot microlens, which is\noptically excited by a continuous-wave laser. By modulating the\nphotoluminescence of the quantum dot microlens using a square-wave voltage,\nsingle-photon emission is triggered with a response time as short as 270 ps\nbeing 6.5 times faster than the radiative lifetime of 1.75 ns. This large\nreduction in the characteristic emission time is enabled by a rapid capacitive\ngating of emission from the quantum dot placed in the intrinsic region of a\np-i-n-junction biased below the onset of electroluminescence. Here, the rising\nedge of the applied voltage pulses triggers the emission of single photons from\nthe optically excited quantum dot. The non-classical nature of the photon pulse\ntrain generated at GHz-speed is proven by intensity autocorrelation\nmeasurements. Our results combine optical excitation with fast electrical\ngating and thus show promise for the generation of indistinguishable single\nphotons at high rates, exceeding the limitations set by the intrinsic radiative\nlifetime.\n", "  The tunneling between the two ground states of an Ising ferromagnet is a\ntypical example of many-body tunneling processes between two local minima, as\nthey occur during quantum annealing. Performing quantum Monte Carlo (QMC)\nsimulations we find that the QMC tunneling rate displays the same scaling with\nsystem size, as the rate of incoherent tunneling. The scaling in both cases is\n$O(\\Delta^2)$, where $\\Delta$ is the tunneling splitting. An important\nconsequence is that QMC simulations can be used to predict the performance of a\nquantum annealer for tunneling through a barrier. Furthermore, by using open\ninstead of periodic boundary conditions in imaginary time, equivalent to a\nprojector QMC algorithm, we obtain a quadratic speedup for QMC, and achieve\nlinear scaling in $\\Delta$. We provide a physical understanding of these\nresults and their range of applicability based on an instanton picture.\n", "  Wave effects of phonons can give rise to controllability of heat conduction\nbeyond that by particle scattering at surfaces and interfaces. In this work, we\npropose a new class of 3D nanostructure: a silicon-nanowire-cage (SiNWC)\nstructure consisting of silicon nanowires (SiNWs) connected by\nnano-cross-junctions (NCJs). We perform equilibrium molecular dynamics (MD)\nsimulations, and find an ultralow value of thermal conductivity of SiNWC, 0.173\nWm-1K-1, which is one order lower than that of SiNWs. By further modal analysis\nand atomistic Green's function calculations, we identify that the large\nreduction is due to significant phonon localization induced by the phonon local\nresonance and hybridization at the junction part in a wide range of phonon\nmodes. This localization effect does not require the cage to be periodic,\nunlike the phononic crystals, and can be realized in structures that are easier\nto synthesize, for instance in a form of randomly oriented SiNWs network.\n", "  Rigorously establishing that the error in an experimental quantum operation\nis beneath the threshold for fault-tolerant quantum computation currently\nrequires considering the worst-case error, which can be orders of magnitude\nsmaller than the average gate infidelities routinely reported in experiments.\nWe show that an improved bound on the worst-case error can be obtained by also\nconsidering the recently-introduced unitarity of the noise where the upper and\nlower bounds differ by a factor of $\\approx 2.45$ for unital qubit channels. We\nprove that the contribution from the nonunital part of any noise map is at most\non the order of the average gate infidelity and so is negligible relative to\nany coherent contribution. We also show that the \"average\" error rate when\nmeasurements are not restricted to an eigenbasis containing the state of the\nsystem exhibits the same scaling as the worst-case error, which, for coherent\nnoise, is the square-root of the infidelity. We also obtain improved bounds for\nthe diamond distance when the noise map is known (or approximately known).\n", "  We report simultaneous transport and scanning microwave impedance microscopy\nto examine the correlation between transport quantization and filling of the\nbulk Landau levels in the quantum Hall regime in gated graphene devices.\nSurprisingly, a comparison of these measurements reveals that quantized\ntransport typically occurs below the complete filling of bulk Landau levels,\nwhen the bulk is still conductive. This result points to a revised\nunderstanding of transport quantization when carriers are accumulated by\ngating. We discuss the implications on transport study of the quantum Hall\neffect in graphene and related topological states in other two-dimensional\nelectron systems.\n", "  When quarks hadronize, they accelerate. Because they carry electric charge,\nthey must radiate light as they accelerate and hadronize. This is true not only\nin jets but also in heavy ion collisions, where a thermalized plasma of quarks\nand gluons cools into a gas of hadrons. First, direct emission of photons from\ntwo quarks coalescing into pions is calculated using the quark-meson model. The\nyield of final-state photons to pions is found to be about $e^2/g^2_{\\pi qq}$,\nwhich is on the order of a percent. Second, the yield of photons from the decay\nof highly excited color singlets, which may exist ephemerally during\nhadronizaton, is estimated. Because these contributions occur late in the\nreaction, they should carry significant elliptic flow, which may help explain\nthe large observed flow of direct photons at RHIC by the PHENIX Collaboration\nat the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The enhanced emission also helps\nexplain PHENIX's surprisingly large observed $\\gamma/\\pi$ ratio.\n", "  We suggest that holography can be formulated in terms of the information\ncapacity of the St\\\"uckelberg degrees of freedom that maintain gauge invariance\nof the theory in the presence of an information boundary. These St\\\"uckelbergs\nact as qubits that account for a certain fraction of quantum information. Their\ninformation capacity is measured by the ratio of the inverse St\\\"uckelberg\nenergy gap to the size of the system. Systems with the smallest gap are\nmaximally holographic. For massless gauge systems this information measure is\nuniversally equal to the inverse coupling evaluated at the systems' length\nscale. In this language it becomes very transparent why the St\\\"uckelberg\ninformation capacity of black holes saturates the Bekenstein bound and accounts\nfor the entire information of the system. The physical reason is that the\nstrength of quantum interaction is bounded from below by the gravitational\ncoupling, which scales as area. Observing the striking similarity between the\nscalings of the energy gap of the boundary St\\\"uckelberg modes and the\nBogoliubov modes of critical many-body systems, we establish a connection\nbetween holography and quantum criticality through the correspondence between\nthese modes.\n", "  Erosive collisions among planetary embryos in the inner solar system can lead\nto multiple remnant bodies, varied in mass, composition and residual velocity.\nSome of the smaller, unbound debris may become available to seed the main\nasteroid belt. The makeup of these collisionally produced bodies is different\nfrom the canonical chondritic composition, in terms of rock/iron ratio and may\ncontain further shock-processed material. Having some of the material in the\nasteroid belt owe its origin from collisions of larger planetary bodies may\nhelp in explaining some of the diversity and oddities in composition of\ndifferent asteroid groups.\n", "  Cilia and flagella are hairlike organelles that propel cells through fluid.\nThe active motion of the axoneme, the motile structure inside cilia and\nflagella, is powered by molecular motors of the dynein family. These motors\ngenerate forces and torques that slide and bend the microtubule doublets within\nthe axoneme. To create regular waveforms the activities of the dyneins must be\ncoordinated. It is thought that coordination is mediated by stresses due to\nradial, transverse, or sliding deformations, that build up within the moving\naxoneme. However, which particular component of the stress regulates the motors\nto produce the observed flagellar waveforms remains an open question. To\naddress this question, we describe the axoneme as a three-dimensional bundle of\nfilaments and characterize its mechanics. We show that regulation of the motors\nby radial and transverse stresses can lead to a coordinated flagellar motion\nonly in the presence of twist. By comparison, regulation by shear stress is\npossible without twist. We calculate emergent beating patterns in twisted\naxonemes resulting from regulation by transverse stresses. The waveforms are\nsimilar to those observed in flagella of Chlamydomonas and sperm. Due to the\ntwist, the waveform has non-planar components, which result in swimming\ntrajectories such as twisted ribbons and helices that agree with observations.\n", "  Order by disorder is a decision making process for frustrated systems but\noften leads to simple answers. We study order by disorder in the kagome Kondo\nmodel known for its complexity seeking rich decision making capabilities. At\nhalf filling and large Kondo coupling to hopping ratio $J_K/t$, the full\nmanifold of 120$^o$ kagome ground states are degenerate at second order in\n$t/J_K$. We show this degeneracy lifts at sixth order when a fermion can hop\naround a hexagon and feel the Berry flux induced by a given spin texture. Using\nMonte-Carlo we then seek the ground state of this sixth order Hamiltonian and\nfind in a 4x4 unit cell system that a co-planar 2x4 unit cell order is selected\nover the $\\sqrt{3}\\times\\sqrt{3}$, $q=0$ and cuboc1 states, a result that\nsurvives even in the thermodynamic limit. This state is selected for its SU(2)\nflux properties induced by the spin texture and is analogous to the integer\nquantum Hall effect. Given the existence of numerous quantum Hall plateaus in\nother systems, the existence of this 2x4 unit cell state suggests that complex\ndecision making is possible on the manifold of 120$^o$ states and achievable in\ndifferent kagome-Kondo models.\n", "  We systematically study light (< few GeV) Dark Matter (DM) models that\nthermalize with visible matter through the Higgs portal and identify the\nremaining gaps in the viable parameter space. Such models require a comparably\nlight scalar mediator that mixes with the Higgs to avoid DM overproduction and\ncan be classified according to whether this mediator decays (in)visibly. In a\nrepresentative benchmark model with Dirac fermion DM, we find that, even with\nconservative assumptions about the DM-mediator coupling and mass ratio, the\nregime in which the mediator is heavier than the DM is fully ruled out by a\ncombination of collider, rare meson decay, and direct detection limits; future\nand planned experiments including NA62 can further improve sensitivity to\nscenarios in which the Higgs portal interaction does not determine the DM\nabundance. The opposite, regime in which the mediator is lighter than the DM\nand the latter annihilates to pairs of visibly-decaying mediators is still\nviable, but much of the parameter space is covered by rare meson decay,\nsupernova cooling, beam dump, and direct detection constraints. Nearly all of\nthese conclusions apply broadly to the simplest variations (e.g. scalar or\nasymmetric DM). Future experiments including SHiP, NEWS, and Super-CDMS SNOLAB\ncan greatly improve coverage to this class of models.\n", "  We investigate the backreaction of the quantum fluctuations of a very light\n($m \\!\\lesssim\\! H_{\\text{today}}$) nonminimally coupled spectator scalar field\non the expansion dynamics of the Universe. The one-loop expectation value of\nthe energy momentum tensor of these fluctuations, as a measure of the\nbackreaction, is computed throughout the expansion history from the early\ninflationary universe until the onset of recent acceleration today. We show\nthat, when the nonminimal coupling $\\xi$ to Ricci curvature is negative ($\\xi_c\n\\!=\\! 1/6$ corresponding to conformal coupling), the quantum backreaction grows\nexponentially during inflation, such that it can grow large enough rather\nquickly (within a few hundred e-foldings) to survive until late time and\nconstitute a contribution of the cosmological constant type of the right\nmagnitude to appreciably alter the expansion dynamics. The unique feature of\nthis model is in that, under rather generic assumptions, inflation provides\nnatural explanation for the initial conditions needed to explain the late-time\naccelerated expansion of the Universe, making it a particularly attractive\nmodel of dark energy.\n", "  In the current concordance cosmology small halos are expected to be\ncompletely dark and can significantly perturb low-mass galaxies during minor\nmerger interactions. These interactions may well contribute to the diversity of\nthe dwarf galaxy population. Dwarf galaxies in the field are often observed to\nhave peculiarities in their structure, morphology, and kinematics, as well as\nstrong bursts of star formation without apparent cause. We aim to characterize\nthe signatures of minor mergers of dwarf galaxies with dark satellites to aid\ntheir observational identification. We explore and quantify a variety of\nstructural, morphological, and kinematic indicators of merging dwarf galaxies\nand their remnants using a suite of hydrodynamical simulations. The most\nsensitive indicators of mergers with dark satellites are large asymmetries in\nthe gaseous and stellar distributions, enhanced central surface brightness and\nstarbursts, and velocity offsets and misalignments between the cold gas and\nstellar components. In general, merging systems span a wide range of values of\nthe most commonly used indicators, while isolated objects tend to have more\nconfined values. Interestingly, we find in our simulations that a significantly\noff-centered burst of star formation can pinpoint the location of the dark\nsatellite. Observational systems with such characteristics are perhaps the most\npromising for unveiling the presence of the hitherto, missing satellites.\n", "  The generation of a sky model for calibration of Square Kilometre Array\nobservations requires a fast method of automatic point source detection and\ncharacterisation. In recent years, point source detection in two-dimensional\nimages has been implemented by using several thresholding approaches. In the\nfirst phase of the SKA we will need a fast implementation capable of dealing\nwith very large images (80,000 x 80,000 pixels). While the underlying\nalgorithms scale suitably with image size, the present implementations do not.\nWe make some comments on the pertinent trade-offs for scaling these\nimplementations to SKA-levels.\n", "  Reconstructing the structural connectivity between interacting units from\nobserved activity is a challenge across many different disciplines. The\nfundamental first step is to establish whether or to what extent the\ninteractions between the units can be considered pairwise and, thus, can be\nmodeled as an interaction network with simple links corresponding to pairwise\ninteractions. In principle this can be determined by comparing the maximum\nentropy given the bivariate probability distributions to the true joint\nentropy. In many practical cases this is not an option since the bivariate\ndistributions needed may not be reliably estimated, or the optimization is too\ncomputationally expensive. Here we present an approach that allows one to use\nmutual informations as a proxy for the bivariate distributions. This has the\nadvantage of being less computationally expensive and easier to estimate. We\nachieve this by introducing a novel entropy maximization scheme that is based\non conditioning on entropies and mutual informations. This renders our approach\ntypically superior to other methods based on linear approximations. The\nadvantages of the proposed method are documented using oscillator networks and\na resting-state human brain network as generic relevant examples.\n", "  Production of a neutrino source through proton induced reaction is studied by\nusing the particle transport code, GEANT4. Unstable isotope such as $^{27}$Si\ncan be produced when $^{27}$Al target is bombarded by 15 MeV energetic proton\nbeams. Through the beta decay process of the unstable isotope, a new\nelectron-neutrino source in the 1.0 $\\sim$ 5.0 MeV energy range is obtained.\nProton induced reactions are simulated with JENDL High Energy File 2007\n(JENDL/HE-2007) data and other nuclear data. For radioactive decay processes,\nwe use \"G4RadioactiveDecay\" model based on the Evaluated Nuclear Structure Data\nFile (ENSDF). We suggest target systems required for future's solar neutrino\nexperiments, in particular, for the vacuum-matter transition region. As for the\ndetection system of the new neutrino source, we evaluate reaction rates for\navailable radiochemical detectors and LENA type scintillator detector.\nPossibility of detecting sterile neutrinos is also discussed.\n", "  In recent work, Baez, Fong and the author introduced a framework for\ndescribing Markov processes equipped with a detailed balanced equilibrium as\nopen systems of a certain type. These `open Markov processes' serve as the\nbuilding blocks for more complicated processes. In this paper, we describe the\npotential application of this framework in the modeling of biological systems\nas open systems maintained away from equilibrium. We show that non-equilibrium\nsteady states emerge in open systems of this type, even when the rates of the\nunderlying process are such that a detailed balanced equilibrium is permitted.\nIt is shown that these non-equilibrium steady states minimize a quadratic form\nwhich we call `dissipation.' In some circumstances, the dissipation is\napproximately equal to the rate of change of relative entropy plus a correction\nterm. On the other hand, Prigogine's principle of minimum entropy production\ngenerally fails for non-equilibrium steady states. We use a simple model of\nmembrane transport to illustrate these concepts.\n", "  An absorption feature is occasionally reported around 11 microns in\nastronomical spectra, including those of forming stars. Candidate carriers\ninclude water ice, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), silicon carbide,\ncrystalline silicates or even carbonates. All are known constituents of cosmic\ndust in one or more types of environments, though not necessarily together. In\nthis paper we present new ground-based 8-13 micron spectra of one evolved star,\nseveral embedded young stellar objects (YSOs) and a background source lying\nbehind a large column of the interstellar medium (ISM) toward the Galactic\nCentre. Our observations, obtained at a spectral resolution of approximately\n100, are compared with previous lower resolution data, as well as data obtained\nwith the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) on these and other targets. By\npresenting a subset of a larger sample our aim is to establish the reality of\nthe feature and subsequently speculate on its carrier. All evidence points\ntoward crystalline silicate. For instance, the 11 micron band profile is well\nmatched with the emissivity of crystalline olivine. Furthermore, the apparent\nassociation of the absorption feature with a sharp polarisation signature in\nthe spectrum of two previously reported cases suggests a carrier with a\nrelatively high band strength compared to amorphous silicates. If true, this\nwould either set back the evolutionary stage in which silicates are\ncrystallised, either to the embedded phase or even before within the ISM, or\nelse the silicates ejected from the outflows of evolved stars retain some of\ntheir crystalline identity during their long residence in the ISM.\n", "  In the framework of the quark combination, we derive the yield formulas and\nstudy the yield ratios of the hidden-charm pentaquark states in\nultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. We propose some interesting yield\nratios which clearly exhibit the production relationships between different\nhidden-charm pentaquark states. We show how to employ a specific quark\ncombination model to evaluate the yields of exotic $P_c^+(4380)$, $P_c^+(4450)$\nand their partners on the basis of reproducing the yields of normal identified\nhadrons, and execute the calculations in central Pb+Pb collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}= 2.76$ TeV as an example.\n", "  After the demonstration of the feasibility of hypernuclear spectroscopy with\nheavy-ion beams, the HypHI Collaboration will next focus on the study of\nproton- and neutron-rich hypernuclei. The use of a fragment separator for the\nproduction and separation of rare isotope beams is a crucial aspect to\nproducing hypernuclei far from the stability line. Precise spectroscopy of\nexotic hypernuclei is planned to be carried out at the GSI and later at the\nFAIR facility with the FRS and Super-FRS fragment separators. A systematic\nstudy and an optimization analysis were performed in order to determine optimal\nexperimental conditions for producing hypernuclei with high isospin. The\noptimal conditions are obtained based on theoretical models for the heavy-ion\ninduced reaction and hypernuclei production. Experimental efficiencies for the\nproduction of exotic secondary beams were also taken into account via Monte\nCarlo simulations of the fragment separator. The developed methodology is\npresented to deduce the expected yields of $^8_\\Lambda$Be and subsequently\nother proton-rich and neutron-rich hypernuclei.\n", "  Results on particle creation from vacuum by the gravitational field of the\nexpanding Friedmann Universe are presented. Finite results for the density of\nparticles and the energy density for created particles are given for different\nexact solutions for different regimes of the expansion of the Universe. The\nresults are obtained as for conformal as for nonconformal particles. The\nhypothesis of the origination of visible matter from the decay of created from\nvacuum superheavy particles identified with the dark matter is discussed.\n", "  Transverse momentum ($p_T$) and rapidity ($y$) spectra of $Z$ bosons and\nquarkonium states (some charmonium $c\\bar c$ mesons such as $J/\\psi$ and\n$\\psi(2S)$, and some bottomonium $b\\bar b$ mesons such as $\\Upsilon(1S)$,\n$\\Upsilon(2S)$, and $\\Upsilon(3S)$) produced in proton-proton ($pp$) and\nlead-lead (Pb-Pb) collisions at the large hadron collider (LHC) are uniformly\ndescribed by a hybrid model of two-component Erlang distribution for $p_T$\nspectrum and two-component Gaussian distribution for $y$ spectrum. The former\ndistribution results from a multisource thermal model, and the latter one\nresults from the revised Landau hydrodynamic model. The modelling results are\nin agreement with the experimental data measured in $pp$ collisions at\ncenter-of-mass energies $\\sqrt{s}=2.76$ and 7 TeV, and in Pb-Pb collisions at\ncenter-of-mass energy per nucleon pair $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$ TeV. Based on the\nparameter values extracted from $p_T$ and $y$ spectra, the event patterns\n(particle scatter plots) in two-dimensional $p_T$-$y$ space and in\nthree-dimensional velocity space are obtained.\n", "  We study the dynamics of an interacting classical gas trapped in a\ndouble-well potential at finite temperature. Two model potentials are\nconsidered: a cubic box with a square barrier in the middle, and a harmonic\ntrap with a gaussian barrier along one direction. The study is performed using\nthe Boltzmann equation, solved numerically via the test-particle method. We\nintroduce and discuss a simple analytical model that allows to provide\nestimates of the relaxation time, which are compared with numerical results.\nFinally, we use our findings to make numerical and analytical predictions for\nthe case of a fermionic mixture in the normal-fluid phase in a realistic\ndouble-well potential relevant for experiments with cold atoms.\n", "  Based on Son-Yamamoto relation obtained for transverse part of triangle axial\nanomaly in ${\\rm QCD}_4$, we derive its analog in two-dimensional system. It\nconnects the transverse part of mixed vector-axial current two-point function\nwith diagonal vector and axial current two-point functions. Being fully\nnon-perturbative, this relation may be regarded as anomaly matching for\nconductivities or certain transport coefficients depending on the system. We\nconsider the holographic RG flows in holographic Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons theory\nvia the Hamilton-Jacobi equation with respect to the radial coordinate. Within\nthis holographic model it is found that the RG flows for the following\nrelations are diagonal: Son-Yamamoto relation and the left-right polarization\noperator. Thus the Son-Yamamoto relation holds at wide range of energy scales.\n", "  We investigate the entanglement spectrum of the ground state of\nSu-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard model. The topological phases of the model can be\nidentified by degeneracy of the largest eigenvalues of entanglement spectrum.\nThe study of the periodic boundary condition is enough to obtain the phase\ndiagram of the model, without the consideration of the open boundary condition\ncase. Physical interpretation about the bulk-edge correspondence in the\nentanglement spectrum is presented. The method of the entanglement spectrum can\nbe applicable in studying other topological phases of matter.\n", "  We derived the Berry connection of vector vortex states (VVSs) from the\n\"true\" Hamiltonian obtained through the Maxwell--Schr\\\"odinger equation for an\ninhomogeneous anisotropic (IA) medium, and we experimentally demonstrated\nmeasurement of the corresponding Pancharatnam--Berry (PB) geometrical phase of\nVVSs. The PB phase (PBP) of VVSs can be divided into two phases: homogeneous\nand inhomogeneous PBPs. Homogeneous and inhomogeneous PBPs are related to the\nconventional PBP and the spatially-dependent geometric phase given by an IA\nmedium such as a polarization converter, respectively. We theoretically\ndetected that inhomogeneous PBP accumulation originates from the gauge\ndependence of the index of the hybrid-order Poincar\\'e sphere, which provides\nan alternate method for understanding optical spin--orbital angular momentum\nconversion. The homogeneous PBP, which is explicitly observed for the first\ntime, has implications for quantum state manipulation and information\nprocessing.\n", "  To date, both quantum theory, and Einstein's theory of general relativity\nhave passed every experimental test in their respective regimes. Nevertheless,\nalmost since their inception, there has been debate surrounding whether they\nshould be unified and by now there exists strong theoretical arguments pointing\nto the necessity of quantising the gravitational field. In recent years, a\nnumber of experiments have been proposed which, if successful, should give\ninsight into features at the Planck scale. Here we review some of the\nmotivations, from the perspective of semi-classical arguments, to expect new\nphysical effects at the overlap of quantum theory and general relativity. We\nconclude with a short introduction to some of the proposals being made to\nfacilitate empirical verification.\n", "  Recently, the nonlocal optimal probabilistic cloning (NLOPC) of two\nnon-orthogonal qubit states has been proposed [Phys. Rev. A 86, 052332 (2012)]\nby means of an experimental setup based on a pair of twin photons in a\nmaximally entangled state. Here we study the performance of the NLOPC protocol\nwhen implemented via a partially entangled state. We show that the errors\nintroduced by the use of partial entanglement can be undone by applying a\nquantum state discrimination process. Since quantum state discrimination is a\nprobabilistic process the correction succeeds with a certain probability but\nproduces perfect clones. We also studied how to modified the setup to produce\nlocal copies.\n", "  We provide a protocol to measure out-of-time-order correlation functions.\nThese correlation functions are of theoretical interest for diagnosing the\nscrambling of quantum information in black holes and strongly interacting\nquantum systems generally. Measuring them requires an echo-type sequence in\nwhich the sign of a many-body Hamiltonian is reversed. We detail an\nimplementation employing cold atoms and cavity quantum electrodynamics to\nrealize the chaotic kicked top model, and we analyze effects of dissipation to\nverify its feasibility with current technology. Finally, we propose in broad\nstrokes a number of other experimental platforms where similar\nout-of-time-order correlation functions can be measured.\n", "  We have proposed optical tunable CNOT (XOR) and XNOR logic gates using\ntwo-dimensional photonic crystal (2DPhC) cavities. Where, air rods with square\nlattice array have been embedded in Ag-Polymer substrate with refractive index\nof 1.59. In this work, we have enhanced speed of logic gates by applying two\ninput signals with a phase difference at the same wavelength for 2DPhC\ncavities. Where, we have adjusted the phases of input and control signals equal\nwith {\\pi}/3 and zero, respectively. The response time of the structure and\nquality factor of the cavities are in the range of femtosecond and 2000,\nrespectively. Then, we have used electro-optic property of the substrate\nmaterial to change the cavities resonance wavelengths. By this means, we could\ndesign the logic gates and demonstrate a tunable range of 23nm for their\noperation wavelength. The quality factor and the response times of cavities\nremain constant in the tunable range of wavelength, approximately. The\nevaluated least ON to OFF logic-level contrast ratios for the XOR and XNOR\nlogic gates are 25.45dB and 22.61dB, respectively. The bit rates of the\nproposed logic gates can reach up to higher than 0.166 P(Peta)bps values.\nAccording to the high rapid response time with acceptable quality factor of the\nPhC cavities, the proposed optical logic gates can be considered as appropriate\ncandidates to be building blocks for applications such as optical integrated\ncircuits and optical processors with an ultrahigh speed of data flow.\n", "  We propose a modified definition for a quasi-parton distribution function\n(QPDF) with an equal-time correlator in the large momentum limit, whose two\npieces of space-like Wilson links are oriented in orthogonal directions. It is\nexplicitly shown at one-loop level that the linear divergence in the original\nQPDF with dipolar Wilson links, which complicates its matching to the standard\nlight-cone parton distribution function (LPDF), is removed. The LPDF can then\nbe extracted reliably from Euclidean lattice data for the QPDF with the\nnon-dipolar Wilson links.\n", "  Vertically bounded fingering double diffusive convection (DDC) is numerically\ninvestigated, focusing on the influences of different velocity boundary\nconditions, i.e. the no-slip condition which is inevitable in the lab-scale\nexperimental research, and the free-slip condition which is an approximation\nfor the interfaces in many natural environments, such as the oceans. For both\nboundary conditions the flow is dominated by fingers and the global responses\nfollow the same scaling laws, with enhanced prefactors for the free-slip cases.\nTherefore, the laboratory experiments with the no-slip boundaries serve as a\ngood model for the finger layers in the ocean. Moreover, in the free-slip case\nalthough the tangential shear stress is eliminated at the boundaries, the local\ndissipation rate in the near-wall region may exceed the value found in the\nno-slip cases, which is caused by the stronger vertical motions of fingers and\nsheet structures near the free-slip boundaries. This counter intuitive result\nmight be relevant for properly estimating and modelling the mixing and\nentrainment phenomena at free-surfaces and interfaces.\n", "  This work describes the implementation and application of a correlation\ndetermination method based on Self Organizing Maps and Bayesian Inference\n(SOMBI). SOMBI aims to automatically identify relations between different\nobserved parameters in unstructured cosmological or astrophysical surveys by\nautomatically identifying data clusters in high-dimensional datasets via the\nSelf Organizing Map neural network algorithm. Parameter relations are then\nrevealed by means of a Bayesian inference within respective identified data\nclusters. Specifically such relations are assumed to be parametrized as a\npolynomial of unknown order. The Bayesian approach results in a posterior\nprobability distribution function for respective polynomial coefficients. To\ndecide which polynomial order suffices to describe correlation structures in\ndata, we include a method for model selection, the Bayesian Information\nCriterion, to the analysis. The performance of the SOMBI algorithm is tested\nwith mock data. As illustration we also provide applications of our method to\ncosmological data. In particular, we present results of a correlation analysis\nbetween galaxy and AGN properties provided by the SDSS catalog with the cosmic\nlarge-scale-structure (LSS). The results indicate that the combined galaxy and\nLSS dataset indeed is clustered into several sub-samples of data with different\naverage properties (for example different stellar masses or web-type\nclassifications). The majority of data clusters appear to have a similar\ncorrelation structure between galaxy properties and the LSS. In particular we\nrevealed a positive and linear dependency between the stellar mass, the\nabsolute magnitude and the color of a galaxy with the corresponding cosmic\ndensity field. A remaining subset of data shows inverted correlations, which\nmight be an artifact of non-linear redshift distortions.\n", "  According to the gauge/gravity duality conjecture, the thermodynamics of\ngauge theory describing D-branes corresponds to that of black branes in\nsuperstring theory. We test this conjecture directly in the case of D0-branes\nby applying Monte Carlo methods to the corresponding gauge theory, which takes\nthe form of the BFSS matrix quantum mechanics. In particular, we take the\ncontinuum limit by extrapolating the UV cutoff to infinity. First we perform\nsimulations at large N so that string loop corrections can be neglected on the\ngravity side. Our results for the internal energy exhibit the temperature\ndependence consistent with the prediction including the \\alpha ' corrections.\nNext we perform simulations at small N but at lower temperature so that the\n\\alpha ' corrections can be neglected on the gravity side. Our results are\nconsistent with the prediction including the leading string loop correction,\nwhich suggests that the conjecture holds even at finite N.\n", "  Entanglement depth characterizes the minimal number of particles in a system\nthat are mutually entangled. For symmetric states, we show that there is a\ndichotomy for entanglement depth: an $N$-particle symmetric state is either\nfully separable, or fully entangled---the entanglement depth is either $1$ or\n$N$. This property is even stable under non-symmetric noise. We propose an\nexperimentally accessible method to detect entanglement depth in atomic\nensembles based on a bound on the particle number population of Dicke states,\nand demonstrate that the entanglement depth of some Dicke states, for example\nthe twin Fock state, is very stable even under a large arbitrary noise. Our\nobservation can be applied to atomic Bose-Einstein condensates to infer that\nthese systems can be highly entangled with the entanglement depth that is of\nthe order of the system size (i.e. several thousands of atoms).\n", "  We revisit a set of dark sector models, motivated by anomalies observed in\n$B$ decays and the muon anomalous magnetic moment, in the light of a recently\nreported diphoton excess around 750$\\,$GeV. Interpreting the excess as a scalar\nresonance associated with the symmetry breaking sector of a dark gauge group,\nwe show that a diphoton cross section of few fb can be accomodated, together\nwith anomalies in $R_K$ and $g_\\mu-2$ within a minimal dark sector model. The\nresulting prominent collider signatures are in the form of wide resonant\nsignals into top and muon pair final states below $\\sim1\\,$TeV. The model\nfurther predicts a dark matter candidate, yet with a significantly\nunderabundant relic density, unless produced by an appropriate non-thermal\nmechanism.\n", "  We study a semiconductor wire with strong spin-orbit coupling, which is\nproximity-coupled to a superconductor with chemical potential disorder. When\ntunneling at the semiconductor- superconductor interface is very weak, it is\nknown that disorder in the superconductor does not affect the induced\nsuperconductivity nor, therefore, the effective topological superconductivity\nthat emerges above a critical magnetic field. We demonstrate nonperturbatively\nhow this result breaks down with stronger proximity coupling by obtaining the\nlow-energy (i.e., subgap) excitation spectrum through direct numerical\ndiagonalization of an appropriate BdG hamiltonian. With strong proximity\ncoupling, we find that disorder in the parent superconductor suppresses the\n(non- topological) induced gap at zero magnetic field by disordering the\ninduced pair potential. In the topological superconducting phase at large\nmagnetic field, strong proximity coupling reduces the localization length of\nMajorana bound states, such that the induced disorder eliminates the\ntopological gap while bulk Majorana zero modes emerge, even for short wires.\n", "  We study symmetric and asymmetric optical multi-peak solitons on a continuous\nwave background in the femtosecond regime of a single-mode fiber. Key\ncharacteristics of such multi-peak solitons, as the formation mechanism,\npropagation stability, and shape-changing collisions, are revealed in detail.\nOur results show that this multi-peak (symmetric or asymmetric) mode could be\nregarded as a single pulse formed by a nonlinear superposition of a periodic\nwave and a single-peak (W-shaped or antidark) soliton. In particular, a phase\ndiagram for different types of nonlinear excitations on a continuous wave\nbackground including breather, rogue wave, W-shaped soliton, antidark soliton,\nperiodic wave, and multi-peak soliton is established based on the explicit link\nbetween exact nonlinear wave solution and modulation instability analysis.\nNumerical simulations are performed to confirm the propagation stability of the\nmulti-peak solitons with symmetric and asymmetric structures. Further, we\nunveil a remarkable shape-changing feature of asymmetric multi-peak solitons.\nIt is interesting that these shape-changing interactions occur not only in the\nintraspecific collision (soliton mutual collision) but also in the\ninterspecific interaction (soliton-breather interaction). Our results\ndemonstrate that each multi-peak soliton exhibits the coexistence of shape\nchange and conservation of the localized energy of light pulse against the\ncontinuous wave background.\n", "  We present a natural generalization of holographic entanglement entropy\nproposals beyond the scope of AdS/CFT by anchoring extremal surfaces to\nholographic screens. Holographic screens are a natural extension of the AdS\nboundary to arbitrary spacetimes and are preferred codimension 1 surfaces from\nthe viewpoint of the covariant entropy bound. A broad class of screens have a\nunique preferred foliation into codimension 2 surfaces called leaves. Our\nproposal is to find the areas of extremal surfaces achored to the boundaries of\nregions in leaves. We show that the properties of holographic screens are\nsufficient to prove, under generic conditions, that extremal surfaces anchored\nin this way always lie within a causal region associated with a given leaf.\nWithin this causal region, a maximin construction similar to that of Wall\nproves that our proposed quantity satisfies standard properties of entanglement\nentropy like strong subadditivity. We conjecture that our prescription computes\nentanglement entropies in quantum states that holographically define arbitrary\nspacetimes, including those in a cosmological setting with no obvious boundary\non which to anchor extremal surfaces.\n", "  Although organic heterojunctions can separate charges with near-unity\nefficiency and on a sub-picosecond timescale, the full details of the\ncharge-separation process remain unclear. In typical models, the Coulomb\nbinding between the electron and the hole can exceed the thermal energy\n$k_\\mathrm{B}T$ by an order of magnitude, suggesting that it is impossible for\nthe charges to separate before recombining. Here, we consider the entropic\ncontribution to charge separation in the presence of disorder and find that\neven modest amounts of disorder have a decisive effect, reducing the\ncharge-separation barrier to about $k_\\mathrm{B}T$ or eliminating it\naltogether. Therefore, the charges are usually not thermodynamically bound at\nall and could separate spontaneously if the kinetics otherwise allowed it. Our\nconclusion holds despite the worst-case assumption of localised, thermalised\ncarriers, and is only strengthened if mechanisms like delocalisation or `hot'\nstates are also present.\n", "  An accurate and consistent theory of phonons in metals requires that all\nlong-range Coulomb interactions between charged particles (electrons and ions)\nbe treated on equal footing. So far, all attempts to deal with this\nnon-perturbative system were relying on uncontrolled approximations in the\nabsence of small parameters. In this work, we develop the Diagrammatic Monte\nCarlo approach for a two-component Coulomb system that obtains the solution to\nthis fundamental problem in an approximation free way by computing vertex\ncorrections from higher-order skeleton graphs. The feasibility of the method is\ndemonstrated by calculating the spectrum of longitudinal acoustic phonons in a\nsimple cubic lattice, determining their sound velocity, and obtaining the\nphonon spectral densities by analytic continuation of the Matsubara Green's\nfunctions. Final results are checked against the lowest-order fully\nself-consistent GW-approximation in both adiabatic and non-adiabatic regimes.\n", "  Results obtained by various experiments show that the $D_{s0}^{\\ast}(2317)$\nand $D_{s1}(2460)$ mesons are very narrow states located below the $DK$ and\n$D^{\\ast}K$ thresholds, respectively. This is markedly in contrast with the\nexpectations of naive quark models and heavy quark symmetry. Motivated by a\nrecent lattice study which addresses the mass shifts of the $c\\bar{s}$ ground\nstates with quantum numbers $J^{P}=0^{+}$ ($D_{s0}^{\\ast}(2317)$) and\n$J^{P}=1^{+}$ ($D_{s1}(2460)$) due to their coupling with $S$-wave\n$D^{(\\ast)}K$ thresholds, we perform a similar analysis within a\nnonrelativistic constituent quark model in which quark-antiquark and\nmeson-meson degrees of freedom are incorporated. The quark model has been\napplied to a wide range of hadronic observables and thus the model parameters\nare completely constrained. The coupling between quark-antiquark and\nmeson-meson Fock components is done using a $^{3}P_{0}$ model in which its only\nfree parameter $\\gamma$ has been elucidated performing a global fit to the\ndecay widths of mesons that belong to different quark sectors, from light to\nheavy. We observe that the coupling of the $0^{+}$ $(1^{+})$ meson sector to\nthe $DK$ $(D^{\\ast}K)$ threshold is the key feature to simultaneously lower the\nmasses of the corresponding $D_{s0}^{\\ast}(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$ states\npredicted by the naive quark model and describe the $D_{s1}(2536)$ meson as the\n$1^{+}$ state of the $j_{q}^{P}=3/2^{+}$ doublet predicted by heavy quark\nsymmetry, reproducing its strong decay properties. Our calculation allows to\nintroduce the coupling with the $D$-wave $D^{\\ast}K$ channel and the\ncomputation of the probabilities associated with the different Fock components\nof the physical state.\n", "  We report the electronic structure, synthesis, and measurements of the\nmagnetic, transport, and thermal properties of the polycrystalline\nnoncentrosymmetric compound Re$_{6}$Zr. We observed a bulk superconducting\ntransition at temperature $T_{c}$ $\\sim$ 6.7 K, and measured the resistivity,\nheat capacity, thermal conductivity, and the London penetration depth below the\ntransition, as well as performed doping and pressure studies. From these\nmeasurements we extracted the critical field, and the superconducting\nparameters of Re$_{6}$Zr. Our measurements indicate a relatively weak to\nmoderate contribution from a triplet component to the order parameter, and\nfavor a full superconducting gap, although we cannot exclude the existence of\npoint nodes based on our data.\n", "  We study the dynamical properties of human communication through different\nchannels, i.e., short messages, phone calls, and emails, adopting techniques\nfrom neuronal spike train analysis in order to characterize the temporal\nfluctuations of successive inter-event times. We first measure the so-called\nlocal variation (LV) of incoming and outgoing event sequences of users, and\nfind that these in- and out- LV values are positively correlated for short\nmessages, and uncorrelated for phone calls and emails. Second, we analyze the\nresponse-time distribution after receiving a message to focus on the\ninput-output relationship in each of these channels. We find that the time\nscales and amplitudes of response are different between the three channels. To\nunderstand the impacts of the response-time distribution on the correlations\nbetween the LV values, we develop a point process model whose activity rate is\nmodulated by incoming and outgoing events. Numerical simulations of the model\nindicate that a quick response to incoming events and a refractory effect after\noutgoing events are key factors to reproduce the positive LV correlations.\n", "  In this paper, we explore static spherically symmetric wormhole solutions in\nthe framework of $n$-dimensional Einstein Gauss-Bonnet gravity. Our objective\nis to find out wormhole solutions that satisfy energy conditions. For this\npurpose, we consider two frameworks such as Gaussian distributed and Lorentzian\ndistributed non-commutative geometry. Taking into account constant redshift\nfunction, we obtain solutions in the form of shape function. The fifth and\nsixth dimensional solutions with positive as well as negative Gauss-Bonnet\ncoefficient are discussed. Also, we check the equilibrium condition for the\nwormhole solutions with the help of generalized Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov\nequation. It is interesting to mention here that we obtain fifth dimensional\nstable wormhole solutions in both distributions that satisfy the energy\nconditions.\n", "  To get a reliable ab-initio value for the magneto-crystalline anisotropy\n(MCA) energy of FePt, we employ the full-potential linearized augmented plane\nwave (FLAPW) method and the full-potential Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (KKR) Green\nfunction method. The MCA energies calculated by both methods are in a good\nagreement with each other. As the calculated MCA energy significantly differs\nfrom experiment, it is clear that many-body effects beyond the local density\napproximation are essential. It is not really important whether relativistic\neffects for FePt are accounted for by solving the full Dirac equation or\nwhether the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is treated as a correction to the\nscalar-relativistic Hamiltonian. From the analysis of the dependence of the MCA\nenergy on the magnetization angle and on the SOC strength it follows that the\nmain mechanism of MCA in FePt can be described within second order perturbation\ntheory. However, a distinct contribution not accountable for by second order\nperturbation theory is present as well.\n", "  In the nearly 60 years of spaceflight we have accomplished wonderful feats of\nexploration that have shown the incredible spirit of the human drive to explore\nand understand our universe. Yet in those 60 years we have barely left our\nsolar system with the Voyager 1 spacecraft launched in 1977 finally leaving the\nsolar system after 37 years of flight at a speed of 17 km/s or less than 0.006%\nthe speed of light. As remarkable as this is we will never reach even the\nnearest stars with our current propulsion technology in even 10 millennium. We\nhave to radically rethink our strategy or give up our dreams of reaching the\nstars, or wait for technology that does not currently exist. While we all dream\nof human spaceflight to the stars in a way romanticized in books and movies, it\nis not within our power to do so, nor it is clear that this is the path we\nshould choose. We posit a technological path forward, that while not simple, it\nis within our technological reach. We propose a roadmap to a program that will\nlead to sending relativistic probes to the nearest stars and will open up a\nvast array of possibilities of flight both within our solar system and far\nbeyond. Spacecraft from gram level complete spacecraft on a wafer (\"wafersats\")\nthat reach more than 1/4 c and reach the nearest star in 20 years to spacecraft\nwith masses more than 10^5 kg (100 tons) that can reach speeds of greater than\n1000 km/s. These systems can be propelled to speeds currently unimaginable with\nexisting propulsion technologies. To do so requires a fundamental change in our\nthinking of both propulsion and in many cases what a spacecraft is. In addition\nto larger spacecraft, some capable of transporting humans, we consider\nfunctional spacecraft on a wafer, including integrated optical communications,\nimaging systems, photon thrusters, power and sensors combined with directed\nenergy propulsion.\n", "  The recent non-empirical semi-local exchange functional of Armiento and\nK\\\"ummel, the AK13 [PRL 111, 036402 (2013)] incorporates a number of features\nreproduced by higher-order theory. The AK13 potential behaves analogously with\nthe discontinuous jump associated with the derivative discontinuity at integer\nparticle numbers. Recent works have established that AK13 gives a qualitatively\nimproved orbital description compared to other semi-local methods, and\nreproduces a band structure closer to higher-order theory. However, its\nenergies and energetics are inaccurate. The present work further investigates\nthe deficiency in energetics. In addition to AK13 results, we find that\napplying the local-density approximation (LDA) non-self-consistently on the\nconverged AK13 density gives very reasonable energetics with equilibrium\nlattice constants and bulk moduli well described across 14 systems. We also\nconfirm that the attractive orbital features of AK13 are retained even after\nfull structural relaxation. Hence, the deficient energetics cannot be a result\nof the AK13 orbitals having adversely affected the quality of the electron\ndensity compared to that of usual semi-local functionals; an improved orbital\ndescription and good energetics are not in opposition. We also prove that the\nnon-self-consistent scheme is equivalent to using a single external-potential\ndependent functional in an otherwise consistent KS-DFT scheme. Furthermore, our\nresults also demonstrate that, while an internally consistent KS functional is\npresently missing, non-self-consistent LDA on AK13 orbitals works as a\npractical non-empirical computational scheme to predict geometries, bulk\nmoduli, while retaining the band structure features of AK13 at the\ncomputational cost of semi-local DFT.\n", "  Supernova remnants (SNRs) are thought to be the primary sources of Galactic\nCosmic Rays (CRs). In the last few years, the wealth of gamma-ray data\ncollected by GeV and TeV instruments has provided important information about\nparticle energisation in these astrophysical sources, allowing us to make\nprogress in assessing their role as CR accelerators. In particular, the\nspectrum of the gamma-ray emission detected by AGILE and Fermi-LAT from the two\nmiddle aged Supernova Remnants (SNRs) W44 and IC443, has been proposed as a\nproof of CR acceleration in SNRs. Here we discuss the possibility that the\nradio and gamma-ray spectra from W44 may be explained in terms of\nre-acceleration and compression of Galactic CRs. The recent measurement of the\ninterstellar CR flux by Voyager I has been instrumental for our work, in that\nthe result of the reprocessing of CRs by the shock in W44 depends on the CR\nspectrum at energies that are precluded to terrestrial measurement due to solar\nmodulation. We introduce both CR protons and helium nuclei in our calculations,\nand secondary electrons produced in situ are compared with the flux of Galactic\nCR electrons reprocessed by the slow shock of this SNR.We find that the\nmulti-wavelength spectrum of W44 can be explained by reaccelerated particles\nwith no need of imposing any break on their distribution, but just a high\nenergy cut-off at the maximum energy the accelerator can provide.We also find\nthat a model including both re-acceleration and a very small fraction of\nfreshly accelerated particles may be more satisfactory on physical grounds\n", "  We demonstrate electrical magnetization switching and spin pumping in\nmagnetically doped Weyl semimetals. The Weyl semimetal is a new class of\ntopological semimetals, known to have nontrivial coupling between the charge\nand the magnetization due to the chiral anomaly. By solving the\nLandau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation for a multilayer structure of a Weyl\nsemimetal, an insulator and a metal whilst taking the charge-magnetization\ncoupling into account, magnetization dynamics is analyzed. It is shown that the\nmagnetization dynamics can be driven by the electric voltage. Consequently,\nswitching of the magnetization with a pulsed electric voltage can be achieved,\nas well as precession motion with an applied oscillating electric voltage. The\neffect requires only a short voltage pulse and may therefore be more\nenergetically efficient for us in spintronics devices compared to conventional\nspin transfer torque switching.\n", "  Thermodynamic behaviors in a quantum Brownian motion coupled to a classical\nheat bath is studied. We then define a heat operator by generalizing the\nstochastic energetics and show the energy balance (first law) and the upper\nbound of the expectation value of the heat operator (second law). We further\nfind that this upper bound depends on the memory effect induced by quantum\nfluctuations and hence the maximum extractable work can be qualitatively\nmodified in quantum thermodynamics.\n", "  In manifolds with spatial boundary, BRST formalism can be used to quantize\ngauge theories. We show that, in a $U(1)$ gauge theory, only a subset of all\nthe boundary conditions allowed by the self-adjointness of the Hamiltonian\npreserves BRST symmetry. Hence, the theory can be quantized using BRST\nformalism only when that subset of boundary conditions is considered. We also\nshow that for such boundary conditions, there exist fermionic states which are\nlocalized near the boundary.\n", "  We develop a self-consistent theory describing the spin and spatial electron\ndiffusion in the impurity band of doped semiconductors under the effect of a\nweak spin-orbit coupling. The resulting low-temperature spin-relaxation time\nand diffusion coefficient are calculated within different schemes of the\nself-consistent framework. The simplest of these schemes qualitatively\nreproduces previous phenomenological developments, while more elaborate\ncalculations provide corrections that approach the values obtained in numerical\nsimulations. The results are universal for zinc-blende semiconductors with\nelectron conductance in the impurity band, and thus they are able to account\nfor the measured spin-relaxation times of materials with very different\nphysical parameters. From a general point of view, our theory opens a new\nperspective for describing the hopping dynamics in random quantum networks.\n", "  We rederive relativistic hydrodynamics as a Lagrangian effective theory using\nthe doubled coordinates technique, allowing us to include dissipative terms. We\ninclude Navier-Stokes shear and bulk terms, as well as Israel-Stewart\nrelaxation time terms, within this formalism. We show how the inclusion of\nshear viscosity, and the requirement of a bounded energy-momentum \"vacuum\",\nforces the inclusion of the Israel-Stewart term into the theory, thereby\nproviding a justification for the origin and uniqueness of these terms.\n", "  We argue, based on typical properties of known solutions of\nstring/$M$-theory, that the lightest supersymmetric particle of the visible\nsector will not be stable. In other words, dark matter is {\\em not} a particle\nwith Standard Model quantum numbers, such as a WIMP. The argument is simple and\nbased on the typical occurrence of a) hidden sectors, b) interactions between\nthe Standard Model (visible) sector and these hidden sectors, and c) the lack\nof an argument against massive neutral hidden sector particles being lighter\nthan the lightest visible supersymmetric particle. These conclusions do not\nrely on arguments such as R-parity violation.\n", "  Two-dimensional (2D) metallic states formed on the ZnO(10$\\bar{1}$0) surface\nby hydrogen adsorption have been investigated using angle-resolved\nphotoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES). The observed metallic state is\ncharacterized by a peak-dip-hump structure at just below the Fermi level and a\nlong tail structure extending up to 600 meV in binding energy. The peak and\nhump positions are separated by about 70 meV, a value close to the excitation\nenergy of longitudinal optical (LO) phonons. Spectral functions formulated on\nthe basis of the 2D electron-phonon coupling well reproduce the ARPES intensity\ndistribution of the metallic states. This spectral analysis suggests that the\n2D electrons accumulated on the ZnO surface couple to the LO phonons and that\nthis coupling is the origin of the anomalous long tail. Our results indicate\nthat the 2D electrons at the ZnO surface are described as the electron liquid\nmodel.\n", "  Local diffusion coefficients in disordered materials such as living cells are\nhighly heterogeneous. Quenched disorder is utilized substantially to study such\ncomplex systems, whereas its analytical treatment is difficult to handle. We\nconsider finite systems with quenched disorder in order to investigate the\neffects of sample disorder fluctuations and confinement on single-particle\ndiffusivity. While the system is ergodic in a single disorder realization, the\ntime-averaged mean squared displacement depends on the disorder, i.e., the\nsystem is ergodic but non-self-averaging. We find that the inverse Levy\ndistribution is a universal distribution for diffusivity in the sense that it\ncan be applied for arbitrary dimensions. Quantifying the degree of the\nnon-self-averaging effect, we show that fluctuations of single-particle\ndiffusivity far exceed the corresponding annealed theory and also find\nconfinement effects. The relevance for experimental situations is also\ndiscussed.\n", "  We discuss the determination of the strong coupling\n$\\alpha_\\mathrm{\\overline{MS}}^{}(m_\\mathrm{Z})$ or equivalently the QCD\n$\\Lambda$-parameter. Its determination requires the use of perturbation theory\nin $\\alpha_s(\\mu)$ in some scheme, $s$, and at some energy scale $\\mu$. The\nhigher the scale $\\mu$ the more accurate perturbation theory becomes, owing to\nasymptotic freedom. As one step in our computation of the $\\Lambda$-parameter\nin three-flavor QCD, we perform lattice computations in a scheme which allows\nus to non-perturbatively reach very high energies, corresponding to $\\alpha_s =\n0.1$ and below. We find that (continuum) perturbation theory is very accurate\nthere, yielding a three percent error in the $\\Lambda$-parameter, while data\naround $\\alpha_s \\approx 0.2$ is clearly insufficient to quote such a\nprecision. It is important to realize that these findings are expected to be\ngeneric, as our scheme has advantageous properties regarding the applicability\nof perturbation theory.\n", "  The Dark Sector is described by an additional barotropic fluid which evolves\nadiabatically during the universe's history and whose adiabatic exponent\n$\\gamma$ is derived from the standard definitions of specific heats. Although\nin general $\\gamma$ is a function of the redshift, the Hubble parameter and its\nderivatives, we find that our assumptions lead necessarily to solutions with\n$\\gamma = $ constant in a FLRW universe. The adiabatic fluid acts effectively\nas the sum of two distinct components, one evolving like non-relativistic\nmatter and the other depending on the value of the adiabatic index. This makes\nthe model particularly interesting as a way of simultaneously explaining the\nnature of both Dark Energy and Dark Matter, at least at the level of the\nbackground cosmology. The $\\Lambda$CDM model is included in this family of\ntheories when $\\gamma = 0$. We fit our model to SNIa, $H(z)$ and BAO data,\ndiscussing the model selection criteria. The implications for the\nearly-universe and the growth of small perturbations in this model are also\ndiscussed.\n", "  We study shear banding in soft glassy materials subject to a large amplitude\noscillatory shear flow (LAOS). By numerical simulations of the widely used soft\nglassy rheology model, supplemented by more general physical arguments, we\ndemonstrate strong banding over an extensive range of amplitudes and\nfrequencies of the imposed shear rate\n$\\dot{\\gamma}(t)=\\dot{\\gamma}_0\\cos(\\omega t)$, even in materials that do not\npermit banding as their steady state response to a steady imposed shear flow\n$\\dot{\\gamma}=\\dot{\\gamma}_0=$const. Highly counterintuitively, banding\npersists in LAOS even in the limit of zero frequency $\\omega\\to 0$, where one\nmight a priori have expected a homogeneous flow response (consistent with the\nrequirement of homogeneous flow for a strictly zero frequency steady imposed\nshear flow). We explain this finding in terms of an alternating competition\nwithin each cycle between glassy aging and flow rejuvenation. Our predictions\nhave far-reaching implications for the flow behavior of aging yield stress\nfluids, suggesting a generic expectation of shear banding in flows of even\narbitrarily slow time variation.\n", "  We propose a new relativistic Lorentz-invariant spin-noncommutative algebra.\nUsing the Weyl ordering of noncommutative position operators, we build an\nanalogue of the Moyal-Groenewald product for the proposed algebra. The Lagrange\nfunction of an electromagnetic field in the space with spin noncommutativity is\nconstructed. In such a space electromagnetic field becomes non-abelian. A gauge\ntransformation law of this field is also obtained. Exact nonlinear field\nequations of noncommutative electromagnetic field are derived from the least\naction principle. Within the perturbative approach we consider field of a point\ncharge in a constant magnetic field and interaction of two plane waves. An\nexact solution of a plane wave propagation in a constant magnetic and electric\nfields is found.\n", "  We present a model with $A_4 \\times U(1)_{PQ}$ lepton flavor symmetry which\nexplains the origin of the lepton flavor structure and also solves the strong\n$CP$ problem. Standard model gauge singlet fields, so-called \"flavons\", charged\nunder the $A_4 \\times U(1)_{PQ}$ symmetry are introduced and are coupled with\nthe lepton and the Higgs sectors. The flavon vacuum expectation values (VEVs)\ntrigger spontaneous breaking of the $A_4 \\times U(1)_{PQ}$ symmetry. The\nbreaking pattern of the $A_4$ accounts for the tri-bimaximal neutrino mixing\nand the deviation from it due to the non-zero $\\theta_{13}$ angle, and the\nbreaking of the $U(1)_{PQ}$ gives rise to a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson,\naxion, whose VEV cancels the QCD $\\theta$ term. We investigate the breaking of\nthe $A_4 \\times U(1)_{PQ}$ symmetry through an analysis on the scalar potential\nand further discuss the properties of the axion in the model, including its\ndecay constant, mass and coupling with photons. It is shown that the axion\ndecay constant is related with the right-handed neutrino mass through the\nflavon VEVs. Experimental constraints on the axion and their implications are\nalso studied.\n", "  A class of Polyakov-loop-modified Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) models have been\nused to support a conjecture that numerical simulations of lattice-regularized\nquantum chromodynamics (QCD) defined with a chiral chemical potential can\nprovide information about the existence and location of a critical endpoint in\nthe QCD phase diagram drawn in the plane spanned by baryon chemical potential\nand temperature. That conjecture is challenged by conflicts between the model\nresults and analyses of the same problem using simulations of\nlattice-regularized QCD (lQCD) and well-constrained Dyson-Schwinger equation\n(DSE) studies. We find the conflict is resolved in favor of the lQCD and DSE\npredictions when both a physically-motivated regularization is employed to\nsuppress the contribution of high-momentum quark modes in the definition of the\neffective potential connected with the PNJL models and the four-fermion\ncoupling in those models does not react strongly to changes in the mean-field\nthat is assumed to mock-up Polyakov loop dynamics. With the lQCD and DSE\npredictions thus confirmed, it seems unlikely that simulations of lQCD with\n$\\mu_5>0$ can shed any light on a critical endpoint in the regular QCD phase\ndiagram.\n", "  We construct supersymmetric irregular vertex operators of arbitrary rank,\nappearing in the colliding limit of primary fields. We find that the structure\nof the supersymmetric irregular vertices differs significantly from the bosonic\ncase: upon supersymmetrization, the irregular operators are no longer the\neigenstates of positive Virasoro and $W_N$ generators but block-diagonalize\nthem. We relate the block-diagonal structure of the irregular vertices to\ncontributions of the Ramond sector to the colliding limit.\n", "  Near equilibrium, where all currents of a system vanish on average, the\nfluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR) connects a current's spontaneous\nfluctuations with its response to perturbations of the conjugate thermodynamic\nforce. Out of equilibrium, fluctuation-response relations generally involve\nadditional nondissipative contributions. Here, in the framework of stochastic\nthermodynamics, we show that an equilibrium-like FDR holds for internally\nequilibrated currents, if the perturbing conjugate force only affects the\nmicroscopic transitions that contribute to the current. We discuss the physical\nrequirements for the validity of our result and apply it to nano-sized\nelectronic devices.\n", "  For a general thermodynamic system described as a Markov process, we prove a\ngeneral lower bound for dissipation in terms of the square of the heat current,\nthus establishing that nonvanishing current inevitably implies dissipation.\nThis leads to a universal trade-off relation between efficiency and power, with\nwhich we rigorously prove that a heat engine with nonvanishing power never\nattains the Carnot efficiency. Our theory applies to systems arbitrarily far\nfrom equilibrium, and does not assume any specific symmetry of the model.\n", "  We describe an experimentally feasible protocol for performing a variant of\nthe quantum delayed-choice experiment with massive objects. In this scheme, a\nsingle nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond driven by microwave fields is\ndispersively coupled to a massive mechanical resonator. A double-pulse Ramsey\ninterferometer can be implemented with the spin-mechanical setup, where the\nsecond Ramsey microwave pulse drives the spin conditioned on the number states\nof the resonator. The probability for finding the NV center in definite spin\nstates exhibits interference fringes when the mechanical resonator is prepared\nin a specific number state. On the other hand, the interference is destroyed if\nthe mechanical resonator stays in some other number states. The wavelike and\nparticlelike behavior of the NV spin can be superposed by preparing the\nmechanical resonator in a superposition of two distinct number states. Thus a\nquantum version of Wheeler's delayed-choice experiment could be implemented,\nallowing of fundamental tests of quantum mechanics on a macroscopic scale.\n", "  We use supersymmetry to calculate exact spectral densities for a class of\ncomplex random matrix models having the form $M=S+LXR$, where $X$ is a random\nnoise part $X$ and $S,L,R$ are fixed structure parts. This is a certain version\nof the \"external field\" random matrix models. We found two-fold integral\nformulas for arbitrary structural matrices. We investigate some special cases\nin detail and carry out numerical simulations. The presence or absence of a\nnormality condition on $S$ leads to a qualitatively different behavior of the\neigenvalue densities.\n", "  Semiconductor quantum-dot cavity systems are promising sources for\nsolid-state based on-demand generation of single photons for quantum\ncommunication. Commonly, the spectral characteristics of the emitted single\nphoton are fixed by system properties such as electronic transition energies\nand spectral properties of the cavity. In the present work we study\nsingle-photon generation from the quantum-dot biexciton through a partly\nstimulated non-degenerate two-photon emission. We show that frequency and\nlinewidth of the single photon can be fully controlled by the stimulating laser\npulse, ultimately allowing for efficient all-optical spectral shaping of the\nsingle photon.\n", "  The large anisotropy in the electronic properties across a structural\ntransition in several correlated systems has been identified as the key\nmanifestation of electronic nematic order, breaking rotational symmetry. In\nthis context, FeSe is attracting tremendous interest, since electronic\nnematicity develops over a wide range of temperatures, allowing accurate\nexperimental investigation. Here we combine angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy and theoretical calculations based on a realistic multi-orbital\nmodel to unveil the microscopic mechanism responsible for the evolution of the\nelectronic structure of FeSe across the nematic transition. We show that the\nself-energy corrections due to the exchange of spin fluctuations between hole\nand electron pockets are responsible for an orbital-dependent shrinking of the\nFermi Surface that affects mainly the $xz/yz$ parts of the Fermi surface. This\nresult is consistent with our experimental observation of the Fermi Surface in\nthe high-temperature tetragonal phase, that includes the $xy$ electron sheet\nthat was not clearly resolved before. In the low-temperature nematic phase, we\nexperimentally confirm the appearance of a large ($\\sim$ 50meV) $xz/yz$\nsplittings. It can be well reproduced in our model by assuming a moderate\nsplitting between spin fluctuations along the $x$ and $y$ crystallographic\ndirections. Our mechanism shows how the full entanglement between orbital and\nspin degrees of freedom can make a spin-driven nematic transition equivalent to\nan effective orbital order.\n", "  We propose an improved methodology to constrain spatial variations of the\nfine structure constant using clusters of galaxies. We use the {\\it Planck}\n2013 data to measure the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect at the location of\n618 X-ray selected clusters. We then use a Monte Carlo Markov Chain algorithm\nto obtain the temperature of the Cosmic Microwave Background at the location of\neach galaxy cluster. When fitting three different phenomenological\nparameterizations allowing for monopole and dipole amplitudes in the value of\nthe fine structure constant we improve the results of earlier analysis\ninvolving clusters and the CMB power spectrum, and we also found that the\nbest-fit direction of a hypothetical dipole is compatible with the direction of\nother known anomalies. Although the constraining power of our current datasets\ndo not allow us to test the indications of a fine-structure constant dipole\nobtained though high-resolution optical/UV spectroscopy, our results do\nhighlight that clusters of galaxies will be a very powerful tool to probe\nfundamental physics at low redshift.\n", "  We compare the effect of single qubit incoherent and coherent errors on the\nlogical error rate of the Steane [[7,1,3]] quantum error correction code by\nperforming an exact full-density-matrix simulation of an error correction step.\nWe find that the effective 1-qubit process matrix at the logical level reveals\nthe key differences between the error models and provides insight into why the\nPauli twirling approximation is a good approximation for incoherent errors and\na poor approximation for coherent ones. Approximate channels composed of\nClifford operations and Pauli measurement operators that are pessimistic at the\nphysical level result in pessimistic error rates at the logical level. In\naddition, we observe that the pseudo-threshold can differ by a factor of five\ndepending on whether the error is calculated using the fidelity or the\ndistance.\n", "  The no-enclave percolation (NEP) model introduced recently by Sheinman et al.\ncan be mapped to a problem of holes within a standard percolation backbone, and\nnumerical measurements of these holes gives the size-distribution exponent\n$\\tau = 1.82(1)$ of the NEP model. An argument is given that $\\tau=1 + d_B/2\n\\approx 1.822$ where $d_B$ is the backbone dimension. On the other hand, a\nmodel of simple holes within a percolation cluster implies $\\tau = 1 + d_f/2 =\n187/96 \\approx 1.948$, where $d_f$ is the fractal dimension of the cluster, and\nthis value is consistent with Sheinman et al.'s experimental results of gel\ncollapse which gives $\\tau = 1.91(6)$. Both models yield a discontinuous\nmaximum hole size at $p_c$, signifying explosive percolation behavior. At\n$p_c$, the largest hole fills exactly half the system, due to symmetry.\nExtensive numerical simulations confirm our results.\n", "  We obtain predictions for the Majorana phases $\\alpha_{21}/2$ and\n$\\alpha_{31}/2$ of the $3\\times 3$ unitary neutrino mixing matrix $U =\nU_e^{\\dagger} \\, U_{\\nu}$, $U_e$ and $U_{\\nu}$ being the $3\\times 3$ unitary\nmatrices resulting from the diagonalisation of the charged lepton and neutrino\nMajorana mass matrices, respectively. We focus on forms of $U_e$ and $U_{\\nu}$\npermitting to express $\\alpha_{21}/2$ and $\\alpha_{31}/2$ in terms of the Dirac\nphase $\\delta$ and the three neutrino mixing angles of the standard\nparametrisation of $U$, and the angles and the two Majorana-like phases\n$\\xi_{21}/2$ and $\\xi_{31}/2$ present, in general, in $U_{\\nu}$. The concrete\nforms of $U_{\\nu}$ considered are fixed by, or associated with, symmetries\n(tri-bimaximal, bimaximal, etc.), so that the angles in $U_{\\nu}$ are fixed.\nFor each of these forms and forms of $U_e$ that allow to reproduce the measured\nvalues of the three neutrino mixing angles $\\theta_{12}$, $\\theta_{23}$ and\n$\\theta_{13}$, we derive predictions for phase differences $(\\alpha_{21}/2 -\n\\xi_{21}/2)$, $(\\alpha_{31}/2 - \\xi_{31}/2)$, etc., which are completely\ndetermined by the values of the mixing angles. We show that the requirement of\ngeneralised CP invariance of the neutrino Majorana mass term implies $\\xi_{21}\n= 0$ or $\\pi$ and $\\xi_{31} = 0$ or $\\pi$. For these values of $\\xi_{21}$ and\n$\\xi_{31}$ and the best fit values of $\\theta_{12}$, $\\theta_{23}$ and\n$\\theta_{13}$, we present predictions for the effective Majorana mass in\nneutrinoless double beta decay for both neutrino mass spectra with normal and\ninverted ordering.\n", "  In elementary particle physics the philosophy of virtual particles is widely\nused. We use this philosophy to obtain the famous inverse square law of\nclassical physics. We define a formal model without fields or forces, but with\nvirtual particle - information transmitter. This formal model admits very\nsimple (school level) interpretation with two classical particles and one\nvirtual. Then we prove (in a mathematically rigorous way) that the trajectories\nin our model converge to standard Newtonian trajectories of classical physics.\n", "  Magnetic topological insulators such as Cr-doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3 provide a\nplatform for the realization of versatile time-reversal symmetry-breaking\nphysics. By constructing heterostructures with N\\'eel order in an\nantiferromagnetic CrSb and magnetic topological order in Cr-doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3,\nwe realize emergent interfacial magnetic phenomena which can be tailored\nthrough artificial structural engineering. Through deliberate geometrical\ndesign of heterostructures and superlattices, we demonstrate the use of\nantiferromagnetic exchange coupling in manipulating the magnetic properties of\nthe topological surface massive Dirac fermions. This work provides a new\nframework on integrating topological insulators with antiferromagnetic\nmaterials and unveils new avenues towards dissipationless topological\nantiferromagnetic spintronics.\n", "  In this work, we extend the so-called typicality approach, originally\nformulated in statistical mechanics contexts, to $SU(2)$-invariant spin-network\nstates. Our results do not depend on the physical interpretation of the spin\nnetwork; however, they are mainly motivated by the fact that spin-network\nstates can describe states of quantum geometry, providing a gauge-invariant\nbasis for the kinematical Hilbert space of several background-independent\napproaches to quantum gravity. The first result is, by itself, the existence of\na regime in which we show the emergence of a typical state. We interpret this\nas the proof that in that regime there are certain (local) properties of\nquantum geometry which are \"universal\". Such a set of properties is heralded by\nthe typical state, of which we give the explicit form. This is our second\nresult. In the end, we study some interesting properties of the typical state,\nproving that the area law for the entropy of a surface must be satisfied at the\nlocal level, up to logarithmic corrections which we are able to bound.\n", "  The dynamics of frictional interfaces play an important role in many physical\nsystems spanning a broad range of scales. It is well-known that frictional\ninterfaces separating two dissimilar materials couple interfacial slip and\nnormal stress variations, a coupling that has major implications on their\nstability, failure mechanism and rupture directionality. In contrast,\ninterfaces separating identical materials are traditionally assumed not to\nfeature such a coupling due to symmetry considerations. We show, combining\ntheory and experiments, that interfaces which separate bodies made of\nmacroscopically identical materials, but lack geometrical reflection symmetry,\ngenerically feature such a coupling. We discuss two applications of this novel\nfeature. First, we show that it accounts for a distinct, and previously\nunexplained, experimentally observed weakening effect in frictional cracks.\nSecond, we demonstrate that it can destabilize frictional sliding which is\notherwise stable. The emerging framework is expected to find applications in a\nbroad range of systems.\n", "  We present a unified explanation for the $B$-decay anomalies in\n$R_{D^{(\\ast)}}$ and $R_{K}$ together with the anomalous muon magnetic moment,\nconsistent with the constraints from the current measurements of leptonic decay\nrates and $D^0-\\bar{D}^0$, $B_{s}^0-\\bar{B}_{s}^0$ mixings, within the\nframework of a minimal left-right symmetric gauge theory motivated by one of\nthe low-energy subgroups of $E_{6}$ naturally accommodating leptoquarks.\n", "  We carry out a detailed study of multi-Higgs production processes in the\ngluon fusion channel in the high energy regime relevant to Future Circular\nhadron colliders and in the high-Higgs-multiplicity limit (> 20). Our results\nare based on the computation of the leading polygons - the triangles, boxes,\npentagons and hexagons - to the scattering processes, further combined with the\nsubsequent branchings to reach high final state multiplicities. The factorial\ngrowth of the number of diagrams leads to an exponential enhancement of such\nlarge multiplicity cross-sections and, ultimately, in breaking of\nperturbativity. We find that the characteristic energy and multiplicity scales\nwhere these perturbative rates become highly enhanced and grow with increasing\nenergy are within the 100 TeV regime with of the order of 130 Higgses (or more)\nin the final state. We also show that already for a 50 TeV hadron collider the\nperturbative cross-sections for 140 bosons are at picobarn level.\n", "  We explicitly show perturbative gauge fixing independence of the tunneling\nrate to a stable radiatively induced vacuum in the abelian Higgs model. We work\nwith a class of $R_\\xi$ gauges in the presence of both dimensionless and\ndimensionful gauge fixing parameters. We show that Nielsen identities survive\nthe inclusion of higher order oparators and compute the tunnelling rate to the\nvacua modified by the nonrenormalisable operators in a gauge invariant manner.\nWe also discuss implications of this method for the complete Standard Model.\n", "  We present the nuclear transverse momentum broadening for Drell-Yan lepton\npair production in p+A collisions at next-to-leading order (NLO) in powers of\nstrong coupling constant $\\alpha_s$. We verify that the transverse momentum\nweighted differential cross section in NLO perturbative QCD (pQCD) at twist-4\ncan be factorized into the convolution of parton distribution function of an\nactive parton in the projectile proton, a twist-4 multiparton correlation\nfunction of the target nucleus, and perturbatively calculable hard coefficient\nfunction. We identify a QCD evolution equation for such a twist-4 nuclear\ngluon-quark correlation function, and verify its universality -- its process\nindependence. This finding demonstrates the prediction power of pQCD\nfactorization approach for studying parton multiple scattering in nuclear\nmedium.\n", "  Keeping a quantum system in a given instantaneous eigenstate is a control\nproblem with numerous applications, e.g., in quantum information processing.\nThe problem is even more challenging in the setting of open quantum systems,\nwhere environment-mediated transitions introduce additional decoherence\nchannels. Adiabatic passage is a well established solution, but requires a\nsufficiently slow evolution time that is dictated by the adiabatic theorem.\nHere we develop a systematic projection theory formulation for the\ntransitionless evolution of general open quantum systems described by\ntime-local master equations. We derive a time-convolutionless dynamical\nequation for the target instantaneous eigenstate of a given time-dependent\nHamiltonian. A transitionless dynamics then arises in terms of a competition\nbetween the average Hamiltonian gap and the decoherence rate, which implies\noptimal adiabaticity timescales. We show how eigenstate tracking can be\naccomplished via control pulses, without explicitly incorporating\ncounter-diabatic driving, thus offering an alternative route to shortcuts to\nadiabaticity. We examine rectangular pulses, chaotic signals, and white noise,\nand find that, remarkably, the effectiveness of eigenstate tracking hardly\ndepends on the details of the control functions. In all cases the control\nprotocol keeps the system in the desired instantaneous eigenstate throughout\nthe entire evolution, along an accelerated adiabatic path.\n", "  It is shown that transient spin-spin correlations in one-dimensional spin\nS>>1 chain can be enhanced for initially factorized and individually squeezed\nspin states. Such correlation transfer form \"internal\" to \"external\" degrees of\nfreedom can be well described by using a semiclassical phase-space approach.\n", "  We study the relaxation of a 2D ultracold Bose-gas from a nonequilibrium\ninitial state containing vortex excitations in experimentally realizable square\nand rectangular traps. We show that the subsystem of vortex gas excitations\nresults in the spontaneous emergence of a coherent superfluid flow with a\nnon-zero coarse-grained vorticity field. The streamfunction of this emergent\nquasi-classical 2D flow is governed by a Boltzmann-Poisson equation. This\nequation reveals that maximum entropy states of a neutral vortex gas that\ndescribe the spectral condensation of energy can be classified into types of\nflow depending on whether or not the flow spontaneously acquires angular\nmomentum. Numerical simulations of a neutral point vortex model and a Bose gas\ngoverned by the 2D Gross-Pitaevskii equation in a square reveal that a large\nscale monopole flow field with net angular momentum emerges that is consistent\nwith predictions of the Boltzmann-Poisson equation. The results allow us to\ncharacterise the spectral energy condensate in a 2D quantum fluid that bears\nstriking similarity with similar flows observed in experiments of 2D classical\nturbulence. By deforming the square into a rectangular region, the resulting\nmaximum entropy state switches to a dipolar flow field with zero net angular\nmomentum.\n", "  We use a combination of experimental techniques to demonstrate a general\noccurrence of spin-orbit interaction (SOI) in graphene on transition metal\ndichalcogenide (TMD) substrates. Our measurements indicate that SOI is\nultra-strong and extremely robust, despite it being merely\ninterfacially-induced, with neither graphene nor the TMD substrates changing\ntheir structure. This is found to be the case irrespective of the TMD material\nused, of the transport regime, of the carrier type in the graphene band, and of\nthe thickness of the graphene multilayer. Specifically, we perform weak\nantilocalization measurements as the simplest and most general diagnostic of\nSOI, and show that the spin relaxation time is very short in all cases\nregardless of the elastic scattering time. Such a short spin-relaxation time\nstrongly suggests that the SOI originates from a modification of graphene band\nstructure. We confirmed this expectation by measuring a gate-dependent beating,\nand a corresponding frequency splitting, in the low-field Shubnikov-de Haas\nmagneto-resistance oscillations in high quality bilayer graphene on WSe$_2$.\nThese measurements provide an unambiguous diagnostic of a SOI-induced splitting\nin the electronic band structure, and their analysis allows us to determine the\nSOI coupling constants for the Rashba term and the so-called spin-valley\ncoupling term, i.e., the terms that were recently predicted theoretically for\ninterface-induced SOI in graphene. The magnitude of the SOI splitting is found\nto be on the order of 10 meV, more than 100 times greater than the SOI\nintrinsic to graphene. Both the band character of the interfacially induced\nSOI, as well as its robustness and large magnitude make graphene-on-TMD a\npromising system to realize and explore a variety of spin-dependent transport\nphenomena, such as, in particular, spin-Hall and valley-Hall topological\ninsulating states.\n", "  We propose an experiment to detect and characterize the analog Hawking\nradiation in an analog model of gravity consisting of a flowing\nexciton-polariton condensate. Under a suitably designed coherent pump\nconfiguration, the condensate features an acoustic event horizon for sound\nwaves that at the semiclassical level is equivalent to an astrophysical black\nhole horizon. We show that a continuous-wave pump-and-probe spectroscopy\nexperiment allows to measure the analog Hawking temperature from the dependence\nof the stimulated Hawking effect on the pump-probe detuning. We anticipate the\nappearance of an emergent resonant cavity for sound waves between the pump beam\nand the horizon, which results in marked oscillations on top of an overall\nexponential frequency dependence. We finally analyze the spatial correlation\nfunction of density fluctuations and identify the hallmark features of the\ncorrelated pairs of Bogoliubov excitations created by the spontaneous Hawking\nprocess, as well as novel signatures characterizing the emergent cavity.\n", "  We present simulations of the 1-dimensional Oslo rice pile model in which the\ncritical height at each site is randomly reset after each toppling. We use the\nfact that the stationary state of this sandpile model is hyperuniform to reach\nsystem of sizes $> 10^7$. Most previous simulations were seriously flawed by\nimportant finite size corrections. We find that all critical exponents have\nvalues consistent with simple rationals: $\\nu=4/3$ for the correlation length\nexponent, $D =9/4$ for the fractal dimension of avalanche clusters, and $z=10/7\n$ for the dynamical exponent. In addition we relate the hyperuniformity\nexponent to the correlation length exponent $\\nu$. Finally we discuss the\nrelationship with the quenched Edwards-Wilkinson (qEW) model, where we find in\nparticular that the local roughness exponent is $\\alpha_{\\rm loc} = 1$.\n", "  A supramassive, strongly-magnetized millisecond neutron star (NS) has been\nproposed to be the candidate central engine of at least some short gamma-ray\nbursts (SGRBs), based on the \"internal plateau\" commonly observed in the early\nX-ray afterglow. While a previous analysis shows a qualitative consistency\nbetween this suggestion and the Swift SGRB data, the distribution of observed\nbreak time $t_b$ is much narrower than the distribution of the collapse time of\nsupramassive NSs for the several NS equations-of-state (EoSs) investigated. In\nthis paper, we study four recently-constructed \"unified\" NS EoSs, as well as\nthree developed strange quark star (QS) EoSs within the new confinement\ndensity-dependent mass model. All the EoSs chosen here satisfy the recent\nobservational constraints of the two massive pulsars whose masses are precisely\nmeasured. We construct sequences of rigidly rotating NS/QS configurations with\nincreasing spinning frequency $f$, from non-rotating ($f = 0$) to the Keplerian\nfrequency ($f = f_{\\rm K}$), and provide convenient analytical parametrizations\nof the results. Assuming that the cosmological NS-NS merger systems have the\nsame mass distribution as the Galactic NS-NS systems, we demonstrate that all\nexcept the BCPM NS EoS can reproduce the current $22\\%$ supramassive NS/QS\nfraction constraint as derived from the SGRB data. We simultaneously simulate\nthe observed quantities (the break time $t_b$, the break time luminosity $L_b$\nand the total energy in the electromagnetic channel $E_{\\rm total}$) of SGRBs,\nand find that while equally well reproducing other observational constraints,\nQS EoSs predict a much narrower $t_b$ distribution than that of the NS EoSs,\nbetter matching the data. We therefore suggest that the post-merger product of\nNS-NS mergers might be fast-rotating supramassive QSs rather than NSs.\n", "  Since the release of the Hipparcos catalog in 1997, the distance to the\nPleiades open cluster has been heavily debated. The distance obtained from\nHipparcos and those by alternative methods differ by 10 to 15 %. As accurate\nstellar distances are key to understanding stellar structure and evolution,\nthis dilemma puts the validity of stellar evolution models into question. Using\nour model-independent method to determine parallaxes based on twin stars, we\nreport individual parallaxes of 15 FGK type stars in the Pleiades in\nanticipation of the astrometric mission Gaia. These parallaxes give a mean\ncluster parallax of $7.42\\pm0.09~\\mathrm{mas}$ corresponding to a mean cluster\ndistance of ${ 134.8\\pm 1.7~\\mathrm{pc}}$. This value agrees with the current\nresults obtained from stellar evolution models.\n", "  The extraction of hadron matrix elements in lattice QCD using the standard\ntwo- and three-point correlator functions demands careful attention to\nsystematic uncertainties. One of the most commonly studied sources of\nsystematic error is contamination from excited states. We apply the variational\nmethod to calculate the axial vector current $g_{A}$, the scalar current\n$g_{S}$ and the quark momentum fraction $\\left<x\\right>$ of the nucleon and we\ncompare the results to the more commonly used summation and two-exponential fit\nmethods. The results demonstrate that the variational approach offers a more\nefficient and robust method for the determination of nucleon matrix elements.\n", "  The mapping between a classical length and inverse temperature as imaginary\ntime provides a direct equivalence between the Casimir force of a classical\nsystem in $D$ dimensions and internal energy of a quantum system in\n$d$$=$$D$$-$$1$ dimensions. The scaling functions of the critical Casimir force\nof the classical system with periodic boundaries thus emerge from the analysis\nof the symmetry related quantum critical point. We show that both\nnon-perturbative renormalization group and quantum Monte Carlo analysis of\nquantum critical points provide quantitative estimates for the critical Casimir\nforce in the corresponding classical model, giving access to widely different\naspect ratios for the geometry of confined systems. In the light of these\nresults we propose protocols for the experimental realization of critical\nCasimir forces for periodic boundaries through state-of-the-art cold-atom and\nsolid-state experiments.\n", "  In this paper, we have systematically studied the single hole problem in\ntwo-leg Hubbard and $t$-$J$ ladders by large-scale density-matrix\nrenormalization group calculations. We found that the doped hole in both models\nbehaves similarly with each other while the three-site correlated hopping term\nis not important in determining the ground state properties. For more insights,\nwe have also calculated the elementary excitations, i.e., the energy gaps to\nthe excited states of the system. In the strong rung limit, we found that the\ndoped hole behaves as a Bloch quasiparticle in both systems where the spin and\ncharge of the doped hole are tightly bound together. In the isotropic limit,\nwhile the hole still behaves like a quasiparticle in the long-wavelength limit,\nits spin and charge components are only loosely bound together with a\nnontrivial mutual statistics inside the quasiparticle. Our results show that\nthis mutual statistics can lead to an important residual effect which\ndramatically changes the local structure of the ground state wavefunction.\n", "  Analyzing the dimension of an unknown quantum system in a device-independent\nmanner, i.e., using only the measurement statistics, is a fundamental task in\nquantum physics and quantum information theory. In this paper, we consider this\nproblem in the prepare-and-measure scenario. Specifically, we provide a lower\nbound on the dimension of the prepared quantum systems which is a function that\nonly depends on the measurement statistics. Furthermore, we show that our bound\nperforms well on several examples. {In particular}, we show that our bound\nprovides new insights into the notion of dimension witness, and we also use it\nto show that the sets of restricted-dimensional prepare-and-measure\ncorrelations are not always convex.\n", "  We address the astrophysical imaging of a family of deformed Kerr black holes\n(BHs). These are stationary, asymptotically flat black hole (BH) spacetimes,\nthat are solutions of General Relativity minimally coupled to a massive,\ncomplex scalar field: Kerr BHs with scalar hair (KBHsSH). Such BHs bifurcate\nfrom the vacuum Kerr solution and can be regarded as a horizon within a\nrotating boson star. In a recent letter, it was shown that KBHsSH can exhibit\nvery distinct shadows from the ones of their vacuum counterparts. The setup\ntherein, however, considered the light source to be a celestial sphere\nsufficiently far away from the BH. Here, we analyse KBHsSH surrounded by an\nemitting torus of matter, simulating a more realistic astrophysical\nenvironment, and study the corresponding lensing of light as seen by a very far\naway observer, to appropriately model ground-based observations of Sgr A*. We\nfind that the differences in imaging between KBHsSH and comparable vacuum Kerr\nBHs remain, albeit less dramatic than those observed for the corresponding\nshadows in the previous setup. In particular, we highlight two observables that\nmight allow differentiating KBHsSH and Kerr BHs. The first is the angular size\nof the photon ring (in a Kerr spacetime) or lensing ring (in a KBHSH\nspacetime), the latter being significantly smaller for sufficiently\nnon-Kerr-like spacetimes. The second is the existence of an edge in the\nintensity distribution (the photon ring in Kerr spacetime). This edge can\ndisappear for very non-Kerr-like KBHsSH. It is plausible, therefore, that\nsufficiently precise Very Long Baseline Interferometric observations of BH\ncandidates can constrain this model.\n", "  We provide further non-trivial solutions to the recently proposed\ntime-dependent Dyson and quasi-Hermiticity relation. Here we solve them for the\ngeneralized version of the non-Hermitian Swanson Hamiltonian with\ntime-dependent coefficients. We construct time-dependent solutions by employing\nthe Lewis-Riesenfeld method of invariants and discuss concrete physical\napplications of our results.\n", "  In the MSSM, the tension between the observed Higgs boson mass and the\nexperimental result of the muon $g-2$ measurement requires a large mass\nsplitting between stops and smuons/charginos/neutralinos. We consider a\n5-dimensional (5D) framework of the MSSM with the Randall-Sundrum warped\nbackground metric, and show that such a mass hierarchy is naturally achieved in\nterms of geometry. In our setup, the supersymmetry is broken at the ultraviolet\n(UV) brane, while all the MSSM multiplets reside in the 5D bulk. An appropriate\nchoice of the bulk mass parameters for the MSSM matter multiplets can naturally\nrealize the sparticle mass hierarchy desired to resolve the tension. Gravitino\nis localized at the UV brane and hence becomes very heavy, while the gauginos\nspreading over the bulk acquire their masses suppressed by the 5th dimensional\nvolume. As a result, the LSP neutralino is a candidate for the dark matter as\nusual in the MSSM. In addition to reproducing the SM-like Higgs boson mass of\naround 125 GeV and the measured value of the muon $g-2$, we consider a variety\nof phenomenological constraints, and present the benchmark particle mass\nspectra which can be explored at the LHC Run-2 in the near future.\n", "  Including the generalized CP symmetry, we have performed a comprehensive scan\nof leptonic mixing patterns which can be obtained from finite discrete groups\nwith order less than 2000. Both the semidirect approach and its variant are\nconsidered. The lepton mixing matrices which can admit a good agreement with\nexperimental data can be organized into eight different categories up to\npossible row and column permutations. These viable mixing patterns can be\ncompletely obtained from the discrete flavor groups $\\Delta(6n^2)$,\n$D^{(1)}_{9n,3n}$, $A_5$ and $\\Sigma(168)$ combined with CP symmetry. We\nperform a detailed analytical and numerical analysis for each possible mixing\npattern. The resulting predictions for lepton mixing parameter, neutrinoless\ndouble decay and flavored leptogenesis are studied.\n", "  A decoupled scheme based on the Hermite expansion to construct lattice\nBoltzmann models for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations with arbitrary\nspecific heat ratio is proposed. The local equilibrium distribution function\nincluding the rotational velocity of particle is decoupled into two parts, i.e.\nthe local equilibrium distribution function of the translational velocity of\nparticle and that of the rotational velocity of particle. From these two local\nequilibrium functions, two lattice Boltzmann models are derived via the Hermite\nexpansion, namely one is in relation to the translational velocity and the\nother is connected with the rotational velocity. Accordingly, the distribution\nfunction is also decoupled. After this, the evolution equation is decoupled\ninto the evolution equation of the translational velocity and that of the\nrotational velocity. The two evolution equations evolve separately. The lattice\nBoltzmann models used in the scheme proposed by this work are constructed via\nthe Hermite expansion, so it is easy to construct new schemes of higher-order\naccuracy. To validate the proposed scheme, a shock tube simulation is\nperformed. The numerical results agree with the analytical solutions very well.\n", "  Many real systems comprised of a large number of interacting components, as\nfor instance neural networks , may exhibit collective periodic behavior even\nthough single components have no natural tendency to behave periodically.\nMacroscopic oscillations are indeed one of the most common self-organized\nbehavior observed in living systems. In the present paper we study some\ndynamical features of a two-population generalization of the mean field Ising\nmodel with the scope of investigating simple mechanisms capable to generate\nrhythm in large groups of interacting individuals. We show that the system may\nundergo a transition from a disordered phase, where the magnetization of each\npopulation fluctuates closely around zero, to a phase in which they both\ndisplay a macroscopic regular rhythm. In particular, there exists a region in\nthe parameter space where having two groups of spins with inter- and\nintra-population interactions of different strengths suffices for the emergence\nof a robust periodic behavior.\n", "  Ground-based optical microlensing surveys have provided tantalising, if\ninconclusive, evidence for a significant population of free-floating planets\n(FFPs). Both ground and space-based facilities are being used and developed\nwhich will be able to probe the distrubution of FFPs with much better\nsensitivity. It is vital also to develop a high-precision microlensing\nsimulation framework to evaluate the completeness of such surveys. We present\nthe first signal-to-noise limited calculations of the FFP microlensing rate\nusing the Besancon Galactic model. The microlensing distribution towards the\nGalactic centre is simulated for wide-area ground-based optical surveys such as\nOGLE or MOA, a wide-area ground-based near-IR survey, and a targeted\nspace-based near-IR survey which could be undertaken with Euclid or WFIRST. We\npresent a calculation framework for the computation of the optical and\nnear-infrared microlensing rate and optical depth for simulated stellar\ncatalogues which are signal-to-noise limited, and take account of extinction,\nunresolved stellar background light and finite source size effects, which can\nbe significant for FFPs. We find that the global ground-based I-band yield over\na central 200 deg^2 region covering the Galactic centre ranges from 20\nEarth-mass FFPs year^-1 up to 3,500 year^-1 for Jupiter FFPs in the limit of\n100% detection efficiency, and almost an order of magnitude larger for a K-band\nsurvey. For ground-based surveys we find that the inclusion of finite source\nand the unresolved background reveals a mass-dependent variation in the spatial\ndistribution of FFPs. For a space-based H-band covering 2 deg^2, the yield\ndepends on the target field but maximizes close to the Galactic centre with\naround 76 Earth through to 1,700 Jupiter FFPs year^-1. For near-IR space-based\nsurveys the spatial distribution of FFPs is found to be largely insensitive to\nthe FFP mass scale.\n", "  We study the critical Josephson current flowing through a double quantum dot\nweakly coupled to two superconducting leads. We use analytical as well as\nnumerical methods to investigate this setup in the limit of small and large\nbandwidth leads in all possible charging states, where we account for on-site\ninteractions exactly. Our results provide clear signatures of nonlocal\nspin-entangled pairs, which support interpretations of recent experiments\n[Deacon, R. S. et al., Nat. Commun. 6, 7446 (2015)]. In addition, we find that\nthe ground state with one electron on each quantum dot can undergo a tunable\nsinglet-triplet phase transition in the regime where the superconducting gap in\nthe leads is not too large, which gives rise to an additional new signature of\nnonlocal Cooper pair transport.\n", "  We study the finite volume effects on the electric polarizability for the\nneutron, neutral pion, and neutral kaon using eight dynamically generated\ntwo-flavor nHYP-clover ensembles at two different pion masses: 306(1) and\n227(2) MeV. An infinite volume extrapolation is performed for each hadron at\nboth pion masses. For the neutral kaon, finite volume effects are relatively\nmild. The dependence on the quark mass is also mild and a reliable chiral\nextrapolation can be performed along with the infinite volume extrapolation.\nOur result is $\\alpha_{K^0}^\\mbox{phys}=0.356(74) \\times 10^{-4} \\mbox{fm}^3$.\nIn contrast, for neutron the electric polarizability depends strongly on the\nvolume. After removing the finite volume corrections, our neutron\npolarizability results are in good agreement with $\\chi$PT. For the connected\npart of the neutral pion polarizability, the negative trend persists, and it is\nnot due to finite volume effects, but likely sea quark charging effects.\n", "  Recent work on jets and disk winds in low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs)\nsuggests that they are to a large extent mutually exclusive, with jets observed\nin spectrally hard states and disk winds observed in spectrally soft states. In\nthis paper we use existing literature on jets and disk winds in the luminous\nneutron star (NS) LMXB GX 13+1, in combination with archival Rossi X-ray Timing\nExplorer data, to show that this source is likely able to produce jets and disk\nwinds simultaneously. We find that jets and disk winds occur in the same\nlocation on the source's track in its X-ray color-color diagram. A further\nstudy of literature on other luminous LMXBs reveals that this behavior is more\ncommon, with indications for simultaneous jets and disk winds in the black hole\nLMXBs V404 Cyg and GRS 1915+105 and the NS LMXBs Sco X-1 and Cir X-1. For the\nthree sources for which we have the necessary spectral information, we find\nthat the simultaneous jets/winds all occur in their spectrally hardest states.\nOur findings indicate that in LMXBs with luminosities above a few tens of\npercent of the Eddington luminosity, jets and disk winds are not mutually\nexclusive, and that the presence of disk winds does not necessarily result in\njet suppression.\n", "  An effective Finite-Size Scaling (FSS) of moment products from recent STAR\nmeasurements of the variance $\\sigma$, skewness $S$ and kurtosis $\\kappa$ of\nnet-proton multiplicity distributions, are reported for a broad range of\ncollision centralities in Au+Au ($\\sqrt{s_{NN}}= 7.7 - 200$ GeV) collisions.\nThe products $S\\sigma $ and $\\kappa \\sigma^2 $, which are directly related to\nthe hgher-order baryon number susceptibility ratios $\\chi^{(3)}_B/\\chi^{(2)}_B$\nand $\\chi^{(4)}_B/\\chi^{(2)}_B$, show scaling patterns consistent with earlier\nindications for a second order phase transition at a critical end point (CEP)\nin the plane of temperature vs. baryon chemical potential ($T,\\mu_B$) of the\nQCD phase diagram. The resulting scaling functions validate the earlier\nestimates of $T^{\\text{cep}} \\sim 165$ MeV and $\\mu_B^{\\text{cep}} \\sim 95$ MeV\nfor the location of the CEP, and the critical exponents used to assign its 3D\nIsing model universality class.\n", "  The TITUS, Tokai Intermediate Tank for Unoscillated Spectrum, detector, is a\nproposed Gd-doped Water Cherenkov tank with a magnetised muon range detector\ndownstream. It is located at J-PARC at about 2 km from the neutrino target and\nit is proposed as a potential near detector for the Hyper-Kamiokande\nexperiment. Assuming a beam power of 1.3 MW and 27.05 x 10^{21}\nprotons-on-target the sensitivity to CP and mixing parameters achieved by\nHyper-Kamiokande with TITUS as a near detector is presented. Also, the\npotential of the detector for cross sections and Standard Model parameter\ndetermination, supernova neutrino and dark matter are shown.\n", "  We discuss ground state factorization schemes in spin $S$ arrays with general\n$XYZ$ couplings under general magnetic fields, not necessarily uniform or\ntransverse. It is first shown that given arbitrary spin alignment directions at\neach site, nonzero couplings between any pair and fields at each site always\nexist such that the ensuing Hamiltonian has an exactly separable eigenstate\nwith the spins pointing along the specified directions. Furthermore, by\nsuitable tuning of the fields this eigenstate can always be cooled down to a\nnondegenerate ground state. It is also shown that in open one-dimensional\nsystems with arbitrary $XYZ$ first neighbor couplings, at least one separable\neigenstate compatible with an arbitrarily chosen spin direction at one site is\nalways feasible if the fields at each site can be tuned. We demonstrate as well\nthat in the vicinity of factorization, i.e., for small perturbations in the\nfields or couplings, pairwise entanglement reaches full range. Some noticeable\nexamples of factorized eigenstates for uniform couplings are unveiled. The\npresent results open the way for separable ground state engineering. A notation\nto quantify the complexity of a given type of solution according to the\nrequired control on the system couplings and fields is introduced.\n", "  The phase diagram of the spin-1 chain with bilinear-biquadratic and\nnext-nearest neighbor inter- actions, recently investigated by Pixley, Shashi\nand Nevidomskyy [Phys. Rev. B 90, 214426 (2014)], has been revisited in the\nlight of results we have recently obtained on a similar model. Combining\nextensive Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) simulations with\nconformal-field theory arguments, we confirm the presence of the three phases\nidentified by Pixley et al, a Haldane phase, a next-nearest neighbor (NNN)\nHaldane phase, and a dimerized phase, but we come to significantly different\nconclusions regarding the nature of the phase transitions to the dimerized\nphase: i) We provide numerical evidence of a continuous Ising transition\nbetween the NNN-Haldane phase and the dimerized phase; ii) We show that the\ntri-critical end point, where the continuous transition between the Haldane\nphase and the dimerized phase turns into a first order transition, is distinct\nfrom the triple point where the three phases meet; iii) Finally, we demonstrate\nthat the tri-critical end point is in the same Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) SU(2)\nlevel 2 universality class as the continuous transition line that ends at this\npoint\n", "  In this letter, for the discrete parity-time-symmetric nonlocal nonlinear\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation, we construct the Darboux transformation, which\nprovides an algebraic iterative algorithm to obtain a series of analytic\nsolutions from a known one. To illustrate, the breathing-soliton solutions,\nperiodic-wave solutions and localized rational soliton solutions are derived\nwith the zero and plane-wave solutions as the seeds. The properties of those\nsolutions are also discussed, and particularly the asymptotic analysis reveals\nall possible cases of the interaction between the discrete rational dark and\nantidark solitons.\n", "  Quantum-dense metrology (QDM) constitutes a special case of quantum metrology\nin which two orthogonal phase space projections of a signal are simultaneously\nsensed beyond the shot noise limit. Previously it was shown that the additional\nsensing channel that is provided by QDM contains information that can be used\nto identify and to discard corrupted segments from the measurement data. Here,\nwe demonstrate a proof-of-principle experiment in which this information is\nused for improving the sensitivity without discarding any measurement segments.\nOur measurement reached sub-shot-noise performance although initially strong\nclassical noise polluted the data.\n", "  We study the Tracy-Widom distribution function for Dyson's $\\beta$-ensemble\nwith $\\beta = 6$. The starting point of our analysis is the recent work of I.\nRumanov where he produces a Lax-pair representation for the Bloemendal-Vir\\'ag\nequation. The latter is a linear PDE which describes the Tracy-Widom functions\ncorresponding to general values of $\\beta$. Using his Lax pair, Rumanov derives\nan explicit formula for the Tracy-Widom $\\beta=6$ function in terms of the\nsecond Painlev\\'e transcendent and the solution of an auxiliary ODE. Rumanov\nalso shows that this formula allows him to derive formally the asymptotic\nexpansion of the Tracy-Widom function. Our goal is to make Rumanov's approach\nand hence the asymptotic analysis it provides rigorous. In this paper, the\nfirst one in a sequel, we show that Rumanov's Lax-pair can be interpreted as a\ncertain gauge transformation of the standard Lax pair for the second Painlev\\'e\nequation. This gauge transformation though contains functional parameters which\nare defined via some auxiliary nonlinear ODE which is equivalent to the\nauxiliary ODE of Rumanov's formula. The gauge-interpretation of Rumanov's\nLax-pair allows us to highlight the steps of the original Rumanov's method\nwhich needs rigorous justifications in order to make the method complete. We\nprovide a rigorous justification of one of these steps. Namely, we prove that\nthe Painlev\\'e function involved in Rumanov's formula is indeed, as it has been\nsuggested by Rumanov, the Hastings-McLeod solution of the second Painlev\\'e\nequation. The key issue which we also discuss and which is still open is the\nquestion of integrability of the auxiliary ODE in Rumanov's formula. We note\nthat this question is crucial for the rigorous asymptotic analysis of the\nTracy-Widom function.\n", "  We discuss a test of the Standard Model fermion mass origin in models of\ndynamical electroweak symmetry breaking. The couplings of composite\npseudoscalar resonances to top quarks allow to distinguish high-scale\nExtended-Technicolor-type fermion mass generation from fermion partial\ncompositeness and low-scale mass generation via an induced vacuum expectation\nvalue of a doublet coupled to the composite sector. These different possible\norigins of fermion masses are thus accessible via weak-scale physics searched\nfor at the LHC.\n", "  We perform a theoretical investigation into the classical and quantum\ndynamics of an optical field in a cavity containing a moving membrane\n(\"membrane-in-the-middle\" set-up). Our approach is based on the Maxwell wave\nequation, and complements previous studies based on an effective Hamiltonian.\nThe analysis shows that for slowly moving and weakly reflective membranes the\ndynamics can be approximated by unitary, first-order-in-time evolution given by\nan effective Schr\\\"{o}dinger-like equation with a Hamiltonian that does not\ndepend on the membrane speed. This approximate theory is the one typically\nadopted in cavity optomechanics and we develop a criterion for its validity.\nHowever, in more general situations the full second-order wave equation\npredicts light dynamics which do not conserve energy, giving rise to parametric\namplification (or reduction) that is forbidden under first order dynamics and\ncan be considered to be the classical counterpart of the dynamical Casimir\neffect. The case of a membrane moving at constant velocity can be mapped onto\nthe Landau-Zener problem but with additional terms responsible for field\namplification. Furthermore, the nature of the adiabatic regime is rather\ndifferent from the ordinary Schr\\\"odinger case, since mode amplitudes need not\nbe constant even when there are no transitions between them. The Landau-Zener\nproblem for a field is therefore richer than in the standard single-particle\ncase. We use the work-energy theorem applied to the radiation pressure on the\nmembrane as a self-consistency check for our solutions of the wave equation and\nas a tool to gain an intuitive understanding of energy pumped into/out of the\nlight field by the motion of the membrane.\n", "  We consider a theory with isotropic nonbirefringent Lorentz violation in the\nphoton sector and explore the effects on the development of the electromagnetic\ncomponent of extensive air showers in the Earth atmosphere. Specifically, we\nconsider the case of a \"fast\" photon with a phase velocity larger than the\nmaximum attainable velocity of a massive Dirac fermion (this case corresponds\nto a negative Lorentz-violating parameter $\\kappa$ in the action). Shower\nphotons with above-threshold energies decay promptly into electron-positron\npairs, instead of decaying by the conventional production of electron-positron\npairs in the background fields of atomic nuclei. This rapid production of\ncharged leptons accelerates the shower development, decreasing the atmospheric\ndepth of the shower maximum ($X_\\text{max}$) by an amount which could be\nmeasured by cosmic-ray observatories. Precise measurements of $X_\\text{max}$\ncould then improve existing limits on the negative Lorentz-violating parameter\n$\\kappa$ by several orders of magnitude.\n", "  We study a model with a Higgs-like dilaton and a Standard Model gauge-singlet\nscalar dark matter candidate. We begin by updating the status of identifying\nthe observed 125 GeV Higgs-like boson with the pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson\nthat arises from the spontaneous breaking of scale invariance using recent\nHiggs boson signal strength measurements by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations.\nWe then constrain the extended model with recent constraints on the Higgs\ninvisible width, the observed dark matter relic abundance and the latest dark\nmatter direct detection limits. We found that the magnitude of the\ndilaton-$\\gamma\\gamma$ and dilaton-glue-glue coupling is constrained to be\nclose to the standard model values. The mass of the dark matter candidate is\ncontrained to be greater than half the dilaton mass by relic abundance limits\nand Higgs invisible width limits. Dark matter direct detection limits allow\nonly small mass regions which will be further constrained by upcoming DEAP\nmeasurements.\n", "  We study the impact of spin-exchange collisions on the dynamics of\nBose-Einstein condensation, by rapidly cooling a chromium multi-component Bose\ngas. Despite relatively strong spin-dependent interactions, the critical\ntemperature for Bose-Einstein condensation is reached before the spin-degrees\nof freedom fully thermalize. The increase in density due to Bose-Einstein\ncondensation then triggers spin dynamics, hampering the formation of\ncondensates in spin excited states. Small metastable spinor condensates are\nnevertheless produced, and manifest strong spin fluctuations.\n", "  The nearest-neighbor superexchange-mediated mechanism for d_{x^2-y^2}-wave\nsuperconductivity in the one-band Hubbard model faces the challenge that\nnearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsion can be larger than superexchange. To answer\nthis question, we use cellular dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT) with a\ncontinuous-time quantum Monte Carlo solver to determine the superconducting\nphase diagram as a function of temperature and doping for on-site repulsion\n$U=9t$ and nearest-neighbor repulsion $V=0,2t,4t$. In the underdoped regime,\n$V$ increases the CDMFT superconducting transition temperature $T_c^d$ even\nthough it decreases the superconducting order parameter at low temperature for\nall dopings. However, $V$ decreases $T_c^d$ in the overdoped regime. We gain\ninsight into these paradoxical results through a detailed study of the\nfrequency dependence of the anomalous spectral function, extracted at finite\ntemperature via the MaxEntAux method for analytic continuation. A systematic\nstudy of dynamical positive and negative contributions to pairing reveals that\neven though $V$ has a high-frequency depairing contribution, it also has a low\nfrequency pairing contribution since it can reinforce superexchange through\n$J=4t^2/(U-V)$. Retardation is thus crucial to understand pairing in doped Mott\ninsulators, as suggested by previous zero-temperature studies. We also comment\non the tendency to charge order for large $V$ and on the persistence of d-wave\nsuperconductivity over extended-$s$ or s+d-wave.\n", "  In these lectures we give an overview of the duality between gravitational\ntheories of massless higher spin fields in AdS and large N vector models. We\nfirst review the original higher spin/vector model duality conjectured by\nKlebanov and Polyakov, and then discuss its generalizations involving vector\nmodels coupled to Chern-Simons gauge fields. We proceed to review some aspects\nof the theory of massless higher spins, starting with the Fronsdal equations\nfor free fields and moving on to the fully non-linear Vasiliev equations in\nfour dimensions. We end by reviewing some recent tests of the higher\nspin/vector model duality at the level of correlation functions and one-loop\npartition functions.\n", "  We investigate $B_s\\pi^+$ scattering in s-wave using lattice QCD in order to\nsearch for an exotic resonance X(5568) with flavor $\\bar b s \\bar d u$; such a\nstate was recently reported by D0 but was not seen by LHCb. If X(5568) with\n$J^P=0^+$ exists, it can strongly decay only to $B_s\\pi^+$ and lies\nsignificantly below all other thresholds, which makes a lattice search for\nX(5568) cleaner and simpler than for other exotic candidates. Both an elastic\nresonance in $B_s\\pi^+$ as well as a deeply bound $B^+\\bar K^0$ would lead to\ndistinct signatures in the energies of lattice eigenstates, which are not seen\nin our simulation. We therefore do not find a candidate for X(5568) with\n$J^P=0^+$ in agreement with the recent LHCb result. The extracted $B_s\\pi^+$\nscattering length is compatible with zero within the error.\n", "  We study the effect of intrinsic fluctuations of the proton saturation\nmomentum scale on event-by-event rapidity distributions. Saturation scale\nfluctuations generate an asymmetry in the single particle rapidity distribution\nin each event resulting in genuine n-particle correlations having a component\nlinear in the rapidities of the produced particles, $y_1\\cdots y_n$. We\nintroduce a color domain model that naturally explains the centrality\ndependence of the two-particle rapidity correlations recently measured by ATLAS\nwhile constraining the probability distribution of saturation scale\nfluctuations in the proton. Predictions for n = 4, 6 and 8 particle\ncorrelations find that the four and eight-particle cumulant change sign at an\nintermediate multiplicity, a signature which could be tested experimentally.\n", "  We investigate theoretically the interplay between the effects of a\nperpendicular electric field and incommensurability at the interface on the\nelectronic properties of a heterostructure of bilayer graphene and a\nsemiconducting substrate with a unit cell almost three times larger then that\nof graphene. It is known that the former introduces an asymmetry in the\ndistribution of the electronic wave function between the layers and opens a\nband gap in the electronic spectrum. The latter generates a long wavelength\nperiodic moir\\'{e} perturbation of graphene electrons which couples states in\ninequivalent graphene Brillouin zone corners and leads to the formation of\nminibands. We show that, depending on the details of the moir\\'{e}\nperturbation, the miniband structure can be tuned from that with a single band\ngap at the neutrality point and over-lapping minibands on the\nconduction/valence band side to a situation where a single narrow miniband is\nseparated by gaps from the rest of the spectrum.\n", "  We propose a scheme to actively cool the fundamental flexural (out-of-plane)\nmode of a graphene sheet via vacuum forces. Our setup consists in a cold atom\ncloud placed close to a graphene sheet at distances of a few micrometers. The\natoms couple to the graphene membrane via Casimir-Polder forces. By deriving a\nself-consistent set of equations governing the dynamics of the atomic gas and\nthe flexural modes of the graphene, we show to be possible to cool graphene\nfrom room temperatures by actively (laser) cooling an atomic gas. By choosing\nthe right set of experimental parameter we are able to cool a graphene sheet\ndown to ~ 60 microkelvin.\n", "  Charge Parity asymmetry in charmless B meson decays is a key issue to be\nunderstood. Many theoretical calculations have been performed using short\ndistance factorization approaches which, in general, do not take into account\nthe CPT invariance constraint. For each channel with CP violation there is an\nequal amount of CP asymmetry in another channel or other channels, with an\nopposite sign. This happens if these channels are coupled through final state\ninteractions (FSI). In the specific process $B\\to PV$, involving one\npseudo-scalar and one vector particle in the final state, we argue that the CP\nasymmetry, inherent from a short distance mechanism, could be suppressed due to\nthe CPT constraint. In this case, we propose a sensitive and practical\nexperimental method to identify even a small CP asymmetry, which provides the\nvalues for $A_{CP}$ without the need for an amplitude analysis. This method, if\napplied directly to data, will enable to extract the CP asymmetry information\nin a model independent way and check to which extend the suggested suppression\ndue to the CPT constraint is verified.\n", "  Extremely high magnetoresistance (XMR) in the lanthanum monopnictides La$X$\n($X$ = Sb, Bi) has recently attracted interest in these compounds as candidate\ntopological materials. However, their perfect electron-hole compensation\nprovides an alternative explanation, so the possible role of topological\nsurface states requires verification through direct observation. Our\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) data reveal multiple\nDirac-like surface states near the Fermi level in both materials. Intriguingly,\nwe have observed circular dichroism in both surface and near-surface bulk\nbands. Thus the spin-orbit coupling-induced orbital and spin angular momentum\ntextures may provide a mechanism to forbid backscattering in zero field,\nsuggesting that surface and near-surface bulk bands may contribute strongly to\nXMR in La$X$. The extremely simple rock salt structure of these materials and\nthe ease with which high-quality crystals can be prepared suggests that they\nmay be an ideal platform for further investigation of topological matter.\n", "  The quark-gluon matter produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions may\ncontain local domains in which P and CP symmetries are not preserved. When\ncoupled with an external magnetic field, such P- and CP-odd domains will\ngenerate electric currents along the magnetic field --- a phenomenon called the\nchiral magnetic effect (CME). Recently, the STAR Collaboration at RHIC and the\nALICE Collaboration at the LHC released data of charge-dependent\nazimuthal-angle correlators with features consistent with the CME expectation.\nHowever, the experimental observable is contaminated with significant\nbackground contributions from elliptic-flow-driven effects, which makes the\ninterpretation of the data ambiguous. In this Letter, we show that the\ncollisions of isobaric nuclei, $^{96}_{44}$Ru + $^{96}_{44}$Ru and\n$^{96}_{40}$Zr + $^{96}_{40}$Zr, provide an ideal tool to disentangle the CME\nsignal from the background effects. Our simulation demonstrates that the two\ncollision types at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=200$ GeV have more than $10\\%$ difference\nin the CME signal and less than $2\\%$ difference in the elliptic-flow-driven\nbackgrounds for the centrality range of $20-60\\%$.\n", "  We study the extended colored Zee-Babu model introducing a vector-like quark\nand singlet scalar. The active neutrino mass matrix and muon anomalous magnetic\nmoment are analyzed, which can be fitted to experimental data satisfying the\nconstraints from flavor changing neutral current. Then we discuss signature of\nour model via vector-like quark production. In addition, the diphoton excess\ncan be explained with the contribution from vector-like quark\n", "  We study the effects of crystal anisotropy on optical phonon resonances in\nthe second harmonic generation (SHG) from silicon carbide (SiC) in its\nReststrahl region. By comparing experiments and simulations for isotropic\n3C-SiC and anisotropic 4H-SiC in two crystal cuts, we identify several\npronounced effects in the nonlinear response which arise solely from the\ncrystal anisotropy. Specifically, we demonstrate that the axial and planar\ntransverse optical phonon resonances selectively and exclusively appear in the\ncorresponding tensor elements of the nonlinear susceptibility, enabling\nobservation of an intense SHG peak originating from a weak phonon mode due to\nzone-folding along the c-axis of 4H-SiC. Similarly, we identify an anisotropy\nfactor $\\zeta \\equiv \\epsilon_\\perp/\\epsilon_\\parallel$ responsible for a steep\nenhancement of the transmitted fundamental fields at the axial longitudinal\noptical phonon frequency, resulting in strongly enhanced SHG. We develop a\ngeneral recipe to extract all these features that is directly applicable to all\nwurtzite-structure polar dielectrics, where a very similar behavior is\nexpected. Our model study illustrates the opportunities for utilizing the\ncrystal anisotropy for selectively enhancing nonlinear-optical effects in polar\ndielectrics, which could potentially be extended to built-in anisotropy in\nartificially designed hybrid materials.\n", "  The spectrum of the massive CPT-odd Yang-Mills propagator with Lorentz\nviolation is performed at tree-level. The modification is due to mass terms\ngenerated by the exigence of multiplicative renormalizability of Yang-Mills\ntheory with Lorentz violation. The causality analysis is performed from group\nand front velocities for both, spacelike and timelike background tensors. It is\nshow that, by demanding causality, it is always possible to define a physical\nsector for the gauge propagator. Hence, it is expected that the model is also\nunitary, if one takes the Faddeev-Popov ghost into account.\n", "  We study strongly correlated ground states of dipolar fermions in a honeycomb\noptical lattice with spatial variations in hopping amplitudes. Similar to a\nstrained graphene, such nonuniform hopping amplitudes produce valley-dependent\npseudomagnetic fields for fermions near the two Dirac points, resulting in the\nformation of Landau levels. The dipole moments polarized perpendicular to the\nhoneycomb plane yield a long-range repulsive interaction. By exact\ndiagonalization in the zeroth-Landau-level basis, we show that this repulsive\ninteraction stabilizes a variety of valley-polarized fractional quantum Hall\nstates such as Laughlin and composite-fermion states. The present system thus\noffers an intriguing platform for emulating fractional quantum Hall physics in\na static optical lattice. We calculate the energy gaps above these\nincompressible states, and discuss the temperature scales required for their\nexperimental realization.\n", "  This paper describes an automatic isophotal fitting procedure that succeeds,\nwithout the support of any visual inspection of neither the images nor the\nellipticity/P.A. radial profiles, at extracting a fairly pure sample of barred\nLTGs among thousands of optical images from the SDSS. The procedure relies on\nthe methods described in Consolandi et al. (2016) to robustly extract the\nphotometrical properties of a large sample of local SDSS galaxies and is\ntailored to extract bars on the basis of their well-known peculiarities in\ntheir P.A. and ellipticity profiles. It has been run on a sample of 5853\ngalaxies in the Coma and Local supercluster. The procedure extracted for each\ngalaxy a color, an ellipticity and a position angle radial profile of the\nellipses fitted to the isophotes. Examining automatically the profiles of 922\nface-on late-type galaxies (B/A >0.7) the procedure found that ~ 36 % are\nbarred. The local bar fraction strongly increases with stellar mass. The sample\nof barred galaxies is used to construct a set of template radial color profiles\nin order to test the impact of the barred galaxy population on the average\ncolor profiles shown by Consolandi et al. (2016) and to test the bar-quenching\nscenario proposed in Gavazzi et al. (2015). The radial color profile of barred\ngalaxy shows that bars are on average redder than their surrounding disk\nproducing an outside-in gradient toward red in correspondence of their\ncorotation radius. The distribution of the extension of the deprojected length\nof the bar suggests that bars have strong impacts on the gradients of averaged\ncolor profiles. The dependence of the profiles on the mass is consistent with\nthe bar-quenching scenario, i.e. more massive barred galaxies have redder\ncolors (hence older stellar population and suppressed star formation) inside\ntheir corotation radius with respect to their lower mass counterparts.\n", "  We utilize various {\\em ab initio} approaches to search for a low-lying\nresonance in the four-neutron ($4n$) system using the JISP16 realistic $NN$\ninteraction. Our most accurate prediction is obtained using a $J$-matrix\nextension of the No-Core Shell Model and suggests a $4n$ resonant state at an\nenergy near $E_r = 0.8$ MeV with a width of approximately $\\Gamma = 1.4$ MeV.\n", "  Supported by a kinetic simulation, we derive an exclusion energy parameter\n$\\cal{E}_X$ providing a lower kinetic energy bound for an electron to cross\nfrom one inflow region to the other during magnetic reconnection. As by a\nMaxwell Demon, only high energy electrons are permitted to cross the inner\nreconnection region, setting the electron distribution function observed along\nthe low density side separatrix during asymmetric reconnection. The analytic\nmodel accounts for the two distinct flavors of crescent-shaped electron\ndistributions observed by spacecraft in a thin boundary layer along the low\ndensity separatrix.\n", "  We investigate the in-medium behavior of mesons at finite temperature and\nbaryon chemical potential within a soft-wall model of AdS/QCD. We use a quartic\nscalar potential to obtain the correct form of chiral symmetry breaking. At\nzero quark mass the chiral phase transition is second-order, becoming a\ncrossover at physical quark mass. At zero baryon chemical potential, we find a\nchiral transition temperature of 155 MeV in the chiral limit and a\npseudo-transition temperature of 151 MeV at physical quark mass, consistent\nwith lattice results. In the low-temperature limit, the second-order transition\noccurs at a baryon chemical potential of 566 MeV while the rapid crossover\noccurs at 559 MeV. A new parameterization of the dilaton profile results in\nimproved meson spectra. Meson melting occurs at a lower temperature and\nchemical potential than the chiral phase transition, so the vector-axial vector\nmass splitting remains constant until the bound states melt.\n", "  We present a method of broadening the dynamic range of optical\ninterferometric detection of cantilever displacement. The key idea of this\nsystem is to use a wavelength-tunable laser source. The wavelength is subject\nto proportional-integral control, which is used to keep the cavity detuning\nconstant during a measurement. Under this control, the change in wavelength is\nproportional to the cantilever displacement. Using this technique, we can\nmeasure large displacements ($>1\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m}$) without degradation of\nsensitivity. We apply this technique to high-frequency electron spin resonance\nspectroscopy and succeed in removing an irregular background signal that arises\nfrom the constantly varying sensitivity of the interferometer.\n", "  We consider the process of magnetogenesis in the context of nonsingular\nbounce cosmology. We show that large primordial magnetic fields can be\ngenerated during contraction without encountering strong coupling and\nbackreaction issues. The fields may seed large-scale magnetic fields with\nobservationally interesting strengths. This result leads to a theoretical\nconstraint on the relation of the energy scale of the bounce cosmology to the\nnumber of effective e-folding of the contracting phase in the case of scale\ninvariance for the power spectrum of primordial magnetic fields. We show that\nthis constraint can be satisfied in a sizable region of the parameter space for\nthe nonsingular bounce cosmology.\n", "  We investigate analytically and numerically the interaction between grain\nboundaries and second phase precipitates in two-phase coherent solids in the\npresence of misfit strain. Our numerical study uses amplitude equations that\ndescribe the interaction of composition and stress [R. Spatschek and A. Karma,\nPhys. Rev. B {\\bf 81}, 214201 (2010)] and free-energies corresponding to\ntwo-dimensional hexagonal and three-dimensional BCC crystal structures that\nexhibit isotropic and anisotropic elastic properties, respectively. We consider\ntwo experimentally motivated geometries where (i) a lamellar precipitate\nnucleates along a planar grain boundary that is centered inside the\nprecipitate, and (ii) a circular precipitate nucleates inside a grain at a\nfinite distance to an initially planar grain boundary. For the first geometry,\nwe find that the grain boundary becomes morphologically unstable due to the\ncombination of long-range elastic interaction between the grain boundary and\ncompositional domain boundaries, and shear-coupled grain boundary motion. We\ncharacterize this instability analytically by extending the linear stability\nanalysis carried out recently [P.-A. Geslin, Y.-C. Xu, and A. Karma, Phys. Rev.\nLett. {\\bf 114}, 105501 (2015)] to the more general case of elastic anisotropy.\nThe analysis predicts that elastic anisotropy hinders but does not suppress the\ninstability. Simulations also reveal that, in a well-developed non-linear\nregime, this instability can lead to the break-up of low-angle grain boundaries\nwhen the misfit strain exceeds a threshold that depends on the grain boundary\nmisorientation. For the second geometry, simulations show that the elastic\ninteraction between an initially planar grain boundary and an adjacent circular\nprecipitate causes the precipitate to migrate to and anchor at the grain\nboundary.\n", "  The exchange contribution to the energy of the hydrogen atom interacting with\na proton is calculated from the polarization expansion of the wave function\nusing the conventional surface-integral formula and two formulas involving\nvolume integrals: the formula of the symmetry-adapted perturbation theory\n(SAPT) and the variational formula recommended by us. At large internuclear\ndistances $R$, all three formulas yield the correct expression $-(2/e)Re^{-R}$,\nbut approximate it with very different convergence rates. In the case of the\nSAPT formula, the convergence is geometric with the error falling as $3^{-K}$,\nwhere $K$ is the order of the applied polarization expansion. The error of the\nsurface-integral formula decreases exponentially as $a^K/(K+1)!$, where $a=\\ln2\n-\\tfrac{1}{2}$. The variational formula performs best, its error decays as\n$K^{1/2} [a^{ K}/(K+1)!]^2$. These convergence rates are much faster than those\nresulting from approximating the wave function through the multipole expansion.\nThis shows the efficiency of the partial resummation of the multipole series\neffected by the polarization expansion. Our results demonstrate also the\nbenefits of incorporating the variational principle into the perturbation\ntheory of molecular interactions.\n", "  We show that the masses of the lowest-lying heavy baryons can be very well\ndescribed in a pion mean-field approach. We consider a heavy baryon as a system\nconsisting of the $N_c-1$ light quarks that induce the pion mean field, and a\nheavy quark as a static color source under the influence of this mean field. In\nthis approach we derive a number of \\textit{model-independent} relations and\ncalculate the heavy baryon masses using those of the lowest-lying light baryons\nas input. The results are in remarkable agreement with the experimental data.\nIn addition, the mass of the $\\Omega_b^*$ baryon is predicted.\n", "  The gravitational acceleration of antimatter, $\\bar g$, has yet to be\ndirectly measured but could change our understanding of gravity, the Universe,\nand the possibility of a fifth force. Three avenues are apparent for such a\nmeasurement: antihydrogen, positronium, and muonium, the last requiring a\nprecision atom interferometer and benefiting from a novel muonium beam under\ndevelopment. The interferometer and its few-picometer alignment and calibration\nsystems appear to be feasible. With 100 nm grating pitch, measurements of $\\bar\ng$ to 10%, 1%, or better can be envisioned. This could constitute the first\ngravitational measurement of leptonic matter, of second-generation matter and,\npossibly, the first measurement of the gravitational acceleration of\nantimatter.\n", "  We consider the creation of 't Hooft-Polyakov magnetic monopoles by\nscattering classical wave packets of gauge fields. An example with eight\nclearly separated magnetic poles created with parity violating helical initial\nconditions is shown. No clear separation of topological charge is observed with\ncorresponding parity symmetric initial conditions.\n", "  Strong field photoemission and electron recollision provide a viable route to\nextract electronic and nuclear dynamics from molecular targets with attosecond\ntemporal resolution. However, since an {\\em ab-initio} treatment of even the\nsimplest diatomic systems is beyond today's capabilities approximate\nqualitative descriptions are warranted. In this paper, we develop such a\ntheoretical approach to model the photoelectrons resulting from intense\nlaser-molecule interaction. We present a general theory for symmetric diatomic\nmolecules in the single active electron approximation that, amongst other\ncapabilities, allows adjusting both the internuclear separation and molecular\npotential in a direct and simple way. More importantly we derive an analytic\napproximate solution of the time dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation (TDSE), based\non a generalized strong field approximation (SFA) version. Using that approach\nwe obtain expressions for electrons emitted transition amplitudes from two\ndifferent molecular centres, and accelerated then in the strong laser field.\nOne innovative aspect of our theory is the fact that the dipole matrix elements\nare free from non-physical gauge and coordinate system dependent terms -- this\nis achieved by adapting the coordinate system, in which SFA is performed, to\nthe centre from which the corresponding part of the time dependent wave\nfunction originates. Our analytic results agree very well with the numerical\nsolution of the full three-dimensional TDSE for the H$_2^+$ molecule. Moreover,\nthe theoretical model was applied to describe laser-induced electron\ndiffraction (LIED) measurements of O$_2^+$ molecules, obtained at ICFO, and\nreproduces the main features of the experiment very well. Our approach can be\nextended in a natural way to more complex molecules and multi-electron systems.\n", "  We construct a $T$-axisymmetric, spacelike, spherically symmetric, constant\nmean curvature hypersurfaces foliation in the Kruskal extension with properties\nthat the mean curvature varies in each slice and ranges from minus infinity to\nplus infinity. This family of hypersurfaces extends the CMC foliation\ndiscussions posted by Malec and \\'{O} Murchadha in 2009.\n", "  The rare decay $h \\rightarrow \\Upsilon \\gamma$ has a very small rate in the\nStandard Model, due to a strong cancellation between the direct and indirect\ndiagrams. Models with a changed $hbb$ coupling can thus lead to a great\nincrease in this decay. Current limits on two Higgs doublet models still allow\nfor the possibility that the $hbb$ coupling might have a sign opposite to the\nStandard Model; the so-called \"wrong-sign\". We show how $h \\rightarrow \\Upsilon\n\\gamma$ can be used to put limits on the wrong-sign solutions.\n", "  A hybrid asymptotic-numerical method is presented for obtaining the full\nprobability distribution of capture times of a random walker by multiple small\ntraps located inside a bounded two-dimensional domain with reflective\nboundaries. As motivation for this study, we calculate the variance in the\ncapture time of a random walker by a single interior trap and determine this\nquantity to be comparable in magnitude to the mean. This implies that the mean\nis not necessarily reflective of typical capture times and that the full\ndensity must be determined. To solve the underlying diffusion equation, the\nmethod of Laplace transforms is used to obtain an elliptic problem of modified\nHelmholtz type. In the limit of vanishing trap sizes, each trap is represented\nas a Dirac point source which permits the solution of the transform equation to\nbe represented as a superposition of Helmholtz Green's functions. Using this\nsolution, we construct asymptotic short time solutions of the first passage\ntime density which captures peaks associated with rapid capture by the\nabsorbing traps. When numerical evaluation of the Helmholtz Green's function is\nemployed followed by numerical inversion of the Laplace transform, the method\nreproduces the density for larger times. We demonstrate the accuracy of our\nsolution technique with comparison to statistics obtained from a time-dependent\nsolution of the diffusion equation and discrete particle simulations. In\nparticular, we demonstrate that the method is capable of capturing the\nmultimodal behavior in the capture time density that arises when the traps are\nstrategically arranged. The hybrid method presented can be applied to scenarios\ninvolving both arbitrary domains and trap shapes.\n", "  Aims: With the aim of assessing the effects of bars on disc galaxy\nproperties, we present an analysis of different characteristics of spiral\ngalaxies with strong, weak and without bars. Method: We identified barred\ngalaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. By visual inspection, we classified\nthe face-on spiral galaxies brighter than g<16.5 mag into strong-bar, weak-bar\nand unbarred. In order to provide an appropiate quantification of the influence\nof bars on galaxy properties, we also constructed a suitable control sample of\nunbarred galaxies with similar redshift, magnitude, morphology, bulge sizes,\nand local density environment distributions to that of barred galaxies.\nResults: We found 522 strong-barred and 770 weak-barred galaxies, representing\na 25.82% of the full sample of spiral galaxies, in good agreement with previous\nstudies. We also found that strong-barred galaxies show less efficient star\nformation activity and older stellar populations compared to weak-barred and\nunbarred spirals from the control sample. In addition, there is a significant\nexcess of strong barred galaxies with red colors. The color-color and\ncolor-magnitude diagrams show that unbarred and weak-barred galaxies are more\nextended towards the blue zone, while strong-barred objects are mostly grouped\nin the red region. Strong-barred galaxies present an important excess of high\nmetallicity values, compared to the other types, showing similar 12+log(O/H)\ndistributions. Regarding the mass-metallicity relation, we found that\nweak-barred and unbarred galaxies are fitted by similar curves, while\nstrong-barred ones show a curve which falls abruptly, with more significance in\nthe range of low stellar masses (log[Mstar/Msun] < 10.0). These results would\nindicate that prominent bars produced an accelerating effect on the gas\nprocessing, reflected in the significant changes in the physical properties of\ntheir host.\n", "  We investigated temperature and fluence dependent dynamics of the time\nresolved optical reflectivity in undoped spin-density-wave (SDW) and doped\nsuperconducting (SC) EuFe$_{2}$(As,P)$_{2}$ with emphasis on the ordered\nEu$^{2+}$-spin temperature region. The data indicate that the SDW order\ncoexists at low temperature with the SC and Eu$^{2+}$-ferromagnetic order.\nIncreasing the excitation fluence leads to a thermal suppression of the\nEu$^{2+}$-spin order due to the crystal-lattice heating while the SDW order is\nsuppressed nonthermally at a higher fluence.\n", "  The exclusive processes are considered, where a point-like source of heavy\nquark-antiquark pairs $Q \\bar Q$, e.g. their electromagnetic current, produces\na pair consisting of a heavy quarkoniumlike exotic meson (tetraquark) or baryon\n(pentaquark) and a light meson or an antibaryon. For a sufficiently large mass\nof the heavy quark $m_Q$ there is a range of the energy $E$ above the $Q \\bar\nQ$ threshold, where $E \\ll m_Q$ and still the energy is large compared to the\nstrong interaction scale, $E \\gg \\Lambda_{QCD}$. It is shown that in this\nenergy range, where the heavy quarks are nonrelelativistic, a specific\n`intermediate asymptotic' behavior sets in determined by the number $n$ of the\npairs of constituent quarks, with the rate scaling as $E^{1-n}$.\n", "  We study the well-known Friedrichs model, in which a discrete state is\ncoupled to a continuum state. By examining the pole behaviors of the Friedrichs\nmodel in a specific form factor thoroughly, we find that, in general, when the\nbare discrete state is below the threshold of the continuum state, there should\nalso be a virtual-state pole accompanying the bound-state pole originating from\nthe bare discrete state as the coupling is turned on. There are also other\nsecond-sheet poles originating from the singularities of the form factor. We\ngive a general argument for the existence of these two kinds of states. As the\ncoupling is increased to a certain value, the second-sheet poles may merge and\nbecome higher-order poles. We then discuss the completeness relations\nincorporating bound states, virtual states, and resonant states corresponding\nto higher-order poles.\n", "  We consider f(R,T) modified theory of gravity, in which the gravitational\nLagrangian is given by an arbitrary function of the Ricci scalar and the trace\nof the energy-momentum tensor of the matter, in order to investigate the\ndark-matter effects on the galaxy scale. We obtain the metric components for a\nspherically symmetric and static spacetime in the vicinity of general\nrelativity solutions. However, we concentrate on a specific model of the theory\nwhere the matter is minimally coupled to the geometry, and derive the metric\ncomponents in the galactic halo. Then, we fix the components by the rotational\nvelocities of the galaxies for the model, and show that the mass corresponding\nto the interaction term (which appears in the Einstein modified field equation)\nleads to a flat rotation curve in the halo of galaxies. In addition, for the\nproposed model, the light-deflection angle has been derived and drawn using\nsome observed data.\n", "  We demonstrate the use of a quantum transport model to study heavily graded\ngraphene p-n junctions in the quantum Hall regime. A combination of p-n\ninterface roughness and delta function disorder potential allows us to compare\nexperimental results on different devices from the literature. We find that\nwide p-n junctions suppress mixing of $n \\neq 0$ Landau levels. Our simulations\nspatially resolve carrier transport in the device, for the first time,\nrevealing separation of higher order Landau levels in strongly graded\njunctions, which suppresses mixing.\n", "  GJ676A is an M0 dwarf hosting both gas-giant and super-Earth-type planets\ndiscovered with radial-velocity measurements. Using FORS2/VLT, we obtained\nposition measurements of the star in the plane of the sky that tightly\nconstrain its astrometric reflex motion caused by the super-Jupiter planet `b`\nin a 1052-day orbit. This allows us to determine the mass of this planet to\n$M_\\mathrm{b} = 6.7^{+1.8}_{-1.5}\\,M_\\mathrm{J}$, which is $\\sim$40 \\% higher\nthan the minimum mass inferred from the radial-velocity orbit. Using new HARPS\nradial-velocity measurements, we improve upon the orbital parameters of the\ninner low-mass planets `d` and `e` and we determine the orbital period of the\nouter giant planet `c` to $P_\\mathrm{c}=7340$ days under the assumption of a\ncircular orbit. The preliminary minimum mass of planet `c` is $M_\\mathrm{c}\n\\sin i = 6.8\\,M_\\mathrm{J}$ with an upper limit of $\\sim$$39\\,M_\\mathrm{J}$\nthat we set using NACO/VLT high-contrast imaging. We also determine precise\nparallaxes and relative proper motions for both GJ676A and its wide M3\ncompanion GJ676B. Despite the probably mature age of the system, the masses and\nprojected separations ($\\sim$0.1\" -- 0.4\") of planets `b` and `c` make them\npromising targets for direct imaging with future instruments in space and on\nextremely large telescopes. In particular, we estimate that GJ676A b and GJ676A\nc are promising targets for directly detecting their reflected light with the\nWFIRST space mission. Our study demonstrates the synergy of radial-velocity and\nastrometric surveys that is necessary to identify the best targets for such a\nmission.\n", "  In previous simulations of collisionless 2D magnetic reconnection it was\nconsistently found that the term in the generalised Ohm's law that breaks the\nfrozen-in condition is the divergence of the electron pressure tensor's\nnon-gyrotropic components. A fully relativistic particle-in-cell (PIC) code was\nused to model $X$-point collapse with a guide-field in two and three spatial\ndimensions. We show that in a 2D $X$-point collapse with a guide-field close to\nthe strength of the in-plane field, the increased induced shear flows along the\ndiffusion region lead to a new reconnection regime in which electron inertial\nterms play a dominant role at the $X$-point. This transition is marked by the\nemergence of a magnetic island - and hence a second reconnection site - as well\nas electron flow vortices moving along the current sheet. The reconnection\nelectric field at the $X$-point is shown to exceed all lower guide-field cases\nfor a brief period, indicating a strong burst in reconnection. By extending the\nsimulation to three spatial dimensions it is shown that the locations of\nvortices along the current sheet (visualised by their $Q$-value) vary in the\nout-of-plane direction, producing tilted vortex tubes. The vortex tubes on\nopposite sides of the diffusion region are tilted in opposite directions,\nsimilarly to bifurcated current sheets in oblique tearing-mode reconnection.\nThe tilt angles of vortex tubes were compared to a theoretical estimation and\nwere found to be a good match. Particle velocity distribution functions for\ndifferent guide-field runs, for 2.5D and 3D simulations, are analysed and\ncompared.\n", "  In this paper we study the structure of the $C^*$-algebra, generated by the\nrepresentation of the paths semigroup on a partially ordered set (poset) and\nget the net of isomorphic $C^*$-algebras over this poset. We construct the\nextensions of this algebra, such that the algebra is an ideal in that\nextensions and quotient algebras are isomorphic to the Cuntz algebra.\n", "  We study numerically in the time domain the linearized gravitational waves\nemitted from a plunge into a nearly extremal Kerr black hole by solving the\ninhomogeneous Teukolsky equation. We consider spinning black holes for which\nthe specific spin angular momentum $a/M=1-\\epsilon$, and we consider values of\n$\\epsilon\\geq 10^{-6}$. We find an effective transient behavior for the\nquasi-normal ringdown: the early phase of the quasi-normal ringdown is governed\nby a decay according to inverse time, with frequency equaling twice the black\nhole's horizon frequency. The smaller $\\epsilon$ the later the transition from\nthis transient inverse time decay to exponential decay. Such sources, if exist,\nmay be interesting potential sources for terrestrial or space borne\ngravitational wave observatories.\n", "  We demonstrate deterministic generation of two distinct collective\nexcitations in one atomic ensemble, and we realize the Hong-Ou-Mandel\ninterference between them. Using Rydberg blockade we create single collective\nexcitations in two different Zeeman levels, and we use stimulated Raman\ntransitions to perform a beam-splitter operation between the excited atomic\nmodes. By converting the atomic excitations into photons, the two-excitation\ninterference is measured by photon coincidence detection with a visibility of\n0.89(6). The Hong-Ou-Mandel interference witnesses an entangled NOON state of\nthe collective atomic excitations, and we demonstrate its two times enhanced\nsensitivity to a magnetic field compared with a single excitation. Our work\nimplements a minimal instance of Boson sampling and paves the way for further\nmulti-mode and multi-excitation studies with collective excitations of atomic\nensembles.\n", "  The presence and character of local integrals of motion -- quasi-local\noperators that commute with the Hamiltonian -- encode valuable information\nabout the dynamics of a quantum system. In particular, strongly disordered\nmany-body systems can generically avoid thermalisation when there are\nextensively many such operators. In this work, we explicitly construct local\nconserved operators in $1$D spin chains by directly minimising their commutator\nwith the Hamiltonian. We demonstrate the existence of an extensively large set\nof local integrals of motion in the many-body localised phase of the disordered\nXXZ spin chain. These operators are shown to have exponentially decaying tails,\nin contrast to the ergodic phase where the decay is (at best) polynomial in the\nsize of the subsystem. We study the algebraic properties of localised\noperators, and confirm that in the many-body localised phase they are\nwell-described by \"dressed\" spin operators.\n", "  We demonstrate coherent control of both the rotational and hyperfine state of\nultracold, chemically stable $^{87}$Rb$^{133}$Cs molecules with external\nmicrowave fields. We create a sample of ~2000 molecules in the lowest hyperfine\nlevel of the rovibronic ground state N = 0. We measure the transition\nfrequencies to 8 different hyperfine levels of the N = 1 state at two magnetic\nfields ~23 G apart. We determine accurate values of rotational and hyperfine\ncoupling constants that agree well with previous calculations. We observe Rabi\noscillations on each transition, allowing complete population transfer to a\nselected hyperfine level of N = 1. Subsequent application of a second microwave\npulse allows transfer of molecules back to a different hyperfine level of N =\n0.\n", "  We theoretically study the properties of thermal conductance in a\nnormal-insulator-superconductor junction of silicene for both thin and thick\nbarrier limit. We show that while thermal conductance displays the conventional\nexponential dependence on temperature, it manifests a nontrivial oscillatory\ndependence on the strength of the barrier region. The tunability of the thermal\nconductance by an external electric field is also investigated. Moreover, we\nexplore the effect of doping concentration on thermal conductance. In the thin\nbarrier limit, the period of oscillations of the thermal conductance as a\nfunction of the barrier strength comes out be $\\pi/2$ when doping concentration\nin the normal silicene region is small. On the other hand, the period gradually\nconverts to $\\pi$ with the enhancement of the doping concentration. Such change\nof periodicity of the thermal response with doping can be a possible probe to\nidentify the crossover from specular to retro Andreev reflection in Dirac\nmaterials. In the thick barrier limit, thermal conductance exhibits oscillatory\nbehavior as a function of barrier thickness $d$ and barrier height $V_0$ while\nthe period of oscillation becomes $V_0$ dependent. However, amplitude of the\noscillations, unlike in tunneling conductance, gradually decays with the\nincrease of barrier thickness for arbitrary height $V_0$ in the highly doped\nregime. We discuss experimental relevance of our results.\n", "  Very little information has been so far gathered on atomic jets from young\nembedded low mass sources (class I stars), especially in the inner jet region.\nWe exploit multiwave spectroscopic observations to infer physical conditions of\nthe inner region of HH34 IRS, a prototypical class I jet. We use a deep\nX-shooter spectrum ( lambda = 350-2300 nm, R between 8000 and 18000) detecting\nlines with upper energies from 8000 to 31000 cm-1 . Statistical equilibrium and\nionization models are adopted to derive the jet main physical parameters. We\nderive the physical conditions for the extended high velocity jet (HVC, V about\n-100 km/s) and for the low velocity and compact gas (LVC, V about -20-50 \\kms).\nAt the jet base (< 200 AU) the HVC is mostly neutral (x(e)< 0.1) and very dense\n(n(H) > 5x10^5 cm-3). The LVC gas has the same density and A_V as the HVC, but\nit is a factor of two colder. Iron abundance in the HVC is close to solar,\nwhile it is 3 times subsolar in the LVC, suggesting an origin of the LVC gas\nfrom a dusty disk. We infer a jet mass flux rate > 5x10^{-7} Mo/yr. We find\nthat the relationships between accretion luminosity and line luminosity derived\nfor T Tauri stars cannot be directly extended to class I sources surrounded by\nreflection nebulae since the permitted lines are seen through scattered light.\nAn accretion rate of about 7\\,10^{-6} Mo/yr is instead derived from an\nempirical relationship connecting the mass accretion rate with L([OI])(HVC). In\nconclusion, the HH34 IRS jet shares many properties with jets from active CTTs\nstars. It is however denser as a consequence of the larger mass flux rate.\nThese findings suggest that the acceleration and excitation mechanisms in jets\nare not influenced by evolution and are similar in CTTs and in still embedded\nand highly accreting sources.\n", "  We report measurements of the thickness and temperature (T) dependencies of\ncurrent-induced spin-orbit torques, especially the field-like (FL) component,\nin various heavy metal (HM)/normal metal (NM) spacer/ferromagnet (FM)/Oxide\n(MgO and HfOx/MgO) heterostructures. The FL torque in these samples originates\nfrom spin current generated by the spin Hall effect (SHE) in the HM. For a FM\nlayer sufficiently thin that a substantial portion of this spin current can\nreach the FM/Oxide interface, T-dependent spin scattering there can yield a\nstrong FL torque that is, in some cases, opposite in sign to that exerted at\nthe NM/FM interface.\n", "  We develop a method for deriving approximate analytical formulae to integrate\nphoton geodesics in a Schwarzschild spacetime. Based on this, we derive the\napproximate equations for light bending and propagation delay that have been\nintroduced empirically. We then derive for the first time an approximate\nanalytical equation for the solid angle. We discuss the accuracy and range of\napplicability of the new equations and present a few simple applications of\nthem to known astrophysical problems.\n", "  It is shown, by the means of distributed chaos approach and using the\nexperimental data, that at very large Rayleigh number $Ra > 10^{14}$ and\nPrandtl number $Pr \\sim 1$ the Rayleigh-B\\'{e}nard turbulence can undergo a\ntransition related to spontaneous breaking of the fundamental Lagrangian\nrelabeling symmetry. Due to the Noether's theorem helicity plays central role\nin this process. After the transition the temperature spectrum has a stretched\nexponential form $E (k) \\propto \\exp(-k/k_{\\beta})^{\\beta}$ with $\\beta =2/5$\nboth at the cell midplain and at the near-wall (low boundary) regions. There is\na similarity between this phenomenon and the effects of polymer additives.\n", "  We analyze the two-dimensional photoelectrons momentum distribution of Ar\natom ionized by midinfrared laser pulses and mainly concentrate on the energy\nrange below 2Up. By using a generalized quantum trajectory Monte Carlo (GQTMC)\nsimulation and comparing with the numerical solution of time-dependent\nSchrodinger equation (TDSE), we show that in the deep tunneling regime, the\nrescattered electron trajectories plays unimportant role and the interplay\nbetween the intracycle and inter-cycle results in a ring-like interference\npattern. The ring-like interference pattern will mask the holographic\ninterference structure in the low longitudinal momentum region. When the\nnonadiabatic tunneling contributes significantly to ionization, i.e., the\nKeldysh parameter 1, the contribution of the rescattered electron trajectories\nbecome large, thus holographic interference pattern can be clearly observed.\nOur results help paving the way for gaining physical insight into ultrafast\nelectron dynamic process with attosecond temporal resolution.\n", "  The entanglement entropy for smooth regions $\\cal A$ has a logarithmic\ndivergent contribution with a shape dependent coefficient and that for regions\nwith conical singularities an additional $\\log ^2$ term. Comparing the\ncoefficient of this extra term, obtained by direct holographic calculation for\nan infinite cone, with the corresponding limiting case for the shape dependent\ncoefficient for a regularised cone, a mismatch by a factor two has been\nobserved in the literature. We discuss several aspects of this issue. In\nparticular a regularisation of $\\cal A$, intrinsically delivered by the\nholographic picture, is proposed and applied to an example of a compact region\nwith two conical singularities. Finally, the mismatch is removed in all studied\nregularisations of $\\cal A$, if equal scale ratios are chosen for the limiting\nprocedure.\n", "  In the cosmic web, galaxy superclusters or their high-density cores are the\nlargest objects that may collapse at present or during the future evolution. We\nstudy the dynamical state and possible future evolution of galaxy superclusters\nfrom the Sloan Great Wall (SGW), the richest galaxy system in the nearby\nUniverse. We calculated supercluster masses using dynamical masses of galaxy\ngroups and stellar masses of galaxies. We employed normal mixture modelling to\nstudy the structure of rich SGW superclusters and search for components (cores)\nin superclusters. We analysed the radial mass distribution in the high-density\ncores of superclusters centred approximately at rich clusters and used the\nspherical collapse model to study their dynamical state. We found that the\nlower limit of the total mass of the SGW is approximately $M =\n2.5\\times~10^{16}h^{-1}M_\\odot$. Different mass estimators of superclusters\nagree well, the main uncertainties in masses of superclusters come from missing\ngroups and clusters. We detected three high-density cores in the richest SGW\nsupercluster (SCl~027) and two in the second richest supercluster (SCl~019).\nThey have masses of $1.2 - 5.9 \\times~10^{15}h^{-1}M_\\odot$ and sizes of up to\n$\\approx 60 h^{-1}$ Mpc. The high-density cores of superclusters are very\nelongated, flattened perpendicularly to the line of sight. The comparison of\nthe radial mass distribution in the high-density cores with the predictions of\nspherical collapse model suggests that their central regions with radii smaller\nthan $8 h^{-1}$Mpc and masses of up to $M = 2\\times~10^{15}h^{-1}M_\\odot$ may\nbe collapsing. The rich SGW superclusters with their high-density cores\nrepresent dynamically evolving environments for studies of the properties of\ngalaxies and galaxy systems.\n", "  Neutrino-pair production and annihilation through nucleon-nucleon\nbremsstrahlung is included in current supernova simulations by rates that are\nbased on the one-pion-exchange approximation. Here we explore the consequences\nof bremsstrahlung rates based on a modern nuclear interactions for\nproto-neutron star cooling and the corresponding neutrino emission. We find\nthat despite a reduction of the bremsstrahlung emission by a factor of 2-5 in\nthe neutrinospheric region, models with the improved treatment exhibit only\n$\\lesssim$5% changes of the neutrino luminosities and an increase of\n$\\lesssim$0.7 MeV of the average energies of the radiated neutrino spectra,\nwith the largest effects for the antineutrinos of all flavors and at late\ntimes. Overall, the proto-neutron star cooling evolution is slowed down\nmodestly by $\\lesssim$0.5-1 s.\n", "  Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) imaging of radio emission from\nextragalactic jets provides a unique probe of physical mechanisms governing the\nlaunching, acceleration, and collimation of relativistic outflows. The\ntwo-dimensional structure and kinematics of the jet in M\\,87 (NGC\\,4486) have\nbeen studied by applying the Wavelet-based Image Segmentation and Evaluation\n(WISE) method to 11 images obtained from multi-epoch Very Long Baseline Array\n(VLBA) observations made in January-August 2007 at 43 GHz ($\\lambda = 7$ mm).\nThe WISE analysis recovers a detailed two-dimensional velocity field in the jet\nin M\\,87 at sub-parsec scales. The observed evolution of the flow velocity with\ndistance from the jet base can be explained in the framework of MHD jet\nacceleration and Poynting flux conversion. A linear acceleration regime is\nobserved up to $z_{obs} \\sim 2$\\,mas. The acceleration is reduced at larger\nscales, which is consistent with saturation of Poynting flux conversion.\nStacked cross correlation analysis of the images reveals a pronounced\nstratification of the flow. The flow consists of a slow, mildly relativistic\nlayer (moving at $\\beta \\sim 0.5\\,c$), associated either with instability\npattern speed or an outer wind, and a fast, accelerating stream line (with\n$\\beta \\sim 0.92$, corresponding to a bulk Lorentz factor $\\gamma \\sim 2.5$). A\nsystematic difference of the apparent speeds in the northern and southern limbs\nof the jet is detected, providing evidence for jet rotation. The angular\nvelocity of the magnetic field line associated with this rotation suggests that\nthe jet in M87 is launched in the inner part of the disk, at a distance $r_0\n\\sim 5\\, R_\\mathrm{s}$ from the central engine. The combined results of the\nanalysis imply that MHD acceleration and conversion of Poynting flux to kinetic\nenergy play the dominant roles in collimation and acceleration of the flow in\nM\\,87.\n", "  We propose to use spin hydrodynamics, a two-fluid model of spin propagation,\nas a generalization of the diffusion equation. We show that in the dense limit\nspin hydrodynamics reduces to Fick's law and the diffusion equation. In the\nopposite limit spin hydrodynamics is equivalent to a collisionless Boltzmann\ntreatment of spin propagation. Spin hydrodynamics avoids unphysical effects\nthat arise when the diffusion equation is used to describe to a strongly\ninteracting gas with a dilute corona. We apply spin hydrodynamics to the\nproblem of spin diffusion in a trapped atomic gas. We find that the observed\nspin relaxation rate in the high temperature limit [Sommer et al., Nature 472,\n201 (2011)] is consistent with the diffusion constant predicted by kinetic\ntheory.\n", "  We develop and study the position-dependent bispectrum. It is a\ngeneralization of the recently proposed position-dependent power spectrum\nmethod of measuring the squeezed-limit bispectrum. The position-dependent\nbispectrum can similarly be used to measure the squeezed-limit trispectrum in\nwhich one of the wavelengths is much longer than the other three. In this work,\nwe will mainly consider the case in which the three smaller wavelengths are\nnearly the same (the equilateral configuration). We use the Fisher information\nmatrix to forecast constraints on bias parameters and the amplitude of\nprimordial trispectra from the position-dependent bispectrum method. We find\nthat the method can constrain the local-type $g_{\\rm NL}$ at a level of\n$\\sigma(g_{\\rm NL}^{\\rm local}) \\approx 3 \\times 10^5$ for a large volume\nSPHEREx-like survey; improvements can be expected by including all the\ntriangular configurations of the bispectra rather than just the equilateral\nconfiguration. However, the same measurement would also constrain a much larger\nfamily of trispectra than local $g_{\\rm NL}$ model. We discuss the implications\nof the forecasted reach of future surveys in terms of super cosmic variance\nuncertainties from primordial non-Gaussianities.\n", "  The calculations of electronic transport coefficients and optical properties\nrequire a very dense interpolation of the electronic band structure in\nreciprocal space that is computationally expensive and may have issues with\nband crossing and degeneracies. Capitalizing on a recently developed\npseudo-atomic orbital projection technique, we exploit the exact tight-binding\nrepresentation of the first principles electronic structure for the purposes of\n(1) providing an efficient strategy to explore the full band structure\n$E_n({\\bf k})$, (2) computing the momentum operator differentiating directly\nthe Hamiltonian, and (3) calculating the imaginary part of the dielectric\nfunction. This enables us to determine the Boltzmann transport coefficients and\nthe optical properties within the independent particle approximation. In\naddition, the local nature of the tight-binding representation facilitates the\ncalculation of the ballistic transport within the Landauer theory for systems\nwith hundreds of atoms. In order to validate our approach we study the\nmulti-valley band structure of CoSb$_3$ and a large core-shell nanowire using\nthe ACBN0 functional. In CoSb$_3$ we point the many band minima contributing to\nthe electronic transport that enhance the thermoelectric properties; for the\ncore-shell nanowire we identify possible mechanisms for photo-current\ngeneration and justify the presence of protected transport channels in the\nwire.\n", "  Forward single $\\pi^0$ production by coherent neutral-current interactions,\n$\\nu \\mathcal{A} \\to \\nu \\mathcal{A} \\pi^0$, is investigated using a 2.8$\\times\n10^{20}$ protons-on-target exposure of the MINOS Near Detector. For\nsingle-shower topologies, the event distribution in production angle exhibits a\nclear excess above the estimated background at very forward angles for visible\nenergy in the range~1-8 GeV. Cross sections are obtained for the detector\nmedium comprised of 80% iron and 20% carbon nuclei with $\\langle \\mathcal{A}\n\\rangle = 48$, the highest-$\\langle \\mathcal{A} \\rangle$ target used to date in\nthe study of this coherent reaction. The total cross section for coherent\nneutral-current single-$\\pi^0$ production initiated by the $\\nu_\\mu$ flux of\nthe NuMI low-energy beam with mean (mode) $E_{\\nu}$ of 4.9 GeV (3.0 GeV), is\n$77.6\\pm5.0\\,(\\text{stat})\n^{+15.0}_{-16.8}\\,(\\text{syst})\\times10^{-40}\\,\\text{cm}^2~\\text{per nucleus}$.\nThe results are in good agreement with predictions of the Berger-Sehgal model.\n", "  We study here a complete quantization of a Callan-Giddings-Harvey-Strominger\n(CGHS) vacuum model following loop quantum gravity techniques. Concretely, we\nadopt a formulation of the model in terms of a set of new variables that\nresemble the ones commonly employed in spherically symmetric loop quantum\ngravity. The classical theory consists of two pairs of canonical variables plus\na scalar and diffeomorphism (first class) constraints. We consider a suitable\nredefinition of the Hamiltonian constraint such that the new constraint algebra\n(with structure constants) is well adapted to the Dirac quantization approach.\nFor it, we adopt a polymeric representation for both the geometry and the\ndilaton field. On the one hand, we find a suitable invariant domain of the\nscalar constraint operator, and we construct explicitly its solution space.\nThere, the eigenvalues of the dilaton and the metric operators cannot vanish\nlocally, allowing us to conclude that singular geometries are ruled out in the\nquantum theory. On the other hand, the physical Hilbert space is constructed\nout of them, after group averaging the previous states with the diffeomorphism\nconstraint. In turn, we identify the standard observable corresponding to the\nmass of the black hole at the boundary, in agreement with the classical theory.\nWe also construct an additional observable on the bulk associated with the\nsquare of the dilaton field, with no direct classical analog.\n", "  Qatar-1b is a close-orbiting hot Jupiter ($R_p\\simeq 1.18$ $R_J$, $M_p\\simeq\n1.33$ $M_J$) around a metal-rich K-dwarf, with orbital separation and period of\n0.023 AU and 1.42 days. We have observed the secondary eclipse of this\nexoplanet in the Ks band with the objective of deriving a brightness\ntemperature for the planet and providing further constraints to the orbital\nconfiguration of the system. We obtained near-infrared photometric data from\nthe ground by using the OMEGA2000 instrument at the 3.5 m telescope at Calar\nAlto (Spain) in staring mode, with the telescope defocused. We have used\nprincipal component analysis (PCA) to identify correlated systematic trends in\nthe data. A Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis was performed to model the\ncorrelated systematics and fit for the secondary eclipse of Qatar-1b using a\npreviously developed occultation model. We adopted the prayer bead method to\nassess the effect of red noise on the derived parameters. We measured a\nsecondary eclipse depth of $0.196\\%^{+0.071\\%}_{-0.051\\%}$, which indicates a\nbrightness temperature in the Ks band for the planet of $1885^{+212}_{-168}$ K.\nWe also measured a small deviation in the central phase of the secondary\neclipse of $-0.0079^{+0.0162}_{-0.0043}$, which leads to a value for\n$e\\cos{\\omega}$ of $-0.0123^{+0.0252}_{-0.0067}$. However, this last result\nneeds to be confirmed with more data.\n", "  We present the first observation of cluster-scale radial metallicity\ngradients from star-forming galaxies. We use the DEIMOS spectrograph on the\nKeck II telescope to observe two CLASH clusters at z~0.35: MACS1115+0129 and\nRXJ1532+3021. Based on our measured interstellar medium (ISM) properties of\nstar-forming galaxies out to a radius of 2.5 Mpc from the cluster centre, we\nfind that the galaxy metallicity decreases as a function of projected\ncluster-centric distance (-0.15+/-0.08 dex/Mpc) in MACS1115+01. On the\nmass-metallicity relation (MZR), star-forming galaxies in MACS1115+01 are\noffset to higher metallicity (~0.2 dex) than the local SDSS galaxies at a fixed\nmass range. In contrast, the MZR of RXJ1532+30 is consistent with the local\ncomparison sample. RXJ1532+30 exhibits a bimodal radial metallicity\ndistribution, with one branch showing a similar negative gradient as\nMACS1115+01 (-0.14+/-0.05 dex/Mpc) and the other branch showing a positive\nradial gradient. The positive gradient branch in RXJ1532+30 is likely caused by\neither interloper galaxies or an in-plane merger, indicating that cluster-scale\nabundance gradients probe cluster substructures and thus the dynamical state of\na cluster. Most strikingly, we discover that neither the radial metallicity\ngradient nor the offset from the MZR is driven by the stellar mass. We compare\nour observations with Rhapsody-G cosmological hydrodynamical zoom-in\nsimulations of relaxed galaxy clusters and find that the simulated galaxy\ncluster also exhibits a negative abundance gradient, albeit with a shallower\nslope (-0.04+/-0.03 dex/Mpc). Our observations suggest that the negative radial\ngradient originates from ram-pressure stripping and/or strangulation processes\nin the cluster environments.\n", "  We present radio follow-up observations carried out with the Karl G. Jansky\nVery Large Array during the first observing run (O1) of the Advanced Laser\nInterferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO). A total of three\ngravitational wave triggers were followed up during the ~4 months of O1, from\nSeptember 2015 to January 2016. Two of these triggers, GW150914 and GW151226,\nare binary black hole merger events of high significance. A third trigger,\nG194575, was subsequently declared as an event of no interest (i.e., a false\nalarm). Our observations targeted selected optical transients identified by the\nintermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF) in the Advanced LIGO error\nregions of the three triggers, and a limited region of the gravitational wave\nlocalization area of G194575 not accessible to optical telescopes due to Sun\nconstraints, where a possible high-energy transient was identified. No\nplausible radio counterparts to GW150914 and GW151226 were found, in agreement\nwith expectations for binary black hole mergers. We show that combining optical\nand radio observations is key to identifying contaminating radio sources that\nmay be found in the follow-up of gravitational wave triggers, such as emission\nassociated to star formation and AGN. We discuss our results in the context of\nthe theoretical predictions for radio counterparts to gravitational wave\ntransients, and describe our future plans for the radio follow-up of Advanced\nLIGO (and Virgo) triggers.\n", "  Our study is meant to extend our knowledge of the galaxy color and luminosity\nsegregation in velocity space (VCS and VLS, resp.), to clusters at intermediate\nand high redshift. Our sample is a collection of 41 clusters in the 0.4<~z<~1.5\nredshift range, for a total of 4172 galaxies, 1674 member galaxies within 2R200\nwith photometric or spectroscopic information, as taken from the literature. We\npay attention to perform homogeneous procedures to select cluster members,\ncompute global cluster properties, in particular the LOS velocity dispersion\nsigmaV, and separate blue from red galaxies. We find evidence of VCS in\nclusters out to z~0.8 (at the 97%-99.99% c.l., depending on the test), in the\nsense that the blue galaxy population has a 10-20% larger sigmaV than the red\ngalaxy population. Poor or no VCS is found in the High-z sample at z>=0.8. For\nthe first time, we detect VLS in non-local clusters and confirm that VLS only\naffects the very luminous galaxies, with brighter galaxies having lower\nvelocities. The threshold magnitude of VLS is ~m3+0.5, where m3 is the\nmagnitude of the third brightest cluster galaxy, and current data suggest that\nthe threshold value moves to fainter magnitudes at higher redshift. We also\ndetect (marginal) evidence of VLS for blue galaxies. We conclude that the\nsegregation effects, when their study is extended to distant clusters, can be\nimportant tracers of the galaxy evolution and cluster assembly and discuss the\npoor/no evidence of VCS at high redshift.\n", "  We propose a mathematical model for the recently introduced angulon. In our\nformulation, the angulon operator is decomposable relative to the field of\nHilbert spaces over the probability measure space. That is, we transfer the\npopulation of phonons from the inner structure of the many-body Hamiltonian to\nthe definition of the measure. We do not compute the measure itself. However,\nwe demonstrate that the approach allows us to perform angular reduction thereby\nconsiderably simplifying the spectral analysis.\n", "  Radio galaxies classified as X-shaped/winged, are characterised by two pairs\nof extended and misaligned lobes, which suggest a rapid realignment of the jet\naxis, for which a potential cause is still under debate. Here we analyse the\ncomplex radio structure of 3C 293 winged source hosted by the post-merger\ngalaxy, which uniquely displays a significant asymmetry between the sizes of\nthe two pairs of lobes, indicating that an episode of jet realignment took\nplace only very recently. Based on all the available radio data for 3C 293, we\nhave performed a detailed spectral modelling for the older and younger lobes in\nthe system. In this way we derived the lobes' ages and jet energetics, which we\nthen compared to the accretion power in the source. We found that the 200\nkpc-scale outer lobes of 3C 293 are ~60 Myr old and that jet activity related\nto the formation of the outer lobes ceased within the last Myr. Meanwhile, the\ninner 4 kpc-scale lobes, tilted by ~40 deg with respect to the outer ones, are\nonly about ~0.3 Myr old. The best model fits also return identical values of\nthe jet power supplying the outer and the inner structures. This power is of\nthe order of the maximum kinetic luminosity of a Blandford-Znajek jet for a\ngiven black hole mass and accretion rate, but only in the case of relatively\nlow values of a black hole spin, a~0.2. The derived jet energetics and\ntimescales, along with the presence of two optical nuclei in 3C 293, all\nprovide a strong support to the Lense-Thirring precession model in which the\nsupermassive black hole spin, and therefore the jet axis, flips rapidly owing\nto the interactions with the tilted accretion disk in a new tidal interaction\nepisode of the merging process. We further speculate that, in general, X-shape\nradio morphology forms in post-merger systems that are rich in cold molecular\ngas, and only host slowly spinning supermassive black holes.\n", "  Helioseismology has revealed that the angular velocity of the Sun increases\nwith depth in the outermost 35 Mm of the Sun. Recently, we have shown that the\nlogarithmic radial gradient ($\\rm d\\ln\\Omega/\\rm d\\ln r $) in the upper 10~Mm\nis close to $-1$ from the equator to $60^\\circ$ latitude.We aim to measure the\ntemporal variation of the rotational shear over solar cycle 23 and the rising\nphase of cycle 24 (1996-2015). We used f mode frequency splitting data spanning\n1996 to 2011 from the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) and 2010 to 2015 from the\nHelioseismic Magnetic Imager (HMI). In a first for such studies, the f mode\nfrequency splitting data were obtained from 360-day time series. We used the\nsame method as in our previous work for measuring $\\rm d\\ln\\Omega/d\\ln r $ from\nthe equator to $80^\\circ$ latitude in the outer 13~Mm of the Sun. Then, we\ncalculated the variation of the gradient at annual cadence relative to the\naverage over 1996 to 2015. We found the rotational shear at low latitudes\n($0^\\circ$ to $30^\\circ$) to vary in-phase with the solar activity, varying by\n$\\sim \\pm 10$\\% over the period 1996 to 2015. At high latitudes ($60^\\circ$ to\n$80^\\circ$), we found rotational shear to vary in anti-phase with the solar\nactivity. By comparing the radial gradient obtained from the splittings of the\n360-day and the corresponding 72-day time series of HMI and MDI data, we\nsuggest that the splittings obtained from the 72-day HMI time series suffer\nfrom systematic errors. We provide a quantitative measurement of the temporal\nvariation of the outer part of the near surface shear layer which may provide\nuseful constraints on dynamo models and differential rotation theory.\n", "  We study the monopole (breathing) mode of a finite temperature Bose-Einstein\ncondensate in an isotropic harmonic trap recently developed by Lobser et al.\n[Nat.~Phys., \\textbf{11}, 1009 (2015)]. We observe a nonexponential collapse of\nthe amplitude of the condensate oscillation followed by a partial revival. This\nbehavior is identified as being due to beating between two eigenmodes of the\nsystem, corresponding to in-phase and out-of-phase oscillations of the\ncondensed and noncondensed fractions of the gas. We perform finite temperature\nsimulations of the system dynamics using the Zaremba-Nikuni-Griffin methodology\n[J.~Low Temp.~Phys., \\textbf{116}, 277 (1999)], and find good agreement with\nthe data, thus confirming the two mode description.\n", "  We systematically elucidate differences and similarities of the vacuum\nalignment issue in composite and renormalizable elementary extensions of the\nStandard Model featuring a pseudo-Goldstone Higgs. We also provide general\nconditions for the stability of the vacuum in the elementary framework, thereby\nextending previous studies of the vacuum alignment.\n", "  Quantum Hall effects offer a formidable playground for the investigation of\nquantum transport phenomena. Edge modes can be detected, branched, and mixed by\ndesigning a suitable potential landscape in a two-dimensional conducting system\nsubject to a strong magnetic field. In the present work, we demonstrate a\nburied split-gate architecture and use it to control electron conduction in\nlarge-scale single-crystal monolayer graphene grown by chemical vapor\ndeposition. The control of the edge trajectories is demonstrated by the\nobservation of various fractional quantum resistances, as a result of a\ncontrollable inter-edge scattering. Experimental data are successfully modeled\nboth numerically and within the Landauer-Buettiker formalism. Our architecture\nis particularly promising and unique in view of the investigation of quantum\ntransport via scanning probe microscopy, since graphene constitutes the topmost\nlayer of the device. For this reason, it can be approached and perturbed by a\nscanning probe down to the limit of mechanical contact.\n", "  We report the results of a directed search for continuous gravitational-wave\nemission in a broad frequency range (between 50 and 1000 Hz) from the central\ncompact object of the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A (Cas A). The data comes\nfrom the sixth science run of LIGO and the search is performed on the volunteer\ndistributed computing network Einstein@Home. We find no significant signal\ncandidate, and set the most constraining upper limits to date on the\ngravitational-wave emission from Cas A, which beat the indirect age-based upper\nlimit across the entire search range. At around 170 Hz (the most sensitive\nfrequency range), we set 90% confidence upper limits on the gravitational wave\namplitude $h_0$ of $\\sim\\!\\!~2.9\\times 10^{-25}$, roughly twice as constraining\nas the upper limits from previous searches on Cas A. The upper limits can also\nbe expressed as constraints on the ellipticity of Cas A; with a few reasonable\nassumptions, we show that at gravitational-wave frequencies greater than\n300~Hz, we can exclude an ellipticity of $\\gtrsim\\!\\!~10^{-5}$.\n", "  Protostellar evolution, following the formation of the protostar is becoming\nreasonably well characterized, but the evolution from a prestellar core to a\nprotostar is not well known, although the first hydrostatic core (FHSC) must be\na pivotal step. NGC 1333 IRAS 4C is a potentially very young object, that we\ndirectly compare with the nearby Class 0 IRAS 4A and IRAS 4B. Observational\nconstraints are provided by spectral imaging from the JCMT Spectral Legacy\nSurvey (330-373 GHz) and continuum and line observations from CARMA. We present\nintegrated intensity and velocity maps of several species, including CO, H2CO\nand CH3OH. The velocity of an observed outflow, the degree of CO depletion, the\ndeuteration of DCO+/HCO+ and gas kinetic temperatures are observational\nsignatures that we present. We report differences between the three sources in\nfour aspects: a) the kinetic temperature is much lower towards IRAS 4C, b) the\nline profiles of the detected species show strong outflow activity towards IRAS\n4A and IRAS 4B but not towards IRAS 4C, c) the HCN/HNC is < 1 towards IRAS 4C,\nwhich confirms the cold nature of the source, d) the degree of CO depletion and\nthe deuteration are the lowest towards the warmest of the sources, IRAS 4B.\nIRAS 4C seems to be in a different evolutionary state than the IRAS 4A and IRAS\n4B sources. We can probably exclude the FHSC stage due to the relatively low\nLsmm/Lbol (~6\\%) and we investigate the earliest accretion phase of Class 0\nstage and the transition between Class 0 to Class I. Our results do not show a\nconsistent scenario for either case, with the major issue being the absence of\noutflow activity and the cold nature of IRAS 4C. The number of FHSC candidates\nin Perseus is ~10 times higher than current models predict, which suggests that\nthe lifespan of these objects is greater than 1000 years, possibly due to an\naccretion rate lower than 4x10^-5 msun/yr.\n", "  We provide a simple derivation of the equivalence between Einstein and\nConformal Gravity (CG) with Neumann boundary conditions given by Maldacena. As\nEinstein spacetimes are Bach flat, a generic solution to CG would contain both\nEinstein and non-Einstein part. Using this decomposition of the spacetime\ncurvature in the Weyl tensor, makes manifest the equivalence between the two\ntheories, both at the level of the action and the variation of it. As a\nconsequence, we show that the on-shell action for Critical Gravity in four\ndimensions is given uniquely in terms of the Bach tensor.\n", "  Massive stars have a major influence on their environment yet their formation\nis difficult to study. W43 is a highly luminous galactic massive star forming\nregion at a distance of 5.5 kpc and the MM1 part hosts a very massive dense\ncore (1000 M$_{\\odot}$ within 0.05 pc). We present new Herschel HIFI maps of\nthe W43 MM1 region covering the main low-energy water lines at 557, 987, and\n1113 GHz, their H$_2^{18}$O counterparts, and other lines such as\n$^{13}$CO(10-9) and C$^{18}$O(9-8) which trace warm gas. These water lines are,\nwith the exception of line wings, observed in absorption. Herschel SPIRE and\nJCMT 450 $\\mu$m data have been used to make a model of the continuum emission\nat these wavelengths. Analysis of the maps, and in particular the optical depth\nmaps of each line and feature, shows that a velocity gradient, possibly due to\nrotation, is present in both the envelope and the protostellar core. Velocities\nincrease in both components from SW to NE, following the general source\norientation. While the H$_2$O lines trace essentially the cool envelope, we\nshow that the envelope cannot account for the H$_2^{18}$O absorption, which\ntraces motions close to the protostar. The core has rapid infall, 2.9 kms, as\nmanifested by the H$_2^{18}$O absorption features which are systematically\nred-shifted with respect to the $^{13}$CO(10-9) emission line which also traces\nthe inner material with the same angular resolution. Some H$_2^{18}$O\nabsorption is detected outside the central core and thus outside the regions\nexpected to be above 100 K - we attribute this to warm gas associated with the\nother massive dense cores in W43 MM1. Using the maps to identify absorption\nfrom cool gas on large scales, we subtract this component to model spectra for\nthe inner envelope. Modeling the new spectra results in a lower water\nabundance, decreased from $8 10^{-8}$ to $8 10^{-9}$ , with no change in infall\nrate.\n", "  The response of a NE-213 liquid-scintillator detector has been measured using\ntagged neutrons from 2--6 MeV originating from an Am/Be neutron source. The\nneutron energies were determined using the time-of-flight technique.\nPulse-shape discrimination was employed to discern between gamma-rays and\nneutrons. The behavior of both the fast (35 ns) and the combined fast and slow\n(475 ns) components of the neutron scintillation-light pulses were studied.\nThree different prescriptions were used to relate the neutron maximum\nenergy-transfer edges to the corresponding recoil-proton scintillation-light\nyields, and the results were compared to simulations. Parametrizations which\npredict the fast or total light yield of the scintillation pulses were also\ntested. Our results agree with both existing data and existing\nparametrizations. We observe a clear sensitivity to the portion and length of\nthe neutron scintillation-light pulse considered.\n", "  We present a complete discussion of the boundary term in the action\nfunctional of general relativity when the boundary includes null segments in\naddition to the more usual timelike and spacelike segments. We confirm that\nambiguities appear in the contribution from a null segment, because it depends\non an arbitrary choice of parametrization for the generators. We also show that\nsimilar ambiguities appear in the contribution from a codimension-two surface\nat which a null segment is joined to another (spacelike, timelike, or null)\nsegment. The parametrization ambiguity can be tamed by insisting that the null\ngenerators be affinely parametrized; this forces each null contribution to the\nboundary action to vanish, but leaves intact the fredom to rescale the affine\nparameter by a constant factor on each generator. Once a choice of\nparametrization is made, the ambiguity in the joint contributions can be\neliminated by formulating well-motivated rules that ensure the additivity of\nthe gravitational action. Enforcing these rules, we calculate the time rate of\nchange of the action when it is evaluated for a so-called \"Wheeler-deWitt\npatch\" of a black hole in asymptotically-anti de Sitter space. We recover a\nnumber of results cited in the literature, obtained with a less complete\nanalysis.\n", "  To gain a more complete understanding of the dynamics of the GK Per (1901)\nremnant faint-object high-resolution echelle spectroscopic observations and\nimaging were undertaken covering the knots which comprise the nova shell and\nthe surrounding nebulosity. New imaging from the Aristarchos telescope in\nGreece and long-slit spectra from the MES instrument at the San Pedro Martir\nobservatory in Mexico were obtained, supplemented with archival observations\nfrom several other optical telescopes. Position-velocity arrays are produced of\nthe shell, and also individual knots, and are then used for morpho-kinematic\nmodelling with the shape code. Evidence is found for the interaction of knots\nwith each other and with a wind component, most likely the periodic fast wind\nemanating from the central binary system. We find that a cylindrical shell with\na lower velocity polar structure gives the best model fit to the spectroscopy\nand imaging. We show in this work that the previously seen jet-like feature is\nof low velocity. The individual knots have irregular tail shapes; we propose\nhere that they emanate from episodic winds from ongoing dwarf nova outbursts by\nthe central system. The nova shell is cylindrical and the symmetry axis relates\nto the inclination of the central binary system. Furthermore, the cylinder axis\nis aligned with the long axis of the bipolar planetary nebula in which it is\nembedded. Thus, the central binary system is responsible for the bipolarity of\nthe planetary nebula and the cylindrical nova shell. The gradual planetary\nnebula ejecta versus sudden nova ejecta is the reason for the different degrees\nof bipolarity. We propose that the 'jet' feature is an illuminated lobe of the\nfossil planetary nebula that surrounds the nova shell.\n", "  We present a class of models in the framework of gauge mediation\nsupersymmetry breaking where the messenger fields transform in the adjoint\nrepresentation of the Standard Model gauge symmetry. To avoid unacceptably\nlight right-handed sleptons in the spectrum we introduce a non-zero U(1)_B-L\nD-term. This leads to an additional contribution to the soft supersymmetry\nbreaking mass terms which makes the right-handed slepton masses compatible with\nthe current experimental bounds. We show that in this framework the observed\n125 GeV Higgs boson mass can be accommodated with the sleptons accessible at\nthe LHC, while the squarks and gluinos lie in the multi-TeV range. We also\ndiscuss the issue of the fine-tuning and show that the desired relic dark\nmatter abundance can also be accommodated.\n", "  We introduce a new loop expansion that provides a resolution of the identity\nin the Hilbert space of loop quantum gravity on a fixed graph. We work in the\nbosonic representation obtained by the canonical quantization of the spinorial\nformalism. The resolution of the identity gives a tool for implementing the\nprojection of states in the full bosonic representation onto the space of\nsolutions to the Gauss and area matching constraints of loop quantum gravity.\nThis procedure is particularly efficient in the semiclassical regime, leading\nto explicit expressions for the loop expansions of coherent, heat kernel and\nsqueezed states.\n", "  The defect of a complex Hadamard matrix $H$ is an upper bound for the\ndimension of a continuous Hadamard orbit stemming from $H$. We provide a new\ninterpretation of the defect as the dimension of the center subspace of a\ngradient flow and apply the Center Manifold Theorem of dynamical systems theory\nto study local structure in spaces of complex Hadamard matrices. Through\nexamples, we provide several applications of our methodology including the\nconstruction of affine families of Hadamard matrices.\n", "  Using CO (4-3) and (2-1) Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) data, we prove\nthat the molecular gas in the jet-driven winds of the galaxy IC5063 is more\nhighly excited than the rest of the molecular gas in the disk of the same\ngalaxy. On average, the CO(4-3)/CO(2-1) flux ratio is 1 for the disk and 5 for\nthe jet accelerated or impacted gas. Spatially-resolved maps reveal that in\nregions associated with winds, the CO(4-3)/CO(2-1) flux ratio significantly\nexceeds the upper limit of 4 for optically thick gas. It frequently takes\nvalues between 5 and 11, and it occasionally further approaches the upper limit\nof 16 for optically thin gas. Excitation temperatures of 30-100 K are common\nfor the molecules in these regions. If all of the outflowing molecular gas is\noptically thin, at 30-50 K, then its mass is 2*10^6 M_sun. This lower mass\nlimit is an order of magnitude below the mass derived from the CO(2-1) flux in\nthe case of optically thick gas. Molecular winds can thus be less massive, but\nmore easily detectable at high z than they were previously thought to be.\n", "  We study the effect of an external harmonic trapping potential on an outcome\nof the non-adiabatic quantum phase transition from an antiferromagnetic to a\nphase-separated state in a spin-1 atomic condensate. Previously, we\ndemonstrated that the dynamics of an untrapped system exhibits double\nuniversality with two different scaling laws appearing due to conservation of\nmagnetization. We show that in the presence of a trap double universality\npersists. However, the corresponding scaling exponents are strongly modified by\ntransfer of local magnetization across the system. The values of these\nexponents cannot be explained by the effect of causality alone, as in the\nspinless case. We derive the appropriate scaling laws based on a slow\ndiffusive-drift relaxation process in the local density approximation.\n", "  We present a new, semi-analytic framework for estimating the level of\nresiduals present in CMB maps derived from multi-frequency Cosmic Microwave\nBackground (CMB) data and forecasting their impact on cosmological parameters.\nThe data are assumed to contain non-negligible signals of astrophysical and/or\nGalactic origin, which we clean using parametric component separation\ntechnique. We account for discrepancies between the foreground model assumed\nduring the separation procedure and the true one, allowing for differences in\nscaling laws and/or their spatial variations. Our estimates and their\nuncertainties include both systematic and statistical effects and are averaged\nover the instrumental noise and CMB signal realizations. The framework can be\nfurther extended to account self-consistently for existing uncertainties in the\nforeground models. We demonstrate and validate the framework on simple study\ncases which aim at estimating the tensor-to-scalar ratio, r. The proposed\napproach is computationally efficient permitting an investigation of hundreds\nof set-ups and foreground models on a single CPU.\n", "  We have analyzed the singularities of a triangle loop integral in detail and\nderived a formula for an easy evaluation of the triangle singularity on the\nphysical boundary. It is applied to the $\\Lambda_b \\rightarrow J/\\psi K^{-} p$\nprocess via $\\Lambda^*$-charmonium-proton intermediate states. Although the\nevaluation of absolute rates is not possible, we identify the $\\chi_{c1}$ and\nthe $\\psi(2S)$ as the relatively most relevant states among all possible\ncharmonia up to the $\\psi(2S)$. The $\\Lambda(1890)\\, \\chi_{c1}\\, p$ loop is\nvery special as its normal threshold and triangle singularities merge at about\n4.45 GeV, generating a narrow and prominent peak in the amplitude in the case\nthat the $\\chi_{c1}\\, p$ is in an $S$-wave. We also see that loops with the\nsame charmonium and other $\\Lambda^*$ hyperons produce less dramatic peaks from\nthe threshold singularity alone. For the case of $\\chi_{c1}\\, p \\rightarrow\nJ/\\psi\\, p$ and quantum numbers $3/2^-$ or $5/2^+$ one needs $P$- and\n$D$-waves, respectively, in the $\\chi_{c1}\\, p$, which drastically reduce the\nstrength of the contribution and smooth the threshold peak. In this case we\nconclude that the singularities cannot account for the observed narrow peak. In\nthe case of $1/2^+$, $3/2^+$ quantum numbers, where $\\chi_{c1}\\, p \\rightarrow\nJ/\\psi\\, p$ can proceed in an $S$-wave, the $\\Lambda(1890)\\,\\chi_{c1}\\,p$\ntriangle diagram could play an important role, though can neither assert their\nstrength without further input from experiments and lattice QCD calculations.\n", "  We study the vacuum (i.e., zero-temperature) Casimir energy for a system of\nneutral conductors which are isolated, as opposed to grounded. The former is\nmeant to describe a situation where the total charge on each conductor, as well\nas all of its fluctuations, vanishes, while the latter describes a situation\nwhere the conductors are connected to a charge reservoir. We compute the\ndifference between the vacuum energies for a given system of conductors, but\nsubjected to the two different conditions stated above. The results can be\nwritten in terms of a generalized, frequency-dependent capacitance matrix of\nthe system. Using a multipolar expansion, we show that the grounded Casimir\nenergy includes a monopole-monopole interaction term that is absent in the\nisolated case in the large distance limit\n", "  Knowing the distribution of stellar rotational velocities is essential for\nthe understanding stellar evolution. Because we measure the projected\nrotational speed vsini, we need to solve an ill-posed problem given by a\nFredholm integral of the first kind to recover the true rotational velocity\ndistribution. After discretization of the Fredholm integral, we apply the\nTikhonov regularization method to obtain directly the probability distribution\nfunction for stellar rotational velocities. We propose a simple and\nstraightforward procedure to determine the Tikhonov parameter. We applied Monte\nCarlo simulations to prove that Tikhonov method is a consistent estimator and\nasymptotically unbiased. This method is applied to a sample of cluster stars.\nWe obtain confidences intervals using bootstrap method. Our results are in good\nagreement with the one obtained using the Lucy method, in recovering the\nprobability density distribution of rotational velocities. Furthermore, Lucy\nestimation lies inside our confidence interval. Tikhonov regularization is a\nvery robust method that deconvolve the rotational velocity probability density\nfunction from a sample of vsini data straightforward without needing any\nconvergence criteria.\n", "  Standard galaxy formation models predict that large-scale double-lobed radio\nsources, known as DRAGNs, will always be hosted by elliptical galaxies. In\nspite of this, in recent years a small number of spiral galaxies have also been\nfound to host such sources. These so-called spiral DRAGNs are still extremely\nrare, with only $\\sim 5$ cases being widely accepted. Here we report on the\nserendipitous discovery of a new spiral DRAGN in data from the Giant Metrewave\nRadio Telescope (GMRT) at 322 MHz. The host galaxy, MCG+07-47-10, is a face-on\nlate-type Sbc galaxy with distinctive spiral arms and prominent bulge\nsuggesting a high black hole mass. Using WISE infra-red and GALEX UV data we\nshow that this galaxy has a star formation rate of 0.16-0.75\nM$_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, and that the radio luminosity is dominated by\nstar-formation. We demonstrate that this spiral DRAGN has similar environmental\nproperties to others of this class, but has a comparatively low radio\nluminosity of $L_{\\rm 1.4GHz}$ = 1.12$\\times$10$^{22}$ W Hz$^{-1}$, two orders\nof magnitude smaller than other known spiral DRAGNs. We suggest that this may\nindicate the existence of a previously unknown low-luminosity population of\nspiral DRAGNS.\n", "  Following previous works on generalized Abelian Proca theory, also called\nvector Galileon, we investigate the massive extension of an SU(2) gauge theory,\ni.e., the generalized SU(2) Proca model, which could be dubbed non-Abelian\nvector Galileon. This particular symmetry group permits fruitful applications\nin cosmology such as inflation driven by gauge fields. Our approach consists in\nbuilding, in an exhaustive way, all the Lagrangians containing up to six\ncontracted Lorentz indices. For this purpose, and after identifying by group\ntheoretical considerations all the independent Lagrangians which can be written\nat these orders, we consider the only linear combinations propagating three\ndegrees of freedom and having healthy dynamics for their longitudinal mode,\ni.e., whose pure St\\\"uckelberg contribution turns into the SU(2) multi-Galileon\ndynamics. Finally, and after having considered the curved space-time expansion\nof these Lagrangians, we discuss the form of the theory at all subsequent\norders.\n", "  We aim to study the standing fundamental kink mode of coronal loops in the\nnonlinear regime, investigating the changes in energy evolution in the\ncross-section and oscillation amplitude of the loop which are related to\nnonlinear effects, in particular to the development of the Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability (KHI). We run idea, high-resolution three-dimensional (3D)\nmagnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations, studying the influence of the initial\nvelocity amplitude and the inhomogeneous layer thickness. We model the coronal\nloop as a straight, homogeneous magnetic flux tube with an outer inhomogeneous\nlayer, embedded in a straight, homogeneous magnetic field. We find that, for\nlow amplitudes which do not allow for the KHI to develop during the simulated\ntime, the damping time agrees with the theory of resonant absorption. However,\nfor higher amplitudes, the presence of KHI around the oscillating loop can\nalter the loop's evolution, resulting in a significantly faster damping than\npredicted by the linear theory in some cases. This questions the accuracy of\nseismological methods applied to observed damping profiles, based on linear\ntheory.\n", "  In a series of papers, we have investigated the compatibility of the\n$Kimber$-$Martin$-$Ryskin$ ($KMR$) and $Martin$-$Ryskin$-$Watt$ ($MRW$)\n$unintegrated$ parton distribution functions ($UPDF$) as well as the\ndescription of the experimental data on the proton structure functions. The\npresent work is a sequel to that survey, via calculation of the transverse\nmomentum distribution of the electro-weak gauge vector bosons in the\n$k_t$-factorization scheme, by the means of the $KMR$, the $LO\\;MRW$ and the\n$NLO\\;MRW$ $UPDF$, in the next-to leading order ($NLO$). To this end, we have\ncalculated and aggregated the invariant amplitudes of the corresponding\n$involved$ diagrams in the $NLO$, and counted the individual contributions in\ndifferent frameworks. The preparation process for the $UPDF$ utilizes the $PDF$\nof $Martin$ et al, $MSTW2008-LO$, $MSTW2008-NLO$, $MMHT2014-LO$ and\n$MMHT2014-NLO$ as the inputs. Afterwards, the results have been analyzed\nagainst each other, as well as the existing experimental data. Our calculation\nshow excellent agreement with the experiment data. It is however interesting to\npoint-out that, the calculation using the $KMR$ framework illustrates a\nstronger agreement with the experimental data, despite the fact that the\n$LO\\;MRW$ and the $NLO\\;MRW$ formalisms employ a better theoretical description\nof the $DGLAP$ evolution equation. This is of course due to the use of the\ndifferent implementation of the angular ordering constraint in the $KMR$\napproach, in which automatically includes the re-summation of $ln({1/x})$,\n$BFKL$ logarithms, in the $LO$-$DGLAP$ evolution equation.\n", "  Scalar particles $S$ which are singlets under the Standard Model gauge group\nare generic features of many models of fundamental physics, in particular as\npossible mediators to a hidden sector. We show that the decay $S\\to Zh$\nprovides a powerful probe of the CP nature of the scalar, because it is allowed\nonly if $S$ has CP-odd interactions. We perform a model-independent analysis of\nthis decay using an effective Lagrangian and compute the relevant Wilson\ncoefficients arising from integrating out heavy fermions to one-loop order.\n", "  We investigate the formation and the coarsening dynamics of islands in a\nstrained epitaxial semi-conductor film. These islands are commonly observed in\nthin films undergoing a morphological instability due to the presence of the\nelasto capillary effect. We first describe both analytically and numerically\nthe formation of an equilibrium island using a two dimensional continuous\nmodel. We have found that these equilibrium island-like solutions have a\nmaximum height $h_0$ and they sit on top of a flat wetting layer with a\nthickness $h_w$. We then consider two islands and we report that they undergo a\nnon-interrupted coarsening that follows a two stage dynamics. The first stage\nmay be depicted by a quasi-static dynamics, where the mass transfers are\nproportional to the chemical potential difference of the islands. It is\nassociated with a time scale $t_c$ that is function of the distance $d$ between\nthe islands, and leads to the shrinkage of the smallest island. Once its height\nbecomes smaller than a minimal equilibrium height $h_{0}^{*}$, its mass spreads\nover the entire system. Our results pave the way for a future analysis of\ncoarsening of an assembly of islands.\n", "  We investigate two-parameter solutions of sigma-models on two dimensional\nsymmetric spaces contained in E11. Embedding such sigma-model solutions in\nspace-time gives solutions of M* and M'-theory where the metric depends on\ngeneral travelling wave functions, as opposed to harmonic functions typical in\ngeneral relativity, supergravity and M-theory. Weyl reflection allows such\nsolutions to be mapped to M-theory solutions where the wave functions depend\nexplicitly on extra coordinates contained in the fundamental representation of\nE11.\n", "  Following up on previous studies on parity-time-symmetric gain-loss\nbi-layers, and inspired by formal analogies with plasmonic waveguides, we study\nnon-Hermiticity-induced wave confinement and guiding phenomena that can occur\nin loss-gain-loss three-layers. By revisiting previous well-established\n\"gain-guiding\" concepts, we investigate analytically and numerically the\ndispersion and confinement properties of guided modes that can be supported by\nthis type of structures, by assuming realistic dispersion models and parameters\nfor the material constituents. As key outcomes, we identify certain modes with\nspecific polarization and symmetry that exhibit particularly desirable\ncharacteristics, in terms of quasi-real propagation constant and sub-wavelength\nconfinement. Moreover, we elucidate the effects of material dispersion and\nparameters, and highlight the potential advantages by comparison with the\npreviously studied gain-loss bi-layer configurations. Our results provide\nadditional perspectives on light control in non-Hermitian optical systems, and\nmay find potentially intriguing applicability to reconfigurable nanophotonic\nplatforms.\n", "  We study the $\\bar D D$ (${\\bar D}^0 D^0$ and $D^-D^+$) charm meson pair\nproduction in antiproton (${\\bar p}$) induced reactions on nuclei at beam\nenergies ranging from threshold to several GeV. Our model is based on an\neffective Lagrangian approach that has only the baryon-meson degrees of freedom\nand involves the physical hadron masses. The reaction proceeds via the\n$t$-channel exchanges of $\\Lambda_c^+$, $\\Sigma_c^+$, and $\\Sigma_c^{++}$\nbaryons in the initial collision of the antiproton with one of the protons of\nthe target nucleus. The medium effects on the exchanged baryons are included by\nincorporating in the corresponding propagators, the effective charm baryon\nmasses calculated within a quark-meson coupling (QMC) model. The wave functions\nof the bound proton have been determined within the QMC model as well as in a\nphenomenological model where they are obtained by solving the Dirac equation\nwith appropriate scalar and vector potentials. The initial- and final-state\ndistortion effects have been approximated by using an eikonal\napproximation-based procedure. Detailed numerical results are presented for\ntotal and double differential cross sections for the ${\\bar D}^0 D^0$ and\n$D^-D^+$ production reactions on $^{16}$O and $^{90}$Zr targets. It is noticed\nthat at ${\\bar p}$ beam momenta of interest to the ${\\bar P}ANDA$ experiment,\nmedium effects lead to noticeable enhancements in the charm meson production\ncross sections.\n", "  Bright squeezed vacuum, a promising tool for quantum information, can be\ngenerated by high-gain parametric down-conversion. However, its frequency and\nangular spectra are typically quite broad, which is undesirable for\napplications requiring single-mode radiation. We tailor the frequency spectrum\nof high-gain parametric down-conversion using an SU(1,1) interferometer\nconsisting of two nonlinear crystals with a dispersive medium separating them.\nThe dispersive medium allows us to select a narrow band of the frequency\nspectrum to be exponentially amplified by high-gain parametric amplification.\nThe frequency spectrum is thereby narrowed from (56.5 +- 0.1) to (1.22 +- 0.02)\nTHz and, in doing so, the number of frequency modes is reduced from\napproximately 50 to 1.82 +- 0.02. Moreover, this method provides control and\nflexibility over the spectrum of the generated light through the timing of the\npump.\n", "  We examine the propagation of a weak probe light through a coherently driven\n$Y$-type system. Under the condition that the excited atomic levels decay via\nsame vacuum modes, the effects of quantum interference in decay channels are\nconsidered. It is found that the interference in decay channels results in a\nlossless anomalous dispersion between two gain peaks. We demonstrate that the\nprobe pulse propagation can in principle be switched from subluminal to\nsuperluminal due to the decay-induced interference. We also show that the\nsystem exhibits a high index of refraction with negligible absorption for the\ndriving fields. A dressed-state picture of the atom-light interaction is\ndescribed to explain the numerical results.\n", "  It is shown how possible corrections to ordinary quantum mechanics described\nby the Lindblad equation might be detected by exploiting the great precision of\natomic clocks.\n", "  In this paper we have consider the thermodynamics of a photon gas subject to\nthe presence of a minimal measurable length following from a covariant\nextension of the original generalized uncertainty principle (GUP). After\nestablishing consistently a generalized dynamics, we define a GUP deformed\nMaxwell invariant which serves as the basis for our study. In order to\nhighlight the GUP effects we compute the one- and two-loop order contribution\nto the partition function at the high-temperature limit. Afterwards, by\ncomputing the internal energy density we conclude that the additional terms can\nbe seen as corrections $\\delta\\sigma_{\\rm{gup}}$ to the Stefan-Boltzmann law\ndue to GUP effects.\n", "  The mechanisms leading to the formation of disks around young stellar objects\n(YSOs) and to the launching of the associated jets are crucial to the\nunderstanding of the earliest stages of star and planet formation. HH 212 is a\nprivileged laboratory to study a pristine jet-disk system. Therefore we\ninvestigate the innermost region ($<100$ AU) around the HH 212-MM1 protostar\nthrough ALMA band\\,7 observations of methanol. The 8 GHz bandwidth spectrum\ntowards the peak of the continuum emission of the HH 212 system reveals at\nleast 19 transitions of methanol. Several of these lines (among which several\nvibrationally excited lines in the v$_{\\rm t}=1,2$ states) have upper energies\nabove 500 K. They originate from a compact ($<135$ AU in diameter), hot ($\\sim\n295$ K) region elongated along the direction of the SiO jet. We performed a fit\nin the $uv$ plane of various velocity channels of the strongest high-excitation\nlines. The blue- and red-shifted velocity centroids are shifted roughly\nsymmetrically on either side of the jet axis, indicating that the line-of-sight\nvelocity beyond 0.7 km s$^{-1}$ from systemic is dominated by rotational\nmotions. The velocity increases moving away from the protostar further\nindicating that the emission of methanol is not associated with a Keplerian\ndisk or rotating-infalling cavity, and it is more likely associated with\noutflowing gas. We speculate that CH$_3$OH traces a disk wind gas accelerated\nat the base. The launching region would be at a radius of a few astronomical\nunits from the YSO.\n", "  Chemical substitution plays a key role in controlling the electronic and\nmagnetic properties of complex materials. For instance, in EuO, carrier doping\ncan induce a spin-polarized metallic state, colossal magnetoresistance, and\nsignificantly enhance the Curie temperature. Here, we employ a combination of\nmolecular-beam epitaxy, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, and an\neffective model calculation to investigate and understand how semi-localized\nstates evolve in lightly electron doped Eu$_{1-x}$Gd$_{x}$O above the\nferromagnetic Curie temperature. Our studies reveal a characteristic length\nscale for the spatial extent of the donor wavefunctions which remains constant\nas a function of doping, consistent with recent tunneling studies of doped EuO.\nOur work sheds light on the nature of the semiconductor-to-metal transition in\nEu$_{1-x}$Gd$_{x}$O and should be generally applicable for doped complex\noxides.\n", "  Coherent coupling generated by laser light between the hyperfine states of\natoms, loaded in a 1D optical lattice, gives rise to the \"synthetic dimension\"\nsystem which is equivalent to a Hofstadter model in a finite strip of square\nlattice. An SU(M) symmetric attractive interaction in conjunction with the\nsynthetic gauge field present in this system gives rise to unusual effects. We\nstudy the two- body problem of the system using the T-matrix formalism. We show\nthat the two-body ground states pick up a finite momentum and can transform\ninto two-body resonance like features in the scattering continuum with a large\nchange in the phase shift. As a result, even for this 1D system, a critical\namount of attraction is needed to form bound states. These phenomena have\nspectacular effects on the many body physics of the system analyzed using the\nnumerical density matrix renormalization group technique. We show that the\nFulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) states form in the system even for a\n\"balanced\" gas and the FFLO momentum of the pairs scales linearly with flux.\nConsidering suitable measures, we investigate interesting properties of these\nstates. We also discuss a possibility of realization of a generalized\ninteresting topological model, called the Creutz ladder.\n", "  A proposal for a magnetic quantum processor that consists of individual\nmolecular spins coupled to superconducting coplanar resonators and transmission\nlines is carefully examined. We derive a simple magnetic quantum\nelectrodynamics Hamiltonian to describe the underlying physics. It is shown\nthat these hybrid devices can perform arbitrary operations on each spin qubit\nand induce tunable interactions between any pair of them. The combination of\nthese two operations ensures that the processor can perform universal quantum\ncomputations. The feasibility of this proposal is critically discussed using\nthe results of realistic calculations, based on parameters of existing devices\nand molecular qubits. These results show that the proposal is feasible,\nprovided that molecules with sufficiently long coherence times can be developed\nand accurately integrated into specific areas of the device. This architecture\nhas an enormous potential for scaling up quantum computation thanks to the\nmicroscopic nature of the individual constituents, the molecules, and the\npossibility of using their internal spin degrees of freedom.\n", "  We derive new empirical calibrations for strong-line diagnostics of gas phase\nmetallicity in local star forming galaxies by uniformly applying the Te method\nover the full metallicity range probed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).\nTo measure electron temperatures at high metallicity, where the auroral lines\nneeded are not detected in single galaxies, we stacked spectra of more than\n110,000 galaxies from the SDSS in bins of log[O II]/H$\\beta$ and log[O\nIII]/H$\\beta$. This stacking scheme does not assume any dependence of\nmetallicity on mass or star formation rate, but only that galaxies with the\nsame line ratios have the same oxygen abundance. We provide calibrations which\nspan more than 1 dex in metallicity and are entirely defined on a consistent\nabsolute Te metallicity scale for galaxies. We apply our calibrations to the\nSDSS sample and find that they provide consistent metallicity estimates to\nwithin 0.05 dex.\n", "  In connection with the 150-th Anniversary of P. N. Lebedev, we present\nhistorical aspects of his scientific and organizing activity and recall his\nfamous experimental observations and proof of the existence of light pressure\nalong with other results that essentially influenced the development of physics\nin Russia and in the whole world as well. We discuss the relationship of these\nstudies of electromagnetic waves and other kinds of vibrational phenomena\ninvestigated by P. N. Lebedev to modern studies of the interaction of photons\nwith mirrors, gravitational waves, acoustic waves, nonstationary (dynamical)\nCasimir effect of photon creation in resonators with vibrating boundaries, and\nvibrations of voltage and current in superconducting circuits realizing the\nstates of qubits and qudits. We discuss the possibility of existence of the\nnonstationary Casimir effect for gravitational waves and sound in liquid\nhelium.\n", "  We propose a realistic scheme of generating a traveling odd Schr$\\\"o$dinger\ncat state and a generalized entangled coherent state in circuit quantum\nelectrodynamics (circuit-QED). A squeezed vacuum state is used as initial\nresource of nonclassical states, which can be created through a Josephson\ntraveling-wave parametric amplifier, and travels through a transmission line.\nBecause a single-photon subtraction from the squeezed vacuum gives with very\nhigh fidelity an odd Schr$\\\"o$dinger cat state, we consider a specific\ncircuit-QED setup consisting of the Josephson amplifier creating the traveling\nresource in a line, a beam-splitter coupling two transmission lines, and a\nsingle photon detector located at the end of the other line. When a single\nmicrowave photon is detected by measuring the excited state of a\nsuperconducting qubit in the detector, a heralded cat state is generated with\nhigh fidelity in the opposite line. For example, we show that the high fidelity\nof the outcome with the ideal cat state can be achieved with appropriate\nsqueezing parameters theoretically. As its extended setup, we suggest that\ngeneralized entangled coherent states can be also built probabilistically and\nuseful for microwave quantum information processing for error-correctable\nqudits in circuit-QED.\n", "  The present work deals with a detailed study of universal thermodynamics in\ndifferent modified gravity theories. The validity of the generalized second law\nof thermodynamics (GSLT) and thermodynamical equilibrium (TE) of the Universe\nbounded by a horizon (apparent/event) in f(R)-gravity, Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet\ngravity, RS-II brane scenario and DGP brane model has been investigated. In the\nperspective of recent observational evidences, the matter in the Universe is\nchosen as interacting holographic dark energy model. The entropy on the\nhorizons are evaluated from the validity of the unified first law and as a\nresult there is a correction (in integral form) to the usual Bekenstein\nentropy. The other thermodynamical parameter namely temperature on the horizon\nis chosen as the recently introduced corrected Hawking temperature. The above\nthermodynamical analysis is done for homogeneous and isotropic flat FLRW model\nof the Universe. The restrictions for the validity of GSLT and the TE are\npresented in tabular form for each gravity theory. Finally, due to complicated\nexpressions, the validity of GSLT and TE are also examined from graphical\nrepresentation, using three Planck data sets.\n", "  We provide complete one-loop predictions for the direct production of the\nneutralino pairs via photon-photon collisions which appears for the first time\nat one-loop level in the minimal supersymmetric standard model at the\nInternational Linear Collider. We present a comprehensive investigation of the\ndependence of total cross section on the center-of-mass energy and the\ntan$\\beta$ for three different scenarios based on gaugino/Higgsino fractions of\nthe neutralinos. Furthermore, by investigating the behavior with the most\nrelevant parameters $\\mu$ and $M_2$, we exhibit regions of the parameter space\nwhere the enhancement of the cross section is large enough to be detectable at\nlinear colliders. Our analysis shows that the corresponding production cross\nsection reaches its highest values when the lightest neutralino\n$\\widetilde{\\chi}_{1}^0$ has a dominant Higgsino component and/or the\nnext-to-lightest neutralino $\\widetilde{\\chi}_{2}^0$ has a dominant gaugino\ncomponent.\n", "  Aside from its primary purpose of shedding light on the mass hierarchy (MH)\nusing reactor anti-neutrinos, the JUNO experiment in Jiangmen (China) will also\ncontribute to study neutrinos from non-reactor sources. In this poster we\nreview JUNO's goals in the realms of supernova, atmospheric, solar and\ngeo-neutrinos; present the related experimental issues and provide the current\nestimates of its potential. For a typical galactic SN at a distance of 10 kpc,\nJUNO will record about 5000 events from inverse beta decay, 2000 events from\nelastic neutrino-proton scattering, 300 events from neutrino-electron\nscattering, and the charged current and neutral current interactions on the\n${^{12}}{\\rm C}$ nuclei. For atmospheric neutrinos, JUNO should be able to\ndetect $\\nu_e$ and $\\nu_\\mu$ charged current events. Optimistically, a\ndetermination of the MH could be achieved at the 1.8$\\sigma$ (2.6$\\sigma$)\nlevel after 10 (20) years of data taking. JUNO will also study solar neutrinos\nfrom ${^{7}}{\\rm Be}$ and ${^{8}}{\\rm B}$, at low ($\\approx$1 MeV) and higher\nenergies respectively, to improve our understanding of the matter effects on\nthe oscillation mechanism and of the solar metallicity. Challenges come\nprimarily from the radioactive and cosmogenic backgrounds: the expected\nperformance for two benchmark scintillator radio-purities, are shown. The flux\nof geo-neutrinos gives us an insight on the Earth composition and formation. We\nwill show how the increased sample size given by JUNO's large sensitive mass of\n20 KTon liquid scintillator will provide data to answer to several geological\nquestions among which the U/Th ratio and mantle measurements.\n", "  The energy-momentum tensor and equation of state are studied in\nfinite-temperature (2+1)-flavor QCD with improved Wilson quarks using the\nmethod proposed by Makino and Suzuki based on the gradient flow. We find that\nthe results of the gradient flow are consistent with the previous results using\nthe $T$-integration method at $T \\mathrel{\\rlap{\\raise 0.511ex\n\\hbox{$<$}}{\\lower 0.511ex \\hbox{$\\sim$}}} 280$ MeV ($N_t\\mathrel{\\rlap{\\raise\n0.511ex \\hbox{$>$}}{\\lower 0.511ex \\hbox{$\\sim$}}}10$), while a disagreement is\nfound at $T \\mathrel{\\rlap{\\raise 0.511ex \\hbox{$>$}}{\\lower 0.511ex\n\\hbox{$\\sim$}}} 350$ MeV ($N_t \\mathrel{\\rlap{\\raise 0.511ex \\hbox{$<$}}{\\lower\n0.511ex \\hbox{$\\sim$}}} 8$) presumably due to the small-$N_t$ lattice artifact.\nWe also report on the results on the renormalized chiral condensate and its\ndisconnected susceptibility using the method of Hieda and Suzuki. The results\nshow a clear signal of the expected chiral restoration crossover even with\nWilson-type quarks which violate the chiral symmetry explicitly.\n", "  We present a self-consistent modelling of the available light curve and\nradial velocity data of WASP-47 that takes into account the gravitational\ninteractions between all known bodies in the system. The joint analysis of\nlight curve and radial velocity data in a multi-planetary system allows\nderiving absolute densities, radii, and masses without the use of theoretical\nstellar models. For WASP-47 the precision is limited by the reduced dynamical\ninformation that is due to the short time span of the K2 light curve. We\nachieve a precision of around 22% for the radii of the star and the transiting\nplanets, between 40% and 60% for their masses, and between 1.5% and 38% for\ntheir densities. All values agree with previously reported measurements. When\ntheoretical stellar models are included, the system parameters are determined\nwith a precision that exceeds that achieved by previous studies, thanks to the\nself-consistent modelling of light curve and radial velocity data.\n", "  We study the phase diagram of the fermionic Hubbard model on the hexagonal\nlattice in the space of on-site and nearest neighbor couplings with\nHybrid-Monte-Carlo simulations. With pure on-site repulsion this allows to\ndetermine the critical coupling strength for spin-density wave formation with\nthe standard approach of introducing a small mass term, explicitly breaking the\nsublattice symmetry. The analogous mass term for charge-density wave formation\nabove a critical nearest-neighbor repulsion, on the other hand, would introduce\na fermion sign problem. The competition between the two and the phase diagram\nin the space of the two coouplings can however be studied in simulations\nwithout explicit sublattice symmetry breaking. Our results compare\nqualitatively well with the Hartree-Fock phase diagram. We furthermore\ndemonstrate how spin-symmetry breaking by the Euclidean time discretization can\nbe avoided also, when using an improved fermion action based on an exponetial\ntransfer matrix with exact sublattice symmetry.\n", "  A study of Universal thermodynamics is done in Lanczos-Lovelock gravity. The\nUniverse is chosen as FRW model bounded by apparent or event horizon. The\nunified first law is examined, assuming extended Hawking temperature on the\nhorizon. As a result there is a modification of Bekenstein entropy on the\nhorizons. Further the validity of generalized second law of thermodynamics and\nthermodynamical equilibrium are also investigated for perfect fluid (with\nconstant equation of state), modified chaplygin gas model and holographic dark\nenergy model.\n", "  The conceptual framework provided by the functional Renormalization Group\n(fRG) has become a formidable tool to study correlated electron systems on\nlattices which, in turn, provided great insights to our understanding of\ncomplex many-body phenomena, such as high- temperature superconductivity or\ntopological states of matter. In this work we present one of the latest\nrealizations of fRG which makes use of an adaptive numerical quadrature scheme\nspecifically tailored to the described fRG scheme. The final result is an\nincrease in performance thanks to improved parallelism and scalability.\n", "  The fast blood stream of animals is associated with large shear stresses.\nConsequently, blood cells have evolved a special morphology and a specific\ninternal architecture allowing them to maintain their integrity over several\nweeks. For instance, non-mammalian red blood cells, mammalian erythroblasts and\nplatelets have a peripheral ring of microtubules, called the marginal band,\nthat flattens the overall cell morphology by pushing on the cell cortex. In\nthis article, we model how the shape of these cells stems from the balance\nbetween marginal band elasticity and cortical tension. We predict that the\ndiameter of the cell scales with the total microtubule polymer, and verify the\npredicted law across a wide range of species. Our analysis also shows that the\ncombination of the marginal band rigidity and cortical tension increases the\nability of the cell to withstand forces without deformation. Finally, we model\nthe marginal band coiling that occurs during the disc-to-sphere transition\nobserved for instance at the onset of blood platelet activation. We show that\nwhen cortical tension increases faster than crosslinkers can unbind, the\nmarginal band will coil, whereas if the tension increases slower, the marginal\nband may shorten as microtubules slide relative to each other.\n", "  In this paper, we will propose the most general form of the deformation of\nHeisenberg algebra motivated by the generalized uncertainty principle. This\ndeformation of the Heisenberg algebra will deform all quantum mechanical\nsystems. The form of the generalized uncertainty principle used to motivate\nthese results will be motivated by space fractional quantum mechanics and\nnon-locality in quantum mechanical systems. We also analyse a specific limit of\nthis generalized deformation for one dimensional system, and in that limit, a\nnonlocal deformation of the momentum operator generates a local deformation of\nall one dimensional quantum mechanical systems. We analyse the low energy\neffects of this deformation on a harmonic oscillator, Landau levels, Lamb\nshift, and potential barrier. We also demonstrate that this deformation leads\nto a discretization of space.\n", "  We present the results of the photometric and spectrophotometric properties\nof the 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko nucleus derived with the OSIRIS instrument\nduring the closest fly-by over the comet, which took place on 14 th February\n2015 at a distance of {\\~} 6 km from the surface. Several images covering the\n0{\\deg}-33{\\deg} phase angle range were acquired, and the spatial resolution\nachieved was 11 cm/pxl. The flown-by region is located on the big lobe of the\ncomet, near the borders of the Ash, Apis and Imhotep regions. Our analysis\nshows that this region features local heterogeneities at the decimetre scale.\nWe observed difference of reflectance up to 40{\\%} between bright spots and\nsombre regions, and spectral slope variations up to 50{\\%}. The spectral\nreddening effect observed globally on the comet surface by Fornasier et al.\n(2015) is also observed locally on this region, but with a less steep\nbehaviour. We note that numerous metre-sized boulders, which exhibit a smaller\nopposition effect, also appear spectrally redder than their surroundings. In\nthis region, we found no evidence linking observed bright spots to exposed\nwater-ice-rich material. We fitted our dataset using the Hapke 2008 photometric\nmodel. The region overflown is globally as dark as the whole nucleus (geometric\nalbedo of 6.8{\\%}) and it has a high porosity value in the uppermost-layers\n(86{\\%}). These results of the photometric analysis at a decimetre scale\nindicate that the photometric properties of the flown-by region are similar to\nthose previously found for the whole nucleus.\n", "  In previous work, it has been shown that the recently proposed LLR method is\nvery efficient at overcoming strong metastabilities that arise near first-order\nphase transition points. Here we present a systematic study of the performance\nof the algorithm near (pseudo-)critical points for $q$-state Potts models with\n$q$ as large as 20, in two and three dimensions. In particular, we shall focus\nour study on the ergodicity of the replica exchange step and the underlying\nphysical mechanism. When compared with both analytical and numerical results\npresent in the literature, our determinations of thermodynamic observables\n(including the order-disorder interface tension at criticality) show an\nimpressive degree of relative accuracy (up to $2.5 \\times 10^{-6}$), which\nconfirms the reliability and the efficiency of the proposed approach.\n", "  We present a lattice determination of the vector and scalar form factors of\nthe semileptonic $D \\to \\pi \\ell \\nu$ decays, which are relevant for the\nextraction of the CKM matrix element $\\lvert V_{cd} \\rvert$ from experimental\ndata. Our analysis is based on the gauge configurations produced by the\nEuropean Twisted Mass Collaboration with $N_f = 2 + 1 + 1$ flavors of dynamical\nquarks. We simulated at three different values of the lattice spacing and with\npion masses as small as 210 MeV. Quark momenta are injected on the lattice\nusing non-periodic boundary conditions. The matrix elements of both vector and\nscalar currents are determined for a plenty of kinematical conditions in which\nparent and child mesons are either moving or at rest. Lorentz symmetry breaking\ndue to hypercubic effects is clearly observed in the data and included in the\ndecomposition of the current matrix elements in terms of additional form\nfactors. Our preliminary estimate for the vector form factor at zero 4-momentum\ntransfer is $f_+^{D \\to \\pi}(0) = 0.631\\,(40)$, which can be compared with the\nlatest FLAG average $f_+^{D \\to \\pi}(0) = 0.666\\,(29)$ available only at $N_f =\n2 + 1$.\n", "  Entanglement evolutions after a global quantum quench and a local quantum\nquench in 1+1 dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs) show qualitatively\ndifferent behaviors, and are studied within two different setups. In this work,\nwe bridge global and local quantum quenches in (1+1)-d CFTs in the same setup,\nby studying the entanglement evolution from a specific inhomogeneous initial\nstate. By utilizing conformal mappings, this inhomogeneous quantum quench is\nanalytically solvable. It is found that the entanglement evolution shows a\nglobal quantum quench feature in the short time limit, and a local quantum\nquench feature in the long time limit. The same features are observed in\nsingle-point correlation functions of primary fields. We provide a clear\nphysical picture for the underlying reason.\n", "  Very recently, Monz, et al. [arXiv:1507.08852] have reported the\ndemonstration of factoring 15 using a scalable Shor algorithm with an ion-trap\nquantum computer. In this note, we remark that the report is somewhat\nmisleading because there are three flaws in the proposed circuit diagram of\nShor algorithm. We also remark that the principles behind the demonstration\nhave not been explained properly, including its correctness and complexity.\n", "  The transition temperatures of epitaxial films of Fe(Te0:9Se0:1) are\nremarkably insensitive to applied magnetic field, leading to predictions of\nupper critical fields Bc2(T = 0) in excess of 100 T. Using pulsed magnetic\nfields, we find Bc2(0) to be on the order of 45 T, similar to values in bulk\nmaterial and still in excess of the paramagnetic limit. The same films show\nstrong magnetoresistance in fields above Bc2(T), consistent with the observed\nKondo minimum seen above Tc. Fits to the temperature dependence in the context\nof the WHH model, using the experimental value of the Maki parameter, require\nan effective spin-orbit relaxation parameter of order unity. We suggest that\nKondo localization plays a similar role to spin-orbit pair breaking in making\nWHH fits to the data.\n", "  We review the observational and theoretical constraints on extragalactic\nmagnetic fields across cosmic environment. In the next decade, the combination\nof sophisticated numerical simulations and various observational probes might\nsucceed in constraining the still elusive origin of magnetic fields on the\nlargest scales in the Universe.\n", "  Infrastructures are not inherently durable or fragile, yet all are fragile\nover the long term. Durability requires care and maintenance of individual\ncomponents and the links between them. Astronomy is an ideal domain in which to\nstudy knowledge infrastructures, due to its long history, transparency, and\naccumulation of observational data over a period of centuries. Research\nreported here draws upon a long-term study of scientific data practices to ask\nquestions about the durability and fragility of infrastructures for data in\nastronomy. Methods include interviews, ethnography, and document analysis. As\nastronomy has become a digital science, the community has invested in shared\ninstruments, data standards, digital archives, metadata and discovery services,\nand other relatively durable infrastructure components. Several features of\ndata practices in astronomy contribute to the fragility of that infrastructure.\nThese include different archiving practices between ground- and space-based\nmissions, between sky surveys and investigator-led projects, and between\nobservational and simulated data. Infrastructure components are tightly\ncoupled, based on international agreements. However, the durability of these\ninfrastructures relies on much invisible work - cataloging, metadata, and other\nlabor conducted by information professionals. Continual investments in care and\nmaintenance of the human and technical components of these infrastructures are\nnecessary for sustainability.\n", "  Energy cascade is ubiquitous in systems far from equilibrium. Facilitated by\nparticle interactions and external forces, it can lead to highly complex\nphenomena like fully developed turbulence, characterized by power law velocity\ncorrelation functions. Yet despite decades of research, how these power laws\nemerge from first principle remains unclear. Recently, experiments show that\nwhen a Bose condensate is subjected to periodic shaking, its momentum\ndistribution exhibits a power law behavior. The flexibility of cold atom\nexperiments has provided new opportunities to explore the emergence of these\npower laws, and to disentangle different sources of energy cascade. Here, we\npoint out that recent experiments in cold atoms imply that classical turbulence\nis part of a larger family of scale invariant phenomena that include ideal\ngases. Moreover, the property of the entire family is contained in the\nstructure of its Floquet states. For ideal gases, we show analytically that its\nmomentum distribution acquires a $1/q^2$ tail in each dimension when it is\nshaken periodically.\n", "  For the past decade, the SAIL labs at the University of Sydney have been\nchallenging students with short research projects that elucidate basic\nprinciples of physics. These include the development of instruments launched on\ncubesats, balloons, on telescopes or placed out in the field. This experiment\nis inspired by the spectacular 2015 discovery of merging black holes with the\nLaser Interferometric Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Students are\nprofoundly inspired by LIGO, and for good reason, but it is challenging to\nconstruct a table top demonstration of a gravitational wave observatory.\nInstead we consider chirps which are remarkable transient phenomena in nature\ninvolving both frequency and amplitude modulation, as we can demonstrate with a\nspinning coin. In the case of the LIGO event, orbital energy is being released\nas gravitational radiation; for the spinning coin, its spin/orbit energy is\nbeing released dissipatively (sound, heat, air viscosity). Our experiment\ninvolves a simple device to spin a coin remotely. This aids repeatability and\nallows us to spin the coin within a vacuum chamber to examine the contribution\nof air viscosity.\n", "  Frequency-dependent gravitational lens effects are found for trajectories of\nelectromagnetic rays passing through a distribution of plasma near a massive\nobject. Ray propagation through plasma adds extra terms to the equations of\nmotion that depend on the plasma refractive index. For low-frequency rays these\nrefractive effects can dominate, turning the gravitational lens into a mirror.\nWhile light rays behave like particles with an effective mass given by the\nplasma frequency in a medium with constant density, an inhomogeneous plasma\nintroduces more complicated behavior even for the spherically symmetric case.\nAs a physical example, the pulse profile of a compact object sheathed in a\ndense plasma is examined, which introduces dramatic frequency-dependent shifts\nfrom the behavior in vacuum.\n", "  This paper presents the results of a mission concept study for an autonomous\nmicro-scale surface lander also referred to as PANIC - the Pico Autonomous\nNear-Earth Asteroid In Situ Characterizer. The lander is based on the shape of\na regular tetrahedron with an edge length of 35 cm, has a total mass of\napproximately 12 kg and utilizes hopping as a locomotion mechanism in\nmicrogravity. PANIC houses four scientific instruments in its proposed baseline\nconfiguration which enable the in situ characterization of an asteroid. It is\ncarried by an interplanetary probe to its target and released to the surface\nafter rendezvous. Detailed estimates of all critical subsystem parameters were\nderived to demonstrate the feasibility of this concept. The study illustrates\nthat a small, simple landing element is a viable alternative to complex\ntraditional lander concepts, adding a significant science return to any\nnear-Earth asteroid (NEA) mission while meeting tight mass budget constraints.\n", "  We report a strong association between the particle acceleration and plasma\nmotions found in the 2010 August 18 solar flare. The plasma motions are tracked\nin the extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) images taken by the Atmospheric Imaging\nAssembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory and the Extreme\nUltraViolet Imager (EUVI) on the Solar Terrestrial Relation Observatory\nspacecraft Ahead, and the signature of particle acceleration was investigated\nby using Nobeyama Radioheliograph data. In our previous paper, we reported that\nin EUV images many plasma blobs appeared in the current sheet above the flare\narcade. They were ejected bidirectionally along the current sheet, and the\nblobs that were ejected sunward collided with the flare arcade. Some of them\ncollided or merged with each other before they were ejected from the current\nsheet. We discovered impulsive radio bursts associated with such plasma motions\n(ejection, coalescence, and collision with the post flare loops). The radio\nbursts are considered to be the gyrosynchrotron radiation by nonthermal high\nenergy electrons. In addition, the stereoscopic observation by AIA and EUVI\nsuggests that plasma blobs had a three-dimensionally elongated structure. We\nconsider that the plasma blobs were three-dimensional plasmoids (i.e. flux\nropes) moving in a current sheet. We believe that our observation provides\nclear evidence of particle acceleration associated with the plasmoid motions.\nWe discuss possible acceleration mechanisms on the basis of our results.\n", "  Since 2012, we have initiated a new idea showing that the mass of highly\nmagnetized or modified Einstein's gravity induced white dwarfs could be\nsignificantly super-Chandrasekhar with a different mass-limit. This discovery\nhas several important consequences, including explanation of peculiar,\nover-luminous type Ia supernovae, soft gamma-ray repeaters and anomalous X-ray\npulsars without invoking extraordinarily strong, yet unobserved, magnetic\nfields. It further argues for a possible second standard candle. Based on\nsimpler calculations, these white dwarfs are also shown to be much less\nluminous than their standard counter-parts (of low magnetic fields). This\ndiscovery altogether initiates a new field of research.\n", "  This paper gives a summary on the system concept and design of the focal\nplane assembly of AsteroidFinder/SSB, a small satellite mission which is\ncurrently under development at the German Aerospace Center (DLR). An athermal\ndesign concept has been developed in accordance to the requirements of the\ninstrument and spacecraft. Key aspects leading to this approach have been a\ntrade-off study of the mechanical telescope interface, the definition of\nelectrical and thermal interfaces and a material selection which minimizes\nthermally induced stresses. As a novelty, the structure will be manufactured\nfrom a machinable AlN-BN composite ceramic. To enable rapid design iterations\nand development, an integrated modeling approach has been used to conduct a\nthermo-mechanical analysis of the proposed concept in order to prove its\nfeasibility. The steady-state temperature distribution for various load cases\nand the resulting stress and strain within the assembly have both been computed\nusing a finite element simulation.\n", "  We use the Endpoint model for exclusive hadronic processes to study Compton\nscattering of the proton. The parameters of the Endpoint model are fixed using\nthe data for $F_1$ and the ratio of Pauli and Dirac form factors ($F_2/F_1$)\nand then used to get numerical predictions for the differential scattering\ncross section. We studied the Compton scattering at fixed $\\theta_{CM}$ in the\n$s \\sim t \\gg \\Lambda_{QCD}$ limit and at fixed $s$ much larger than $t$ limit.\nWe observed that the calculations in the Endpoint Model give a good fit with\nexperimental data in both regions.\n", "  Boundary conditions for the solid-liquid interface of the solidifying pure\nmelt have been derived. In the derivation the model of Gibbs interface is used.\nThe boundary conditions include both the state quantities of bulk phases are\ntaken at the interface and the quantities characterizing interfacial surface\nsuch as the surface temperature and the surface heat flux. Introduction of the\nsurface temperature as an independent variable allows us to describe the\nscattering energy at the interface. For the steady-state motion of the planar\ninterface the expression for the temperature discontinuity across the phase\nboundary has been obtained. Effect of Kapitza resistance on the interface\nvelocity is considered. It is shown that heat resistance leads to non-linearity\nin solidification kinetics, namely, in \"velocity-undercooling\" relationship.\nThe conditions of the steady--state motion of the planar interface has been\nfound.\n", "  Dust coagulation in interstellar space and protoplanetary disks is usually\ntreated as one of 2 extreme cases: Particle-Cluster Aggregation and\nCluster-Cluster Aggregation. In this paper we study the process of hierarchical\ngrowth, where aggregates are built from significantly smaller aggregates (but\nnot monomers). We show that this process can be understood as a modified,\nPCA-like process that produces porous, but non-fractal particles whose filling\nfactor is chiefly determined by the porosity of the building blocks.\n  We also show that in a coagulation environment where relative velocities are\ndriven by turbulence, a logarithmically flat mass distribution (equal mass per\nmass decade) as it is typically found in environments where fragmentation\nreplenishes small grains, leads to a situation where small particles and\naggregates dominate the growth of large ones. Therefore, in such environments,\nhierarchical growth should be seen as the norm. Consequently, we predict that\nthe aggregates in such environments are not fractals with extremely low\ndensities as they would result from extrapolation fractal laws to large sizes.\nThe compactification of aggregates does not only result from collisions with\nenough energy to restructure aggregates - it starts already earlier by filling\nvoids in particles with smaller grains that contribute to the growth.\n", "  The cross section for transverse momentum dependent double parton scattering\ninvolves transverse momentum dependent double parton distributions (DTMDs). In\nthe region of perturbative transverse momentum the DTMDs can be matched onto\ncollinear double parton distributions. We present the framework and results for\nthis matching, as well as the evolution equations for DTMDs in the region of\nlarge distance between the two partons. We discuss explicit results for\none-loop matching coefficients and evolution kernels.\n", "  A fluid-based method is demonstrated for preparing graphene nanomeshes (GNMs)\ndirectly from pristine graphite flakes by a one-step process. The high\nefficiency is attributed to the combination of fluid-assisted exfoliation and\nperforation of the graphene sheets. Atomic force microscopy shows that the\nas-produced GNMs are less than 1.5 nm thick. The total area of the pores within\n1 um2 of the GNM sheet is estimated as ~0.15 um2 and the pore density as ~22\num-2, The yield of GNMs from pristine graphite powder and the power consumption\nfor per gram GNM synthesis are evaluated as 5 wt% and 120 kWh, respectively.\nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, elemental analysis and\nRaman spectroscopy results indicate the purity of the GNMs and thus it is a\ngreen efficient method. The present work is expected to facilitate the\nproduction of GNMs in large scale.\n", "  Progress in neutron decay experiments requires better methods for the\ncharacterization of electron detectors. I show that for such \\b{eta}-decay\nstudies, electron time-of-flight can be used for in-situ calibration of\nelectron detectors. Energy resolution down to a few keV can be reached for the\nlower part of the electron spectrum in neutron decay, where conventional\ncalibration methods come to their limit. Novel time-of-flight methods can also\nbe used to perform a complete experiment on electron backscattering from their\ndetectors.\n", "  A recently developed numerical method for the calculation of derivatives of\nfunctions of general complex matrices, which can also be combined with implicit\nmatrix function approximations such as Krylov-Ritz type algorithms, is\npresented. An important use case for the method in the context of lattice gauge\ntheory is the overlap Dirac operator at finite quark chemical potential.\nDerivatives of the lattice Dirac operator are necessary for the computation of\nconserved lattice currents or the fermionic force in Hybrid Monte-Carlo and\nLangevin simulations. To calculate the overlap Dirac operator at finite\nchemical potential the product of the sign function of a non-Hermitian matrix\nwith a vector has to be computed. For non-Hermitian matrices it is not possible\nto efficiently approximate the sign function with polynomials or rational\nfunctions. Implicit approximation algorithms, like Krylov-Ritz methods, that\ndepend on the source vector have to be used instead. Our method can also\nprovide derivatives of such implicit approximations. We show how a generalised\ndeflation prescription can be used to improve the performance of the method, if\nsome eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix being differentiated are known.\nTo show that the method is efficient and well suited for practical calculations\nwe provide test results for the two-sided Lanczos approximation of the\nfinite-density overlap Dirac operator on SU(3) gauge field configurations on\nlattices with sizes up to $14 \\times 14^3$.\n", "  This thesis explores two avenues into understanding the physics of black\nholes and horizons beyond general relativity, via analogue models and Lorentz\nviolating theories. Analogue spacetimes have wildly different dynamics to\ngeneral relativity; this allows the possibility of non-Killing horizons in\nstationary solutions. In the case of non-Killing horizons different definitions\nof surface gravity are truly different quantities. This also has application to\nmodified theories of gravity, where there is no reason to expect all horizons\nto be Killing horizons. In Lorentz violating theories, the situation becomes\neven stranger, as Killing horizons are at best low energy barriers, but for\nsuperluminal dispersion relations a true causal barrier, the universal horizon,\nmay be present. We investigate the nature of these universal horizons via a ray\ntracing study, and delve into what happens near both the universal and Killing\nhorizons. From this study we determine the surface gravity of universal\nhorizons by the peeling properties of rays near the horizon and discuss\nwhether, and at what temperature these horizons radiate. Finally, we combine\nour investigations of universal horizons and analogue spacetimes, and ask why\nwe have not seen a universal horizon in studies of analogue gravity.\n", "  Under the correct conditions, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMI) can\nlead to topologically protected spin textures such as skyrmions. The\napplication of DMI for spin-based computation and memory technologies is\npromising and requires a detailed consideration of the role intrinsic energies\nhave on stabilizing the diverse textures observed thus far. Here we\nexperimentally investigate the effect of dipolar energy from interlayer\ncoupling on the remanent spin textures found at room temperature for\ninterfacial DMI multilayers of [ Pt \\ Co \\ Ir ]$_{\\times N}$. The total dipolar\nenergy is modified by increasing the number of layer repetitions N which result\nin different phases of chiral magnetic textures. We use the phase transitions\nto estimate the DMI energy present in the ultrathin films to be D = 2.1 $\\pm$\n0.1 mJ m$^{-2}$. Unlike traditional perpendicular magnetic anisotropy films,\nthese multilayer films with finite DMI exhibit isolated hedgehog skyrmion\nbubbles as well as sub 100 nm labyrinth domains with cycloidal homochiral\nN\\'eel walls which are dependent on DMI as well as the total dipolar energy.\n", "  We give a rigorous mathematical analysis of the one-soliton solution of the\nfocusing Davey-Stewartson II equation and a proof of its instability under\nperturbation. Building on the fundamental perturbation analysis of Gadyl'shin\nand Kiselev, we verify their Assumption 1 and use Fredholm determinants to\nglobalize their perturbation analysis.\n", "  The main aim of the T2K experiment in Japan is to discover CP violation in\nthe leptonic sector by measuring the Dirac phase $\\delta_{CP}$. For that\npurpose T2K has already started collecting data in both neutrino and\nantineutrino mode. But in this work we will show that, in T2K the main role of\nthe antineutrinos is to resolve the octant degeneracy. If the octant is known\nthen the pure neutrino run of T2K is capable to give the maximum CP\nsensitivity. On the other hand in the experiment like NO$\\nu$A, antineutrinos\nare still useful even when octant is known. Thus we propose that let T2K run in\nthe dominant neutrino mode whereas the antineutrino component of the other\nexperiments can resolve the octant degeneracy in T2K. As an example we show\nthat if T2K is combined with the experiments NO$\\nu$A and ICAL@INO, then T2K\nwill have the potential to discover CP violation with maximum sensitivity in\nthe dominant neutrino mode.\n", "  This paper is a companion to a series of papers devoted to the study of the\nspectral distribution of the free Jacobi process associated with a single\nprojection. Actually, we notice that the flow solves a radial L\\\"owner equation\nand as such, the general theory of L\\\"owner equations implies that it is\nunivalent in some connected region in the open unit disc. We also prove that\nits inverse defines the Aleksandrov-Clark measure at $z=1$ of some Herglotz\nfunction which is absolutely-continuous with an essentially bounded density. As\na by-product, we deduce that $z=1$ belongs only to the discrete spectrum of the\nunitary operator whose spectral dynamics are governed by the flow. Moreover, we\nuse a previous result due to the first author in order to derive an explicit,\nyet complicated, expression of the moments of both the unitary and the free\nJacobi processes. The paper is closed with some remarks on the boundary\nbehavior of the flow's inverse.\n", "  We report on the characterization of silica aerogel thermal optical\nnonlinearity, obtained by z-scan technique. The results show that typical\nsilica aerogels have nonlinear optical coefficient similar to that of glass\n$(\\simeq 10^{-12} $m$^2/$W), with negligible optical nonlinear absorption. The\nnon\\-li\\-near coefficient can be increased to values in the range of $10^{-10}\n$m$^2/$W by embedding an absorbing dye in the aerogel. This value is one order\nof magnitude higher than that observed in the pure dye and in typical highly\nnonlinear materials like liquid crystals.\n", "  Earth's inner core exhibits an unusually high Poisson's ratio and noticeable\nelastic anisotropy. The mechanisms responsible for these features are critical\nfor understanding the evolution of the Earth but remain unclear. This study\nindicates that once the correct formula for the shear modulus is used, shear\nsoftening can simultaneously explain the high Poisson's ratio and strong\nanisotropy of the inner core. Body-centred-cubic (bcc) iron shows shear\ninstability at the pressures found in the inner-core and can be dynamically\nstabilized by temperature and light elements. It is very likely that some\ncombinations of light elements stabilize the bcc iron alloy under inner-core\nconditions. Such a bcc phase would exhibit significant shear softening and\nmatch the geophysical constraints of the inner core. Identifying which light\nelements and what concentrations of these elements stabilize the bcc phase will\nprovide critical information on the light elements of the inner core.\n", "  We review the results of the wounded quark model, with a stress on\neccentricity observables in small systems. A new element is a presentation of\nsymmetric cumulants for the elliptic and triangular flow correlations, obtained\nin the wounded-quark approach.\n", "  Particle simulations confined by sharp walls usually develop an oscillatory\ndensity profile. For some applications, most notably soft matter liquids, this\nbehavior is often unrealistic and one expects a monotonic density climb\ninstead. To reconcile simulations with experiments, we propose mirror-and-shift\nboundary conditions where each interface is mapped to a distant part of itself.\nThe main result is that the particle density increases almost monotonically\nfrom zero to bulk, over a short distance of about one particle diameter. The\nmethod is applied to simulate a polymer brush in explicit solvent, grafted on a\nflat silicon substrate. The simulated density profile agrees favorably with\nneutron reflectometry measurements and self-consistent field theory results.\n", "  Nowadays, in our globalized world,the local and intercountry movements of\npopulation have been increased. This situation makes it important for host\ncountries to do right predictions for the future population of their native\npeople as well as immigrant people. The knowledge of the attained number of\naccumulated population is necessary for future planning, concerning to\neducation,health, job, housing, safety requirements, etc. In this work, for\nupdating historically well known formulas of population dynamics of a community\nare revisited in the framework of compound growth and fractional calculus to\nget more realistic relations. Within this context, for a time t, the population\nevolution of a society which owns two different components is calculated.\nConcomitant relations have been developed to provide a comparison between the\nnative population and the immigrant population that come into existence where\nat each time interval a colonial population is joined. Eventually at time t,\nthe case where the native population becomes equal to immigrant population is\ndiscussed. Moreover, the differential equation of a probability function for\nthe equilibrium state of accumulative population is obtained. It is seen that\nthe equilibrium solution can be written as a series in terms of Bernoulli\nnumbers. In the calculation of population dynamics, Mittag- Leffler(M-L)\nfunction replaces the exponential function.\n", "  The stochastic Arctic sea ice model described as a single periodic\nnon-autonomous stochastic ordinary differential equation (ODE) is useful in\nexplaining the seasonal variability of Arctic sea ice. However, to be nearer to\nrealistic approximations we consider the inclusion of long-term forcing\nimplying the effect of slowly-varying ocean or atmospheric low-frequencies. In\nthis research, we rely on the equivalent Fokker-Planck equation instead of the\nstochastic ODE owing to the advantages of the Fokker-Planck equation in dealing\nwith higher moments calculations. We include simple long-term forcing into the\nFokker-Planck equation and then seek approximate stochastic solutions. The\nformalism based on the Fokker-Planck equation with a singular perturbation\nmethod is flexible with regard to accommodating further complexity that arises\ndue to the inclusion of long-term forcing. These solutions are then applied to\nthe stochastic Arctic sea ice model with long-term forcing. Strong seasonality\nin the Arctic sea ice model combined with long-term forcing, changes the\nseasonal variability depending on the phase of the long-term forcing. The\nchange includes the shift of mean and the increase or decrease of variance and\nskewness. Stochastic realisations show that the change of the statistical\nmoments due to long-term forcing is realised by unusual fluctuations\nparticularly concentrated at a specific time of a year.\n", "  The notions of weak measurement, weak value, and two-state-vector formalism\nprovide a new quantum-theoretical frame for extracting additional information\nfrom a system in the limit of small disturbances to its state. Here, we provide\nan application to the case of two-body scattering with one body weakly\ninteracting with an environment. The direct connection to real scattering\nexperiments is pointed out by making contact with the field of impulsive\nincoherent neutron scattering from molecules and condensed systems. In\nparticular, we predict a new quantum effect in neutron-atom collisions, namely\nan observable momentum transfer deficit; or equivalently, a reduction of\neffective mass below that of the free scattering atom. Two corroborative\nexperimental findings are shortly presented. Implications for current and\nfurther experiments are mentioned. An interpretation of this effect and the\nassociated experimental results within conventional theory is currently\nunavailable.\n", "  We investigate a class of four-fermion theories which includes well-known\nmodels like the Gross-Neveu model and the Thirring model. In three spacetime\ndimensions, they are used to model interesting solid state systems like high\ntemperature superconductors and graphene. Additionally, they serve as toy\nmodels to study chiral symmetry breaking (CSB).\n  For any number of fermion flavours the Gross-Neveu model has a broken and a\nsymmetric phase, while the existence of a broken phase in the Thirring model\ndepends on the number of flavours. The critical number of fermion flavours\nbeyond which there exists no CSB is still subject of ongoing discussions. Using\nSLAC fermions we simulate the Thirring model with exact chiral symmetry. To\nobtain a chiral condensate one can introduce a symmetry-breaking mass term and\ncarefully study the limits of infinite lattice and zero-mass. So far, we did\nnot see CSB within this approach for the Thirring model with 2 or more\n(reducible) flavours.\n  The talk presents alternative approaches to investigate these findings. We\nemploy certain Fierz identities to map the Thirring model into equivalent\nfour-fermion models, for which the chiral condensate does not seem to vanish.\nIn the new formulations based on reshuffled degrees of freedom we find a sign\nproblem (which is not present in the original formulation). For this reason we\ndeveloped an algorithm similar to fermion bags, which may solve this problem.\nAs a further approach, we embed the multi-flavour Thirring model in a larger\nclass of four-fermion theories to study the chiral symmetry and its breaking in\na wider context.\n", "  Previous studies of a simple four-fermion model with staggered fermions in 3D\nhave shown the existence of an exotic quantum critical point, where one may be\nable to define a continuum limit of the Paramagnetic Strong Phase (or the PMS\nphase). We believe the existence of the critical point suggests a new mechanism\nfor generating fermion masses. In this work we begin the search for this\nquantum critical point in 4D by extending the 3D model to 4D. Unlike in 3D, now\nwe do find evidence for an intermediate spontaneously broken phase (FM phase)\nand are able compute the phase boundaries accurately. In terms of the bare\ncoupling, the width of the intermediate region appears to be quite small.\n", "  Lattice QCD calculations of radiative transitions between hadrons have in the\npast been limited to processes of hadrons stable under the strong interaction.\nRecently developed methods for $1\\to2$ transition matrix elements in a finite\nvolume now enable the determination of radiative decay rates of strongly\nunstable particles. Our lattice QCD study focuses on the process $\\pi \\pi \\to\n\\pi \\gamma^{*}$, where the $\\rho$ meson is present as an enhancement in the\ncross-section. We use $2+1$ flavors of clover fermions at a pion mass of\napproximately $320$ MeV and a lattice size of approximately $3.6$ fm. The\nrequired $2$-point and $3$-point correlation functions are constructed from a\nset of forward, sequential and stochastic light quark propagators. In addition\nto determining the $\\rho$ meson resonance parameters via the L\\\"uscher method,\nthe scattering phase shift is used in conjunction with the $1\\to2$ transition\nmatrix element formalism of Brice\\~no, Hansen and Walker-Loud to compute the\n$\\pi\\pi\\to\\pi\\gamma^{*}$ amplitude at several values of the momentum transfer\nand $\\pi\\pi$ invariant mass.\n", "  We consider a stochastic version of the Wilson-Cowan model which accommodates\nfor discrete populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The model\nassumes a finite carrying capacity with the two populations being constant in\nsize. The master equation that governs the dynamics of the stochastic model is\nanalyzed by an expansion in powers of the inverse population size, yielding a\ncoupled pair of non-linear Langevin equations with multiplicative noise.\nGillespie simulations show the validity of the obtained approximation, for the\nparameter region where the system exhibits dynamical bistability. We report\nanalytical progress by silencing the retroaction of the activators on the\ninhibitors, while still assigning the parameters so to fall in the region of\ndeterministic bistability for the excitatory species. The proposed approach\nforms the basis of a perturbative generalization which applies to the case\nwhere a modest degree of coupling is restored.\n", "  We investigate some scalar transmission problems between a classical positive\nmaterial and a negative one, whose physical coefficients are negative. First,\nwe consider cases where the negative inclusion is a disk in 2d and a ball in\n3d. Thanks to asymptotics of Bessel functions (validated numerically), we show\nwell-posedness but with some possible loses of regularity of the solution\ncompared to the classical case of transmission problems between two positive\nmaterials. Noticing that the curvature plays a central role, we then explore\nthe case of flat interfaces in the context of waveguides. In this case, the\ntransmission problem can also have some loses of regularity, or even be\nill-posed (kernel of infinite dimension).\n", "  Let $V$ be a simple vertex operator algebra containing a rank $n$ Heisenberg\nvertex algebra $H$ and let $C=\\text{Com}\\left( {H}, {V}\\right)$ be the coset of\n${H}$ in ${V}$. Assuming that the representation categories of interest are\nvertex tensor categories in the sense of Huang, Lepowsky and Zhang, a\nSchur-Weyl type duality for both simple and indecomposable but reducible\nmodules is proven. Families of vertex algebra extensions of ${C}$ are found and\nevery simple ${C}$-module is shown to be contained in at least one\n${V}$-module. A corollary of this is that if ${V}$ is rational and\n$C_2$-cofinite and CFT-type, and $\\text{Com}\\left( {C}, {V}\\right)$ is a\nrational lattice vertex operator algebra, then so is ${C}$. These results are\nillustrated with many examples and the $C_1$-cofiniteness of certain\ninteresting classes of modules is established.\n", "  The Comment by Xiong et al. (arXiv:1610.06275) criticizing my Letter [Phys.\nRev. Lett. 116, 133903 (2016)] was rejected by Physical Review Letters. In this\nReply, I show that all their claims are wrong.\n", "  We investigate the dynamical instability of the one-armed spiral m=1 mode in\ndifferentially rotating stars by means of 3+1 hydrodynamical simulations in\nNewtonian gravitation. We find that both a soft equation of state and a high\ndegree of differential rotation in the equilibrium star are necessary to excite\na dynamical m=1 mode as the dominant instability at small values of the ratio\nof rotational kinetic to potential energy, T/|W|. We find that this spiral mode\npropagates outward from its point of origin near the maximum density at the\ncenter to the surface over several central orbital periods. An unstable m=1\nmode triggers a secondary m=2 bar mode of smaller amplitude, and the bar mode\ncan excite gravitational waves. As the spiral mode propagates to the surface it\nweakens, simultaneously damping the emitted gravitational wave signal. This\nbehavior is in contrast to waves triggered by a dynamical m=2 bar instability,\nwhich persist for many rotation periods and decay only after a\nradiation-reaction damping timescale.\n", "  Charge and orbital ordering in the low-temperature monoclinic structure of\nmagnetite (Fe_3O_4) is investigated using LSDA+U. While the difference between\nt_{2g} minority occupancies of Fe^{2+}_B and Fe^{3+}_B cations is large and\ngives direct evidence for charge ordering, the screening is so effective that\nthe total 3d charge disproportion is rather small. The charge order has a\npronounced [001] modulation, which is incompatible with the Anderson criterion.\nThe orbital order agrees with the Kugel-Khomskii theory.\n", "  Charge ordering in the low-temperature monoclinic structure of iron oxoborate\n(Fe2OBO3) is investigated using the local spin density approximation (LSDA)+U\nmethod. While the difference between t_{2g} minority occupancies of Fe^{2+} and\nFe^{3+} cations is large and gives direct evidence for charge ordering, the\nstatic \"screening\" is so effective that the total 3d charge separation is\nrather small. The occupied Fe^{2+} and Fe^{3+} cations are ordered alternately\nwithin the chain which is infinite along the a-direction. The charge order\nobtained by LSDA+U is consistent with observed enlargement of the \\beta angle.\nAn analysis of the exchange interaction parameters demonstrates the\npredominance of the interribbon exchange interactions which determine the whole\nL-type ferrimagnetic spin structure.\n", "  How mixed can one component of a bi-partite system be initially and still\nbecome entangled through interaction with a thermalized partner? We address\nthis question here. In particular, we consider the question of how mixed a\ntwo-level system and a field mode may be such that free entanglement arises in\nthe course of the time evolution according to a Jaynes-Cummings type\ninteraction. We investigate the situation for which the two-level system is\ninitially in mixed state taken from a one-parameter set, whereas the field has\nbeen prepared in an arbitrary thermal state. Depending on the particular choice\nfor the initial state and the initial temperature of the quantised field mode,\nthree cases can be distinguished: (i) free entanglement will be created\nimmediately, (ii) free entanglement will be generated, but only at a later time\ndifferent from zero, (iii) the partial transpose of the joint state remains\npositive at all times. It will be demonstrated that increasing the initial\ntemperature of the field mode may cause the joint state to become distillable\nduring the time evolution, in contrast to a non-distillable state at lower\ninitial temperatures. We further assess the generated entanglement\nquantitatively, by evaluating the logarithmic negativity numerically, and by\nproviding an analytical upper bound.\n"]}
