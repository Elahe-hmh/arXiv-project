It is hoped that these\nexperiments will shed light on some long standing problems in condensed matter\nphysics. The goal of Quantum Simulation is to obtain information of homogenous\nbulk systems. However, experiments are performed in confining traps. The\nnon-uniformity of the trapping potential inevitably introduces different phases\nin the sample, making it difficult to deduce the properties of a single bulk\nphase. So far, there are no algorithms to use the experimental data to map out\nphase diagrams and important thermodynamic quantities. Here, we present an\nalgorithm to achieve this goal. Apart from phase diagram, it also maps out\nentropy density, superfluid density of superfluids, and staggered\nmagnetizations of anti-ferromagnets. Our scheme is exact within local density\napproximation.\n", "  In the area of topological and geometric treatment of phase transitions and\nsymmetry breaking in Hamiltonian systems, in a recent paper some general\nsufficient conditions for these phenomena in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric systems\n(i.e. invariant under reflection of coordinates) have been found out. In this\npaper we present a simple topological model satisfying the above conditions\nhoping to enlighten the mechanism which causes this phenomenon in more general\nphysical models. The symmetry breaking is testified by a continuous\nmagnetization with a nonanalytic point in correspondence of a critical\ntemperature which divides the broken symmetry phase from the unbroken one. A\nparticularity with respect to the common pictures of a phase transition is that\nthe nonanalyticity of the magnetization is not accompanied by a nonanalytic\nbehavior of the free energy.\n", "  If the concepts underlying Effective Theory were appreciated from the\nearliest days of Newtonian gravity, Le Verrier's announcement in 1845 of the\nanomalous perihelion precession of Mercury would have been no surprise.\nFurthermore, the size of the effect could have been anticipated through\n\"naturalness\" arguments well before the definitive computation in General\nRelativity. Thus, we have an illustration of how Effective Theory concepts can\nguide us in extending our knowledge to \"new physics\", and not just in how to\nreduce larger theories to restricted (e.g., lower energy) domains.\n", "  Our Universe is described jointly by Einstein's relativity principle and the\nquantum principle; there the existence of the smallest units of matter, such as\nelectrons, neutrinos, quarks, and photons, is well established and the smallest\nunits of matter are described by the Standard Model. Based on these, we have a\nclear picture for the propagation of ultra high energy cosmic rays (UHECR's),\nfor energies greater than $E > 10^{13}\\, eV$ but less than $E < 10^{26}\\, eV$,\nin the cosmic medium of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and of the cosmic\nbackground neutrinos (CB$\\nu$'s). We find that the CMB plays a pivot role in\nthis energy range, so that the observed \"knee(s)\" and the \"ankle\" could be\nunderstood in reasonable terms. What we might observe at the energy near\n$10^{25}\\,eV$', the so-called \"$W^\\pm$ bursts\" or \"$Z^0$ bursts\", is briefly\ndiscussed. Meanwhile, in the early Universe, the CB$\\nu$'s, in view of the tiny\nneutrino mass, gave rise to the clustering phenomenon, resulting in a neutrino\nhalo attached to each visual ordinary-matter object, such as the Earth, the\nSun, and stars - with the $PeV$ neutrinos near the surface of the Fermi-Dirac\nsphere of the neutrino halo of the Earth playing the most fundamental role.\n", "  We study the quantum complexity class QNC^0_f of quantum operations\nimplementable exactly by constant-depth polynomial-size quantum circuits with\nunbounded fan-out gates (called QNC^0_f circuits). Our main result is that the\nquantum OR operation is in QNC^0_f, which is an affirmative answer to the\nquestion of Hoyer and Spalek. In sharp contrast to the strict hierarchy of the\nclassical complexity classes: NC^0 \\subsetneq AC^0 \\subsetneq TC^0, our result\nwith Hoyer and Spalek's one implies the collapse of the hierarchy of the\ncorresponding quantum ones: QNC^0_f = QAC^0_f = QTC^0_f. Then, we show that\nthere exists a constant-depth subquadratic-size quantum circuit for the quantum\nthreshold operation. This implies the size difference between the QNC^0_f and\nQTC^0_f circuits for implementing the same quantum operation. Lastly, we show\nthat, if the quantum Fourier transform modulo a prime is in QNC^0_f, there\nexists a polynomial-time exact classical algorithm for a discrete logarithm\nproblem using a QNC^0_f oracle. This implies that, under a plausible\nassumption, there exists a classically hard problem that is solvable exactly by\na QNC^0_f circuit with gates for the quantum Fourier transform.\n", "  This paper proposes a crowd dynamic macroscopic model grounded on microscopic\nphenomenological observations which are upscaled by means of a formal\nmathematical procedure. The actual applicability of the model to real world\nproblems is tested by considering the pedestrian traffic along footbridges, of\ninterest for Structural and Transportation Engineering. The genuinely\nmacroscopic quantitative description of the crowd flow directly matches the\nengineering need of bulk results. However, three issues beyond the sole\nmodelling are of primary importance: the pedestrian inflow conditions, the\nnumerical approximation of the equations for non trivial footbridge geometries,\nand the calibration of the free parameters of the model on the basis of in situ\nmeasurements currently available. These issues are discussed and a solution\nstrategy is proposed.\n", "  In a previous article we studied PGL(n,C)-representations of a 3-manifold via\na generalization of Thurston's gluing equations. Neumann has proved some\nsymplectic properties of Thurston's gluing equations that play an important\nrole in recent developments of exact and perturbative Chern-Simons theory. In\nthis paper, we prove the symplectic properties of the PGL(n,C)-gluing equations\nfor all ideal triangulations of compact oriented 3-manifolds.\n", "  In loop quantum gravity, the quantum geometry of a black hole horizon consist\nof discrete non-perturbative quantum geometric excitations (or punctures)\nlabeled by spins, which are responsible for the quantum area of the horizon. If\nthese punctures are compared to a gas of particles, then the spins associated\nwith the punctures can be viewed as single puncture area levels analogous to\nsingle particle energy levels. Consequently, if we {\\it assume} these punctures\nto be {\\it indistinguishable}, the microstate count for the horizon resembles\nthat of Bose-Einstein counting formula for gas of particles. For the\nBekenstein-Hawking area law(BHAL) to follow from the entropy calculation in the\nlarge area limit, the Barbero-Immirzi parameter($\\g$) approximately takes a\nconstant value.\n", "  Roles represent node-level connectivity patterns such as star-center,\nstar-edge nodes, near-cliques or nodes that act as bridges to different regions\nof the graph. Intuitively, two nodes belong to the same role if they are\nstructurally similar. Roles have been mainly of interest to sociologists, but\nmore recently, roles have become increasingly useful in other domains.\nTraditionally, the notion of roles were defined based on graph equivalences\nsuch as structural, regular, and stochastic equivalences. We briefly revisit\nthese early notions and instead propose a more general formulation of roles\nbased on the similarity of a feature representation (in contrast to the graph\nrepresentation). This leads us to propose a taxonomy of three general classes\nof techniques for discovering roles that includes (i) graph-based roles, (ii)\nfeature-based roles, and (iii) hybrid roles. We also propose a flexible\nframework for discovering roles using the notion of similarity on a\nfeature-based representation. The framework consists of two fundamental\ncomponents: (a) role feature construction and (b) role assignment using the\nlearned feature representation. We discuss the different possibilities for\ndiscovering feature-based roles and the tradeoffs of the many techniques for\ncomputing them. Finally, we discuss potential applications and future\ndirections and challenges.\n", "  We point out the existence of a transition from partial to global generalized\nsynchronization (GS) in symmetrically coupled structurally different time-delay\nsystems of different orders using the auxiliary system approach and the mutual\nfalse nearest neighbor method. The present authors have recently reported that\nthere exists a common GS manifold even in an ensemble of structurally\nnonidentical scalar time-delay systems with different fractal dimensions and\nshown that GS occurs simultaneously with phase synchronization (PS). In this\npaper we confirm that the above result is not confined just to scalar\none-dimensional time-delay systems alone but there exists a similar type of\ntransition even in the case of time-delay systems with different orders. We\ncalculate the maximal transverse Lyapunov exponent to evaluate the asymptotic\nstability of the complete synchronization manifold of each of the main and the\ncorresponding auxiliary systems, which in turn ensures the stability of the GS\nmanifold between the main systems. Further we estimate the correlation\ncoefficient and the correlation of probability of recurrence to establish the\nrelation between GS and PS. We also calculate the mutual false nearest neighbor\nparameter which doubly confirms the occurrence of the global GS manifold.\n", "  When non-solid matter (e.g., liquids or gas) is under constant volume V and\ndensity rho (e.g., in rigid box), spatial positions for their constituents are\nrestricted by these conditions. We recently focus on the role of constraint in\nclassical statistical thermodynamics, and find how spatial constraint connects\nwith equilibrium properties for crystalline solids, which has not been\nclarified so far. The present study extend the idea to non-solid matter under\nNVT ensemble in classical systems. We provide explicit representation of\ncanonical average of radial distribution function in terms of spatial\nconstraint, which can be well characterized by a single special microscopic\nstate on configuration space called projection state for non-solid matter. We\ndemonstrate that the special microscopic state can be numerically constructed\nfor a finite number of particles.\n", "  The fermionic signature operator is analyzed on globally hyperbolic\nLorentzian surfaces. The connection between the spectrum of the fermionic\nsignature operator and geometric properties of the surface is studied. The\nfindings are illustrated by simple examples and counterexamples.\n", "  Since Quantum Choromdynamics allows for gluon self-coupling, quarks and\ngluons cannot be observed as free particles, but only their bound states, the\nhadrons. This so-called confinement phenomenon is responsible for $98\\%$ of the\nmass in the visible universe. The measurement of the hadron excitation spectra\ntherefore gives valuable input for theory and phenomenology to quantitatively\nunderstand this phenomenon. One simple model to describe hadrons is the\nConstituent Quark Model (CQM), which knows two types of hadrons: mesons,\nconsisting of a quark and an antiquark, and baryons, which are made out of\nthree quarks. More advanced models, which are inspired by QCD as well as\ncalculations within Lattice QCD predict the existence of other types of\nhadrons, which may be e.g. described solely by gluonic excitations (glueballs)\nor mixed quark and gluon excitations (hybrids). In order to search for such\nstates, the COMPASS experiment at the Super Proton Synchrotron at CERN has\ncollected large data sets, which allow to study the light-quark meson and\nbaryon spectra in unmatched precision. The overview shown here focuses on the\nlight meson sector, presenting a detailed Partial-Wave Analysis of the\nprocesses: $\\pi^- p \\to \\pi^-\\pi^+\\pi^- p$ and $\\pi^-p\\to \\pi^-\\pi^0\\pi^0p$. A\nnew state, the $a_1(1420)$ with $J^{PC}=1^{++}$ is observed. Its Breit-Wigner\nparameters are found to be in the ranges: $m = 1412-1422\\,\\mathrm{MeV}/c^2$ and\n$\\Gamma = 130-150\\,\\mathrm{MeV}/c^2$. In the same analysis, a signal in a wave\nwith $J^{PC}=1^{-+}$ is observed. A resonant origin of this signal would not be\nexplicable within the CQM. In addition to this possibility of an exotic state,\na possible non resonant origin of this signal is discussed.\n", "  We introduce project NIHAO (Numerical Investigation of a Hundred\nAstrophysical Objects), a set of 100 cosmological zoom-in hydrodynamical\nsimulations performed using the gasoline code, with an improved implementation\nof the SPH algorithm. The haloes in our study range from dwarf to Milky Way\nmasses, and represent an unbiased sampling of merger histories, concentrations\nand spin parameters. The particle masses and force softenings are chosen to\nresolve the mass profile to below 1% of the virial radius at all masses,\nensuring that galaxy half-light radii are well resolved. Using the same\ntreatment of star formation and stellar feedback for every object, the\nsimulated galaxies reproduce the observed inefficiency of galaxy formation\nacross cosmic time as expressed through the stellar mass vs halo mass relation,\nand the star formation rate vs stellar mass relation. We thus conclude that\nstellar feedback is the chief piece of physics required to limit the efficiency\nof star formation in galaxies less massive than the Milky Way.\n", "  The tautochrone on a cycloid curve is usually considered without drag force.\nIn this work, we investigate the motion of a damped cycloidal pendulum under\npresence of a drag force. Using the Lagrange formulation, and considering\nlinear dependence with velocity for damping force, we found the dynamics of the\nsystem to remain tautochrone. This dictates the possibility for studying the\ntautochrone experimentally, e.g. the cycloidal pendulum in water or oil.\n", "  Vortex arrays in type-II superconductors admit the translational symmetry of\nan infinite system. There are cases, however, like ultra-cold trapped Fermi\ngases and the crust of neutron stars, where finite-size effects make it quite\nmore complex to account for the geometrical arrangement of vortices. Here, we\nself-consistently generate these arrays of vortices at zero and finite\ntemperature through a microscopic description of the non-homogeneous superfluid\nbased on a differential equation for the local order parameter, obtained by\ncoarse graining the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) equations. In this way, the\nstrength of the inter-particle interaction is varied along the BCS-BEC\ncrossover, from largely overlapping Cooper pairs in the BCS limit to dilute\ncomposite bosons in the BEC limit. Detailed comparison with two landmark\nexperiments on ultra-cold Fermi gases, aimed at revealing the presence of the\nsuperfluid phase, brings out several features that makes them relevant for\nother systems in nature as well.\n", "  Full waveform inversion (FWI) delivers high-resolution images of the\nsubsurface by minimizing iteratively the misfit between the recorded and\ncalculated seismic data. It has been attacked successfully with the\nGauss-Newton method and sparsity promoting regularization based on fixed\nmultiscale transforms that permit significant subsampling of the seismic data\nwhen the model perturbation at each FWI data-fitting iteration can be\nrepresented with sparse coefficients. Rather than using analytical transforms\nwith predefined dictionaries to achieve sparse representation, we introduce an\nadaptive transform called the Sparse Orthonormal Transform (SOT) whose\ndictionary is learned from many small training patches taken from the model\nperturbations in previous iterations. The patch-based dictionary is constrained\nto be orthonormal and trained with an online approach to provide the best\nsparse representation of the complex features and variations of the entire\nmodel perturbation. The complexity of the training method is proportional to\nthe cube of the number of samples in one small patch. By incorporating both\ncompressive subsampling and the adaptive SOT-based representation into the\nGauss-Newton least-squares problem for each FWI iteration, the model\nperturbation can be recovered after an l1-norm sparsity constraint is applied\non the SOT coefficients. Numerical experiments on synthetic models demonstrate\nthat the SOT-based sparsity promoting regularization can provide robust FWI\nresults with reduced computation.\n", "  We aim to build a simple model of a gas with temperature ($T$) in thermal\nequilibrium with a black-body that plays the role of the adiabatically\nexpanding universe, so that each particle of such a gas mimics a kind of\n\"particle\" (quantum) of dark energy, which is inside a very small area of space\nso-called Planck area ($l_p^{2}$), that is the minimum area of the whole\nspace-time represented by a huge spherical surface with area $4\\pi r_u^2$,\n$r_u$ being the Hubble radius. So we should realize that such spherical surface\nis the surface of the black-body for representing the universe, whose\ntemperature ($T$) is related to an acceleration ($a$) of a proof particle that\nexperiences the own black-body radiation according to the Unruh effect. Thus,\nby using this model, we derive the law of universal gravitation, which leads us\nto understand the anti-gravity in the cosmological scenario and also estimate\nthe tiny order of magnitude of the cosmological constant in agreement with the\nobservational data.\n", "  We study the motion of neutral and charged spinning bodies in curved\nspace-time in the test-particle limit. We construct equations of motion using a\nclosed covariant Poisson-Dirac bracket formulation which allows for different\nchoices of the hamiltonian. We derive conditions for the existence of constants\nof motion and apply the formalism to the case of spherically symmetric\nspace-times. We show that the periastron of a spinning body in a stable orbit\nin a Schwarzschild or Reissner-Nordstr{\\o}m background not only precesses, but\nalso varies radially. By analysing the stability conditions for circular motion\nwe find the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) as a function of spin. It\nturns out that there is an absolute lower limit on the ISCOs for increasing\nprograde spin. Finally we establish that the equations of motion can also be\nderived from the Einstein equations using an appropriate energy-momentum tensor\nfor spinning particles.\n", "  In this paper we present a model for the electronic excited states of $\\pi$\nconjugated -acene molecules such as tetracene, pentacene, and hexacene. We use\na simple Hubbard model with a limited basis to describe the low lying\nexcitations with reasonable quantitative accuracy. We are able to produce\nsemi-analytic wavefunctions for the electronic states of the system, which\nallows us to compute the density correlation functions for various states such\nas the ground state, the first two singly excited states, and the lowest lying\ndoubly excited state. We show that in this lowest lying doubly excited state, a\nstate speculated to play a role in the singlet fission process, the electrons\nand holes behave in a triplet-like manner. We also compute the two-photon\nabsorption of these -acenes, and show that per number density it is comparable\nto that of other organic molecules such as coronene and\nhexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene (HBC).\n", "  We find a large class of two-dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ SCFTs obtained\nby compactifying four-dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=1$ quiver gauge theories on a\nRiemann surface. We study these theories using anomalies and $c$-extremization.\nThe gravitational duals to these fixed points are new AdS$_3$ solutions of IIB\nsupergravity which we exhibit explicitly. Along the way we uncover a universal\nrelation between the conformal anomaly coefficients of four-dimensional and\ntwo-dimensional SCFTs connected by an RG flow across dimensions. We also\nobserve an interesting novel phenomenon in which the superconformal R-symmetry\nmixes with baryonic symmetries along the RG flow.\n", "  The process $pp \\to W^-c$ produces polarized charm quarks. The polarization\nis expected to be partly retained in $\\Lambda_c$ baryons when those form in the\n$c$-quark hadronization. We argue that it will likely be possible for ATLAS and\nCMS to measure the $\\Lambda_c$ polarization in the $W$+$c$ samples in Run 2 of\nthe LHC. This can become the first measurement ever of a longitudinal\npolarization of charm quarks. Its results will provide a unique input to the\nunderstanding of polarization transfer in fragmentation. They will also allow\napplying the same measurement technique to other (e.g., new physics) samples of\ncharm quarks in which the polarization is a priori unknown. The proposed\nanalysis is similar to the ATLAS and CMS measurements of the $W$+$c$ cross\nsection in the 7 TeV run that used reconstructed $D$-meson decays for charm\ntagging.\n", "  Recently LHCb predicted spin 1 and spin 3 states D* s1(2860) and D* s3(2860)\nwhich are studied through their strong decays, and are assigned to fit the\n13D1and 13D3 states in the charm spectroscopy. In this paper,using the heavy\nquark effective theory, we state that assigning D*s1(2860) as the mixing of\n13D1 - 23S1 states, is rather a better justification to its observed\nexperimental values than a pure state. We study its decay modes variation with\nhadronic coupling constant gxh and the mixing angle . We appoint spin 3 state\nD* s3(2860) as the missing 1D 3- JP state, and also study its decay channel\nbehavior with coupling constant gyh. To appreciate the above results, we check\nthe variation of decay modes for their spin partners states i.e. 1D2 and 1D'2\nwith their masses and strong coupling constant i.e. gxh and gyh. Our\ncalculation using HQET approach give mixing angle between the 13D1 - 23S1 state\nfor D* s1(2860) to lie in the range (-1.6 radians < theta < -1.2 radians). Our\ncalculation for coupling constant values gives gxh to lie between value 0:17 <\ngxh < 0:20 and gyh to be 0.40. We expect from experiments to observe this\nmixing angle to verify our results.\n", "  Tensor networks provide a natural framework for exploring holographic duality\nbecause they obey entanglement area laws. They have been used to construct\nexplicit toy models realizing many interesting structural features of the\nAdS/CFT correspondence, including the non-uniqueness of bulk operator\nreconstruction in the boundary theory. In this article, we explore the\nholographic properties of networks of random tensors. We find that our models\nnaturally incorporate many features that are analogous to those of the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence. When the bond dimension of the tensors is large, we show that\nthe entanglement entropy of boundary regions, whether connected or not, obey\nthe Ryu-Takayanagi entropy formula, a fact closely related to known properties\nof the multipartite entanglement of assistance. Moreover, we find that each\nboundary region faithfully encodes the physics of the entire bulk entanglement\nwedge. Our method is to interpret the average over random tensors as the\npartition function of a classical ferromagnetic Ising model, so that the\nminimal surfaces of Ryu-Takayanagi appear as domain walls. Upon including the\nanalog of a bulk field, we find that our model reproduces the expected\ncorrections to the Ryu-Takayanagi formula: the minimal surface is displaced and\nthe entropy is augmented by the entanglement of the bulk field. Increasing the\nentanglement of the bulk field ultimately changes the minimal surface\ntopologically in a way similar to creation of a black hole. Extrapolating bulk\ncorrelation functions to the boundary permits the calculation of the scaling\ndimensions of boundary operators, which exhibit a large gap between a small\nnumber of low-dimension operators and the rest. While we are primarily\nmotivated by AdS/CFT duality, our main results define a more general form of\nbulk-boundary correspondence which could be useful for extending holography to\nother spacetimes.\n", "  We study quantum manipulation based on four Majorana bound states in\nX-junction geometry. The parameter space of this setup is bigger than of the\npreviously studied Y-junction and is described by SO(4) symmetry group. In\norder for quantum computation to be dephasing free, two Majorana states have to\nstay degenerate at all times. We find a condition necessary for that and\ncompute the Berry's phase, $2\\alpha$, accumulated during the manipulation. We\nconstruct simple protocols for the variety of values of $\\alpha$, including\n$\\pi/8$ needed for the purposes of quantum computation. Although the\nmanipulations in general X-junction geometry are not topologically protected,\nthey may prove to be a feasible compromise for aims of quantum computation.\n", "  It is demonstrated that a Stueckelberg-type gauge theory, coupled to the\nscalar-tensor theory of gravity, is invariant under both gauge and Weyl\ntransformations. Unlike the pure Stueckelberg theory, this coupled Lagrangian\nhas a genuine Weyl symmetry, with a non-vanishing current. The above is true in\nthe Jordan frame, whereas in the Einstein frame, the same theory manifests as\nProca theory in presence of pure gravity. It is found that broken scale\ninvariance leads to simultaneous spontaneous breaking of the gauge symmetry.\n", "  In conventional metals, electronic transport in a magnetic field is\ncharacterized by the motion of electrons along orbits on the Fermi surface,\nwhich usually causes an increase in the resistivity through averaging over\nvelocities. Here we show that large deviations from this behavior can arise in\ndensity-wave systems close to their ordering temperature. Specifically,\nenhanced scattering off collective fluctuations can lead to a change of\ndirection of the orbital motion on reconstructed pockets. In weak magnetic\nfields, this leads to linear magnetoconductivity, the sign of which depends on\nthe electric-field direction. At a critical magnetic field, the conductivity\ncrosses zero for certain directions, signifying a thermodynamic instability of\nthe density-wave state.\n", "  Small systems in contact with a heat bath evolve by stochastic dynamics. Here\nwe show that, when one such small system is weakly coupled to another one, it\nis possible to infer the presence of such weak coupling by observing the\nviolation of the steady state fluctuation theorem for the partial entropy\nproduction of the observed system. We give a general mechanism due to which the\nviolation of the fluctuation theorem can be significant, even for weak\ncoupling. We analytically demonstrate on a realistic model system that this\nmechanism can be realized by applying an external random force to the system.\nIn other words, we find a new fluctuation theorem for the entropy production of\na partial system, in the limit of weak coupling.\n", "  We give a short and basic introduction to our covariant\nDyson-Schwinger-Bethe-Salpeter-equation approach using a rainbow-ladder\ntruncated model of QCD, in which we investigate the leptonic decay properties\nof heavy quarkonium states in the pseudoscalar and vector channels. Comparing\nthe magnitudes of decay constants, we identify radial 1-- excitations in our\ncalculation with experimental excitations of J/\\Psi and \\Upsilon. Particular\nattention is paid to those states regarded as D-wave states in the quark model.\nWe predict e+e- decay width of the \\Upsilon(1^3D_1) and \\Upsilon(2^3D_1) states\nof the order of ca. 15 eV or more. We also provide a set of predictions for\ndecay constants of pseudoscalar radial excitations in heavy quarkonia.\n", "  We present a closed form expression for the semiclassical OPE coefficients\nthat are universal for all 2D CFTs with a \"weak\" light spectrum, by taking the\nsemiclassical limit of the fusion kernel. We match this with a properly\nregularized and normalized bulk action evaluated on a geometry with three\nconical defects, analytically continued in the deficit angles beyond the range\nfor which a metric with positive signature exists. The analytically continued\ngeometry has a codimension-one coordinate singularity surrounding the heaviest\nconical defect. This singularity becomes a horizon after Wick rotating to\nLorentzian signature, suggesting a connection between universality and the\nexistence of a horizon.\n", "  It was shown recently that boundary terms of conformal anomalies recover the\nuniversal contribution to the entanglement entropy and also play an important\nrole in the boundary monotonicity theorem of odd-dimensional quantum field\ntheories. Motivated by these results, we investigate relationships between\nboundary anomalies and the stress tensor correlation functions in conformal\nfield theories. In particular, we focus on how the conformal Ward identity and\nthe renormalization group equation are modified by boundary central charges.\nRenormalized stress tensors induced by boundary Weyl invariants are also\ndiscussed, with examples in spherical and cylindrical geometries.\n", "  A conserved stress energy tensor for weak field gravitational waves\npropagating in vacuum is derived directly from the linearized wave equation\nalone, for an arbitrary gauge using standard general relativity. In any\nharmonic gauge, the form of the tensor leads directly to the classical\nexpression for the outgoing wave energy. The method described here, however, is\na much simpler, shorter, and more physically motivated approach than is the\ncustomary procedure, which involves a lengthy and cumbersome second-order (in\nwave-amplitude) calculation starting with the Einstein tensor. Our method has\nthe added advantage of exhibiting the direct coupling between the outgoing\nenergy flux in gravitational waves and the work done by the gravitational field\non the sources. For nonharmonic gauges, the directly derived wave stress tensor\nhas an apparent index asymmetry. This coordinate artefact may be removed, and\nthe symmetrized (still gauge-invariant) tensor then takes on its widely-used\nform. Angular momentum conservation follows immediately. For any harmonic\ngauge, however, the stress tensor is manifestly symmetric from the start and\nits derivation depends, in its entirety, on the structure of the linearized\nwave equation.\n", "  We present the results of a photon cluster search in the gamma-ray sky\nobserved by the Fermi Large Area Telescope, using the new Pass 8 dataset, at\nenergies higher than 10 GeV. By means of the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)\nalgorithm, we found 25 clusters associated with catalogued blazars not\npreviously known as gamma-ray emitters. The properties of these sources are\ndiscussed.\n", "  We construct the five-dimensional supergravity dual of the $\\mathcal{N}=1^*$\nmass deformation of the $\\mathcal{N} =4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on\n$S^4$ and use it to calculate the universal contribution to the corresponding\n$S^4$ free energy at large 't Hooft coupling in the planar limit. The\nholographic RG flow solutions are smooth and preserve four supercharges. As a\nnovel feature compared to the holographic duals of $\\mathcal{N} = 1^*$ on\n$\\mathbb{R}^4$, in our backgrounds the five-dimensional dilaton has a\nnon-trivial profile, and the gaugino condensate is fixed in terms of the\nmass-deformation parameters. Important aspects of the analysis involve\ncharacterizing the ambiguities in the partition function of non-conformal\n$\\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric theories on $S^4$ as well as the action of\nS-duality on the $\\mathcal{N}=1^*$ theory.\n", "  We revisit the problem of determining the Arctic curve in the six-vertex\nmodel with domain wall boundary conditions. We describe an alternative method,\nby which we recover the previously conjectured analytic expression in the\nsquare domain. We adapt the method to work for a large class of domains, and\nfor other models exhibiting limit shape phenomena. We study in detail some\nexamples, and derive, in particular, the Arctic curve of the six-vertex model\nin a triangoloid domain at the ice-point.\n", "  Supernova remnants (SNRs) in Local Group galaxies offer unique insights into\nthe origin of different types of supernovae. In order to take full advantage of\nthese insights, one must understand the intrinsic and environmental diversity\nof SNRs in the context of their host galaxies. We introduce a semi-analytic\nmodel that reproduces the statistical properties of a radio continuum-selected\nSNR population, taking into account the detection limits of radio surveys, the\nrange of SN kinetic energies, the measured ISM and stellar mass distribution in\nthe host galaxy from multi-wavelength images and the current understanding of\nelectron acceleration and field amplification in SNR shocks from\nfirst-principle kinetic simulations. Applying our model to the SNR population\nin M33, we reproduce the SNR radio luminosity function with a median SN rate of\n$\\sim 3.1 \\times 10^{-3}$ per year and an electron acceleration efficiency,\n$\\epsilon_{\\rm{e}} \\sim 4.2 \\times 10^{-3}$. We predict that the radio\nvisibility times of $\\sim 70\\%$ of M33 SNRs will be determined by their\nSedov-Taylor lifetimes, and correlated with the measured ISM column density,\n$N_H$ ($t_{\\rm{vis}} \\propto N_H^{-a}$, with $a \\sim 0.33$) while the remaining\nwill have visibility times determined by the detection limit of the radio\nsurvey. These observational constraints on the visibility time of SNRs will\nallow us to use SNR catalogs as `SN surveys' to calculate SN rates and delay\ntime distributions in the Local Group.\n", "  Using first-principles electronic structure calculations, we studied the\nelectronic and thermoelectric properties of SrTiO3 based oxide materials and\ntheir nanostructures identifying those nanostructures which possess highly\nanisotropic electronic bands. We showed recently that highly anisotropic\nflat-and-dispersive bands can maximize the thermoelectric power factor, and at\nthe same time they can produce low dimensional electronic transport in bulk\nsemiconductors. Although most of the considered nanostructures show such highly\nanisotropic bands, their predicted thermoelectric performance is not improved\nover that of SrTiO3. Besides highly anisotropic character, we emphasize the\nimportance of the large weights of electronic states participating in transport\nand the small effective mass of charge carriers along the transport direction.\nThese requirements may be better achieved in binary transition metal oxides\nthan in ABO3 perovskite oxide materials.\n", "  We perform ab initio calculations of the coupling between electrons and\nsmall-momentum polar-optical phonons in monolayer transition metal\ndichalcogenides of the 2H type: MoS2, MoSe2, MoTe2, WS2, and WSe2. The\nso-called Fr\\\"ohlich interaction is fundamentally affected by the\ndimensionality of the system. In a plane-wave framework with periodic boundary\nconditions, this coupling is affected by the spurious interaction between the\n2D material and its periodic images. To overcome this, we perform density\nfunctional perturbation theory calculations with a truncated Coulomb\ninteraction in the out-of-plane direction. We show that the 2D Fr\\\"ohlich\ninteraction is much stronger than assumed in previous ab initio studies. We\nprovide analytical models depending on the effective charges and dielectric\nproperties of the materials to interpret our ab initio calculations. Screening\nis shown to play a fundamental role in the phonon-momentum dependency of the\npolar-optical coupling, with a crossover between two regimes depending on the\ndielectric properties of the material relative to its environment. The\nFr\\\"ohlich interaction is screened by the dielectric environment in the limit\nof small phonon momenta and sharply decreases due to stronger screening by the\nmonolayer at finite momenta. The small-momentum regime of the ab initio\nFr\\\"ohlich interaction is reproduced by a simple analytical model, for which we\nprovide the necessary parameters. At larger momenta, however, direct ab initio\ncalculations of electron-phonon interactions are necessary to capture\nband-specific effects. We compute and compare the carrier relaxation times\nassociated to the scattering by both LO and A1 phonon modes. While both modes\nare capable of relaxing carriers on timescales under the picosecond at room\ntemperature, their absolute and relative importance vary strongly depending on\nthe material, the band, and the substrate.\n", "  The semimetal-superconductor quantum phase transition on the two-dimensional\n(2D) surface of a 3D topological insulator is conjectured to exhibit an\nemergent $\\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry, based on a renormalization group (RG)\nanalysis at one-loop order in the $\\epsilon$ expansion. We provide additional\nsupport for this conjecture by performing a three-loop RG analysis and showing\nthat the supersymmetric fixed point found at this order survives the\nextrapolation to 2D. We compute critical exponents to order $\\epsilon^3$,\nobtaining the more accurate value $\\nu\\approx 0.985$ for the correlation length\nexponent and confirming that the fermion and boson anomalous dimensions remain\nunchanged beyond one loop, as expected from non-renormalization theorems in\nsupersymmetric theories. We further couple the system to a dynamical $U(1)$\ngauge field, and argue that the transition becomes fluctuation-induced first\norder. We discuss implications of this result for quantum phase transitions\nbetween certain symmetry-preserving correlated surface states of 3D topological\ninsulators.\n", "  According to the Virial Theorem, all gravitational systems in equilibrium sit\non a plane in the 3D parameter space defined by their mass, size and second\nmoment of the velocity tensor. While these quantities cannot be directly\nobserved, there are suitable proxies: the luminosity Lk, half-light radius Re\nand dispersion sigma_e. These proxies indeed lie on a very tight Fundamental\nPlane (FP). How do the black holes in the centers of galaxies relate to the FP?\nTheir masses are known to exhibit no strong correlation with total galaxy mass,\nbut they do correlate weakly with bulge mass (when present), and extremely well\nwith the velocity dispersion through the Mbh = sigma_e^5.4 relation. These\nfacts together imply that a tight plane must also exist defined by black hole\nmass, total galaxy mass and size. Here I show that this is indeed the case\nusing a heterogeneous set of 230 black holes. The sample includes BHs from zero\nto 10 billion solar masses and host galaxies ranging from low surface\nbrightness dwarfs, through bulge-less disks, to brightest cluster galaxies. The\nresulting BH-size-luminosity Mbh=(Lk/Re)^3.8 has the same amount of scatter as\nthe M-sigma relation and is aligned with the galaxy FP, such that it is just a\nre-projection of sigma. The inferred BH-size-mass relation is\nMbh=(M_star/Re)^2.9. These relationships are universal and extend to galaxies\nwithout bulges. This implies that the black hole is primarily correlated with\nits global velocity dispersion and not with the properties of the bulge. I show\nthat the classical bulge--mass relation is a projection of the M-sigma\nrelation. When the velocity dispersion cannot be measured (at high-z or low\ndispersions), the BH-size-mass relation should be used as a proxy for black\nhole mass in favor of just galaxy or bulge mass.\n", "  In this work we study the short-range contributions that induce effective\nlepton number violating (LNV) interactions. We obtain a full set of constraints\non the effective short-range couplings from a large variety of low-energy\n$|\\Delta L|= 2$ processes of pseudoscalar mesons $K, D, D_s, B$, and\n$\\tau$-lepton. These constraints provide complementary and additional\ninformation to the one obtained from the neutrinoless double-$\\beta$\n($0\\nu\\beta\\beta$) decay. As expected, the bounds on electron-electron\nshort-range couplings are the only ones that are strongly constrained by the\n$0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay. Although weaker, LNV effective couplings with different\nflavours are not accessible to $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay and these can be probe by\nthe $|\\Delta L|= 2$ processes in consideration.\n", "  We show that for two-band systems nonsymmorphic symmetries may enforce the\nexistence of band crossings in the bulk, which realize Fermi surfaces of\nreduced dimensionality. We find that these unavoidable crossings originate from\nthe momentum dependence of the nonsymmorphic symmetry, which puts strong\nrestrictions on the global structure of the band configurations. Three\ndifferent types of nonsymmorphic symmetries are considered: (i) a unitary\nnonsymmorphic symmetry, (ii) a nonsymmorphic magnetic symmetry, and (iii) a\nnonsymmorphic symmetry combined with inversion. For nonsymmorphic symmetries of\nthe latter two types, the band crossings are located at high-symmetry points of\nthe Brillouin zone, with their exact positions being determined by the algebra\nof the symmetry operators. To characterize these band degeneracies we introduce\na \\emph{global} topological charge and show that it is of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ type,\nwhich is in contrast to the \\emph{local} topological charge of Fermi points in,\nsay, Weyl semimetals. To illustrate these concepts, we discuss the $\\pi$-flux\nstate as well as the SSH model at its critical point and show that these two\nmodels fit nicely into our general framework of nonsymmorphic two-band systems.\n", "  The mechanical resonance properties of a micro-electro-mechanical oscillator\nwith a gap of 1.25 $\\mu$m was studied in superfluid $^3$He-B at various\npressures. The oscillator was driven in the linear damping regime where the\ndamping coefficient is independent of the oscillator velocity. The quality\nfactor of the oscillator remains low ($Q\\approx 80$) down to 0.1 $T_c$, 4\norders of magnitude less than the intrinsic quality factor measured in vacuum\nat 4 K. In addition to the Boltzmann temperature dependent contribution to the\ndamping, a damping proportional to temperature was found to dominate at low\ntemperatures. We propose a multiple scattering mechanism of the surface Andreev\nbound states to be a possible cause for the anomalous damping.\n", "  We examine the dynamics of a compressible active nematic liquid crystal on a\nfrictional substrate. When frictional damping dominates over viscous\ndissipation, we eliminate flow in favor of active stresses to obtain a minimal\ndynamical model for the nematic order parameter, with elastic constants\nrenormalized by activity. The renormalized elastic constants can become\nnegative at large activity, leading to the selection of spatially inhomogeneous\npatterns via a mechanism analogous to that responsible for modulated phases\narising at an equilibrium Lifshitz point. Tuning activity and the degree of\nnematic order in the passive system, we obtain a linear stability phase diagram\nthat exhibits a nonequilibrium tricritical point where ordered, modulated and\ndisordered phases meet. Numerical solution of the nonlinear equations yields a\nsuccession of spatial structures of increasing complexity with increasing\nactivity, including kink walls and active turbulence, as observed in\nexperiments on microtubule bundles confined at an oil-water interface. Our work\nprovides a minimal model for an overdamped active nematic that reproduces all\nthe nonequilibrium structures seen in simulations of the full active nematic\nhydrodynamics and provides a framework for understanding some of the mechanisms\nfor selection of the nonequilibrium patterns in the language of equilibrium\ncritical phenomena.\n", "  Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in three-level systems uses a\nstrong control laser on one transition to modify the absorption of a weak probe\nlaser on a second transition. The control laser creates dressed states whose\ndecay pathways show interference. We study the role of dressed-state\ninterference in causing EIT in the three types of three-level systems -- lambda\n($\\Lambda$), ladder ($\\Xi$), and vee (V). In order to get realistic values for\nthe linewidths of the energy levels involved, we consider appropriate hyperfine\nlevels of $^{87}$Rb. For such realistic systems, we find that dressed-state\ninterference causes probe absorption---given by the imaginary part of the\nsusceptibility---to go to zero in a $\\Lambda$ system, but plays a negligible\nrole in $\\Xi$ and V systems.\n", "  Artificial spin-orbit coupling in optical lattices can be engineered to tune\nband structure into extreme regimes where the single-particle band flattens\nleaving only inter-particle interactions to define many-body states of matter.\nLin et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett 112, 110404 (2014)] showed that under such\nconditions interactions lead to a Wigner crystal of fermionic atoms under\napproximate conditions: no bandwidth or band mixing. The excitations were shown\nto possess emergent kinetics with fractionalized charge derived entirely from\ninteractions. In this work we use numerical exact diagonalization to study a\nmore realistic model with non-zero bandwidth and band mixing. We map out the\nstability phase diagram of the Wigner crystal. We find that emergent properties\nof the Wigner crystal excitations remain stable for realistic experimental\nparameters. Our results validate the approximations made by Lin et al. and\ndefine parameter regimes where strong interaction effects generate emergent\nkinetics in optical lattices.\n", "  Recently a nonsymmorphic topological insulator was predicted, where the\ncharacteristic feature is the emergence of a \"hourglass fermion\" surface state\nprotected by the nonsymmorphic symmetry. Such a state has already been observed\nexperimentally. We propose a simple model possessing the hourglass fermion\nsurface state. The model is constructing by stacking the quantum-spin-Hall\ninsulators with the interlayer coupling introduced so as to preserve the\nnonsymmorphic symmetry and the time reversal symmetry. The Dirac theory is also\nderived, whose analytical results reproduce the hourglass fermion surface state\nremarkably well. Furthermore, we discuss how the hourglass state is destroyed\nby introducing perturbations based on the symmetry analysis. Our results show\nthat the hourglass fermion surface state is universal in the helical edge\nsystem with the nonsymmorphic symmetry.\n", "  High pressure and high temperature properties of AB (A = $^6$Li, $^7$Li; B =\nH, D, T) are investigated with first-principles method comprehensively. It is\nfound that the H$^{-}$ sublattice features in the low-pressure electronic\nstructure near the Fermi level of LiH are shifted to that dominated by the\nLi$^{+}$ sublattice in compression. The lattice dynamics is studied in\nquasi-harmonic approximation, from which the phonon contribution to the free\nenergy and the isotopic effects are accurately modelled with the aid of a\nparameterized double-Debye model. The obtained equation of state (EOS) matches\nperfectly with available static experimental data. The calculated principal\nHugoniot is also in accordance with that derived from shock wave experiments.\nUsing the calculated principal Hugoniot and the previous theoretical melting\ncurve, we predict a shock melting point at 56 GPa and 1923 K. In order to\nestablish the phase diagram for LiH, the phase boundaries between the B1 and B2\nsolid phases are explored. The B1-B2-liquid triple point is determined at about\n241 GPa and 2413 K. The remarkable shift in the phase boundaries by isotopic\neffect and temperature reveal the significant role played by lattice\nvibrations. Furthermore, the Hugoniot of the static-dynamic coupling\ncompression is assessed. Our EOS suggests that a precompression of the sample\nto 50 GPa will allow the shock Hugoniot passing through the triple point and\nentering the B2 solid phase. This transition leads to a discontinuity with 4.6%\nvolume collapse, about four times greater than the same B1-B2 transition at\nzero temperature.\n", "  A general procedure to find static and axially symmetric, interior solutions\nto the Einstein equations is presented. All the so obtained solutions, verify\nthe energy conditions for a wide range of values of the parameters, and match\nsmoothly to some exterior solution of the Weyl family, thereby representing\nglobally regular models describing non spherical sources of gravitational\nfield. In the spherically symmetric limit, all our models converge to the well\nknown incompressible perfect fluid solution.The key stone of our approach is\nbased on an ansatz allowing to define the interior metric in terms of the\nexterior metric functions evaluated at the boundary source. Some particular\nsources are obtained, and the physical variables of the energy-momentum tensor\nare calculated explicitly, as well as the geometry of the source in terms of\nthe relativistic multipole moments. The total mass of different configurations\nis also calculated, it is shown to be equal to the monopole of the exterior\nsolution.\n", "  Spectra of the neutral heavy mesons, $\\eta_c(1S,2S)$, $J/\\psi$, $\\psi(2S)$,\n$\\eta_b(1S,2S,3S)$, $\\Upsilon(1S,2S,3S)$, $D$, $D^\\ast$, $B$, $B^\\ast$, $B_s$\nand $B_s^\\ast$, in a homogeneous magnetic field are analyzed in a potential\nmodel of constituent quarks. To obtain anisotropic wave functions and the\ncorresponding eigenvalues, the cylindrical Gaussian expansion method is\napplied, where the wave functions for transverse and longitudinal directions in\nthe cylindrical coordinate are expanded by the Gaussian bases separately.\nEnergy level structures in the wide range of magnetic fields are obtained and\nthe deformation of the wave functions is shown, which reflects effects of the\nspin mixing, the Zeeman splitting and quark Landau levels. The contribution\nfrom the magnetic catalysis in heavy-light mesons is discussed as a change of\nthe light constituent quark mass.\n", "  Biomembranes, which are mainly composed of neutral and charged lipids,\nexhibit a large variety of functional structures and dynamics. Here, we report\na coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of the phase separation and\nmorphological dynamics in charged lipid bilayer vesicles. The screened\nlong-range electrostatic repulsion among charged head groups delays or inhibits\nthe lateral phase separation in charged vesicles compared with neutral\nvesicles, suggesting the transition of the phase-separation mechanism from\nspinodal decomposition to nucleation or homogeneous dispersion. Moreover, the\nelectrostatic repulsion causes morphological changes, such as pore formation,\nand further transformations into disk, string, and bicelle structures, which\nare spatiotemporally coupled to the lateral segregation of charged lipids.\nBased on our coarse-grained MD simulation, we propose a plausible mechanism of\npore formation at the molecular level. The pore formation in a\ncharged-lipid-rich domain is initiated by the prior disturbance of the local\nmolecular orientation in the domain.\n", "  Tokamaks with up-down asymmetric poloidal cross-sections spontaneously rotate\ndue to turbulent transport of momentum. In this work, we investigate the effect\nof the Shafranov shift on this intrinsic rotation, primarily by analyzing\ntokamaks with tilted elliptical flux surfaces. By expanding the Grad-Shafranov\nequation in the large aspect ratio limit we calculate the magnitude and\ndirection of the Shafranov shift in tilted elliptical tokamaks. The results\nshow that, while the Shafranov shift becomes up-down asymmetric and depends\nstrongly on the tilt angle of the flux surfaces, it is insensitive to the shape\nof the current and pressure profiles (when the geometry, total plasma current,\nand average pressure gradient are kept fixed). Next, local nonlinear\ngyrokinetic simulations of these MHD equilibria are performed with GS2, which\nreveal that the Shafranov shift can significantly enhance the momentum\ntransport. However, to be consistent, the effect of $\\beta'$ (i.e. the radial\ngradient of $\\beta$) on the magnetic equilibrium was also included, which was\nfound to significantly reduce momentum transport. Including these two competing\neffects broadens the rotation profile, but leaves the on-axis value of the\nrotation roughly unchanged. Consequently, the shape of the $\\beta$ profile has\na significant effect on the rotation profile of an up-down asymmetric tokamak.\n", "  We describe a new phenomenon of `bar damping' that may have played an\nimportant role in shaping the Milky Way bar and bulge as well as its spiral\nstructure. We use a collisionless N-body simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy\ninitially composed of a dark matter halo and an exponential disk with Toomre\nparameter slightly above unity. In this configuration, dominated by the disk in\nthe center, a bar forms relatively quickly, after 1 Gyr of evolution. This is\nimmediately followed by the formation of two manifold-driven spiral arms and\nthe outflow of stars that modifies the potential in the vicinity of the bar,\napparently shifting the position of the L_1/L_2 Lagrange points. This\nmodification leads to the shortening of the bar and the creation of a next\ngeneration of manifold-driven spiral arms at a smaller radius. The process\nrepeats itself a few times over the next 0.5 Gyr resulting in further\nsubstantial weakening and shortening of the bar. The time when the damping\ncomes to an end coincides with the first buckling episode in the bar which\nrebuilds the orbital structure so that no more new spiral arms are formed. The\nmorphology of the bar and the spiral structure at this time show remarkable\nsimilarity to the present properties of the Milky Way. Later on, the bar starts\nto grow rather steadily again, weakened only by subsequent buckling episodes\noccurring at more distant parts of the disk.\n", "  Background: Deformed neutron-rich magnesium isotopes constitute a fascinating\nterritory where the interplay between collective rotation and single-particle\nmotion is strongly affected by the neutron continuum. The unbound $fp$-shell\nnucleus $ ^{39}\\text{Mg} $ is an ideal candidate to study this interplay.\nPurpose: In this work, we predict the properties of low-lying resonant states\nof $ ^{39}\\text{Mg} $, using a suite of realistic theoretical approaches rooted\nin the open quantum system framework. Method: To describe the spectrum and\ndecay modes of $ ^{39}\\text{Mg} $ we use the conventional Shell Model, Gamow\nShell Model, Resonating Group Method, Density Matrix Renormalization Group\nmethod, and the non-adiabatic Particle-Plus-Rotor model formulated in the\nBerggren basis. Results: The unbound ground state of $ ^{39}\\text{Mg} $ is\npredicted to be either a $ J^{\\pi} = {7/2}^- $ state or a $ {3/2}^- $ state. A\nnarrow $ J^{\\pi} = {7/2}^- $ ground-state candidate exhibits a resonant\nstructure reminiscent of that of its one-neutron halo neighbor $ ^{37}\\text{Mg}\n$, which is dominated by the $ f_{7/2} $ partial wave at short distances and a\n$ p_{3/2} $ component at large distances. A $ J^{\\pi}={3/2}^- $ ground-state\ncandidate is favored by the large deformation of the system. It can be\nassociated with the $ {1/2}^- [321] $ Nilsson orbital dominated by the $\\ell=1$\nwave; hence its predicted width is large. The excited $J^{\\pi} = {1/2}^-$ and\n$5/2^-$ states are expected to be broad resonances, while the $ J^{\\pi} =\n{9/2}^- $ and $ {11/2}^- $ members of the ground-state rotational band are\npredicted to have very small neutron decay widths. Conclusion: We demonstrate\nthat the subtle interplay between deformation, shell structure, and continuum\ncoupling can result in a variety of excitations in an unbound nucleus just\noutside the neutron drip line.\n", "  The initial stage of the small-scale ionization-induced instability\ndeveloping inside the fused silica volume exposed to the femtosecond laser\npulse is studied as a possible initial cause of the self-organized nanograting\nformation. We have calculated the spatial spectra of the instability with the\nelectron-hole diffusion taken into account for the first time and have found\nthat it results in the formation of some hybrid (diffusion-wave) 1D structure\nwith the spatial period determined as geometrical mean of the laser wavelength\nand characteristic diffusion length of the process considered. Near the\nthreshold of the instability this period occurs to be approximately equal to\nthe laser half-wavelength in the silica, close to the one experimentally\nobserved.\n", "  Context: For over 12 yr, we have carried out a precise radial velocity survey\nof a sample of 373 G and K giant stars using the Hamilton \\'Echelle\nSpectrograph at Lick Observatory. There are, among others, a number of multiple\nplanetary systems in our sample as well as several planetary candidates in\nstellar binaries. Aims: We aim at detecting and characterizing\nsubstellar+stellar companions to the giant star HD 59686 A (HR 2877, HIP\n36616). Methods: We obtained high precision radial velocity (RV) measurements\nof the star HD 59686 A. By fitting a Keplerian model to the periodic changes in\nthe RVs, we can assess the nature of companions in the system. In order to\ndiscriminate between RV variations due to non-radial pulsation or stellar spots\nwe used infrared RVs taken with the CRIRES spectrograph at the Very Large\nTelescope. Additionally, to further characterize the system, we obtain\nhigh-resolution images with LMIRCam at the Large Binocular Telescope. Results:\nWe report the likely discovery of a giant planet with a mass of $m_{p}~\\sin\ni=6.92_{-0.24}^{+0.18}~M_{Jup}$ orbiting at $a_{p}=1.0860_{-0.0007}^{+0.0006}$\nau from the giant star HD 59686 A. Besides the planetary signal, we discover an\neccentric ($e_{B}=0.729_{-0.003}^{+0.004}$) binary companion with a mass of\n$m_{B}~\\sin i=0.5296_{-0.0008}^{+0.0011}~M_{Sun}$ orbiting at a semi-major axis\nof just $a_{B}=13.56_{-0.14}^{+0.18}$ au. Conclusions: The existence of the\nplanet HD 59686 Ab in a tight eccentric binary system severely challenges\nstandard giant planet formation theories and requires substantial improvements\nto such theories in tight binaries. Otherwise, alternative planet formation\nscenarios such as second generation planets or dynamical interactions in an\nearly phase of the system's lifetime should be seriously considered in order to\nbetter understand the origin of this enigmatic planet.\n", "  In mixed-valence or heavy-fermion systems, the hybridization between local\n$f$ orbitals and conduction band states can cause the suppression of long-range\nmagnetic order, which competes with strong spin fluctuations. Ce- and Yb-based\nsystems have been found to exhibit fascinating physical properties\n(heavy-fermion superconductivity, non-Fermi-liquid states, etc.) when tuned to\nthe vicinity of magnetic quantum critical points by use of various external\ncontrol parameters (temperature, magnetic field, chemical composition).\nRecently, similar effects (mixed-valence, Kondo fluctuations, heavy Fermi\nliquid) have been reported to exist in some Eu-based compounds. Unlike Ce (Yb),\nEu has a multiple electron (hole) occupancy of its $4f$ shell, and the magnetic\nEu$^{2+}$ state ($4f^7$) has no orbital component in the usual $LS$ coupling\nscheme, which can lead to a quite different and interesting physics. In the\nEuCu$_{2}$(Si$_{x}$Ge$_{1-x}$)$_{2}$ series, where the valence can be tuned by\nvarying the Si/Ge ratio, it has been reported that a significant valence\nfluctuation can exist even in the magnetic order regime. This paper presents a\ndetailed study of the latter material using different microscopic probes\n(XANES, M\\\"ossbauer spectroscopy, elastic and inelastic neutron scattering), in\nwhich the composition dependence of the magnetic order and dynamics across the\nseries is traced back to the change in the Eu valence state. In particular, the\nresults support the persistence of valence fluctuations into the\nantiferromagnetic state over a sizable composition range below the critical Si\nconcentration $x_c \\approx 0.65$. The sequence of magnetic ground states in the\nseries is shown to reflect the evolution of the magnetic spectral response.\n", "  We examine the dynamics after a sudden quench in the magnetic field of the\nLipkin-Meshkov-Glick model. Starting from the groundstate and by employing the\ntime-dependent fidelity, we see manifestly different dynamics are present if\nthe system is quenched through the critical point. Furthermore, we show that\nthe average work shows no sensitivity to the quantum phase transition, however\nthe free energy and irreversible work show markedly different rates of change\nin each phase. Finally, we assess the spectral function showing the fundamental\nexcitations that dictate the dynamics of the post-quenched system, further\nhighlighting the qualitative differences between the dynamics in the two\nphases.\n", "  Using 482~pb$^{-1}$ of $e^+e^-$ collision data collected at a center-of-mass\nenergy of $\\sqrt{s} = 4.009$ GeV with the BESIII detector, we measure the\nbranching fractions of the decays $D_s^+\\to\\mu^+\\nu_\\mu$ and\n$D_s^+\\to\\tau^+\\nu_\\tau$. By constraining the ratio of decay rates of $D_s^+$\nto $\\tau^+\\nu_\\tau$ and to $\\mu^+\\nu_\\mu$ to the Standard Model prediction, the\nbranching fractions are determined to be $\\mathcal{B}(D_s^+ \\to \\mu^+\\nu_\\mu) =\n(0.495 \\pm 0.067 \\pm 0.026)\\%$ and $\\mathcal{B}(D_s^+ \\to \\tau^+\\nu_\\tau) =\n(4.83 \\pm 0.65 \\pm 0.26)\\%$. Using these branching fractions, we obtain a value\nfor the decay constant $f_{D_s^+}$ of $(241.0 \\pm 16.3 \\pm 6.5)~\\text{MeV}$,\nwhere the first error is statistical and the second systematic.\n", "  The network architecture of the human brain has become a feature of\nincreasing interest to the neuroscientific community, largely because of its\npotential to illuminate human cognition, its variation over development and\naging, and its alteration in disease or injury. Traditional tools and\napproaches to study this architecture have largely focused on single scales --\nof topology, time, and space. Expanding beyond this narrow view, we focus this\nreview on pertinent questions and novel methodological advances for the\nmulti-scale brain. We separate our exposition into content related to\nmulti-scale topological structure, multi-scale temporal structure, and\nmulti-scale spatial structure. In each case, we recount empirical evidence for\nsuch structures, survey network-based methodological approaches to reveal these\nstructures, and outline current frontiers and open questions. Although\npredominantly peppered with examples from human neuroimaging, we hope that this\naccount will offer an accessible guide to any neuroscientist aiming to measure,\ncharacterize, and understand the full richness of the brain's multiscale\nnetwork structure -- irrespective of species, imaging modality, or spatial\nresolution.\n", "  We show the principal ability of bypassing damaged demyelinated portions of\nnervous tissue, thereby restoring its normal function for the passage of action\npotentials. We carry out a theoretical analysis on the basis of the\nsynchronization mechanism of action potential propagation along a bundle of\nneurons, proposed recently in [1]. And we discuss the feasibility of implement\na bypass to restore damaged nervous tissue and creating an artificial neuron\nnetwork.\n", "  A new way of constructing unextendible maximally entangled basis (UMEB) from\nmaximally entangled basis (MEB) is proposed. Consequently, it is shown that if\nthere is an $N$-member UMEB in $\\mathbb{C}^d\\otimes \\mathbb{C}^d$, then there\nexists a $(qd)^2-q(d^2-N)$-member UMEB in $\\mathbb{C}^{qd}\\otimes\n\\mathbb{C}^{qd}$ for any $q\\in\\mathbb{N}$. This improves the results in [Phys.\nRev. A 90, 034301(2014)], which shows that there exists a\n$(qd)^2-(d^2-N)$-member UMEB in $\\mathbb{C}^{qd}\\otimes \\mathbb{C}^{qd}$\nprovided that an $N$-member UMEB exsits in $\\mathbb{C}^d\\otimes \\mathbb{C}^d$.\nIn addition, a very easy way of constructing UMEB in $\\mathbb{C}^d\\otimes\n\\mathbb{C}^{d'}$ with $d<d'$ is presented, which promotes and covers all the\nprevious related work.\n", "  We report on a planar microwave resonator providing arbitrarily polarized\noscillating magnetic fields that enable selective excitation of the electronic\nspins of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. The polarization plane is\nparallel to the surface of diamond, which makes the resonator fully compatible\nwith (111)-oriented diamond. The field distribution is spatially uniform in a\ncircular area with a diameter of 4 mm, and a near-perfect circular polarization\nis achieved. We also demonstrate that the original resonance frequency of 2.8\nGHz can be varied in the range of 2-3.2 GHz by introducing varactor diodes that\nserve as variable capacitors.\n", "  Arbitrary generalization to the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity\nloses local Lorentz invariance to reparametrize the orthonormal coordinate\nsystem and gives rise to asymmetry field equations. We investigate consequences\nof local Lorentz violation to primordial fluctuations in extended single field\ninflationary models based on the scalar-tensor formulation of the torsion\nscalar $T$ that effectively includes $f(T)$ gravity as a special case. We show\nthat despite some asymmetry part of the field equations are removed in a\nspatially homogeneous and isotropic cosmic background, no subhorizon\nscalar-perturbation mode can survive by the time of horizon crossing. As a\nresult, any scalar field mediated in torsion cannot generate enough primordial\ndensity inhomogeneity alone, even if it brings some de Sitter background\nsolutions in generalized teleparallel gravity.\n", "  We present the results of a cluster search in the Fermi-LAT Pass 8 gamma-ray\nsky by means of the Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm, at energies higher than 10\nGeV and at Galactic latitudes higher than 25 degrees. The selected clusters\nhave a minimum number of photons higher than or equal to 5, a high degree of\nconcentration, and are without a clear corresponding counterpart in blazar\ncatalogues. A sample of 30 possible gamma-ray sources was obtained. These\nobjects were verified by applying the standard Maximum Likelihood analysis on\nthe Fermi-LAT data. A search for possible radio counterparts in a circle having\na radius of 6 arcmin was performed, finding several interesting objects, the\nmajority of them without optical spectroscopical data. These can be considered\nas new blazar candidates. Some of them were already noticed as possible blazars\nor Active Galactic Nuclei in previous surveys, but never associated with high\nenergy emission. These possible counterparts are reported and their properties\nare discussed.\n", "  The magnetic and electronic properties of trilayer La4Ni3O8, similar to hole\ndoped cuprates, are investigated by performing full-potential linearized\naugmented plane wave method-based spin-polarized calculations with LDA and GGA\nfunctionals including Hubbard U parameters to account for strong correlation\neffects. Based on these calculations, we found that La4Ni3O8 is a C-type\nantiferromagnetic (C-AFM) Mott insulator in agreement with previous\nexperimental and theoretical observations. Our calculations suggest that Ni1+\nand Ni2+ ions are found to be in high spin state with an average valency of\n+1.33. Intermediate band gap states are originated from dz2 electrons of both\ntypes of Ni ions after including the strong correlation effects. In order to\nunderstand the role of hole doping on electronic structure, phase stability,\nand magnetic properties of La4Ni3O8, similar calculations have been performed\nfor La(4-x)Sr(x)Ni3O8 as a function of x, using the supercell approach. We have\nfound that the hole doping brings insulator-to-metal transition without\nchanging the C-AFM ordering though the magnetic moment is enhanced at both Ni\nsites. Moreover, these Ni atoms are always in an average valence state\nirrespective of hole doping or volume change. So the electronic properties of\nhole doped La4Ni3O8 can not be compared with hole doped cuprates which are high\nTc.\n", "  Enceladus's gravity and shape have been explained in terms of a thick\nisostatic ice shell floating on a global ocean, in contradiction of the thin\nshell implied by librations. Here we propose a new isostatic model minimizing\ncrustal deviatoric stress, and demonstrate that gravity and shape data predict\na $\\rm{38\\pm4\\,km}$-thick ocean beneath a $\\rm{23\\pm4\\,km}$-thick shell\nagreeing with -- but independent of -- libration data. Isostatic and tidal\nstresses are comparable in magnitude. South polar crust is only $7\\pm4\\rm\\,km$\nthick, facilitating the opening of water conduits and enhancing tidal\ndissipation through stress concentration. Enceladus's resonant companion,\nDione, is in a similar state of minimum stress isostasy. Its gravity and shape\ncan be explained in terms of a $\\rm{99\\pm23\\,km}$-thick isostatic shell\noverlying a $\\rm{65\\pm30\\,km}$-thick global ocean, thus providing the first\nclear evidence for a present-day ocean within Dione.\n", "  Helium spin echo experiments combined with ab initio-based Langevin molecular\ndynamics simulations are used to quantify the adsorbate-substrate coupling\nduring the thermal diffusion of Na atoms on Cu(111). An analysis of\ntrajectories within the local density friction approximation allows the\ncontribution from electron-hole pair excitations to be separated from the total\nenergy dissipation. Despite the minimal electronic friction coefficient of Na\nand the relatively small mass mismatch to Cu promoting efficient phononic\ndissipation, about $(20\\pm5)\\%$ of the total energy loss is attributable to\nelectronic friction. The results suggest a significant role of electronic\nnon-adiabaticity in the rapid thermalization generally relied upon in adiabatic\ndiffusion theories.\n", "  The mean spherical approximation (MSA) is a closure relation for pair\ncorrelation functions (two-point functions) in statistical physics. It can be\napplied to a wide range of systems, is computationally fairly inexpensive, and\nwhen properly applied and interpreted lead to rather good results.\n  In this paper we promote its applicability to euclidean quantum field\ntheories formulated on a lattice, by demonstrating how it can be used to locate\nthe critical lines of a class of multi-component bosonic models. The MSA has\nthe potential to handle models lacking a positive definite integration measure,\nwhich therefore are difficult to investigate by Monte-Carlo simulations.\n", "  The method of relative weights, coupled with mean field theory, is applied to\nthe problem of simulating gauge theories with dynamical staggered fermions at\nfinite densities. We present initial results and discuss issues so far\nencountered.\n", "  The electrical conductivity of graphene with a nonzero mass-gap parameter is\ninvestigated starting from the first principles of quantum electrodynamics in\n(2+1)-dimensional space-time at any temperature. The formalism of the\npolarization tensor defined over the entire plane of complex frequency is used.\nAt zero temperature we reproduce the results for both real and imaginary parts\nof the conductivity, obtained previously in the local approximation, and\ngeneralize them taking into account the effects of nonlocality. At nonzero\ntemperature the exact analytic expressions for real and imaginary parts of the\nlongitudinal and transverse conductivities of gapped graphene are derived, as\nwell as their local limits and approximate expressions in several asymptotic\nregimes. Specifically, a simple local result for the real part of conductivity\nof gapped graphene valid at any temperature is obtained. According to our\nresults, the real part of the conductivity is not equal to zero for frequencies\nexceeding the width of the gap and goes to the universal conductivity with\nincreasing frequency. The imaginary part of conductivity of gapped graphene\nvaries from infinity at zero frequency to minus infinity at the frequency\ndefined by the gap parameter and then goes to zero with further increase of\nfrequency. The analytic expressions are accompanied by the results of numerical\ncomputations. Possible future generalization of the used formalism is\ndiscussed.\n", "  We report the first direct observation of electron emission into the vacuum\nas a result of a VVV Auger transition resulting from the relaxation of a deep\nhole in the valence band. A beam of low energy (<1.25eV) positrons was used to\ndeposit positrons onto the surface of samples consisting of single layer\ngraphene, multi-layer graphene and graphite. The distribution of electrons\nemitted from the samples as a result of the annihilation of the positron showed\npeak extending up to ~12 eV with a maximum at ~4eV. The observed peak was ~17\ntimes larger than the previously observed annihilation induced C KVV peak. An\nanalysis based upon a density functional theory calculation of the positron\nannihilation rates indicates that the width and intensity of the peak is\nconsistent with electron emission resulting from VVV Auger transition excited\nby the annihilation of valence band electrons. Good agreement was found between\nthe data from the single layer graphene on Cu surface with a theoretical line\nshape found from a self-folding of the density of states for a free standing\ngraphene layer. The agreement between the theoretical and measured intensities\nfor the KVV and VVV transitions indicates that the branching ratio for holes to\ndecay via an Auger transition is nearly the same in both cases (i.e. close to\n100%). Our results suggest the possibility of using annihilation induced VVV\nAuger spectroscopy to study the properties of the local density of states and\nthe hole decay processes in materials in which the valence band width exceeds\nthe work function.\n", "  We consider the ferromagnetic Ising model with spatially dependent external\nfields on a Cayley tree, and we investigate the conditions for the existence of\nthe phase transition for a class of external fields, asymptotically approaching\na homogeneous critical external field. Our results extend earlier results by\nRozikov and Ganikhodjaev.\n", "  Socio-economic inequality is measured using various indices. The Gini ($g$)\nindex, giving the overall inequality is the most commonly used, while the\nrecently introduced Kolkata ($k$) index gives a measure of $1-k$ fraction of\npopulation who possess top $k$ fraction of wealth in the society. This article\nreviews the character of such inequalities, as seen from a variety of data\nsources, the apparent relationship between the two indices, and what toy models\ntell us. These socio-economic inequalities are also investigated in the context\nof man-made social conflicts or wars, as well as in natural disasters. Finally,\nwe forward a proposal for an international institution with sufficient fund for\nvisitors, where natural and social scientists from various institutions of the\nworld can come to discuss, debate and formulate further developments.\n", "  Gravitational wave transients are caused by some of the most energetic events\nin the Universe, and a precise location would allow deep examination of the\ncounterpart by electromagnetic waves (telescopes collecting light), the\ncombination of GW and EM resulting in very much improved science return\n(multi-messenger Astronomy). Since the GW detectors do not provide good\nlocalization on the sky, the faint counterpart will be very difficult to find.\nOne strategy to help the search is to look first where mass is concentrated and\nthus the prior probability of GW events is highest. In the first part of this\npaper, we present methods used to estimate stellar masses and metallicities of\ngalaxies and galaxy clusters in different catalogs. In the second part of the\npaper, we test our estimation accuracy by comparing our results with stellar\nmasses given in Stripe 82 Massive Galaxy Catalogue (S82-MGC). The relation\nbetween stellar mass we found and that from S82-MGC is provided for GWGC,\n2MASS-GLADE, and WISExSCOS catalog in the last part of the paper. Our results\nare used in an interactive web-based tool (Skymap Viewer) for astronomers to\ndecide where to look first in EM follow-up observations of GW events in the\nfuture.\n", "  The paper focuses on finding out several physical quantities to exert an\ninfluence on the spatial parameters of complex-octonion curved space, including\nthe metric coefficient, connection coefficient, and curvature tensor. In the\nflat space described with the complex octonions, the radius vector is combined\nwith the integrating function of field potential to become a composite radius\nvector. And the latter can be considered as the radius vector in a flat\ncomposite-space (a function space). Further it is able to deduce some formulae\nbetween the physical quantity and spatial parameter, in the complex-octonion\ncurved composite-space. Under the condition of weak field approximation, these\nformulae infer a few results accordant with the General Theory of Relativity.\nThe study reveals that it is capable of ascertaining which physical quantities\nare able to result in the warping of space, in terms of the curved\ncomposite-space described with the complex octonions. Moreover, the method may\nbe expanded into some curved function spaces, seeking out more possible\nphysical quantities to impact the bending degree of curved spaces.\n", "  Since the launch of the Fermi Large Area Telescope in 2008 the number of\nknown ${\\gamma}$-ray pulsars has increased immensely to over 200, many of which\nare also visible in the radio and X-ray bands. Seyffert et al. (2011)\ndemonstrated how constraints on the viewing geometries of some of these pulsars\ncould be obtained by comparing their observed radio and ${\\gamma}$-ray light\ncurves by eye to light curves from geometric models. While these constraints\ncompare reasonably well with those yielded by more rigorous single-wavelength\napproaches, they are still a somewhat subjective representation of how well the\nmodels reproduce the observed radio and ${\\gamma}$-ray light curves.\nConstructing a more rigorous approach is, however, made difficult by the large\nuncertainties associated with the ${\\gamma}$-ray light curves as compared to\nthose associated with the radio light curves. Naively applying a\n${\\chi}^{2}$-like goodness-of-fit test to both bands invariably results in\nconstraints dictated by the radio light curves. A number of approaches have\nbeen proposed to address this issue. In this paper we investigate these\napproaches and evaluate the results they yield. Based on what we learn, we\nimplement our own version of a goodness-of-fit test, which we then use to\ninvestigate the behaviour of the geometric models in multi-dimensional phase\nspace.\n", "  Searches for compact mid-IR nebulae with the Spitzer Space Telescope and the\nWide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), accompanied by spectroscopic\nobservations of central stars of these nebulae led to the discovery of many\ndozens of massive stars at different evolutionary stages, of which the most\nnumerous are candidate luminous blue variables (LBVs). In this paper, we give a\ncensus of candidate and confirmed Galactic LBVs revealed with Spitzer and WISE,\nand present some new results of spectroscopic observations of central stars of\nmid-IR nebulae.\n", "  Star-forming galaxies at $z > 1$ exhibit significantly different properties\nto local galaxies of equivalent stellar mass. Not only are high-redshift\nstar-forming galaxies characterized by higher star formation rates and gas\nfractions than their local counterparts, they also appear to host star-forming\nregions with significantly different physical conditions, including greater\nelectron densities. To understand what physical mechanisms are responsible for\nthe observed evolution of star-forming conditions we have assembled the largest\nsample of star-forming galaxies at $z\\sim 1.5$ with emission-line measurements\nof the $\\mathrm{[OII]} \\lambda \\lambda 3726,3729$ doublet. By comparing our\n$z\\sim 1.5$ sample to local galaxy samples with equivalent distributions of\nstellar mass, star formation rate and specific star formation rate we\ninvestigate the proposed evolution in electron density and its dependence on\nglobal properties. We measure an average electron density of $114_{-27}^{+28}\n\\, \\mathrm {cm}^{-3} $ for our $z\\sim 1.5$ sample, a factor of five greater\nthan the typical electron density of local star-forming galaxies. However, we\nfind no offset between the typical electron densities of local and\nhigh-redshift galaxies with equivalent star-formation rates. Our work indicates\nthat the average electron density of a sample is highly sensitive to the star\nformation rates, implying that the previously observed evolution is mainly the\nresult of selection effects.\n", "  We consider the spectrum of transfer matrix eigenvalues associated with\nPolyakov loops in lattice QCD at strong coupling. The transfer matrix at finite\ndensity is non-Hermitian, and its eigenvalues become complex as a manifestation\nof the sign problem. We show that the symmetry under charge conjugation and\ncomplex conjugation ensures that the eigenvalues are either real or part of a\ncomplex conjugate pair, and the complex pairs lead to damped oscillatory\nbehavior in Polyakov loop correlation functions, which also appeared in our\nprevious phenomenological models using complex saddle points. We argue that\nthis effect should be observable in lattice simulations of QCD at finite\ndensity.\n", "  We present a systematic means to impose Galilean invariance within field\ntheory. We begin by defining the most general background geometries consistent\nwith Galilean invariance and then turn to applications within effective field\ntheory, fluid dynamics, and the quantum Hall effect.\n", "  We investigate experimentally the influence of the liquid viscosity on the\nproblem of the generation of waves by a turbulent wind at the surface of a\nliquid, extending the results of Paquier, Moisy and Rabaud [Phys. Fluids {\\bf\n27}, 122103 (2015)] over nearly three decades of viscosity. The surface\ndeformations are measured with micrometer accuracy using the Free-Surface\nSynthetic Schlieren method. We recover the two regimes of surface deformations\npreviously identified: the wrinkles regime at small wind velocity, resulting\nfrom the viscous imprint on the liquid surface of the turbulent fluctuations in\nthe boundary layer, and the regular wave regime at large wind velocity. Below\nthe wave threshold, we find that the characteristic amplitude of the wrinkles\nscales as $\\nu^{-1/2} u^{* 3/2}$ over nearly the whole range of viscosities,\nwhereas their size are essentially unchanged. We propose a simple model for\nthis scaling, which compares well with the data. We finally show that the\ncritical friction velocity $u^*$ for the onset of regular waves slowly\nincreases with viscosity as $\\nu^{0.2}$. Whereas the transition between\nwrinkles and waves is smooth at small viscosity, including for water, it\nbecomes rather abrupt at large viscosity. Finally, a new regime is found at\n$\\nu > 100-200 \\times 10^{-6}$~m$^2$~s$^{-1}$, characterized by a slow, nearly\nperiodic emission of large-amplitude isolated fluid bumps.\n", "  We propose a representation of angulon in which the angulon operator is\ndecomposable relative to the field of Hilbert spaces over the probability\nmeasure space, and the probability measure corresponds to the total-number\noperator of phonons. In this representation we are able to find the system of\n$N+1$ equations whose solutions form the eigenspace of the angulon operator,\nwhere $1\\leq N<\\infty$ is the number of phonon excitations. Using this result\nwe estimate the infimum of the spectrum. In the special case $N=1$, the lowest\nenergy approximates to the value which is already known in the literature. Our\nfindings indicate that two-phonon excitations ($N=2$) contribute notably to the\nenergy of a molecule in superfluid $^4$He.\n", "  The thermoelectric figures of merit of pristine two-dimensional materials are\npredicted to be significantly less than unity, making them uncompetitive as\nthermoelectric materials. Here we elucidate a new strategy that overcomes this\nlimitation by creating multi-layer nanoribbons of two different materials and\nallowing thermal and electrical currents to flow perpendicular to their planes.\nTo demonstrate this enhancement of thermoelectric efficiency ZT, we analyse the\nthermoelectric performance of monolayer molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) sandwiched\nbetween two graphene monolayers and demonstrate that the cross-plane (CP) ZT is\nsignificantly enhanced compared with the pristine parent materials. For the\nparent monolayer of MoS2, we find that ZT can be as high as approximately 0.3,\nwhereas monolayer graphene has a negligibly small ZT. In contrast for the\ngraphene/MoS2/graphene heterostructure, we find that the CP ZT can be as large\nas 2.8. One contribution to this enhancement is a reduction of the thermal\nconductance of the van der Waals heterostructure compared with the parent\nmaterials, caused by a combination of boundary scattering at the MoS2/graphene\ninterface which suppresses the phonons transmission and the lower Debye\nfrequency of monolayer MoS2, which filters phonons from the monolayer graphene.\nA second contribution is an increase in the electrical conductance and Seebeck\ncoefficient associated with molybdenum atoms at the edges of the nanoribbons.\n", "  Extended Vicsek fractals (EVF) are the structures constructed by introducing\nlinear spacers into traditional Vicsek fractals. Here we study the Laplacian\nspectra of the EVF. In particularly, the recurrence relations for the Laplacian\nspectra allow us to obtain an analytic expression for the sum of all inverse\nnonvanishing Laplacian eigenvalues. This quantity characterizes the large-scale\nproperties, such as the gyration radius of the polymeric structures, or the\nglobal mean-first passage time for the random walk processes. Introduction of\nthe linear spacers leads to local heterogeneities, which reveal themselves, for\nexample, in the dynamics of EVF under external forces.\n", "  Social movements use social computing systems to complement offline\nmobilizations, but prior literature has focused almost exclusively on movement\nactors' use of social media. In this paper, we analyze participation and\nattention to topics connected with the Black Lives Matter movement in the\nEnglish language version of Wikipedia between 2014 and 2016. Our results point\nto the use of Wikipedia to (1) intensively document and connect historical and\ncontemporary events, (2) collaboratively migrate activity to support coverage\nof new events, and (3) dynamically re-appraise pre-existing knowledge in the\naftermath of new events. These findings reveal patterns of behavior that\ncomplement theories of collective memory and collective action and help explain\nhow social computing systems can encode and retrieve knowledge about social\nmovements as they unfold.\n", "  We present direct observation of the M1 transition between the fine structure\nsplitting in the 4f13 5s2 5p6 2F ground state of W VIII. The spectroscopic data\nof few-times ionized tungsten ions are important for the future ITER\ndiagnostics, but there is a serious lack of data. The present study is part of\nan ongoing effort to solve this lack. Emission from the tungsten ions produced\nand trapped in a compact electron beam ion trap is observed with a\nCzerny-Turner visible spectrometer. Spectra in the EUV range are also observed\nat the same time to help the identification of the previously-unreported\nvisible lines. The observed wavelength 574.47 pm 0.03 nm (air), which\ncorresponds to the fine structure splitting of 17402.5 pm 0.9 cm-1, shows\nreasonable agreement with the previously reported value 17410 pm 5 cm-1\nobtained indirectly through the analysis of EUV spectra [Ryabtsev et al., Atoms\n3 (2015) 273].\n", "  A wormhole solution is presented on a braneworld scenery, the material source\nis given by a perfect fluid on brane that does not violate the energy\nconditions. we propose an ansatz for the state equation resulting in a family\nof solutions that satisfy necessary conditions over the free parameters of the\nsolution. The effect of projecting the 5D Weyl tensor components on the brane,\ngive the conditions to have a wormhole satisfying the NEC, besides\nsimultaneously guaranteeing the absence of horizons. Furthermore, our model\npredicts an astronomical bound for the wormhole throat.\n", "  The in-plane acoustic behavior of non-centrosymmetric lattices having nodes\nendowed with mass and gyroscopic inertia and connected by massless ligaments\nwith asymmetric elastic properties has been analysed through a discrete model\nand a continuum micropolar model. In the first case the propagation of harmonic\nwaves and the dispersion functions have been obtained by the discrete\nFloquet-Bloch approach. It is shown that the optical branch departs from a\ncritical point with vanishing group velocity and for the considered cases this\nbranch is decreasing for increasing the norm of the wave vector from the long\nwave limit. A micropolar continuum model, useful to approximate the discrete\nmodel, has been derived through a continualization method based on a\ndown-scaling law based on a second-order Taylor expansion of the generalized\nmacro-displacement field. It is worth noting that the second order elasticity\ntensor coupling curvatures and micro-couples turns out to be negative defined\nalso in the general case of non-centrosymmetric lattice. The eigenvalue problem\ngoverning the harmonic propagation in the micropolar non-centrosymmetric\ncontinuum results in general characterized by a hermitian full matrix that is\nexact up to the second order in the wave vector. Examples concerning square and\nequilateral triangular lattices and their acoustic properties have been\nanalysed from both the exact Lagrangian model (within the assumed hypotheses)\nand the micropolar approximate model. Finally, in consideration of the negative\ndefiniteness of the second order elastic tensor of the micropolar model, the\nloss of strong hyperbolicity of the equation of motion has been investigated.\n", "  Non-equilibrium effects play a vital role in high-speed and rarefied gas\nflows and the accurate simulation of these flow regimes are far beyond the\ncapability of near-local-equilibrium Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations. Eu\nproposed generalized hydrodynamic equations which are consistent with the laws\nof irreversible thermodynamics to solve this problem. Based on Eu's generalized\nhydrodynamics equations, a computational model, namely the nonlinear coupled\nconstitutive relations(NCCR),was developed by R.S.Myong and applied\nsuccessfully to one-dimensional shock wave structure and two-dimensional\nrarefied flows. In this paper, finite volume schemes, including LU-SGS time\nadvance scheme, MUSCL interpolation and AUSMPW+ scheme, are fistly adopted to\ninvestigate NCCR model's validity and potential in three-dimensional complex\nhypersonic rarefied gas flows. Moreover, in order to solve the computational\nstability problems in 3D complex flows,a modified solution is developed for the\nNCCR model. Finally, the modified solution is tested for a slip complex flow\nover a 3D hollow cylinder-flare configuration. The numerical results show that\nthe NCCR model by the modified solution yields good solutions in better\nagreement with the DSMC results and experimential data than NSF equations, and\nimply NCCR model's great potential capability in further application.\n", "  According to General Relativity gravity is the result of the interaction\nbetween matter and space-time geometry. In this interaction space-time geometry\nitself is dynamical: it can store and transport energy and momentum in the form\nof gravitational waves. We give an introductory account of this phenomenon and\ndiscuss how the observation of gravitational waves may open up a fundamentally\nnew window on the universe.\n", "  The Research Data Alliance (RDA, https://www.rd-alliance.org/) aims at\nenabling research data sharing without barriers. It was founded in March 2013\nby the Australian Government, the European Commission, and the USA NSF and\nNIST. It is a bottom-up organisation which after 2 years and a half of\nexistence gathers around 3,000 members from 100 different countries. Work in\nRDA is organised in a bottom-up way, through Working Groups and Interest Groups\nproposed by the community. These Groups can deal with any aspect of research\ndata sharing, which means a huge diversity in the activities. Some scientific\ncommunities use the RDA as a neutral place to hold the discussions about their\ndisciplinary interoperability framework. Astronomy has the IVOA and the FITS\nCommittee for that purpose, and the ADASS Colloquia to deal with astronomical\ndata systems. But many RDA topics are of interest for us, for instance data\ncitation, including citation of dynamic data bases and data repositories, or\ncertification of data repositories. Also lessons learnt in building the IVOA\nand data sharing in astronomy are injected in the discussion of RDA\norganisation and procedures. The RDA is a unique platform to meet data\npractitioners from many countries, disciplines and profiles, to grasp ideas to\nimprove our data practices, to identify topics of common interest and to raise\ninteresting subjects for discussion involving specialists from many disciplines\nand countries by proposing new Interest and Working Groups.\n", "  M31N 2008-12a is a remarkable recurrent nova within the Andromeda Galaxy.\nWith eleven eruptions now identified, including eight in the past eight years,\nthe system exhibits a recurrence period of one year, and possibly just six\nmonths. This short inter eruption period is driven by the combination of a high\nmass white dwarf ($1.38\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$) and high mass accretion rate\n($\\sim1.6\\times10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot\\,\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$). Such a high\naccretion rate appears to be provided by the stellar wind of a red giant\ncompanion. Deep H$\\alpha$ observations have revealed the presence of a vastly\nextended nebula around the system, which could be the `super-remnant' of many\nthousands of past eruptions. With a prediction of the white dwarf reaching the\nChandrasekhar mass in less than a mega-year, M31N 2008-12a has become the\nleading pre-explosion type Ia supernova candidate. The 2016 eruption - to be\nthe twelfth detected eruption - is expected imminently, and a vast array of\nfollow-up observations are already planned.\n", "  We study scaling properties of the model of fully developed turbulence for a\ncompressible fluid, based on the stochastic Navier-Stokes equation, by means of\nthe field theoretic renormalization group (RG). The scaling properties in this\napproach are related to fixed points of the RG equation. Here we study a\npossible existence of other scaling regimes and an opportunity of a crossover\nbetween them. This may take place in some other space dimensions, particularly\nat $d = 4$. A new regime may there arise and then by continuity moves into $d =\n3$. Our calculations have shown that there really exists an additional fixed\npoint, that may govern scaling behaviour.\n", "  Helium atoms have been prepared in the circular\n$|n=55,\\ell=54,m_{\\ell}=+54\\rangle$ Rydberg state using the crossed electric\nand magnetic fields method. The atoms, initially travelling in pulsed\nsupersonic beams, were photoexcited from the metastable $1s2s\\,^3S_1$ level to\nthe outermost, $m_{\\ell}=0$ Rydberg-Stark state with $n=55$ in the presence of\na strong electric field and weak perpendicular magnetic field. Following\nexcitation, the electric field was adiabatically switched off causing the atoms\nto evolve into the circular state with $m_{\\ell}=+54$ defined with respect to\nthe magnetic field quantization axis. The circular states were detected by\nramped electric field ionization along the magnetic field axis. The dependence\nof the circular state production efficiency on the strength of the excitation\nelectric field, and the electric-field switch-off time was studied, and\nmicrowave spectroscopy of the circular-to-circular\n$|55,54,+54\\rangle\\rightarrow|56,55,+55\\rangle$ transition at $\\sim38.5$~GHz\nwas performed.\n", "  The electric conductivity, HV discharge triggering and guiding capabilities\nof filaments at 3.9 micrometer in air are investigated in the perspective of\nlightning control applications, and compared to near-IR filaments in identical\nconditions\n", "  The increasing volumes of astronomical data require practical methods for\ndata exploration, access and visualisation. The Hierarchical Progressive Survey\n(HiPS) is a HEALPix based scheme that enables a multi-resolution approach to\nastronomy data from the individual pixels up to the whole sky. We highlight the\ndecisions and approaches that have been taken to make this scheme a practical\nsolution for managing large volumes of heterogeneous data. Early implementors\nof this system have formed a network of HiPS nodes, with some 250 diverse data\nsets currently available, with multiple mirror implementations for important\ndata sets. This hierarchical approach can be adapted to expose Big Data in\ndifferent ways. We describe how the ease of implementation, and local\ncustomisation of the Aladin Lite embeddable HiPS visualiser have been keys for\npromoting collaboration on HiPS.\n", "  URu2Si2 is one of the most enigmatic strongly-correlated-electron systems and\noffers a fertile testing ground for new concepts in condensed matter science.\nIn spite of >30 years of intense research, no consensus on the order parameter\nof its low-temperature hidden-order phase exists. A strong magnetic field\ntransforms the hidden order into magnetically-ordered phases, whose order\nparameter has also been defying experimental observation. Here, thanks to an\ninstrumentation breakthrough in high-field neutron scattering, we identify the\nfield-induced phases of URu2Si2 as a spin-density-wave state with wavevector k1\n= (0.6 0 0). The transition to the spin-density wave represents a unique\ntouchstone for understanding the hidden-order phase. An intimate relationship\nbetween this magnetic structure, the magnetic fluctuations, and the Fermi\nsurface is emphasized, calling for dedicated band structure calculations.\n", "  We discuss a model comprised of a chain of three Kerr-like nonlinear\noscillators pumped by two modes of external coherent field. We show that the\nsystem can be treated as nonlinear quantum scissors and behave as a three-qubit\nmodel. For such situation, different types of tripartite entangled states can\nbe generated, even when damping effects are present in the system. Some amount\nof such entanglement can survive even in a long-time limit. The flow of\nbipartite entanglement between subsystems of the model and relations among\nfirst-order correlations, second-order correlations, and the entanglement are\ndiscussed.\n", "  Molecular dynamics simulations performed on <110> Cu nanopillars revealed\nsignificant difference in deformation behavior of nanopillars with and without\ntwin boundary. The plastic deformation in single crystal Cu nanopillar without\ntwin boundary was dominated by twinning, whereas the introduction of twin\nboundary changed the deformation mode from twinning to slip consisting of\nleading partial followed by trailing partial dislocations. This difference in\ndeformation behavior has been attributed to the formation of stair-rod\ndislocation and its dissociation in the twinned nanopillars.\n", "  In the Cu Cr system, the formation of supersaturated solid solutions can be\nobtained by severe plastic deformation. Energy dispersive synchrotron\ndiffraction measurements on as deformed Cu Cr samples as a function of the\napplied strain during deformation confirm the formation of supersaturated solid\nsolutions in this usually immiscible system. Due to evaluation of the\ndiffraction data by a newly developed energy dispersive Rietveld program,\nlattice parameter and microstructural parameters such as domain size and\nmicrostrain are determined for as deformed as well as annealed samples. The\nobtained information is used to deepen the understanding of the microstructural\nevolution and the formation of supersaturated solid solutions during severe\nplastic deformation. Complimentary transmission electron microscopy\ninvestigations are furthermore performed to characterize the evolving\nmicrostructure in detail. After annealing at elevated temperatures, the formed\nsolid solutions decompose. Compared to the as deformed state, an enhanced\nhardness combined with a high thermal stability is observed. Possible\nmechanisms for the enhanced hardness are discussed.\n", "  Few unified equations of state for neutron star matter where core and crust\nare described using the same nuclear model are available. However the use of\nnon-unified equations of state with a simplified matching between the crust and\nthe core has been shown to introduce uncertainties in the radius determination\nwhich can be larger than the expected precision of the next generation of X-ray\nsatellites.\n  We aim at eliminating the dependence of the radius and mass of neutron staron\nthe detailed model for the crust and on the crust-core matching procedure. We\nsolve the approximate equations of the hydrostatic equilibrium for the crust of\nneutron stars obtaining a precise formula for the radius which depends only on\nthe core mass and radius, and on the baryon chemical potential at the\ncore-crust interface and on the crust surface. For a fully accreted crust one\nneeds additionally the value of the total deep crustal heating per one accreted\nnucleon.\n  For typical neutron star masses the approximate approach allows to determine\nthe neutron star radius with an error ~0.1% (~ 10 m, equivalent to a 1%\ninaccuracy in the crust thickness).\n  The formalism applies to neutron stars with a catalyzed or a fully accreted\ncrust. The difference in the neutron star radius between the two models is\nproportional to the total energy release due to deep crustal heating.\n  For a given model of dense matter describing the neutron star core, the\nradius of a neutron star can be accurately determined independently of the\ncrust model with a precision much better than the ~5% one expected from the\nnext generation of X-ray satellites. This allows to circumvent the problem of\nthe radius uncertainty which may arise when non-unified equations of state for\nthe crust and the core are used.\n", "  The thermal decomposition behavior, the microstructural evolution and its\ninfluence on the mechanical properties of a supersaturated Cu Co solid solution\nwith ~100 nm average grain size prepared by severe plastic deformation is\ninvestigated under non-isothermal and isothermal annealing conditions. Pure\nfine grained Cu and Co exhibit substantial grain growth upon annealing, whereas\nthe Cu Co alloy is thermally stable at the same annealing temperatures. The\nannealed microstructures are studied by independent characterization methods,\nincluding scanning electron microscopy, electron energy loss spectroscopy and\natom probe tomography. The phase separation process in the Cu Co alloy proceeds\nby the same mechanism, but on different length scales: a fine scaled spinodal\ntype decomposition is observed in the grain interior, simultaneously Co and Cu\nregions with a larger scale are formed near the grain boundary regions.\nSubsequent grain growth at higher annealing temperatures results in a\nmicrostructure consisting of the pure equilibrium phases. Such mechanisms can\nbe used to tailor nano structures to optimize certain properties.\n", "  The MocServer is an astronomical service dedicated to the manipulation of\ndata set coverages. This server sets together about 15 000 spatial footprints\nassociated to catalogs, data bases and pixel surveys. Thanks to the Multi-Order\nCoverage map coding method (MOC1.0 IVOA standard), the MocServer is able to\nprovide in a few milliseconds the list of data set identifiers intersecting any\npolygon on the sky. The MOC server has been deployed in June 2015 by the Centre\nde Donnees astronomiques de Strasbourg. It is operational and already in use by\nAladin Desktop and Aladin Lite prototype versions.\n", "  Heavy-Dense QCD (HDQCD) is a popular theory to investigate the sign problem\nin quantum field theory. Besides its physical applications, HDQCD is relatively\neasy to implement numerically: the fermionic degrees of freedom are integrated\nout, and the fermion determinant factorises into local ones. The theory has a\nsign problem, the severeness of which depends on the value of the chemical\npotential, which makes this theory ideal to test the reach of new algorithms.\nWe use the LLR approach to obtain the probability distribution of the phase of\nthe fermion determinant. Our goal is the calculation of the phase factor\nexpectation value, which appears as Fourier transform of this probability\ndistribution. We here propose a new and systematic moment expansion for this\nphase factor. We compare the answer from the moment expansion order by order\nwith the exact answer. We find that this expansion converge quickly and works\nvery well in the strong sign problem region.\n", "  Cooperation in the form of vote trading, also known as logrolling, is central\nfor law-making processes, shaping the development of democratic societies.\nEmpirical evidence of logrolling is scarce and limited to highly specific\nsituations because existing methods are not easily applicable to broader\ncontexts. We have developed a general and scalable methodology for revealing a\nnetwork of vote traders, allowing us to measure logrolling on a large scale.\nAnalysis on more than 9 million votes spanning 40 years in the U.S. Congress\nreveals a higher logrolling prevalence in the Senate and an overall decreasing\ntrend over recent congresses, coincidental with high levels of political\npolarization. Our method is applicable in multiple contexts, shedding light on\nmany aspects of logrolling and opening new doors in the study of hidden\ncooperation.\n", "  We describe a lattice approach for directly computing momentum derivatives of\nnucleon matrix elements using the Rome method, which we apply to obtain the\nisovector magnetic moment and Dirac radius. We present preliminary results\ncalculated at the physical pion mass using a 2HEX-smeared Wilson-clover action.\nFor removing the effects of excited-state contamination, the calculations were\ndone at three source-sink separations and the summation method was used.\n", "  By combining ab initio quantum mechanics calculation and Drude model,\nelectron temperature and lattice temperature dependent electron thermal\nconductivity is calculated and implemented into a multiscale model of laser\nmaterial interaction, which couples the classical molecular dynamics and\ntwo-temperature model. The results indicated that the electron thermal\nconductivity obtained from ab initio calculation leads to faster thermal\ndiffusion than that using the electron thermal conductivity from empirical\ndetermination, which further induces deeper melting region, larger number of\ndensity waves travelling inside the copper film and more various speeds of\natomic clusters ablated from the irradiated film surface.\n", "  Optical time-reversal techniques are being actively developed to focus light\nthrough or inside opaque scattering media. When applied to biological tissue,\nthese techniques promise to revolutionize biophotonics by enabling deep-tissue\nnon-invasive optical imaging, optogenetics, optical tweezers and photodynamic\ntherapy. In all previous optical time-reversal experiments, the scattered light\nfield was well-sampled during wavefront measurement and wavefront\nreconstruction, following the Nyquist sampling criterion. Here, we overturn\nthis conventional practice by demonstrating that even when the scattered field\nis under-sampled, light can still be focused through or inside opaque media.\nEven more surprisingly, we show both theoretically and experimentally that the\nfocus achieved by under-sampling is usually about one order of magnitude\nbrighter than that achieved by conventional well-sampling conditions. Moreover,\nsub-Nyquist sampling improves the signal-to-noise ratio and the collection\nefficiency of the scattered light. We anticipate that this newly explored\nunder-sampling scheme will transform the understanding of optical time reversal\nand boost the performance of optical imaging, manipulation, and communication\nthrough opaque scattering media.\n", "  Over the western United States, the hazards posed to aviation operations by\nconvective storm-generated downbursts have been extensively documented. Other\nsignificant hazards posed by convective downbursts over the intermountain\nwestern U.S. include the rapid intensification and propagation of wildfires and\nthe sudden generation of visibility-reducing dust storms (haboobs). The\nexisting suite of GOES downburst prediction algorithms employs the GOES sounder\nto calculate potential of occurrence based on conceptual models of favorable\nenvironmental thermodynamic profiles for downburst generation. Previous\nresearch has demonstrated the effectiveness of the Dry Microburst Index (DMI)\nas a prediction tool for convectively generated high winds. A more\nrecently-developed diagnostic nowcasting product, the Microburst Windspeed\nPotential Index (MWPI) is designed to diagnose attributes of a favorable\ndownburst environment: 1) the presence of convective available potential energy\n(CAPE), and 2) the presence of a deep surface-based or elevated mixed layer\nwith a large temperature lapse rate. This paper presents an updated assessment\nof the MWPI algorithm, case studies demonstrating effective operational use of\nthe MWPI product, and recent validation results. MWPI data were collected for\ndownburst events that occurred during the 2014 convective season and were\nvalidated against surface observations of convective wind gusts as recorded by\nwind sensors in high-quality mesonetworks. Favorable validation results include\na statistically significant correlation (r > 0.6) and low mean error (< 1 kt)\nbetween MWPI values and confirmed downburst wind speeds measured in situ.\n", "  The pressure-induced transition of vanadium from BCC to rhombohedral\nstructures is unique and intriguing among transition metals. In this work, the\nstability of these phases is revisited by using density functional theory. At\nfinite temperatures, a novel transition of rhombohedral phases back to BCC\nphase induced by thermal electrons is discovered. This reentrant transition is\nfound not driven by phonons, instead it is the electronic entropy that\nstabilizes the latter phase, which is totally out of expectation. Parallel to\nthis transition, we find a peculiar and strong increase of the shear modulus\nC44 with increasing temperature. It is counter-intuitive in the sense that it\nsuggests an unusual harding mechanism of vanadium by temperature. With these\nstability analyses, the high-pressure and finite-temperature phase diagram of\nvanadium is proposed. Furthermore, the dependence of the stability of RH phases\non the Fermi energy and chemical environment is investigated. The results\ndemonstrate that the position of the Fermi level has a significant impact on\nthe phase stability, and follows the band-filling argument. Besides the Fermi\nsurface nesting, we find that the localization/delocalization of the d orbitals\nalso contributes to the instability of rhombohedral distortions in vanadium.\n", "  Creating a modified Belinfante/Rosenfeld procedure, Mathisson-Papapetrou-like\nequations are derived by which a comparison of General-Covariant Continuum\nPhysics with General Relativity Theory becomes possible.\n", "  An immersed-boundary (IB) method is proposed and applied in the gas-kinetic\nBGK scheme to simulate incompressible/compressible viscous flow with\nstationary/moving boundary. In present method the ghost-cell technique is\nadopted to fulfill the boundary condition on the immersed boundary. A novel\nidea \"local boundary determination\" is put forward to identify the ghost cells,\neach of which may have several different ghost-cell constructions corresponding\nto different boundary segments, thus eliminating the singularity of the ghost\ncell. Furthermore, the so-called \"fresh-cell\" problem when implementing the IB\nmethod in moving-boundary simulation is resolved by a simple extrapolation in\ntime. The method is firstly applied in the gas-kinetic BGK scheme to simulate\nthe Taylor-Couette flow, where the second-order spatial accuracy of the method\nis validated and the \"super-convergence\" of the BGK scheme is observed. Then\nthe test cases of supersonic flow around a stationary cylinder, incompressible\nflow around an oscillating cylinder and compressible flow around a moving\nairfoil are conducted to verify the capability of the present method in\nsimulating compressible flows and handling the moving boundary.\n", "  The MeV spectral peak of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is best explained as\nphotospheric emission from a dissipative relativistic jet. The observed\nnon-blackbody spectrum shows that sub-photospheric dissipation involves both\nthermal plasma heating and injection of nonthermal particles, which quickly\ncool through inverse Compton scattering and emission of synchrotron radiation.\nSynchrotron photons emitted around and above the photosphere are predicted to\ndominate the low-energy part of the GRB spectrum, starting from roughly a\ndecade in energy below the MeV peak. We show that this leads to a unique\npolarization signature: a rise in GRB polarization toward lower energies. We\ncompute the polarization degree of GRB radiation as a function of photon energy\nfor a generic jet model, and show the predictions for GRBs 990123, 090902B and\n110721A. The expected polarization is significant in the X-ray band, in\nparticular for bursts similar to GRB 090902B. Radiation in the MeV peak (and at\nhigher energies) is unpolarized as long as the jet is approximately uniform on\nangular scales $\\delta\\theta \\gtrsim \\Gamma^{-1}$ where $\\Gamma$ is the bulk\nLorentz factor of the jet.\n", "  During recent years there has been an increasing interest in the application\nof matrix product states, and more generally tensor networks, to lattice gauge\ntheories. This non-perturbative method is sign problem free and has already\nbeen successfully used to compute mass spectra, thermal states and phase\ndiagrams, as well as real-time dynamics for Abelian and non-Abelian gauge\nmodels. In previous work we showed the suitability of the method to explore the\nzero-temperature phase structure of the multi-flavor Schwinger model at\nnon-zero chemical potential, a regime where the conventional Monte Carlo\napproach suffers from the sign problem. Here we extend our numerical study by\nlooking at the spatially resolved chiral condensate in the massless case. We\nrecover spatial oscillations, similar to the theoretical predictions for the\nsingle-flavor case, with a chemical potential dependent frequency and an\namplitude approximately given by the homogeneous zero density condensate value.\n", "  We test the utility of the OII 83.4 nm emission feature as a measure of\nionospheric parameters. Observed with the Remote Atmospheric and Ionospheric\nDetection System (RAIDS) Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrograph on the International\nSpace Station (ISS), limb profiles of 83.4 nm emissions are compared to\npredicted dayglow emission profiles from a theoretical model incorporating\nground-based electron density profiles measured by the Millstone Hill radar and\nparameterized by a best-fit Chapman-{\\alpha} function. Observations and models\nare compared for periods of conjunction between Millstone Hill and the RAIDS\nfields-of-view. These RAIDS observations show distinct differences in topside\nmorphology between two days, 15 January and 10 March 2010, closely matching the\nforward model morphology and demonstrating that 83.4 nm emission is sensitive\nto changes in the ionospheric density profile from the 340 km altitude of the\nISS during solar minimum. We find no significant difference between 83.4 nm\nemission profiles modeled assuming a constant scale height Chapman-{\\alpha}\nbest-fit to the ISR measurements and those assuming varying scale height.\n", "  We propose, as another pedagogical approach, a quantification of the e.m.\nfield better adapted in isolated systems, a quantification of e.m. fields in\nfinite-spacetime which does not rely explicitly on the notion of photon, nor on\nthe general application of gauge. Being based on the development of e.m. field\nin TE-TM modes and states, it obeys the limit conditions of a finite-spacetime\nwhich follows from the solution of an eigenvalue equation and allows to\ninterpret more profoundly some phenomenons, notably: the equivalence of a Pauli\nprinciple in stationary TE-TM states, the notion of non-locality in a radiation\nfield, a modified form of the De Broglie analysis and the notion of\nwave-paquets in finite-spacetime.\n", "  We outline how Drinfeld twist deformation techniques can be applied to the\ndeformation quantization of principal bundles into noncommutative principal\nbundles, and more in general to the deformation of Hopf-Galois extensions.\nFirst we twist deform the structure group in a quantum group, and this leads to\na deformation of the fibers of the principal bundle. Next we twist deform a\nsubgroup of the group of authomorphisms of the principal bundle, and this leads\nto a noncommutative base space. Considering both deformations we obtain\nnoncommutative principal bundles with noncommutative fiber and base space as\nwell.\n", "  These notes provide an introduction to polarization effects in deep inelastic\nprocesses in QCD. We emphasize recent work on transverse asymmetries,\nsubdominant effects, and the role of polarization in fragmentation and in\npurely hadronic processes. After a review of kinematics and some basic tools of\nshort distance analysis, we study the twist, helicity, chirality and\ntransversity dependence of a variety of high energy processes sensitive to the\nquark and gluon substructure of hadrons.\n"]}
