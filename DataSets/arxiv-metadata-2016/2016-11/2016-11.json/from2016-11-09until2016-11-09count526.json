operation are\npresented. Among the many exciting measurements that have been made, most\ngamma-ray sources are of Galactic origin. I will concentrate here on an\noverview of Galactic observations and summarise and discuss observations of\nselected objects of the different source types.\n", "  The 1972 and 1973 launched Pioneer 10 and 11 were the first missions to\nexplore the outer solar system. They achieved stunning breakthroughs in\ndeep-space exploration. But around 1980 an unmodeled force of \\sim 8 \\times\n10^{-8} cm/s^2, directed approximately towards the Sun, appeared in the\ntracking data. It later was unambiguously verified as not being an artifact.\nThe origin remains unknown (although radiant heat remains a likely cause).\nIncreasing effort has gone into understanding this anomaly. We review the\nsituation and describe programs to resolve the issue.\n", "  In a diffeomorphism invariant theory, symmetry breaking may be a mask for\ncoordinate choice.\n", "  In this talk, results from the gravitational sector of the Standard-Model\nExtension (SME) are discussed. The weak-field phenomenology of the resulting\nmodified gravitational field equations is explored. The application of the\nresults to a variety of modern gravity experiments, including lunar laser\nranging, Gravity Probe B, binary pulsars, and Earth-laboratory tests, shows\npromising sensitivity to gravitational coefficients for Lorentz violation in\nthe SME.\n", "  The Lorentz- and CPT-violating Chern-Simons extension of electrodynamics is\nconsidered. In the context of N=4 supergravity in four spacetime dimensions, it\nis argued that cosmological solutions can generate this extension. Within\nChern-Simons electrodynamics, theoretical and phenomenological topics are\nreviewed that concern the number of the remaining spacetime symmetries and the\nvacuum Cherenkov effect, respectively.\n", "  We present the first constraints on pure-gravity sector Standard-Model\nExtension (SME) parameters using Lunar Laser Ranging (LLR). LLR measures the\nround trip travel time of light between the Earth and the Moon. With 34+ years\nof LLR data, we have constrained six independent linear combinations of SME\nparameters at the level of $10^{-6}$ to $10^{-11}$. There is no evidence for\nLorentz violation in the LLR dataset.\n", "  In the presence of background fields that spontaneously violate Lorentz\ninvariance, a matter-antimatter asymmetry can be generated even in thermal\nequilibrium. In this paper we systematically investigate models of this type,\nshowing that either high-energy or electroweak versions of baryogenesis are\npossible, depending on the dynamics of the Lorentz-violating fields. We\nidentify two scenarios of interest: baryogenesis from a weak-scale\npseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson with intermediate-scale baryon-number violation,\nand sphaleron-induced baryogenesis driven by a constant-magnitude vector with a\nlate-time phase transition.\n", "  Einstein-aether theory is general relativity coupled to a dynamical unit\ntimelike vector field. A brief review of current theoretical understanding and\nobservational constraints on the four coupling parameters of the theory is\ngiven.\n", "  Spontaneous breaking of local Lorentz symmetry is of interest as a possible\nmechanism originating from physics at the Planck scale. If such breaking\noccurs, however, it raises the questions of what the fate of the\nNambu-Goldstone modes is, whether a Higgs mechanism can occur, and whether\nadditional massive modes (analogous to the Higgs particle) can appear. A\nsummary of some recent work looking at these questions is presented here.\n", "  We present an analysis designed to search for Lorentz and CPT violations as\npredicted by the SME framework using the charged current neutrino events in the\nMINOS near detector. In particular we develop methods to identify periodic\nvariations in the normalized number of charged current neutrino events as a\nfunction of sidereal phase. To test these methods, we simulated a set of 1,000\nexperiments without Lorentz and CPT violation signals using the standard MINOS\nMonte Carlo. We performed an FFT on each of the simulated experiments to find\nthe distribution of powers in the sidereal phase diagram without a signal. We\nthen injected a signal of increasing strength into the sidereal neutrino\noscillation probability until we found a 5$\\sigma$ deviation from the mean in\nthe FFT power spectrum. By this method, we can establish upper limits for the\nLorentz and CPT violating terms in the SME.\n", "  In this proceedings, similarities between the structure of theories with\nLorentz violation and theories with constant torsion in flat spacetime are\nexploited to place bounds on torsion components. An example is given showing\nthe analysis leading to bounds on the axial-vector and mixed-symmetry\ncomponents of torsion, based on a dual-maser experiment.\n", "  Vacuum birefringence is a signature of Lorentz-symmetry violation. Here we\nreport on a recent search for birefringence in the cosmic microwave background.\nPolarization data is used to place constraints on certain forms of Lorentz\nviolation.\n", "  The Poynting vector is an invaluable tool for analysing electromagnetic\nproblems. However, even a rigorous stress-energy tensor approach can still\nleave us with the question: is it best defined as $\\Vec{E} \\cross \\Vec{H}$ or\nas $\\Vec{D} \\cross \\Vec{B}$? Typical electromagnetic treatments provide yet\nanother perspective: they regard $\\Vec{E} \\cross \\Vec{B}$ as the appropriate\ndefinition, because $\\Vec{E}$ and $\\Vec{B}$ are taken to be the fundamental\nelectromagnetic fields. The astute reader will even notice the fourth possible\ncombination of fields: i.e. $\\Vec{D} \\cross \\Vec{H}$. Faced with this diverse\nselection, we have decided to treat each possible flux vector on its merits,\nderiving its associated energy continuity equation but applying minimal\nrestrictions to the allowed host media. We then discuss each form, and how it\nrepresents the response of the medium. Finally, we derive a propagation\nequation for each flux vector using a directional fields approach; a useful\nresult which enables further interpretation of each flux and its interaction\nwith the medium.\n", "  Quantum algorithms are sequences of abstract operations, performed on\nnon-existent computers. They are in obvious need of categorical semantics. We\npresent some steps in this direction, following earlier contributions of\nAbramsky, Coecke and Selinger. In particular, we analyze function abstraction\nin quantum computation, which turns out to characterize its classical\ninterfaces. Some quantum algorithms provide feasible solutions of important\nhard problems, such as factoring and discrete log (which are the building\nblocks of modern cryptography). It is of a great practical interest to\nprecisely characterize the computational resources needed to execute such\nquantum algorithms. There are many ideas how to build a quantum computer. Can\nwe prove some necessary conditions? Categorical semantics help with such\nquestions. We show how to implement an important family of quantum algorithms\nusing just abelian groups and relations.\n", "  Giant caloric effects were reported in elasto-, electro- and magnetocaloric\nmaterials near phase transformations. Commonly, their entropy change is\nindirectly evaluated by a Maxwell relation. We report the fundamental failure\nof this approach. We analyze exemplarily the Ni-Mn-Ga magnetic shape memory\nalloy. An applied field results in magnetically induced reorientation of\nmartensitic variants, which form during the phase transformation. This results\nin a spurious magnetocaloric effect, which only disappears when repeating the\nmeasurement a second time. This failure is universal as the vector character of\nthe applied field is not considered in the common scalar evaluation of a\nMaxwell relation.\n", "  We study the capability of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to detect\nSupermassive Dark Stars (SMDS). If the first stars are powered by dark matter\nheating in triaxial dark matter haloes, they may grow to be very large and very\nbright, visible in deep imaging with JWST and even Hubble Space Telescope\n(HST). We use HST surveys to place bounds on the numbers of SMDSs that may be\ndetected in future JWST imaging surveys. We showed that SMDS in the mass range\n$10^6-10^7 M_\\odot$ are bright enough to be detected in all the wavelength\nbands of the NIRCam on JWST . If SMDSs exist at z ~10, 12, and 14, they will be\ndetectable as J-band, H-band, or K-band dropouts, respectively. With a total\nsurvey area of 150 arcmin^2 (assuming a multi-year deep parallel survey with\nJWST), we find that typically the number of $10^6 M_\\odot$ SMDSs found as H or\nK-band dropouts is ~10^5\\fsmds, where the fraction of early DM haloes hosting\nDS is likely to be small, \\fsmds<<1. If the SDMS survive down to z=10 where HST\nbounds apply, then the observable number of SMDSs as H or K-band dropouts with\nJWST is ~1-30. While individual SMDS are bright enough to be detected by JWST,\nstandard PopIII stars are not, and would only be detected in first galaxies\nwith total stellar masses of ~$10^6-10^8 M_\\odot$. Differentiating first\ngalaxies at z>10 from SMDSs would be possible with spectroscopy: the SMDS\n(which are too cool produce significant nebular emission) will have only\nabsorption lines while the galaxies are likely to produce emission lines as\nwell. Of particular interest would be the 1640 HeII emission line as well as\nH{\\alpha} lines which would be signatures of early galaxies rather than SMDSs.\nThe detection of SMDSs would not only provide alternative evidence for WIMPs\nbut would also provide possible seeds for the formation of supermassive black\nholes that power QSOs at z~6.\n", "  Recently developed model allows for simulations of electric field influence\non the surface states. The results of slab simulations show considerable change\nof the energy of quantum states in the electric field, i.e. Stark Effect\nassociated with the surface (SSSE - Surface States Stark Effect). Detailed\nstudies of the GaN slabs demonstrate spatial variation of the conduction and\nvalence band energy revealing real nature of SSSE phenomenon. It is shown that\nlong range variation of the electric potential is in accordance with the change\nof the energy of the conduction and valence bands. However, at short distances\nfrom GaN(0001) surface, the valence band follows the potential change while the\nconduction states energy is increased due to quantum overlap repulsion by\nsurface states. It is also shown that at clean GaN(0001) surface Fermi level is\npinned at about 0.34 eV below the long range projection of the conduction band\nbottom and varies with the field by about 0.31 eV due to electron filling of\nthe surface states.\n", "  Ab initio density functional theory (DFT) simulations were used to\ninvestigate an influence of electric field, parallel to single and multilayer\ngraphene on its electron dispersion relations close to K point. It was shown\nthat for both single layer and AAAA stacking multilayer graphene under\ninfluence of parallel field the dispersion relations transform to nonlinear.\nThe effect, associated with the hexagonal symmetry breaking, opens new route to\nhigh speed transistors and logical devices working in Dirac regime. The\nimplementation of such device is presented.\n", "  Within a gauge formulation of 3+1 gravity relying on a nonlinear realization\nof the group of isometries of space-time, a natural expansion of the metric\ntensor arises and a simple choice of the gravity dynamical variables is\npossible. We show that the expansion parameter can be identified with the\ngravitational constant and that the first order depends only on a diagonal\nmatrix in the ensuing perturbation approach. The explicit first order solution\nis calculated in the static isotropic case, and its general structure is worked\nout in the harmonic gauge.\n", "  Semiconductor surfaces were divided into charge categories, i.e. surface\nacceptor, donor and neutral ones that are suitable for simulations of their\nproperties within a slab model. The potential profiles, close to the charged\nsurface states, accounting for explicit dependence of the point defects energy,\nwere obtained. A termination charge slab model was formulated and analyzed\nproving that two control parameters of slab simulations exist: the slope and\ncurvature of electric potential profiles which can be translated into a surface\nand volumetric charge density. The procedures of slab model parameter control\nare described and presented using examples of the DFT simulations of GaN and\nSiC surfaces showing the potential profiles, linear or curved, depending on the\nband charge within the slab. It was also demonstrated that the field at the\nsurface may affect some surface properties in a considerable degree proving\nthat verification of this dependence is obligatory for a precise simulation of\nthe properties of semiconductor surfaces.\n", "  We present a series of smoothed particle hydrodynamical models of\nG0.253+0.016 (also known as 'The Brick'), a very dense molecular cloud that\nlies close to the Galactic Centre. We explore how its gas and dust temperatures\nreact as we vary the strength of both the interstellar radiation field (ISRF)\nand the cosmic ray ionisation rate (CRIR). As the physical extent of\nG0.253+0.016 along our line-of-sight is unknown, we consider two possibilities:\none in which the longest axis is that measured in the plane of the sky (9.4 pc\nin length), and one in which it is along the line of sight, in which case we\ntake it to be 17 pc. To recover the observed gas and dust temperatures, we find\nfind that the ISRF must be around 1000 times the solar neighbourhood value, and\nthe CRIR must be roughly 1E-14 /s, regardless of the geometries studied. For\nsuch high values of the CRIR, we find that cooling in the cloud's interior is\ndominated by neutral oxygen, in contrast to standard molecular clouds, which at\nthe same densities are mainly cooled via CO. Our results suggest that the\nconditions near G0.253+0.016 are more extreme than those generally accepted for\nthe inner 500 pc of the galaxy.\n", "  N=4 Poincare supergravity has a global SU(1,1) duality symmetry that acts\nmanifestly only on shell as it involves duality rotations of vector fields. A\nU(1) subgroup of this symmetry is known to be anomalous at the quantum level in\nthe presence of a non-trivial gravitational background. We first derive this\nanomaly from a novel perspective, by relating it to a similar anomaly in\nconformal supergravity where SU(1,1) acts off shell, using the fact that N=4\nPoincare supergravity has a superconformal formulation. We explicitly construct\nthe corresponding local and nonlocal anomalous terms in the one-loop effective\naction. We then study how this anomaly is reflected in the supergravity\nS-matrix. Calculating one-loop N=4 supergravity scattering amplitudes (with and\nwithout additional matter multiplets) using color/kinematics duality and the\ndouble-copy construction we find that a particular U(1) symmetry which was\npresent in the tree-level amplitudes is broken at the quantum level. This\nbreaking manifests itself in the appearance of new one-loop N=4 supergravity\namplitudes that have non-vanishing soft-scalar limits (these amplitudes are\nabsent in N>4 supergravities). We discuss the relation between these\nsymmetry-violating amplitudes and the corresponding U(1) anomalous term in the\none-loop supergravity effective action.\n", "  Electroweak gauge boson pair production is one of the most important Standard\nModel processes at the LHC, not only because it is a benchmark process but also\nby its ability to probe the electroweak interaction directly. We present full\nnext-to-leading order predictions for the production cross sections and\ndistributions of on-shell massive gauge boson pair production in the Standard\nModel. This includes the QCD and electroweak (EW) corrections. We study the\nhierarchy between the different channels when looking at the size of the QCD\ngluon-induced processes and the EW photon-induced processes and provide the\nfirst comprehensive explanation of this hierarchy thanks to analytical\nleading-logarithmic results. We also provide a detailed study of the\ntheoretical uncertainties affecting the total cross section predictions that\nstem from scale variation, parton distribution function and $\\alpha_s$ errors.\nWe then compare with the present LHC data.\n", "  We propose a 3-3-1 model where the $SU(3)_{C}\\otimes SU(3)_{L}\\otimes\nU(1)_{X}$ symmetry is extended by $S_{3}\\otimes Z_{3}\\otimes Z_{3}^{\\prime\n}\\otimes Z_{8}\\otimes Z_{16}$ and the scalar spectrum is enlarged by extra $%\nSU(3)_{L}$ singlet scalar fields. The model successfully describes the observed\nSM fermion mass and mixing pattern. In this framework, the light active\nneutrino masses arise via an inverse seesaw mechanism and the observed charged\nfermion mass and quark mixing hierarchy is a consequence of the $Z_{3}\\otimes\nZ_{3}^{\\prime }\\otimes Z_{8}\\otimes Z_{16}$ symmetry breaking at very high\nenergy. The obtained physical observables for both quark and lepton sectors are\ncompatible with their experimental values. The model predicts the effective\nMajorana neutrino mass parameter of neutrinoless double beta decay to be\n$m_{\\beta \\beta }=$ 4 and 48 meV for the normal and the inverted neutrino\nspectra, respectively. Furthermore, we found a leptonic Dirac CP violating\nphase close to $\\frac{\\pi }{2}$ and a Jarlskog invariant close to about\n$3\\times 10^{-2}$ for both normal and inverted neutrino mass hierarchy.\n", "  We apply the axion-photon conversion mechanism to the 130 GeV $\\gamma$-ray\nline observed by the Fermi satellite. Near the Galactic center, some\nastrophysical sources and/or particle dark matter can produce energetic axions\n(or axionlike particles), and the axions convert to $\\gamma$ rays in Galactic\nmagnetic fields along their flight to the Earth. Since continuum $\\gamma$-ray\nand antiproton productions are sufficiently suppressed in axion production, the\nscenario fits the 130 GeV $\\gamma$-ray line without conflicting with cosmic ray\nmeasurements. We derive the axion production cross section and the decay rate\nof dark matter to fit the $\\gamma$-ray excess as functions of axion parameters.\nIn the scenario, the $\\gamma$-ray spatial distributions depend on both the dark\nmatter profile and the magnetic field configuration, which will be tested by\nfuture $\\gamma$-ray observations, e.g., H.E.S.S. II, CTA, and GAMMA-400. As an\nillustrative example, we study realistic supersymmetric axion models, and show\nthe favored parameters that nicely fit the $\\gamma$-ray excess.\n", "  Vapor growth of semiconductors is analyzed using recently obtained dependence\nof the adsorption energy on the electron charge transfer between the surface\nadsorbed species and the bulk [Krukowski et al. J. Appl. Phys. 114 (2013)\n063507, Kempisty et al. ArXiv 1307.5778 (2013)]. Ab initio calculations were\nperformed to study the physical properties of GaN(0001) surface in ammonia-rich\nconditions, i.e. covered by mixture of NH3 molecules and NH2 radicals. The\nFermi level is pinned at valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum\n(CBM) for full coverage by NH3 molecules and NH2 radicals, respectively. For\nthe crossover content of ammonia of about 25% monolayer (ML), the Fermi level\nis unpinned. It was shown that hydrogen adsorption energy depends on the doping\nin the bulk for the unpinned Fermi level, i.e. for this coverage. Surface\nstructure thermodynamic and mechanical stability criteria are defined and\ncompared. Mechanical stability of the coverage of such surfaces was checked by\ndetermination of the desorption energy of hydrogen molecules. Thermodynamic\nstability analysis indicates that initally equilibrium hydrogen vapor partial\npressure steeply increases with NH3 content to attain the crossover NH3/NH2\ncoverage, i.e. the unpinned Fermi level condition. For such condition the\nentire range of experimentally accessible pressures belongs showing that vapor\ngrowth of semiconductor crystals occurs predominantly for unpinned Fermi level\nat the surface, i.e. for flat bands. Accordingly, adsorption energy of most\nspecies depends on the doping in the bulk that is basis of the possible\nmolecular scenario explaining dependence of the growth and the doping of\nsemiconductor crystals on the doping in the bulk\n", "  We address the effect of disorder geometry on the critical force in\ndisordered elastic systems. We focus on the model system of a long-range\nelastic line driven in a random landscape. In the collective pinning regime, we\ncompute the critical force perturbatively. Not only our expression for the\ncritical force confirms previous results on its scaling with respect to the\nmicroscopic disorder parameters, it also provides its precise dependence on the\ndisorder geometry (represented by the disorder two-point correlation function).\nOur results are successfully compared to the results of numerical simulations\nfor random field and random bond disorders.\n", "  In a turbulent proto-planetary disk, dust grains undergo large density\nfluctuations and under the right circumstances, these grain overdensities can\novercome shear, turbulent, and gas pressure support to collapse under\nself-gravity (forming a \"pebble pile\" planetesimal). Using a simple analytic\nmodel for the fluctuations predicted in simulations, we estimate the\nrate-of-formation and mass function of self-gravitating, rapidly-collapsing\nplanetesimal-mass bodies formed by this mechanism. The statistics of this\nprocess depend sensitively on the size/stopping time of the grains, disk\nsurface density, and turbulent Mach numbers. However, when it occurs, we\npredict that the resulting planetesimal mass function is broad and\nquasi-universal, with a slope dN/dM~1/M^(1-2), spanning a size/mass range\n~10-1e4 km (~1e-9-5.0 M_Earth). Collapse to planetesimal through super-Earth\nmasses is possible. The key condition is that grain density fluctuations reach\nlarge amplitudes on large scales, where gravitational instability proceeds most\neasily (collapse of small grains is strongly suppressed by turbulent\nvorticity). We show this leads to a new criterion for 'pebble-pile' formation\nin terms of the dimensionless particle stopping time (tau_stop > f(Q,Z,alpha)).\nIn a MMSN, this requires grains larger than a=(50,1,0.1)cm at r=(1,30,100)au.\nAt small radii, it would depend on the existence of large boulders. However,\nbecause density fluctuations depend super-exponentially on tau_stop (inversely\nproportional to disk surface density), lower-density disks are more unstable.\nIn fact, we predict that cm-sized grains at ~1au will form pebble piles in a\ndisk with ~10% the MMSN density, so planet formation at ~au may generically\noccur late, as disks are evaporating. We also predict that conditions become\nprogressively more favorable for pebble-pile formation around lower-mass,\ncooler stars.\n", "  We report the growth of large high quality crystals of the frustrated magnet,\nPr2Zr2O7 by the floating zone technique. Several crystals have been produced\nstarting with varying levels of excess of Pr6O11 to compensate for the loss of\nPr2O3 during the growth process. X-ray diffraction analysis of the crystals\nshows that the Pr composition in our crystals, as determined by the Pr site\noccupancy in the pyrochlore structure, is always slightly less than 1. Fits to\nthe magnetic sus-ceptibility data below 10 K using a Curie-Weiss law reveal an\nantiferromagnetic coupling between the Pr moments, with an estimated Weiss\ntemperature of {\\Theta}W = -2.5 K and an effective moment for the Pr3+ of\n{\\mu}eff = 2.5 {\\mu}B. Magnetization versus field measurements show a spin-ice\nlike anisotropy.\n", "  By measuring energy spectra of the electron emission from a sharp tungsten\ntip induced by few-cycle laser pulses, the laser-field dependence of the\nemission mechanism was investigated. In strong laser fields, we confirm the\nappearance of laser-driven tunneling emission and find that it can be\ndisentangled from the concomitant photo-excited electron emission, both\ntemporally and spectrally, by the opening of a peculiar emission channel. This\nchannel involves prompt laser-driven tunneling emission and subsequent\nlaser-driven electron re-scattering off the surface, delayed by the electrons\ntraveling far inside the metal before scattering. The quantitative\nunderstanding of these processes gives insights on attosecond tunneling\nemission from solids and should prove useful in designing new types of pulsed\nelectron sources.\n", "  Adsorption of ammonia at NH3/NH2/H covered GaN(0001) surface was analyzed\nusing results of ab initio calculations. The whole configuration space of\npartially NH3/NH2/H covered GaN(0001) surface was divided into zones\ndifferently pinned Fermi level: at Ga broken bond state for dominantly bare\nsurface (region I), at VBM for NH2 and H covered (region II), and at CBM for\nNH3 covered surface (region III). The extensive ab intio calculations show\nvalidity of electron counting rule (ECR) for all mixed coverage, for bordering\nthese three regions. The adsorption was analyzed using newly identified\ndependence of the adsorption energy on the charge transfer at the surface. For\nregion I and II ammonia adsorb dissociatively, disintegrating into H adatom and\nHN2 radical for large fraction of vacant sites while for high coverage the\nammonia adsorption is molecular. The dissociative adsorption energy strongly\ndepends on the Fermi level at the surface (pinned) and in the bulk (unpinned)\nwhile the molecular adsorption energy is determined by bonding to surface only,\nin accordance to the recently published theory. The molecular adsorption is\ndetermined by the energy of covalent bonding to the surface. Ammonia adsorption\nin region III (Fermi level pinned at CBM) leads to unstable configuration both\nmolecular and dissociative which is explained by the fact that Ga-broken bond\nsites are doubly occupied by electrons. The adsorbing ammonia brings 8\nelectrons to the surface, necessitating transfer of the electrons from\nGa-broken bond state to Fermi level, energetically costly process. Adsorption\nof ammonia at H-covered site leads to creation of NH2 radical at the surface\nand escape of H2 molecule. The process energy is close to 0.12 eV, thus not\nlarge, but the inverse process is not possible due to escape of the hydrogen\nmolecule.\n", "  The second-layer phase diagrams of $^4$He and $^3$He adsorbed on graphite are\ninvestigated. Intrinsically rounded specific-heat anomalies are observed at 1.4\nand 0.9 K, respectively, over extended density regions in between the liquid\nand incommensurate solid phases. They are identified to anomalies associated\nwith the Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young type two-dimensional\nmelting. The prospected low temperature phase (C2 phase) is a commensurate\nphase or a $\\textit{quantum hexatic}$ phase with quasi-bond-orientational\norder, both containing $\\textit{zero}$-$\\textit{point}$ defectons. In either\ncase, this would be the first atomic realization of the $\\textit{quantum liquid\ncrystal}$, a new state of matter. From the large enhancement of the melting\ntemperature over $^3$He, we propose to assign the observed anomaly of $^4$He-C2\nphase at 1.4 K to the hypothetical supersolid or superhexatic transition.\n", "  We measure the merger fraction of massive galaxies using the\nUltraVISTA/COSMOS $Ks$-band selected catalog, complemented with the deeper,\nhigher resolution 3DHST+CANDELS catalog selected in the HST/WFC3 $H$-band,\npresenting the largest mass-complete photometric merger sample up to $z\\sim3$.\nWe find that selecting mergers using the $H_{160}$-band flux ratio leads to an\nincreasing merger fraction with redshift, while selecting mergers using the\nstellar mass ratio causes a diminishing redshift dependence. Defining major and\nminor mergers as having stellar mass ratios of 1:1 - 4:1 and 4:1 - 10:1\nrespectively, the results imply $\\sim$1 major and $\\lesssim$1 minor merger for\nan average massive (log$(M_{\\star}/M_{\\odot}) \\geqslant 10.8$) galaxy during\n$z=0.1-2.5$. There may be an additional $\\sim 0.5(0.3)$ major (minor) merger if\nwe use the $H$-band flux ratio selection. The observed amount of major merging\nalone is sufficient to explain the observed number density evolution for the\nvery massive (log$(M_{\\star}/M_{\\odot}) \\geqslant 11.1$) galaxies. We argue\nthat these very massive galaxies can put on a maximum of $6\\%$ of stellar mass\nin addition to major and minor merging, so that their number density evolution\nremains consistent with observations. The observed number of major and minor\nmergers can increase the size of a massive quiescent galaxy by a factor of two\nat most. This amount of merging is enough to bring the compact quiescent\ngalaxies formed at $z>2$ to lie at $1\\sigma$ below the mean of the stellar\nmass-size relation as measured in some works (e.g. Newman et al. 2012), but\nadditional mechanisms are needed to fully explain the evolution, and to be\nconsistent with works suggesting stronger evolution (e.g. van der Wel et al.\n2014).\n", "  We study the blowup behavior for the focusing energy-supercritical semilinear\nwave equation in 3 space dimensions without symmetry assumptions on the data.\nWe prove the stability of the ODE blowup profile.\n", "  We formulate a smoothed-particle hydrodynamics numerical method,\ntraditionally used for the Euler equations for fluid dynamics in the context of\nastrophysical simulations, to solve the non-linear Schrodinger equation in the\nMadelung formulation. The probability density of the wavefunction is\ndiscretized into moving particles, whose properties are smoothed by a kernel\nfunction. The traditional fluid pressure is replaced by a quantum pressure\ntensor, for which a novel, robust discretization is found. We demonstrate our\nnumerical method on a variety of numerical test problems involving the simple\nharmonic oscillator, Bose-Einstein condensates, collapsing singularities, and\ndark matter halos governed by the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson equation. Our method\nis conservative, applicable to unbounded domains, and is automatically adaptive\nin its resolution, making it well suited to study problems with collapsing\nsolutions.\n", "  Perturbative schemes utilizing a spectral moment expansion are well known and\nextensively used for investigating the physics of model Hamiltonians and real\nmaterial systems. The advantages they offer, in terms of being computationally\ninexpensive, with real frequency output at zero and finite temperatures,\ncompensate for their deficiencies and offer a quick, qualitative analysis of\nthe system behavior. In this work, we have developed a method, that can be\nclassified as a multi-orbital iterative perturbation theory (MO-IPT) to study\nN-fold degenerate and non degenerate Anderson impurity models. As applications\nof the solver, we have combined the method with dynamical mean field theory to\nexplore lattice models like the single orbital Hubbard model, covalent band\ninsulator and the multi-orbital Hubbard model for density-density type\ninteractions in different parameter regimes. The Hund's coupling effects in\ncase of multiple orbitals is also studied. The limitations and quality of\nresults are gauged through extensive comparison with data from the numerically\nexact continuous time quantum Monte Carlo method (hybridization expansion\nCTQMC). In general we observe that the agreement with CTQMC results gets better\nas we move away from particle-hole symmetry. We have integrated MO-IPT with\ndensity functional theory based electronic structure methods to study real\nmaterial systems. As a test case, we have studied the classic, strongly\ncorrelated electronic material, SrVO$_3$. A comparison of density of states and\nphoto emission spectrum (PES) with results obtained from different impurity\nsolvers and experiments yields good agreement.\n", "  We study the interaction of feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) and a\nmulti-phase interstellar medium (ISM), in simulations including explicit\nstellar feedback, multi-phase cooling, accretion-disk winds, and Compton\nheating. We examine radii ~0.1-100 pc around a black hole (BH), where the\naccretion rate onto the BH is determined and where AGN-powered winds and\nradiation couple to the ISM. We conclude: (1) The BH accretion rate is\ndetermined by exchange of angular momentum between gas and stars in\ngravitational instabilities. This produces accretion rates ~0.03-1 Msun/yr,\nsufficient to power luminous AGN. (2) The gas disk in the galactic nucleus\nundergoes an initial burst of star formation followed by several Myrs where\nstellar feedback suppresses the star formation rate (SFR). (3) AGN winds\ninjected at small radii with momentum fluxes ~L/c couple efficiently to the ISM\nand have dramatic effects on ISM properties within ~100 pc. AGN winds suppress\nthe nuclear SFR by factors ~10-30 and BH accretion rate by factors ~3-30. They\nincrease the outflow rate from the nucleus by factors ~10, consistent with\nobservational evidence for galaxy-scale AGN-driven outflows. (4) With AGN\nfeedback, the predicted column density distribution to the BH is consistent\nwith observations. Absent AGN feedback, the BH is isotropically obscured and\nthere are not enough optically-thin sightlines to explain Type-I AGN. A\n'torus-like' geometry arises self-consistently as AGN feedback evacuates gas in\npolar regions.\n", "  Vertical heterostructures of van der Waals materials enable new pathways to\ntune charge and energy transport characteristics in nanoscale systems. We\npropose that graphene Schottky junctions can host a special kind of\nphotoresponse which is characterized by strongly coupled heat and charge flows\nthat run vertically out of the graphene plane. This regime can be accessed when\nvertical energy transport mediated by thermionic emission of hot carriers\noverwhelms electron-lattice cooling as well as lateral diffusive energy\ntransport. As such, the power pumped into the system is efficiently extracted\nacross the entire graphene active area via thermionic emission of hot carriers\ninto a semiconductor material. Experimental signatures of this regime include a\nlarge and tunable internal responsivity ${\\cal R}$ with a non-monotonic\ntemperature dependence. In particular, ${\\cal R}$ peaks at electronic\ntemperatures on the order of the Schottky potential $\\phi$ and has a large\nupper limit ${\\cal R} \\le e/\\phi$ ($e/\\phi=10\\,{\\rm A/W}$ when $\\phi =\n100\\,{\\rm meV}$). Our proposal opens up new approaches for engineering the\nphotoresponse in optically-active graphene heterostructures.\n", "  We explore the nature of glass-formation in variable spatial dimensionality\n($d$) based on the generalized entropy theory, a synthesis of the Adam-Gibbs\nmodel with direct computation of the configurational entropy of polymer fluids\nusing an established statistical mechanical model. We find that structural\nrelaxation in the fluid state asymptotically becomes Arrhenius in the\n$d\\rightarrow\\infty$ limit and that the fluid transforms upon sufficient\ncooling above a critical dimension near $d=8$ into a dense amorphous state with\na finite positive residual configurational entropy. Direct computations of the\nisothermal compressibility and thermal expansion coefficient, taken to be\nphysical measures of packing frustration, demonstrate that these fluid\nproperties strongly correlate with the fragility of glass-formation.\n", "  In stark contrast with the three-dimensional case, higher-dimensional\nChern-Simons theories can have non-topological, propagating degrees of freedom.\nFinding those vacua that allow for the propagation of linear perturbations,\nhowever, proves to be surprisingly challenging. The simplest solutions are\nsomehow \"hyper-stable,\" preventing the construction of realistic,\nfour-dimensional physical models.\n  Here, we show that a Randall-Sundrum brane universe can be regarded as a\nvacuum solution of Chern-Simons gravity in five-dimensional spacetime, with non\nvanishing torsion along the dimension perpendicular to the brane. Linearized\nperturbations around this solution not only exist, but behave as standard\ngravitational waves on a four-dimensional Minkowski background. In the\nnon-perturbative regime, the solution leads to a four-dimensional \"cosmological\nfunction\" $\\Lambda \\left( x \\right)$ which depends on the Euler density of the\nbrane.\n  Interestingly, the fact that the solution admits nontrivial linear\nperturbations seems to be related to an often neglected property of the\nRandall-Sundrum spacetime: that it is a group manifold, or, more precisely, two\nidentical group manifolds glued together along the brane. The gravitational\ntheory is then built around this fact, adding the Lorentz generators and one\nscalar generator needed to close the algebra. In this way, a conjecture\nemerges: a spacetime that is also a group manifold can be regarded as the\nground state of a Chern-Simons theory for an appropriate Lie algebra.\n", "  Resonant optical excitation was used to create a macroscopic non-equilibrium\nensemble of dark excitons with unprecedentedly long lifetime in a\ntwo-dimensional (2D) electron system placed in a quantizing magnetic field.\nExotic three-particle and four-particle states, plasmarons and plasmon-exciton\nmolecules, coupled with the surrounding electrons through the collective plasma\noscillations are engineered. Plasmarons and plasmon-exciton molecules are\nmanifested as new features in the recombination spectra of non-equilibrium\nsystems. Magnetoplasmarons and magnetotrions in a two-dimensional Hall\ninsulator.\n", "  The scalable application of quantum information science will stand on\nreproducible and controllable high-coherence quantum bits (qubits). Here, we\nrevisit the design and fabrication of the superconducting flux qubit, achieving\na planar device with broad frequency tunability, strong anharmonicity, high\nreproducibility, and relaxation times in excess of $40\\,\\mu$s at its\nflux-insensitive point. Qubit relaxation times $T_1$ across 22 qubits are\nconsistently matched with a single model involving resonator loss, ohmic charge\nnoise, and 1/f flux noise, a noise source previously considered primarily in\nthe context of dephasing. We furthermore demonstrate that qubit dephasing at\nthe flux-insensitive point is dominated by residual thermal photons in the\nreadout resonator. The resulting photon shot noise is mitigated using a\ndynamical decoupling protocol, resulting in $T_2\\approx 85\\,\\mu$s,\napproximately the $2T_1$ limit. In addition to realizing an improved flux\nqubit, our results uniquely identify photon shot noise as limiting $T_2$ in\ncontemporary qubits based on transverse qubit-resonator interaction.\n", "  A striking shape was recently observed for the cellular organelle endoplasmic\nreticulum consisting of stacked sheets connected by helical ramps. This shape\nis interesting both for its biological function, to synthesize proteins using\nan increased surface area for ribosome factories, and its geometric properties\nthat may be insensitive to details of the microscopic interactions. In the\npresent work, we find very similar shapes in our molecular dynamics simulations\nof the nuclear pasta phases of dense nuclear matter that are expected deep in\nthe crust of neutron stars. There are dramatic differences between nuclear\npasta and terrestrial cell biology. Nuclear pasta is 14 orders of magnitude\ndenser than the aqueous environs of the cell nucleus and involves strong\ninteractions between protons and neutrons, while cellular scale biology is\ndominated by the entropy of water and complex assemblies of biomolecules.\nNonetheless the very similar geometry suggests both systems may have similar\ncoarse-grained dynamics and that the shapes are indeed determined by\ngeometrical considerations, independent of microscopic details. Many of our\nsimulations self-assemble into flat sheets connected by helical ramps. These\nramps may impact the thermal and electrical conductivities, viscosity, shear\nmodulus, and breaking strain of neutron star crust. The interaction we use,\nwith Coulomb frustration, may provide a simple model system that reproduces\nmany biologically important shapes.\n", "  Within the class of heterotic line bundle models, we argue that N=1 vacua\nwhich lead to a small number of low-energy chiral families are preferred. By\nimposing an upper limit on the volume of the internal manifold, as required in\norder to obtain finite values of the four-dimensional gauge couplings, and\nvalidity of the supergravity approximation we show that, for a given manifold,\nonly a finite number of line bundle sums are consistent with supersymmetry. By\nexplicitly scanning over this finite set of line bundle models on certain\nmanifolds we show that, for a sufficiently small volume of the internal\nmanifold, the family number distribution peaks at small values, consistent with\nthree chiral families. The relation between the maximal number of families and\nthe gauge coupling is discussed, which hints towards a possible explanation of\nthe family problem.\n", "  We study dynamical mass measurements of galaxy clusters contaminated by\ninterlopers and show that a modern machine learning (ML) algorithm can predict\nmasses by better than a factor of two compared to a standard scaling relation\napproach. We create two mock catalogs from Multidark's publicly available\n$N$-body MDPL1 simulation, one with perfect galaxy cluster membership\ninformation and the other where a simple cylindrical cut around the cluster\ncenter allows interlopers to contaminate the clusters. In the standard\napproach, we use a power-law scaling relation to infer cluster mass from galaxy\nline-of-sight (LOS) velocity dispersion. Assuming perfect membership knowledge,\nthis unrealistic case produces a wide fractional mass error distribution, with\na width of $\\Delta\\epsilon\\approx0.87$. Interlopers introduce additional\nscatter, significantly widening the error distribution further\n($\\Delta\\epsilon\\approx2.13$). We employ the support distribution machine (SDM)\nclass of algorithms to learn from distributions of data to predict single\nvalues. Applied to distributions of galaxy observables such as LOS velocity and\nprojected distance from the cluster center, SDM yields better than a\nfactor-of-two improvement ($\\Delta\\epsilon\\approx0.67$) for the contaminated\ncase. Remarkably, SDM applied to contaminated clusters is better able to\nrecover masses than even the scaling relation approach applied to\nuncontaminated clusters. We show that the SDM method more accurately reproduces\nthe cluster mass function, making it a valuable tool for employing cluster\nobservations to evaluate cosmological models.\n", "  We study a model of dilute oriented loops on the square lattice, where each\nloop is compatible with a fixed, alternating orientation of the lattice edges.\nThis implies that loop strands are not allowed to go straight at vertices, and\nresults in an enhancement of the usual O(n) symmetry to U(n). The corresponding\ntransfer matrix acts on a number of representations (standard modules) that\ngrows exponentially with the system size. We derive their dimension and those\nof the centraliser by both combinatorial and algebraic techniques. A mapping\nonto a field theory permits us to identify the conformal field theory governing\nthe critical range, $n \\le 1$. We establish the phase diagram and the critical\nexponents of low-energy excitations. For generic n, there is a critical line in\nthe universality class of the dilute O(2n) model, terminating in an SU(n+1)\npoint. The case n=1 maps onto the critical line of the six-vertex model, along\nwhich exponents vary continuously.\n", "  We report on simultaneous NuSTAR and XMM-Newton observations of the magnetar\n1E 1048.1$-$5937 obtained in July 2013, along with Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer\n(RXTE) data for the same source obtained from December 2002 through March 2012.\nThe NuSTAR data provide a clear detection of this magnetar's persistent\nemission up to 20 keV. We detect a previously unreported small secondary peak\nin the average pulse profile in the 7-10 keV band, which grows to an amplitude\ncomparable to that of the main peak in the 10--20 keV band. We show using RXTE\ndata that this secondary peak is likely transient. We find that the pulsed\nfraction increases with energy from a value of $\\sim$0.55 at $\\sim$2 keV to a\nvalue of $\\sim$0.75 near 8 keV but shows evidence for decreasing at higher\nenergies. After filtering out multiple bright X-ray bursts during the\nobservation, we find that the phase-averaged spectrum from combined NuSTAR and\nXMM data is well described by an absorbed double blackbody plus power-law\nmodel, with no evidence for the spectral turn-up near $\\sim$10 keV as has been\nseen in some other magnetars. Our data allow us to rule out a spectral turn-up\nsimilar to those seen in magnetars 4U 0142+61 and 1E 2259+586 of $\\Delta\\Gamma\n>= 2$, where $\\Delta\\Gamma$ is the difference between the soft-band and\nhard-band photon indexes. The absence of a significant spectral turn-up is\nconsistent with what has been observed from a particularly active subset of\nmagnetars having high spin-inferred magnetic fields, and with previously\nreported trends suggesting the degree of spectral turn-up is correlated with\nspin-down rate and/or spin-inferred magnetic field strength.\n", "  We study the behavior of large dust grains in turbulent molecular clouds\n(MCs). In primarily neutral regions, dust grains move as aerodynamic particles,\nnot necessarily with the gas. We therefore directly simulate, for the first\ntime, the behavior of aerodynamic grains in highly supersonic,\nmagnetohydrodynamic turbulence typical of MCs. We show that, under these\nconditions, grains with sizes a >0.01 micron exhibit dramatic (exceeding factor\n~1000) fluctuations in the local dust-to-gas ratio (implying large small-scale\nvariations in abundances, dust cooling rates, and dynamics). The dust can form\nhighly filamentary structures (which would be observed in both dust emission\nand extinction), which can be much thinner than the characteristic width of gas\nfilaments. Sometimes, the dust and gas filaments are not even in the same\nlocation. The 'clumping factor' of the dust (critical for dust\ngrowth/coagulation/shattering) can reach ~100, for grains in the ideal size\nrange. The dust clustering is maximized around scales ~0.2pc*(a/micron)*(100\ncm^-3/n_gas), and is 'averaged out' on larger scales. However, because the\ndensity varies widely in supersonic turbulence, the dynamic range of scales\n(and interesting grain sizes) for these fluctuations is much broader than in\nthe subsonic case. Our results are applicable to MCs of essentially all sizes\nand densities, but we note how Lorentz forces and other physics (neglected\nhere) may change them in some regimes. We discuss the potentially dramatic\nconsequences for star formation, dust growth and destruction, and dust-based\nobservations of MCs.\n", "  Temperature determines the relative probability of observing a physical\nsystem in an energy state when that system is energetically in equilibrium with\nits environment. In this paper, we present a theory for engineering the\ntemperature of a quantum system different from its ambient temperature. We\ndefine criteria for an engineered quantum bath that, when coupled to a quantum\nsystem with Hamiltonian $H$, drives the system to the equilibrium state\n$\\frac{e^{-H/T}}{{{\\rm{Tr}}}(e^{-H/T})}$ with a tunable parameter $T$. This is\nbasically an analog counterpart of the digital quantum metropolis algorithm.\nFor a system of superconducting qubits, we propose a circuit-QED approximate\nrealization of such an engineered thermal bath consisting of driven lossy\nresonators. Our proposal opens the path to simulate thermodynamical properties\nof many-body quantum systems of size not accessible to classical simulations.\nAlso we discuss how an artificial thermal bath can serve as a temperature knob\nfor a hybrid quantum-thermal annealer.\n", "  We show that in a multi-Higgs model in which one Higgs fits the LHC 125 GeV\nstate, one or more of the other Higgs bosons can mediate DM-nucleon\ninteractions with maximal DM isospin violation being possible for appropriate\nHiggs-quark couplings, independent of the nature of DM. We then consider the\nexplicit example of a Type II two-Higgs-doublet model, identifying the h or H\nas the 125 GeV state while the H or h, respectively, mediates DM-nucleon\ninteractions. Finally, we show that if a stable scalar, S, is added then it can\nbe a viable light DM candidate with correct relic density while obeying all\ndirect and indirect detection limits.\n", "  We compute the Hodge numbers for the quotients of complete intersection\nCalabi-Yau three-folds by groups of orders divisible by 4. We make use of the\npolynomial deformation method and the counting of invariant K\\\"ahler classes.\nThe quotients studied here have been obtained in the automated classification\nof V. Braun. Although the computer search found the freely acting groups, the\nHodge numbers of the quotients were not calculated. The freely acting groups,\n$G$, that arise in the classification are either $Z_2$ or contain $Z_4$, $Z_2\n\\times Z_2$, $Z_3$ or $Z_5$ as a subgroup. The Hodge numbers for the quotients\nfor which the group $G$ contains $Z_3$ or $Z_5$ have been computed previously.\nThis paper deals with the remaining cases, for which $G \\supseteq Z_4$ or\n$G\\supseteq Z_2 \\times Z_2$. We also compute the Hodge numbers for 99 of the\n166 CICY's which have $Z_2$ quotients.\n", "  We introduce a Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method which efficiently simulates\nin a sign-problem-free way a broad class of frustrated $S=1/2$ models with\ncompeting antiferromagnetic interactions. Our scheme uses the basis of total\nspin eigenstates of clusters of spins to avoid the severe sign problem faced by\nother QMC methods. We also flag important limitations of the new method, and\ncomment on possibilities for further progress.\n", "  Strength of the the symmetry spin filtering effect (as defined by the\nasymptotic behavior of the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) at large barrier\nthicknesses induced by this effect) is studied for the Fe/MgO/Fe magnetic\ntunnel junctions (MTJ). Based on the analysis of the band structure of bulk Fe\nand complex band structure of MgO we predict \\emph{native} for the symmetry\nspin filtering effect linear increase of the TMR in Fe/MgO/Fe MTJ with\nincreasing number of MgO layers, $N$. \\emph{Ab initio} calculations of\ntransmission functions performed for the Fe/MgO/Fe MTJ confirm our theoretical\npredictions for the strength of the symmetry spin filtering effect in broad\nrange of energies and $N$. Our calculations also show that the\n\\emph{combination} of the symmetry spin filtering effect and small surface\ntransmission function in minority spin channel at the Fe/MgO interface is\nresponsible for large $TMR>10,000\\%$ predicted for Fe/MgO/Fe MTJ for $N\n\\geqslant 8$. Proposed analysis of the strength of the symmetry filtering\neffect derived from the band structure of bulk electrode material could serve\nas a tool for quick material discovery search of suitable electrodes in context\nof emerging technologies that require high TMR.\n", "  We present numerical studies of the dynamics of vortices in the Ginzburg\nLandau model using equations derived from the gradient flow of the free energy.\nThese equations have previously been proposed to describe the dynamics of\nn-vortices away from equilibrium. We are able to model the dynamics of multiple\nn-vortex configurations starting far from equilibrium. We find generically that\nthere are two time scales for equilibration: a short time scale related to the\nformation time for a single n-vortex, and a longer time scale that\ncharacterizes vortex-vortex interactions.\n", "  The recently-proposed quasi distributions point out a promising direction for\nlattice QCD to investigate the light-cone correlators, such as parton\ndistribution functions (PDF) and distribution amplitudes (DA), directly in the\n$x$-space. Owing to its excessive simplicity, the heavy quarkonium can serve as\nan ideal theoretical laboratory to ascertain certain features of quasi-DA. In\nthe framework of non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) factorization, we compute the\norder-$\\alpha_s$ correction to both light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDA)\nand quasi-DA associated with the lowest-lying quarkonia, with the transverse\nmomentum UV cutoff interpreted as the renormalization scale. We confirm\nanalytically that the quasi-DA of a quarkonium does reduce to the respective\nLCDA in the infinite-momentum limit. We also observe that, provided that the\nmomentum of a charmonium reaches about 2-3 times its mass, the quasi-DAs\nalready converge to the LCDAs to a decent level. These results might provide\nsome useful guidance for the future lattice study of the quasi distributions.\n", "  We perform the first self-consistent, time-dependent, multi-group\ncalculations in two dimensions (2D) to address the consequences of using the\nray-by-ray+ transport simplification in core-collapse supernova simulations.\nSuch a dimensional reduction is employed by many researchers to facilitate\ntheir resource-intensive calculations. Our new code (F{\\sc{ornax}}) implements\nmulti-D transport, and can, by zeroing out transverse flux terms, emulate the\nray-by-ray+ scheme. Using the same microphysics, initial models, resolution,\nand code, we compare the results of simulating 12-, 15-, 20-, and\n25-M$_{\\odot}$ progenitor models using these two transport methods. Our\nfindings call into question the wisdom of the pervasive use of the ray-by-ray+\napproach. Employing it leads to maximum post-bounce/pre-explosion shock radii\nthat are almost universally larger by tens of kilometers than those derived\nusing the more accurate scheme, typically leaving the post-bounce matter less\nbound and artificially more \"explodable.\" In fact, for our 25-M$_{\\odot}$\nprogenitor, the ray-by-ray+ model explodes, while the corresponding multi-D\ntransport model does not. Therefore, in two dimensions the combination of\nray-by-ray+ with the axial sloshing hydrodynamics that is a feature of 2D\nsupernova dynamics can result in quantitatively, and perhaps qualitatively,\nincorrect results.\n", "  Constructing local hidden variable (LHV) models for entangled quantum states\nis challenging, as the model should reproduce quantum predictions for all\npossible local measurements. Here we present a simple method for building LHV\nmodels, applicable to general entangled states, which consists in verifying\nthat the statistics resulting from a finite set of measurements is local, a\nmuch simpler problem. This leads to a sequence of tests which, in the limit,\nfully capture the set of quantum states admitting a LHV model. Similar methods\nare developed for constructing local hidden state models. We illustrate the\npractical relevance of these methods with several examples, and discuss further\napplications.\n", "  Entanglement allows for the nonlocality of quantum theory, which is the\nresource behind device-independent quantum information protocols. However, not\nall entangled quantum states display nonlocality, and a central question is to\ndetermine the precise relation between entanglement and nonlocality. Here we\npresent the first general test to decide whether a quantum state is local, and\nthat can be implemented by semidefinite programming. This method can be applied\nto any given state and for the construction of new examples of states with\nlocal hidden-variable models for both projective and general measurements. As\napplications we provide a lower bound estimate of the fraction of two-qubit\nlocal entangled states and present new explicit examples of such states,\nincluding those which arise from physical noise models, Bell-diagonal states,\nand noisy GHZ and W states.\n", "  Principal component analysis is a multivariate statistical method frequently\nused in science and engineering to reduce the dimension of a problem or extract\nthe most significant features from a dataset. In this paper, using a similar\nnotion to the quantum counting, we show how to apply the amplitude\namplification together with the phase estimation algorithm to an operator in\norder to procure the eigenvectors of the operator associated to the eigenvalues\ndefined in the range $\\left[a, b\\right]$, where $a$ and $b$ are real and $0\n\\leq a \\leq b \\leq 1$. This makes possible to obtain a combination of the\neigenvectors associated to the largest eigenvalues and so can be used to do\nprincipal component analysis on quantum computers.\n", "  We carry out hydrodynamical simulation of the evolution of fluid in\nrelativistic heavy-ion collisions with random initial fluctuations. The time\nevolution of power spectrum of momentum anisotropies shows very strong\ncorrespondence with the physics of cosmic microwave anisotropies as was earlier\npredicted by some of us. In particular our results demonstrate suppression of\nsuperhorizon fluctuations and the correspondence between the location of the\nfirst peak in the power spectrum of momentum anisotropies and the length scale\nof fluctuations and expected freezeout time scale (more precisely, the sound\nhorizon size at freezeout).\n", "  We investigate a way of imposing simplicity constraints in a holomorphic Spin\nFoam model that we recently introduced. Rather than imposing the constraints on\nthe boundary spin network, as is usually done, one can impose the constraints\ndirectly on the Spin Foam propagator. We find that the two approaches have the\nsame leading asymptotic behaviour, with differences appearing at higher order.\nThis allows us to obtain a model that greatly simplifies calculations, but\nstill has Regge Calculus as its semi-classical limit.\n", "  We report the discovery of a multiply lensed Lyman-$\\alpha$ blob (LAB) behind\nthe galaxy cluster AS1063 using the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on\nthe Very Large Telescope (VLT). The background source is at $z=$ 3.117 and is\nintrinsically faint compared to almost all previously reported LABs. We used\nour highly precise strong lensing model to reconstruct the source properties,\nand we find an intrinsic luminosity of $L_{\\rm Ly\\alpha}$=$1.9\\times10^{42}$\nerg s$^{-1}$, extending to 33 kpc. We find that the LAB is associated with a\ngroup of galaxies, and possibly a protocluster, in agreement with previous\nstudies that find LABs in overdensities. In addition to Lyman-$\\alpha$\n(Ly$\\alpha$) emission, we find \\ion{C}{IV}, \\ion{He}{II}, and \\ion{O}{III}]\nultraviolet (UV) emission lines arising from the centre of the nebula. We used\nthe compactness of these lines in combination with the line ratios to conclude\nthat the \\Lya nebula is likely powered by embedded star formation. Resonant\nscattering of the \\Lya photons then produces the extended shape of the\nemission. Thanks to the combined power of MUSE and strong gravitational\nlensing, we are now able to probe the circumgalatic medium of sub-$L_{*}$\ngalaxies at $z\\approx 3$.\n", "  We study the frequency dependence of the optical conductivity $\\text{Re} \\,\n\\sigma(\\omega)$ of the Heisenberg spin-$1/2$ chain in the thermal and near the\ntransition to the many-body localized phase induced by the strength of a random\n$z$-directed magnetic field. Using the method of dynamical quantum typicality,\nwe calculate the real-time dynamics of the spin-current autocorrelation\nfunction and obtain the Fourier transform $\\text{Re} \\, \\sigma(\\omega)$ for\nsystem sizes much larger than accessible to standard exact-diagonalization\napproaches. We find that the low-frequency behavior of $\\text{Re} \\,\n\\sigma(\\omega)$ is well described by $\\text{Re} \\, \\sigma(\\omega) \\approx\n\\sigma_\\text{dc} + a \\, |\\omega|^\\alpha$, with $\\alpha \\approx 1$ in a wide\nrange within the thermal phase and close to the transition. We particularly\ndetail the decrease of $\\sigma_\\text{dc}$ in the thermal phase as a function of\nincreasing disorder for strong exchange anisotropies. We further find that the\ntemperature dependence of $\\sigma_\\text{dc}$ is consistent with the existence\nof a mobility edge.\n", "  Entanglement spectra (ES) for the critical SU(N) (2 <= N <= 4) spin chains\nand other integrable models of finite length are studied with the density\nmatrix renormalization group method. For all models under investigation, the\nlevel spacings and the degeneracy structure of the ES are in excellent\nagreement with the spectra of the corner Hamiltonian, defined as the generator\nof the associated corner transfer matrix. The correspondence holds between the\nES (n) at the n-th cut position from the edge of the spin model, and the corner\nHamiltonian of length n, for all small values of n. The cut position dependence\nof the ES shows a period-N oscillatory behavior for a given SU(N) chain,\nreminiscent of the oscillatory part of the entanglement entropy observed in the\npast for the same models. Oscillations of the ES do not die out in the bulk of\nthe chain, in contrast to the asymptotically vanishing oscillation of the\nentanglement entropy. Heuristic argument based on Young tableaux consideration\ncan explain the period-N structure of the ES qualitatively.\n", "  The longstanding discrepancy between bubble chamber measurements of\n$\\nu_\\mu$-induced single pion production channels has led to large\nuncertainties in pion production cross section parameters for many years. We\nextend the reanalysis of pion production data in deuterium bubble chambers\nwhere this discrepancy is solved (Wilkinson et al., PRD 90 (2014) 112017) to\ninclude the $\\nu_{\\mu}n\\rightarrow \\mu^{-}p\\pi^{0}$ and $\\nu_{\\mu}n\\rightarrow\n\\mu^{-}n\\pi^{+}$ channels, and use the resulting data to fit the parameters of\nthe GENIE (Rein-Sehgal) pion production model. We find a set of parameters that\ncan describe the bubble chamber data better than the GENIE default parameters,\nand provide updated central values and reduced uncertainties for use in\nneutrino oscillation and cross section analyses which use the GENIE model. We\nfind that GENIE's non-resonant background prediction has to be significantly\nreduced to fit the data, which may help to explain the recent discrepancies\nbetween simulation and data observed by the MINERvA coherent pion and NOvA\noscillation analyses.\n", "  High-resolution imaging of some protoplanetary disks in scattered light\nreveals presence of the global spiral arms of significant amplitude, likely\nexcited by massive planets or stellar companions. Assuming that these arms are\ndensity waves, evolving into spiral shocks, we assess their effect on the\nthermodynamics, accretion, and global evolution of the disk. We derive\nanalytical expressions for the direct (irreversible) heating, angular momentum\ntransport, and mass accretion rate induced by the disk shocks of arbitrary\nstrength. We find these processes to be very sensitive to the shock amplitude.\nFocusing on the waves of moderate strength (density jump at the shock\n$\\Delta\\Sigma/\\Sigma\\sim 1$) we show the associated disk heating to be\nnegligible (contributing at $\\sim 1\\%$ level to the energy budget) in passive,\nirradiated protoplanetary disks on $\\sim 100$ AU scales, but becoming important\nwithin several AU from the star. At the same time, shock heating can be a\nsignificant (or even dominant) energy source in disks of cataclysmic variables,\nstellar X-ray binaries, and supermassive black hole binaries, heated mainly by\nviscous dissipation. Mass accretion induced by the global spiral shocks is\ncomparable to (or exceeds) the mass inflow due to viscous stresses.\nProtoplanetary disks featuring prominent global spirals must be evolving\nrapidly, in $\\lesssim 0.5$ Myr at $\\sim 100$ AU. A direct upper limit on the\ndisk evolution timescale can be established via the measurement of the\ngravitational torque due to the spiral arms from the imaging data. Our findings\nsuggest that, regardless of their origin, global spiral waves must be important\nagents of the protoplanetary disk evolution. They may serve as an effective\nmechanism of disk dispersal and could be related to the transitional disk\nphenomenon.\n", "  The method for calculating the isotropic exchange interactions in the\nparamagnetic phase is proposed. It is based on the mapping of the\nhigh-temperature expansion of the spin-spin correlation function calculated for\nthe Heisenberg model onto Hubbard Hamiltonian one. The resulting expression for\nthe exchange interaction has a compact and transparent formulation. The quality\nof the calculated exchange interactions is estimated by comparing the\neigenvalue spectra of the Heisenberg model and low-energy magnetic part of the\nHubbard model. By the example of quantum rings with different hopping setups we\nanalyze the contributions from the different part of the Hubbard model spectrum\nto the resulting exchange interaction.\n", "  We measure the star formation properties of two large samples of galaxies\nfrom the SDSS in large-scale cosmic voids on time scales of 10 Myr and 100 Myr,\nusing H$\\alpha$ emission line strengths and GALEX FUV fluxes, respectively. The\nfirst sample consists of 109,818 optically selected galaxies. We find that void\ngalaxies in this sample have higher specific star formation rates (SSFRs; star\nformation rates per unit stellar mass) than similar stellar mass galaxies in\ndenser regions. The second sample is a subset of the optically selected sample\ncontaining 8070 galaxies with reliable HI detections from ALFALFA. For the full\nHI detected sample, SSFRs do not vary systematically with large-scale\nenvironment. However, investigating only the HI detected dwarf galaxies reveals\na trend towards higher SSFRs in voids. Furthermore, we estimate the star\nformation rate per unit HI mass (known as the star formation efficiency; SFE)\nof a galaxy, as a function of environment. For the overall HI detected\npopulation, we notice no environmental dependence. Limiting the sample to dwarf\ngalaxies again reveals a trend towards higher SFEs in voids. These results\nsuggest that void environments provide a nurturing environment for dwarf galaxy\nevolution allowing for higher specific star formation rates and efficiencies.\n", "  We study the shear viscosity in an effective hydrodynamic theory and\nholographic model where the translational symmetry is broken by massless scalar\nfields. We identify the shear viscosity, $\\eta$, from the coefficient of the\nshear tensor in the modified constitutive relation, constructed from\nthermodynamic quantities, fluid velocity and the scalar fields, which break the\ntranslational symmetry explicitly. Our construction of constitutive relation is\ninspired by those derived from the fluid/gravity correspondence in the weakly\ndisordered limit $m/T \\ll 1$. We show that the shear viscosity from the\nconstitutive relation deviates from the one obtained from the usual expression,\n$\\eta^\\star = -\\lim_{\\omega\\to 0}(1/\\omega) \\text{Im}\nG^{R}_{T^{xy}T^{xy}}(\\omega,k=0)$, even at the leading order in disorder\nstrength. In a simple holographic model with broken translational symmetry, we\nshow that both $\\eta/s$ and ${\\eta}^\\star/s$ violate the bound of\nviscosity-entropy ratio for arbitrary disorder strength.\n", "  We study the $D_s^+ \\rightarrow \\pi^+ \\, \\pi^+ \\, \\pi^-$ and $D_s^+\n\\rightarrow \\pi^+ \\, K^+ \\, K^-$ decays adopting a mechanism in which the\n$D_s^+$ meson decays weakly into a $\\pi^+$ and a $q\\bar{q}$ component, which\nhadronizes into two pseudoscalar mesons. The final state interaction between\nthese two pseudoscalar mesons is taken into account by using the Chiral Unitary\napproach in coupled channels, which gives rise to the $f_0(980)$ resonance.\nHence, we obtain the invariant mass distributions of the pairs $\\pi^+ \\pi^-$\nand $K^+ K^-$ after the decay of that resonance and compare our theoretical\namplitudes with those available from the experimental data. Our results are in\na fair agreement with these data, and a $f_0(980)$ signal is seen in both the\n$\\pi^+\\pi^-$ and $K^+K^-$ distributions.\n", "  We study the local dark matter velocity distribution in simulated Milky\nWay-mass galaxies, generated at high resolution with both dark matter and\nbaryons. We find that the dark matter in the Solar neighborhood is influenced\nappreciably by the inclusion of baryons, increasing the speed of dark matter\nparticles compared to dark matter-only simulations. The gravitational potential\ndue to the presence of a baryonic disk increases the amount of high velocity\ndark matter, resulting in velocity distributions which are more similar to the\nMaxwellian Standard Halo Model than predicted from dark matter-only\nsimulations. Further, the velocity structures present in baryonic simulations\npossess a greater diversity than expected from dark matter-only simulation. We\nshow the impact on the direct detection experiments LUX, DAMA/Libra, and CoGeNT\nusing our simulated velocity distributions, and explore how resolution and halo\nmass within the Milky Way's estimated mass range impact the results. A\nMaxwellian fit to the velocity distribution tends to overpredict the amount of\ndark matter in the high velocity tail, even with baryons, and thus leads to\noverly optimistic direct detection bounds on models which are dependent on this\nregion of phase space for an experimental signal. Our work further demonstrates\nthat it is critical to transform simulated velocity distributions to the lab\nframe of reference, due to the fact that velocity structure in the Solar\nneighborhood appears when baryons are included. There is more velocity\nstructure present when baryons are included than in dark matter-only\nsimulations. Even when baryons are included, the importance of the velocity\nstructure is not as apparent in the Galactic frame of reference as in the Earth\nframe.\n", "  In this work we study the effects of in-plane magnetic fields on thin films\nof the Dirac Semimetal (DSM) \\ce{Na2Bi} where one of the in-plane directions is\nperpendicular to the $k$-separation between the two Weyl points for each spin\norientation. We show numerically that the states localized near the surface of\nthese thin films are related to the Fermi arc states in semi-infinite slabs.\nDue to the anisotropy between the two in-plane directions, the application of a\nmagnetic field along these directions have differing effects. A field parallel\nto the $k$ space separation between the Weyl points leads to a broadening of\nthe surface state band and a formation of an energy plateau, while a\nperpendicular field shifts the energy where the hole and particle bands meet\nupwards and sharpens the tips of the bands. We illustrate the effects of these\nchanges to the bandstructure by studying the transmission from a source segment\nwithout a magnetic field to a drain segment with a field with the field and\ninterface at various in-plane directions.\n", "  We study dust capture by vortices and its long-term consequences in global\ntwo-fluid inviscid disk simulations using a new polar grid code RoSSBi. We\nperform the longest integrations so far, several hundred disk orbits, at the\nhighest resolution attainable in global simulations of disks with dust, namely\n2048x4096 grid points. This allows to study the dust evolution well beyond\nvortex dissipation. We vary a wide range of parameters, most notably the\ndust-to-gas ratio in the initial setup varies in the range $10^{-3}$ to $0.1$.\nIrrespective of the initial dust-to-gas ratio we find rapid concentration of\nthe dust inside vortices, reaching dust-to-gas ratios of order unity inside the\nvortex. We present an analytical model that describes very well the dust\ncapture process inside vortices, finding consistent results for all dust-to-gas\nratios. A vortex streaming instability develops which causes invariably vortex\ndestruction. After vortex dissipation large-scale dust-rings encompassing a\ndisk annulus form in most cases, which sustain very high dust concentration,\napproaching ratios of order unity. The rings are long lived lasting as long as\nthe duration of the simulations. They also develop a streaming instability,\nwhich manifests itself in eddies at various scales within which the dust forms\ncompact high density clumps. Such clumps would be unstable to gravitational\ncollapse in absence of strong dissipation by viscous forces. When vortices are\nparticularly long lived, rings do not form but dust clumps inside vortices\nbecome then long lived features and would likely undergo collapse by\ngravitational instability. Rings encompass almost an Earth mass of solid\nmaterial, while even larger masses of dust do accumulate inside vortices in the\nearlier stage. We argue that rapid planetesimal formation would occur in the\ndust clumps inside the vortices as well as in the post-vortex ring.\n", "  We present four classes of nonlinear systems which may be considered discrete\nanalogues of the Garnier system. These systems arise as discrete isomonodromic\ndeformations of systems of linear difference equations in which the associated\nLax matrices are presented in a factored form. A system of discrete\nisomonodromic deformations is completely determined by commutation relations\nbetween the factors. We also reparameterize these systems in terms of the image\nand kernel vectors at singular points to obtain a separate birational form. A\ndistinguishing feature of this study is the presence of a symmetry condition on\nthe associated linear problems that only appears as a necessary feature of the\nLax pairs for the least degenerate discrete Painlev\\'e equations.\n", "  RCW 86 is a young supernova remnant (SNR) showing a shell-type structure at\nseveral wavelengths and is thought to be an efficient cosmic-ray (CR)\naccelerator. Earlier \\textit{Fermi} Large Area Telescope results reported the\ndetection of $\\gamma$-ray emission coincident with the position of RCW 86 but\nits origin (leptonic or hadronic) remained unclear due to the poor statistics.\nThanks to 6.5 years of data acquired by the \\textit{Fermi}-LAT and the new\nevent reconstruction Pass 8, we report the significant detection of spatially\nextended emission coming from RCW 86. The spectrum is described by a power-law\nfunction with a very hard photon index ($\\Gamma = 1.42 \\pm 0.1_{\\rm stat} \\pm\n0.06_{\\rm syst}$) in the 0.1--500 GeV range and an energy flux above 100 MeV of\n($2.91$ $\\pm$ $0.8_{\\rm stat}$ $\\pm$ $0.12_{\\rm syst}$) $\\times$ $10^{-11}$ erg\ncm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. Gathering all the available multiwavelength (MWL) data, we\nperform a broadband modeling of the nonthermal emission of RCW 86 to constrain\nparameters of the nearby medium and bring new hints about the origin of the\n$\\gamma$-ray emission. For the whole SNR, the modeling favors a leptonic\nscenario in the framework of a two-zone model with an average magnetic field of\n10.2 $\\pm$ 0.7 $\\mu$G and a limit on the maximum energy injected into protons\nof 2 $\\times$ 10$^{49}$ erg for a density of 1 cm$^{-3}$. In addition,\nparameter values are derived for the North-East (NE) and South-West (SW)\nregions of RCW 86, providing the first indication of a higher magnetic field in\nthe SW region.\n", "  This article reviews our present knowledge of neutrino interactions with\nnucleons and discusses the interactions with nuclei, the target material of all\npresently running and planned long-baseline experiments. I emphasize\ndescriptions of semi-inclusive reactions and full descriptions of the final\nstate; the latter are needed to reconstruct the incoming neutrino energy from\nfinal-state observations. I then discuss Monte Carlo generator and more\nadvanced transport theoretical approaches in connection with experimental\nresults on various reaction mechanisms. Finally, I describe the effects of\nuncertainties in the reconstruction of the incoming neutrino energy on\noscillation parameters. The review argues that the precision era of neutrino\nphysics also needs precision-era generators.\n", "  Pyrochlore iridates and pyrochlore ices are two families of materials where\nnovel quantum phenomena are intertwined with strong spin-orbit coupling,\nsubstantial electron correlation and geometrical frustration. Motivated by the\npuzzling experiments on two pyrochlore systems Pr2Ir2O7 and Yb2Ti2O7, we study\nthe proximate Ising orders and the quantum phase transition out of quantum spin\nice U(1) quantum spin liquid (QSL). We apply the electromagnetic duality of the\ncompact quantum electrodynamics to analyze the \"magnetic monopoles\"\ncondensation for U(1) QSL. The monopole condensation transition represents a\nunconventional quantum criticality with unusual scaling laws. It naturally\nleads to the Ising orders that belong to the \"2-in 2-out\" spin ice manifold and\ngenerically have an enlarged magnetic unit cell. We demonstrate that the\nantiferormagnetic Ising state with the ordering wavevector ${\\bf Q} =\n2\\pi(001)$ is proximate to U(1) QSL while the ferromagnetic Ising state with\n${\\bf Q}=(000)$ is not proximate to U(1) QSL. This implies that if there exists\na direct transition from U(1) QSL to the ferromagnetic Ising state, the\ntransition must be strongly first order. We apply the theory to Pr2Ir2O7 and\nYb2Ti2O7.\n", "  The self-consistent field theory (SCFT) is used to study the mean potential\nnear a charged plate inside a $m:-n$ electrolyte. A perturbation series is\ndeveloped in terms of $g = 4 \\pi b/\\ell_{\\rm {\\scriptscriptstyle DB}}$, where\n$b, \\ell_{\\rm{\\scriptscriptstyle DB}}$ are Bjerrum length and {\\em bare} Debye\nlength respectively. To the zeroth order, we obtain nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann\ntheory. For asymmetric electrolytes ($m \\neq n$), the first order (one-loop)\ncorrection to mean potential contains a {\\em secular term}, which indicates the\nbreakdown of regular perturbation method. Using a renormalizaton group\ntransformation (RG), we remove the secular term and obtain a globally\nwell-behaved one-loop approximation with {\\em a renormalized Debye length} and\n{\\em a renormalized surface charge density}. Furthermore, we find that if the\ncounter-ions are multivalent, the surface charge density is renormalized\nsubstantially {\\em downwards}, and may undergo a change of sign, if the bare\nsurface charge density is sufficiently large.\n", "  Kinetically constrained spin systems play an important role in understanding\nkey properties of the dynamics of slowly relaxing materials, such as glasses.\nSo far kinetic constraints have been introduced in idealised models aiming to\ncapture specific dynamical properties of these systems. However, recently it\nhas been experimentally shown by [M. Valado et al., arXiv:1508.04384 (2015)]\nthat manifest kinetic constraints indeed govern the evolution of strongly\ninteracting gases of highly excited atoms in a noisy environment. Motivated by\nthis development we address and discuss the question concerning the type of\nkinetically constrained dynamics which can generally emerge in quantum spin\nsystems subject to strong noise. We discuss an experimentally-realizable case\nwhich displays collective behavior, timescale separation and dynamical\nreducibility.\n", "  The order of the thermal phase transition in the chiral limit of Quantum\nChromodynamics (QCD) with two dynamical flavors of quarks is a long-standing\nissue and still not known in the continuum limit. Whether the transition is\nfirst or second order has important implications for the QCD phase diagram and\nthe existence of a critical endpoint at finite densities. We follow a recently\nproposed approach to explicitly determine the region of first order chiral\ntransitions at imaginary chemical potential, where it is large enough to be\nsimulated, and extrapolate it to zero chemical potential with known critical\nexponents. Using unimproved Wilson fermions on coarse $N_t=4$ lattices, the\nfirst order region turns out to be so large that no extrapolation is necessary.\nThe critical pion mass $m_\\pi^c\\approx 560$ MeV is by nearly a factor 10 larger\nthan the corresponding one using staggered fermions. Our results are in line\nwith investigations of three-flavour QCD using improved Wilson fermions and\nindicate that the systematic error on the two-flavour chiral transition is\nstill of order 100\\%.\n", "  Density inhomogeneity in the intergalactic medium (IGM) can boost the\nrecombination rate of ionized gas substantially, affecting the growth of HII\nregions during reionization. Previous attempts to quantify this effect\ntypically failed to resolve down to the Jeans scale in the pre-ionization IGM,\nwhich is important in establishing this effect, along with the hydrodynamical\nback-reaction of reionization on it. Towards that end, we perform a set of\nfully-coupled, radiation-hydrodynamics simulations from cosmological initial\nconditions, extending the mass resolution of previous work to the scale of\nminihalos. Pre-reionization structure is evolved until a redshift $z_i$ at\nwhich the ionizing radiation from external sources arrives to sweep an R-type\nionization front supersonically across the volume in a few Myr, until it is\ntrapped on the surfaces of minihalos and converted to D-type, after which the\nminihalo gas is removed by photoevaporative winds. Small-scale density\nstructures during this time lead to a high ($>$10) clumping factor for ionized\ngas, which hugely boosts the recombination rate until the structures are\ndisrupted by the hydrodynamic feedback after $\\sim 10-100~\\rm{Myr}$. For\nincoming stellar radiation with intensity $J_{21}$ in a $200~h^{-1}~\\rm{kpc}$\nbox with the mean density contrast $\\bar\\delta$, the number of extra\nrecombinations per H atom, on top of what is expected from homogeneously\ndistributed gas, is given by\n$0.32[J_{21}]^{0.12}[(1+z_i)/11]^{-1.7}[1+\\bar\\delta]^{2.5}$. In models in\nwhich most of the volume is ionized toward the end of reionization, this can\nadd more than one recombination per H atom to the ionizing photon budget to\nachieve reionization.\n", "  Considering the experimental constraints given by CMS collaboration at\n$\\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV on the strength of top quark flavour-changing\nneutral-current (FCNC) couplings $tq\\gamma$ and $tqg$, we investigate the\nproduction of top quark in association with a photon and carry out a full\nsimulation for the signals $\\ell\\nu b\\gamma$ and $jjb\\gamma$ at 14 TeV LHC. In\nour numerical analysis, the contributions of single top production with a\nphoton radiation off the top decay products are also included. The discovery\npotential for anomalous couplings $tq\\gamma$ and $tqg$ with an integrated\nluminosity of 100 fb$^{-1}$ are examined in detail.\n", "  A dielectric elastomer generator (DEG) can be used for converting mechanical\nenergy from natural motion sources such as walking, waves, trees etc, into\nelectrical energy. A DEG is comprised of a soft and flexible Dielectric\nElastomer capacitor (DE), a Priming Circuit (PC), which transfers high\npotential charge onto/off the DE electrodes, and a power extraction circuit\nwhich harvests the generated power. To generate power, the PC must charge and\ndischarge the DE in synchronization with the DE's capacitance change. A simple\ncircuit to do this exists: the self-priming circuit (SPC). The SPC consists of\ndiodes and capacitors which passively switch between charge delivery and charge\nreceiving states in synchronization with the DE's capacitance change. Until now\nthere has been no understanding of how to design a SPC in order to maximize\nharvested energy from the dielectric elastomer (DE). A new mathematical model\nfor a SPC is presented, leading to design and optimization. An accuracy of 0.1%\nbetween model, simulation and experiment is obtained once losses are taken into\nconsideration. The behavior of the SPC is shown to be related to the maximum\nand minimum capacitance's of the DE, but is largley unaffected by the exact\ncapacitance waveform\n", "  We compute the transport coefficients, namely, the coefficients of shear and\nbulk viscosity as well as thermal conductivity for hot and dense quark matter.\nThe calculations are performed within the Nambu- Jona Lasinio (NJL) model. The\nestimation of the transport coefficients is made using a quasiparticle approach\nof solving the Boltzmann kinetic equation within the relaxation time\napproximation. The transition rates are calculated in a manifestly covariant\nmanner to estimate the thermal-averaged cross sections for quark-quark and\nquark-antiquark scattering. The calculations are performed for finite chemical\npotential also. Within the parameters of the model, the ratio of shear\nviscosity to entropy density has a minimum at the Mott transition temperature.\nAt vanishing chemical potential, the ratio of bulk viscosity to entropy\ndensity, on the other hand, decreases with temperature with a sharp decrease\nnear the critical temperature, and vanishes beyond it. At finite chemical\npotential, however, it increases slowly with temperature beyond the Mott\ntemperature. The coefficient of thermal conductivity also shows a minimum at\nthe critical temperature.\n", "  We exploit deep integral-field spectroscopic observations with KMOS/VLT of\n240 star-forming disks at 0.6 < z < 2.6 to dynamically constrain their mass\nbudget. Our sample consists of massive ($\\gtrsim 10^{9.8} M_\\odot$) galaxies\nwith sizes $R_e \\gtrsim 2$ kpc. By contrasting the observed velocity and\ndispersion profiles to dynamical models, we find that on average the stellar\ncontent contributes $32^{+8}_{-7}\\%$ of the total dynamical mass, with a\nsignificant spread among galaxies (68th percentile range f_star ~ 18 - 62%).\nIncluding molecular gas as inferred from CO- and dust-based scaling relations,\nthe estimated baryonic mass adds up to $56^{+17}_{-12}\\%$ of total for the\ntypical galaxy in our sample, reaching ~ 90% at z > 2. We conclude that baryons\nmake up most of the mass within the disk regions of high-redshift star-forming\ndisk galaxies, with typical disks at z > 2 being strongly baryon-dominated\nwithin $R_e$. Substantial object-to-object variations in both stellar and\nbaryonic mass fractions are observed among the galaxies in our sample, larger\nthan what can be accounted for by the formal uncertainties in their respective\nmeasurements. In both cases, the mass fractions correlate most strongly with\nmeasures of surface density. High $\\Sigma_{star}$ galaxies feature stellar mass\nfractions closer to unity, and systems with high inferred gas or baryonic\nsurface densities leave less room for additional mass components other than\nstars and molecular gas. Our findings can be interpreted as more extended disks\nprobing further (and more compact disks probing less far) into the dark matter\nhalos that host them.\n", "  We advance a quantitative description of the critical shear rate\n$\\dot{\\gamma_c}$ needed to dislodge a spherical particle resting on a surface\nwith a model asperity in laminar and turbulent fluid flows. We have built a\ncone-plane experimental apparatus which enables measurement of $\\dot{\\gamma_c}$\nover a wide range of particle Reynolds number $Re_p$ from $10^{-3}$ to $1.5\n\\times 10^3$. The condition to dislodge the particle is found to be consistent\nwith the torque balance condition, which { yields a lower $\\dot{\\gamma_c}$\ncompared with} force balance because of the torque component due to drag about\nthe particle center. The data for $Re_p < 0.5$ is in good agreement with\nanalytical calculations of the drag and lift coefficients in the $Re_p\n\\rightarrow 0$ limit. For higher $Re_p$, where analytical results are\nunavailable, the hydrodynamic coefficients are found to approach a constant for\n$Re_p > 1000$. We show that a linear combination of the hydrodynamic\ncoefficients found in the viscous and inertial limits can describe the observed\n$\\dot{\\gamma_c}$ as a function of the particle and fluid properties.\n", "  We evidence critical fluctuations in the strain-rate of granular flows that\nare weakly vibrated. Strikingly, the critical point arises at {\\em finite}\nvalues of the mean strain rate and vibration strength, far away from the\nyielding critical point at zero flow rate. We show that the global rheology, as\nwell as the amplitude and correlation time of the fluctuations, are consistent\nwith a mean-field, Landau like description, where strain rate and stress act as\nconjugated variables. We introduce a general model which captures the observed\nphenomenology, and argue that this type of critical behavior generically arises\nwhen self fluidization competes with friction.\n", "  Magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)2) has a layered brucite-like structure in its\nbulk form and was recently isolated as a new member of 2D monolayer materials.\nWe investigated the electronic and optical properties of monolayer crystals of\nMg(OH)2 and WS2 and their possible heterobilayer structure by means of first\nprinciples calculations. It was found that both monolayers of Mg(OH)2 and WS 2\nare direct-gap semiconductors and these two monolayers form a typical van der\nWaals heterostructure with a weak interlayer interaction and a type-II band\nalignment with a staggered gap that spatially seperates electrons and holes. We\nalso showed that an out-of-plane electric field induces a transition from a\nstaggered to a straddling type heterojunction. Moreover, by solving the\nBethe-Salpeter equation on top of single shot G0 W0 calculations, we show that\nthe oscillator strength of the intralayer excitons of the heterostructure is an\norder of magnitude larger than the oscillator strength of the interlayer\nexcitons. Because of the staggered interfacial gap and the field- tunable\nenergy band structure, the Mg(OH)2 -WS2 heterobilayer can become an important\ncandidate for various optoelectronic device applications in nanoscale.\n", "  We present the analysis of the planetary microlensing event\nOGLE-2014-BLG-1760, which shows a strong light curve signal due to the presence\nof a Jupiter mass-ratio planet. One unusual feature of this event is that the\nsource star is quite blue, with $V-I = 1.48\\pm 0.08$. This is marginally\nconsistent with source star in the Galactic bulge, but it could possibly\nindicate a young source star in the far side of the disk. Assuming a bulge\nsource, we perform a Bayesian analysis assuming a standard Galactic model, and\nthis indicates that the planetary system resides in or near the Galactic bulge\nat $D_L = 6.9 \\pm 1.1 $ kpc. It also indicates a host star mass of $M_* = 0.51\n\\pm 0.44 M_\\odot$, a planet mass of $m_p = 180 \\pm 110 M_\\oplus$, and a\nprojected star-planet separation of $a_\\perp = 1.7\\pm 0.3\\,$AU. The lens-source\nrelative proper motion is $\\mu_{\\rm rel} = 6.5\\pm 1.1$ mas/yr. The lens (and\nstellar host star) is predicted to be very faint, so it is most likely that it\ncan detected only when the lens and source stars are partially resolved. Due to\nthe relatively high relative proper motion, the lens and source will be\nresolved to about $\\sim46\\,$mas in 6-8 years after the peak magnification. So,\nby 2020 - 2022, we can hope to detect the lens star with deep, high resolution\nimages.\n", "  We constrain the binary parameters of the eclipsing accreting X-ray binary\nIGR J17451--3022 and the nature of its donor star. The donor mass, its radius,\nand the system inclination angle are computed based on the system orbital\nperiod and eclipse duration recently reported by Bozzo et al.\\ (2016). We find\nthat the donor is most likely a main-sequence star with the mass comprised\nwithin the range $\\sim$(0.5--$0.8){\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ and the radius of $\\sim\\!\n0.7{\\rm R}_{\\odot}$. Assuming that the accreting compact object in IGR\nJ17451--3022 is a neutron star, the duration of the nearly total rectangular\neclipses yields the inclination angle of the system of $71^\\circ\\lesssim\ni\\lesssim 76^\\circ$, compatible with the presence of dips in this system. We\nrule out the presence of either brown or white dwarf. However, we find an\nalternative possibility that the donor star in IGR J17451--3022 could be a\npartially stripped giant with a very low mass, $\\sim\\! 0.2{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$.\nThis case requires a substantial mass loss prior to the formation of the\ngiant-star He core. According to that solution, the radius would be $\\sim\\!\n0.4{\\rm R}_{\\odot}$, at $i\\sim 80^\\circ$. We additionally show that the\nwell-known approximate dependence of the giant-star radius exclusively on its\ncore mass breaks down below $\\sim\\!0.3{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$.\n", "  The mass and age of substellar objects are degenerate parameters leaving the\nevolutionary state of brown dwarfs ambiguous without additional information.\nTheoretical models are normally used to help distinguish between old, massive\nbrown dwarfs and young, low mass brown dwarfs but these models have yet to be\nproperly calibrated. We have carried out an infrared high-contrast imaging\nprogram with the goal of detecting substellar objects as companions to nearby\nstars to help break degeneracies in inferred physical properties such as mass,\nage, and composition. Rather than using imaging observations alone, our targets\nare pre-selected based on the existence of dynamical accelerations informed\nfrom years of stellar radial velocity (RV) measurements. In this paper, we\npresent the discovery of a rare benchmark brown dwarf orbiting the nearby\n($d=18.69\\pm0.19$ pc), solar-type (G9V) star HD 4747 ([Fe/H]=$-0.22\\pm0.04$)\nwith a projected separation of only $\\rho=11.3\\pm0.2$ AU ($\\theta \\approx$\n0.6\"). Precise Doppler measurements taken over 18 years reveal the companion's\norbit and allow us to place strong constraints on its mass using dynamics ($m\n\\sin(i) = 55.3\\pm1.9M_J$). Relative photometry ($\\Delta K_s=9.05\\pm0.14$,\n$M_{K_s}=13.00\\pm0.14$, $K_s - L' = 1.34\\pm0.46$) indicates that HD 4747 B is\nmost-likely a late-type L-dwarf and, if near the L/T transition, an intriguing\nsource for studying cloud physics, variability, and polarization. We estimate a\nmodel-dependent mass of $m=72^{+3}_{-13}M_J$ for an age of $3.3^{+2.3}_{-1.9}$\nGyr based on gyrochronology. Combining astrometric measurements with RV data,\nwe calculate the companion dynamical mass ($m=60.2\\pm3.3M_J$) and orbit\n($e=0.740\\pm0.002$) directly. As a new mass, age, and metallicity benchmark, HD\n4747 B will serve as a laboratory for precision astrophysics to test\ntheoretical models that describe the emergent radiation of brown dwarfs.\n", "  The two-dimensional dissipative quantum XY model is applicable to the\nquantum-critical properties of diverse experimental systems, ranging from the\nsuperconductor to insulator transitions, ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic\ntransitions in metals, to the loop-current order transition in the cuprates. We\nsolve the re-expression of this model in terms of topological excitations:\nvortices and a variety of instantons, by renormalization group methods. The\ncalculations explain the extraordinary properties of the model discovered in\nMonte-Carlo calculations: the separability of the quantum critical fluctuations\n(QCF) in space and time, the spatial correlation length proportional to\nlogarithm of the temporal correlation length near the transition from\ndisordered to the fully ordered state, and the occurrence of a phase with\nspatial order without temporal order. They are intimately related to the flow\nof the metric of time in relation to the metric of space, i.e. of the dynamical\ncritical exponent $z$. These properties appear to be essential in understanding\nthe strange metallic phase found in a variety of quantum-critical transitions\nas well as the accompanying high temperature superconductivity.\n", "  In the general setting of the problem, the explicit compact formulae are\nderived for the ponderomotive forces in the macroscopic electrodynamics of\nmoving media in the Minkowski and Abraham approaches. Taking account of the\nMinkowski constitutive equations and making use of a special representation for\nthe Abraham energy-momentum tensor enable one to obtain a compact expression\nfor the Abraham force in the case of arbitrary dependence of the medium\nvelocity on spatial coordinates and the time and for nonstationary external\nelectromagnetic field. We term the difference between the ponderomotive forces\nin the Abraham and Minkowski approaches as the Abraham force not only under\nconsideration of media at rest but also in the case of moving media. The\nLorentz force is found which is exerted by external electromagnetic field on\nthe conduction current in a medium, the covariant Ohm law and the constitutive\nMinkowski relations being taken into account. The physical argumentation is\ntraced for definition of the 4-vector of the ponderomotive force as the\n4-divergence of the energy-momentum tensor of electromagnetic field in a\nmedium.\n", "  We study charge and energy diffusion in simple holographic theories with\nbroken translational symmetry. We find that when the effects of momentum\nrelaxation are very strong the diffusion constants take universal values $D_{c}\n\\sim D_{e} \\sim \\hbar v_B^2/(k_B T)$. Here $v_B$ is the velocity of the\nbutterfly effect and the coefficients of proportionality depend only on the\nscaling exponents of the infra-red fixed point. Our results suggest that\ndiffusion in these incoherent black holes is controlled by $\\tau \\sim\n{\\hbar}/(k_B T)$ independently of the mechanism of momentum relaxation.\n", "  We report on a two-flavor lattice QCD study of the axial, charge and matter\ndistributions of the $B$ meson and its first radial excitation. As our\nframework is the static limit of Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET), taking\ntheir Fourier transform gives access to several form factors at the kinematical\npoint $q^2=0$. Moreover they provide some useful information on the nature of\nan excited state, i.e. a radial excitation of a quark-antiquark bound state or\na multihadron state.\n", "  We study the evolution of black hole entropy and temperature in collapse\nscenarios, finding three generic lessons. First, entropy evolution is\nextensive. Second, at large times, entropy and temperature ring with twice the\nfrequency of the lowest quasinormal mode. Third, the entropy oscillations\nsaturate black hole area theorems in general relativity. The first two features\nare characteristic of entanglement dynamics in `democratic' models. Solely\nbased on general relativity and Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula, our results\npoint to democratic models as microscopic theories of black holes. The third\nfeature can be taken as a prediction for democratic models coming from black\nhole physics.\n", "  It is now well-established that photonic systems can exhibit topological\nenergy bands; similar to their electronic counterparts, this leads to the\nformation of chiral edge modes which can be used to transmit light in a manner\nthat is protected against back-scattering. While it is understood how classical\nsignals can propagate under these conditions, it is an outstanding important\nquestion how the quantum vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field get\nmodified in the presence of a topological band structure. We address this\nchallenge by exploring a setting where a non-zero topological invariant\nguarantees the presence of a parametrically-unstable chiral edge mode in a\nsystem with boundaries, even though there are no bulk-mode instabilities. We\nshow that one can exploit this to realize a topologically protected,\nquantum-limited travelling-wave parametric amplifier. The device is naturally\nprotected both against internal losses and back-scattering; the latter feature\nis in stark contrast to standard travelling wave amplifiers. This adds a new\nexample to the list of potential quantum devices that profit from topological\ntransport.\n", "  Scalar dark energy fields that couple to the Standard Model can give rise to\nobservable signatures at the LHC. In this work we show that $t\\bar t+$missing\nenergy and mono-jet searches are suitable probes in the limit where the dark\nenergy scalar is stable on collider distances. We discuss the prospects of\ndistinguishing the dark energy character of new physics signals from dark\nmatter signatures and the possibility of probing the self-interactions of the\ndark energy sector.\n", "  Beam-target double spin asymmetries and target single-spin asymmetries in\nexclusive $\\pi^+$ and $\\pi^-$ electroproduction were obtained from scattering\nof 1.6 to 5.7 GeV longitudinally polarized electrons from longitudinally\npolarized protons (for $\\pi^+$) and deuterons (for $\\pi^-$) using the CEBAF\nLarge Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS) at Jefferson Lab. The kinematic range\ncovered is $1.1<W<2.6$ GeV and $0.05<Q^2<5$ GeV$^2$, with good anglular\ncoverage in the forward hemisphere. The asymmetry results were divided into\napproximately 40,000 kinematic bins for $\\pi^+$ from free protons and 15,000\nbins for $\\pi^-$ production from bound nucleons in the deuteron. The present\nresults are found to be in reasonable agreement with fits to previous world\ndata for $W<1.7$ GeV and $Q^2<0.5$ GeV$^2$, with discrepancies increasing at\nhigher values of $Q^2$, especially for $W>1.5$ GeV. Very large target-spin\nasymmetries are observed for $W>1.6$ GeV. When combined with cross section\nmeasurements, the present results will provide powerful constraints on nucleon\nresonance amplitudes at moderate and large values of $Q^2$, for resonances with\nmasses as high as 2.3 GeV.\n", "  We report the first measurement of the flux-averaged cross section for\ncharged current coherent $\\pi^{+}$ production on carbon for neutrino energies\nless than 1.5 GeV to a restricted final state phase space region in the T2K\nnear detector, ND280. Comparisons are made with predictions from the\nRein-Sehgal coherent production model and the model by Alvarez-Ruso {\\it et\nal.}, the latter representing the first implementation of an instance of the\nnew class of microscopic coherent models in a neutrino interaction Monte Carlo\nevent generator. This results contradicts the null results reported by K2K and\nSciBooNE in a similar neutrino energy region.\n", "  In this work we study the quantum periods together with their Picard-Fuchs\ndifferential equations of Calabi-Yau fourfolds. In contrast to Calabi-Yau\nthreefolds, we argue that the large volume points of Calabi-Yau fourfolds\ngenerically are regular singular points of the Picard-Fuchs operators of\nnon-maximally unipotent monodromy. We demonstrate this property in explicit\nexamples of Calabi-Yau fourfolds with a single Kahler modulus. For these\nexamples we construct integral quantum periods and study their global\nproperties in the quantum Kahler moduli space with the help of numerical\nanalytic continuation techniques. Furthermore, we determine their genus zero\nGromov-Witten invariants, their Klemm-Pandharipande meeting invariants, and\ntheir genus one BPS invariants. In our computations we emphasize the features\nattributed to the non-maximally unipotent monodromy property. For instance, it\nimplies the existence of integral quantum periods that at large volume are\npurely worldsheet instanton generated. To verify our results, we also present\nintersection theory techniques to enumerate lines with a marked point on\ncomplete intersection Calabi-Yau fourfolds in Grassmannian varieties.\n", "  We consider the low scale implications in the U(1)' extended MSSM (UMSSM). We\nrestrict the parameter space such that the lightest supersymmetric particle\n(LSP) is always the lightest neutralino. In addition, we impose quasi Yukawa\nunification (QYU) at the grand unification scale (M_GUT). QYU strictly requires\nthe ratios among the yukawa couplings as y_t/y_b ~ 1.2, y_tau/y_b ~ 1.4, and\ny_t/y_tau ~ 0.8. We find that the need of fine-tuning over the fundamental\nparameter space of QYU is in the acceptable range (Delta_EW <= 10^3), even if\nthe universal boundary conditions are imposed at M_ GUT, in contrast to CMSSM\nand NUHM. UMSSM with the universal boundary conditions yields heavy stops\n(m_{stop} >~ 2.5 TeV), gluinos (m_gluino >~ 2 TeV), and squarks from the first\ntwo families (m_squarks >~ 4 TeV). Similarly the stau mass is bounded from\nbelow at about 1.5 TeV. Despite this heavy spectrum, we find Delta_EW >~ 300,\nwhich is much lower than that needed for the minimal supersymmetric models. In\naddition, UMSSM yield relatively small mu-term, and the LSP neutralio is mostly\nform by the Higgsinos of mass >~ 700 GeV. We obtain also bino-like dark matter\n(DM) of mass about 400 GeV. Wino is usually found to be heavier than Higgsinos\nand binos, but there is a small region where mu ~ M_1 ~ M_2 ~ 1 TeV. We also\nidentify chargino-neutralino coannihilation channel and A-resonance solutions\nwhich reduce the relic abundance of LSP neutralino down to the ranges\ncompatible with the current WMAP measurements.\n", "  We determine the ultimate potential of quantum imaging for boosting the\nresolution of a far-field, diffraction-limited, linear imaging device within\nthe paraxial approximation. First we show that the problem of estimating the\nseparation between two point-like sources is equivalent to the estimation of\nthe loss parameters of two lossy bosonic channels, i.e., the transmissivities\nof two beam splitters. Using this representation, we establish the ultimate\nprecision bound for resolving two point-like sources in an arbitrary quantum\nstate, with a simple formula for the specific case of two thermal sources. We\nfind that the precision bound scales with the number of collected photons\naccording to the standard quantum limit. Then we determine the sources whose\nseparation can be estimated optimally, finding that quantum-correlated sources\n(entangled or discordant) can be super-resolved at the sub-Rayleigh scale. Our\nresults set the upper bounds on any present or future imaging technology, from\nastronomical observation to microscopy, which is based on quantum detection as\nwell as source engineering.\n", "  We study a quantum mechanical model proposed by Sachdev, Ye and Kitaev. The\nmodel consists of $N$ Majorana fermions with random interactions of a few\nfermions at a time. It it tractable in the large $N$ limit, where the classical\nvariable is a bilocal fermion bilinear. The model becomes strongly interacting\nat low energies where it develops an emergent conformal symmetry. We study two\nand four point functions of the fundamental fermions. This provides the\nspectrum of physical excitations for the bilocal field.\n  The emergent conformal symmetry is a reparametrization symmetry, which is\nspontaneously broken to $SL(2,R)$, leading to zero modes. These zero modes are\nlifted by a small residual explicit breaking, which produces an enhanced\ncontribution to the four point function. This contribution displays a maximal\nLyapunov exponent in the chaos region (out of time ordered correlator). We\nexpect these features to be universal properties of large $N$ quantum mechanics\nsystems with emergent reparametrization symmetry.\n  This article is largely based on talks given by Kitaev \\cite{KitaevTalks},\nwhich motivated us to work out the details of the ideas described there.\n", "  Flavor ratios of very high energy astrophysical neutrinos, which can be\nstudied at the Earth by a neutrino telescope such as IceCube, can serve to\ndiagnose their production mechanism at the astrophysical source. The flavor\nratios for neutrinos and antineutrinos can be quite different as we do not know\nhow they are produced in the astrophysical environment. Due to this uncertainty\nthe neutrino and antineutrino flavor ratios at the Earth also could be quite\ndifferent. Nonetheless, it is generally assumed that flavor ratios for\nneutrinos and antineutrinos are the same at the Earth, in fitting the high\nenergy astrophysical neutrino data. This is a reasonable assumption for the\nlimited statistics for the data we currently have. However, in the future the\nfit must be performed allowing for a possible discrepancy in these two\nfractions in order to be able to disentangle different production mechanisms at\nthe source from new physics in the neutrino sector. To reinforce this issue, in\nthis work we show that a wrong assumption about the distribution of neutrino\nflavor ratios at the Earth may indeed lead to misleading interpretations of\nIceCube results.\n", "  We report our analysis of the Fermi Large Area Telescope data for 39\nmillisecond pulsars (MSPs) listed in the second $\\gamma$-ray pulsar catalog.\nSpectra of the pulsars are obtained. We fit the spectra with a function of a\npower law with exponential cutoff, and find the best-fit parameters of photon\nindex $\\Gamma = 1.54^{+0.10}_{-0.11}$ and cutoff energy $E_{c} =\n3.70^{+0.95}_{-0.70}$ GeV. This spectral shape, which includes the intrinsic\ndifferences in the spectra of the MSPs, can be used for finding candidate MSPs\nand unidentified types of sources detected by Fermi at high Galactic latitudes.\nIn one of the MSPs PSR J0614-3329, we find significant pulsed emission upto 200\nGeV. The result has thus added this MSP to the group of the Crab and Vela\npulsars that have been detected with >50 GeV pulsed emission. Comparing the\n$\\gamma$-ray spectrum of PSR J0614-3329 with those of the Crab and Vela\npulsars, we discuss possible emission mechanisms for the very high-energy\ncomponent.\n", "  By analyzing 2.93 fb$^{-1}$ data collected at the center-of-mass energy\n$\\sqrt s=3.773$ GeV with the BESIII detector, we measure the absolute branching\nfraction of the semileptonic decay $D^+\\rightarrow\\bar K^0 e^{+}\\nu_{e}$ to be\n${\\mathcal B}(D^{+}\\rightarrow\\bar K^0 e^{+}\\nu_{e})=(8.59 \\pm 0.14 \\pm\n0.21)\\%$ using $\\bar K^0\\to K^0_S\\to \\pi^0\\pi^0$, where the first uncertainty\nis statistical and the second systematic. Our result is consistent with\nprevious measurements within uncertainties.\n", "  We investigate a quantum repeater scheme for quantum key distribution based\non the work by Muralidharan et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 250501 (2014). Our\nscheme extends that work by making use of error syndrome measurement outcomes\navailable at the repeater stations. We show how to calculate the secret key\nrates for the case of optimizing the syndrome information, while the known key\nrate is based on a scenario of coarse-graining the syndrome information. We\nshow that these key rates can surpass the Pirandola-Laurenza-Ottaviani-Banchi\nbound on secret key rates of direct transmission over lossy bosonic channels.\n", "  In this work we discuss observational aspects of three time-dependent\nparameterisations of the dark energy equation of state $w(z)$. In order to\ndetermine the dynamics associated with these models, we calculate their\nbackground evolution and perturbations in a scalar field representation. After\nperforming a complete treatment of linear perturbations, we also show that the\nnon-linear contribution of the selected $w(z)$ parameterisations to the matter\npower spectra is almost the same for all scales, with no significant difference\nfrom the predictions of the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model.\n", "  In a previous work [Dillon and Nakanishi, Eur.Phys.J B 87, 286 (2014)], we\nnumerically calculated the transmission coefficient of the two-dimensional\nquantum percolation problem and mapped out in detail the three regimes of\nlocalization, i.e., exponentially localized, power-law localized, and\ndelocalized which had been proposed earlier [Islam and Nakanishi, Phys.Rev. E\n77, 061109 (2008)]. We now consider a variation on quantum percolation in which\nthe hopping integral ($w$) associated with bonds that connect to at least one\ndiluted site is not zero, but rather a fraction of the hopping integral (V=1)\nbetween non-diluted sites. We study the latter model by calculating quantities\nsuch as the transmission coefficient and the inverse participation ratio and\nfind the original quantum percolation results to be stable for $w>0$ over a\nwide range of energy. In particular, except in the immediate neighborhood of\nthe band center (where increasing $w$ to just $0.02*V$appears to eliminate\nlocalization effects), increasing $w$ only shifts the boundaries between the 3\nregimes but does not eliminate them until $w$ reaches 10%-40% of $V$.\n", "  We introduce a real-space technique able to extend the standard Hopfield\napproach commonly used in quantum polaritonics to the case of inhomogeneous\nlossless materials interacting with the electromagnetic field. We derive the\ncreation and annihilation polaritonic operators for the system normal modes as\nlinear, space-dependent superpositions of the microscopic light and matter\nfields, and we invert the Hopfield transformation expressing the microscopic\nfields as functions of the polaritonic operators. As an example, we apply our\napproach to the case of a planar interface between vacuum and a polar\ndielectric, showing how we can consistently treat both propagative and surface\nmodes, and express their nonlinear interactions, arising from phonon\nanharmonicity, as polaritonic scattering terms. We also show that our theory\ncan be naturally extended to the case of dissipative materials.\n", "  We present a kinematic catalogue for 21 M51-type galaxies. It consists of\nradial velocity distributions observed with long slit spectroscopy along\ndifferent position angles, for both the main and satellite components. We\ndetect deviations from circular motion in most of the main galaxies of each\npair, due to the gravitational perturbation produced by the satellite galaxy.\nHowever some systems do not show significant distortions in their radial\nvelocity curves. We found some differences between the directions of the\nphotometric and kinematic major axes in the main galaxies with a bar subsystem.\nThe Tully-Fisher relation in the B-band and Ks-band for the present sample of\nM51-type systems is flatter when compared with isolated galaxies. Using the\nradial velocity data set, we built a synthetic normalized radial velocity\ndistribution, as a reference for future modeling of these peculiar systems. The\nsynthetic rotation curve, representing the typical rotation curve of the main\ngalaxy in an M51-type pair, is near to solid body-like inside 4 kpc, and then\nis nearly flat within the radial range 5-15 kpc. The relative position angles\nbetween the main galaxy major axis and the companion location, as well as the\nvelocity difference amplitude, indicate that the orbital motion of the\nsatellite has a large projection on the main galaxy equatorial plane. In\naddition, the radial velocity differences between the two galaxies indicate\nthat the satellite orbital motion is within the range of amplitudes of the main\ngalaxy rotation curve and all the M51-type systems studied here except for one,\nare gravitationally bounded.\n", "  Recently, a novel idea has been proposed to relax the electroweak hierarchy\nproblem through the cosmological inflation and the axion periodic potential.\nHere, we further assume that only the attractive inflation is needed to explain\nthe light mass of the Higgs boson, where we do not need a specified periodic\npotential of the axion field. Attractive inflation during the early universe\ndrives the Higgs boson mass from the large value in the early universe to the\nsmall value at present, where the Higgs mass is an evolving parameter of the\nUniverse. Thus, the small Higgs mass can technically originate from the\ncosmological evolution rather than dynamical symmetry or anthropics. Further,\nwe study the possible collider signals or constraints at future lepton collier\nand the possible constraints from the muon anomalous magnetic moment. A\nconcrete attractive relaxion model is also discussed, which is consistent with\nthe data of Planck 2015.\n", "  Markov State Modeling has recently emerged as a key technique for analyzing\nrare events in thermal equilibrium molecular simulations and finding metastable\nstates. Here we export this technique to the study of friction, where strongly\nnon-equilibrium events are induced by an external force. The approach is\nbenchmarked on the well-studied Frenkel-Kontorova model, where we demonstrate\nthe unprejudiced identification of the minimal basis microscopic states\nnecessary for describing sliding, stick-slip and dissipation. The steps\nnecessary for the application to realistic frictional systems are highlighted.\n", "  Fermions become polarized in a vortical fluid due to spin-vorticity coupling.\nThe spin polarization density is proportional to the local fluid vorticity at\nthe next-to-leading order of a gradient expansion in a quantum kinetic theory.\nSpin correlations of two $\\Lambda$-hyperons can therefore reveal the vortical\nstructure of the dense matter in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. We employ a\n(3+1)D viscous hydrodynamic model with event-by-event fluctuating initial\nconditions from A MultiPhase Transport (AMPT) model to calculate the vorticity\ndistributions and $\\Lambda$ spin correlations. The azimuthal correlation of the\ntransverse spin is shown to have a cosine form plus an offset due to a circular\nstructure of the transverse vorticity around the beam direction and global spin\npolarization. The longitudinal spin correlation shows a structure of\nvortex-pairing in the transverse plane due to the convective flow of hot spots\nin the radial direction. The dependence on colliding energy, rapidity,\ncentrality and sensitivity to the shear viscosity are also investigated.\n", "  Flexocoupling impact on the size effects of the spontaneous polarization,\neffective piezo-response, elastic strain and compliance, carrier concentration\nand piezo-conductance have been calculated in thin films of ferroelectric\nsemiconductors with mixed-type conductivity under applied pressure. Analysis of\nthe self-consistent calculation results revealed that the thickness dependences\nof aforementioned physical quantities, calculated at zero and nonzero\nflexoelectric couplings, are very similar under zero applied pressure, but\nbecome strongly different under the application of external pressure pext. At\nthat the differences become noticeably stronger for the film surface under\ncompression than under tension. The impact of the Vegard mechanism on the size\neffects is weaker in comparison with flexocoupling except for the thickness\ndependence of the piezo-conductance. Without flexoelectric coupling the studied\nphysical quantities manifest conventional peculiarities that are characteristic\nof the size-induced phase transitions. Namely, when the film thickness h\napproaches the critical thickness hcr the transition to paraelectric phase\noccurs. The combined effect of flexoelectric coupling and external pressure\ninduces polarizations at the film surfaces, which cause the electric built-in\nfield that destroys the thickness-induced phase transition to paraelectric\nphase at h= hcr and induces the electret-like state with irreversible\nspontaneous polarization at h<hcr. The built-in field leads to noticeable\nincrease of the average strain and elastic compliance under the film thickness\ndecrease below hcr that scales as 1/h at small thicknesses h. The changes of\nthe electron concentration by several orders of magnitude under positive or\nnegative pressures can lead to the occurrence of high- or low-conductivity\nstates, i.e. the nonvolatile piezo-resistive switching.\n", "  Fractional Brownian motion is a self-affine, non-Markovian and\ntranslationally invariant generalization of Brownian motion, depending on the\nHurst exponent $H$. Here we investigate fractional Brownian motion where both\nthe starting and the end point are zero, commonly referred to as bridge\nprocesses. Observables are the time $t_+$ the process is positive, the maximum\n$m$ it achieves, and the time $t_{\\rm max}$ when this maximum is taken. Using a\nperturbative expansion around Brownian motion ($H=\\frac12$), we give the\nfirst-order result for the probability distribution of these three variables,\nand the joint distribution of $m$ and $t_{\\rm max}$. Our analytical results are\ntested, and found in excellent agreement, with extensive numerical simulations,\nboth for $H>\\frac12$ and $H<\\frac12$. This precision is achieved by sampling\nprocesses with a free endpoint, and then converting each realization to a\nbridge process, in generalization to what is usually done for Brownian motion.\n", "  The response of spatially extended systems to a force leading their steady\nstate out of equilibrium is strongly affected by the presence of disorder. We\nfocus on the mean velocity induced by a constant force applied on\none-dimensional interfaces. In the absence of disorder, the velocity is linear\nin the force. In the presence of disorder, it is widely admitted, as well as\nexperimentally and numerically verified, that the velocity presents a stretched\nexponential dependence in the force (the so-called 'creep law'), which is out\nof reach of linear response, or more generically of direct perturbative\nexpansions at small force. In dimension one, there is no exact analytical\nderivation of such a law, even from a theoretical physical point of view. We\npropose an effective model with two degrees of freedom, constructed from the\nfull spatially extended model, that captures many aspects of the creep\nphenomenology. It provides a justification of the creep law form of the\nvelocity-force characteristics, in a quasistatic approximation. It allows,\nmoreover, to capture the non-trivial effects of short-range correlations in the\ndisorder, which govern the low-temperature asymptotics. It enables us to\nestablish a phase diagram where the creep law manifests itself in the vicinity\nof the origin in the force--system-size--temperature coordinates. Conjointly,\nwe characterise the crossover between the creep regime and a linear-response\nregime that arises due to finite system size.\n", "  This study entails the fourth part of a global flare energetics project, in\nwhich the mass $m_{\\mathrm{cme}}$, kinetic energy $E_{\\mathrm{kin}}$, and the\ngravitational potential energy $E_{\\mathrm{grav}}$ of coronal mass ejections\n(CMEs) is measured in 399 M and X-class flare events observed during the first\n3.5 yrs of the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) mission, using a new method\nbased on the EUV dimming effect. The EUV dimming is modeled in terms of a\nradial adiabatic expansion process, which is fitted to the observed evolution\nof the total emission measure of the CME source region. The model derives the\nevolution of the mean electron density, the emission measure, the bulk plasma\nexpansion velocity, the mass, and the energy in the CME source region. The EUV\ndimming method is truly complementary to the Thomson scattering method in white\nlight, which probes the CME evolution in the heliosphere at $r > 2 R_{\\odot}$,\nwhile the EUV dimming method tracks the CME launch in the corona. We compare\nthe CME parameters obtained in white light with the LASCO/C2 coronagraph with\nthose obtained from EUV dimming with the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA)\nonboard SDO for all identical events in both data sets. We investigate\ncorrelations between CME parameters, the relative timing with flare parameters,\nfrequency occurrence distributions, and the energy partition between magnetic,\nthermal, nonthermal, and CME energies. CME energies are found to be\nsystematically lower than the dissipated magnetic energies, which is consistent\nwith a magnetic origin of CMEs.\n", "  We derive the asymptotic solutions for vacuum spacetimes with non-zero\ncosmological constant $\\Lambda$, using the Newman-Penrose formalism. Our\napproach is based exclusively on the physical spacetime, i.e. we do not\nexplicitly deal with conformal rescaling nor the conformal spacetime. By\ninvestigating the Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime in spherical coordinates,\nwe subsequently stipulate the fall-offs of the null tetrad and spin\ncoefficients for asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes such that the terms which\nwould give rise to the Bondi mass-loss due to energy carried by gravitational\nradiation (i.e. involving $\\sigma^o$) must be non-zero. After solving the\nvacuum Newman-Penrose equations asymptotically, we propose a generalisation to\nthe Bondi mass involving $\\Lambda$ and obtain a positive-definite mass-loss\nformula by integrating the Bianchi identity involving $D'\\Psi_2$ over a compact\n2-surface on $\\mathcal{I}$. Whilst our original intention was to study\nasymptotically de Sitter spacetimes, the use of spherical coordinates implies\nthat this readily applies for $\\Lambda<0$, and yields exactly the known\nasymptotically flat spacetimes when $\\Lambda=0$. In other words, our asymptotic\nvacuum solutions with $\\Lambda\\neq0$ reduce smoothly to those where\n$\\Lambda=0$, in spite of the distinct characters of $\\mathcal{I}$ being\nspacelike, timelike and null for de Sitter, anti-de Sitter and Minkowski,\nrespectively. Unlike for $\\Lambda=0$ where no incoming radiation corresponds to\nsetting $\\Psi^o_0=0$ on some initial null hypersurface, for $\\Lambda\\neq0$, no\nincoming radiation requires $\\Psi^o_0=0$ everywhere.\n", "  We present photometry and spectroscopy of PS1-14bj, a hydrogen-poor\nsuperluminous supernova (SLSN) at redshift $z=0.5215$ discovered in the last\nmonths of the Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey. PS1-14bj stands out by its\nextremely slow evolution, with an observed rise of $\\gtrsim 125$ rest-frame\ndays, and exponential decline out to $\\sim 250$ days past peak at a measured\nrate of $0.01~{\\rm mag~day}^{-1}$, consistent with fully-trapped $^{56}$Co\ndecay. This is the longest rise time measured in a SLSN to date, and the first\nSLSN to show a rise time consistent with pair-instability supernova (PISN)\nmodels. Compared to other slowly-evolving SLSNe, it is spectroscopically\nsimilar to the prototype SN2007bi at maximum light, though lower in luminosity\n($L_{\\rm peak} \\simeq 4.6 \\times 10^{43} {\\rm erg s}^{-1}$) and with a flatter\npeak than previous events. PS1-14bj shows a number of peculiar properties,\nincluding a near-constant color temperature for $>200$ days past peak, and\nstrong emission lines from [O III] $\\lambda$5007 and [O III] $\\lambda$4363 with\na velocity width of $\\sim$3400 km/s, in its late-time spectra. These both\nsuggest there is a sustained source of heating over very long timescales, and\nare incompatible with a simple $^{56}$Ni-powered/PISN interpretation. A\nmodified magnetar model including emission leakage at late times can reproduce\nthe light curve, in which case the blue continuum and [O III] features are\ninterpreted as material heated and ionized by the inner pulsar wind nebula\nbecoming visible at late times. Alternatively, the late-time heating could be\ndue to interaction with a shell of H-poor circumstellar material.\n", "  In this paper we propose a Monte Carlo method for generating finite-domain\nmarginals of critical distributions of statistical models in infinite volume.\nThe algorithm corrects the problem of the long-range effects of boundaries\nassociated to generating critical distributions on finite lattices. It uses the\nadvantage of scale invariance combined with ideas of the renormalization group\nin order to construct a type of \"holographic\" boundary condition that encodes\nthe presence of an infinite volume beyond it. We check the quality of the\ndistribution obtained in the case of the planar Ising model by comparing\nvarious observables with their infinite-plane prediction. We accurately\nreproduce planar two-, three- and four-point functions of spin and energy\noperators. We also define a lattice stress-energy tensor, and numerically\nobtain the associated conformal Ward identities and the Ising central charge.\n", "  NGC 5128 (Centaurus A) is one of the best example to study AGN-feedback in\nthe local Universe. At 13.5 kpc from the galaxy, optical filaments with recent\nstar formation are lying along the radio-jet direction. We used the Atacama\nPathfinder EXperiment (APEX) to map the CO(2-1) emission all along the\nfilaments structure. Molecular gas mass of 8.2x10^7 Msun was found over the 4.2\nkpc-structure which represents about 3% of the total gas mass of the NGC 5128\ncold gas content. Two dusty mostly molecular structures are identified,\nfollowing the optical filaments. The region corresponds to the crossing of the\nradio jet with the northern HI shell, coming from a past galaxy merger. One\nfilament is located at the border of the HI shell, while the other is entirely\nmolecular, and devoid of HI gas. The molecular mass is comparable to the HI\nmass in the shell, suggesting a scenario where the atomic gas was shocked and\ntransformed in molecular clouds by the radio jet. Comparison with combined FIR\nHerschel and UV GALEX estimation of star formation rates in the same regions\nleads to depletion times of more than 10 Gyr. The filaments are thus less\nefficient than discs in converting molecular gas into stars. Kinetic energy\ninjection triggered by shocks all along the jet/gas interface is a possible\nprocess that appears to be consistent with MUSE line ratio diagnostics derived\nin a smaller region of the northern filaments. Whether the AGN is the sole\norigin of this energy input and what is the dominant (mechanical vs radiative)\nmode for this process is however still to be investigated.\n", "  Transient four-wave mixing studies of bulk GaAs under conditions of broad\nbandwidth excitation of primarily interband transitions have enabled\nfour-particle correlations tied to degenerate (exciton-exciton) and\nnondegenerate (exciton-carrier) interactions to be studied. Real\ntwo-dimensional Fourier-transform spectroscopy (2DFTS) spectra reveal a complex\nresponse at the heavy-hole exciton emission energy that varies with the\nabsorption energy, ranging from dispersive on the diagonal, through absorptive\nfor low-energy interband transitions to dispersive with the opposite sign for\ninterband transitions high above band gap. Simulations using a multilevel model\naugmented by many-body effects provide excellent agreement with the 2DFTS\nexperiments and indicate that excitation-induced dephasing (EID) and\nexcitation-induced shift (EIS) affect degenerate and nondegenerate interactions\nequivalently, with stronger exciton-carrier coupling relative to\nexciton-exciton coupling by approximately an order of magnitude. These\nsimulations also indicate that EID effects are three times stronger than EIS in\ncontributing to the coherent response of the semiconductor.\n", "  Galaxies at high redshifts provide a valuable tool to study cosmic dawn, and\ntherefore it is crucial to reliably identify these galaxies. Here, we present\nan unambiguous and first simultaneous detection of both the Lyman-alpha\nemission and the Lyman break from a z = 7.512+/- 0.004 galaxy, observed in the\nFaint Infrared Grism Survey (FIGS). These spectra, taken with G102 grism on\nHubble Space Telescope (HST), show a significant emission line detection (6\nsigma) in multiple observational position angles (PA), with total integrated\nLy{\\alpha} line flux of 1.06+/- 0.12 e10-17erg s-1cm-2. The line flux is nearly\na factor of four higher than the previous MOSFIRE spectroscopic observations of\nfaint Ly{\\alpha} emission at {\\lambda} = 1.0347{\\mu}m, yielding z = 7.5078+/-\n0.0004. This is consistent with other recent observations implying that\nground-based near-infrared spectroscopy underestimates total emission line\nfluxes, and if confirmed, can have strong implications for reionization studies\nthat are based on ground-based Lyman-{\\alpha} measurements. A 4-{\\sigma}\ndetection of the NV line in one PA also suggests a weak Active Galactic Nucleus\n(AGN), potentially making this source the highest-redshift AGN yet found. Thus,\nthis observation from the Hubble Space Telescope clearly demonstrates the\nsensitivity of the FIGS survey, and the capability of grism spectroscopy to\nstudy the epoch of reionization.\n", "  Pulsars traveling at supersonic speeds are often accompanied by cometary bow\nshocks seen in Halpha. We report on the first detection of a pulsar bow shock\nin the far-ultraviolet (FUV). We detected it in FUV images of the nearest\nmillisecond pulsar J0437-4715 obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope. The\nimages reveal a bow-like structure positionally coincident with part of the\npreviously detected Halpha bow shock, with an apex at 10\" ahead of the moving\npulsar. Its FUV luminosity, L(1250-2000 A) ~ 5x10^28 erg/s, exceeds the Halpha\nluminosity from the same area by a factor of 10. The FUV emission could be\nproduced by the shocked ISM matter or, less likely, by relativistic pulsar wind\nelectrons confined by strong magnetic field fluctuations in the bow shock. In\naddition, in the FUV images we found a puzzling extended (~3\" in size)\nstructure overlapping with the limb of the bow shock. If related to the bow\nshock, it could be produced by an inhomogeneity in the ambient medium or an\ninstability in the bow shock. We also report on a previously undetected X-ray\nemission extending for about 5\" ahead of the pulsar, possibly a pulsar wind\nnebula created by shocked pulsar wind, with a luminosity L(0.5-8 keV) ~ 3x10^28\nerg/s.\n", "  In this paper we calculate the nonlinear susceptibility and the resonant\nRaman cross section for the paramagnetic phase of the ferromagnetic Quantum\nIsing model in one dimension. In this region the spectrum of the Ising model\nhas a gap $m$. The Raman cross section has a strong singularity when the energy\nof the outgoing photon is at the spectral gap $\\omega_{f} \\approx m$ and a\nsquare root threshold when the frequency difference between the incident and\noutgoing photons $\\omega_{i} -\\omega_{f} \\approx 2m$. The latter feature\nreflects the fermionic nature of the Ising model excitations.\n", "  The geometrical and electronic properties of the monolayer (ML) of tetracene\n(Tc) molecules on Ag(111) are systematically investigated by means of DFT\ncalculations with the use of localized basis set. The bridge and hollow\nadsorption positions of the molecule in the commensurate $\\gamma$-Tc/Ag(111)\nare revealed to be the most stable and equally favorable irrespective to the\napproximation chosen for the exchange-correlation functional. The binding\nenergy is entirely determined by the long-range dispersive interaction. The\nformer lowest unoccupied orbital remains being unoccupied in the case of\n$\\gamma$-Tc/Ag(111) as well as in the $\\alpha$-phase with increased coverage.\nThe unit cell of the $\\alpha$-phase with point-on-line registry was adapted for\ncalculations based on the available experimental data and the computed\nstructures of the $\\gamma$-phase. The calculated position of the Tc/Ag(111)\ninterface state is found to be noticeably dependent on the lattice constant of\nthe substrate, however its energy shift with respect to the Shockley surface\nstate of the unperturbed clean side of the slab is sensitive only to the\nadsorption distance and in good agreement with the experimentally measured\nenergy shift.\n", "  Gravitational wave observations provide unique opportunities to search for\ncosmic strings. One of the strongest sources of gravitational waves is\ndiscontinuities of cosmic strings, called kinks, which are generated at points\nof intersection. Kinks on infinite strings are known to generate a\ngravitational wave background over a wide range of frequencies. In this paper,\nwe calculate the spectrum of the gravitational wave background by numerically\nsolving the evolution equation for the distribution function of the kink\nsharpness. We find that the number of kinks for small sharpness is larger than\nthe analytical estimate used in a previous work, which makes a difference in\nthe spectral shape. Our numerical approach also helps to avoid the use of\nanalytic approximations, and enables us to make a more precise prediction on\nthe spectral amplitude for future gravitational wave experiments.\n", "  Traditional Bell's argument shows that freedom of choice is inconsistent with\nquantum realism if lack of signaling and sufficiently fast choices and readouts\nare assumed. While no-signaling alone is a consequence of special relativity,\nthis is not the case of spacetime location of choice and readout. Here we\nattempt to incorporate freedom of choice into quantum objective realism relying\nsolely on relativistic quantum field theory. We conclude that this is\nimpossible without breaking relativistic invariance and put forward the\npossibility of signaling faster than light, which cannot be excluded if an\nultimate theory violates relativity.\n", "  We have studied the transmission of transverse oscillations through a thin\nFermi liquid film, using Landau's Fermi liquid theory. Fermi liquid theory\ndescribes the dynamics of interacting, degenerate fermion systems, for example\nnon-superfluid, i.e.\\ normal state \\textsuperscript{3}He at millikelvin\ntemperatures. The response of a Fermi liquid to the transverse oscillations of\na planar substrate has previously been calculated for a fluid layer of infinite\nthickness. We have modified these calculations for application to a film of\nfinite thickness, either with a free surface, or as confined between two\nparallel substrates. The equations take into account contributions to the\nacoustic impedance from both the collective transverse zero sound mode, as well\nas the incoherent single-quasiparticle excitations and are solved using\nnumerical methods.\n", "  An investigation in radio and infrared wavelengths of two high-mass star\nforming regions toward the southern Galactic bubble S10 is presented here. The\ntwo regions under study are associated with the broken bubble S10 and Extended\nGreen Object, G345.99-0.02, respectively. Radio continuum emission mapped at\n610 and 1280 MHz using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope, India is detected\ntowards both the regions. These regions are estimated to be ionized by early B\nto late O type stars. Spitzer GLIMPSE mid-infrared data is used to identify\nyoung stellar objects associated with these regions. A Class I/II type source,\nwith an estimated mass of 6.2 M{\\sun} , lies {\\sim} 7{\\arcsec} from the radio\npeak. Pixel-wise, modified blackbody fits to the thermal dust emission using\nHerschel far-infrared data is performed to construct dust temperature and\ncolumn density maps. Eight clumps are detected in the two regions using the 250\n{\\mu}m image. The masses and linear diameter of these range between {\\sim} 300\n- 1600 M{\\sun} and 0.2 - 1.1 pc, respectively which qualifies them as high-mass\nstar forming clumps. Modelling of the spectral energy distribution of these\nclumps indicates the presence of high luminosity, high accretion rate, massive\nyoung stellar objects possibly in the accelerating accretion phase. Further,\nbased on the radio and MIR morphology, the occurrence of a possible bow-wave\ntowards the likely ionizing star is explored.\n", "  We search the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Baryon Oscillation Sky Survey\nto identify ~5500 massive compact quiescent galaxy candidates at 0.2<z<0.8. We\nrobustly classify a subsample of 438 E+A galaxies based on their spectral\nproperties and make this catalog publicly available. We examine sizes, stellar\npopulation ages and kinematics of galaxies in the sample and show that the\nphysical properties of compact E+A galaxies suggest that they are a progenitor\nof massive compact quiescent galaxies. Thus, two classes of objects-compact E+A\nand compact quiescent galaxies-may be linked by a common formation scenario.\nThe typical stellar population age of compact E+A galaxies is <1 Gyr. The\nexistence of compact E+A galaxies with young stellar populations at 0.2<z<0.8\nmeans that some compact quiescent galaxies first appear at intermediate\nredshifts. We derive a lower limit for the number density of compact E+A\ngalaxies. Assuming passive evolution, we convert this number density into an\nappearance rate of new compact quiescent galaxies at 0.2<z<0.8. The lower limit\nnumber density of compact quiescent galaxies which may appear at z<0.8 is\ncomparable to the lower limit of the total number density of compact quiescent\ngalaxies at these intermediate redshifts. Thus, a substantial fraction of the\nz<0.8 massive compact quiescent galaxy population may descend from compact E+A\ngalaxies at intermediate redshifts.\n", "  Ultrafast optical heating of the electrons in ferrimagnetic metals can result\nin all-optical switching (AOS) of the magnetization. Here we report\nquantitative measurements of the temperature rise of GdFeCo thin films during\nhelicity-independent AOS. Critical switching fluences are obtained as a\nfunction of the initial temperature of the sample and for laser pulse durations\nfrom 55 fs to 15 ps. We conclude that non-equilibrium phenomena are necessary\nfor helicity-independent AOS, although the peak electron temperature does not\nplay a critical role. Pump-probe time-resolved experiments show that the\nswitching time increases as the pulse duration increases, with 10 ps pulses\nresulting in switching times of ~sim 13 ps. These results raise new questions\nabout the fundamental mechanism of helicity-independent AOS.\n", "  We report on the discovery and energy dependence of hard phase lags in the\n2.14 Hz pulsed profiles of GRO J1744-28. We used data from XMM-Newton and\nNuSTAR. We were able to well constrain the lag spectrum with respect to the\nsoftest (0.3--2.3 keV) band: the delay shows increasing lag values reaching a\nmaximum delay of $\\sim$ 12 ms, between 6 and 6.4 keV. After this maximum, the\nvalue of the hard lag drops to 7 ms, followed by a recovery to a plateau at 9\nms for energies above 8 keV. NuSTAR data confirm this trend up to 30 keV, but\nthe measurements are statistically poorer, and therefore, less constraining.\nThe lag-energy pattern up to the discontinuity is well described by a\nlogarithmic function. Assuming this is due to a Compton reverberation\nmechanism, we derive a size for the Compton cloud $R_{\\rm{cc}}$ $\\sim$ 120\n$R_{\\rm g}$, consistent with previous estimates on the magnetospheric radius.\nIn this scenario, the sharp discontinuity at $\\sim$ 6.5 keV appears difficult\nto interpret and suggests the possible influence of the reflected component in\nthis energy range. We therefore propose the possible coexistence of both\nCompton and disk reverberation to explain the scale of the lags and its energy\ndependence.\n", "  In view of the recent report by Connaughton we analyse continuous TTE data of\nFermi-GBM around the time of the gravitational wave event GW 150914. We find\nthat after proper accounting for low count statistics, the GBM transient event\nat 0.4 s after GW 150914 is likely not due to an astrophysical source, but\nconsistent with a background fluctuation, removing the tension between the\nINTEGRAL/ACS non-detection and GBM. Additionally, reanalysis of other short\nGRBs shows that without proper statistical modeling the fluence of faint events\nis over-predicted, as verified for some joint GBM-ACS detections of short GRBs.\nWe detail the statistical procedure to correct these biases. As a result, faint\nshort GRBs, verified by ACS detections, with significances in the broad-band\nlight curve even smaller than that of the GBM-GW150914 event are recovered as\nproper non-zero source, while the GBM-GW150914 event is consistent with zero\nfluence.\n", "  We study the spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) and the magnon spin transport\n(MST) in Pt/Y3Fe5O12(YIG)-based devices with intentionally modified interfaces.\nOur measurements show that the surface treatment of the YIG film results in a\nslight enhancement of the spin-mixing conductance and an extraordinary increase\nin the efficiency of the spin-to-magnon excitations at room temperature. The\nsurface of the YIG film develops a surface magnetic frustration at low\ntemperatures, causing a sign change of the SMR and a dramatic suppression of\nthe MST. Our results evidence that SMR and MST could be used to explore\nmagnetic properties of surfaces, including those with complex magnetic\ntextures, and stress the critical importance of the non-magnetic/ferromagnetic\ninterface properties in the performance of the resulting spintronic devices.\n", "  The phases and properties of matter under global rotation have attracted much\ninterest recently. In this paper we investigate the pairing phenomena in a\nsystem of fermions under the presence of rotation. We find that there is a\ngeneric suppression effect on pairing states with zero angular momentum. We\ndemonstrate this effect with the chiral condensation and the color\nsuperconductivity in hot dense QCD matter as explicit examples. In the case of\nchiral condensation, a new phase diagram in the temperature-rotation parameter\nspace is found, with a nontrivial critical point.\n", "  Some of the basic concepts of topology are explored through known physics\nproblems. This helps us in two ways, one, in motivating the definitions and the\nconcepts, and two, in showing that topological analysis leads to a clearer\nunderstanding of the problem. The problems discussed are taken from classical\nmechanics, quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, solid state physics, and\nbiology (DNA), to emphasize some unity in diverse areas of physics. It is the\nreal Euclidean space, $R^d$, with which we are most familiar. Intuitions can\ntherefore be sharpened by appealing to the relevant features of this known\nspace, and by using these as simplest examples to illustrate the abstract\ntopological concepts. This is what is done in this chapter.\n", "  This study is focused on the possibility to extend the use of the first-order\nreversal curve (FORC) diagram method to rate-dependent hysteresis. The FORCs\nfor an amorphous magnetic wire was measured with an inductometric experimental\nsetup in which the field-rate was maintained constant. The FORC experiment was\nperformed for four different field-rates. As it is known, to obtain\nquantitative information on the magnetization process during the FORC process\nwe need a model able to simulate as close as possible the experimental FORC\ndiagrams. In this case, we have developed and implemented a model based on the\nhypothesis that the magnetization processes in this kind of materials are\nmainly due to the movement of a domain wall between the central domains of the\nwire. The differential equation of the domain wall movement is able to give a\nremarkably accurate description of the experimental FORC diagrams. The\nexperimental FORCs, the FORC susceptibility diagram and the classical FORC\ndiagram show however a number of details that the model is not able to\ndescribe. In each such case one discuss the possible physical cause of the\nobserved behavior. As the magnetic wires are analyzed in many laboratories\naround the world for a wide variety of applications (essentially involving the\ncontrol of the domain wall movement) we consider that our study offers to these\nresearchers a valuable new tool.\n", "  The interaction of cosmic rays with the gas contained in our Galaxy is a\nguaranteed source of diffuse high energy neutrinos. We provide expectations for\nthis component by considering different assumptions for the cosmic ray\ndistribution in the Galaxy which are intended to cover the large uncertainty in\ncosmic ray propagation models. We calculate the angular dependence of the\ndiffuse galactic neutrino flux and the corresponding rate of High Energy\nStarting Events in IceCube by including the effect of detector angular\nresolution. Moreover we discuss the possibility to discriminate the galactic\ncomponent from an isotropic astrophysical flux. We show that a statistically\nsignificant excess of events from the galactic plane in present IceCube data\nwould favour models in which the cosmic ray density in the inner galactic\nregion is much larger than its local value, thus bringing relevant information\non the cosmic ray radial distribution.\n", "  We pioneer a systematic, large-scale lattice simulation of D0-brane quantum\nmechanics. The large-$N$ and continuum limits of the gauge theory are taken for\nthe first time at various temperatures $0.4 \\leq T \\leq 1.0$. As a way to\ndirectly test the gauge/gravity duality conjecture we compute the internal\nenergy of the black hole directly from the gauge theory and reproduce the\ncoefficient of the supergravity result $E/N^2=7.41T^{14/5}$. This is the first\nconfirmation of the supergravity prediction for the internal energy of a black\nhole at finite temperature coming directly from the dual gauge theory. We also\nconstrain stringy corrections to the internal energy.\n", "  Model atmospheres of the close visual binary star COU1511 (HIP12552) are\nconstructed using grids of Kuruz's blanketed models to build the individual\nsynthetic SEDs for both components. These synthetic SED's are combined together\nfor the entire system and compared with the observational one following\nAl-Wardat's complex method for analyzing close visual binary stars. The entire\nobservational spectral energy distribution (SED) of the system is used as a\nreference for comparison between synthetic SED and the observed one. The\nparameters of both components are derived as: $T_{\\rm eff}^{a} =6180\\pm50 $\\,K,\n$T_{\\rm eff}^{b} =5865\\pm70$\\,K, log $g_{a}=4.35\\pm0.12$, log\n$g_{b}=4.45\\pm0.14$, $R_{a}=1.262\\pm0.08R_\\odot$, $R_{b}=1.006\\pm0.07R_\\odot$,\n$L_a=2.09\\pm0.10 L_\\odot$, $L_b=1.08\\pm0.12L_\\odot$, with spectral types F8 and\nG1 for both components (a,b) respectively, and age of $3.0\\pm 0.9$ Gy. A\nmodified orbit of the system is built and the masses of the two components are\ncalculated as $M_a=1.17\\pm0.11M_\\odot$, $M_b=1.06\\pm0.10M_\\odot$.\n", "  Quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAH) is induced by substitution of a certain\nportion, x, of Bi atoms in a BiTe-based insulating parent compound by magnetic\nions (Cr or V). We find the density of in-gap states, N(E), emerging as a\nresult of statistic fluctuations of the composition, x, in the vicinity of the\ntransition point, where the average gap, E_g, passes through zero. Local gap\nfollows the fluctuations of x. Using the instanton approach, we show that, near\nthe gap edges, the tails are exponential, ln N(E) \\propto -(E_g-|E|), and the\ntail states are due to small gap reduction. Our main finding is that, even when\nthe smearing magnitude exceeds the gap-width, there exists are semi-hard gap\naround zero energy, where ln N(E) \\propto -E_g/|E| (ln E_g/|E|). The states\nresponsible for N(E) originate from local gap reversals within narrow rings.\nThe consequence of semi-hard gap is the Arrhenius, rather than variable-range\nhopping, temperature dependence of the diagonal conductivity at low\ntemperatures.\n", "  We model the broad emission lines present in the optical, UV and X-ray\nspectra of Mrk 509, a bright type 1 Seyfert galaxy. The broad lines were\nsimultaneously observed during a large multiwavelength campaign, using the\nXMM-Newton-OM for the optical lines, HST-COS for the UV lines and\nXMM-Newton-RGS and Epic for the X-ray lines respectively. We also used FUSE\narchival data for the broad lines observed in the far-ultra-violet. The goal is\nto find a physical connection among the lines measured at different wavelengths\nand determine the size and the distance from the central source of the emitting\ngas components. We used the \"Locally optimally emission Cloud\" (LOC) model\nwhich interprets the emissivity of the broad line region (BLR) as regulated by\npowerlaw distributions of both gas density and distances from the central\nsource. We find that one LOC component cannot model all the lines\nsimultaneously. In particular, we find that the X-ray and UV lines likely may\noriginate in the more internal part of the AGN, at radii in the range\n~5x10^{14}-3x10^{17} cm, while the optical lines and part of the UV lines may\nlikely be originating further out, at radii ~3x10^{17}-3x^{18} cm. These two\ngas components are parametrized by a radial distribution of the luminosities\nwith a slope gamma of ~1.15 and ~1.10, respectively, both of them covering at\nleast 60% of the source. This simple parameterization points to a structured\nbroad line region, with the higher ionized emission coming from closer in,\nwhile the emission of the low-ionization lines is more concentrated in the\noutskirts of the broad line region.\n", "  Quantum key distribution (QKD) can provide unconditional secure communication\nbetween two distant parties. Although the significance of QKD is undisputed,\nits feasibility has been questioned because of certain limitations in the\npractical application of real-life QKD systems. It is a common belief the lack\nof perfect single-photon source and the existence of detection loss will\nhandicap the feasibility of QKD by creating security loopholes and distance\nlimitations. The measurement device independent QKD (MDIQKD) with decoy-state\nmethod removes the security threats from both the imperfect single-photon\nsource and the detection loss. Lengthening the distance and improving the key\nrate of QKD with such a superior method is thus the central issue in the\npractical application of QKD. Here, we report the results of MDIQKD over 404 km\nof ultralow-loss optical fibre and 311 km of standard optical fibre by\nemploying an optimized four-intensity decoy-state method. This record-breaking\nimplementation of MDIQKD method not only provides a new distance record for\nboth MDIQKD and all types of QKD systems, more significantly, it achieves a\ndistance that the traditional BB84 QKD would not be able to achieve with the\nsame detection devices even with ideal single-phone sources. For the first\ntime, our work demonstrates that with the MDIQKD method, imperfect devices can\nachieve better results than what ideal sources could have achieved. This work\nrepresents a significant step towards proving and developing a feasible\nlong-distance QKD.\n", "  We study the properties of edge plasmons in two-component electron liquids in\nthe presence of pseudomagnetic fields, which have opposite signs for the two\ndifferent electronic populations and therefore preserve the time-reversal\nsymmetry. The physical realizations of such systems are many. We discuss the\ncases of strained graphene and of electrons in proximity to a Skyrmion lattice,\nsolving the problem with the Wiener-Hopf technique. We show (i) that two\ncharged counter-propagating acoustic edge modes exist at the boundary and (ii)\nthat, in the limit of large pseudomagnetic fields, each of them involves\noscillations of only one of the two electronic components. We suggest that the\nedge pseudo-magnetoplasmons of graphene can be used to selectively address the\nelectrons of one specific valley, a feature relevant for the emerging field of\nvalleytronics. Conversely, the spin-polarized plasmons at the boundary of\nSkyrmion lattices can be exploited for spintronics applications. Our solution\nhighlights new features missing in previous (similar) results obtained with\nuncontrolled approximations, namely a logarithmic divergence of the plasmon\nvelocity, and the absence of gapped edge modes inside the bulk-plasmon gap.\n", "  The cloud-scale density, velocity dispersion, and gravitational boundedness\nof the interstellar medium (ISM) vary within and among galaxies. In turbulent\nmodels, these properties play key roles in the ability of gas to form stars.\nNew high fidelity, high resolution surveys offer the prospect to measure these\nquantities across galaxies. We present a simple approach to make such\nmeasurements and to test hypotheses that link small-scale gas structure to star\nformation and galactic environment. Our calculations capture the key physics of\nthe Larson scaling relations, and we show good correspondence between our\napproach and a traditional \"cloud properties\" treatment. However, we argue that\nour method is preferable in many cases because of its simple, reproducible\ncharacterization of all emission. Using, low-J 12CO data from recent surveys,\nwe characterize the molecular ISM at 60pc resolution in the Antennae, the Large\nMagellanic Cloud, M31, M33, M51, and M74. We report the distributions of\nsurface density, velocity dispersion, and gravitational boundedness at 60pc\nscales and show galaxy-to-galaxy and intra-galaxy variations in each. The\ndistribution of flux as a function of surface density appears roughly lognormal\nwith a 1sigma width of ~0.3 dex, though the center of this distribution varies\nfrom galaxy to galaxy. The 60pc resolution line width and molecular gas surface\ndensity correlate well, which is a fundamental behavior expected for virialized\nor free-falling gas. Varying the measurement scale for the LMC and M31, we show\nthat the molecular ISM has higher surface densities, lower line widths, and\nmore self-gravity at smaller scales.\n", "  In this work, we present a method for implementing the $\\delta N$ formalism\nto study the primordial non-Gaussianity produced in multiple three-form field\ninflation. Using a dual description relating three-form fields to noncanonical\nscalar fields, and employing existing results, we produce expressions for the\nbispectrum of the curvature perturbation in terms of three-form quantities. We\nstudy the bispectrum generated in a two three-form field inflationary scenario\nfor a particular potential that for suitable values of the parameters was found\nin earlier work to give values of the spectral index and ratio of tensor to\nscalar perturbations compatible with current bounds. We calculate the reduced\nbispectrum for this model, finding an amplitude in equilateral and orthogonal\nconfigurations of ${\\cal O}(1)$ and in the squeezed limit of ${\\cal\nO}(10^{-3})$. We confirm, therefore, that this three-form inflationary scenario\nis compatible with present observational constraints.\n", "  The low-temperature electronic state of the layered organic charge-transfer\nsalt $\\kappa$-(BETS)$_2$FeCl$_4$ was probed by interlayer electrical resistance\nmeasurements under magnetic field. Both above and below\n$T_{\\mathrm{N}}=0.47\\,$K, the temperature of antiferromagnetic ordering of\n$3d$-electron spins of Fe$^{3+}$ localized in the insulating anion layers, a\nnon-saturating linear $R(T)$ dependence has been observed. A weak\nsuperconducting signal has been detected in the antiferromagnetic state, at\ntemperatures $\\leq 0.2\\,$K. Despite the very high crystal quality, only a tiny\nfraction of the sample appears to be superconducting. Besides a small kink\nfeature in the resistivity, the impact of the antiferromagnetic ordering of\nlocalized Fe$^{3+}$ spins on the conduction $\\pi$-electron system is clearly\nmanifested in the Fermi surface reconstruction, as evidenced by Shubnikov-de\nHaas oscillations. The \"magnetic field -- temperature\" phase diagrams for the\nfield directions parallel to each of the three principal crystal axes have been\ndetermined. For magnetic field along the easy axis a spin-flop transition has\nbeen found. Similarities and differences between the present material and the\nsister compound $\\kappa$-(BETS)$_2$FeBr$_4$ are discussed.\n", "  Potentially habitable planets within the habitable zone of M-dwarfs are\naffected by tidal interaction. We studied the tidal evolution in GJ 667C using\na numerical code we call TIDEV. We reviewed the problem of the dynamical\nevolution focusing on the effects that a rheological treatment, different\ncompositions and the inclusion of orbital perturbations, have on the spin-down\ntime and the probability to be trapped in a low spin-orbit resonance.\nComposition have a strong effect on the spin-down time, changing, in some\ncases, by almost a factor of 2 with respect to the value estimated for a\nreference Earth-like model. We calculated the time to reach a low resonance\nvalue (3:2) for the configuration of 6 planets. Capture probabilities are\naffected when assuming different compositions and eccentricities variations. We\nchose planets b and c to evaluate the probabilities of capture in resonances\nbelow 5:2 for two compositions: Earth-like and Waterworld planets. We found\nthat perturbations, although having a secular effect on eccentricities, have a\nlow impact on capture probabilities and noth- ing on spin-down times. The\nimplications of the eccentricity variations and actual habitability of the GJ\n667C system are discussed.\n", "  We express the positive partial transpose (PPT) separability criterion for\nsymmetric states of multi-qubit systems in terms of matrix inequalities based\non the recently introduced tensor representation for spin states. We construct\na matrix from the tensor representation of the state and show that it is\nsimilar to the partial transpose of the density matrix written in the\ncomputational basis. Furthermore, the positivity of this matrix is equivalent\nto the positivity of a correlation matrix constructed from tensor products of\nPauli operators. This allows for a more transparent experimental interpretation\nof the PPT criteria for an arbitrary spin-j state. The unitary matrices\nconnecting our matrix to the partial transpose of the state generalize the\nso-called magic basis that plays a central role in Wootters' explicit formula\nfor the concurrence of a 2-qubit system and the Bell bases used for the\nteleportation of a one or two-qubit state.\n", "  We show how quasi-one-dimensional correlated insulating states arise at\ntwo-thirds filling in organometallic multinuclear coordination complexes\ndescribed by layered decorated honeycomb lattices. The interplay of spin-orbit\ncoupling and electronic correlations leads to pseudospin-1 moments arranged in\nweakly coupled chains with highly anisotropic exchange and a large trigonal\nsplitting. This leads to a quantum phase transition from a Haldane phase to a\ntopologically trivial phase as the relative strength of the spin-orbit coupling\nincreases.\n", "  Large field inflation is arguably the simplest and most natural variant of\nslow-roll inflation. Axion monodromy may be the most promising framework for\nrealising this scenario. As one of its defining features, the long-range\npolynomial potential possesses short-range, instantonic modulations. These can\ngive rise to a series of local minima in the post-inflationary region of the\npotential. We show that for certain parameter choices the inflaton populates\nmore than one of these vacua inside a single Hubble patch. This corresponds to\na dynamical phase decomposition, analogously to what happens in the course of\nthermal first-order phase transitions. In the subsequent process of bubble wall\ncollisions, the lowest-lying axionic minimum eventually takes over all space.\nOur main result is that this violent process sources gravitational waves, very\nmuch like in the case of a first-order phase transition. We compute the energy\ndensity and peak frequency of the signal, which can lie anywhere in the mHz-GHz\nrange, possibly within reach of next-generation interferometers. We also note\nthat this \"dynamical phase decomposition\" phenomenon and its gravitational wave\nsignal are more general and may apply to other inflationary or reheating\nscenarios with axions and modulated potentials.\n", "  Combining Raman scattering measurements with mean field calculations of the\nRaman response we show that Kitaev-like magnetic exchange is dominant in the\nhyperkagome iridate Na$_4$Ir$_3$O$_8$. In the measurements we observe a broad\nRaman band at $\\sim$~3500 cm$^{-1}$ with a band-width $\\sim 1700$~cm$^{-1}$.\nCalculations of the Raman response of the Kitaev-Heisenberg model on the\nhyperkagome lattice shows that the experimental observations are consistent\nwith calculated Raman response where Kitaev exchange interaction ($J_K$) is\nmuch larger than the Heisenberg term J$_1$ ($J_1/J_K \\sim 0.1$). A comparison\nwith the theoretical model gives an estimate of the Kitaev exchange interaction\nparameter.\n", "  Numerical calculations of anisotropic hopping transport based on the resistor\nnetwork model are presented. Conductivity is shown to follow the stretched\nexponential dependence on temperature with exponents changing from 1/4 to 1 as\nthe wave functions become anisotropic and their localization length in the\ndirection of charge transport decreases. For sufficiently strong anisotropy,\nthis results in nearest-neighbor hopping at low temperatures due to the\nformation of a single conduction path, which adjusts in the planes where the\nwave functions overlap strongly. In the perpendicular direction, charge\ntransport follows variable-range hopping, a behavior that agrees with\nexperimental data on organic semiconductors.\n", "  We introduce a new effective strategy to assign group and cluster membership\nprobabilities $P_{mem}$ to galaxies using photometric redshift information.\nLarge dynamical ranges both in halo mass and cosmic time are considered. The\nmethod takes the magnitude distribution of both cluster and field galaxies as\nwell as the radial distribution of galaxies in clusters into account using a\nnon-parametric formalism and relies on Bayesian inference to take photometric\nredshift uncertainties into account. We successfully test the method against\n1,208 galaxy clusters within redshifts $z=0.05-2.58$ and masses\n$10^{13.29-14.80}~M_\\odot$ drawn from wide field simulated galaxy mock catalogs\ndeveloped for the Euclid mission. Median purity $(55^{+17}_{-15})\\%$ and\ncompleteness $(95^{+5}_{-10})\\%$ are reached for galaxies brighter than\n0.25$L_\\ast$ within $r_{200}$ of each simulated halo and for a statistical\nphotometric redshift accuracy $\\sigma((z_s-z_p)/(1+z_s))=0.03$. The mean values\n$p=56\\%$ and $c=93\\%$ have sub-percent uncertainties. Accurate photometric\nredshifts ($\\sigma((z_s-z_p)/(1+z_s))\\lesssim0.05$) and robust estimates for\nthe cluster redshift and the center coordinates are required. The method is\napplied to derive accurate richness estimates. A statistical comparison between\nthe true ($N_{\\rm true}$) vs estimated richness ($\\lambda=\\sum P_{mem}$) yields\non average to unbiased results, $Log(\\lambda/N_{\\rm true})=-0.0051\\pm0.15$. The\nscatter around the mean of the logarithmic difference between $\\lambda$ and the\nhalo mass is 0.10~dex, for massive halos $\\gtrsim10^{14.5}~M_\\odot$. Our\nestimates could be useful to calibrate independent cluster mass estimates from\nweak lensing, SZ, and X-ray studies. Our method can be applied to any list of\ngalaxy clusters or groups in both present and forthcoming surveys such as SDSS,\nCFHTLS, DES, LSST, and Euclid.\n", "  The fiber bundle model is essentially an array of elements that break when\nsufficient load is applied on them. With a local loading mechanism, this can\nserve as a model for a one-dimensional interface separating the broken and\nunbroken parts of a solid in mode-I fracture. The interface can propagate\nthrough the system depending on the loading rate and disorder present in the\nfailure thresholds of the fibers. In the presence of a quasi-static drive, the\nintermittent dynamics of the interface mimic front propagation in disordered\nmedia. Such situations appear in diverse physical systems such as mode-I crack\npropagation, domain wall dynamics in magnets, charge density waves, contact\nline in wetting etc. We study the effect of the range of interaction, i.e. the\nneighborhood of the interface affected following a local perturbation, on the\nstatistics of the intermittent dynamics of the front. There exists a crossover\nfrom local to global behavior as the range of interaction grows and a\ncontinuously varying `universality' in the intermediate range. This means that\nthe interaction range is a relevant parameter of any resulting physics. This is\nparticularly relevant in view of the fact that there is a scatter in the\nexperimental observations of the exponents, in even idealized experiments on\nfracture fronts, and also a possibility in changing the interaction range in\nreal samples.\n", "  We investigate the evolutions of two prominences (P1,P2) and two bundles of\ncoronal loops (L1,L2), observed with SDO/AIA near the east solar limb on 2012\nSeptember 22. It is found that there were large-amplitude oscillations in P1\nand L1, but no detectable motions in P2 and L2. These transverse oscillations\nwere triggered by a large-scale coronal wave, originating from a large flare in\na remote active region behind the solar limb. By carefully comparing the\nlocations and heights of these oscillating and non-oscillating structures, we\nconclude that the propagating height of the wave is between 50 Mm and 130 Mm.\nThe wave energy deposited in the oscillating prominence and coronal loops is at\nleast of the order of $10^{28}$ erg. Furthermore, local magnetic field strength\nand Alfv\\'{e}n speeds are derived from the oscillating periods and damping time\nscales, which are extracted from the time series of the oscillations. It is\ndemonstrated that oscillations can be used in not only coronal seismology, but\nalso revealing the properties of the wave.\n", "  We present a couple of protocols based on shortcut to adiabaticity techniques\nfor rapid generation of robust entangled Bell states in a system of two\ntwo-state systems. Our protocols rely on the so-called transitionless quantum\ndriving (TQD) algorithm and Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant (LRI) method. Both TQD\nand LRI methods result in high fidelity in population transfer.Our study shows\nthat it is possible to prepare an entangled state in infinitely short time\nwithout losing robustness and efficiency.\n", "  We present a star catalogue extracted from the Lunar-based Ultraviolet\nTelescope (LUT) survey program. LUT's observable sky area is a circular belt\naround the Moon's north pole, and the survey program covers a preferred area\nfor about 2400 deg$^2$ which includes a region of the Galactic plane. The data\nis processed with an automatic pipeline which copes with stray light\ncontamination, artificial sources, cosmic rays, flat field calibration,\nphotometry and so on. In the first release version, the catalogue provides high\nconfidence sources which have been cross-identified with Tycho-2 catalogue. All\nthe sources have signal-to-noise ratio larger than 5, and the corresponding\nmagnitude limit is typically 14.4 mag, which can be deeper as ~16 mag if the\nstray light contamination is in the lowest level. A total number of 86,467\nstars are recorded in the catalogue. The full catalogue in electronic form is\navailable on line.\n", "  We present a class of left-right symmetric models where Dirac as well as\nMajorana mass terms of neutrinos can arise at one-loop level in a scotogenic\nfashion: with dark matter particles going inside the loop. We show the\npossibility of naturally light right handed neutrinos that can have interesting\nimplications at neutrinoless double beta decay experiments as well as\ncosmology. Apart from a stable dark matter candidate stabilised by a remnant\n$Z_2$ symmetry, one can also have a long lived keV sterile neutrino dark matter\nin these models. This class of models can have very different collider\nsignatures compared to the conventional left-right models.\n", "  We consider the $1/N$-expansion of the moments of the proper delay times for\na ballistic chaotic cavity supporting $N$ scattering channels. In the random\nmatrix approach, these moments correspond to traces of negative powers of\nWishart matrices. For systems with and without broken time reversal symmetry\n(Dyson indices $\\beta=1$ and $\\beta=2$) we obtain a recursion relation, which\nefficiently generates the coefficients of the $1/N$-expansion of the moments.\nThe integrality of these coefficients and their possible diagrammatic\ninterpretation is discussed.\n", "  The merger of a neutron star binary may result in the formation of a\nrapidly-spinning magnetar. The magnetar can potentially survive for seconds or\nlonger as a supramassive neutron star before collapsing to a black hole if,\nindeed, it collapses at all. During this process, a fraction of the magnetar's\nrotational energy of ~10^53 erg is transferred via magnetic spin-down to the\nsurrounding ejecta. The resulting interaction between the ejecta and the\nsurrounding circumburst medium powers a >year-long synchrotron radio transient.\nWe present a search for radio emission with the Very Large Array following nine\nshort-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) at rest-frame times of ~1.3-7.6 years\nafter the bursts, focusing on those events which exhibit early-time excess\nX-ray emission that may signify the presence of magnetars. We place upper\nlimits of <18-32 microJy on the 6.0 GHz radio emission, corresponding to\nspectral luminosities of <(0.05-8.3)x10^39 erg s^-1. Comparing these limits to\nthe predicted radio emission from a long-lived remnant and incorporating\nmeasurements of the circumburst densities from broad-band modeling of short GRB\nafterglows, we rule out a stable magnetar with an energy of 10^53 erg for half\nof the events in our sample. A supramassive remnant that injects a lower\nrotational energy of 10^52 erg is ruled out for a single event, GRB 050724A.\nThis study represents the deepest and most extensive search for long-term radio\nemission following short GRBs to date, and thus the most stringent limits\nplaced on the physical properties of magnetars associated with short GRBs from\nradio observations.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the $P-V$ criticality and phase transition of\ncharged accelerating AdS black holes in the extended thermodynamic phase space\nin analogy between black hole system and Van der Waals liquid-gas system, where\nthe cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ is treated as a thermodynamical variable\ninterpreted as dynamic pressure and its conjugate quantity is the thermodynamic\nvolume of the black holes. When the electric charge vanishes, we find that no\n$P-V$ criticality will appear but the Hawking-Page like phase transition will\nbe present, just as what Schwarzschild-AdS black holes behave like. For the\ncharged case, the $P-V$ criticality appears and the accelerating black holes\nwill undergo a small black hole/large phase transition under the condition that\nthe acceleration parameter $A$ and the horizon radius $r_h$ meet a certain\nsimple relation $A r_h=a$, where $a$ is a constant in our discussion. To make\n$P-V$ criticality appear, there exists an upper bounds for constant $a$. When\n$P-V$ criticality appears, we calculate the critical pressure $P_{c}$, critical\ntemperature $T_{c}$ and critical specific volume $r_{c}$, and we find that\n$\\frac{P_{c}r_{c}}{T_{c}}$ is an universal number.\n", "  We present a systematic study of the temperature dependence of diffusive\nmagnon spin transport, using a non-local device geometry. In our measurements,\nwe detect spin signals arising from electrical and thermal magnon generation,\nand we directly extract the magnon spin diffusion length $\\lambda_m$ for\ntemperatures from 2 to 293 K. Values of $\\lambda_m$ obtained from electrical\nand thermal generation agree within the experimental error, with\n$\\lambda_m=9.6\\pm0.9$ $\\mu$m at room temperature to a minimum of\n$\\lambda_m=5.5\\pm0.7$ $\\mu$m at 30 K. Using a 2D finite element model to fit\nthe data obtained for electrical magnon generation we extract the magnon spin\nconductivity $\\sigma_m$ as a function of temperature, which is reduced from\n$\\sigma_m=5.1\\pm0.2\\times10^5$ S/m at room temperature to\n$\\sigma_m=0.7\\pm0.4\\times10^5$ S/m at 5 K. Finally, we observe an enhancement\nof the signal originating from thermally generated magnons for low\ntemperatures, where a maximum is observed around $T=7$ K. An explanation for\nthis low temperature enhancement is however still missing and requires\nadditional investigations.\n", "  We investigate both the chiral and deconfinement phase transitions of QCD\nmatter in a refined scheme of Dyson-Schwinger equations, which have been shown\nto be successful in giving the meson mass spectrum and matching the interaction\nwith the results from ab initio computation. We verify the equivalence of the\nchiral susceptibility criterion with different definitions for the\nsusceptibility and confirm that the chiral susceptibility criterion is\nefficient to fix not only the chiral phase boundary but also the critical end\npoint (CEP), especially when one could not have the effective thermodynamical\npotential. We propose a generalized Schwinger function criterion for the\nconfinement. We give the phase diagram of both phase transitions and show that\nin the refined scheme the position of the CEP shifts to lower chemical\npotential and higher temperature. Based on our calculation and previous results\nof the chemical freeze out conditions, we propose that the CEP locates in the\nstates of the matter generated by the Au--Au collisions with\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}^{}}=9\\sim15$ GeV.\n", "  An \"Echo chamber\" is the state of social learning agents whose performances\nare deteriorated by excessive observation of others. We understand this to be\nthe collective behavior of agents in a restless multi-armed bandit. The bandit\nhas $M$ good levers and bad levers. A good lever changes to a bad one randomly\nwith probability $q_{C}$ and a new good lever appears. $N$ agents exploit ones'\nlever if they know that it is a good one. Otherwise, they search for a good one\nby (i) random search (success probability $q_{I}$) and (ii) observe a good\nlever that is known by other agents (success probability $q_{O}$) with\nprobability $1-p$ and $p$, respectively. The distribution of agents in good\nlevers obeys the Yule distribution with power law exponent $1+\\gamma$ in the\nlimit $N,M\\to \\infty$ and $\\gamma=1+\\frac{(1-p)q_{I}}{pq_{O}}$. The expected\nvalue of the number of the agents with a good lever $N_{1}$ increases with $p$.\nThe system shows a phase transition at $p_{c}=\\frac{q_{I}}{q_{I}+q_{o}}$. For\n$p<p_{c}\\,(>p_{c})$, the variance of $N_{1}$ per agent $\\mbox{Var}(N_{1})/N$ is\nfinite (diverges as $\\propto N^{2-\\gamma}$ with $N$). There is a threshold\nvalue $N_{s}$ for the system size that scales as $\\ln N_{s} \\propto\n1/(\\gamma-1)$. For $p>p_{c}$ and $N<N_{s}$, all agents tend to share only one\ngood lever. $\\mbox{E}(N_{1})$ decreases to zero as $p\\to 1$, which is referred\nto as the \"Echo chamber\".\n", "  We present the first spectropolarimetric observations of a hydrogen-free\nsuperluminous supernova at z=0.1136, namely SN 2015bn. The transient shows\nsignificant polarization at both the observed epochs: one 24 days before\nmaximum light in the rest-frame, and the subsequent at 27 days after peak\nluminosity. Analysis of the Q-U plane suggests the presence of a dominant axis\nand no physical departure from the main axis at either epoch. The polarization\nspectrum along the dominant axis is characterized by a strong wavelength\ndependence and an increase in the signal from the first to the second epoch. We\nuse a Monte Carlo code to demonstrate that these properties are consistent with\na simple toy model that adopts an axi-symmetric ellipsoidal configuration for\nthe ejecta. We find that the wavelength dependence of the polarisation is\npossibly due to a strong wavelength dependence in the line opacity, while the\nhigher level of polarisation at the second epoch is a consequence of the\nincrease in the asphericity of the inner layers of the ejecta or the fact that\nthe photosphere recedes into less spherical layers. The geometry of the\nsuperluminous supernova results similar to those of stripped-envelope core\ncollapse SNe connected with GRB, while the overall evolution of the ejecta\nshape could be consistent with a central engine.\n", "  The expressions for the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of black holes with\nnonlinear electrodynamics, calculated in the eikonal approximation, are\npresented. In the eikonal limit QNMs of black holes are determined by the\nparameters of the circular null geodesics. The unstable circular null orbits\nare derived from the effective metric that is the one obeyed by light rays\nunder the influence of a nonlinear electromagnetic field. As an illustration we\ncalculate the QNMs of four nonlinear electromagnetic black holes, two singular\nand two regular, namely from Euler-Heisenberg and Born-Infeld theories, for\nsingular, and the magnetic Bardeen black hole and the one derived by Bronnikov\nfor regular ones. Comparison is shown with the QNMs of the linear\nelectromagnetic counterpart, their Reissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m black hole.\n", "  By modeling the broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of a typical\nflat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ, 3C 279) and two GeV narrow-line Seyfert 1\ngalaxies (NLS1s, PMN J0948+0022 and 1H 0323+342) in different flux stages with\nthe one-zone leptonic models, we find a universal correlation between their\nDoppler factors ($\\delta$) and peak luminosities ($L_{\\rm c}$) of external\nCompton scattering bumps. Compiling a combined sample of FSRQs and GeV NLS1s,\nit is found that both FSRQs and GeV NLS1s in different stages and in different\nsources well follow the same $\\delta$-$L_{\\rm c}$ correlation. This indicates\nthat the variations of observed luminosities may be essentially due to the\nDoppler boosting effect. And the universal $\\delta$-$L_{\\rm c}$ relation\nbetween FSRQs and GeV NLS1s in different stages may be further evidence that\nthe particle acceleration and radiation mechanisms for the two kinds of sources\nare similar. In addition, by replacing $L_{\\rm c}$ with the observed luminosity\nin the Fermi/LAT band ($L_{\\rm LAT}$), this correlation holds, and it may serve\nas an empirical indicator of $\\delta$. We estimate the $\\delta$ values with\n$L_{\\rm LAT}$ for 484 FSRQs in the Fermi/LAT Catalog and they range from 3 to\n41, with a median of 16, which are statistically consistent with the values\nderived by other methods.\n", "  Efficient uptake of nutrients from the environment is an important component\nin the fitness of all microorganisms, and its dependence on size may reveal\nclues to the origins of evolutionary transitions to multicellularity. Because\npotential benefits in uptake rates must be viewed in the context of other costs\nand benefits of size, such as varying predation rates and the increased\nmetabolic costs associated with larger and more complex body plans, the uptake\nrate itself is not necessarily that which is optimized by evolution. Uptake\nrates can be strongly dependent on local organism geometry and its swimming\nspeed, providing selective pressure for particular arrangements. Here we\nexamine these issues for choanoflagellates, filter-feeding microorganisms that\nare the closest relatives of the animals. We explore the different\nmorphological variations of the choanoflagellete $Salpingoeca~rosetta$, which\ncan exist as a swimming cell, a sessile thecate cell, and as colonies of cells\nin various shapes. In the absence of other requirements and in a homogeneously\nnutritious environment, we find that the optimal strategy to maximize filter\nfeeding by the collar of microvilli is to swim fast, which favours swimming\nunicells. In large external flows, the sessile thecate cell becomes\nadvantageous. Effects of prey diffusion are discussed and also found to be to\nthe advantage of the swimming unicell.\n", "  We discuss the A-model as a gauge fixing of the Poisson Sigma Model with\ntarget a symplectic structure. We complete the discussion in [arXiv:0706.3164],\nwhere a gauge fixing defined by a compatible complex structure was introduced,\nby showing how to recover the A-model hierarchy of observables in terms of the\nAKSZ observables. Moreover, we discuss the off-shell supersymmetry of the\nA-model as a residual BV symmetry of the gauge-fixed PSM action.\n", "  The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) at the center of our Galaxy is the best\ntemplate to study star formation processes under extreme conditions, similar to\nthose in high-redshift galaxies. We observed on-the-fly maps of para-H$_{2}$CO\ntransitions at 218 GHz and 291 GHz towards seven Galactic Center clouds. From\nthe temperature-sensitive integrated intensity line ratios of\nH$_{2}$CO(3$_{2,1}-$2$_{2,0}$)/H$_{2}$CO(3$_{0,3}-$2$_{0,2}$) and\nH$_{2}$CO(4$_{2,2}-$3$_{2,1}$)/H$_{2}$CO(4$_{0,4}-$3$_{0,3}$) in combination\nwith radiative transfer models, we produce gas temperature maps of our targets.\nThese transitions are sensitive to gas with densities of $\\sim$10$^{5}$\ncm$^{-3}$ and temperatures <150 K. The measured gas temperatures in our sources\nare all higher (>40 K) than their dust temperatures ($\\sim$25 K). Our targets\nhave a complex velocity structure that requires a careful disentanglement of\nthe different components. We produce temperature maps for each of the velocity\ncomponents and show that the temperatures of the components differ, revealing\ntemperature gradients in the clouds. Combining the temperature measurements\nwith the integrated intensity line ratio of\nH$_{2}$CO(4$_{0,4}-$3$_{0,3}$)/H$_{2}$CO(3$_{0,3}-$2$_{0,2}$), we constrain the\ndensity of this warm gas to 10$^{4}-$10$^{6}$ cm$^{-3}$. We find a positive\ncorrelation of the line width of the main H$_{2}$CO lines with the temperature\nof the gas, direct evidence for gas heating via turbulence. Our data is\nconsistent with a turbulence heating model with a density of n = 10$^5$\ncm$^{-3}$.\n", "  The density-dependent relativistic Hartree-Fock (DDRHF) theory is extended to\ninclude $\\Delta$-isobars for the study of dense nuclear matter and neutron\nstars. To this end, we solve the Rarita-Schwinger equation for spin-3/2\nparticle. Both the direct and exchange terms of the $\\Delta$-isobars'\nself-energies are evaluated in details. In comparison with the relativistic\nmean field theory (Hartree approximation), a weaker parameter dependence is\nfound for DDRHF. An early appearance of $\\Delta$-isobars is recognized at\n$\\rho_B\\sim0.27$fm$^{-3}$, comparable with that of hyperons. Also, we find that\nthe $\\Delta$-isobars' softening of the equation of state is found to be mainly\ndue to the reduced Fock contributions from the coupling of the isoscalar\nmesons, while the pion contributions are found negligibly small. We finally\nconclude that with typical parameter sets, neutron stars with $\\Delta$-isobars\nin their interiors could be as heavy as the two massive pulsars whose masses\nare precisely measured, with slightly smaller radii than normal neutron stars.\n", "  We discuss the non-perturbative contributions from real and complex saddle\npoint solutions in the $\\mathbb{C}P^1$ quantum mechanics with fermionic degrees\nof freedom, using the Lefschetz thimble formalism beyond the gaussian\napproximation. We find bion solutions, which correspond to (complexified)\ninstanton-antiinstanton configurations stabilized in the presence of the\nfermionic degrees of freedom. By computing the one-loop determinants in the\nbion backgrounds, we obtain the leading order contributions from both the real\nand complex bion solutions. To incorporate quasi zero modes which become nearly\nmassless in a weak coupling limit, we regard the bion solutions as\nwell-separated instanton-antiinstanton configurations and calculate a\ncomplexified quasi moduli integral based on the Lefschetz thimble formalism.\nThe non-perturbative contributions from the real and complex bions are shown to\ncancel out in the supersymmetric case and give an (expected) ambiguity in the\nnon-supersymmetric case, which plays a vital role in the resurgent\ntrans-series. For nearly supersymmetric situation, evaluation of the Lefschetz\nthimble gives results in precise agreement with those of the direct evaluation\nof the Schr\\\"odinger equation. We also perform the same analysis for the\nsine-Gordon quantum mechanics and point out some important differences showing\nthat the sine-Gordon quantum mechanics does not correctly describe the 1d limit\nof the $\\mathbb{C}P^{N-1}$ field theory of $\\mathbb{R} \\times S^1$.\n", "  In Poincar\\'e-covariant continuum treatments of the three valence-quark\nbound-state problem, the force behind dynamical chiral symmetry breaking also\ngenerates nonpointlike, interacting diquark correlations in the nucleon and its\nresonances. We detail the impact of these correlations on the\nelectromagnetically-induced nucleon-$\\Delta$ and nucleon-Roper transitions,\nproviding a flavour-separation of the latter and associated predictions that\ncan be tested at modern facilities.\n", "  We consider properties of a fully superconducting variant of the\nsuperconducting quantum interference proximity transistor magnetic flux sensor.\nWe study the density of states in a finite-size superconducting metal wire in\nthe diffusive limit, and how it depends on the phase gradient of the order\nparameter. We describe the dependence on the junction length and interface\ntransparency, and discuss properties relevant for using the structure in\nmagnetic flux detection applications.\n", "  The existence of the $0_3^+$ and $0_4^+$ states around 10 MeV excitation\nenergy in ${^{12}{\\rm C}}$ is confirmed by a fully microscopic 3$\\alpha$\ncluster model. Firstly, a GCM (generator coordinate method) calculation is\nperformed by superposing optimized 2$\\alpha$+$\\alpha$ THSR\n(Tohsaki-Horiuchi-Schuck-R\\\"{o}pke) wave functions with the radius-constraint\nmethod. The obtained two excited $0^+$ states above the Hoyle state are\nconsistent with the recently observed states by experiment. Secondly, a\nvariational calculation using the single 2$\\alpha$+$\\alpha$ THSR wave function\northogonalized to the ground and Hoyle states is made and it also supports the\nexistence of the $0_3^+$ state obtained by the GCM calculation. The analysis of\nthe obtained $0_3^+$ state is made by studying its 2$\\alpha$-$\\alpha$ reduced\nwidth amplitude, its 2$\\alpha$ correlation function, and the large monopole\nmatrix element between this state and the Hoyle state, which shows that this\n$0_3^+$ state is a breathing-like excited state of the Hoyle state. This\ncharacter of the $0_3^+$ state is very different from the $0_4^+$ state which\nseems to have a bent-arm 3$\\alpha$ structure.\n", "  Recently a theoretical scheme explaining the vorticity generation by surface\nwaves in liquids was developed [S. Filatov et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 054501\n(2016)]. Here we study how a thin (monomolecular) film presented at the surface\nof liquid affects the generated vorticity. We demonstrate that the vorticity\nbecomes parametrically larger than for the case with a clean surface and now it\ndepends on viscosity of the liquid. We also discuss the motion of particles\npassively advected by the generated surface flow. The results can be used in\ndifferent applications: from the analysis of pollutants' diffusion on the ocean\nsurface till the reconstruction of vorticity based on the particle image\nvelocimetry (PIV) measurements.\n", "  The CONT14 campaign with state-of-the-art VLBI data has observed the source\n0642+449 with about one thousand observables each day during a continuous\nobserving period of fifteen days, providing tens of thousands of closure\ndelays---the sum of the delays around a closed loop of baselines. The closure\ndelay is independent of the instrumental and propagation delays and provides\nvaluable additional information about the source structure. We demonstrate the\nuse of this new \"observable\" for the determination of the structure in the\nradio source 0642+449. This source, as one of the defining sources in the\nsecond realization of the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF2), is\nfound to have two point-like components with a relative position offset of -426\nmicroarcseconds in right ascension and -66 microarcseconds in declination. The\ntwo components are almost equally bright with a flux-density ratio of 0.92. The\nstandard deviation of closure delays for source 0642+449 was reduced from 139\nps to 90 ps by using this two-component model. Closure delays larger than one\nnanosecond are found to be related to the source structure, demonstrating that\nstructure effects for a source with this simple structure could be up to tens\nof nanoseconds. The method described in this paper does not rely on a priori\nsource structure information, such as knowledge of source structure determined\nfrom direct (Fourier) imaging of the same observations or observations at other\nepochs. We anticipate our study to be a starting point for more effective\ndetermination of the structure effect in VLBI observations.\n", "  We investigate the disorder-driven phase transition from a fractional quantum\nHall state to an Anderson insulator using quantum entanglement methods. We find\nthat the transition is signaled by a sharp increase in the sensitivity of a\nsuitably averaged entanglement entropy with respect to disorder -- the\nmagnitude of its disorder derivative appears to diverge in the thermodynamic\nlimit. We also study the level statistics of the entanglement spectrum as a\nfunction of disorder. However, unlike the dramatic phase-transition signal in\nthe entanglement entropy derivative, we find a gradual reduction of level\nrepulsion only deep in the Anderson insulating phase.\n", "  We examine the scenario that the Doppler factor determines the observational\ndifferences of blazars in this paper. Significantly negative correlations are\nfound between the observational synchrotron peak frequency and the Doppler\nfactor. After correcting the Doppler boosting, the intrinsic peak frequency\nfurther has a tightly linear relation with the Doppler factor. It is more\ninteresting that this relation is consistent with the scenario that the black\nhole mass governs both the bulk Lorentz factor and the synchrotron peak\nfrequency. In addition, the distinction of the kinetic jet powers between BL\nLacs and FSRQs disappears after the boosting factor $\\delta^2$ is considered.\nThe negative correlation between the peak frequency and the observational\nisotropic luminosity, known as the blazar sequence, also disappears after the\nDoppler boosting is corrected. We also find that the correlation between the\nCompton dominance and the Doppler factor exists for all types of blazars.\nTherefore, this correlation is unsuitable to examine the external Compton\nemission dominance.\n", "  We present first measurable predictions for electromagnetic (two-photon)\ndouble scattering production of two positron-electron pairs in ultraperipheral\nheavy-ion collisions at LHC. Measureable cross sections are obtained with\nrealistic cuts on electron/positron (pseudo)rapidities and transverse momenta\nfor the ALICE and ATLAS or CMS experiments. The predictions for total and\ndifferential cross sections are presented. We show also two-dimensional\ndistributions in rapidities of the opposite-sign (from the same or different\nsubcollisions) and of the same-sign ($e^+ e^+$ or $e^- e^-$) electrons and in\nrapidity distance between them. Expected number of events are presented and\ndiscussed. Our calculations strongly suggest that relevant measurements with\nthe help of ATLAS, CMS and ALICE detectors are possible in a near future.\n", "  With the advent of spatially resolved fluorescence imaging in quantum gas\nmicroscopes, it is now possible to directly image glassy phases and probe the\nlocal effects of disorder in a highly controllable setup. Here we present\nnumerical calculations using a spatially-resolved local mean-field theory, show\nthat it captures the essential physics of the disordered system and use it to\nsimulate the density distributions seen in single-shot fluorescence microscopy.\nFrom these simulated images we extract local properties of the phases which are\nmeasurable by a quantum gas microscope and show that unambiguous detection of\nthe Bose glass is possible. In particular, we show that experimental\ndetermination of the Edwards-Anderson order parameter is possible in a strongly\ncorrelated quantum system using existing experiments. We also suggest\nmodifications to the experiments which will allow further properties of the\nBose glass to be measured.\n", "  We modify Randall-Sundrum model of brane-world (with two branes) by adding\nthe scalar curvature squared term in five dimensions. We find that it does not\ndestabilize Randall-Sundrum solution to the hierarchy problem of the Standard\nModel in particle physics.\n", "  We test the theoretical predictions of several cosmological models against\ndifferent observables to compare the indirect estimates of the current\nexpansion rate of the Universe determined from model fitting with the direct\nmeasurements based on Cepheids data published recently. We perform a\nstatistical analysis of type Ia supernova (SN Ia), Hubble parameter, and baryon\nacoustic oscillation data. A joint analysis of these datasets allows us to\nbetter constrain cosmological parameters, but also to break the degeneracy that\nappears in the distance modulus definition between $H_0$ and the absolute\nB-band magnitude of SN Ia, $M_0$. From the theoretical side, we considered\nspatially flat and curvature-free $\\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, and inhomogeneous\nLema\\^{i}tre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) models. To analyse SN Ia we took into account\nthe distributions of SN Ia intrinsic parameters. For the $\\Lambda$CDM model we\nfind that $\\Omega_m=0.35\\pm0.02$, $H_0=(67.8\\pm1.0)\\,$km$\\,$s$^{-1}/$Mpc, while\nthe corrected SN absolute magnitude has a normal distribution ${\\cal\nN}(19.13,0.11)$. The $w$CDM model provides the same value for $\\Omega_m$, while\n$H_0=(66.5\\pm1.8)\\,$km$\\,$s$^{-1}/$Mpc and $w=-0.93\\pm0.07$. When an\ninhomogeneous LTB model is considered, the combined fit provides\n$H_0=(64.2\\pm1.9)\\,$km$\\,$s$^{-1}/$Mpc. Both the Akaike information criterion\nand the Bayes factor analysis cannot clearly distinguish between $\\Lambda$CDM\nand $w$CDM cosmologies, while they clearly disfavour the LTB model. For the\n$\\Lambda$CDM, our joint analysis of the SN Ia, the Hubble parameter, and the\nbaryon acoustic oscillation datasets provides $H_0$ values that are consistent\nwith CMB-only Planck measurements, but they differ by $2.5\\sigma$ from the\nvalue based on Cepheids data.\n", "  We derive analyticity constraints on a nonlinear ghost-free effective theory\nof a massive spin-2 particle known as pseudo-linear massive gravity, and on a\ngeneralized theory of a massive spin-1 particle, both of which provide simple\nIR completions of Galileon theories. For pseudo-linear massive gravity we find\nthat, unlike dRGT massive gravity, there is no window of parameter space which\nsatisfies the analyticity constraints. For massive vectors which reduce to\nGalileons in the decoupling limit, we find that no two-derivative actions are\ncompatible with positivity, but that higher derivative actions can be made\ncompatible.\n", "  In 1922, Kottler put forward the program to remove the gravitational\npotential, the metric of spacetime, from the fundamental equations in physics\nas far as possible. He successfully applied this idea to Newton's\ngravitostatics and to Maxwell's electrodynamics, where Kottler recast the field\nequations in premetric form and specified a metric-dependent constitutive law.\nWe will discuss the basics of the premetric approach and some of its beautiful\nconsequences, like the division of universal constants into two classes. We\nshow that classical electrodynamics can be developed without a metric quite\nstraightforwardly: the Maxwell equations, together with a local and linear\nresponse law for electromagnetic media, admit a consistent premetric\nformulation. Kottler's program succeeds here without provisos. In Kottler's\napproach to gravity, making the theory relativistic, two premetric\nquasi-Maxwellian field equations arise, but their field variables, if\ninterpreted in terms of general relativity, do depend on the metric. However,\none can hope to bring the Kottler idea to work by using the teleparallelism\nequivalent of general relativity, where the gravitational potential, the\ncoframe, can be chosen in a premetric way.\n", "  We calculate the $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s)$ QCD corrections to the inclusive\n$h\\to b\\bar b$ decay rate in the dimension-6 Standard Model Effective Field\nTheory (SMEFT). The QCD corrections multiplying the dimension-6 Wilson\ncoefficients which alter the $hb\\bar b$-vertex at tree-level are proportional\nto the Standard Model (SM) ones, so next-to-leading order results can be\nobtained through a simple rescaling of the tree-level decay rate. On the other\nhand, contributions from the operators $Q_{bG}$ and $Q_{HG}$, which alter the\n$gb\\bar b$-vertex and introduce a $hgg$-vertex respectively, enter at\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s)$ and induce sizeable corrections which are unrelated to\nthe SM ones and cannot be anticipated through a renormalisation-group analysis.\nWe present compact analytic results for these contributions, which we recommend\nto be included in future phenomenological studies.\n", "  Outbursts on young stars are usually interpreted as accretion bursts caused\nby instabilities in the disk or the star-disk connection. However, some\nprotostellar outbursts may not fit into this framework. In this paper, we\nanalyze optical and near-infrared spectra and photometry to characterize the\n2015 outburst of the probable young star ASASSN-15qi. The $\\sim 3.5$ mag\nbrightening in the $V$ band was sudden, with an unresolved rise time of less\nthan one day. The outburst decayed exponentially by 1 mag for 6 days and then\ngradually back to the pre-outburst level after 200 days. The outburst is\ndominated by emission from $\\sim10,000$ K gas. An explosive release of energy\naccelerated matter from the star in all directions, seen in a spectacular cool,\nspherical wind with a maximum velocity of 1000 km/s. The wind and hot gas both\ndisappeared as the outburst faded and the source returned to its quiescent\nF-star spectrum. Nebulosity near the star brightened with a delay of 10-20\ndays. Fluorescent excitation of H$_2$ is detected in emission from vibrational\nlevels as high as $v=11$, also with a possible time delay in flux increase. The\nmid-infrared spectral energy distribution does not indicate the presence of\nwarm dust emission, although the optical photospheric absorption and CO\novertone emission could be related to a gaseous disk. Archival photometry\nreveals a prior outburst in 1976. Although we speculate about possible causes\nfor this outburst, none of the explanations are compelling.\n", "  In this paper, we perform a full next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD calculation\nof neutralino scattering on protons or neutrons in the MSSM. We match the\nresults of the NLO QCD calculation to the scalar and axial-vector operators in\nthe effective field theory approach. These govern the spin-independent and\nspin-dependent detection rates, respectively. The calculations have been\nperformed for general bino, wino and higgsino decompositions of neutralino dark\nmatter and required a novel tensor reduction method of loop integrals with\nvanishing relative velocities and Gram determinants. Numerically, the NLO QCD\neffects are shown to be of at least of similar size and sometimes larger than\nthe currently estimated nuclear uncertainties. We also demonstrate the\ninterplay of the direct detection rate with the relic density when consistently\nanalyzed with the program $\\mathtt{DM@NLO}$.\n", "  We drastically simplify the problem of linearizing a general higher-order\ntheory of gravity. We reduce it to the evaluation of its Lagrangian on a\nparticular Riemann tensor depending on two parameters, and the computation of\ntwo derivatives with respect to one of those parameters. We use our method to\nconstruct a D-dimensional cubic theory of gravity which satisfies the following\nproperties: 1) it shares the spectrum of Einstein gravity, i.e., it only\npropagates a transverse and massless graviton on a maximally symmetric\nbackground; 2) the relative coefficients of the different curvature invariants\ninvolved are the same in all dimensions; 3) it is neither trivial nor\ntopological in four dimensions. Up to cubic order in curvature, the only\npreviously known theories satisfying the first two requirements are the\nLovelock ones: Einstein gravity, Gauss-Bonnet and cubic-Lovelock. Of course,\nthe last two theories fail to satisfy requirement 3 as they are, respectively,\ntopological and trivial in four dimensions. We show that, up to cubic order,\nthere exists only one additional theory satisfying requirements 1 and 2.\nInterestingly, this theory is, along with Einstein gravity, the only theory\nwhich also satisfies 3.\n", "  [Abridged] Chemical evolution in the protoplanetary disk midplane can modify\nthe composition of ices and gases. We have investigated if and how chemical\nevolution affects the abundances and distributions of key volatile species in\nthe midplane of a protoplanetary disk in the 0.2-30 AU range. A full chemical\nnetwork including gas-phase, gas-grain interactions and grain-surface chemistry\nis used to evolve chemistry in time, for 1 Myr. Great diversity is observed in\nthe relative abundance ratios of the main considered species: H2O, CO, CO2,\nCH4, O2, NH3 and N2. The choice of ionisation level, the choice of initial\nabundances, as well as the extent of chemical reaction types included are all\nfactors that affect the chemical evolution. The only exception is the\ninheritance scenario with a low ionisation level, which results in negligible\nchanges compared with the initial abundances, regardless of whether\ngrain-surface chemistry is included. The chemical processing changes the C/O\nratios for gas and ice significantly with radius and with model assumptions.\nFor high ionisation levels, chemical processing becomes significant after a few\ntimes $10^{5}$~yrs. It is concluded that chemical evolution in the disk\nmidplane needs to be considered in the determination of the volatile\ncomposition of planetesimals.\n", "  Inflation with plateau potentials give the best fit to the CMB observables as\nthey predict tensor to scalar ratio stringently bounded by the observations\nfrom Planck and BICEP2/Keck. In supergravity models it is possible to obtain\nplateau potentials for scalar fields in the Einstein frame which can serve as\nthe inflation potential by considering higher dimensional Planck suppressed\noperators and by the choice of non-canonical K\\\"ahler potentials. We construct\na plateau inflation model in MSSM where the inflation occurs along a\nsneutrino-Higgs flat direction. A hidden sector Polonyi field is used for the\nbreaking of supersymmetry after the end of the inflation. The proper choice of\nsuperpotential leads to strong stabilization of the Polonyi field, $m_{Z}^2\\gg\nm_{3/2}^2$, which is required to solve the cosmological moduli problem. Also,\nthe SUSY breaking results in a TeV scale gravitino mass and scalar masses and\ngives rise to bilinear and triliear couplings of scalars which can be tested at\nthe LHC. The sneutrino inflation field can be observed at the LHC as a TeV\nscale diphoton resonance like the one reported by CMS and ATLAS.\n", "  We study some aspects of perturbation theory in $N=1$ supersymmetric abelian\ngauge theories with massive charged matter. In general gauges, infrared (IR)\ndivergences and nonlocal behavior arise in 1PI diagrams, associated with a\n$1/k^4$ term in the propagator for the vector superfield. We examine this\nstructure in supersymmetric QED. The IR divergences are gauge-dependent and\nmust cancel in physical quantities like the electron pole mass. We demonstrate\nthat cancellation takes place in a nontrivial way, amounting to a\nreorganization of the perturbative series from powers of $e^2$ to powers of\n$e$. We also show how these complications are avoided in cases where a\nWilsonian effective action can be defined.\n", "  We investigate the matter density perturbation $\\delta_m$ and power spectrum\n$P(k)$ in the running vacuum model (RVM) with the cosmological constant being a\nfunction of the Hubble parameter, given by $\\Lambda = \\Lambda_0 + 6 \\sigma H\nH_0+ 3\\nu H^2$, in which the linear and quadratic terms of $H$ would originate\nfrom the QCD vacuum condensation and cosmological renormalization group,\nrespectively. Taking the dark energy perturbation into consideration, we derive\nthe evolution equation for $\\delta_m$ and find a specific scale $d_{cr}=2\n\\pi/k_{cr}$, which divides the evolution of the universe into the sub and\nsuper-interaction regimes, corresponding to $k \\ll k_{cr}$ and $k \\gg k_{cr}$,\nrespectively. For the former, the evolution of $\\delta_m$ has the same behavior\nas that in the $\\Lambda$CDM model, while for the latter, the growth of\n$\\delta_m$ is frozen (greatly enhanced) when $\\nu + \\sigma >(<)0$ due to the\ncouplings between radiation, matter and dark energy. It is clear that the\nobservational data rule out the cases with $\\nu<0$ and $\\nu + \\sigma <0$, while\nthe allowed window for the model parameters is extremely narrow with $\\nu,\n|\\sigma| \\lesssim \\mathcal{O}(10^{-7})$.\n", "  In this work we present a neutron Larmor diffraction study of the rare earth\npyrochlores $R_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, with $R$ = Tb, Dy, Ho. We measured the\ntemperature dependence of the lattice parameter with precision $10^{-5}$,\nbetween 0.5 K and 300 K in each of the three compounds. The lattice parameter\nof the spin ices Dy$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ and Ho$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ enters into the\nderivation of the charge of the emergent magnetic monopole excitations\nsuggested to exist in these materials. We found that throughout the range of\napplicability of the theory of emergent monopoles in the spin ices there will\nbe no renormalization of the monopole charge due to lattice contraction. In\nTb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ strong magnetoelastic interactions have been reported. We\nfound no sign of the previously reported negative thermal expansion, but did\nobserve anomalies in the thermal expansion that can be correlated with\npreviously observed interactions between phonon and crystal field excitations.\nOther features in the thermal expansion of all three compounds can be related\nto previously observed anomalies the elastic constants, and explained by the\nphonon band structure of the rare earth titanates. The temperature dependence\nof the lattice strain in all three compounds can be correlated with the thermal\npopulation of excited crystal field levels.\n", "  We studied TbTe$_{3}$ using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) in the\ntemperature range of 298 - 355 K. As seen in previous STM measurements on\nRTe$_{3}$ compounds, our measurements detect a unidirectional charge density\nwave state (CDW) in the surface Te-layer with a wavevector consistent with that\nof the bulk, q$_{cdw}$ = 0.30 $\\pm$ 0.01c$^{*}$. However, unlike previous STM\nmeasurements, and differing from measurements probing the bulk, we detect two\nperpendicular orientations for the unidirectional CDWs with no directional\npreference for the in-plane crystal axes (a- or c-axis) and no noticeable\ndifference in wavevector magnitude. In addition, we find regions in which the\nbidirectional CDW states coexist. We propose that observation of two CDW states\nindicates a decoupling of the surface Te-layer from the rare-earth block layer\nbelow, and that strain variations in the Te surface layer drive the local CDW\ndirection to the specific unidirectional or, in rare occurrences, bidirectional\nCDW orders observed. This indicates that similar driving mechanisms for CDW\nformation in the bulk, where anisotropic lattice strain energy is important,\nare at play at the surface. In our bias-dependent measurements, we find no\ncontrast inversion for the CDW state between occupied and empty states. This\nfinding differs from other quasi 2-dimensional materials containing a hidden\n1-dimensional character which leads to a favorable Fermi surface nesting\nscenario. Our temperature-dependent measurements provide evidence for localized\nCDW formation above the bulk transition temperature, T$_{cdw}$.\n", "  Our study attempts to understand the collision characteristics of two coronal\nmass ejections (CMEs) launched successively from the Sun on 2013 October 25.\nThe estimated kinematics, from three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction techniques\napplied to observations of CMEs by SECCHI/Coronagraphic (COR) and Heliospheric\nImagers (HIs), reveal their collision around 37 $R_\\sun$ from the Sun. In the\nanalysis, we take into account the propagation and expansion speeds, impact\ndirection, angular size as well as the masses of the CMEs. These parameters are\nderived from imaging observations, but may suffer from large uncertainties.\nTherefore, by adopting head-on as well as oblique collision scenarios, we have\nquantified the range of uncertainties involved in the calculation of the\ncoefficient of restitution for expanding magnetized plasmoids. Our study shows\nthat the comparatively large expansion speed of the following CME than that of\nthe preceding CME, results in a higher probability of super-elastic collision.\nWe also infer that a relative approaching speed of the CMEs lower than the sum\nof their expansion speeds increases the chance of super-elastic collision. The\nanalysis under a reasonable errors in observed parameters of the CME, reveals\nthe larger probability of occurrence of an inelastic collision for the selected\nCMEs. We suggest that the collision nature of two CMEs should be discussed in\n3D, and the calculated value of the coefficient of restitution may suffer from\na large uncertainty.\n", "  We report on simultaneous X-ray and radio observations of the mode-switching\npulsar PSR B0943+10 obtained with the XMM-Newton satellite and the LOFAR, LWA\nand Arecibo radio telescopes in November 2014. We confirm the synchronous\nX-ray/radio switching between a radio-bright (B) and a radio-quiet (Q) mode, in\nwhich the X-ray flux is a factor ~2.4 higher than in the B-mode. We discovered\nX-ray pulsations, with pulsed fraction of 38+/-5% (0.5-2 keV), during the\nB-mode, and confirm their presence in Q-mode, where the pulsed fraction\nincreases with energy from ~20% up to ~65% at 2 keV. We found marginal evidence\nfor an increase in the X-ray pulsed fraction during B-mode on a timescale of\nhours. The Q-mode X-ray spectrum requires a fit with a two-component model\n(either a power-law plus blackbody or the sum of two blackbodies), while the\nB-mode spectrum is well fit by a single blackbody (a single power-law is\nrejected). With a maximum likelihood analysis, we found that in Q-mode the\npulsed emission has a thermal blackbody spectrum with temperature ~3.4x10^6 K\nand the unpulsed emission is a power-law with photon index ~2.5, while during\nB-mode both the pulsed and unpulsed emission can be fit by either a blackbody\nor a power law with similar values of temperature and photon index. A Chandra\nimage shows no evidence for diffuse X-ray emission. These results support a\nscenario in which both unpulsed non-thermal emission, likely of magnetospheric\norigin, and pulsed thermal emission from a small polar cap (~1500 m^2) with a\nstrong non-dipolar magnetic field (~10^{14} G), are present during both radio\nmodes and vary in intensity in a correlated way. This is broadly consistent\nwith the predictions of the partially screened gap model and does not\nnecessarily imply global magnetospheric rearrangements to explain the mode\nswitching.\n", "  We perform \\emph{ab initio} quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations of the warm\ndense uniform electron gas in the thermodynamic limit. By combining QMC data\nwith linear response theory we are able to remove finite-size errors from the\npotential energy over the entire warm dense regime, overcoming the deficiencies\nof the existing finite-size corrections by Brown \\emph{et al.}~[PRL\n\\textbf{110}, 146405 (2013)]. Extensive new QMC results for up to $N=1000$\nelectrons enable us to compute the potential energy $V$ and the\nexchange-correlation free energy $F_{xc}$ of the macroscopic electron gas with\nan unprecedented accuracy of $|\\Delta V|/|V|, |\\Delta F_{xc}|/|F|_{xc} \\sim\n10^{-3}$. A comparison of our new data to the recent parametrization of\n$F_{xc}$ by Karasiev {\\em et al.} [PRL {\\bf 112}, 076403 (2014)] reveals\nsignificant deviations to the latter.\n", "  Strongly driving a two-level quantum system with light leads to a ladder of\nFloquet states separated by the photon energy. Nanoscale quantum devices allow\nthe interplay of confined electrons, phonons, and photons to be studied under\nstrong driving conditions. Here we show that a single electron in a\nperiodically driven DQD functions as a \"Floquet gain medium,\" where population\nimbalances in the DQD Floquet quasi-energy levels lead to an intricate pattern\nof gain and loss features in the cavity response. We further measure a large\nintra-cavity photon number n_c in the absence of a cavity drive field, due to\nequilibration in the Floquet picture. Our device operates in the absence of a\ndc current -- one and the same electron is repeatedly driven to the excited\nstate to generate population inversion. These results pave the way to future\nstudies of non-classical light and thermalization of driven quantum systems.\n", "  Effective Lagrangians are a useful tool for a data-driven approach to physics\nbeyond the Standard Model at the LHC. However, for the new physics scales\naccessible at the LHC, the effective operator expansion is only relatively\nslowly converging at best. For tree-level processes, it has been found that the\nagreement between the effective Lagrangian and a range of UV-complete models\ndepends sensitively on the appropriate definition of the matching. We extend\nthis analysis to the one-loop level, which is relevant for electroweak\nprecision data and Higgs decay to photons. We show that near the scale of\nelectroweak symmetry breaking the validity of the effective theory description\ncan be systematically improved through an appropriate matching procedure. In\nparticular, we find a significant increase in accuracy when including suitable\nterms suppressed by the Higgs vacuum expectation value in the matching.\n", "  A new multidimensional simulation code for relativistic two-fluid\nelectrodynamics (RTFED) is described. The basic equations consist of the full\nset of Maxwell's equations coupled with relativistic hydrodynamic equations for\nseparate two charged fluids, representing the dynamics of either an\nelectron-positron or an electron-proton plasma. It can be recognized as an\nextension of conventional relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD). Finite\nresistivity may be introduced as a friction between the two species, which\nreduces to resistive RMHD in the long wavelength limit without suffering from a\nsingularity at infinite conductivity. A numerical scheme based on HLL\n(Harten-Lax-Van Leer) Riemann solver is proposed that exactly preserves the two\ndivergence constraints for Maxwell's equations simultaneously. Several\nbenchmark problems demonstrate that it is capable of describing RMHD\nshocks/discontinuities at long wavelength limit, as well as dispersive\ncharacteristics due to the two-fluid effect appearing at small scales. This\nshows that the RTFED model is a promising tool for high energy astrophysics\napplication.\n", "  The quest for new heavy states is a critical component of the LHC physics\nprogram. In this letter, we study the search for pseudoscalar bosons produced\nin association with a $t\\bar{t}$ pair. We consider the final state $t\\bar{t} A\n\\to t\\bar{t} b\\bar{b}$ with di-leptonic top pair signature, and reconstruct the\nboosted $A \\to b\\bar{b}$ candidate with jet substructure techniques, achieving\na remarkable sensitivity over a broad range of pseudoscalar masses and Yukawa\ncouplings. We apply this strategy to a Type-I Two-Higgs-Doublet Model,\ndemonstrating its ability to probe a realistic, UV-complete extended Higgs\nsector. In particular, we find that the $13~TeV$ LHC with $300~fb^{-1}$ of data\ncan constrain the region $\\tan\\beta>1.5$ at 95$\\%$ CL for a light pseudoscalar\nwith $m_A = 50$ GeV. Moreover, the whole mass range $20~GeV<m_A<210~GeV$ can be\nruled out for $\\tan\\beta \\leq 1$. Finally, we show that it is also possible to\ndirectly probe the CP-structure of the heavy scalar, and hence to distinguish a\nCP-odd (A) from a CP-even (H) 2HDM resonance.\n", "  The two parameters Weibull function is used to describe the charged particle\nmultiplicity distribution in $e^{+}e^{-}$ collisions at the highest available\nenergy measured by TASSO and ALEPH experiments. The Weibull distribution has\nwide applications in naturally evolving processes based on fragmentation and\nsequential branching. The Weibull model describes the multiplicity distribution\nvery well, as particle production processes involve QCD parton fragmentation.\nThe effective energy model of particle production was verified using Weibull\nparameters and the same was used to predict the multiplicity distribution in\n$e^{+}e^{-}$ collisions at future collider energies.\n", "  In an era of extensive photometric observations, the catalogs of RR Lyr type\nvariable stars number tens of thousands of objects. The relation between the\niron abundance [Fe/H] and the Fourier parameters of the stars light curve\nallows us to investigate mean metallicities and metallicity gradients in\nvarious stellar environments, independently of time-consuming spectroscopic\nobservations. In this paper we use almost 6500 $V$- and $I$-band light curves\nof fundamental mode RR Lyr stars from the OGLE-IV survey to provide a relation\nbetween the $V$- and $I$-band phase parameter $\\varphi_{31}$ used to estimate\n[Fe/H]. The relation depends on metallicity, which limits its applicability. We\napply this relation to metallicity formulae developed for the Johnson $V$- and\nthe Kepler $Kp$-band to obtain the relation between [Fe/H] and $\\varphi_{31}$\nfor the $I$-band photometry. Last, we apply the new relation of Nemec to the\nOGLE-IV fundamental mode RR Lyr stars data and construct a metallicity map of\nthe Magellanic Clouds. Median [Fe/H] is $-1.39\\pm0.44$ dex for the LMC and\n$-1.77\\pm0.48$ dex for the SMC, on the Jurcsik metallicity scale. We also find\na metallicity gradient within the LMC with a slope of $-0.029\\pm0.002$ dex/kpc\nin the inner 5 kpc and $-0.030 \\pm0.003$ dex/kpc beyond 8 kpc, and no gradient\nin-between ($-0.019\\pm0.002$ dex/kpc integrally). We do not observe a\nmetallicity gradient in the SMC, although we show that the metal-rich RRab\nstars are more concentrated toward the SMC center than the metal-poor.\n", "  We consider a broad class of inflationary models of two unconstrained chiral\nsuperfields, the stabilizer $S$ and the inflaton $\\Phi$, which can describe\ninflationary models with nearly arbitrary potentials. These models include, in\nparticular, the recently introduced theories of cosmological attractors, which\nprovide an excellent fit to the latest Planck data. We show that by adding to\nthe superpotential of the fields $S$ and $\\Phi$ a small term depending on a\nnilpotent chiral superfield $P$ one can break SUSY and introduce a small\ncosmological constant without affecting main predictions of the original\ninflationary scenario.\n", "  Fine-structure dynamics in solar prominences holds critical clues to\nunderstanding their physical nature of significant space-weather implications.\nWe report evidence of rotational motions of horizontal helical threads in two\nactive-region prominences observed by the \\emph{Hinode} and/or \\emph{IRIS}\nsatellites at high resolution. In the first event, we found transverse motions\nof brightening threads at speeds up to 55~km~s$^{-1}$ seen in the plane of the\nsky. Such motions appeared as sinusoidal space--time trajectories with a\ntypical period of $\\sim$390~s, which is consistent with plane-of-sky\nprojections of rotational motions. Phase delays at different locations suggest\npropagation of twists along the threads at phase speeds of 90--270~km~s$^{-1}$.\nAt least 15 episodes of such motions occurred in two days, none associated with\nany eruption. For these episodes, the plane-of-sky speed is linearly correlated\nwith the vertical travel distance, suggestive of a constant angular speed. In\nthe second event, we found Doppler velocities of 30--40~km~s$^{-1}$ in opposite\ndirections in the top and bottom portions of the prominence, comparable to the\nplane-of-sky speed. The moving threads have about twice broader line widths\nthan stationary threads. These observations, when taken together, provide\nstrong evidence for rotations of helical prominence threads, which were likely\ndriven by unwinding twists triggered by magnetic reconnection between twisted\nprominence magnetic fields and ambient coronal fields.\n", "  We have recently studied the development of an eruptive filament-driven,\nlarge-scale off-limb coronal bright front (OCBF) in the low solar corona\n(Kozarev et al. 2015), using remote observations from Solar Dynamics\nObservatory's Advanced Imaging Assembly EUV telescopes. In that study, we\nobtained high-temporal resolution estimates of the OCBF parameters regulating\nthe efficiency of charged particle acceleration within the theoretical\nframework of diffusive shock acceleration (DSA). These parameters include the\ntime-dependent front size, speed, and strength, as well as the upstream coronal\nmagnetic field orientations with respect to the front's surface normal\ndirection. Here we present an analytical particle acceleration model,\nspecifically developed to incorporate the coronal shock/compressive front\nproperties described above, derived from remote observations. We verify the\nmodel's performance through a grid of idealized case runs using input\nparameters typical for large-scale coronal shocks, and demonstrate that the\nresults approach the expected DSA steady-state behavior. We then apply the\nmodel to the event of May 11, 2011 using the OCBF time-dependent parameters\nderived in Kozarev et al. (2015). We find that the compressive front likely\nproduced energetic particles as low as 1.3 solar radii in the corona. Comparing\nthe modeled and observed fluences near Earth, we also find that the bulk of the\nacceleration during this event must have occurred above 1.5 solar radii. With\nthis study we have taken a first step in using direct observations of shocks\nand compressions in the innermost corona to predict the onsets and intensities\nof SEP events.\n", "  We determine the 22$\\mu$m luminosity evolution and luminosity function for\nquasars from a data set of over 20,000 objects obtained by combining\nflux-limited Sloan Digital Sky Survey optical and Wide field Infrared Survey\nExplorer mid-infrared data. We apply methods developed in previous works to\naccess the intrinsic population distributions non-parametrically, taking into\naccount the truncations and correlations inherent in the data. We find that the\npopulation of quasars exhibits positive luminosity evolution with redshift in\nthe mid-infrared, but with considerably less mid-infrared evolution than in the\noptical or radio bands. With the luminosity evolutions accounted for, we\ndetermine the density evolution and local mid-infrared luminosity function. The\nlatter displays a sharp flattening at local luminosities below $\\sim 10^{31}$\nerg sec$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$, which has been reported previously at 15 $\\mu$m for\nAGN classified as both type-1 and type-2. We calculate the integrated total\nemission from quasars at 22 $\\mu$m and find it to be a small fraction of both\nthe cosmic infrared background light and the integrated emission from all\nsources at this wavelength.\n", "  While spiral and lenticular galaxies have large-scale disks extending beyond\ntheir bulges, and most local early-type galaxies with 10^{10} < M_*/M_Sun <\n2x10^{11} contain a disk (e.g., ATLAS^3D), the early-type galaxies do possess a\nrange of disk sizes. The edge-on, `intermediate-scale' disk in the `disky\nelliptical' galaxy NGC 1271 has led to some uncertainty as to what its\nspheroidal component is. Walsh et al. reported a directly measured black hole\nmass of 3x10^9 M_Sun for this galaxy; which they remarked was an order of\nmagnitude greater than what they expected based on their derivation of the host\nspheroid's luminosity. Our near-infrared image analysis supports a small\nembedded disk within a massive spheroidal component with M_{sph,*} =\n(0.9+/-0.2)x10^{11} M_Sun (using M_*/L_H = 1.4 from Walsh et al.). This places\nNGC 1271 just 1.6-sigma above the near-linear M_bh-M_{sph,*} relation for\nearly-type galaxies. Therefore, past speculation that there may be a systematic\ndifference in the black hole scaling relations between compact massive\nearly-type galaxies with intermediate-scale disks, i.e. ES galaxies such as NGC\n1271, and early-type galaxies with either no substantial disk (E) or a\nlarge-scale disk (S0) is not strongly supported by NGC 1271. We additionally\n(i) show how ES galaxies fit naturally in the (`bulge'-to-total)-(morphological\ntype) diagram, while noting a complication with recent revisions to the\nHubble-Jeans tuning-fork diagram, (ii) caution about claims of over-massive\nblack holes in other ES galaxies if incorrectly modelled as S0 galaxies, and\n(iii) reveal that the compact massive spheroid in NGC 1271 has properties\nsimilar to bright bulges in other galaxies which have grown larger-scale disks.\n", "  Quantum simulators based on atoms or molecules often have long-range\ninteractions due to dipolar or Coulomb interactions. We present a method based\non Floquet engineering to turn a long-range interaction into a short-range one.\nBy modulating a magnetic-field gradient with one or a few frequencies, one\nreshapes the interaction profile, such that the system behaves as if it only\nhad nearest-neighbor interactions. Our approach works in both one and two\ndimensions and for both spin-1/2 and spin-1 systems. It does not require\nindividual addressing, and is applicable to all experimental systems with\nlong-range interactions: trapped ions, polar molecules, Rydberg atoms,\nnitrogen-vacancy centers, and cavity QED. Our approach allows one achieve a\nshort-range interaction without relying on Hubbard superexchange.\n", "  We present an analysis of the merging cluster MACS J1149.5+2223 using\narchival imaging from Subaru/Suprime-Cam and multi-object spectroscopy from\nKeck/DEIMOS and Gemini/GMOS. We employ two and three dimensional substructure\ntests and determine that MACS J1149.5+2223 is composed of two separate mergers\nbetween three subclusters occurring $\\sim$1 Gyr apart. The primary merger gives\nrise to elongated X-ray morphology and a radio relic in the southeast. The\nbrightest cluster galaxy is a member of the northern subcluster of the primary\nmerger. This subcluster is very massive\n(16.7$^{+\\text{1.25}}_{-\\text{1.60}}\\times\\text{10}^{\\text{14}}$ M$_{\\odot}$).\nThe southern subcluster is also very massive\n(10.8$^{+\\text{3.37}}_{-\\text{3.54}}\\times\\text{10}^{\\text{14}}$ M$_{\\odot}$),\nyet it lacks an associated X-ray surface brightness peak, and it has been\nunidentified previously despite the detailed study of this \\emph{Frontier\nField} cluster. A secondary merger is occurring in the north along the line of\nsight with a third, less massive, subcluster\n(1.20$^{+\\text{0.19}}_{-\\text{0.34}}\\times\\text{10}^{\\text{14}}$ M$_{\\odot}$).\nWe perform a Monte Carlo dynamical analysis on the main merger and estimate a\ncollision speed at pericenter of 2770$^{+\\text{610}}_{-\\text{310}}$ km\ns$^{-\\text{1}}$. We show the merger to be returning from apocenter with core\npassage occurring 1.16$^{+\\text{0.50}}_{-\\text{0.25}}$ Gyr before the observed\nstate. We identify the line of sight merging subcluster in a strong lensing\nanalysis in the literature and show that it is likely bound to MACS J1149\ndespite having reached an extreme collision velocity of $\\sim$4000 km\ns$^{-\\text{1}}$.\n", "  The new discoveries of circumbinary planetary systems shed light on the\nunderstanding of planetary system formation. Learning the architectural\nproperties of these systems is essential for constraining the different\nformation mechanisms. We first revisit the stability limit of circumbinary\nplanets. Next, we focus on eclipsing stellar binaries and obtain an analytical\nexpression for the transit probability in a realistic setting, where finite\nobservation period and planetary orbital precession are included. Then,\nunderstanding of the architectural properties of the currently observed\ntransiting systems is refined, based on Bayesian analysis and a series of\nhypothesis tests. We find 1) it is not a selection bias that the innermost\nplanets reside near the stability limit for eight of the nine observed systems,\nand this is consistent with a log uniform distribution of the planetary\nsemi-major axis; 2) it is not a selection bias that the planetary and stellar\norbits are nearly coplanar ($\\lesssim 3^\\circ$), and this together with\nprevious studies may imply an occurrence rate of circumbinary planets similar\nto that of single star systems; 3) the dominance of observed circumbinary\nsystems with only one transiting planet may be caused by selection effects; 4)\nformation mechanisms involving Lidov-Kozai oscillations, which may produce\nmisalignment and large separation between planet and stellar binaries, are\nconsistent with the lack of transiting circumbinary planets around short-period\nstellar binaries, in agreement with previous studies. As a consequence of 4),\neclipse timing variations may better suit the detection of planets in such\nconfigurations.\n", "  We report optical measurements of the spectral width of open transmission\nchannels in a three-dimensional diffusive medium. The light transmission\nthrough a sample is enhanced by efficiently coupling to open transmission\nchannels using repeated digital optical phase conjugation. The spectral\nproperties are investigated by enhancing the transmission, fixing the incident\nwavefront and scanning the wavelength of the laser. We measure the transmitted\nfield to extract the field correlation function and the enhancement of the\ntotal transmission. We find that optimizing the total transmission leads to a\nsignificant increase in the frequency width of the field correlation function.\nAdditionally we find that the enhanced transmission persists over an even\nlarger frequency bandwidth. This result shows open channels in the diffusive\nregime are spectrally much wider than previous measurements in the localized\nregime suggest.\n", "  We investigate the phase transitions of a nonlinear, parallel version of the\nIsing model, characterized by an antiferromagnetic linear coupling and\nferromagnetic nonlinear one. This model arises in problems of opinion\nformation. The mean-field approximation shows chaotic oscillations, by changing\nthe couplings or the connectivity. The spatial model shows bifurcations in the\naverage magnetization, similar to what seen in the mean-field approximation,\ninduced by the change of the topology, after rewiring short-range to long-range\nconnection, as predicted by the small-world effect. These coherent periodic and\nchaotic oscillations of the magnetization reflect a certain degree of\nsynchronization of the spins, induced by long-range couplings. Similar\nbifurcations may be induced in the randomly connected model by changing the\ncouplings or the connectivity and also the dilution (degree of asynchronism) of\nthe updating. We also examined the effects of inhomogeneity, mixing\nferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic coupling, which induces an unexpected\nbifurcation diagram with a \"bubbling\" behaviour, as also happens for dilution.\n", "  We report the discovery of an eclipsing low-mass X-ray binary at the center\nof the 3FGL error ellipse of the unassociated Fermi/Large Area Telescope\ngamma-ray source 3FGL J0427.9-6704. Photometry from OGLE and the SMARTS 1.3-m\ntelescope and spectroscopy from the SOAR telescope have allowed us to classify\nthe system as an eclipsing low-mass X-ray binary (P = 8.8 hr) with a main\nsequence donor and a neutron star accretor. Broad double-peaked H and He\nemission lines suggest the ongoing presence of an accretion disk. Remarkably,\nthe system shows shows separate sets of absorption lines associated with the\naccretion disk and the secondary, and we use their radial velocities to find\nevidence for a massive (~ 1.8-1.9 M_sun) neutron star primary. In addition to a\ntotal X-ray eclipse of duration ~ 2200 s observed with NuSTAR, the X-ray light\ncurve also shows properties similar to those observed among known transitional\nmillisecond pulsars: short-term variability, a hard power-law spectrum (photon\nindex ~ 1.7), and a comparable 0.5-10 keV luminosity (~ 2.4 x 10^33 erg/s). We\nfind tentative evidence for a partial (~ 60%) gamma-ray eclipse at the same\nphase as the X-ray eclipse, suggesting the gamma-ray emission may not be\nconfined to the immediate region of the compact object. The favorable\ninclination of this binary is promising for future efforts to determine the\norigin of gamma-rays among accreting neutron stars.\n", "  We present an analysis of the metallicity distribution of the dense\ncircumgalactic medium (CGM) of galaxies at 0.1 < z < 1.1 as probed by partial\nLyman limit systems (pLLSs, 16.1 < log N(H I) < 17.2) and LLSs (17.2 < log N(H\nI) < 17.7 in our sample). The new H I-selected sample, drawn from our HST COS\nG140L snapshot survey of 61 QSOs, has 20 pLLSs and 10 LLSs. Combined with our\nprevious survey, we have a total of 44 pLLSs and 11 LLSs. We find that the\nmetallicity distribution of the pLLSs is bimodal at z < 1, with a minimum at\n[X/H] = -1. The low-metallicity peak comprises (57 +/- 8)% of the pLLSs and is\ncentered at [X/H] ~ -1.87 (1.3% solar metallicity), while the high-metallicity\npeak is centered at [X/H] ~ -0.32 (48% solar metallicity). Although the sample\nof LLSs is still small, there is some evidence that the metallicity\ndistributions of the LLSs and pLLSs are different, with a far lower fraction of\nvery metal-poor ([X/H] < -1.4) LLSs than pLLSs. The fraction of LLSs with [X/H]\n< -1 is similar to that found in pLLSs (~56%). However, higher H I column\ndensity absorbers (log N(H I) > 19.0) show a much lower fraction of metal-poor\ngas; therefore, the metallicity distribution of gas in and around galaxies\ndepends sensitively on N(H I) at z < 1. We interpret the high-metallicity\n([X/H] > -1) pLLSs and LLSs as arising in outflows, recycling winds, and\ntidally-stripped gas around galaxies. The low-metallicity pLLSs and LLSs imply\nthat the CGM of z < 1 galaxies is also host to a substantial mass of cool,\ndense, low-metallicity gas that may ultimately accrete onto the galaxies.\n", "  Laboratory measurements are used to constrain the dielectric tensor for\ngraphite, from microwave to X-ray frequencies. The dielectric tensor is\nstrongly anisotropic even at X-ray energies. The discrete dipole approximation\nis employed for accurate calculations of absorption and scattering by\nsingle-crystal graphite spheres and spheroids. For randomly-oriented\nsingle-crystal grains, the so-called 1/3 - 2/3 approximation for calculating\nabsorption and scattering cross sections is exact in the limit a/lambda -> 0,\nprovides better than ~10% accuracy in the optical and UV even when a/lambda is\nnot small, but becomes increasingly inaccurate at infrared wavelengths, with\nerrors as large as ~40% at lambda = 10 micron. For turbostratic graphite\ngrains, the Bruggeman and Maxwell Garnett treatments yield similar cross\nsections in the optical and ultraviolet, but diverge in the infrared, with\npredicted cross sections differing by over an order of magnitude in the\nfar-infrared. It is argued that the Maxwell Garnett estimate is likely to be\nmore realistic, and is recommended. The out-of-plane lattice resonance of\ngraphite near 11.5 micron may be observable in absorption with the MIRI\nspectrograph on JWST. Aligned graphite grains, if present in the ISM, could\nproduce polarized X-ray absorption and polarized X-ray scattering near the\ncarbon K edge.\n", "  Atomistic simulations are used to study segregation-induced intergranular\nfilm formation in Cu-Zr and Cu-Nb alloys. While Cu-Zr forms structurally\ndisordered or amorphous films, ordered films comprised of a second phase\nusually precipitate in Cu-Nb, with a critical nucleation size of ~1 nm below\nwhich the ordered phase cannot form. While the ordered film is retained at high\ntemperature for a low energy {\\Sigma}11 (113) boundary, a disordering\ntransition is observed for a high energy {\\Sigma}5 (310) boundary at low dopant\nconcentrations. Finally, the effect of free surfaces on dopant segregation and\nintergranular film formation is investigated for both alloys.\n", "  Unprecedentedly precise cosmic microwave background (CMB) data are expected\nfrom ongoing and near-future CMB Stage-III and IV surveys, which will yield\nreconstructed CMB lensing maps with effective resolution approaching several\narcminutes. The small-scale CMB lensing fluctuations receive non-negligible\ncontributions from nonlinear structure in the late-time density field. These\nfluctuations are not fully characterized by traditional two-point statistics,\nsuch as the power spectrum. Here, we use $N$-body ray-tracing simulations of\nCMB lensing maps to examine two higher-order statistics: the lensing\nconvergence one-point probability distribution function (PDF) and peak counts.\nWe show that these statistics contain significant information not captured by\nthe two-point function, and provide specific forecasts for the ongoing\nStage-III Advanced Atacama Cosmology Telescope (AdvACT) experiment. Considering\nonly the temperature-based reconstruction estimator, we forecast 9$\\sigma$\n(PDF) and 6$\\sigma$ (peaks) detections of these statistics with AdvACT. Our\nsimulation pipeline fully accounts for the non-Gaussianity of the lensing\nreconstruction noise, which is significant and cannot be neglected. Combining\nthe power spectrum, PDF, and peak counts for AdvACT will tighten cosmological\nconstraints in the $\\Omega_m$-$\\sigma_8$ plane by $\\approx 30\\%$, compared to\nusing the power spectrum alone.\n", "  The CPT-even sector of the standard model extension amounts to extending\nMaxwell electrodynamics by a gauge invariant term of the form $- \\frac{1}{4} (k\n_{F}) _{\\alpha \\beta \\mu \\nu} F ^{\\alpha \\beta} F ^{\\mu \\nu}$, where the\nLorentz-violating (LV) background tensor $(k _{F}) _{\\alpha \\beta \\mu \\nu}$\npossesses the symmetries of the Riemann tensor. The electrodynamics in\nponderable media is still described by Maxwell equations in matter with\nmodified constitutive relations which depend on the coefficients for Lorentz\nviolation. We study the effects of this theory on the Casimir force between two\nsemi-infinite ponderable media. The Fresnel coefficients characterizing the\nvacuum-medium interface are derived, and with the help of these, we compute the\nCasimir energy density. At leading-order in the LV coefficients, the Casimir\nenergy density is numerically evaluated and successfully compared with the\nstandard result. We also found a variety of intriguing effects, such as a\nnon-trivial Kerr effect and the Casimir effect between two phases of the\nelectromagnetic vacuum. We consider a bubble of Lorentz-symmetric (Maxwell)\nvacuum embedded in the infinite Lorentz-violating vacuum, and we calculate the\nCasimir energy at leading order, which in this case is quadratic in the LV\ncoefficients. The Casimir force can be positive, zero, or negative, depending\non the relative strengths between the LV coefficients.\n", "  Near-Eddington accretion rates onto low-mass black holes are thought to be a\nprime driver of the multi-wavelength properties of the narrow-line Seyfert 1\n(NLS1) population of active galactic nuclei (AGN). Orientation effects have\nrepeatedly been considered as another important factor involved, but detailed\nstudies have been hampered by the lack of measured viewing angles towards this\ntype of AGN. Here we present multi-epoch, 15 GHz VLBA images (MOJAVE program)\nof the radio-loud and Fermi/LAT-detected NLS1 galaxy 1H 323+342. These are\ncombined with single-dish, multi-frequency radio monitoring of the source's\nvariability, obtained with the Effelsberg 100-m and IRAM 30-m telescopes, in\nthe course of the F-GAMMA program. The VLBA images reveal 6 components with\napparent peeds of ~1 to ~7 c, and one quasi-stationary feature. Combining the\nobtained apparent jet speed ($\\beta_{app}$) and variability Doppler factor\n($D_{var}$) estimates together with other methods, we constrain the viewing\nangle towards 1H 0323+342 to $\\theta \\leq 4 - 13$ deg. Using literature values\nof $\\beta_{app}$ and $D_{var}$, we also deduce a viewing angle of $\\leq$ 8-9\ndeg towards another radio- and {\\gamma}-ray-loud NLS1, namely SBS 0846+513.\n", "  Here we report on the results of the WEBT photo-polarimetric campaign\ntargeting the blazar S5~0716+71, organized in March 2014 to monitor the source\nsimultaneously in BVRI and near IR filters. The campaign resulted in an\nunprecedented dataset spanning $\\sim 110$\\,h of nearly continuous, multi-band\nobservations, including two sets of densely sampled polarimetric data mainly in\nR filter. During the campaign, the source displayed pronounced variability with\npeak-to-peak variations of about $30\\%$ and \"bluer-when-brighter\" spectral\nevolution, consisting of a day-timescale modulation with superimposed hourlong\nmicroflares characterized by $\\sim 0.1$\\,mag flux changes. We performed an\nin-depth search for quasi-periodicities in the source light curve; hints for\nthe presence of oscillations on timescales of $\\sim 3$\\,h and $\\sim 5$\\,h do\nnot represent highly significant departures from a pure red-noise power\nspectrum. We observed that, at a certain configuration of the optical\npolarization angle relative to the positional angle of the innermost radio jet\nin the source, changes in the polarization degree led the total flux\nvariability by about 2\\,h; meanwhile, when the relative configuration of the\npolarization and jet angles altered, no such lag could be noted. The\nmicroflaring events, when analyzed as separate pulse emission components, were\nfound to be characterized by a very high polarization degree ($> 30\\%$) and\npolarization angles which differed substantially from the polarization angle of\nthe underlying background component, or from the radio jet positional angle. We\ndiscuss the results in the general context of blazar emission and energy\ndissipation models.\n", "  Context: Active stars possess magnetized wind that has a direct impact on\nplanets that can lead to radio emission. Mercury is a good test case to study\nthe effect of the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field on radio\nemission driven in the planet magnetosphere. Such studies could be used as\nproxies to characterize the magnetic field topology and intensity of\nexoplanets. Aims: The aim of this study is to quantify the radio emission in\nthe Hermean magnetosphere. Methods: We use the MHD code PLUTO in spherical\ncoordinates with an axisymmetric multipolar expansion for the Hermean magnetic\nfield, to analyze the effect of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF)\norientation and intensity, as well as the hydrodynamic parameters of the solar\nwind (velocity, density and temperature), on the net power dissipated on the\nHermean day and night side. We apply the formalism derived by Zarka [2001,\n2007] to infer the radio emission level from the net dissipated power. We\nperform a set of simulations with different hydrodynamic parameters of the\nsolar wind, IMF orientations and intensities, that allow us to calculate the\ndissipated power distribution and infer the existence of radio emission hot\nspots on the planet day side, and to calculate the integrated radio emission of\nthe Hermean magnetosphere. Results: The obtained radio emission distribution of\ndissipated power is determined by the IMF orientation (associated with the\nreconnection regions in the magnetosphere), although the radio emission\nstrength is dependent on the IMF intensity and solar wind hydro parameters. The\ncalculated total radio emission level is in agreement with the one estimated in\n[Zarka, 2001], between $5 \\times 10^{5}$ and $2 \\times 10^{6}$ W.\n", "  The disk mass is among the most important input parameter for every planet\nformation model to determine the number and masses of the planets that can\nform. We present an ALMA 887micron survey of the disk population around objects\nfrom 2 to 0.03Msun in the nearby 2Myr-old Chamaeleon I star-forming region. We\ndetect thermal dust emission from 66 out of 93 disks, spatially resolve 34 of\nthem, and identify two disks with large dust cavities of about 45AU in radius.\nAssuming isothermal and optically thin emission, we convert the 887micron flux\ndensities into dust disk masses, hereafter Mdust. We find that the Mdust-Mstar\nrelation is steeper than linear with power law indices 1.3-1.9, where the range\nreflects two extremes of the possible relation between the average dust\ntemperature and stellar luminosity. By re-analyzing all millimeter data\navailable for nearby regions in a self-consistent way, we show that the 1-3\nMyr-old regions of Taurus, Lupus, and Chamaeleon I share the same Mdust-Mstar\nrelation, while the 10Myr-old Upper Sco association has a steeper relation.\nTheoretical models of grain growth, drift, and fragmentation reproduce this\ntrend and suggest that disks are in the fragmentation-limited regime. In this\nregime millimeter grains will be located closer in around lower-mass stars, a\nprediction that can be tested with deeper and higher spatial resolution ALMA\nobservations.\n", "  Using atomic hydrogen (HI) data from the VLA Galactic Plane Survey we measure\nthe HI terminal velocity as a function of longitude for the first quadrant of\nthe Milky Way. We use these data, together with our previous work on the fourth\nGalactic quadrant, to produce a densely sampled, uniformly measured, rotation\ncurve of the Northern and Southern Milky Way between $3~{\\rm kpc} < R < 8~{\\rm\nkpc}$. We determine a new joint rotation curve fit for the first and fourth\nquadrants, which is consistent with the fit we published in McClure-Griffiths\n\\& Dickey (2007) and can be used for estimating kinematic distances interior to\nthe solar circle. Structure in the rotation curves is now exquisitely well\ndefined, showing significant velocity structure on lengths of $\\sim 200$ pc,\nwhich is much greater than the spatial resolution of the rotation curve.\nFurthermore, the shape of the rotation curves for the first and fourth\nquadrants, even after subtraction of a circular rotation fit shows a surprising\ndegree of correlation with a roughly sinusoidal pattern between $4.2 < R < 7$\nkpc.\n", "  We prove that all inflationary models, including those with dark energy after\nthe end of inflation, can be embedded in minimal supergravity with a single\nchiral superfield. Moreover, the amount of supersymmetry breaking is\nindependently tunable due to a degeneracy in the choice for the superpotential.\nThe inflaton is a scalar partner of the Goldstino in this set-up. We illustrate\nour general procedure with two examples that are favoured by the Planck data.\n", "  We present observations at 7 mm that fully resolve the two circumstellar\ndisks, and a reanalyses of archival observations at 3.5 cm that resolve along\ntheir major axes the two ionized jets, of the class I binary protostellar\nsystem L1551 NE. We show that the two circumstellar disks are better fit by a\nshallow inner and steep outer power-law than a truncated power-law. The two\ndisks have very different transition radii between their inner and outer\nregions of $\\sim$18.6 AU and $\\sim$8.9 AU respectively. Assuming that they are\nintrinsically circular and geometrically thin, we find that the two\ncircumstellar disks are parallel with each other and orthogonal in projection\nto their respective ionized jets. Furthermore, the two disks are closely\naligned if not parallel with their circumbinary disk. Over an interval of\n$\\sim$10 yr, source B (possessing the circumsecondary disk) has moved\nnorthwards with respect to and likely away from source A, indicating an orbital\nmotion in the same direction as the rotational motion of their circumbinary\ndisk. All the aforementioned elements therefore share the same axis for their\nangular momentum, indicating that L1551 NE is a product of rotationally-driven\nfragmentation of its parental core. Assuming a circular orbit, the relative\ndisk sizes are compatible with theoretical predictions for tidal truncation by\na binary system having a mass ratio of $\\sim$0.2, in agreement with the\nreported relative separations of the two protostars from the center of their\ncircumbinary disk. The transition radii of both disks, however, are a factor of\n$\\gtrsim$1.5 smaller than their predicted tidally-truncated radii.\n", "  Graphene on an insulating ferromagnetic substrate---ferromagnetic insulator\nor ferromagnetic metal with a tunnel barrier---is expected to exhibit giant\nproximity exchange and spin-orbit couplings. We use a realistic transport model\nof charge-disorder scattering and solve the linearized Boltzmann equation\nnumerically exactly for the anisotropic Fermi contours of modified Dirac\nelectrons to find magnetotransport signatures of these proximity effects:\nproximity anisotropic magnetoresistance, inverse spin-galvanic effect, and the\nplanar Hall resistivity. We establish the corresponding anisotropies due to the\nexchange and spin-orbit couplings, with respect to the magnetization\norientation. We also present parameter maps guiding towards optimal regimes for\nobserving transport magnetoanisotropies in proximity graphene.\n", "  In present paper, we investigate the multifractality signatures in hourly\ntime series extracted from CoRoT spacecraft database. Our analysis is intended\nto highlight the possibility that astrophysical time series can be members of a\nparticular class of complex and dynamic processes which require several\nphotometric variability diagnostics to characterize their structural and\ntopological properties. To achieve this goal, we search for contributions due\nto nonlinear temporal correlation and effects caused by heavier tails than the\nGaussian distribution, using a detrending moving average algorithm for\none-dimensional multifractal signals (MFDMA). We observe that the correlation\nstructure is the main source of multifractality, while heavy-tailed\ndistribution plays a minor role in generating the multifractal effects. Our\nwork also reveals that rotation period of stars is inherently scaled by degree\nof multifractality. As a result, analyzing the multifractal degree of referred\nseries, we uncover an evolution of multifractality from shorter to larger\nperiods.\n", "  We develop a model of dust evolution in a multiphase, inhomogeneous ISM\nincluding dust growth and destruction processes. The physical conditions for\ngrain evolution are taken from hydrodynamical simulations of giant molecular\nclouds in a Milky Way-like spiral galaxy. We improve the treatment of dust\ngrowth by accretion in the ISM to investigate the role of the\ntemperature-dependent sticking coefficient and ion-grain interactions. From\ndetailed observational data on the gas-phase Si abundances [Si/H]_{gas}\nmeasured in the local Galaxy, we derive a relation between the average\n[Si/H]_{gas} and the local gas density n(H) which we use as a critical\nconstraint for the models. This relation requires a sticking coefficient that\ndecreases with the gas temperature. The synthetic relation constructed from the\nspatial dust distribution reproduces the slope of -0.5 of the observed relation\nin cold clouds. This slope is steeper than that for the warm medium and is\nexplained by the dust growth. We find that it occurs for all adopted values of\nthe minimum grain size a_{min} from 1 to 5nm. For the classical cut-off of\na_{min}=5 nm, the ion-grain interactions result in longer growth timescales and\nhigher [Si/H]_{gas} than the observed values. For a_{min} below 3 nm, the\nion-grain interactions enhance the growth rates, steepen the slope of\n[Si/H]_{gas}-n(H) relation and provide a better match to observations. The\nrates of dust re-formation in the ISM by far exceed the rates of dust\nproduction by stellar sources as expected from simple evolution models. After\nthe cycle of matter in and out of dust reaches a steady state, the dust growth\nbalances the destruction operating on similar timescales of 350 Myr.\n", "  Gas-grain and gas-phase reactions dominate the formation of molecules in the\ninterstellar medium (ISM). Gas-grain reactions require a substrate (e.g. a dust\nor ice grain) on which the reaction is able to occur. The formation of\nmolecular hydrogen (H$_2$) in the ISM is the prototypical example of a\ngas-grain reaction. In these reactions, an atom of hydrogen will strike a\nsurface, stick to it, and diffuse across it. When it encounters another\nadsorbed hydrogen atom, the two can react to form molecular hydrogen and then\nbe ejected from the surface by the energy released in the reaction. We perform\nin-depth classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of hydrogen atoms\ninteracting with an amorphous water-ice surface. This study focuses on the\nfirst step in the formation process; the sticking of the hydrogen atom to the\nsubstrate. We find that careful attention must be paid in dealing with the\nambiguities in defining a sticking event. The technical definition of a\nsticking event will affect the computed sticking probabilities and\ncoefficients. Here, using our new definition of a sticking event, we report\nsticking probabilities and sticking coefficients for nine different incident\nkinetic energies of hydrogen atoms [5 K - 400 K] across seven different\ntemperatures of dust grains [10 K - 70 K]. We find that probabilities and\ncoefficients vary both as a function of grain temperature and incident kinetic\nenergy over the range of 0.99 - 0.22.\n", "  We present Spitzer Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) photometric observations of\nthe Ultra-luminous X-ray Source (ULX, X-1) in Holmberg IX. We construct a\nspectral energy distribution (SED) for Holmberg IX X-1 based on published\noptical, UV and X-ray data combined with the IR data from this analysis. We\nmodeled the X-ray and optical data with disk and stellar models, however we\nfind a clear IR excess in the ULX SED that cannot be explained by fits or\nextrapolations of any of these models. Instead, further analysis suggests that\nthe IR excess results either from dust emission, possibly from a circumbinary\ndisk or from a variable jet.\n", "  The adaptive module of the 4.1-m SOAR telescope, SAM, corrects ground-layer\nturbulence using a UV laser guide star. It has been commissioned in 2013 and it\nis in regular science operation since 2014. SAM works with the CCD imager\ncovering a 3' field or with the speckle camera. It operates routinely and\nstably, delivering resolution in the I band equal to the free-atmosphere\nseeing. This paper describes the SAM system as a whole, providing essential\nreference for its users and technical information of interest to\ninstrumentalists. Operation of the instrument, its performance, and science\nprojects done with SAM so far are reviewed.\n", "  We report a photometric study of globular clusters (GCs), ultracompact dwarfs\n(UCDs), and dwarf galaxies in the giant merging galaxy cluster Abell 2744 at z\n= 0.308. Color-magnitude diagrams of the point sources derived from deep F814W\n(restframe r') and F105W (restframe I) images of Abell 2744 in the Hubble Space\nTelescope Frontier Field show a rich population of point sources whose colors\nare similar to those of typical GCs. These sources are as bright as -14.9 <\nM_r' < -11.4 (26.0 < F814W < 29.5) mag, being mostly UCDs and bright GCs in\nAbell 2744. The luminosity function (LF) of these sources shows a break at M_r'\n~ -12.9 (F814W ~ 28.0) mag, indicating a boundary between UCDs and bright GCs.\nThe numbers of GCs and UCDs are estimated to be N_GC = 385,000+-24,000, and 147\n+- 26, respectively. The clustercentric radial number density profiles of the\nUCDs and bright GCs show similar slopes, but these profiles are much steeper\nthan that of the dwarf galaxies and the mass density profile based on\ngravitational lensing analysis. We derive an LF of the red sequence galaxies\nfor -22.9 < M_r' < -13.9 mag. The faint end of this LF is fit well by a flat\npower law with a = -1.14 +- 0.08, showing no faint upturn. These results\nsupport the galaxy-origin scenario for bright UCDs: they are the nuclei of\ndwarf galaxies that were stripped when they pass close to the center of massive\ngalaxies or a galaxy cluster, while some of the faint UCDs are the bright end\nof the GCs.\n", "  This paper deals with the properties of the stochastic generators of the\neffective (driven) processes associated with atypical values of\ntransition-dependent time-integrated currents with Gallavotti-Cohen symmetry in\nMarkov jump processes. Exploiting the concept of biased ensemble of\ntrajectories by introducing a biasing field $s$, we show that the stochastic\ngenerators of the effective processes associated with the biasing fields $s$\nand $E-s$ are enantiodromic with respect to each other where $E$ is the\nconjugated field to the current. We illustrate our findings by considering an\nexactly solvable creation-annihilation process of classical particles with\nnearest-neighbor interactions defined on a one-dimensional lattice.\n", "  The problem of estimating non-resonant astrophysical S-factors and\nthermonuclear reaction rates, based on measured nuclear cross sections, is of\nmajor interest for nuclear energy generation, neutrino physics, and element\nsynthesis. Many different methods have been applied in the past to this\nproblem, almost all of them based on traditional statistics. Bayesian methods,\non the other hand, are now in widespread use in the physical sciences. In\nastronomy, for example, Bayesian statistics is applied to the observation of\nextra-solar planets, gravitational waves, and type Ia supernovae. However,\nnuclear physics, in particular, has been slow to adopt Bayesian methods. We\npresent astrophysical S-factors and reaction rates based on Bayesian\nstatistics. We develop a framework that incorporates robust parameter\nestimation, systematic effects, and non-Gaussian uncertainties in a consistent\nmanner. The method is applied to the d(p,$\\gamma$)$^3$He,\n$^3$He($^3$He,2p)$^4$He, and $^3$He($\\alpha$,$\\gamma$)$^7$Be reactions,\nimportant for deuterium burning, solar neutrinos, and big bang nucleosynthesis.\n", "  White-light (WL) flares have been observed and studied more than a century\nsince the first discovery. However, some fundamental physics behind the\nbrilliant emission remains highly controversial. One of the important facts in\naddressing the flare energetics is the spatialtemporal correlation between the\nwhite-light emission and the hard X-ray radiation, presumably suggesting that\nthe energetic electrons are the energy sources. In this study, we present a\nstatistical analysis of 25 strong flares (?greater than or equal to M5)\nobserved simultaneously by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board\nthe Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar\nSpectroscopic Imager (RHESSI). Among these events, WL emission was detected by\nSDO/HMI in 13 flares, associated with HXR emission. To quantitatively describe\nthe strength of WL emission, equivalent area (EA) is defined as the integrated\ncontrast enhancement over the entire flaring area. Our results show that the\nequivalent area is inversely proportional to the HXR power index, indicating\nthat stronger WL emission tends to be associated with larger population of high\nenergy electrons. However, no obvious correlation is found between WL emission\nand flux of non-thermal electrons at 50 keV. For the other group of 13 flares\nwithout detectable WL emission, the HXR spectra are softer (larger power index)\nthan those flares with WL emission, especially for the X-class flares in this\ngroup.\n", "  We formulate and prove a toy version of the Penrose inequality. The\nformulation mimics the original Penrose inequality in which the scenario is the\nfollowing: A shell of null dust collapses in Minkowski space and a marginally\ntrapped surface forms on it. Through a series of arguments relying on\nestablished assumptions, an inequality relating the area of this surface to the\ntotal energy of the shell is formulated. Then a further reformulation turns the\ninequality into a statement relating the area and the outer null expansion of a\nclass of surfaces in Minkowski space itself. The inequality has been proven to\nhold true in many special cases, but there is no proof in general. In the toy\nversion here presented, an analogous inequality in (2+1)-dimensional anti-de\nSitter space turns out to hold true.\n", "  Transient X-ray binaries produce major outbursts in which the X-ray flux can\nincrease over the quiescent level by factors as large as $10^7$. The low-mass\nX-ray binary V 404 Cyg and the high-mass system 4U 0115+634 underwent such\nmajor outbursts in June and October 2015, respectively. We present here\nobservations at energies above hundreds of GeV with the VERITAS observatory\ntaken during some of the brightest X-ray activity ever observed from these\nsystems. No gamma-ray emission has been detected by VERITAS in 2.5 hours of\nobservations of the microquasar V 404 Cyg from 2015, June 20-21. The upper flux\nlimits derived from these observations on the gamma-ray flux above 200 GeV of F\n$< 4.4\\times 10^{-12}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ correspond to a tiny fraction (about\n$10^{-6}$) of the Eddington luminosity of the system, in stark contrast to that\nseen in the X-ray band. No gamma rays have been detected during observations of\n4U 0115+634 in the period of major X-ray activity in October 2015. The flux\nupper limit derived from our observations is F $< 2.1\\times 10^{-12}$ cm$^{-2}$\ns$^{-1}$ for gamma rays above 300 GeV, setting an upper limit on the ratio of\ngamma-ray to X-ray luminosity of less than 4%.\n", "  Isotopic ratios of heavy elements are a key signature of the nucleosynthesis\nprocesses in stellar interiors. The contribution of successive generations of\nstars to the metal enrichment of the Universe is imprinted on the evolution of\nisotopic ratios over time. We investigate the isotopic ratios of carbon,\nnitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur through millimeter molecular absorption lines\narising in the z=0.68 absorber toward the blazar B 0218+357. We find that these\nratios differ from those observed in the Galactic interstellar medium, but are\nremarkably close to those in the only other source at intermediate redshift for\nwhich isotopic ratios have been measured to date, the z=0.89 absorber in front\nof PKS1830-211. The isotopic ratios in these two absorbers should reflect\nenrichment mostly from massive stars, and they are indeed close to the values\nobserved toward local starburst galaxies. Our measurements set constraints on\nnucleosynthesis and chemical evolution models.\n", "  We investigate the possible presence of diffuse radio emission in the\nintermediate redshift, massive cluster PLCK G285.0-23.7 (z=0.39, M_500 = 8.39 x\n10^(14) M_Sun). Our 16cm-band ATCA observations of PLCK G285.0-23.7 allow us to\nreach a rms noise level of ~11 microJy/beam on the wide-band (1.1-3.1 GHz),\nfull-resolution (~5 arcsec) image of the cluster, making it one of the deepest\nATCA images yet published. We also re-image visibilities at lower resolution in\norder to achieve a better sensitivity to low-surface-brightness extended radio\nsources. We detect one of the lowest luminosity radio halos known at z>0.35,\ncharacterised by a slight offset from the well-studied 1.4 GHz radio power vs.\ncluster mass correlation. Similarly to most known radio-loud clusters (i.e.\nthose hosting diffuse non-thermal sources), PLCK G285.0-23.7 has a disturbed\ndynamical state. Our analysis reveals a similarly elongated X-ray and radio\nmorphology. While the size of the radio halo in PLCK G285.0-23.7 is smaller\nthan lower redshift radio-loud clusters in the same mass range, it shows a\nsimilar correlation with the cluster virial radius, as expected in the\nframework of hierarchical structure formation.\n", "  The emergence of coherent quantum feedback control (CQFC) as a new paradigm\nfor precise manipulation of dynamics of complex quantum systems has led to the\ndevelopment of efficient theoretical modeling and simulation tools and opened\navenues for new practical implementations. This work explores the applicability\nof the integrated silicon photonics platform for implementing scalable CQFC\nnetworks. If proven successful, on-chip implementations of these networks would\nprovide scalable and efficient nanophotonic components for autonomous quantum\ninformation processing devices and ultra-low-power optical processing systems\nat telecommunications wavelengths. We analyze the strengths of the silicon\nphotonics platform for CQFC applications and identify the key challenges to\nboth the theoretical formalism and experimental implementations. In particular,\nwe determine specific extensions to the theoretical CQFC framework (which was\noriginally developed with bulk-optics implementations in mind), required to\nmake it fully applicable to modeling of linear and nonlinear integrated optics\nnetworks. We also report the results of a preliminary experiment that studied\nthe performance of an in situ controllable silicon nanophotonic network of two\ncoupled cavities and analyze the properties of this device using the CQFC\nformalism.\n", "  The CoRoT faint stars channel observed about 163 600 targets to detect\ntransiting planetary companions. Because CoRoT targets are faint (11< r <16)\nand close to the galactic plane, only a small subsample has been observed\nspectroscopically. We describe the latest classification scheme used to derive\nthe spectral type of CoRoT targets, which is based on broadband multi-colour\nphotometry. We assess the accuracy of this spectral classification for the\nfirst time. We find that the classification method performs better for stars\nthat were observed during the mission-dedicated photometric ground-based\ncampaigns.The luminosity class is wrong for less than 7% of the targets.\nGenerally, the effective temperature of stars classified as early type (O, B,\nand A) is overestimated. Conversely, the temperature of stars classified as\nlater type tends to be underestimated. This is mainly due to the adverse effect\nof interstellar reddening. We find that the median error on the effective\ntemperature is less than 5% for dwarf stars classified with a spectral later\nthan F0, but it is worse for earlier type stars, with up to 20\\% error for A\nand late-B dwarfs, and up to 70% for early-B and O-type dwarfs. Similar results\nare found for giants, with a median error that is lower than 7% for G- and\nlater type giants, but greater than 25% for earlier types. Overall, we find an\naverage median absolute temperature difference |Delta Teff| = 533+\\-6 K for the\nwhole sample of stars classified as dwarfs and |Delta Teff| = 280+\\-3 K for the\nwhole sample of giant stars. The corresponding standard deviation is of about\n92+\\-5 K for dwarfs and 304+\\-4 K for giants. Typically for late-type stars,\nthis means that the classification is accurate to about half a class.\n", "  Digital images of the observations printed in the books \"Rosa Ursina sive\nsolis\" and \"Prodromus pro sole mobili\" by Christoph Scheiner as well as the\ndrawings from Scheiner's letters to Marcus Welser are analysed in order to\nobtain information on positions and sizes of sunspots that appeared before the\nMaunder minimum. In most cases, the given orientation of the ecliptic is used\nto set up the heliographic coordinate system for the drawings. Positions and\nsizes are measured manually on the screen. Very early drawings have no\nindication of their orientation. A rotational matching using common spots of\nadjacent days is used in some cases, while in other cases, the assumption of\nimages being aligned with a zenith-horizon coordinate system appeared to be the\nmost probable. In total, 8167 sunspots were measured. A distribution of sunspot\nlatitudes versus time (butterfly diagram) is obtained for Scheiner's\nobservations. The observations of 1611 are very inaccurate, the drawings of\n1612 have at least an indication of their orientation, while the remaining part\nof the spot positions from 1618-1631 have good to very good accuracy. We also\ncomputed 697 tilt angles of apparently bipolar sunspot groups observed in the\nperiod 1618-1631. We find that the average tilt angle of nearly 4 degrees is\nnot significantly different from 20th-century values.\n", "  With 91 months of the publicly available Fermi-LAT Pass 8 data, we analyze\nthe gamma-ray emission from the Milky Way satellites to search for potential\nline signals due to the annihilation of dark matter particles into double\nphotons. The searched targets include a sample of dwarf spheroidal galaxies,\nthe Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). No\nsignificant line emission has been found neither in the stacked dwarf galaxy\nsample nor in the direction of LMC/SMC. The corresponding upper limits on the\ncross section of DM annihilation into two photons are derived. Compared with\nresults of previous gamma-ray line searches with the Pass 7 data, the current\nconstraints on the line emission from dwarf spheroidal galaxies has been\nsignificantly improved in a wide energy range. With the rapid increase of the\nsample of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (candidates), we expect that the\nsensitivity of gamma ray line searches will be significantly improved in the\nnear future.\n", "  We analyse the experiment by Hultgren et al. [Phys. Rev. A {\\bf 87}, 031404\n(2013)] on orbital alignment and quantum beats in coherently excited atomic\nfine-structure manifolds produced by short-pulse laser photodetachment of\nC$^-$, Si$^-$ and Ge$^-$ negative ions, and derive a formula that describes the\nbeats. Analysis of the experimental data enables us to extract the non-coherent\nbackground contribution for each species, and indicates the need for a full\ndensity matrix treatment of the problem.\n", "  We report on XMM-Newton/Chandra/Swift/HST observations of the ultraluminous\nX-ray source (ULX) in NGC 247, which is found to make transitions between the\nsupersoft ultraluminous (SSUL) regime with a spectrum dominated by a cool\n($\\sim 0.1$ keV) blackbody component and the soft ultraluminous (SUL) regime\nwith comparable luminosities shared by the blackbody and power-law components.\nMulti-epoch observations revealed an anti-correlation between the blackbody\nradius and temperature, $R_{\\rm bb} \\propto T_{\\rm bb}^{-2.8 \\pm 0.3}$, ruling\nout a standard accretion disk as the origin of the soft X-ray emission. The\nsoft X-ray emission is much more variable on both short and long timescales in\nthe SSUL regime than in the SUL regime. We suggest that the SSUL regime may be\nan extension of the ultraluminous state toward the high accretion end, being an\nextreme case of the SUL regime, with the blackbody emission arising from the\nphotosphere of thick outflows and the hard X-rays being emission leaked from\nthe embedded accretion disk via the central low-density funnel or advected\nthrough the wind. However, the scenario that the supersoft ULXs are standard\nULXs viewed nearly edge-on cannot be ruled out. Flux dips on a timescale of 200\ns were observed. The dips cannot be explained by an increase of absorption, but\ncould be due to the change of accretion rate or related to thermal fluctuations\nin the wind or disk. The optical emission of NGC 247 ULX exhibits a blackbody\nspectrum at a temperature of 19,000 K with a radius of 20 $R_\\odot$, likely\narising from an OB supergiant companion star.\n", "  Direct detection and spectroscopy of exoplanets requires high contrast\nimaging. For habitable exoplanets in particular, located at small angular\nseparation from the host star, it is crucial to employ small inner working\nangle (IWA) coronagraphs that efficiently suppress starlight. These\ncoronagraphs, in turn, require careful control of the wavefront which directly\nimpacts their performance. For ground-based telescopes, atmospheric refraction\nis also an important factor, since it results in a smearing of the PSF, that\ncan no longer be efficiently suppressed by the coronagraph. Traditionally,\natmospheric refraction is compensated for by an atmospheric dispersion\ncompensator (ADC). ADC control relies on an a priori model of the atmosphere\nwhose parameters are solely based on the pointing of the telescope, which can\nresult in imperfect compensation. For a high contrast instrument like the\nSubaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics (SCExAO) system, which employs\nvery small IWA coronagraphs, refraction-induced smearing of the PSF has to be\nless than 1 mas in the science band for optimum performance. In this paper, we\npresent the first on-sky measurement and correction of residual atmospheric\ndispersion. Atmospheric dispersion is measured from the science image directly,\nusing an adaptive grid of artificially introduced speckles as a diagnostic to\nfeedback to the telescope's ADC. With our current setup, we were able to reduce\nthe initial residual atmospheric dispersion from 18.8 mas to 4.2 in broadband\nlight (y- to H-band), and to 1.4 mas in H-band only. This work is particularly\nrelevant to the upcoming extremely large telescopes (ELTs) that will require\nfine control of their ADC to reach their full high contrast imaging potential.\n", "  Kinetic mixing is a fundamental property of models with a gauge symmetry\ninvolving several $\\mathrm{U}(1)$ group factors. In this paper, we perform a\nnumerical study of the impact of kinetic mixing on beta functions at two-loop.\nTo do so, we use the recently published PyR@TE 2 software to derive the\ncomplete set of RGEs of the SM B-L model at two-loop including kinetic mixing.\nWe show that it is important to properly account for kinetic mixing as the\nevolution of the parameters with the energy scale can change drastically. In\nsome cases, these modifications can even lead to a different conclusion\nregarding the stability of the scalar potential.\n", "  The timescale of cluster formation is an essential parameter in order to\nunderstand the formation process of star clusters. Pre-main sequence (PMS)\nstars in nearby young open clusters reveal a large spread in brightness. If the\nspread were considered as a result of a real spread in age, the corresponding\ncluster formation timescale would be about 5 -- 20 Myr. Hence it could be\ninterpreted that star formation in an open cluster is prolonged for up to a few\ntens of Myr. However, difficulties in reddening correction, observational\nerrors, and systematic uncertainties introduced by imperfect evolutionary\nmodels for PMS stars, can result in an artificial age spread. Alternatively, we\ncan utilize Li abundance as a relative age indicator of PMS star to determine\nthe cluster formation timescale. The optical spectra of 134 PMS stars in NGC\n2264 have been obtained with MMT/Hectochelle. The equivalent widths have been\nmeasured for 86 PMS stars with a detectable Li line (3500 < T_eff [K] <= 6500).\nLi abundance under the condition of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) was\nderived using the conventional curve of growth method. After correction for\nnon-LTE effects, we find that the initial Li abundance of NGC 2264 is A(Li) =\n3.2 +/- 0.2. From the distribution of the Li abundances, the underlying age\nspread of the visible PMS stars is estimated to be about 3 -- 4 Myr and this,\ntogether with the presence of embedded populations in NGC 2264, suggests that\nthe cluster formed on a timescale shorter than 5 Myr.\n", "  We performed a spectral line survey called Exploring Molecular Complexity\nwith ALMA (EMoCA) toward Sagittarius~B2(N) between 84.1 and 114.4 GHz with the\nAtacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in its Cycles 0 and 1. We\ndetermined line intensities of n-propyl cyanide in the ground vibrational\nstates of its gauche and anti conformers toward the hot molecular core\nSagittarius B2(N2) which suggest that we should also be able to detect\ntransitions pertaining to excited vibrational states. We wanted to determine\nspectroscopic parameters of low-lying vibrational states of both conformers of\nn-propyl cyanide to search for them in our ALMA data. We recorded laboratory\nrotational spectra of n-propyl cyanide in two spectral windows between 36 and\n127 GHz. We searched for emission lines produced by these states in the ALMA\nspectrum of Sagittarius B2(N2). We modeled their emission and the emission of\nthe ground vibrational states assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE).\nWe have made extensive assignments of a- and b-type transitions of the four\nlowest vibrational states of the gauche conformer which reach J and Ka quantum\nnumbers of 65 and 20, respectively. We assigned mostly a-type transitions for\nthe anti conformer with J and Ka quantum numbers up to 48 and 24, respectively.\nRotational and Fermi perturbations between two anti states allowed us to\ndetermine their energy difference. The resulting spectroscopic parameters\nenabled us to identify transitions of all four vibrational states of each\nconformer in our ALMA data. The emission features of all states, including the\nground vibrational state, are well-reproduced with the same LTE modeling\nparameters, which gives us confidence in the reliability of the\nidentifications, even for the states with only one clearly detected line.\n", "  We perform long-term ($\\approx 15$ yr, observed-frame) X-ray variability\nanalyses of the 68 brightest radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the 6\nMs $Chandra$ Deep Field-South (CDF-S) survey; the majority are in the redshift\nrange of $0.6-3.1$, providing access to penetrating rest-frame X-rays up to\n$\\approx 10-30$ keV. Twenty-four of the 68 sources are optical spectral type I\nAGNs, and the rest (44) are type II AGNs. The time scales probed in this work\nare among the longest for X-ray variability studies of distant AGNs.\nPhotometric analyses reveal widespread photon-flux variability: $90\\%$ of AGNs\nare variable above a 95% confidence level, including many X-ray obscured AGNs\nand several optically classified type II quasars. We characterize the intrinsic\nX-ray luminosity ($L_{\\rm{X}}$) and absorption ($N_{\\rm{H}}$) variability via\nspectral fitting. Most (74%) sources show $L_{\\rm{X}}$ variability; the\nvariability amplitudes are generally smaller for quasars. A Compton-thick\ncandidate AGN shows variability of its high-energy X-ray flux, indicating the\nsize of reflecting material to be $\\lesssim 0.3$ pc. $L_{\\rm{X}}$ variability\nis also detected in a broad absorption line (BAL) quasar. The $N_{\\rm{H}}$\nvariability amplitude for our sample appears to rise as time separation\nincreases. About 16% of sources show $N_{\\rm{H}}$ variability. One source\ntransitions from an X-ray unobscured to obscured state while its optical\nclassification remains type I; this behavior indicates the X-ray eclipsing\nmaterial is not large enough to obscure the whole broad-line region.\n", "  In this paper we present results from a series of hydrodynamical tests aimed\nat validating the performance of a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH)\nformulation in which gradients are derived from an integral approach. We\nspecifically investigate the code behavior with subsonic flows, where it is\nwell known that zeroth-order inconsistencies present in standard SPH make it\nparticularly problematic to correctly model the fluid dynamics. In particular\nwe consider the Gresho-Chan vortex problem, the growth of Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstabilities, the statistics of driven subsonic turbulence and the cold\nKeplerian disc problem. We compare simulation results for the different tests\nwith those obtained, for the same initial conditions, using standard SPH. We\nalso compare the results with the corresponding ones obtained previously with\nother numerical methods, such as codes based on a moving-mesh scheme or\nGodunov-type Lagrangian meshless methods. We quantify code performances by\nintroducing error norms and spectral properties of the particle distribution,\nin a way similar to what was done in other works. We find that the new SPH\nformulation exhibits strongly reduced gradient errors and outperforms standard\nSPH in all of the tests considered. In fact, in terms of accuracy we find good\nagreement between the simulation results of the new scheme and those produced\nusing other recently proposed numerical schemes. These findings suggest that\nthe proposed method can be successfully applied for many astrophysical problems\nin which the presence of subsonic flows previously limited the use of SPH, with\nthe new scheme now being competitive in these regimes with other numerical\nmethods.\n", "  Citations between scientific papers and related bibliometric indices, such as\nthe $h$-index for authors and the impact factor for journals, are being\nincreasingly used - often in controversial ways - as quantitative tools for\nresearch evaluation. Yet, a fundamental research question remains still open:\nto which extent do quantitative metrics capture the significance of scientific\nworks? We analyze the network of citations among the $449,935$ papers published\nby the American Physical Society (APS) journals between 1893 and 2009, and\nfocus on the comparison of metrics built on the citation count with\nnetwork-based metrics. We contrast five article-level metrics with respect to\nthe rankings that they assign to a set of fundamental papers, called Milestone\nLetters, carefully selected by the APS editors for \"making long-lived\ncontributions to physics, either by announcing significant discoveries, or by\ninitiating new areas of research\". A new metric, which combines PageRank\ncentrality with the explicit requirement that paper score is not biased by\npaper age, is the best-performing metric overall in identifying the Milestone\nLetters. The lack of time bias in the new metric makes it also possible to use\nit to compare papers of different age on the same scale. We find that\nnetwork-based metrics identify the Milestone Letters better than metrics based\non the citation count, which suggests that the structure of the citation\nnetwork contains information that can be used to improve the ranking of\nscientific publications. The methods and results presented here are relevant\nfor all evolving systems where network centrality metrics are applied, for\nexample the World Wide Web and online social networks. An interactive Web\nplatform where it is possible to view the ranking of the APS papers by rescaled\nPageRank is available at the address \\url{http://www.sciencenow.info}.\n", "  The mesosphere of Venus is a critical range of altitudes in which complex\ntemperature variability has been extensively studied by the space mission Venus\nExpress (Vex) during its eight-years mission (2006-2014). Data collected at\ndifferent epochs and latitudes show evidence of short and medium timescale\nvariability as well as latitudinal differences. Spatial and temporal\nvariability is also predicted in mesospheric and thermosphere terminator models\nwith lower boundary conditions at 70 km near cloud tops. The Venus transit on\nJune 5-6 2012 was the first to occur with a spacecraft in orbit around Venus.\nIt has been shown that sunlight refraction in the mesosphere of Venus is able\nto provide useful constraints on mesospheric temperatures at the time of the\ntransit. The European Space Agency's Venus Express provided space-based\nobservations of Venus during the transit. Simultaneously, the Venus aureole\nphotometry was observed using ground-based facilities and solar telescopes\norbiting Earth (NASA Solar Dynamic Observatory, JAXA HINODE). As the properties\nof spatial and temporal variability of the mesosphere are still debated, the\nopportunity of observing it at all latitudes at the same time, offered by the\ntransit, is rather unique. In this first paper, we establish new methods for\nanalyzing the photometry of the so-called aureole that is produced by\nrefraction of the solar light, and we investigate the choice of physical models\nthat best reproduce the observations. We obtain an independent constraint of\n4.8 +/- 0.5 km for the aerosol scale height in the upper haze region above 80\nkm. We show that a full multiple-layer approach is required to adequately\nreproduce the aureole photometry, which appears to be sensitive to several\nsecond-order variations in the vertical refractivity.\n", "  High-resolution spectra of the magnetic star HD191612 were acquired using the\nChandra X-ray observatory at both maximum and minimum emission phases. We\nconfirm the flux and hardness variations previously reported with XMM-Newton,\ndemonstrating the great repeatability of the behavior of HD191612 over a\ndecade. The line profiles appear typical for magnetic massive stars: no\nsignificant line shift, relatively narrow lines for high-Z elements, and\nformation radius at about 2R*. Line ratios confirm the softening of the X-ray\nspectrum at the minimum emission phase. Shift or width variations appear of\nlimited amplitude at most (slightly lower velocity and slightly increased\nbroadening at minimum emission phase, but within 1--2 sigma of values at\nmaximum). In addition, a fully self-consistent 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)\nsimulation of the confined wind in HD191612 was performed. The simulation\nresults were directly fitted to the data leading to a remarkable agreement\noverall between them.\n", "  Most of the work done in the field of Bose-Einstein condensates with balanced\ngain and loss has been performed in the mean-field approximation using the\nPT-symmetric Gross-Pitaevskii equation. In this work we study the many-particle\ndynamics of a two-mode condensate with balanced gain and loss described by a\nmaster equation in Lindblad form whose purity periodically drops to small\nvalues but then is nearly completely restored. This effect cannot be covered by\nthe mean-field approximation, in which a completely pure condensate is assumed.\nWe present analytic solutions for the dynamics in the non-interacting limit and\nuse the Bogoliubov backreaction method to discuss the influence of the on-site\ninteraction. Our main result is that the strength of the purity revivals is\nalmost exclusively determined by the strength of the gain and loss and is\nindependent of the amount of particles in the system and the interaction\nstrength. For larger particle numbers, however, strong revivals are shifted\ntowards longer times, but by increasing the interaction strength these strong\nrevivals again occur earlier.\n", "  We explore the rates of tidal disruption events (TDEs) of stars by\nsupermassive black holes (SBHs) in galactic nuclei formed in mergers followed\nby a formation and coalescence of a binary SBH. Such systems initially have a\ndeficit of stars on low-angular-momentum orbits caused by the slingshot process\nduring the binary SBH stage, which tends to reduce the flux of stars into the\nSBH compared to the steady-state value. On the other hand, a newly formed\ngalactic nucleus has a non-spherical shape which enhances the mixing of stars\nin angular momentum and thus the TDE rate. In galaxies with relatively low SBH\nmasses (<10^7 Msun), relaxation times are short enough to wash out the\nanisotropy in initial conditions, and for more massive SBH the enhancement of\nflux due to non-sphericity turns out to be more important than its suppression\ndue to initial anisotropy. Therefore, the present-day TDE rates generally\nexceed conventional steady-state estimates based on a spherical isotropic\napproximation. We thus conjecture that the lower observationally inferred TDE\nrates compared to theoretical predictions cannot be attributed to the depletion\nof low-angular-momentum stars by SBH binaries.\n", "  An important aspect of searching for exoplanets is understanding the binarity\nof the host stars. It is particularly important because nearly half of the\nsolar-like stars within our own Milky Way are part of binary or multiple\nsystems. Moreover, the presence of two or more stars within a system can place\nfurther constraints on planetary formation, evolution, and orbital dynamics. As\npart of our survey of almost a hundred host stars, we obtained images at 692 nm\nand 880 nm bands using the Differential Speckle Survey Instrument (DSSI) at the\nGemini-North Observatory. From our survey, we detect stellar companions to HD\n2638 and HD 164509. The stellar companion to HD 2638 has been previously\ndetected, but the companion to HD 164509 is a newly discovered companion. The\nangular separation for HD 2638 is $0.512 \\pm 0.002\\arcsec$ and for HD 164509 is\n$0.697 \\pm 0.002\\arcsec$. This corresponds to a projected separation of $25.6\n\\pm 1.9$ AU and $36.5 \\pm 1.9$ AU, respectively. By employing stellar isochrone\nmodels, we estimate the mass of the stellar companions of HD 2638 and HD 164509\nto be $0.483 \\pm 0.007$ $M_\\sun$ and $0.416 \\pm 0.007$ $M_\\sun$, respectively,\nand their effective temperatures to be $3570 \\pm 8$~K and $3450 \\pm 7$~K,\nrespectively. These results are consistent with the detected companions being\nlate-type M dwarfs.\n", "  We present the new release v2.0 of T-PHOT, a publicly available software\npackage developed to perform PSF-matched, prior-based, multiwavelength\ndeconfusion photometry of extragalactic fields. New features included in the\ncode are presented and discussed: background estimation, fitting using position\ndependent kernels, flux prioring, diagnostical statistics on the residual\nimage, exclusion of selected sources from the model and residual images,\nindividual registration of fitted objects. These new options improve on the\nperformance of the code, allowing for more accurate results and providing\nuseful aids for diagnostics.\n", "  During the past decades, quantum mechanical methods have undergone an amazing\ntransition from pioneering investigations of experts into a wide range of\npractical applications, made by a vast community of researchers. First\nprinciples calculations of systems containing up to a few hundred atoms have\nbecome a standard in many branches of science. The sizes of the systems which\ncan be simulated have increased even further during recent years, and\nquantum-mechanical calculations of systems up to many thousands of atoms are\nnowadays possible. This opens up new appealing possibilities, in particular for\ninterdisciplinary work, bridging together communities of different needs and\nsensibilities. In this review we will present the current status of this topic,\nand will also give an outlook on the vast multitude of applications, challenges\nand opportunities stimulated by electronic structure calculations, making this\nfield an important working tool and bringing together researchers of many\ndifferent domains.\n", "  The partial transpose (PT) is an important function for entanglement testing\nand quantification and also for the study of geometrical aspects of the quantum\nstate space. In this article, considering general bipartite and multipartite\ndiscrete systems, explicit formulas ready for the numerical implementation of\nthe PT and of related entanglement functions are presented and the Fortran code\nproduced for that purpose is described. What is more, we obtain an analytical\nexpression for the Hilbert-Schmidt entanglement of two-qudit systems and for\nthe associated closest separable state. In contrast to previous works on this\nmatter, we only use the properties of the PT, not applying Lagrange\nmultipliers.\n", "  Double trace deformations, that is products of two local operators, define\nperturbations of conformal field theories that can be studied exactly in the\nlarge-N limit. Even when the double trace deformation is irrelevant in the\ninfrared, it is believed to flow to an ultraviolet fixed point. In this note we\ndefine the Kallen-Lehmann representation of the two-point function of a local\noperator O in a theory perturbed by the square of such operator. We use such\nrepresentation to discover potential pathologies at intermediate points in the\nflow that may prevent to reach the UV fixed point. We apply the method to an\n\"extremal\" deformation that naively would flow to a UV fixed point where the\noperator O would saturate the unitarity bound. We find that the UV fixed point\nis not conformal and that the deformed two-point function propagates unphysical\nmodes. We interpret the result as showing that the flow to the UV fixed point\ndoes not exist. This resolves a potential puzzle in the holographic\ninterpretation of the deformation.\n", "  The properties of submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) that are fainter than the\nconfusion limit of blank-field single-dish surveys ($S_{850} \\lesssim$ 2 mJy)\nare poorly constrained. Using a newly developed color selection technique,\nOptical-Infrared Triple Color (OIRTC), that has been shown to successfully\n{select} such faint SMGs, we identify a sample of 2938 OIRTC-selected galaxies,\ndubbed Triple Color Galaxies (TCGs), in the UKIDSS-UDS field. We show that\nthese galaxies have a median 850 $\\mu$m flux of S$_{850} = 0.96\\pm0.04$ mJy\n(equivalent to a star-formation rate SFR $\\sim60-100$ M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ based\non SED fitting), representing the first large sample of faint SMGs that bridges\nthe gap between bright SMGs and normal star-forming galaxies in S$_{850}$ and\n$L_{\\rm IR}$. We assess the basic properties of TCGs and their relationship\nwith other galaxy populations at $z\\sim2$. We measure the two-point\nautocorrelation function for this population and derive a typical halo mass of\nlog$_{10}$(M$_{\\rm halo}$) $=12.9^{+0.2}_{-0.3}$, $12.7^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$, and\n$12.9^{+0.2}_{-0.3}$ $h^{-1}$M$_\\odot$ at $z=1-2$, $2-3$, and $3-5$,\nrespectively. Together with the bright SMGs (S$_{850} \\gtrsim 2$ mJy) and a\ncomparison sample of less far-infrared luminous star-forming galaxies, we find\na lack of dependence between spatial clustering and S$_{850}$ (or SFR),\nsuggesting that the difference between these populations may lie in their local\ngalactic environment. Lastly, on the scale of $\\sim8-17$ kpc at $1<z<5$ we find\na tentative enhancement of the clustering of TCGs over the comparison\nstar-forming galaxies, suggesting that some faint SMGs are physically\nassociated pairs, perhaps reflecting a merging origin in their triggering.\n", "  We calculate orbital spin-dependent magnetization in a two-dimensional\nelectron gas with spin-orbit interaction of Rashba type. Such an orbital\nmagnetization is admitted by the time-reversal symmetry of the system, and\ngives rise to spin currents when the system is not in thermal equilibrium. The\ntheoretical approach is based on the linear response theory and the Matsubara\nGreen's function formalism. To account for the spin-resolved orbital\nmagnetization a spin-dependent vector potential has been introduced. The spin\ncurrents which appear in thermal nonequilibrium due to the spin-resolved\norbital magnetization play an important role in the spin Nernst effect, and\nhave to be included in order to correctly describe the low-temperature spin\nNernst conductivity.\n", "  Since the orbital insertion of the Rosetta spacecraft, comet\n67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P/C-G) has been mapped by OSIRIS camera and VIRTIS\nspectro-imager, producing a huge quantity of images and spectra of the comet's\nnucleus. The aim of this work is to search for the presence of H$_2$O on the\nnucleus which, in general, appears very dark and rich in dehydrated organic\nmaterial. After selecting images of the bright spots which could be good\ncandidates to search for H$_2$O ice, taken at high resolution by OSIRIS, we\ncheck for spectral cubes of the selected coordinates to identify these spots\nobserved by VIRTIS. The selected OSIRIS images were processed with the OSIRIS\nstandard pipeline and corrected for the illumination conditions for each pixel\nusing the Lommel-Seeliger disk law. The spots with higher I/F were selected and\nthen analysed spectrophotometrically and compared with the surrounding area. We\nselected 13 spots as good targets to be analysed by VIRTIS to search for the 2\nmicron absorption band of water ice in the VIRTIS spectral cubes. Out of the 13\nselected bright spots, eight of them present positive H$_2$O ice detection on\nthe VIRTIS data. A spectral analysis was performed and the approximate\ntemperature of each spot was computed. The H$_2$O ice content was confirmed by\nmodeling the spectra with mixing (areal and intimate) of H$_2$O ice and dark\nterrain, using Hapke's radiative transfer modeling. We also present a detailed\nanalysis of the detected spots.\n", "  In the version 1 of this paper, we claimed that 4D ${\\cal N}=1$ supergravity\nformulations with different auxiliary fields can be unified using U(1) gauge\nsymmetry, whose gauge superfield does not have a kinetic term. However, after\nsubmission, we found a critical error in our statement. This is the note on the\npaper of the version 1.\n", "  With the application of advanced astronomical technologies, equipments and\nmethods all over the world, astronomy covers from radio, infrared, visible\nlight, ultraviolet, X-ray and gamma ray band, and enters into the era of full\nwavelength astronomy. How to effectively integrate data from different ground-\nand space-based observation equipments, different observers, different bands,\ndifferent observation time, requires the data fusion technology. In this paper\nwe introduce the cross-match tool that is developed by the Python language and\nbased on the PostgreSQL database and uses Q3C as the core index, facilitating\nthe cross-match work of massive astronomical data. It provides four different\ncross-match functions, namely: I) cross-match of custom error range; II)\ncross-match of catalog error; III) cross-match based on the elliptic error\nrange; IV) cross-match of the nearest algorithm. The cross-match result set\nprovides good foundation for subsequent data mining and statistics based on\nmultiwavelength data. The most advantage of this tool is a user-oriented tool\napplied locally by users. By means of this tool, users may easily create their\nown databases, manage their own data and cross-match databases according to\ntheir requirements. In addition, this tool is also able to transfer data from\none database into another database. More importantly, the tool is easy to get\nstarted and used by astronomers without writing any code.\n", "  The dynamics of colliding wind binary systems and conditions for efficient\nparticle acceleration therein have attracted multiple numerical studies in the\nrecent years. These numerical models seek an explanation of the thermal and\nnon-thermal emission of these systems as seen by observations. In the\nnon-thermal regime, radio and X-ray emission is observed for several of these\ncolliding-wind binaries, while gamma-ray emission has so far only been found in\n$\\eta$ Carinae and possibly in WR 11. Energetic electrons are deemed\nresponsible for a large fraction of the observed high-energy photons in these\nsystems. Only in the gamma-ray regime there might be, depending on the\nproperties of the stars, a significant contribution of emission from neutral\npion decay. Thus, studying the emission from colliding-wind binaries requires\ndetailed models of the acceleration and propagation of energetic electrons.\nThis in turn requires a detailed understanding of the magnetic field, which\nwill not only affect the energy losses of the electrons but in case of\nsynchrotron emission also the directional dependence of the emissivity. In this\nstudy we investigate magnetohydrodynamic simulations of different colliding\nwind binary systems with magnetic fields that are strong enough to have a\nsignificant effect on the winds. Such strong fields require a detailed\ntreatment of the near-star wind acceleration zone. We show the implementation\nof such simulations and discuss results that demonstrate the effect of the\nmagnetic field on the structure of the wind collision region.\n", "  In the Milky Way, the thick disk can be defined using individual stellar\nabundances, kinematics, or age; or geometrically, as stars high above the\nmid-plane. In nearby galaxies, where only a geometric definition can be used,\nthick disks appear to have large radial scale-lengths, and their red colors\nsuggest that they are uniformly old. The Milky Way's geometrically thick disk\nis also radially extended, but it is far from chemically uniform:\nalpha-enhanced stars are confined within the inner Galaxy. In simulated\ngalaxies, where old stars are centrally concentrated, geometrically thick disks\nare radially extended, too. Younger stellar populations flare in the simulated\ndisks' outer regions, bringing those stars high above the mid-plane. The\nresulting geometrically thick disks therefore show a radial age gradient, from\nold in their central regions to younger in their outskirts. Based on our age\nestimates for a large sample of giant stars in the APOGEE survey, we can now\ntest this scenario for the Milky Way. We find that the geometrically-defined\nthick disk in the Milky Way has indeed a strong radial age gradient: the median\nage for red clump stars goes from ~9 Gyr in the inner disk to 5 Gyr in the\nouter disk. We propose that at least some nearby galaxies could also have thick\ndisks that are not uniformly old, and that geometrically thick disks might be\ncomplex structures resulting from different formation mechanisms in their inner\nand outer parts.\n", "  We have recently suggested that gas accretion can be studied using host\ngalaxies of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We obtained the first ever far-infrared\n(FIR) line observations of a GRB host, namely Herschel/PACS resolved [CII] 158\num and [OI] 63 um spectroscopy, as well as APEX CO(2-1) and ALMA CO(1-0)\nobservations of the GRB 980425 host. It has elevated [CII]/FIR and [OI]/FIR\nratios and higher values of star formation rate (SFR) derived from line ([CII],\n[OI], Ha) than from continuum (UV, IR, radio) indicators. [CII] emission\nexhibits a normal morphology, peaking at the galaxy center, whereas [OI] is\nconcentrated close to the GRB position and the nearby Wolf-Rayet region. The\nhigh [OI] flux indicates high radiation field and gas density. The [CII]/CO\nluminosity ratio of the GRB 980425 host is close to the highest values found\nfor local star-forming galaxies. Its CO-derived molecular gas mass is low given\nits SFR and metallicity, but the [CII]-derived molecular gas mass is close to\nthe expected value. The [OI] and HI concentrations, and the high radiation\nfield and density are consistent with the hypothesis of a very recent (at most\na few tens of Myr ago) inflow of atomic gas triggering star formation. Dust has\nnot had time to build up (explaining high line-to-continuum ratios). Such a\nrecent enhancement of star-formation would indeed manifest itself in high\nSFR_line/SFR_continuum ratios, because the line indicators are sensitive only\nto recent (<10 Myr) activity, whereas the continuum indicators measure the SFR\naveraged over much longer periods (~100 Myr). Other GRB hosts exhibit a mean\nSFR_line/SFR_continuum of 1.74+-0.32. This is consistent with a very recent\nenhancement of star formation being common among GRB hosts, so galaxies which\nhave recently experienced inflow of gas may preferentially host stars exploding\nas GRBs. Hence GRB hosts may be used to investigate recent gas accretion.\n", "  The volume of radio-astronomical data is a considerable burden in the\nprocessing and storing of radio observations with high time and frequency\nresolutions and large bandwidths. Lossy compression of interferometric\nradio-astronomical data is considered to reduce the volume of visibility data\nand to speed up processing.\n  A new compression technique named \"Dysco\" is introduced that consists of two\nsteps: a normalization step, in which grouped visibilities are normalized to\nhave a similar distribution; and a quantization and encoding step, which rounds\nvalues to a given quantization scheme using a dithering scheme. Several\nnon-linear quantization schemes are tested and combined with different methods\nfor normalizing the data. Four data sets with observations from the LOFAR and\nMWA telescopes are processed with different processing strategies and different\ncombinations of normalization and quantization. The effects of compression are\nmeasured in image plane.\n  The noise added by the lossy compression technique acts like normal system\nnoise. The accuracy of Dysco is depending on the signal-to-noise ratio of the\ndata: noisy data can be compressed with a smaller loss of image quality. Data\nwith typical correlator time and frequency resolutions can be compressed by a\nfactor of 6.4 for LOFAR and 5.3 for MWA observations with less than 1% added\nsystem noise. An implementation of the compression technique is released that\nprovides a Casacore storage manager and allows transparent encoding and\ndecoding. Encoding and decoding is faster than the read/write speed of typical\ndisks.\n  The technique can be used for LOFAR and MWA to reduce the archival space\nrequirements for storing observed data. Data from SKA-low will likely be\ncompressible by the same amount as LOFAR. The same technique can be used to\ncompress data from other telescopes, but a different bit-rate might be\nrequired.\n", "  Magnetic fields significantly influence the evolution of protoplanetary disks\nand the formation of planets, following the predictions of numerous\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. However, these predictions are yet\nobservationally unconstrained. To validate the predictions on the influence of\nmagnetic fields on protoplanetary disks, we apply 3D radiative transfer\nsimulations of the polarized emission of aligned aspherical dust grains that\ndirectly link 3D global non-ideal MHD simulations to ALMA observations. Our\nsimulations show that it is feasible to observe the predicted toroidal\nlarge-scale magnetic field structures, not only in the ideal observations but\nalso with high-angular resolution ALMA observations. Our results show further\nthat high angular resolution observations by ALMA are able to identify vortices\nembedded in outer magnetized disk regions.\n", "  We report the first hard X-ray observations with NuSTAR of the BL Lac type\nblazar PKS 2155-304, augmented with soft X-ray data from XMM-Newton and\ngamma-ray data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope, obtained in April 2013 when\nthe source was in a very low flux state. A joint NuSTAR and XMM spectrum,\ncovering the energy range 0.5 - 60 keV, is best described by a model consisting\nof a log-parabola component with curvature beta = 0.3(+0.2,-0.1) and a (local)\nphoton index 3.04 +/- 0.15 at photon energy of 2 keV, and a hard power-law tail\nwith photon index 2.2 +/- 0.4. The hard X-ray tail can be smoothly joined to\nthe quasi-simultaneous gamma-ray spectrum by a synchrotron self-Compton\ncomponent produced by an electron distribution with index p = 2.2. Assuming\nthat the power-law electron distribution extends down to the minimum electron\nLorentz factor gamma_min = 1 and that there is one proton per electron, an\nunrealistically high total jet power L_p of roughly 10^47 erg/s is inferred.\nThis can be reduced by two orders of magnitude either by considering a\nsignificant presence of electron-positron pairs with lepton-to-proton ratio of\nat least 30, or by introducing an additional, low-energy break in the electron\nenergy distribution at the electron Lorentz factor gamma_br1 of roughly 100. In\neither case, the jet composition is expected to be strongly matter-dominated.\n", "  Context: Exoplanet science has made staggering progress in the last two\ndecades, due to the relentless exploration of new detection methods and\nrefinement of existing ones. Yet astrometry offers a unique and untapped\npotential of discovery of habitable-zone low-mass planets around all the\nsolar-like stars of the solar neighborhood. To fulfill this goal, astrometry\nmust be paired with high precision calibration of the detector.\n  Aims: We present a way to calibrate a detector for high accuracy astrometry.\nAn experimental testbed combining an astrometric simulator and an\ninterferometric calibration system is used to validate both the hardware needed\nfor the calibration and the signal processing methods. The objective is an\naccuracy of 5e-6 pixel on the location of a Nyquist sampled polychromatic point\nspread function.\n  Methods: The interferometric calibration system produced modulated Young\nfringes on the detector. The Young fringes were parametrized as products of\ntime and space dependent functions, based on various pixel parameters. The\nminimization of func- tion parameters was done iteratively, until convergence\nwas obtained, revealing the pixel information needed for the calibration of\nastrometric measurements.\n  Results: The calibration system yielded the pixel positions to an accuracy\nestimated at 4e-4 pixel. After including the pixel position information, an\nastrometric accuracy of 6e-5 pixel was obtained, for a PSF motion over more\nthan five pixels. In the static mode (small jitter motion of less than 1e-3\npixel), a photon noise limited precision of 3e-5 pixel was reached.\n", "  We studied the well known circumstellar disk around the Herbig Ae/Be star HD\n97048 with high angular resolution to reveal undetected structures in the disk,\nwhich may be indicative of disk evolutionary processes such as planet\nformation. We used the IRDIS near-IR subsystem of the extreme adaptive optics\nimager SPHERE at the ESO/VLT to study the scattered light from the\ncircumstellar disk via high resolution polarimetry and angular differential\nimaging. We imaged the disk in unprecedented detail and revealed four ring-like\nbrightness enhancements and corresponding gaps in the scattered light from the\ndisk surface with radii between 39 au and 341 au. We derived the inclination\nand position angle as well as the height of the scattering surface of the disk\nfrom our observational data. We found that the surface height profile can be\ndescribed by a single power law up to a separation ~270 au. Using the surface\nheight profile we measured the scattering phase function of the disk and found\nthat it is well consistent with theoretical models of compact dust aggregates.\nWe discuss the origin of the detected features and find that low mass (< 1\nM_Jup) nascent planets are a possible explanation.\n", "  The infrared Calcium Triplet and its nearby spectral region have been used\nfor spectral and luminosity classification of late-type stars, but the samples\nof cool supergiants (CSGs) used have been very limited (in size, metallicity\nrange, and spectral types covered). The spectral range of the Gaia Radial\nVelocity Spectrograph (RVS) covers most of this region but does not reach the\nmain TiO bands in this region, whose depths define the M sequence. We study the\nbehaviour of spectral features around the Calcium Triplet and develop effective\ncriteria to identify and classify CSGs, comparing their efficiency with other\nmethods previously proposed. We measure the main spectral features in a large\nsample (almost 600) of CSGs from three different galaxies, and we analyse their\nbehaviour through a principal component analysis. Using the principal\ncomponents, we develop an automatised method to differentiate CSGs from other\nbright late-type stars, and to classify them. The proposed method identifies a\nhigh fraction of the supergiants (SGs) in our test sample, which cover a wide\nmetallicity range (SGs from the SMC, the LMC, and the Milky Way) and with\nspectral types from G0 up to late-M. In addition, it is capable to separate\nmost of the non-SGs in the sample, identifying as SGs only a very small\nfraction of them. A comparison of this method with other previously proposed\nshows that it is more efficient and selects less interlopers. A way to\nautomatically assign a spectral type to the SGs is also developed. We apply\nthis study to spectra at the resolution and spectral range of the Gaia RVS,\nwith a similar success rate. The method developed identifies and classifies\nCSGs in large samples, with high efficiency and low contamination, even in\nconditions of wide metallicity and spectral-type ranges.\n", "  In this work we report the detection of seven Neptune Trojans (NTs) in the\nPan-STARRS 1 (PS1) survey. Five of these are new discoveries, consisting of\nfour L4 Trojans and one L5 Trojan. Our orbital simulations show that the L5\nTrojan stably librates for only several million years. This suggests that the\nL5 Trojan must be of recent capture origin. On the other hand, all four new L4\nTrojans stably occupy the 1:1 resonance with Neptune for more than 1 Gyr. They\ncan, therefore, be of primordial origin. Our survey simulation results show\nthat the inclination width of the Neptune Trojan population should be between\n$7^{\\circ}$ and $27^{\\circ}$ at $>$ 95% confidence, and most likely $\\sim\n11^{\\circ}$. In this paper, we describe the PS1 survey, the Outer Solar System\npipeline, the confirming observations, and the orbital/physical properties of\nthe new Neptune Trojans.\n", "  Miraculously, target mass corrections for inclusive deep inelastic scattering\ncan be calculated exactly. On the contrary, there does not exist a consistent\nderivation of kinematic hadron mass corrections for semi-inclusive deep\ninelastic scattering (SIDIS). Recently this has become of topical interest,\nsince there is a significant difference between the measured HERMES and COMPASS\npion and kaon multiplicities, which cannot be explained as a consequence of\nevolution in $Q^2$, and it has been suggested that the difference can be\nunderstood if kinematic hadron mass corrections are taken into account. We\nexplain why this argument is incorrect.\n", "  We report observations of resolved C2H emission rings within the gas-rich\nprotoplanetary disks of TW Hya and DM Tau using the Atacama Large Millimeter\nArray (ALMA). In each case the emission ring is found to arise at the edge of\nthe observable disk of mm-sized grains (pebbles) traced by (sub)mm-wave\ncontinuum emission. In addition, we detect a C3H2 emission ring with an\nidentical spatial distribution to C2H in the TW Hya disk. This suggests that\nthese are hydrocarbon rings (i.e. not limited to C2H). Using a detailed\nthermo-chemical model we show that reproducing the emission from C2H requires a\nstrong UV field and C/O > 1 in the upper disk atmosphere and outer disk, beyond\nthe edge of the pebble disk. This naturally arises in a disk where the\nice-coated dust mass is spatially stratified due to the combined effects of\ncoagulation, gravitational settling and drift. This stratification causes the\ndisk surface and outer disk to have a greater permeability to UV photons.\nFurthermore the concentration of ices that transport key volatile carriers of\noxygen and carbon in the midplane, along with photochemical erosion of CO,\nleads to an elemental C/O ratio that exceeds unity in the UV-dominated disk.\nThus the motions of the grains, and not the gas, lead to a rich hydrocarbon\nchemistry in disk surface layers and in the outer disk midplane.\n", "  Extreme adaptive optics systems are now in operation across the globe. These\nsystems, capable of high order wavefront correction, deliver Strehl ratios of\n90% in the near-infrared. Originally intended for the direct imaging of\nexoplanets, these systems are often equipped with advanced coronagraphs that\nsuppress the on-axis-star, interferometers to calibrate wavefront errors, and\nlow order wavefront sensors to stabilize any tip/tilt residuals to a degree\nnever seen before. Such systems are well positioned to facilitate the detailed\nspectroscopic characterization of faint substellar companions at small angular\nseparations from the host star. Additionally, the increased light concentration\nof the point-spread function and the unprecedented stability create\nopportunities in other fields of astronomy as well, including spectroscopy.\nWith such Strehl ratios, efficient injection into single-mode fibers or\nphotonic lanterns becomes possible. With diffraction-limited components feeding\nthe instrument, calibrating a spectrograph's line profile becomes considerably\neasier, as modal noise or imperfect scrambling of the fiber output are no\nlonger an issue. It also opens up the possibility of exploiting photonic\ntechnologies for their advanced functionalities, inherent replicability, and\nsmall, lightweight footprint to design and build future instrumentation. In\nthis work, we outline how extreme adaptive optics systems will enable advanced\nphotonic and diffraction-limited technologies to be exploited in spectrograph\ndesign and the impact it will have on spectroscopy. We illustrate that the\nprecision of an instrument based on these technologies, would be limited by the\nspectral content and stellar noise on cool stars and capable of achieving a\nradial velocity precision of several m/s; the level required for detecting an\nexo-Earth in the HZ of a nearby M-dwarf.\n", "  The goal of this paper is to extend to higher dimensionality the methods and\ncomputations of vacuum polarization effects in black hole spacetimes. We focus\nour attention on the case of five dimensional Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black\nholes, for which we adapt the general method initially developed by Candelas\nand later refined by Anderson and others. We make use of point splitting\nregularization and of the WKB approximation to extract the divergences occuring\nin the coincidence limit of the Green function and, after calculating the\ncounter-terms using the Schwinger - De Witt expansion, we explicitly prove the\ncancellation of the divergences and the regularity of the vacuum polarization\nonce counter-terms are added up. We finally handle numerically the renormalized\nexpression of the vacuum polarization. As a check on the method we also prove\nthe regularity of the vacuum polarization in the six dimensional case in the\nlarge mass limit.\n", "  We report the detection of coherent pulsations from the ultraluminous X-ray\nsource NGC 7793 P13. The ~0.42s nearly sinusoidal pulsations were initially\ndiscovered in broadband X-ray observations using XMM-Newton and NuSTAR taken in\n2016. We subsequently also found pulsations in archival XMM-Newton data taken\nin 2013 and 2014. The significant (>>5 sigma) detection of coherent pulsations\ndemonstrates that the compact object in P13 is a neutron star with an observed\npeak luminosity of ~1e40 erg/s (assuming isotropy), well above the Eddington\nlimit for a 1.4 M_sun accretor. This makes P13 the second ultraluminous X-ray\nsource known to be powered by an accreting neutron star. The pulse period\nvaries between epochs, with a slow but persistent spin up over the 2013-2016\nperiod. This spin-up indicates a magnetic field of B ~ 1.5e12 G, typical of\nmany accreting pulsars. The most likely explanation for the extreme luminosity\nis a high degree of beaming, however this is difficult to reconcile with the\nsinusoidal pulse profile.\n", "  Early-type galaxies (ETGs) are supposed to follow the virial relation $M =\nk_e \\sigma_*^2 R_e / G$, with $M$ being the mass, $\\sigma_*$ being the stellar\nvelocity dispersion, $R_e$ being the effective radius, $G$ being Newton's\nconstant, and $k_e$ being the virial factor, a geometry factor of order unity.\nApplying this relation to (a) the ATLAS3D sample of Cappellari et al. (2013)\nand (b) the sample of Saglia et al. (2016) gives ensemble-averaged factors\n$\\langle k_e\\rangle =5.15\\pm0.09$ and $\\langle k_e\\rangle =4.01\\pm0.18$,\nrespectively, with the difference arising from different definitions of\neffective velocity dispersions. The two datasets reveal a statistically\nsignificant tilt of the empirical relation relative to the theoretical virial\nrelation such that $M\\propto(\\sigma_*^2R_e)^{0.92}$. This tilt disappears when\nreplacing $R_e$ with the semi-major axis of the projected half-light ellipse,\n$a$. All best-fit scaling relations show zero intrinsic scatter, implying that\nthe mass plane of ETGs is fully determined by the virial relation. Whenever a\ncomparison is possible, my results are consistent with, and confirm, the\nresults by Cappellari et al. (2013). The difference between the relations using\neither $a$ or $R_e$ arises from a known lack of highly elliptical high-mass\ngalaxies; this leads to a scaling $(1-\\epsilon) \\propto M^{0.12}$, with\n$\\epsilon$ being the ellipticity and $R_e = a\\sqrt{1-\\epsilon}$. Accordingly,\n$a$, not $R_e$, is the correct proxy for the scale radius of ETGs. By geometry,\nthis implies that early-type galaxies are axisymmetric and oblate in general,\nin agreement with published results from modeling based on kinematics and light\ndistributions.\n", "  In contrast to thermotropic biaxial nematic phases, for which some long\nsought for experimental realizations have been obtained, no experimental\nrealizations are yet known for their tetrahedratic and cubatic\ncounterparts,involving orientational orders of ranks 3 and 4, respectively,\nalso studied theoretically over the last few decades. In previous studies,\ncubatic order has been found for hard-core or continuous models consisting of\nparticles possessing cubic or nearly-cubic tetragonal or orthorhombic\nsymmetries; in a few cases, hard-core models involving uniaxial ($D_{\\infty\nh}-$symmetric) particles have been claimed to produce cubatic order as well.\nHere we address by Monte Carlo simulation a lattice model consisting of\nuniaxial particles coupled by long-range dispersion interactions of the\nLondon-De Boer-Heller type; the model was found to produce no second-rank\nnematic but only fourth-rank cubatic order, in contrast to the nematic behavior\nlong known for its counterpart with interactions truncated at nearest-neighbor\nseparation.\n", "  We observed RZ LMi, which is renowned for the extremely (~19d) short\nsupercycle and is a member of a small, unusual class of cataclysmic variables\ncalled ER UMa-type dwarf novae, in 2013 and 2016. In 2016, the supercycles of\nthis object substantially lengthened in comparison to the previous measurements\nto 35, 32, 60d for three consecutive superoutbursts. We consider that the\nobject virtually experienced a transition to the novalike state (permanent\nsuperhumper). This observed behavior extremely well reproduced the prediction\nof the thermal-tidal instability model. We detected a precursor in the 2016\nsuperoutburst and detected growing (stage A) superhumps with a mean period of\n0.0602(1)d in 2016 and in 2013. Combined with the period of superhumps\nimmediately after the superoutburst, the mass ratio is not as small as in WZ\nSge-type dwarf novae, having orbital periods similar to RZ LMi. By using least\nabsolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) two-dimensional power\nspectra, we detected possible negative superhumps with a period of 0.05710(1)d.\nWe estimated the orbital period of 0.05792d, which suggests a mass ratio of\n0.105(5). This relatively large mass ratio is even above ordinary SU UMa-type\ndwarf novae, and it is also possible that the exceptionally high mass-transfer\nrate in RZ LMi may be a result of a stripped core evolved secondary which are\nevolving toward an AM CVn-type object.\n", "  Maximally supersymmetric gauge theory in four dimensions admits local\nboundary conditions which preserve half of the bulk supersymmetries. The\nS-duality of the bulk gauge theory can be extended in a natural fashion to act\non such half-BPS boundary conditions. The purpose of this note is to explain\nthe role these boundary conditions can play in the Geometric Langlands program.\nIn particular, we describe how to obtain pairs of Geometric Langland dual\nobjects from S-dual pairs of half-BPS boundary conditions.\n", "  First-principles calculations were carried out to explore the possible\ncoupling between spin-polarized electronic states and ferroelectric\npolarization in monolayers of transition-metal dichalcogenides MX 2 (M = Mo, W;\nX = S, Se, Te) with distorted octahedrally coordinated 1T structures.For d^2\nmetal ions, two competing metal clustering effects can take place, where metal\nions are arranged in trimers or zigzag chains. Among these, the former\nstructural distortion comes along with an improper ferroelectric phase which\npersists in the monolayer limit. Switchable Rashba-like spin-polarization\nfeatures are predicted in the trimerized polytype, which can be permanently\ntuned by acting on its ferroelectric properties. The polar trimerized structure\nis found to be stable for 1T-MoS 2 only, while the nonpolar polytype with\nzigzag metal clustering is predicted to stabilize for other transition-metal\ndichalcogenides with d 2 metal ions.\n", "  We highlight the main results of a radiative transfer investigation on the\nmagnetic sensitivity of the solar Mg ii k resonance line at 2795.5 angstrom,\naccounting for the joint action of the Hanle and Zeeman effects as well as\npartial frequency redistribution (PRD) phenomena. We confirm that at the line\ncenter, the linear polarization signals produced by scattering processes are\nmeasurable, and that they are sensitive, via the Hanle effect, to magnetic\nfields with strengths between 5 and 50 G, approximately. We also show that the\nZeeman effect produces conspicuous circular polarization signals, especially\nfor longitudinal fields stronger than 50 G, which can be used to estimate the\nmagnetization of the solar chromosphere via the familiar magnetograph formula.\nThe most novel result is that magneto-optical effects produce, in the wings of\nthe line, a decrease of the Q/I scattering polarization pattern and the\nappearance of U/I signals (i.e., a rotation of the plane of linear\npolarization). This sensitivity of the Q/I and U/I wing signals to both weak\n(around 5 G) and stronger magnetic fields expands the scientific interest of\nthe Mg ii k line for probing the chromosphere in quiet and active regions of\nthe Sun\n", "  The mechanics of complex soft matter often cannot be understood in the\nclassical physical frame of flexible polymers or rigid rods. The underlying\nconstituents are semiflexible polymers, whose finite bending stiffness\n($\\kappa$) leads to non-trivial mechanical responses. A natural model for such\npolymers is the protein actin. Experimental studies of actin networks, however,\nare limited since the persistence length ($l_{\\text{p}} \\propto \\kappa$) cannot\nbe tuned. Here, we experimentally characterize this parameter for the first\ntime in entangled networks formed by synthetically produced, structurally\ntunable DNA nanotubes. This material enabled the validation of characteristics\ninherent to semiflexible polymers and networks thereof, i.e., persistence\nlength, inextensibility, reptation and mesh size scaling. While the scaling of\nthe elastic plateau modulus with concentration $G_0 \\propto c^{7/5}$ is\nconsistent with previous measurements and established theories, the emerging\npersistence length scaling $G_0 \\propto l_{\\text{p}}$ opposes predominant\ntheoretical predictions.\n", "  Systematic analysis of the planar resistivity, Hall effect and cotangent of\nthe Hall angle for the electron-doped cuprates reveals underlying Fermi-liquid\nbehavior even deep in the antiferromagnetic part of the phase diagram. The\ntransport scattering rate exhibits a quadratic temperature dependence, and is\nnearly independent of doping, compound and carrier type (electrons vs. holes),\nand hence universal. Our analysis moreover indicates that the material-specific\nresistivity upturn at low temperatures and low doping has the same origin in\nboth electron- and hole-doped cuprates.\n", "  In this Letter, we report compressible mode effects on relativistic\nmagnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) turbulence in Poynting-dominated plasmas using\n3-dimensional numerical simulations. We decomposed fluctuations in the\nturbulence into 3 MHD modes (fast, slow, and Alfv\\'en) following the procedure\nmode decomposition in (Cho & Lazarian 2002), and analyzed their energy spectra\nand structure functions separately. We also analyzed the ratio of compressible\nmode to Alfv\\'en mode energy with respect to its Mach number. We found the\nratio of compressible mode increases not only with the Alfv\\'en Mach number but\nwith the background magnetization, which indicates a strong coupling between\nthe fast and Alfv\\'en modes and appearance of a new regime of RMHD turbulence\nin Poynting-dominated plasmas where the fast and Alfv\\'en modes strongly\ncouples and cannot be separated, different from the non-relativistic MHD case.\nThis finding will affect particle acceleration efficiency obtained by assuming\nAlfv\\'enic critical balance turbulence, and will change the resulting photon\nspectra by non-thermal electrons.\n", "  The transient Be/X-ray binary A0538-66 shows peculiar X-ray and optical\nvariability. Despite numerous studies, the intrinsic properties underlying its\nanomalous behaviour remain poorly understood. Since 2014 September we are\nconducting the first quasi-simultaneous optical and near-infrared photometric\nmonitoring of A0538-66 in seven filters with the Rapid Eye Mount (REM)\ntelescope, aiming to understand the properties of this binary system. We found\nthat the REM lightcurves show fast flares lasting one or two days that repeat\nalmost regularly every ~16.6 days, the orbital period of the neutron star. If\nthe optical flares are powered by X-ray outbursts through photon reprocessing,\nthe REM lightcurves indicate that A0538-66 is still active in X-rays: bright\nX-ray flares (L_x > 1E37 erg/s) could be observable during the periastron\npassages. The REM lightcurves show a long-term variability that is especially\npronounced in the g band and decreases with increasing wavelength, until it no\nlonger appears in the near-infrared lightcurves. In addition, A0538-66 is\nfainter with respect to previous optical observations most likely due to the\nhigher absorption of the stellar radiation of a denser circumstellar disc. On\nthe basis of the current models, we interpret these observational results with\na circumstellar disc around the Be star observed nearly edge-on during a\npartial depletion phase. The REM lightcurves also show short-term variability\non timescales of ~1 day possibly indicative of perturbations in the density\ndistribution of the circumstellar disc caused by the tidal interaction with the\nneutron star.\n", "  Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we study the effect\nof the so-called herringbone reconstruction of Au(111) on the dispersion of the\nfree electron-like surface state. While earlier ARPES investigations have only\nreported a minor interplay of the surface state dispersion and the underlying\nreconstruction, we show that the uniaxial lattice distortion and the thereby\nchanged reciprocal lattice for the first atomic layer leads to distinct surface\nstate dispersions around the first order reciprocal lattice points of the three\ndomains, creating a constant energy surface resembling a trefoil knot. The\nfindings resolve the long-standing discrepancy between, on one hand, the\nreconstruction-induced surface state modifications reported in scanning\ntunnelling microscopy and first principle calculations and, on the other hand,\ntheir conspicuous absence in photoemission.\n", "  Boson Sampling represents a promising approach to obtain an evidence of the\nsupremacy of quantum systems as a resource for the solution of computational\nproblems. The classical hardness of Boson Sampling has been related to the so\ncalled Permanent-of-Gaussians Conjecture and has been extended to some\ngeneralizations such as Scattershot Boson Sampling, approximate and lossy\nsampling under some reasonable constraints. However, it is still unclear how\ndemanding these techniques are for a quantum experimental sampler. Starting\nfrom a state of the art analysis and taking account of the foreseeable\npractical limitations, we evaluate and discuss the bound for quantum supremacy\nfor different recently proposed approaches, accordingly to today's best known\nclassical simulators.\n", "  During the last few decades, there has been a growing interest in exact\nsolutions of Einstein equations describing razor-thin disks. Despite the\nprogress in the area, the analytical study of geodesic motion crossing the disk\nplane in these systems is not yet so developed. In the present work, we propose\na definite vertical stability criterion for circular equatorial timelike\ngeodesics in static, axially symmetric thin disks, possibly surrounded by other\nstructures preserving axial symmetry. It turns out that the strong energy\ncondition for the disk stress-energy content is sufficient for vertical\nstability of these orbits. Moreover, adiabatic invariance of the vertical\naction variable gives us an approximate third integral of motion for oblique\norbits which deviate slightly from the equatorial plane. Such new approximate\nthird integral certainly points to a better understanding of the analytical\nproperties of these orbits. The results presented here, derived for static\nspacetimes, may be a starting point to study the motion around rotating,\nstationary razor-thin disks. Our results also allow us to conjecture that the\nstrong energy condition should be sufficient to assure transversal stability of\nperiodic orbits for any singular timelike hypersurface, provided it is\ninvariant under the geodesic flow.\n", "  Following a recent work on the effective description of the equations of\nstate for hot QCD obtained from a Hard thermal loop expression for the gluon\nself-energy, in terms of the quasi-gluons and quasi- quark/anti-quarks with\nrespective effective fugacities, the dissociation process of heavy quarkonium\nin hot QCD medium has been investigated. This has been done by investigating\nthe medium modification to a heavy quark potential. The medium modified\npotential has a quite different form (a long range Coulomb tail in addition to\nthe usual Yukawa term) in contrast to the usual picture of Debye screening. The\nflavor dependence of the binding energies of the heavy quarkonia states and the\ndissociation temperature have been obtained by employing the debye mass for\npure gluonic and full QCD case computed employing the quasi-particle picture.\nThus estimated dissociation patterns of the charmonium and bottomonium states,\nconsidering Debye mass from different approaches in pure gluonic case and full\nQCD, have shown good agreement with the other potential model studies.\n", "  We analyze data from the Quarter 1-17 Data Release 24 (Q1--Q17 DR24) planet\ncandidate catalog from NASA's Kepler mission, specifically comparing systems\nwith single transiting planets to systems with multiple transiting planets, and\nidentify a distinct population of exoplanets with a necessarily distinct system\narchitecture. Such an architecture likely indicates a different branch in their\nevolutionary past relative to the typical Kepler system. The key feature of\nthese planetary systems is an isolated, Earth-sized planet with a roughly\none-day orbital period. We estimate that at least 24 of the 144 systems we\nexamined (>~17%) are members of this population. Accounting for detection\nefficiency, such planetary systems occur with a frequency similar to the hot\nJupiters.\n", "  We search for signs of ongoing planet-disk interaction and study the\ndistribution of small grains at the surface of the transition disk around\nRXJ1615.3-3255 (RX J1615). We observed RXJ1615 with VLT/SPHERE. We image the\ndisk for the first time in scattered light and detect two arcs, two rings, a\ngap and an inner disk with marginal evidence for an inner cavity. The shapes of\nthe arcs suggest that they probably are segments of full rings. Ellipse fitting\nfor the two rings and inner disk yield a disk inclination i = 47 \\pm 2 degrees\nand find semi-major axes of 1.50 \\pm 0.01\" (278 au), 1.06 \\pm 0.01\" (196 au)\nand 0.30 \\pm 0.01\" (56 au), respectively. We determine the scattering surface\nheight above the midplane, based on the projected ring center offsets. Nine\npoint sources are detected between 2.1\" and 8.0\" separation and considered as\ncompanion candidates. With NACO data we recover four of the nine point sources,\nwhich we determine not to be co-moving, and therefore unbound to the system. We\npresent the first detection of the transition disk of RXJ1615 in scattered\nlight. The height of the rings indicate limited flaring of the disk surface,\nwhich enables partial self-shadowing in the disk. The outermost arc either\ntraces the bottom of the disk or it is another ring with semi-major axis >\n2.35\" (435 au). We explore both scenarios, extrapolating the complete shape of\nthe feature, which will allow to distinguish between the two in future\nobservations. The most interesting scenario, where the arc traces the bottom of\nthe outer ring, requires the disk truncated at r ~ 360 au. The closest\ncompanion candidate, if indeed orbiting the disk at 540 au, would then be the\nmost likely cause for such truncation. This companion candidate, as well as the\nremaining four, require follow up observations to determine if they are bound\nto the system.\n", "  One of the primary objectives of the TOPoS survey is to search for the most\nmetal-poor stars. Our search has led to the discovery of one of the most\niron-poor objects known, SDSS\\,J092912.32+023817.0. This object is a multiple\nsystem, in which two components are clearly detected in the spectrum. We have\nanalysed 16 high-resolution spectra obtained using the UVES spectrograph at the\nESO 8.2m VLT telescope to measure radial velocities and determine the chemical\ncomposition of the system. Cross correlation of the spectra with a synthetic\ntemplate yields a double-peaked cross-correlation function (CCF) for eight\nspectra, and in one case there is evidence for the presence of a third peak.\nChemical analysis of the spectrum obtained by averaging all the spectra for\nwhich the CCF showed a single peak found that the iron abundance is\n[Fe/H]=-4.97. The system is also carbon enhanced with [C/Fe]=+3.91 (A(C)=7.44).\nFrom the permitted oxygen triplet we determined an upper limit for oxygen of\n[O/Fe]<+3.52 such that C/O>1.3. We are also able to provide more stringent\nupper limits on the Sr and Ba abundances ([Sr/Fe]<+0.70, and [Ba/Fe]<+1.46,\nrespectively).\n", "  Rotating Radio Transients (RRATs) are a subclass of pulsars first identified\nin 2006 that are detected only in searches for single pulses and not through\ntheir time averaged emission. Here, we present the results of observations of\n19 RRATs using the first station of the Long Wavelength Array (LWA1) at\nfrequencies between 30 MHz and 88 MHz. The RRATs observed here were first\ndetected in higher frequency pulsar surveys. Of the 19 RRATs observed, 2\nsources were detected and their dispersion measures, periods, pulse profiles,\nand flux densities are reported and compared to previous higher frequency\nmeasurements. We find a low detection rate (11%), which could be a combination\nof the lower sensitivity of LWA1 compared to the higher frequency telescopes,\nand the result of scattering by the interstellar medium or a spectral turnover.\n", "  [Background:] Recent work found that core excitation can be important in\nextracting structure information from (d,p) reactions. [Purpose:] Our objective\nis to systematically explore the role of core excitation in (d,p) reactions,\nand understand the origin of the dynamical effects. [Method:] Based on the\nparticle-rotor model of $n+^{10}$Be, we generate a number of models with a\nrange of separation energies ($S_n=0.1-5.0$ MeV), while maintaining a\nsignificant core excited component. We then apply the latest extension of the\nmomentum-space based Faddeev method, including dynamical core excitation in the\nreaction mechanism to all orders, to the $^{10}$Be(d,p)$^{11}$Be like\nreactions, and study the excitation effects for beam energies from $E_d=15-90$\nMeV. [Results:] We study the resulting angular distributions and the\ndifferences between the spectroscopic factor that would be extracted from the\ncross sections, when including dynamical core excitation in the reaction, to\nthat of the original structure model. We also explore how different partial\nwaves affect the final cross section. [Conclusions:] Our results show a strong\nbeam energy dependence of the extracted spectroscopic factors that become\nsmaller for intermediate beam energies. This dependence increases for loosely\nbound systems.\n", "  Birhythmicity arises in several physical, biological and chemical systems.\nAlthough, many control schemes are proposed for various forms of\nmultistability, only a few exist for controlling birhythmicity. In this paper\nwe investigate the control of birhythmic oscillation by introducing a\nself-feedback mechanism that incorporates the variable to be controlled and its\ncanonical conjugate. Using a detailed analytical treatment, bifurcation\nanalysis and experimental demonstrations we establish that the proposed\ntechnique is capable of eliminating birhythmicity and generates monorhythmic\noscillation. Further, the detailed parameter space study reveals that, apart\nfrom monorhythmicity, the system shows transition between birhythmicity and\nother dynamical forms of bistability. This study may have practical\napplications in controlling birhythmic behavior of several systems, in\nparticular in biochemical and mechanical processes.\n", "  The CP-even static form factors $\\Delta\\kappa'_V$ and $\\Delta Q_V$\n($V=\\gamma,\\, Z$) associated with the $WWV$ vertex are studied in the context\nof the Georgi-Machacek model (GMM), which predicts nine new scalar bosons\naccommodated in a singlet, a triplet and a fiveplet. General expressions for\nthe one-loop contributions to $\\Delta\\kappa'_V$ and $\\Delta Q_V$ arising from\nneutral, singly and doubly charged scalar bosons are obtained in terms of both\nparametric integrals and Passarino-Veltman scalar functions, which can be\nnumerically evaluated. It is found that the GMM yields 15 (28) distinct\ncontributions to $\\Delta\\kappa'_\\gamma$ and $\\Delta Q_\\gamma$\n($\\Delta\\kappa'_Z$ and $\\Delta Q_Z$), though several of them are naturally\nsuppressed. A numerical analysis is done in the region of parameter space still\nconsistent with current experimental data and it is found that the largest\ncontributions to $\\Delta\\kappa'_V$ arise from Feynman diagrams with two\nnondegenerate scalar bosons in the loop, with values of the order of\n$a=g^2/(96\\pi^2)$ reached when there is a large splitting between the masses of\nthese scalar bosons. As for $\\Delta Q_V$, it reaches values as large as\n$10^{-2}a$ for the lightest allowed scalar bosons, but it decreases rapidly as\none of the masses of the scalar bosons becomes large. Among the new\ncontributions of the GMM to the $\\Delta\\kappa'_V$ and $\\Delta Q_V$ form factors\nare those induced by the $H_5^\\pm W^\\mp Z$ vertex, which arises at the\ntree-level and is a unique prediction of this model.\n", "  We consider a simple spin-membrane model for rippling in graphene. The model\nexhibits transitions from a flat but rippled membrane to a buckled one. At high\ntemperature the transition is second order but it is first order at low\ntemperature for appropriate strength of the spin-spin coupling. Driving the\nsystem across the first order phase transition in nonequilibrium conditions\nthat mimic interaction of the graphene membrane with a STM tip explains recent\nexperiments. In particular, we observe a reversible behavior for small values\nof the STM current and an irreversible transition from flat rippled membrane to\nrigid buckled membrane when the current surpasses a critical value. This work\nopens the possibility to test mechanical properties of graphene under different\ntemperature and electrostatic conditions.\n", "  We present the polarization observations toward the circumstellar disk around\nHD 142527 by using Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at the\nfrequency of 343 GHz. The beam size is $0.51 \" \\times 0.44 \"$, which\ncorresponds to the spatial resolution of $\\sim$ 71 $\\times$ 62 AU. The\npolarized intensity displays a ring-like structure with a peak located on the\neast side with a polarization fraction of $P= 3.26 \\pm 0.02$ %, which is\ndifferent from the peak of the continuum emission from the northeast region.\nThe polarized intensity is significantly weaker at the peak of the continuum\nwhere $P= 0.220 \\pm 0.010$ %. The polarization vectors are in the radial\ndirection in the main ring of the polarized intensity, while there are two\nregions outside at the northwest and northeast areas where the vectors are in\nthe azimuthal direction. If the polarization vectors represent the magnetic\nfield morphology, the polarization vectors indicate the toroidal magnetic field\nconfiguration on the main ring and the poloidal fields outside. On the other\nhand, the flip of the polarization vectors is predicted by the self-scattering\nof thermal dust emission due to the change of the direction of thermal\nradiation flux. Therefore, we conclude that self-scattering of thermal dust\nemission plays a major role in producing polarization at millimeter wavelengths\nin this protoplanetary disk. Also, this puts a constraint on the maximum grain\nsize to be approximately 150 ${\\rm \\mu m}$ if we assume compact spherical dust\ngrains.\n", "  High density behaviour of nuclear symmetry energy is studied on the basis of\na stiffest density dependence of asymmetric contribution to energy per nucleon\nin charge neutral $n+p+e+\\mu$ matter under beta equilibrium. The density\ndependence of nuclear symmetry energy obtained in this way is neither very\nstiff nor soft at high densities and is found to be in conformity with recent\nobservations of neutron stars\n", "  The tree method is a widely implemented algorithm for collisionless $N$-body\nsimulations in astrophysics well suited for GPU(s). Adopting hierarchical time\nstepping can accelerate $N$-body simulations; however, it is infrequently\nimplemented and its potential remains untested in GPU implementations. We have\ndeveloped a Gravitational Oct-Tree code accelerated by HIerarchical time step\nControlling named \\texttt{GOTHIC}, which adopts both the tree method and the\nhierarchical time step. The code adopts some adaptive optimizations by\nmonitoring the execution time of each function on-the-fly and minimizes the\ntime-to-solution by balancing the measured time of multiple functions. Results\nof performance measurements with realistic particle distribution performed on\nNVIDIA Tesla M2090, K20X, and GeForce GTX TITAN X, which are representative\nGPUs of the Fermi, Kepler, and Maxwell generation of GPUs, show that the\nhierarchical time step achieves a speedup by a factor of around 3--5 times\ncompared to the shared time step. The measured elapsed time per step of\n\\texttt{GOTHIC} is 0.30~s or 0.44~s on GTX TITAN X when the particle\ndistribution represents the Andromeda galaxy or the NFW sphere, respectively,\nwith $2^{24} =$~16,777,216 particles. The averaged performance of the code\ncorresponds to 10--30\\% of the theoretical single precision peak performance of\nthe GPU.\n", "  The uncertainty principle is one of the characteristic properties of quantum\ntheory based on incompatibility. Apart from the incompatible relation of\nquantum states, mutually exclusiveness is another remarkable phenomenon in the\ninformation-theoretic foundation of quantum theory. We investigate the role of\nmutual exclusive physical states in the recent work of stronger uncertainty\nrelations for all incompatible observables by Mccone and Pati and generalize\nthe weighted uncertainty relation to the product form as well as their\nmulti-observable analogues. The new bounds capture both incompatibility and\nmutually exclusiveness, and are tighter compared with the existing bounds.\n", "  The radiation reaction effects on electron dynamics in counter-propagating\ncircularly polarized laser beams are investigated through the linearization\ntheorem and the results are in great agreement with numeric solutions. For the\nfirst time, the properties of fixed points in electron phase-space were\nanalyzed with linear stability theory, showing that center nodes will become\nattractors if the classical radiation reaction is considered. Electron dynamics\nare significantly affected by the properties of the fixed points and the\nelectron phase-space densities are found to be increasing exponentially near\nthe attractors. The density growth rates are derived theoretically and further\nverified by particle-in-cell simulations, which can be detected in experiments\nto explore the effects of radiation reaction qualitatively. The attractor can\nalso facilitate to realize a series of nanometer-scaled flying electron slices\nvia adjusting the colliding laser frequencies.\n", "  In this work, we provide a detailed analysis of phosphorene performance as\nn-type and p-type active materials. The study is based on first principles\ncalculation of phosphorene electronic structure, and resulting electron and\nhole scattering rates and lifetimes. Emphasis is put on extreme regimes\ncommonly found in semiconductor devices, i.e. high electric fields and heavy\ndoping, where impact ionization and Auger recombination can occur. We found\nthat electron-initiated impact ionization is weaker than the hole-initiated\nprocess, when compared to carrier-phonon interaction rates, suggesting\nresilience to impact ionization initiated breakdown. Moreover, calculated\nminority electron lifetimes are limited by radiative recombination only, not by\nAuger processes, suggesting that phosphorene could achieve good quantum\nefficiencies in optoelectronic devices. The provided scattering rates and\nlifetimes are critical input data for the modeling and understanding of\nphosphorene-based device physics.\n", "  The excess volume associated with grain boundaries represents a key\nstructural parameter for the characterization of grain boundaries. It plays a\ncritical role in segregation of impurity and alloy elements to grain\nboundaries, and influences significantly the mechanical and functional\nproperties of materials. We have carried out first-principles density\nfunctional calculations on the atomic structure of the (10-12) coherent twin\nboundary in hexagonal close packed (hcp) Ti and Zr and the basal-prismatic\nboundary in Zn, Cd, and Zr. We find the calculated excess volume has a\nvanishing magnitude at the (10-12) coherent twin boundary in Ti and Zr; whereas\nit is remarkable at the basal-prismatic boundary in Zn, Cd, and Zr.\n", "  A series of polycrystalline samples of Sr2-xIrO4 have been synthesized by a\nsolid-state reaction method. The crystal structure of this doped system can be\nexplained on the basis of the extended nature of 5d electrons and strontium\nvacancies in Sr2-xIrO4. The analysis of the temperature-dependent resistance of\nthese samples reveals the semiconducting feature, where three dimensional\nvariable range hopping behavior is observed at temperatures lower than 120K,\nArrhenius type in intermediate temperatures from 140K to 200K, and\ntwo-dimensional (2D) weak localization at high temperatures from 220K to 300K.\nCorrespondingly, temperature-dependent magnetic properties in the range of x\nless than 0.30 can be described by the antiferromagnetically ordered spin\nsystem.\n", "  In this article we study cosmic dynamics in the context of normal branch of\nDGP braneworld model. Using the current Planck data, we best fit the model and\ncosmological parameters in non-flat $\\Lambda$DGP. With the transition redshift\nas a basic variable and statefinder parameters, our result shows that the\nUniverse starts its accelerated expansion phase, slightly earlier than expected\nin $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology. The result also alleviates the coincidence problem\nof the $\\Lambda$CDM model.\n", "  Quantum state transfer between cavities is crucial for quantum information\nprocessing and quantum computation in optomechanical systems. Here, we present\nthe first scheme for the transitionless intra-cavity quantum state transfer\nbased on transitionless quantum driving (TQD) algorithm in optomechanical\nsystems. We also present a physically feasible system for the TQD process based\non largely detuned optomechanical cavity. With the Gaussian time-dependence\ncoupling strengths, our scheme can achieve the perfect quantum state transfer\nwith no undesired transition and reduce the dependence of accurately\ncontrolling evolution time and interval of coupling strengths. Our\ncomputational results show that the TQD process can be accomplished with no\nneed of the mechanical oscillator in its ground state and is also robust to the\nmechanical dissipation.\n", "  We study the spherical top-hat collapse in Einstein gravity and loop quantum\ncosmology by taking the non-linear evolution of viscous modified variable\nchaplygin gas and viscous generalized cosmic chaplygin gas. We calculate the\nequation of state parameter, square speed of sound, perturbed equation of state\nparameter, perturbed square speed of sound, density contrast and divergence of\npeculiar velocity in perturbed region and discussed their behavior. It is\nobserved that both chaplygin gas models support the spherical collapse in\nEinstein as well as loop quantum cosmology because density contrast remains\npositive in both cases and the perturbed equation of state parameter remains\npositive at the present epoch as well as near future. It is remarked here that\nthese parameters provide the consistence results for both chaplygin gas models\nin both gravities.\n", "  We present a study of nuclear activities in nearby S0 galaxies. After\ncross-matching the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR7) with the\nThird Reference Catalog of Bright Galaxies (RC3) and visually checking the SDSS\nimages, we derive a sample of 583 S0 galaxies with the central\nspectrophotometric information. In order to separate nebular emission lines\nfrom the underlying stellar contribution, we fit the stellar population model\nto the SDSS spectra of these S0 galaxies. According to the BPT diagram, we find\nthat $8\\%$ of S0 galaxies show central star-forming activity, while the\nfractions of Seyfert, Composite and LINERs are 2\\%, 8\\%, and 21.4\\%,\nrespectively. We also find that star-forming S0s have the lowest stellar\nmasses, over one magnitude lower than the others, and that the active S0s\nlocate mainly in the sparse environment, while the normal S0s in the dense\nenvironment, which might suggest that the environment plays an important role\nin quenching star formation and/or AGN activity in S0 galaxies. By performing\nbulge-disk decomposition of 45 star-forming S0s in {\\em g}- and {\\em r}-bands\nwith the 2D fitting software \\textsc{Galfit}, as well as exploiting the catalog\nof 2D photometric decompositions of \\citet{Meert2015}, we find that the bulges\nof $\\sim$ 1/3 star-forming S0 galaxies (16/45) are bluer than their disks,\nwhile for other types of S0s, the bulge and disk components show similar color\ndistributions. Besides, the S\\'{e}rsic index of most star-forming S0s bulges is\nless than 2, while for normal S0s, it is between 2 and 6.\n", "  Intrinsic entanglement (IE) is a quantity which aims at quantifying bipartite\nentanglement carried by a quantum state as an optimal amount of the intrinsic\ninformation that can be extracted from the state by measurement. We investigate\nin detail the properties of a Gaussian version of IE, the so-called Gaussian\nintrinsic entanglement (GIE). We show explicitly how GIE simplifies to the\nmutual information of a distribution of outcomes of measurements on a\nconditional state obtained by a measurement on a purifying subsystem of the\nanalyzed state, which is first minimized over all measurements on the purifying\nsubsystem and then maximized over all measurements on the conditional state. By\nconstructing for any separable Gaussian state a purification and a measurement\non the purifying subsystem which projects the purification onto a product\nstate, we prove that GIE vanishes on all Gaussian separable states. Via\nrealization of quantum operations by teleportation, we further show that GIE is\nnon-increasing under Gaussian local trace-preserving operations and classical\ncommunication. For pure Gaussian states and a reduction of the\ncontinuous-variable GHZ state, we calculate GIE analytically and we show that\nit is always equal to the Gaussian R\\'{e}nyi-2 entanglement. We also extend the\nanalysis of IE to a non-Gaussian case by deriving an analytical lower bound on\nIE for a particular form of the non-Gaussian continuous-variable Werner state.\nOur results indicate that mapping of entanglement onto intrinsic information is\ncapable of transmitting also quantitative properties of entanglement and that\nthis property can be used for introduction of a quantifier of Gaussian\nentanglement which is a compromise between computable and physically meaningful\nentanglement quantifiers.\n", "  In this paper we apply a Bayesian technique to determine the best fit of\nstellar evolution models to find the main sequence turn off age and other\ncluster parameters of four intermediate-age open clusters: NGC 2360, NGC 2477,\nNGC 2660, and NGC 3960. Our algorithm utilizes a Markov chain Monte Carlo\ntechnique to fit these various parameters, objectively finding the best-fit\nisochrone for each cluster. The result is a high-precision isochrone fit. We\ncompare these results with the those of traditional \"by-eye\" isochrone fitting\nmethods. By applying this Bayesian technique to NGC 2360, NGC 2477, NGC 2660,\nand NGC 3960, we determine the ages of these clusters to be 1.35 +/- 0.05, 1.02\n+/- 0.02, 1.64 +/- 0.04, and 0.860 +/- 0.04 Gyr, respectively. The results of\nthis paper continue our effort to determine cluster ages to higher precision\nthan that offered by these traditional methods of isochrone fitting.\n", "  We calculate the thermal conductivity of PbTe and PbS with seven different\ntypes of nanoprecipitates using an ab-initio-based Boltzmann transport\napproach. We find that precipitates with realistic size distributions can\nreduce the thermal conductivity well below the predictions of theoretical\nmodels assuming a single precipitate size.We explore the question of how to\ntune this distribution to reduce the thermal conductivity even further. The\npredicted minimum value is strongly correlated with the phonon spectrum of the\nhost material and with the mass density difference between the host and the\ninclusions.\n", "  Computing disconnected diagrams in Lattice QCD (operator insertion in a quark\nloop) entails the computationally demanding problem of taking the trace of the\nall to all quark propagator. We first outline the basic algorithm used to\ncompute a quark loop as well as improvements to this method. Then, we motivate\nand introduce an algorithm based on the synergy between hierarchical probing\nand singular value deflation. We present results for the chiral condensate\nusing a 2+1-flavor clover ensemble and compare estimates of the nucleon charges\nwith the basic algorithm.\n", "  The Zeldovich approximation (ZA) predicts the formation of a web of\nsingularities. While these singularities may only exist in the most formal\ninterpretation of the ZA, they provide a powerful tool for the analysis of\ninitial conditions. We present a novel method to find the skeleton of the\nresulting cosmic web based on singularities in the primordial deformation\ntensor and its higher order derivatives. We show that the A_3-lines predict the\nformation of filaments in a two-dimensional model. We continue with\napplications of the adhesion model to visualise structures in the local (z <\n0.03) universe.\n", "  The task of integrating a large number of independent ODE systems arises in\nvarious scientific and engineering areas. For nonstiff systems, common explicit\nintegration algorithms can be used on GPUs, where individual GPU threads\nconcurrently integrate independent ODEs with different initial conditions or\nparameters. One example is the fifth-order adaptive Runge-Kutta-Cash-Karp\n(RKCK) algorithm. In the case of stiff ODEs, standard explicit algorithms\nrequire impractically small time-step sizes for stability reasons, and implicit\nalgorithms are therefore commonly used instead to allow larger time steps and\nreduce the computational expense. However, typical high-order implicit\nalgorithms based on backwards differentiation formulae (e.g., VODE, LSODE)\ninvolve complex logical flow that causes severe thread divergence when\nimplemented on GPUs, limiting the performance. Therefore, alternate algorithms\nare needed. A GPU-based Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev (RKC) algorithm can handle\nmoderate levels of stiffness and performs significantly faster than not only an\nequivalent CPU version but also a CPU-based implicit algorithm (VODE) based on\nresults shown in the literature. In this chapter, we present the mathematical\nbackground, implementation details, and source code for the RKCK and RKC\nalgorithms for use integrating large numbers of independent systems of ODEs on\nGPUs. In addition, brief performance comparisons are shown for each algorithm,\ndemonstrating the potential benefit of moving to GPU-based ODE integrators.\n", "  Synchronization is the process of achieving identical dynamics among coupled\nidentical units. If the units are different from each other, their dynamics\ncannot become identical; yet, after transients, there may emerge a functional\nrelationship between them -- a phenomenon termed \"generalized synchronization.\"\nHere, we show that the concept of transient uncoupling, recently introduced for\nsynchronizing identical units, also supports generalized synchronization among\nnonidentical chaotic units. Generalized synchronization can be achieved by\ntransient uncoupling even when it is impossible by regular coupling. We\nfurthermore demonstrate that transient uncoupling stabilizes synchronization in\nthe presence of common noise. Transient uncoupling works best if the units stay\nuncoupled whenever the driven orbit visits regions that are locally diverging\nin its phase space. Thus, to select a favorable uncoupling region, we propose\nan intuitive method that measures the local divergence at the phase points of\nthe driven unit's trajectory by linearizing the flow and subsequently\nsuppresses the divergence by uncoupling.\n", "  QCD at finite quark-/baryon-number density, which describes nuclear matter,\nhas a sign problem which prevents direct application of standard simulation\nmethods based on importance sampling. When such finite density is implemented\nby the introduction of a quark-number chemical potential $\\mu$, this manifests\nitself as a complex fermion determinant. We apply simulations using the Complex\nLangevin Equation (CLE) which can be applied in such cases. However, this is\nnot guaranteed to give correct results, so that extensive tests are required.\nIn addition, gauge cooling is required to prevent runaway behaviour. We test\nthese methods on 2-flavour lattice QCD at zero temperature on a small ($12^4$)\nlattice at an intermediate coupling $\\beta=6/g^2=5.6$ and relatively small\nquark mass $m=0.025$, over a range of $\\mu$ values from $0$ to saturation.\nWhile this appears to show the correct phase structure with a phase transition\nat $\\mu \\approx m_N/3$ and a saturation density of $3$ at large $\\mu$, the\nobservables show departures from known values at small $\\mu$. We are now\nrunning on a larger lattice ($16^4$) at weaker coupling $\\beta=5.7$. At $\\mu=0$\nthis significantly improves agreement between measured observables and known\nvalues, and there is some indication that this continues to small $\\mu$s. This\nleads one to hope that the CLE might produce correct results in the\nweak-coupling -- continuum -- limit.\n", "  We discuss spin models on complete graphs in the mean-field (infinite-vertex)\nlimit, especially the classical XY model, the Toy model of the Higgs sector,\nand related generalizations. We present a number of results coming from the\ntheory of large deviations and Stein's method, in particular, Cram\\'er and\nSanov-type results, limit theorems with rates of convergence, and phase\ntransition behavior for these models.\n", "  Fusion energy will be the ultimate clean energy source for mankind. One of\nthe most visible concerns of the future fusion device is the threat of\ndeleterious runaway electrons (REs) produced during unexpected disruptions of\nthe fusion plasma. Both efficient long-term algorithms and super-large scale\ncomputing power are necessary to reveal the complex dynamics of REs in a\nrealistic fusion reactor. In the present study, we deploy the world's fastest\nsupercomputer, Sunway TaihuLight, and the newly developed relativistic\nvolume-preserving algorithm to carry out long-term particle simulations of 10^7\nsampled REs in 6D phase space, which involves simulation scale of 10^18\nparticle-steps, the largest ever achieved in fusion research. Our simulations\nshow that in a realistic fusion reactor, the concern of REs is not as serious\nas previously thought. Specifically, REs are confined much better than\npreviously predicted and the maximum average energy is in the range of 150MeV,\nless than half of previous estimate.\n", "  Piezoelectric actuators have been widely used to form a self-monitoring smart\nsystem to do Structural health monitoring (SHM). One of the most fundamental\nissues in using actuators is to determine the actuation effects being\ntransferred from the actuators to the host structure. This report summaries the\nstate of the art of modeling techniques for piezoelectric actuators and\nprovides a numerical analysis of the static and dynamic electromechanical\nbehavior of piezoelectric actuators surface-bonded to an elastic medium under\nin-plane mechanical and electric loads using finite element method. Also case\nstudy is conducted to study the effect of material properties, bonding layer\nand loading frequency using static and harmonic analysis of ANSYS. Finally,\nstresses and displacements are determined, and singularity behavior at the tips\nof the actuator is proved. The results indicate that material properties,\nbonding layers and frequency have a significant influence on the stresses\ntransferred to the host structure.\n", "  We discuss the impact of a swifter cosmological expansion induced by modified\ncosmological history of the universe on scenarios realising electroweak\nbaryogenesis. We detail the possible experimental bounds one can place on such\ncosmological modification and show how the detection capabilities of particle\nmodels are modified within these bounds. On the particle physics side we focus\non the Standard Model supplemented by a dimension six operator which directly\nmodifies the Higgs potential. We show that due to the cosmological\nmodification, electroweak baryogenesis in this model can be realized, with the\nmodification of the triple Higgs coupling below HL-LHC sensitivity.\n", "  The ground state of the two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model is investigated by\nadopting improved wave functions that take into account intersite electron\ncorrelation beyond the Gutzwiller ansatz. The ground-state energy is lowered\nconsiderably, giving the best estimate of the ground-state energy for the 2D\nHubbard model. There is a crossover from weakly to strongly correlated regions\nas the on-site Coulomb interaction $U$ increases. The antiferromagnetic\ncorrelation induced by $U$ is reduced for hole doping when $U$ is large, being\ngreater than the bandwidth, thus increasing the kinetic energy gain. The spin\nand charge fluctuations are induced in the strongly correlated region. These\nantiferromagnetic and kinetic charge fluctuations induce electron pairings,\nwhich would result in high-temperature superconductivity.\n", "  Layer stacking and crystal lattice symmetry play important roles in the band\nstructure and the Landau levels of multilayer graphene. ABA-stacked trilayer\ngraphene possesses mirror-symmetry-protected monolayer-like and bilayer-like\nband structures. Broken mirror symmetry by a perpendicular electric field\ntherefore induces hybridization between these bands and various quantum Hall\nphases emerge. We experimentally explore the evolution of Landau levels in\nABA-stacked trilayer graphene under electric field. We observe a variety of\nvalley and orbital dependent Landau level evolutions. These evolutions are\nqualitatively well explained by considering the hybridization between multiple\nLandau levels possessing close Landau level indices and the hybridization\nbetween every third Landau level orbitals due to the trigonal warping effect.\nThese observations are consistent with numerical calculations. The combination\nof experimental and numerical analysis thus reveals the entire picture of\nLandau level evolutions decomposed into the monolayer- and bilayer-like band\ncontributions in ABA-stacked trilayer graphene.\n", "  We investigated the effect of a Mg-Al layer insertion at the bottom interface\nof epitaxial Fe/$MgAl_{2}O_{4}$/Fe(001) magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) on\ntheir spin-dependent transport properties. The tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR)\nratio and differential conductance spectra for the parallel magnetic\nconfiguration exhibited clear dependence on the inserted Mg-Al thickness. A\nslight Mg-Al insertion (thickness < 0.1 nm) was effective for obtaining a large\nTMR ratio above 200% at room temperature and observing a distinct local minimum\nstructure in conductance spectra. In contrast, thicker Mg-Al (> 0.2 nm) induced\na reduction of TMR ratios and featureless conductance spectra, indicating a\ndegradation of the bottom-Fe/$MgAl_{2}O_{4}$ interface. Therefore, a minimal\nMg-Al insertion was found to be effective to maximize the TMR ratio for a\nsputtered $MgAl_{2}O_{4}$-based MTJ.\n", "  The long-term evolution of epidemic processes depends crucially on the\nstructure of contact networks. As empirical evidence indicates that human\npopulations exhibit strong community organization, we investigate here how such\nmesoscopic configurations affect the likelihood of epidemic recurrence. Through\nnumerical simulations on real social networks and theoretical arguments using\nspectral methods, we demonstrate that highly contagious diseases that would\nhave otherwise died out rapidly can persist indefinitely for an optimal range\nof modularity in contact networks.\n", "  We study temperature dependence of the topological susceptibility with the\n$N_{f}=2+1$ flavors Wilson fermion. We have two major interests in this paper.\nOne is a comparison of gluonic and fermionic definitions of the topological\nsusceptibility. Two definitions are related by the chiral Ward-Takahashi\nidentity but their coincidence is highly non-trivial for the Wilson fermion. By\napplying the gradient flow both for the gauge and quark fields we find a good\nagreement of these two measurements. The other is a verification of a\nprediction of the dilute instanton gas approximation at low temperature region\n$T_{pc}< T<1.5T_{pc}$, for which we confirm the prediction that the topological\nsusceptibility decays with power $\\chi_{t}\\propto(T/T_{pc})^{-8}$ for three\nflavors QCD.\n", "  The construction of reciprocal relationships requires cooperative\ninteractions during the initial meetings. However, cooperative behavior with\nstrangers is risky because the strangers may be exploiters. In this study, we\nshow that people increase the likelihood of cooperativeness of strangers by\nusing lightweight non-risky interactions in risky situations based on the\nanalysis of a social network game (SNG). They can construct reciprocal\nrelationships in this manner. The interactions involve low-cost signaling\nbecause they are not generated at any cost to the senders and recipients.\nTheoretical studies show that low-cost signals are not guaranteed to be\nreliable because the low-cost signals from senders can lie at any time.\nHowever, people used low-cost signals to construct reciprocal relationships in\nan SNG, which suggests the existence of mechanisms for generating reliable,\nlow-cost signals in human evolution.\n", "  Notions like meaning, signal, intentionality, are difficult to relate to a\nphysical word. I study a purely physical definition of \"meaningful\ninformation\", from which these notions can be derived. It is inspired by a\nmodel recently illustrated by Kolchinsky and Wolpert, and improves on Dretske\nclassic work on the relation between knowledge and information. I discuss what\nmakes a physical process into a \"signal\".\n", "  A detailed study of the evolution of the magnetoresistance was performed on\nelectrodeposited Co/Cu multilayers with Cu layer thicknesses ranging from 0.5\nnm to 4.5 nm. For thin Cu layers (up to 1.5 nm), anisotropic magnetoresistance\n(AMR) was observed whereas multilayers with thicker Cu layers exhibited clear\ngiant magnetoresistance (GMR) behaviour. The GMR magnitude increased up to\nabout 3.5 to 4 nm Cu layer thickness and slightly decreased afterwards.\nAccording to magnetic measurements, all samples exhibited ferromagnetic (FM)\nbehaviour. The relative remanence turned out to be about 0.75 for both AMR and\nGMR type multilayers. This clearly indicates the absence of an\nantiferromagnetic (AF) coupling between adjacent magnetic layers for Cu layers\neven above 1.5 nm where the GMR effect occurs. The AMR behaviour at low spacer\nthicknesses indicates the presence of strong FM coupling (due to, e.g.,\npin-holes in the spacer and/or areas of the Cu layer where the layer thickness\nis very small). With increasing spacer thickness, the pin-hole density reduces\nand/or the layer thickness uniformity improves which both lead to a weakening\nof the FM coupling. This improvement in multilayer structure quality results in\na better separation of magnetic layers and the weaker coupling (or complete\nabsence of interlayer coupling) enables a more random magnetization orientation\nof adjacent layers, all this leading to an increase of the GMR. Coercive field\nand zero-field resistivity measurements as well as the results of a structural\nstudy reported earlier on the same multilayers provide independent evidence for\nthe microstructural features established here. The large GMR reported\npreviously on such Co/Cu multilayers at Cu layer thicknesses around 1 nm can be\nattributed to the presence of a fairly large superparamagnetic (SPM) fraction\nrather than being due to a strong AF coupling.\n", "  In this work we analyse the structure of a subspace of the phase space of the\nstar-forming region NGC~ 2264 using the Spectrum of Kinematic Groupings (SKG).\nWe show that the SKG can be used to process a collection of star data to find\nsubstructure at different scales. We have found structure associated with the\nNGC~ 2264 region and also with the background area. In the NGC~ 2264 region, a\nhierarchical analysis shows substructure compatible with that found in previous\nspecific studies of the area but with an objective, compact methodology that\nallows us to homogeneously compare the structure of different clusters and\nstar-forming regions. Moreover, this structure is compatible with the different\nages of the main NGC~ 2264 star-forming populations. The structure found in the\nfield can be roughly associated with giant stars far in the background,\ndynamically decoupled from NGC~ 2264, which could be related either with the\nOuter Arm or Monoceros Ring. The results in this paper confirm the relationship\nbetween structure in the RV phase-space subspace and different kinds of\npopulations, defined by other variables not necessarily analysed with the SKG,\nsuch as age or distance, showing the importance of detecting phase-space\nsubstructure in order to trace stellar populations in the broadest sense of the\nword.\n", "  An unusual type of mechanical behavior was registered while studying the\nswollen hydrogel compositions \"cellulose-polyacrylamide\" in the conditions of\nmultiple cyclic compression tests with the broad variation of the deformation\nspeed. While increasing the deformation speed the clearly seen inversion of the\npositions of compression and decompression parts of the cyclic stress-strain\ncurves was detected. While carrying out the cyclic compression tests with\nrelatively low deformation speed (about 100-200 % of the initial sample's\nheight per minute) the well defined hysteresis of the stress-strain curve can\nde seen and in these conditions the decompression part of the curve is situated\ninferior the part corresponding to compression. But while increasing the speed\nof the deformation the tendency to the progressive approach of the compression\nand decompression curves to each other is clearly seen. This effect results in\nthe full disappearance of the hysteresis at some value of the deformation\nspeed: the decompression curve coincides with the compression curve. Along with\nthe further increase of the deformation speed the hysteresis appears again but\nthe curve corresponding to compression process is situated inferior the curve\ncorresponding to decompression: the \"inversion\" of the hysteresis was detected.\nThe precise character of this process depends upon the stiffness of the\nhydrogel under study. Up to date the convincing explanation of this effect can\nnot been put forward. The authors can only present some hypotheses to explain\nthis phenomenon.\n", "  The paper deals with an analytical study of various corrected Newtonian\npotentials. We offer a complete description of the corrected potentials, for\nthe entire range of the parameters involved. These parameters can be fixed for\ndifferent models in order to obtain a good concordance with known data. Some of\nthe potentials are generated by continued fractions, and another one is derived\nfrom the Newtonian potential by adding a logarithmic correction. The zonal\npotential, which models the motion of a satellite moving in the equatorial\nplane of the Earth, is also considered. The range of the parameters for which\nthe potentials behave or not similarly to the Newtonian one is pointed out. The\nshape of the potentials is displayed for all the significant cases, as well as\nthe orbit of Raduga-1M 2 satellite in the field generated by the continued\nfractional potential U3, and then by the zonal one. For the continued\nfractional potential U2 we study the basic problem of the existence and linear\nstability of circular orbits. We prove that such orbits exist and are linearly\nstable. This qualitative study offers the possibility to choose the adequate\npotential, either for modeling the motion of planets or satellites, or to\nexplain some phenomena at galactic scale.\n", "  Crack growth behaviour along the coherent twin boundary (CTB), i.e.,\n$\\Sigma$3{112} of BCC Fe is investigated using molecular dynamics (MD)\nsimulations. The growth of an atomistically sharp crack with {112}$<$110$>$\norientation has been examined along the two opposite $<$111$>$ directions of\nCTB under mode-I loading at a constant strain rate. Separate MD simulations\nwere carried out with crack inserted in the left side, right side and middle of\nthe specimen model system. The results indicate that the crack grows\ndifferently along the two opposite $<$111$>$ directions. In case of a crack\ninserted in the left side, the crack grows in ductile manner, while it\npropagates in semi-brittle manner in the case of crack inserted in the right\nside. The directional dependence of crack growth along the CTB is also\nconfirmed by the stress-strain behaviour. This anisotropy in crack growth\nbehaviour has been attributed to the twinning-antitwinning asymmetry of\n1/6$<$111$>$ partial dislocations on {112} planes.\n", "  We report on a measurement of the attenuation length for the scintillation\nlight in the tonne size liquid argon target of the ArDM dark matter experiment.\nThe data was recorded in the first underground operation of the experiment in\nsingle-phase operational mode. The results were achieved by comparing the light\nyield spectra from 39-Ar and 83m-Kr to a description of the ArDM setup with a\nmodel of full light ray tracing. A relatively low value close to 0.5 m was\nfound for the attenuation length of the liquid argon bulk to its own\nscintillation light. We interpret this result as a presence of optically active\nimpurities in the liquid argon which are not filtered by the installed\npurification systems. We also present analyses of the argon gas employed for\nthe filling and discuss cross sections in the vacuum ultraviolet of various\nmolecules in respect to purity requirements in the context of large liquid\nargon installations.\n", "  Conformal symmetry is broken by a flat or spherical defect operator\n$\\mathcal{D}$. We show that this defect operator, may be identified as a pair\nof twist operators which are inserted at the tips of its causal diamond. Any\n$k-$point correlation function in a flat or spherical defect CFT is equivalent\nto a $(k+2)-$point correlation function. We reproduce one point correlation\nfunctions and also solve two point correlation functions in defect CFTs .\nMutual R\\'enyi entropy is computed and agrees with previous result in a certain\nlimit. We conjecture there may be universal terms in general co-dimension two\ndefect CFTs.\n", "  The Generalized Eigenvalue Problem (GEVP) has been used extensively in the\npast in order to reliably extract energy levels from time-dependent Euclidean\ncorrelators calculated in Lattice QCD. We propose a formulation of the GEVP in\nfrequency space. Our approach consists of applying the model-independent\nBackus-Gilbert method to a set of Euclidean two-point functions with common\nquantum numbers. A GEVP analysis in frequency space is then applied to a matrix\nof estimators that allows us, among other things, to obtain particular linear\ncombinations of the initial set of operators that optimally overlap to\ndifferent local regions in frequency. We apply this method to lattice data from\nNRQCD. This approach can be interesting both for vacuum physics as well as for\nfinite-temperature problems.\n", "  Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been performed to investigate the\nfatigue deformation behaviour of polycrystalline Cu with grain size of 5.4 nm.\nThe samples were prepared using Voronoi algorithm with random grain\norientations. Fatigue simulations were carried out by employing fully reversed,\ntotal strain controlled cyclic loading at strain amplitude of $\\pm4$\\% for 10\ncycles. The MD simulation results indicated that the deformation behaviour\nunder cyclic loading is dominated by the slip of partial dislocations enclosing\nthe stacking faults. At higher number of cycles, the grain boundary migration\nleading to coarsening of larger grains at the expense of the smaller grains has\nbeen observed. The cyclic stress-strain behaviour, the deformation mechanisms\nand the variation of dislocation density as a function of cyclic deformation\nhave been discussed.\n", "  The laser-ranged satellite LARES is expected to provide new refined\nmeasurements of relativistic physics, as well as significant contributions to\nspace geodesy and geophysics. The very low area-to-mass ratio of this passive\nand dense satellite was chosen to reduce as much as possible the disturbing\neffects of non-gravitational perturbations. However, because of its height,\nabout 1450 km compared with about 5800-5900 km for the two LAGEOS satellites,\nLARES is exposed to a much stronger drag due to neutral atmosphere. From a\nprecise orbit determination, analyzing the laser ranging normal points of LARES\nover a time span of about 3.7 years, it was found an average semi-major axis\ndecay rate of -0.999 m per year, corresponding to a non-conservative net force\nwith a mean along-track acceleration of -1.444 x 10^-11 m/s^2. By means of a\nmodified version of the SATRAP (ISTI/CNR) code, the neutral drag perturbation\nacting on LARES was evaluated over the same time span, taking into account the\nreal evolution of solar and geomagnetic activities, with five thermospheric\ndensity models. All of them were able to model most of the observed semi-major\naxis decay, with differences among the average drag coefficients smaller than\n10%. A further independent check carried out analyzing the orbital decay of a\npassive spherical satellite (Ajisai) just 40 km higher than LARES, it was then\nconcluded that some of the currently best models developed for neutral\natmosphere, within their uncertainties and range of applicability, were able to\naccount for most (about 98.6%) of the observed semi-major axis decay of LARES.\nFinally, after modeling the neutral atmosphere drag, a residual semi-major axis\ndecay, corresponding to an average along-track acceleration of about -2 x\n10^-13 m/s^2 (i.e. about 1/72 of neutral drag), was detected as well.\n", "  This paper presents a generalization of the random dot product model for\nnetworks whose edge weights are drawn from a parametrized probability\ndistribution. We focus on the case of integer weight edges and show that many\npreviously studied models can be recovered as special cases of this\ngeneralization. Our model also determines a dimension--reducing embedding\nprocess that gives geometric interpretations of community structure and\ncentrality. The dimension of the embedding has consequences for the derived\ncommunity structure and we exhibit a stress function for determining\nappropriate dimensions. We use this approach to analyze a coauthorship network\nand voting data from the U.S. Senate.\n", "  We present the results of an exploratory study (by means of Monte Carlo\nsimulations on the lattice) of the properties of the gauge-invariant two-point\ncorrelation functions of the gauge-field strengths for $N_f=2$ QCD at zero\ntemperature and in the presence of a magnetic background field: the analysis\nprovides evidence for the emergence of anisotropies in the nonperturbative part\nof the correlators and for an increase of the gluon condensate as a function of\nthe external magnetic field.\n", "  Thirty years ago, the suppression of charmonium production in heavy-ion\ncollisions was first proposed as an unambiguous signature for the formation of\na Quark-Gluon Plasma. Since then, experiments at fixed-target accelerators\n(SPS) and hadronic colliders (RHIC, LHC) have investigated this observable and\ndiscovered a wide range of effects, that have been related to the original\nproposal but at the same time have also prompted a strong development in the\nunderlying theory concepts. In this contribution, I will review the main\nachievements of this field, with emphasis on recent results obtained by LHC\nexperiments.\n", "  In this paper we develop a framework allowing a natural extension of the\nLorentz transformations. To begin, we show that by expanding conventional\nfour-dimensional spacetime to eight-dimensions that a natural generalization is\nindeed obtained. We then find with these generalized coordinate transformations\nacting on Maxwell's equations that the electromagnetic field transformations\nare nevertheless unchanged. We find further, that if we assume the absence of\nmagnetic monopoles, in accordance with Maxwell's theory, our generalized\ntransformations are then restricted to be the conventional ones. While the\nconventional Lorentz transformations are indeed recovered from our framework,\nwe nevertheless provide a new perspective into why the Lorentz transformations\nare constrained to be the conventional ones. Also, this generalized framework\nmay assist in explaining several unresolved questions in electromagnetism as\nwell as to be able to describe quasi magnetic monopoles found in spin-ice\nsystems.\n", "  The simplest epidemiologic model composed by mutually exclusive compartments\nSIR (susceptible-infected-susceptible) is presented to describe a reality. From\nhealth concerns to situations related with marketing, informatics or even\nsociology, several are the fields that are using this epidemiological model as\na first approach to better understand a situation. In this paper, the basic\ntransmission model is analyzed, as well as simple tools that allows us to\nextract a great deal of information about possible solutions. A set of\napplications - traditional and new ones - is described to show the importance\nof this model.\n", "  We review on a recently proposed quantum exception to the second law of\nthermodynamics. We emphasize that $^4$He superflows, like any other forms of\nflows, shall carry entropy or heat in a thermal environment. Following that,\none can use a heterogeneous $^4$He superflow loop to realize entropy-decreasing\nprocesses. We also mention that the heat content of a superflow has an unusual\ndependence on flow velocity, which is an important factor contributing to the\nentropy-decreasing processes.\n", "  In this work, we analyze anomalous effects observed in the operation of two\ndifferent technological devices: a magnetic core and a parallel plate\n(symmetrical or asymmetrical) capacitor. From experimental measurements on both\ndevices, we detected small raised anomalous forces that cannot be explained by\nknown interactions in the traditional theories. As the variations of device\ninertia have not been completely understood by means of current theories, we\nhere propose a theoretical framework in which the anomalous effects can\nconsistently be explained by a preexisting state of quantum entanglement\nbetween the external environment and either magnetic dipoles of magnetic cores\nor electric dipoles of capacitors, so that the effects would be manifested by\nthe application of a strong magnetic field on the former or an intense electric\nfield on the latter. The values of the macroscopic observables calculated in\nsuch a theoretical framework revealed good agreement with the experimental\nmeasurements performed in both cases, so that the non - locality hypothesis\nbased on the generalized quantum correlation between dipoles and environment is\nconsistent as explanation for the anomalous effects observed. The control and\nenhancement of the effect can allow the future viability of a new technology\nbased on electric propulsion of rockets and aircrafts.\n", "  We combine all the reliably-measured eigenperiods for hot, short-period ZZ\nCeti stars onto one diagram and show that it has the features expected from\nevolutionary and pulsation theory. To make a more detailed comparison with\ntheory we concentrate on a subset of 16 stars for which rotational splitting or\nother evidence gives clues to the spherical harmonic index (l) of the modes.\nThe suspected l=1 periods in this subset of stars form a pattern of consecutive\nradial overtones that allow us to conduct ensemble seismology using published\ntheoretical model grids. We find that the best-matching models have hydrogen\nlayer masses most consistent with the canonically thick limit calculated from\nnuclear burning. We also find that the evolutionary models with masses and\ntemperatures from spectroscopic fits cannot correctly reproduce the periods of\nthe k=1 to 4 mode groups in these stars, and speculate that the mass of the\nhelium layer in the models is too large.\n", "  Understanding bend-loss in single-ring hollow-core photonic crystal fibers is\nbecoming of increasing importance as the fibers enter practical applications.\nWhile purely numerical approaches are useful, there is a need for a simpler\nanalytical formalism that provides physical insight and can be directly used in\nthe design of PCFs with low bend-loss. We show theoretically and experimentally\nthat a wavelength-dependent critical bend radius exists below which the\nbend-loss reaches a maximum, and that this can be calculated from the\nstructural parameters of a fiber using a simple analytical formula. This allows\nstraightforward design of single-ring PCFs that are bend-insensitive for\nspecified ranges of bend radius and wavelength. It also can be used to derive\nan expression for the bend radius that yields optimal higher-order mode\nsuppression for a given fiber structure.\n", "  We use a combination of quark-antiquark and $B^{(*)}K$ interpolating fields\nto predict the mass of two QCD bound states below the $B^*K$ threshold in the\nquantum channels $J^P=0^+$ and $1^+$. The mesons correspond to the b-quark\ncousins of the $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$ and have not yet been\nobserved in experiment, even though they are expected to be found by LHCb. In\naddition to these predictions, we obtain excellent agreement of the remaining\np-wave energy levels with the known $B_{s1}(5830)$ and $B_{s2}^*(5840)$ mesons.\nThe results from our first principles calculation are compared to previous\nmodel-based estimates. More recently the D0 collaboration claimed the existence\nof an exotic resonance $X(5568)$ with exotic flavor content $\\bar{b}s\\bar{d}u$.\nIf such a state with $J^P=0^+$ exists, only the decay into $B_s\\pi$ is open\nwhich makes a lattice search for this state much cleaner and simpler than for\nother exotic candidates involving heavy quarks. We conclude, however, that we\ndo not find such a candidate in agreement with a recent LHCb result.\n", "  A 32 GHz bandwidth VLBI capable correlator and phased array has been designed\nand deployed at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory's Submillimeter Array\n(SMA). The SMA Wideband Astronomical ROACH2 Machine (SWARM) integrates two\ninstruments: a correlator with 140 kHz spectral resolution across its full 32\nGHz band, used for connected interferometric observations, and a phased array\nsummer used when the SMA participates as a station in the Event Horizon\nTelescope (EHT) Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) array. For each SWARM\nquadrant, Reconfigurable Open Architecture Computing Hardware (ROACH2) units\nshared under open source from the Collaboration for Astronomy Signal Processing\nand Electronics Research (CASPER) are equipped with a pair of ultra-fast\nAnalog-to- Digital Converters (ADCs), a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)\nprocessor, and eight 10 Gigabit Ethernet ports. A VLBI data recorder interface\ndesignated the SWARM Digital Back End, or SDBE, is implemented with a ninth\nROACH2 per quadrant, feeding four Mark6 VLBI recorders with an aggregate\nrecording rate of 64 Gbps. This paper describes the design and implementation\nof SWARM, as well as its deployment at SMA with reference to verification and\nscience data.\n", "  Due to their many potential applications, there is an increasing interest in\nstudying hybrid systems composed of optically active media and plasmonic\nmetamaterials. In this work we focus on a particular system which consists of\nan optically active silica core covered by a gold shell. We find that the\nspaser (surface plasmon amplification by stimulated emission of radiation)\nconditions can be found at the poles of the scattering cross section of the\nsystem, a result that remains valid beyond the geometry studied. We explored a\nwide range of parameters that cover most of the usual experimental conditions\nin terms of the geometry of the system and the wavelength of excitation. We\nshow that the conditions of spaser generation necessarily require full loss\ncompensation, but the opposite is not necessarily true. Our results, which are\nindependent of the detailed response of the active medium, provide the gain\nneeded and the wavelength of the spasers that can be produced by a particular\ngeometry, discussing also the possibility of turning the system into optical\namplifiers and SERS (surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy) substrates with huge\nenhancements. We believe that our results can find numerous applications. In\nparticular, they can be useful for experimentalists studying similar systems in\nboth, tuning the experimental conditions and interpreting the results.\n", "  We discuss the quantization of non-ultralocal integrable models directly in\nthe continuous case, using the example of the Alday-Arutyunov-Frolov model. We\nshow that by treating fields as distributions and regularizing the operator\nproduct, it is possible to avoid all the singularities, and allow to obtain\nresults consistent with perturbative calculations. We illustrate these results\nby considering the reduction to the massive free fermion model and extracting\nthe quantum Hamiltonian as well as other conserved charges directly from the\nregularized trace identities. Moreover, we show that our regularization\nrecovers Maillet's prescription in the classical limit.\n", "  We consider a hierarchy of Poisson structures defined on rational functions\non the Riemann sphere. This hierarchy is originated in the theory of the\nintegrable Camassa-Holm equation associated with the Krein's string spectral\nproblem. Previously the proof of Jacobi identity was obtained by reducing the\nbracket to canonical Darboux coordinates. The main result of this note is a\ndirect proof of the Jacobi identity. It turns out that the direct proof of the\nJacobi identity is far from trivial. We also give an example of another\nhierarchy of Poisson brackets and construct Darboux coordinates for it.\n", "  We present first results from the quantitative spectroscopic analysis of 266\nGalactic O-type stars targeted by the IACOB and OWN surveys (implying the\nlargest sample of stars of this type analyzed homogeneously). We also evaluate\nwhat is the present situation regarding available information about distances,\nas provided by the Hipparcos and Gaia missions.\n", "  Given the time-evolution of an electron charge density, the local potential\nin Kohn-Sham time-dependent density functional theory (KS-TDDFT) can be modeled\nas a sum of instantaneous and dynamic contributions by assuming a certain form\nof the time-dependent Kohn-Sham (TD-KS) orbitals. The instantaneous part is\nobtained numerically using methods from ground-state density functional theory\n(DFT) and the dynamic part is expressed in terms of a velocity potential that\ndepends on the electron current density. The suggested form of the TD-KS\norbitals satisfies several known constraints (orthonormality,\nN-representability, J-representability), and the domain of validity is shown to\ndepend on the evolution of the instantaneous quantities. Through this\ndecomposition, we can relate time-dependent and ground -state\nV-representability. The resulting potentials are shown numerically to\napproximate the exact time-dependent Kohn-Sham potentials for a set of 3\nnon-singlet two-particle systems (a Kohn-mode, a Coulomb explosion, and a\ndouble quantum well) where the exact solutions and reference densities are\nknown or obtained through configuration interaction (CI) approaches.\n", "  We present an eigensystem multiscale analysis for proving localization (pure\npoint spectrum with exponentially decaying eigenfunctions, dynamical\nlocalization) for the Anderson model in an energy interval. In particular, it\nyields localization for the Anderson model in a nonempty interval at the bottom\nof the spectrum. This eigensystem multiscale analysis in an energy interval\ntreats all energies of the finite volume operator at the same time,\nestablishing level spacing and localization of eigenfunctions with eigenvalues\nin the energy interval in a fixed box with high probability. In contrast to the\nusual strategy, we do not study finite volume Green's functions. Instead, we\nperform a multiscale analysis based on finite volume eigensystems (eigenvalues\nand eigenfunctions). In any given scale we only have decay for eigenfunctions\nwith eigenvalues in the energy interval, and no information about the other\neigenfunctions. For this reason, going to a larger scale requires new arguments\nthat were not necessary in our previous eigensystem multiscale analysis for the\nAnderson model at high disorder, where in a given scale we have decay for all\neigenfunctions.\n", "  We consider an Ansatz for the study of the existence of formal integrals of\nmotion for Kahan-Hirota-Kimura discretizations. In this context, we give a\ncombinatorial proof of the formula of Celledoni-McLachlan-Owren-Quispel for an\nintegral of motion of the discretization in the case of cubic Hamiltonian\nsystems on symplectic vector spaces and Poisson vector spaces with constant\nPoisson structure.\n", "  In the United States, scientific research in space weather is funded by\nseveral Government Agencies including the National Science Foundation (NSF) and\nthe National Aeronautics and Space Agency (NASA). For commercial purposes,\nspace weather forecast is made by the Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) of\nthe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Observations come\nfrom the network of groundbased observatories funded via various sources, as\nwell as from the instruments on spacecraft. Numerical models used in forecast\nare developed in the framework of individual research projects. Later, the most\npromising models are selected for additional testing at SWPC. In order to\nincrease the application of models in research and education, NASA in\ncollaboration with other agencies created Community Coordinated Modeling Center\n(CCMC). In mid-1990, US scientific community presented compelling evidence for\ndeveloping the National Program on Space Weather, and in 1995, such program has\nbeen formally created. In 2015, the National Council on Science and Technology\nissued two documents: the National Space Weather Strategy [1] and the Action\nPlan [2]. In the near future, these two documents will define the development\nof Space Weather research and forecasting activity in USA. Both documents\nemphasize the need for close international collaboration in area of space\nweather.\n", "  Based on the molecular emission in the $^{12}$CO(2-1) and $^{13}$CO(2-1)\nlines, and the continuum emission in the MIR and FIR towards the S21 IR dust\nbubble, we analyze the physical characteristics of the gas and dust linked to\nthe nebula and the presence of young stellar objects (YSOs) in its environs.\nThe line emission reveals a clumpy molecular shell, 1.4 pc in radius,\nencircling S21. The total molecular mass in the shell amounts to 2900 solar\nmasses and the original ambient density, 2.1 x 10$^3$ cm$^{-3}$, indicating\nthat the bubble is evolving in a high density interstellar medium. The image at\n24 $\\mu$m shows warm dust inside the bubble, while the emission in the range\n250 to 870 $\\mu$m reveal cold dust in its outskirts, coincident with the\nmolecular gas. The detection of radio continuun emission indicates that the\nbubble is a compact HII region. A search for YSOs using photometric criteria\nallowed to identify many candidates projected onto the molecular clumps. We\nanalize if the collect and collapse process has triggered a new generation of\nstars.\n", "  Collimation with hollow electron beams is currently one of the most promising\nconcepts for active halo control in the HL-LHC. In order to further increase\nthe diffusion rates for a fast halo removal as e.g. desired before the squeeze,\nthe electron lens (e-lens) can be operated in pulsed mode. In case of profile\nimperfections in the electron beam the pulsing of the e-lens induces noise on\nthe proton beam which can, depending on the frequency content and strength,\nlead to emittance growth. In order to study the sensitivity to the pulsing\npattern and the amplitude, a beam study (machine development MD) at the LHC has\nbeen proposed for August 2016 and we present in this note the preparatory\nsimulations and estimates.\n", "  For an unknown eigenstate $|\\psi\\rangle$ of a unitary operator $U$, suppose\nwe have an estimate of the corresponding eigenvalue which is separated from all\nother eigenvalues by a minimum gap of magnitude $\\Delta$. In the\neigenstate-marking problem (EMP), the goal is to implement a selective phase\ntransformation of the $|\\psi\\rangle$ state (known as \\emph{marking} the\n$|\\psi\\rangle$ state in the language of the quantum search algorithms). The EMP\nfinds important applications in the construction of several quantum algorithms.\nThe best known algorithm for the EMP combines the ideas of the phase estimation\nalgorithm and the majority-voting. It uses $\\Theta(\\frac{1}{\\Delta}\\ln\n\\frac{1}{\\epsilon})$ applications of $U$ where $\\epsilon$ is the tolerable\nerror. It needs $\\Theta\\left(\\ln \\frac{1}{\\Delta}\\right)$ ancilla qubits for\nthe phase estimation and another $\\Theta\\left(\\ln \\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\right)$\nancilla qubits for the majority-voting.\n  In this paper, we show that the majority-voting is not a crucial requirement\nfor the EMP and the same purpose can also be achieved using the fixed-point\nquantum search algorithm which does not need any ancilla qubits. In the case of\nmajority-voting, these ancilla qubits were needed to do controlled\ntransformations which are harder to implement physically. Using fixed-point\nquantum search, we get rid off these $\\Theta\\left(\\ln\n\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\right)$ ancilla qubits and same number of controlled\ntransformations. Thus we get a much simpler algorithm for marking the unknown\neigenstates. However, the required number of applications of $U$ increases by\nthe factor of $\\Theta \\left(\\ln \\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\right)$. This tradeoff can\nbe beneficial in typical situations where spatial resources are more\nconstrained or where the controlled transformations are very expensive.\n", "  We report a significant change in friction of a $\\rm La_{0.55}Ca_{0.45}MnO_3$\nthin film measured as a function of the materials resistive state under\nultrahigh vacuum conditions at room temperature by friction force microscopy.\nWhile friction is high in the insulating state, it clearly changes to lower\nvalues if the probed local region is switched to the conducting state via\nnanoscale resistance switching. Thus we demonstrate active control of friction\nwithout having to change the temperature or pressure. Upon switching back to an\ninsulating state the friction increases again. The results are discussed in the\nframework of electronic friction effects and electrostatic interactions.\n", "  We have obtained 53 images with the $g$ filter and 19 images with the $i$\nfilter, each with 600-second exposures of the super metal rich open cluster NGC\n6253 with the Gemini-South telescope to create deep images of the cluster to\nobserve the cluster white dwarfs for the first time. We will analyze the white\ndwarf luminosity function to measure the cluster's white dwarf age, search for\nany anomalous features (as has been seen in the similarly metal rich cluster\nNGC 6791), and constrain the initial-final mass relation at high metallicities.\nWe present an update on these observations and our program to study the\nformation of white dwarfs in super high metallicity environments.\n", "  We show that the rapid formation of super-massive black holes in quasars can\nindeed be understood in terms of major galaxy mergers followed by disk\naccretion. The necessary short disk evolution time can be achieved provided the\ndisk viscosity is sufficiently large, which, for instance, is the case for\nhydrodynamic turbulence, unlimited by shock dissipation. We present numerical\ncalculations for a representative case. This general picture can account for\n(a) the presence of highly luminous quasars at redshifts z > 6; (b) for the\npeak in quasar activity at z ~ 2; and (c) for a subsequent rapid disappearance\nof quasars at later epochs.\n", "  RXTE and BeppoSAX observations have yielded evidence for the presence of a\nsecondary power-law spectral component in the spectra of several clusters of\ngalaxies. This emission in clusters with extended regions of radio emission is\nlikely to be by relativistic electrons that are Compton scattered by the CMB.\nThe radio and non-thermal (NT) X-ray measurements yield the values of the\nvolume-averaged magnetic field and electron energy density in the cluster\nextragalactic environment. These directly deduced quantities provide a tangible\nbasis for the study of NT phenomena in clusters.\n", "  We use the results from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) for\nthe locations of peaks and troughs of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)\npower spectrum, together with constraints from large-scale structure, to study\na quintessence model in which the pure exponential potential is modified by a\npolynomial factor. Our analysis, in the $(\\Omega_m, h, n_s)$ cosmological\nparameters space shows that this quintessence model is favoured compared to\n$\\Lambda$CDM for $n_s\\approx 1$ and relatively high values of early\nquintessence; for $n_s<1$, quintessence and $\\Lambda$CDM give similar results,\nexcept for high values of early quintessence, in which case $\\Lambda$CDM is\nfavoured.\n", "  We generate the 2-dimensional high-resolution density field of galaxies of\nthe Early Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Las Campanas\nRedshift Survey with a smoothing length 0.8 Mpc/h to extract clusters and\ngroups of galaxies, and a low-resolution field with a smoothing length 10 Mpc/h\nto extract superclusters of galaxies. We investigate properties of density\nfield clusters and superclusters and compare the properties of these clusters\nand superclusters with those of Abell clusters, and superclusters found on the\nbasis of Abell clusters. We found that clusters in a high-density environment\nhave a luminosity a factor of 5 - 10 higher than in a low-density environment.\nClusters and superclusters in the Northern slice of SDSS are much richer than\nthose in the Southern slice.\n", "  I review the current knowledge of high-energy emission from extragalctic\njets. First I discuss gamma-ray emission from blazars, which provides us\nnumerous precious information on the innermost portions of the relativistic\njets. I describe the constraints on the dynamics of the jet from the subpc to\nthe pc scale provided by recent VLBI studies of TeV sources, together with the\nmodelling of the emission from the blazar jet. Finally I discuss high energy\nemission from large scale jets as seen by Chandra and I report on the expected\ngamma-ray emission from large-scale regions of jets.\n", "  A new method to study the effects of neutrino masses on a supernova neutrino\nsignal is proposed. The method relies exclusively on the analysis of the full\nstatistics of neutrino events, it is independent of astrophysical assumptions,\nand does not require the observation of any additional phenomenon to trace\npossible delays in the neutrino arrival times. A statistics of several\nthousands of events as could be collected by SuperKamiokande, would allow to\nexplore a neutrino mass range somewhat below 1eV.\n", "  The present status of anisotropy studies for the highest energy cosmic rays\nis presented including the first full sky survey. Directions and prospects for\nthe future are also discussed in light of new statistical methods and the last\nquantities of data expected in the near future from the Pierre Auger\nObservatory.\n", "  We introduce the concepts of adiabatic (curvature) and isocurvature (entropy)\ncosmological perturbations and present their relevance for parameter estimation\nfrom cosmic microwave background anisotropies data. We emphasize that, while\npresent-day data are in excellent agreement with pure adiabaticity, subdominant\nisocurvature contributions cannot be ruled out. We discuss model independent\nconstraints on the isocurvature contribution. Finally, we argue that the Planck\nsatellite will be able to do precision cosmology even if the assumption of\nadiabaticity is relaxed.\n", "  The discovery of a supernova emerging at late times in the afterglow of GRB\n030329 has apparently settled the issue on the nature of the progenitor of\ngamma-ray bursts. We now know that at least a fraction of cosmological GRBs are\nassociated with the death of massive stars, and that the two explosions are\nmost likely simultaneous. Even though the association was already suggested for\nGRB 980425, the peculiarity of that burst did not allow to extend the\nassociation to all GRBs. The issue is now to understand whether GRB 030329 is a\n\"standard burst\" or not. I will discuss some peculiarities of GRB 030329 and\nits afterglow lightcurve showing how, rather than a classical cosmological GRB,\nit looks more like a transition object linking weak events like GRB 980425 to\nthe classical long duration GRBs. I will also discuss the problems faced by the\nHypernova scenario to account for the X-ray features detected in several GRBs\nand their afterglows.\n", "  Recent observations with Chandra and XMM-Newton, aided by broad-band spectral\ncoverage from RXTE, have revealed skewed relativistic iron emission lines in\nstellar-mass Galactic black hole systems. Such systems are excellent\nlaboratories for testing General Relativity, and relativistic iron lines\nprovide an important tool for making such tests. In this contribution to the\nProceedings of the 10th Annual Marcel Grossmann Meeting on General Relativity,\nwe briefly review recent developments and present initial results from fits to\narchival ASCA observations of Galactic black holes. It stands to reason that\nrelativistic effects, if real, should be revealed in many systems (rather than\njust one or two); the results of our archival work have borne-out this\nexpectation. The ASCA spectra reveal skewed, relativistic lines in XTE\nJ1550-564, GRO J1655-40, GRS 1915+105, and Cygnus X-1.\n", "  I discuss the stability of accretion disks when the black hole is considered\nto be rotating. I show, how the fluid properties get changed for different\nchoices of angular momentum of black holes. I treat the problem in\npseudo-Newtonian approach with a suitable potential from Kerr geometry. When\nthe angular momentum of a black hole is considered to be significant, the valid\ndisk parameter region affects and a disk may become unstable. Also the\npossibility of shock in an accretion disk around rotating black holes is\nchecked. When the black hole is chosen to be rotating, the sonic locations of\nthe accretion disk get shifted or disappear, making the disk unstable by means\nof loosing entropy. To bring the disk in a stable situation, the angular\nmomentum of the accreting matter has to be reduced/enhanced (for\nco/counter-rotating disk) by means of some physical process.\n", "  We describe kHz QPOs from the hydrodynamical model of accretion disks for\nLMXB systems. Out of the pair, the higher frequency originates due to the\nviscous effects of an accretion disk involving the formation of shock, while\nthe lower one is due to the Keplerian motion of accreting matter. Comparing our\nresults with observations for two fast rotating compact stellar candidates,\nnamely, 4U 1636-53 and KS 1731-260, we find that they match to a very good\napproximation.\n", "  A brief summary of the main properties of the unidentified gamma-ray sources\ndetected by EGRET is presented, with particular emphasis on the different\npopulations and their phenomenological characteristics.\n", "  A derivation of the \\gamma\\gamma --> e^+ e^- optical depth for \\gamma rays\nproduced in a comoving spherical emitting region is presented. Employing a\nsimplified expression for the \\gamma\\gamma absorption cross section, analytic\nexpressions for the minimum Doppler factor implied by the requirement of\ngamma-ray transparency are derived for a broken power-law spectrum of target\nphotons which are isotropically distributed in the comoving frame. Application\nto specific systems is illustrated.\n", "  Evidence is mounting that some Ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) may\ncontain accreting intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). We review the current\nobservational evidence for IMBH-ULXs. While low-luminosity ULXs with L_X <~\n10^39.5 erg/s (assuming isotropic emission) are consistent with mildly X-ray\nbeamed high-mass X-ray binaries, there are a considerable number of ULXs with\nlarger X-ray luminosities that are not easily explained by these models. Recent\nhigh-S/N XMM X-ray spectra are showing an increasing number of ULXs with ``cool\ndisks'' -- accretion disks with multi-color blackbody inner disk temperatures\nkT_in ~ 0.1-0.2 keV, consistent with accreting IMBHs. Optical emission-line\nstudies of ULX nebulae provide useful measurements of X-ray energetics, and can\nthus determine if the X-rays are emitted isotropically. Analysis of an optical\nspectrum of the Ho II ULX nebulae implies an X-ray energy source with ~10^40\nerg/s is present, suggesting an isotropically-emitting IMBH. The spatial\ncoincidence of ULXs with dense star clusters (young clusters and globular\nclusters) suggests that IMBHs formed in these clusters could be the compact\nobjects in the associated ULXs. Quasi-periodic oscillations and frequency\nbreaks in XMM power-density spectra of ULXs also suggest that the black hole\nmasses are more consistent with IMBHs than stellar-mass black holes. Since\n_all_ of these ULXs with evidence for IMBHs are high-luminosity ULXs, i.e., L_X\n>~ 10^40 ergs, we suggest that this class of ULXs is generally powered by\naccreting IMBHs.\n", "  We model the spectral energy distribution of the ultrasoft broad-line AGN RE\nJ2248-511 with Comptonised accretion disc models. These are able to reproduce\nthe steep optical and ultrasoft X-ray slopes, and the derived black hole mass\nis consistent with independent mass estimates. This AGN displays properties of\nboth broad and narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxies, but we conclude that it is\nintrinsically a `normal' Seyfert 1 viewed at high inclination angle.\n", "  The study of the universe at energies above 100 GeV is a relatively new and\nexciting field. The current generation of pointed instruments have detected TeV\ngamma rays from at least 10 sources and the next generation of detectors\npromises a large increase in sensitivity. We have also seen the development of\na new type of all-sky monitor in this energy regime based on water Cherenkov\ntechnology (Milagro). To fully understand the universe at these extreme\nenergies requires a highly sensitive detector capable of continuously\nmonitoring the entire overhead sky. Such an instrument could observe prompt\nemission from gamma-ray bursts and probe the limits of Lorentz invariance at\nhigh energies. With sufficient sensitivity it could detect short transients\n($\\sim$15 minutes) from active galaxies and study the time structure of flares\nat energies unattainable to space-based instruments. Unlike pointed instruments\na wide-field instrument can make an unbiased study of all active galaxies and\nenable many multi-wavelength campaigns to study these objects. This paper\ndescribes the design and performance of a next generation water Cherenkov\ndetector. To attain a low energy threshold and have high sensitivity the\ndetector should be located at high altitude ($>$ 4km) and have a large area\n($\\sim$40,000 m$^2$). Such an instrument could detect gamma ray bursts out to a\nredshift of 1, observe flares from active galaxies as short as 15 minutes in\nduration, and survey the overhead sky at a level of 50 mCrab in one year.\n", "  The observed values of density parameters inevitably involve uncertainties.\nWe study the conditions for detectability and undetectability of cosmic\ntopology in presence of such uncertainties. We present closed analytical forms\nof (un)detectability conditions for infinite redshift, which are important\nbecause: (i) they allow the examine of the detectability of cosmic topology not\nonly for individual manifolds (topologies), but also in whole classes of\nmanifolds; (ii) they are, to a very good approximation, (un)detectibility\nconditions for z=1100.\n", "  We compare the standard single scalar field inflationary predictions with\nthose of an inflationary phase driven by a tachyon field. A slow-roll formalism\nis defined for tachyon inflation and we derive the spectra of scalar and tensor\nperturbations as well as the consistency relations. At lowest order the\npredictions of standard and tachyon inflation are the same. Higher order\ndeviations are present and their observational relevance is discussed. We\ndiscuss the observational consequences of some typical inflationary tachyon\npotentials and compare them with recent data. All the models predict a negative\nand very small running of the scalar spectral index, and they consistently lie\nwithin the 1$\\sigma$ contour of the data set. However, the regime of blue\nscalar spectral index and large gravity waves is not explored by these models.\n", "  The pair separations statistical methods devised to detect the topology of\nthe universe rely on the accurate knowledge of the three-dimensional positions\nof the cosmic sources. The determination of these positions, however, involves\ninevitable observational uncertainties. The only significant (measurable) sign\nof a nontrivial topology in PSH's was shown to be spikes. We briefly report our\nresults concerning the sensitivity of the topological spikes in the presence of\nthe uncertainties in the positions of the cosmic sources, which arise from\nuncertainties in the values of the density parameters.\n", "  We calculate the atmospheric structure of an accretion disk around a Kerr\nblack hole and obtain its X-ray spectrum, which exhibits prominent atomic\ntransitions under certain circumstances. The gravitational and Doppler\n(red)shifts of the C V, C VI, O VII, O VIII, and Fe I-XXVI emission lines are\nobservable in active galaxies. We quantify the line emissivities as a function\nof radius, to identify the effects of atmospheric structure, and to determine\nthe usefulness of these lines for probing the disk energetics. The line\nemissivities do not always scale linearly with the incident radiative energy,\nas in the case of Fe XXV and Fe XXVI. Our model incorporates photoionization\nand thermal balance for the plasma, the hydrostatic approximation perpendicular\nto the plane of the disk, and general relativistic tidal forces. We include\nradiative recombination rates, fluorescence yields, Compton scattering, and\nphotoelectric opacities for the most abundant elements.\n", "  We investigate the role of a possible coupling of dark matter and dark\nenergy. In particular, we explore the consequences of such an interaction for\nthe coincidence problem, i.e., for the question, why the energy densities of\ndark matter and dark energy are of the same order just at the present epoch. We\ndemonstrate, that, with the help of a suitable coupling, it is possible to\nreproduce any scaling solution $\\rho_X \\propto \\rho_M a^\\xi$, where $a$ is the\nscale factor of the Robertson-Walker metric and $\\xi$ is a constant parameter.\n$\\rho_X$ and $\\rho_M$ are the densities of dark energy and dark matter,\nrespectively. Furthermore, we show that an interaction between dark matter and\ndark energy can drive the transition from an early matter dominated era to a\nphase of accelerated expansion with a stable, stationary ratio of the energy\ndensities of both components.\n", "  Accurate accounting of particle number and 4-momentum in radiative transfer\nmay be facilitated by the use of transport equations that allow transparent\nconversion between volume and surface integrals in both spacetime and momentum\nspace. Such conservative formulations of general relativistic radiative\ntransfer in multiple spatial dimensions are presented, and their relevance to\ncore-collapse supernova simulations described.\n", "  This rapporteur review summarizes results presented in Parallel Session GBT2\n(Gamma Ray Burst Theory 2) on the Collapsar and Supranova Models held 25 July\n2003 at the 10th Marcel Grossmann Meeting on General Relativity, Rio de\nJaneiro, Brazil. A central issue in GRB studies is the process whereby energy\nis released from the GRB engine. One scenario is the collapsar model, where the\nevolved stellar core promptly collapses to a black hole surrounded by a\nmassive, intermittently-accreting torus of nuclear density material. A second\nscenario is the supranova model, where the first step of a two-step collapse\nprocess leaves behind a rapidly rotating neutron star stabilized by rotation,\nwhich later collapses to a black hole while making the GRB. In the supranova\nmodel, a powerful pulsar wind lasting days to weeks after the supernova makes\ndistinctive signatures from the heating of the supernova remnant (SNR) shell,\nwhich should be discovered with Swift. This model also predicts nonstandard\nreddened excesses from the cooling SNR due to the range of delays between the\ntwo collapse events, contrary to observations of SN emissions from low redshift\nGRBs which favor the collapsar model. The observational basis for both models\nis critically reviewed. An outline of a GRB model is proposed where the second\ncollapse takes place within minutes to hours after the primary SN event, during\nwhich time loss of centrifugal support along the rotation axis of the neutron\nstar provides a relatively baryon-clean polar environment along which a newly\nformed, rapidly spinning black hole drives collimated baryon-dilute outflows.\n", "  The annihilation of neutralino dark matter may result in observable signals\nin different wavelength. In the present paper we will discuss the effect of\nneutralino annihilation in the halo of our Galaxy and in its center. According\nto high resolution cold dark matter simulations, large virialized halos are\nformed through the constant merging of smaller halos appeared at previous\ntimes. At each epoch, dark matter halos have then a clumpy component which is\nmade of these merging subhalos. The annihilation of dark matter in these\nclumps, always present in the halo of our Galaxy, may be responsible for\nappreciable fluxes of $\\gamma$-rays, potentially detectable. We find that,\ndepending on the fundamental parameters of the clump density profile and on the\ndistribution of clumps in the Galactic halo, the contribution to the diffuse\n$\\gamma$-ray background from clumps could be used to obtain constraints on the\nneutralino properties such as mass and annihilation cross section. On the other\nhand the annihilation of neutralino dark matter in the galactic center may\nresult in radio signals. At the galactic center, infact, the accretion flow\nonto the central black hole sustains strong magnetic fields that can induce\nsynchrotron emission, in the radio wavelength, by electrons and positrons\ngenerated in neutralino annihilations during advection onto the black hole. We\nfind that the observed emission from the galactic center is consistent with\nneutralinos following a Navarro Frenk and White density profile at the galactic\ncenter while it is inconsistent with the presence of a spike density profile,\nsupposed to be generated by the formation history of the central black hole.\n", "  The cosmic reionization era, which includes formation of the first stars,\ngalaxies, and AGN, is now one of the most active frontiers of cosmological\nresearch. We review briefly our current understanding of the early structure\nformation, and use the ideas about a joint formation of massive black holes\n(which power the early QSOs) and their host galaxies to employ high-redshift\nQSOs as probes of the early galaxy formation and primordial large-scale\nstructure. There is a growing evidence for a strong biasing in the formation of\nthe first luminous sources, which would lead to a clumpy reionization.\nAbsorption spectroscopy of QSOs at z > 6 indicates the end of the reionization\nera at z ~ 6; yet measurements from the WMAP satellite suggest and early\nreionization at z ~ 10 - 20. The first generation of massive stars, perhaps\naided by the early mini-quasars, may have reionized the universe at such high\nredshifts, but their feedback may have disrupted the subsequent star and galaxy\nformation, leading to an extended and perhaps multimodal reionization history\nending by z ~ 6. Observations of gamma-ray bursts from the death events of\nthese putative Population III stars may provide essential insight into the\nprimordial structure formation, reionization, early chemical enrichment, and\nformation of seed black holes which may grow to become central engines of\nluminous quasars.\n", "  (Short version) The nature and the location of the lenses discovered in the\nmicrolensing surveys done so far towards the LMC remain unclear. This\ncontribution is comprised of two distinct parts. In the first part, motivated\nby these questions, we compute the optical depth for the different intervening\npopulations an the number of expected events for self-lensing, using a recently\ndrawn coherent picture of the geometrical structure and dynamics of the LMC\ndisk. In the second part (section 5), a preliminary account of the final\nresults from the EROS-2 programme is presented. Based on the analysis of 33\nmillion LMC and SMC stars followed during 6.7 years, strict limits on the macho\ncontent of the galactic halo are presented; they cover the range of macho\nmasses between 0.0001 and 100 solar mass. The limits are better than 20% (resp.\n5%) of the standard halo for masses between 0.0002 and 10 (resp. 0.001 to 0.1)\nsolar mass. This is presently the data set with the largest sensitivity to halo\nmachos.\n", "  We discuss how disk models may limit the scope of identifying astrophysical\nblack holes. We show that the standard Keplerian thin disk model, the thick\ndisk model, slim disks, ADAFs etc. are fundamentally limited. We present the\nmost complete solution to date called the advective accretion disk and discuss\nhow it has the scope to address every observational aspects of a black hole.\nThough the magnetic field is not fully self-consistently taken care of yet, the\ndetails with which the present model can handle various issues successfully are\nastounding. We present some of the examples.\n", "  From Mercury's perihelion precession (open question from 1845 to 1915) to\nGravity Probe-B satellite (first proposal in 1959, launch in 2004), General\nRelativity had to deal with precession phenomena. Perihelion advancement\nprecession (Einstein), geodetic (de Sitter), gravitomagnetic (Lense-Thirring)\nand spin-spin (Pugh-Schiff) precession are compared with all Newtonian terms in\ncases of weak and strong gravitational fields. Qualitative models and order of\nmagnitude estimates from classical papers are presented.\n", "  Low angular momentum accretion flows very often have centrifugal pressure\nsupported standing shock waves which can accelerate flow particles. The\naccelerated particles in turn emit synchrotron radiation in presence of\nmagnetic fields. Efficient cooling of the electrons reduces its temperature in\ncomparison to the protons. In this paper, we assume two temperature flows to\nexplore this property of shocks and present an example of the emitted radiation\nspectrum.\n", "  We present results of several numerical simulations of two dimensional\nadvective flows which include cooling processes. We show that the computed\nlight curve is similar to the $\\chi$ state in GRS 1915+105. The power density\nspectrum (PDS) also shows presence of QPOs near the break frequency.\n", "  We show that with the wind/jet activity, the spectral index of hard X-ray is\nchanged in galactic microquasars. When mass loss takes place, the spectrum\nbecomes softer and when mass gain takes place, the spectrum becomes harder. We\npresent examples of such changes in GRS1915+105.\n", "  We report the photometric evidence of bullet like features in SS433 in\nX-rays, Infra-red and Radio bands through a multi-wavelength campaign.\n", "  Different studies show that dark matter of non-baryonic origin might exist.\nThere have been experimental evidences that at least one form of dark matter\nhas been detected through microlensing effects. This form of dark matter is\nnamed MACHOs (Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects). The MACHO\ncollaboration estimated that the masses of these objects are to be in the range\n0.15-0.95 solar masses, where the most probable mass is of 0.5 solar masses.\nSome authors argue that MACHOs could be black holes, and that they could form\nbinary systems, BHMACHO binaries. As is well known binary systems are sources\nof gravitational waves. The Brazilian spherical antenna will operate in the\nfrequency band of 3.0-3.4 kHz, sensitive to binaries of a pair of 0.5 solar\nmass black holes just before coalescing. In the present work we study the\ndetectability of these putative BHMACHO binaries by the Brazilian spherical\nantenna Mario Schenberg.\n", "  We outline the confluence of three novel theoretical fields in our modeling\nof Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs): 1) the ultrarelativistic regime of a shock front\nexpanding with a Lorentz gamma factor $\\sim 300$; 2) the quantum vacuum\npolarization process leading to an electron-positron plasma originating the\nshock front; and 3) the general relativistic process of energy extraction from\na black hole originating the vacuum polarization process. There are two\ndifferent classes of GRBs: the long GRBs and the short GRBs. We here address\nthe issue of the long GRBs. [...] We are specially interested, in this report,\nto a subclass of long GRBs which appear to be accompanied by a supernova\nexplosion. We are considering two specific examples: GRB980425/SN1998bw and\nGRB030329/SN2003dh [...].\n", "  Although kilometer-scale neutrino detectors such as IceCube are discovery\ninstruments, their conceptual design is very much anchored to the observational\nfact that Nature produces protons and photons with energies in excess of\n10^{20} eV and 10^{13} eV, respectively. The puzzle of where and how Nature\naccelerates the highest energy cosmic particles is unresolved almost a century\nafter their discovery. We will discuss how the cosmic ray connection sets the\nscale of the anticipated cosmic neutrino fluxes. In this context, we discuss\nthe first results of the completed AMANDA detector and the science reach of its\nextension, IceCube.\n", "  We revise the stability of the tracking solutions and briefly review the\npotentials of quintessence models. We discuss the evolution of linear\nperturbations for $V(\\phi) = V_{0} \\exp(\\lambda \\phi^2/2)$ potential in which\nthe scalar field is non-minimally coupled to cold dark matter. We consider the\neffects of this coupling on both cosmic microwave background temperature\nanisotropies and matter perturbations. We find that the phenomenology of this\nmodel is consistent with current observations up to the coupling power $n_{c}\n\\leq 0.01$ while adopting the current parameters measured by WMAP,\n$\\Omega_{\\phi}^{(0)}=0.76$, $\\Omega_{cdm}^{(0)}=0.191$,\n$\\Omega_{b}^{(0)}=0.049$, and $h=0.70$. Upcoming cosmic microwave background\nobservations continuing to focus on resolving the higher peaks may put strong\nconstraints on the strength of the coupling.\n", "  Sub-millisecond pulsars should be triaxial (Jacobi ellipsoids), which may not\nspin down to super-millisecond periods via gravitation wave radiation during\ntheir lifetimes if they are extremely low mass bare strange quark stars. It is\naddressed that the spindown of sub-millisecond pulsars would be torqued\ndominantly by gravitational wave radiation (with braking index n ~ 5). The\nradio luminosity of sub-millisecond pulsars could be high enough to be detected\nin advanced radio telescopes. Sub-millisecond pulsars, if detected, should be\nvery likely quark stars with low masses and/or small equatorial ellipticities.\n", "  Neutrinos at energies ranging from sub-TeV to EeV from astrophysical sources\ncan yield interesting physical information about fundamental interactions,\nabout cosmic rays and about the nature of the sources and their environment.\nGamma-ray bursts are a leading candidate source, and their expected neutrino\nemission can address a number of current questions, which may be answered with\nforthcoming experiments such as IceCube, Auger, ANITA and KM3NeT.\n", "  Pair production itself prevents the development of dyadospheres, hypothetical\nmacroscopic regions where the electric field exceeds the critical Schwinger\nvalue. Pair production is a self-regulating process that would discharge a\ngrowing electric field, in the example of a hypothetical collapsing charged\nstellar core, before it reached 6% of the minimum dyadosphere value, keeping\nthe pair production rate more than 26 orders of magnitude below the dyadosphere\nvalue.\n", "  The Atmospheric Cherenkov Imaging Technique has opened up the gamma-ray\nspectrum from 100 GeV to 50 TeV to astrophysical exploration. The development\nof the technique (with emphasis on the early days) is described as are the\nbasic principles underlying its application to gamma-ray astronomy. The current\ngeneration of arrays of telescopes, in particular, VERITAS is briefly\ndescribed.\n", "  I discuss neutrino production in supernovae (SNe) and the detection of both\nGalactic core collapse events and the diffuse extra-galactic MeV neutrino\nbackground expected from the integrated history of star formation. In\nparticular, I consider what processes might affect our expectations for both. I\nfocus on ``rapid'' rotation, defined as leading to millisecond initial neutron\nstar spin periods. Rotation affects the neutrino luminosity, the average\nneutrino energy, the duration of the Kelvin-Helmholtz cooling epoch, and the\nratios of luminosities and average energies between neutrino species; it can\nstrongly suppresses the anti-electron as well as mu, anti-mu, tau, and anti-tau\nneutrino fluxes relative to those for the electron neutrinos. As a result,\ndepending on the prevalence of rapid rotation in SN progenitors through cosmic\ntime, this may affect predictions for the MeV neutrino background and the\nhistory of nucleosynthetic enrichment. I emphasize connections between the MeV\nneutrino background and tracers of the star formation rate density at high\nredshift in other neutrino and photon wavebands.\n", "  Galactic dark matter is modelled by a scalar field in order to effectively\nmodify Kepler's law without changing standard Newtonian gravity. In particular,\na solvable toy model with a self-interaction U(Phi) borrowed from\nnon-topological solitons produces already qualitatively correct rotation curves\nand scaling relations. Although relativistic effects in the halo are very\nsmall, we indicate corrections arising from the general relativistic\nformulation. Thereby, we can also probe the weak gravitational lensing of our\nsoliton type halo. For cold scalar fields, it corresponds to a gravitationally\nconfined Boson-Einstein condensate, but of galactic dimensions.\n", "  Several kinds of measurements are combined in an attempt to obtain a\nconsistent estimate of the spectrum and composition of the primary cosmic\nradiation through the knee region. Assuming that the knee is a signal of the\nhigh-energy end of a galactic cosmic-ray population, I discuss possible\nsignatures of a transition to an extra-galactic population and how they might\nbe detected.\n", "  The WIMPs search project PICO-LON has been started with multilayer thin\nNaI(Tl) crystals. The thin (0.05cm) and wide area (5cmx5cm) NaI(Tl) crystals\nwas successfully developed. The performances of thin NaI(Tl) scintillator was\nmeasured and they showed good energy resolution (20% at 60keV) and good\nposition resolution (20% in 5cmx5cm wider area).\n", "  In this talk we review briefly the basic features of non-critical\n(dissipative) String Cosmologies, and we confront some of these models with\nsupernova data. We pay particular attention to the off-shell and dilaton\ncontributions to the dynamical evolution equations of the non-critical string\nUniverse, as well as the Boltzmann equation for species abundances. The latter\ncould have important consequences for the modification of astrophysical\nconstraints on physically appealing particle physics models, such as\nsupersymmetry. The data fits show that non-critical string cosmologies may be\nviable alternatives to LambdaCDM model.\n", "  Some recent results on rotating self-gravitating configurations composed with\nBosons and Fermions are reported. Given a star composed of both Bosons and\nFermions without interaction, it is shown that it is possible to obtain stable\nslowly rotating configurations by using the same perturbative relativistic\nmethod that usually describes neutron stars.\n", "  IceCube is a kilometer scale high-energy neutrino observatory, currently\nunder construction at the South Pole. It is a photo-detector, using the deep\nAntarctic ice as detection medium for the Cherenkov photons induced by\nrelativistic charged particles. These charged particles may be atmospheric\nmuons or reaction products from neutrino interactions in the vicinity of the\ninstrumented volume. The experiment searches for neutrinos originating in\nastrophysical sources, and can also detect neutrinos from WIMP interaction in\nthe Sun or Earth. In the last two austral summers, 9 in-ice strings and 16\nsurface IceTop stations (out of up to 80 planned) were successfully deployed,\nand the detector has been taking data ever since. In this proceedings, IceCube\ndesign, present status, performance and dark matter detection sensitivities\nwill be discussed.\n", "  I review some results on the galaxy/light-mass connection obtained by\ndissipationless simulations in combination with a simple, non-parametric model\nto connect halo circular velocity to the luminosity of the galaxy they would\nhost. I focus on the galaxy-mass correlation and mass-to-light ratios obtained\nfrom galaxy up to cluster scales. The predictions of this simple scheme are\nshown to be in very good agreement with SDSS observations.\n", "  The size and time of formation of the first gravitationally bound objects in\nthe Universe is set by the microphysical properties of the dark matter. It is\nargued that observations seem to favour cold and thermal candidates for the\nmain contribution to the dark matter. For that type of dark matter, the size\nand time of formation of the first halos is determined by the elastic cross\nsections and mass of the CDM particles. Consequently, the astrophysics of CDM\nmight allow us to measure some of the fundamental parameters of CDM particles.\nEssential for observations is the survival rate and spatial distribution of the\nvery first objetcs, which are currently under debate.\n", "  The project of a micro-TPC matrix of chambers of He3 for direct detection of\nnon-baryonic dark matter is outlined. The privileged properties of He3 are\nhighlighted. The double detection (ionization - projection of tracks) will\nassure the electron-recoil discrimination. The complementarity of MIMAC-He3 for\nsupersymmetric dark matter search with respect to other experiments is\nillustrated. The modular character of the detector allows to have different\ngases to get A-dependence. The pressure degreee of freedom gives the\npossibility to work at high and low pressure. The low pressure regime gives the\npossibility to get the directionality of the tracks. The first measurements of\nionization at very few keVs for He3 in He4 gas are described.\n", "  The halo of the Miky Way might contain numerous and dense substructures\ninside which the putative weakly interacting massive particles (suggested as\nthe main constituent of the astronomical dark matter) would produce a stronger\nannihilation signal than in the smooth regions. The closer the nearest clump,\nthe larger the positron and antiproton cosmic ray fluxes at the Earth. But the\nactual distribution of these substructures is not known. The predictions on the\nantimatter yields at the Earth are therefore affected by a kind of cosmic\nvariance whose analysis is the subject of this contribution. The statistical\ntools to achieve that goal are presented and Monte Carlo simulations are\ncompared to analytic results.\n", "  The working principle of axion helioscopes can be behind unexpected solar\nX-ray emission, being associated with solar magnetic fields, which become the\ncatalyst. Solar axion signals can be transient brightenings as well as\ncontinuous radiation. The energy range below 1 keV is a window of opportunity\nfor direct axion searches. (In)direct signatures support axions or the like as\nan explanation of striking behaviour of X-rays from the Sun.\n", "  We review the high-redshift X-ray selected AGN clustering, based on the\nXMM/2dF survey, and compare it with other recent XMM-based results. Using the\nrecent Hasinger et al. (2005) and La Franca et al. (2005) luminosity functions\nwe find that the spatial clustering lengths, derived using Limber's inversion\nequation, are $\\sim 17$ and 20 $h^{-1}$ Mpc for the soft and hard band sources\nwhile their median redshifts are ${\\bar z}\\sim 1.2$ and 0.8, respectively. The\ncorresponding bias factors at $z=\\bar{z}$ are $\\sim 5.3\\pm 0.9$ and $\\sim\n5.1\\pm1.1$, respectively. Within the framework of a flat cosmological model we\nfind that our results support a model with $\\Omega_m \\simeq 0.26$,\n$\\sigma_8\\simeq 0.75$, $h\\simeq 0.72$, w$\\simeq -0.9$ (in excellent agreement\nwith the 3 year WMAP results). We also find the present day bias of X-ray AGNs\nto be $b_{\\circ}\\sim 2$.\n", "  Theoretical aspects of potential astrophysical sources of the highest energy\ncosmic rays are discussed, including their energy budget and some issues on\nparticle escape and propagation. After briefly addressing AGN jets and GRBs, we\nhighlight the possibility of heavy nuclei originating from cluster accretion\nshocks. The importance of X-ray and gamma-ray signatures in addition to\nneutrinos as diagnostic tools for source identification is emphasized.\n", "  We present a systematical theory for the interplay of strong localization\neffects and absorption or gain of classical waves in 3-dimensional, disordered\ndielectrics. The theory is based on the selfconsistent Cooperon resummation,\nimplementing the effects of energy conservation and its absorptive or emissive\ncorrections by an exact, generalized Ward identity. Substantial\nrenormalizations are found, depending on whether the absorption/gain occurs in\nthe scatterers or in the background medium. We find a finite, gain-induced\ncorrelation volume which may be significantly smaller than the scale set by the\nscattering mean free path, even if there are no truly localized modes. Possible\nconsequences for coherent feedback in random lasers as well as the possibility\nof oscillatory in time behavior induced by sufficiently strong gain are\ndiscussed.\n", "  In this chapter we review recent experimental and theoretical work on various\nnovel superfluid phases in fermion systems, that result from pairing fermions\nof different species with unequal densities. After briefly reviewing existing\nexperimental work in superconductors subject to a strong magnetic field and\ntrapped cold fermionic atom systems, we discuss how to characterize the\npossible pairing phases based on their symmetry properties, and the\nstructure/topology of the Fermi surface(s) formed by the unpaired fermions due\nto the density imbalance. We also discuss possible experimental probes that can\nbe used to directly detect the structure of the superfluid order parameter in\nsuperconductors and trapped cold atom systems, which may establish the presence\nof some of these phases unambiguously.\n", "  Physical interpretation of some stationary and non-stationary regions of the\nspinning C-metric is presented. They represent different spacetime regions of a\nuniformly accelerated Kerr black hole.\n  Stability of geodesics corresponding to equilibrium points in a general\nstationary spacetime with an additional symmetry is also studied and results\nare then applied to the spinning C-metric.\n", "  Exact solutions exist which describe impulsive gravitational waves\npropagating in Minkowski, de Sitter, or anti-de Sitter universes. These may be\neither nonexpanding or expanding. Both cases in each background are reviewed\nhere from a unified point of view. All the main methods for their construction\nare described systematically: the Penrose \"cut and paste\" method, explicit\nconstruction of continuous coordinates, distributional limits of sandwich\nwaves, embedding from higher dimensions, and boosts of sources or limits of\ninfinite accelerations.\n  Attention is concentrated on the most interesting specific solutions. In\nparticular, the nonexpanding impulsive waves that are generated by null\nmultipole particles are described. These generalize the well-known\nAichelburg-Sexl and Hotta-Tanaka monopole solutions. Also described are the\nexpanding spherical impulses that are generated by snapping and colliding\nstrings. Geodesics and some other properties of impulsive wave spacetimes are\nalso summarized.\n", "  This article outlines the search for an exact general relativistic\ndescription of the exterior (vacuum) gravitational field of a rotating\nspheroidal black hole surrounded by a realistic axially symmetric disc of\nmatter. The problem of multi-body stationary spacetimes is first exposed from\nthe perspective of the relativity theory and astrophysics, listing the basic\nmethods employed and results obtained. Then, basic formulas for stationary\naxisymmetric solutions are summarized. Remaining sections review what we have\nlearnt with Miroslav Zacek and Tomas Zellerin about certain static and\nstationary situations recently. Although the survey part is quite general, the\nlist of references cannot be complete. Our main desideratum was the informative\nvalue rather than originality -- novelties have been preferred, mainly reviews\nand those with detailed introductions.\n", "  We study a uniform and isotropic cosmology with a decaying vacuum energy\ndensity, in the realm of a model with a time varying gravitational \"constant\".\nWe show that, for late times, such a cosmology is in accordance with the\nobserved values of the cosmological parameters. In particular, we can obtain\nthe observed ratio between the matter density and the total energy density,\nwith no necessity of any fine tuning.\n", "  We examine how the new forthcoming Earth gravity models from the CHAMP and,\nespecially, GRACE missions could improve the measurement of the general\nrelativistic Lense-Thirring effect according to the various kinds of\nobservables which could be adopted. In a very preliminary way, we use the\nrecently released EIGEN2 CHAMP-only and GRACE01S GRACE-only Earth gravity\nmodels in order to assess the impact of the mismodelling in the even zonal\nharmonic coefficients of geopotential which represents one of the major sources\nof systematic errors in this kind of measurement.\n", "  Multidimensional cosmological models with factorizable geometry and their\ndimensional reduction to effective four-dimensional theories are analyzed on\nsensitivity to different scalings. It is shown that a non-correct gauging of\nthe effective four-dimensional gravitational constant within the dimensional\nreduction results in a non-correct rescaling of the cosmological constant and\nthe gravexciton/radion masses. The relationship between the effective\ngravitational constants of theories with different dimensions is discussed for\nsetups where the lower dimensional theory results via dimensional reduction\nfrom the higher dimensional one and where the compactified space components\nvary dynamically.\n", "  Quantum foam, also known as spacetime foam, has its origin in quantum\nfluctuations of spacetime. Its physics is intimately linked to that of black\nholes and computation. Arguably it is the source of the holographic principle\nwhich severely limits how densely information can be packed in space. Various\nproposals to detect the foam are briefly discussed. Its detection will provide\nus with a glimpse of the ultimate structure of space and time.\n", "  We will briefly review the definition and classification of classical and\nquantum singularities in general relativity. Examples of classically singular\nspacetimes that do not have quantum singularities will be given. We will\npresent results on quantum singularities in quasiregular spacetimes. We will\nalso show that a strong repulsive \"potential\" near the classical singularity\ncan turn a classically singular spacetime into a quantum mechanically\nnonsingular spacetime.\n", "  Quantum gravitational effects may induce stochastic fluctuations in the\nstructure of space-time, to produce a characteristic foamy structure. It has\nbeen known for some time now that these fluctuations may have observable\nconsequences for the propagation of cosmic ray particles over cosmological\ndistances. While invoked as a possible explanation for the detection of the\npuzzling cosmic rays with energies in excess of the threshold for photopion\nproduction (the so-called super-GZK particles), we demonstrate here that lower\nenergy observations may provide strong constraints on the role of a fluctuating\nspace-time structure. We note also that the same fluctuations, if they exist,\nimply that some decay reactions normally forbidden by elementary conservation\nlaws, become kinematically allowed, inducing the decay of particles that are\nseen to be stable in our universe. Due to the strength of the prediction, we\nare led to consider this finding as the most severe constraint on the classes\nof models that may describe the effects of gravity on the structure of\nspace-time. We also propose and discuss several potential loopholes of our\napproach, that may affect our conclusions. In particular, we try to identify\nthe situations in which despite a fluctuating energy-momentum of the particles,\nthe reactions mentioned above may not take place.\n", "  We give an introductory account to the renormalization of models without\nmetric background. We sketch the application to certain discrete models of\nquantum gravity such as spin foam models.\n", "  The possibility of performing post-Newtonian gravitoelectromagnetic\nmeasurements with a joint LAGEOS-LAGEOS II-OPTIS space-based mission is\ninvestigated\n", "  We study the scalar and spinor perturbation to Kerr-NUT space-time, that is,\nKlein-Gordan and Dirac equation therein. The equations are invariant under\nduality transformation between the gravitational electric (M) and magnetic (l)\ncharge, radial and angular coordinate, and radial and angular component of the\nfield. We solve the equations separating into radial and angular parts.\nMoreover, if sets of Klein-Gordan and Dirac equation and corresponding\nsolutions are known for Kerr space-time, under duality transformation, those in\ndual Kerr space-time are shown to be achieved. A few examples of solution are\nshown. We comment about the horizon and singularity conditions.\n", "  Propagation of fermions in curved space-time generates a gravitational\ninteraction due to the coupling between spin of the fermion and space-time\ncurvature. This gravitational interaction, which is an axial-vector appears as\nthe CPT violating term in the Lagrangian, can generate the neutrino asymmetry\nin Universe. If the back-ground metric is spherically asymmetric, say, of\nrotating black hole, the axisymmetric space-time of an expanding Universe, this\ninteraction as well as the neutrino asymmetry is non-zero.\n", "  The asymmetry in the time delay for light rays propagating on opposite sides\nof a spinning body is analyzed. A frequency shift in the perceived signals is\nfound. A practical procedure is proposed for evidencing the asymmetry, allowing\nfor a measurement of the specific angular momentum of the rotating mass. Orders\nof magnitude are discussed.\n", "  We present a new numerical scheme for solving the initial value problem for\nquasiequilibrium binary neutron stars allowing for arbitrary spins. We\nconstruct sequences of circular-orbit binaries of varying separation, keeping\nthe rest mass and circulation constant along each sequence. The spin angular\nfrequency of the stars is shown to vary along the sequence, a result that can\nbe derived analytically in the PPN limit. This spin effect, in addition to\nleaving an imprint on the gravitational waveform emitted during binary\ninspiral, is measurable in the electromagnetic signal if one of the stars is a\npulsar visible from Earth.\n", "  Stable gravitating lumps with a false vacuum core surrounded by the true\nvacuum in a scalar field potential exist in the presence of fermions at the\ncore. These objects may exist in the universe at various scales.\n", "  We provide a discussion about the necessity to fix the reference frame before\nquantizing the gravitational field. Our presentation is based on stressing how\nthe 3+1-slicing of the space time becomes an ambiguous procedure as referred to\na quantum 4-metric.\n", "  Are the classical singularities of general relativistic spacetimes, normally\ndefined by the incompleteness of classical particle paths, still singular if\nquantum mechanical particles are used instead? This is the question we will\nattempt to answer for particles obeying the quantum mechanical wave equations\nfor scalar, null vector and spinor particles. The analysis will be restricted\nto certain static general relativistic spacetimes that classically contain the\nmildest true classical singularities, quasiregular singularities.\n", "  Implications of noncommutative field theories with commutator of the\ncoordinates of the form $[x^{\\mu},x^{\\nu}]=i \\Lambda_{\\quad \\omega}^{\\mu\n\\nu}x^{\\omega}$with nilpotent structure constants are investigated. It is shown\nthat a free quantum field theory is not affected by noncommutativity, but that\ninvariance under translations is broken and hence the energy-momentum\nconservation is not respected. The new energy-momentum law is expressed by a\nPoincar\\'e-invariant equation and the resulting kinematics is developed and\napplied to the astrophysical puzzle related with the observed violation of the\nGZK cutoff.\n", "  This talk reviews the constraints imposed by binary-pulsar data on gravity\ntheories, focusing on ``tensor-scalar'' ones which are the best motivated\nalternatives to general relativity. We recall that binary-pulsar tests are\nqualitatively different from solar-system experiments, because of\nnonperturbative strong-field effects which can occur in compact objects like\nneutron stars, and because one can observe the effect of gravitational\nradiation damping. Some theories which are strictly indistinguishable from\ngeneral relativity in the solar system are ruled out by binary-pulsar\nobservations. During the last months, several impressive new experimental data\nhave been published. Today, the most constraining binary pulsar is no longer\nthe celebrated (Hulse-Taylor) PSR B1913+16, but the neutron star-white dwarf\nsystem PSR J1141-6545. In particular, in a region of the ``theory space'',\nsolar-system tests were known to give the tightest constraints; PSR J1141-6545\nis now almost as powerful. We also comment on the possible scalar-field effects\nfor the detection of gravitational waves with future interferometers. The\npresence of a scalar partner to the graviton might be detectable with the LISA\nspace experiment, but we already know that it would have a negligible effect\nfor LIGO and VIRGO, so that the general relativistic wave templates can be used\nsecurely for these ground interferometers.\n", "  I give a brief overview of some Quantum-Gravity-Phenomenology research lines,\nfocusing on studies of cosmic rays and gamma-ray bursts that concern the fate\nof Lorentz symmetry in quantum spacetime. I also stress that the most valuable\nphenomenological analyses should not mix too many conjectured new features of\nquantum spacetime, and from this perspective it appears that it should be\ndifficult to obtain reliable guidance on the quantum-gravity problem from the\nanalysis of synchrotron radiation from the Crab nebula and from the analysis of\nphase coherence of light from extragalactic sources. Forthcoming observatories\nof ultra-high-energy neutrinos should provide several opportunities for clean\ntests of some simple hypothesis for the short-distance structure of spacetime.\nIn particular, these neutrino studies, and some related cosmic-ray studies,\nshould provide access to the regime $E>\\sqrt{m E_p}$.\n", "  I argue that GR Cauchy and Initial Value Problem mathematics is a valuable\nsource of ideas for braneworlds based on higher-dimensional Einstein field\nequations.\n", "  The dynamics of the Mixmaster Universe is analized in a covariant picture via\nMisner--Chitre-like variables for an ADM Hamiltonian approach. The system\noutcomes as isomorphic to a billiard on the Lobachevsky plane and Lyapunov\nexponents are calculated explicitly.\n", "  In the framework of a flat FLRW model we derive an inflationary regime in\nwhich the scalar field, laying on the plateau of its potential, admits a linear\ntime dependence and remains close to a constant value. The behaviour of\ninhomogeneous perturbations is determined on the background metric in agreement\nto the \"slow-rolling\" approximation. We show that the inhomogeneous scales\nwhich before inflation were not much greater then the physical horizon,\nconserve their spectrum (almost) unaltered after the de Sitter phase.\n", "  The chaoticity of the Mixmaster is discussed in the framework of Statistical\nMechanics by using Misner--Chitre-like variables and an ADM reduction of its\ndynamics. We show that such a system is well described by a microcanonical\nensemble whose invariant measure is induced by the corresponding Liouville one\nand is uniform. The covariance with respect to the choice of the temporal gauge\nof the obtained invariant measure is outlined.\n", "  We discuss the possibility to obtain, from a five-dimensional free spinor\nLagrangian, the Quantum Electro-Dynamics (QED) coupling via a Kaluza-Klein\nreduction of the theory. This result is achieved taking a phase dependence of\nthe spinor field on the extra-coordinate and modifying the corresponding\nconnection. The five-dimensional spinor theory is covariant under the\nadmissible coordinates transformations and its four-dimensional reduction\nprovides the QED coupling term.\n", "  Recent attempts to resolve the ambiguity in the loop quantum gravity\ndescription of the quantization of area has led to the idea that j=1 edges of\nspin-networks dominate in their contribution to black hole areas as opposed to\nj=1/2 which would naively be expected. This suggests that the true gauge group\ninvolved might be SO(3) rather than SU(2). We argue that the idea that a\nversion of the Pauli principle is present in loop quantum gravity allows one to\nmaintain SU(2) as the gauge group while still naturally achieving the desired\nsuppression of spin-1/2 punctures. Such an idea can be motivated by arguments\nfrom geometric quantization even though the SU(2) under consideration does not\nhave the geometrical interpretation of rotations in 3-dimensional space, and\nits representation labels do not correspond to physical angular momenta. In\nthis picture, it is natural that macroscopic areas come almost entirely from\nj=1 punctures rather than j=1/2 punctures, and this is for much the same reason\nthat photons lead to macroscopic classically observable fields while electrons\ndo not.\n", "  The idea of a role for DSR (doubly-special relativity) in quantum gravity\nfinds some encouragement in a few scenarios, but in order to explore some key\nconceptual issues it is necessary to find a well-understood toy-quantum-gravity\nmodel that is fully compatible with the DSR principles. Perhaps the most\nsignificant source of encouragement comes from the recent proposal of a path\nfor the emergence of DSR in Loop Quantum Gravity, which however relies on a few\nassumptions on the results of some computations that we are still unable to\nperform. Indications in favor of the possibility of using some elements of\n$\\kappa$-Poincar\\'e Hopf algebras (and of the related $\\kappa$-Minkowski\nnoncommutative spacetime) for the construction of a DSR theory have been\ndiscussed extensively, but a few stubborn open issues must still be resolved,\nespecially in the two-particle sector. It has been recently observed that\ncertain structures encountered in a formulation of 2+1-dimensional\nclassical-gravity models would fit naturally in a DSR framework, but some key\nelements of these 2+1-dimensional models, including the description of\nobservers, might be incompatible with the DSR principles.\n", "  A relativistic 3-brane can be given a conformally invariant, gauge-type,\nformulation provided the embedding space is six-dimensional. The implementation\nof conformal invariance requires the use of a modified measure, independent of\nthe metric in the action. A brane-world scenario without the need of a\ncosmological constant in 6D can be constructed. Thus, no ``old'' cosmological\nconstant problem appears at this level.\n", "  We study the cosmology of the Randall-Sundrum brane-world where the\nEinstein-Hilbert action is modified by curvature correction terms: a\nfour-dimensional scalar curvature from induced gravity on the brane, and a\nfive-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet curvature term. The combined effect of these\ncurvature corrections to the action removes the infinite-density big bang\nsingularity, although the curvature can still diverge for some parameter\nvalues. A radiation brane undergoes accelerated expansion near the minimal\nscale factor, for a range of parameters. This acceleration is driven by the\ngeometric effects, without an inflaton field or negative pressures. At late\ntimes, conventional cosmology is recovered.\n", "  An introduction into the fundamental quests addressed in space missions is\ngiven. These quests are the exploration of the relativistic gravitational\nfield, the Universality of Free Fall, the Universality of the Gravitational\nRedshift, Local Lorentz Invariance, the validity of Einstein's field equations,\netc. In each case, the correspoding missions take advantage of the space\nconditions which are essential for the improvement of the accuracy of the\nexperiments as compared to experiments on ground. A list and a short\ndescription of past, current and planned projects is given. Also the key\ntechnologies employed in space missions are addressed.\n", "  Progress and plans are reported for a program of gravitational physics\nexperiments using cryogenic torsion pendula undergoing large amplitude\ntorsional oscillation. The program includes a UC Irvine project to measure the\ngravitational constant G and joint UC Irvine - U. Washington projects to test\nthe gravitational inverse square law at a range of about 10 cm and to test the\nweak equivalence principle.\n", "  We review the essential features of the Chaplygin gas cosmological models and\nprovide some examples of appearance of the Chaplygin gas equation of state in\nmodern physics. A possible theoretical basis for the Chaplygin gas in cosmology\nis discussed. The relation with scalar field and tachyon cosmological models is\nalso considered.\n", "  The Casimir effect in compact hyperbolic Universes was numerically obtained\nin previous publications. In this talk, I expose these results.\n", "  Asymptotically flat gravitating systems have 10 conserved quantities, which\nlack proper local densities. It has been hoped that the teleparallel equivalent\nof Einstein's GR (TEGR, aka GR${}_{||}$) could solve this gravitational\nenergy-momentum localization problem. Meanwhile a new idea: quasilocal\nquantities, has come into favor. The earlier quasilocal investigations focused\non energy-momentum. Recently we considered quasilocal angular momentum for the\nteleparallel theory and found that the popular expression (unlike our\n``covariant-symplectic'' one) gives the correct result only in a certain frame.\nWe now report that the center-of-mass moment, which has largely been neglected,\ngives an even stronger requirement. We found (independent of the frame gauge)\nthat our ``covariant symplectic'' Hamiltonian-boundary-term quasilocal\nexpression succeeds for all the quasilocal quantities, while the usual\nexpression cannot give the desired center-of-mass moment. We also conclude,\ncontrary to hopes, that the teleparallel formulation appears to have no\nadvantage over GR with regard to localization.\n", "  It is shown that space-time may possess the differentiability properties of\nmanifolds as well as the ultraviolet finiteness properties of lattices. Namely,\nif a field's amplitudes are given on any sufficiently dense set of discrete\npoints this could already determine the field's amplitudes at all other points\nof the manifold. The criterion for when samples are sufficiently densely spaced\ncould be that they are apart on average not more than at a Planck distance. The\nunderlying mathematics is that of classes of functions that can be\nreconstructed completely from discrete samples. The discipline is called\nsampling theory and is at the heart of information theory. Sampling theory\nestablishes the link between continuous and discrete forms of information and\nis used in ubiquitous applications from scientific data taking to digital\naudio.\n", "  The initial value problem is introduced after a thorough review of the\nessential geometry. The initial value equations are put into elliptic form\nusing both conformal transformations and a treatment of the extrinsic curvature\nintroduced recently. This use of the metric and the extrinsic curvature is\nmanifestly equivalent to the author's conformal thin sandwich formulation.\nTherefore, the reformulation of the constraints as an elliptic system by use of\nconformal techniques is complete.\n", "  We study generalisations of the Einstein--Straus model in cylindrically\nsymmetric settings by considering the matching of a static space-time to a\nnon-static spatially homogeneous space-time, preserving the symmetry. We find\nthat such models possess severe restrictions, such as constancy of one of the\nmetric coefficients in the non-static part. A consequence of this is that it is\nimpossible to embed static locally cylindrically symmetric objects in\nreasonable spatially homogeneous cosmologies.\n", "  We consider Maxwell fields associated with any shear-free null geodesic\ncongruence on Minkowski or Riemannian background space-time. Bounded singular\nloci of these fields are treated as particle-like formations, possess\n\"self-quantized\" electric charge and undergo self-consistent time dynamics.\nComplicated singular solutions of Maxwell (as well as related complex\nYang-Mills) equations can be obtained in a purely algebraic way using the Kerr\ntheorem.\n", "  We describe an approach to the quantization of (2+1)--dimensional gravity\nwith topology R x T^2 and negative cosmological constant, which uses two\nquantum holonomy matrices satisfying a q--commutation relation. Solutions of\ndiagonal and upper--triangular form are constructed, which in the latter case\nexhibit additional, non--trivial internal relations for each holonomy matrix.\nThis leads to the notion of quantum matrix pairs. These are pairs of matrices\nwith non-commuting entries, which have the same pattern of internal relations,\nq-commute with each other under matrix multiplication, and are such that\nproducts of powers of the matrices obey the same pattern of internal relations\nas the original pair. This has implications for the classical moduli space,\ndescribed by ordered pairs of commuting SL(2,R) matrices modulo simultaneous\nconjugation by SL(2,R) matrices.\n", "  This essay reviews some of the recent progress in the area of energy\nconditions and wormholes. Most of the discussion centers on the subject of\n``quantum inequality'' restrictions on negative energy. These are bounds on the\nmagnitude and duration of negative energy which put rather severe constraints\non its possible macroscopic effects. Such effects might include the\nconstruction of wormholes and warp drives for faster-than-light travel, and\nviolations of the second law of thermodynamics. Open problems and future\ndirections are also discussed.\n", "  In Einstein's general relativity, geometry replaces the concept of force in\nthe description of the gravitation interaction. Such an approach rests on the\nuniversality of free-fall--the weak equivalence principle--and would break down\nwithout it. On the other hand, the teleparallel version of general relativity,\na gauge theory for the translation group, describes the gravitational\ninteraction by a force similar to the Lorentz force of electromagnetism, a\nnon-universal interaction. It is shown that, similarly to the Maxwell's\ndescription of electromagnetism, the teleparallel gauge approach provides a\nconsistent theory for gravitation even in the absence of the weak equivalence\nprinciple.\n", "  The quantized Friedmann-Lema\\^{\\i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) model minimally\ncoupled to a free massless scalar field is studied and interpreted in the\nBohm-de Broglie framework. We analyze the quantum bohmian trajectories\ncorresponding to a certain class of gaussian packets, solutions of the\nWheeler-DeWitt equation. We show that these bohmian trajectories undergo an\naccelerated expansion in the middle of its evolution due to the presence of\nquantum cosmological effects in this period. It is shown that the\nluminosity-redshift relation in the quantum cosmological model can be made\nclose to the corresponding relation coming from the classical model suplemented\nby a cosmological constant, for $z<1$. In this way we have the posibility of\ninterpreting the present observations of high redshift supernovae as the\nconsequence of a quantum cosmological effect.\n", "  We discuss a new torsion pendulum design for ground testing of prototype LISA\n(Laser Interferometer Space Antenna) displacement sensors. This new design is\ndirectly sensitive to net forces and therefore provides a more representative\ntest of the noisy forces and parasitic stiffnesses acting on the test mass as\ncompared to previous ground-based experiments. We also discuss a specific\napplication to the measurement of thermal gradient effects.\n", "  The software tool GRworkbench is an ongoing project in visual, numerical\nGeneral Relativity at The Australian National University. Recently, GRworkbench\nhas been significantly extended to facilitate numerical experimentation in\nanalytically-defined space-times. The numerical differential geometric engine\nhas been rewritten using functional programming techniques, enabling objects\nwhich are normally defined as functions in the formalism of differential\ngeometry and General Relativity to be directly represented as function\nvariables in the C++ code of GRworkbench. The new functional differential\ngeometric engine allows for more accurate and efficient visualisation of\nobjects in space-times and makes new, efficient computational techniques\navailable. Motivated by the desire to investigate a recent scientific claim\nusing GRworkbench, new tools for numerical experimentation have been\nimplemented, allowing for the simulation of complex physical situations.\n", "  Recently, it has been shown that Absolute Parallelism (AP) geometry admits\npaths that are naturally quantized. These paths have been used to describe the\nmotion of spinning particles in a background gravitational field. In case of a\nweak static gravitational field limits, the paths are applied successfully to\ninterpret the discrepancy in the motion of thermal neutrons in the Earth's\ngravitational field (COW-experiment). The aim of the present work is to explore\nthe properties of the deviation equations corresponding to these paths. In the\npresent work the deviation equations are derived and compared to the geodesic\ndeviation equation of the Riemannian geometry.\n", "  We give a progress report of our research on spacetime fluctuations induced\nby quantum fields in an evaporating black hole and a black hole in\nquasi-equilibrium with its Hawking radiation. We note the main issues involved\nin these two classes of problems and outline the key steps for a systematic\nquantitative investigation. This report contains unpublished new ideas for\nfurther studies.\n", "  Although consensus seems to exist about the validity of equations accounting\nfor radiation reaction in curved space-time, their previous derivations were\ncriticized recently as not fully satisfactory: some ambiguities were noticed in\nthe procedure of integration of the field momentum over the tube surrounding\nthe world-line. To avoid these problems we suggest a purely local derivation\ndealing with the field quantities defined only {\\em on the world-line}. We\nconsider point particle interacting with scalar, vector (electromagnetic) and\nlinearized gravitational fields in the (generally non-vacuum) curved\nspace-time. To properly renormalize the self-action in the gravitational case,\nwe use a manifestly reparameterization-invariant formulation of the theory.\nScalar and vector divergences are shown to cancel for a certain ratio of the\ncorresponding charges. We also report on a modest progress in extending the\nresults for the gravitational radiation reaction to the case of non-vacuum\nbackground.\n", "  Measurements of HERA that explore the parton dynamics at low Bjorken x are\npresented together with precise determinations of the strong coupling constant\nalpha_s. Calculations at next to leading order using the DGLAP evolution fail\nto describe the data at low x and forward jet pseudorapidities. The alpha_s\nmeasurements at HERA are in agreement with the world average and have very\ncompetitive errors.\n", "  Searches for SUSY particles have been performed in 3.6 fb$^{-1}$ e$^+$e$^-$\ndata collected by the LEP detectors at $\\sqrt{s}$ between 90 GeV and 209 GeV.\nThis talk reviews some of the relevant searches for SUSY particles at LEP. No\nexcess of events is observed in any channel. Results are interpreted in the\ncontext of the MSSM.\n", "  Results on physics of heavy flavour at CDF are reported. Selected\nmeasurements of Branching Ratios and CP asymmetry in $B^0$ and $B_s^0$,\nlifetime difference of $B^0_s$ CP eigenstates and a precise measurement of the\n$B_c$ mass are presented.\n", "  We present some recent measurements on electroweak physics using data\ncollected by the CDF experiment at the Tevatron proton anti-proton collider\n($\\sqrt{s}=1.96\\mathrm{TeV}$) at Fermilab (Batavia, Ill, USA).\n", "  Neutrinos in the Standard Model of particle physics are massless, neutral\nfermions that seemingly do little more than conserve 4-momentum, angular\nmomentum, lepton number, and lepton flavour in weak interactions. In the last\ndecade conclusive evidence has demonstrated that the Standard Model's\ndescription of neutrinos does not match reality. We now know that neutrinos\nundergo flavour oscillations, violating lepton flavour conservation and\nimplying that neutrinos have non-zero mass. A rich oscillation phenomenology\nthen becomes possible, including matter-enhanced oscillation and possibly CP\nviolation in the neutrino sector. Extending the Standard Model to include\nneutrino masses requires the addition of new fields and mass terms, and\npossibly new methods of mass generation. In this review article I will discuss\nthe evidence that has established the existence of neutrino oscillation, and\nthen highlight unresolved issues in neutrino physics, such as the nature of\nthree-generational mixing (including CP-violating effects), the origins of\nneutrino mass, the possible existence of light sterile neutrinos, and the\ndifficult question of measuring the absolute mass scale of neutrinos.\n", "  After a short review of the ultrahigh energy cosmic ray puzzle - the apparent\nobservation of cosmic rays originating from cosmological distances with\nenergies above the expected Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin cutoff 4x10^{19} eV - we\nconsider strongly interacting neutrino scenarios as an especially interesting\nsolution. We show that all features of the ultrahigh energy cosmic ray spectrum\nfrom 10^{17} eV to 10^{21} eV can be described to originate from a simple\npower-like injection spectrum of protons, under the assumption that the\nneutrino-nucleon cross-section is significantly enhanced at center of mass\nenergies above ~ 100 TeV. In such a scenario, the cosmogenic neutrinos produced\nduring the propagation of protons through the cosmic microwave background\ninitiate air showers in the atmosphere, just as the protons. The total air\nshower spectrum induced by protons and neutrinos shows excellent agreement with\nthe observations. We shortly discuss TeV-scale extensions of the Standard Model\nwhich may lead to a realization of a strongly interacting neutrino scenario. We\nemphasize, however, that such a scenario may even be realized within the\nstandard electroweak model: electroweak instanton/sphaleron induced processes\nmay get strong at ultrahigh energies. Possible tests of strongly interacting\nneutrino scenarios range from observations at cosmic ray facilities and\nneutrino telescopes to searches at lepton nucleon scattering experiments.\n", "  In the brane-world scenario with low tension, brane fluctuations (branons)\ntogether with the Standard Model particles are the only relevant degrees of\nfreedom at low energies. Branons are stable, weakly interacting, massive\nparticles and their relic abundance can account for the dark matter of the\nuniverse. In a certain range of the parameter space, they could be detectable\nby future direct search experiments.\n", "  Starting from an heuristic approach to the semiclassical limit in loop\nquantum gravity, the construction of effective Hamiltonians describing Planck\nlength corrections to the propagation of photons and spin 1/2 fermions, leading\nto modified energy-momentum relations, is summarized. Assuming the existence of\na privileged reference frame, we also review the determination of stringent\nbounds upon the parameters labelling such corrections, based upon already\nexisting experimental data, which are found to be from five to nine orders of\nmagnitude below the expected values.\n", "  This rapporteur review covers selected results presented in the Parallel\nSession HEA2 (High Energy Astrophysics 2) of the 10th Marcel Grossmann Meeting\non General Relativity, held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, July 2003. The subtopics\nare: ultra high energy cosmic ray anisotropies, the possible connection of\nthese energetic particles with powerful gamma ray bursts, and new exciting\nscenarios with a strong neutrino-nucleon interaction in the atmosphere.\n", "  Flavour physics offers interesting probes for the exploration of the Standard\nModel and the search for new physics. In these lectures, we focus on B- and\nK-meson decays, introduce the concept of low-energy effective Hamiltonians to\ndescribe them theoretically, and discuss how physics beyond the Standard Model\nmay generically affect the roadmap of quark-flavour physics. We address then\nboth the implications of the B-factory data for the B_d -> J/psi K_S channel\nand the prospects of B_s -> J/psi phi modes for hadron colliders, and discuss\nhow the Standard Model may be challenged through B_d -> phi K_S. Finally, as an\nexample of a systematic flavour strategy to search for new physics, we analyze\npuzzling patterns in the B -> pi pi, pi K data and study their interplay with\nrare K and B decays.\n", "  Silicon double paddle oscillators are well suited for the detection of weak\nforces because of their high Q factor (about 10^5 at room temperature). We\ndescribe an experiment aimed at the detection of gravitational forces between\nmasses at sub-mm distance using such an oscillator. Gravitational excitation is\nproduced by a rotating aluminium disk with platinum segments. The force\nsensitivity of this apparatus is about 10 fN at room temperature for 1000 s\naveraging time at room temperature. The current limitations to detection of the\ngravitational force are mentioned.\n", "  We review recent progress of understanding and resolving instabilities driven\nby mismatch between the Fermi surfaces of the pairing quarks in 2-flavor color\nsuperconductor. With the increase of mismatch, the 2SC phase exhibits\nchromomagnetic instability as well as color neutral baryon current instability.\nWe describe the 2SC phase in the nonlinear realization framework, and show that\neach instability indicates the spontaneous generation of the corresponding\npseudo Nambu-Golstone current. The Nambu-Goldstone currents generation state\ncovers the gluon phase as well as the one-plane wave LOFF state. We further\npoint out that, when charge neutrality condition is required, there exists a\nnarrow unstable LOFF (Us-LOFF) window, where not only off-diagonal gluons but\nthe diagonal 8-th gluon cannot avoid the magnetic instability. In this Us-LOFF\nwindow, the diagonal magnetic instability cannot be cured by off-diagonal gluon\ncondensate in the color superconducting phase.\n", "  At ultra-high density, matter is expected to form a degenerate Fermi gas of\nquarks in which there is a condensate of Cooper pairs of quarks near the Fermi\nsurface: color superconductivity. In this chapter we review some of the\nunderlying physics, and discuss outstanding questions about the phase structure\nof ultra-dense quark matter. We then focus on describing recent results on the\ncrystalline color superconducting phase that may be the preferred form of cold,\ndense but not asymptotically dense, three-flavor quark matter. The gap\nparameter and free energy for this phase have recently been evaluated within a\nGinzburg-Landau approximation for many candidate crystal structures. We\ndescribe the two that are most favorable. The robustness of these phases\nresults in their being favored over wide ranges of density. However, it also\nimplies that the Ginzburg-Landau approximation is not quantitatively reliable.\nWe describe qualitative insights into what makes a crystal structure favorable\nwhich can be used to winnow the possibilities. We close with a look ahead at\nthe calculations that remain to be done in order to make quantitative contact\nwith observations of compact stars.\n", "  A brief review is given of dark matter in SUGRA, strings and branes. For\nSUGRA models the implications of Yukawa coupling unification on dark matter are\ndiscussed in the light of $g-2$ and $b\\to s\\gamma$ constraints. A brief\ndiscussion is given of the dark matter in orbifold string compactifications\nunder constraints of modular invariance and radiative breaking of the\nelectroweak symmetry. Finally a new candidate for dark matter - an extra-weakly\ninteracting massive particle or an XWIMP- is discussed. Such dark matter can\narise in a wide class of models, including the Stueckelberg extensions of MSSM,\nin U(1) extensions of MSSM with off diagonal kinetic energy, and possibly in a\nwider class of models which may have a string/D-brane origin. Satisfaction of\nthe relic density of XWIMPs consistent with WMAP is also discussed.\n", "  The relic density of a cold dark matter (CDM) candidate is calculated in the\ncontext of three non-standard cosmological scenaria and its value is compared\nwith the one obtained in the standard regime. In particular, we consider the\ndecoupling of the CDM particle during: (i) A decaying-particle dominated phase\nor (ii) a kinetic-energy dominated phase or (iii) the decay of a massive\nparticle under the complete or partial domination of kination. We use plausible\nvalues (from the viewpoint of supersymmetric models) for the mass and the\nthermal averaged cross section times the velocity of the cold relic and we\ninvestigate scenaria of equilibrium and non-equilibrium production. In the case\n(i) a low reheat temperature, in the range (1-20) GeV, significantly\nfacilitates the achievement of an acceptable CDM abundance. On the other hand,\nthe presence of kination in the case (ii) can lead to an enhancement of the CDM\nabundance up to three orders of magnitude. The latter enhancement can be\navoided, in the case (iii). In a such situation, the temperature turns out to\nbe frozen to a plateau value which is, mostly, lower than about 40 GeV.\n", "  In this letter in the framework of a simple see-saw scenario with two (or\nthree) quasi degenerate Majorana neutrinos we propose that one of these\nneutrinos can be very weakly coupled, yet there is a mechanism of the\ngeneration of the abundance of such \"dark\" neutrino in the early universe. The\nmechanism of production is due to oscillations between \"dark\" Majorana neutrino\nand one of the Majorana's which has relatively large Yukawa couplings (\"bright\"\nMajorana neutrino). The transition of \"bright\" Majorana into a \"dark\" one is\nnonadiabatic. We point out on the similarity with the Landau-Zener transition\nregime. In our model one can explain the observed dark matter density, present\nmatter-antimatter asymmetry and active neutrino data all at the same time\n", "  The ArDM project aims at operating a large noble liquid detector to search\nfor direct evidence of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMP) as Dark\nMatter in the universe. Background sources relevant to ton-scale liquid and\ngaseous argon detectors, such as neutrons from detector components,\nmuon-induced neutrons and neutrons caused by radioactivity of rock, as well as\nthe internal $^{39}Ar$ background, are studied with simulations. These\nbackground radiations are addressed with the design of an appropriate shielding\nas well as with different background rejection potentialities. Among them the\nproject relies on event topology recognition, event localization, density\nionization discrimination and pulse shape discrimination. Background rates,\nenergy spectra, characteristics of the background-induced nuclear recoils in\nliquid argon, as well as the shielding performance and rejection performance of\nthe detector are described.\n", "  Precision experiments exploiting low-energy photons may yield information on\nparticle physics complementary to experiments at high-energy colliders, in\nparticular on new very light and very weakly interacting particles, predicted\nin many extensions of the standard model. Such particles may be produced by\nlaser photons send along a transverse magnetic field. The laser polarization\nexperiment PVLAS may have seen the first indirect signal of such particles by\nobserving an anomalously large rotation of the polarization plane of photons\nafter the passage through a magnetic field. This can be interpreted as evidence\nfor photon disappearance due to particle production. There are a number of\nexperimental proposals to test independently the particle interpretation of\nPVLAS. Many of them are based on the search for photon reappearance or\nregeneration, i.e. for ``light shining through a wall''. At DESY, the\nAxion-Like Particle Search (ALPS) collaboration is currently setting up such an\nexperiment.\n", "  The current status of axion physics is presented. There still exists the\naxion window 10^9 GeV < F_a < 10^{12} GeV. The recent CAST solar axion search\nexperiment on the axion-photon-photon coupling strength has to be improved by a\nfactor of 100 to reach down to the region of superstring axions. The calculable\ntheta and m_u=0 cases for strong CP solutions, and axino cosmology in SUSY\nextension of axion are also commented.\n", "  We examine the question of whether neutralinos produced at the LHC can be\nshown to be the particles making up the astronomically observed dark matter. If\nthe WIMP alllowed region lies in the SUGRA coannihilation region, then a strong\nsignal for this would be the unexpected near degeneracy of the stau and\nneutralino i.e., a mass difference \\Delta M\\simeq (5-15) GeV. For the mSUGRA\nmodel we show such a small mass difference can be measured at the LHC using the\nsignal 3\\tau+jet+E_T^{\\rm miss}. Two observables, opposite sign minus like sign\npairs and the peak of the \\tau\\tau mass distribution allows the simultaneous\ndetermination of \\Delta M to 15% and the gluino mass M_{\\tilde g} to be 6% at\nthe benchmark point of M_{\\tilde g}=850 GeV, A_0=0, \\mu>0 with 30 fb^{-1}. With\n10 fb^{-1}, \\Delta M can be determined to 22% and one can probe the parameter\nspace up to m_{1/2}=700 GeV with 100 fb^{-1}.\n", "  Quintessential inflation is studied using a string modulus as the inflaton -\nquintessence field. It is assumed that the modulus crosses an enhanced symmetry\npoint (ESP) in field space. Particle production at the ESP temporarily traps\nthe modulus resulting in a period of inflation. After reheating, the modulus\nfreezes due to cosmological friction at a large value, such that its scalar\npotential is dominated by contributions due to fluxes in the extra dimensions.\nThe modulus remains frozen until the present, when it can become quintessence.\n", "  Quantum vacuum energy has been known to have observable consequences since\n1948 when Casimir calculated the force of attraction between parallel uncharged\nplates, a phenomenon confirmed experimentally with ever increasing precision.\nCasimir himself suggested that a similar attractive self-stress existed for a\nconducting spherical shell, but Boyer obtained a repulsive stress. Other\ngeometries and higher dimensions have been considered over the years. Local\neffects, and divergences associated with surfaces and edges have been\ninvestigated by several authors. Quite recently, Graham et al. have re-examined\nsuch calculations, using conventional techniques of perturbative quantum field\ntheory to remove divergences, and have suggested that previous self-stress\nresults may be suspect. Here we show that most of the examples considered in\ntheir work are misleading; in particular, it is well-known that in two\ndimensions a circular boundary has a divergence in the Casimir energy for\nmassless fields, while for general dimension $D$ not equal to an even integer\nthe corresponding Casimir energy arising from massless fields interior and\nexterior to a hyperspherical shell is finite. It has also long been recognized\nthat the Casimir energy for massive fields is divergent for curved boundaries.\nThese conclusions are reinforced by a calculation of the relevant leading\nFeynman diagram in $D$ dimensions. Divergences do occur in third order, as has\nbeen recognized for many years, but this logarithmic divergence is of\nquestionable relevance to real shells.\n", "  The one-loop effective action for a scalar field defined in the ultrastatic\nspace-time where non standard logarithmic terms in the asymptotic heat-kernel\nexpansion are present, is investigated by a generalisation of zeta-function\nregularisation. It is shown that additional divergences may appear at one-loop\nlevel. The one-loop renormalisability of the model is discussed and the\none-loop renormalisation group equations are derived.\n", "  Kaluza-Klein reduction of the 3-dimensional gravitational Chern-Simons term\nleads to a 2-dimensional theory that supports a symmetry breaking solution and\nan associated kink interpolating between AdS and dS geometries.\n", "  The Poincar\\'e sector of a recently deformed conformal algebra is proposed to\ndescribe, after the identification of the deformation parameter with the Planck\nlength, the symmetries of a new relativistic theory with two\nobserver-independent scales (or DSR theory). Also a new non-commutative\nspace-time is proposed. It is found that momentum space exhibits the same\nfeatures of the DSR proposals preserving Lorentz invariance in a deformed way.\nThe space-time sector is a generalization of the well known non-commutative\n$\\kappa$-Minkowski space-time which however does not preserve Lorentz\ninvariance, not even in the deformed sense. It is shown that this behavior\ncould be expected in some attempts to construct DSR theories starting from the\nPoincar\\'e sector of a deformed symmetry larger than Poincar\\'e symmetry,\nunless one takes a variable Planck length. It is also shown that the formalism\ncan be useful in analyzing the role of quantum deformations in the ``AdS-CFT\ncorrespondence\".\n", "  Using the simplest model for a bouncing universe, namely that for which\ngravity is described by pure general relativity, the spatial sections are\npositively curved and the matter content is a single scalar field, we obtain\nthe transition matrix relating cosmological perturbation modes between the\ncontracting and expanding phases. We show that this case provides a specific\nexample in which this relation explicitely depends on the perturbation scale\nwhenever the null energy condition (NEC) is close to be violated.\n", "  The conservation of energy implies that an isolated radiating black hole\ncannot have an emission spectrum that is precisely thermal. Moreover, the\nno-hair theorem is only approximately applicable. We consider the implications\nfor the black hole information puzzle.\n", "  A field theory is proposed where the regular fermionic matter and the dark\nfermionic matter are different states of the same \"primordial\" fermion fields.\nIn regime of the fermion densities typical for normal particle physics, the\nprimordial fermions split into three families identified with regular fermions.\nWhen fermion energy density becomes comparable with dark energy density, the\ntheory allows new type of states. The possibility of such Cosmo-Low Energy\nPhysics (CLEP) states is demonstrated by means of solutions of the field theory\nequations describing FRW universe filled by homogeneous scalar field and\nuniformly distributed nonrelativistic neutrinos. Neutrinos in CLEP state are\ndrawn into cosmological expansion by means of dynamically changing their own\nparameters. One of the features of the fermions in CLEP state is that in the\nlate time universe their masses increase as a^{3/2} (a=a(t) is the scale\nfactor). The energy density of the cold dark matter consisting of neutrinos in\nCLEP state scales as a sort of dark energy; this cold dark matter possesses\nnegative pressure and for the late time universe its equation of state\napproaches that of the cosmological constant. The total energy density of such\nuniverse is less than it would be in the universe free of fermionic matter at\nall. The (quintessence) scalar field is coupled to dark matter but its coupling\nto regular fermionic matter appears to be extremely strongly suppressed.\n", "  The finite entropy of de Sitter space suggests that in a theory of quantum\ngravity there are only finitely many states. It has been argued that in this\ncase there is no action of the de Sitter group consistent with unitarity. In\nthis note we propose a way out of this if we give up the requirement of having\na hermitian Hamiltonian. We argue that some of the generators of the de Sitter\ngroup act in a novel way, namely by mixing in- and out-states. In this way it\nis possible to have a unitary S-matrix that is finite-dimensional and,\nmoreover, de Sitter-invariant. Using Dirac spinors, we construct a simple toy\nmodel that exhibits these features.\n", "  A family of generalized S-brane solutions with orthogonal intersection rules\nand n Ricci-flat factor spaces in the theory with several scalar fields,\nantisymmetric forms and multiple scalar potential is considered. Two subclasses\nof solutions with power-law and exponential behaviour of scale factors are\nsingled out. These subclasses contain sub-families of solutions with\naccelerated expansion of certain factor spaces. Some examples of solutions with\nexponential dependence of one scale factor and constant scale factors of\n\"internal\" spaces (e.g. Freund-Rubin type solutions) are also considered.\n", "  The existence of a minimal length scale, a fundamental lower limit on\nspacetime resolution is motivated by various theories of quantum gravity as\nwell as string theory. Classical calculations involving both quantum theory and\ngeneral relativity yield the same result. This minimal length scale is\nnaturally of the order of the Planck length, but can be as high as ~TeV^-1 in\nmodels with large extra dimensions. We discuss the influence of a minimal scale\non the Casimir effect on the basis of an effective model of quantum theory with\nminimal length.\n", "  We propose a reformulation of general relativity by making the Abelian\ndecomposition of Einstein's theory. Based on the view that Einstein's theory\ncan be interpreted as a gauge theory of Lorentz group, we decompose the\nEinstein's gravitational connection (the gauge potential of Lorentz group\n$\\vGm_\\mu$) into the restricted connection made of the potential of the maximal\nAbelian subgroup $H$ of Lorentz group $G$ and the valence connection made of\n$G/H$ part of the potential which transforms covariantly under Lorentz group.\nWith this decomposition we show that the Einstein's theory can be decomposed\ninto the restricted part made of the restricted connection which has the full\nLorentz gauge invariance and the valence part made of the valence connection\nwhich plays the role of gravitational source of the restricted gravity. We show\nthat there are two different Abelian decomposition of Einstein's theory,\nbecause Lorentz group has two maximal Abelian subgroups. In this decomposition\nthe role of the space-time metric $g_\\mn$ is replaced by a four-index metric\ntensor $\\vg_\\mn$ which transforms covariantly under the Lorentz group, and the\nmetric-compatibility condition $\\nabla_\\alpha g_\\mn=0$ of the connection is\nreplaced by the gauge covariant condition $D_\\mu \\vg^\\mn$ which tells that\n$\\vg_\\mn$ is invariant under the parallel transport along the\n$\\pro_\\mu$-direction defined by $\\vGm_\\mu$. We discuss the physical\nimplications of the Abelian decomposition. In particular, we argue that the\ndecomposition implies the existence of a restricted theory of gravitation which\nhas the full general invariance but has less physical degrees of freedom.\n", "  In this expository and resources chapter we review selected aspects of the\nmathematics of dynamical systems, stability, and chaos, within a historical\nframework that draws together two threads of its early development: celestial\nmechanics and control theory, and focussing on qualitative theory. From this\nperspective we show how concepts of stability enable us to classify dynamical\nequations and their solutions and connect the key issues of nonlinearity,\nbifurcation, control, and uncertainty that are common to time-dependent\nproblems in natural and engineered systems. We discuss stability and\nbifurcations in three simple model problems, and conclude with a survey of\nrecent extensions of stability theory to complex networks.\n", "  Mid-rapidity transverse momentum distributions for $\\pi^\\pm$, $K^\\pm$, p and\n$\\pbar$ are measured by the PHENIX experiment at RHIC in Au+Au, d+Au and p+p\ncollisions at \\ssnn=200GeV up to ~2--4GeV. Also particle ratios of\n$\\pi^{-}/\\pi^{+}$, $K^{-}/K^{+}$, $\\pbar/p$, $p/\\pi$ and $\\pbar/\\pi$ are\nmeasured, as well as the nuclear modification factor, all as a function of \\pt\nand in every of the above collision systems. Finally, the measured p+p and\nAu+Au spectra are compared to the Buda-Lund hydro model.\n", "  Particle production as observed with the BRAHMS experiment at RHIC is\npresented. Preliminary baryon/meson ratios and nuclear modification factors at\ndifferent rapidities will be discussed.\n", "  The PHOBOS collaboration has carried out a systematic study of charged\nparticle multiplicities in Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions at the Relativistic\nHeavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory. A unique feature\nof the PHOBOS detector is its ability to measure charged particles over a very\nwide angular range from 0.5 to 179.5 deg. corresponding to |eta|<5.4. The\ngeneral features of the charged particle multiplicity distributions as a\nfunction of pseudo-rapidity, collision energy and centrality, as well as system\nsize, are discussed.\n", "  Nuclei undergo a phase transition in nuclear reactions according to a caloric\ncurve determined by the amount of entropy. Here, the generation of entropy is\nstudied in relation to the size of the nuclear system.\n", "  We discuss the phase diagram of moderately dense, locally neutral\nthree-flavor quark matter using the framework of an effective model of quantum\nchromodynamics with a local interaction. The phase diagrams in the plane of\ntemperature and quark chemical potential as well as in the plane of temperature\nand lepton-number chemical potential are discussed.\n", "  We study the phase diagram of dense quark matter with an emphasis on the role\nof the strange quark mass. Our approach is based on two effective field\ntheories (EFTs). The first is an EFT that describes quark quasi-particles near\nthe Fermi surface. This EFT is valid at energies small compared to the chemical\npotential. The second is an EFT for the Goldstone modes in the paired phase. We\nfind that in response to a non-zero strange quark mass the CFL phase first\nundergoes a transition to a kaon condensed phase, and then to a gapless phase\nwith a non-zero Goldstone boson current.\n", "  We review here the classical argument used to justify the electrical\nneutrality of stars and show that if the pressure and density of the matter and\ngravitational field inside the star are large, then a charge and a strong\nelectric field can be present. For a neutron star with high pressure (~ 10^{33}\nto 10^{35} dynes /cm^2) and strong gravitational field (~ 10^{14} cm/s^2),\nthese conditions are satisfied. The hydrostatic equation which arises from\ngeneral relativity, is modified considerably to meet the requirements of the\ninclusion of the charge. In order to see any appreciable effect on the\nphenomenology of the neutron stars, the charge and the electrical fields have\nto be huge (~ 10^{21} Volts/cm). These stars are not however stable from the\nviewpoint that each charged particle is unbound to the uncharged particles, and\nthus the system collapses one step further to a charged black hole\n", "  This chapter provides a review of microscopic theories of pairing in nuclear\nsystems and neutron stars. Special attention is given to the mean-field BCS\ntheory and its extensions to include effects of polarization of the medium and\nretardation of the interactions. Superfluidity in nuclear systems that exhibit\nisospin asymmetry is studied. We further address the crossover from the\nweak-coupling BCS description to the strong-coupling BEC limit in dilute\nnuclear systems. Finally, within the observational context of rotational\nanomalies of pulsars, we discuss models of the vortex state in superfluid\nneutron stars and of the mutual friction between superfluid and normal\ncomponents, along with the possibility of type-I superconductivity of the\nproton subsystem.\n", "  In order to get ready for physics at the LHC, the CMS experiment has to be\nset up for data taking. The data have to be well understood before new physics\ncan be investigated. On the other hand, there are standard processes, well\nknown from previous experiments and from simulation, which will help to\nunderstand the data of the detector in the early days of the LHC.\n", "  This paper gives a pedagogic review of the envelope formalism for excitation\nof zonal flows by nonlinear interactions of plasma drift waves or Rossby waves,\ndescribed equivalently by the Hasegawa-Mima (HM) equation or the\nquasigeostrophic barotropic potential vorticity equation, respectively. In the\nplasma case a modified form of the HM equation, which takes into account\nsuppression of the magnetic-surface-averaged electron density response by a\nsmall amount of rotational transform, is also analyzed. Excitation of zonal\nmean flow by a modulated wave train is particularly strong in the modified HM\ncase. A local dispersion relation for a coherent wave train is calculated by\nlinearizing about a background mean flow and used to find the nonlinear\nfrequency shift by inserting the nonlinearly excited mean flow. Using the\ngeneric nonlinear Schroedinger equation about a uniform carrier wave, the\ncriterion for instability of small modulations of the wave train is found, as\nis the maximum growth rate and phase velocity of the modulations and zonal\nflows, in both the modified and unmodified cases.\n", "  We present preliminary results of measurements of the quenching factor for Na\nrecoils in NaI(Tl) at room temperature, made at a dedicated neutron facility at\nthe University of Sheffield. Measurements have been performed with a 2.45 MeV\nmono-energetic neutron generator in the energy range from 10 keV to 100 keV\nnuclear recoil energy. A BC501A liquid scintillator detector was used to tag\nneutrons. Cuts on pulse-shape discrimination from the BC501A liquid\nscintillator detector and neutron time-of-flight were performed on pulses\nrecorded by a digitizer with a 2 ns sampling time. Measured quenching factors\nrange from 19% to 26%, in agreement with other experiments. From pulse-shape\nanalysis, a mean time of pulses from electron and nuclear recoils are compared\ndown to 2 keV electron equivalent energy.\n", "  NEWAGE(NEw generation WIMP search with an Advanced Gaseous tracking device\nExperiment) project is a direction-sensitive dark matter search experiment with\na gaseous micro time-projection-chamber(micro-TPC). We report on the\nperformance of the micro-TPC with a detection volume of 23x28x30 cm3 operated\nwith a carbon-tetra uoride (CF4) of 0.2 bar.\n", "  In a two-dimensional version of the modified Hasegawa-Wakatani (HW) model,\nwhich describes electrostatic resistive drift wave turbulence, the resistive\ncoupling between vorticity and density does not act on the zonal components\n($k_{y}=0$). It is therefore necessary to modify the HW model to treat the\nzonal components properly. The modified equations are solved numerically, and\nvisualization and analysis of the solutions show generation of stable zonal\nflows, through conversion of turbulent kinetic energy, and the consequent\nturbulence and transport suppression. It is demonstrated by comparison that the\nmodification is essential for generation of zonal flows.\n", "  A reformulation of a physical theory in which measurements at the initial and\nfinal moments of time are treated independently is discussed, both on the\nclassical and quantum levels. Methods of the standard quantum mechanics are\nused to quantize boundary phase space to obtain boundary quantum mechanics -- a\ntheory that does not depend on the distinction between the initial and final\nmoments of time, a theory that can be formulated without reference to the\ncausal structure. As a supplementary material, the geometrical description of\nquantization of a general (e.g. curved) configuration space is presented.\n"]}
