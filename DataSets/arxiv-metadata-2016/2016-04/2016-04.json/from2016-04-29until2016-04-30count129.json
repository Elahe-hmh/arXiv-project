It contains 5-dimensional metrics of Gross and Perry and\nMillward.\n", "  Quantum transmission spectra of a twisted electron waveguide expose the\ncoupling between traveling and quasi-bound states. Through a direct numerical\nsolution of the open-boundary Schr\\\"odinger equation we single out the effects\nof the twist and show how the presence of a localized state leads to a\nBreit-Wigner or a Fano resonance in the transmission. We also find that the\nenergy of quasi-bound states is increased by the twist, in spite of the\nconstant section area along the waveguide. While the mixing of different\ntransmission channels is expected to reduce the conductance, the shift of\nlocalized levels into the traveling-states energy range can reduce their\ndetrimental effects on coherent transport.\n", "  We perform self-consistent Schr\\\"odinger-Poisson calculations with exchange\nand correlation corrections to determine the electron/hole gas in a radial\nhetero-junction formed in a modulation doped GaAs/AlGaAs core-multi-shell\nnanowire (CSNW) which is n-/p-doped. Realistic composition and geometry are\nmapped on an symmetry compliant two-dimensional grid, and the\ninversion/accumulation layers are obtained assuming mid-gap Fermi energy\npinning at the surface. We show that the electron and hole gases can be tuned\nto different localizations and symmetries inside the core as a function of the\ndoping level. Contrary to planar hetero-junctions, conduction electrons do not\nform a uniform 2D electron gas (2DEG) localized at the GaAs/AlGaAs interface,\nbut rather show a transition between i) an isotropic, cylindrical distribution\ndeep in the GaAs core (low doping), and ii) a set of six tunnel-coupled\nquasi-1D channels at the edges of the interface (high doping). Holes, on the\nother hand, are much more localized at the GaAs/AlGaAs interface and form\neither i) six separated planar 2DEGs at the GaAs/AlGaAs interfaces (low\ndoping), ii) a quasi uniform six-fold bent 2DEG (intermediate doping), or iii)\nsix tunnel-coupled quasi-1D channels at the edges (high doping). We also\nsimulate the electron/hole gas in a CSNW-based field effect transistor. The\nfield generated by a back-gate may easily deform the electron or hole gas,\nbreaking the six-fold symmetry. Single 2DEGs at one interface or multiple\nquasi-1D channels are shown to form as a function of voltage intensity,\npolarity, and carrier type.\n", "  Magnetic states of the electron gas confined in modulation-doped core-shell\nnanowires are calculated for a transverse field of arbitrary strength and\norientation. Magneto-conductance is predicted within the Landauer approach. The\nmodeling takes fully into account the radial material modulation, the prismatic\nsymmetry and the doping profile of realistic GaAs/AlGaAs devices within an\nenvelope-function approach, and electron-electron interaction is included in a\nmean-field self-consistent approach. Calculations show that in the low\nfree-carrier density regime, magnetic states can be described in terms of\nLandau levels and edge states, similar to planar two-dimensional electron gases\nin a Hall bar. However, at higher carrier density the dominating\nelectron-electron interaction leads to a strongly inhomogeneous localization at\nthe prismatic heterointerface. This gives rise to a complex band dispersion,\nwith local minima at finite values of the longitudinal wave vector, and a\nregion of negative magneto-resistance. The predicted marked anisotropy of the\nmagneto-conductance with field direction is a direct probe of the inhomogeneous\nelectron gas localization of the conductive channel induced by the prismatic\ngeometry.\n", "  The pion-production target that serves the MICE Muon Beam consists of a\ntitanium cylinder that is dipped into the halo of the ISIS proton beam. The\ndesign and construction of the MICE target system are described along with the\nquality-assurance procedures, electromagnetic drive and control systems, the\nreadout electronics, and the data-acquisition system. The performance of the\ntarget is presented together with the particle rates delivered to the MICE Muon\nBeam. Finally, the beam loss in ISIS generated by the operation of the target\nis evaluated as a function of the particle rate, and the operating parameters\nof the target are derived.\n", "  Short review of the topical comprehension of the superconductor materials\nclasses Cuprate High-Temperature Superconductors, other oxide superconductors,\nIron-based Superconductors, Heavy-Fermion Superconductors, Nitride\nSuperconductors, Organic and other Carbon-based Superconductors and Boride and\nBorocarbide Superconductors, featuring their present theoretical understanding\nand their aspects with respect to technical applications.\n", "  The cosmological implications of introducing a variation to the fine\nstructure `constant', \\alpha are examined within the context of Loop Quantum\nCosmology. The evolution of \\alpha is described using the model introduced by\nBekenstein, Sandvik, Barrow and Magueijo, in which a ghost scalar field\nproduces the variation. The dynamics of the system are examined in flat and\nclosed cosmological settings. Matter consisting of the scalar field and\nradiation are examined with a thermodynamically motivated coupling between the\ntwo, which can lead to a series of bounces induced by both the negative density\neffects of the ghost field and the loop effects.\n", "  In this paper we give a systematic and simple account that put in evidence\nthat many breather solutions of integrable equations satisfy suitable\nvariational elliptic equations, which also implies that the stability problem\nreduces in some sense to $(i)$ the study of the spectrum of explicit linear\nsystems (\\emph{spectral stability}), and $(ii)$ the understanding of how bad\ndirections (if any) can be controlled using low regularity conservation laws.\nWe exemplify this idea in the case of the modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV),\nGardner, and sine-Gordon (SG) equations. Then we perform numerical simulations\nthat confirm, at the level of the spectral problem, our previous rigorous\nresults, where we showed that mKdV breathers are $H^2$ and $H^1$ stable,\nrespectively. In a second step, we also discuss the Gardner and the Sine-Gordon\ncases, where the spectral study of a fourth-order linear matrix system is the\nkey element to show stability. Using numerical methods, we confirm that all\nspectral assumptions leading to the $H^2\\times H^1$ stability of SG breathers\nare numerically satisfied, even in the ultra-relativistic, singular regime. In\na second part, we study the periodic mKdV case, where a periodic breather is\nknown from the work of Kevrekidis et al. We rigorously show that these\nbreathers satisfy a suitable elliptic equation, and we also show numerical\nspectral stability. However, we also identify the source of nonlinear\ninstability in the case described in Kevrekidis et al. Finally, we present a\nnew class of breather solution for mKdV, believed to exist from geometric\nconsiderations, and which is periodic in time and space, but has nonzero mean,\nunlike standard breathers.\n", "  In a (1+1)-dimensional midi-superspace model for gravitational plane waves, a\nflat space-time condition is imposed with constraints derived from null Killing\nvectors. Solutions to a straightforward regularization of these constraints\nhave diverging length and volume expectation values. Physically acceptable\nsolutions in the kinematic Hilbert space are obtained from the original\nconstraint by multiplying with a power of the volume operator and by a similar\nmodification of the Hamiltonian constraint, which is used in a regularization\nof the constraints. The solutions of the modified Killing constraint have\nfinite expectation values of geometric quantities. Further, the expectation\nvalue of the original Killing constraint vanishes, but its moment is\nnon-vanishing. As the power of the volume grows the moment of the original\nconstraint grows, while the moments of volume and length both decrease. Thus,\nthese states provide possible kinematic states for flat space, with\nfluctuations. As a consequence of the regularization of operators the quantum\nuncertainty relations between geometric quantities such as length and its\nconjugate momentum do not reflect naive expectations from the classical Poisson\nbracket relations.\n", "  For a large $n\\times m$ Gaussian matrix, we compute the joint statistics,\nincluding large deviation tails, of generalized and total variance - the scaled\nlog-determinant $H$ and trace $T$ of the corresponding $n\\times n$ covariance\nmatrix. Using a Coulomb gas technique, we find that the Laplace transform of\ntheir joint distribution $\\mathcal{P}_n(h,t)$ decays for large $n,m$ (with\n$c=m/n\\geq 1$ fixed) as $\\hat{\\mathcal{P}}_n(s,w)\\approx \\exp\\left(-\\beta n^2\nJ(s,w)\\right)$, where $\\beta$ is the Dyson index of the ensemble and $J(s,w)$\nis a $\\beta$-independent large deviation function, which we compute exactly for\nany $c$. The corresponding large deviation functions in real space are worked\nout and checked with extensive numerical simulations. The results are\ncomplemented with a finite $n,m$ treatment based on the Laguerre-Selberg\nintegral. The statistics of atypically small log-determinants is shown to be\ndriven by the split-off of the smallest eigenvalue, leading to an abrupt change\nin the large deviation speed.\n", "  We study a class of systems of stochastic differential equations describing\ndiffusive phenomena. The Smoluchowski-Kramers approximation is used to describe\ntheir dynamics in the small mass limit. Our systems have arbitrary\nstate-dependent friction and noise coefficients. We identify the limiting\nequation and, in particular, the additional drift term that appears in the\nlimit is expressed in terms of the solution to a Lyapunov matrix equation. The\nproof uses a theory of convergence of stochastic integrals developed by Kurtz\nand Protter. The result is sufficiently general to include systems driven by\nboth white and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck colored noises. We discuss applications of\nthe main theorem to several physical phenomena, including the experimental\nstudy of Brownian motion in a diffusion gradient.\n", "  Using the first-principles density functional approach, we investigate a\nmaterial Pr$_2$MgIrO$_6$ (PMIO) of double perovskite structure synthesized\nrecently. According to the calculations, PMIO is a magnetic Mott-Hubbard\ninsulator influenced by the cooperative effect of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and\nCoulomb interactions of Ir-5$d$ and Pr-4$f$ electrons, as well as the crystal\nfield. When Pr is replaced with Sr gradually, the system exhibits half metallic\n(HM) states desirable for spintronics applications. In\n[Pr$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$MgIrO$_6$]$_2$, HM antiferromagnetism (HMAFM) with zero spin\nmagnetization in the unit cell is obtained for $x=1$, whereas for $x=0.5$ and\n1.5 HM ferrimagnetism (HMFiM) is observed with $\\mu_{\\rm tot}=3\\mu_{\\rm B}$ and\n$\\mu_{\\rm tot}=-3\\mu_{\\rm B}$ per unit cell respectively. It is emphasized that\nthe large exchange splitting between spin-up and spin-down bands at the Fermi\nlevel makes the half metallicity possible even with strong SOC.\n", "  KamLAND-PICO project aims to search for WIMPs dark matter by means of NaI(Tl)\nscintillator. To investigate the WIMPs candidate whose cross section is as\nsmall as $10^{-9}$ pb, a pure NaI(Tl) crystal was developed by chemical\nprocessing and taking care of surroundings. The concentration of U and Th chain\nwas reduced to $5.4\\pm0.9$ ppt and $3.3\\pm2.2$ ppt, respectively. It should be\nremarked that the concentration of $^{210}$Pb which was difficult to reduce\nreached to the high purity as $58\\pm26$ $\\mu$Bq/kg.\n", "  We explore a method introduced by Chatterjee and Ledoux in a paper on\neigenvalues of principle submatrices. The method provides a tool to prove\nconcentration of measure in cases where there is a Markov chain meeting certain\nconditions, and where the spectral gap of the chain is known. We provide\nseveral additional applications of this method. These applications include\nresults on operator compressions using the Kac walk on $SO(n)$ and a Kac walk\ncoupled to a thermostat, and a concentration of measure result for the length\nof the longest increasing subsequence of a random walk distributed under the\ninvariant measure for the asymmetric exclusion process.\n", "  First-principles density functional theory (DFT) is used to investigate the\nelectronic and magnetic properties of Sr$_4$Rh$_3$O$_{10}$, a member of the\nRuddlesden-Popper series. Based on the DFT calculations taking into account the\nco-operative effect of Coulomb interaction ($U$) and spin-orbit couplings\n(SOC), Sr$_4$Rh$_3$O$_{10}$ is found to be a half metallic ferromagnet (HMF)\nwith total angular moment $\\mu_{\\rm {tot}}$=12$\\mu_B$ per unit cell. The\nmaterial has almost 100$\\%$ spin-polarization at the Fermi level despite of\nsizable SOC. Replacement of Rh atom by the isovalent Co atom is considered.\nUpon full-replacement of Co, a low-spin to intermediate spin transition happens\nresulting in a HMF state with the total angular moment three-time larger (i.e.\n$\\mu_{\\rm {tot}}$=36$\\mu_B$ per unit cell), compared to Sr$_4$Rh$_3$O$_{10}$.\nWe propose Sr$_4$Rh$_3$O$_{10}$ and Sr$_4$Co$_3$O$_{10}$ as candidates of half\nmetals.\n", "  The theory of stationary spatially localized patterns in dissipative systems\ndriven by time-independent forcing is well developed. With time-periodic\nforcing related but time-dependent structures may result. These may consist of\nbreathing localized patterns, or states that grow for part of the cycle via\nnucleation of new wavelengths of the pattern followed by wavelength\nannihilation during the remainder of the cycle. These two competing processes\nlead to a complex phase diagram whose structure is a consequence of a series of\nresonances between the nucleation time and the forcing period. The resulting\ndiagram is computed for the periodically forced quadratic-cubic\nSwift--Hohenberg equation, and its details interpreted in terms of the\nproperties of the depinning transition for the fronts bounding the localized\nstate on either side. The results are expected to shed light on localized\nstates in a large variety of periodically driven systems.\n", "  We present the concept of a track trigger for the Belle II experiment, based\non a neural network approach, that is able to reconstruct the z (longitudinal)\nposition of the event vertex within the latency of the first level trigger. The\ntrigger will thus be able to suppress a large fraction of the dominating\nbackground from events outside of the interaction region. The trigger uses the\ndrift time information of the hits from the Central Drift Chamber (CDC) of\nBelle II within narrow cones in polar and azimuthal angle as well as in\ntransverse momentum (sectors), and estimates the z-vertex without explicit\ntrack reconstruction. The preprocessing for the track trigger is based on the\ntrack information provided by the standard CDC trigger. It takes input from the\n2D ($r - \\varphi$) track finder, adds information from the stereo wires of the\nCDC, and finds the appropriate sectors in the CDC for each track in a given\nevent. Within each sector, the z-vertex of the associated track is estimated by\na specialized neural network, with a continuous output corresponding to the\nscaled z-vertex. The input values for the neural network are calculated from\nthe wire hits of the CDC.\n", "  Electric and magnetic currents are essential to describe electromagnetic\nstored energy, as well as the associated quantities of antenna Q and the\npartial directivity to antenna Q-ratio, D/Q, for general structures. The upper\nbound of previous D/Q-results for antennas modeled by electric currents is\naccurate enough to be predictive, this motivates us here to extend the analysis\nto include magnetic currents. In the present paper we investigate antenna Q\nbounds and D/Q-bounds for the combination of electric- and magnetic-currents,\nin the limit of electrically small antennas. This investigation is both\nanalytical and numerical, and we illustrate how the bounds depend on the shape\nof the antenna. We show that the antenna Q can be associated with the largest\neigenvalue of certain combinations of the electric and magnetic polarizability\ntensors. The results are a fully compatible extension of the electric only\ncurrents, which come as a special case. The here proposed method for antenna Q\nprovides the minimum Q-value, and it also yields families of minimizers for\noptimal electric and magnetic currents that can lend insight into the antenna\ndesign.\n", "  Boosting nonlinear frequency conversion in extremely confined volumes remains\na key challenge in nano-optics, nanomedicine, photocatalysis, and\nbackground-free biosensing. To this aim, field enhancements in plasmonic\nnanostructures are often exploited to effectively compensate for the lack of\nphase-matching at the nanoscale. Second harmonic generation (SHG) is, however,\nstrongly quenched by the high degree of symmetry in plasmonic materials at the\natomic scale and in nanoantenna designs. Here, we devise a plasmonic\nnanoantenna lacking axial symmetry, which exhibits spatial and frequency mode\noverlap at both the excitation and the SHG wavelengths. The effective\ncombination of these features in a single device allows obtaining unprecedented\nSHG conversion efficiency. Our results shed new light on the optimization of\nSHG at the nanoscale, paving the way to new classes of nanoscale coherent light\nsources and molecular sensing devices based on nonlinear plasmonic platforms.\n", "  We present a detailed study of the spherically symmetric solutions in Lorentz\nbreaking massive gravity. There is an undetermined function $\\mathcal{F}(X,\nw_1, w_2, w_3)$ in the action of St\\\"{u}ckelberg fields\n$S_{\\phi}=\\Lambda^4\\int{d^4x\\sqrt{-g}\\mathcal{F}}$, which should be resolved\nthrough physical means. In the general relativity, the spherically symmetric\nsolution to the Einstein equation is a benchmark and its massive deformation\nalso play a crucial role in Lorentz breaking massive gravity. $\\mathcal{F}$\nwill satisfy the constraint equation $T_0^1=0$ from the spherically symmetric\nEinstein tensor $G_0^1=0$, if we maintain that any reasonable physical theory\nshould possess the spherically symmetric solutions. The St\\\"{u}ckelberg field\n$\\phi^i$ is taken as a 'hedgehog' configuration $\\phi^i=\\phi(r)x^i/r$, whose\nstability is guaranteed by the topological one. Under this ans\\\"{a}tz,\n$T_0^1=0$ is reduced to $d\\mathcal{F}=0$. The functions $\\mathcal{F}$ for\n$d\\mathcal{F}=0$ form a commutative ring $R^{\\mathcal{F}}$. We obtain a general\nexpression of solution to the functional differential equation with spherically\nsymmetry if $\\mathcal{F}\\in R^{\\mathcal{F}}$. If $\\mathcal{F}\\in\nR^{\\mathcal{F}}$ and $\\partial\\mathcal{F}/\\partial X=0$, the functions\n$\\mathcal{F}$ form a subring $S^{\\mathcal{F}}\\subset R^{\\mathcal{F}}$. We show\nthat the metric is Schwarzschild, AdS or dS if $\\mathcal{F}\\in\nS^{\\mathcal{F}}$. When $\\mathcal{F}\\in R^{\\mathcal{F}}$ but $\\mathcal{F}\\notin\nS^{\\mathcal{F}}$, we will obtain some new metric solutions. Using the general\nformula and the basic property of function ring $R^{\\mathcal{F}}$, we give some\nanalytical examples and their phenomenological applications. Furthermore, we\nalso discuss the stability of gravitational field by the analysis of Komar\nintegral and the results of QNMs.\n", "  We present a theoretical framework for evaluating effective interactions\nbetween localized spins mediated by itinerant electrons in double-exchange\nmodels. Performing the expansion with respect to the spin-dependent part of the\nelectron hopping terms, we show a systematic way of constructing the effective\nspin model in the large Hund's coupling limit. As a benchmark, we examine the\naccuracy of this method by comparing the results with the numerical solutions\nfor the spin-ice type model on a pyrochlore lattice. We also discuss an\nextension of the method to the double-exchange models with Heisenberg and $XY$\nlocalized spins.\n", "  We compute the exact single-particle time-resolved dynamics of electronic\nMach-Zehnder interferometers based on Landau edge-states transport, and assess\nthe effect of the spatial localization of carriers on the interference pattern.\nThe exact carrier dynamics is obtained by solving numerically the\ntime-dependent Schroedinger equation with a suitable 2D potential profile\nreproducing the interferometer design. An external magnetic field, driving the\nsystem to the quantum Hall regime with filling factor one, is included. The\ninjected carriers are represented by a superposition of edge states and their\ninterference pattern reproduces the results of Y.Ji et al.[Nature 422, 415\n(2003)]. By tuning the system towards different regimes, we find two additional\nfeatures in the transmission spectra, both related to carrier localization,\nnamely a damping of the Aharonov-Bohm oscillations with increasing difference\nin the arms length, and an increased mean transmission that we trace to the\nenergy-dependent transmittance of quantum point contacts. Finally, we present\nan analytical model, also accounting for the finite spatial dispersion of the\ncarriers, able to reproduce the above effects.\n", "  For the 11-dimensional supergravity over AdS_4 x S^7/Z_k, beginning with a\ngeneral 4-from ansatz and the main geometry unchanged, we get a tower of\nmassive and tachyonic pseudoscalars. Indeed, the resultant equations can be\nassigned to the so-called $\\phi^4$ actions of the non-minimally coupled\nscalar-tensor theories with a cosmological constant. We focus on a well-known\ntachyonic and a new massive bulk mode, which are singlet under the internal\ngroup and break all supersymmetries, associated with skew-whiffing and\nWick-rotating of the background 4-from flux, respectively. The first one is the\nconformally coupled m^2=-2 pseudoscalar in the bulk of Euclidean AdS_4, where\nan exact instanton solution is found and a marginally triple-trace deformation\nwith a proper dimension-1 operator produces an agreeing boundary solution with\nfinite action. From the action evaluated on the solution, we estimate the decay\nrate of the vacuum tunneling mediated by the instanton. Another massive m^2=+4\nmode, with the so-called non-minimal coupling parameter $\\xi = - 1/3$, also\nbreaks the conformal invariance and so, there is no exact solution. Then, based\non the AdS_4/CFT_3 correspondence rules, we propose the dimension-4 ($\\Delta_+\n= +4$) boundary operator in the skew-whiffed (anti-M2-branes) theory to deform\nthe boundary action- consisting of a singlet fermion, an original scalar and\nU(1) gauges fields- with and find some solutions to be matched with the bulk\nsolutions.\n", "  We study the probability distribution $P$ of the sum of a large number of\nnon-identically distributed random variables $n_m$. Condensation of\nfluctuations, the phenomenon whereby one of such variables provides a\nmacroscopic contribution to the global probability, is discussed and\ninterpreted in analogy to phase-transitions in Statistical Mechanics. A general\nexpression for $P$ is derived, and its sensitivity to the details of the\ndistribution of a single $n_m$ is worked out. These general results are\nverified by the analytical and numerical solution of some specific examples.\n", "  A discrete-time Quantum Walk (QW) is essentially a unitary operator driving\nthe evolution of a single particle on the lattice. Some QWs admit a continuum\nlimit, leading to familiar PDEs (e.g. the Dirac equation). In this paper, we\nstudy the continuum limit of a wide class of QWs, and show that it leads to an\nentire class of PDEs, encompassing the Hamiltonian form of the massive Dirac\nequation in $(1+1)$ curved spacetime. Therefore a certain QW, which we make\nexplicit, provides us with a unitary discrete toy model of a test particle in\ncurved spacetime, in spite of the fixed background lattice. Mathematically we\nhave introduced two novel ingredients for taking the continuum limit of a QW,\nbut which apply to any quantum cellular automata: encoding and grouping.\n", "  We present a time-resolved terahertz spectroscopic study of the half-metallic\nferromagnet CrO$_2$. The ultrafast conductivity dynamics excited by an optical\npump displays a very short (several picoseconds) and a very long (several\nhundred picoseconds) characteristic time scales. We attribute the former to the\nelectron-phonon relaxation and the latter to the spin-lattice relaxation. We\nuse this distinction to quantify the relative contribution of the scattering by\nspin fluctuations to the resistivity of CrO$_2$: we find that they contribute\nless than one half of all scattering events below room temperature. This\ncontribution rises to $\\sim70$ % as the temperature approaches $T_C$=390 K. The\nsmall effect of spin fluctuations on the resistivity is unexpected in the light\nof the proposed double-exchange nature of the electronic and magnetic\nproperties of CrO$_2$.\n", "  In the letter by Stadnik and Flambaum [Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 151301 (2014)]\nit is claimed that topological defects passing through pulsars could be\nresponsible for the observed pulsar glitches. Here, we show that, independently\nof the detailed network dynamics and defect dimensionality, such proposal is\nfaced with serious difficulties.\n", "  In this work we provide an overview of our recent results about the quench\ndynamics of one-dimensional many-body quantum systems described by spin-1/2\nmodels. To illustrate those general results, here we employ a particular and\nexperimentally accessible initial state, namely the N\\'eel state. Both cases\nare considered: clean chains without any disorder and disordered systems with\nstatic random on-site magnetic fields. The quantity used for the analysis is\nthe probability for finding the initial state later in time, the so-called\nsurvival probability. At short times, the survival probability may decay faster\nthan exponentially, Gaussian behaviors and even the limit established by the\nenergy-time uncertainty relation are displayed. The dynamics at long times\nslows down significantly and shows a powerlaw behavior. For both scenarios, we\nprovide analytical expressions that agree very well with our numerical results.\n", "  Empirical formulas for the second inverse moment of the photoabsorption cross\nsections in nuclei are discussed in J. N. Orce, Phys. Rev. C 91, 064602 (2015).\nIn this Comment I point out that the experimental values used are\nsystematically too small in heavy nuclei by about 10% because of the neglection\nof the E1 strength below the neutron threshold. Furthermore, combining recently\ndeduced values of the polarizability in heavy and total photoabsorption data in\nlight nuclei it is demonstrated that the mass number dependence of \\sigma_(-2)\nis sensitive to the ratio of volume and surface coefficients of the symmetry\nenergy and parameters different to the ones chosen by Orce may be better\nsuited.\n", "  We present a computational study of the two-phonon Raman spectra of silicene\nand graphene within a density-functional non-orthogonal tight-binding model.\nDue to the presence of linear bands close to the Fermi energy in the electronic\nstructure of both structures, the Raman scattering by phonons is resonant. We\nfind that the Raman spectra exhibit a crossover behavior for laser excitation\nclose to the \\pi-plasmon energy. This phenomenon is explained by the\ndisappearance of certain paths for resonant Raman scattering and the appearance\nof other paths beyond this energy. Besides that, the electronic joint density\nof states is divergent at this energy, which is reflected on the behavior of\nthe Raman bands of the two structures in a qualitatively different way.\nAdditionally, a number of Raman bands, originating from divergent phonon\ndensity of states at the M point and at points, inside the Brillouin zone, is\nalso predicted. The calculated spectra for graphene are in excellent agreement\nwith available experimental data. The obtained Raman bands can be used for\nstructural characterization of silicene and graphene samples by Raman\nspectroscopy.\n", "  We find the forms of the transfer equations for polarized cyclotron radiation\nin the atmospheres of compact stars, which are simple enough to allow practical\nimplementation and still preserve all important physical effects. We take into\naccount a frequency redistribution of radiation within the cyclotron line as\nwell as the relativistic and quantum-electrodynamic effects. Our analysis is\nvalid for the magnetic fields up to $10^{13}$G and for temperatures well below\n500keV.} We present and compare two forms of the radiation transfer equations.\nThe first form, for the intensities of ordinary and extraordinary modes, is\napplicable for the compact stars with a moderate magnetic field strength up to\n$10^{11}$G for typical neutron star and up to $10^9$G for magnetic white\ndwarfs. The second form, for the Stokes parameters, is more complex, but\napplicable even if a linear mode coupling takes place somewhere in the\nscattering-dominated atmosphere. Analysing dispersion properties of a\nmagnetized plasma {in the latter case, we describe a range of parameters where\nthe linear mode coupling is possible and essential.\n", "  The origin of large perpendicular magneto-crystalline anisotropy (PMCA) in\nFe/MgO (001) is revealed by comparing Fe layers with and without the MgO.\nAlthough Fe-O $p$-$d$ hybridization is weakly present, it cannot be the main\norigin of the large PMCA as claimed in previous study. Instead, perfect epitaxy\nof Fe on the MgO is more important to achieve such large PMCA. As an evidence,\nwe show that the surface layer in a clean free-standing Fe (001) dominantly\ncontributes to $E_{MCA}$, while in the Fe/MgO, those by the surface and the\ninterface Fe layers contribute almost equally. The presence of MgO does not\nchange positive contribution from $\\langle xz|\\ell_Z|yz\\rangle$, whereas it\nreduces negative contribution from $\\langle z^2|\\ell_X|yz\\rangle$ and $\\langle\nxy|\\ell_X|xz,yz\\rangle$.\n", "  Classical and quantum anharmonic noncommutative oscillators with quartic\nself-interacting potential are considered and the effect of self-interaction\nterm on the free energy and partition function of both models is calculated to\nfirst order in coupling constant.\n", "  In this letter, we present a new procedure to determine completely the\ncomplex modular values of arbitrary observables of pre- and post-selected\nensembles, which works experimentally for all measurement strengths and all\npost-selected states. This procedure allows us to discuss the physics of\nmodular and weak values in interferometric experiments involving a qubit meter.\nWe determine both the modulus and the argument of the modular value for any\nmeasurement strength in a single step, by controlling simultaneously the\nvisibility and the phase in a quantum eraser interference experiment. Modular\nand weak values are closely related. Using entangled qubits for the probed and\nmeter systems, we show that the phase of the modular and weak values has a\ntopological origin. This phase is completely defined by the intrinsic physical\nproperties of the probed system and its time evolution. The physical\nsignificance of this phase can thus be used to evaluate the quantumness of weak\nvalues.\n", "  We study 95 split gates of different size on a single chip using a\nmultiplexing technique. Each split gate defines a one-dimensional channel on a\nmodulation-doped GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure, through which the conductance is\nquantized. The yield of devices showing good quantization decreases rapidly as\nthe length of the split gates increases. However, for the subset of devices\nshowing good quantization, there is no correlation between the electrostatic\nlength of the one dimensional channel (estimated using a saddle point model),\nand the gate length. The variation in electrostatic length and the\none-dimensional subband spacing for devices of the same gate length exceeds the\nvariation in the average values between devices of different length. There is a\nclear correlation between the curvature of the potential barrier in the\ntransport direction and the strength of the \"0.7 anomaly\": the conductance\nvalue of the 0.7 anomaly reduces as the barrier curvature becomes shallower.\nThese results highlight the key role of the electrostatic environment in\none-dimensional systems. Even in devices with clean conductance plateaus,\nrandom fluctuations in the background potential are crucial in determining the\npotential landscape in the active device area such that nominally identical\ngate structures have different characteristics.\n", "  The thermal history of a large class of running vacuum models in which the\neffective cosmological term is described by a truncated power series of the\nHubble rate, whose dominant term is $\\Lambda (H) \\propto H^{n+2}$, is discussed\nin detail. Specifically, by assuming that the ultra-relativistic particles\nproduced by the vacuum decay emerge into space-time in such a way that its\nenergy density $\\rho_r \\propto T^{4}$, the temperature evolution law and the\nincreasing entropy function are analytically calculated. For the whole class of\nvacuum models explored here we findthat the primeval value of the comoving\nradiation entropy density (associated to effectively massless particles) starts\nfrom zero and evolves extremely fast until reaching a maximum near the end of\nthe vacuum decay phase, where it saturates. The late time conservation of the\nradiation entropy during the adiabatic FRW phase also guarantees that the whole\nclass of running vacuum models predicts thesame correct value of the present\nday entropy, $S_{0} \\sim 10^{87-88}$ (in natural units), independently of the\ninitial conditions. In addition, by assuming Gibbons-Hawking temperature as an\ninitial condition, we find that the ratio between the late time and primordial\nvacuum energy densities is in agreement with naive estimates from quantum field\ntheory, namely, $\\rho_{\\Lambda 0}/\\rho_{\\Lambda I} \\sim10^{-123}$. Such results\nare independent on the power $n$ and suggests that the observed Universe may\nevolve smoothly between two extreme, unstable, nonsingular de Sitter phases.\n", "  We calculate the all-loop anomalous dimensions of current operators in\n$\\lambda$-deformed $\\sigma$-models. For the isotropic integrable deformation\nand for a semi-simple group $G$ we compute the anomalous dimensions using two\ndifferent methods. In the first we use the all-loop effective action and in the\nsecond we employ perturbation theory along with the Callan-Symanzik equation\nand in conjunction with a duality-type symmetry shared by these models.\nFurthermore, using CFT techniques we compute the all-loop anomalous dimensions\nof bilinear currents for the isotropic deformation case and a general $G$.\nFinally we work out the cases of anisotropic $SU(2)$ and the two coupling,\ncorresponding to the symmetric coset $G/H$ and a subgroup $H$, splitting of a\ngroup $G$.\n", "  The Adler equation with time-periodic frequency modulation is studied. A\nseries of resonances between the period of the frequency modulation and the\ntime scale for the generation of a phase slip is identified. The resulting\nparameter space structure is determined using a combination of numerical\ncontinuation, time simulations and asymptotic methods. Regions with an integer\nnumber of phase slips per period are separated by regions with noninteger\nnumbers of phase slips, and include canard trajectories that drift along\nunstable equilibria. Both high and low frequency modulation is considered. An\nadiabatic description of the low frequency modulation regime is found to be\naccurate over a large range of modulation periods.\n", "  A search is presented for the production of both first- and second-generation\nscalar leptoquarks with a final state of either two electrons and one jet or\ntwo muons and one jet. A data sample of proton-proton collisions at\ncenter-of-mass energy sqrt(s) = 8 TeV recorded with the CMS detector\ncorresponds to an integrated luminosity of 19.6 inverse femtobarns. Upper\nlimits are set on both the first- and second-generation leptoquark production\ncross sections as functions of the leptoquark mass and the leptoquark couplings\nto a lepton and a quark. Results are compared with theoretical predictions to\nobtain lower limits on the leptoquark mass. At 95% confidence level, single\nproduction of first-generation leptoquarks with a coupling and branching\nfraction of 1.0 is excluded for masses below 1730 GeV, and second-generation\nleptoquarks with a coupling and branching fraction of 1.0 is excluded for\nmasses below 530 GeV. These are the best overall limits on the production of\nfirst-generation leptoquarks to date.\n", "  Di-hadron correlations and jet-hadron correlations are frequently used to\nstudy interactions of the Quark Gluon Plasma with the hard partons that form\njets. The existing background subtraction methods for these studies depend on\nseveral assumptions and independent measurements of the Fourier coefficients of\nthe combinatorial background. In this paper, we present two background\nsubtraction methods which use the observation that the near-side correlation\nsignal is negligible for large separations between the associated particle and\nthe trigger. The combinatorial background is fit in this background-dominated\nregion. Including the reaction plane dependence of the raw correlation improves\nthese results. To test the accuracy of these methods, a simple model is used to\nsimulate di-hadron and jet-hadron correlations with a combinatorial background\nsimilar to that observed in the data. The true signal is compared to the\nextracted signal. The results are compared to results from two variants of the\nZero-Yield-At-Minimum (ZYAM) method. We test these methods for mid-peripheral\nand central collisions and for di-hadron and jet-hadron correlations. These\nmethods are more precise than the ZYAM method with fewer assumptions about the\nshape and level of the combinatorial background, even in central collisions\nwhere the experimental resolution on the measurement of the reaction plane\ndependence is poor. These methods will allow more accurate studies of\nmodifications of the away-side jet and will be particularly useful for studies\nof jet-hadron correlations, where the combinatorial background is poorly\nconstrained from previous studies.\n", "  In this paper we review, and extend to the non-isothermal case, some results\nconcerning the application of the maximum entropy closure technique to the\nderivation of hydrodynamic equations for particles with spin-orbit interaction\nand Fermi-Dirac statistics. In the second part of the paper we treat in more\ndetails the case of electrons on a graphene sheet and investigate various\nasymptotic regimes.\n", "  The magneto-photoluminescence in modulation doped core-multishell nanowires\nis predicted as a function of photo-excitation intensity in non-perturbative\ntransverse magnetic fields. We use a self-consistent field approach within the\neffective mass approximation to determine the photoexcited electron and hole\npopulations, including the complex composition and anisotropic geometry of the\nnano-material. The evolution of the photoluminescence is analyzed as a function\nof i) photo-excitation power, ii) magnetic field intensity, iii) type of\ndoping, and iv) anisotropy with respect to field orientation.\n", "  We review recent progress in the theoretical description of the violation of\ndiscrete space-time symmetries in hadronic and nuclear systems. We focus on\nparity-violating and time-reversal-conserving interactions which are induced by\nthe Standard Model weak interaction, and on parity- and time-reversal-violating\ninteractions which can be caused by a nonzero QCD theta term or by\nbeyond-the-Standard Model physics. We discuss the origins of such interactions\nand review the development of the chiral effective field theory extension that\nincludes discrete symmetry violations. We discuss the construction of\nsymmetry-violating chiral Lagrangians and nucleon-nucleon potentials and their\napplications in few-body systems.\n", "  The dissociation of a hydrogen molecule on MgO(001) films deposited on\nMo(001) surface is investigated systematically using periodic\ndensity-functional theory method. The unusual adsorption behavior of\nheterolytic dissociative hydrogen molecule at neighboring surface oxygen and\nsurface magnesium, is clarified here. To my knowledge, this heterolytic\ndissociative state has never been found before on bulk MgO(001) or metal\nsupported MgO(001) surfaces. The results confirm that, in all cases, the\nheterolytic dissociation is much more favorable that homolytic dissociation\nboth energetically and kinetically. The energy difference between two\ndissociative states are very large, in the range of 1.1 eV ~ 1.5 eV for Mo\nsupported 1 ML ~ 3 ML oxide films, which inhibits, to a great extent, the\nhomolytic dissociation in the respect of reaction thermodynamics. The energy\nbarrier of heterolytic dissociation are about 0.5 eV, much lower that the\nbarrier of homolytic dissociation. The transformation reaction on thick films\nwill be more endothermic. Passing through heterolytic dissociation state have\nsignificantly lowered the reaction heat and the energy barrier for obtaining\nhomolytic dissociative structure, which make the homolytic splitting of H2\neasier on 2 ML oxide films. The results provides a useful strategy for\nenhancing the reactivity of the nonreducible metal oxide.\n", "  We find dynamical invariants for open quantum systems described by the\nnon-Markovian quantum state diffusion (QSD) equation. In stark contrast to\nclosed systems where the dynamical invariant can be identical to the system\ndensity operator, these dynamical invariants no longer share the equation of\nmotion for the density operator. Moreover, the invariants obtained with from\nbi-orthonormal basis can be used to render an exact solution to the QSD\nequation and the corresponding non-Markovian dynamics without using master\nequations or numerical simulations. Significantly we show that we can apply\nthese dynamic invariants to reverse-engineering a Hamiltonian that is capable\nof driving the system to the target state, providing a novel way to design\ncontrol strategy for open quantum systems.\n", "  The nuclear level density and the $\\gamma$-ray strength function have been\nextracted for $^{89}$Y, using the Oslo Method on $^{89}$Y($p,p'\n\\gamma$)$^{89}$Y coincidence data. The $\\gamma$-ray strength function displays\na low-energy enhancement consistent with previous observations in this mass\nregion ($^{93-98}$Mo). Shell-model calculations give support that the observed\nenhancement is due to strong, low-energy $M1$ transitions at high excitation\nenergies.\n  The data were further used as input for calculations of the\n$^{88}$Sr($p,\\gamma$)$^{89}$Y and $^{88}$Y($n,\\gamma$)$^{89}$Y cross sections\nwith the TALYS reaction code. Comparison with cross-section data, where\navailable, as well as with values from the BRUSLIB library, shows a satisfying\nagreement.\n", "  The MEG experiment makes use of one of the world's most intense low energy\nmuon beams, in order to search for the lepton flavour violating process\n$\\mu^{+} \\rightarrow {\\rm e}^{+} \\gamma$. We determined the residual beam\npolarization at the thin stopping target, by measuring the asymmetry of the\nangular distribution of Michel decay positrons as a function of energy. The\ninitial muon beam polarization at the production is predicted to be $P_{\\mu} =\n-1$ by the Standard Model (SM) with massless neutrinos. We estimated our\nresidual muon polarization to be $P_{\\mu} = -0.85 \\pm 0.03 ~ {\\rm (stat)} ~ {\n}^{+ 0.04}_{-0.05} ~ {\\rm (syst)}$ at the stopping target, which is consistent\nwith the SM predictions when the depolarizing effects occurring during the muon\nproduction, propagation and moderation in the target are taken into account.\nThe knowledge of beam polarization is of fundamental importance in order to\nmodel the background of our ${\\megsign}$ search induced by the muon radiative\ndecay: $\\mu^{+} \\rightarrow {\\rm e}^{+} \\bar{\\nu}_{\\mu} \\nu_{\\rm e} \\gamma$.\n", "  The phase diagram of lead-free piezoelectric\n(1-x)K0.5Na0.5NbO3-xBi0.5Na0.5TiO3 system has been studied by high-resolution\nsynchrotron powder diffraction, neutron powder diffraction and selected area\nelectron diffraction (SAED). The two lead-free piezoelectric compounds,\nK0.5Na0.5NbO3 and Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 tend to form an infinite solid solution. The\noxygen octahedral tilt system has been mapped as a function of composition and\ntemperature. The results indicate that K0.5Na0.5NbO3-Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 does not\ndisplay a morphotropic phase boundary like lead zirconate titanate, and that\nthe most significant structural change as a function of composition occurs near\nx=0.14 and x=0.87 due to ionic disorder at A and B sites in the perovskite ABO3\nstructure at room temperature.\n", "  Recent results in quantum information theory characterize quantum coherence\nin the context of resource theories. Here we study the relation between quantum\ncoherence and quantum discord, a kind of quantum correlation which appears even\nin non-entangled states. We prove that the creation of quantum discord with\nmultipartite incoherent operations is bounded by the amount of quantum\ncoherence consumed in its subsystems during the process. We show how the\ninterplay between quantum coherence consumption and creation of quantum discord\nworks in the preparation of multipartite quantum correlated states and in the\nmodel of deterministic quantum computation with one qubit.\n", "  Alternating projection (AP) of various forms, including the Parallel AP\n(PAP), Real-constrained AP (RAP) and the Serial AP (SAP), are proposed to solve\nphase retrieval with at most two coded diffraction patterns. The proofs of\ngeometric convergence are given with sharp bounds on the rates of convergence\nin terms of a spectral gap condition.\n  To compensate for the local nature of convergence, the null initialization is\nproposed for initial guess and proved to produce asymptotically accurate\ninitialization for the case of Gaussian random measurement. Numerical\nexperiments show that the null initialization produces more accurate initial\nguess than the spectral initialization and that AP converges faster to the true\nobject than other iterative schemes for non-convex optimization such as the\nWirtinger Flow. In numerical experiments, AP with the null initialization\nconverges globally to the true object.\n", "  We propose a universal non-linear sigma model field theory for one\ndimensional frustrated ferromagnets, which applies in the vicinity of a\n\"quantum Lifshitz point\", at which the ferromagnetic state develops a spin wave\ninstability. We investigate the phase diagram resulting from perturbations of\nthe exchange and of magnetic field away from the Lifshitz point, and uncover a\nrich structure with two distinct regimes of different properties, depending\nupon the value of a marginal, dimensionless, parameter of the theory. In the\nregime relevant for one dimensional systems with low spin, we find a\nmetamagnetic transition line to a vector chiral phase. This line terminates in\na critical endpoint from which emerges a cascade of multipolar phases. We show\nthat the field theory has the property of \"asymptotic solubility\", so that a\nparticular saddle point approximation becomes asymptotically exact near the\nLifshitz point. Our results provide an analytic framework for prior numerical\nresults on frustrated ferromagnets, and can be applied much more broadly.\n", "  The presence of a large applied magnetic field removes the degeneracy of the\nvacuum energy states for spin-up and spin-down neutrons. For polarized neutron\nreflectometry, this must be included in the reference potential energy of the\nSchr\\\"odinger equation that is used to calculate the expected scattering from a\nmagnetic layered structure. For samples with magnetization that is purely\nparallel or antiparallel to the applied field which defines the quantization\naxis, there is no mixing of the spin states (no spin-flip scattering) and so\nthis additional potential is constant throughout the scattering region. When\nthere is non-collinear magnetization in the sample however, there will be\nsignificant scattering from one spin state into the other and the reference\npotentials will differ between the incoming and outgoing wavefunctions,\nchanging the angle and intensities of the scattering. The theory of the\nscattering and recommended experimental practices for this type of measurement\nare presented, as well as an example measurement.\n", "  In a quantum Hall ferromagnet, the spin polarization of the two-dimensional\nelectron system can be dynamically transferred to nuclear spins in its vicinity\nthrough the hyperfine interaction. The resulting nuclear field typically acts\nback locally, modifying the local electronic Zeeman energy. Here we report a\nnon-local effect arising from the interplay between nuclear polarization and\nthe spatial structure of electronic domains in a $\\nu=2/3$ fractional quantum\nHall state. In our experiments, we use a quantum point contact to locally\ncontrol and probe the domain structure of different spin configurations\nemerging at the spin phase transition. Feedback between nuclear and electronic\ndegrees of freedom gives rise to memristive behavior, where electronic\ntransport through the quantum point contact depends on the history of current\nflow. We propose a model for this effect which suggests a novel route to\nstudying edge states in fractional quantum Hall systems and may account for\nso-far unexplained oscillatory electronic-transport features observed in\nprevious studies.\n", "  As originally described by Rubakov, particles are produced during the\ntunneling of a metastable quantum field. We propose to extend his formalism to\ncompute the backreaction of these particles on the semiclassical decay\nprobability of the field. The idea is to integrate out the external bath of\nparticles by computing the reduced density matrix of the system. Following this\napproach, we derive an explicit correction factor in the specific case of\nscalar particle production in flat spacetime. In this given framework, we\nconclude that the backreaction is ultraviolet finite and enhances the decay\nrate. Moreover, in the weak production limit, the backreaction factor is\ndirectly given by one half of the total number of created particles. In order\nto estimate the importance of this correction, we apply our formalism to a toy\nmodel potential which allows us to consider both the decay of a homogeneous\nbounce and the nucleation of a thin-wall bubble. In the former case, the impact\nof the created particles is parameter dependent and we exhibit a reasonable\nchoice of variables for which ones the backreaction is significant. In the\nlatter case, we conclude that the backreaction is always negligible.\n", "  We present cosmological upper limits on the sum of active neutrino masses\nusing large-scale power spectrum data from the WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey and\nfrom the Sloan Digital Sky Survey - Data Release 7 (SDSS-DR7) sample of\nLuminous Red Galaxies (LRG). Combining measurements on the Cosmic Microwave\nBackground temperature and polarisation anisotropies by the Planck satellite\ntogether with WiggleZ power spectrum results in a neutrino mass bound of 0.37\neV at 95% C.L., while replacing WiggleZ by the SDSS-DR7 LRG power spectrum, the\n95% C.L. bound on the sum of neutrino masses is 0.38 eV. Adding Baryon Acoustic\nOscillation (BAO) distance scale measurements, the neutrino mass upper limits\ngreatly improve, since BAO data break degeneracies in parameter space. Within a\n$\\Lambda$CDM model, we find an upper limit of 0.13 eV (0.14 eV) at 95% C.L.,\nwhen using SDSS-DR7 LRG (WiggleZ) together with BAO and Planck. The addition of\nBAO data makes the neutrino mass upper limit robust, showing only a weak\ndependence on the power spectrum used. We also quantify the dependence of\nneutrino mass limit reported here on the CMB lensing information. The tighter\nupper limit (0.13 eV) obtained with SDSS-DR7 LRG is very close to that recently\nobtained using Lyman-alpha clustering data, yet uses a completely different\nprobe and redshift range, further supporting the robustness of the constraint.\nThis constraint puts under some pressure the inverted mass hierarchy and\nfavours the normal hierarchy.\n", "  Rotating wave approximation (RWA) plays a key rule in quantum optics to solve\nsome Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation approximately. For example, it is well known that\nRWA has been used to calculate the transition probability. However, so far no\none shows the validity of RWA. Recently Larson [J. Larson, Phys. Rev. Lett.\n108, 033601 (2012)] gave the first example showing that the application of RWA\nin the Jaynes-Cummings model may lead to false conclusions. In this paper, we\nanalytically and numerically show that the application of RWA leads to false\nconclusions about the transition probability for the near or exact resonance.\n", "  The numerical method toward the fast and accurate calculation of the dilute\nquantum gas is studied by proposing the Uehing-Uhlenbeck (U-U) model equation.\nIn particular, the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method is used to solve\nthe U-U model equation. The DSMC analysis of the U-U model equation surely\nenables us to obtain the accurate thermalization using a small number of sample\nparticles and calculate the dilute quantum gas dynamics in practical time.\nFinally, the availability of the DSMC analysis of the U-U model equation toward\nthe fast and accurate calculation of the dilute quantum gas is confirmed by\ncalculating the viscosity coefficient of the Bose gas on the basis of\nGreen-Kubo expression or shock layer of the dilute Bose gas around a circular\ncylinder\n", "  A renormalizable theory of gravity is obtained if the dimension-less\n4-derivative kinetic term of the graviton, which classically suffers from\nnegative unbounded energy, admits a sensible quantisation. We find that a\n4-derivative degree of freedom involves a canonical coordinate with unusual\ntime-inversion parity, and that a correspondingly unusual representation must\nbe employed for the relative quantum operator. The resulting theory has\npositive energy eigenvalues, normalisable wave functions, unitary evolution in\na negative-norm configuration space. We present a formalism for quantum\nmechanics with a generic norm.\n", "  We describe how the TwoSpect data analysis method for continuous\ngravitational waves (GWs) has been tuned for directed sources such as the Low\nMass X-ray Binary (LMXB), Scorpius X-1 (Sco X-1). A comparison of five search\nalgorithms generated simulations of the orbital and GW parameters of Sco X-1.\nWhere that comparison focused on relative performance, here the simulations\nhelp quantify the sensitivity enhancement and parameter estimation abilities of\nthis directed method, derived from an all-sky search for unknown sources, using\ndoubly Fourier- transformed data. Sensitivity is shown to be enhanced when the\nsource sky location and period are known, because we can run a fully-templated\nsearch, bypassing the all-sky hierarchical stage using an incoherent harmonic\nsum. The GW strain and frequency as well as the projected semi-major axis of\nthe binary system are recovered and uncertainty estimated, for simulated\nsignals that are detected. Upper limits on GW strain are set for undetected\nsignals. Applications to future GW observatory data are discussed. Robust\nagainst spin-wandering and computationally tractable despite unknown frequency,\nthis directed search is an important new tool for finding gravitational signals\nfrom LMXBs.\n", "  We propose to construct a chirally broken model based on the infrared fixed\npoint of a conformal system by raising the mass of some flavors while keeping\nthe others massless. In the infrared limit the massive fermions decouple and\nthe massless fermions break chiral symmetry. The running coupling of this\nsystem \"walks\" and the energy range of walking can be tuned by the mass of the\nheavy flavors. Renormalization group considerations predict that the spectrum\nof such a system shows hyperscaling.\n  We have studied a model with four light and eight heavy flavors coupled to\nSU(3) gauge fields and verified the above expectations. We determined the mass\nof several hadronic states and found that some of them are in the 2-3 TeV range\nif the scale is set by the pseudoscalar decay constant $F_\\pi \\approx 250$ GeV.\nThe $0^{++}$ scalar state behaves very differently from the other hadronic\nstates. In most of our simulations it is nearly degenerate with the pion and we\nestimate its mass to be less than half of the vector resonance mass.\n", "  The chiral anomaly provides a smoking-gun evidence of a new confining gauge\ntheory. Motivated by a reported event excess in a diphoton invariant mass\ndistribution at the LHC, we discuss a scenario that a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone\n(pNG) boson of a new QCD-like theory is produced by gluon fusion and decays\ninto a pair of the standard model gauge bosons. Despite the strong dynamics,\nthe production cross section and the decay widths are determined by anomaly\nmatching condition. The excess can be explained by the pNG boson with mass of\naround 750 GeV. The model also predicts exotic hadrons such as a color octet\nscalar and baryons. Some of them are within the reach of the LHC experiment.\n", "  We show that an adiabatic cycle excites Bose particles confined in a\none-dimensional box. During the adiabatic cycle, a wall described by a\n$\\delta$-shaped potential is applied and its strength and position are slowly\nvaried. When the system is initially prepared in the ground state, namely, in\nthe zero-temperature equilibrium state, the adiabatic cycle brings all bosons\ninto the first excited one-particle state, leaving the system in a\nnonequilibrium state. The absorbed energy during the cycle is proportional to\nthe number of bosons.\n", "  We consider Einstein gravity minimally coupled to a scalar field with a given\npotential in general dimensions. We obtain large classes of static hairy planar\nblack holes which are asymptotic to AdS space-times. In particular, for a\nspecial case $\\mu=(n-2)/2$, we obtain new classes of exact dynamical solutions\ndescribing black holes formation. We find there are two classes of collapse\nsolutions. The first class solutions describe the evolution start from AdS\nspace-time with a naked singularity at the origin. The space-time is linearly\nunstable and evolves into stationary black hole states even under small\nperturbation. The second class solutions describe the space-time spontaneously\nevolves from AdS vacua into stationary black hole states undergoing non-linear\ninstability. We also discuss the global properties of all these dynamical\nsolutions.\n", "  We examine the behaviour of homogeneous, anisotropic space-times,\nspecifically the locally rotationally symmetric Bianchi types $I$ and $VII_o$\nin the presence of anisotropic matter. By finding an appropriate constant of\nthe motion, and transforming the equations of motion we are able to provide\nexact solutions in the presence perfect fluids with anisotropic pressures. The\nsolution space covers matter consisting of a single perfect fluid which\nsatisfies the weak energy condition and is rich enough to contain solutions\nwhich exhibit behaviour which is qualitatively distinct from the isotropic\nsector. Thus we find that there is more `matter that matters' close to a\nhomogeneous singularity than the usual stiff fluid. Example metrics are given\nfor cosmologies whose matter sources are magnetic fields, relativistic\nparticles, cosmic strings and domain walls.\n", "  A system of $2\\times d$ hard rectangles on square lattice is known to show\nfour different phases for $d \\geq 14$. As the covered area fraction $\\rho$ is\nincreased from $0$ to $1$, the system goes from low-density disordered phase,\nto orientationally-ordered nematic phase, to a columnar phase with\norientational order and also broken translational invariance, to a high density\nphase in which orientational order is lost. For large d, the threshold density\nfor the first transition $\\rho_1^*$ tends to $0$, and the critical density for\nthe third transition $\\rho_3^*$ tends to $1$. Interestingly, simulations have\nshown that the critical density for the second transition $\\rho_2^*$ tends to a\nnon-trivial finite value $\\approx 0.73$, as $d \\rightarrow \\infty$, and\n$\\rho_2^* \\approx 0.93$ for $d=2$. We provide a theoretical explanation of this\ninteresting result. We develop an approximation scheme to calculate the surface\ntension between two differently ordered columnar phases. The density at which\nthe surface tension vanishes gives an estimate $\\rho_2^* = 0.746$, for $d\\to\n\\infty$, and $\\rho_2^*=0.923$ for $d=2$. For all values of $d$, these estimates\nare in good agreement with Monte Carlo data.\n", "  We study the infrared limit of the similarity renormalization group (SRG)\nusing a simple toy model for the nuclear force aiming to investigate the fixed\npoints of the SRG evolution with both the Wilson and the Wegner generators. We\nshow how a fully diagonal interaction at the similarity cutoff $\\lambda\n\\rightarrow 0$ may be obtained from the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian and\nquantify the diagonalness by means of operator norms. While the fixed points\nfor both generators are equivalent when no bound-states are allowed by the\ninteraction, the differences arising from the presence of the Deuteron\nbound-state can be disentangled very clearly by analyzing the evolved\ninteractions in the infrared limit $\\lambda \\to 0$ on a finite momentum grid.\nAnother issue we investigate is the location on the diagonal of the hamiltonian\nin momentum-space where the SRG evolution places the Deuteron bound-state\neigenvalue once it reaches the fixed point. This finite momentum grid setup\nprovides an alternative derivation of the celebrated trace identities, as a by\nproduct. The different effects due to either the Wilson or the Wegner\ngenerators on the binding energies of $A=2,3,4$ systems are investigated and\nrelated to the ocurrence of a Tjon-line which emerges as the minimum of an\navoided crossing between $E_\\alpha= 4 E_t - 3 E_d$ and $E_\\alpha= 2 E_t $. All\ninfrared features of the flow equations are illustrated using the toy model for\nthe two-nucleon $S$-waves.\n", "  The magnetic correlation in the Hubbard model on a two-dimensional\nanisotropic triangular lattice is studied by using the determinant quantum\nMonte Carlo method. Around half filling, it is found that the increasing\nfrustration $t'/t$ could change the wave vector of maximum spin correlation\nalong\n($\\pi,\\pi$)$\\rightarrow$($\\pi,\\frac{5\\pi}{6}$)$\\rightarrow$($\\frac{5\\pi}{6},\\frac{5\\pi}{6}$)$\\rightarrow$\n($\\frac{2\\pi}{3},\\frac{2\\pi}{3}$), indicating the frustration's remarkable\neffect on the magnetism. In the studied filling region <n>=1.0-1.3, the doping\nbehaves like some kinds of {\\it{frustration}}, which destroys the $(\\pi,\\pi)$\nAFM correlation quickly and push the magnetic order to a wide range of the\n$(\\frac{2\\pi}{3},\\frac{2\\pi}{3})$ $120^{\\circ}$ order when the $t'/t$ is large\nenough. Our non-perturbative calculations reveal a rich magnetic phase diagram\nover both the frustration and electron doping.\n", "  The scaling of the transition temperature into an ordered phase close to a\nquantum critical point as well as the order parameter fluctuations inside the\nquantum critical region provide valuable information about universal properties\nof the underlying quantum critical point. Here, we employ quantum Monte Carlo\nsimulations to examine these relations in detail for two-dimensional quantum\nsystems that exhibit a finite-temperature Ising-transition line in the vicinity\nof a quantum critical point that belongs to the universality class of either\n(i) the three-dimensional Ising model for the case of the quantum Ising model\nin a transverse magnetic field on the square lattice or (ii) the ${\\it chiral}$\nIsing transition for the case of a half-filled system of spinless fermions on\nthe honeycomb lattice with nearest-neighbor repulsion. While the first case\nallows large-scale simulations to assess the scaling predictions to a high\nprecision in terms of the known values for the critical exponents at the\nquantum critical point, for the later case we extract values of the critical\nexponents $\\nu$ and $\\eta$, related to the order parameter fluctuations, which\nwe discuss in relation to other recent estimates from ground state quantum\nMonte Carlo calculations as well as analytical approaches.\n", "  Using the WKB method, we show that the peak location ($r_{\\rm peak}$) of the\npotential, which determines the quasinormal mode frequency of the Kerr black\nhole, obeys an accurate empirical relation as a function of the specific\nangular momentum $a$ and the gravitational mass $M$. If the quasinormal mode\nwith $a/M \\sim 1$ is observed by gravitational wave detectors, we can confirm\nthe black-hole space-time around the event horizon, $r_{\\rm peak}=r_+\n+O(\\sqrt{1-q})$ where $r_+$ is the event horizon radius. While if the\nquasinormal mode is different from that of general relativity, we are forced to\nseek the true theory of gravity and/or face to the existence of the naked\nsingularity.\n", "  We analyze the superconducting instabilities in the vicinity of the\nquantum-critical point of an inversion symmetry breaking order. We first show\nthat the fluctuations of the inversion symmetry breaking order lead to two\ndegenerate superconducting (SC) instabilities, one in the $s$-wave channel, and\nthe other in a time-reversal invariant odd-parity pairing channel (the simplest\ncase being the same as the of $^3$He-B phase). Remarkably, we find that unlike\nmany well-known examples, the selection of the pairing symmetry of the\ncondensate is independent of the momentum-space structure of the collective\nmode that mediates the pairing interaction. We found that this degeneracy is a\nresult of the existence of a conserved fermionic helicity, $\\chi$, and the two\ndegenerate channels correspond to even and odd combinations of SC order\nparameters with $\\chi=\\pm1$. As a result, the system has an enlarged symmetry\n$U(1)\\times U(1)$, with each $U(1)\\times U(1)$ corresponding to one value of\nthe helicity $\\chi$. Because of the enlarged symmetry, this system admits\nexotic topological defects such as a fractional quantum vortex, which we show\nhas a Majorana zero mode bound at its core. We discuss how the enlarged\nsymmetry can be lifted by small perturbations, such as the Coulomb interaction\nor Fermi surface splitting in the presence of broken inversion symmetry, and we\nshow that the resulting superconducting state can be topological or trivial\ndepending on parameters. The $U(1)\\times U(1)$ symmetry is restored at the\nphase boundary between the topological and trivial SC states, and allows for a\ntransition between topologically distinct SC phases without the vanishing of\nthe order parameter. We present a global phase diagram of the superconducting\nstates and discuss possible experimental implications.\n", "  The layered Bi-chalcogenide compounds have been drawing much attention as a\nnew layered superconductor family since 2012. Due to the rich variation of\ncrystal structure and constituent elements, the development of new physics and\nchemistry of the layered Bi-chalcogenide family and its applications as\nfunctional materials have been expected. Recently, it was revealed that the\nlayered Bi chalcogenides can show a relatively high thermoelectric performance\n(ZT = 0.36 in LaOBiSSe at ~650 K). Here, we show the crystal structure\nvariation of the Bi-chalcogenide family and their thermoelectric properties.\nFinally, the possible strategies for enhancing the thermoelectric performance\nare discussed on the basis of the experimental and the theoretical facts\nreviewed here.\n", "  Recently, the direct detection of gravitational waves from black hole (BH)\nmergers was announced by the Advanced LIGO Collaboration. Multi-messenger\ncounterparts of stellar-mass BH mergers are of interest, and it had been\nsuggested that a small disk or celestial body may be involved in the binary of\ntwo BHs. To test such possibilities, we consider the fate of a wind powered by\nan active mini-disk in a relatively short, super-Eddington accretion episode\nonto a BH with ~10-100 solar masses. We show that its thermal emission could be\nseen as a fast optical transient with the duration from hours to days. We also\nfind that the coasting outflow forms external shocks due to interaction with\nthe interstellar medium, whose synchrotron emission might be expected in the\nradio band on a time scale of years. Finally, we also discuss a possible jet\ncomponent and the associated high-energy neutrino emission as well as\nultra-high-energy cosmic-ray acceleration.\n", "  It has often been thought that the northern radio relic in the galaxy cluster\nCIZA J2242.8+5301 (the \"Sausage\" Cluster) is associated with cosmic ray (CR)\nelectrons that are accelerated at a shock through the diffusive shock\nacceleration (DSA) mechanism. However, recent radio observations have shown\nthat the radio spectrum is curved, which is inconsistent with the prediction of\na simple DSA model. Moreover, the CR electron spectrum before being affected by\nradiative cooling seems to be too hard for DSA. In this study, we show that\nthese facts are natural consequences if the electrons are reaccelerated in\nturbulence downstream of the shock. In this model, DSA is not the main\nmechanism for generating high-energy electrons. We find that the mean free path\nof the electrons should be much shorter than the Coulomb mean free path for\nefficient reacceleration. The scale of the turbulent eddies must be smaller\nthan the width of the relic. We also predict hard X-ray spectra of inverse\nCompton scattering of photons.\n", "  We discuss the calculation of the double occupancy using Dynamical Mean-Field\nTheory (DMFT) in finite dimensions. The double occupancy can be determined from\nthe susceptibility of the auxiliary impurity model or from the lattice\nsusceptibility. The former method underestimates, whereas the latter\noverestimates the double occupancy. We illustrate this for the square-lattice\nHubbard model. We propose an approach for which both methods lead to identical\nresults by construction and which resolves this ambiguity. This self-consistent\ndual boson scheme results in a double occupancy that is numerically close to\nbenchmarks available in the literature.\n", "  It is shown that a convex combination of two non-Markovian evolutions may\nlead to Markovian semigroup. This shows that convex combination of quantum\nevolutions displaying nontrivial memory effects may result in a perfectly\nmemoryless evolution.\n", "  The first observation of the $B^0_s\\to\\bar{D}^0 K^0_S$ decay mode and\nevidence for the $B^0_s\\to\\bar{D}^{*0} K^0_S$ decay mode are reported. The data\nsample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 3.0 $\\text{fb}^{-1}$\ncollected in $pp$ collisions by LHCb at center-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV.\nThe branching fractions are measured to be \\begin{align*}\n\\mathcal{B}(B^0_s\\to\\bar{D}^0 \\bar{K}^0) &=\n(4.3\\pm0.5(\\text{stat})\\pm0.3(\\text{syst})\\pm0.3(\\text{frag})\\pm0.6(\\text{norm}))\\times10^{-4},\\\\\n\\mathcal{B}(B^0_s\\to\\bar{D}^{*0} \\bar{K}^0) &=\n(2.8\\pm1.0(\\text{stat})\\pm0.3(\\text{syst})\\pm0.2(\\text{frag})\\pm0.4(\\text{norm}))\\times10^{-4},\n\\end{align*} where the uncertainties are due to contributions coming from\nstatistical precision, systematic effects, and the precision of two external\ninputs, the ratio $f_s/f_d$ and the branching fraction of $B^0\\to\\bar{D}^0\nK^0_S$, which is used as a calibration channel.\n", "  Recently, two of us have studied iron line reverberation mapping to test\nblack hole candidates, showing that the time information in reverberation\nmapping can better constrain the Kerr metric than the time-integrated approach.\nMotivated by this finding, here we explore the constraining power of another\ntime-dependent measurement: an AGN iron line eclipse. An obscuring cloud passes\nbetween the AGN and the distant observer, covering different parts of the\naccretion disk at different times. Similar to the reverberation measurement, an\neclipse might help to better identify the relativistic effects affecting the\nX-ray photons. However, this is not what we find. In our study, we employ the\nJohannsen-Psaltis parametrisation, but we argue that our conclusions hold in a\nlarge class of non-Kerr metrics. We explain our results pointing out an\nimportant difference between reverberation and eclipse measurements.\n", "  We construct two associative algebras from a vertex operator algebra $V$ and\na general automorphism $g$ of $V$. The first, called $g$-twisted zero-mode\nalgebra, is a subquotient of what we call $g$-twisted universal enveloping\nalgebra of $V$. These algebras are generalizations of the corresponding\nalgebras introduced and studied by Frenkel-Zhu and Nagatomo-Tsuchiya in the\n(untwisted) case that $g$ is the identity. The other is a generalization of the\n$g$-twisted version of Zhu's algebra for suitable $g$-twisted modules\nconstructed by Dong-Li-Mason when the order of $g$ is finite. We are mainly\ninterested in $g$-twisted $V$-modules introduced by the first author in the\ncase that $g$ is of infinite order and does not act on $V$ semisimply. In this\ncase, twisted vertex operators in general involve the logarithm of the\nvariable. We construct functors between categories of suitable modules for\nthese associative algebras and categories of suitable (logarithmic) $g$-twisted\n$V$-modules. Using these functors, we prove that the $g$-twisted zero-mode\nalgebra and the $g$-twisted generalization of Zhu's algebra are in fact\nisomorphic.\n", "  Based on conventional S-20 processes, a new series of high quantum efficiency\n(QE) photocathodes has been developed that can be specifically tuned for use in\nthe ultraviolet, blue or green regions of the spectrum. The QE values exceed\n30% at maximum response, and the dark count rate is found to be as low as 30\nHz/cm$^2$ at room temperature. This combination of properties along with a fast\ntemporal response makes these photocathodes ideal for application in photon\ncounting detectors, which is illustrated with an MCP photomultiplier tube for\nsingle and multi-photoelectron detection.\n", "  We analyze the applicability of the Fermi-golden-rule description of\nquasiparticle relaxation in a closed diffusive quantum dot with\nelectron-electron interaction. Assuming that single-particle levels are already\nresolved but the initial stage of quasiparticle disintegration can still be\ndescribed by a simple exponential decay, we calculate the average inelastic\nenergy relaxation rate of single-particle excitations and its mesoscopic\nfluctuations. The smallness of mesoscopic fluctuations can then be used as a\ncriterion for the validity of the Fermi-golden-rule description. Technically,\nwe implement the real-space Keldysh diagram technique, handling correlations in\nthe quasi-discrete spectrum non-perturbatively by means of the non-linear\nsupersymmetric sigma model. The unitary symmetry class is considered for\nsimplicity. Our approach is complementary to the lattice-model analysis of Fock\nspace: thought we are not able to describe many-body localization, we derive\nthe exact lowest-order expression for mesoscopic fluctuations of the relaxation\nrate, making no assumptions on the matrix elements of the interaction. It is\nshown that for the quasiparticle with the energy $\\varepsilon$ on top of the\nthermal state with the temperature $T$, fluctuations of its energy width become\nlarge and the Fermi-golden-rule description breaks down at\n$\\max\\{\\varepsilon,T\\}\\sim\\Delta\\sqrt{g}$, where $\\Delta$ is the mean level\nspacing in the quantum dot, and $g$ is its dimensionless conductance.\n", "  We examined the crystal structure of the new thermoelectric material\nLaOBiS2-xSex, whose thermoelectric performance is enhanced by Se substitution,\nby using powder synchrotron X-ray diffraction and Rietveld refinement. The\nemergence of metallic conductivity and enhancement of the thermoelectric power\nfactor of LaOBiS2-xSex can be explained with the higher in-plane chemical\npressure caused by the increase of Se concentration at the in-plane Ch1 site\n(Ch = S, Se). High-temperature X-ray diffraction measurements for optimally\nsubstituted LaOBiSSe revealed anomalously large atomic displacement parameters\n(Uiso) for Bi and Ch atoms in the BiCh2 conduction layers. The anisotropic\nanalysis of the atomic displacement parameters (U11 and U33) for the in-plane\nBi and Ch1 sites suggested that Bi atoms exhibit large atomic displacement\nalong the c-axis direction above 300 K, which could be the origin of the low\nthermal conductivity in LaOBiSSe. The large Bi vibration along the c-axis\ndirection could be related to in-plane rattling, which is a new strategy for\nattaining low thermal conductivity and phonon-glass-electron-crystal states.\n", "  Mo$X_2$ ($X$=S or Se) is a semiconductor family with two-dimensional\nstructure. And a recent calculation predicted the superconductivity in electron\ndoped MoS$_2$ monolayer. In this work, the electronic structure and lattice\ndynamics of Mo$X_2$ bilayers with monolayer Na intercalated, have been\ncalculated. According to the electron-phonon interaction, it is predicted that\nthese bilayers can be transformed from indirect-gap semiconductors to a\nsuperconductors by Na intercalation. More interestingly, the biaxial tensile\nstrain can significantly enhance the superconducting temperature up to $\\sim10$\nK in Na-intercalated MoS$_2$. In addition, the phonon mean free path at\nroom-temperature is also greatly improved in Na intercalated MoSe$_2$, which is\nadvantaged for related applications.\n", "  The dynamical net-charge fluctuations (${\\nu}_{dyn}$) in different particle\nratios $K/{\\pi}$, $K/p$, and $p/{\\pi}$ are calculated from the hadron resonance\ngas (HRG) model and compared with STAR central Au+Au collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=7.7-200~$GeV and NA49 central Pb+Pb collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=6.3-17.3~$GeV. The three charged-particle ratios ($K/{\\pi}$,\n$K/p$, and $p/{\\pi}$) are determined as total and average of opposite and\naverage of same charges. We find an excellent agreement between the HRG\ncalculations and the experimental measurements, especially from STAR beam\nenergy scan (BES) program, while the strange particles in the NA49 experiment\nat lower Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) energies are not reproduced by the HRG\napproach. We conclude that the utilized HRG version seems to take into\nconsideration various types of correlations including strong interactions\nthrough the heavy resonances and their decays especially at BES energies.\n", "  We present a systematic characterization of multi-wavelength emission from\nblazar PKS 1510-089 using well-sampled data at infrared(IR)-optical, X-ray and\n$\\gamma$-ray energies. The resulting flux distributions, except at X-rays, show\ntwo distinct lognormal profiles corresponding to a high and a low flux level.\nThe dispersions exhibit energy dependent behavior except for the LAT\n$\\gamma$-ray and optical B-band. During the low level flux states, it is higher\ntowards the peak of the spectral energy distribution, with $\\gamma$-ray being\nintrinsically more variable followed by IR and then optical, consistent with\nmainly being a result of varying bulk Lorentz factor. On the other hand, the\ndispersions during the high state are similar in all bands expect optical\nB-band, where thermal emission still dominates. The centers of distributions\nare a factor of $\\sim 4$ apart, consistent with anticipation from studies of\nextragalactic $\\gamma$-ray background with the high state showing a relatively\nharder mean spectral index compared to the low state.\n", "  In the standard model of the elementary particles, the number of neutrino\nflavor is three. However, there have been indications of existence of 4th\nneutrino, called sterile neutrino, in some neutrino oscillation related\nexperiments. A number of experiments are planned to test whether such\nindications are true or not. Among them, experiments which use neutrinos from\npi+, K+, mu+ decay at rest (DAR) are promising because the energy spectra of\nneutrinos are very well known and clean oscillation measurements are possible.\nIn this proceedings, properties of such DAR neutrinos and LSND, JSNS2, OscSNS\nand KPipe experiments are briefly introduced.\n", "  The concept of directionally unbiased optical multiports is introduced, in\nwhich photons may reflect back out the input direction. A linear-optical\nimplementation is described, and the simplest three-port version studied.\nSymmetry arguments demonstrate potential for unusual quantum information\nprocessing applications. The devices impose group structures on two-photon\nentangled Bell states and act as universal Bell-state processors to implement\nprobabilistic quantum gates acting on state symmetries. These multiports allow\noptical scattering experiments to be carried out on arbitrary undirected graphs\nvia linear optics and raise the possibility of linear-optical information\nprocessing using group structures formed by optical qudit states.\n", "  Extraordinary dispersion features of both bulk and surface polaritons in a\nfinely-stratified magnetic-semiconductor structure which is under an action of\nan external static magnetic field in the Voigt geometry are discussed in this\nletter. It is shown that the conditions for total overlapping dispersion\nregions of simultaneous existence of bulk and surface polaritons can be reached\nproviding a conscious choice of the constitutive parameters and material\nfractions for both magnetic and semiconductor subsystems.\n", "  We propose a feasible scheme to implement a universal set of quantum gates\nbased on geometric phases and superadiabatic quantum control. Consolidating the\nadvantages of both strategies, the proposed quantum gates are robust and fast.\nThe diamond nitrogen-vacancy center system is adopted as a typical example to\nillustrate the scheme. We show that these gates can be realized in a simple\ntwo-level configuration by appropriately controlling the amplitude, phase, and\nfrequency of just one microwave field. The gate's robust and fast features are\nconfirmed by comparing the fidelity of the proposed superadiabatic geometric\nphase (controlled-PHASE) gate with those of two other kinds of phase\n(controlled-PHASE) gates.\n", "  We classify the phases of N=2 elliptic models in terms of their global\nproperties i.e. the spectrum of line operators. We show the agreement between\nthe field theory and the M-theory analysis and how the phases form orbits under\nthe action of the S-duality group which corresponds to the mapping class group\nof the Riemann surface in M-theory.\n", "  Fluctuating hydrodynamics (FH) describes the dynamics of the fluctuations for\nfluids at mesoscopic scales. Here we use this approach to study the\nfluctuations of the hydrodynamic variables of a thermotropic nematic liquid\ncrystal (NLC) in a nonequilibrium steady state (NESS). This state is induced by\nan externally imposed temperature gradient and a uniform gravity field. We\ncalculate analytically both, the equilibrium and nonequilibrium hydrodynamic\nmodes. We find that in this NESS the nonequilibrium effects produced by the\nexternal gradients only affect the longitudinal variables. This gives rise to a\npair of sound modes, one orientation mode of the director and two visco-heat\nmodes formed by the coupling of the shear and thermal modes. We also find that\nthe last three modes exhibit the largest changes. The analytical expressions\nthat we have found for the visco-heat modes imply that the heat and shear modes\nof the NLC are coupled, that they reduce to those of simple fluid in the\nisotropic limit and that these modes may become propagative, a feature that\nalso occurs in the simple fluid. In the isotropic limit of the nematic our\nresults also reduce to the hydrodynamic modes of a simple fluid in the presence\nof the same temperature gradient and the pressure gradient produced by the\ngravity field.\n", "  Thomson scattering of laser light is one of the most fundamental diagnostics\nof plasma density, temperature and magnetic fields. It relies on the assumption\nthat the properties in the probed volume are homogeneous and constant during\nthe probing time. On the other hand, laboratory plasmas are seldom uniform and\nhomogeneous on the temporal and spatial dimensions over which data is\ncollected. This is partic- ularly true for laser-produced high-energy-density\nmatter, which often exhibits steep gradients in temperature, density and\npressure, on a scale determined by the laser focus. Here, we discuss the\nmodification of the cross section for Thomson scattering in fully-ionized media\nexhibiting steep spatial inhomogeneities and/or fast temporal fluctuations. We\nshow that the predicted Thomson scattering spectra are greatly altered compared\nto the uniform case, and may even lead to violations of detailed balance.\nTherefore, careful interpretation of the spectra is necessary for spatially or\ntemporally inhomogeneous systems.\n", "  The recent-discovered Sr$_x$Bi$_2$Se$_3$ superconductor provides an\nalternative and ideal material base for investigating possible topological\nsuperconductivity. Here, we report that in Sr$_{0.065}$Bi$_{2}$Se$_3$, the\nambient superconducting phase is gradually depressed upon the application of\nexternal pressure. At high pressure, a second superconducting phase emerges at\nabove 6 GPa, with a maximum $T_c$ value of $\\sim$8.3 K. The joint\ninvestigations of the high-pressure synchrotron x-ray diffraction and\nelectrical transport properties reveal that the re-emergence of\nsuperconductivity in Sr$_{0.065}$Bi$_{2}$Se$_3$ is closely related to the\nstructural phase transition from ambient rhombohedral phase to high-pressure\nmonoclinic phase around 6 GPa, and further to another high-pressure tetragonal\nphase above 25 GPa.\n", "  Description of superradiance of few quantum emitters with non-radiative decay\nin terms of quantum states is presented. Quantum efficiencies (QE) of SR of two\nand three emitters are calculated and compared with the case of two and three\nindependent emitters. Maximum increase in QE is 8% for two emitters and 16% for\nthree emitters, it is reached at certain ratios between non-radiative and\nradiative rates. Approach can be generalized with inclusion of the incoherent\npump, dephasing and delay in emitter-emitter interaction.\n", "  In this paper, carried out were the investigations on the synthetic reaction\nmechanisms of 3,4-epoxybutyric acid (EBA) from 3-hydroxy-{\\gamma}-butyrolactone\n(HBL) with two different activating agents, methanesulfonyl chloride (MC) or\nacetic acid (AA), respectively, and on the convertion of EBA to L-carnitine by\ndensity functional theory (DFT/B3LYP). The theoretical calculations showed that\nthe two reaction mechanisms of EBA synthesis with MC or AA as an activating\nagent were nearly the same. If activated HBL is hydrolysed, not only ring\ncleavage reaction, but also reverse reaction to HBL can take place. In the case\nof AA as the activating agent, the activation energy ( energy barrier ) for EBA\nsynthesis is 1.8 times larger than that with MC. It means that the synthesis of\nEBA with AA may make more by-products with less yield of EBA than that with MC,\nthat can be one reason why AA gave the less yield than MC in EBA synthesis, as\nreported in the previous experimental study.\n", "  The detailed proof of cancellation of topologically unfactorized infrared\ndivergences in the inclusive production of lepton pair close to the threshold\nof heavy quarkonia is presented. To make the effects of transition between\nstates containing heavy quark pairs, which is important in such cancellation,\nthe final detected states are constrained to be lepton pair near the threshold\nof the heavy quarkonia instead of heavy quarkonia themselves. Such cancellation\nis crucial for the NRQCD factorization of these processes.\n", "  We have investigated the temperature evolution of the magnetic structures of\nHoFeO$_3$ by single crystal neutron diffraction. The three different magnetic\nstructures found as a function of temperature for \\hfo\\ are described by the\nmagnetic groups Pb$'$n$'2_1$, Pbn$2_1$ and Pbn$'2_1'$ and are stable in the\ntemperature ranges $\\approx$ 600-55~K, 55-37~K and 35$>T>2$~K respectively. In\nall three the fundamental coupling between the Fe sub-lattices remains the same\nand only their orientation and the degree of canting away from the ideal axial\ndirection varies. The magnetic polarisation of the Ho sub-lattices in these two\nhigher temperature regions, in which the major components of the Fe moment lie\nalong $x$ and $y$, is very small. The canting of the moments from the axial\ndirections is attributed to the antisymmetric interactions allowed by the\ncrystal symmetry. They include contributions from single ion anisotropy as well\nas the Dzyaloshinski antisymmetric exchange. In the low temperature phase two\nfurther structural transitions are apparent in which the spontaneous\nmagnetisation changes sign with respect to the underlying antiferromagnetic\nconfiguration. In this temperature range the antisymmetric exchange energy\nvaries rapidly as the the Ho sub-lattices begin to order. So long as the\nordered Ho moments are small the antisymmetric exchange is due only to Fe-Fe\ninteractions, but as the degree of Ho order increases the Fe-Ho interactions\ntake over whilst at the lowest temperatures, when the Ho moments approach\nsaturation the Ho-Ho interactions dominate. The reversals of the spontaneous\nmagnetisation found in this study suggest that in \\hfo\\ the sums of the Fe-Fe\nand Ho-Ho antisymmetric interactions have the same sign as one another, but\nthat of the Ho-Fe terms is opposite.\n", "  We use 57 recently found topological satellites of\nBroucke-Hadjidemetriou-Henon's periodic orbits with values of the topological\nexponent $k$ ranging from $k$ = 3 to $k$ = 58 to plot the angular momentum $L$\nas a function of the period $T$, with both $L$ and $T$ rescaled to energy\n$E=-\\frac12$. Upon plotting $L(T/k)$ we find that all our solutions fall on a\ncurve that is virtually indiscernible by naked eye from the $L(T)$ curve for\nnon-satellite solutions. The standard deviation of the satellite data from the\nsixth-order polynomial fit to the progenitor data is $\\sigma = 0.13$. This\nregularity supports Henon's 1976 conjecture that the linearly stable\nBroucke-Hadjidemetriou-Henon orbits are also perpetually, or\nKolmogorov-Arnold-Moser stable.\n", "  LISA Pathfinder satellite has been launched on 3th December 2015 toward the\nSun-Earth first Lagrangian point (L1) where the LISA Technology Package (LTP),\nwhich is the main science payload, will be tested. With its cutting-edge\ntechnology, the LTP will provide the ability to achieve unprecedented geodesic\nmotion residual acceleration measurements down to the order of $3 \\times\n10^{-14}\\,\\mathrm{m/s^2/{Hz^{1/2}}}$ within the $1-30\\,\\mathrm{mHz}$ frequency\nband. The presence of the spacecraft itself is responsible of the local\ngravitational field which will interact with the two proof test-masses.\nPotentially, such a force interaction might prevent to achieve the targeted\nfree-fall level originating a significant source of noise. We balanced this\ngravitational force with sub $\\mathrm{nm/s^2}$ accuracy, guided by a protocol\nbased on measurements of the position and the mass of all parts that constitute\nthe satellite, via finite element calculation tool estimates. In the following,\nwe will introduce requirements, design and foreseen on-orbit testing\nprocedures.\n", "  In 1956 $\\AA$. Pleijel gave his celebrated theorem showing that the\ninequality in Courant's theorem on the number of nodal domains is strict for\nlarge eigenvalues of the Laplacian. This was a consequence of a stronger result\ngiving an asymptotic upper bound for the number of nodal domains of the\neigenfunctions as the eigenvalues tend to $+\\infty$. A similar question occurs\nnaturally for Schr\"\\odinger operators. The first significant result has been\nobtained recently by the first author for the harmonic oscillator. The purpose\nof this paper is to consider more general potentials which are radial. We will\nanalyze the case when the potential tends to $+\\infty$ and the case when the\npotential is negative and tends to zero, where the considered eigenfucntion are\nassociated to the eigenvalues below the essential spectrum.\n", "  When gas giant protoplanets grow sufficiently massive, circumplanetary disks\nwould form. While solid bodies captured by the circumplanetary disks likely\ncontribute to the growth of the planets and regular satellites around them,\nsome of captured bodies would remain in planet-centered orbits after the\ndispersal of the disk. We examine capture and subsequent orbital evolution of\nplanetesimals in waning circumplanetary gas disks using three-body orbital\nintegration. We find that some of captured planetesimals can survive in the\ncircumplanetary disk for a long period of time under such weak gas drag.\nCaptured planetesimals have semi-major axes smaller than about one third of the\nplanet's Hill radius. Distributions of their eccentricities and inclinations\nafter disk dispersal depend on the strength of gas drag and the timescale of\ndisk dispersal, and initially strong gas drag and quick disk dispersal\nfacilitates capture and survival of planetesimals. However, in such a case,\nfinal orbital eccentricities and inclinations of captured bodies remain rather\nlarge. Although our results suggest that some of the present irregular\nsatellites of gas giant planets with small semi-major axes would have been\ncaptured by gas drag, other mechanisms are required to fully explain their\ncurrent orbital characteristics.\n", "  A new southern star-formation region, located at an estimated distance of\n~1.5 kpc in the Lynds 1664 dark cloud in Canis Major, is described. Lynds 1664\ncontains several compact star clusters, small stellar groups, and young stars\nassociated with reflection nebulae. Narrow-band H{\\alpha} and [SII] images\nobtained with 4-m CTIO telescope reveal more than 20 new Herbig-Haro objects\nassociated with several protostellar outflows.\n", "  Mechanical alloying method has been employed to prepare the Ba-Fe-As-P\nprecursors, necessary for the Ba-(As,P) flux growth of the single crystalline\nBaFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$. By alloying constituent elementals mechanically,\nthe Ba-(As,P) precursors are successfully formed at the room temperature within\none hour, significantly reducing preparation time. Using the mechanically\nalloyed precursors, we have grown single crystals of\nBaFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$ with the sizes up to 5~mm $\\times$ 5~mm $\\times$\n0.1~mm.\n", "  We study the relations between Dirac fields living on the 2-dimensional\nLorentzian cylinder and the ones living on the double-covering of the\n2-dimensional de Sitter manifold, here identified as a certain coset space of\nthe group $SL(2,R)$. We show that there is an extended notion of de Sitter\ncovariance only for Dirac fields having the Neveu-Schwarz anti-periodicity and\nconstruct the relevant cocycle. Finally, we show that the de Sitter symmetry is\nnaturally inherited by the Neveu-Schwarz massless Dirac field on the cylinder.\n", "  We observe quasi-static incommensurate magnetic peaks in neutron scattering\nexperiments on layered cobalt oxides La2-xSrxCoO4 with high Co oxidation states\nthat have been reported to be paramagnetic. This enables us to measure the\nmagnetic excitations in this highly hole-doped incommensurate regime and\ncompare our results with those found in the low-doped incommensurate regime\nthat exhibit hourglass magnetic spectra. The hourglass shape of magnetic\nexcitations completely disappears given a high Sr doping. Moreover, broad\nlow-energy excitations are found, which are not centered at the incommensurate\nmagnetic peak positions but around the quarter-integer values that are\ntypically exhibited by excitations in the checkerboard charge ordered phase.\nOur findings suggest that the strong inter-site exchange interactions in the\nundoped islands are critical for the emergence of hourglass spectra in the\nincommensurate magnetic phases of La2-xSrxCoO4.\n", "  In this paper, for the first time, there is comprehensively tackling the\nproblem of biomechanical optimization of a sport of situation such as judo.\nStarting from the optimization of more simple sports, optimization of this kind\nof complex sports is grounded on a general physics tool such as the analysis of\nvariation. The objective function is divided for static and dynamic situation\nof Athletes couple, and it is proposed also a sort of dynamic programming\nproblem Strategic Optimization. A dynamic programming problem is an\noptimization problem in which decisions have to be taken sequentially over\nseveral time periods linked in some fashion.\n  A strategy for a dynamic programming problem is just a contingency plan, a\nplan that specifies what is to be done at each stage as a function of all that\nhas transpired up to that point. It is possible to demonstrate, under some\nconditions, that a Markovian optimal strategy is an optimal strategy for the\ndynamic programming problem under examination. At last we try to approach the\noptimization of couple of athletes motion. Shifting s Trajectories study is a\nvery hard and complex work, because falls among fractal, self similar\ntrajectories produced by Chaotic, irregular, Dynamics. It is possible to\nOptimize Athletes motion planning. Motion planning could be defined as the\nproblem of finding a collision free trajectory from the start configuration to\nthe goal configuration. It is possible to treat motion as an optimization\nproblem, to search the trajectory that drive adversary into a final broken\nsymmetry position, where it is possible to collide and apply one of the two\nthrowing tools: Couple or Lever.\n", "  Some properties of lepton mixing and neutrino masses can be computed under\nthe assumption of A5 and CP as a symmetry in the leptonic sector. The results\nshow that four mixing patterns accommodate well the oscillation data, i.e. all\nthe mixing angles are in the 3sigma confidence region. We also introduce an\nexplicit realization of this framework in the case of the Weinberg operator\nwhere the neutrino mass spectrum can be computed.\n", "  Modern experiments aimed at measuring neutrino oscillation parameters have\nentered the age of precision. The determination of these parameters strongly\ndepends on the ability to reconstruct the energy distributions of the neutrino\nbeams. We compare two different energy reconstruction techniques: the\nreconstruction based on the kinematic of the outgoing lepton and the one based\non the calorimetric method. Furthermore, we analyze realistic detector\ncapabilities, such as energy resolutions, thresholds and efficiencies, in order\nto estimate how well they need to be evaluated to avoid a significant bias in\nthe extraction of the oscillation parameters.\n", "  We investigate the conductance of a Normal-Normal'-Superconductor (NN'S)\njunction, in which current injection destroys superconductivity in a small\nregion N' of the superconductor, with a size varying with the applied voltage\nV. Voltage-dependent de Gennes-Saint James (dGSJ) bound states appearing in the\nN' slab lead to two distinct sets of conductance oscillations. We show that\nthis effect significantly alters the conductance of systems for which\n$\\kappa^2v_F \\sim 10^9$ m/s such as pnictides ($\\kappa$ and $v_F$ being the\nGinzburg number and the Fermi velocity, respectively), and we discuss their\nconsequences on the identification of the bosonic modes of strongly coupled\nsuperconductors.\n", "  We review some prominent results of ITEP theorists obtained in the first 70\nyears of the Institute operation\n", "  In Coulomb drag propulsion, a long high voltage tether or system of tethers\ngathers momentum from a natural plasma stream such as solar wind or ionospheric\nplasma ram flow. A positively polarised tether in the solar wind can be used\nfor efficient general-purpose interplanetary propellantless propulsion (the\nelectric solar wind sail or E-sail), whereas a negatively polarised tether in\nLEO can be used for efficient deorbiting of satellites (the plasma brake).\nAalto-1 is a 3-U cubesat to be launched in May 2016. The satellite carries\nthree scientific experiments including 100 m long Coulomb drag tether\nexperiment. The tether is made of four 25 and 50 micrometre diameter aluminium\nwires that are ultrasonically bonded together every few centimetre intervals.\nThe tether can be charged by an onboard voltage source up to one kilovolt\npositive and negative. The Coulomb drag is measured by monitoring the spin\nrate.\n", "  Various approaches to physics beyond the Standard Model can lead to small\nviolations of CPT invariance. Since CPT symmetry can be measured with ultrahigh\nprecision, CPT tests offer an interesting phenomenological avenue to search for\nunderlying physics. We discuss this reasoning in more detail, comment on the\nconnection between CPT and Lorentz invariance, and review how CPT breaking\nwould affect the (anti)hydrogen spectrum.\n", "  An ultrasound measurement system was employed as a non-destructive method to\nevaluate its reliability in predicting the tensile strength of tablets and\ninvestigate the benefits of incorporating it in a continuous line,\nmanufacturing solid dosage forms. Tablets containing lactose, acetaminophen,\nand magnesium stearate were manufactured continuously and in batches. The\neffect of two processing parameters, compaction force and level of shear strain\nwere examined. Young's modulus and tensile strength of tablets were obtained by\nultrasound and diametrical mechanical testing, respectively. It was found that\nas the blend was exposed to increasing levels of shear strain, the speed of\nsound in the tablets decreased and the tablets became both softer and\nmechanically weaker. Moreover, the results indicate that two separate tablet\nmaterial properties (e.g., relative density and Young's modulus) are necessary\nin order to predict tensile strength. A strategy for hardness prediction is\nproposed that uses the existing models for Young's modulus and tensile strength\nof porous materials. Ultrasound testing was found to be very sensitive in\ndifferentiating tablets with similar formulation but produced under different\nprocessing conditions (e.g., different level of shear strain), thus, providing\na fast, and non-destructive method for hardness prediction that could be\nincorporated to a continuous manufacturing process.\n", "  Vortex waves, which carry orbital angular momentum, have found use in a range\nof fields from quantum communications to particle manipulation. Due to their\nwidespread influence, significant attention has been paid to the methods by\nwhich vortex waves are generated. For example, active phased arrays generate\ndiverse vortex modes at the cost of electronic complexity and power\nconsumption. Conversely, analog apertures, such as spiral phase plates,\nmetasurfaces, and gratings require separate apertures to generate each mode.\nHere we present a new class of metamaterial-based acoustic vortex generators,\nwhich are both geometrically and electronically simple, and topologically\ntunable. Our metamaterial approach generates vortex waves by wrapping an\nacoustic leaky wave antenna back upon itself. Exploiting the antennas\nfrequency-varying refractive index, we demonstrate experimentally and\nanalytically that this analog structure generates both integer, and non-integer\nvortex modes. The metamaterial design makes the aperture compact and can thus\nbe integrated into high-density systems.\n", "  We have developed a Monte Carlo model for studying the local degradation of\nelectrons in the energy range 9-10000 eV in xenon gas. Analytically fitted form\nof electron impact cross sections for elastic and various inelastic processes\nare fed as input data to the model. Two dimensional numerical yield spectrum,\nwhich gives information on the number of energy loss events occurring in a\nparticular energy interval, is obtained as output of the model. Numerical yield\nspectrum is fitted analytically, thus obtaining analytical yield spectrum. The\nanalytical yield spectrum can be used to calculate electron fluxes, which can\nbe further employed for the calculation of volume production rates. Using yield\nspectrum, mean energy per ion pair and efficiencies of inelastic processes are\ncalculated. The value for mean energy per ion pair for Xe is 22 eV at 10 keV.\nIonization dominates for incident energies greater than 50 eV and is found to\nhave an efficiency of 65% at 10 keV. The efficiency for the excitation process\nis 30% at 10 keV.\n", "  Some intrinsic tools from the formal theory of variational equations are\nbeing demonstrated at work in application to one concrete example of the\nthird-order evolution equation of free relativistic top in three-dimensional\nspace-time. The main goal is to introduce a combined approach consisting in the\nsimultaneous utilization of symmetry principles along with the inverse\nvariational problem considerations in terms of vector-valued differential\nforms. Next, some simple algorithm of transition between the autonomous\nvariational problem and the variational problem in parametric form is\nestablished. The example definitely solved shows no-existence of a globally and\nintrinsically defined Lagrangian for the Poincar\\'e-invariant and well defined\nunique variational equation in the case in hand. Hamiltonian counterpart is\nbriefly discussed in terms of Poisson bracket. The model appears to provide a\ngeneralized canonical description of the quasi-classical spinning particle\ngoverned by the Mathisson-Papapetrou equations in flat space-time.\n", "  A detailed study about magnetic sensing techniques based on anisotropic\nmagnetoresistive sensors shows that the technology is suitable for\nlow-frequency space applications like the eLISA mission. Low noise magnetic\nmeasurements at the sub-millihertz frequencies were taken by using different\nelectronic noise reduction techniques in the signal conditioning circuit. We\nfound that conventional modulation techniques reversing the sensor bridge\nexcitation do not reduce the potential $1/f$ noise of the magnetoresistors, so\nalternative methods such as flipping and electro-magnetic feedback are\nnecessary. In addition, a low-frequency noise analysis of the signal\nconditioning circuits has been performed in order to identify and minimize the\ndifferent main contributions from the overall noise. The results for chip-scale\nmagnetoresistances exhibit similar noise along the eLISA bandwidth ($0.1\\,{\\rm\nmHz}-1\\,{\\rm Hz}$) to the noise measured by means of the voluminous fluxgate\nmagnetometers used in its precursor mission, known as LISA Pathfinder.\n", "  We investigate the performance of the finite volume method in solving\nviscoplastic flows. The creeping square lid-driven cavity flow of a Bingham\nplastic is chosen as the test case and the constitutive equation is regularised\nas proposed by Papanastasiou [J. Rheol. 31 (1987) 385-404]. It is shown that\nthe convergence rate of the standard SIMPLE pressure-correction algorithm,\nwhich is used to solve the algebraic equation system that is produced by the\nfinite volume discretisation, severely deteriorates as the Bingham number\nincreases, with a corresponding increase in the non-linearity of the equations.\nIt is shown that using the SIMPLE algorithm in a multigrid context dramatically\nimproves convergence, although the multigrid convergence rates are much worse\nthan for Newtonian flows. The numerical results obtained for Bingham numbers as\nhigh as 1000 compare favourably with reported results of other methods.\n", "  Smith-Purcell radiation and Transition Radiation are two radiative phenomenon\nthat occur in charged particles accelerators. For both the emission can be\nsignificantly enhanced with sufficiently short pulses and both can be used to\nmeasure the form factor of the pulse. We compare the yield of these phenomenon\nin different configurations and look at their application as bunch length\nmonitors, including background filtering and rejection. We apply these\ncalculations to the specific case of the CLIO Free Electron laser.\n", "  In this paper, we proved the correspondence between Feynman diagrams in\nspace-time and light-cone diagrams in world-sheet by using only path integral\nrepresentation on free Green function in the first quantization theory. We also\nobtained general representation on perturbation series of light-cone diagrams\ndescribing split and join of strings.\n", "  Predictions of material activation inventories will be a key input to\nvirtually all aspects of the operation, safety and environmental assessment of\nfuture fusion nuclear plants. Additionally, the neutron-induced transmutation\n(change) of material composition (inventory) with time, and the creation and\nevolution of configurational damage from atomic displacements, require precise\nquantification because they can lead to significant changes in material\nproperties, and thus influence reactor-component lifetime. A comprehensive\nscoping study has been performed to quantify the activation, transmutation\n(depletion and build-up) and immediate damage response under neutron\nirradiation for all naturally occurring elements from hydrogen to bismuth. The\nresulting database provides a global picture of the response of a material,\ncovering the majority of nuclear technological space, but focussing\nspecifically on typical conditions expected for a demonstration fusion power\nplant (DEMO). Results from fusion are compared against typical fission\nconditions for selected fusion relevant materials, demonstrating that the\nlatter cannot be relied upon to give accurate scalable experimental predictions\nof material response in a future fusion reactor. Results from different nuclear\ndata libraries are also compared, highlighting the variations and deficiencies.\n", "  In this work, sintered polycrystalline cubic boron nitride (cBN) compacts,\nwith titanium carbonitride (TiC0.7N0.3) and titanium nitride (TiN),\nrespectively, as binders, were prepared at temperature of 1450{\\deg}C and\npressure of 5.5 GPa during 3 minutes, and the influence of binders on the\nplastic deformation of cBN powder due to the sintering process was\nexperimentally investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. It was shown\nthat the sintered compact with titanium carbonitride as a binder displays more\nintense plastic deformation of cBN grains than that with titanium nitride\nbinder. This result indicated that if the binders are different, then products\nformed during sintering of cBN powders under high pressure and high temperature\n(HP-HT) are different so that the stress concentration at the cBN grain\nboundaries and a pinning effect, reducing the mobility of the dislocations and\npreventing annealing, are different in two cases.\n", "  A new characterization of the singular packing subspaces of general bounded\nself-adjoint operators is presented, which is used to show that the set of\noperators whose spectral measures have upper packing dimension equal to one is\na $G_\\delta$ (in suitable metric spaces). As an application, it is proven that,\ngenerically (in space of continuous sampling functions), spectral measures of\nthe limit-periodic Schr\\\"odinger operators have upper packing dimensions equal\nto one. Consequently, in a generic set, these operators are quasiballistic.\n", "  We show how a proper radial modulation of the composition of core-multi-shell\nnanowires critically enhances the control of the free-carrier density in the\nhigh-mobility core with respect to core-single-shell structures, thus\novercoming the technological difficulty of fine tuning the remote doping\ndensity. We calculate the electron population of the different nanowire layers\nas a function of the doping density and of several geometrical parameters by\nmeans of a self-consistent Schr\\\"odinger-Poisson approach: Free carriers tend\nto localize in the outer shell and screen the core from the electric field of\nthe dopants.\n", "  In the 80 years since the seminal Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR) paper,\nphysicists and philosophers have mused about the `spooky action at a distance'\naspect of quantum mechanics that so bothered Einstein. In his formal analysis\nof EPR-type entangled quantum states, Bell (1964) concluded that any hidden\nvariable theory designed to reproduce the predictions of quantum mechanics must\nnecessarily be nonlocal and allow superluminal interactions. This doesn't\nimmediately imply that nonlocality is a characteristic feature of quantum\nmechanics let alone a fundamental property of nature; however, many physicists\nand philosophers of science do harbor this belief. Experts in the field often\nuse the term `nonlocality' to designate particular non-classical aspects of\nquantum entanglement and do not confuse the term with superluminal\ninteractions. However, many physicists seem to take the term more literally. I\nendeavor to disabuse the latter of this notion by emphasizing that the\ncorrelations of Bell-type entanglement are a result of ordinary quantum\nsuperposition with no need to introduce nonlocality. The conclusion of the EPR\npaper wasn't that quantum mechanics is nonlocal but rather that it is an\nincomplete description of reality. For different reasons, many physicists,\nincluding me, agree with Einstein that quantum mechanics is necessarily an\nincomplete description of reality.\n", "  We show that spectral Hausdorff dimensional properties of discrete\nSchr\\\"oodinger operators with (1) Sturmian potentials of bounded density and\n(2) a class of sparse potentials are preserved under suitable polynomial\ndecaying perturbations, when the spectrum of these perturbed operators have\nsome singular continuous component.\n", "  We present a study exploring the range of applicability of a generalized Fick\nJacobs equation in the case when diffusive mass transport of a fluid along a\npore includes chemical reactions in the bulk and pore surface. The study\ncontemplates nonequilibrium boundary conditions and makes emphasis on the\ncomparison between the predictions coming from the projected Fick Jacobs\ndescription and the corresponding predictions of the original two dimensional\nmass balance equation, establishing a simple cuantitative criterion of validity\nof the projected description. For the adsorption desorption process, we\ndemonstrate that the length and the local curvature of the pore are the\nrelevant geometric quantities for its description, allowing for giving very\nprecise predictions of the mass concentration along the pore. Some schematic\ncases involving adsorption and chemical reaction are used to quantify with\ndetail the concentration profiles in transient and stationary states involving\nequilibrium and nonequilibrium situations. Our approach provides novel and\nimportant insights in the study of diffusion and adsorption in confined\ngeometries.\n", "  Solar flares signify the sudden release of magnetic energy and are sources of\nso called space weather. The fine structures (below 500 km) of flares are\nrarely observed and are accessible to only a few instruments world-wide. Here\nwe present observation of a solar flare using exceptionally high resolution\nimages from the 1.6~m New Solar Telescope (NST) equipped with high order\nadaptive optics at Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO). The observation reveals\nthe process of the flare in unprecedented detail, including the flare ribbon\npropagating across the sunspots, coronal rain (made of condensing plasma)\nstreaming down along the post-flare loops, and the chromosphere's response to\nthe impact of coronal rain, showing fine-scale brightenings at the footpoints\nof the falling plasma. Taking advantage of the resolving power of the NST, we\nmeasure the cross-sectional widths of flare ribbons, post-flare loops and\nfootpoint brighenings, which generally lie in the range of 80-200 km, well\nbelow the resolution of most current instruments used for flare studies.\nConfining the scale of such fine structure provides an essential piece of\ninformation in modeling the energy transport mechanism of flares, which is an\nimportant issue in solar and plasma physics.\n", "  A feasible design for a magnetic diagnostics subsystem for eLISA will be\nbased on that of its precursor mission, LISA Pathfinder. Previous experience\nindicates that magnetic field estimation at the positions of the test masses\nhas certain complications. This is due to two reasons. The first one is that\nmagnetometers usually back-act due to their measurement principles (i.e., they\nalso create their own magnetic fields), while the second is that the sensors\nselected for LISA Pathfinder have a large size, which conflicts with space\nresolution and with the possibility of having a sufficient number of them to\nproperly map the magnetic field around the test masses. However,\nhigh-sensitivity and small-size sensors that significantly mitigate the two\naforementioned limitations exist, and have been proposed to overcome these\nproblems. Thus, these sensors will be likely selected for the magnetic\ndiagnostics subsystem of eLISA. Here we perform a quantitative analysis of the\nnew magnetic subsystem, as it is currently conceived, and assess the\nfeasibility of selecting these sensors in the final configuration of the\nmagnetic diagnostic subsystem.\n", "  Discovering Dirac fermions with novel properties has become an important\nfront in condensed matter and materials sciences. Here, we report the\nobservation of unusual Dirac fermion states in a strongly-correlated electron\nsetting, which are uniquely distinct from those of graphene and conventional\ntopological insulators. In strongly-correlated cerium monopnictides, we find\ntwo sets of highly anisotropic Dirac fermions that interpenetrate each other\nwith negligible hybridization, and show a peculiar four-fold degeneracy where\ntheir Dirac nodes overlap. Despite the lack of protection by crystalline or\ntime-reversal symmetries, this four-fold degeneracy is robust across magnetic\nphase transitions. Comparison of these experimental findings with our\ntheoretical calculations suggests that the observed surface Dirac fermions\narise from bulk band inversions at an odd number of high-symmetry points, which\nis analogous to the band topology which describes a\n$\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-topological phase. Our findings open up an unprecedented and\nlong-sought-for platform for exploring novel Dirac fermion physics in a\nstrongly-correlated semimetal.\n"]}
