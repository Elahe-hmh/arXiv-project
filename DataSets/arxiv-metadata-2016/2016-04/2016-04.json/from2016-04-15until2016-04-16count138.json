The minimal perturbation of\nassociativity is characterized by the first- order partial differential\nequations, which in a natural way generalize the Lie and Maurer-Cartan\nequations from the theory of Lie groups.\n", "  We calculate the pion and kaon electromagnetic form factors in finite volume\nfor a generic momentum transfer in space-like region, using SU(3) chiral\nperturbation theory. To this end, we first find the hadronic matrix element in\na new form which is suitable for our calculation in finite volume. We present\nour numerical findings for the chiral behavior and finite volume corrections\nand compare these for pion and kaon form factors. As a result, for the pion\nelectromagnetic form factor we find the finite volume correction $\\Delta\nF^{\\pi}_{em} = 0.0041$ at momentum transfer $q^2 = -0.1358$ and for the kaon\nform factor $\\Delta F^{K}_{em} = 0.0029$ at $q^2 = -0.1357$ with $m_{\\pi} =\n0.3128$ and $L = 2.6 fm$ as the linear size of the lattice.\n", "  In this paper, we try to probe whether a clean CMB map obtained from the raw\nsatellite data using a cleaning procedure is sufficiently clean. Specifically\nwe study if there are any foreground residuals still present in the cleaned\ndata using a cross-correlation statistic. Residual contamination is expected to\nbe present, primarily, in the galactic plane due to the high emission from our\nown galaxy. A foreground mask is applied conventionally to avoid biases in the\nestimated quantities of interest due to foreground leakage. Here, we map\nforeground residuals, if present, in the unmasked region i.e., outside a CMB\nanalysis mask. Further locally extended foreground-contaminated regions, found\neventually, are studied to understand them better. The few contaminated regions\nthus identified may be used to slightly extend the available masks to make them\nmore stringent.\n", "  Approximate Bayes Computations (ABC) are used for parameter inference when\nthe likelihood function of the model is expensive to evaluate but relatively\ncheap to sample from. In particle ABC, an ensemble of particles in the product\nspace of model outputs and parameters is propagated in such a way that its\noutput marginal approaches a delta function at the data and its parameter\nmarginal approaches the posterior distribution. Inspired by Simulated\nAnnealing, we present a new class of particle algorithms for ABC, based on a\nsequence of Metropolis kernels, associated with a decreasing sequence of\ntolerances w.r.t. the data. Unlike other algorithms, our class of algorithms is\nnot based on importance sampling. Hence, it does not suffer from a loss of\neffective sample size due to re-sampling. We prove convergence under a\ncondition on the speed at which the tolerance is decreased. Furthermore, we\npresent a scheme that adapts the tolerance and the jump distribution in\nparameter space according to some mean-fields of the ensemble, which preserves\nthe statistical independence of the particles, in the limit of infinite sample\nsize. This adaptive scheme aims at converging as close as possible to the\ncorrect result with as few system updates as possible via minimizing the\nentropy production in the system. The performance of this new class of\nalgorithms is compared against two other recent algorithms on two toy examples.\n", "  Motivated by the advances of quantum Darwinism and recognizing the role\nplayed by redundancy in identifying the small subset of quantum states with\nresilience characteristic of objective classical reality, we explore the\nimplications of redundant records for consistent histories. The consistent\nhistories formalism is a tool for describing sequences of events taking place\nin an evolving closed quantum system. A set of histories is consistent when one\ncan reason about them using Boolean logic, i.e., when probabilities of\nsequences of events that define histories are additive. However, the vast\nmajority of the sets of histories that are merely consistent are flagrantly\nnon-classical in other respects. This embarras de richesses (known as the set\nselection problem) suggests that one must go beyond consistency to identify how\nthe classical past arises in our quantum Universe. The key intuition we follow\nis that the records of events that define the familiar objective past are\ninscribed in many distinct systems, e.g., subsystems of the environment, and\nare accessible locally in space and time to observers. We identify histories\nthat are not just consistent but redundantly consistent using the partial-trace\ncondition introduced by Finkelstein as a bridge between histories and\ndecoherence. The existence of redundant records is a sufficient condition for\nredundant consistency. It selects, from the multitude of the alternative sets\nof consistent histories, a small subset endowed with redundant records\ncharacteristic of the objective classical past. The information about an\nobjective history of the past is then simultaneously within reach of many, who\ncan independently reconstruct it and arrive at compatible conclusions in the\npresent.\n", "  In the present work we suggest a non-local generalization of quantum theory\nwhich include quantum theory as a particular case. On the basis of the idea,\nthat Planck constant is an adiabatic invariant of the free/coupled\nelectromagnetic field, we calculate the value of Plank constant from first\nprinciples, namely from the geometry of our Universe. The basic nature of the\nquantum theory is discussed. The nature of the dark energy is revealed.\n", "  The goal of this note is to show that the Riemann-Hilbert problem to find\nmultivalued analytic functions with $SL(2,\\mathbb{C})$-valued monodromy on\nRiemann surfaces of genus zero with $n$ punctures can be solved by taking\nsuitable linear combinations of the conformal blocks of Liouville theory at\n$c=1$. This implies a similar representation for the isomonodromic\ntau-function. In the case $n=4$ we thereby get a proof of the relation between\ntau-functions and conformal blocks discovered in \\cite{GIL}. We briefly discuss\na possible application of our results to the study of relations between certain\n$\\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories and conformal field theory.\n", "  The short-distance expansion of the tau function of the radial\nsine-Gordon/Painlev\\'e III equation is given by a convergent series which\ninvolves irregular $c=1$ conformal blocks and possesses certain periodicity\nproperties with respect to monodromy data. The long-distance irregular\nexpansion exhibits a similar periodicity with respect to a different pair of\ncoordinates on the monodromy manifold. This observation is used to conjecture\nan exact expression for the connection constant providing relative\nnormalization of the two series. Up to an elementary prefactor, it is given by\nthe generating function of the canonical transformation between the two sets of\ncoordinates.\n", "  We consider self-adjoint realizations of a second-order elliptic differential\nexpression on ${\\mathbb R}^n$ with singular interactions of $\\delta$ and\n$\\delta^\\prime$-type supported on a compact closed smooth hypersurface in\n${\\mathbb R}^n$. In our main results we prove spectral asymptotics formulae\nwith refined remainder estimates for the singular values of the resolvent\ndifference between the standard self-adjoint realizations and the operators\nwith a $\\delta$ and $\\delta^\\prime$-interaction, respectively. Our technique\nmakes use of general pseudodifferential methods, classical results on spectral\nasymptotics of $\\psi$do's on closed manifolds and Krein-type resolvent\nformulae.\n", "  A major challenge in next-generation industrial applications is to improve\nnumerical analysis by quantifying uncertainties in predictions. In this work we\npresent a formulation of a fully nonlinear and dispersive potential flow water\nwave model with random inputs for the probabilistic description of the\nevolution of waves. The model is analyzed using random sampling techniques and\nnon-intrusive methods based on generalized Polynomial Chaos (PC). These methods\nallow to accurately and efficiently estimate the probability distribution of\nthe solution and require only the computation of the solution in different\npoints in the parameter space, allowing for the reuse of existing simulation\nsoftware. The choice of the applied methods is driven by the number of\nuncertain input parameters and by the fact that finding the solution of the\nconsidered model is computationally intensive. We revisit experimental\nbenchmarks often used for validation of deterministic water wave models. Based\non numerical experiments and assumed uncertainties in boundary data, our\nanalysis reveals that some of the known discrepancies from deterministic\nsimulation in comparison with experimental measurements could be partially\nexplained by the variability in the model input. We finally present a synthetic\nexperiment studying the variance based sensitivity of the wave load on an\noff-shore structure to a number of input uncertainties. In the numerical\nexamples presented the PC methods have exhibited fast convergence, suggesting\nthat the problem is amenable to being analyzed with such methods.\n", "  In this paper we consider the problem of generating arbitrary three-party\ncorrelations from a combination of public and secret correlations. Two parties\n-- called Alice and Bob -- share perfectly correlated bits that are secret from\na collaborating third party, Charlie. At the same time, all three parties have\naccess to a separate source of correlated bits, and their goal is to convert\nthese two resources into multiple copies of some given tripartite distribution\n$P_{XYZ}$. We obtain a single-letter characterization of the trade-off between\npublic and private bits that are needed to achieve this task. The rate of\nprivate bits is shown to generalize Wyner's classic notion of common\ninformation held between a pair of random variables. The problem we consider is\nalso closely related to the task of secrecy formation in which $P_{XYZ}$ is\ngenerated using public communication and local randomness but with Charlie\nfunctioning as an adversary instead of a collaborator. We describe in detail\nthe differences between the collaborative and adversarial scenarios.\n", "  We review in detail recent advances in our understanding of the phase\nstructure and the phase transitions of hadronic matter in strong magnetic\nfields $B$ and zero quark chemical potentials $\\mu_f$. Many aspects of QCD are\ndescribed using low-energy effective theories and models such as the MIT bag\nmodel, the hadron resonance gas model, chiral perturbation theory, the\nNambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model, the quark-meson (QM) model and Polyakov-loop\nextended versions of the NJL and QM models. We critically examine their\nproperties and applications. This includes mean-field calculations as well as\napproaches beyond the mean-field approximation such as the functional\nrenormalization group (FRG). Renormalization issues are discussed and the\ninfluence of the vacuum fluctuations on the chiral phase transition is pointed\nout. Magnetic catalysis at $T=0$ is covered as well. We discuss recent lattice\nresults for the thermodynamics of nonabelian gauge theories with emphasis on\n$SU(2)_c$ and $SU(3)_c$. In particular, we focus on inverse magnetic catalysis\naround the transition temperature $T_c$ as a competition between contributions\nfrom valence quarks and sea quarks resulting in a decrease of $T_c$ as a\nfunction of $B$. Finally, we discuss recent efforts to modify models in order\nto reproduce the behavior observed on the lattice.\n", "  In this article we propose some Maple procedures, for teaching purposes, to\nstudy the basics of General Relativity (GR) and Cosmology. After presenting\nsome features of GRTensorII, a package specially built to deal with GR, we give\ntwo examples of how one can use these procedures. In the first example we build\nthe Schwarzschild solution of Einstein equations, while in the second one we\nstudy some simple cosmological models.\n", "  In this paper, we study a big bounce universe typified by a non-singular big\nbounce, as opposed to a singular big bang. This cosmological model can describe\nradiation dominated early universe and matter dominated late universe in FRW\nmodel. The connections between thermodynamics and gravity are observed here. In\nthe early stage of both cold and hot universes, we find there is only one\ngeometry containing a 4D de Sitter universe with a general state parameter. We\nalso find the form of the apparent horizon in the early universe strongly\ndepends on the extra dimension, which suggests that the influence of the extra\ndimension could in principle be found in the early universe. Moreover, we show\nthat in the late stages of both cold and hot universes, the moment when the\napparent horizon begins to bounce keeps essentially in step with the behavior\nof the cosmological scalar factor.\n", "  We use the cosmo-OWLS suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, which\nincludes different galactic feedback models, to predict the cross-correlation\nsignal between weak gravitational lensing and the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich\n(tSZ) $y$-parameter. The predictions are compared to the recent detection\nreported by van Waerbeke and collaborators. The simulations reproduce the weak\nlensing-tSZ cross-correlation, $\\xi_{y\\kappa}(\\theta)$, well. The uncertainty\narising from different possible feedback models appears to be important on\nsmall scales only ($\\theta \\lesssim 10$ arcmin), while the amplitude of the\ncorrelation on all scales is sensitive to cosmological parameters that control\nthe growth rate of structure (such as $\\sigma_8$, $\\Omega_m$ and $\\Omega_b$).\nThis study confirms our previous claim (in Ma et al.) that a significant\nproportion of the signal originates from the diffuse gas component in low-mass\n($M_{\\rm{halo}} \\lesssim 10^{14} M_{\\odot}$) clusters as well as from the\nregion beyond the virial radius. We estimate that approximately 20$\\%$ of the\ndetected signal comes from low-mass clusters, which corresponds to about 30$\\%$\nof the baryon density of the Universe. The simulations also suggest that more\nthan half of the baryons in the Universe are in the form of diffuse gas outside\nhalos ($\\gtrsim 5$ times the virial radius) which is not hot or dense enough to\nproduce a significant tSZ signal or be observed by X-ray experiments. Finally,\nwe show that future high-resolution tSZ-lensing cross-correlation observations\nwill serve as a powerful tool for discriminating between different galactic\nfeedback models.\n", "  We consider the estimation of a common period for a set of functions sampled\nat irregular intervals. The problem arises in astronomy, where the functions\nrepresent a star's brightness observed over time through different photometric\nfilters. While current methods can estimate periods accurately provided that\nthe brightness is well--sampled in at least one filter, there are no existing\nmethods that can provide accurate estimates when no brightness function is\nwell--sampled. In this paper we introduce two new methods for period estimation\nwhen brightnesses are poorly--sampled in all filters. The first, multiband\ngeneralized Lomb-Scargle (MGLS), extends the frequently used Lomb-Scargle\nmethod in a way that na\\\"{i}vely combines information across filters. The\nsecond, penalized generalized Lomb-Scargle (PGLS), builds on the first by more\nintelligently borrowing strength across filters. Specifically, we incorporate\nconstraints on the phases and amplitudes across the different functions using a\nnon--convex penalized likelihood function. We develop a fast algorithm to\noptimize the penalized likelihood by combining block coordinate descent with\nthe majorization-minimization (MM) principle. We illustrate our methods on\nsynthetic and real astronomy data. Both advance the state-of-the-art in period\nestimation; however, PGLS significantly outperforms MGLS when all functions are\nextremely poorly--sampled.\n", "  In Effective Field Theories (EFTs) with higher-dimensional operators many\nanomalous dimensions vanish at the one-loop level for no apparent reason. With\nthe use of supersymmetry, and a classification of the operators according to\ntheir embedding in super-operators, we are able to show why many of these\nanomalous dimensions are zero. The key observation is that one-loop\ncontributions from superpartners trivially vanish in many cases under\nconsideration, making supersymmetry a powerful tool even for non-supersymmetric\nmodels. We show this in detail in a simple U(1) model with a scalar and\nfermions, and explain how to extend this to SM EFTs and the QCD Chiral\nLangrangian. This provides an understanding of why most \"current-current\"\noperators do not renormalize \"loop\" operators at the one-loop level, and allows\nto find the few exceptions to this ubiquitous rule.\n", "  An astonishingly simple analytical frequency approximation formula for a\nclass of strongly nonlinear oscillators is derived and applied to various\nexample systems yielding useful quick estimates.\n", "  The planetary exospheres are poorly known in their outer parts, since the\nneutral densities are low compared with the instruments detection capabilities.\nThe exospheric models are thus often the main source of information at such\nhigh altitudes. We present a new way to take into account analytically the\nadditional effect of the radiation pressure on planetary exospheres. In a\nseries of papers, we present with an Hamiltonian approach the effect of the\nradiation pressure on dynamical trajectories, density profiles and escaping\nthermal flux. Our work is a generalization of the study by Bishop and\nChamberlain (1989). In this first paper, we present the complete exact\nsolutions of particles trajectories, which are not conics, under the influence\nof the solar radiation pressure. This problem was recently partly solved by\nLantoine and Russell (2011) and completely by Biscani and Izzo (2014). We give\nhere the full set of solutions, including solutions not previously derived, as\nwell as simpler formulations for previously known cases and comparisons with\nrecent works. The solutions given may also be applied to the classical Stark\nproblem (Stark,1914): we thus provide here for the first time the complete set\nof solutions for this well-known effect in term of Jacobi elliptic functions.\n", "  In metal nanoparticles (NPs) supracrystals, the metallic core provides some\nkey properties, e.g. magnetization, plasmonic response or conductivity, with\nthe ligand molecules giving rise to others like solubility, assembly or\ninteraction with biomolecules. The formation of these supracrystals depends on\na complex interplay between many forces, some stemming from the core, some from\nthe ligands. At present, there is no known approach to characterize the local\norder of ligand molecules or their dynamics with atomic spatial resolution.\nHere, we develop a methodology based on small-angle ultrafast electron\ndiffraction combined with angular cross-correlation analysis to characterize a\ntwo-dimensional supracrystal of dodecanethiol-coated gold NPs. We retrieve the\nstatic arrangement of the ligands, showing that at equilibrium they order in a\npreferential orientation on the NPs surface and throughout the two-dimensional\nsupracrystal. Upon light excitation, positional disorder is induced in the\nsupracrystal, while its overall homogeneity is surprisingly found to\ntransiently increase. This suggests that transient annealing of the\nsupracrystal takes place within few picoseconds (ps). This methodology will\nenable the systematic investigation of the dynamical structural properties of\nnano-assembled materials containing light elements, relevant for biological\napplications.\n", "  The planetary exospheres are poorly known in their outer parts, since the\nneutral densities are low compared with the instruments detection capabilities.\nThe exospheric models are thus often the main source of information at such\nhigh altitudes. We present a new way to take into account analytically the\nadditional effect of the radiation pressure on planetary exospheres. In a\nseries of papers, we present with an Hamiltonian approach the effect of the\nradiation pressure on dynamical trajectories, density profiles and escaping\nthermal flux. Our work is a generalization of the study by Bishop and\nChamberlain (1989). In this second part of our work, we present here the\ndensity profiles of atomic Hydrogen in planetary exospheres subject to the\nradiation pressure. We first provide the altitude profiles of ballistic\nparticles (the dominant exospheric population in most cases), which exhibit\nstrong asymmetries that explain the known geotail phenomenon at Earth. The\nradiation pressure strongly enhances the densities compared with the pure\ngravity case (i.e. the Chamberlain profiles), in particular at noon and\nmidnight. We finally show the existence of an exopause that appears naturally\nas the external limit for bounded particles, above which all particles are\nescaping.\n", "  We explore the possibility of the acoustic analogue of a super-radiance like\nphenomenon, i.e., the amplification of a sound wave by reflection from the\nergo-region of a rotating acoustic black hole in the fluid draining bathtub\nmodel in the presence of the pressure be amplified or reduced in agreement with\nthe value of the parameter $\\left(\\gamma=1+ \\frac{kn\\rho_0^{n-1}\n}{c^2}\\right)$. We remark that the interval of frequencies depend upon the\nneo-newtonian parameter $\\gamma$\\, ($\\bar{\\Omega}_H = \\frac{2\n}{1+\\gamma}\\;\\Omega_{H}$)\\textbf{ and becomes narrow in this work}. As a\nconsequence, the tuning of the neo-newtonian parameter $\\left(\\gamma=1+\n\\frac{kn\\rho_0^{n-1} }{c^2}\\right)$ changes the rate of loss of the acoustic\nblack hole mass.\n", "  Achieving a high intensity in inelastic scanning tunneling spectroscopy\n(IETS) is important for precise measurements. The intensity of the IETS signal\ncan vary up to a factor three for various tips without an apparent reason\naccessible by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) alone. Here, we show that\ncombining STM and IETS with atomic force microscopy enables carbon monoxide\nfront atom identification, revealing that high IETS intensities for CO/Cu(111)\nare obtained for single atom tips, while the intensity drops sharply for\nmulti-atom tips. Adsorbing the CO molecule on a Cu adatom [CO/Cu/Cu(111)] such\nthat it is elevated over the substrate strongly diminishes the tip dependence\nof IETS intensity, showing that an elevated position channels most of the\ntunneling current through the CO molecule even for multi-atom tips, while a\nlarge fraction of the tunneling current bypasses the CO molecule in the case of\nCO/Cu(111).\n", "  Transient black hole candidates are interesting objects to study in X-rays as\nthese sources show rapid evolutions in their spectral and temporal properties.\nIn this paper, we study the spectral properties of the Galactic transient X-ray\nbinary MAXI~J1659-152 during its very first outburst after discovery with the\narchival data of RXTE Proportional Counter Array instruments. We make a\ndetailed study of the evolution of accretion flow dynamics during its 2010\noutburst through spectral analysis using the Chakrabarti-Titarchuk\ntwo-component advective flow (TCAF) model as an additive table model in XSPEC.\nAccretion flow parameters (Keplerian disk and sub-Keplerian halo rates, shock\nlocation and shock strength) are extracted from our spectral fits with TCAF. We\nstudied variations of these fit parameters during the entire outburst as it\npassed through three spectral classes: hard, hard-intermediate, and\nsoft-intermediate. We compared our TCAF fitted results with standard combined\ndisk black body (DBB) and power-law (PL) model fitted results and found that\nvariations of disk rate with DBB flux and halo rate with PL flux are generally\nsimilar in nature. There appears to be an absence of the soft state unlike what\nis seen in other similar sources.\n", "  We propose an unconventional scheme of photoluminescence in a semiconductor\nthin film, where the nonlocal correlation between an excitonic wave and a light\nwave prominently enhances the exciton-light coupling beyond the long-wavelength\napproximation (the so-called excitonic superradiance regime). On the basis of\nthe developed method extending input-output theory, we elucidate atypical\nphotoluminescence effects due to the strong wave-wave correlation. In\nparticular, the up-converted photoluminescence based on the coherent\nsuperposition of excitons is found to be highly efficient, i.e., it can be\nrealized by weak pumping without auxiliary systems such as cavities or photonic\nantennas.\n", "  Globally disruptive events include asteroid/comet impacts, large igneous\nprovinces and glaciations, all of which have been considered as contributors to\nmass extinctions. Understanding the overall relationship between the timings of\nthe largest extinctions and their potential proximal causes remains one of\nscience's great unsolved mysteries. Cycles of about 60 million years in both\nfossil diversity and environmental data suggest external drivers such as the\npassage of the Solar System through the galactic plane. While cyclic phenomena\nare recognised statistically, a lack of coherent mechanisms and a failure to\nlink key events has hampered wider acceptance of multi-million year periodicity\nand its relevance to earth science and evolution. The generation of a robust\npredictive model of timings, with a clear plausible primary mechanism, would\nsignal a paradigm shift. Here, we present a model of the timings of globally\ndisruptive events and a possible explanation of their ultimate cause. The\nproposed model is a symmetrical pattern of 63 million-year sequences around a\ncentral value, interpreted as the occurrence of events along, and parallel to,\nthe galactic midplane. The symmetry is consistent with multiple dark matter\ndisks, aligned parallel to the midplane. One implication of the precise pattern\nof timings and the underlying physical model is the ability to predict future\nevents, such as a major extinction in one to two million years.\n", "  We study the charmonium $p \\bar{p} \\to \\psi(3770) \\pi^0$ reaction using\neffective lagrangian approach where the contributions from well established\n$N^*$ states are considered, and all parameters are fixed in the process of\n$e^+e^- \\to p \\bar{p}\\pi^0$ at center of mass energy $\\sqrt{s} = 3.773$ GeV.\nThe experimental data on the line shape of the mass distribution of the $e^+e^-\n\\to p\\bar{p}\\pi^0$ can be well reproduced. Based on the studying of $e^+e^- \\to\np \\bar{p}\\pi^0$, the total and differential cross sections of the $p \\bar{p}\n\\to \\psi(3770) \\pi^0$ reaction are predicted. At the same time we evaluated\nalso the cross sections of the $p \\bar{p} \\to \\psi(3686) \\pi^0$ reaction. It is\nshown that the contribution of nucleon pole to this reaction is largest close\nto the reaction threshold. However, the interference between nucleon pole and\nthe other nucleon resonance can still change the angle distributions\nsignificantly. Those theoretical results may be test by the future experiments\nat $\\overline{\\mbox{P}}$ANDA.\n", "  We study the probability distribution function (PDF) of the smallest\neigenvalue of Laguerre-Wishart matrices $W = X^\\dagger X$ where $X$ is a random\n$M \\times N$ ($M \\geq N$) matrix, with complex Gaussian independent entries. We\ncompute this PDF in terms of semi-classical orthogonal polynomials, which are\ndeformations of Laguerre polynomials. By analyzing these polynomials, and their\nassociated recurrence relations, in the limit of large $N$, large $M$ with $M/N\n\\to 1$ -- i.e. for quasi-square large matrices $X$ -- we show that this PDF, in\nthe hard edge limit, can be expressed in terms of the solution of a Painlev\\'e\nIII equation, as found by Tracy and Widom, using Fredholm operators techniques.\nFurthermore, our method allows us to compute explicitly the first $1/N$\ncorrections to this limiting distribution at the hard edge. Our computations\nconfirm a recent conjecture by Edelman, Guionnet and P\\'ech\\'e. We also study\nthe soft edge limit, when $M-N \\sim {\\cal O}(N)$, for which we conjecture the\nform of the first correction to the limiting distribution of the smallest\neigenvalue.\n", "  We perform extensive Monte Carlo simulations of a two-dimensional bent\nhard-needle model in both its chiral zig-zag and its achiral bow-shape\nconfigurations and present their phase diagrams. We find evidence for a variety\nof stable phases: isotropic, quasi-nematic, smectic-C, anti-ferromorphic\nsmectic-A, and modulated-nematic. This last phase consists of layers formed by\nsupramolecular arches. They create a periodic modulation of the molecular\npolarity whose period is sensitively controlled by molecular geometry. We\nidentify transition densities using correlation functions together with\nappropriately defined order parameters and compare them with predictions from\nOnsager theory. The contribution of the molecular excluded area to deviations\nfrom Onsager theory and simple liquid crystal phase morphology is discussed. We\ndemonstrate the isotropic--quasi-nematic transition to be consistent with a\nKosterlitz-Thouless disclination unbinding scenario.\n", "  Comparative analyses of protein-protein interaction networks play important\nroles in the understanding of biological processes. However, the growing\nenormity of available data on the networks becomes a computational challenge\nfor the conventional alignment algorithms. Quantum algorithms generally provide\ngreater efficiency over their classical counterparts in solving various\nproblems.\n  One of such algorithms is the quantum phase estimation algorithm which\ngenerates the principal eigenvector of a stochastic matrix with probability\none.\n  Using the quantum phase estimation algorithm, we introduce a quantum\ncomputing approach for the alignment of protein-protein interaction networks by\nfollowing the classical algorithm IsoRank which uses the principal eigenvector\nof the stochastic matrix representing the Kronecker product of the normalized\nadjacency matrices of networks for the pairwise alignment. We also present a\ngreedy quantum measurement scheme to efficiently procure the alignment from the\noutput state of the phase estimation algorithm where the eigenvector is encoded\nas the amplitudes of this state. The complexity of the quantum approach\noutperforms the classical running time.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate various $f(R)$-brane models and compare their\ngravitational resonance structures with the corresponding general relativity\n(GR)-branes. {Starting from some known GR-brane solutions}, we derive thick\n$f(R)$-brane solutions such that the metric, scalar field, and scalar potential\ncoincide with those of the corresponding GR-branes. {We find that for branes\ngenerated by a single or several canonical scalar fields, there is no obvious\ndistinction between the GR-branes and corresponding $f(R)$-branes in terms of\ngravitational resonance structure.} Then we discuss the branes generated by\nK-fields. In this case, there could exist huge differences between GR-branes\nand $f(R)$-branes.\n", "  We study the nondegenerate optical parametric oscillator in a planar\ninterferometer near threshold, where critical phenomena are expected. These\nphenomena are associated with nonequilibrium quantum dynamics that are known to\nlead to quadrature entanglement and squeezing in the oscillator field modes. We\nobtain a universal form for the equation describing this system, which allows a\ncomparison with other phase transitions. We find that the unsqueezed\nquadratures of this system correspond to a two-dimensional XY-type model with a\ntricritical Lifshitz point. This leaves open the possibility of a controlled\nexperimental investigation into this unusual class of statistical models. We\nevaluate the correlations of the unsqueezed quadrature using both an exact\nnumerical simulation and a Gaussian approximation, and obtain an accurate\nnumerical calculation of the non-Gaussian correlations.\n", "  The positions and velocities of galaxies in the Local Group (LG) measure the\ngravitational field within it. This is mostly due to the Milky Way (MW) and\nAndromeda (M31). We constrain their masses using distance and radial velocity\n(RV) measurements of 32 LG galaxies. To do this, we follow the trajectories of\nmany simulated particles starting on a pure Hubble flow at redshift 9. For each\nobserved galaxy, we obtain a trajectory which today is at the same position.\nIts final velocity is the model prediction for the velocity of that galaxy.\n  Unlike previous simulations based on spherical symmetry, ours are\naxisymmetric and include gravity from Centaurus A. We find the total LG mass is\n${4.33^{+0.37}_{-0.32}\\times{10}^{12}M_\\odot}$, with $0.14 \\pm 0.07$ of this\nbeing in the MW. We approximately account for IC 342, M81, the Great Attractor\nand the Large Magellanic Cloud.\n  No plausible set of initial conditions yields a good match to the RVs of our\nsample of LG galaxies. Observed RVs systematically exceed those predicted by\nthe best-fitting $\\Lambda$CDM model, with a typical disagreement of\n${45.1^{+7.0}_{-5.7}}$ km/s and a maximum of ${110 \\pm 13}$ km/s for DDO 99.\nInteractions between LG dwarf galaxies can't easily explain this.\n  One possibility is a past close flyby of the MW and M31. This arises in some\nmodified gravity theories but not in $\\Lambda$CDM. Gravitational slingshot\nencounters of material in the LG with either of these massive fast-moving\ngalaxies could plausibly explain why some non-satellite LG galaxies are moving\naway from us even faster than a pure Hubble flow.\n", "  We first show that the currently accepted statistical mechanics for granular\nmatter is flawed. The reason is that it is based on the volume function, which\ndepends only on a minute fraction of all the structural degrees of freedom and\nis unaffected by most of the configurational microstates. Consequently, the\ncommonly used partition function underestimates the entropy severely. We then\npropose a new formulation, replacing the volume function with a ${\\it\nconnectivity}$ function that depends on all the structural degrees of freedom\nand accounts correctly for the entire entropy. We discuss the advantages of the\nnew formalism and derive explicit results for two- and three-dimensional\nsystems. We test the formalism by calculating the entropy of an experimental\ntwo-dimensional system, as a function of system size, and showing that it is an\nextensive variable.\n", "  Can robustness against experimental imperfections and noise be embedded into\na quantum simulation? In this paper, we report on a special case in which this\nis possible. A spin chain can be engineered such that, in the absence of\nimperfections and noise, an unknown quantum state is transported from one end\nof the chain to the other, due only to the intrinsic dynamics of the system. We\nshow that an encoding into a standard error correcting code (a\nCalderbank-Shor-Steane code) can be embedded into this simulation task such\nthat a modified error correction procedure on read-out can recover from\nsufficiently low rates of noise during transport.\n", "  GaAs/AlGaAs quantum dots grown by in-situ droplet etching and nanohole\ninfilling offer a combination of strong charge confinement, optical efficiency,\nand spatial symmetry required for polarization entanglement and spin-photon\ninterface. Here we study spin properties of such dots. We find nearly vanishing\nelectron $g$-factor ($g_e<0.05$), providing a route for electrically driven\nspin control schemes. Optical manipulation of the nuclear spin environment is\ndemonstrated with nuclear spin polarization up to $60\\%$ achieved. NMR\nspectroscopy reveals the structure of two types of quantum dots and yields the\nsmall magnitude of residual strain $\\epsilon_b<0.02\\%$ which nevertheless leads\nto long nuclear spin lifetimes exceeding 1000 s. The stability of the nuclear\nspin environment is advantageous for applications in quantum information\nprocessing.\n", "  A new class of deterministic dynamical systems, termed semipredictable\ndynamical systems, is presented. The spatiotemporal evolution of these systems\nhave both predictable and unpredictable traits, as found in natural complex\nsystems. We prove a general result: The dynamics of any deterministic nonlinear\ncellular automaton (CA) with $p$ possible dynamical states can be decomposed at\neach instant of time in a superposition of $N$ layers involving $p_{0}$,\n$p_{1}$,... $p_{N-1}$ dynamical states each, where the $p_{k\\in \\mathbb{N}}$,\n$k \\in [0, N-1]$ are divisors of $p$. If the divisors coincide with the prime\nfactors of $p$ this decomposition is unique. Conversely, we also prove that $N$\nCA working on symbols $p_{0}$, $p_{1}$,... $p_{N-1}$ can be composed to create\na graded CA rule with $N$ different layers. We then show that, even when the\nfull spatiotemporal evolution can be unpredictable, certain traits (layers) can\nexactly be predicted. We present explicit examples of such systems involving\ncompositions of Wolfram's 256 elementary CA and a more complex CA rule acting\non a neighborhood of two sites and 12 symbols and whose rule table corresponds\nto the smallest Moufang loop $M_{12}(S_{3},2)$.\n", "  The frequency ratios $r_{01}$ and $r_{10}$ of KIC 11081729 decrease firstly\nand then increase with the increase in frequency. For different spectroscopic\nconstraints, all models with overshooting parameter $\\delta_{\\mathrm{ov}}$ less\nthan 1.7 can not reproduce the distributions of the ratios. However, the\ndistributions of the ratios can be directly reproduced by models with\n$\\delta_{\\mathrm{ov}}$ in the range of about $1.7-1.8$. The estimations of mass\nand age of the star can be affected by spectroscopic results, but the\ndetermination of the $\\delta_{\\mathrm{ov}}$ is not dependent on the\nspectroscopic results. A large overshooting of convective core may exist in KIC\n11081729. The characteristics of $r_{01}$ and $r_{10}$ of KIC 11081729 may\nresult from the effects of the large overshooting of convective core. The\ndistributions of $r_{01}$ and $r_{10}$ of different stars with a convective\ncore can be reproduced by the function $B(\\nu_{n,1})$. If the value of the\ncritical frequency $\\nu_{0}$ is larger than the value of frequency of maximum\noscillation power $\\nu_{max}$, a star may have a small convective core and\n$\\delta_{\\rm ov}$. But if the value of $\\nu_{0}$ is less than that of\n$\\nu_{max}$, the star may have a large convective core and\n$\\delta_{\\mathrm{ov}}$. The function aids in determining the presence of\nconvective core and the size of the convective core including overshooting\nregion from observed frequencies. The determination is not dependent on the\ncalculation of stellar models.\n", "  We consider the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations with periodic\nboundary conditions and time-independent forcing. For this type of flow, we\nderive adjoint equations whose trajectories converge asymptotically to the\nequilibrium and traveling wave solutions of the Navier--Stokes equations. Using\nthe adjoint equations, arbitrary initial conditions evolve to the vicinity of a\n(relative) equilibrium at which point a few Newton-type iterations yield the\ndesired (relative) equilibrium solution. We apply this adjoint-based method to\na chaotic two-dimensional Kolmogorov flow. A convergence rate of 100% is\nobserved, leading to the discovery of 21 new steady state and traveling wave\nsolutions at Reynolds number Re=40. Some of the new invariant solutions have\nspatially localized structures that were previously believed to only exist on\ndomains with large aspect ratios. We show that one of the newly found steady\nstate solutions underpins the temporal intermittencies, i.e., high energy\ndissipation episodes of the flow. More precisely, it is shown that each\nintermittent episode of a generic turbulent trajectory corresponds to its close\npassage to this equilibrium solution.\n", "  We consider a one-dimensional continuous time random walk (CTRW) on a fixed\ntime interval $T$ where at each time step the walker waits a random time\n$\\tau$, before performing a jump drawn from a symmetric continuous probability\ndistribution function (PDF) $f(\\eta)$, of L\\'evy index $0 < \\mu \\leq 2$. Our\nstudy includes the case where the waiting time PDF $\\Psi(\\tau)$ has a power law\ntail, $\\Psi(\\tau) \\propto \\tau^{-1 - \\gamma}$, with $0< \\gamma < 1$, such that\nthe average time between two consecutive jumps is infinite. The random motion\nis sub-diffusive if $\\gamma < \\mu/2$ (and super-diffusive if $\\gamma > \\mu/2$).\nWe investigate the joint PDF of the gap $g$ between the first two highest\npositions of the CTRW and the time $t$ separating these two maxima. We show\nthat this PDF reaches a stationary limiting joint distribution $p(g,t)$ in the\nlimit of long CTRW, $T \\to \\infty$. Our exact analytical results show a very\nrich behavior of this joint PDF in the $(\\gamma, \\mu)$ plane, which we study in\ngreat detail. Our main results are verified by numerical simulations. This work\nprovides a non trivial extension to CTRWs of the recent study in the discrete\ntime setting by Majumdar et al. (J. Stat. Mech. P09013, 2014).\n", "  In this paper we are discussing the problem of low-energy greybody factors\nfor fermions emitted by a Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole. In our study we\nare using the analytical methods proposed by Unruh some time ago for\ndetermining the greybody factors. We have found that at low energies the\ngreybody factors are constant for a given total angular momentum (similar to\nwhat happens in the case of scalar particles reported before in the\nliterature). Also our results are indicating an enhancement in the energy\nspectrum if one is increasing the value of the cosmological constant. These\nresults are consistent with numerical calculations performed in Ref.[14] by\nS.F. Wu et al. (Phys.Rev.D 78, 084010).\n", "  We investigate a possibility to generate non-classical states in light-matter\ncoupled noisy quantum systems, namely the anisotropic Rabi and Dicke models. In\nthese hybrid quantum systems a competing influence of coherent internal\ndynamics and environment induced dissipation drives the system into\nnon-equilibrium steady states (NESSs). Explicitly, for the anisotropic Rabi\nmodel the steady state is given by an incoherent mixture of two states of\nopposite parities, but as each parity state displays light-matter entanglement\nwe also find that the full state is entangled. Furthermore, as a natural\nextension of the anisotropic Rabi model to an infinite spin subsystem, we next\nexplored the NESS of the anisotropic Dicke model. The NESS of this linearized\nDicke model is also an inseparable state of light and matter. With an aim to\nenrich the dynamics beyond the sustainable entanglement found for the NESS of\nthese hybrid quantum systems, we also propose to combine an all-optical\nfeedback strategy for quantum state protection and for establishing quantum\ncontrol in these systems. Our present work further elucidates the relevance of\nsuch hybrid open quantum systems for potential applications in quantum\narchitectures.\n", "  A new set of measurements of the top quark mass are presented, based on the\nproton-proton data recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV\ncorresponding to a luminosity of 19.7 inverse femtobarns. The top quark mass is\nmeasured using the lepton + jets, all-jets and dilepton decay channels, giving\nvalues of 172.35 +/- 0.16 (stat) +/- 0.48 (syst) GeV, 172.32 +/- 0.25 (stat)\n+/- 0.59 (syst) GeV, and 172.82 +/- 0.19 (stat) +/- 1.22 (syst) GeV,\nrespectively. When combined with the published CMS results at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV,\nthey provide a top quark mass measurement of 172.44 +/- 0.13 (stat) +/- 0.47\n(syst) GeV. The top quark mass is also studied as a function of the event\nkinematical properties in the lepton + jets decay channel. No indications of a\nkinematic bias are observed and the collision data are consistent with a range\nof predictions from current theoretical models of t t-bar production.\n", "  We study black hole candidate (BHC) MAXI~J1836-194 during its 2011 outburst\nwith Two Component Advective Flow (TCAF) model using RXTE/PCU2 data in\n$2.5-25$~keV band. From spectral fit, accretion flow parameters such as\nKeplerian disk rate ($\\dot{m_d}$), sub-Keplerian halo rate ($\\dot{m_h}$), shock\nlocation ($X_{s}$) and compression ratio (R) are extracted directly. During the\nentire phase of the outburst, quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are observed\nsporadically. From the nature of the variation of accretion rate ratio\n(ARR=$\\dot{m_h}$ / $\\dot{m_d}$) and QPOs, entire period of the outburst is\nclassified in two spectral states, such as, hard (HS), hard-intermediate\n(HIMS). Unlike other transient BHCs, no signature of soft (SS) and\nsoft-intermediate (SIMS) spectral states are observed during entire phase of\nthe outburst\n", "  Liquid argon is a bright scintillator with potent particle identification\nproperties, making it an attractive target for direct-detection dark matter\nsearches. The DarkSide-50 dark matter search here reports the first WIMP search\nresults obtained using a target of low-radioactivity argon. DarkSide-50 is a\ndark matter detector, using two-phase liquid argon time projection chamber,\nlocated at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso. The underground argon is\nshown to contain Ar-39 at a level reduced by a factor (1.4 +- 0.2) x 10^3\nrelative to atmospheric argon. We report a background-free null result from\n(2616 +- 43) kg d of data, accumulated over 70.9 live-days. When combined with\nour previous search using an atmospheric argon, the 90 % C.L. upper limit on\nthe WIMP-nucleon spin-independent cross section based on zero events found in\nthe WIMP search regions, is 2.0 x 10^-44 cm^2 (8.6 x 10^-44 cm^2, 8.0 x 10^-43\ncm^2) for a WIMP mass of 100 GeV/c^2 (1 TeV/c^2 , 10 TeV/c^2).\n", "  We demonstrate that an undamped few-body precursor of the Higgs mode can be\ninvestigated in a harmonically trapped Fermi gas. Using exact diagonalisation,\nthe lowest monopole mode frequency is shown to depend non-monotonically on the\ninteraction strength, having a minimum in a crossover region. The minimum\ndeepens with increasing particle number, reflecting that the mode is the\nfew-body analogue of a many-body Higgs mode in the superfluid phase, which has\na vanishing frequency at the quantum phase transition point to the normal\nphase. We show that this mode mainly consists of coherent excitations of\ntime-reversed pairs, and that it can be selectively excited by modulating the\ninteraction strength, using for instance a Feshbach resonance in cold atomic\ngases.\n", "  We present angle resolved photoemission spectra for Cu(100) and Cu(111)\nsingly crystals in normal emission geometry, taken at tightly spaced intervals\nfor photon energies between 8 eV and 150 eV. This systematic collection of\nspectra gives unprecedented insight into the influence of the final states to\nthe photoemission process as well as the band structure and lifetimes of highly\nexcited electrons in Cu.\n", "  Renaturation of complementary single strands of DNA is one of the important\nprocesses that requires better understanding in the view of molecular biology\nand biological physics. Here we develop a stochastic dynamical model on the DNA\nrenaturation. According to our model there are at least three steps in the\nrenaturation process viz. incorrect-contact formation, correct-contact\nformation and nucleation, and zipping. Most of the earlier two-state models\ncombined nucleation with incorrect-contact formation step. In our model we\nsuggest that it is considerably meaningful when we combine the nucleation with\nthe zipping since nucleation is the initial step of zipping and the nucleated\nand zipping molecules are indistinguishable. Incorrect-contact formation step\nis a pure three-dimensional diffusion controlled collision process. Whereas\nnucleation involves several rounds of one-dimensional slithering dynamics of\none single strand of DNA on the other complementary strand in the process of\nsearching for the correct-contact and then initiate nucleation. Upon\nnucleation, the stochastic zipping follows to generate a fully renatured double\nstranded DNA. It seems that the square-root dependency of the overall\nrenaturation rate constant on the length of reacting single strands originates\nmainly from the geometric constraints in the diffusion controlled\nincorrect-contact formation step. Further the inverse scaling of the\nrenaturation rate on the viscosity of the reaction medium also originates from\nthe incorrect-contact formation step. On the other hand the inverse scaling of\nthe renaturation rate with the sequence complexity originates from the\nstochastic zipping which involves several rounds of crossing over the\nfree-energy barrier at microscopic levels.\n", "  We study the excited states of interacting fermions in one dimension with\nparticle-hole symmetric disorder (equivalently, random-bond XXZ chains) using a\ncombination of renormalization group methods and exact diagonalization. Absent\ninteractions, the entire many-body spectrum exhibits infinite-randomness\nquantum critical behavior with highly degenerate excited states. We show that\nthough interactions are an irrelevant perturbation in the ground state, they\ndrastically affect the structure of excited states: even arbitrarily weak\ninteractions split the degeneracies in favor of thermalization (weak disorder)\nor spontaneously broken particle-hole symmetry, driving the system into a\nmany-body localized spin glass phase (strong disorder). In both cases, the\nquantum critical properties of the non-interacting model are destroyed, either\nby thermal decoherence or spontaneous symmetry breaking. This system then has\nthe interesting and counterintuitive property that edges of the many-body\nspectrum are less localized than the center of the spectrum. We argue that our\nresults rule out the existence of certain excited state symmetry-protected\ntopological orders.\n", "  The nonequilibrium variational-cluster approach is applied to study the\nreal-time dynamics of the double occupancy in the one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard\nmodel after different fast changes of hopping parameters. A simple reference\nsystem, consisting of isolated Hubbard dimers, is used to discuss different\naspects of the numerical implementation of the approach in the general\nframework of nonequilibrium self-energy functional theory. Opposed to a direct\nsolution of the Euler equation, its time derivative is found to serve as\nnumerically tractable and stable conditional equation to fix the time-dependent\nvariational parameters.\n", "  We discuss an extension of our earlier work on the time-dependent\nLandauer--B\\\"uttiker formalism for noninteracting electronic transport. The\nformalism can without complication be extended to superconducting central\nregions since the Green's functions in the Nambu representation satisfy the\nsame equations of motion which, in turn, leads to the same closed expression\nfor the equal-time lesser Green's function, i.e., for the time-dependent\nreduced one-particle density matrix. We further write the finite-temperature\nfrequency integrals in terms of known special functions thereby considerably\nspeeding up the computation. Numerical simulations in simple normal metal --\nsuperconductor -- normal metal junctions are also presented.\n", "  We present accurate measurements of the linear, quadratic, and cubic local\nbias of dark matter halos, using curved \"separate universe\" N-body simulations\nwhich effectively incorporate an infinite-wavelength overdensity. This can be\nseen as an exact implementation of the peak-background split argument. We\ncompare the results with the linear and quadratic bias measured from the\nhalo-matter power spectrum and bispectrum, and find good agreement. On the\nother hand, the standard peak-background split applied to the Sheth & Tormen\n(1999) and Tinker et al. (2008) halo mass functions matches the measured linear\nbias parameter only at the level of 10%. The prediction from the excursion\nset-peaks approach performs much better, which can be attributed to the\nstochastic moving barrier employed in the excursion set-peaks prediction. We\nalso provide convenient fitting formulas for the nonlinear bias parameters\n$b_2(b_1)$ and $b_3(b_1)$, which work well over a range of redshifts.\n", "  We report on the magnetic properties of Eu$_{2}$Ir$_{2}$O$_{7}$ upon the\napplication of hydrostatic pressure $P$ by means of macroscopic and local-probe\ntechniques. In contrast to previously reported resistivity measurements, our dc\nmagnetization data unambiguously demonstrate a non-monotonic $P$-dependence for\n$T_{N}$, i.~e., the critical transition temperature to the magnetic phase. More\nstrikingly, we closely reproduce the recently calculated behaviour for $T_{N}$\nunder the assumption that $P$ lowers the $U/W$ ratio (i.~e., Coulomb repulsion\nenergy over electronic bandwidth). Zero-field muon-spin spectroscopy\nmeasurements confirm that the local magnetic configuration is only weakly\nperturbed by low $P$ values, in agreement with theoretical predictions. The\ncurrent results experimentally support the preservation of a $4$-in/$4$-out\nground state and, simultaneously, a departure from the single-band\n$j_{\\text{eff}} = 1/2$ model across the accessed region of the phase diagram.\n", "  The aloof baby Skyrme model is a (2+1)-dimensional theory with solitons that\nare lightly bound. It is a low-dimensional analogue of a similar Skyrme model\nin (3+1)-dimensions, where the lightly bound solitons have binding energies\ncomparable to nuclei. A previous study of static solitons in the aloof baby\nSkyrme model revealed that multi-soliton bound states have a cluster structure,\nwith constituents that preserve their individual identities due to the\nshort-range repulsion and long-range attraction between solitons. Furthermore,\nthere are many different local energy minima that are all well-described by a\nsimple binary species particle model. In this paper we present the first\nresults on soliton dynamics in the aloof baby Skyrme model. Numerical field\ntheory simulations reveal that the lightly bound cluster structure results in a\nvariety of exotic soliton scattering events that are novel in comparison to\nstandard Skyrmion scattering. A dynamical version of the binary species point\nparticle model is shown to provide a good qualitative description of the\ndynamics.\n", "  Restricted three-body codes have a proven ability to recreate much of the\ndisturbed morphology of actual interacting galaxies. As more sophisticated\nn-body models were developed and computer speed increased, restricted\nthree-body codes fell out of favor. However, their supporting role for\nperforming wide searches of parameter space when fitting orbits to real systems\ndemonstrates a continuing need for their use. Here we present the model and\nalgorithm used in the JSPAM code. A precursor of this code was originally\ndescribed in 1990, and was called SPAM. We have recently updated the software\nwith an alternate potential and a treatment of dynamical friction to more\nclosely mimic the results from n-body tree codes. The code is released publicly\nfor use under the terms of the Academic Free License (AFL) v.3.0 and has been\nadded to the Astrophysics Source Code Library.\n", "  The electron spin in a semiconductor quantum dot can be coherently controlled\nby an external electric field, an effect called electric-dipole spin resonance\n(EDSR). Several mechanisms can give rise to the EDSR effect, among which there\nis a hyperfine mechanism, where the spin-electric coupling is mediated by the\nelectron-nucleus hyperfine interaction. Here, we investigate the influence of\nfrequency modulation (FM) on the spin-flip efficiency. Our results reveal that\nFM plays an important role in the hyperfine mechanism. Without FM, the electric\nfield almost cannot flip the electron spin; the spin-flip probability is only\nabout 20%. While under FM, the spin-flip probability can be improved to\napproximately 70%. In particular, we find that the modulation amplitude has a\nlower bound, which is related to the width of the fluctuated hyperfine field.\n", "  The objective of this work is to demonstrate the utility of Lyapunov\nfunctions in control synthesis for the purpose of maintaining and stabilizing a\nspacecraft in a circular orbit around the L4 point in the circular restricted\nthree body problem (CRTBP). Incorporating the requirements of a fixed radius\norbit and a desired angular momentum, a Lyapunov function is constructed and\nthe requisite analysis is performed to obtain a controller. Asymptotic\nstability is proved in a defined region around the L4 point using LaSalle's\nprinciple.\n", "  In the path integral approach, one has to sum over all histories that start\nfrom the same initial condition in order to obtain the final condition as a\nsuperposition of histories. Applying this into black hole dynamics, we consider\nstable and unstable stationary bubbles as a reasonable and regular initial\ncondition. We find examples where the bubble can either form a black hole or\ntunnel toward a trivial geometry, i.e., with no singularity nor event horizon.\nWe investigate the dynamics and tunneling channels of true vacuum bubbles for\nvarious tensions. In particular, in line with the idea of superposition of\ngeometries, we build a classically stable stationary thin-shell solution in a\nMinkowski background where its fate is probabilistically given by\nnon-perturbative effects. Since there exists a tunneling channel toward a\ntrivial geometry in the entire path integral, the entire information is encoded\nin the wave function. This demonstrates that the unitarity is preserved and\nthere is no loss of information when viewed from the entire wave function of\nthe universe, whereas a semi-classical observer, who can see only a definitive\ngeometry, would find an effective loss of information. This may provide a\nresolution to the information loss dilemma.\n", "  In this paper we consider the $q$-deformed totally asymmetric zero range\nprocess ($q$-TAZRP), also known as the $q$-boson (stochastic) particle system,\non the ${\\mathbb Z}$ lattice, such that the jump rate of a particle depends on\nthe site where it is on the lattice. We derive the transition probability for\nan $n$ particle process in Bethe ansatz form as a sum of $n!$ $n$-fold contour\nintegrals. Our result generalizes the transition probability formula by\nKorhonen and Lee for $q$-TAZRP with a homogeneous lattice, and our method\nfollows the same approach as theirs.\n", "  We formulate a linear response theory of the chiral magnetic effect in a\nfinite Weyl semimetal, expressing the electrical current density $j$ induced by\na slowly oscillating magnetic field $B$ or chiral chemical potential $\\mu$ in\nterms of the scattering matrix of Weyl fermions at the Fermi level. Surface\nconduction can be neglected in the infinite-system limit for $\\delta j/\\delta\n\\mu$, but not for $\\delta j/\\delta B$: The chirally circulating surface Fermi\narcs give a comparable contribution to the bulk Weyl cones no matter how large\nthe system is, because their smaller number is compensated by an increased flux\nsensitivity. The Fermi arc contribution to $\\mu^{-1}\\delta j/\\delta B$ has the\nuniversal value $(e/h)^2$, protected by chirality against impurity scattering\n--- unlike the bulk contribution of opposite sign.\n", "  The spatial modes of photons are one realization of a QuDit, a quantum system\nthat is described in a D-dimensional Hilbert space. In order to perform quantum\ninformation tasks with QuDits, a general class of D-dimensional unitary\ntransformations is needed. Among these, cyclic transformations are an important\nspecial case required in many high-dimensional quantum communication protocols.\nIn this paper, we experimentally demonstrate a cyclic transformation in the\nhigh-dimensional space of photonic orbital angular momentum (OAM). Using simple\nlinear optical components, we show a successful four-fold cyclic transformation\nof OAM modes. Interestingly, our experimental setup was found by a computer\nalgorithm. In addition to the four-cyclic transformation, the algorithm also\nfound extensions to higher-dimensional cycles in a hybrid space of OAM and\npolarization. Besides being useful for quantum cryptography with QuDits, cyclic\ntransformations are key for the experimental production of high-dimensional\nmaximally entangled Bell-states.\n", "  We have studied numerically the Hamiltonian dynamics of two same-sign point\nvortices in an effectively two-dimensional, harmonically trapped Bose-Einstein\ncondensate. We have found in the phase space of the system an impenetrable wall\nthat divides the dynamics into two distinct and exhaustive types. In the\ntwo-dimensional position-coordinate space, the first type corresponds to\nintersecting single-vortex orbits and the second type to orbits that have no\npoints in common. The two types are also easily distinguished in the\ntwo-dimensional space spanned by the radial and angular velocities of the\nvortices: in the first type, both single-vortex orbits are the same simple loop\nin this two-dimensional space, whereas in the second type the two orbits\nconstitute two nonintersecting loops. The phase-space-dividing wall is distinct\nfrom the bifurcation curve of rigidly rotating states found by Navarro et al.\n[Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 225301 (2013)].\n", "  The Madelung transform relates the non-linear Schr\\\"odinger equation and a\ncompressible Euler equation known as the quantum hydrodynamical system. We\nprove that the Madelung transform is a momentum map associated with an action\nof the semidirect product group $\\mathrm{Diff}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})\\ltimes\nC^\\infty(\\mathbb{R}^{n})$, which is the configuration space of compressible\nfluids, on the space $\\Psi$ of wave functions. In particular, we show that the\nMadelung transform is a Poisson map taking the natural Poisson bracket on\n$\\Psi$ to the compressible fluid Poisson bracket, and observe that the Madelung\ntransform provides an example of \"Clebsch variables\" for the hydrodynamical\nsystem.\n", "  The magnetic instability at the front of the spin avalanche in a crystal of\nmolecular magnets is considered. This phenomenon reveals similar features with\nthe Darrieus-Landau instability, inherent to classical combustion flame fronts.\nThe instability growth rate and the cut-off wavelength are investigated with\nrespect to the strength of the external magnetic field, both analytically in\nthe limit of an infinitely thin front and numerically for finite-width fronts.\nThe presence of quantum tunneling resonances is shown to increase the growth\nrate significantly, which may lead to a possible transition from deflagration\nto detonation regimes. Different orientations of the crystal easy axis are\nshown to exhibit opposite stability properties. In addition, we suggest\nexperimental conditions that could evidence the instability and its influence\non the magnetic deflagration velocity.\n", "  The dark matter halos that host galaxies and clusters form out of initial\nhigh-density patches, providing a biased tracer of the linear matter density\nfield. In the simplest local bias approximation, the halo field is treated as a\nperturbative series in the average overdensity of the Lagrangian patch. In more\nrealistic models, however, additional quantities will affect the clustering of\nhalo-patches, and this expansion becomes a function of several stochastic\nvariables. In this paper, we present a general multivariate expansion scheme\nthat can parametrize the clustering of any biased Lagrangian tracer, given only\nthe variables involved and their symmetry (in our case rotational invariance).\nThis approach is based on an expansion in the orthonormal polynomials\nassociated with the relevant variables, so that no renormalization of the\ncoefficients ever occurs. We provide explicit expression for the series\ncoefficients, or Lagrangian bias parameters, in the case of peaks of the linear\ndensity field. As an application of our formalism, we present a simple\nderivation of the original BBKS formula, and compute the non-Gaussian bias in\nthe presence of a primordial trispectrum of the local shape.\n", "  Prototype scintilator+WLS strips with SiPM readout for a muon system at\nfuture colliders were tested for light yield, time resolution and position\nresolution. Depending on the configuration, light yield of up to 36\nphotoelectrons per muon per SiPM has been observed, as well as time resolution\nof 0.45 ns and position resolution along the strip of 7.7 cm.\n", "  Drift ordered fluid models are widely applied in studies of low-frequency\nturbulence in the edge and scrape-off layer regions of magnetically confined\nplasmas. Here, we show how collisional transport across the magnetic field is\nself-consistently incorporated into drift-fluid models without altering the\ndrift-fluid energy integral. We demonstrate that the inclusion of collisional\ntransport in drift-fluid models gives rise to diffusion of particle density,\nmomentum and pressures in drift-fluid turbulence models and thereby obviate the\ncustomary use of artificial diffusion in turbulence simulations. We further\nderive a computationally efficient, two-dimensional model which can be time\nintegrated for several turbulence de-correlation times using only limited\ncomputational resources. The model describes interchange turbulence in a\ntwo-dimensional plane perpendicular to the magnetic field located at the\noutboard midplane of a tokamak. The model domain has two regions modeling open\nand closed field lines. The model employs a computational expedient model for\ncollisional transport. Numerical simulations show good agreement between the\nfull and the simplified model for collisional transport.\n", "  The string/$M$ theory Axiverse -- a plethora of very light Axion Like\nParticles (ALPs) with a vast range of masses -- is arguably a generic\nprediction of string/$M$ theory. String/$M$ theory also tends to predict that\nthe early Universe is dominated by moduli fields. When the heavy moduli decay,\nbefore nucleosynthesis, they produce dark radiation in the form of relativistic\nALPs. Generically one estimates that the number of relativistic species grows\nwith the number of axions in the Axiverse, in contradiction to the observations\nthat $N_{eff} \\leq 4$. We explain this problem in detail and suggest some\npossible solutions to it. The simplest solution requires that the lightest\nmodulus decays only into its own axion superpartner plus Standard Model\nparticles and this severely constrains the moduli Kahler potential and mass\nmatrix.\n", "  Several small dense exoplanets are now known, inviting comparisons to Earth\nand Venus. Such comparisons require translating their masses and sizes to\ncomposition models of evolved multi-layer-interior planets. Such theoretical\nmodels rely on our understanding of the Earth's interior, as well as\nindependently derived equations of state (EOS), but have so far not involved\ndirect extrapolations from Earth's seismic model -PREM. In order to facilitate\nmore detailed compositional comparisons between small exoplanets and the Earth,\nwe derive here a semi-empirical mass-radius relation for two-layer rocky\nplanets based on PREM: ${\\frac{R}{R_\\oplus}} = (1.07-0.21\\cdot \\text{CMF})\\cdot\n(\\frac{M}{M_\\oplus})^{1/3.7}$, where CMF stands for Core Mass Fraction. It is\napplicable to 1$\\sim$8 M$_{\\oplus}$ and CMF of 0.0$\\sim$0.4. Applying this\nformula to Earth and Venus and several known small exoplanets with radii and\nmasses measured to better than $\\sim$30\\% precision gives a CMF fit of\n$0.26\\pm0.07$.\n", "  We use the coordinate Bethe ansatz to exactly calculate matrix elements\nbetween eigenstates of the Lieb-Liniger model of one-dimensional bosons\ninteracting via a two-body delta-potential. We investigate the static\ncorrelation functions of the zero-temperature ground state and their dependence\non interaction strength, and analyze the effects of system size in the\ncrossover from few-body to mesoscopic regimes for up to seven particles. We\nalso obtain time-dependent nonequilibrium correlation functions for five\nparticles following quenches of the interaction strength from two distinct\ninitial states. One quench is from the non-interacting ground state and the\nother from a correlated ground state near the strongly interacting\nTonks-Girardeau regime. The final interaction strength and conserved energy are\nchosen to be the same for both quenches. The integrability of the model highly\nconstrains its dynamics, and we demonstrate that the time-averaged correlation\nfunctions following quenches from these two distinct initial conditions are\nboth nonthermal and moreover distinct from one another.\n", "  We show that the Nambu-Goldstone formalism of the broken gauge symmetry in\nthe presence of the $T=1$ pairing condensate offers a quantitative description\nof the binding-energy differences of open-shell superfluid nuclei. We conclude\nthat the pairing-rotational moments of inertia are excellent pairing\nindicators, which are free from ambiguities attributed to odd-mass systems. We\noffer a new, unified interpretation of the binding-energy differences\ntraditionally viewed in the shell model picture as signatures of the valence\nnucleon properties. We present the first systematic analysis of the\noff-diagonal pairing-rotational moments of inertia and demonstrate the mixing\nof the neutron and proton pairing-rotational modes in the ground states of\neven-even nuclei. Finally, we discuss the importance of mass measurements of\nneutron-rich nuclei for constraining the pairing energy density functional.\n", "  The Galactic transient X-ray binary MAXI~J1836-194 was discovered on 29th\nAugust 2011. Here we make a detailed study of the spectral and timing\nproperties of its 2011 outburst using archival data of RXTE Proportional\nCounter Array instrument. The evolution of accretion flow dynamics of the\nsource during the outburst through spectral analysis with\nChakrabarti-Titarchuk's two-component advective flow (TCAF) solution as a local\ntable model in XSPEC. We also fitted spectra with combined disk blackbody and\npower-law models and compared it with the TCAF model fitted results. The source\nis found to be in hard and hard-intermediate spectral states only during entire\nphase of this outburst. No soft or soft-intermediate spectral states are\nobserved. This could be due to the fact that this object belongs to a special\nclass of sources (e.g., MAXI~J1659-152, Swift~J1753.5-0127, etc.) that have\nvery short orbital periods and that companion is profusely mass-losing or the\ndisk is immersed inside an excretion disk. In these cases, flows in the\naccretion disk is primarily dominated by low viscous sub-Keplerian flow and the\nKeplerian rate is not high enough to initiate softer states. Low-frequency\nquasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are observed sporadically although as in\nnormal outbursts of transient black holes, monotonic evolutions of QPO\nfrequency during both rising and declining phases are observed. From the TCAF\nfits, we find mass of the black hole in the range of $7.5-11~M_\\odot$ and from\ntime differences between peaks of the Keplerian and sub-Keplerian accretion\nrates we obtain viscous timescale for this particular outburst $\\sim 10$~days.\n", "  The dispersive representation of the virtual Compton forward scattering\namplitude has been recently reexamined in connection with the evaluation of the\nCottingham formula for the proton-neutron electromagnetic mass difference. The\nmost difficult part of the analysis is related to one of the invariant\namplitudes, denoted as $T_1(\\nu, Q^2)$, which requires a subtraction in the\nstandard dispersion relation with respect to the energy $\\nu$ at fixed photon\nmomentum squared $q^2=-Q^2$. We propose an alternative dispersive framework,\nwhich implements analyticity and unitarity by combining the Cauchy integral\nrelation at low and moderate energies with the modulus representation of the\namplitude at high energies. Using techniques of functional analysis, we derive\na necessary and sufficient condition for the consistency with analyticity of\nthe subtraction function $S_1(Q^2)=T_1(0, Q^2)$, the electron-proton cross\nsections measured at low and moderate energies and the Regge model assumed to\nbe valid at high energies. From this condition we obtain model-independent\nconstraints on the subtraction function, confronting them with the available\ninformation on nucleon magnetic polarizabilities and results reported recently\nin the literature. The formalism can be used also for testing the existence of\na fixed pole at $J=0$ in the angular momentum plane, but more accurate data are\nnecessary for a definite answer.\n", "  Breaking the up-down symmetry of tokamaks removes a constraint limiting\nintrinsic momentum transport, and hence toroidal rotation, to be small. Using\ngyrokinetic theory, we study the effect of different up-down asymmetric flux\nsurface shapes on the turbulent transport of momentum. This is done by\nperturbatively expanding the gyrokinetic equation in large flux surface shaping\nmode number. It is found that the momentum flux generated by shaping that lacks\nmirror symmetry (which is necessarily up-down asymmetric) has a power law\nscaling with the shaping mode number. However, the momentum flux generated by\nmirror symmetric flux surface shaping (even if it is up-down asymmetric) decays\nexponentially with large shaping mode number. These scalings are consistent\nwith nonlinear local gyrokinetic simulations and indicate that low mode number\nshaping effects (e.g. elongation, triangularity) are optimal for creating\nrotation. Additionally it suggests that breaking the mirror symmetry of flux\nsurfaces may generate significantly more toroidal rotation.\n", "  The classic comparison theorem of quantum mechanics states that if two\npotentials are ordered then the corresponding energy eigenvalues are similarly\nordered, that is to say if $V_a\\le V_b$, then $E_a\\le E_b$. Such theorems have\nrecently been established for relativistic problems even though the discrete\nspectra are not easily characterized variationally. In this paper we improve on\nthe basic comparison theorem for the Dirac equation with spin and pseudo--spin\nsymmetry in $d\\ge 1$ dimensions. The graphs of two comparison potentials may\nnow cross each other in a prescribed manner implying that the energy values are\nstill ordered. The refined comparison theorems are valid for the ground state\nin one dimension and for the bottom of an angular momentum subspace in $d>1$\ndimensions. For instance in a simplest case in one dimension, the condition\n$V_a\\le V_b$ is replaced by $U_a\\le U_b$, where $U_i(x)=\\int_0^x V_i(t)dt$,\n$x\\in[0,\\ \\infty)$, and $i=a$ or $b$.\n", "  The Poisson's ratio characterizes the resultant strain in the lateral\ndirection for a material under longitudinal deformation. Though negative\nPoisson's ratios (NPR) are theoretically possible within continuum elasticity,\nthey are most frequently observed in engineered materials and structures, as\nthey are not intrinsic to many materials. In this work, we report NPR in\nsingle-layer graphene ribbons, which results from the compressive edge stress\ninduced warping of the edges. The effect is robust, as the NPR is observed for\ngraphene ribbons with widths smaller than about 10 nm, and for tensile strains\nsmaller than about 0.5%, with NPR values reaching as large as -1.51. The NPR is\nexplained analytically using an inclined plate model, which is able to predict\nthe Poisson's ratio for graphene sheets of arbitrary size. The inclined plate\nmodel demonstrates that the NPR is governed by the interplay between the width\n(a bulk property), and the warping amplitude of the edge (an edge property),\nwhich eventually yields a phase diagram determining the sign of the Poisson's\nratio as a function of the graphene geometry.\n", "  Coherence effects by the impurity scattering of Caroli--de Gennes--Matricon\n(CdGM) modes in a vortex for nodal topological superconductors have been\nstudied. The coherence effects reflect a topological number defined on a\nparticular momentum space avoiding the superconducting gap nodes. First, we\nanalytically derived the eigenvalue and eigenfunction of the CdGM modes,\nincluding the zero-energy modes, in a nodal topological superconducting state\nwithout impurities, where we focused on a possible superconducting state of\nUPt$_3$ as an example. Then, we studied impurity effects on the CdGM modes by\nintroducing the impurity self-energy, which are dominated by the coherence\nfactor depending on the eigenfunction of the CdGM modes. For the zero-energy\nCdGM modes, the coherence factor vanishes in a certain momentum range, which is\nguaranteed by topological invariance characterized by the one-dimensional\nwinding number.\n", "  We investigate the development of scientific content knowledge of volunteers\nparticipating in online citizen science projects in the Zooniverse\n(www.zooniverse.org), including the astronomy projects Galaxy Zoo\n(www.galaxyzoo.org) and Planet Hunters (www.planethunters.org). We use\neconometric methods to test how measures of project participation relate to\nsuccess in a science quiz, controlling for factors known to correlate with\nscientific knowledge. Citizen scientists believe they are learning about both\nthe content and processes of science through their participation. Won't don't\ndirectly test the latter, but we find evidence to support the former - that\nmore actively engaged participants perform better in a project-specific science\nknowledge quiz, even after controlling for their general science knowledge. We\ninterpret this as evidence of learning of science content inspired by\nparticipation in online citizen science.\n", "  Measurements of acoustic backscattering from glacially-eroded rock outcrops\nwere made off the coast of Sandefjord, Norway using a high-frequency synthetic\naperture sonar (SAS) system. A method by which scattering strength can be\nestimated from data collected by a SAS system is detailed, as well as a method\nto estimate an effective calibration parameter for the system. Scattering\nstrength measurements from very smooth areas of the rock outcrops agree with\npredictions from both the small-slope approximation and perturbation theory,\nand range between -33 and -26 dB at 20$^\\circ$ grazing angle. Scattering\nstrength measurements from very rough areas of the rock outcrops agree with the\nsine-squared shape of the empirical Lambertian model and fall between -30 and\n-20 dB at 20$^\\circ$ grazing angle. Both perturbation theory and the\nsmall-slope approximation are expected to be inaccurate for the very rough\narea, and overestimate scattering strength by 8 dB or more for all measurements\nof very rough surfaces. Supporting characterization of the environment was\nperformed in the form of geoacoustic and roughness parameter estimates.\n", "  As PT and CP symmetries are fundamental in physics, we establish a unified\ntopological theory of PT and CP invariant metals and nodal superconductors,\nbased on the mathematically rigorous $KO$ theory. Representative models are\nconstructed for all nontrivial topological cases in dimensions $d=1,2$, and\n$3$, with their exotic physical meanings being elucidated in detail.\nIntriguingly, it is found that the topological charges of Fermi surfaces in the\nbulk determine an exotic direction-dependent distribution of topological subgap\nmodes on the boundaries. Furthermore, by constructing an exact bulk-boundary\ncorrespondence, we show that the topological Fermi points of the PT and CP\ninvariant classes can appear as gapless modes on the boundary of topological\ninsulators with a certain type of anisotropic crystalline symmetry.\n", "  Understanding protein self-assembly is important for many biological and\nindustrial processes. Proteins can self-assemble into crystals, filaments,\ngels, and other amorphous aggregates. The final forms include virus capsids and\ncondensed phases associated with diseases, such as amyloid fibrils. Although\nseemingly different, these assemblies all originate from fundamental protein\ninteractions and are driven by similar thermodynamic and kinetic factors. Here\nwe review recent advances in understanding protein self-assembly through a soft\ncondensed matter perspective with an emphasis on three specific systems:\nglobular proteins, viruses and amyloid fibers. We conclude with a discussion of\nunanswered questions in the field.\n", "  It has been recently shown that a nanostructure composed of a quantum dot\nsurrounded by a quantum ring possesses a set of very unique characteristics\nthat make it a good candidate for future nanoelectronic devices. Its main\nadvantage is the ability to easily tune transport properties on demand by so\ncalled \"wave function engineering\". In practice, the distribution of the\nelectron wave function in the nanostructure can be controlled by, e.g.,\nelectrical gating. In order to predict some particular properties of the system\none has to know the exact wave functions for different shapes of the confining\npotential that defines the structure.\n  In this paper we compare three different methods that can be used to\ndetermine the energy spectrum, electron wave functions and transport properties\nof the system under investigation. In the first approach we utilize the\ncylindrical symmetry of the confining potential and solve only the radial part\nof the Schrodinger equation; in the second approach we discretize the\nSchrodinger equation in two dimensions and find the eigenstates with the help\nof the Lanczos method; in the third approach we use package Kwant to solve a\ntight-binding approximation of the original system. To study the transport\nproperties in all these approaches we calculate microscopically the strength of\nthe coupling between the nanosystem and leads. In the first two approaches we\nuse the Bardeen method, in the third one calculations are performed with the\nhelp of package Kwant.\n", "  The relation between the flux of temperature (or buoyancy), the vertical\ntemperature gradient and the height above the bottom, is investigated in an\noceanographic context, using high-resolution temperature measurements. The\nmodel for the evolution of a stratified layer by Balmforth et al. (1998) is\nreviewed and adapted to the case of a turbulent flow above a wall. Model\npredictions are compared to the average observational estimates of the flux,\nexploiting a flux estimation method proposed by Winters & D'Asaro (1996). This\nestimation method enables the disentanglement of the dependence of the average\nflux on the height above the bottom and on the background temperature gradient.\nThe classical N-shaped flux-gradient relation is found in the observations.\nModel and observations show similar qualitative behaviour, despite the strong\nsimplifications used in the model. The results shed light on the modulation of\nthe temperature flux by the presence of the boundary, and support the idea of a\nturbulent flux following a mixing-length argument in a stratified flow.\nFurthermore, the results support the use of Thorpe scales close to a boundary,\nif sufficient averaging is performed, suggesting that the Thorpe scales are\naffected by the boundary in a similar way as the mixing length.\n", "  We have obtained K-band Multi-Object Spectrograph (KMOS) near-IR spectroscopy\nfor 14 red supergiant stars (RSGs) in the young massive star cluster NGC 2100\nin the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Stellar parameters including metallicity\nare estimated using the J-band analysis technique, which has been rigorously\ntested in the Local Universe. We find an average metallicity for NGC 2100 of\n[Z]=$-$0.43$\\pm$0.10 dex, in good agreement with estimates from the literature\nfor the LMC. Comparing our results in NGC 2100 with those for a Galactic\ncluster (at Solar-like metallicity) with a similar mass and age we find no\nsignificant difference in the location of RSGs in the Hertzsprung--Russell\ndiagram. We combine the observed KMOS spectra to form a simulated\nintegrated-light cluster spectrum and show that, by analysing this spectrum as\na single RSG, the results are consistent with the average properties of the\ncluster. Radial velocities are estimated for the targets and the dynamical\nproperties are estimated for the first time within this cluster. The data are\nconsistent with a flat velocity dispersion profile, and with an upper limit of\n3.9 km/s, at the 95% confidence level, for the velocity dispersion of the\ncluster. However, the intrinsic velocity dispersion is unresolved and could,\ntherefore, be significantly smaller than the upper limit reported here. An\nupper limit on the dynamical mass of the cluster is derived as $M_{dyn}$ $\\le$\n$15.2\\times10^{4}M_{\\odot}$ assuming virial equilibrium.\n", "  Free fermionic models and symmetric heterotic toroidal orbifolds both\nconstitute exact backgrounds that can be used effectively for phenomenological\nexplorations within string theory. Even though it is widely believed that for\nZ2xZ2 orbifolds the two descriptions should be equivalent, a detailed\ndictionary between both formulations is still lacking. This paper aims to fill\nthis gap: We give a detailed account of how the input data of both descriptions\ncan be related to each other. In particular, we show that the generalized GSO\nphases of the free fermionic model correspond to generalized torsion phases\nused in orbifold model building. We illustrate our translation methods by\nproviding free fermionic realizations for all Z2xZ2 orbifold geometries in six\ndimensions.\n", "  Spatial symmetries in crystals are distinguished by whether they preserve the\nspatial origin. We show how this basic geometric property gives rise to a new\ntopology in band insulators. We study spatial symmetries that translate the\norigin by a fraction of the lattice period, and find that these nonsymmorphic\nsymmetries protect a novel surface fermion whose dispersion is shaped like an\nhourglass; surface bands connect one hourglass to the next in an unbreakable\nzigzag pattern. These exotic fermions are materialized in the large-gap\ninsulators: KHgX (X=As,Sb,Bi), which we propose as the first material class\nwhose topology relies on nonsymmorphic symmetries. Beside the hourglass\nfermion, another surface of KHgX manifests a 3D generalization of the quantum\nspin Hall effect, which has only been observed in 2D crystals. To describe the\nbulk topology of nonsymmorphic crystals, we propose a non-Abelian\ngeneralization of the geometric theory of polarization. Our nontrivial topology\noriginates from an inversion of the rotational quantum numbers, which we\npropose as a fruitful criterion in the search for topological materials.\n", "  We present a range of methods suitable for accurate evaluation of the leading\nasymptotics for integrals of products of Jacobi polynomials in limits when the\ndegrees of some or all polynomials inside the integral become large. The\nstructures in question have recently emerged in the context of effective\ndescriptions of small amplitude perturbations in anti-de Sitter (AdS)\nspacetime. The limit of high degree polynomials corresponds in this situation\nto effective interactions involving extreme short-wavelength modes, whose\ndynamics is crucial for the turbulent instabilities that determine the ultimate\nfate of small AdS perturbations. We explicitly apply the relevant asymptotic\ntechniques to the case of a self-interacting probe scalar field in AdS and\nextract a detailed form of the leading large degree behavior, including closed\nform analytic expressions for the numerical coefficients appearing in the\nasymptotics.\n", "  The theoretical concept of Chakrabarti-Titarchuk two Component Advective Flow\n(TCAF) model was introduced around two decade ago in mid-90s. Recently after\nthe inclusion of TCAF model into XSPEC as an additive table model, we find that\nit is quite capable to fit spectra from different phases of few transient black\nhole candidates (TBHCs) during their outbursts. This quite agrees with our\ntheoretical understanding. Here, a brief summary of our recent studies of\nspectral and temporal properties of few TBHCs during their X-ray outbursts with\nTCAF will be discussed.\n", "  We determine mass of MAXI J1659-152 using two different methods, viz:\nconstant Normalization parameter point of view while fitting with TCAF,\n$M_{BH}$-$\\chi^2_{red}$ variation from TCAF fits. We find a mass range of\n$4.06-7.93~M_\\odot$ with a most probable value at $6 \\pm 2 M_\\odot$.\n", "  The complete characterisation of the charge transport in a mesoscopic device\nis provided by the Full Counting Statistics (FCS) $P_t(m)$, describing the\namount of charge $Q = me$ transmitted during the time $t$. Although numerous\nsystems have been theoretically characterized by their FCS, the experimental\nmeasurement of the distribution function $P_t(m)$ or its moments $\\langle Q^n\n\\rangle$ are rare and often plagued by strong back-action. Here, we present a\nstrategy for the measurement of the FCS, more specifically its characteristic\nfunction $\\chi(\\lambda)$ and moments $\\langle Q^n \\rangle$, by a qubit with a\nset of different couplings $\\lambda_j$, $j = 1,\\dots,k,\\dots k+p$, $k = \\lceil\nn/2 \\rceil$, $p \\geq 0$, to the mesoscopic conductor. The scheme involves\nmultiple readings of Ramsey sequences at the different coupling strengths\n$\\lambda_j$ and we find the optimal distribution for these couplings\n$\\lambda_j$ as well as the optimal distribution $N_j$ of $N = \\sum N_j$\nmeasurements among the different couplings $\\lambda_j$. We determine the\nprecision scaling for the moments $\\langle Q^n \\rangle$ with the number $N$ of\ninvested resources and show that the standard quantum limit can be approached\nwhen many additional couplings $p\\gg 1$ are included in the measurement scheme.\n", "  Due to their steep spectra, low-frequency observations of FR II radio\ngalaxies potentially provide key insights in to the morphology, energetics and\nspectrum of these powerful radio sources. However, limitations imposed by the\nprevious generation of radio interferometers at metre wavelengths has meant\nthat this region of parameter space remains largely unexplored. In this paper,\nthe first in a series examining FR IIs at low frequencies, we use LOFAR\nobservations between 50 and 160 MHz, along with complementary archival radio\nand X-ray data, to explore the properties of two FR II sources, 3C452 and\n3C223. We find that the morphology of 3C452 is that of a standard FR II rather\nthan of a double-double radio galaxy as had previously been suggested, with no\nremnant emission being observed beyond the active lobes. We find that the\nlow-frequency integrated spectra of both sources are much steeper than expected\nbased on traditional assumptions and, using synchrotron/inverse-Compton model\nfitting, show that the total energy content of the lobes is greater than\nprevious estimates by a factor of around 5 for 3C452 and 2 for 3C223. We go on\nto discuss possible causes of these steeper than expected spectra and provide\nrevised estimates of the internal pressures and magnetic field strengths for\nthe intrinsically steep case. We find that the ratio between the equipartition\nmagnetic field strengths and those derived through synchrotron/inverse-Compton\nmodel fitting remains consistent with previous findings and show that the\nobserved departure from equipartition may in some cases provide a solution to\nthe spectral versus dynamical age disparity.\n", "  We propose a smooth pseudopotential for the contact interaction acting\nbetween ultracold atoms confined to two dimensions. The pseudopotential\nreproduces the scattering properties of the repulsive contact interaction up to\n200 times more accurately than a hard disk potential, and in the attractive\nbranch gives a 10-fold improvement in accuracy over the square well potential.\nFurthermore, the new potential enables diffusion Monte Carlo simulations of the\nultracold gas to be run 15 times quicker than was previously possible.\n", "  We have proposed a scheme of the generation and preservation of two-qubit\nsteady state quantum correlations through quantum channels where successive\nuses of the channels are correlated. Different types of noisy channels with\nmemory, such as amplitude damping, phase-damping, and depolarizing channels\nhave been taken into account. Some analytical or numerical results are\npresented. The effect of channels with memory on dynamics of quantum\ncorrelations has been discussed in detail. The results show that, steady state\nentanglement between two independent qubits without entanglement subject to\namplitude damping channel with memory can be generated. Besides, we compare the\ndynamics of entanglement with that of quantum discord when a two-qubit system\nis prepared in an entangled state. We show that entanglement dynamics suddenly\ndisappears, while quantum discord displays only in the asymptotic limit.\nTwo-qubit quantum correlations can be preserved at a long time in the limit of\n$\\mu\\rightarrow1$.\n", "  Uncertainties related to the effect of neutrino coherent forward scattering\nin Earth's matter (MSW mechanism) and with the cross sections of quasi-elastic\nneutrino scattering on nuclear targets of the NO$\\nu$A detectors are studied.\nThe NO$\\nu$A sensitivity to the neutrino mass hierarchy and the CP violating\nphase is discussed.\n", "  We investigate controllable spatial modulation of circular autofocusing Airy\nbeams, under action of different dynamic linear potentials, both theoretically\nand numerically. We introduce a novel treatment method in which the circular\nAiry beam is represented as a superposition of narrow azimuthally-modulated\none-dimensional Airy beams that can be analytically treated. The dynamic linear\npotentials are appropriately designed, so that the autofocusing effect can\neither be weakened or even eliminated when the linear potential exerts a\n\"pulling\" effect on the beam, or if the linear potential exerts a \"pushing\"\neffect, the autofocusing effect can be greatly strengthened. Numerical\nsimulations agree with the theoretical results very well.\n", "  The azimuthal asymmetry in the risetime of signals in Auger surface detector\nstations is a source of information on shower development. The azimuthal\nasymmetry is due to a combination of the longitudinal evolution of the shower\nand geometrical effects related to the angles of incidence of the particles\ninto the detectors. The magnitude of the effect depends upon the zenith angle\nand state of development of the shower and thus provides a novel observable,\n$(\\sec \\theta)_\\mathrm{max}$, sensitive to the mass composition of cosmic rays\nabove $3 \\times 10^{18}$ eV. By comparing measurements with predictions from\nshower simulations, we find for both of our adopted models of hadronic physics\n(QGSJETII-04 and EPOS-LHC) an indication that the mean cosmic-ray mass\nincreases slowly with energy, as has been inferred from other studies. However,\nthe mass estimates are dependent on the shower model and on the range of\ndistance from the shower core selected. Thus the method has uncovered further\ndeficiencies in our understanding of shower modelling that must be resolved\nbefore the mass composition can be inferred from $(\\sec \\theta)_\\mathrm{max}$.\n", "  Since the pioneering work of Birkhoff and von Neumann, quantum logic has been\ninterpreted as the logic of (closed) subspaces of a Hilbert space. There is a\nprogression from the usual Boolean logic of subsets to the \"quantum logic\" of\nsubspaces of a general vector space--which is then specialized to the closed\nsubspaces of a Hilbert space. But there is a \"dual\" progression. The notion of\na partition (or quotient set or equivalence relation) is dual (in a\ncategory-theoretic sense) to the notion of a subset. Hence the Boolean logic of\nsubsets has a dual logic of partitions. Then the dual progression is from that\nlogic of partitions to the quantum logic of direct-sum decompositions (i.e.,\nthe vector space version of a set partition) of a general vector space--which\ncan then be specialized to the direct-sum decompositions of a Hilbert space.\nThis allows the logic to express measurement by any self-adjoint operators\nrather than just the projection operators associated with subspaces. In this\nintroductory paper, the focus is on the quantum logic of direct-sum\ndecompositions of a finite-dimensional vector space (including such a Hilbert\nspace). The primary special case examined is finite vector spaces over 2 where\nthe pedagogical model of quantum mechanics over sets (QM/Sets) is formulated.\nIn the Appendix, the combinatorics of direct-sum decompositions of finite\nvector spaces over GF(q) is analyzed with computations for the case of QM/Sets\nwhere q=2.\n", "  The holographic methods inspired by the gauge/gravity correspondence from\nstring theory have been actively applied to the hadron spectroscopy in the last\neleven years. Within the phenomenological bottom-up approach, the linear\nRegge-like trajectories for light mesons are naturally reproduced in the\nso-called \"Soft-wall\" holographic models. I will give a very short review of\nthe underlying ideas and technical aspects related to the meson spectroscopy. A\ngeneralization of soft-wall description of Regge trajectories to arbitrary\nintercept is proposed. The problem of incorporation of the chiral symmetry\nbreaking is discussed.\n", "  Region of the country is treated as an open megasystem that consists of many\ninterconnected complex network systems. Classification of such systems on the\nbasis of ordered motion of flows is performed. The main approaches to\ninvestigation of complex systems are described. Theory of evaluation is\nconsidered as a tool for analysis of network systems. Purpose and subject of\nevaluation of the systems are formulated. The main problems of evaluation are\nanalyzed and the ways of further research are determined.\n", "  Commercially available clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) for skin\ncancer have been designed for the detection of melanoma only. Correct use of\nthe systems requires expert knowledge, hampering their utility for nonexperts.\nFurthermore, there are no systems to detect other common skin cancer types,\nthat is, nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC). As early diagnosis of skin cancer is\nessential, there is a need for a CDSS that is applicable to all types of skin\nlesions and is suitable for nonexperts. Nevus Doctor (ND) is a CDSS being\ndeveloped by the authors. We here investigate ND's ability to detect both\nmelanoma and NMSC and the opportunities for improvement. An independent test\nset of dermoscopic images of 870 skin lesions, including 44 melanomas and 101\nNMSCs, were analysed by ND. Its sensitivity to melanoma and NMSC was compared\nto that of Mole Expert (ME), a commercially available CDSS, using the same set\nof lesions. ND and ME had similar sensitivity to melanoma. For ND at 95 percent\nmelanoma sensitivity, the NMSC sensitivity was 100 percent, and the specificity\nwas 12 percent. The melanomas misclassified by ND at 95 percent sensitivity\nwere correctly classified by ME, and vice versa. ND is able to detect NMSC\nwithout sacrificing melanoma sensitivity.\n", "  Based on $k\\cdot p$ analysis and realistic tight-binding calculations, we\nfind that time-reversal-breaking Weyl semimetals can be realized in\nmagnetically-doped (Mn, Eu, Cr etc.) Sn$_{1-x}$Pb$_x$(Te,Se) class of\ntopological crystalline insulators. All the Weyl points are well separated in\nmomentum space and possess nearly the same energy due to high crystalline\nsymmetry. Moreover, both the Weyl points and Fermi arcs are highly tunable by\nvarying Pb/Sn composition, pressure, magnetization, temperature, surface\npotential etc., opening up the possibility of manipulating Weyl points and\nrewiring the Fermi arcs.\n", "  Nd$_{2-x}$Ce$_x$CuO$_{4\\pm\\delta}$ (NCCO) epitaxial thin films have been\ndeposited on (100) SrTiO$_3$ substrates by DC sputtering technique in different\natmosphere. The as-grown samples show different dependence of the in-plane\nresistivity at low temperature, when they are grown in pure argon atmosphere or\nin oxygen. Moreover, an unusual behaviour is also found when transport takes\nplace in the presence of an external magnetic field. It is commonly accepted\nthat the higher anisotropic properties of NCCO crystalline cell with respect to\nthe hole doped YBCO and LSCO and the electric conduction mainly confined in the\nCuO$_2$ plane, strongly support the two-dimensional (2D) character of the\ncurrent transport in this system. Results on the temperature dependence of the\nresistance, as well as on the magnetoresistance and the Hall coefficient,\nobtained on epitaxial NCCO thin films in the over-doped region ($x\\ge0.15$) of\nthe phase diagram are presented and discussed.\n", "  We clarify and strengthen our demonstration that arrows of time necessarily\narise in unconfined systems. Contrary to a recent claim, this does not require\nan improbable selection principle.\n", "  This article presents an analysis of the extent to which local causal models\nor local realistic models of quantum theory (QT), including quantum field\ntheory (QFT), are theoretically possible and practically feasible in light of\nthe present state of these theories. Quantum physicists consider Bells famous\ninequality and its violation in experiments to be a strong indication that\nlocal realistic or local causal models of QT are not possible and that quantum\ntheory as a whole is therefore not a local realistic or local causal theory.\nBased on a proposed definition of a \"formal causal model\" for a theory of\nphysics (such as QT), this paper investigates the possibility of having a local\ncausal model for QT. Areas of QT are identified in which the construction of a\ncausal model is impeded because of deficiencies in the state of the respective\ntheory. It is shown that the removal of the deficiencies can be achieved by the\nprovision of a causal model. Whereas the construction of a causal model of QT,\nincluding QFT, appears to be feasible after the removal of certain\ndeficiencies, the construction of a local (causal) model does not appear to be\npossible. As a consequence of the conclusion that local (causal) models of\nQT/QFT are not possible, if a strong interpretation of locality is assumed, a\nlocality model is proposed in which the non-localities are confined to \"quantum\nobjects\".\n", "  We numerically and analytically analyze the startup continuous shear rheology\nof heavily entangled rigid rod polymer fluids based on our self-consistent,\nforce-level theory of anharmonic tube confinement. The approach is simplified\nby neglecting stress-assisted transverse barrier hopping, and irreversible\nrelaxation proceeds solely via deformation-perturbed reptation. This process is\nself-consistently coupled to tube dilation and macroscopic rheological\nresponse. We predict that with increasing strain the tube strongly dilates,\nentanglements are lost, and reptation speeds up. As a consequence, a stress\novershoot emerges not due to affine over-orientation, but rather to strong\nweakening of the entanglement network. Just beyond the stress overshoot the\nlongest relaxation time is predicted to scale as the inverse shear rate,\ncorresponding to the emergence of a generic form of convective constraint\nrelease (CCR). Its origin is a stress-induced local force that\nself-consistently couples the mesoscopic tube-scale physics with macroscopic\nmechanical response. Tube weakening at the overshoot occurs via the same\nqualitative mechanism that leads to microscopic absolute yielding in the\nnonlinear elastic scenario analyzed in the preceding paper. The stress\novershoot and emergent CCR thus correspond to an elastic-viscous crossover due\nto deformation-induced disentanglement, which at long times and high shear\nrates results in a quantitatively sensible flow stress plateau and shear\nthinning behavior. We suggest that the predicted behavior for needles is\nrelevant to flexible chain melts at low Rouse Weissenberg numbers if contour\nlength equilibration is fast. Quantitative predictions for tube dilation in the\nsteady state flow of chains melts are favorably compared to a recent\nsimulation.\n", "  Modified theories of gravity have been invoked recently as an alternative to\ndark energy, in an attempt to explain the apparent accelerated expansion of the\nuniverse at the present time. In order to describe inhomogeneities in\ncosmological models, cosmological perturbation theory is used, of which two\nformalisms exist: the metric approach and the covariant approach. In this paper\nI present the relationship between the metric and covariant approaches for\nmodeling $f(R)$ theories of gravity. This provides a useful resource that\nresearchers primarily working with one formalism can use to compare or\ntranslate their results to the other formalism.\n", "  We discuss the relation between symmetries and conservation laws in the realm\nof classical field theories based on the Hamiltonian constraint. In this\napproach, spacetime positions and field values are treated on equal footing,\nand a generalized multivector-valued momentum is introduced. We derive a\nfield-theoretic Hamiltonian version of the Noether theorem, and identify\ngeneralized Noether currents with the momentum contracted with\nsymmetry-generating vector fields. Their relation to the traditional vectorial\nNoether currents is then established. Throughout, we employ the mathematical\nlanguage of geometric algebra and calculus.\n", "  In this paper we state a fundamental question about the structure of\ncorrelations in time and analyze temporal monogamy relations. We show that the\nnature of temporal correlations is inherently different from the spatial ones\nbut in similarity to quantum spatial correlations, we expose a phenomenon of\nmonogamy of quantum entanglement in time. We perform this task applying the\nentangled histories framework as a modifcation of the consistent histories\napproach. These considerations are supported by introduction of necessary tools\nspecific for the tensor algebra used for representation of spatial\ncorrelations. We show that Tsirelson bound on temporal Bell-like inequalities\ncan be derived from the entangled histories approach. Finally, we point out\nthat in a context of the tensor algebra used for linking states in different\ntimes further studies on mathematical structure of the state representing\nevolving systems are needed.\n", "  We consider the neutrino masses and mixing in the framework of SO(10) GUTs\nwith hidden sector consisting of fermionic and bosonic SO(10) singlets and\nflavor symmetries. The framework allows to disentangle the CKM physics\nresponsible for the CKM mixing and different mass hierarchies of quarks and\nleptons and the neutrino new physics which produces smallness of neutrino\nmasses and large lepton mixing. The framework leads naturally to the relation\n$U_{PMNS} \\sim V_{CKM}^{\\dagger} U_0$, where structure of $U_0$ is determined\nby the flavor symmetry. The key feature of the framework is that apart from the\nDirac mass matrices $m_D$, the portal mass matrix $M_D$ and the mass matrix of\nsinglets $M_S$ are also involved in generation of the lepton mixing. This opens\nup new possibilities to realize the flavor symmetries and explain the data.\nUsing $A_4 \\times Z_4$ as the flavor group, we systematically explore the\nflavor structures which can be obtained in this framework depending on field\ncontent and symmetry assignments. We formulate additional conditions which lead\nto $U_0 \\sim U_{TBM}$ or $U_{BM}$. They include (i) equality (in general,\nproportionality) of the singlet flavons couplings, (ii) equality of their VEVs;\n(iii) correlation between VEVs of singlets and triplet, (iv) certain VEV\nalignment of flavon triplet(s). These features can follow from additional\nsymmetries or be remnants of further unification. Phenomenologically viable\nschemes with minimal flavon content and minimal number of couplings are\nconstructed.\n", "  In this PhD dissertation, I discuss issues of the Radial Velocities (RV) and\ntransit methods. These techniques allow us to derive the mass and radius of an\nexoplanet, necessary to model its bulk structure and to have insight on its\nformation. To do this, however, also the same parameters of its host star are\nneeded. By using spectroscopy, I participated in TRANSITS, an RV follow-up\nprogram of Kepler Objects of Interest. I determined the parameters of nine host\nstars, enabling the characterization of their companions. With the same method,\nI participated in two studies which aim at exploring the mass-radius\nrelationship of low-mass stars and at improving the statistics of star-planet\ninteractions. I also inspected the behavior of SOPHIE/OHP spectra for\ninstrumental effects which can affect the measure of the stellar parameters.\nFrom a different perspective, I studied Kepler-117, a multi-planetary system\nwhich presents Transit Timing Variations (TTV). A specific approach was\ndeveloped in order to realize a simultaneous fit of transits, RV, and TTV, used\nto measure the mass of the lightest planet of the system, which was poorly\nconstrained by RV alone. Finally, I focused on the impact of stellar activity\nin transit photometry and RV. This phenomenon affects the determination of the\nplanet radius and mass, as well as other key parameters. I implemented two\nstarspot modeling codes into a Markov Chain Monte Carlo software, and added\nspot evolution to one of them. I applied the codes to observations of the Sun,\nCoRoT-2, and CoRoT-7. In particular, I carried out an extensive study on the\nlight curve of CoRoT-2, and explored the effects of the spots on the transit\nparameters. The planetary systems studied in this work provide further\nconstraints on models of planet interior and formation. With the techniques\nhere developed, they help in the preparation of future exoplanet surveys.\n", "  We present the basic theory governing spin-exchange pumped NMR gyros. We\nreview the basic physics of spin-exchange collisions and relaxation as they\npertain to precision NMR. We present a simple model of operation as an NMR\noscillator and use it to analyze the dynamic response and noise properties of\nthe oscillator. We discuss the primary systematic errors (differential alkali\nfields, quadrupole shifts, and offset drifts) that limit the bias stability,\nand discuss methods to minimize them. We give with a brief overview of a\npractical implementation and performance of an NMR gyro built by\nNorthrop-Grumman Corporation, and conclude with some comments about future\nprospects.\n", "  To optimize the design of STT-MRAM (spin-transfer torque magnetic random\naccess memory), it is necessary to be able to predict switching (error) rates.\nFor small elements, this can be done using a single-macrospin theory since the\nelement will switch quasi-uniformly. Experimental results on switching rates\nsuggest that elements large enough to be thermally stable switch by some\nmechanism with a lower energy barrier. It has been suggested that this\nmechanism is local nucleation, but we have also previously reported a global\nmagnetostatic instability, which is consistent with the lower experimental\nenergy barriers. In this paper, we try to determine which of these mechanisms\nis most important by visualizing the switching in a \"U-NU\" (uniform -\nnonuniform) phase diagram. We find that switching trajectories follow the\nhorizontal U axis (i.e., quasi-uniform precession) until they reach a critical\namplitude, at which the magnetostatic instability grows exponentially and a\ndomain wall forms at the center, whose motion completes the switching. We have\ntried unsuccessfully to induce local nucleation (a domain wall at the edge). We\nconclude that the dominant switching mechanism is not edge nucleation, but the\nmagnetostatic instability.\n", "  Recent experiments have reported on controlled nucleation of individual\nskyrmions in chiral magnets. Here we show that in magnetic ultra-thin films\nwith interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, single skyrmions of\ndifferent radii can be nucleated by creating a local distortion in the magnetic\nfield. In our study, we have considered zero temperature quantum nucleation of\na single skyrmion from a ferromagnetic phase. The physical scenario we model is\none where a uniform field stabilizes the ferromagnet, and an opposing local\nmagnetic field over a circular spot, generated by the tip of a local probe,\ndrives the skyrmion nucleation. Using spin path integrals and a collective\ncoordinate approximation, the tunneling rate from the ferromagnetic to the\nsingle skyrmion state is computed as a function of the tip's magnetic field and\nthe circular spot radius. Suitable parameters for the observation of the\nquantum nucleation of single skyrmions are identified.\n", "  We have found that CeCd$_{3}$P$_{3}$ crystallizes into a hexagonal\nScAl$_{3}$C$_{3}$-type structure. The optical, transport and magnetic\nproperties of CeCd$_{3}$P$_{3}$ were investigated by measuring the diffuse\nreflectance, electrical resistivity and magnetization. CeCd$_{3}$P$_{3}$ is a\nsemiconductor with the fundamental band gap of approximately 0.75 eV. The 4$f$\nelectrons of Ce$^{3+}$ ions are well localized but do not show long range order\ndown to 0.48 K, presumably due to the geometrical frustration of Ce atoms. The\nmagnetic ordering temperature is possibly lower than that of isostructural\nCeZn$_{3}$P$_{3}$ (0.75 K). Because several $f$-electron compounds with the\nScAl$_{3}$C$_{3}$-type structure are quantum spin systems, CeCd$_{3}$P$_{3}$\nmay be a candidate of quantum spin liquid. On the other hand, the relatively\nlarge band gap compared to approximately 0.4 eV in CeZn$_{3}$P$_{3}$, would not\nbe intimate with the observation of photoinduced Kondo effect, providing a\npotentially new range of applications of devices based on the Kondo effect.\n", "  This paper outlines how the new GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky MWA Survey\n(GLEAM, Wayth et al. 2015), observed by the Murchison Widefield Array covering\nthe frequency range 72 - 231 MHz, allows identification of a new large,\ncomplete, sample of more than 2000 bright extragalactic radio sources selected\nat 151 MHz. With a flux density limit of 4 Jy this sample is significantly\nlarger than the canonical fully-complete sample, 3CRR (Laing, Riley & Longair\n1983). In analysing this small bright subset of the GLEAM survey we are also\nproviding a first user check of the GLEAM catalogue ahead of its public release\n(Hurley-Walker et al. in prep). Whilst significant work remains to fully\ncharacterise our new bright source sample, in time it will provide important\nconstraints to evolutionary behaviour, across a wide redshift and intrinsic\nradio power range, as well as being highly complementary to results from\ntargeted, small area surveys.\n", "  We propose a modification of the embedded-atom method-type potential aiming\nat reconciling simulated melting and ground-state properties of metals by means\nof classical molecular dynamics. Considering titanium, magnesium, gold, and\nplatinum as case studies, we demonstrate that simulations performed with the\nmodified force field yield quantitatively correctly both the melting\ntemperature of the metals and their ground-state properties. It is shown that\nthe accounting for the long-range interatomic interactions noticeably affect\nthe melting point assessment. The introduced modification weakens the\ninteraction at interatomic distances exceeding the equilibrium one by a\ncharacteristic vibration amplitude defined by the Lindemann criterion, thus\nallowing for the correct simulation of melting, while keeping its behavior in\nthe vicinity of the ground state minimum. The modification of the many-body\npotential has a general nature and can be applicable to metals with different\ncharacteristics of the electron structure as well as for many different\nmolecular and solid state systems experiencing phase transitions.\n", "  We begin by providing observational evidence that the probability of\nencountering very high and very low annual tropical rainfall has increased\nsignificantly in the recent decade (1998-present) as compared to the preceding\nwarming era (1979-1997). These changes over land and ocean are spatially\ncoherent and comprise of a rearrangement of very wet regions and a systematic\nexpansion of dry zones. While the increased likelihood of extremes is\nconsistent with a higher average temperature during the pause (as compared to\n1979-1997), it is important to note that the periods considered are also\ncharacterized by a transition from a relatively warm to cold phase of the El\nNino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). To further probe the relation between\ncontrasting phases of ENSO and extremes in accumulation, a similar comparison\nis performed between 1960-1978 (another extended cold phase of ENSO) and the\naforementioned warming era. Though limited by land-only observations, in this\ncold-to-warm transition, remarkably, a near-exact reversal of extremes is noted\nboth statistically and geographically. This is despite the average temperature\nbeing higher in 1979-1997 as compared to 1960-1978. Taken together, we propose\nthat there is a fundamental mode of natural variability, involving the waxing\nand waning of extremes in accumulation of global tropical rainfall with\ndifferent phases of ENSO.\n", "  We report on 31P-NMR studies of LaFe(As_{1-x}P_x)(O_{1-y}F_{y}) over wide\ncompositions for 0<x<1 and 0<y<0.14, which provide clear evidence that\nantiferromagnetic spin fluctuations (AFMSFs) are one of the indispensable\nelements for enhancing Tc. Systematic 31P-NMR measurements revealed two types\nof AFMSFs in the temperature evolution, that is, one is the AFMSFs that develop\nrapidly down to Tc with low-energy characteristics, and the other, with\nrelatively higher energy than the former, develops gradually upon cooling from\nhigh temperature. The low-energy AFMSFs in low y (electron doping) over a wide\nx (pnictogen height suppression) range are associated with the two orbitals of\nd_{xz/yz}, whereas the higher-energy ones for a wide y region around low x\noriginate from the three orbitals of d_{xy} and d_{xz/yz}. We remark that the\nnonmonotonic variation of Tc as a function of x and y in\nLaFe(As_{1-x}P_x)(O_{1-y}F_y) is attributed to these multiple AFMSFs\noriginating from degenerated multiple 3d orbitals inherent to Fe-pnictide\nsuperconductors.\n", "  We demonstrate a novel method to assemble and transport swarms of colloidal\nparticles by combining liquid crystals enabled electrophoresis and\nphoto-sensitive surface patterning. Colloidal particles are propelled in a\nnematic liquid crystal via application of an alternating current electric\nfield. Swarms of particles are assembled into a rotating mill cluster, or moved\nas a whole along predefined paths photo-imprinted on chemically functionalized\nsubstrates. This technique represents an alternative approach to fluid based\nlab-on-a-chip technologies guiding the motion of large ensembles of micrometer\nscale solid or liquid inclusions.\n", "  We empirical study the signs' property in the directed signed social networks\nof Slashdot and Epinions by using an reshuffled approach. Through calculating\nthe entropy $S_{out}$ and the giant component $G$, we find an interesting 90/10\nphenomenon: each individual labels his/her neighbors as friends with $90\\%$ or\nfoes with $10\\%$ uniformly random from the macroscopic perspective. We also\nfind that the entropy $S_{out}$ is suppressed by the non-randomness of labeling\nsign. Our present work can prove how do the randomness and the non-randomness\ncoexist in human behavior of labeling signs, qualitatively.\n", "  We present the computation of Higgs boson plus one jet production at NNLO at\nthe LHC. The computation is carried out in the heavy-top-quark approximation\nand using the antenna subtraction formalism to handle the IR divergent\nstructure of the individual contributions. All channels and all colours are\nincluded. We illustrate aspects of the subtraction formalism and present\nresults for the total cross section as well as distributions in the kinematical\nvariables using a realistic experimental setting. We make a comparison between\nour results and recent ATLAS data for $H+j$ production.\n", "  Based on relativistic wavefunctions from multiconfigurational\nDirac-Hartree-Fock (MCDHF) and configuration interaction calculations, energy\nlevels, radiative rates, and wavelengths are evaluated for all levels of\n3s$^2$3p, 3s3p$^2$, 3s$^2$3d, 3p$^3$, 3s3p3d, 3p$^2$3d and 3s3d$^2$\nconfigurations of Al-like Molybdenum ion (Mo XXX). Transition probabilities are\nreported for E1 and M2 transitions from the ground level. The valence-valence\nand core-valence correlation effects are accounted for in a systematic way.\nBreit interactions and quantum electrodynamics effects are estimated in\nsubsequent relativistic configuration interaction calculations. Comparisons are\nmade with the available data in the literature and good agreement has been\nfound which confirms the reliability of our results.\n", "  Graphene plasmons are of remarkable features that make graphene plasmon\nelements promising for applications to integrated photonic devices. The\nfabrication of graphene plasmon components and control over plasmon propagating\nare of fundamental important. Through near-field plasmon imaging, we\ndemonstrate controllable modifying of the reflection of graphene plasmon at\nboundaries etched by ion beams. Moreover, by varying ion dose at a proper\nvalue, nature like reflection boundary can be obtained. We also investigate the\ninfluence of ion beam incident angle on plasmon reflection. To illustrate the\napplication of ion beam etching, a simple graphene wedge-shape plasmon\nstructure is fabricated and performs excellently, proving this technology as a\nsimple and efficient tool for controlling graphene plasmons.\n", "  Terahertz near fields of gold metamaterials resonant at a frequency of\n$0.88\\,\\rm THz$ allow us to enter an extreme limit of non-perturbative\nultrafast THz electronics: Fields reaching a ponderomotive energy in the keV\nrange are exploited to drive nondestructive, quasi-static interband tunneling\nand impact ionization in undoped bulk GaAs, injecting electron-hole plasmas\nwith densities in excess of $10^{19}\\,\\rm cm^{-3}$. This process causes bright\nluminescence at energies up to $0.5\\,\\rm eV$ above the band gap and induces a\ncomplete switch-off of the metamaterial resonance accompanied by self-amplitude\nmodulation of transmitted few-cycle THz transients. Our results pave the way\ntowards highly nonlinear THz optics and optoelectronic nanocircuitry with\nsub-picosecond switching times.\n", "  After advent of graphene as a saturable absorber many experiments have been\nconducted to produce short pulse duration pulses. Here, we have measured the\nproperties of flake-graphene saturable absorber mirrors of various flake sizes\ndependent on fabrication technique. These mirrors enabled us to obtain a large\nmode-locking bandwidth of 16nm in an erbium-doped fiber laser. Mirrors with\nlarge flake size and multi-layered thickness induce strong pulse shaping and\nreflect mode-locked train of pulses with very large bandwidths.\n", "  Population synthesis studies into planet formation have suggested that\ndistributions consistent with observations can only be reproduced if the actual\nType I migration timescale is at least an order of magnitude longer than that\ndeduced from linear theories. Although past studies considered the effect of\nthe Type I migration of protoplanetary embryos, in most cases they used a\nconventional formula based on static torques in isothermal disks, and employed\na reduction factor to account for uncertainty in the mechanism details.\nHowever, in addition to static torques, a migrating planet experiences dynamic\ntorques that are proportional to the migration rate. These dynamic torques can\nimpact on planet migration and predicted planetary populations. In this study,\nwe derived a new torque formula for Type I migration by taking into account\ndynamic corrections. This formula was used to perform population synthesis\nsimulations with and without the effect of dynamic torques. In many cases,\ninward migration was slowed significantly by the dynamic effects. For the\nstatic torque case, gas giant formation was effectively suppressed by Type I\nmigration; however, when dynamic effects were considered, a substantial\nfraction of cores survived and grew into gas giants.\n", "  Our goal is to investigate the spiral structure of the Northern Galactic\nplane using as tracers the classical Be stars detected by INT Photometric\nH$\\alpha$ Survey (IPHAS). IPHAS scans the $29^o<l<+215^o, -5^o<b<+5^o$ region\nin the $r$, $i$ and H$\\alpha$ bands. Spectroscopic follow up has been done for\nthe bright H$\\alpha$ emitters. We have developed an automatic procedure for\nspectral analysis, based on the BCD spectrophotometric system. In this paper we\npresent a cataloque of 1135 Classical Be stars, for which we have determined\nspectral types, astrophysical parameters and distances. From these results we\nmake a first attempt to map the structure of the Galactic disk in the\nanticenter direction.\n", "  Numerical Simulations are employed to create amorphous nano-films of a chosen\nthickness on a crystalline substrate which induces strain on the film. The\nfilms are grown by a vapor deposition technique which was recently developed to\ncreate very stable glassy films. Using the exact relations between the Hessian\nmatrix and the shear and bulk moduli we explore the mechanical properties of\nthe nano-films as a function of the density of the substrate and the film\nthickness. The existence of the substrate dominates the mechanical properties\nof the combined substrate-film system. Scaling concepts are then employed to\nachieve data collapse in a wide range of densities and film thicknesses.\n", "  The events of anomalous energy deposit and high number of hadrons in hadron\ncalorimeter, often not accompanied at all, or accompanied by very small EAS of\ncosmic rays, are observed by means of the complex installation aimed at\nresearch of cosmic rays. The data quoted and their analysis point to the real\ncontribution and the essential role of pion Bose condensation in high energy\nnuclear interactions. The possibility of the existence of such process in the\nnuclear matter (in the neutron stars and in some kinds of the nuclei) was\nproposed by A.B.Migdal in 1971.\n", "  In this work, the effect of fluctuations in a disordered square lattice on\ndiffusion of a test particle is studied using kinetic Monte Carlo simulations.\nDiffusion is relevant to a wide variety of problems, both within physics and\noutside of physics. Kinetic effects in diffusion are often hidden in a\nthermodynamical description of the problem. In this work, no assumptions based\non energy are made, and diffusion occurs purely based on the attempt rate of\nthe test particle and the occupation and fluctuation rate of the lattice.\nAlthough the average transition rate of the particle is the same for a static\nor fluctuating lattice with specific occupation, the diffusion constant is\nkinetically affected in a fluctuating, disordered lattice. If the lattice\nfluctuates faster than the attempt rate of the particle, diffusion is\ncontrolled by the attempt rate of the particle. However, if the lattice\nfluctuates slower than the attempt rate of the particle, diffusion is affected\nby the fluctuations. The slower the lattice fluctuates, the lower the diffusion\nconstant. Furthermore, it is found that for fast fluctuating lattices,\ndiffusion is due to Brownian motion. If the lattice fluctuates slower than the\nparticle, diffusion becomes anomalous depending on the occupation of the\nlattice.\n", "  Attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy has thus far been lacking the\ncapability to simultaneously characterize the intense laser pulses at work\nwithin a time-resolved quantum-dynamics experiment. However, precise knowledge\nof these pulses is key to extracting quantitative information in strong-field\nhighly nonlinear light-matter interactions. Here, we introduce and\nexperimentally demonstrate an ultrafast metrology tool based on the\ntime-delay-dependent phase shift imprinted on a strong-field driven resonance.\nSince we analyze the signature of the laser pulse interacting with the\nabsorbing spectroscopy target, the laser pulse duration and intensity are\ndetermined in situ. As we also show, this approach allows for the\nquantification of time-dependent bound-state dynamics in one and the same\nexperiment. In the future, such experimental data will facilitate more precise\ntests of strong-field dynamics theories.\n", "  Nowadays there is compelling evidence for the existence of dark matter in the\nUniverse. A general consensus has been expressed on the need for a directional\nsensitive detector to confirm, with a complementary approach, the candidates\nfound in conventional searches and to finally extend their sensitivity beyond\nthe limit of neutrino-induced background. We propose here the use of a detector\nbased on nuclear emulsions to measure the direction of WIMP-induced nuclear\nrecoils. The production of nuclear emulsion films with nanometric grains is\nestablished. Several measurement campaigns have demonstrated the capability of\ndetecting sub-micrometric tracks left by low energy ions in such emulsion\nfilms. Innovative analysis technologies with fully automated optical\nmicroscopes have made it possible to achieve the track reconstruction for path\nlengths down to one hundred nanometers and there are good prospects to further\nexceed this limit. The detector concept we propose foresees the use of a bulk\nof nuclear emulsion films surrounded by a shield from environmental\nradioactivity, to be placed on an equatorial telescope in order to cancel out\nthe effect of the Earth rotation, thus keeping the detector at a fixed\norientation toward the expected direction of galactic WIMPs. We report the\nschedule and cost estimate for a one-kilogram mass pilot experiment, aiming at\ndelivering the first results on the time scale of six years.\n", "  A rechargeable lithium metal battery (LMB), which uses metallic lithium at\nthe anode, is among the most promising technologies for next generation\nelectrochemical energy storage devices due to its high energy density,\nparticularly when Li is paired with energetic conversion cathodes such as\nsulfur, oxygen/air, and carbon dioxide. Practical LMBs in any of these designs\nremain elusive due to multiple stubborn problems, including parasitic reactions\nof Li metal with liquid electrolytes, unstable/dendritic electrodeposition at\nthe anode during cell recharge, and chemical reaction of dissolved cathode\nconversion products with the Li anode. The solid electrolyte interface (SEI)\nformed between lithium metal and liquid electrolytes plays a critical role in\nall of these processes. We report on the chemistry and interfacial properties\nof artificial SEI films created by in-situ reaction of a strong Lewis Acid AlI3\nadditive, Li metal, and aprotic liquid electrolytes. We find that these SEI\nfilms impart exceptional interfacial stability to a Li metal anode. We further\nshow that the improvements come from at least three processes: (i) in-situ\nformation of Li-Al alloy, (ii) formation of a LiI salt layer on Li, and (iii)\ncreation of a stable polymer thin film on the lithium metal anode.\n", "  The atomic mass difference of 163Ho and 163Dy has been directly measured with\nthe Penning trap mass spectrometer SHIPTRAP applying the novel phase imaging\nion cyclotron resonance technique. Our measurement has solved the long standing\nproblem of large discrepancies in the Q value of the electron capture in 163Ho\ndetermined by different techniques. Our measured mass difference shifts the\ncurrent Q value of 2555(16) eV evaluated in the Atomic Mass Evaluation 2012 [G.\nAudi et al., Chin. Phys. C 36, 1157 (2012)] by more than 7 sigma to\n2833(30stat)(15sys) eV/c2. With the new mass difference it will be possible,\ne.g., to reach in the first phase of the ECHo experiment a statistical\nsensitivity to the neutrino mass below 10 eV, which will reduce its present\nupper limit by more than an order of magnitude.\n", "  The finite element method is applied to obtain numerical solutions to the\nrecently derived nonlinear equation for shallow water wave problem for several\ncases of bottom shapes. Results for time evolution of KdV solitons and cnoidal\nwaves under stochastic forces are presented. Though small effects originating\nfrom second order dynamics may be obscured by stochastic forces, the main\nwaves, both cnoidal and solitary ones, remain very robust against any\ndistortions.\n", "  The Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique is a powerful, widely used method for\npreparing coatings of amphiphilic molecules at air/water interfaces with\nthickness control down to a single molecule. Here we report two new LB\ntechniques designed to create ordered, multifunctional nanoparticle films on\nany non-reactive support. The methods utilize Marangoni stresses produced by\nsurfactants at a fluid/solid/gas interface and self-assembly of nanoparticles\nto facilitate rapid creation of dense monolayers of multi-wall carbon nanotubes\n(MWCNT), metal-oxide nanoparticles, polymers, and combinations of these\nmaterials in a layer-by-layer configuration. Using the polyolefin separator in\na lithium sulfur (Li-S) electrochemical cell as an example, we illustrate how\nthe method can be used to create structured membranes for regulating mass and\ncharge transport. We show that a layered MWCNT/SiO2/MWCNT nanomaterial created\nin a clip-like configuration, with gravimetric areal coverage of ~130 mg cm-2\nand a thickness of ~3 micron, efficiently adsorbs dissolved lithium polysulfide\n(LiPS) species and efficiently reutilize them for improving Li-S battery\nperformance.\n", "  When evolutionary games are contested in structured populations, the degree\nof each player in the network plays an important role. If they exist, hubs\noften determine the fate of the population in remarkable ways. Recent research\nbased on optimal percolation in random networks has shown, however, that the\ndegree is neither the sole nor the best predictor of influence in complex\nnetworks. Low-degree nodes may also be optimal influencers if they are\nhierarchically linked to hubs. Taking this into account leads to the formalism\nof collective influence in complex networks, which as we show here, has\nfar-reaching implications for the favorable resolution of social dilemmas. In\nparticular, there exists an optimal hierarchical depth for the determination of\ncollective influence that we use to describe the potency of players for passing\ntheir strategies, which depends on the strength of the social dilemma.\nInterestingly, the degree, which corresponds to the baseline depth zero, is\noptimal only when the temptation to defect is small. Our research reveals that\nevolutionary success stories are related to spreading processes which are\nrooted in favorable hierarchical structures that extend beyond local\nneighborhoods.\n", "  We report the magnetoresistance, magnetothermopower and quantum oscillation\nstudy of Sb$_2$Te$_2$Se single crystal. The in-plane transverse\nmagnetoresistance exhibits a crossover at a critical field $B^*$ from\nsemiclassical weak-field $B^2$ dependence to the high-field unsaturated linear\nmagnetoresistance which persists up to the room temperature. The\nlow-temperature Seebeck coefficient is negative in zero field contrary to the\npositive Hall resistivity, indicating the multiband effect. The magnetic field\ninduced the sign reversion of the Seebeck coefficient between 2 K and 150 K, .\nThe quantum oscillation of crystals reveals the quasi-two-dimensional\n(quasi-2D) Fermi surface. These effects are possibly attributed to the large\nFermi surface which touches Brillouin zone boundary to becomes quasi-2D and the\nvariation in the chemical potential induced by the magnetic field.\n"]}
