Math. Phys.) on small diameter asymptotics for solutions of\nthe Helmgoltz equation in networks of thin fibers. The present paper contains a\ndetailed review of these results under some assumptions which make them much\nmore transparent. It also contains several new theorems on the structure of the\nspectrum near the threshold. small diameter asymptotics of the resolvent, and\nsolutions of the evolution equation.\n", "  These classical inequalities allow one to estimate the number of negative\neigenvalues and the sums $S_{\\gamma}=\\sum |\\lambda_i|^{\\gamma}$ for a wide\nclass of Schr\\\"{o}dinger operators. We provide a detailed proof of these\ninequalities for operators on functions in metric spaces using the classical\nLieb approach based on the Kac-Feynman formula. The main goal of the paper is a\nnew set of examples which include perturbations of the Anderson operator,\noperators on free, nilpotent and solvable groups, operators on quantum graphs,\nMarkov processes with independent increments. The study of the examples\nrequires an exact estimate of the kernel of the corresponding parabolic\nsemigroup on the diagonal. In some cases the kernel decays exponentially as\n$t\\to \\infty $. This allows us to consider very slow decaying potentials and\nobtain some results that are precise in the logarithmical scale.\n", "  The paper contains a simplified and improved version of the results obtained\nby the authors earlier. Wave propagation is discussed in a network of branched\nthin wave guides when the thickness vanishes and the wave guides shrink to a\none dimensional graph. It is shown that asymptotically one can describe the\npropagating waves, the spectrum and the resolvent in terms of solutions of\nordinary differential equations on the limiting graph. The vertices of the\ngraph correspond to junctions of the wave guides. In order to determine the\nsolutions of the ODE on the graph uniquely, one needs to know the gluing\nconditions (GC) on the vertices of the graph.\n  Unlike other publications on this topic, we consider the situation when the\nspectral parameter is greater than the threshold, i.e., the propagation of\nwaves is possible in cylindrical parts of the network. We show that the GC in\nthis case can be expressed in terms of the scattering matrices related to\nindividual junctions. The results are extended to the values of the spectral\nparameter below the threshold and around it.\n", "  We will discuss a one-dimensional approximation for the problem of wave\npropagation in networks of thin fibers. The main objective here is to describe\nthe boundary (gluing) conditions at branching points of the limiting\none-dimensional graph. The results will be applied to Mach-Zehnder\ninterferometers on chips and to periodic chains of the interferometers. The\nlatter allows us to find parameters which guarantee the transparency and\nslowing down of wave packets.\n", "  The Anderson Hamiltonian $H_0=-\\Delta+V(x,\\omega)$ is considered, where $V$\nis a random potential of Bernoulli type. The operator $H_0$ is perturbed by a\nnon-random, continuous potential $-w(x) \\leq 0$, decaying at infinity. It will\nbe shown that the borderline between finitely, and infinitely many negative\neigenvalues of the perturbed operator, is achieved with a decay of the\npotential $-w(x)$ as $O(\\ln^{-2/d} |x|)$.\n", "  Finding all Bell inequalities for a given number of parties, measurement\nsettings, and measurement outcomes is in general a computationally hard task.\nWe show that all Bell inequalities which are symmetric under the exchange of\nparties can be found by examining a symmetrized polytope which is simpler than\nthe full Bell polytope. As an illustration of our method, we generate 238885\nnew Bell inequalities and 1085 new Svetlichny inequalities. We find, in\nparticular, facet inequalities for Bell experiments involving two parties and\ntwo measurement settings that are not of the\nCollins-Gisin-Linden-Massar-Popescu type.\n", "  The paper concerns upper and lower estimates for the number of negative\neigenvalues of one- and two-dimensional Schr\\\"{o}dinger operators and more\ngeneral operators with the spectral dimensions $d\\leq 2$. The classical\nCwikel-Lieb-Rosenblum (CLR) upper estimates require the corresponding Markov\nprocess to be transient, and therefore the dimension to be greater than two. We\nobtain CLR estimates in low dimensions by transforming the underlying recurrent\nprocess into a transient one using partial annihilation. As a result, the\nestimates for the number of negative eigenvalues are not translation invariant\nand contain Bargmann type terms. The general theorems are illustrated by\nanalysis of several classes of the Schr\\\"{o}dinger type operators (on the\nRiemannian manifolds, lattices, fractals, etc.). We provide estimates from\nbelow which prove that the results obtained are sharp. Lieb-Thirring estimates\nfor the low-dimensional Schr\\\"{o}dinger operators are also studied.\n", "  Recently (see Molchanov & Vainberg 2011), two of the authors applied the Lieb\nmethod to the study of the negative spectrum for particular operators of the\nform $H=H_0-W$. Here, $H_0$ is the generator of the positive stochastic (or\nsub-stochastic) semigroup, $W(x) \\geq 0$ and $W(x) \\to 0$ as $x \\to \\infty$ on\nsome phase space $X$. They used the general results in several \"exotic\"\nsituations, among them the Anderson Hamiltonian $H_0$. In the 1-d case, the\nsubject of the present paper, we will prove similar but more precise results.\n", "  This paper is devoted to the spectral theory of the Schr\\\"{o}dinger operator\non the simplest fractal: Dyson's hierarchical lattice. An explicit description\nof the spectrum, eigenfunctions, resolvent and parabolic kernel are provided\nfor the unperturbed operator, i.e., for the Dyson hierarchical Laplacian.\nPositive spectrum is studied for the perturbations of the hierarchical\nLaplacian. Since the spectral dimension of the operator under consideration can\nbe an arbitrary positive number, the model allows a continuous phase transition\nfrom recurrent to transient underlying Markov process. This transition is also\nstudied in the paper.\n", "  We present a proof that every star-product defined on a Poisson manifold and\nwritten in a given quantum canonical coordinate system is uniquely equivalent\nwith a Moyal product associated with this coordinate system. The equivalence is\nassumed to satisfy some additional conditions which guarantee its uniqueness.\nMoreover, the systematic construction of such equivalence is presented and a\nformula for this equivalence in a case of a particular class of star-products\nis given, to the fourth order in $\\hbar$.\n", "  A highly intriguing aspect in iron-pnictide superconductors is the\ncomposition-dependent electronic structure, in particular the question if and\nhow charge carriers are introduced to the system upon substitution of Ba by\nalkali metals or of Fe by other transition metals, TM. We report on a\nsystematic study of spatial structure and electronic states by x-ray\ndiffraction and x-ray absorption on a large number of compositions in the\n(Ba,K)(Fe,TM)2As2 family. The coherent combination of detailed structural\ninformation with an in-depth analysis of the electronic structure allows us to\nsensitively disentangle (charge-carrier) \"doping\" effects from \"substitutional\"\neffects. Results include a doping character that is site-decoupled, as well as\nTM 3d energy-level schemes that exhibit non-standard level sequences and even\nt2-e level crossings. Our study indicates that doping per se seems to play a\nlesser role than expected for pnictide superconductivity and magnetism.\n", "  We present some accurate and efficient computations of large scale structure\nobservables, obtained with a modified version of the CLASS code which is made\npublicly available. This code includes all relativistic corrections and\ncomputes both the power spectrum Cl(z1,z2) and the corresponding correlation\nfunction xi(theta,z1,z2) in linear perturbation theory. For Gaussian initial\nperturbations, these quantities contain the full information encoded in the\nlarge scale matter distribution at the level of linear perturbation theory. We\nillustrate the usefulness of our code for cosmological parameter estimation\nthrough a few simple examples.\n", "  We estimate the sensitivity of future galaxy surveys to cosmological\nparameters, using the redshift dependent angular power spectra of galaxy number\ncounts, $C_\\ell(z_1,z_2)$, calculated with all relativistic corrections at\nfirst order in perturbation theory. We pay special attention to the redshift\ndependence of the non-linearity scale and present Fisher matrix forecasts for\nEuclid-like and DES-like galaxy surveys. We compare the standard $P(k)$\nanalysis with the new $C_\\ell(z_1,z_2)$ method. We show that for surveys with\nphotometric redshifts the new analysis performs significantly better than the\n$P(k)$ analysis. For spectroscopic redshifts, however, the large number of\nredshift bins which would be needed to fully profit from the redshift\ninformation, is severely limited by shot noise. We also identify surveys which\ncan measure the lensing contribution and we study the monopole, $C_0(z_1,z_2)$.\n", "  We provide an overview of our numerical and analytical studies of isolated\ninteracting quantum systems that are quenched out of equilibrium\ninstantaneously. We describe the relaxation process to a new equilibrium and\nobtain lower bounds for the relaxation time of full random matrices and\nrealistic systems with two-body interactions. We show that the size of the time\nfluctuations after relaxation decays exponentially with system size for systems\nwithout too many degeneracies. We also discuss the conditions for\nthermalization and demonstrate that it can happen after local and global\nquenches in space. The analyses are developed for systems, initial states, and\nfew-body observables accessible to experiments with optical lattices.\n", "  Considerations of the bad-metal behavior led to an early proposal for a\nquantum critical point under a P for As doping in the iron pnictides, which has\nsince been experimentally observed. We study here an effective model for the\nisoelectronically tuned pnictides using a large-$N$ approach. The model\ncontains antiferromagnetic and Ising-nematic order parameters appropriate for\n$J_1$-$J_2$ exchange-coupled local moments on an Fe square lattice, and a\ndamping caused by coherent itinerant electrons. The zero-temperature magnetic\nand Ising transitions are concurrent and essentially continuous. The\norder-parameter jumps are very small, and are further reduced by the\ninter-plane coupling; quantum criticality hence occurs over a wide dynamical\nrange. Our results provide the basis for further studies on the quantum\ncritical properties in the P-doped iron arsenides.\n", "  Penrose tilings form lattices, exhibiting 5-fold symmetry and isotropic\nelasticity, with inhomogeneous coordination much like that of the force\nnetworks in jammed systems. Under periodic boundary conditions, their average\ncoordination is exactly four. We study the elastic and vibrational properties\nof rational approximants to these lattices as a function of unit-cell size\n$N_S$ and find that they have of order $\\sqrt{N_S}$ zero modes and states of\nself stress and yet all their elastic moduli vanish. In their generic form\nobtained by randomizing site positions, their elastic and vibrational\nproperties are similar to those of particulate systems at jamming with a\nnonzero bulk modulus, vanishing shear modulus, and a flat density of states.\n", "  Humans are social animals, they interact with different communities of\nfriends to conduct different activities. The literature shows that human\nmobility is constrained by their social relations. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the social impact of a person's communities on his mobility,\ninstead of all friends from his online social networks. This study can be\nparticularly useful, as certain social behaviors are influenced by specific\ncommunities but not all friends. To achieve our goal, we first develop a\nmeasure to characterize a person's social diversity, which we term `community\nentropy'. Through analysis of two real-life datasets, we demonstrate that a\nperson's mobility is influenced only by a small fraction of his communities and\nthe influence depends on the social contexts of the communities. We then\nexploit machine learning techniques to predict users' future movement based on\ntheir communities' information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\nprediction's effectiveness.\n", "  A new doping mechanism is described, whereby a doping impurity does not\nsimply transfer charge to the bands of a host semiconductor or semimetal, but\nrearranges the core energy levels deep in the valence band of the host. This,\nin turn, leads to a redistribution of all electrons in the host, and, if\ndesigned properly, changes the location of the Fermi level EF and the density\nof conducting charge carriers near EF. The principle is proven experimentally\nin elemental Bi, whereby group III elements In and Ga dope Bi p-type, in spite\nof the fact that all three atoms are trivalent in the solid state. Electronic\nstructure calculations show the formation of a hyperdeep defect state (HDS) and\nits effect on the EF in Bi doped with In (Bi:In) and Ga (Bi:Ga). The HDS at -5\nto -6 eV below the EF of elemental Bi hybridizes with the Bi 6p electrons, and\ndeprives the Bi valence band of two electrons per impurity atom. This then\nperturbs the electron count in the solid and lowers the EF. The charge on the\nimpurity atoms is unchanged. In principle, this doping action does not result\nin the appearance of ionized impurities that scatter conduction electrons and\nholes in conventional doping. Experimentally, Shubnikov - de Haas and Hall\nEffect measurements show that adding In to Bi results in an increase in the\ndensity of holes. Thermoelectric, galvanomagnetic and thermomagnetic data are\ngiven for single-crystal and polycrystalline samples. In-doping leads to an\nenhancement of the thermoelectric figure of merit, which suggests that the new\ndoping mechanism also gives a route to develop better thermoelectric materials.\nThe same mechanism is at work for Sn-doped Bi (Bi:Sn), although here ionized\nimpurity scattering is not avoided.\n", "  Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is a fundamental interaction in solids which can\ninduce a broad spectrum of unusual physical properties from topologically\nnon-trivial insulating states to unconventional pairing in superconductors. In\niron-based superconductors (IBS) its role has so far been considered\ninsignificant with the models based on spin- or orbital fluctuations pairing\nbeing the most advanced in the field. Using angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy we directly observe a sizeable spin-orbit splitting in all main\nfamilies of IBS. We demonstrate that its impact on the low-energy electronic\nstructure and details of the Fermi surface topology is much stronger than that\nof possible nematic ordering. Intriguingly, the largest pairing gap is always\nsupported exactly by SOC-induced Fermi surfaces.\n", "  Optical properties of colloidal plasmonic titanium nitride nanoparticles are\nexamined with an eye on their photothermal via transmission electron microscopy\nand optical transmittance measurements. Single crystal titanium nitride cubic\nnanoparticles with an average size of 50 nm exhibit plasmon resonance in the\nbiological transparency window. With dimensions optimized for efficient\ncellular uptake, the nanoparticles demonstrate a high photothermal conversion\nefficiency. A self-passivating native oxide at the surface of the nanoparticles\nprovides an additional degree of freedom for surface functionalization.\n", "  Soft-photon emission rates are calculated within the linear sigma model. The\ninvestigation is aimed at answering the question to which extent the\nemissivities map out the phase structure of this particular effective model of\nstrongly interacting matter.\n", "  Over the past few decades the notion of symmetry has played a major role in\nphysics and in the philosophy of physics. Philosophers have used symmetry to\ndiscuss the ontology and seeming objectivity of the laws of physics. We\nintroduce several notions of symmetry in mathematics and explain how they can\nalso be used in resolving different problems in the philosophy of mathematics.\nWe use symmetry to discuss the objectivity of mathematics, the role of\nmathematical objects, the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics and the\nrelationship of mathematics to physics.\n", "  Our work sheds new light on the role of oil prices in shaping the world\neconomy by investigating flows of goods and services through global value\nchains between 1960 and 2011, by means of Markov Chain and network analysis. We\nshow that over that time period the international division of labor and trade\npatterns are tightly linked to the price of oil. We demonstrate that this\ncorrelation does not depend on the balance of payments nor on the nominal value\nof trade or trade agreements; it is instead linked to the way the Global Value\nChains (GVCs) shape global trade. Our study suggests that transport played an\nimportant structural role in shaping GVCs.\n", "  We study the ground state fidelity, fidelity susceptibility and quench\ndynamics of the extended quantum compass model in a transverse field. This\nmodel reveals a rich phase diagram which includes several critical surfaces\ndepending on exchange couplings. We present a characterization of quantum phase\ntransitions in terms of the ground state fidelity between two ground states\nobtained for two different values of external parameters. However, we derive\nscaling relations describing the singular behavior of fidelity susceptibility\nin the quantum critical surfaces. Moreover, we study the time evolution of the\nsystem after a critical quantum quench using the Loschmidt. We find that the\nrevival times of Loschmidt echo are given by $T_{rev}=N/2v_{max}$, where $N$ is\nthe size of the system and $v_{max}$ is the maximum of lower bound group\nvelocity of quasi-particles. Although the fidelity susceptibility shows the\nsame exponent in all critical surfaces, the structure of the revivals after\ncritical quantum quenches displays two different regimes reflecting different\nequilibration dynamics.\n", "  Since its discovery in 1930, Pluto's mass has been a value that has\nrepeatedly been calculated. Additionally, the search for Planet X prior to\nPluto's discovery results in mass calculations that date back several decades\nearlier. Over its observed history, the mass of Pluto has consistently\ndecreased. We reassess earlier predictions of Pluto's fate, and rule out the\nhypothesis that Pluto's mass has been constant over the last century. We are\nable to fit linear and quadratic equations to Pluto's mass as a function of\nboth time and distance. The observations that will be made by New Horizons will\nhelp to determine if we can expect Pluto to continue to shrink until it has\nnegative mass, or if it will begin to increase in mass again.\n", "  The prospects of scaling current photovoltaic technologies to terawatt levels\nremain uncertain. All-oxide photovoltaics could open rapidly scalable\nmanufacturing routes, if only oxide materials with suitable electronic and\noptical properties were developed. A potential candidate material is tin\nmonoxide (SnO), which has exceptional doping and transport properties among\noxides, but suffers from a low adsorption coefficient due to its strongly\nindirect band gap. Here, we address this shortcoming of SnO by band-structure\nengineering through isovalent but heterostructural alloying with divalent\ncations (Mg, Ca, Sr, Zn). Using first-principles calculations, we show that\nsuitable band gaps and optical properties close to that of direct-gap\nsemiconductors are achievable in such SnO based alloys. Due to the defect\ntolerant electronic structure of SnO, the dispersive band-structure features\nand comparatively small effective masses are preserved in the alloys. Initial\nSn1-xZnxO thin films deposited by sputtering exhibit crystal structure and\noptical properties in accord with the theoretical predictions, which confirms\nthe feasibility of the alloying approach. Thus, the implications of this work\nare important not only for terawatt scale photovoltaics, but also for other\nlarge-scale energy technologies where defect-tolerant semiconductors with high\nquality electronic properties are required.\n", "  We develop a theory to address the non-equilibrium dynamics of phonons in a\none-dimensional trapped ion system. We elaborate our earlier results obtained\nin Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 111}, 170406 (2013) to chart out the mechanism of\ndynamics-induced cooling and entanglement generation between phonons in these\nsystems when subjected to a linear ramp protocol inducing site-specific tuning\nof on-site interactions between the phonons. We further extend these studies to\nnon-linear ramps and periodic drive protocols and identify the optimal ramp\nprotocol for minimal cooling and entanglement generation time. We qualitatively\naddress the effect of noise arising out of fluctuation of the intensity of the\nlaser used to generate entanglement and provide a detailed discussion of a\nrealistic experimental setup which may serve as a test bed for our theory.\n", "  We first reformulate and expand with several novel findings some of the basic\nresults in the integrability of Abel equations. Next, these results are applied\nto Vein's Abel equation whose solutions are expressed in terms of the third\norder hyperbolic functions and a phase space analysis of the corresponding\nnonlinear oscillator is also provided\n", "  Crowdsourcing is a process of accumulating the ideas, thoughts or information\nfrom many independent participants, with aim to find the best solution for a\ngiven challenge. Modern information technologies allow for massive number of\nsubjects to be involved in a more or less spontaneous way. Still, the full\npotentials of crowdsourcing are yet to be reached. We introduce a modeling\nframework through which we study the effectiveness of crowdsourcing in relation\nto the level of collectivism in facing the problem. Our findings reveal an\nintricate relationship between the number of participants and the difficulty of\nthe problem, indicating the optimal size of the crowdsourced group. We discuss\nour results in the context of modern utilization of crowdsourcing.\n", "  Information diffusion in online social networks is affected by the underlying\nnetwork topology, but it also has the power to change it. Online users are\nconstantly creating new links when exposed to new information sources, and in\nturn these links are alternating the way information spreads. However, these\ntwo highly intertwined stochastic processes, information diffusion and network\nevolution, have been predominantly studied separately, ignoring their\nco-evolutionary dynamics.\n  We propose a temporal point process model, COEVOLVE, for such joint dynamics,\nallowing the intensity of one process to be modulated by that of the other.\nThis model allows us to efficiently simulate interleaved diffusion and network\nevents, and generate traces obeying common diffusion and network patterns\nobserved in real-world networks. Furthermore, we also develop a convex\noptimization framework to learn the parameters of the model from historical\ndiffusion and network evolution traces. We experimented with both synthetic\ndata and data gathered from Twitter, and show that our model provides a good\nfit to the data as well as more accurate predictions than alternatives.\n", "  Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs) are the most attractive\nradiation detectors for far-infrared and sub-mm astronomy: They combine\nultimate sensitivity with the possibility to create very large detector arrays,\nin excess of 10 000 pixels. This is possible by reading-out the arrays using RF\nfrequency division multiplexing, which allows multiplexing ratios in excess of\n1000 pixels per readout line. We describe a novel readout system for large\narrays of MKIDs, operating in a 2 GHz band in the 4-8 GHz range. The readout,\nwhich is a combination of a digital front- and back-end and an analog up- and\ndown-converter system, can read out up to 4000 detectors simultaneously with 1\nkHz datarate. The system achieves a readout noise power spectral density of -98\ndBc/Hz while reading 1000 carriers simultaneously, which scales linear with the\nnumber of carriers. We demonstrate that 4000 state-of-the-art Aluminium-NbTiN\nMKIDs can be read out without deteriorating their intrinsic performance.\n", "  The observation by scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (STS) of Abrikosov vortex\ncores in the high-temperature superconductor YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\\delta}$ (Y123)\nhas revealed a robust pair of electron-hole symmetric states at finite subgap\nenergy. Their interpretation remains an open question because theory predicts a\ndifferent signature in the vortex cores, characterised by a strong zero-bias\nconductance peak. We present STS data on very homogeneous Y123 at 0.4 K\nrevealing that the subgap features do not belong to vortices: they are actually\nobserved everywhere along the surface with high spatial and energy\nreproducibility, even in the absence of magnetic field. Detailed analysis and\nmodelling show that these states remain unpaired in the superconducting phase\nand belong to an incoherent channel which contributes to the tunnelling signal\nin parallel with the superconducting density of states.\n", "  Self-induced flavor conversion of supernova (SN) neutrinos is a generic\nfeature of neutrino-neutrino dispersion. The corresponding run-away modes in\nflavor space can spontaneously break the original symmetries of the neutrino\nflux and in particular can spontaneously produce small-scale features as shown\nin recent schematic studies. However, the unavoidable \"multi-angle matter\neffect\" shifts these small-scale instabilities into regions of matter and\nneutrino density which are not encountered on the way out from a SN. The\ntraditional modes which are uniform on the largest scales are most prone for\ninstabilities and thus provide the most sensitive test for the appearance of\nself-induced flavor conversion. As a by-product we clarify the relation between\nthe time evolution of an expanding neutrino gas and the radial evolution of a\nstationary SN neutrino flux. Our results depend on several simplifying\nassumptions, notably stationarity of the solution, the absence of a \"backward\"\nneutrino flux caused by residual scattering, and global spherical symmetry of\nemission.\n", "  It is expected that the interplay between non-trivial band topology and\nstrong electron correlation will lead to very rich physics. Thus a controlled\nstudy of the competition between topology and correlation is of great interest.\nHere, employing large-scale quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations, we provide a\nconcrete example of the Kane-Mele-Hubbard (KMH) model on an AA stacking bilayer\nhoneycomb lattice with inter-layer antiferromagnetic interaction. Our\nsimulation identified several different phases: a quantum spin-Hall insulator\n(QSH), a $xy$-plane antiferromagnetic Mott insulator ($xy$-AFM) and an\ninter-layer dimer-singlet insulator (dimer-singlet). Most importantly, a bona\nfide topological phase transition between the QSH and the dimer-singlet\ninsulators, purely driven by the inter-layer antiferromagnetic interaction is\nfound. At the transition, the spin and charge gap of the system close while the\nsingle-particle excitations remain gapped, which means that this transition has\nno mean field analogue and it can be viewed as a transition between bosonic SPT\nstates. At one special point, this transition is described by a $(2+1)d$ $O(4)$\nnonlinear sigma model (NLSM) with {\\it exact} $SO(4)$ symmetry, and a\ntopological term at {\\it exactly} $\\Theta = \\pi$. Relevance of this work\ntowards more general interacting SPT states is discussed.\n", "  We study the asymptotic properties of the conormal cycle of nodal sets\nassociated to a random superposition of eigenfunctions of the Laplacian on a\nsmooth compact Riemannian manifold without boundary. In the case where the\ndimension is odd, we show that the expectation of the corresponding current of\nintegration equidistributes on the fibers of the cotangent bundle. In the case\nwhere the dimension is even, we obtain an upper bound of lower order on the\nexpectation. Using recent results of Alesker, we also deduce some properties on\nthe asymptotic expectation of any smooth valuation including the Euler\ncharacteristic of random nodal sets.\n", "  We report on the observation of the spin Seebeck effect in antiferromagnetic\nMnF$_2$. A device scale on-chip heater is deposited on a bilayer of Pt (4\nnm)/MnF$_2$ (110) (30 nm) grown by molecular beam epitaxy on a MgF$_2$ (110)\nsubstrate. Using Pt as a spin detector layer it is possible to measure\nthermally generated spin current from MnF$_2$ through the inverse spin Hall\neffect. The low temperature (2 - 80 K) and high magnetic field (up to 140 kOe)\nregime is explored. A clear spin flop transition corresponding to the sudden\nrotation of antiferromagnetic spins out of the easy axis is observed in the\nspin Seebeck signal when large magnetic fields (>9 T) are applied parallel the\neasy axis of the MnF$_2$ thin film. When magnetic field is applied\nperpendicular to the easy axis, the spin flop transition is absent, as\nexpected.\n", "  Numerical simulations are a versatile tool providing insight into the\ncomplicated process of structure formation in cosmology. This process is mainly\ngoverned by gravity, which is the dominant force on large scales. To date, a\ncentury after the formulation of general relativity, numerical codes for\nstructure formation still employ Newton's law of gravitation. This\napproximation relies on the two assumptions that gravitational fields are weak\nand that they are only sourced by non-relativistic matter. While the former\nappears well justified on cosmological scales, the latter imposes restrictions\non the nature of the \"dark\" components of the Universe (dark matter and dark\nenergy) which are, however, poorly understood. Here we present the first\nsimulations of cosmic structure formation using equations consistently derived\nfrom general relativity. We study in detail the small relativistic effects for\na standard {\\Lambda}CDM cosmology which cannot be obtained within a purely\nNewtonian framework. Our particle-mesh N-body code computes all six degrees of\nfreedom of the metric and consistently solves the geodesic equation for\nparticles, taking into account the relativistic potentials and the\nframe-dragging force. This conceptually clean approach is very general and can\nbe applied to various settings where the Newtonian approximation fails or\nbecomes inaccurate, ranging from simulations of models with dynamical dark\nenergy or warm/hot dark matter to core collapse supernova explosions.\n", "  Entanglement lies at the heart of quantum mechanics $-$ as a fundamental tool\nfor testing its deep rift with classical physics, while also providing a key\nresource for quantum technologies such as quantum computation and cryptography.\nIn 1987 Greenberger, Horne, and Zeilinger realized that the entanglement of\nmore than two particles implies a non-statistical conflict between local\nrealism and quantum mechanics. The resulting predictions were experimentally\nconfirmed by entangling three photons in their polarization. Experimental\nefforts since have singularly focused on increasing the number of particles\nentangled, while remaining in a two-dimensional space for each particle. Here\nwe show the experimental generation of the first multi-photon entangled state\nwhere both $-$ the number of particles and the number of dimensions $-$ are\ngreater than two. Interestingly, our state exhibits an asymmetric entanglement\nstructure that is only possible when one considers multi-particle entangled\nstates in high dimensions. Two photons in our state reside in a\nthree-dimensional space, while the third lives in two dimensions. Our method\nrelies on combining two pairs of photons, high-dimensionally entangled in their\norbital angular momentum, in such a way that information about their origin is\nerased. Additionally, we show how this state enables a new type of \"layered\"\nquantum cryptographic protocol where two parties share an additional layer of\nsecure information over that already shared by all three parties. In addition\nto their application in novel quantum communication protocols, such asymmetric\nentangled states serve as a manifestation of the complex dance of correlations\nthat can exist within quantum mechanics.\n", "  Pure Yang-Mills SU(N) theory is studied in four dimensional space and Landau\ngauge by a double perturbative expansion based on a massive free-particle\npropagator. By dimensional regularization, all diverging mass terms cancel\nexactly in the double expansion, without the need to include mass counterterms\nthat would spoil the symmetry of the original Lagrangian. The emerging\nperturbation theory is safe in the infrared and shares the same behaviour of\nthe standard perturbation theory in the UV. At one-loop, gluon and ghost\npropagators are found in excellent agreement with the data of lattice\nsimulations and an infrared-safe running coupling is derived. A natural scale\nm=0.6-0.7 GeV is extracted from the data for N=3.\n", "  The space of one-dimensional disordered interacting quantum models displaying\na Many-Body-Localization Transition seems sufficiently rich to produce critical\npoints with level statistics interpolating continuously between the Poisson\nstatistics of the Localized phase and the Wigner-Dyson statistics of the\nDelocalized Phase. In this paper, we consider the strong disorder limit of the\nMBL transition, where the critical level statistics is close to the Poisson\nstatistics. We analyse a one-dimensional quantum spin model, in order to\ndetermine the statistical properties of the rare extensive resonances that are\nneeded to destabilize the MBL phase. At criticality, we find that the\nentanglement entropy can grow with an exponent $0<\\alpha < 1$ anywhere between\nthe area law $\\alpha=0$ and the volume law $\\alpha=1$, as a function of the\nresonances properties, while the entanglement spectrum follows the strong\nmultifractality statistics. In the MBL phase near criticality, we obtain the\nsimple value $\\nu=1$ for the correlation length exponent. Independently of the\nstrong disorder limit, we explain why for the Many-Body-Localization transition\nconcerning individual eigenstates, the correlation length exponent $\\nu$ is not\nconstrained by the usual Harris inequality $\\nu \\geq 2/d$, so that there is no\ntheoretical inconsistency with the best numerical measure $\\nu = 0.8 (3)$\nobtained by D. J. Luitz, N. Laflorencie and F. Alet, Phys. Rev. B 91, 081103\n(2015).\n", "  We investigate the variation of the oscillation frequency of the Mg$^{2+}$\nand O$^{2-}$ ions in the magnesium oxide lattice due to the interactions of the\nsurface with water monolayers by means of Low Energy Electron Diffraction. Our\nkey result is a new technique to determine the adsorbate vibrations produced by\nthe water monolayers on the surface lattice as a consequence of their change in\nthe surface Debye temperature and its chemical shift. The latter was\nsystematically investigated for different annealing times and for a constant\nexternal thermal perturbation in the range of 110-300 K in order to accomplish\nadsorption or desorption of water monolayers in the surface lattice.\n", "  According to General Relativity, there are three factors namely mass,\nrotation and charge that can influence the path of light ray. Many authors\nshowed that there is another factor which can influence the path of light ray\nnamely gravitomagnetism. Here we discuss the effect of a rotating body with\nnon-zero (Kerr- Taub-NUT) magnetic field on the motion of light ray. We use the\nnull geodesic of photon method and obtain the deflection angle of light ray for\nsuch a body up to fourth order term in the equatorial plane. Our calculation\nshows that magnetism has a noticeable effect on the path of light ray. If we\nset the magnetism equal to zero, our expression of bending angle reduces to the\nKerr bending angle. However, we get non-zero bending angle for a hypothetical\nmass less, magnetic body.\n", "  Black holes are a paradigm in nowadays physics, and are expected to be hosted\nat the center of galaxies. Supermassive galactic black holes are not isolated,\nand their surroundings play crucial roles in many observational features. The\nabsorption and scattering of fields by isolated black holes have been vastly\nstudied, allowing the understanding of many phenomenological features. However,\nas far as we are aware, a study of the influence of the presence of matter\nsurrounding black holes in its planar wave scattering and absorption spectrum\nis still lacking in the literature. This may be important in the analysis of,\nfor instance, the accretion of dark matter by black holes. We consider planar\nmassless scalar waves incident upon a Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by a\nthin spherical shell. We use the partial wave method to determine the\nabsorption cross section, and present a selection of numerical results. In the\nlow-frequency regime, we show that the absorption cross section is equal to the\nhorizon area. At the high-frequency regime, we show that the absorption cross\nsection approaches the geodesic capture cross section.\n", "  We present a systematic investigation of the electrical, structural, and\nantiferromagnetic properties for the series of\nBa(Fe$_{1-x-y}$Co$_{x}$Rh$_{y}$)$_{2}$As$_{2}$ compounds with fixed $x \\approx$\n0.027 and $ 0 \\leq y \\leq 0.035$. We compare our results for the Co-Rh doped\nBa(Fe$_{1-x-y}$Co$_{x}$Rh$_{y}$)$_{2}$As$_{2}$ compounds with the Co doped\nBa(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$)$_{2}$As$_{2}$ compounds. We demonstrate that the\nelectrical, structural, antiferromangetic, and superconducting properties of\nthe Co-Rh doped compounds are similar to the properties of the Co doped\ncompounds. We find that the overall behaviors of\nBa(Fe$_{1-x-y}$Co$_{x}$Rh$_{y}$)$_{2}$As$_{2}$ and\nBa(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$)$_{2}$As$_{2}$ compounds are very similar when the total\nnumber of extra electrons per Fe/$TM$ ($TM$ = transition metal) site is\nconsidered, which is consistent with the rigid band model. Despite the\nsimilarity, we find that the details of the transitions, for example, the\ntemperature difference between the structural and antiferromagnetic transition\ntemperatures and the incommensurability of the antiferromangetic peaks, are\ndifferent between Ba(Fe$_{1-x-y}$Co$_{x}$Rh$_{y}$)$_{2}$As$_{2}$ and\nBa(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$)$_{2}$As$_{2}$ compounds.\n", "  Single and multi-band (Burt-Foreman) k.p Hamiltonians for GaAs crystal phase\nquantum dots are developed and used to assess ongoing experimental activity on\nthe role of such factors as quantum confinement, spontaneous polarization,\nvalence band mixing and exciton Coulomb interaction. Spontaneous polarization\nis found to be a dominating term. Together with the control of dot thickness\n[Vainorious Nano Lett. 15, 2652 (2015)] it enables wide exciton wavelength and\nlifetime tunability. Several new phenomena are predicted for small diameter\ndots [Loitsch et al. Adv. Mater. 27, 2195 (2015)], including non-heavy hole\nground state, strong hole spin admixture and a type-II to type-I exciton\ntransition, which can be used to improve the absorption strength and reduce the\nradiative lifetime of GaAs polytypes.\n", "  The complete framework for the $\\epsilon$-machine construction of the one\ndimensional Ising model is presented correcting previous mistakes on the\nsubject. The approach follows the known treatment of the Ising model as a\nMarkov random field, where usually the local characteristic are obtained from\nthe stochastic matrix, the problem at hand needs the inverse relation, or how\nto obtain the stochastic matrix from the local characteristics, which are given\nvia the transfer matrix treatment. The obtained expressions allow to perform\ncomplexity-entropy analysis of particular instance of the Ising model. Three\nexamples are discussed: the 1/2-spin nearest neighbor and next nearest neighbor\nIsing model, and the persistent biased random walk.\n", "  We study two-dimensional $\\mathcal{N}{=}(0,2)$ supersymmetric gauged linear\nsigma models (GLSMs) using supersymmetric localization. We consider\n$\\mathcal{N}{=}(0,2)$ theories with an $R$-symmetry, which can always be\ndefined on curved space by a pseudo-topological twist while preserving one of\nthe two supercharges of flat space. For GLSMs which are deformations of\n$\\mathcal{N}{=}(2,2)$ GLSMs and retain a Coulomb branch, we consider the\n$A/2$-twist and compute the genus-zero correlation functions of certain\npseudo-chiral operators, which generalize the simplest twisted chiral ring\noperators away from the $\\mathcal{N}{=}(2,2)$ locus. These correlation\nfunctions can be written in terms of a certain residue operation on the Coulomb\nbranch, generalizing the Jeffrey-Kirwan residue prescription relevant for the\n$\\mathcal{N}{=}(2,2)$ locus. For abelian GLSMs, we reproduce existing results\nwith new formulas that render the quantum sheaf cohomology relations and other\nproperties manifest. For non-abelian GLSMs, our methods lead to new results. As\nan example, we briefly discuss the quantum sheaf cohomology of the Grassmannian\nmanifold.\n", "  We explore the dynamics of a resonant Bose gas following its quench to a\nstrongly interacting regime near a Feshbach resonance. For such deep quenches,\nwe utilize a self-consistent dynamic field approximation and find that after an\ninitial regime of many-body Rabi-like oscillations between the condensate and\nfinite-momentum quasiparticle pairs, at long times, the gas reaches a\npre-thermalized nonequilibrium steady state. We explore the resulting state\nthrough its broad stationary momentum distribution function, that exhibits a\npower-law high momentum tail. We study the dynamics and steady-state form of\nthe associated enhanced depletion, quench-rate dependent excitation energy,\nTan's contact, structure function and radio frequency spectroscopy. We find\nthese predictions to be in a qualitative agreement with recent experiments.\n", "  Recent progress with microfabricated quantum devices has revealed that an\nubiquitous source of noise originates in tunneling material defects that give\nrise to a sparse bath of parasitic two-level systems (TLSs). For\nsuperconducting qubits, TLSs residing on electrode surfaces and in tunnel\njunctions account for a major part of decoherence and thus pose a serious\nroadblock to the realization of solid-state quantum processors.\n  Here, we utilize a superconducting qubit to explore the quantum state\nevolution of coherently operated TLSs in order to shed new light on their\nindividual properties and environmental interactions. We identify a\nfrequency-dependence of TLS energy relaxation rates that can be explained by a\ncoupling to phononic modes rather than by anticipated mutual TLS interactions.\nMost investigated TLSs are found to be free of pure dephasing at their energy\ndegeneracy points, around which their Ramsey and spin-echo dephasing rates\nscale linearly and quadratically with asymmetry energy, respectively. We\nprovide an explanation based on the standard tunneling model, and identify\ninteraction with incoherent low-frequency (thermal) TLSs as the major mechanism\nof the pure dephasing in coherent high-frequency TLS.\n", "  It was recently shown [Halimeh et al. arXiv:1510.06144 (to appear in Phys.\nRev. A)] that as a result of the Doppler effect, inherently dispersive\nsingle-frequency ideal free-space invisibility cloaks in relative motion to an\nobserver can only cloak light whose frequency in the cloak frame coincides with\nthe operational frequency of the cloak, although an infinite number of such\nrays exist for any cloak motion. In this article, we show analytically and\nthrough ray-tracing simulations that even though this relationship can be\nrelaxed by simplifying the ideal invisibility cloak into a broadband amplitude\ncloak, Fresnel-Fizeau drag uncloaks the phase of light in the inertial frame of\nthe cloak thereby compromising its amplitude cloaking in all other inertial\nframes. In other words, only an invisibility device that perfectly cloaks both\nthe amplitude and the phase of light in its own inertial frame will also\n(perfectly) cloak this light in any other inertial frame. The same conclusion\nlends itself to invisible objects that are not cloaks, such as the invisible\nsphere.\n", "  Modern applications in quantum computation and quantum communication require\nthe precise characterization of quantum states and quantum channels. In\npractice, this means that one has to determine the quantum capacity of a\nphysical system in terms of measurable quantities. Witnesses, if properly\nconstructed, succeed in performing this task. We derive a method that is\ncapable to compute witnesses for identifying deterministic evolutions and\nmeasurement-induced collapse processes. At the same time, applying the\nChoi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism, it uncovers the entanglement characteristics of\nbipartite quantum states. Remarkably, a statistical mixture of unitary\nevolutions is mapped onto mixtures of maximally entangled states, and classical\nseparable states originate from genuine quantum-state reduction maps. Based on\nour treatment we are able to witness these opposing attributes at once and,\nfurthermore, obtain an insight into their different geometric structures. The\ncomplementarity is further underpinned by formulating a complementary Schmidt\ndecomposition of a state in terms of maximally entangled states and discrete\nFourier-transformed Schmidt coefficients.\n", "  We perform extensive benchmark comparisons of surface hopping dynamics with\nnumerically exact calculations for the spin-boson model over a wide range of\nenergetic and coupling parameters as well as temperature. We find that\ndeviations from golden-rule scaling in the Marcus regime are generally small\nand depend sensitively on the energetic bias between electronic states. Fewest\nswitched surface hopping (FSSH) is found to be surprisingly accurate over a\nlarge swath of parameter space. The inclusion of decoherence corrections via\nthe augmented FSSH (A-FSSH) algorithm improves the accuracy of dynamical\nbehavior compared to exact simulations, but the effects are generally not\ndramatic, at least for the case of an environment modeled with the commonly\nused Debye spectral density.\n", "  A discrete parity $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry of a two parameter extension of the\nquantum Rabi model which smoothly interpolates between the latter and the\nJaynes-Cummings model, and of the two-photon and the two-mode quantum Rabi\nmodels enables their diagonalization in the spin subspace. A more general\nstatement is that the respective sets of $2\\times 2$ hermitian operators of the\nFulton-Gouterman type and those diagonal in the spin subspace are unitary\nequivalent. The diagonalized representation makes it transparent that any\nquestion about integrability and solvability can be addressed only at the level\nof ordinary differential operators of Dunkl type. Braak's definition of\nintegrability is shown (i) to contradict earlier numerical studies and (ii) to\nimply that any physically reasonable differential operator of Fulton-Gouterman\ntype is integrable.\n", "  Using $(2+1)$-flavor lattice QCD, we compute the 10 form factors describing\nthe $\\Lambda_b \\to \\Lambda$ matrix elements of the $b \\to s$ vector, axial\nvector, and tensor currents. The calculation is based on gauge field ensembles\ngenerated by the RBC and UKQCD Collaborations with a domain-wall action for the\n$u$, $d$, and $s$ quarks and the Iwasaki gauge action. The $b$ quark is\nimplemented using an anisotropic clover action, tuned nonperturbatively to the\nphysical point, and the currents are renormalized with a mostly nonperturbative\nmethod. We perform simultaneous chiral, continuum, and kinematic extrapolations\nof the form factors through modified $z$ expansions. Using our form factor\nresults, we obtain precise predictions for the $\\Lambda_b \\to \\Lambda(\\to p^+\n\\pi^-) \\mu^+ \\mu^-$ differential branching fraction and angular observables in\nthe Standard Model.\n", "  In co-infections, positive feedback between multiple diseases can accelerate\noutbreaks. In a recent letter Chen, Ghanbarnejad, Cai, and Grassberger (CGCG)\nintroduced a spatially homogeneous mean-field model system for such\nco-infections, and studied this system numerically with focus on the possible\nexistence of discontinuous phase transitions. We show that their model\ncoincides in mean-field theory with the homogenous limit of the extended\ngeneral epidemic process (EGEP). Studying the latter analytically, we argue\nthat the discontinuous transition observed by CGCG is basically a spinodal\nphase transition and not a first-order transition with phase-coexistence. We\nderive the conditions for this spinodal transition along with predictions for\nimportant quantities such as the magnitude of the discontinuity. We also shed\nlight on a true first-order transition with phase-coexistence by discussing the\nEGEP with spatial inhomogeneities.\n", "  We have conducted a comprehensive investigation into the magneto-transport\nproperties of few-layer black phosphorus in terms of phase coherence length,\nphase coherence time, and mobility via weak localization measurement and\nHall-effect measurement. We present magnetoresistance data showing the weak\nlocalization effect in bare p-type few-layer black phosphorus and reveal its\nstrong dependence on temperature and carrier concentration. The measured weak\nlocalization agrees well with the Hikami-Larkin-Nagaoka model and the extracted\nphase coherence length of 104 nm at 350 mK, decreasing as ~T^-0.51+-0.05 with\nincreased temperature. Weak localization measurement allows us to qualitatively\nprobe the temperature-dependent phase coherence time {\\tau}, which is in\nagreement with the theory of carrier interaction in the diffusive regime. We\nalso observe the universal conductance fluctuation phenomenon in few-layer\nblack phosphorus within moderate magnetic field and low temperature regime.\n", "  The structure of (GeS$_2$)$_{0.75}$(Ga$_2$S$_3$)$_{0.25}$ and\n(GeS$_2$)$_{0.83}$(Ga$_2$S$_3$)$_{0.17}$ glasses was investigated by Raman\nscattering, high energy X-ray diffraction and extended X-ray absorption fine\nstructure (EXAFS) measurements at the Ga and Ge K-edges. The reverse Monte\nCarlo simulation technique (RMC) was used to obtain structural models\ncompatible with diffraction and EXAFS datasets. It was found that the\ncoordination number of Ga is close to four. While Ge atoms have only S\nneighbors, Ga binds to S as well as to Ga atoms showing a violation of chemical\nordering in GeS$_2$-Ga$_2$S$_3$ glasses. Analysis of the corner- and\nedge-sharing between [GeS$_{4/2}$] units revealed that about 30% of germanium\natoms participate in the edge-shared tetrahedra.\n", "  The design, fabrication, and detailed calibration of essential building\nblocks towards fully integrated linear-optics quantum computation are\ndiscussed. Photonic devices are made from silicon nitride rib waveguides, where\nmeasurements on ring resonators show small propagation losses. Directional\ncouplers are designed to be insensitive to fabrication variations. Their offset\nand coupling lengths are measured, as well as the phase difference between the\ntransmitted and reflected light. With careful calibrations, the insertion loss\nof the directional couplers is found to be small. Finally, an integrated\ncontrolled-NOT circuit is characterized by measuring the transmission through\ndifferent combinations of inputs and outputs. The gate fidelity for the CNOT\noperation with this circuit is estimated to be 99.81% after post selection.\nThis high fidelity is due to our robust design, good fabrication\nreproducibility, and extensive characterizations.\n", "  We understand emergent quantum mechanics in the sense that quantum mechanics\ndescribes processes of physical emergence relating an assumed sub-quantum\nphysics to macroscopic boundary conditions. The latter can be shown to entail\ntop-down causation, in addition to usual bottom-up scenarios. With this example\nit is demonstrated that definitions of \"realism\" in the literature are simply\ntoo restrictive. A prevailing manner to define realism in quantum mechanics is\nin terms of pre-determination independent of the measurement. With our\ncounter-example, which actually is ubiquitous in emergent, or self-organizing,\nsystems, we argue for realism without pre-determination. We refer to earlier\nresults of our group showing how the guiding equation of the de Broglie-Bohm\ninterpretation can be derived from a theory with classical ingredients only.\nEssentially, this corresponds to a \"quantum mechanics without wave functions\"\nin ordinary 3-space, albeit with nonlocal correlations.\n  This, then, leads to the central question of how to deal with the nonlocality\nproblem in a relativistic setting. We here show that a basic argument\ndiscussing the allegedly paradox time ordering of events in EPR-type\ntwo-particle experiments falls short of taking into account the contextuality\nof the experimental setup. Consequently, we then discuss under which\ncircumstances (i.e. physical premises) superluminal information transfer (but\nnot signaling) may be compatible with a Lorentz-invariant theory. Finally, we\nargue that the impossibility of superluminal signaling - despite the presence\nof superluminal information transfer - is not the result of some sort of\nconspiracy (a la \"Nature likes to hide\"), but the consequence of the\nimpossibility to exactly reproduce in repeated experimental runs a state's\npreparation, or of the no-cloning theorem, respectively.\n", "  The C-H vibrational bands become more and more important in the structural\ndetermination of biological molecules with the development of CARS microscopy\nand 2DIR spectroscopy. Due to the congested pattern, near degeneracy, and\nstrong anharmonicity of the C-H stretch vibrations, assignment of the C-H\nvibrational bands are often misleading. Anharmonic vibrational spectra\ncalculation with multidimensional potential energy surface interprets the C-H\nvibrational spectra more accurately. In this article we have presented the\nimportance of multidimensional potential energy surface in anharmonic\nvibrational spectra calculation and discuss the unexpected red shift of C-H\nvibrational band of Methyl benzoate.\n", "  Zipf's law predicts a power-law relationship between word rank and frequency\nin language communication systems, and is widely reported in texts yet remains\nenigmatic as to its origins. Computer simulations have shown that language\ncommunication systems emerge at an abrupt phase transition in the fidelity of\nmappings between symbols and objects. Since the phase transition approximates\nthe Heaviside or step function, we show that Zipfian scaling emerges\nasymptotically at high rank based on the Laplace transform. We thereby\ndemonstrate that Zipf's law gradually emerges from the moment of phase\ntransition in communicative systems. We show that this power-law scaling\nbehavior explains the emergence of natural languages at phase transitions. We\nfind that the emergence of Zipf's law during language communication suggests\nthat the use of rare words in a lexicon is critical for the construction of an\neffective communicative system at the phase transition.\n", "  We show that the bulk-boundary correspondence for topological insulators can\nbe modified in the presence of non-Hermiticity. We consider a one-dimensional\ntight-binding model with gain and loss as well as long-range hopping. The\nsystem is described by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian that encircles an\nexceptional point in momentum space. The winding number has a fractional value\nof 1/2. There is only one dynamically stable zero-energy edge state due to the\ndefectiveness of the Hamiltonian. This edge state is robust to disorder due to\nprotection by a chiral symmetry. We also discuss experimental realization with\narrays of coupled resonator optical waveguides.\n", "  The last three years have again seen new exciting developments in the area of\nhigher dimensional black objects. For black objects with noncompact higher\ndimensions, the solution space was exlored further within the blackfold\napproach and with numerical schemes, yielding a large variety of new families\nof solutions, while limiting procedures created so-called super-entropic black\nholes. Concerning compact extra dimensions, the sequences of static nonuniform\nblack strings in five and six dimensions were extended to impressively large\nvalues of the nonuniformity parameter with extreme numerical precision, showing\nthat an oscillating pattern arises for the mass, the area or the temperature,\nwhile approaching the conjectured double-cone merger solution. Besides the\npresentation of interesting new types of higherdimensional solutions, also\ntheir physical properties were addressed in this session. While the main focus\nwas on Einstein gravity, a significant number of talks also covered Lovelock\ntheories.\n", "  We adopt the Chiellini integrability method to find the solutions of various\ngeneralizations of the damped Milne-Pinney equations. In particular, we find\nthe solution of the damped Ermakov-Painlev\\'e II equation and generalized\ndissipative Milne-Pinney equation.\n", "  Magnetoresistance (MR), the change of a material's electrical resistance in\nresponse to an applied magnetic field, is a technologically important property\nthat has been the topic of intense study for more than a quarter century. Here\nwe report the observation of an unusual \"butterfly\" shaped titanic angular\nmagnetoresistance (AMR) in the non-magnetic, Dirac material, ZrSiS. The MR is\nlarge and positive, reaching nearly 1.8 x 10^5 percent at 9 T and 2 K at an\nangle of 45o between the applied current (along the a-axis) and the applied\nfield (90o is H parallel to the c-axis). Approaching 90o, a \"dip\" is seen in\nthe AMR which can be traced to an angle dependent deviation from the H^2 law.\nBy analyzing the SdH oscillations at different angles, we find that ZrSiS has a\ncombination of 2D and 3D Dirac pockets comprising its Fermi surface and that\nthe anomalous transport behavior coincides with a topological phase transition\nwhose robust signature is evident despite transport contributions from other\nparts of the Fermi surface. We also find that as a function of angle, the\ntemperature dependent resistivity in high field displays a broad peak-like\nbehavior, unlike any known Dirac/Weyl material. The combination of very high\nmobility carriers and multiple Fermi surfaces in ZrSiS allow for large bulk\nproperty changes to occur as a function of angle between applied fields makes\nit a promising platform to study the physics stemming from the coexistence of\n2D and 3D Dirac electrons.\n", "  We consider a general Langevin dynamics for the one-dimensional N-particle\nCoulomb gas with confining potential $V$ at temperature $\\beta$. These dynamics\ndescribe for $\\beta=2$ the time evolution of the eigenvalues of $N\\times N$\nrandom Hermitian matrices. The equilibrium partition function -- equal to the\nnormalization constant of the Laughlin wave function in fractional quantum Hall\neffect -- is known to satisfy an infinite number of constraints called Virasoro\nor loop constraints. We introduce here a dynamical generating function on the\nspace of random trajectories which satisfies a large class of constraints of\ngeometric origin. We focus in this article on a subclass induced by the\ninvariance under the Schr\\\"odinger-Virasoro algebra.\n", "  The intriguing possibility of Bose-Einstein condensation of pions at the LHC\nis examined with the use of higher order moments of the multiplicity\ndistribution. The scaled variance, skewness and kurtosis are calculated for the\npion system. The obtained results show that the normalized kurtosis has a\nsignificant increase for the case of the pion condensation.\n", "  Molecular crystals are a prototypical class of van der Waals (vdW) bound\norganic materials with excited state properties relevant for optoelectronics\napplications. Predicting the structure and excited state properties of\nmolecular crystals presents a challenge for electronic structure theory, as\nstandard approximations to density functional theory (DFT) do not capture long\nrange vdW dispersion interactions and do not yield excited state properties. In\nthis work, we use a combination of DFT including vdW forces) using both non\nlocal correlation functionals and pair wise correction methods (together with\nmany body perturbation theory (MBPT) to study the geometry and excited states,\nrespectively, of the entire series of oligoacene crystals, from benzene to\nhexacene. We find that vdW methods can predict lattice constants within 1\npercent of the experimental measurements, on par with the previously reported\naccuracy of pairwise approximations for the same systems. We further find that\nexcitation energies are sensitive to geometry, but if optimized geometries are\nused MBPT can yield excited state properties within a few tenths of an eV from\nexperiment. We elucidate trends in MBPT computed charged and neutral excitation\nenergies across the acene series and discuss the role of common approximations\nused in MBPT.\n", "  We discuss the physics and modeling of latex-rubber slingshots. The goal is\nto get accurate speed predictions inspite of the significant real world\ndifficulties of force drift, force hysteresis, rubber ageing, and the very non-\nlinear, non-ideal, force vs. pull distance curves of slingshot rubber bands.\nSlingshots are known to shoot faster under some circumstances when the bands\nare tapered rather than having constant width and stiffness. We give both\nqualitative understanding and numerical predictions of this effect. We consider\ntwo models. The first is based on conservation of energy and is easier to\nimplement, but cannot determine the speeds along the rubber bands without\nmaking assumptions. The second, treats the bands as a series of mass points\nsubject to being pulled by immediately adjacent mass points according to how\nmuch the rubber has been stretched on the two adjacent sides. This is a classic\nmany-body F=ma problem but convergence requires using a particular numerical\ntechnique. It gives accurate predictions (average error +2%, standard deviation\n3%). The basis for these models involves measurements of pull-force vs.\npull-distance. We will show how such measurements can be scaled for increased\nwidth or length, so that minimal calibration measurements are needed to support\nthe models. With a good physical model of a slingshot one is easily able to\ntest a wide range of parameters to determine how to get the fastest shots for a\ngiven pull force and draw length. We include examples of such calculations for\npopular slingshot rubber bands and tubes.\n", "  Substrate-transferred crystalline coatings have recently emerged as a\ngroundbreaking new concept in optical interference coatings. Building upon our\ninitial demonstration of this technology, we have now realized significant\nimprovements in the limiting optical performance of these novel single-crystal\n$GaAs/Al_{x}Ga_{1-x}As$ multilayers. In the near-infrared (NIR), for coating\ncenter wavelengths spanning 1064 to 1560 nm, we have reduced the excess optical\nlosses (scatter + absorption) to levels as low as 3 parts per million, enabling\nthe realization of a cavity finesse exceeding $3\\times 10^{5}$ at the\ntelecom-relevant wavelength range near 1550 nm. Moreover, we demonstrate the\ndirect measurement of sub-ppm optical absorption at 1064 nm. Concurrently, we\ninvestigate the mid-IR (MIR) properties of these coatings and observe\nexceptional performance for first attempts in this important wavelength region.\nSpecifically, we verify excess losses at the hundred ppm level for wavelengths\nof 3300 and 3700 nm. Taken together, our NIR optical losses are now fully\ncompetitive with ion beam sputtered multilayer coatings, while our first\nprototype MIR optics have already reached state-of-the-art performance levels\nfor reflectors covering this portion of the fingerprint region for optical gas\nsensing. Mirrors fabricated with our crystalline coating technique exhibit the\nlowest mechanical loss, and thus the lowest Brownian noise, the highest thermal\nconductivity, and, potentially, the widest spectral coverage of any\n\"supermirror\" technology in a single material platform. Looking ahead, we see a\nbright future for crystalline coatings in applications requiring the ultimate\nlevels of optical, thermal, and optomechanical performance\n", "  How the brain co-ordinates the actions of distant regions in an efficient\nmanner is an open problem. Many believe that cross-frequency coupling between\nthe amplitude of high frequency local field potential oscillations in one\nregion and the phase of lower frequency signals in another may form a possible\nmechanism. This work provides a preliminary study from both an experimental and\ntheoretical viewpoint, concentrating on possible coupling between the\nhippocampus and pre-frontal cortex in rats during tasks involving working\nmemory, spatial navigation and decision making processes. Attempts to search\nfor such coupling events are made using newly developed MATLAB scripts. This\nleads to the discovery of increased envelope-to-signal correlation (ESC)\nbetween the 1-10 Hz hippocampus theta and 30-40 Hz pre-fontal cortex gamma\nbands when a choice turn is approached during a T-maze task. From a theoretical\nperspective, a standard connectionist modelling approach is extended to allow\nfor the formation of oscillations. Although detrimental to overall average task\nperformance, this did lead to a reduced increase in performance variation as\nnoise was increased, when compared to a standard non-oscillating model.\n", "  The Ehresmann connection on a fiber bundle that is not compatible with a\n(possible) Lie group structure is illustrated by the geometry of a general\nanholonomic observer in the Minkowski space. The 3D split of Maxwell's\nequations induces geometric terms that are the (generalized) curvature and\ntorque of the connection. The notion of torque is introduced here as a Lie\ncoalgebra-valued endomorphism field and measures the deviation of a connection\nfrom being principal.\n", "  Particle-based ensemble semi-classical Monte Carlo (MC) methods employ\nquantum corrections (QCs) to address quantum confinement and degenerate carrier\npopulations to model tomorrow's ultra-scaled MOSFETs. Here we present new\napproaches to quantum confinement and carrier degeneracy effects in a\nthree-dimensional (3D) MC device simulator, and illustrate their significance\nthrough simulation of n-channel Si and III-V FinFETs. Original contributions\ninclude our treatment of far-from-equilibrium degenerate statistics and\nQC-based modeling of surface-roughness scattering, as well as considering\nquantum-confined phonon and impurity scattering in 3D. Typical MC simulations\napproximate degenerate carrier populations as Fermi distributions to model the\nPauli-blocking (PB) of scattering to occupied final states. To allow for\nincreasingly far-from-equilibrium non-Fermi carrier distributions in\nultra-scaled devices, we instead generate the final-state occupation\nprobabilities used for PB by sampling the local carrier populations as a\nfunction of energy and energy valley. This process is aided by the use of\nfractional carriers or sub-carriers, which minimizes classical carrier-carrier\nscattering. Quantum confinement effects are addressed through\nquantum-correction potentials (QCPs) generated from Schr\\\"{o}dinger-Poisson\nsolvers, as commonly done. However, we use our valley- and\norientation-dependent QCPs not just to redistribute carriers in real space, or\neven among energy valleys, but also to calculate confinement-dependent phonon,\nimpurity, and surface-roughness scattering rates. FinFET simulations are used\nto illustrate how, collectively, these quantum effects can substantially reduce\nand even eliminate otherwise expected benefits of\nIn$_{\\text{0.53}}$Ga$_{\\text{0.47}}$As FinFETs over otherwise identical Si\nFinFETs, despite higher thermal velocities in\nIn$_{\\text{0.53}}$Ga$_{\\text{0.47}}$As.\n", "  HESS J1825-137 is a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) whose TeV emission extends\nacross ~1 deg. Its large asymmetric shape indicates that its progenitor\nsupernova interacted with a molecular cloud located in the north of the PWN as\ndetected by previous CO Galactic survey (e.g Lemiere, Terrier &\nDjannati-Ata\u007f\\\"i 2006). Here we provide a detailed picture of the ISM towards\nthe region north of HESS J1825-137, with the analysis of the dense molecular\ngas from our 7mm and 12mm Mopra survey and the more diffuse molecular gas from\nthe Nanten CO(1-0) and GRS $^{13}$CO(1-0) surveys. Our focus is the possible\nassociation between HESS J1825-137 and the unidentified TeV source to the\nnorth, HESS J1826-130. We report several dense molecular regions whose\nkinematic distance matched the dispersion measured distance of the pulsar.\nAmong them, the dense molecular gas located at (RA,\nDec)=(18.421h,-13.282$^{\\circ}$) shows enhanced turbulence and we suggest that\nthe velocity structure in this region may be explained by a cloud-cloud\ncollision scenario. Furthermore, the presence of a H$\\alpha$ rim may be the\nfirst evidence of the progenitor SNR of the pulsar PSR J1826-1334 as the\ndistance between the H$\\alpha$ rim and the TeV source matched with the\npredicted SNR radius R$_{\\text{SNR}}$~120 pc. From our ISM study, we identify a\nfew plausible origins of the HESS J1826-130 emission, including the progenitor\nSNR of PSR J1826-1334 and the PWN G018.5-0.4 powered by PSR J1826-1256. A\ndeeper TeV study however, is required to fully identify the origin of this\nmysterious TeV source.\n", "  We solved the nonlocal scattering and bound state equations using the\nPerey-Buck type interaction, and compared to local equivalent calculations.\nUsing the distorted wave Born approximation we construct the T-matrix for (p,d)\ntransfer on 17O, 41Ca, 49Ca, 127Sn, 133Sn, and 209Pb at 20 and 50 MeV.\nAdditionally we studied (p,d) reactions on 40Ca using the the nonlocal\ndispersive optical model. We have also included nonlocality consistently into\nthe adiabatic distorted wave approximation and have investigated the effects of\nnonlocality on on (d,p) transfer reactions for deuterons impinged on 16O, 40Ca,\n48Ca, 126Sn, 132Sn, 208Pb at 10, 20, and 50 MeV. We found that for bound states\nthe Perry corrected wave functions resulting from the local equation agreed\nwell with that from the nonlocal equation in the interior region, but\ndiscrepancies were found in the surface and peripheral regions. Overall, the\nPerey correction factor was adequate for scattering states, with the exception\nfor a few partial waves. Nonlocality in the proton scattering state reduced the\namplitude of the wave function in the nuclear interior. The same was seen for\nnonlocality in the deuteron scattering state, but the wave function was also\nshifted outward. In distorted wave Born approximation studies of (p,d)\nreactions using the Perey-Buck potential, we found that transfer distributions\nat the first peak differed by 15-35% as compared to the distribution resulting\nfrom local potentials. When using the dispersive optical model, this\ndiscrepancies grew to 30-50%. When nonlocality was included consistently within\nthe adiabatic distorted wave approximation, the disagreement was found to be\n~40%. This highlights the necessity to pursue reaction formalisms that include\nnonlocality exactly.\n", "  Thermoluminescence (TL) characteristics for LiF:Mg,Cu,P, and CaSO$_4$:Dy\nunder the homogeneous field of X-ray beams of diagnostic irradiation and its\nverification using thermoluminescence dosimetry is presented. The irradiation\nwere performed utilizing a conventional X-ray equipment installed at the\nHospital Ju\\'arez Norte of M\\'exico. Different thermoluminescence\ncharacteristics of two material were studied, such as batch homogeneity, glow\ncurve, linearity, detection threshold, reproducibility, relative sensitivity\nand fading. Materials were calibrated in terms of absorbed dose to the standard\ncalibration distance and they were positioned in a generic phantom. The dose\nanalysis, verification and comparison with the measurements obtained by the\nTLD-100 were performed. Results indicate that the dosimetric peak appears at\n202$^o$C and 277.5$^o$C for LiF:Mg,Cu,P and CaSO$_4$:Dy, respectively. TL\nresponse as a function of X-ray dose showed a linearity behavior in the very\nlow dose range for all materials. However, the TLD-100 is not accurate for\nmeasurements below $4mGy$. CaSO$_4$:Dy is 80\\% more sensitive than TLD-100 and\nit show the lowest detection threshold, whereas LiF:Mg,Cu,P is 60\\% more\nsensitive than TLD-100. All material showed very good repeatability. Fading for\na period of one month at room temperature showed low fading LiF:Mg,Cu,P, medium\nand high for TLD-100 and CaSO$_4$:Dy. The results suggest that CaSO$_4$:Dy and\nLiF:Mg,Cu,P are suitable for measurements at low doses used in radiodiagnostic.\n", "  An interpretation of Krawtchouk matrices in terms of discrete version of the\nFeynman path integral is given. Also, an algebraic characterization in terms of\nthe algebra of split quaternions is provided. The resulting properties include\nan easy inference of the spectral decomposition. It is also an occasion for an\nexpository clarification of the role of Krawtchouk matrices in different areas,\nincluding quantum information.\n", "  Inspired by the geometry of wrapped Fukaya categories, we introduce the\nnotion of wrapped microlocal sheaves. We show that traditional microlocal\nsheaves are equivalent to functionals on wrapped microlocal sheaves, in analogy\nwith the expected relation of infinitesimal to wrapped Fukaya categories. As an\napplication, we calculate wrapped microlocal sheaves on higher-dimensional\npairs of pants, confirming expectations from mirror symmetry.\n", "  Blind quantum computation protocols allow a user with limited quantum\ntechnology to delegate an intractable computation to a quantum server while\nkeeping the computation perfectly secret. Whereas in some protocols a user can\nverify that calculated outcomes are correct, a third party cannot do this,\nwhich allows a dishonest user or owner to benefit illegally. I propose a new\nblind quantum computation protocol with a new property called public\nverifiability, which enables any third party to assure that a party does not\nbenefit from attempted deception.\n", "  Quantum contextuality is usually revealed by the non-contextual inequality,\nwhich can always be associated with an exclusivity graph. The quantum upper\nbound of the inequality is nothing but the Lov\\'asz number of the graph. In\nthis work, we show that if there is a Lov\\'asz-optimum orthogonal\nrepresentation realized in the $d$-dimensional complex Hilbert space, then\nthere always exists a corresponding Lov\\'asz-optimum orthogonal representation\nin the $(2d-1)$-dimensional real Hilbert space. This in turn completes the\nproof that the Lov\\'asz-optimum orthogonal representation for any exclusivity\ngraph can always be realized in the real Hilbert space of suitable dimension.\n", "  Based on data from the SWIFT, INTEGRAL, MAXI/ISS orbital observatories, and\nthe ground-based RTT-150 telescope, we have investigated the broadband (from\nthe optical to the hard X-ray bands) spectrum of the X-ray nova MAXI J1828-249\nand its evolution during the outburst of the source in 2013-2014. The optical\nand infrared emissions from the nova are shown to be largely determined by the\nextension of the power-law component responsible for the hard X-ray emission.\nThe contribution from the outer cold regions of the accretion disk, even if the\nX-ray heating of its surface is taken into account, turns out to be moderate\nduring the source's \"high\" state (when a soft blackbody emission component is\nobserved in the X-ray spectrum) and is virtually absent during its \"low\"\n(\"hard\") state. This result suggests that much of the optical and infrared\nemissions from such systems originates in the same region of main energy\nrelease where their hard X-ray emission is formed. This can be the Compton or\nsynchro-Compton radiation from a high-temperature plasma in the central\naccretion disk region puffed up by instabilities, the synchrotron radiation\nfrom a hot corona above the disk, or the synchrotron radiation from its\nrelativistic jets.\n", "  Motivated by applications to seed germination, we consider the transverse\ndeflection that results from the axisymmetric indentation of an elastic\nmembrane by a rigid body. The elastic membrane is fixed around its boundary,\nwith or without an initial pre-stretch, and may be initially curved prior to\nindentation. General indenter shapes are considered, and the load-indentation\ncurves that result for a range of spheroidal tips are obtained for both flat\nand curved membranes. Wrinkling may occur when the membrane is initially\ncurved, and a relaxed strain-energy function is used to calculate the deformed\nprofile in this case. Applications to experiments designed to measure the\nmechanical properties of seed endosperms are discussed.\n", "  We have been developing X-ray SOI pixel Sensors, called \"XRPIX\", for future\nX-ray astronomy satellites that enable us to observe in the wide energy band of\n0.5-40 keV. Since XRPIXs have the circuitry layer with a thickness of about 8\n{\\mu}m in the front side of the sensor, it is impossible to detect low energy\nX-rays with a front-illuminated type. So, we have been developing\nback-illuminated type of XRPIX with a less 1 {\\mu}m dead layer in the\nback-side, which enables the sensitivity to reach 0.5 keV. We produced two\ntypes of back-side illuminated (BI) XRPIXs, one of which is produced in \"Pizza\nprocess\" which LBNL developed and the other is processed in the ion\nimplantation and laser annealing. We irradiated both of the BI-XRPIXs with soft\nX-ray and investigate soft X-ray performance of them. We report results from\nsoft X-ray evaluation test of the device.\n", "  Diffusion barriers for a cluster of three water molecules on Pd(111) have\nbeen estimated from ab-initio Density Functional Theory. A model for the\ndiffusion of the trimer based in rotations yields a simple explanation of why\nthe cluster can diffuse faster than a single water molecule by a factor\n$\\approx 10^{2}$. This model is based on the differences between the adsorption\ngeometry for the three monomers forming the cluster. One member interacts\nstrongly with the surface and sits closer to the surface (d) while the other\ntwo interact weakly and stay at a larger separation from the surface (u). The\ntrimer rotates nearly freely around the axis determined by the d monomer.\nTranslations of the whole trimer imply breaking the strong interaction of the d\nmonomer with the surface. Alternatively, thermal fluctuations exchange the\nactual monomer sitting closer to the surface with a lower energetic cost.\nRotations around different axis introduce a diffusion mechanism where a strong\ninteraction is kept along the diffusion path between the water molecule\ndefining the axis of rotation and the Pd underneath.\n", "  We perform a series of controlled N-body simulations of growing disc galaxies\nwithin non-growing, live dark matter haloes of varying mass and concentration.\nOur initial conditions include either a low-mass disc or a compact bulge. New\nstellar particles are continuously added on near-circular orbits to the\nexisting disc, so spiral structure is continuously excited. To study the effect\nof combined spiral and giant molecular cloud (GMC) heating on the discs we\nintroduce massive, short-lived particles that sample a GMC mass function. An\nisothermal gas component is introduced for a subset of the models. We perform a\nresolution study and vary parameters governing the GMC population, the\nhistories of star formation and radial scale growth. Models with GMCs and\nstandard values for the disc mass and halo density provide the right level of\nself-gravity to explain the age velocity dispersion relation of the Solar\nneighbourhood (Snhd). GMC heating generates remarkably exponential vertical\nprofiles with scaleheights that are radially constant and agree with\nobservations of galactic thin discs. GMCs are also capable of significantly\ndelaying bar formation. The amount of spiral induced radial migration agrees\nwith what is required for the metallicity distribution of the Snhd. However, in\nour standard models the outward migrating populations are not hot enough\nvertically to create thick discs. Thick discs can form in models with high\nbaryon fractions, but the corresponding bars are too long, the young stellar\npopulations too hot and the discs flare considerably.\n", "  In this study, critical behavior of low dimensional magnetic systems as\ncyano-bridged Tb(III)-Cr(III) bimetallic assembly was investigated with the\nmixed spin $3$- spin $3/2$ Ising model. The mixed spin Ising model is simulated\nwith Cellular Automaton cooling and heating algorithms on one-dimensional\nlattices in periodic boundary conditions. The Ising model Hamiltonian includes\nonly antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbor interaction ($% J>0$). The mixed spin\nsystem behaves like the isolated one-dimensional chain for zero magnetic field\n($h=\\frac{H}{J}=0$). In the presence of the magnetic field, the magnetization\nis calculated using zero-field cooling ($ZFC$) and field cooling ($FC$)\nprocesses. The one-dimensional Ising model results are compatible with the\ncyano-bridged Tb(III)-Cr(III) bimetallic quasi-one dimensional assembly\n[Tb(H_{2}O)_{2}(DMF)_{4}{ Cr(CN)_{6}}].H_{2}O(DMF=dimethylformamide) results.\n", "  The assistance of an intense optical laser pulse on electron-positron pair\nproduction by the Breit-Wheeler and Schwinger processes in XFEL fields is\nanalyzed. The impact of a laser beam on high-energy photon collisions with XFEL\nphotons consists in a phase space redistribution of the pairs emerging in the\nBreit-Wheeler sub-process. We provide numerical examples of the differential\ncross section for parameters related to the European XFEL. Analogously, the\nSchwinger type pair production in pulsed fields with oscillating components\nreferring to a superposition of optical laser and XFEL frequencies is\nevaluated. The residual phase space distribution of created pairs is sensitive\nto the pulse shape and may differ significantly from transiently achieved mode\noccupations.\n", "  Coupled nanomechanical resonators have recently attracted much attention for\nboth fundamental studies in physics and broad applications in high-precession\ndetection or sensing. By studying the Landau-Zener transitions and Rabi\noscillation of two coupled resonators, it has been shown that such a two-mode\nsystem acts as a classical two-level system bearing the analog to a quantum\nmechanical two-level one. Here we construct a St\\\"uckelberg interferometer with\ntwo coupled cantilevers by driving the system through the avoided crossing\ntwice. By measuring the non-adiabatic phase acquired at the Landau-Zener\ntransition, we unveil an in-depth analog between the two-mode and quantum\ntwo-level systems. Our study opens up new opportunities for constructing\ninterferometers with classical devices.\n", "  The necessary and sufficient conditions for a hyperbolic semi-discrete\nequation to have five dimensional characteristic {\\it x}-ring are derived. For\nany given chain, the derived conditions are easily verifiable by\nstraightforward calculations.\n", "  We investigate an extension of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model\n(MSSM) containing a $SU(2)$ Higgs triplet of zero hypercharge and a gauge\nsinglet. We focus on a scenario of this model which allows a light pseudoscalar\nand/or a scalar below $100$ GeV in the spectrum, consistent with the most\nrecent data from the LHC and the earlier data from the LEP experiments. We\nanalyze the exotic decay of the discovered Higgs $(h_{125})$ into two light\n(hidden) Higgs bosons present in the extension. The latter are allowed by the\nuncertainties in the Higgs decay $h_{125}\\to WW^*$, $h_{125}\\to ZZ^*$ and\n$h_{125}\\to \\gamma\\gamma$. We have searched for such light Higgs bosons in the\n$2b+2\\tau$, $\\geq 3\\tau$, $2b+2\\mu$ and $2\\tau+2\\mu$ final states at the LHC\nwith 13 and 14 TeV. A region of such parameter space can be explored with an\nintegrated luminosity of 25 fb$^{-1}$ at the LHC.\n", "  Rich regular frequency patterns were found in the Fourier spectra of\nlow-amplitude delta Scuti stars observed by CoRoT satellite (see Papar\\'o et\nal. 2016a,b). The CoRoT observations are, however, influenced by the disturbing\neffect of the South Atlantic Anomaly. The effect is marginal for high amplitude\nvariable stars but it could be critical in the case of low amplitude variables,\nespecially if the frequency range of the intrinsic variation overlaps the\ninterval of the instrumental frequencies. Some tests were carried out both on\nsynthetic and real data for distinguishing technical and stars' frequencies.\n", "  Cultural astronomy is an interdisciplinary area of research that studies how\nperceptions and concepts related to the sky are part of the worldview of a\nculture. One of its branches, archaeoastronomy, focuses on the material remains\nof past peoples and tries to investigate their practices and astronomical\nknowledge. In this context, the orientation of Christian churches is now\nconsidered a distinctive feature of their architecture that repeats patterns\nfrom early Christian times. There is a general tendency to align their altars\nin the solar range, with preference for orientations towards the east. Here we\npresent recent data from our measurements of astronomical orientations of old\nchurches located in two --geographically and culturally-- very distant regions,\nand we discuss the results in the light of the historical and cultural\nknowledge surrounding these temples.\n", "  We present a reformulation of Mawxell's equation and examine the consequence\nof this new formulation. We argue that studies of such diverse topics as\nmagnetic monopole, magnetic recombination and magneto-genesis could benefit\nfrom the new formulation.\n", "  Gravitational lensing has seen a surge of interest in the past few years. The\nhandful of strong lensing systems known in the year 2000 has now been replaced\nwith hundreds, thanks to innovative multi-wavelength selection, and there is an\nimminent prospect of thousands of lenses from Herschel and other sub-millimetre\nsurveys. Euclid and the Square Kilometre Array promise tens or even hundreds of\nthousands. Gravitational lensing is one of the very few probes capable of\nmapping dark matter halo distributions. Lensing also provides independent\ncosmological parameter estimates and enables the study of galaxy populations\nthat are otherwise too faint for detailed study. SALT is extremely well placed\nto have an enormous impact with follow-up observations of foreground lenses and\nbackground sources from e.g. Herschel, the South Pole Telescope, the Atacama\nCosmology Telescope, Euclid and the Square Kilometre Array. This paper reviews\nthe prospects for high-impact SALT science and the many constraints of galaxy\nevolution that can result.\n", "  A prototype of a luminometer, designed for a future e+e- collider detector,\nwas tested in the CERN PS accelerator T9 testbeam. The objective of this test\nbeam was to demonstrate a multi-plane operation, to study the development of\nthe electromagnetic shower and to compare it with MC simulations.\n", "  Submillimetre and millimetre-wave surveys with Herschel and the South Pole\nTelescope have revolutionised the discovery of strong gravitational lenses.\nTheir follow-ups have been greatly facilitated by the multi-wavelength\nsupplementary data in the survey fields. The forthcoming Euclid\noptical/near-infrared space telescope will also detect strong gravitational\nlenses in large numbers, and orbital constraints are likely to require placing\nits deep survey at the North Ecliptic Pole (the natural deep field for a wide\nclass of ground-based and space-based observatories including AKARI, JWST and\nSPICA). In this paper I review the current status of the multi-wavelength\nsurvey coverage in the NEP, and discuss the prospects for the detection of\nstrong gravitational lenses in forthcoming or proposed facilities such as\nEuclid, FIRSPEX and SPICA.\n", "  Collisionless shocks, that is shocks mediated by electromagnetic processes,\nare customary in space physics and in astrophysics. They are to be found in a\ngreat variety of objects and environments: magnetospheric and heliospheric\nshocks, supernova remnants, pulsar winds and their nebul\\ae, active galactic\nnuclei, gamma-ray bursts and clusters of galaxies shock waves. Collisionless\nshock microphysics enters at different stages of shock formation, shock\ndynamics and particle energization and/or acceleration. It turns out that the\nshock phenomenon is a multi-scale non-linear problem in time and space. It is\ncomplexified by the impact due to high-energy cosmic rays in astrophysical\nenvironments. This review adresses the physics of shock formation, shock\ndynamics and particle acceleration based on a close examination of available\nmulti-wavelength or in-situ observations, analytical and numerical\ndevelopments. A particular emphasize is made on the different instabilities\ntriggered during the shock formation and in association with particle\nacceleration processes with regards to the properties of the background\nupstream medium. It appears that among the most important parameters the\nbackground magnetic field through the magnetization and its obliquity is the\ndominant one. The shock velocity that can reach relativistic speeds has also a\nstrong impact over the development of the micro-instabilities and the fate of\nparticle acceleration. Recent developments of laboratory shock experiments has\nstarted to bring some new insights in the physics of space plasma and\nastrophysical shock waves. A special section is dedicated to new laser plasma\nexperiments probing shock physics\n", "  We lay the foundation for a benchmarking methodology for assessing current\nand future quantum computers. We pose and begin addressing fundamental\nquestions about how to fairly compare computational devices at vastly different\nstages of technological maturity. We critically evaluate and offer our own\ncontributions to current quantum benchmarking efforts, in particular those\ninvolving adiabatic quantum computation and the Adiabatic Quantum Optimizers\nproduced by D-Wave Systems, Inc. We find that the performance of D-Wave's\nAdiabatic Quantum Optimizers scales roughly on par with classical approaches\nfor some hard combinatorial optimization problems; however, architectural\nlimitations of D-Wave devices present a significant hurdle in evaluating\nreal-world applications. In addition to identifying and isolating such\nlimitations, we develop algorithmic tools for circumventing these limitations\non future D-Wave devices, assuming they continue to grow and mature at an\nexponential rate for the next several years.\n", "  We introduce transformation matrix connecting sets of the displaced states\nwith different displacement amplitudes. Arbitrary pure one-mode state can be\nrepresented in new basis of the displaced number (Fock) states (\nrepresentation) by multiplying the transposed transformation matrix on a column\nvector of initial state. Analytical expressions of the representation of\nsuperposition of vacuum and single photon and two-mode squeezed vacuum (TMSV)\nare obtained. On the basis of the developed mathematical formalism, we consider\nthe mechanism of interaction between qubits which is based on their displaced\nproperties. Superposed coherent states deterministically displace target state\non equal modulo but opposite on sign values. Registration of the single photon\nin auxiliary mode (probabilistic operation) results in constructive\ninterference and gives birth to entangled hybrid state corresponding to outcome\nof elementary quantum gates. The method requires minimal number of resource and\nworks in realistic scenario\n", "  We used a spectroscopic microwave technique utilizing superconducting\nstripline resonators at frequencies between 3 GHz and 15 GHz to examine the\ncharge dynamics of YbRh2Si2 at temperatures and magnetic fields close to the\nquantum critical point. The different electronic phases of this heavy-fermion\ncompound, in particular the antiferromagnetic, Fermi-liquid, and\nnon-Fermi-liquid regimes, were probed with temperature-dependent microwave\nmeasurements between 40 mK and 600 mK at a set of different magnetic fields up\nto 140 mT. Signatures of phase transitions were observed, which give\ninformation about the dynamic response of this peculiar material that exhibits\nfield-tuned quantum criticality and pronounced deviations from Fermi-liquid\ntheory.\n", "  Metal organic framework (MOF) materials in general, and MOF-74 in particular,\nhave promising properties for many technologically important processes.\nHowever, their instability under humid conditions severely restricts practical\nuse. We show that this instability and the accompanying reduction of the CO$_2$\nuptake capacity of MOF-74 under humid conditions originate in the water\ndissociation reaction H$_2$O$\\rightarrow$OH+H at the metal centers. After this\ndissociation, the OH groups coordinate to the metal centers, explaining the\nreduction in the MOF's CO$_2$ uptake capacity. This reduction thus strongly\ndepends on the catalytic activity of MOF-74 towards the water dissociation\nreaction. We further show that-while the water molecules themselves only have a\nnegligible effect on the crystal structure of MOF-74-the OH and H products of\nthe dissociation reaction significantly weaken the MOF framework and lead to\nthe observed crystal structure breakdown. With this knowledge, we propose a way\nto suppress this particular reaction by modifying the MOF-74 structure to\nincrease the water dissociation energy barrier and thus control the stability\nof the system under humid conditions.\n", "  We investigate a simple model for the prediction of the splitting of the $3d$\norbitals of a metal ion in the environment of ligands. The electrons are\nconsidered to be independent and their interaction with the ligands is\nrepresented by the Dirac delta function in three dimensions. We discuss several\ncases where the model is successful and a few ones where it is not.\n", "  In the quest to build a practical quantum computer, it is important to use\nefficient schemes for enacting the elementary quantum operations from which\nquantum computer programs are constructed. The opposing requirements of\nwell-protected quantum data and fast quantum operations must be balanced to\nmaintain the integrity of the quantum information throughout the computation.\nOne important approach to quantum operations is to use an extra quantum system\n- an ancilla - to interact with the quantum data register. Ancillas can mediate\ninteractions between separated quantum registers, and by using fresh ancillas\nfor each quantum operation, data integrity can be preserved for longer. This\nreview provides an overview of the basic concepts of the gate model quantum\ncomputer architecture, including the different possible forms of information\nencodings - from base two up to continuous variables - and a more detailed\ndescription of how the main types of ancilla-mediated quantum operations\nprovide efficient quantum gates.\n", "  We have investigated how the recently-developed water-leaching method for\natomically-flat SrTiO3 (STO) substrates affects the transport properties of\nLaAlO3 (LAO) and STO heterointerfaces. Using pulsed laser deposition at\nidentical growth conditions, we have synthesized epitaxial LAO thin-films on\ntwo different STO substrates, which are prepared by water-leaching and buffered\nhydrofluoric acid (BHF) etching methods. The structural, transport, and optical\nproperties of LAO/STO heterostructures grown on water-leached substrates show\nthe same high-quality as the samples grown on BHF-etched substrates. These\nresults indicate that the water-leaching method can be used to grow complex\noxide heterostructures with atomically well-defined heterointerfaces without\nsafety concerns.\n", "  Within the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle it is explicitly discussed the\nimpact of these inequalities on the theory of integrated photonics at\nsub-wavelength regime. More especially, the uncertainty of the effective index\nvalues in nanophotonics at sub-wavelength regime, which is defined as the\neigenvalue of the overall opto-geometric problems in integrated photonics,\nappears directly stemming from Heisenberg's uncertainty. An apt formula is\nobtained allowing us to assume that the incertitude and the notion of\neigenvalue called effective optical index or propagation constant is inversely\nproportional to the spatial dimensions of a given nanostructure yielding a\ntransfer of the fuzziness on relevant senses of eigenvalues below a specific\nlimit's volume.\n", "  Using Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) and box counting method, we test\nspacial correlation and fractality of Polarization Pulse Profiles (PPPs) of 24\nmillisecond pulsars (MSPs) which were observed in Parkes Pulsar Timing Array\n(PPTA) project. DFA analysis indicates that MSPs' PPPs are persistent and the\nresults of box counting method confirm the fractality in the majority of PPPs.\nA Kolmogorov-Smirnov test indicates that isolated MSPs have more complex PPPs\nthan binary ones. Then we apply our analysis on a random sample of normal\npulsars. Comparing the results of our analysis on MSPs and normal pulsars shows\nthat MSPs have more complex PPPs which is resulted from smaller angular\nhalf-width of the emission cone and more peaks in MSPs PPPs. On the other hand,\nhigh values of Hurst exponent in MSPs confirm compact emission regions in these\npulsars.\n", "  The concept of magnetic nanoprobes (or magnetic nanoantennas) providing a\nmagnetic near-field enhancement and vanishing electric field is presented and\ninvestigated, together with their excitation. It is established that a\nparticular type of cylindrical vector beams called azimuthally electric\npolarized vector beams yield strong longitudinal magnetic field on the beam\naxis where the electric field is ideally null. These beams with an electric\npolarization vortex and cylindrical symmetry are important in generating high\nmagnetic to electric field contrast, i.e., large local field admittance, and in\nallowing selective excitation of magnetic transitions in matter located on the\nbeam axis. We demonstrate that azimuthally polarized vector beam excitation of\na photoinduced magnetic nanoprobe made of a magnetically polarizable nano\ncluster leads to enhanced magnetic near field with resolution beyond\ndiffraction limit. We introduce two figures of merit as magnetic field\nenhancement and local field admittance normalized to that of a plane wave that\nare useful to classify magnetic nanoprobes and their excitation. The\nperformance of magnetic nanoprobe and azimuthal polarized beams is quantified\nin comparison to other illumination options and with several defect scenarios.\n", "  We report two-dimensional quantum transport and Dirac fermions in BaMnBi2\nsingle crystals. BaMnBi2 is a layered bad metal with highly anisotropic\nconductivity and magnetic order below 290 K. Magnetotransport properties,\nnonzero Berry phase, small cyclotronmass, and the first-principles band\nstructure calculations indicate the presence of Dirac fermions in Bi square\nnets. Quantum oscillations in the Hall channel suggest the presence of both\nelectron and hole pockets, whereas Dirac and parabolic states coexist at the\nFermi level.\n", "  It is proven that the absolutely continuous spectrum of matrix\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger operators coincides (with the multiplicity taken into account)\nwith the spectrum of the unperturbed operator if the (matrix) potential is\nsquare integrable. The same result is also proven for some classes of slower\ndecaying potentials if they are smooth.\n", "  We consider an explicitly solvable model (formulated in the Riemannian\ngeometry terms) for a stationary wave process in a specific thin domain with\nthe Dirichlet boundary conditions on the boundary of the domain. The transition\nfrom the solutions of the scattering problem to the solutions of a problem on\nthe limiting quantum graph is studied. We calculate the Lagrangian gluing\nconditions at vertices for the problem on the limiting graph. If the frequency\nof the incident wave is above the bottom of the absolutely continuous spectrum,\nthe gluing conditions are formulated in terms of the scattering data of a\nproblem in a neighborhood of each vertex. Near the bottom of the absolutely\ncontinuous spectrum the wave propagation is generically suppressed, and the\ngluing condition is degenerate (any solution of the limiting problem is zero at\neach vertex).\n", "  Small diameter asymptotics is obtained for scattering solutions in a network\nof thin fibers. The asymptotics is expressed in terms of solutions of related\nproblems on the limiting quantum graph. We calculate the Lagrangian gluing\nconditions at vertices for the problems on the limiting graph. If the frequency\nof the incident wave is above the bottom of the absolutely continuous spectrum,\nthe gluing conditions are formulated in terms of the scattering data for each\nindividual junction of the network.\n"]}
