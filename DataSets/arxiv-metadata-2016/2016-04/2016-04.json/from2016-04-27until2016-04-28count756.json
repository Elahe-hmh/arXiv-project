"10.1238/Physica.Topical.088a00010"], "abstract": ["  We have extensively mapped a sample of dense molecular clouds (L1512, TMC-1C,\nL1262, Per 7, L1389, L1251E) in lines of HC3N, CH3OH, SO and C^{18}O. We\ndemonstrate that a high degree of chemical differentiation is present in all of\nthe observed clouds. We analyse the molecular maps for each cloud,\ndemonstrating a systematic chemical differentiation across the sample, which we\nrelate to the evolutionary state of the cloud. We relate our observations to\nthe cloud physical, kinematical and evolutionary properties, and also compare\nthem to the predictions of simple chemical models. The implications of this\nwork for understanding the origin of the clumpy structures and chemical\ndifferentiation observed in dense clouds are discussed.\n", "  Metastable, supersymmetry-breaking configurations can be created in flux\ngeometries by placing antibranes in warped throats. Via gauge/gravity duality,\nsuch configurations should have an interpretation as supersymmetry-breaking\nstates in the dual field theory. In this paper, we perturbatively determine the\nasymptotic supergravity solutions corresponding to anti-D3-brane probes placed\nat the tip of the cascading warped deformed conifold geometry, which is dual to\nan SU(N+M) x SU(N) gauge theory. The backreaction of the antibranes has the\neffect of introducing imaginary anti-self-dual flux, squashing the compact part\nof the space and forcing the dilaton to run. Using the generalization of\nholographic renormalization to cascading geometries, we determine the\nexpectation values of operators in the dual field theory in terms of the\nasymptotic values of the supergravity fields.\n", "  Very long wavelength universal gravitational waves cannot now produce in\nclusters of galaxies velocity dispersions greater than that which these systems\nwould possess if they were expanding with the Universe, if the Universe is not\nyounger than $10^{10}$ yr and Hubble's constant is not less than 50 km/sec/\nMpc. A diagram shows that actual velocity dispersions are significantly greater\nthan this limit.\n", "  We present the reconstruction of the Wigner function of a classical\nphase-sensitive state, a pulsed coherent state, by measurements of the\ndistributions of detected-photons of the state displaced by a coherent probe\nfield. By using a hybrid photodetector operated above its photon-resolving\nregime, we obtained both the statistics at different values of the probe field\nand the values of the probe phase required to reconstruct the Wigner function.\n", "  We report on transport operations with linear crystals of 40Ca+ ions by\napplying complex electric time-dependent potentials. For their control we use\nthe information obtained from the ions' fluorescence. We demonstrate that by\nmeans of this feedback technique, we can transport a predefined number of ions\nand also split and unify ion crystals. The feedback control allows for a robust\nscheme, compensating for experimental errors as it does not rely on a precisely\nknown electrical modeling of the electric potentials in the ion trap\nbeforehand. Our method allows us to generate a self-learning voltage ramp for\nthe required process. With an experimental demonstration of a transport with\nmore than 99.8 % success probability, this technique may facilitate the\noperation of a future ion based quantum processor.\n", "  Based upon standard angular momentum theory, we develop a framework to\ninvestigate polarization squeezing and multipartite entanglement of a quantum\nlight field. Both mean polarization and variances of the Stokes parameters are\nobtained analytically, with which we study recent observation of triphoton\nstates [L. K. Shalm {\\it et al}, Nature \\textbf{457}, 67 (2009)]. Our results\nshow that the appearance of maximally entangled NOON states accompanies with a\nflip of mean polarization and can be well understood in terms of quantum Fisher\ninformation.\n", "  Gaussian bipartite states are basic tools for the realization of quantum\ninformation protocols with continuous variables. Their complete\ncharacterization is obtained by the reconstruction of the corresponding\ncovariance matrix. Here we describe in details and experimentally demonstrate a\nrobust and reliable method to fully characterize bipartite optical Gaussian\nstates by means of a single homodyne detector. We have successfully applied our\nmethod to the bipartite states generated by a sub-threshold type-II optical\nparametric oscillator which produces a pair of thermal cross-polarized\nentangled CW frequency degenerate beams. The method provide a reliable\nreconstruction of the covariance matrix and allows to retrieve all the physical\ninformation about the state under investigation. These includes observable\nquantities, as energy and squeezing, as well as non observable ones as purity,\nentropy and entanglement. Our procedure also includes advanced tests for\nGaussianity of the state and, overall, represents a powerful tool to study\nbipartite Gaussian state from the generation stage to the detection one.\n", "  We show that coherent multiple light scattering, or diffuse light\npropagation, in a disordered atomic medium, prepared at ultra-low temperatures,\ncan be be effectively delayed in the presence of a strong control field\ninitiating a stimulated Raman process. On a relatively short time scale, when\nthe atomic system can preserve its configuration and effects of atomic motion\ncan be ignored, the scattered signal pulse, diffusely propagating via multiple\ncoherent scattering through the medium, can be stored in the spin subsystem\nthrough its stimulated Raman-type conversion into spin coherence. We\ndemonstrate how this mechanism, potentially interesting for developing quantum\nmemories, would work for the example of a coherent light pulse propagating\nthrough an alkali-metal atomic vapor under typical conditions attainable in\nexperiments with ultracold atoms.\n", "  We point out inconsistencies in the recent paper by Oughstun et al. on\nSommerfeld and Brillouin precursors [J. Opt. Soc. Am. B 27, 1664-1670 (2010)].\nTheir study is essentially numerical and, for the parameters used in their\nsimulations, the difference between the two limits considered is not as\nclear-cut as they state. The steep rise of the Brillouin precursor obtained in\nthe singular limit and analyzed as a distinguishing feature of this limit\nsimply results from an unsuitable time scale. In fact, the rise of the\nprecursor is progressive and is perfectly described by a Airy function. In the\nweak dispersion limit, the equivalence relation, established at great length in\nSection 3 of the paper, appears as an immediate result in the retarded-time\npicture. Last but not least, we show that, contrary to the authors claim, the\nprecursors are catastrophically affected by the rise-time of the incident\noptical field, even when the latter is considerably faster than the medium\nrelaxation time.\n", "  Refractive optical trapping forces can be nonconservative in the vicinity of\na stable equilibrium point even in the absence of radiation pressure. We\ndiscuss how nonconservative 3D force fields, in the vicinity of an equilibrium\npoint, reduce to circular forcing in a plane; a simple model of such forcing is\nthe refractive trapping of a sphere by a four rays. We discuss in general the\ndiffusion of an anisotropically trapped, circularly forced particle and obtain\nits spectrum of motion. Equipartition of potential energy holds even though the\nnonconservative flow does not follow equipotentials of the trap. We find that\nthe dissipated nonconservative power is proportional to temperature, providing\na mechanism for a runaway heating instability in traps.\n", "  We report analytical solutions for spatial solitons supported by layers of a\nquadratically nonlinear material embedded into a linear planar waveguide. A\nfull set of symmetric, asymmetric, and antisymmetric modes pinned to a\nsymmetric pair of the nonlinear layers is obtained. The solutions describe a\nbifurcation of the subcritical type, which accounts for the transition from the\nsymmetric to asymmetric modes. The antisymmetric states (which do not undergo\nthe bifurcation) are completely stable (the stability of the solitons pinned to\nthe embedded layers is tested by means of numerical simulations). Exact\nsolutions are also found for nonlinear layers embedded into a nonlinear\nwaveguide, including the case when the uniform and localized nonlinearities\nhave opposite signs (competing nonlinearities). For the layers embedded into\nthe nonlinear medium, stability properties are explained by comparison to the\nrespective cascading limit.\n", "  We present here the European project SciCaf\\'e - networking of science\ncaf\\'es in Europe and neighboring countries, and the contributions of the\nCSDC-Caff\\`e Scienza partner in Florence, Itay.\n", "  We show that, under appropriate oblique-incidence and polarization\nconditions, the inherent opaqueness of a homogeneous, isotropic single-negative\nslab may be perfectly compensated (in the ideal lossless case) by a homogenous,\nanisotropic (uniaxial) double-positive slab, so that complete tunneling (with\ntotal transmission and zero phase delay) occurs. We present an analytical and\nnumerical study aimed at deriving the basic design rules, elucidating the\nunderlying physical mechanisms, and exploring the role of the various involved\nparameters.\n", "  Within the framework of quantum electrodynamics (QED), vacuum is a nonlinear\nmedium which can be linearized for a rapidly time-varying electromagnetic field\nwith a small amplitude subjected to a magnetostatic field. The linearized QED\nvacuum is a uniaxial dielectric-magnetic medium for which the degree of\nanisotropy is exceedingly small. By implementing an affine transformation of\nthe spatial coordinates, the degree of anisotropy may become sufficiently large\nas to be readily perceivable. The inverse Bruggeman formalism can be\nimplemented to specify a homogenized composite material (HCM) which is\nelectromagnetically equivalent to the affinely transformed QED vacuum. This HCM\ncan arise from remarkably simple component materials; for example, two\nisotropic dielectric materials and two isotropic magnetic materials, randomly\ndistributed as oriented spheroidal particles.\n", "  Theoretical analysis is given of nonclassicality and decoherence of the field\nstates generated by adding any number of photons to the squeezed thermal state\n(STS). Based on the fact that the squeezed number state can be considered as a\nsingle-variable Hermite polynomial excited state, the compact expression of the\nnormalization factor is derived, a Legendre polynomial. The nonclassicality is\ninvestigated by exploring the sub-Poissonian and negative Wigner function (WF).\nThe results show that the WF of single photon-added STS (PASTS) always has\nnegative values at the phase space center. The decoherence effect on PASTS is\nexamined by the analytical expression of WF. It is found that a longer\nthreshold value of decay time is included in single PASTS than in single-photon\nsubtraction STS.\n", "  A scheme is proposed for calculating the entropy production in highly\ntransparent colliding systems. The formalism is continuum physical and fully\nconform with thermodynamics; and the calculation is explicit in entropy\nproduction. We have analyzed high energy heavy ion collisions from view point\nof thermodynamics. Entropy densities are calculated for reactions up 14 TeV\nenergies. Final state particle productions are predicted using particle\ngenerating quark and hadron models. We find that at LHC energy the entropy\ndensity is 67.8. From this value we could predict particle yields, too. The\nresults show that there is not yet asymptotic freedom.\n", "  We give a theoretical treatment of single atom detection in an compound,\noptical micro cavity. The cavity consists of a single mode semiconductor\nwaveguide with a gap to allow atoms to interact with the optical field in the\ncavity. Optical losses, both in the semiconductor and induced by the gap are\nconsidered and we give an estimate of the cavity finesse. We also compute the\ncooperativity parameter and show how it depends on the gap width and cavity\nlength. Maximization of the cooperativity does not always correspond to\nmaximization of the coupling.\n", "  A wide spectrum of electrokinetic studies is modelled as isothermal ones to\nexpedite analysis even when such conditions may be extremely difficult to\nrealize in practice. As a clear and novel departure from this trend, we address\nthe case of flow-induced electrohydrodynamics, commonly referred to as\nstreaming potential, in a situation where finite temperature gradients do\nindeed exist. By way of analysing a model problem of flow through a narrow\nparallel plate channel, we show that the temperature gradients have a\nsignificant effect on the streaming potential, and, consequently, on the flow\nitself. We incorporate thermoelectric effects in our model by a full-fledged\ncoupling among the electric potential, the ionic species distribution, the\nfluid velocity and the local fluid temperature fields without resorting to ad\nhoc simplifications. We expect this expository study to contribute towards more\nsophisticated future inquiries into practical micro-/nano-fluidic applications\ncoupling thermal field focusing with electrokinetic effects.\n", "  Recent progress in the study of fission barriers of actinides and superheavy\nnuclei within covariant density functional theory is overviewed.\n", "  We study recently proposed ultraviolet and infrared momentum regulators of\nthe model spaces formed by construction of a variational trial wavefunction\nwhich uses a complete set of many-body basis states based upon\nthree-dimensional harmonic oscillator (HO) functions. These model spaces are\ndefined by a truncation of the expansion characterized by a counting number\n($\\mathcal{N}$) and by the intrinsic scale ($\\hbar\\omega$) of the HO basis; in\nshort by the ordered pair ($\\mathcal{N},\\hbar\\omega$). In this study we choose\nfor $\\mathcal{N}$ the truncation parameter $N_{max}$ related to the maximum\nnumber of oscillator quanta, above the minimum configuration, kept in the model\nspace. The ultraviolet (uv) momentum cutoff of the continuum is readily mapped\nonto a defined uv cutoff in this finite model space, but there are two proposed\ndefinitions of the infrared (ir) momentum cutoff inherent in a\nfinite-dimensional HO basis. One definition is based upon the lowest momentum\ndifference given by $\\hbar\\omega$ itself and the other upon the infrared\nmomentum which corresponds to the maximal radial extent used to encompass the\nmany-body system in coordinate space. Extending both the uv cutoff to infinity\nand the ir cutoff to zero is prescribed for a converged calculation. We\ncalculate the ground state energy of light nuclei with \"bare\" and \"soft\" $NN$\ninteractions. By doing so, we investigate the behaviors of the uv and ir\nregulators of model spaces used to describe $^2$H, $^3$H, $^4$He and $^6$He\nwith $NN$ potentials Idaho N$^3$LO and JISP16. We establish practical\nprocedures which utilize these regulators to obtain the extrapolated result\nfrom sequences of calculations with model spaces characterized by\n($\\mathcal{N},\\hbar\\omega$).\n", "  Surface plasmon resonance in super-period metal nanoslits can be observed in\nthe first order diffraction as well in the zeroth order transmission. In this\npaper, surface plasmon resonance modes in various super-period gold nanoslit\narrays are investigated. It is found that the surface plasmon resonance\nfrequencies are determined by the small period of the nanoslits in super-period\nnanoslits. The number of nanoslits in the unit cell super-period and the\nnanoslit width do not control the surface plasmon resonance frequencies. It is\nalso found that the resonance wavelength observed in the first order\ndiffraction reveals more accurate the real surface plasmon resonance wavelength\nin the metal super-period nanoslit array device.\n", "  We study numerically the hydrodynamics of dip coating from a suspension and\nreport a mechanism for colloidal assembly and pattern formation on smooth and\nuniform substrates. Below a critical withdrawal speed of the substrate,\ncapillary forces required to deform the meniscus prevent colloidal particles\nfrom entering the coating film. Capillary forces are overcome by hydrodynamic\ndrag only after a minimum number of particles organize in a close-packed\nformation within the meniscus. Once within the film, the formed assembly moves\nat nearly the withdrawal speed and rapidly separates from the next assembly.\nThe interplay between hydrodynamic and capillary forces can thus produce\nperiodic and regular structures within the curved meniscus that extends below\nthe withdrawn film. The hydrodynamically-driven assembly documented here is\nconsistent with stripe pattern formations observed experimentally in the\nso-called thin-film entrainment regime.\n", "  We apply the method of asymptotic homogenization to metamaterials with\nmicroscopically bianisotropic inclusions to calculate a full set of\nconstitutive parameters in the long wavelength limit. Two different\nimplementations of electromagnetic asymptotic homogenization are presented. We\ntest the homogenization procedure on two different metamaterial examples.\nFinally, the analytical solution for long wavelength homogenization of a one\ndimensional metamaterial with microscopically bi-isotropic inclusions is\nderived.\n", "  An effort was conducted to numerically determine, using the Nonlinear\nSchrodinger Split-Step Fourier method, if using cross phase modulation could\ncause temporal soliton pulse propagation in a silicon slow-light photonic\ncrystal waveguide shorter than a millimeter. The simulations demonstrated that\ndue to the higher powers and shorter scales of photonic crystals, two-photon\nabsorption would cause an optical soliton pulse to be extremely dissipative.\nThe model demonstrated, however, that by utilizing cross-phase modulation, it\nis possible to sustain a compressed soliton pulse within a silicon photonic\ncrystal waveguide subjected to two-photon absorption over longer relative\ndistances.\n", "  It is commonly known that stable bright solitons in periodic potentials,\nwhich represent gratings in photonics/plasmonics, or optical lattices in\nquantum gases, exist either in the spectral semi-infinite gap (SIG) or in\nfinite bandgaps. Using numerical methods, we demonstrate that, under the action\nof the cubic self-focusing nonlinearity, defects in the form of \"holes\" in\ntwo-dimensional (2D) lattices support continuous families of 2D solitons\n\\textit{embedded} into the first two Bloch bands of the respective linear\nspectrum, where solitons normally do not exist. The two families of the\n\\textit{embedded defect solitons} (EDSs) are found to be continuously linked by\nthe branch of \\textit{gap defect solitons} (GDSs) populating the first finite\nbandgap. Further, the EDS branch traversing the first band links the GDS family\nwith the branch of regular defect-supported solitons populating the SIG. Thus,\nwe construct a continuous chain of regular, embedded, and gap-mode solitons\n(\"superfamily\") threading the entire bandgap structure considered here. The\nEDSs are stable in the first Bloch band, and partly stable in the second. They\nexist with the norm exceeding a minimum value, hence they do not originate from\nlinear defect modes. Further, we demonstrate that double, triple and quadruple\nlattice defects support stable dipole-mode solitons and vortices.\n", "  We consider the model of a dual-core spatial-domain coupler with chi^(2) and\nchi^(3) nonlinearities acting in two parallel cores. We construct families of\nsymmetric and asymmetric solitons in the system with self-defocusing chi^(3)\nterms, and test their stability. The transition from symmetric to asymmetric\nsoliton branches, and back to the symmetric ones proceeds via a bifurcation\nloop. A pair of stable asymmetric branches emerge from the symmetric family via\na supercritical bifurcation; eventually, the asymmetric branches merge back\ninto the symmetric one through a reverse bifurcation. The existence of the loop\nis explained by means of an extended version of the cascading approximation for\nthe chi^(2) interaction, which takes into regard the XPM part of the chi(3)\ninteraction. When the inter-core coupling is weak, the bifurcation loop\nfeatures a concave shape, with the asymmetric branches losing their stability\nat the turning points. In addition to the two-color solitons, which are built\nof the fundamental-frequency (FF) and second-harmonic (SH) components, in the\ncase of the self-focusing chi^(3) nonlinearity we also consider single-color\nsolitons, which contain only the SH component, but may be subject to the\ninstability against FF perturbations. Asymmetric single-color solitons are\nalways unstable, whereas the symmetric ones are stable, provided that they do\nnot coexist with two-color counterparts. Collisions between tilted solitons are\nstudied too.\n", "  In the next decade, a number of experiments will attempt to determine the\nneutrino mass hierarchy. Feasibility studies for such experiments generally\ndetermine the expected value of Delta chi^2. As the hierarchy is a discrete\nchoice, Delta chi^2 does not obey a one degree of freedom chi^2 distribution\nand so the number of sigmas of confidence of the hierarchy determination is not\nthe square root of the expected Delta chi^2. We present a simple formula for\nthe sensitivity to the hierarchy that can be expected from the median\nexperiment as a function of the expected Delta chi^2.\n", "  We demonstrate \"Simultaneous Unbalanced Shared Local Oscillator Heterodyne\nInterferometry (SUSHI),\" a new method for minimally destructive, high SNR\ndispersive detection of atomic spins. In SUSHI a dual-frequency probe laser\ninteracts with atoms in one arm of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, then beats\nagainst a bright local oscillator beam traversing the other arm, resulting in\ntwo simultaneous, independent heterodyne measurements of the atom-induced phase\nshift. Measurement noise due to mechanical disturbances of beam paths is\nstrongly rejected by the technique of \\emph{active subtraction} in which\nanti-noise is actively written onto the local oscillator beam via an optical\nphase-locked-loop. In SUSHI, technical noise due to phase, amplitude, and\nfrequency fluctuations of the various laser fields is strongly rejected (i) for\nany mean phase bias between the interferometer arms, (ii) without the use of\npiezo actuated mirrors, and (iii) without signal balancing. We experimentally\ndemonstrate an ultra-low technical noise limited sensitivity of 51\nnrad$/\\sqrt{\\R{Hz}}$ over a measurement bandwidth of 60 Hz to 8 kHz using a 230\n$\\mu$W probe, and stay within $\\sim$3 dB of the standard quantum limit as probe\npower is reduced by more than 5 orders of magnitude to as low as 650 pW. SUSHI\nis therefore well suited to performing QND measurements for preparing spin\nsqueezed states and for high SNR, truly continuous observations of ground-state\nRabi flopping in cold atom ensembles.\n", "  We consider the k=1 Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) model within\nloop quantum cosmology (LQC), from the perspective of the two available\nquantization prescriptions. We focus our attention on the existence of the so\ncalled `inverse corrections' in the quantization process. We derive the\ncorresponding quantum constraint operators, and study in detail the issue of\nthe self-adjointness of the quantum Hamiltonian constraint for two different\nquantizations based on open holonomies. Furthermore, we analize in detail the\nresulting effective theories, paying special attention to issues such as the\nboundedness of different scalar observables such as energy density and\nexpansion. We show that the inclusion of the inverse corrections solves one of\nthe main undesirable features of the previous formalism, namely the\nunboundedness of the energy density and expansion near the bounce on the full\n(effective) phase space. We briefly comment on possible consequences of this\nnew feature.\n", "  Boson-sampling has emerged as a promising avenue towards post-classical\noptical quantum computation, and numerous elementary demonstrations have\nrecently been performed. Spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) is the\nmainstay for single-photon state preparation, the technique employed in most\noptical quantum information processing implementations to-date. Here we present\na simple architecture for boson-sampling based on multiplexed SPDC sources and\ndemonstrate that the architecture is limited only by the post-selection\ndetection efficiency assuming that other errors, such as spectral impurity,\ndark counts, and interferometric instability are negligible. For any given\nnumber of input photons, there exists a minimum detector efficiency that allows\npost selection. If this efficiency is achieved, photon-number errors in the\nSPDC sources are sufficiently low as to guarantee correct boson-sampling most\nof the time. In this scheme the required detector efficiency must increase\nexponentially in the photon number. Thus, we show that idealised SPDC sources\nwill not present a bottleneck for future boson-sampling implementations.\nRather, photodetection efficiency is the limiting factor and thus future\nimplementations may continue to employ SPDC sources.\n", "  Nanoparticles with different surface morphologies that straddle the interface\nbetween two immiscible liquids are studied via molecular dynamics simulations.\nThe methodology employed allows us to compute the interfacial free energy at\ndifferent angular orientations of the nanoparticle. Due to their atomistic\nnature, the studied nanoparticles present both microscale and macroscale\ngeometrical features and cannot be accurately modeled as a perfectly smooth\nbody (e.g., spheres, cylinders). Under certain physical conditions, microscale\nfeatures can produce free energy barriers that are much larger than the thermal\nenergy of the surrounding media. The presence of these energy barriers can\neffectively \"lock\" the particle at specific angular orientations with respect\nto the liquid-liquid interface. This work provides new insights on the\nrotational dynamics of Brownian particles at liquid interfaces and suggests\npossible strategies to exploit the effects of microscale features with given\ngeometric characteristics.\n", "  Randomness amplification is the task of transforming a source of somewhat\nrandom bits into a source of fully random bits. Although it is impossible to\namplify randomness from a single source by classical means, the situation is\ndifferent considering non-local correlations allowed by quantum mechanics. Here\nwe give the first device-independent protocol for randomness amplification\nusing a constant number of devices. The protocol involves four devices, can\namplify any non-deterministic source into a fully random source, tolerates a\nconstant rate of error, and has its correctness based solely on the assumption\nof no-signaling between the devices. In contrast all previous protocols either\nrequired an unbounded number of devices, or could only amplify sources\nsufficiently close to fully random.\n", "  We consider quantum random walks on congested lattices and contrast them to\nclassical random walks. Congestion is modelled with lattices that contain\nstatic defects which reverse the walker's direction. We implement a dephasing\nprocess after each step which allows us to smoothly interpolate between\nclassical and quantum random walkers as well as study the effect of dephasing\non the quantum walk. Our key results show that a quantum walker escapes a\nfinite boundary dramatically faster than a classical walker and that this\nadvantage remains in the presence of heavily congested lattices. Also, we\nobserve that a quantum walker is extremely sensitive to our model of dephasing.\n", "  LIGO, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory, has been\ndesigned and constructed to measure gravitational wave strain via differential\narm length. The LIGO 4-km Michelson arms with Fabry-Perot cavities have\nauxiliary length control servos for suppressing Michelson motion of the\nbeam-splitter and arm cavity input mirrors, which degrades interferometer\nsensitivity. We demonstrate how a post-facto pipeline (AMPS) improves a data\nsample from LIGO Science Run 6 with feedforward subtraction. Dividing data into\n1024-second windows, we numerically fit filter functions representing the\nfrequency-domain transfer functions from Michelson length channels into the\ngravitational-wave strain data channel for each window, then subtract the\nfiltered Michelson channel noise (witness) from the strain channel (target). In\nthis paper we describe the algorithm, assess achievable improvements in\nsensitivity to astrophysical sources, and consider relevance to future\ninterferometry.\n", "  A three-dimensional integrable generalization of the St\\\"ackel systems is\nproposed. The classification of such systems is obtained which results in two\nfamilies. The first one is the direct sum of the two-dimensional case which is\nequivalent to the representation of the Schottky--Manakov top in the\nquasi-St\\\"ackel form and a trivial one-dimensional system. The second family is\nprobably a new three-dimensional system. The system of hydrodynamic type, which\nwe get from this family in a usual way, is a 3-dimensional generalization of\nthe Gibbons--Tsarev system. A generalization of the quasi-St\\\"ackel systems to\nthe case of any dimension is discussed.\n", "  Adsorption of proteins onto membranes can alter the local membrane curvature.\nThis phenomenon has been observed in biological processes such as endocytosis,\ntubulation and vesiculation. However, it is not clear how the local surface\nproperties of the membrane, such as membrane tension, change in response to\nprotein adsorption. In this paper, we show that the classical elastic model of\nlipid membranes cannot account for simultaneous changes in shape and membrane\ntension due to protein adsorption in a local region, and a viscous-elastic\nformulation is necessary to fully describe the system. Therefore, we develop a\nviscous-elastic model for inhomogeneous membranes of the Helfrich type. Using\nthe new viscous-elastic model, we find that the lipids flow to accommodate\nchanges in membrane curvature during protein adsorption. We show that, at the\nend of protein adsorption process, the system sustains a residual local tension\nto balance the difference between the actual mean curvature and the imposed\nspontaneous curvatures. This change in membrane tension can have a functional\nimpact in many biological phenomena where proteins interact with membranes.\n", "  The peaks of the spectra of the accretion disks surrounding massive black\nholes in quasars are in the far-UV or soft X-ray band, which are usually not\nobserved. However, in the disk corona model, the soft photons from the disk are\nComptonized to high energy in the hot corona, and the hard X-ray spectra\n(luminosity and spectral shape) contain the information of the incident spectra\nfrom the disk. The values of black hole spin parameter $a_{\\ast}$ are inferred\nfrom the spectral fitting, which spread over a large range, $\\sim -0.94$ to\n$0.998$. We find that the inclination angles and mass accretion rates are well\ndetermined by the spectral fitting, while the results are sensitive to the\naccuracy of black hole mass estimates. No tight constraints on the black hole\nspins are achieved, if the uncertainties of black hole mass measurements are a\nfactor of four, which are typical for the single-epoch reverberation mapping\nmethod. Recently, the accuracy of black hole mass measurement has been\nsignificantly improved to $0.2-0.4$~dex with velocity resolved reverberation\nmapping method (Pancoast et al., 2014). The black hole spin can be well\nconstrained if the mass measurement accuracy is $\\la 50$\\%. In the accretion\ndisk corona scenario, a fraction of power dissipated in the disk is transported\ninto the corona, and therefore the accretion disk is thinner than a bare disk\nfor the same mass accretion rate, because the radiation pressure in the disk is\nreduced. We find that the thin disk approximation, $H/R\\la 0.1$, is still valid\nif $0.3<\\dot{m}<0.5$, provided a half of the dissipated power is radiated in\nthe corona above the disk.\n", "  Boson sampling is a specific quantum computation, which is likely hard to\nimplement efficiently on a classical computer. The task is to sample the output\nphoton number distribution of a linear optical interferometric network, which\nis fed with single-photon Fock state inputs. A question that has been asked is\nif the sampling problems associated with any other input quantum states of\nlight (other than the Fock states) to a linear optical network and suitable\noutput detection strategies are also of similar computational complexity as\nboson sampling. We consider the states that differ from the Fock states by a\ndisplacement operation, namely the displaced Fock states and the photon-added\ncoherent states. It is easy to show that the sampling problem associated with\ndisplaced single-photon Fock states and a displaced photon number detection\nscheme is in the same complexity class as boson sampling for all values of\ndisplacement. On the other hand, we show that the sampling problem associated\nwith single-photon-added coherent states and the same displaced photon number\ndetection scheme demonstrates a computational complexity transition. It\ntransitions from being just as hard as boson sampling when the input coherent\namplitudes are sufficiently small, to a classically simulatable problem in the\nlimit of large coherent amplitudes.\n", "  Integrability of electron dynamics in one dimension is manifested by the\nnon-equilibrium stationary states. They emerge near a point contact coupling\ntwo quantum Hall edges with different chemical potentials. I use the\nnon-equilibrium bosonization technique to show that the effective temperature\nof such states at the fractional quantum Hall edges has a universal linear\ndependence on the current through the contact. In contrast, the temperature at\neventual equilibrium scales as the square root of the power dissipating at the\npoint contact. I propose to use this distinction to detect these intriguing\nnon-equilibrium states.\n", "  We introduce the Theoretical Astrophysical Observatory (TAO), an online\nvirtual laboratory that houses mock observations of galaxy survey data. Such\nmocks have become an integral part of the modern analysis pipeline. However,\nbuilding them requires an expert knowledge of galaxy modelling and simulation\ntechniques, significant investment in software development, and access to high\nperformance computing. These requirements make it difficult for a small\nresearch team or individual to quickly build a mock catalogue suited to their\nneeds. To address this TAO offers access to multiple cosmological simulations\nand semi-analytic galaxy formation models from an intuitive and clean web\ninterface. Results can be funnelled through science modules and sent to a\ndedicated supercomputer for further processing and manipulation. These modules\ninclude the ability to (1) construct custom observer light-cones from the\nsimulation data cubes; (2) generate the stellar emission from star formation\nhistories, apply dust extinction, and compute absolute and/or apparent\nmagnitudes; and (3) produce mock images of the sky. All of TAO's features can\nbe accessed without any programming requirements. The modular nature of TAO\nopens it up for further expansion in the future.\n", "  We provide an update on five relatively well motivated inflationary models in\nwhich the inflaton is a Standard Model singlet scalar field. These include i)\nthe textbook quadratic and quartic potential models but with additional\ncouplings of the inflaton to fermions and bosons, which enable reheating and\nalso modify the naive predictions for the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and $r$,\nii) models with Higgs and Coleman-Weinberg potentials, and finally iii) a\nquartic potential model with non-minimal coupling of the inflaton to gravity.\nFor $n_s$ values close to 0.96, as determined by the WMAP9 and Planck\nexperiments, most of the considered models predict $r\\gtrsim0.02$. The running\nof the scalar spectral index, quantified by $|\\rm{d} n_s/\\rm{d}\\ln k|$, is\npredicted in these models to be of order $10^{-4}$--$10^{-3}$.\n", "  Numerical simulations of atmospheric circulation models are limited by their\nfinite spatial resolution, and so large eddy simulation (LES) is the preferred\napproach to study these models. In LES a low-pass filter is applied to the flow\nfield to separate the large and small scale motions. In implicitly filtered LES\nthe computational mesh and discretization schemes are considered to be the\nlow-pass filter while in the explicitly filtered LES approach the filtering\nprocedure is separated from the grid and discretization operators and allows\nfor better control of the numerical errors. The aim of this paper is to study\nand compare implicitly filtered and explicitly filtered LES of atmospheric\ncirculation models in spectral space. To achieve this goal we present the\nresults of implicitly filtered and explicitly filtered LES of a barotropic\natmosphere circulation model on the sphere in spectral space and compare them\nwith the results obtained from direct numerical simulation (DNS). Our study\nshows that although in the computation of some integral quantities like total\nkinetic energy and total enstrophy the results obtained from implicitly\nfiltered LES and explicitly filtered LES show the same good agreement with the\nDNS results, explicit filtering produces energy spectra that show better\nagreement with the DNS results. More importantly, explicit filtering captures\nthe location of coherent structures over time while implicit filtering does\nnot.\n", "  We present the first J-band spectrum of Mrk 231, which reveals a large\n\\ion{He}{1}*$\\lambda 10830$ broad absorption line with a profile similar to\nthat of the well-known \\ion{Na}{1} broad absorption line. Combining this\nspectrum with optical and UV spectra from the literature, we show that the\nunusual reddening noted by \\citet{veilleux13} is explained by a reddening curve\nlike those previously used to explain low values of total-to-selective\nextinction in SNe Ia. The nuclear starburst may be the origin and location of\nthe dust. Spatially-resolved emission in the broad absorption line trough\nsuggests nearly full coverage of the continuum emission region. The broad\nabsorption lines reveal higher velocities in the \\ion{He}{1}* lines (produced\nin the quasar-photoionized \\ion{H}{2} region) compared with the \\ion{Na}{1} and\n\\ion{Ca}{2} lines (produced in the corresponding partially-ionized zone). {\\it\nCloudy} simulations show that a density increase is required between the\n\\ion{H}{2} and partially-ionized zones to produce ionic column densities\nconsistent with the optical and IR absorption line measurements and limits, and\nthat the absorber lies $\\sim 100\\rm \\, pc$ from the central engine. These\nresults suggest that the \\ion{He}{1}* lines are produced in an ordinary quasar\nBAL wind that impacts upon, compresses, and accelerates the nuclear starburst's\ndusty effluent (feedback in action), and the \\ion{Ca}{2} and \\ion{Na}{1} lines\nare produced in this dusty accelerated gas. This unusual circumstance explains\nthe rarity of \\ion{Na}{1} absorption lines; without the compression along our\nline of sight, Mrk~231 would appear as an ordinary FeLoBAL.\n", "  The fluorination of mono- and bi-layer graphene have been studied by means of\nab-initio DFT calculations. The stability of CF$_x$ systems are found to depend\non both the F coverage and on the position of the F atoms regarding the C\nsublattices. When F atoms is chemisorbed to C atoms belonging to the same\nsublattice, low coverage is preferred. Otherwise, large F coverable is more\nstable (up to C$_4$F). The difference of charge distribution between the two\ncarbon sublattices explains this finding that is confirmed by the analysis of\nthe diffusion barriers. Binding energy of F on bi-layer systems is also\ncomputed slightly smaller than on monolayer and electronic decoupling is\nobserved when only one of the layer is exposed to fluorine.\n", "  Fine structures embedded in type-IV burst continua may be used as diagnostics\nof the magnetic field restructuring and the corresponding energy release\nassociated with the low corona development of flare/CME events. A catalog of 36\ntype-IV bursts observed with the SAO receiver of the ARTEMIS-IV solar\nradio-spectrograph in the 450--270 MHz range at high cadence (0.01 sec) was\ncompiled; the fine structures were classified into five basic classes with two\nor more sub-classes each. The time of fine structure emission was compared with\nthe injection of energetic electrons as evidenced by HXR and microwave\nemission, the SXR light-curves and the CME onset time. Our results indicate a\nvery good temporal association between energy release episodes and pulsations,\nspikes, narrow-band bursts of the type-III family and zebra bursts. Of the\nremaining categories, the featureless broadband continuum starts near the time\nof the first energy release, between the CME onset and the SXR peak, but\nextends for several tens of minutes after that, covering almost the full extent\nof the flare--CME event. The intermediate drift bursts, fibers in their\nmajority, mostly follow the first energy release but have a wider distribution,\ncompared to other fine structures.\n", "  Energetic causal sets are causal sets endowed by a flow of energy-momentum\nbetween causally related events. These incorporate a novel mechanism for the\nemergence of space-time from causal relations. Here we construct a spin foam\nmodel which is also an energetic causal set model. This model is closely\nrelated to the model introduced in parallel by Wolfgang Wieland in\narXiv:1407.0025, and this construction makes use of results used there. What\nmakes a spin foam model also an energetic causal set is Wieland's\nidentification of new momenta, conserved at events (or four-simplices), whose\nnorms are not mass, but the volume of tetrahedra. This realizes the torsion\nconstraints, which are missing in previous spin foam models, and are needed to\nrelate the connection dynamics to those of the metric, as in general\nrelativity. This identification makes it possible to apply the new mechanism\nfor the emergence of space-time to a spin foam model.\n", "  In the process of constructing invariant difference schemes which approximate\npartial differential equations we write down a procedure for discretizing an\narbitrary partial differential equation on an arbitrary lattice. An open\nproblem is the meaning of a lattice which does not satisfy the\nClairaut--Schwarz--Young theorem. To analyze it we apply the procedure on a\nsimple example, the potential Burgers equation with two different lattices, an\northogonal lattice which is invariant under the symmetries of the equation and\nsatisfies the commutativity of the partial difference operators and an\nexponential lattice which is not invariant and does not satisfy the\nClairaut--Schwarz--Young theorem. A discussion on the numerical results is also\npresented showing the different behavior of both schemes for two different\nexact solutions and their numerical approximations.\n", "  We consider the problem of computing the overlaps between the Bethe states of\nthe XXZ spin-1/2 chain and generic states. We derive recursive formulas for the\noverlaps between some simple product states and off-shell Bethe states within\nthe framework of the Algebraic Bethe Ansatz. These recursive formulas can be\nused to prove in a simple and straightforward way the recently-obtained results\nfor the overlaps of the Bethe states with the N\\'eel state, the dimer state,\nand the \\textit{q}-deformed dimer state. However, these recursive formulas are\nderived for a broader class of states and represent a concrete starting point\nfor the computation of rather general overlaps. Our approach can be easily\nextended to other one-dimensional Bethe Ansatz integrable models.\n", "  The intricate interaction between the deformability of a substrate and the\ndynamic spreading of a liquid drop on the same, under the application of an\nelectrical voltage, has remained far from being well understood. Here, we\ndemonstrate that electrospreading dynamics on soft substrates is dictated by\nthe combined interplay of electrocapillarity, the wetting line friction and the\nviscoelastic energy dissipation at the contact line. Our results reveal that\nduring such electro-elastocapillarity mediated spreading of a sessile drop, the\ncontact radius evolution exhibits a universal power law in a substrate\nelasticity based non-dimensional time, with an electric potential dependent\nspreading exponent. Simultaneously, the macroscopic dynamic contact angle\nvariation follows a general power law in the contact line velocity, normalized\nby elasticity dependent characteristic velocity scale. Our results are likely\nto provide the foundation for the development of a plethora of new applications\ninvolving droplet manipulations by exploiting the interplay between\nelectrically triggered spreading and substrate-compliance over interfacial\nscales.\n", "  A general method, based on susceptibility tensors, is proposed for the\nsynthesis of metasurfaces transforming arbitrary incident waves into arbitrary\nreflected and transmitted waves. The proposed method exhibits two advantages:\n1)it is inherently vectorial, and therefore better suited for full vectorial\n(beyond paraxial) electromagnetic problems, 2) it provides closed-form\nsolutions, and is therefore extremely fast. Incidentally, the method reveals\nthat a metasurface is fundamentally capable to transform up to four independent\nwave triplets (incident, reflected and refracted waves). In addition, the paper\nprovides the closed-form expressions relating the synthesized susceptibilities\nand the scattering parameters simulated within periodic boundary conditions,\nwhich allows one to design the scattering particles realizing the desired\nsusceptibilities. The versatility of the method is illustrated by examples of\nmetasurfaces achieving the following transformations: generalized refraction,\nreciprocal and non-reciprocal polarization rotation, Bessel vortex beam\ngeneration, and orbital angular momentum multiplexing.\n", "  We study the non-perturbative renormalisation of quantum gravity in four\ndimensions. Taking care to disentangle physical degrees of freedom, we observe\nthe topological nature of conformal fluctuations arising from the functional\nmeasure. The resulting beta functions possess an asymptotically safe fixed\npoint with a global phase structure leading to classical general relativity for\npositive, negative or vanishing cosmological constant. If only the conformal\nfluctuations are quantised we find an asymptotically safe fixed point\npredicting a vanishing cosmological constant on all scales. At this fixed point\nwe reproduce the critical exponent, $\\nu = 1/3$, found in numerical lattice\nstudies by Hamber. This suggests the fixed point may be physical while solving\nthe cosmological constant problem.\n", "  We continue our studies of infrared (ir) and ultraviolet (uv) regulators of\nno-core shell model calculations. We extend our results that an extrapolation\nin the ir cutoff with the uv cutoff above the intrinsic uv scale of the\ninteraction is quite successful, not only for the eigenstates of the\nHamiltonian but also for expectation values of operators considered long range.\nThe latter results are obtained with Hamiltonians transformed by the similarity\nrenormalization group (SRG) evolution. On the other hand, a suggested\nextrapolation in the uv cutoff when the ir cutoff is below the intrinsic ir\nscale is neither robust nor reliable.\n", "  Multiplicity correlation measurements provide insight into the dynamics of\nhigh energy collisions. Models describing these collisions need these\ncorrelation measurements to tune the strengths of the underlying QCD processes\nwhich influence all observables. Detectors, however, often possess limited\ncoverage or reduced efficiency that influence correlation measurements in\nobscure ways. In this paper, the effects of non-uniform detection acceptance\nand efficiency on the measurement of multiplicity correlations between two\ndistinct detector regions (termed forward-backward correlations) are derived.\nAn analysis method with such effects built-in is developed and subsequently\nverified using different event generators. The resulting method accounts for\nacceptance and efficiency in a model independent manner with high accuracy\nthereby shedding light on the relative contributions of the underlying\nprocesses to particle production.\n", "  The two-parameter Minkowski like inequality written for composite quantum\nsystem state is obtained for arbitrary Hermitian nonnegative matrix with trace\nequal to unity. The inequality can be used as entropic and information\ninequality for density matrix of noncomposite finite quantum system, e.g., for\na single qudit state. The analogs of strong subadditivity condition for the\nsingle qudit is discussed in context of obtained Minkowski like inequality.\n", "  Two new numbers, $\\nu$ and $\\zeta$, inspired by particle-hole symmetry are\nintroduced. These numbers have extreme values at a closed shell and vanish\nmid-shell. A combination of even powers of these numbers has been used to model\nexperimentally measured quantities such as $R4/2=E(4^+_1)/E(2^+_1)$ and the\n\"microscopic\" contribution to binding energies. A binding energy fit consisting\nof a total of six fit coefficients, including one new shell term, reproduces\nthe experimental binding energies of 2353 nuclei with an r.m.s. standard\ndeviation of 1.55 MeV. The difference between the experimental and fit values\nof observables, specifically the $R4/2$, provides an indication of where shell\nclosure features are less pronounced and where sub-shells closures occur.\n", "  We consider the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer free energy functional for\nparticles interacting via a two-body potential on a microscopic scale and in\nthe presence of weak external fields varying on a macroscopic scale. We study\nthe influence of the external fields on the critical temperature. We show that\nin the limit where the ratio between the microscopic and macroscopic scale\ntends to zero, the next to leading order of the critical temperature is\ndetermined by the lowest eigenvalue of the linearization of the Ginzburg-Landau\nequation.\n", "  In this paper, we have considered $F(R,T)$ gravity as a linear function of\nthe curvature and torsion scalars and interacted it with logarithmic entropy\ncorrected holographic dark energy to evaluate cosmology solutions. The model\nhas been investigated by FRW metric, and then the energy density and the\npressure of dark energy have calculated. Also we obtained equation of state\n(EoS) parameter of dark energy and has plotted it with respect to both variable\nof cosmic time and $e$-folding number. Finally, we have described the scenario\nin three status: early, late and future time by $e$-folding number.\n", "  We propose a new approach leading to giant gain enhancement. It is based on\nunconventional slow wave resonance associated to a degenerate band edge (DBE)\nin the dispersion diagram for a special class of photonic crystals supporting\ntwo modes at each frequency. We show that the gain enhancement in a Fabry-Perot\ncavity (FPC) when operating at the DBE is several orders of magnitude stronger\nwhen compared to a cavity of the same length made of a standard photonic\ncrystal with a regular band edge (RBE). The giant gain condition is explained\nby a significant increase in the photon lifetime and in the local density of\nstates. We have demonstrated the existence of DBE operated special cavities\nthat provide for superior gain conditions for solid-state lasers, quantum\ncascade lasers, traveling wave tubes, and distributed solid state amplifiers.\nWe also report the possibility to achieve low-threshold lasing in FPC with DBE\ncompared to RBE-based lasers.\n", "  The second law of thermodynamics, formulated as an ultimate bound on the\nmaximum extractable work, has been rigorously derived in multiple scenarios.\nHowever, the unavoidable limitations that emerge due to the lack of control on\nsmall systems are often disregarded when deriving such bounds, which is\nspecifically important in the context of quantum thermodynamics. Here, we study\nthe maximum extractable work with limited control over the working system and\nits interaction with the heat bath. We derive a general second law when the set\nof accessible Hamiltonians of the working-system is arbitrarily restricted. We\nthen apply our bound to particular scenarios that are important in realistic\nimplementations: limitations on the maximum energy gap and local control over\nmany-body systems. We hence demonstrate in what precise way the lack of control\naffects the second law. In particular, contrary to the unrestricted case, we\nshow that the optimal work extraction is not achieved by simple thermal\ncontacts. Our results do not only generalize the second law to scenarios of\npractical relevance, but also take first steps in the direction of local\nthermodynamics.\n", "  We consider a cosmological model dominated by bulk viscous matter with total\nbulk viscosity coefficient proportional to the velocity and acceleration of the\nexpansion of the universe in such a way that\n$\\zeta=\\zeta_{0}+\\zeta_{1}\\frac{\\dot{a}}{a}+\\zeta_{2}\\frac{\\ddot{a}}{\\dot{a}}.$\nWe show that there exist two limiting conditions in the bulk viscous\ncoefficients, ($\\zeta_{0}$, $\\zeta_{1}$, $\\zeta_{2}$) which corresponds to a\nuniverse having a Big-Bang at the origin, followed by an early decelerated\nepoch and then making a smooth transition into an accelerating epoch. We have\nconstrained the model using the type Ia Supernovae data, evaluated the best\nestimated values of all the bulk viscous parameters and the Hubble parameter\ncorresponding to the two limiting conditions. We found that even though the\nevolution of the cosmological parameters are in general different for the two\nlimiting cases, they show identical behavior for the best estimated values of\nthe parameters from both the limiting conditions. A recent acceleration would\noccur if $\\tilde{\\zeta}_{0}+\\tilde{\\zeta}_{1}>1$ for the first limiting\nconditions and if $\\tilde{\\zeta}_{0}+\\tilde{\\zeta}_{1}<1$ for the second\nlimiting conditions. The age of the universe predicted by this model is found\nto be less than that predicted from the oldest galactic globular clusters. The\ntotal bulk viscosity seems to be negative in the past and becomes positive when\n$z\\leq0.8$. So the model violates the local second law of thermodynamics.\nHowever, the model satisfies the generalized second law of thermodynamics at\nthe apparent horizon throughout the evolution of the universe. We also made a\nstatefinder analysis of the model and found that it is distinguishably\ndifferent from the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model at present, but shows a de\nSitter type behavior in the far future of the evolution.\n", "  We present polarization measurements of extragalactic radio sources observed\nduring the Cosmic Microwave Background polarization survey of the Q/U Imaging\nExperiment (QUIET), operating at 43 GHz (Q-band) and 95 GHz (W-band). We\nexamine sources selected at 20 GHz from the public, $>$40 mJy catalog of the\nAustralia Telescope (AT20G) survey. There are $\\sim$480 such sources within\nQUIET's four low-foreground survey patches, including the nearby radio galaxies\nCentaurus A and Pictor A. The median error on our polarized flux density\nmeasurements is 30--40 mJy per Stokes parameter. At S/N $> 3$ significance, we\ndetect linear polarization for seven sources in Q-band and six in W-band; only\n$1.3 \\pm 1.1$ detections per frequency band are expected by chance. For sources\nwithout a detection of polarized emission, we find that half of the sources\nhave polarization amplitudes below 90 mJy (Q-band) and 106 mJy (W-band), at 95%\nconfidence. Finally, we compare our polarization measurements to intensity and\npolarization measurements of the same sources from the literature. For the four\nsources with WMAP and Planck intensity measurements $>1$ Jy, the polarization\nfraction are above 1% in both QUIET bands. At high significance, we compute\npolarization fractions as much as 10--20% for some sources, but the effects of\nsource variability may cut that level in half for contemporaneous comparisons.\nOur results indicate that simple models---ones that scale a fixed polarization\nfraction with frequency---are inadequate to model the behavior of these sources\nand their contributions to polarization maps.\n", "  In the framework of MSSM the probability of $Z^0$-boson decay to charginos in\na strong electromagnetic field, $Z^0\\rightarrow \\chi ^{+} \\chi ^{-}$, is\nanalyzed. The method of calculations employs exact solutions of relativistic\nwave equations for charginos in a crossed electromagnetic field. Analytic\nexpression for the decay width $\\Gamma(Z^{0}\\rightarrow \\chi ^{+} \\chi ^{-})$\nis obtained at an arbitrary value of the parameter $\\varkappa=e\nm_Z^{-3}\\sqrt{-(F_{\\mu\\nu}q^\\nu)^2}$, which characterizes the external-field\nstrength $F_{\\mu\\nu}$ and $Z^0$-boson momentum $q^{\\nu}$. The process\n$Z^0\\rightarrow \\chi ^{+} \\chi ^{-}$ is forbidden in vacuum for the case of\nrelatively heavy charginos: $M_{\\chi^{\\pm}} > m_Z/2$. However in an intense\nelectromagnetic background this reaction could take place in the region of\nsuperstrong fields ($\\varkappa > 1$).\n", "  We compute the supersymmetric partition function of the six-dimensional\n$(2,0)$ theory of type $A_{N-1}$ on $S^1 \\times S^5$ in the presence of both\ncodimension two and codimension four defects. We concentrate on a limit of the\npartition function depending on a single parameter. From the allowed\nsupersymmetric configurations of defects we find a precise match with the\ncharacters of irreducible modules of $W_N$ algebras and affine Lie algebras of\ntype $A_{N-1}$.\n", "  The Glauber-Sudarshan diagonal `weight' function provides a natural divide\nbetween the quantum-optical notion of classical and nonclassical states of\ncontinuous variables systems. Based on this demarcation, a channel is said to\nbe nonclassicality breaking if it outputs only classical states for any input\nstate. We focus on multimode bosonic Gaussian channels and classify those that\nare nonclassicality breaking by introducing a criterion that needs to be\nsatisfied by the matrices representing these channels. The criterion can be\ninterpreted as a nonclassicality benchmark for these channels since it\nquantifies the threshold noise at which there is a complete nonclassical to\nclassical transition of the output states, i.e., it quantifies the robustness\nof the nonclassicality of the outputs of the channel against Gaussian noise. We\nthen prove a striking `duality' between nonclassicality breaking and\nentanglement breaking bosonic Gaussian channels.\n", "  Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms are invaluable tools for exploring\nstationary properties of physical systems, especially in situations where\ndirect sampling is unfeasible. Common implementations of Monte Carlo algorithms\nemploy reversible Markov chains. Reversible chains obey detailed balance and\nthus ensure that the system will eventually relax to equilibrium. Detailed\nbalance is not necessary for convergence to equilibrium. We review\nnonreversible Markov chains, which violate detailed balance, and yet still\nrelax to a given target stationary distribution. In particular cases,\nnonreversible Markov chains are substantially better at sampling than the\nconventional reversible Markov chains with up to a square root improvement in\nthe convergence time to the steady state. One kind of nonreversible Markov\nchain is constructed from the reversible ones by enlarging the state space and\nby modifying and adding extra transition rates to create non-reversible moves.\nBecause of the augmentation of the state space, such chains are often referred\nto as lifted Markov Chains. We illustrate the use of lifted Markov chains for\nefficient sampling for several examples. The examples include sampling on a\nring, sampling on a torus, the Ising model on a complete graph, and the\none-dimensional Ising model. We also provide a pseudocode implementation,\nreview related work, and discuss the applicability of such methods.\n", "  Strictly speaking the laws of the conventional Statistical Physics, based on\nthe Equipartition Postulate and Ergodicity Hypothesis, apply only in the\npresence of a heat bath. Until recently this restriction was not important for\nreal physical systems: a weak coupling with the bath was believed to be\nsufficient. However, the progress in both quantum gases and solid state\ncoherent quantum devices demonstrates that the coupling to the bath can be\nreduced dramatically. To describe such systems properly one should revisit the\nvery foundations of the Statistical Mechanics. We examine this general problem\nfor the case of the Josephson junction chain and show that it displays a novel\nhigh temperature non-ergodic phase with finite resistance. With further\nincrease of the temperature the system undergoes a transition to the fully\nlocalized state characterized by infinite resistance and exponentially long\nrelaxation.\n", "  Quantum interfaces between photons and ensembles of atoms have emerged as\npowerful tools for quantum technologies. A major objective for such interfaces\nis high fidelity storage and retrieval of a photon in a collective quantum\nstate of many atoms. This requires long-lived collective superposition states,\nwhich is typically achieved with immobilized atoms. Thermal atomic vapors,\nwhich present a simple and scalable resource, have, so far, only been used for\ncontinuous variable processing or for discrete variable processing on short\ntime scales where atomic motion is negligible. We develop a theory based on the\nconcept of motional averaging to enable room temperature discrete variable\nquantum memories and coherent single photon sources. We show that by choosing\nthe interaction time so that atoms kept under spin protecting conditions can\ncross the light beam several times during the interaction combined with\nsuitable spectral filtering, we erase the \"which atom\" information and obtain\nan efficient and homogenous coupling between all atoms and the light. Heralded\nsingle excitations can thus be created and stored as collective spinwaves,\nwhich can later be read out to produce coherent single photons in a scalable\nfashion. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach to scalable quantum\nmemories with a proof-of-principle experiment with room temperature atoms\ncontained in microcells with spin protecting coating, placed inside an optical\ncavity. The experiment is performed at conditions corresponding to a few\nphotons per pulse and clearly demonstrates a long coherence time of the forward\nscattered photons, which is the essential feature of the motional averaging.\n", "  We study the topological structure of matter-light excitations, so called\npolaritons, in a quantum spin Hall insulator coupled to photonic cavity modes.\nWe identify a topological invariant in the presence of time reversal (TR)\nsymmetry, and demonstrate the existence of a TR-invariant topological phase. We\nfind protected helical edge states with energies below the lower polariton\nbranch and characteristic uncoupled excitonic states, both detectable by\noptical techniques. Applying a Zeeman field allows us to relate the topological\nindex to the double coverage of the Bloch sphere by the polaritonic pseudospin.\n", "  In this paper we investigate consequences of an assumption that the\ndiscrepancy of the predicted and observed W+W- production cross sections at the\nLHC is caused by the missing contribution of the double Drell-Yan process\n(DDYP). Using our simple model of DDYP of Ref. [1] we show that inclusion of\nthis production mechanism leads to a satisfactory, parameter-free description\nof the two-lepton mass distribution for 0-jet W+W- events and the four-lepton\nmass distribution for ZZ events. In such a scenario the Higgs-boson\ncontribution is no longer necessary to describe the data. An experimental\nprogramme to prove or falsify such an assumption is proposed.\n", "  In this paper, we study the one-way local operations and classical\ncommunication (LOCC) problem. In $\\mathbb{C}^d\\otimes\\mathbb{C}^d$ with\n$d\\geq4$, we construct a set of $3\\lceil\\sqrt{d}\\rceil-1$ one-way LOCC\nindistinguishable maximally entangled states which are generalized Bell states.\nMoreover, we show that there are four maximally entangled states which cannot\nbe perfectly distinguished by one-way LOCC measurements for any dimension\n$d\\geq 4$.\n", "  A large number of terrestrial planets in the classical habitable zone of\nstars of different spectral types has already been discovered and many are\nexpected to be discovered in near future. However, owing to the lack of\nknowledge on the atmospheric properties, the ambient environment of such\nplanets are unknown. It is known that sufficient amount of Extreme Ultraviolet\n(EUV) radiation from the star can drive hydrodynamic outflow of hydrogen that\nmay drag heavier species from the atmosphere of the planet. If the rate of mass\nloss is sufficiently high then substantial amount of volatiles would escape\ncausing the planet to become uninhabitable. Considering energy-limited\nhydrodynamical mass loss with an escape rate that causes oxygen to escape\nalongwith hydrogen, I present an upper limit for the ratio between the EUV and\nthe bolometric luminosities of stars which constrains the habitability of\nplanets around them. Application of the limit to planet-hosting stars with\nknown EUV luminosities implies that many M-type of stars should not have\nhabitable planets around them.\n", "  It has been shown previously that the DM in galactic halos can be explained\nby a self-gravitating system of massive keV fermions (`inos') in thermodynamic\nequilibrium, and predicted the existence of a denser quantum core of inos\ntowards the center of galaxies. In this article we show that the inclusion of\nself-interactions among the inos, modeled within a relativistic\nmean-field-theory approach, allows the quantum core to become massive and\ncompact enough to explain the dynamics of the S-cluster stars closest to the\nMilky Way's galactic center. The application of this model to other galaxies\nsuch as large elliptical harboring massive central dark objects of $\\sim 10^9\nM_\\odot$ is also investigated. We identify these interacting inos with sterile\nright-handed neutrinos pertaining to minimal extensions of the Standard Model,\nand calculate the corresponding total cross-section $\\sigma$ within an\nelectroweak-like formalism to be compared with other observationally inferred\ncross-section estimates. The coincidence of an ino mass range of few tens of\nkeV derived here only from the galactic structure, with the range obtained\nindependently from other astrophysical and cosmological constraints, points\ntowards an important role of the right-handed neutrinos in the cosmic\nstructure.\n", "  The relatively low key rate seems to be the major barrier to its practical\nuse for the decoy state measurement device independent quantum key distribution\n(MDIQKD).\n  We present a 4-intensity protocol for the decoy-state MDIQKD that hugely\nraises the key rate, especially in the case the total data size is not large.\n  Also, calculation shows that our method makes it possible for secure private\ncommunication with {\\em fresh} keys generated from MDIQKD with a delay time of\nonly a few seconds.\n", "  Due to the increasing number of industrial applications of electro-active\npolymers (EAPs), there is a growing need for electromechanical models which\naccurately capture their behavior. To this end, we compare the predicted\nbehavior of EAPs undergoing homogenous deformations according to three\nelectromechanical models. The first model is a continuum based model composed\nof the mechanical Gent model and a linear relationship between the electric\nfield and the polarization. The electrical and the mechanical responses\naccording to the second model are based on the polymer microstructure, whereas\nthe third model incorporates a neo-Hookean mechanical response and a\nmicrostructural based long-chains model for the electrical behavior. In the\nmicrostructural motivated models the integration from the microscopic to the\nmacroscopic levels is accomplished by the micro-sphere technique. Four types of\nhomogeneous boundary conditions are considered and the behaviors determined\naccording to the three models are compared. The differences between the\npredictions of the models are discussed, highlighting the need for an in-depth\ninvestigation of the relations between the structure and the behaviors of the\nEAPs at microscopic level and their overall macroscopic response.\n", "  In the present paper, we compare the predictions of two well known mechanisms\nconsidered able to solve the cusp/core problem (a. supernova feedback; b.\nbaryonic clumps-DM interaction) by comparing their theoretical predictions to\nrecent observations of the inner slopes of galaxies with masses ranging from\ndSphs to normal spirals. We compare the $\\alpha$-$V_{\\rm rot}$ and the\n$\\alpha$-$M_{\\ast}$ relationships, predicted by the two models with high\nresolution data coming from \\citep{Adams2014,Simon2005}, LITTLE THINGS\n\\citep{Oh2015}, THINGS dwarves \\citep{Oh2011a,Oh2011b}, THINGS spirals\n\\citep{Oh2015}, Sculptor, Fornax and the Milky Way. The comparison of the\ntheoretical predictions with the complete set of data shows that the two models\nperform similarly, while when we restrict the analysis to a smaller subsample\nof higher quality, we show that the method presented in this paper (baryonic\nclumps-DM interaction) performs better than the one based on supernova\nfeedback. We also show that, contrarily to the first model prediction, dSphs of\nsmall mass could have cored profiles. This means that observations of cored\ninner profiles in dSphs having a stellar mass $<10^6 M_{\\odot}$ not necessarily\nimply problems for the $\\Lambda$CDM model.\n", "  This work presents an extensive study of the previously discovered formation\nof bipolar flux concentrations in a two-layer model. We interpret the formation\nprocess in terms of negative effective magnetic pressure instability (NEMPI),\nwhich is a possible mechanism to explain the origin of sunspots. In our\nsimulations, we use a Cartesian domain of isothermal stratified gas that is\ndivided into two layers. In the lower layer, turbulence is forced with\ntransverse nonhelical random waves, whereas in the upper layer no flow is\ninduced. A weak uniform magnetic field is imposed in the entire domain at all\ntimes. In this study we vary the stratification by changing the gravitational\nacceleration, magnetic Reynolds number, strength of the imposed magnetic field,\nand size of the domain to investigate their influence on the formation process.\nBipolar magnetic structure formation takes place over a large range of\nparameters. The magnetic structures become more intense for higher\nstratification until the density contrast becomes around $100$ across the\nturbulent layer. For the Reynolds numbers considered, magnetic flux\nconcentrations are generated at magnetic Prandtl number between 0.1 and 1. The\nmagnetic field in bipolar regions increases with higher imposed field strength\nuntil the field becomes comparable to the equipartition field strength of the\nturbulence. A larger horizontal extent enables the flux concentrations to\nbecome stronger and more coherent. The size of the bipolar structures turns out\nto be independent of the domain size. In the case of bipolar region formation,\nwe find an exponential growth of the large-scale magnetic field, which is\nindicative of a hydromagnetic instability. Additionally, the flux\nconcentrations are correlated with strong large-scale downward and converging\nflows. These findings imply that NEMPI is responsible for magnetic flux\nconcentrations.\n", "  Recently, the cosmological deceleration-acceleration transition redshift in\n$f(R)$ gravity has been considered in order to address consistently the problem\nof cosmic evolution. It is possible to show that the deceleration parameter\nchanges sign at a given redshift according to observational data. Furthermore,\na $f(R)$ gravity cosmological model can be constructed in brane-antibrane\nsystem starting from the very early universe and accounting for the\ncosmological redshift at all phases of cosmic history, from inflation to late\ntime acceleration. Here we propose a $f(R)$ model where transition redshifts\ncorrespond to inflation-deceleration and deceleration-late time acceleration\ntransitions starting froma BIon system. At the point where the universe was\nborn, due to the transition of $k$ black fundamental strings to the BIon\nconfiguration, the redshift is approximately infinity and decreases with\nreducing temperature ($z\\sim T^{2}$). The BIon is a configuration in flat space\nof a universe-brane and a parallel anti-universe-brane connected by a wormhole.\nThis wormhole is a channel for flowing energy from extra dimensions into our\nuniverse, occurring at inflation and decreasing with redshift as $z\\sim\nT^{4+1/7}$. Dynamics consists with the fact that the wormhole misses its energy\nand vanishes as soon as inflation ends and deceleration begins. Approaching two\nuniverse branes together, a tachyon is originated, it grows up and causes the\nformation of a wormhole. We show that, in the framework of $f(R)$ gravity, the\ncosmological redshift depends on the tachyonic potential and has a significant\ndecrease at deceleration-late time acceleration transition point ($z\\sim\nT^{2/3}$). As soon as today acceleration approaches, the redshift tends to zero\nand the cosmological model reduces to the standard $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology.\n", "  We explore the viability of a boson dark matter candidate with an asymmetry\nbetween the number densities of particles and antiparticles. A simple thermal\nfield theory analysis confirms that, under certain general conditions, this\ncomponent would develop a Bose-Einstein condensate in the early universe that,\nfor appropriate model parameters, could survive the ensuing cosmological\nevolution until now. The condensation of a dark matter component in equilibrium\nwith the thermal plasma is a relativistic process, hence the amount of matter\ndictated by the charge asymmetry is complemented by a hot relic density frozen\nout at the time of decoupling. Contrary to the case of ordinary WIMPs, dark\nmatter particles in a condensate must be lighter than a few tens of eV so that\nthe density from thermal relics is not too large. Big-Bang nucleosynthesis\nconstrains the temperature of decoupling to the scale of the QCD phase\ntransition or above. This requires large dark matter-to-photon ratios and very\nweak interactions with standard model particles.\n", "  We generalize the Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk theory considering non-diagonal\nboundary conditions in the Bogoliubov-de Gennes scattering problem, to describe\nanomalous conductance features often reported for normal-metal/superconductor\ncontacts. We calculate the differential conductance spectra showing that\nconductance dips, not expected in the standard formulation, are explained in\nterms of phase \\pi-shift, between the bulk and the interface order parameter,\npossibly induced by a localized magnetic moment. A discretized model is used to\ngive quantitative evaluation of the physical conditions, namely the\npolarization and transparency of the interface, needed to realize the phase\ngradient.\n", "  We use a macromodel of a flow-driven deterministic lateral displacement (DLD)\nmicrofluidic system to investigate conditions leading to size-separation of\nsuspended particles. This model system can be easily reconfigured to establish\nan arbitrary orientation between the average flow field and the array of\nobstacles comprising the stationary phase (forcing angle). We also investigate\nthe effect of obstacle size using two arrays with different obstacles but same\nsurface-to-surface distance between them. In all cases, we observe the presence\nof a locked mode at small forcing angles, in which particles move along a\nprincipal direction in the lattice until a locked-to-zigzag transition takes\nplace when the driving force reaches a critical angle. We show that the\ntransition occurs at increasing angles for larger particles, thus enabling\nparticle separation at specific forcing angles. Moreover, we observe a linear\ncorrelation between the critical angle and the size of the particles that could\nbe used in the design of microfluidic systems with a fixed orientation of the\nflow field. Finally, we present a simple model, based on the presence of\nirreversible interactions between the suspended particles and the obstacles,\nwhich describes the observed dependence of the migration angle on the\norientation of the average flow.\n", "  We consider the problem of risk diversification in complex networks. Nodes\nrepresent e.g. financial actors, whereas weighted links represent e.g.\nfinancial obligations (credits/debts). Each node has a risk to fail because of\nlosses resulting from defaulting neighbors, which may lead to large failure\ncascades. Classical risk diversification strategies usually neglect network\neffects and therefore suggest that risk can be reduced if possible losses\n(i.e., exposures) are split among many neighbors (exposure diversification,\nED). But from a complex networks perspective diversification implies higher\nconnectivity of the system as a whole which can also lead to increasing failure\nrisk of a node. To cope with this, we propose a different strategy (damage\ndiversification, DD), i.e. the diversification of losses that are imposed on\nneighboring nodes as opposed to losses incurred by the node itself. Here, we\nquantify the potential of DD to reduce systemic risk in comparison to ED. For\nthis, we develop a branching process approximation that we generalize to\nweighted networks with (almost) arbitrary degree and weight distributions. This\nallows us to identify systemically relevant nodes in a network even if their\ndirected weights differ strongly. On the macro level, we provide an analytical\nexpression for the average cascade size, to quantify systemic risk.\nFurthermore, on the meso level we calculate failure probabilities of nodes\nconditional on their system relevance.\n", "  We study the prediction of the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale\nStructures (EFTofLSS) for the matter power spectrum at different redshifts. In\nprevious work, we found that the two-loop prediction can match the nonlinear\npower spectrum measured from $N$-body simulations at redshift zero within\napproximately 2% up to $k\\sim 0.6\\,h\\, {\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ after fixing a single\nfree parameter, the so-called \"speed of sound\". We determine the time evolution\nof this parameter by matching the EFTofLSS prediction to simulation output at\ndifferent redshifts, and find that it is well-described by a fitting function\nthat only includes one additional parameter. After the two free parameters are\nfixed, the prediction agrees with nonlinear data within approximately 2% up to\nat least $k\\sim 1\\,h\\, {\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ at $z\\geq 1$, and also within\napproximately 5% up to $k\\sim 1.2\\,h\\, {\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ at $z=1$ and $k\\sim\n2.3\\,h\\, {\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ at $z=3$, a major improvement with respect to other\nperturbative techniques. We also develop an accurate way to estimate where the\nEFTofLSS predictions at different loop orders should fail, based on the sizes\nof the next-order terms that are neglected, and find agreement with the actual\ncomparisons to data. Finally, we use our matter power spectrum results to\nperform analytical calculations of lensing potential power spectra\ncorresponding to both CMB and galaxy lensing. This opens the door to future\ndirect applications of the EFTofLSS to observations of gravitational clustering\non cosmic scales.\n", "  We obtain new examples of partially supersymmetric M-brane solutions defined\non products of Ricci-flat manifolds, which contain two-dimensional Lorentzian\nsubmanifold R^{1,1}_{*}/Z_2 with one parallel spinor. The examples belong to\nthe following configurations: M2, M5, M2-M5 and M5-M5. Among them a M2 solution\nwith N =1/32 fractional number of preserved supersymmetries is presented. The\nexamples with three M-branes were considered earlier in our paper with A.A.\nGolubtsova.\n", "  We consider three cosmological models with linear interaction between the\ndark components and obtain restrictions on the coupling constant in terms of\nthe cosmographic parameters. It enables us to find constraints on the coupling\nconstant directly based on observational data and to restrict number of\nnumerous models describing interaction in the dark sector.\n", "  We identify a Weyl semimetal state in an inversion breaking, stoichiometric\ncompound strontium silicide, SrSi$_2$, with many new and novel properties that\nare distinct from the TaAs family. We theoretically show that SrSi$_2$ is a\nWeyl semimetal even without spin-orbit coupling and that, after the inclusion\nof spin-orbit coupling, two Weyl fermions stick together forming an exotic\ndouble Weyl fermion with quadratic dispersions and a higher chiral topological\ncharge of 2. Moreover, we find that the Weyl nodes with opposite charges are\nlocated at different energies due to the absence of mirror symmetry in\nSrSi$_2$, leading to a unique topological quantum response that an external\nmagnetic field can induce a dissipationless current. Our systematic results not\nonly identify a much-needed robust Weyl semimetal candidate but also open the\ndoor to new topological Weyl physics that is not possible in the TaAs family of\nmaterials.\n", "  Topological materials and their unusual transport properties are now at the\nfocus of modern experimental and theoretical research. Their topological\nproperties arise from the bandstructure determined by the atomic composition of\na material and as such are difficult to tune and naturally restricted to\n$\\leq3$ dimensions. Here we demonstrate that $n$-terminal Josephson junctions\nwith conventional superconductors may provide a straightforward realization of\ntunable topological materials in $n-1$ dimensions. For $n\\geq 4$, the Andreev\nsubgap spectrum of the junction can accommodate Weyl singularities in the space\nof the $n-1$ independent superconducting phases, which play the role of\nbandstructure quasimomenta. The presence of these Weyl singularities enables\ntopological transitions that are manifested experimentally as changes of the\nquantized transconductance between two voltage-biased leads, the quantization\nunit being $2e^2/(\\pi\\hbar)$.\n", "  The dynamical response of edge waves under the influence of self-gravity is\nexamined in an idealized two-dimensional model of a proto-stellar disc,\ncharacterized in steady state as a rotating vertically infinite cylinder of\nfluid with constant density except for a single density interface at some\nradius r0. The fluid in basic state is prescribed to rotate with a Keplerian\nprofile $\\Omega_k(r)\\sim r^{-3/2}$ modified by some additional azimuthal\nsheared flow. A linear analysis shows that there are two azimuthally\npropagating edge waves, kin to the familiar Rossby waves and surface gravity\nwaves in terrestrial studies, which move opposite to one another with respect\nto the local basic state rotation rate at the interface. Instability only\noccurs if the radial pressure gradient is opposite to that of the density jump\n(unstably stratified) where self-gravity acts as a wave stabilizer irrespective\nof the stratification of the system. The propagation properties of the waves\nare discussed in detail in the language of vorticity edge waves. The roles of\nboth Boussinesq and non-Boussinesq effects upon the stability and propagation\nof these waves with and without the inclusion of self-gravity are then\nquantified. The dynamics involved with self-gravity non- Boussinesq effect is\nshown to be a source of vorticity production where there is a jump in the basic\nstate density, in addition, self-gravity also alters the dynamics via the\nradial main pressure gradient, which is a Boussinesq effect . Further\napplications of these mechanical insights are presented in the conclusion\nincluding the ways in which multiple density jumps or gaps may or may not be\nstable.\n", "  We report on the global temporal pulse characteristics of individual\nharmonics in an attosecond pulse train by means of photo-electron streaking in\na strong low-frequency transient. The scheme allows direct retrieval of pulse\ndurations and first order chirp of individual harmonics without the need of\ntemporal scanning. The measurements were performed using an intense THz field\ngenerated by tilted phase front technique in LiNbO_3 . Pulse properties for\nharmonics of order 23, 25 and 27 show that the individual pulse durations and\nlinear chirp are decreasing by the harmonic order.\n", "  This study presents a method for approximating the multidimensional effects\nof Rayleigh-Taylor instability as a modification of the one-dimensional hydro\nequations. This modification is similar to the Shakura-Sunyaev {\\alpha}\nprescription for modeling the coarse-grained effects of turbulence in\nastrophysical disks. The model introduces several dimensionless tunable\nparameters that are calibrated by comparing with high-resolution\ntwo-dimensional axisymmetric numerical calculations of Rayleigh-Taylor unstable\nflows. A complete description of the model is presented, along with a handful\nof test problems that demonstrate the extent to which the one-dimensional model\nis able to reproduce multidimensional effects.\n", "  The three-phase contact line formed by the intersection of a liquid-vapor\ninterface of an electrolyte solution with a charged planar substrate is studied\nin terms of classical density functional theory applied to a lattice model. The\ninfluence of the substrate charge density and of the ionic strength of the\nsolution on the intrinsic structure of the three-phase contact line and on the\ncorresponding line tension is analyzed. We find a negative line tension for all\nvalues of the surface charge density and of the ionic strength considered. The\nstrength of the line tension decreases upon decreasing the contact angle via\nvarying either the temperature or the substrate charge density.\n", "  AMS-02 recently published its lepton spectra measurement. The results show\nthat the positron fraction no longer increases above $\\sim$200 GeV. The aim of\nthis work is to investigate the possibility that the excess of positron\nfraction is due to pulsars. Nearby known pulsars from ATNF catalogue are\nconsidered as a possible primary positron source of the high energy positrons.\nWe find that the pulsars with age $T\\simeq (0.45\\sim4.5)\\times10^{5}$ yr and\ndistance $d<0.5$ kpc can explain the behavior of positron fraction of AMS-02 in\nthe range of high energy. We show that each of the four pulsars --- Geminga,\nJ1741-2054, Monogem and J0942-5552 --- is able to be a single source satisfying\nall considered physical requirements. We also discuss the possibility that\nthese high energy $e^{\\pm}$ are from multiple pulsars. The multiple pulsars\ncontribution predicts a positron fraction with some structures at higher\nenergies.\n", "  This paper presents an extensive overview of known and proposed RR Lyrae\nstars in binaries. The aim is to revise and extend the list with new Galactic\nfield systems. We utilized maxima timings for eleven RRab type stars with\nsuspicious behaviour from the GEOS database, and determined maxima timings from\ndata of sky surveys and our own observations. This significantly extended the\nnumber of suitable maxima timings. We modelled the proposed Light Time Effect\n(LiTE) in O-C diagrams to determine orbital parameters for these systems. In\ncontrast to recent studies, our analysis focused on decades-long periods\ninstead of periods in the order of years. Secondary components were found to be\npredominantly low-mass objects. However, for RZ Cet and AT Ser the mass of the\nsuspected companion of more than one solar mass suggests that it is a massive\nwhite dwarf, a neutron star or even a black hole. We found that the semi-major\naxes of the proposed orbits are between 1 and 20 au. Because the studied stars\nbelong to the closest RR Lyraes, maximal angular distances between components\nduring orbit should at least be between 1 and 13 mas and this improves the\nchance to detect both stars using current telescopes. However, our\ninterpretation of the O-C diagrams as a consequence of the LiTE should be\nconsidered as preliminary without reliable spectroscopic measurements. On the\nother hand our models give a prediction of the period and radial velocity\nevolution which should be sufficient for plausible proof of binarity.\n", "  We measure the clustering of X-ray, radio, and mid-IR-selected active\ngalactic nuclei (AGN) at 0.2 < z < 1.2 using multi-wavelength imaging and\nspectroscopic redshifts from the PRIMUS and DEEP2 redshift surveys, covering 7\nseparate fields spanning ~10 square degrees. Using the cross-correlation of AGN\nwith dense galaxy samples, we measure the clustering scale length and slope, as\nwell as the bias, of AGN selected at different wavelengths. Similar to previous\nstudies, we find that X-ray and radio AGN are more clustered than\nmid-IR-selected AGN. We further compare the clustering of each AGN sample with\nmatched galaxy samples designed to have the same stellar mass, star formation\nrate, and redshift distributions as the AGN host galaxies and find no\nsignificant differences between their clustering properties. The observed\ndifferences in the clustering of AGN selected at different wavelengths can\ntherefore be explained by the clustering differences of their host populations,\nwhich have different distributions in both stellar mass and star formation\nrate. Selection biases inherent in AGN selection, therefore, determine the\nclustering of observed AGN samples. We further find no significant difference\nbetween the clustering of obscured and unobscured AGN, using IRAC or WISE\ncolors or X-ray hardness ratio.\n", "  We present measurements from the PHENIX experiment of large parity-violating\nsingle spin asymmetries of high transverse momentum electrons and positrons\nfrom $W^\\pm/Z$ decays, produced in longitudinally polarized $p$$+$$p$\ncollisions at center of mass energies of $\\sqrt{s}$=500 and 510~GeV. These\nasymmetries allow direct access to the anti-quark polarized parton distribution\nfunctions due to the parity-violating nature of the $W$-boson coupling to\nquarks and anti-quarks. The results presented are based on data collected in\n2011, 2012, and 2013 with an integrated luminosity of 240 pb$^{-1}$, which\nexceeds previous PHENIX published results by a factor of more than 27. These\nhigh $Q^2$ data provide an important addition to our understanding of\nanti-quark parton helicity distribution functions.\n", "  We present the spectral analysis of an 87~ks \\emph{XMM-Newton} observation of\nDraco, a nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxy. Of the approximately 35 robust X-ray\nsource detections, we focus our attention on the brightest of these sources,\nfor which we report X-ray and multiwavelength parameters. While most of the\nsources exhibit properties consistent with AGN, few of them possess\ncharacteristics of LMXBs and CVs. Our analysis puts constraints on population\nof X-ray sources with $L_X>3\\times10^{33}$~erg~s$^{-1}$ in Draco suggesting\nthat there are no actively accreting BH and NS binaries. However, we find 4\nsources that could be LMXBs/CVs in quiescent state associated with Draco. We\nalso place constraints on the central black hole luminosity and on a dark\nmatter decay signal around 3.5~keV.\n", "  We develop a renormalisation scheme for time--ordered products in interacting\nfield theories on curved spacetimes which consists of an analytic\nregularisation of Feynman amplitudes and a minimal subtraction of the resulting\npole parts. This scheme is directly applicable to spacetimes with Lorentzian\nsignature, manifestly generally covariant, invariant under any spacetime\nisometries present and constructed to all orders in perturbation theory.\nMoreover, the scheme captures correctly the non--geometric state--dependent\ncontribution of Feynman amplitudes and it is well--suited for practical\ncomputations. To illustrate this last point, we compute explicit examples on a\ngeneric curved spacetime, and demonstrate how momentum space computations in\ncosmological spacetimes can be performed in our scheme. In this work, we\ndiscuss only scalar fields in four spacetime dimensions, but we argue that the\nrenormalisation scheme can be directly generalised to other spacetime\ndimensions and field theories with higher spin, as well as to theories with\nlocal gauge invariance.\n", "  We have proposed a model for relativistic compact star with anisotropy and\nanalytically obtained exact spherically symmetric solutions describing the\ninterior of the dense star admitting non-static conformal symmetry. Several\nfeatures of the solutions including drawbacks of the model have been explored\nand discussed. For this purpose we have provided the energy conditions,\nTOV-equations and other physical requirements and thus thoroughly investigated\nstability, mass-radius relation and surface redshift of the model. It is\nobserved that most of the features are well matched with the compact stars,\nlike quark/strange stars.\n", "  Scientific studies of society increasingly rely on digital traces produced by\nvarious aspects of human activity. In this paper, we use a relatively\nunexplored source of data, anonymized records of bank card transactions\ncollected in Spain by a big European bank, in order to propose a new\nclassification scheme of cities based on the economic behavior of their\nresidents. First, we study how individual spending behavior is qualitatively\nand quantitatively affected by various factors such as customer's age, gender,\nand size of a home city. We show that, similar to other socioeconomic urban\nquantities, individual spending activity exhibits a statistically significant\nsuperlinear scaling with city size. With respect to the general trends, we\nquantify the distinctive signature of each city in terms of residents' spending\nbehavior, independently from the effects of scale and demographic\nheterogeneity. Based on the comparison of city signatures, we build a novel\nclassification of cities across Spain in three categories. That classification\nis, with few exceptions, stable over different ways of city definition and\nconnects with a meaningful socioeconomic interpretation. Furthermore, it\nappears to be related with the ability of cities to attract foreign visitors,\nwhich is a particularly remarkable finding given that the classification was\nbased exclusively on the behavioral patterns of city residents. This highlights\nthe far-reaching applicability of the presented classification approach and its\nability to discover patterns that go beyond the quantities directly involved in\nit.\n", "  Gradient sensing requires at least two measurements at different points in\nspace. These measurements must then be communicated to a common location to be\ncompared, which is unavoidably noisy. While much is known about the limits of\nmeasurement precision by cells, the limits placed by the communication are not\nunderstood. Motivated by recent experiments, we derive the fundamental limits\nto the precision of gradient sensing in a multicellular system, accounting for\ncommunication and temporal integration. The gradient is estimated by comparing\na \"local\" and a \"global\" molecular reporter of the external concentration,\nwhere the global reporter is exchanged between neighboring cells. Using the\nfluctuation-dissipation framework, we find, in contrast to the case when\ncommunication is ignored, that precision saturates with the number of cells\nindependently of the measurement time duration, since communication establishes\na maximum lengthscale over which sensory information can be reliably conveyed.\nSurprisingly, we also find that precision is improved if the local reporter is\nexchanged between cells as well, albeit more slowly than the global reporter.\nThe reason is that while exchange of the local reporter weakens the comparison,\nit decreases the measurement noise. We term such a model \"regional\nexcitation--global inhibition\" (REGI). Our results demonstrate that fundamental\nsensing limits are necessarily sharpened when the need to communicate\ninformation is taken into account.\n", "  Numerical simulations of self-gravitating systems are generally based on\nN-body codes, which solve the equations of motion of a large number of\ninteracting particles. This approach suffers from poor statistical sampling in\nregions of low density. In contrast, Vlasov codes, by meshing the entire phase\nspace, can reach higher accuracy irrespective of the density. Here, we\nperformed one-dimensional Vlasov simulations of a long-standing cosmological\nproblem, namely the fractal properties of an expanding Einstein-de Sitter\nuniverse in Newtonian gravity. The N-body results were confirmed for\nhigh-density regions and extended to regions of low matter density, where the\nN-body approach usually fails.\n", "  We apply improved nucleon-nucleon potentials up to fifth order in chiral\neffective field theory, along with a new analysis of the theoretical truncation\nerrors, to study nucleon-deuteron (Nd) scattering and selected low-energy\nobservables in 3H, 4He, and 6Li. Calculations beyond second order differ from\nexperiment well outside the range of quantified uncertainties, providing truly\nunambiguous evidence for missing three-nucleon forces within the employed\nframework. The sizes of the required three-nucleon force contributions agree\nwell with expectations based on Weinberg's power counting. We identify the\nenergy range in elastic Nd scattering best suited to study three-nucleon force\neffects and estimate the achievable accuracy of theoretical predictions for\nvarious observables.\n", "  The eigenvalues of a non-Hermitian Hamilton operator are complex and provide\nnot only the energies but also the lifetimes of the states of the system. They\nshow a non-analytical behavior at singular (exceptional) points (EPs). The\neigenfunctions are biorthogonal, in contrast to the orthogonal eigenfunctions\nof a Hermitian operator. A quantitative measure for the ratio between\nbiorthogonality and orthogonality is the phase rigidity of the wavefunctions.\nAt and near an EP, the phase rigidity takes its minimum value. The lifetimes of\ntwo nearby eigenstates of a quantum system bifurcate under the influence of an\nEP. When the parameters are tuned to the point of maximum width bifurcation,\nthe phase rigidity suddenly increases up to its maximum value. This means that\nthe eigenfunctions become almost orthogonal at this point. This unexpected\nresult is very robust as shown by numerical results for different classes of\nsystems. Physically, it causes an irreversible stabilization of the system by\ncreating local structures that can be described well by a Hermitian Hamilton\noperator. Interesting non-trivial features of open quantum systems appear in\nthe parameter range in which a clustering of EPs causes a dynamical phase\ntransition.\n", "  We study the dynamics of network-coupled phase oscillators in the presence of\ncoupling frustration. It was recently demonstrated that in heterogeneous\nnetwork topologies, the presence of coupling frustration causes perfect phase\nsynchronization to become unattainable even in the limit of infinite coupling\nstrength. Here, we consider the important case of heterogeneous coupling\nfunctions and extend previous results by deriving analytical predictions for\nthe total erosion of synchronization. Our analytical results are given in terms\nof basic quantities related to the network structure and coupling frustration.\nIn addition to fully heterogeneous coupling, where each individual interaction\nis allowed to be distinct, we also consider partially heterogeneous coupling\nand homogeneous coupling in which the coupling functions are either unique to\neach oscillator or identical for all network interactions, respectively. We\ndemonstrate the validity of our theory with numerical simulations of multiple\nnetwork models, and highlight the interesting effects that various coupling\nchoices and network models have on the total erosion of synchronization.\nFinally, we consider some special network structures with well-known spectral\nproperties, which allows us to derive further analytical results.\n", "  The authors propose a new modeling approach based on the impedance field\nmethod (IFM) to analyze the general geometric variations in device simulations.\nCompared with the direct modeling of multiple variational devices, the proposed\ngeometric variation (GV) model shows a better efficiency thanks to its IFM\nbased nature. Compared with the existing random geometric fluctuation (RGF)\nmodel where the noise sources are limited to the interfaces, the present GV\nmodel provides better accuracy and wider application areas as it transforms the\ngeometric variation into global mesh deformation and computes the noise sources\ninduced by the geometric variation in the whole simulation domain. GV model\nalso provides great insights into the device by providing the effective noise\nsources, equation-wise contributions, and sensitivity maps that are useful for\ndevice characterization and optimization.\n", "  Light curves of microlensing events involving stellar binaries and planetary\nsystems can provide information about the orbital elements of the system due to\norbital modulations of the caustic structure. Accurately measuring the orbit in\neither the stellar or planetary case requires detailed modeling of subtle\ndeviations in the light curve. At the same time, the natural, Cartesian\nparameterization of a microlensing binary is partially degenerate with the\nmicrolens parallax. Hence, it is desirable to perform independent tests of the\npredictions of microlens orbit models using radial velocity time series of the\nlens binary system. To this end, we present 3.5 years of RV monitoring of the\nbinary lens system OGLE-2009-BLG-020L, for which Skowron et al. (2011)\nconstrained all internal parameters of the 200--700 day orbit. Our RV\nmeasurements reveal an orbit that is consistent with the predictions of the\nmicrolens light curve analysis, thereby providing the first confirmation of\norbital elements inferred from microlensing events.\n", "  Non-thermal pressure from turbulence and bulk flows is a fundamental\ningredient in hot gaseous halos, and in the intracluster medium it will be\nmeasured through emission line kinematics with calorimeters on future X-ray\nspacecraft. In this paper we present a complementary method for measuring these\neffects, using forbidden FUV emission lines of highly ionized Iron which trace\n$10^7$ K gas. The brightest of these is [Fe XXI] $\\lambda$1354.1. We search for\nthese lines in archival HST-COS spectra from the well-known elliptical galaxies\nM87 and NGC4696, which harbor large reservoirs of $10^7$ K gas. We report a\n2.2$\\sigma$ feature which we attribute to [Fe XXI] from a filament in M87, and\npositive residuals in the nuclei of M87 and NGC4696, for which the 90\\% upper\nlimits on the line flux are close to the predicted fluxes based on X-ray\nobservations. In a newer reduction of the data from the Hubble Spectroscopic\nLegacy Archive, these limits become tighter and the [Fe XXI] feature reaches a\nformal significance of 5.3$\\sigma$, neglecting uncertainty in fitting the\ncontinuum. Using our constraints, we perform emission measure analysis,\nconstraining the characteristic path length and column density of the\n$\\sim10^7$ K gas. We also examine several sightlines towards filaments or\ncooling flows in other galaxy clusters, for which the fraction of gas at $10^7$\nK is unknown, and place upper limits on its emission measure in each case. A\nmedium-resolution HST-COS observation of the M87 filament for $\\sim$10 orbits\nwould confirm our detection of [Fe XXI] and measure its width.\n", "  We discuss the transport properties of a disordered two-dimensional electron\ngas with strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling. We show that in the high-density\nregime where the Fermi energy overcomes the energy associated with spin-orbit\ncoupling, dc transport is accurately described by a standard Drude's law, due\nto a non-trivial compensation between the suppression of back-scattering and\nthe relativistic correction to the quasi-particle velocity. On the contrary,\nwhen the system enters the opposite dominant spin-orbit regime, Drude's\nparadigm breaks down and the dc conductivity becomes strongly sensitive to the\nspin-orbit coupling strength, providing a suitable tool to test the\nentanglement between spin and charge degrees of freedom in these\n", "  The multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of a protein family provides a wealth\nof information in terms of the conservation pattern of amino acid residues not\nonly at each alignment site but also between distant sites. In order to\nstatistically model the MSA incorporating both short-range and long-range\ncorrelations as well as insertions, I have derived a lattice gas model of the\nMSA based on the principle of maximum entropy. The partition function, obtained\nby the transfer matrix method with a mean-field approximation, accounts for all\npossible alignments with all possible sequences. The model parameters for\nshort-range and long-range interactions were determined by a self-consistent\ncondition and by a Gaussian approximation, respectively. Using this model with\nand without long-range interactions, I analyzed the globin and V-set domains by\nincreasing the \"temperature\" and by \"mutating\" a site. The correlations between\nresidue conservation and various measures of the system's stability indicate\nthat the long-range interactions make the conservation pattern more specific to\nthe structure, and increasingly stabilize better conserved residues.\n", "  Assuming the form of the entropic dark energy as arises form the surface term\nin the Einstein-Hilbert's action, it's evolution were analyzed in an expanding\nflat universe. The model parameters were evaluated by constraining model using\nthe Union data on Type Ia supernovae. We found that the model predicts an early\ndecelerated phase and a later accelerated phase at the background level. The\nevolution of the Hubble parameter, dark energy density, equation of state\nparameter and deceleration parameter were obtained. The model is diagnosed with\n$Om$ parameter. The model is hardly seems to be supporting the linear\nperturbation growth for the structure formation. We also found that the\nentropic dark energy shows phantom nature for redshifts $z<0.257.$ During the\nphantom epoch, the model predicts big-rip effect at which both the scale factor\nof expansion and the dark energy density become infinitely large and the big\nrip time is found to be around 36 Giga Years from now.\n", "  Scalable quantum technologies require faithful conversion between matter\nqubits storing the quantum information and photonic qubits carrying the\ninformation in integrated circuits and waveguides. We demonstrate that the\nelectromagnetic field chirality which arises in nanophotonic waveguides leads\nto unidirectional emission from an embedded quantum dot quantum emitter, with\nresultant in-plane transfer of matter-qubit (spin) information. The chiral\nbehavior occurs despite the non-chiral geometry and material of the waveguides.\nUsing dot registration techniques we achieve a quantum emitter\ndeterministically positioned at a chiral point and realize spin-path conversion\nby design. We measure and compare the phenomena in single mode nanobeam and\nphotonic crystal waveguides. The former is much more tolerant to dot position,\nexhibits experimental spin-path readout as high as 95 +/- 5% and has potential\nto serve as the basis of future spin-logic and network implementations.\n", "  The Planck mission detected thousands of extragalactic radio sources at\nfrequencies from 28 to 857 GHz. Planck's calibration is absolute (in the sense\nthat it is based on the satellite's annual motion around the Sun and the\ntemperature of the cosmic microwave background), and its beams are well\ncharacterized at sub-percent levels. Thus Planck's flux density measurements of\ncompact sources are absolute in the same sense. We have made coordinated VLA\nand ATCA observations of 65 strong, unresolved Planck sources in order to\ntransfer Planck's calibration to ground-based instruments at 22, 28, and 43\nGHz. The results are compared to microwave flux density scales currently based\non planetary observations. Despite the scatter introduced by the variability of\nmany of the sources, the flux density scales are determined to 1-2% accuracy.\nAt 28 GHz, the flux density scale used by the VLA runs 3.6% +- 1.0% below\nPlanck values; at 43 GHz, the discrepancy increases to 6.2% +- 1.4% for both\nATCA and the VLA.\n", "  Social behaviors are often contagious, spreading through a population as\nindividuals imitate the decisions and choices of others. A variety of global\nphenomena, from innovation adoption to the emergence of social norms and\npolitical movements, arise as a result of people following a simple local rule,\nsuch as copy what others are doing. However, individuals often lack global\nknowledge of the behaviors of others and must estimate them from the\nobservations of their friends' behaviors. In some cases, the structure of the\nunderlying social network can dramatically skew an individual's local\nobservations, making a behavior appear far more common locally than it is\nglobally. We trace the origins of this phenomenon, which we call \"the majority\nillusion,\" to the friendship paradox in social networks. As a result of this\nparadox, a behavior that is globally rare may be systematically overrepresented\nin the local neighborhoods of many people, i.e., among their friends. Thus, the\n\"majority illusion\" may facilitate the spread of social contagions in networks\nand also explain why systematic biases in social perceptions, for example, of\nrisky behavior, arise. Using synthetic and real-world networks, we explore how\nthe \"majority illusion\" depends on network structure and develop a statistical\nmodel to calculate its magnitude in a network.\n", "  The complementarity between signaling and randomness in any communicated\nresource that can simulate singlet statistics is generalized by relaxing the\nassumption of free will in the choice of measurement settings. We show how to\nconstruct an ontological extension for quantum mechanics (QM) through the\noblivious embedding of a sound simulation protocol in a Newtonian spacetime.\nMinkowski or other intermediate spacetimes are ruled out as the locus of the\nembedding by virtue of hidden influence inequalities. The complementarity\ntransferred from a simulation to the extension unifies a number of results\nabout quantum nonlocality, and implies that special relativity (SR) has a\ndifferent significance for the ontological model and for the operational theory\nit reproduces. Only the latter, being experimentally accessible, is required to\nbe Lorentz covariant. There may be certain Lorentz non-covariant elements at\nthe ontological level, but they will be inaccessible at the operational level\nin a valid extension. Certain arguments against the extendability of QM, due to\nConway and Kochen (2009) and Colbeck and Renner (2012), are attributed to their\nassumption that the spacetime at the ontological level has Minkowski causal\nstructure.\n", "  An analysis method is proposed to study the forward-backward (FB)\nmultiplicity fluctuation in high-energy nuclear collisions, built on the\nearlier work of Bzdak and Teaney. The method allows the decomposition of the\ncentrality dependence of average multiplicity from the dynamical event-by-event\n(EbyE) fluctuation of multiplicity in pseudorapidity. Application of the method\nto AMPT and HIJING models shows that the long-range component of the FB\ncorrelation is captured by a few longitudinal harmonics, with the first\ncomponent driven by the asymmetry in the number of participating nucleons in\nthe two colliding nuclei. The higher-order longitudinal harmonics are found to\nbe strongly damped in AMPT compare to HIJING, due to weaker short-range\ncorrelations as well as the final-state effects present in the AMPT model.\nTwo-particle pseudorapidity correlation reveals interesting charge-dependent\nshort-range structures that are absent in HIJING model. The proposed method\nopens an avenue to elucidate the particle production mechanism and early time\ndynamics in heavy-ion collisions. Future analysis directions and prospects of\nusing the pseudorapidity correlation function to understand the centrality bias\nin $p$+$p$, $p$+A and A+A collisions are discussed.\n", "  The continuum-fitting method is one of the two most advanced methods of\ndetermining the black hole spin in accreting X-ray binary systems. There are,\nhowever, still some unresolved issues with the underlying disk models. One of\nthem manifests as an apparent decrease in spin for increasing source\nluminosity. Here, we perform a few simple tests to establish whether outflows\nfrom the disk close to the inner radius can address this problem. We employ\nfour different parametric models to describe the wind and compare these to the\napparent decrease in spin with luminosity measured in the sources LMC~X-3 and\nGRS~1915+105. Wind models in which parameters do not explicitly depend on the\naccretion rate cannot reproduce the spin measurements. Models with mass\naccretion rate dependent outflows, however, have spectra that emulate the\nobserved ones. The assumption of a wind thus effectively removes the artifact\nof spin decrease. This solution is not unique; the same conclusion can be\nobtained with a truncated inner disk model. To distinguish among valid models,\nhigh resolution X-ray data and a realistic description of the Comptonization in\nthe wind will be needed.\n", "  We report on the observation of single-photon superradiance from an exciton\nin a semiconductor quantum dot. The confinement by the quantum dot is strong\nenough for it to mimic a two-level atom, yet sufficiently weak to ensure\nsuperradiance. The electrostatic interaction between the electron and the hole\ncomprising the exciton gives rise to an anharmonic spectrum, which we exploit\nto prepare the superradiant quantum state deterministically with a laser pulse.\nWe observe a five-fold enhancement of the oscillator strength compared to\nconventional quantum dots. The enhancement is limited by the base temperature\nof our cryostat and may lead to oscillator strengths above 1000 from a single\nquantum emitter at optical frequencies.\n", "  Solutions to the hierarchy problem usually require top partners. In standard\nSUSY or composite Higgs theories, the partners carry SM color and are becoming\nincreasingly constrained by LHC searches. However, theories like Folded SUSY\n(FS), Twin Higgs (TH) and Quirky Little Higgs (QLH) introduce uncolored top\npartners, which can be SM singlets or carry electroweak charge. Their small\nproduction cross section left doubt as to whether the LHC can effectively probe\nsuch scenarios. Typically, these partners are charged under their own mirror\ncolor gauge group. In FS and QLH, the absence of light mirror matter allows\nglueballs to form at the bottom of the mirror spectrum. This is also the case\nin some TH realizations. The Higgs can decay to these mirror glueballs, with\nthe glueballs decaying into SM particles with potentially observable lifetimes.\nWe undertake the first detailed study of this glueball signature and\nquantitatively demonstrate the discovery potential of uncolored naturalness via\nexotic Higgs decays at the LHC and a potential future 100 TeV collider. Our\nfindings indicate that mirror glueballs are the smoking gun signature of\nnatural FS and QLH type theories, in analogy to tree-level Higgs coupling\nshifts for the TH. We show that glueball masses in the $\\sim$ 10-60 GeV mass\nrange are theoretically preferred. Careful treatment of lifetime,\nmirror-hadronization and nonperturbative uncertainties is required to perform\nmeaningful collider studies. We outline several new search strategies for\nexotic Higgs decays of the form $h\\to XX \\to 4f$ at the LHC, with $X$ having\nlifetimes in the $10 \\mu m$ to $km$ range. We find that FS stops can be probed\nwith masses up to 600 (1100) GeV at the LHC with 300 (3000) /fb of data, and TH\ntop partners could be accessible with masses up to 900 (1500) GeV. This makes\nexotic Higgs decays the prime discovery channel for uncolored naturalness at\nthe LHC.\n", "  Crystal structures of $\\textrm{CLi}_4$ compounds are explored through\n\\emph{ab} \\emph{initio} evolutionary methodology. Phase transition from metal\nto semimetal and semiconductor, and eventually to insulator with increasing\npressure are revealed under pressure. Pressure-induced evolution of\nanti-metallization has been described quantitatively by Fermi Surface Filling\nRatio and electron energy band gap using \\emph{ab} \\emph{initio} \\emph{GW}\ncalculations. Anti-metallization is attributed to the hybrid valence electrons\nand their repulsion by core electrons into the lattice interstices. Very weak\nelectron-phonon coupling interactions are found in the metallic phases,\nresulting in very low superconducting temperature.\n", "  An NLO QCD analysis of the final HERMES data on pion multiplicities is\npresented and a new set of pion fragmentation functions is extracted from the\nbest fit to the data. We have studied the so-called [x,z] and [Q^2,z]\npresentations of their data, as given by HERMES, which, in principle, should\nsimply be two different ways of presenting the experimental data. We have based\nour extraction on an excellent fit to the [Q^2,z] presentation of the data. We\nalso draw attention to what appears to be a problem with the [x,z] presentation\nof the HERMES data.\n", "  We introduce a quantum-optical notion of nonclassicality that we call as the\nprocess output nonclassicality for multimode quantum channels. The motivation\ncomes from an information-theoretic point of view and the emphasis is on the\noutput states of a channel. We deem a channel to be `classical' if its outputs\nare always classical irrespective of the input, i.e., if the channel is\nnonclassicality breaking, and nonclassical otherwise. Our condition is stronger\nthan the one considered by Rahimi-Keshari et al. [PRL {\\bf 110}, 160401 (2013)]\nand we compare the two approaches. Using our framework we then quantify the\nnonclassicality of a quantum process by introducing a noise-robustness type of\nmeasure that we call as the nonclassicality depth of a channel. It\ncharacterizes a certain threshold noise beyond which a given channel outputs\nonly classical states. We achieve this by generalizing a prescription by Lee\n[PRA {\\bf 44}, R2775 (1991)] to multimode states and then by extension to\nmultimode channels.\n", "  In this paper, the t-channel charged Higgs production at LHC is studied.\nProduction process is a t-channel single top event with charged Higgs exchange.\nTherefore the signal is similar with Standard Model single top production in\nterms of the final state. In the first step, the signal cross section is\ncalculated and compared to the other main production processes which are used\nfor a heavy charged Higgs search at LHC, i.e., pp -> tbH- and pp -> H+ -> tb.\nIn the next step, an event generation and analysis is applied on signal and\nbackground events, in order to estimate the signal significance. The signal\ncross section is typically smaller than the associated production (tbH-) and\nresonance production (tb) by a factor of 10-3 and ranges from 10 fb to 1 fb for\ncharged Higgs mass from 200 to 500 GeV at tanbeta = 50. Due to the small cross\nsection of signal events and large SM background, the signal significance is\nsmall even after a dedicated kinematic analysis and selection of events,\nhowever, tanbeta values above 120 can be excluded at an integrated luminosity\nof 3000 fb-1.\n", "  In this paper a new theory is developed for the self - assembly of\nassociating molecules confined to a single spatial dimension, but allowed to\nexplore all orientation angles. The interplay of the anisotropy of the pair\npotential and the low dimensional space, results in orientationally ordered\nassociated clusters. This local order enhances association due to a decrease in\norientational entropy. Unlike bulk 3D fluids which are orientationally\nhomogeneous, association in 1D necessitates the self - consistent calculation\nof the orientational distribution function. To test the new theory, Monte Carlo\nsimulations are performed and the theory is found to be accurate. The theory\ndeveloped in this paper may be used as a tool to study hydrogen bonding of\nmolecules in 1D zeolites as well as hydrogen bonding of water in carbon\nnanotubes.\n", "  Bacterial biofilms are usually assumed to originate from individual cells\ndeposited on a surface. However, many biofilm-forming bacteria tend to\naggregate in the planktonic phase so that it is possible that many natural and\ninfectious biofilms originate wholly or partially from pre-formed cell\naggregates. Here, we use agent-based computer simulations to investigate the\nrole of pre-formed aggregates in biofilm development. Focusing on the initial\nshape the aggregate forms on the surface, we find that the degree of spreading\nof an aggregate on a surface can play an important role in determining its\neventual fate during biofilm development. Specifically, initially spread\naggregates perform better when competition with surrounding unaggregated\nbacterial cells is low, while initially rounded aggregates perform better when\ncompetition with surrounding unaggregated cells is high. These contrasting\noutcomes are governed by a trade-off between aggregate surface area and height.\nOur results provide new insight into biofilm formation and development, and\nreveal new factors that may be at play in the social evolution of biofilm\ncommunities.\n", "  Nowadays superconductors serve in numerous applications, from high-field\nmagnets to ultra-sensitive detectors of radiation. Mesoscopic superconducting\ndevices, i.e. those with nanoscale dimensions, are in a special position as\nthey are easily driven out of equilibrium under typical operating conditions.\nThe out-of-equilibrium superconductors are characterized by non-equilibrium\nquasiparticles. These extra excitations can compromise the performance of\nmesoscopic devices by introducing, e.g., leakage currents or decreased\ncoherence times in quantum devices. By applying an external magnetic field, one\ncan conveniently suppress or redistribute the population of excess\nquasiparticles. In this article we present an experimental demonstration and a\ntheoretical analysis of such effective control of quasiparticles, resulting in\nelectron cooling both in the Meissner and vortex states of a mesoscopic\nsuperconductor. We introduce a theoretical model of quasiparticle dynamics\nwhich is in quantitative agreement with the experimental data.\n", "  Light harvesting by photosystem II (PSII) in plants is highly efficient and\nacclimates to rapid changes in the intensity of sunlight. However, the\nmechanisms of PSII light harvesting have remained experimentally inaccessible.\nUsing a structure-based model of excitation energy flow in 200 nanometer (nm) x\n200 nm patches of the grana membrane, where PSII is located, we accurately\nsimulated chlorophyll fluorescence decay data with no free parameters.\nExcitation movement through the light harvesting antenna is diffusive, but\nbecomes subdiffusive in the presence of charge separation at reaction centers.\nThe influence of membrane morphology on light harvesting efficiency is\ndetermined by the excitation diffusion length of 50 nm in the antenna. Our\nmodel provides the basis for understanding how nonphotochemical quenching\nmechanisms affect PSII light harvesting in grana membranes.\n", "  Recently it was argued that gravity with the squire of the Ricci tensor can\nbe stabilized by adding constraints to the theory. This was so far demonstrated\nfor fluctuations on the Minkowski/de Sitter background. We show that the same\nscheme works equally well for removing Ostrogradski's ghost from fluctuations\non a cosmological background in generic\n$f(R,R_{\\mu\\nu}^2,C_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}^2)$-type theories of gravity. We also\nderive the general formula for the spectrum of primordial tensor perturbations\nfrom the stabilized theory.\n", "  Electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions are two major driving\nforces that stabilize various charge-ordered phases of matter. The intricate\ninterplay between the two give rises to a peculiar charge density wave (CDW)\nstate, which is also known as a Mott insulator, as the ground state of layered\ncompound 1T-TaS2. The delicate balance also makes it possible to use external\nperturbations to create and manipulate novel phases in this material. Here, we\nstudy a mosaic CDW phase induced by voltage pulses from the tip of a scanning\ntunneling microscope (STM), and find that the new phase exhibit electronic\nstructures that are entirely different from the Mott ground state of 1T-TaS2 at\nlow temperatures. The mosaic phase consists of nanometer-sized domains\ncharacterized by well-defined phase shifts of the CDW order parameter in the\ntopmost layer, and by altered stacking relative to the layer underneath. We\ndiscover that the nature of the new phases is dictated by the stacking order,\nand our results shed fresh light on the origin of the Mott phase in this\nlayered compound.\n", "  The Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) are six clusters of galaxies, all showing\nindications of recent mergers, which have recently been observed for lensed\nimages. As such they are the natural laboratories to study the merging history\nof galaxy clusters. In this work, we explore the 2D power spectrum of the mass\ndistribution $P_{\\rm M}(k)$ as a measure of substructure. We compare $P_{\\rm\nM}(k)$ of these clusters (obtained using strong gravitational lensing) to that\nof $\\Lambda$CDM simulated clusters of similar mass. To compute lensing $P_{\\rm\nM}(k)$, we produced free-form lensing mass reconstructions of HFF clusters,\nwithout any light traces mass (LTM) assumption. The inferred power at small\nscales tends to be larger if (i)~the cluster is at lower redshift, and/or\n(ii)~there are deeper observations and hence more lensed images. In contrast,\nlens reconstructions assuming LTM show higher power at small scales even with\nfewer lensed images; it appears the small scale power in the LTM\nreconstructions is dominated by light information, rather than the lensing\ndata. The average lensing derived $P_{\\rm M}(k)$ shows lower power at small\nscales as compared to that of simulated clusters at redshift zero, both\ndark-matter only and hydrodynamical. The possible reasons are: (i)~the\navailable strong lensing data are limited in their effective spatial resolution\non the mass distribution, (ii)~HFF clusters have yet to build the small scale\npower they would have at $z\\sim 0$, or (iii)~simulations are somehow\noverestimating the small scale power.\n", "  Many-body systems with both coherent dynamics and dissipation constitute a\nrich class of models which are nevertheless much less explored than their\ndissipationless counterparts. The advent of numerous experimental platforms\nthat simulate such dynamics poses an immediate challenge to systematically\nunderstand and classify these models. In particular, nontrivial many-body\nstates emerge as steady states under non-equilibrium dynamics. While these\nstates and their phase transitions have been studied extensively with mean\nfield theory, the validity of the mean field approximation has not been\nsystematically investigated. In this paper, we employ a field-theoretic\napproach based on the Keldysh formalism to study nonequilibrium phases and\nphase transitions in a variety of models. In all cases, a complete description\nvia the Keldysh formalism indicates a partial or complete failure of the mean\nfield analysis. Furthermore, we find that an effective temperature emerges as a\nresult of dissipation, and the universal behavior including the dynamics near\nthe steady state is generically described by a thermodynamic universality\nclass.\n", "  Supersymmetry is the most natural framework for physics above the TeV scale,\nand the corresponding framework for early-Universe cosmology, including\ninflation, is supergravity. No-scale supergravity emerges from generic string\ncompactifications and yields a non-negative potential, and is therefore a\nplausible framework for constructing models of inflation. No-scale inflation\nyields naturally predictions similar to those of the Starobinsky model based on\n$R + R^2$ gravity, with a tilted spectrum of scalar perturbations: $n_s \\sim\n0.96$, and small values of the tensor-to-scalar perturbation ratio $r < 0.1$,\nas favoured by Planck and other data on the cosmic microwave background (CMB).\nDetailed measurements of the CMB may provide insights into the embedding of\ninflation within string theory as well as its links to collider physics.\n", "  We present extensive observations of the Type Ib/c SN2013ge from -13 to +457\ndays, including spectra and Swift UV-optical photometry beginning 2-4 days\npost-explosion. This data set makes SN2013ge one of the best observed normal\nType Ib/c SN at early times---when the light curve is particularly sensitive to\nthe progenitor configuration and mixing of radioactive elements---and reveals\ntwo distinct light curve components in the UV bands. The first component rises\nover 4-5 days and is visible for the first week post-explosion. Spectra of the\nfirst component have blue continua and show a plethora of high velocity\n(~15,000 km/s) but narrow (~3500 km/s) features, indicating that the\nline-forming region is restricted. The explosion parameters estimated for the\nbulk explosion are standard for Type Ib/c SN, and there is evidence for weak He\nfeatures at early times. In addition, SN2013ge exploded in a low metallicity\nenvironment and we have obtained some of the deepest radio and X-ray limits for\na Type Ib/c SN to date, which constrain the progenitor mass-loss rate. We are\nleft with two distinct progenitor scenarios for SN2013ge, depending on our\ninterpretation of the early emission. If the first component is cooling\nenvelope emission, then the progenitor of SN2013ge either possessed a low-mass\nextended envelope or ejected a portion of its envelope in the final <1 year\nbefore core-collapse. Alternatively, if the first component is due to outwardly\nmixed Ni-56, then our observations are consistent with the asymmetric ejection\nof a distinct clump of nickel-rich material at high velocities. Current models\nfor the collision of a SN shock with a binary companion cannot reproduce both\nthe timescale and luminosity of the early emission in SN2013ge. Finally, the\nspectra of the first component of SN2013ge are similar to those of the\nrapidly-declining SN2002bj.\n", "  Classical hydrodynamic models predict that infinite work is required to move\na three-phase contact line, defined here as the line where a liquid/vapor\ninterface intersects a solid surface. Assuming a slip boundary condition, in\nwhich the liquid slides against the solid, such an unphysical prediction is\navoided. In this article, we present the results of experiments in which a\ncontact line moves and where slip is a dominating and controllable factor.\nSpherical cap shaped polystyrene microdroplets, with non-equilibrium contact\nangle, are placed on solid self-assembled monolayer coatings from which they\ndewet. The relaxation is monitored using \\textit{in situ} atomic force\nmicroscopy. We find that slip has a strong influence on the droplet evolutions,\nboth on the transient non-spherical shapes and contact line dynamics. The\nobservations are in agreement with scaling analysis and boundary element\nnumerical integration of the governing Stokes equations, including a Navier\nslip boundary condition.\n", "  We show that the polynomial decay rate of the heat semigroup of the Dirichlet\nLaplacian in curved planar wedges equals the sum of the usual dimensional decay\nrate and a multiple of the reciprocal value of the opening angle. To prove the\nresult, we develop the method of self-similar variables for the associated heat\nequation and study the asymptotic behaviour of the transformed non-autonomous\nparabolic problem for large times. We also establish an improved Hardy\ninequality for the Dirichlet Laplacian in non-trivially curved wedges and state\na conjecture about an improved decay rate in this case.\n", "  We present results from multi-wavelength simultaneous X-ray and radio\nobservations of the black hole X-ray binary V404 Cyg in quiescence. Our\ncoverage with NuSTAR provides the very first opportunity to study the X-ray\nspectrum of V404 Cyg at energies above 10 keV. The unabsorbed broad-band\n(0.3--30 keV) quiescent luminosity of the source is 8.9$\\times$10$^{32}$ erg\ns$^{-1}$ for a distance of 2.4 kpc. The source shows clear variability on short\ntime scales (an hour to a couple of hours) in radio, soft X-ray and hard X-ray\nbands in the form of multiple flares. The broad-band X-ray spectra obtained\nfrom XMM-Newton and NuSTAR can be characterized with a power-law model having\nphoton index $\\Gamma$=2.12$\\pm$0.07 (90\\% confidence errors); however,\nresiduals at high energies indicate spectral curvature significant at a\n3$\\sigma$ confidence level with e-folding energy of the cutoff to be\n20$^{+20}_{-7}$ keV. Such curvature can be explained using synchrotron emission\nfrom the base of a jet outflow. Radio observations using the VLA reveal that\nthe spectral index evolves on very fast time-scales (as short as 10 min.),\nswitching between optically thick and thin synchrotron emission, possibly due\nto instabilities in the compact jet or stochastic instabilities in accretion\nrate. We explore different scenarios to explain this very fast variability.\n", "  We present a comprehensive analysis of strong-lensing, weak-lensing shear and\nmagnification data for a sample of 16 X-ray-regular and 4 high-magnification\ngalaxy clusters selected from the CLASH survey. Our analysis combines\nconstraints from 16-band HST observations and wide-field multi-color imaging\ntaken primarily with Subaru/Suprime-Cam. We reconstruct surface mass density\nprofiles of individual clusters from a joint analysis of the full lensing\nconstraints, and determine masses and concentrations for all clusters. We find\ninternal consistency of the ensemble mass calibration to be $\\le 5\\% \\pm 6\\%$\nby comparison with the CLASH weak-lensing-only measurements of Umetsu et al.\nFor the X-ray-selected subsample, we examine the concentration-mass relation\nand its intrinsic scatter using a Bayesian regression approach. Our model\nyields a mean concentration of $c|_{z=0.34} = 3.95 \\pm 0.35$ at $M_{200c}\n\\simeq 14\\times 10^{14}M_\\odot$ and an intrinsic scatter of $\\sigma(\\ln\nc_{200c}) = 0.13 \\pm 0.06$, in excellent agreement with LCDM predictions when\nthe CLASH selection function based on X-ray morphological regularity and the\nprojection effects are taken into account. We also derive an ensemble-averaged\nsurface mass density profile for the X-ray-selected subsample by stacking their\nindividual profiles. The stacked mass profile is well described by a family of\ndensity profiles predicted for cuspy dark-matter-dominated halos, namely, the\nNFW, Einasto, and DARKexp models, whereas the single power-law, cored\nisothermal and Burkert density profiles are disfavored by the data. We show\nthat cuspy halo models that include the two-halo term provide improved\nagreement with the data. For the NFW halo model, we measure a mean\nconcentration of $c_{200c} = 3.79^{+0.30}_{-0.28}$ at $M_{200c} =\n14.1^{+1.0}_{-1.0}\\times 10^{14}M_\\odot$, demonstrating consistency between\ncomplementary analysis methods.\n", "  We disclose the origin of anisotropic percolation perimeters in terms of the\nStochastic Loewner Evolution (SLE) process. Precisely, our results from\nextensive numerical simulations indicate that the perimeters of multi-layered\nand directed percolation clusters at criticality are the scaling limits of the\nLoewner evolution of an anomalous Brownian motion, being subdiffusive and\nsuperdiffusive, respectively. The connection between anomalous diffusion and\nfractal anisotropy is further tested by using long-range power-law correlated\ntime series (fractional Brownian motion) as driving functions in the evolution\nprocess. The fact that the resulting traces are distinctively anisotropic\ncorroborates our hypothesis. Under the conceptual framework of SLE, our study\ntherefore reveals new perspectives for mathematical and physical\ninterpretations of non-Markovian processes in terms of anisotropic paths at\ncriticality and vice-versa.\n", "  We demonstrate computerized tomography (CT) reconstructions from absorption,\nphase and dark-field signals obtained from scans acquired when the x-ray probe\nlight is modulated with speckle. Two different interlaced schemes are proposed\nto reduce the number of sample exposures. First, the already demonstrated x-ray\nspeckle-vector tracking (XSVT) concept for projection imaging allows the three\nsignal CT reconstructions from multiple images per projection. Second, a\nmodified XSVT approach is shown to provide absorption and phase\nreconstructions, this time from a single image per angular projection.\nReconstructions from data obtained at a synchrotron facility emphasize the\npotential of the approaches for the imaging of complex samples.\n", "  We report measurements of the time-dependent phases of the leak and retrieved\npulses obtained in EIT storage experiments with metastable helium vapor at room\ntemperature. In particular, we investigate the influence of the optical\ndetuning at two-photon resonance, and provide numerical simulations of the full\ndynamical Maxwell-Bloch equations, which allow us to account for the\nexperimental results.\n", "  This work investigates the migration of spherical particles of different\nsizes in a centrifuge-driven deterministic lateral displacement (c-DLD) device.\nSpecifically, we use a scaled-up model to study the motion of suspended\nparticles through a square array of cylindrical posts under the action of\ncentrifugation. Experiments show that separation of particles by size is\npossible depending on the orientation of the driving acceleration with respect\nto the array of posts (forcing angle). We focus on the fractionation of binary\nsuspensions and measure the separation resolution at the outlet of the device\nfor different forcing angles. We found excellent resolution at intermediate\nforcing angles, when large particles are locked to move at small migration\nangles but smaller particles follow the forcing angle more closely. Finally, we\nshow that reducing the initial concentration (number) of particles, approaching\nthe dilute limit of single particles, leads to increased resolution in the\nseparation.\n", "  Nonlinear variants of quantum mechanics can solve tasks that are impossible\nin standard quantum theory, such as perfectly distinguishing nonorthogonal\nstates. Here we derive the optimal protocol for distinguishing two states of a\nqubit using the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, a model of nonlinear quantum\nmechanics that arises as an effective description of Bose-Einstein condensates.\nUsing this protocol, we present an algorithm for unstructured search in the\nGross-Pitaevskii model, obtaining an exponential improvement over a previous\nalgorithm of Meyer and Wong. This result establishes a limitation on the\neffectiveness of the Gross-Pitaevskii approximation. More generally, we\ndemonstrate similar behavior under a family of related nonlinearities, giving\nevidence that the ability to quickly discriminate nonorthogonal states and\nthereby solve unstructured search is a generic feature of nonlinear quantum\nmechanics.\n", "  Quantum computers are able to outperform classical algorithms. This was long\nrecognized by the visionary Richard Feynman who pointed out in the 1980s that\nquantum mechanical problems were better solved with quantum machines. It was\nonly in 1994 that Peter Shor came up with an algorithm that is able to\ncalculate the prime factors of a large number vastly more efficiently than\nknown possible with a classical computer. This paradigmatic algorithm\nstimulated the flourishing research in quantum information processing and the\nquest for an actual implementation of a quantum computer. Over the last fifteen\nyears, using skillful optimizations, several instances of a Shor algorithm have\nbeen implemented on various platforms and clearly proved the feasibility of\nquantum factoring. For general scalability, though, a different approach has to\nbe pursued. Here, we report the realization of a fully scalable Shor algorithm\nas proposed by Kitaev. For this, we demonstrate factoring the number fifteen by\neffectively employing and controlling seven qubits and four \"cache-qubits\",\ntogether with the implementation of generalized arithmetic operations, known as\nmodular multipliers. The scalable algorithm has been realized with an ion-trap\nquantum computer exhibiting success probabilities in excess of 90%.\n", "  Fourier transforms are ubiquitous mathematical tools in basic and applied\nsciences. We here report classical and quantum optical realizations of the\ndiscrete fractional Fourier transform, a generalization of the Fourier\ntransform. In the integrated configuration used in our experiments, the order\nof the transform is mapped onto the longitudinal coordinate, thus opening up\nthe prospect of simultaneously observing all Transformation orders. In the\ncontext of classical optics, we implement discrete fractional Fourier\ntransforms, both integer and fractional, of exemplary wave functions and\nexperimentally demonstrate the shift theorem. Moreover, we apply this approach\nin the quantum realm to transform separable and highly entangled biphoton wave\nfunctions. The proposed approach is versatile and could find applications in\nvarious fields where Fourier transforms are essential tools, such as quantum\nchemistry and biology, physics and mathematics.\n", "  Fluctuation and dissipation are by-products of coupling to the `environment.'\nThe Caldeira-Leggett model, a successful paradigm of quantum Brownian motion,\nviews the environment as a collection of harmonic oscillators linearly coupled\nto the system. However, symmetry considerations may forbid a linear coupling,\ne.g. for a neutral particle in quantum electrodynamics. We argue that nonlinear\ncouplings can lead to a fundamentally different behavior. Specifically, we\nconsider a heavy particle quadratically coupled to quantum fluctuations of the\nbath. In one dimension the particle undergoes anomalous diffusion, unfolding as\na power-law distribution in space, reminiscent of L\\'evy flights. We suggest\ncondensed matter analogs where similar effects may arise.\n", "  We apply the framework of tempered fractional calculus to investigate the\nspatial dispersion of elastic waves in a one-dimensional elastic bar\ncharacterized by range-dependent nonlocal interactions. The measure of the\ninteraction is given by the attenuation kernel present in the constitutive\nstress-strain relation of the bar, which follows from the Kr\\\"oner-Eringen's\nmodel of nonlocal elasticity. We employ a fractional power-law attenuation\nkernel and spatially temper it, to make the model physically valid and\nmathematically consistent. The spatial dispersion relation is derived, but it\nturns out to be difficult to solve, both analytically and numerically.\nConsequently, we use numerical techniques to extract the real and imaginary\nparts of the complex wavenumber for a wide range of frequency values. From the\ndispersion plots, it is found that the phase velocity dispersion of elastic\nwaves in the tempered nonlocal elastic bar is similar to that from the\ntime-fractional Zener model. Further, we also examine the unusual attenuation\npattern obtained for the elastic wave propagation in the bar.\n", "  Long-range quantum lattice systems often exhibit drastically different\nbehavior than their short-range counterparts. In particular, because they do\nnot satisfy the conditions for the Lieb-Robinson theorem, they need not have an\nemergent relativistic structure in the form of a light cone. Adopting a\nfield-theoretic approach, we study the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising\nmodel with long-range interactions, and a fermionic model with long-range\nhopping and pairing terms, explore their critical and near-critical behavior,\nand characterize their response to local perturbations. We deduce the dynamic\ncritical exponent, up to the two-loop order within the renormalization group\ntheory, which we then use to characterize the emergent causal behavior. We show\nthat beyond a critical value of the power-law exponent of the long-range\ncouplings, the dynamics effectively becomes relativistic. Various other\ncritical exponents describing correlations in the ground state, as well as\ndeviations from a linear causal cone, are deduced for a wide range of the\npower-law exponent.\n", "  We report the discovery of a substantial stellar overdensity in the periphery\nof the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), found using public imaging from the first\nyear of the Dark Energy Survey. The structure appears to emanate from the edge\nof the outer LMC disk at a radius $\\approx 13.5$ degrees due north of its\ncentre, and stretches more than $10$ kpc towards the east. It is roughly $1.5$\nkpc wide and has an integrated $V$-band luminosity of at least $M_V = -7.4$.\nThe stellar populations in the feature are indistinguishable from those in the\nouter LMC disk. We attempt to quantify the geometry of the outer disk using\nsimple planar models, and find that only a disk with mild intrinsic ellipticity\ncan simultaneously explain the observed stellar density on the sky and the\nazimuthal line-of-sight distance profile. We also see possible non-planar\nbehaviour in the outer disk that may reflect a warp and/or flare, as well as\ndeviations that resemble a ring-like structure between $\\sim9-12$ degrees from\nthe LMC centre. Based on all these observations, we conclude that our remote,\nstream-like feature is likely comprised of material that has been stripped from\nthe outskirts of the LMC disk, although we cannot rule out that it represents a\ntransient overdensity in the disk itself. We conduct a simple $N$-body\nsimulation to show that either type of structure could plausibly arise due to\nthe tidal force of the Milky Way; however we also recognize that a recent close\ninteraction between the LMC and the SMC may be the source of the stripping or\nperturbation. Finally, we observe evidence for extremely diffuse LMC\npopulations extending to radii of $\\sim 18.5$ kpc in the disk plane ($\\approx\n20$ degrees on the sky), corroborating previous spectroscopic detections at\ncomparable distances.\n", "  Lakshtanov et al. (2007) showed that incorporation of aluminum and some water\ninto SiO2 significantly reduces the post-stishovite transition pressure in\nSiO2. This discovery suggested that the ferroelastic post-stishovite transition\nin subducted MORB crust could be the source of reflectors/scatterers with low\nshear velocities observed in the mid to upper lower mantle. A few years later,\na similar effect was observed in anhydrous Al-bearing silica. In this paper, we\nshow using first principles static calculations and molecular dynamics using\ninter-atomic potentials that hydrogen bonds and hydrogen mobility play a\ncrucial role in lowering the post-stishovite transition pressure. A cooperative\nredistribution of hydrogen atoms is the main mechanism responsible for the\ntransition pressure reduction in hydrous aluminous stishovite. The effect is\nenhanced by increasing hydrogen concentration. This perspective suggests a\npotential relationship between the depth of seismic scatterers and the water\ncontent in stishovite.\n", "  Stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) offers significant advantages for\ncoherent population transfer between un- or weakly-coupled states and has the\npotential of realizing efficient quantum gate, qubit entanglement, and quantum\ninformation transfer. Here we report on the realization of STIRAP in a\nsuperconducting phase qutrit - a ladder-type system in which the ground state\npopulation is coherently transferred to the second-excited state via the dark\nstate subspace. The result agrees well with the numerical simulation of the\nmaster equation, which further demonstrates that with the state-of-the-art\nsuperconducting qutrits the transfer efficiency readily exceeds $99\\%$ while\nkeeping the population in the first-excited state below $1\\%$. We show that\npopulation transfer via STIRAP is significantly more robust against variations\nof the experimental parameters compared to that via the conventional resonant\n$\\pi$ pulse method. Our work opens up a new venue for exploring STIRAP for\nquantum information processing using the superconducting artificial atoms.\n", "  High-energy neutrino astronomy will probe the working of the most violent\nphenomena in the Universe. The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND)\nproject consists of an array of $\\sim10^5$ radio antennas deployed over\n$\\sim$200000km$^2$ in a mountainous site. It aims at detecting high-energy\nneutrinos via the measurement of air showers induced by the decay in the\natmosphere of $\\tau$ leptons produced by the interaction of the cosmic\nneutrinos under the Earth surface. Our objective with GRAND is to reach a\nneutrino sensitivity of\n$3\\times10^{-11}E^{-2}$GeV$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$sr$^{-1}$ above $3\n\\times10^{16}$eV. This sensitivity ensures the detection of cosmogenic\nneutrinos in the most pessimistic source models, and about 100 events per year\nare expected for the standard models. GRAND would also probe the neutrino\nsignals produced at the potential sources of UHECRs.\n  We show how our preliminary design should enable us to reach our sensitivity\ngoals, and present the experimental characteristics. We assess the possibility\nto adapt GRAND to other astrophysical radio measurements. We discuss in this\ntoken the technological options for the detector and the steps to be taken to\nachieve the GRAND project.\n", "  Curvature squared terms, when added to the Einstein-Hilbert action and\ntreated non-perturbatively, generically result in the propagation of an extra\nmassive scalar state and an extra massive spin-2 ghost state. Using the\nStueckelberg trick, we study the high-energy limit in which the mass of the\nspin-2 state is taken to zero, with strong- coupling scales held fixed. The\nStueckelberg approach makes transparent the interplay between the ghost\ngraviton and the healthy graviton which allows the theory to evade the usual\nlambda-3 strong coupling scale of massive gravity and become renormalizable, at\nthe expense of stability.\n", "  The discovery of magnetic and compositional effects in the low temperature\nproperties of multi-component glasses has prompted the need to extend the\nstandard two-level systems (2LSs) tunneling model. A possible extension\n\\cite{Jug2004} assumes that a subset of tunneling quasi-particles is moving in\na three-welled potential (TWP) associated with the ubiquitous inhomogeneities\nof the disordered atomic structure of the glass. We show that within an\nalternative, cellular description of the intermediate-range atomic structure of\nglasses the tunneling TWP can be fully justified. We then review how the\nexperimentally discovered magnetic effects can be explained within the approach\nwhere only localized atomistic tunneling 2LSs and quasi-particles tunneling in\nTWPs are allowed. We discuss the origin of the magnetic effects in the heat\ncapacity, dielectric constant (real and imaginary parts), polarization echo and\nSQUID magnetization in several glassy systems. We conclude by commenting on a\nstrategy to reveal the mentioned tunneling states (2LSs and TWPs) by means of\natomistic computer simulations and discuss the microscopic nature of the\ntunneling states in the context of the potential energy landscape of\nglass-forming systems.\n", "  Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of ions (K$^+$, Na$^+$, Ca$^{2+}$ and\nCl$^-$) in aqueous solutions are investigated. Water is described using the\nSPC/E model. A stochastic coarse-grained description for ion behaviour is\npresented and parameterized using MD simulations. It is given as a system of\ncoupled stochastic and ordinary differential equations, describing the ion\nposition, velocity and acceleration. The stochastic coarse-grained model\nprovides an intermediate description between all-atom MD simulations and\nBrownian dynamics (BD) models. It is used to develop a multiscale method which\nuses all-atom MD simulations in parts of the computational domain and (less\ndetailed) BD simulations in the remainder of the domain.\n", "  We investigate the migration of low-mass planets ($5 M_{\\oplus}$ and $20\nM_{\\oplus}$) in accretion discs threaded with a magnetic field using 2D MHD\ncode in polar coordinates. We observed that, in the case of a strong azimuthal\nmagnetic field where the plasma parameter is $\\beta\\sim 1-2$, density waves at\nthe magnetic resonances exert a positive torque on the planet and may slow down\nor reverse its migration. However, when the magnetic field is weaker (i.e., the\nplasma parameter $\\beta$ is relatively large), then non-axisymmetric density\nwaves excited by the planet lead to growth of the radial component of the field\nand, subsequently, to development of the magneto-rotational instability, such\nthat the disc becomes turbulent. Migration in a turbulent disc is stochastic,\nand the migration direction may change as such. To understand migration in a\nturbulent disc, both the interaction between a planet and individual turbulent\ncells, as well as the interaction between a planet and ordered density waves,\nhave been investigated.\n", "  It is a fundamental challenge in quantum optics to deterministically generate\nindistinguishable single photons through non-deterministic nonlinear optical\nprocesses, due to the intrinsic coupling of single- and multi-photon generation\nprobabilities in these processes. Actively multiplexing photons generated in\nmany temporal modes can decouple these probabilities, but key issues are to\nminimize resource requirements to allow scalability, and to ensure\nindistinguishability of the generated photons. We demonstrate the multiplexing\nof photons from four temporal modes solely using fiber-integrated optics and\noff-the-shelf electronic circuits. We show a 100% enhancement to the single\nphoton output probability without introducing additional multi-photon noise.\nPhoton indistinguishability is confirmed by a four-fold Hong-Ou-Mandel quantum\ninterference with a 91% visibility. Our demonstration paves the way for\nscalable multiplexing of many non-deterministic photon sources to a single\nnear-deterministic source, which will be of benefit to future quantum photonic\ntechnologies.\n", "  An exciton gas on a lattice is analyzed in terms of a convergent hopping\nexpansion. For a given chemical potential our calculation provides a sufficient\ncondition for the hopping rate to obtain an exponential decay of the exciton\ncorrelation function. This result indicates the existence of a Mott phase in\nwhich strong fluctuations destroy the long range correlations in the exciton\ngas at any temperature, either by thermal or by quantum fluctuations.\n", "  A set of scalar operators are employed to generate explicit representations\nof both hierarchy states (e.g., the series of fillings 1/3, 2/5, 3/7, ... ) and\ntheir conjugates (fillings 1, 2/3, 3/5, ...) as non-interacting quasi-electrons\nfilling fine-structure sub-shells within the FLL. This yields, for planar and\nspherical geometries, a quasi-electron representation of the incompressible FLL\nstate of filling p/(2p +1) in a magnetic field of strength B that is\nalgebraically identical to the IQHE state of filling p in a magnetic field of\nstrength B/(2p+1). The construction provides a precise definition of the\nquasi-electron/composite fermion that differs in some respects from common\ndescriptions: they are eigenstates of L,Lz; they and the FLL subshells they\noccupy carry a third index I that is associated with breaking of scalar pairs;\nthey absorb in their internal wave functions one, not two, units of magnetic\nflux; and they share a common, simple structure as vector products of a spinor\ncreating an electron and one creating magnetic flux. We argue that these\nproperties are a consequence of the breaking of the degeneracy of\nnoninteracting electrons within the FLL by the scale-invariant Coulomb\npotential. We discuss the sense in which the wave function construction\nsupports basic ideas of both composite fermion and hierarchical descriptions of\nthe FQHE. We describe symmetries of the quasi-electrons at half filling, where\na deep Fermi sea of quasi-electrons forms, and the quasi-electrons take on\nMajorana and pseudo-Dirac characters. Finally, we show that the wave functions\ncan be viewed as fermionic excitations of the bosonic half-filled shell,\nproducing at half filling an operator that differs from but plays the same role\nas the Pfaffian.\n", "  We present a new perturbative expansion for pionless effective field theory\nwith Coulomb interactions in which at leading order the spin-singlet\nnucleon-nucleon channels are taken in the unitarity limit. Presenting results\nup to next-to-leading order for the Phillips line and the neutron-deuteron\ndoublet-channel phase shift, we find that a perturbative expansion in the\ninverse 1S0 scattering lengths converges rapidly. Using a new systematic\ntreatment of the proton-proton sector that isolates the divergence due to\none-photon exchange, we renormalize the corresponding contribution to the\n3H-3He binding energy splitting and demonstrate that the Coulomb force in\npionless EFT is a completely perturbative effect in the trinucleon bound-state\nregime. In our new expansion, the leading order is exactly isospin-symmetric.\nAt next-to-leading order, we include isospin breaking via the Coulomb force and\ntwo-body scattering lengths, and find for the energy splitting\n(E_B(3He)-E_B(3H))^NLO = (-0.86 +/- 0.17) MeV.\n", "  We demonstrate highly accurate recovery of weak gravitational lensing shear\nusing an implementation of the Bayesian Fourier Domain (BFD) method proposed by\nBernstein & Armstrong (2014, BA14), extended to correct for selection biases.\nThe BFD formalism is rigorously correct for Nyquist-sampled,\nbackground-limited, uncrowded image of background galaxies. BFD does not assign\nshapes to galaxies, instead compressing the pixel data D into a vector of\nmoments M, such that we have an analytic expression for the probability P(M|g)\nof obtaining the observations with gravitational lensing distortion g along the\nline of sight. We implement an algorithm for conducting BFD's integrations over\nthe population of unlensed source galaxies which measures ~10\ngalaxies/second/core with good scaling properties. Initial tests of this code\non ~10^9 simulated lensed galaxy images recover the simulated shear to a\nfractional accuracy of m=0.0021+-0.0004, substantially more accurate than has\nbeen demonstrated previously for any generally applicable method. Deep sky\nexposures generate a sufficiently accurate approximation to the noiseless,\nunlensed galaxy population distribution assumed as input to BFD. Potential\nextensions of the method include simultaneous measurement of magnification and\nshear; multiple-exposure, multi-band observations; and joint inference of\nphotometric redshifts and lensing tomography.\n", "  Properties of stars undergoing pulsation such as the well known\nroot-mean-density scaling relation can be useful when trying to match the\nobserved properties of a particular star. It is often assumed that this\nrelation is valid for p mode frequencies in rotating stars. To examine the\nchange in frequency with rotation and mass, we have studied oscillation\nfrequencies of two-dimensional uniformly rotating zero-age main sequence\nstellar models in the delta Scuti mass range. We identified 370 p and g\naxisymetric modes for non-rotating models and then traced the changes in their\nfrequencies as the rotational velocity was increased. For each mass we\nconsidered a rotation sequence of ten models, with the largest rotation rate\nbeing about 200 km s$^{-1}$. We constrained the models to have the same surface\nshape, which can be characterized for uniform rotation by the ratio between the\npolar and the equatorial radii. We find that scaling relationships exist among\nthe oscillation frequencies of the same mode for different masses when the\nmodels have the same shape. For p modes, this scaling closely follows the\nperiod root-mean-density relation found in spherical stars. The g modes also\nscale between models of the same shape, with the scaling reflecting the change\nin properties outside the convective core as the stellar mass increases. These\nscaling relationships can be particularly useful in finding specific stellar\nmodels to match the oscillation frequencies of individual stars.\n", "  A canonical result about satisfiability theory is that the 2-SAT problem can\nbe solved in linear time, despite the NP-hardness of the 3-SAT problem. In the\nquantum 2-SAT problem, we are given a family of 2-qubit projectors $\\Pi_{ij}$\non a system of $n$ qubits, and the task is to decide whether the Hamiltonian\n$H=\\sum \\Pi_{ij}$ has a 0-eigenvalue, or it is larger than $1/n^\\alpha$ for\nsome $\\alpha=O(1)$. The problem is not only a natural extension of the\nclassical 2-SAT problem to the quantum case, but is also equivalent to the\nproblem of finding the ground state of 2-local frustration-free Hamiltonians of\nspin $\\frac{1}{2}$, a well-studied model believed to capture certain key\nproperties in modern condensed matter physics. While Bravyi has shown that the\nquantum 2-SAT problem has a classical polynomial-time algorithm, the running\ntime of his algorithm is $O(n^4)$. In this paper we give a classical algorithm\nwith linear running time in the number of local projectors, therefore achieving\nthe best possible complexity.\n", "  We have examined the effect of slow growth of a central black hole on\nspherical galaxies that obey S\\'ersic or $R^{1/m}$ surface-brightness profiles.\nDuring such growth the actions of each stellar orbit are conserved, which\nallows us to compute the final distribution function if we assume that the\ninitial distribution function is isotropic. We find that black-hole growth\nleads to a central cusp or ``excess light', in which the surface brightness\nvaries with radius as $R^{-1.3}$ (with a weak dependence on S\\'ersic index\n$m$), the line-of-sight velocity dispersion varies as $R^{-1/2}$, and the\nvelocity anisotropy is $\\beta\\simeq -0.24$ to $-0.28$ depending on $m$. The\nexcess stellar mass in the cusp scales approximately linearly with the\nblack-hole mass, and is typically 0.5--0.85 times the black-hole mass. This\nprocess may strongly influence the structure of nuclear star clusters if they\ncontain black holes.\n", "  Observation of coronal EUV spectral lines sensitive to different temperatures\noffers an opportunity to evaluate the thermal structure and flows in flaring\natmospheres. This can be used to estimate the partitioning between the thermal\nand kinetic energies. Our aim is to model large-scale (50-10000km) velocity\ndistributions in order to interpret non-thermal broadening of different\nspectral EUV lines. The developed models allow us to understand the origin of\nthe observed spectral line shifts and broadening, and link these features to\nparticular physical effects in flaring atmospheres. We use ideal MHD to derive\ntwisted magnetic fluxtube configurations in a stratified atmosphere. The\nevolution of these fluxtubes is followed using resistive MHD, with anomalous\nresistivity depending on the local density and temperature. The model also\ntakes into account the thermal conduction and radiative losses. The model\nallows us to evaluate average velocities and velocity dispersions, which would\nbe interpreted as `non-thermal' velocities in observations, at different\ntemperatures for different parts of the models. Our models show qualitative and\nquantitative agreement with observations. The line-of-sight (LOS) velocity\ndispersions demonstrate substantial correlation with the temperature,\nincreasing from about 20-30 km/s around 1 MK to about 200-400 km/s near 10-20\nMK. The average LOS velocities also correlate with velocity dispersions,\nalthough they demonstrate a very strong scattering, compared to observations.\nWe also note that near foot-points the velocity dispersions across the magnetic\nfield are systematically lower than those along the field. We conclude, that\nthe correlation between the flow velocities, velocity dispersions and\ntemperatures are likely to indicate that the same heating mechanism is\nresponsible for heating the plasma, its turbulisation and\nexpansion/evaporation.\n", "  We present a method to simultaneously model the dust far-infrared spectral\nenergy distribution (SED) and the total infrared $-$ carbon monoxide (CO)\nintegrated intensity $(S_{\\rm IR}-I_{\\rm CO})$ relationship. The modelling\nemploys a hierarchical Bayesian (HB) technique to estimate the dust surface\ndensity, temperature ($T_{\\rm eff}$), and spectral index at each pixel from the\nobserved far-infrared (FIR) maps. Additionally, given the corresponding CO map,\nthe method simultaneously estimates the slope and intercept between the FIR and\nCO intensities, which are global properties of the observed source. The model\naccounts for correlated and uncorrelated uncertainties, such as those present\nin Herschel observations. Using synthetic datasets, we demonstrate the accuracy\nof the HB method, and contrast the results with common non-hierarchical fitting\nmethods. As an initial application, we model the dust and gas on 100 pc scales\nin the Magellanic Clouds from Herschel FIR and NANTEN CO observations. The\nslopes of the $\\log S_{\\rm IR}-\\log I_{\\rm CO}$ relationship are similar in\nboth galaxies, falling in the range 1.1$-$1.7. However, in the SMC the\nintercept is nearly 3 times higher, which can be explained by its lower\nmetallicity than the LMC, resulting in a larger $S_{\\rm IR}$ per unit $I_{\\rm\nCO}$. The HB modelling evidences an increase in $T_{\\rm eff}$ in regions with\nthe highest $I_{\\rm CO}$ in the LMC. This may be due to enhanced dust heating\nin the densest molecular regions from young stars. Such simultaneous dust and\ngas modelling may reveal variations in the properties of the ISM and its\nassociation with other galactic characteristics, such as star formation rates\nand/or metallicities.\n", "  Gravitational-wave data is gauge dependent. While we can restrict the class\nof gauges in which such data may be expressed, there will still be an\ninfinite-dimensional group of transformations allowed while remaining in this\nclass, and almost as many different---though physically equivalent---waveforms\nas there are transformations. This paper presents a method for calculating the\neffects of the most important transformation group, the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs\n(BMS) group, consisting of rotations, boosts, and supertranslations (which\ninclude time and space translations as special cases). To a reasonable\napproximation, these transformations result in simple coupling between the\nmodes in a spin-weighted spherical-harmonic decomposition of the waveform. It\nis shown that waveforms from simulated compact binaries in the publicly\navailable SXS waveform catalog contain unmodeled effects due to displacement\nand drift of the center of mass, accounting for mode-mixing at typical levels\nof 1%. However, these effects can be mitigated by measuring the average motion\nof the system's center of mass for a portion of the inspiral, and applying the\nopposite transformation to the waveform data. More generally, controlling the\nBMS transformations will be necessary to eliminate the gauge ambiguity inherent\nin gravitational-wave data for both numerical and analytical waveforms.\nOpen-source code implementing BMS transformations of waveforms is included\nalong with this paper in the supplemental materials.\n", "  We model repetitive quantum error correction (QEC) with the\nsingle-error-correcting five-qubit code on a network of individually-controlled\nqubits with always-on Ising couplings, using our previously designed universal\nset of quantum gates based on sequences of shaped decoupling pulses. In\naddition to serving as accurate quantum gates, the sequences also provide\ndynamical decoupling (DD) of low-frequency phase noise. The simulation involves\nintegrating unitary dynamics of six qubits over the duration of tens of\nthousands of control pulses, using classical stochastic phase noise as a source\nof decoherence. The combined DD/QEC protocol dramatically improves the\ncoherence, with the QEC alone responsible for more than an order of magnitude\ninfidelity reduction.\n", "  Majorana fermions were originally proposed as elementary particles acting as\ntheir own antiparticles. In recent years, it has become clear that Majorana\nfermions can instead be realized in condensed-matter systems as emergent\nquasiparticles, a situation often accompanied by topological order. Here we\npropose a physical system which realizes Landau levels - highly degenerate\nsingle-particle states usually resulting from an orbital magnetic field acting\non charged particles - for Majorana fermions. This is achieved in a variant of\na quantum spin system due to Kitaev which is distorted by triaxial strain. This\nstrained Kitaev model displays a spin-liquid phase with charge-neutral\nMajorana-fermion excitations whose spectrum corresponds to that of Landau\nlevels, here arising from a tailored pseudo-magnetic field. We show that\nmeasuring the dynamic spin susceptibility reveals the Landau-level structure by\na remarkable mechanism of probe-induced bound-state formation.\n", "  Characterization of transiting planets with transit timing variations (TTVs)\nrequires understanding how to translate the observed TTVs into masses and\norbital elements of the planets. This can be challenging in multi-planet\ntransiting systems, but fortunately these systems tend to be nearly\nplane-parallel and low eccentricity. Here we present a novel derivation of\nanalytic formulae for TTVs that are accurate to first order in the planet-star\nmass ratios and in the orbital eccentricities. These formulae are accurate in\nproximity to first order resonances, as well as away from resonance, and\ncompare well with more computationally expensive N-body integrations in the low\neccentricity, low mass-ratio regime when applied to simulated and to actual\nmulti-transiting Kepler planet systems. We make code available for implementing\nthese formulae.\n", "  We present extensive optical ($UBVRI$, $g'r'i'z'$, and open CCD) and\nnear-infrared ($ZYJH$) photometry for the very nearby Type IIP SN ~2013ej\nextending from +1 to +461 days after shock breakout, estimated to be MJD\n$56496.9\\pm0.3$. Substantial time series ultraviolet and optical spectroscopy\nobtained from +8 to +135 days are also presented. Considering well-observed SNe\nIIP from the literature, we derive $UBVRIJHK$ bolometric calibrations from\n$UBVRI$ and unfiltered measurements that potentially reach 2\\% precision with a\n$B-V$ color-dependent correction. We observe moderately strong Si II\n$\\lambda6355$ as early as +8 days. The photospheric velocity ($v_{\\rm ph}$) is\ndetermined by modeling the spectra in the vicinity of Fe II $\\lambda5169$\nwhenever observed, and interpolating at photometric epochs based on a\nsemianalytic method. This gives $v_{\\rm ph} = 4500\\pm500$ km s$^{-1}$ at +50\ndays. We also observe spectral homogeneity of ultraviolet spectra at +10--12\ndays for SNe IIP, while variations are evident a week after explosion. Using\nthe expanding photosphere method, from combined analysis of SN 2013ej and SN\n2002ap, we estimate the distance to the host galaxy to be $9.0_{-0.6}^{+0.4}$\nMpc, consistent with distance estimates from other methods. Photometric and\nspectroscopic analysis during the plateau phase, which we estimated to be\n$94\\pm7$ days long, yields an explosion energy of $0.9\\pm0.3\\times10^{51}$\nergs, a final pre-explosion progenitor mass of $15.2\\pm4.2$~M$_\\odot$ and a\nradius of $250\\pm70$~R$_\\odot$. We observe a broken exponential profile beyond\n+120 days, with a break point at +$183\\pm16$ days. Measurements beyond this\nbreak time yield a $^{56}$Ni mass of $0.013\\pm0.001$~M$_\\odot$.\n", "  We provide evidence of the detection of a new non-Gaussian anomaly in the\ncosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation which has larger statistical\nsignificance than the Cold Spot (CS) anomaly and comparable size. This\ntemperature anomaly is aligned with a huge large quasar group (HLQG), and for\nthis reason we call it HLQG anomaly. There are different physical phenomena by\nwhich the HLQG could have produced the observed temperature anomaly, such as\nfor example the Sunyaev Zeldovich (SZ), the integrated Sachs Wolfe (ISW) or the\nRees Sciama (RS) effect. The goal of this paper it is not to explain the\nobserved alignment in terms of these effects, but to show the shape and\nposition of the HLQG anomaly, and estimate its statistical significance, i.e.\nthe probability that it could be just the result of primordial Gaussian\nfluctuations. We analyze the CMB Planck satellite temperature map of the region\nof sky corresponding to the angular position of the HLQG, and compute an inner\nand an outer temperature by averaging the CMB map over respectively the region\nsubtended by the HLQG on the sky, and over a region surrounding it. It turns\nout that the inner region is warmer than the outer one, with a measured\ntemperature difference of $\\Delta T^{obs} \\approx 43\\mu K$. The temperature\nexcess is then compared with the results of Montecarlo simulations of random\nGaussian realizations of the CMB map, indicating with at least a $2.3\\sigma$\nconfidence level, that the measured $\\Delta T^{obs}$ cannot be attributed to\nprimordial Gaussian fluctuations. Its alignment with HLQG and suggests that\nthis could be due to the Rees-Sciama effect. Our results are stable under the\nchoice of different simulations methods and different definitions of the inner\nand outer regions.\n", "  We consider the step Riemann problem for the system of equations describing\nthe propagation of a coherent light beam in nematic liquid crystals, which is a\ngeneral system describing nonlinear wave propagation in a number of different\nphysical applications. While the equation governing the light beam is of\ndefocusing nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation type, the dispersive shock wave\n(DSW) generated from this initial condition has major differences from the\nstandard DSW solution of the defocusing nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation. In\nparticular, it is found that the DSW has positive polarity and generates\nresonant radiation which propagates ahead of it. Remarkably, the velocity of\nthe lead soliton of the DSW is determined by the classical shock velocity. The\nsolution for the radiative wavetrain is obtained using the WKB approximation.\nIt is shown that for sufficiently small initial jumps the nematic DSW is\nasymptotically governed by a Korteweg-de Vries equation with fifth order\ndispersion, which explicitly shows the resonance generating the radiation ahead\nof the DSW. The constructed asymptotic theory is shown to be in good agreement\nwith the results of direct numerical simulations.\n", "  We present a new analysis of Kerr-Newman-deSitter black holes in terms of\nthermodynamic quantities that are defined in the observable portion of the\nuniverse; between the black hole and cosmological horizons. In particular, we\nreplace the mass $m$ with a new 'area product' parameter $X$. The physical\nregion of parameter space is found analytically and thermodynamic quantities\nare given by simple algebraic functions of these parameters. We find that\ndifferent geometrical properties of the black holes are usefully distinguished\nby the sum of the black hole and cosmological entropies. The physical parameter\nspace breaks into a region in which the total entropy, together with $\\Lambda$,\n$a$ and $q$ uniquely specifies the black hole, and a region in which there is a\ntwo-fold degeneracy. In this latter region, there are isentropic pairs of black\nholes, having the same $\\Lambda$, $a$, and $q$, but different $X$. The\nthermodynamic volumes and masses differ in such that there are high and low\ndensity branches. The partner spacetimes are related by a simple inversion of\n$X$, which has a fixed point at the state of maximal total entropy. We compute\nthe compressibility at fixed total entropy and find that it diverges at the\nmaximal entropy point. Hence a picture emerges of high and low density phases\nmerging at this critical point.\n", "  Controlling the dissociation of single water molecule on an insulating\nsurface plays a crucial role in many catalytic reactions. In this Letter, we\nhave identified the enhanced chemical reactivity of ultrathin MgO(100) films\ndeposited on Mo(100) substrate that causes water dissociation. We reveal that\nthe ability to split water on insulating surface closely depends on the lattice\nmismatch between ultrathin films and the underlying substrate, and\nsubstrate-induced in-plane tensile strain dramatically results in water\ndissociation on MgO(100). Three dissociative adsorption configurations of water\nwith lower energy are predicted, and the structural transition going from\nmolecular form to dissociative form is almost barrierless. Our results provide\nan effective avenue to achieve water dissociation at the single-molecule level\nand shed light on how to tune the chemical reactions of insulating surfaces by\nchoosing the suitable substrates.\n", "  Two-particle two-hole (2p2h) effect on the Gamow-Teller (GT) transition for\nneutron-rich nuclei is studied by the second Tamm-Dancoff approximation (STDA)\nwith the Skyrme interaction. Unstable $^{24}$O and $^{34}$Si, and stable\n$^{48}$Ca nuclei are chosen to study the quenching and fragmentation of the GT\nstrengths. Correlation of the 2p2h configurations causes $20$\\% quenching and\ndownward shift of GT giant resonances (GTGRs). The residual interaction\nchanging relative angular momentum, appeared in the tensor force part, gives a\nmeaningful effect to the GT strength distributions. In this work, $17$ to $26$\n\\% of the total GT strengths are brought to high energy region above GTGRs. In\nparticular, the tensor force brings strengths to high energy more than $50$\nMeV. STDA calculation within a small model space for 2p2h configuration is also\nperformed and experimental data of $^{48}$Ca is reproduced reasonably.\n", "  Recent advances in soft-collinear effective theory with Glauber gluons have\nled to the development of a new method that gives a unified description of\ninclusive hadron production in reactions with nucleons and heavy nuclei. We\nshow how this approach, based on the generalization of the DGLAP evolution\nequations to include final-state medium-induced parton showers, can be combined\nwith initial-state effects for applications to jet quenching phenomenology. We\ndemonstrate that the traditional parton energy loss calculations can be\nregarded as a special soft-gluon emission limit of the general QCD evolution\nframework. We present phenomenological comparison of the SCET$_{\\rm G}$-based\nresults on the suppression of inclusive charged hadron and neutral pion\nproduction in $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$ TeV lead-lead collisions at the Large Hadron\nCollider to experimental data. We also show theoretical predictions for the\nupcoming $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} \\simeq 5.1$ TeV Pb+Pb run at the LHC.\n", "  Broad Fe K emission lines have been widely observed in the X-ray spectra of\nblack hole systems, and in neutron star systems as well. The intrinsically\nnarrow Fe K fluorescent line is generally believed to be part of the reflection\nspectrum originating in an illuminated accretion disk, and broadened by strong\nrelativistic effects. However, the nature of the lines in neutron star LMXBs\nhas been under debate. We therefore obtained the longest, high-resolution X-ray\nspectrum of a neutron star LMXB to date with a 300 ks Chandra HETGS observation\nof Serpens X-1. The observation was taken under the \"continuous clocking\" mode\nand thus free of photon pile-up effects. We carry out a systematic analysis and\nfind that the blurred reflection model fits the Fe line of Serpens X-1\nsignificantly better than a broad Gaussian component does, implying that the\nrelativistic reflection scenario is much preferred. Chandra HETGS also provides\nhighest spectral resolution view of the Fe K region and we find no strong\nevidence for additional narrow lines.\n", "  We investigate spontaneous four wave mixing (SFWM) in a single-channel\nside-coupled integrated spaced sequence of resonators (SCISSOR). Analytic\nexpressions for the number of photon pairs generated, as well as the biphoton\nwave function (joint spectral amplitude) describing the pairs, are derived and\nnumerically computed for different pump pulse durations and numbers of ring\nresonators. In the limit of a long input pump pulse, we show a strong analogy\nbetween super-linear scaling of generation efficiency with respect to the\nnumber of rings in the structure and Dicke superradiance. More generally, we\ndiscuss in detail the factors that influence the shape of the biphoton wave\nfunction, as well as the conditions for observing super-SFWM.\n", "  Strong lensing time-delay systems constrain cosmological parameters via the\nso-called time-delay distance and the angular diameter distance to the lens. In\nprevious studies, only the former information was used. In this paper, we show\nthat the cosmological constraints improve significantly when the latter\ninformation is also included. Specifically, the angular diameter distance plays\na crucial role in breaking the degeneracy between the curvature of the Universe\nand the time-varying equation of state of dark energy. Using a mock sample of\n55 bright quadruple lens systems based on expectations for ongoing/future\nimaging surveys, we find that adding the angular diameter distance information\nto the time-delay distance information and the cosmic microwave background data\nof Planck improves the constraint on the constant equation of state by 30%, on\nthe time variation in the equation of state by a factor of two, and on the\nHubble constant in the flat $\\Lambda$CDM model by a factor of two. Therefore,\nprevious forecasts for the statistical power of time-delay systems were\nsignificantly underestimated, i.e., time-delay systems are more powerful than\npreviously appreciated.\n", "  We propose a torsional response raised by lattice dislocation in Weyl\nsemimetals akin to chiral magnetic effect; i.e. a fictitious magnetic field\narising from screw or edge dislocation induces charge current. We demonstrate\nthat, in sharp contrast to the usual chiral magnetic effect which vanishes in\nreal solid state materials, the torsional chiral magnetic effect exists even\nfor realistic lattice models, which implies the experimental detection of the\neffect via SQUID or nonlocal resistivity measurements in Weyl semimetal\nmaterials.\n", "  We study the formation of Majorana states in quasi-1D and 2D square lattices\nwith open boundary conditions, with general anisotropic Rashba coupling, in the\npresence of an applied Zeeman field and in the proximity of a superconductor.\nFor systems in which the length of the system is very large (quasi-1D) we\ncalculate analytically the exact topological invariant, and we find a rich\nphase diagram which is strongly dependent on the width of the system. We\ncompare our results with previous results based on a few-band approximation. We\nalso investigate numerically open 2D systems of finite length in both\ndirections. We use the recently introduced generalized Majorana polarization,\nwhich can locally evaluate the Majorana character of a given state. We find\nthat the formation of Majoranas depends strongly on the geometry of the system\nand if the length and the width are comparable no Majorana states can form,\nhowever, one can show the formation of \"quasi-Majorana\" states that have a\nlocal Majorana character, but no global Majorana symmetry.\n", "  We find two relations between coherence and path-information in a multi-path\ninterferometer. The first builds on earlier results for the two-path\ninterferometer, which used minimum-error state discrimination between detector\nstates to provide the path information. For visibility, which was used in the\ntwo-path case, we substitute a recently defined $l_{1}$ measure of quantum\ncoherence. The second is an entropic relation in which the path information is\ncharacterized by the mutual information between the detector states and the\noutcome of the measurement performed on them, and the coherence measure is one\nbased on relative entropy.\n", "  We introduce a minimization formulation for the determination of a\nfinite-dimensional, time-dependent, orthonormal basis that captures directions\nof the phase space associated with transient instabilities. While these\ninstabilities have finite lifetime they can play a crucial role by either\naltering the system dynamics through the activation of other instabilities, or\nby creating sudden nonlinear energy transfers that lead to extreme responses.\nHowever, their essentially transient character makes their description a\nparticularly challenging task. We develop a minimization framework that focuses\non the optimal approximation of the system dynamics in the neighborhood of the\nsystem state. This minimization formulation results in differential equations\nthat evolve a time-dependent basis so that it optimally approximates the most\nunstable directions. We demonstrate the capability of the method for two\nfamilies of problems: i) linear systems including the advection-diffusion\noperator in a strongly non-normal regime as well as the Orr-Sommerfeld/Squire\noperator, and ii) nonlinear problems including a low-dimensional system with\ntransient instabilities and the vertical jet in crossflow. We demonstrate that\nthe time-dependent subspace captures the strongly transient non-normal energy\ngrowth (in the short time regime), while for longer times the modes capture the\nexpected asymptotic behavior.\n", "  $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ has been proposed recently as an excellent playground for\nexploring Kitaev physics on a two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb lattice. However,\nstructural clarification of the compound has not been completed, which is\ncrucial in understanding the physics of this system. Here, using {\\it\nab-initio} electronic structure calculations, we study a full three dimensional\n(3D) structure of $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ including the effects of spin-orbit\ncoupling (SOC) and electronic correlations. Three major results are as follows;\ni) SOC suppresses dimerization of Ru atoms, which exists in other Ru compounds\nsuch as isostructural Li$_2$RuO$_3$, and making the honeycomb closer to an\nideal one. ii) The nearest-neighbor Kitaev exchange interaction between the\n$j_{\\rm eff}$=1/2 pseudospin depends strongly on the Ru-Ru distance and the Cl\nposition, originating from the nature of the edge-sharing geometry. iii) The\noptimized 3D structure without electronic correlations has $P{\\bar 3}1m$ space\ngroup symmetry independent of SOC, but including electronic correlation changes\nthe optimized 3D structure to either $C2/m$ or $Cmc2_1$ within 0.1 meV per\nformula unit (f.u.) energy difference. The reported $P3_112$ structure is also\nclose in energy. The interlayer spin exchange coupling is a few percent of\nin-plane spin exchange terms, confirming $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ is close to a 2D\nsystem. We further suggest how to increase the Kitaev term via tensile strain,\nwhich sheds new light in realizing Kitaev spin liquid phase in this system.\n", "  Online communities are becoming increasingly important as platforms for\nlarge-scale human cooperation. These communities allow users seeking and\nsharing professional skills to solve problems collaboratively. To investigate\nhow users cooperate to complete a large number of knowledge-producing tasks, we\nanalyze StackExchange, one of the largest question and answer systems in the\nworld. We construct attention networks to model the growth of 110 communities\nin the StackExchange system and quantify individual answering strategies using\nthe linking dynamics of attention networks. We identify two types of users\ntaking different strategies. One strategy (type A) aims at performing\nmaintenance by doing simple tasks, while the other strategy (type B) aims\ninvesting time in doing challenging tasks. We find that the number of type A\nneeds to be twice as big as type B users for a sustainable growth of\ncommunities.\n", "  Gamma rays and microwave observations of the Galactic Center and surrounding\nareas indicate the presence of anomalous emission, whose origin remains\nambiguous. The possibility of dark matter (DM) annihilation explaining both\nsignals through prompt emission at gamma-rays and secondary emission at\nmicrowave frequencies from interactions of high-energy electrons produced in\nannihilation with the Galactic magnetic fields has attracted much interest in\nrecent years. We investigate the DM interpretation of the Galactic Center\ngamma-ray excess by searching for the associated synchrotron in the WMAP-Planck\ndata. Considering various magnetic field and cosmic-ray propagation models, we\npredict the synchrotron emission due to DM annihilation in our Galaxy, and\ncompare it with the WMAP-Planck data at 23-70GHz. In addition to standard\nmicrowave foregrounds, we separately model the microwave counterpart to the\nFermi Bubbles and the signal due to DM, and use component separation techniques\nto extract the signal associated with each template from the total emission. We\nconfirm the presence of the Haze at the level of 7% of the total sky intensity\nat 23GHz in our chosen region of interest, with a harder spectrum $I \\sim\n\\nu^{-0.8}$ than the synchrotron from regular cosmic-ray electrons. The data do\nnot show a strong preference towards fitting the Haze by either the Bubbles or\nDM emission only. Inclusion of both components provides a better fit with a DM\ncontribution to the Haze emission of 20% at 23GHz, however, due to significant\nuncertainties in foreground modeling, we do not consider this a clear detection\nof a DM signal. We set robust upper limits on the annihilation cross section by\nignoring foregrounds, and also report best-fit DM annihilation parameters\nobtained from a complete template analysis. We conclude that the WMAP-Planck\ndata are consistent with a DM interpretation of the gamma-ray excess.\n", "  Recent years have witnessed major advances in our understanding of\nnonequilibrium processes. The Jarzynski equality, for example, provides a link\nbetween equilibrium free energy differences and finite-time, nonequilibrium\ndynamics. We propose a generalization of this relation to non-Hamiltonian\ndynamics, relevant for active matter systems, continuous feedback, and computer\nsimulation. Surprisingly, this relation allows us to calculate the free energy\ndifference between the desired initial and final equilibrium states using\narbitrary dynamics. As a practical matter, this dissociation between the\ndynamics and the initial and final states promises to facilitate a range of\ntechniques for free energy estimation in a single, universal expression.\n", "  We study numerically the phase-ordering kinetics of the site-diluted and\nbond-diluted Ising models after a quench from an infinite to a low temperature.\nWe show that the speed of growth of the ordered domain's size is non-monotonous\nwith respect to the amount of dilution $D$: Starting from the pure case $D=0$\nthe system slows down when dilution is added, as it is usually expected when\ndisorder is introduced, but only up to a certain value $D^*$ beyond which the\nspeed of growth raises again. We interpret this counterintuitive fact in a\nrenormalization-group inspired framework, along the same lines proposed for the\ncorresponding two-dimensional systems, where a similar pattern was observed.\n", "  We present a scheme of positioning a single electron spin with sub-nanometer\nresolution through multiple nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond. With unwanted\nnoise suppressed by dynamical decoupling, the spin coherence of each center\ndevelops characteristic oscillations due to a single electron spin located\n$4{\\sim20}$ nm away from the centers. We can extract the position information\nfrom the characteristic electron spin-coherence oscillations of each center.\nThis scheme is useful for high-resolution nanoscale magnetometry and spin-based\nquantum computing.\n", "  A comprehensive account of a new structured algorithm for obtaining\nnonrelativistic diffeomorphism invariances in both space and spacetime by\ngauging the Galilean symmetry in a generic nonrelativistic field theoretical\nmodel is provided.\n  Various applications like the obtention of nonrelativistic diffeomorphism\ninvariance, the introduction of Chern-Simons term and its role in fractional\nquantum Hall effect, induction of diffeomorphism in irrotational fluid model,\nabstraction of Newton-Cartan geometry and the emergence of Horava-Lifshitz\ngravity are discussed in details.\n", "  Electron transport is conventionally determined by the momentum-relaxing\nscattering of electrons by the host solid and its excitations. The electrical\nresistance is set by geometrical factors and the resistivity, which is a\nmicroscopic property of the solid. Hydrodynamic fluid flow through channels, in\ncontrast, is determined by geometrical factors, boundary scattering and the\nviscosity of the fluid, which is governed by momentum-conserving internal\ncollisions. A long-standing question in the physics of solids, brought into\nfocus by the advent of new calculational techniques, has been whether the\nviscosity of the electron fluid plays an observable role in determining the\nresistance. At first sight this seems unlikely, because in almost all known\nmaterials the rate of momentum-relaxing collisions dominates that of the\nmomentum-conserving ones that give the viscous term. Here, we show this is not\nalways the case. We report experimental evidence that the resistance of\nrestricted channels of the ultra-pure two-dimensional metal PdCoO$_2$ has a\nlarge viscous contribution. Comparison with theory allows an estimate of the\nelectronic viscosity in the range between $6\\times 10^{-3}$~kg(ms)$^{-1}$ and\n$3\\times 10^{-4}$~kg(ms)$^{-1}$, which brackets that of water at room\ntemperature.\n", "  This paper is devoted to consideration of the theory of collisionless\nstatistical systems with interparticle scalar interaction. The mathematical\nmodel of such systems is constructed and the exact solution of Vlasov equation\nfor isotropic homogenous model of the Universe is found. Asymptotic solutions\nof self-consistent Vlasov - Einstein model for conformally invariant scalar\ninteractions are found.\n", "  In modern day simulations of many-body systems much of the computational\ncomplexity is shifted to the identification of slowly changing molecular order\nparameters called collective variables (CV) or reaction coordinates. A vast\narray of enhanced sampling methods are based on the identification and biasing\nof these low-dimensional order parameters, whose fluctuations are important in\ndriving rare events of interest. Here describe a new algorithm for finding\noptimal low-dimensional collective variables for use in enhanced sampling\nbiasing methods like umbrella sampling, metadynamics and related methods, when\nlimited prior static and dynamic information is known about the system, and a\nmuch larger set of candidate CVs is specified. The algorithm involves\nestimating the best combination of these candidate CVs, as quantified by a\nmaximum path entropy estimate of the spectral gap for dynamics viewed as a\nfunction of that CV. Through multiple practical examples, we show how this\npost-processing procedure can lead to optimization of CV and several orders of\nmagnitude improvement in the convergence of the free energy calculated through\nmetadynamics, essentially giving the ability to extract useful information even\nfrom unsuccessful metadynamics runs.\n", "  We report on the growth of stoichiometric Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ single crystals,\nwhich allow us to unveil their intrinsic magnetic properties. The effect of\ndifferent growth conditions has been investigated for crystals grown by the\nflux method. We find that the magnetic response depends very sensitively on the\ndetails of the growth conditions. We assess the defect concentration based on\nmagnetization, X-ray diffraction, Raman scattering, and optical conductivity\nmeasurements. We find that samples with a low concentration of electronically\nactive defects show much reduced in-gap spectral weight in the optical\nconductivity and a pronounced two-magnon peak in the Raman scattering spectrum.\nA prolonged exposure at high temperature during the growth leads to higher\ndefect concentration likely due to creation of oxygen vacancies. We further\ndemonstrate a systematic intergrowth of Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ and Sr$_3$Ir$_2$O$_7$\nphases by varying the growth temperature. Our results thus emphasize that\nrevealing the intrinsic magnetic properties of Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ and related\nmaterials requires a scrupulous control of the crystal growth process.\n", "  Cell motion inside dense tissues governs many biological processes, including\nembryonic development and cancer metastasis, and recent experiments suggest\nthat these tissues exhibit collective glassy behavior. To make quantitative\npredictions about glass transitions in tissues, we study a self-propelled\nVoronoi (SPV) model that simultaneously captures polarized cell motility and\nmulti-body cell-cell interactions in a confluent tissue, where there are no\ngaps between cells. We demonstrate that the model exhibits a jamming transition\nfrom a solid-like state to a fluid-like state that is controlled by three\nparameters: the single-cell motile speed, the persistence time of single-cell\ntracks, and a target shape index that characterizes the competition between\ncell-cell adhesion and cortical tension. In contrast to traditional particulate\nglasses, we are able to identify an experimentally accessible structural order\nparameter that specifies the entire jamming surface as a function of model\nparameters. We demonstrate that a continuum Soft Glassy Rheology model\nprecisely captures this transition in the limit of small persistence times, and\nexplain how it fails in the limit of large persistence times. These results\nprovide a framework for understanding the collective solid-to-liquid\ntransitions that have been observed in embryonic development and cancer\nprogression, which may be associated with Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal transition\nin these tissues.\n", "  We use \\textit{ab initio} calculations to estimate formation energies of\ncation (transition metal) antisite defects at oxide interfaces and to\nunderstand the basic physical effects that drive or suppress the formation of\nthese defects. Antisite defects are found to be favored in systems with\nsubstantial charge transfer across the interface, while Jahn-Teller distortions\nand itinerant ferromagnetism can prevent antisite defects and help stabilize\natomically sharp interfaces. Our results enable identification of classes of\nsystems that may be more and less susceptible to the formation of antisite\ndefects and motivate experimental studies and further theoretical calculations\nto elucidate the local structure and stability of oxide interface systems.\n", "  We study a ring geometry, coupled to two normal metallic leads, which has a\nMajorana bound state (MBS) embedded in one of its arm and is threaded by\nAharonov Bohm ($\\mathcal{A}\\mathcal{B}$) flux $\\phi$. We show that by varying\nthe $\\mathcal{AB}$ flux, the two leads go through resonance in an\nanti-correlated fashion while the resonance conductance is quantized to $2\ne^2/h$. We further show that such anti-correlation is completely absent when\nthe MBS is replaced by an Andreev bound state (ABS). Hence this\nanti-correlation in conductance when studied as a function of $\\phi$ provides a\nunique signature of the MBS which cannot be faked by an ABS. We contrast the\nphase sensitivity of the MBS and ABS in terms of tunneling conductances. We\nargue that the relative phase between the tunneling amplitude of the electrons\nand holes from either lead to the level (MBS or ABS), which is constrained to\n$0,\\pi$ for the MBS and unconstrained for the ABS, is responsible for this\ninteresting contrast in the $\\mathcal{AB}$ effect between the MBS and ABS.\n", "  Low cost methods of antenna production primarily aim to reduce the cost of\nmetalization. This might lead to a reduction in conductivity. A systematic\nstudy on the impact of conductivity is presented. The efficiency, gain and\nbandwidth of cylindrical wire meander line, dipole, and Yagi-Uda antennas were\ncompared for materials with conductivities in the range $\\mathrm{10^3}$ to\n$\\mathrm{10^9}$ S/m. In this range, the absorption efficiency of both the\ndipole and meander line changed little, however the conductivity significantly\nimpacts on radiation efficiency and the absorption cross section of the\nantennas. The extinction cross section of the dipole and meander line antennas\n(antennas that Thevenin equivalent circuit is applicable) also vary with\nradiation efficiency. From the point of radiation efficiency, the dipole\nantenna performance is most robust under decreasing conductivity. Antennas\nstudied in this study were fabricated with brass and graphite. Radiation\nefficiency of the antennas were measured by improved Wheeler cap (IWC) method.\nMeasurement results showed a reasonable agreement with simulations. We also\nmeasured the extinction cross section of the six fabricated prototypes.\n", "  In this work it is shown that the use of a hydrodynamical model of heavy ion\ncollisions which incorporates recent developments, together with updated photon\nemission rates greatly improves agreement with both ALICE and PHENIX\nmeasurements of direct photons, supporting the idea that thermal photons are\nthe dominant source of direct photon momentum anisotropy. The event-by-event\nhydrodynamical model uses IP-Glasma initial states and includes, for the first\ntime, both shear and bulk viscosities, along with second order couplings\nbetween the two viscosities. The effect of both shear and bulk viscosities on\nthe photon rates is studied, and those transport coefficients are shown to have\nmeasurable consequences on the photon momentum anisotropy.\n", "  Extremely large opaque troughs in the Lyman-alpha forest have been\ninterpreted as a sign of an extended reionization process below z~6. Such\nfeatures are impossible to reproduce with simple models of the intergalactic\nionizing background that assume a uniform mean free path of ionizing photons.\nWe build a self-consistent model of the ionizing background that includes\nfluctuations in the mean free path due to the varying strength of the ionizing\nbackground and large-scale density field. The dominant effect is the\nsuppression of the ionizing background in large-scale voids due to\n\"self-shielding\" by an enhanced number of optically thick absorbers. Our model\nresults in a distribution of 50 Mpc/h Lyman-alpha forest effective optical\ndepths that significantly improves agreement with the observations at z~5.6.\nExtrapolation to z~5.4 and z~5.8 appears promising, but matching the mean\nbackground evolution requires evolution in the absorber population beyond the\nscope of the present model. We also demonstrate the need for extremely large\nvolumes (>400 Mpc on a side) to accurately determine the incidence of rare\nlarge-scale features in the Lyman-alpha forest.\n", "  We study a chain of magnetic moments exchange coupled to a conventional three\ndimensional superconductor. In the normal state the chain orders into a\ncollinear configuration, while in the superconducting phase we find that\nferromagnetism is unstable to the formation of a magnetic spiral state. Beyond\nweak exchange coupling the spiral wavevector greatly exceeds the inverse\nsuperconducting coherence length as a result of the strong spin-spin\ninteraction mediated through the subgap band of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states.\nMoreover, the simple spin-spin exchange description breaks down as the subgap\nband crosses the Fermi energy, wherein the spiral phase becomes stabilized by\nthe spontaneous opening of a $p-$wave superconducting gap within the band. This\nleads to the possibility of electron-driven topological superconductivity with\nMajorana boundary modes using magnetic atoms on superconducting surfaces.\n", "  We study a massless Dirac particle with PT symmetric non-Hermitian Rashba\ninteraction in the background of Dirac oscillator potential to show the PT\nphase transition in a (2+1) dimensional relativistic system analytically. PT\nphase transition occurs when strength of the (i) imaginary Rashba interaction\nor (ii) transverse magnetic field exceed their respective critical values.\nSmall mass gap in the spectrum, consistent with other approaches is generated\nas long as the system is in the unbroken phase. Relativistic Landau levels are\nconstructed explicitly for such a system.\n", "  High-quality rare-earth-ion (REI) doped materials are a prerequisite for many\napplications such as quantum memories, ultra-high-resolution optical spectrum\nanalyzers and information processing. Compared to bulk materials, REI doped\npowders offer low-cost fabrication and a greater range of accessible material\nsystems. Here we show that crystal properties, such as nuclear spin lifetime,\nare strongly affected by mechanical treatment, and that spectral hole burning\ncan serve as a sensitive method to characterize the quality of REI doped\npowders. We focus on the specific case of thulium doped Y$_2$Al$_5$O$_{12}$\n(Tm:YAG). Different methods for obtaining the powders are compared and the\ninfluence of annealing on the spectroscopic quality of powders is investigated\non a few examples. We conclude that annealing can reverse some detrimental\neffects of powder fabrication and, in certain cases, the properties of the bulk\nmaterial can be reached. Our results may be applicable to other impurities and\nother crystals, including color centers in nano-structured diamond.\n", "  By means of circularly polarized x-ray beam at Dy L3 and Fe K absorption\nedges, the chiral structure of the electric quadrupole was investigated for a\nsingle crystal of DyFe3(BO3)4 in which both Dy and Fe ions are arranged in\nspiral manners. The integrated intensity of the resonant x- ray diffraction of\nspace-group forbidden reflections 004 and 005 is interpreted within the\nelectric dipole transitions from Dy 2p3 to 5d and Fe 1s to 4p, respectively. We\nhave confirmed that the 2 handedness of the crystal observed at Dy L3 and Fe K\nedges is consistent with that observed at Dy M5 edge in the previous study. By\nanalyzing the azimuth scans of the diffracted intensity, the electronic\nquadrupole moments of Dy 5d and Fe 4p are derived. The temperature profiles of\nthe integrated intensity of 004 at the Dy L3 and the Fe K edges are similar to\nthose of Dy-O and Fe-O bond lengths, while that at the Dy M5 edge does not. The\nresults indicate that the helix chiral orientations of quadrupole moments due\nto Dy 5d and Fe 4p electrons are more strongly affected by the crystal fields\nthan Dy 4f.\n", "  We study the excitation spectrum of a family of transverse-field spin chain\nmodels with variable interaction range and arbitrary spin $S$, which in the\ncase of $S=1/2$ interpolates between the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick and the Ising\nmodel. For any finite number $N$ of spins, a semiclassical energy manifold is\nderived in the large-$S$ limit employing bosonization methods, and its geometry\nis shown to determine not only the leading-order term but also the higher-order\nquantum fluctuations. Based on a multi-configurational mean-field ansatz, we\nobtain the semiclassical backbone of the quantum spectrum through the extremal\npoints of a series of one-dimensional energy landscapes -- each one exhibiting\na bifurcation when the external magnetic field drops below a threshold value.\nThe obtained spectra become exact in the limit of vanishing or very strong\nexternal, transverse magnetic fields. Further analysis of the higher-order\ncorrections in $1/\\sqrt{2S}$ enables us to analytically study the dispersion\nrelations of spin-wave excitations around the semiclassical energy levels.\nWithin the same model, we are able to investigate quantum bifurcations, which\noccur in the semiclassical ($S\\gg 1$) limit, and quantum phase transitions,\nwhich are observed in the thermodynamic ($N\\rightarrow\\infty$) limit.\n", "  We address the question of how much entanglement can be certified from the\nobserved correlations and the knowledge of the Hilbert space dimension of the\nmeasured systems. We focus on the case in which both systems are known to be\nqubits. For several correlations (though not for all), one can certify the same\namount of entanglement as with state tomography, but with fewer assumptions,\nsince nothing is assumed about the measurements. We also present security\nproofs of quantum key distribution without any assumption on the measurements.\nWe discuss how both the amount of entanglement and the security of quantum key\ndistribution (QKD) are affected by the inefficiency of detectors in this\nscenario.\n", "  X-rays and gamma-rays from astronomical sources such as solar flares are\nmostly absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere. Resulting electron-ion production\nrate as a function of height depends on the intensity and wavelength of the\ninjected spectrum and therefore the effects vary from one source to another. In\nother words, the ion density vs. altitude profile has the imprint of the\nincident photon spectrum. In this paper, we investigate whether we can invert\nthe problem uniquely by deconvolution of the VLF amplitude signal to obtain the\ndetails of the injected spectrum. We find that it is possible to do this up to\na certain accuracy. Our method is useful to carry out a similar exercise to\ninfer the spectra of more energetic events such as the Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs),\nSoft Gamma Ray Repeaters (SGRs) etc. by probing even the lower part of the\natmosphere. We thus show that to certain extent, the Earth's atmosphere could\nbe used as a gigantic detector of relatively strong events.\n", "  Magnetic random-access memory (MRAM) driven by spin-transfer torque (STT) is\na major contender for future memory applications. The energy dissipation\ninvolved in writing remains problematic, even with the advent of more efficient\nperpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) devices. A promising alternative\nswitching mechanism employs spin-orbit torques and the spin-Hall effect (SHE)\nin particular, but additional symmetry breaking is required to achieve\ndeterministic switching in PMA devices. Currently used methods rely on in-plane\nmagnetic fields or anisotropy gradients, which are not suitable for practical\napplications. Here, we interface the magnetic layer with an anti-ferromagnetic\nmaterial. An in-plane exchange bias (EB) is created, and shown to enable\nfield-free SHE-driven magnetization reversal of a perpendicularly magnetized\nPt/Co/IrMn structure. Aside from the potential technological implications, our\nexperiment provides additional insight into the local spin structure at the\nferromagnetic/anti-ferromagnetic interface.\n", "  The Fr\\\"ohlich model describes the interaction of a mobile impurity with a\nsurrounding bath of phonons which leads to the formation of a quasiparticle,\nthe polaron. In this article an efficient renormalization group approach is\npresented which provides a description of Fr\\\"ohlich polarons in all regimes\nranging from weak- to strong coupling. We apply the method to the Bose polaron\nproblem of an ultracold impurity atom interacting with a background gas that is\nBose-condensed. The extended renormalization group approach introduced here is\ncapable to predict ground state properties for arbitrarily small impurity\nmasses. This allows us to obtain the full phase diagram of the corresponding\nBogoliubov-Fr\\\"ohlich Hamiltonian, characterized by two dimensionless coupling\nconstants. Our method is benchmarked by comparison of the ground state energy\nto recent diagrammatic quantum Monte Carlo calculations.\n", "  Computing entanglement entropy and its cousins is often challenging even in\nthe simplest continuum and lattice models, partly because such entropies depend\nnontrivially on all geometric characteristics of the entangling region. Quantum\ninformation measures between two or more regions are even more complicated, but\ncontain more, and universal, information. In this paper, we focus on R\\'{e}nyi\nentropy and information of the order $n=2$. For a free field theory, we show\nthat these quantities are mapped to the change of the thermodynamic free energy\nby introducing boundaries subject to Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions\nin one higher dimension. This mapping allows us to exploit the powerful tools\navailable in the context of thermal Casimir effect, specifically a multipole\nexpansion suited for computing the R\\'{e}nyi information between\narbitrarily-shaped regions. In particular, we compute the R\\'{e}nyi information\nbetween two disk-shaped regions at an arbitrary separation distance. We provide\nan alternative representation of the R\\'{e}nyi information as a sum over\nclosed-loop polymers, which establishes a connection to purely entropic\neffects, and proves useful in deriving information inequalities. Finally, we\ndiscuss extensions of our results beyond free field theories.\n", "  Proximity orbital and spin-orbital effects of graphene on monolayer\ntransition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are investigated from\nfirst-principles. The Dirac band structure of graphene is found to lie within\nthe semiconducting gap of TMDCs for sulfides and selenides, while it merges\nwith the valence band for tellurides. In the former case the proximity-induced\nstaggered potential gaps and spin-orbit couplings (all on the meV scale) of the\nDirac electrons are established by fitting to a phenomenological effective\nHamiltonian. While graphene on MoS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, and WS$_2$ has a\ntopologically trivial band structure, graphene on WSe$_2$ exhibits inverted\nbands. Using a realistic tight-binding model we find topologically protected\nhelical edge states for graphene zigzag nanoribbons on WSe$_2$, demonstrating\nthe quantum spin Hall effect. This model also features \"half-topological\nstates\", which are protected against time-reversal disorder on one edge only.\n", "  A sample-based stochastic model is presented to investigate the effects of\nuncertainties of various input parameters, including laser fluence, laser pulse\nduration, thermal conductivity constants for electron, and electron-lattice\ncoupling factor, on solid-liquid phase change of gold film under nano- to\nfemtosecond laser irradiation. Rapid melting and resolidification of a free\nstanding gold film subject to nano- to femtosecond laser are simulated using a\ntwo-temperature model incorporated with the interfacial tracking method. The\ninterfacial velocity and temperature are obtained by solving the energy\nequation in terms of volumetric enthalpy for control volume. The convergence of\nvariance (COV) is used to characterize the variability of the input parameters,\nand the interquartile range (IQR) is used to calculate the uncertainty of the\noutput parameters. The IQR analysis shows that the laser fluence and the\nelectron-lattice coupling factor have the strongest influences on the\ninterfacial location, velocity, and temperatures.\n", "  We investigate different methods to incorporate the effect of photons in hard\nprocesses. We compare two different approaches used for calculating cross\nsections for two-photon $p p \\to l^+ l^- X$ process. In one of the approaches\nphoton is treated as a collinear parton in the proton. In the second approach\nrecently proposed a $k_T$-factorization method is used. We discuss how results\nof the collinear parton model depend on the initial condition for the QCD\nevolution and discuss an approximate treatment where photon is excluded from\nthe combined QCD-QED evolution. We demonstrate that it is not necessary to put\nphoton into the evolution equation as often done recently but it is sufficient\nto use a simplified approach in which photon couples to quarks and antiquarks\nwhich by themselves undergo DGLAP evolution equations. We discuss sensitivity\nof the results to the choice of structure function parametrization and\nexperimental cuts in the $k_T$-factorization approach. A new optimal structure\nfunction parametrization is proposed. We compare results of our calculations\nwith recent experimental data for dilepton production and find that in most\ncases the contribution of the photon-photon mechanism is rather small. We\ndiscuss how to enhance the photon-photon contribution. We also compare our\nresults to those of recent measurements of exclusive and semi-exclusive $e^+\ne^-$ pair production with certain experimental data by the CMS collaboration.\n", "  We establish a variational principle for properly mapping a fractional\nquantum Hall (FQH) state to a fractional Chern insulator (FCI). We find that\nthe mapping has a gauge freedom which could generate a class of FCI ground\nstate wave functions appropriate for different forms of interactions.\nTherefore, the gauge should be fixed by a variational principle that minimizes\nthe interaction energy of the FCI model. For a soft and isotropic\nelectron-electron interaction, the principle leads to a gauge coinciding with\nthat for maximally localized \\emph{two-dimensional} projected Wannier functions\nof a Landau level.\n", "  We investigate the statistical properties, based on numerical simulations and\nanalytical calculations, of a recently proposed stochastic model for the\nvelocity field of an incompressible, homogeneous, isotropic and fully developed\nturbulent flow. A key step in the construction of this model is the\nintroduction of some aspects of the vorticity stretching mechanism that governs\nthe dynamics of fluid particles along their trajectory. An additional further\nphenomenological step aimed at including the long range correlated nature of\nturbulence makes this model depending on a single free parameter $\\gamma$ that\ncan be estimated from experimental measurements. We confirm the realism of the\nmodel regarding the geometry of the velocity gradient tensor, the power-law\nbehaviour of the moments of velocity increments (i.e. the structure functions),\nincluding the intermittent corrections, and the existence of energy transfers\nacross scales. We quantify the dependence of these basic properties of\nturbulent flows on the free parameter $\\gamma$ and derive analytically the\nspectrum of exponents of the structure functions in a simplified non\ndissipative case. A perturbative expansion in power of $\\gamma$ shows that\nenergy transfers, at leading order, indeed take place, justifying the\ndissipative nature of this random field.\n", "  We study the evolution of the stellar component and the metallicity of both\nthe intracluster medium and of stars in massive ($M_{\\rm vir}\\approx 6\\times\n10^{14}$ M$_{\\odot}/h$) simulated galaxy clusters from the Rhapsody-G suite in\ndetail and compare them to observational results. The simulations were\nperformed with the AMR code RAMSES and include the effect of AGN feedback at\nthe sub-grid level. AGN feedback is required to produce realistic galaxy and\ncluster properties and plays a role in mixing material in the central regions\nand regulating star formation in the central galaxy. In both our low and high\nresolution runs with fiducial stellar yields, we find that stellar and ICM\nmetallicities are a factor of two lower than in observations. We find that cool\ncore clusters exhibit steeper metallicity gradients than non-cool core\nclusters, in qualitative agreement with observations. We verify that the ICM\nmetallicities measured in the simulation can be explained by a simple\n\"regulator\" model in which the metallicity is set by a balance of stellar yield\nand gas accretion. It is plausible that a combination of higher resolution and\nhigher metal yield in AMR simulation would allow the metallicity of simulated\nclusters to match observed values; however this hypothesis needs to be tested\nwith future simulations. Comparison to recent literature highlights that\nresults concerning the metallicity of clusters and cluster galaxies might\ndepend sensitively on the scheme chosen to solve the hydrodynamics.\n", "  Green's functions for Rossby waves in an azimuthal wind are obtained, in\nwhich the stream-function $\\psi$ depends on $r$, $\\phi$ and $t$, where $r$ is\ncylindrical radius and $\\phi$ is the azimuthal angle in the $\\beta$-plane\nrelative to the easterly direction, in which the $x$-axis points east and the\n$y$-axis points north. The Rossby wave Green's function with no wind is\nobtained using Fourier transform methods, and is related to the previously\nknown Green's function obtained for this case, which has a different but\nequivalent form to the Green's function obtained in the present paper. We\nemphasize the role of the wave eikonal solution, which plays an important role\nin the form of the solution. The corresponding Green's function for a rotating\nwind with azimuthal wind velocity ${\\bf u}=\\Omega r{\\bf e}_\\phi$\n($\\Omega=$const.) is also obtained by Fourier methods, in which the advective\nrotation operator in position space is transformed to a rotation operator in\n${\\bf k}$ transform space. The finite Rossby deformation radius is included in\nthe analysis. The physical characteristics of the Green's functions are\ndelineated and applications are discussed. In the limit as $\\Omega\\to 0$, the\nrotating wind Green's function reduces to the Rossby wave Green function with\nno wind.\n", "  We present the complete set of ultra-violet, optical and near-infrared\nphotometry and spectroscopy for SN 2012ca, covering the period from 6~days\nprior to maximum light, until 531 days after maximum. The spectroscopic time\nseries for SN 2012ca is essentially unchanged over 1.5 years, and appear to be\ndominated at all epochs by signatures of interaction with a dense circumstellar\nmedium rather than the underlying supernova (SN). At late phases, we see a near\ninfrared excess in flux which is possibly associated with dust formation,\nalthough without any signs of accompanying line shifts. SN 2012ca is a member\nof the set of type of the ambiguous IIn/Ia-CSM SNe, the nature of which have\nbeen debated extensively in the literature. The two leading scenarios are\neither a type Ia SN exploding within a dense CSM from a non-degenerate, evolved\ncompanion, or a core-collapse SN from a massive star. While some members of the\npopulation have been unequivocally associated with type Ia SNe, in other cases\nthe association is less certain. While it is possible that SN 2012ca does arise\nfrom a thermonuclear SN, this would require a relatively high (between 20 and\n70 per cent) efficiency in converting kinetic energy to optical luminosity, and\na massive (~2.3-2.6 Msun) circumstellar medium. On the basis of energetics, and\nthe results of simple modelling, we suggest that SN 2012ca is more likely\nassociated with a core-collapse SN. This would imply that the observed set of\nsimilar SNe to SN 2012ca is in fact originated by two populations, and while\nthese are drawn from physically distinct channels, they can have\nobservationally similar properties.\n", "  A search for a heavy scalar boson H decaying into a pair of lighter\nstandard-model-like 125 GeV Higgs bosons h and a search for a heavy\npseudoscalar boson A decaying into a Z and an h boson are presented. The\nsearches are performed on a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity\nof 19.7 inverse femtobarns of pp collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 8\nTeV, collected by CMS in 2012. A final state consisting of two tau leptons and\ntwo b jets is used to search for the H to hh decay. A final state consisting of\ntwo tau leptons from the h boson decay, and two additional leptons from the Z\nboson decay, is used to search for the decay A to Zh. The results are\ninterpreted in the context of the two-Higgs-doublet models. No excess is found\nabove the standard model expectation and upper limits are set on the heavy\nboson production cross sections in the mass ranges 260 < m[H] < 350 GeV and 220\n< m[A] < 350 GeV.\n", "  We have performed high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy\n(ARPES) on noncentrosymmetric Weyl semimetal candidate NbP, and determined the\nelectronic states of both Nb- and P-terminated surfaces corresponding to the\n\"opposite\" surfaces of a polar crystal. We revealed a drastic difference in the\nFermi-surface topology between the opposite surfaces, whereas the Fermi arcs on\nboth surfaces are likely terminated at the surface projection of the same bulk\nWeyl nodes. Comparison of the ARPES data with our first-principles band\ncalculations suggests notable difference in electronic structure at the\nNb-terminated surface between theory and experiment. The present result opens a\nplatform for realizing exotic quantum phenomena arising from unusual surface\nproperties of Weyl semimetals.\n", "  Time-series photometry of the CoRoT field SRc02 was obtained by the Berlin\nExoplanet Search Telescope II (BEST II) in 2009. The main aim was the ground\nbased follow-up of the CoRoT field in order to detect variable stars with\nbetter spatial resolution than what can be achieved with the CoRoT space\ntelescope. A total of 1,846 variable stars were detected, of which only 30 have\nbeen previously known. For nine eclipsing binaries the stellar parameters were\ndetermined by modeling their light curve.\n", "  Radio frequency tunable oscillators are vital electronic components for\nsignal generation, characterization, and processing. They are often constructed\nwith a resonant circuit and a 'negative' resistor, such as a Gunn-diode,\ninvolving complex structure and large footprints. Here we report that a piece\nof SmB6, 100 micron in size, works as a current-controlled oscillator in the 30\nMHz frequency range. SmB6 is a strongly correlated Kondo insulator that was\nrecently found to have a robust surface state likely to be protected by the\ntopology of its electronics structure. We exploit its non-linear dynamics, and\ndemonstrate large AC voltage outputs with frequencies from 20 Hz to 30 MHz by\nadjusting a small DC bias current. The behaviors of these oscillators agree\nwell with a theoretical model describing the thermal and electronic dynamics of\ncoupled surface and bulk states. With reduced crystal size we anticipate the\ndevice to work at higher frequencies, even in the THz regime. This type of\noscillator might be realized in other materials with a metallic surface and a\nsemiconducting bulk.\n", "  Erwin Schrodinger famously and presciently ascribed the vehicle transmitting\nthe hereditary information underlying life to an `aperiodic crystal'. We\ncompare and contrast this, only later discovered to be stored in the linear\nbiomolecule DNA, with the information bearing, layered quasi-one-dimensional\nmaterials investigated by the emerging field of chaotic crystallography.\nDespite differences in functionality, the same information measures capture\nstructure and novelty in both, suggesting an intimate coherence between the\ninformation character of biotic and abiotic matter---a broadly applicable\nphysics of information. We review layered solids and consider three examples of\nhow information- and computation-theoretic techniques are being applied to\nunderstand their structure. In particular, (i) we review recent efforts to\napply new kinds of information measures to quantify disordered crystals; (ii)\nwe discuss the structure of ice I in information-theoretic terms; and (iii) we\nrecount recent experimental results on tris(bicyclo[2.1.1]hexeno)benzene TBHB),\nshowing how an information-theoretic analysis yields additional insight into\nits structure. We then illustrate a new Second Law of Thermodynamics that\ndescribes information processing in active low-dimensional materials, reviewing\nMaxwell's Demon and a new class of molecular devices that act as information\ncatalysts. Lastly, we conclude by speculating on how these ideas from\ninformational materials science may impact biology.\n", "  We investigated the temperature dependence of the superlattice intensity and\nthermal diffuse scattering intensity of BaAl2O4, which has a network structure\nwith corner-sharing AlO4 tetrahedra, via synchrotron X-ray diffraction\nexperiments. The temperature variation of the superlattice intensity revealed\nthat the structural phase transition occurs at TC = 451.4 K from the P6322\nparent crystal structure to the low-temperature superstructure with a cell\nvolume of 2a x 2b x c. BaAl2O4 exhibits an unconventional structural phase\ntransition driven by two competing soft modes, q1/2 ~ (1/2, 1/2, 0) and q1/3 ~\n(1/3, 1/3, 0). When approaching the TC from above, the soft mode with q1/3\nappeared first and was followed by the q1/2 soft mode. The thermal diffuse\nscattering intensities from both soft modes increased sharply at TC; therefore,\nboth modes condensed simultaneously. The first principles calculation revealed\nthat structural instabilities exist at the M- and K-points, at which the\ncalculated imaginary frequencies are similar. The small energy difference of\nthese structural instabilities generates the two competing soft modes and\ndetermines the eventual low-temperature crystal structure.\n", "  We discuss an idealized model of halo formation, in which a collapsing halo\nnode is tetrahedral, with a filament extruding from each of its four faces, and\nwith a wall connecting each pair of filaments. In the model, filaments\ngenerally spin when they form, and the halo spins if and only if there is some\nrotation in filaments. This is the simplest-possible fully three-dimensional\nhalo collapse in the 'origami approximation,' in which voids are irrotational,\nand the dark-matter sheet out of which dark-matter structures form is allowed\nto fold in position-velocity phase space, but not stretch (i.e., it cannot vary\nin density along a stream). Up to an overall scaling, the four filament\ndirections, and only three other quantities, such as filament spins, suffice to\ndetermine all of the collapse's properties: the shape, mass, and spin of the\nhalo; the densities per unit length and spins of all filaments; and masses per\nunit area of the walls. If the filaments are arranged regular-tetrahedrally,\nfilament properties obey simple laws, reminiscent of angular-momentum\nconservation. The model may be most useful in understanding spin correlations\nbetween neighboring galaxies joined by filaments; these correlations would give\nintrinsic alignments between galaxies, essential to understand for accurate\ncosmological weak-lensing measurements.\n", "  The latest observation of HL Tau by ALMA revealed spectacular concentric dust\nrings in its circumstellar disk. We attempt to explain the multiple ring\nstructure as a consequence of aggregate sintering. Sintering is known to reduce\nthe sticking efficiency of dust aggregates and occurs at temperatures slightly\nbelow the sublimation point of their constituent material. We here present a\ndust growth model incorporating sintering and use it to simulate global dust\nevolution due to sintering, coagulation, fragmentation, and radial inward drift\nin a modeled HL Tau disk. We show that aggregates consisting of multiple\nspecies of volatile ices experience sintering, collisionally disrupt, and pile\nup at multiple locations slightly outside the snow lines of the volatiles. At\nwavelengths of 0.87--1.3 mm, these sintering zones appear as bright, optically\nthick rings with a spectral slope of $\\approx 2$, whereas the non-sintering\nzones as darker, optically thinner rings of a spectral slope of $\\approx$\n2.3--2.5. The observational features of the sintering and non-sintering zones\nare consistent with those of the major bright and dark rings found in the HL\nTau disk, respectively. Radial pileup and vertical settling occur\nsimultaneously if disk turbulence is weak and if monomers constituting the\naggregates are $\\sim 1~{\\rm \\mu m}$ in radius. For the radial gas temperature\nprofile of $T = 310(r/1~{\\rm AU})^{-0.57}~{\\rm K}$, our model perfectly\nreproduces the brightness temperatures of the optically thick bright rings, and\nreproduces their orbital distances to an accuracy of $\\lesssim$ 30%.\n", "  We study the matter bispectrum of the large-scale structure by comparing\ndifferent perturbative and phenomenological models with measurements from\n$N$-body simulations obtained with a modal bispectrum estimator. Using shape\nand amplitude correlators, we directly compare simulated data with theoretical\nmodels over the full three-dimensional domain of the bispectrum, for different\nredshifts and scales. We review and investigate the main perturbative methods\nin the literature that predict the one-loop bispectrum: standard perturbation\ntheory, effective field theory, resummed Lagrangian and renormalised\nperturbation theory, calculating the latter also at two loops for some triangle\nconfigurations. We find that effective field theory (EFT) succeeds in extending\nthe range of validity furthest into the mildly nonlinear regime, albeit at the\nprice of free extra parameters requiring calibration on simulations. For the\nmore phenomenological halo model, we confirm that despite its validity in the\ndeeply nonlinear regime it has a deficit of power on intermediate scales, which\nworsens at higher redshifts; this issue is ameliorated, but not solved, by\ncombined halo-perturbative models. We show from simulations that in this\ntransition region there is a strong squeezed bispectrum component that is\nsignificantly underestimated in the halo model at earlier redshifts. We thus\npropose a phenomenological method for alleviating this deficit, which we\ndevelop into a simple phenomenological \"three-shape\" benchmark model based on\nthe three fundamental shapes we have obtained from studying the halo model.\nWhen calibrated on the simulations, this three-shape benchmark model accurately\ndescribes the bispectrum on all scales and redshifts considered, providing a\nprototype bispectrum HALOFIT-like methodology that could be used to describe\nand test parameter dependencies.\n", "  Castillo, et al. report hormesis by background levels of radiation, at which\nthere is $< 10^{-3}$ ionization per bacterium in a replication time. This\nsuggests radiation products accumulate in the growth medium over much longer\ntimes. Experiments are proposed to test this hypothesis.\n", "  Plasmonic metasurfaces enable simultaneous control of the phase, momentum,\namplitude and polarisation of light and hence promise great utility in\nrealisation of compact photonic devices. In this paper, we demonstrate a novel\nchip-scale device suitable for simultaneous polarisation and spectral\nmeasurements through use of six integrated plasmonic metasurfaces (IPMs), which\ndiffract light with a given polarisation state and spectral component into\nwell-defined spatial domains. Full calibration and characterisation of our\ndevice is presented, whereby good spectral resolution and polarisation accuracy\nover a wavelength range of 500-700~nm is shown. Functionality of our device in\na M\\\"uller matrix modality is demonstrated through determination of the\npolarisation properties of a commercially available variable waveplate. Our\nproposed IPM is robust, compact and can be fabricated with a single\nphotolithography step, promising many applications in polarisation imaging,\nquantum communication and quantitative sensing.\n", "  Many early universe theories predict the creation of Primordial Black Holes\n(PBHs). PBHs could have masses ranging from the Planck mass to 10^5 solar\nmasses or higher depending on the size of the universe at formation. A Black\nHole (BH) has a Hawking temperature which is inversely proportional to its\nmass. Hence a sufficiently small BH will quasi-thermally radiate particles at\nan ever-increasing rate as emission lowers its mass and raises its temperature.\nThe final moments of this evaporation phase should be explosive and its\ndescription is dependent on the particle physics model. In this work we\ninvestigate the final few seconds of BH evaporation, using the Standard Model\nand incorporating the most recent Large Hadron Collider (LHC) results, and\nprovide a new parameterization for the instantaneous emission spectrum. We\ncalculate for the first time energy-dependent PBH burst light curves in the\nGeV/TeV energy range. Moreover, we explore PBH burst search methods and\npotential observational PBH burst signatures. We have found a unique signature\nin the PBH burst light curves that may be detectable by GeV/TeV gamma-ray\nobservatories such as the High Altitude Water Cerenkov (HAWC) observatory. The\nimplications of beyond the Standard Model theories on the PBH burst\nobservational characteristics are also discussed, including potential\nsensitivity of the instantaneous photon detection rate to a squark threshold in\nthe 5 -10 TeV range.\n", "  We report Faraday rotation measurements of 11 extragalactic radio sources\nwith lines of sight through the Rosette Nebula, a prominent HII region\nassociated with the star cluster NGC 2244. It is also a prototypical example of\na \"stellar bubble\" produced by the winds of the stars in NGC 2244. The goal of\nthese measurements is to better determine the strength and structure of the\nmagnetic field in the nebula. We calculate the rotation measure (RM) through\ntwo methods, a least-squares fit to $\\chi$( $\\lambda^2$) and Rotation Measure\nSynthesis. In conjunction with our results from Savage et al. (2013), we find\nan excess RM due to the shell of the nebula of +40 to +1200 rad m$^{-2}$ above\na background RM of +147 rad m$^{-2}$. We discuss two forms of a simple shell\nmodel intended to reproduce the magnitude of the observed RM as a function of\ndistance from the center of the Rosette Nebula. The models represent different\nphysical situations for the magnetic field within the shell of the nebula. The\nfirst assumes that there is an increase in the magnetic field strength and\nplasma density at the outer radius of the HII region, such as would be produced\nby a strong magnetohydrodynamic shock wave. The second model assumes that any\nincrease in the RM is due solely to an increase in the density, and the\nGalactic magnetic field is unaffected in the shell. We employ a Bayesian\nanalysis to distinguish between the two forms of the model.\n", "  We examine the evolution of the relation between stellar mass surface\ndensity, velocity dispersion and half-light radius$-$the stellar mass\nfundamental plane$-$for quiescent galaxies at $z<0.6$. We measure the local\nrelation from galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the intermediate\nredshift relation from $\\sim500$ quiescent galaxies with stellar masses $10\n\\lesssim \\mathrm{log}(M_\\ast/M_\\odot) \\lesssim 11.5$. Nearly half of the\nquiescent galaxies in our intermediate redshift sample are compact. After\naccounting for important selection and systematic effects, the velocity\ndispersion distribution of galaxies at intermediate redshifts is similar to\ngalaxies in the local universe. Galaxies at $z<0.6$ appear to be smaller\n($\\lesssim0.1$ dex) than galaxies in the local sample. The orientation of the\nstellar mass fundamental plane is independent of redshift for massive quiescent\ngalaxies at $z<0.6$ and the zero-point evolves by $\\sim 0.04$ dex. Compact\nquiescent galaxies fall on the same relation as the extended objects. We\nconfirm that compact quiescent galaxies are the tail of the size and mass\ndistribution of the normal quiescent galaxy population.\n", "  We study the dynamics of the equation obtained by Schryer and Walker for the\nmotion of domain walls. The reduced equation is a reaction diffusion equation\nfor the angle between the applied field and the magnetization vector. If the\nhard axis anisotropy $K_d$ is much larger than the easy axis anisotropy $K_u$,\nthere is a range of applied fields where the dynamics does not select the\nSchryer-Walker solution. We give analytic expressions for the speed of the\ndomain wall in this regime and the conditions for its existence.\n", "  We have studied the proximity-induced superconducting triplet pairing in\nCoO$_x$/Py1/Cu/Py2/Cu/Pb spin-valve structure (where Py =\nNi$_{0.81}$Fe$_{0.19}$). By optimizing the parameters of this structure we\nfound a triplet channel assisted full switching between the normal and\nsuperconducting states. To observe an \"isolated\" triplet spin-valve effect we\nexploited the oscillatory feature of the magnitude of the ordinary spin-valve\neffect $\\Delta T_c$ in the dependence of the Py2-layer thickness $d_{Py2}$. We\ndetermined the value of $d_{Py2}$ at which $\\Delta T_c$ caused by the ordinary\nspin-valve effect (the difference in the superconducting transition temperature\n$T_c$ between the antiparallel and parallel mutual orientation of\nmagnetizations of the Py1 and Py2 layers) is suppressed. For such a sample a\n\"pure\" triplet spin-valve effect which causes the minimum in $T_c$ at the\northogonal configuration of magnetizations has been observed.\n", "  The junction conditions for the most general gravitational theory with a\nLagrangian containing terms quadratic in the curvature are derived. We include\nthe cases with a possible concentration of matter on the joining hypersurface\n-termed as thin shells, domain walls or braneworlds in the literature- as well\nas the proper matching conditions where only finite jumps of the\nenergy-momentum tensor are allowed. In the latter case we prove that the\nmatching conditions are more demanding than in General Relativity. In the\nformer case, we show that generically the shells/domain walls are of a new kind\nbecause they possess, in addition to the standard energy-momentum tensor, a\ndouble layer energy-momentum contribution which actually induces an external\nenergy flux vector and an external scalar pressure/tension on the shell. We\nprove that all these contributions are necessary to make the entire\nenergy-momentum tensor divergence-free, and we present the field equations\nsatisfied by these energy-momentum quantities. The consequences of all these\nresults are briefly analyzed.\n", "  We report the discovery of one RR Lyrae star in the ultra--faint satellite\ngalaxy Hydra II based on time series photometry in the g, r and i bands\nobtained with the Dark Energy Camera at Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory,\nChile. The RR Lyrae star has a mean magnitude of $i = 21.30\\pm 0.04$ which\ntranslates to a heliocentric distance of $151\\pm 8$ kpc for Hydra II; this\nvalue is $\\sim 13\\%$ larger than the estimate from the discovery paper based on\nthe average magnitude of several blue horizontal branch star candidates. The\nnew distance implies a slightly larger half-light radius of $76^{+12}_{-10}$ pc\nand a brighter absolute magnitude of $M_V = -5.1 \\pm 0.3$, which keeps this\nobject within the realm of the dwarf galaxies. The pulsational properties of\nthe RR Lyrae star ($P=0.645$ d, $\\Delta g = 0.68$ mag) suggest Hydra II may be\na member of the intermediate Oosterhoff or Oosterhoff II group. A comparison\nwith other RR Lyrae stars in ultra--faint systems indicates similar pulsational\nproperties among them, which are different to those found among halo field\nstars and those in the largest of the Milky Way satellites. We also report the\ndiscovery of 31 additional short period variables in the field of view (RR\nLyrae, SX Phe, eclipsing binaries, and a likely anomalous cepheid). However,\ngiven their magnitudes and large angular separation from Hydra II, they must be\nfield stars not related to Hydra II.\n", "  We evaluate the local variance of the Hubble Constant $H_0$ with low-z Type\nIa Supernovae (SNe). Our analyses are performed using a hemispherical\ncomparison method in order to test whether taking the bulk flow motion into\naccount can reconcile the measurement of the Hubble Constant $H_0$ from\nstandard candles ($H_0 = 73.8 \\pm 2.4 \\; \\mathrm{km \\; s}^{-1}\\;\n\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$) with that of the Planck's Cosmic Microwave Background data\n($H_0 = 67.8 \\pm 0.9 \\; \\mathrm{km \\; s}^{-1} \\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$). We obtaina\nHubble Constant maximal variance of $\\delta H_0 = (2.30 \\pm 0.86) \\; \\mathrm{km\n\\; s}^{-1} \\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ towards the $(l,b) = (315^{\\circ},27^{\\circ})$\ndirection. Interestingly, this result agrees with the bulk flow direction\nestimates found in the literature, as well as previous evaluations of the $H_0$\nvariance due to the presence of nearby inhomogeneities. We assess the\nstatistical significance of this result with different prescriptions of Monte\nCarlo simulations, obtaining moderate statistical significance, i.e., $68.7$\\%\nconfidence level (CL) for such variance. Furthermore, we test the hypothesis of\na higher $H_0$ value in the presence of a bulk flow velocity dipole, finding\nsome evidence for this result which, however, cannot be claimed to be\nsignificant due to the current large uncertainty in the SNe distance modulus.\nThen, we conclude that the tension between different $H_0$ determinations can\nplausibly be caused to the bulk flow motion of the local Universe, even though\nthe current incompleteness of the SNe data set, both in terms of celestial\ncoverage and distance uncertainties, does not allow a high statistical\nsignificance for these results or a definitive conclusion about this issue.\n", "  We present ground-based optical photometric monitoring data for NGC 5548,\npart of an extended multi-wavelength reverberation mapping campaign. The light\ncurves have nearly daily cadence from 2014 January to July in nine filters\n(\\emph{BVRI} and \\emph{ugriz}). Combined with ultraviolet data from the\n\\emph{Hubble Space Telescope} and \\emph{Swift}, we confirm significant time\ndelays between the continuum bands as a function of wavelength, extending the\nwavelength coverage from 1158\\,\\AA\\ to the $z$ band ($\\sim\\!9160$\\,\\AA). We\nfind that the lags at wavelengths longer than the {\\it V} band are equal to or\ngreater than the lags of high-ionization-state emission lines (such as He\\,{\\sc\nii}\\,$\\lambda 1640$ and $\\lambda 4686$), suggesting that the continuum-emitting\nsource is of a physical size comparable to the inner broad-line region (BLR).\nThe trend of lag with wavelength is broadly consistent with the prediction for\ncontinuum reprocessing by an accretion disk with $\\tau \\propto \\lambda^{4/3}$.\nHowever, the lags also imply a disk radius that is 3 times larger than the\nprediction from standard thin-disk theory, assuming that the bolometric\nluminosity is 10\\% of the Eddington luminosity ($L = 0.1L_{\\rm Edd}$). Using\noptical spectra from the Large Binocular Telescope, we estimate the bias of the\ninterband continuum lags due to BLR emission observed in the filters. We find\nthat the bias for filters with high levels of BLR contamination ($\\sim\\! 20\\%$)\ncan be important for the shortest continuum lags, and likely has a significant\nimpact on the {\\it u} and {\\it U} bands owing to Balmer continuum emission.\n", "  We review a new theory of viscoelasticity of a glass-forming viscous liquid\nnear and below the glass transition. In our model we assume that each point in\nthe material has a specific viscosity, which varies randomly in space according\nto a fluctuating activation free energy. We include a Maxwellian elastic term\nand assume that the corresponding shear modulus fluctuates as well with the\nsame distribution as that of the activation barriers. The model is solved in\ncoherent-potential approximation (CPA), for which a derivation is given. The\ntheory predicts an Arrhenius-type temperature dependence of the viscosity in\nthe vanishing-frequency limit, independent of the distribution of the\nactivation barriers. The theory implies that this activation energy is\ngenerally different from that of a diffusing particle with the same\nbarrier-height distribution. If the distribution of activation barriers is\nassumed to have Gaussian form, the finite-frequency version of the theory\ndescribes well the typical low-temperature alpha relaxation peak of glasses.\nBeta relaxation can be included by adding another Gaussian with center at much\nlower energies than that responsible for the alpha relaxation. At high\nfrequencies our theory reduces to the description of an elastic medium with\nspatially fluctuating elastic moduli (heterogeneous elasticity theory), which\nexplains the occurrence of the boson-peak-related vibrational anomalies of\nglasses.\n", "  The shape of the building blocks plays a crucial role in directing\nself-assembly towards desired architectures. Out of the many different shapes,\nhelix has a unique position. Helical structures are ubiquitous in nature and a\nhelical shape is exhibited by the most important biopolymers like\npolynucleotides, polypeptides and polysaccharides as well as by cellular\norganelles like flagella. Helical particles can self-assemble into chiral\nsuperstructures, which may have a variety of applications, e.g. as photonic\n(meta)materials. However,a clear and definite understanding of these structures\nhas not been entirely achieved yet. We have recently undertaken an extensive\ninvestigation on the phase behaviour of hard helical particles, using numerical\nsimulations and classical density functional theory. Here we present a detailed\nstudy of the phase diagram of hard helices as a function of their morphology.\nThis includes a variety of liquid-crystal phases, with different degrees of\norientational and positional ordering. We show how, by tuning the helix\nparameters, it is possible to control the organization of the system. Starting\nfrom slender helices, whose phase behaviour is similar to that of rodlike\nparticles, the increase in curliness leads to the onset of azimuthal\ncorrelations between the particles and the formation of phases specific to\nhelices. These phases feature a new kind of screw order, of which there is\nexperimental evidence in colloidal suspensions of helical flagella.\n", "  Imaging changes in molecular geometries on their natural femtosecond\ntimescale with sub-Angstrom spatial precision is one of the critical challenges\nin the chemical sciences, since the nuclear geometry changes determine the\nmolecular reactivity. For photoexcited molecules, the nuclear dynamics\ndetermine the photoenergy conversion path and efficiency. We performed a\ngas-phase electron diffraction experiment using Megaelectronvolt (MeV)\nelectrons, where we captured the rotational wavepacket dynamics of\nnonadiabatically laser-aligned nitrogen molecules. We achieved an unprecedented\ncombination of 100 fs root-mean-squared (RMS) temporal resolution and\nsub-Angstrom (0.76 {\\AA}) spatial resolution that makes it possible to resolve\nthe position of the nuclei within the molecule. In addition, the diffraction\npatterns reveal the angular distribution of the molecules, which changes from\nprolate (aligned) to oblate (anti-aligned) in 300 fs. Our results demonstrate a\nsignificant and promising step towards making atomically resolved movies of\nmolecular reactions.\n", "  Fast outflows of gas, driven by the interaction between the radio-jets and\nISM of the host galaxy, are being observed in an increasing number of galaxies.\nOne such example is the nearby radio galaxy 3C293. In this paper we present\nIntegral Field Unit (IFU) observations taken with OASIS on the William Herschel\nTelescope (WHT), enabling us to map the spatial extent of the ionised gas\noutflows across the central regions of the galaxy. The jet-driven outflow in\n3C293 is detected along the inner radio lobes with a mass outflow rate ranging\nfrom $\\sim 0.05-0.17$ solar masses/yr (in ionised gas) and corresponding\nkinetic power of $\\sim 0.5-3.5\\times 10^{40}$ erg/s. Investigating the\nkinematics of the gas surrounding the radio jets (i.e. not directly associated\nwith the outflow), we find line-widths broader than $300$ km/s up to 5 kpc in\nthe radial direction from the nucleus (corresponding to 3.5 kpc in the\ndirection perpendicular to the radio axis at maximum extent). Along the axis of\nthe radio jet line-widths $>400$ km/s are detected out to 7 kpc from the\nnucleus and line-widths of $>500$ km/s at a distance of 12 kpc from the\nnucleus, indicating that the disturbed kinematics clearly extend well beyond\nthe high surface brightness radio structures of the jets. This is suggestive of\nthe cocoon structure seen in simulations of jet-ISM interaction and implies\nthat the radio jets are capable of disturbing the gas throughout the central\nregions of the host galaxy in all directions.\n", "  We study a level crossing between the QCD axion and an axion-like particle,\nfocusing on the recently found phenomenon, the axion roulette, where the\naxion-like particle runs along the potential, passing through many crests and\ntroughs, until it gets trapped in one of the potential minima. We perform\ndetailed numerical calculations to determine the parameter space where the\naxion roulette takes place, and as a result domain walls are likely formed. The\ndomain wall network without cosmic strings is practically stable, and it is\nnothing but a cosmological disaster. In a certain case, one can make domain\nwalls unstable and decay quickly by introducing an energy bias without spoiling\nthe Peccei-Quinn solution to the strong CP problem.\n", "  Resonant cavities are one of the basic building blocks in various disciplines\nof science and technology, with numerous applications ranging from abstract\ntheoretical modeling to everyday life devices. The eigenfrequencies of\nconventional cavities are a function of its geometry, and, thus, the size and\nshape of a resonant cavity is selected in order to operate at a specific\nfrequency. Here, we demonstrate theoretically the existence of\ngeometry-invariant resonant cavities, i.e., resonators whose eigenfrequency is\ninvariant with respect to geometrical deformations. This effect is obtained by\nexploiting the unusual properties of zero-index metamaterials, which enable\ndecoupling of the time and spatial field variations. This new class of\nresonators may inspire alternative design concepts, and it might lead to the\nfirst generation of deformable resonant devices.\n", "  Searches for circumstellar material around Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are\none of the most powerful tests of the nature of SN Ia progenitors, and radio\nobservations provide a particularly sensitive probe of this material. Here we\nreport radio observations for SNe Ia and their lower-luminosity thermonuclear\ncousins. We present the largest, most sensitive, and spectroscopically diverse\nstudy of prompt (delta t <~ 1 yr) radio observations of 85 thermonuclear SNe,\nincluding 25 obtained by our team with the unprecedented depth of the Karl G.\nJansky Very Large Array. With these observations, SN 2012cg joins SN 2011fe and\nSN 2014J as a SN Ia with remarkably deep radio limits and excellent temporal\ncoverage (six epochs, spanning 5--216 days after explosion, yielding Mdot/v_w\n<~ 5 x 10^-9 M_sun/yr / (100 km/s), assuming epsilon_B = 0.1 and epsilon_e =\n0.1).\n  All observations yield non-detections, placing strong constraints on the\npresence of circumstellar material. We present analytical models for the\ntemporal and spectral evolution of prompt radio emission from thermonuclear SNe\nas expected from interaction with either wind-stratified or uniform density\nmedia. These models allow us to constrain the progenitor mass loss rates, with\nlimits ranging from Mdot <~ 10^-9--10^-4 M_sun/yr, assuming a wind velocity\nv_w=100 km/s. We compare our radio constraints with measurements of Galactic\nsymbiotic binaries to conclude that <~10% of thermonuclear SNe have red giant\ncompanions.\n", "  In this work we extend, review and jointly discuss earlier experiments\nconducted by us in hyperaged geological glasses, either in Dominican amber (20\nmillion years old) or in Spanish amber from El Soplao (110 million years old).\nAfter characterization of their thermodynamic and elastic properties (using\nDifferential Scanning Calorimetry around the glass-transition temperature, and\nmeasuring mass density and sound velocity), their specific heat was measured at\nlow and very low temperatures. By directly comparing pristine amber samples\n(i.e. highly stabilized polymer glasses after aging for millions of years) to\nthe same samples after being totally or partially rejuvenated, we have found\nthat the two most prominent universal anomalous low-temperature properties of\nglasses, namely the tunnelling two-level systems and the so-called boson peak,\npersist essentially unchanged in both types of hyperaged geological glasses.\nTherefore, non-Debye low-energy excitations of glasses appear to be robust,\nintrinsic properties of non-crystalline solids which do not vanish by accessing\nto very deep states in the potential energy landscape.\n", "  A systematic investigation of even-even superheavy elements in the region of\nproton numbers $100 \\leq Z \\leq 130$ and in the region of neutron numbers from\nthe proton-drip line up to neutron number $N=196$ is presented. For this study\nwe use five most up-to-date covariant energy density functionals of different\ntypes, with a non-linear meson coupling, with density dependent meson\ncouplings, and with density-dependent zero-range interactions. Pairing\ncorrelations are treated within relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov (RHB) theory\nbased on an effective separable particle-particle interaction of finite range\nand deformation effects are taken into account. This allows us to assess the\nspread of theoretical predictions within the present covariant models for the\nbinding energies, deformation parameters, shell structures and $\\alpha$-decay\nhalf-lives. Contrary to the previous studies in covariant density functional\ntheory, it was found that the impact of $N=172$ spherical shell gap on the\nstructure of superheavy elements is very limited. Similar to non-relativistic\nfunctionals some covariant functionals predict the important role played by the\nspherical $N=184$ gap. For these functionals (NL3*, DD-ME2 and PC-PK1), there\nis a band of spherical nuclei along and near the $Z=120$ and $N=184$ lines.\nHowever, for other functionals (DD-PC1 and DD-ME$\\delta$) oblate shapes\ndominate at and in the vicinity of these lines. Available experimental data are\nin general described with comparable accuracy and do not allow to discriminate\nthese predictions.\n", "  A Gravitational Wave Background (GWB) is expected in the universe from the\nsuperposition of a large number of unresolved astrophysical sources and\nphenomena in the early universe. Each component of the background (e.g., from\nprimordial metric perturbations, binary neutron stars, milli-second pulsars\netc.) has its own spectral shape. Many ongoing experiments aim to probe GWB at\na variety of frequency bands. In the last two decades, using data from\nground-based laser interferometric gravitational wave (GW) observatories, upper\nlimits on GWB were placed in the frequency range of ~50-1000 Hz, considering\none spectral shape at a time. However, one strong component can significantly\nenhance the estimated strength of another component. Hence, estimation of the\namplitudes of the components with different spectral shapes should be done\njointly. Here we propose a method for \"component separation\" of a statistically\nisotropic background, that can, for the first time, jointly estimate the\namplitudes of many components and place upper limits. The method is rather\nstraightforward and needs negligible amount of computation. It utilises the\nlinear relationship between the measurements and the amplitudes of the actual\ncomponents, alleviating the need for a sampling based method, e.g., Markov\nChain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or matched filtering, which are computationally\nintensive and cumbersome in a multi-dimensional parameter space. Using this\nformalism we could also study how many independent components can be separated\nusing a given dataset from a network of current and upcoming ground based\ninterferometric detectors.\n", "  The time delay experienced by a light ray as it passes through a changing\ngravitational potential by a non-zero mass distribution along the line of sight\nis usually referred to as Shapiro delay. Shapiro delay has been extensively\nmeasured in the Solar system and in binary pulsars, enabling stringent tests of\ngeneral relativity as well as measurement of neutron star masses . However,\nShapiro delay is ubiquitous and experienced by all astrophysical messengers on\ntheir way from the source to the Earth. We calculate the \"one-way\" static\nShapiro delay for the first discovered millisecond pulsar PSR~B1937+21, by\nincluding the contributions from both the dark matter and baryonic matter\nbetween this pulsar and the Earth. We find a value of approximately 5 days (of\nwhich 4.74 days is from the dark matter and 0.22 days from the baryonic\nmatter). We also calculate the modulation of Shapiro delay from the motion of a\nsingle dark matter halo, and also evaluate the cumulative effects of the motion\nof matter distribution on the change in pulsar's period and its derivative. The\ntime-dependent effects are too small to be detected with the current timing\nnoise observed for this pulsar. Finally, we would like to emphasize that\nalthough the one-way Shapiro delay is mostly of academic interest for\nelectromagnetic astronomy, its ubiquity should not be forgotten in the era of\nmulti-messenger astronomy.\n", "  The rotating nuclei represent one of most interesting subjects for\ntheoretical and experimental studies. They open a new dimension of nuclear\nlandscape, namely, spin direction. Contrary to the majority of nuclear systems,\ntheir properties sensitively depend on time-odd mean fields and currents in\ndensity functional theories. Moreover, they show a considerable interplay of\ncollective and single-particle degrees of freedom. In this chapter, I discuss\nthe basic features of the description of rotating nuclei in one-dimensional\ncranking approximation of covariant density functional theory. The successes of\nthis approach to the description of rotating nuclei at low spin in pairing\nregime and at high spin in unpaired regime in wide range of deformations (from\nnormal to hyperdeformation) are illustrated. I also discuss the recent progress\nand open questions in our understanding of the role of proton-neutron pairing\nin rotating nuclei at $N\\approx Z$, the physics of band termination and other\nphenomena in rotating nuclei.\n", "  We report measurement of temperature dependence of phonon spectra in quasi\none-dimensional metal cyanides MCN (M=Cu, Ag and Au). Ab initio lattice\ndynamics calculations have been performed to interpret the phonon-spectra as\nwell as to understand the anamolous thermal expansion behavior in these\ncompounds. We bring out the differences in the phonon mode behavior to explain\nthe differences in the thermal expansion behavior among the three compounds.\nThe chain-sliding modes are found to contribute maximum to the negative thermal\nexpansion along c axis in the Cu and Ag compounds, while the same modes\ncontribute to positive thermal expansion in the Au compound. Several low energy\ntransverse modes lead to positive thermal expansion along a and b axis in all\nthe compounds. The calculated elastic constants and Born effective charges are\ncorrelated with the difference in nature of bonding among these metal cyanides.\n", "  Ferromagnetic insulating La$_2$CoMnO$_{6-\\epsilon}$ (LCMO) epitaxial thin\nfilms grown on top of SrTiO$_3$ (001) substrates presents a strong magnetic\nanisotropy favoring the out of plane orientation of the magnetization with a\nstrong anisotropy field ($\\sim 70$ kOe for film thickness of about 15 nm) and\nwith a coercive field of about 10 kOe. The anisotropy can be tuned by modifying\nthe oxygen content of the film which indirectly has two effects on the unit\ncell: i) change of the orientation of the LCMO crystallographic axis over the\nsubstrate (from c in-plane to c out-of-plane) and ii) shrinkage of the out of\nplane cell parameter, which implies increasing tensile strain of the films. In\ncontrast, LCMO films grown on (LaAlO$_3$)$_{0.3}$(Sr$_2$AlTaO$_6$)$_{0.7}$ and\nLaAlO$_3$ substrates (with a larger out-of-plane lattice parameter and\ncompressive stress) display in-plane magnetic anisotropy. Thus, we link the\nstrong magnetic anisotropy observed in La$_2$CoMnO$_{6-\\epsilon}$ to the\nrelation between in-plane and out-of-plane parameters and so to the film\nstress.\n", "  We investigate the resonant rotation of co-orbital bodies in eccentric and\nplanar orbits. We develop a simple analytical model to study the impact of the\neccentricity and orbital perturbations on the spin dynamics. This model is\nrelevant in the entire domain of horseshoe and tadpole orbit, for moderate\neccentricities. We show that there are three different families of spin-orbit\nresonances, one depending on the eccentricity, one depending on the orbital\nlibration frequency, and another depending on the pericenter's dynamics. We can\nestimate the width and the location of the different resonant islands in the\nphase space, predicting which are the more likely to capture the spin of the\nrotating body. In some regions of the phase space the resonant islands may\noverlap, giving rise to chaotic rotation.\n", "  We study the propagation of light beams through optical media with competing\nnonlocal nonlinearities. We demonstrate that the nonlocality of competing\nfocusing and defocusing nonlinearities gives rise to self-organization and\nstationary states with stable hexagonal intensity patterns, akin to transverse\ncrystals of light filaments. Signatures of this long-range ordering are shown\nto be observable in the propagation of light in optical waveguides and even in\nfree space. We consider a specific form of the nonlinear response that arises\nin atomic vapor upon proper light coupling. Yet, the general phenomenon of\nself-organization is a generic consequence of competing nonlocal\nnonlinearities, and may, hence, also be observed in other settings.\n", "  Compact stars consisting of massless quark matter and fermionic dark matter\nare studied by solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations for two fluids\nseparately. Dark matter is further investigated by incorporating\ninter-fermionic interactions among the dark matter particles. The properties of\nstars made of quark matter particles and self-interacting and free dark matter\nparticles are explored by obtaining their mass-radius relations. The regions of\nstability for such a compact star are determined and it is demonstrated that\nthe maximum stable total mass of such a star decreases approximately linearly\nwith increasing dark matter fraction.\n", "  We use the Landauer-B\\\"uttiker scattering theory for electronic transport to\ncalculate the current cross-correlations in a voltage-biased three-terminal\njunction with all superconducting leads. At low bias voltage, when charge\ntransport is due to coherent multiple Andreev reflections, we find large\ncross-correlations compared with their normal-state value. Furthermore,\ndepending on the parameters that characterize the properties of the scattering\nregion between the leads, the cross-correlations can reverse their sign with\nrespect to the case of non-interacting fermionic systems.\n", "  We measure the quantum capacitance and probe thus directly the electronic\ndensity of states of the high mobility, Dirac type of two-dimensional electron\nsystem, which forms on the surface of strained HgTe. Here we show that observed\nmagneto-capacitance oscillations probe, in contrast to magnetotransport,\nprimarily the top surface. Capacitance measurements constitute thus a powerful\ntool to probe only one topological surface and to reconstruct its Landau level\nspectrum for different positions of the Fermi energy.\n", "  We present a method to establish experimentally the relation between the\ntop-quark mass $m_t^{MC}$ as implemented in Monte-Carlo generators and the\nLagrangian mass parameter $m_t$ in a theoretically well-defined renormalization\nscheme. We propose a simultaneous fit of $m_t^{MC}$ and an observable sensitive\nto $m_t$, which does not rely on any prior assumptions about the relation\nbetween $m_t$ and $m_t^{MC}$. The measured observable is independent of\n$m_t^{MC}$ and can be used subsequently for a determination of $m_t$. The\nanalysis strategy is illustrated with examples for the extraction of $m_t$ from\ninclusive and differential cross sections for hadro-production of top-quarks.\n", "  Rotation is a directly-observable stellar property, and drives magnetic field\ngeneration and activity through a magnetic dynamo. Main sequence stars with\nmasses below approximately 0.35Msun (mid-to-late M dwarfs) are\nfully-convective, and are expected to have a different type of dynamo mechanism\nthan solar-type stars. Measurements of their rotation rates provide insights\ninto these mechanisms, but few rotation periods are available for these stars\nat field ages. Using photometry from the MEarth transit survey, we measure\nrotation periods for 387 nearby, mid-to-late M dwarfs in the Northern\nhemisphere, finding periods from 0.1 to 140 days. The typical detected rotator\nhas stable, sinusoidal photometric modulations at a semi-amplitude of 0.5 to\n1%. We find no period-amplitude relation for stars below 0.25Msun and an\nanti-correlation between period and amplitude for higher-mass M dwarfs. We\nhighlight the existence of older, slowly-rotating stars without H{\\alpha}\nemission that nevertheless have strong photometric variability. The Galactic\nkinematics of our sample is consistent with the local population of G and K\ndwarfs, and rotators have metallicities characteristic of the Solar\nNeighborhood. We use the W space velocities and established age-velocity\nrelations to estimate that stars with P<10 days are on average <2 Gyrs, and\nthat those with P>70 days are about 5 Gyrs. The period distribution is mass\ndependent: as the mass decreases, the slowest rotators at a given mass have\nlonger periods, and the fastest rotators have shorter periods. We find a lack\nof stars with intermediate rotation periods. [Abridged]\n", "  Within the hierarchy of inseparable quantum correlations,\nEinstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering is distinguished from both entanglement and\nBell nonlocality by its asymmetry -- there exist conditions where the steering\nphenomenon changes from being observable to not observable, simply by\nexchanging the role of the two measuring parties. Whilst this one-way steering\nfeature has been previously demonstrated for the restricted class of Gaussian\nmeasurements, for the general case of positive-operator-valued measures even\nits theoretical existence has only recently been settled. Here, we prove, and\nthen experimentally observe, the one-way steerability of an experimentally\npractical class of entangled states in this general setting. As well as its\nfoundational significance, the demonstration of fundamentally asymmetric\nnonlocality also has practical implications for the distribution of the trust\nin quantum communication networks.\n", "  We study the effect of varying the mass and volume fraction of a suspension\nof rigid spheres dispersed in a turbulent channel flow. We performed several\nDirect Numerical Simulations using an Immersed Boundary Method for finite-size\nparticles changing the solid to fluid density ratio, the mass fraction and the\nvolume fraction. We find that varying the density ratio between 1 and 10 at\nconstant volume fraction does not alter the flow statistics as much as when\nvarying the volume fraction at constant and at constant mass fraction.\nInterestingly, the increase in overall drag found when varying the volume\nfraction is considerably higher than that obtained for increasing density\nratios at same volume fraction. The main effect at density ratios of the order\nof 10 is a strong shear-induced migration towards the centerline of the\nchannel. When the density ratio is further increased up to 1000 the particle\ndynamics decouple from that of the fluid. The solid phase behaves as a dense\ngas and the fluid and solid phase statistics drastically change. In this\nregime, the collision rate is high and dominated by the normal relative\nvelocity among particles.\n", "  Processing and distributing quantum information using photons through\nfibre-optic or free-space links is essential for building future quantum\nnetworks. The scalability needed for such networks can be achieved by employing\nphotonic quantum states that are multiplexed into time and/or frequency, and\nlight-matter interfaces that are able to store and process such states with\nlarge time-bandwidth product and multimode capacities. Despite important\nprogress in developing such devices, the demonstration of these capabilities\nusing non-classical light remains challenging. Employing the atomic frequency\ncomb quantum memory protocol in a cryogenically cooled erbium-doped optical\nfibre, we report the quantum storage of heralded single photons at a\ntelecom-wavelength (1.53 {\\mu}m) with a time-bandwidth product approaching 800.\nFurthermore we demonstrate frequency-multimode storage as well as memory-based\nspectral-temporal photon manipulation. Notably, our demonstrations rely on\nfully integrated quantum technologies operating at telecommunication\nwavelengths, i.e. a fibre-pigtailed nonlinear waveguide for the generation of\nheralded single photons, an erbium-doped fibre for photon storage and\nmanipulation, and fibre interfaced superconducting nanowire devices for\nefficient single photon detection. With improved storage efficiency, our\nlight-matter interface may become a useful tool in future quantum networks.\n", "  Quantum antiferromagnets have proven to be some of the cleanest realizations\navailable for theoretical, numerical, and experimental studies of quantum\nfluctuation effects. At finite temperatures, however, the additional effects of\nthermal fluctuations in the restricted phase space of a low-dimensional system\nhave received much less attention, particularly the situation in frustrated\nquantum magnets, where the excitations may be complex collective (bound or even\nfractionalized) modes. We investigate this problem by studying the\nthermodynamic properties of the frustrated two-leg S=1/2 spin ladder, with\nparticular emphasis on the fully frustrated case. We present numerical results\nfor the magnetic specific heat and susceptibility, obtained from exact\ndiagonalization and quantum Monte Carlo studies, which we show can be rendered\nfree of the sign problem even in a strongly frustrated system and which allow\nus to reach unprecedented sizes of L=200 ladder rungs. We find that frustration\neffects cause an unconventional evolution of the thermodynamic response across\nthe full parameter regime of the model. However, close to the first-order\ntransition they cause a highly anomalous reduction in temperature scales with\nno concomitant changes in the gap; the specific heat shows a very narrow peak\nat very low energies and the susceptibility rises abruptly at extremely low\ntemperatures. Unusually, the two quantities have different gaps over an\nextended region of the parameter space. We demonstrate that these results\nreflect the presence of large numbers of multi-particle bound-state\nexcitations, whose energies fall below the one-triplon gap in the transition\nregion.\n", "  Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering describes the ability of one observer\nto nonlocally \"steer\" the other observer's state through local measurements. It\nexhibits a unique asymmetric property, i.e., the steerability of one observer\nto steer the other's state could be different from each other, which can even\nlead to a one-way EPR steering, i.e., only one observer obtains the\nsteerability in the two-observer case. This property is inherently different\nfrom the symmetric concepts of entanglement and Bell nonlocality and has been\nattracted increasing interests. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the\nasymmetric EPR steering for a class of two-qubit states in the case of two\nmeasurement settings. We propose a practical method to quantify the\nsteerability. We then provide a necessary and sufficient condition for EPR\nsteering and clearly show the case of one-way EPR steering. Our work provides a\nnew insight on the fundamental asymmetry of quantum nonlocality and would find\npotential application in asymmetric quantum information processing.\n", "  A method is introduced which allows to measure normal-ordered moments of the\ndisplaced photon-number operator up to high orders. It is based on unbalanced\nhomodyne correlation measurements, the local oscillator being replaced by a\ndisplaced dephased laser. The measured moments yield a simple approximation of\nthe full quantum state, which is obtained without the need of photon-number\nresolution. Quantum properties of light are efficiently certified through the\ndirect detection of normal-ordered observables, which is illustrated for a\nweakly squeezed vacuum and a single-photon-added thermal state.\n", "  Self-assembly is ubiquitous in nature, particularly in biology, where it\nunderlies the formation of protein quaternary structure and protein\naggregation. Quaternary structure assembles deterministically and performs a\nwide range of important functions in the cell, whereas protein aggregation is\nthe hallmark of a number of diseases and represents a non-deterministic\nself-assembly process. Here we build on previous work on a lattice model of\ndeterministic self-assembly to investigate non-deterministic self-assembly of\nsingle lattice tiles and mixtures of two tiles at varying relative\nconcentrations. Despite limiting the simplicity of the model to two interface\ntypes, which results in 13 topologically distinct single tiles and 106\ntopologically distinct sets of two tiles, we observe a wide variety of\nconcentration-dependent behaviours. Several two-tile sets display critical\nbehaviours in form of a sharp transition from bound to unbound structures as\nthe relative concentration of one tile to another increases. Other sets exhibit\ngradual monotonic changes in structural density, or non-monotonic changes,\nwhile again others show no concentration dependence at all. We catalogue this\nextensive range of behaviours and present a model that provides a reasonably\ngood estimate of the critical concentrations for a subset of the critical\ntransitions. In addition we show that the structures resulting from these tile\nsets are fractal, with one of two different fractal dimensions.\n", "  We study very-high rate spherically symmetric accretion flows onto a massive\nblack hole (BH; 10^2 < M_BH < 10^6 Msun) embedded in a dense gas cloud with a\nlow abundance of metals, performing one-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations\nwhich include multi-frequency radiation transfer and non-equilibrium primordial\nchemistry. We find that rapid gas supply from the Bondi radius at a\nhyper-Eddington rate can occur without being impeded by radiation feedback when\n(n/10^5 cm^-3) > (M_BH/10^4Msun)^{-1}(T/10^4 K)^{3/2}, where n and T are the\ndensity and temperature of ambient gas outside of the Bondi radius. The\nresulting accretion rate in this regime is steady, and larger than 3000 times\nthe Eddington rate. At lower Bondi rates, the accretion is episodic due to\nradiative feedback and the average rate is limited below the Eddington rate.\nFor the hyper-Eddington case, the steady solution consists of two parts: a\nradiation-dominated central core, where photon trapping due to electron\nscattering is important, and an accreting envelope which follows a Bondi\nprofile with T~8000 K. When the emergent luminosity is limited below the\nEddington luminosity because of photon trapping, radiation from the central\nregion does not affect the gas dynamics at larger scales. We apply our result\nto the rapid formation of massive BHs in protogalaxies with a virial\ntemperature of T_vir> 10^4 K. Once a seed BH forms at the center of the galaxy,\nit can grow up to a maximum ~10^5 (T_vir/10^4 K) Msun via gas accretion\nindependent of the initial BH mass. Finally, we discuss possible observational\nsignatures of rapidly accreting BHs with/without allowance for dust. We suggest\nthat these systems could explain Lya emitters without X-rays and luminous\ninfrared sources with hot dust emission, respectively.\n", "  The cut-off regime of high-order harmonic generation (HHG) by atoms in an\nintense laser field is studied numerically and analytically. We find that the\ncut-off regime is characterized by equal dephasing between the successive\nharmonics. The change of the harmonic phase-locking when HHG evolves from the\ncut-off to the plateau regime determines the optimal bandwidth of the spectral\nregion which should be used for attosecond pulse generation via amplitude\ngating technique. The cut-off regime is also characterized by a linear\ndependence of the harmonic phase on the fundamental intensity. The\nproportionality coefficient grows as the cube of the fundamental wavelength,\nthus this dependence becomes very important for the HHG by mid-infrared fields.\nMoreover, for every high harmonic there is a {\\it range} of laser intensities\nproviding the generation in the cut-off regime and the atomic response\nmagnitude in this regime can be greater than that in the plateau regime. Thus\nthe cut-off regime substantially contributes to the harmonic energy emitted\nunder typical experimental conditions where the laser intensity varies in time\nand space.\n", "  We determine the general form of the solutions of the five-dimensional vacuum\nEinstein equations with cosmological constant for which (i) the Weyl tensor is\neverywhere type II or more special in the null alignment classification of\nColey et al., and (ii) the $3 \\times 3$ matrix encoding the expansion, shear\nand twist of the aligned null direction has rank 2. The dependence of the\nsolution on 2 coordinates is determined explicitly, so the Einstein equation\nreduces to PDEs in the 3 remaining coordinates, just as for four-dimensional\nalgebraically special solutions. The solutions fall into several families. One\nof these consists of warped products of four-dimensional algebraically special\nsolutions. The others are new.\n", "  Strong gravitational lensing is a powerful tool for resolving the high energy\nuniverse. We combine the temporal resolution of Fermi-LAT, the angular\nresolution of radio telescopes, and the independently and precisely known\nHubble constant from Planck, to resolve the spatial origin of gamma-ray flares\nin the strongly lensed source B2 0218+35. The lensing model achieves 1\nmilliarcsecond spatial resolution of the source at gamma-ray energies. The data\nimply that the gamma-ray flaring sites are separate from the radio core: the\nbright gamma-ray flare (MJD: 56160 - 56280) occurred $51\\pm8$ pc from the 15\nGHz radio core, toward the central engine. This displacement is significant at\nthe $\\sim3\\sigma$ level, and is limited primarily by the precision of the\nHubble constant. B2 0218+35 is the first source where the position of the\ngamma-ray emitting region relative to the radio core can be resolved. We\ndiscuss the potential of an ensemble of strongly lensed high energy sources for\nelucidating the physics of distant variable sources based on data from Chandra\nand SKA.\n", "  Recently the OPE coefficients of the 3D Ising model universality class have\nbeen calculated by studying the two-point functions perturbed from the critical\npoint with a relevant field. We show that this method can be applied also when\nthe perturbation is performed with a relevant field coupled to a non uniform\npotential acting as a trap. This setting is described by the trap size scaling\nansatz, that can be combined with the general framework of the conformal\nperturbation in order to write down the correlators $<\\sigma (\\mathbf\n{r})\\sigma(0)>$, $<\\sigma (\\mathbf{r})\\epsilon(0)>$ and $<\\epsilon (\\mathbf\n{r})\\epsilon(0)>$, from which the OPE coefficients can be estimated. We find\n$C^{\\sigma}_{\\sigma\\epsilon}= 1.051(3)$ , in agreement with the results already\nknown in the literature, and $C^{\\epsilon}_{\\epsilon\\epsilon}= 1.32 (15)$ ,\nconfirming and improving the previous estimate obtained in the uniform\nperturbation case.\n", "  We use the phase plane analysis technique of Madsen and Ellis to consider a\nuniverse with a true cosmological constant as well as a cosmological \"constant\"\nthat is decaying. Time symmetric dynamics for the inflationary era allows\neternally bouncing models to occur. Allowing for scalar field dynamic\nevolution, we find that if dark energy decays in the future, chaotic cyclic\nuniverses exist provided the spatial curvature is positive. This is\nparticularly interesting in light of current observations which do not yet rule\nout either closed universes or possible evolution of the cosmological constant.\nWe present only a proof of principle, with no definite claim on the physical\nmechanism required for the present dark energy to decay.\n", "  We extend the link between Einstein Sasakian manifolds and Killing spinors to\na class of $\\eta$-Einstein Sasakian manifolds, both in Riemannian and\nLorentzian settings, characterising them in terms of generalised Killing\nspinors. We propose a definition of supersymmetric M-theory backgrounds on such\na geometry and find a new class of such backgrounds, extending previous work of\nHaupt, Lukas and Stelle.\n", "  We analyse the correlation properties of light in non-linear wave-guides and\ntransmission lines, predict the position-momentum realization of EPR paradox\nfor photon pairs in Kerr-type non-linear photonic circuits, and we show how\ntwo-photon entangled states can be generated and detected.\n", "  The late stages of terrestrial planet formation are dominated by giant\nimpacts that collectively influence the growth, composition and habitability of\nany planets that form. Hitherto, numerical models designed to explore these\nlate stage collisions have been limited by assuming that all collisions lead to\nperfect accretion, and many of these studies lack the large number of\nrealizations needed to account for the chaotic nature of N-body systems. We\nimprove on these limitations by performing 280 simulations of planet formation\naround a Sun-like star, half of which used an N-body algorithm that has\nrecently been modified to include fragmentation and hit-and-run (bouncing)\ncollisions. We find that when fragmentation is included, the final planets\nformed are comparable in terms of mass and number, however their collision\nhistories differ significantly and the accretion time approximately doubles. We\nexplored impacts onto Earth-like planets which we parameterized in terms of\ntheir specific impact energies. Only 15 of our 164 Earth-analogs experienced an\nimpact that was energetic enough to strip an entire atmosphere. To strip about\nhalf of an atmosphere requires energies comparable to recent models of the\nMoon-forming giant impact. Almost all Earth-analogs received at least one\nimpact that met this criteria during the 2 Gyr simulations and the median was\nthree giant impacts. The median time of the final giant impact was 43 Myr after\nthe start of the simulations, leading us to conclude that the time-frame of the\nMoon-forming impact is typical amongst planetary systems around Sun-like stars.\n", "  We investigate the necessary methodology to optimally measure the baryon\nacoustic oscillation (BAO) signal, from voids based on galaxy redshift\ncatalogues. To this end, we study the dependency of the BAO signal on the\npopulation of voids classified by their sizes. We find for the first time the\ncharacteristic features of the correlation function of voids including the\nfirst robust detection of BAOs in mock galaxy catalogues. These show an\nanti-correlation around the scale corresponding to the smallest size of voids\nin the sample (the void exclusion effect), and dips at both sides of the BAO\npeak, which can be used to determine the significance of the BAO signal without\nany priori model. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that there is a scale\ndependent bias for different populations of voids depending on the radius, with\nthe peculiar property that the void population with the largest BAO\nsignificance corresponds to tracers with approximately zero bias on the largest\nscales. We further investigate the methodology on an additional set of 1,000\nrealistic mock galaxy catalogues reproducing the SDSS-III/BOSS CMASS DR11 data,\nto control the impact of sky mask and radial selection function. Our solution\nis based on generating voids from randoms including the same survey geometry\nand completeness, and a post-processing cleaning procedure in the holes and at\nthe boundaries of the survey. The methodology and optimal selection of void\npopulations validated in this work have been used to perform the first BAO\ndetection from voids in observations, presented in a companion paper.\n", "  We propose a new Dark Energy parametrization based on the dynamics of a\nscalar field. We use an equation of state w=(x-1)/(x+1), with x=E_k/V, the\nratio of kinetic energy E_k=\\dotphi^2/2 and potential V. The equation of motion\ngives x=(L/6)(V/3H^2) and has a solution x=([(1+y)^2+2 L/3]^{1/2}-(1+y))/2\nwhere y\\equiv \\rmm/V and L= (V'/V)^2 (1+q)^2, q=\\ddotphi/V'. The resulting EoS\nis w=[6+ L- 6 \\sqrt((1+y)^2+2L/3)]/(L+6y). Since the universe is accelerating\nat present time we use the slow roll approximation in which case we have |q|<<\n1 and L\\simeq (V'/V)^2. However, the derivation of w is exact and has no\napproximation. By choosing an appropriate ansatz for L we obtain a wide class\nof behavior for the evolution of Dark Energy without the need to specify the\npotential V. The EoS w can either grow and later decrease, or other way around,\nas a function of redshift and it is constraint between -1\\leq w\\leq 1 as for\nany canonical scalar field with only gravitational interaction. To determine\nthe dynamics of Dark Energy we calculate the background evolution and its\nperturbations, since they are important to discriminate between different DE\nmodels. Our parametrization follows closely the dynamics of a scalar field\nscalar fields and the function L allow us to connect it with the potential\nV(phi) of the scalar field phi.\n", "  Motivated by recent progress in electron quantum optics, we revisit the\nquestion of single-electron entanglement, specifically whether the state of a\nsingle electron in a superposition of two separate spatial modes should be\nconsidered entangled. We first discuss a gedanken experiment with\nsingle-electron sources and detectors, and demonstrate deterministic (i. e.\nwithout post-selection) Bell inequality violation. This implies that the\nsingle-electron state is indeed entangled and, furthermore, nonlocal. We then\npresent an experimental scheme where single-electron entanglement can be\nobserved via measurements of the average currents and zero-frequency current\ncross-correlators in an electronic Hanbury Brown-Twiss interferometer driven by\nLorentzian voltage pulses. We show that single-electron entanglement is\ndetectable under realistic operating conditions. Our work settles the question\nof single-electron entanglement and opens promising perspectives for future\nexperiments.\n", "  Spectral functions of the pseudoscalar $D$ meson in the nuclear medium are\nanalyzed using QCD sum rules and the maximum entropy method. This approach\nenables us to extract the spectral functions without any phenomenological\nassumption, and thus to visualize in-medium modification of the spectral\nfunctions directly. It is found that the reduction of the chiral condensates of\ndimension 3 and 5 causes the masses of both $D^+$ and $D^-$ mesons to grow\ngradually at finite density. Additionally, we construct\ncharge-conjugate-projected sum rules and find a $D^+$-$D^-$ mass splitting of\nabout -15 MeV at nuclear saturation density.\n", "  Electric noise from metallic surfaces is a major obstacle towards quantum\napplications with trapped ions due to motional heating of the ions. Here, we\ndiscuss how the same noise source can also lead to pure dephasing of motional\nquantum states. The mechanism is particularly relevant at small ion-surface\ndistances, thus imposing a new constraint on trap miniaturization. By means of\na free induction decay experiment, we measure the dephasing time of the motion\nof a single ion trapped 50~$\\mu$m above a Cu-Al surface. From the dephasing\ntimes we extract the integrated noise below the secular frequency of the ion.\nWe find that none of the most commonly discussed surface noise models for ion\ntraps describes both, the observed heating as well as the measured dephasing,\nsatisfactorily. Thus, our measurements provide a benchmark for future models\nfor the electric noise emitted by metallic surfaces.\n", "  We comment on the recent paper \"Note on the perihelion/periastron advance due\nto cosmological constant\" by H. Arakida (Int. J. Theor. Phys. 52 (2013)\n1408-1414, arXiv:1212.6289) and provide simple derivations both of the main\nresult of this paper and of the Adkins-McDonnell's precession formula, on which\nthis main result is based.\n", "  The novel effect of self-excitation of surface plasmons (SESP) in a plasmonic\nnanocavity is predicted and its theory is developed from first principles. It\nis assumed that the cavity is formed by a nanogap between two metals and\ncontains polarizable inclusions. Basing on the dyadic Green's function of the\nstructure, the equations for the field in the cavity are investigated. It is\nshown that under certain conditions the field becomes unstable that leads to\nits self-excitation. The threshold criterion for self-excitation as well as the\nfrequency of self-oscillation are derived in an analytical form. The SESP\neffect is explained in terms of a positive feedback for the polarization of\ninclusions provided by the field reflected from the cavity walls. Such a\nmechanism does not imply stimulated emission that distinguishes it from SPASER\nor plasmon laser.\n", "  Energy relaxation in light-harvesting complexes has been extensively studied\nby various ultrafast spectroscopic techniques, the fastest processes being in\nthe sub-100 fs range. At the same time much slower dynamics have been observed\nin individual complexes by single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy (SMS). In\nthis work we employ a pump-probe type SMS technique to observe the ultrafast\nenergy relaxation in single light-harvesting complexes LH2 of purple bacteria.\nAfter excitation at 800 nm, the measured relaxation time distribution of\nmultiple complexes has a peak at 95 fs and is asymmetric, with a tail at slower\nrelaxation times. When tuning the excitation wavelength, the distribution\nchanges in both its shape and position. The observed behaviour agrees with what\nis to be expected from the LH2 excited states structure. As we show by a\nRedfield theory calculation of the relaxation times, the distribution shape\ncorresponds to the expected effect of Gaussian disorder of the pigment\ntransition energies. By repeatedly measuring few individual complexes for\nminutes, we find that complexes sample the relaxation time distribution on a\ntimescale of seconds. Furthermore, by comparing the distribution from three\nlong-lived complexes with the whole ensemble, we demonstrate that the ensemble\ncan be considered ergodic. Our findings thus agree with the commonly used\nnotion of an ensemble of identical LH2 complexes experiencing slow random\nfluctuations.\n", "  In this assignment we will present a reconstruction scheme between f(R)\ngravity with ordinary and entropy corrected (m,n)-type holographic dark energy.\nThe correspondence is established and expressions for the reconstructed f(R)\nmodels are determined. To study the evolution of the reconstructed models plots\nare generated. The stability of the calculated models are also investigated\nusing the squared speed of sound in the background of the reconstructed\ngravities.\n", "  Graphene-based nanostructures exhibit a vast range of exciting electronic\nproperties that are absent in extended graphene. For example, quantum\nconfinement in carbon nanotubes and armchair graphene nanoribbons (AGNRs) leads\nto the opening of substantial electronic band gaps that are directly linked to\ntheir structural boundary conditions. Even more intriguing are nanostructures\nwith zigzag edges, which are expected to host spin-polarized electronic edge\nstates and can thus serve as key elements for graphene-based spintronics. The\nmost prominent example is zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) for which the\nedge states are predicted to couple ferromagnetically along the edge and\nantiferromagnetically between them. So far, a direct observation of the\nspin-polarized edge states for specifically designed and controlled zigzag edge\ntopologies has not been achieved. This is mainly due to the limited precision\nof current top-down approaches, which results in poorly defined edge\nstructures. Bottom-up fabrication approaches, on the other hand, were so far\nonly successfully applied to the growth of AGNRs and related structures. Here,\nwe describe the successful bottom-up synthesis of ZGNRs, which are fabricated\nby the surface-assisted colligation and cyclodehydrogenation of specifically\ndesigned precursor monomers including carbon groups that yield atomically\nprecise zigzag edges. Using scanning tunnelling spectroscopy we prove the\nexistence of edge-localized states with large energy splittings. We expect that\nthe availability of ZGNRs will finally allow the characterization of their\npredicted spin-related properties such as spin confinement and filtering, and\nultimately add the spin degree of freedom to graphene-based circuitry.\n", "  We argue that the Smarr Formula for black holes can be expressed in terms of\na Noether charge surface integral plus a suitable volume integral, for any\ngravitational theory. The integrals can be constructed as an application of\nWald's formalism. We apply this formalism to compute the mass and the Smarr\nFormula for static Lovelock black holes. Finally, we propose a new prescription\nfor Wald's entropy in the case of Lovelock black holes, which takes into\naccount topological contributions to the entropy functional.\n", "  We study the dust evolution in the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A. We follow\nthe processing of dust grains that formed in the Type II-b supernova by\nmodelling the sputtering of grains. The dust is located in dense ejecta clumps\ncrossed by the reverse shock. Further sputtering in the inter-clump medium once\nthe clumps are disrupted by the reverse shock is investigated. The dust\nevolution in the dense ejecta clumps of Type II-P supernovae and their remnants\nis also studied. We study oxygen-rich clumps that describe the ejecta oxygen\ncore, and carbon-rich clumps that correspond to the outermost carbon-rich\nejecta zone. We consider the dust components formed in the supernova, several\nreverse shock velocities and inter-clump gas temperatures, and derive dust\ngrain size distributions and masses as a function of time. We find that\nnon-thermal sputtering in clumps is important and accounts for reducing the\ngrain population by ~ 40% to 80% in mass, depending on the clump gas\nover-density and the grain type and size. A Type II-b supernova forms small\ngrains that are sputtered within clumps and in the inter-clump medium. For Cas\nA, silicate grains do not survive thermal sputtering in the inter-clump medium.\nOur derived masses of currently processed silicate, alumina and carbon grains\nin Cas A agree well with values derived from observations. Grains produced by\nType II-P supernovae better survive the remnant phase. For dense ejecta clumps,\ndust survival efficiencies range between 42% and 98% in mass. For the SN1987A\nmodel, the derived surviving dust mass is in the range ~ 0.06-0.13 Msolar. This\ntype of dense supernovae may efficiently provide galaxies with dust.\nSpecifically, silicate grains over 0.1 micron and other grains over 0,05 micron\nsurvive thermal sputtering in the remnant. Therefore, pre-solar grains of\nsupernova origin possibly form in the dense ejecta clumps of Type II-P\nsupernovae.\n", "  In the firewall proposal, it is assumed that the firewall lies near the event\nhorizon and should not be observable except by infalling observers, who are\npresumably terminated at the firewall. However, if the firewall is located near\nwhere the horizon would have been, based on the spacetime evolution up to that\ntime, later quantum fluctuations of the Hawking emission rate can cause the\n\"teleological\" event horizon to have migrated to the inside of the firewall\nlocation, rendering the firewall naked. In principle, the firewall can be\narbitrarily far outside the horizon. This casts doubt about the notion that\nfirewalls are the \"most conservative\" solution to the information loss paradox.\n", "  We propose a new scenario of Affleck-Dine baryogenesis where a flat direction\nin the MSSM generates B-L asymmetry just after the end of inflation. The\nresulting amount of baryon asymmetry is independent of low-energy\nsupersymmetric models but is dependent on inflation models. We consider the\nhybrid and chaotic inflation models and find that reheating temperature is\nrequired to be higher than that in the conventional scenario of Affleck-Dine\nbaryogenesis. In particular, non-thermal gravitino-overproduction problem is\nnaturally avoided in the hybrid inflation model. Our results imply that\nAffleck-Dine baryogenesis can be realized in a broader range of supersymmetry\nand inflation models than expected in the literature.\n", "  In this paper, we give formulas for the swimming of simplified\ntwo-dimensional bodies in complex fluids using the reciprocal theorem. By way\nof these formulas we calculate the swimming velocity due to small-amplitude\ndeformations on the simplest of these bodies, a two-dimensional sheet, to\nexplore general conditions on the swimming gait under which the sheet may move\nfaster, or slower, in a viscoelastic fluid compared to a Newtonian fluid. We\nshow that in general, for small amplitude deformations, a speed increase can\nonly be realized by multiple deformation modes in contrast to slip flows.\nAdditionally, we show that a change in swimming speed is directly due to a\nchange in thrust generated by the swimmer.\n", "  We report the findings of fractional topological states in one-dimensional\nperiodically modulated quantum spin chains with up to third neighbor\ninteractions. By exact numerical studies, we demonstrate the existence of\ntopologically nontrivial degenerate ground states at some specific\nmagnetizations, which can be characterized by the nonzero-integer total Chern\nnumbers of the degenerate ground states and the emergence of nontrivial edge\nstates under open boundary conditions. We find that the low-energy excitations\nobey bosonic $\\nu=1/2$ fractional statistics for the spin-$1/2$ system and\n$\\nu=1$ non-Abelian statistics for the spin-$1$ system, respectively. The\ndiscovered fractional quantum states provide another route to the theoretical\nexploration of fractional quantum states in correlated spin systems.\n", "  The one-dimensional extended t-V model of fermions on a lattice is a model\nwith repulsive interactions of finite range that exhibits a transition between\na Luttinger liquid conducting phase and a Mott insulating phase. It is known\nthat by tailoring the potential energy of the insulating system, one can force\na phase transition into another insulating phase. We show how to construct all\npossible charge-density-wave phases of the system at low critical densities in\nthe atomic limit. Higher critical densities are investigated by a brute-force\nanalysis of the possible finite unit cells of the Fock states.\n", "  We investigate evolution of clumpy galaxies with the Hubble Space Telescope\n(HST) samples of ~17,000 photo-z and Lyman break galaxies at z~0-8. We detect\nclumpy galaxies with off-center clumps in a self-consistent algorithm that is\nwell tested with previous study results, and measure the number fraction of\nclumpy galaxies at the rest-frame UV, f_clumpy^UV. We identify an evolutionary\ntrend of f_clumpy^UV over z~0-8 for the first time: f_clumpy^UV increases from\nz~8 to z~1-3 and subsequently decreases from z~1 to z~0, which follows the\ntrend of Madau-Lilly plot. A low average Sersic index of n~1 is found in the\nunderlining components of our clumpy galaxies at z~0-2, indicating that typical\nclumpy galaxies have disk-like surface brightness profiles. Our f_clumpy^UV\nvalues correlate with physical quantities related to star formation activities\nfor star-forming galaxies at z~0-7. We find that clump colors tend to be red at\na small galactocentric distance for massive galaxies with log(M_*/M_sun)>~11.\nAll of these results are consistent with a picture that a majority of clumps\nform in the violent disk instability and migrate into the galactic centers.\n", "  Using analytical expressions for the magnetization textures of thin\nsubmicron-sized magnetic cylinders in vortex state, we derive closed-form\nalgebraic expressions for the ensuing small-angle neutron scattering (SANS)\ncross sections. Specifically, for the perpendicular and parallel scattering\ngeometries, we have computed the magnetic SANS cross sections for the case of\nsmall vortex-center displacements without formation of magnetic charges on the\nside faces of the cylinder. The results represent a significant qualitative and\nquantitative step forward in SANS-data analysis on isolated magnetic\nnanoparticle systems, which are commonly assumed to be homogeneously or\nstepwise-homogeneously magnetized. We suggest a way to extract the fine details\nof the magnetic vortex structure during the magnetization process from the SANS\nmeasurements in order to help resolving the long standing question of the\nmagnetic vortex displacement mode.\n", "  The Telescope Array (TA) experiment is the largest detector to observe\nultra-high-energy cosmic rays in the northern hemisphere. The fluorescence\ndetectors at southern two stations of TA are newly constructed and have now\ncompleted seven years of steady operation. One advantage of monocular analysis\nof the fluorescence detectors is a lower energy threshold for cosmic rays than\nthat of other techniques like stereoscopic observations or coincidences with\nthe surface detector array, allowing the measurement of an energy spectrum\ncovering three orders of magnitude in energy. Analyzing data collected during\nthose seven years, we report the energy spectrum of cosmic rays covering a\nbroad range of energies above 10$^{17.2}$ eV measured by the fluorescence\ndetectors and a comparison with previously published results.\n", "  The detection of five new fast radio bursts (FRBs) found in the High Time\nResolution Universe high latitude survey is presented. The rate implied is\n6$^{+4}_{-3}\\times~10^3$ (95%) FRBs sky$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$ above a fluence of\nbetween 0.13 and 5.9 Jy ms for FRBs between 0.128 and 262 ms in duration. One\nof these FRBs has a clear two-component profile, each component is similar to\nthe known population of single component FRBs and are separated by 2.4(4) ms.\nAll the FRB components appear to be unresolved following deconvolution with a\nscattering tail and accounting for intra-channel smearing. The two-component\nFRB also has the highest dispersion measure (1629 pc cm$^{-3}$) of any FRB\nto-date. Many of the proposed models to explain FRBs use a single high energy\nevent involving compact objects (such as neutron star mergers) and therefore\ncannot easily explain a two-component FRB. Models that are based on extreme\nversions of flaring, pulsing or orbital events however could produce multiple\ncomponent profiles. The compatibility of these models and the FRB rate implied\nby these detections is discussed.\n", "  We present clustering analysis results from 10,381 Lyman break galaxies\n(LBGs) at z~ 4-7, identified in the Hubble legacy deep imaging and new\ncomplimentary large-area Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam data. We measure the angular\ncorrelation functions (ACFs) of these LBGs at z~4, 5, 6, and 7, and fit these\nmeasurements using halo occupation distribution (HOD) models that provide an\nestimate of halo masses, M_h~(1-20)x10^11 Msun. Our M_h estimates agree with\nthose obtained by previous clustering studies in a UV-magnitude vs. M_h plane,\nand allow us to calculate stellar-to-halo mass ratios (SHMRs) of LBGs. By\ncomparison with the z~0 SHMR, we identify evolution of the SHMR from z~0 to\nz~4, and z~4 to z~7 at the >98% confidence levels. The SHMR decreases by a\nfactor of ~2 from z~0 to 4, and increases by a factor of ~4 from z~4 to 7. We\ncompare our SHMRs with results of a hydrodynamic simulation and a semi-analytic\nmodel, and find that these theoretical studies do not predict the SHMR increase\nfrom z~4 to 7. We obtain the baryon conversion efficiency (BCE) of LBGs at z~4,\nand find that the BCE increases with increasing dark matter halo mass. Finally,\nwe compare our clustering+HOD estimates with results from abundance matching\ntechniques, and conclude that the M_h estimates of the clustering+HOD analyses\nagree with those of the simple abundance matching within a factor of 3, and\nthat the agreement improves when using more sophisticated abundance matching\ntechniques that include subhalos, incompleteness, and/or evolution in the star\nformation and stellar mass functions.\n", "  A superconducting transition temperature Tc as high as 100 K was recently\ndiscovered in 1 monolayer (1ML) FeSe grown on SrTiO3 (STO). The discovery\nimmediately ignited efforts to identify the mechanism for the dramatically\nenhanced Tc from its bulk value of 7 K. Currently, there are two main views on\nthe origin of the enhanced Tc; in the first view, the enhancement comes from an\ninterfacial effect while in the other it is from excess electrons with strong\ncorrelation strength. The issue is controversial and there are evidences that\nsupport each view. Finding the origin of the Tc enhancement could be the key to\nachieving even higher Tc and to identifying the microscopic mechanism for the\nsuperconductivity in iron-based materials. Here, we report the observation of\n20 K superconductivity in the electron doped surface layer of FeSe. The\nelectronic state of the surface layer possesses all the key spectroscopic\naspects of the 1ML FeSe on STO. Without any interface effect, the surface layer\nstate is found to have a moderate Tc of 20 K with a smaller gap opening of 4\nmeV. Our results clearly show that excess electrons with strong correlation\nstrength alone cannot induce the maximum Tc, which in turn strongly suggests\nneed for an interfacial effect to reach the enhanced Tc found in 1ML FeSe/STO.\n", "  The mass of $^{31}$Cl has been measured with the JYFLTRAP double Penning trap\nmass spectrometer at the Ion-Guide Isotope Separator On-Line (IGISOL) facility.\nThe determined mass-excess value, -7034.7(34) keV, is 15 times more precise\nthan in the Atomic Mass Evaluation 2012. The quadratic form of the isobaric\nmultiplet mass equation for the T=3/2 quartet at A=31 fails ($\\chi^2_n$=11.6)\nand a non-zero cubic term, d=-3.5(11) keV, is obtained when the new mass value\nis adopted. $^{31}$Cl has been found to be less proton-bound with a proton\nseparation energy of $S_p$=265(4) keV. Energies for the excited states in\n$^{31}$Cl and the photodisintegration rate on $^{31}$Cl have been determined\nwith significantly improved precision using the new $S_p$ value. The improved\nphotodisintegration rate helps to constrain astrophysical conditions where\n$^{30}$S can act as a waiting point in the rapid proton capture process in type\nI x-ray bursts.\n", "  We study the properties of possible static, spherically symmetric\nconfigurations in k-essence theories with the Lagrangian functions of the form\n$F(X)$, $X \\equiv \\phi_{,\\alpha} \\phi^{,\\alpha}$. A no-go theorem has been\nproved, claiming that a possible black-hole-like Killing horizon of finite\nradius cannot exist if the function $F(X)$ is required to have a finite\nderivative $dF/dX$. Two exact solutions are obtained for special cases of\nk-essence: one for $F(X) =F_0 X^{1/3}$, another for $F(X) = F_0 |X|^{1/2} - 2\n\\Lambda$, where $F_0$ and $\\Lambda$ are constants. Both solutions contain\nhorizons, are not asymptotically flat, and provide illustrations for the\nobtained no-go theorem. The first solution may be interpreted as describing a\nblack hole in an asymptotically singular space-time, while in the second\nsolution two horizons of infinite area are connected by a wormhole.\n", "  It has been argued that it is incompatible to maintain unitary time-evolution\nfor time-dependent non-Hermitian Hamiltonians when the metric operator is\nexplicitly time-dependent. We demonstrate here that the time-dependent Dyson\nequation and the time-dependent quasi-Hermiticity relation can be solved\nconsistently in such a scenario for a time-dependent Dyson map and\ntime-dependent metric operator, respectively. These solutions are obtained at\nthe cost of rendering the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian to be a non-observable\noperator as it ceases to be quasi-Hermitian when the metric becomes\ntime-dependent.\n", "  We experimentally image the magnetic precession phase of patterned spin Hall\nmultilayer samples to study the rf driving field vector using time-resolved\nanomalous Nernst effect (TRANE) microscopy. Our ferromagnetic resonance (FMR)\nmeasurements quantify the phase and amplitude for both the magnetic precession\nand the electric current, which allows us to establish the total driving field\norientation and the strength of spin Hall effect. In a channel of uniform\nwidth, we observe spatial variation of the FMR phase laterally across the\nchannel. We interpret our findings in the context of electrical measurement\nusing the spin-transfer torque ferromagnetic resonance technique and show that\nobserved phase variation introduces a systematic correction into the spin Hall\nangle if spatial phase and amplitude variations are not taken into account.\n", "  We perform a statistical study of the distances between successive\noccurrencies of a given dinucleotide in the DNA sequence for a number of\norganisms of different complexity. Our analysis highlights peculiar features of\nthe dinucleotide CG distribution in mammalian DNA, pointing towards a\nconnection with the role of such dinucleotide in DNA methylation. While the CG\ndistributions of mammals exhibit exponential tails with comparable parameters,\nthe picture for the other organisms studied (e.g., fish, insects, bacteria and\nviruses) is more heterogeneous, possibly because in these organisms DNA\nmethylation has different functional roles. Our analysis suggests that the\ndistribution of the distances between dinucleotides CG provides useful insights\nin characterizing and classifying organisms in terms of methylation\nfunctionalities.\n", "  We present an Advanced Spectral Leakage (ASL) scheme to model neutrinos in\nthe context of core-collapse supernovae and compact binary mergers. Based on\nprevious gray leakage schemes, the ASL scheme computes the neutrino cooling\nrates by interpolating local production and diffusion rates (relevant in\noptically thin and thick regimes, respectively), separately for discretized\nvalues of the neutrino energy. Neutrino trapped components are also modeled,\nbased on equilibrium and timescale arguments. The better accuracy achieved by\nthe spectral treatment allows a more reliable computation of neutrino heating\nrates in optically thin conditions. The scheme has been calibrated and tested\nagainst Boltzmann transport in the context of Newtonian spherically symmetric\nmodels of core-collapse supernovae. ASL shows a very good qualitative and a\npartial quantitative agreement, for key quantities from collapse to a few\nhundreds of milliseconds after core bounce. We have proved the adaptability and\nflexibility of our ASL scheme coupling it to an axisymmetric Eulerian and to a\nthree-dimensional SPH code to simulate core-collapse. Therefore, the neutrino\ntreatment presented here is ideal for large parameter-space explorations,\nparametric studies, high-resolution tests, code developments, and long-term\nmodeling of asymmetric configurations, where more detailed neutrino treatments\nare not available or currently computationally too expensive.\n", "  A fundamental connection between thermodynamics and information theory arises\nfrom the fact that correlations exhibit an inherent work value. For\nnoninteracting systems this translates to a work cost for establishing\ncorrelations. Here we investigate the relationship between work and\ncorrelations in the presence of interactions that cannot be controlled or\nremoved. For such naturally coupled systems, which are correlated even in\nthermal equilibrium, we determine general strategies that can reduce the work\ncost of correlations, and illustrate these for a selection of exemplary\nphysical systems.\n", "  Planets in highly eccentric orbits form a class of objects not seen within\nour Solar System. The most extreme case known amongst these objects is the\nplanet orbiting HD~20782, with an orbital period of 597~days and an\neccentricity of 0.96. Here we present new data and analysis for this system as\npart of the Transit Ephemeris Refinement and Monitoring Survey (TERMS). We\nobtained CHIRON spectra to perform an independent estimation of the fundamental\nstellar parameters. New radial velocities from AAT and PARAS observations\nduring periastron passage greatly improve our knowledge of the eccentric nature\nof the orbit. The combined analysis of our Keplerian orbital and Hipparcos\nastrometry show that the inclination of the planetary orbit is $> 1.22\\degr$,\nruling out stellar masses for the companion. Our long-term robotic photometry\nshow that the star is extremely stable over long timescales. Photometric\nmonitoring of the star during predicted transit and periastron times using MOST\nrule out a transit of the planet and reveal evidence of phase variations during\nperiastron. These possible photometric phase variations may be caused by\nreflected light from the planet's atmosphere and the dramatic change in\nstar--planet separation surrounding the periastron passage.\n", "  We investigate Primoridal Black Hole (PBH) formation by which we mean black\nholes produced in the early universe during radiation domination. After\ndiscussing the range of PBH mass permitted in the original mechanism of Carr\nand Hawking, hybrid inflation with parametric resonance is presented as an\nexistence theorem for PBHs of arbitrary mass. As proposed in arXiv:1510.00400,\nPBHs with many solar masses can provide a solution to the dark matter problem\nin galaxies. PBHs can also explain dark matter observed in clusters and suggest\na primordial origin for supermassive black holes in galactic cores.\n", "  We present here the first stellar models on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram\n(HRD), in which convection is treated according to the novel scale-free\nconvection theory (SFC theory) by Pasetto et al. (2014). The aim is to compare\nthe results of the new theory with those from the classical, calibrated\nmixing-length (ML) theory to examine differences and similarities. We integrate\nthe equations describing the structure of the atmosphere from the stellar\nsurface down to a few percent of the stellar mass using both ML theory and SFC\ntheory. The key temperature over pressure gradients, the energy fluxes, and the\nextension of the convective zones are compared in both theories. The analysis\nis first made for the Sun and then extended to other stars of different mass\nand evolutionary stage. The results are adequate: the SFC theory yields\nconvective zones, temperature gradients of the ambient and of the convective\nelement, and energy fluxes that are very similar to those derived from the\n\"calibrated\" MT theory for main sequence stars. We conclude that the old scale\ndependent ML theory can now be replaced with a self-consistent scale-free\ntheory able to predict correct results, one which is simpler and more\nphysically grounded than the ML theory. Fundamentally, the SFC theory offers a\ndeeper insight of the underlying physics than numerical simulations.\n", "  Using a simple three dimensional lattice four-fermion model we argue that\nmassless fermions can become massive due to interactions without the need for\nany spontaneous symmetry breaking. Using large scale Monte Carlo calculations\nwithin our model, we show that this non-traditional mass generation mechanism\noccurs at a second order quantum critical point that separates phases with the\nsame symmetries. Universality then suggests that the new origin for the fermion\nmass should be of wide interest.\n", "  Predicting the macroscopic chiral behaviour of cholesteric liquid crystals\nfrom the microscopic chirality of the particles is highly non-trivial, even\nwhen the chiral interactions are purely entropic in nature. Here we introduce a\nnovel chiral hard-particle model, namely particles with a twisted polyhedral\nshape and obtain, for the first time, a stable fully-entropy-driven cholesteric\nphase by computer simulations. By slightly modifying the triangular base of the\nparticle, we are able to switch from a left-handed prolate to a right-handed\noblate cholesteric using the same right-handed twisted particle model.\nFurthermore, we find qualitative agreement with an Onsager-like theory,\nsuggesting that the latter can be used as a quick tool to scan the huge\nparameter space associated to the microscopic chirality. Our results unveil how\nthe competition between particle biaxiality and chirality is reflected into the\nnematic self-organization and new theoretical challenges on the self-assembly\nof chiral particles can be undertaken.\n", "  The Belle II / SuperKEKB experiment is an $e^+e^-$ collider running at the\n$\\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance energy to produce B meson pairs. As an upgrade of the\nBelle / KEKB experiment, it will start physics data taking from 2018 and with\n$\\sim 40$ times luminosity, its goal is to accumulate 50 $ab^{-1}$ of $e^+e^-$\ncollision data. Now the upgrade of the sub-detector systems is on-going in KEK.\nThe physics program has a wide range of areas, including searches for direct\nCPV, Lepton Flavour Violation and dark matter. In this proceedings, we review\nthe current upgrade status of Belle II and SuperKEKB and introduce some physics\nopportunities at this facility.\n", "  Systematic variations of the IMF in early-type galaxies, and their connection\nwith possible drivers such as velocity dispersion or metallicity, have been\nmuch debated in recent years. Strong lensing over galaxy scales combined with\nphotometric and spectroscopic data provides a powerful method to constrain the\nstellar mass-to-light ratio and hence the functional form of the IMF. We\ncombine photometric and spectroscopic constraints from the latest set of\npopulation synthesis models of Charlot & Bruzual, including a varying IMF, with\na non-parametric analysis of the lens masses of 18 ETGs from the SLACS survey,\nwith velocity dispersions in the range 200-300 km/s. We find that very\nbottom-heavy IMFs are excluded. However, the upper limit to the bimodal IMF\nslope ($\\mu \\lesssim 2.2$, accounting for a dark matter fraction of 20-30%,\nwhere $\\mu=1.3$ corresponds to a Kroupa-like IMF) is compatible at the\n$1\\sigma$ level with constraints imposed by gravity-sensitive line strengths. A\ntwo-segment power law parameterisation of the IMF (Salpeter-like for high\nmasses) is more constrained ($\\Gamma \\lesssim 1.5$, where $\\Gamma$ is the power\nindex at low masses) but requires a dark matter contribution of $\\gtrsim 25\\%$\nto reconcile the results with a Salpeter IMF. For a standard Milky Way-like IMF\nto be applicable, a significant dark matter contribution is required within\n$1R_e$. Our results reveal a large range of allowed IMF slopes, which, when\ninterpreted as intrinsic scatter in the IMF properties of ETGs, could explain\nthe recent results of Smith et al., who find Milky Way-like IMF normalisations\nin a few massive lensing ETGs.\n", "  The purpose of this note is to point out analogies between causal analysis in\nstatistics and the correlation-response theory in statistical physics. It is\nfurther shown that for some systems the dynamic cavity offers a way to compute\nthe stationary state of a non- equilibrium process effectively, which could\nthen be taken an alternative starting point of causal analysis.\n", "  High-resolution single crystal neutron diffraction measurements are presented\nprobing the magnetostructural response to uniaxial pressure in the iron\npnictide parent system BaFe2As2. Scattering data reveal a strain-activated,\nanisotropic broadening of nuclear Bragg reflections, which increases upon\ncooling below the resolvable onset of global orthorhombicity. This anisotropy\nin lattice coherence continues to diverge until a lower temperature scale---the\nfirst-order onset of antiferromagnetism---is reached. Our data suggest that\nantiferromagnetism and strong magnetoelastic coupling drive the\nstrain-activated lattice response in this material and that the development of\nanisotropic lattice coherence under strain is the physical origin for the\nanomalous nematic anisotropy in this compound.\n", "  We investigate the phenomenology of the light charged and neutral scalars in\nInert Doublet Model at future $e^+ e^-$ colliders with center of mass energies\nof 0.5 and 1 TeV, and integrated luminosity of 500~fb$^{-1}$. The analysis\ncovers two production processes, $e^{+}e^{-} \\rightarrow H^{+}H^{-}$ and\n$e^{+}e^{-}\\rightarrow AH$, and consists of signal selections, cross section\ndeterminations as well as dark matter mass measurements. Several benchmark\npoints are studied with focus on $H^{\\pm} \\rightarrow W^{\\pm}H$ and $A\n\\rightarrow ZH$ decays. It is concluded that the signal will be well observable\nin different final states allowing for mass determination of all new scalars\nwith statistical precision of the order of few hundred MeV.\n", "  The kinematic dynamo (KD) describes the growth of magnetic fields generated\nby the flow of a conducting medium in the limit of vanishing backaction of the\nfields onto the flow. The KD is therefore an important model system for\nunderstanding astrophysical magnetism. Here, the mathematical correspondence\nbetween the KD and a specific stochastic differential equation (SDE) viewed\nfrom the perspective of the supersymmetric theory of stochastics (STS) is\ndiscussed. The STS is a novel, approximation-free framework to investigate\nSDEs. The correspondence reported here permits insights from the STS to be\napplied to the theory of KD and vice versa. It was previously known that the\nfast KD in the idealistic limit of no magnetic diffusion requires chaotic\nflows. The KD-STS correspondence shows that this is also true for the diffusive\nKD. From the STS perspective, the KD possesses a topological supersymmetry and\nthe dynamo effect can be viewed as its spontaneous breakdown. This\nsupersymmetry breaking can be regarded as the stochastic generalization of the\nconcept of dynamical chaos. As this supersymmetry breaking happens in both the\ndiffusive and the non-diffusive case, the necessity of the underlying SDE being\nchaotic is given in either case. The observed exponentially growing and\noscillating KD modes prove physically that dynamical spectra of the STS\nevolution operator that break the topological supersymmetry exist with both,\nreal and complex ground state eigenvalues. Finally, we comment on the\nnon-existence of dynamos for scalar quantities.\n", "  In this work we propose a measure for the quantum discord of\nindistinguishable particles, based on the definition of entanglement of\nparticles given in [H. M. Wiseman et al., Phis. Rev. Lett 91, 097902 (2003)].\nThis discord of particles is then used to evaluate the quantum correlations in\na system of two identical bosons (fermions), where the particles perform a\nquantum random walk described by the Hubbard hamiltonian in a 1D lattice. The\ndynamics of the particles is either unperturbed or subject to a classical\nenvironmental noise - such as random telegraph, pink or brown noise. The\nobserved results are consistent with those for the entanglement of particles,\nand we observe that on-site interaction between particles have an important\nprotective effect on correlations against the decoherence of the system.\n", "  Several quantum gravity scenarios lead to physics below the Planck scale\ncharacterised by nonlocal, Lorentz invariant equations of motion. We show that\nsuch non-local effective field theories lead to a modified Schr\\\"odinger\nevolution in the nonrelativistic limit. In particular, the nonlocal evolution\nof opto-mechanical quantum oscillators is characterised by a spontaneous\nperiodic squeezing that cannot be generated by environmental effects. We\ndiscuss constraints on the nonlocality obtained by past experiments, and show\nhow future experiments (already under construction) will either see such\neffects or otherwise cast severe bounds on the non-locality scale (well beyond\nthe current limits set by the Large Hadron Collider). This paves the way for\ntable top, high precision experiments on massive quantum objects as a promising\nnew avenue for testing some quantum gravity phenomenology.\n", "  We calculate the evolution of the early universe through the epochs of weak\ndecoupling, weak freeze-out and big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) by\nsimultaneously coupling a full strong, electromagnetic, and weak nuclear\nreaction network with a multi-energy group Boltzmann neutrino energy transport\nscheme. The modular structure of our code provides the ability to dissect the\nrelative contributions of each process responsible for evolving the dynamics of\nthe early universe in the absence of neutrino flavor oscillations. Such an\napproach allows a detailed accounting of the evolution of the $\\nu_e$,\n$\\bar\\nu_e$, $\\nu_\\mu$, $\\bar\\nu_\\mu$, $\\nu_\\tau$, $\\bar\\nu_\\tau$ energy\ndistribution functions alongside and self-consistently with the nuclear\nreactions and entropy/heat generation and flow between the neutrino and\nphoton/electron/positron/baryon plasma components. This calculation reveals\nnonlinear feedback in the time evolution of neutrino distribution functions and\nplasma thermodynamic conditions (e.g., electron-positron pair densities), with\nimplications for: the phasing between scale factor and plasma temperature; the\nneutron-to-proton ratio; light-element abundance histories; and the\ncosmological parameter \\neff. We find that our approach of following the time\ndevelopment of neutrino spectral distortions and concomitant entropy production\nand extraction from the plasma results in changes in the computed value of the\nBBN deuterium yield. For example, for particular implementations of quantum\ncorrections in plasma thermodynamics, our calculations show a $0.4\\%$ increase\nin deuterium. These changes are potentially significant in the context of\nanticipated improvements in observational and nuclear physics uncertainties.\n", "  Several fcc- and hcp-structured Ir-Os alloys have been recently studied up to\n30 GPa at room temperature by means of synchrotron-based X-ray powder\ndiffraction in diamond anvil cells. Using their bulk moduli -which increase\nwith increasing osmium content showing a deviation from linearity- and after\nemploying a thermodynamical model it was concluded that the bulk modulus for\nosmium is slightly smaller than that for diamond. Here, a similar conclusion is\nobtained upon employing an alternative model, thus strengthening the conclusion\nthat osmium is the densest but not the most incompressible element. This is\nparticularly interesting for Earth Sciences since it may be of key importance\ntowards clarifying the anomalous elastic properties of the Earth's core.\n", "  We present a new technique of decontaminating Swift UVOT grism spectra for\ntransient objects. We describe the template image requirements and image\nprocessing steps necessary to successfully implement the empirical\ndecontamination technique. We demonstrate the accuracy of the flux and\nwavelength calibrations for decontaminated spectra by comparing a spectrum of\nSN 2011fe with a well-calibrated, long-slit ultraviolet spectrum from the\nHubble Space Telescope's Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph. We also show how\nthe decontamination removes spurious emission lines from spectra of iPTF14bdn\nwhich otherwise could be misinterpreted as coming from the supernova. The\nsoftware which implements this technique is briefly discussed and is made\navailable to the community.\n", "  Recently, a new construction for complete loop integrands of massless field\ntheories has been proposed, with on-shell tree-level amplitudes delicately\nincorporated into its algorithm. This new approach reinterprets integrands in a\nnovel form, namely the Q-cut representation. In this paper, by deriving\none-loop integrands as examples, we elaborate in details the technique of this\nnew representation, e.g., the summation over all possible Q-cuts as well as\nhelicity states for the non-scalar internal particle in the loop. Moreover, we\nshow that the integrand in the Q-cut representation naturally reduces to the\nintegrand in the traditional unitarity cut method for each given cut channel,\nproviding a cross-check for the new approach.\n", "  We investigate Poiseuille channel flow through intrinsically curved media,\nequipped with localized metric perturbations. To this end, we study the flux of\na fluid driven through the curved channel in dependence of the spatial\ndeformation, characterized by the parameters of the metric perturbations\n(amplitude, range and density). We find that the flux depends only on a\nspecific combination of parameters, which we identify as the average metric\nperturbation, and derive a universal flux law for the Poiseuille flow. For the\npurpose of this study, we have improved and validated our recently developed\nlattice Boltzmann model in curved space by considerably reducing discrete\nlattice effects.\n", "  A recent observational study of haloes of nearby Milky Way-like galaxies\nshows that only half (four out of eight) of the current sample exhibits strong\nnegative metallicity ([Fe/H]) gradients. This is at odds with predictions from\nhydrodynamical simulations where such gradients are ubiquitous. In this Letter,\nwe use high resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to study the\n[Fe/H] distribution of galactic haloes. We find that kinematically selected\nstellar haloes, including both in-situ and accreted particles, have an oblate\n[Fe/H] distribution. Spherical [Fe/H] radial profiles show strong negative\ngradients within 100 kpc, in agreement with previous numerical results.\nHowever, the projected median [Fe/H] profiles along the galactic disc minor\naxis, typically obtained in observations, are significantly flatter. The median\n[Fe/H] values at a given radius are larger for the spherical profiles than for\nthe minor axis profiles by as much as 0.4 dex within the inner 50 kpc. Similar\nresults are obtained if only the accreted stellar component is considered\nindicating that the differences between spherical and minor axis profiles are\nnot purely driven by heated disc star particles formed in situ. Our study\nhighlights the importance of performing careful comparisons between models and\nobservations of halo [Fe/H] distributions.\n", "  Strongly anisotropic media where the principal components of electric\npermittivity or magnetic permeability tensors have opposite signs are termed as\nhyperbolic media. Such media support propagating electromagnetic waves with\nextremely large wavevectors exhibiting unique optical properties. However in\nall artificial and natural optical materials studied to date, the hyperbolic\ndispersion originates solely from the electric response. This restricts\nmaterial functionality to one polarization of light and inhibits free-space\nimpedance matching. Such restrictions can be overcome in media having\ncomponents of opposite signs for both electric and magnetic tensors. Here we\npresent the experimental demonstration of the magnetic hyperbolic dispersion in\nthree-dimensional metamaterials. We measure metamaterial isofrequecy contours\nand reveal the topological phase transition between the elliptic and hyperbolic\ndispersion. In the hyperbolic regime, we demonstrate the strong enhancement of\nthermal emission, which becomes directional, coherent and polarized. Our\nfindings show the possibilities for realizing efficient impedance-matched\nhyperbolic media for unpolarized light.\n", "  Motivated by both concepts of R.J. Adler's recent work on utilizing Clifford\nalgebra as the linear line element $ds = \\left\\langle \\gamma_\\mu \\right\\rangle\ndX^\\mu $, and the fermionization of the cylindrical worldsheet Polyakov action,\nwe introduce a new type of spacetime quantization that is fully covariant. The\ntheory is based on the reinterpretation of Adler's linear line element as $ds =\n\\gamma_\\mu \\left\\langle \\lambda \\gamma ^\\mu \\right\\rangle$, where $\\lambda$ is\nthe characteristic length of the theory. We name this new operator as\n\"spacetime interval operator\", and argue that it can be regarded as a natural\nextension to the one-forms in the $U(\\mathfrak{s}u(2))$ non-commutative\ngeometry. By treating Fourier momentum as the particle momentum, the\ngeneralized uncertainty principle of the $U(\\mathfrak{s}u(2))$ non-commutative\ngeometry, as an approximation to the generalized uncertainty principle of our\ntheory, is derived, and is shown to have a lowest order correction term of the\norder $p^2$ similar to that of Snyder's. The holography nature of the theory is\ndemonstrated, and the predicted fuzziness of the geodesic is shown to be much\nsmaller than conceivable astrophysical bounds.\n", "  We study the topological structure of QCD by cluster analysis. The fermionic\ntopological charge density is constructed from low lying modes of overlap Dirac\noperator for three types of temporal boundary conditions for fermion field.\nThis gives the possibility to mark all three dyon constitutents of KvBLL\ncaloron in gluonic fields. The gluonic topological charge density is appearing\nin the process of overimproved gradient flow process stopped at the moment when\nit maximally matches the fermionic topological charge density. This corresponds\nto the smearing of gluonic fields up to the scale set by dyon size. The\ntime-like Abelian monopoles and specific KvBLL pattern of Polyakov line\ncorrelate with topological clusters.\n", "  Topological Weyl semimetals can host Weyl nodes with monopole charges in\nmomentum space. How to detect the signature of the monopole charges in quantum\ntransport remains a challenging topic. Here, we reveal the connection between\nthe parity of monopole charge in topological semimetals and the quantum\ninterference corrections to the conductivity. We show that the parity of\nmonopole charge determines the sign of the quantum interference correction,\nwith odd and even parity yielding the weak anti-localization and weak\nlocalization effects, respectively. This is attributed to the Berry phase\ndifference between time-reversed trajectories circulating the Fermi sphere that\nencloses the monopole charges. From standard Feynman diagram calculations, we\nfurther show that the weak-field magnetoconductivity at low temperatures is\nproportional to $+\\sqrt{B}$ in double-Weyl semimetals and $-\\sqrt{B}$ in Weyl\nsemimetals, respectively, which could be verified experimentally.\n", "  We perform a statistical combination of the ATLAS and CMS results for the\nsearch of a heavy resonance decaying to a pair of vector bosons with the\n$\\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV datasets collected at the LHC. We take into account six\nsearches in hadronic and semileptonic final states carried out by the two\ncollaborations. We consider only public information provided by ATLAS and CMS\nin the HEPDATA database and in papers published in refereed journals. We\ninterpret the combined results within the context of a few benchmark new\nphysics models, such as models predicting the existence of a\n{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{W^\\prime}}\\xspace} or a bulk Randall-Sundrum spin--2\nresonance, for which we present exclusion limits, significances, $p$-values and\nbest-fit cross sections. A heavy diboson resonance with a production cross\nsection of $\\sim$4-5 fb and mass between 1.9 and 2.0 TeV is the exotic scenario\nmost consistent with the experimental results. Models in which a heavy\nresonance decays preferentially to a WW final state are disfavoured.\n", "  We numerically study water wave packets on a spatially varying\ncounter-current in the presence of surface tension. Depending on the details of\nthe velocity profile, we show that traversable and bi-directional analogue\nwormholes exist in fluid mechanics. The limitations on traversability of\nwormholes in general relativity are absent here because of the dispersion of\nwater waves and the ability to form flow profiles that are not solutions of\nEinstein's equations. We observe that negative energy can be trapped between\nanalogue horizons forming a LASER-like cavity. Six horizons are involved in the\ntrapping cavity because of the existence of two dispersive scales, in contrast\nto previous treatments which considered two horizons and one dispersive scale.\n", "  We present a method to recover and study the projected gravitational tidal\nforces from a galaxy survey containing little or no redshift information. The\nmethod and the physical interpretation of the recovered tidal maps as a tracer\nof the cosmic web are described in detail. We first apply the method to a\nsimulated galaxy survey and study the accuracy with which the cosmic web can be\nrecovered in the presence of different observational effects, showing that the\nprojected tidal field can be estimated with reasonable precision over large\nregions of the sky. We then apply our method to the 2MASS survey and present a\npublicly available full-sky map of the projected tidal forces in the local\nUniverse. As an example of an application of these data we further study the\ndistribution of galaxy luminosities across the different elements of the cosmic\nweb, finding that, while more luminous objects are found preferentially in the\nmost dense environments, there is no further segregation by tidal environment.\n", "  We introduce an algorithm for sampling many-body quantum states in Fock\nspace. The algorithm efficiently samples states with probability approximately\nproportional to an arbitrary function of the second-quantized Hamiltonian\nmatrix element connecting the sampled state to the current state. We apply the\nnew sampling algorithm to the recently-developed Semistochastic Full\nConfiguration Interaction Quantum Monte Carlo method (S-FCIQMC), a\nsemistochastic implementation of the power method for projecting out the ground\nstate energy in a basis of Slater determinants. The heat-bath sampling requires\nmodest additional computational time and memory compared to uniform sampling\nbut results in newly-spawned weights that are approximately of the same\nmagnitude, thereby greatly improving the efficiency of projection. A comparison\nin efficiency between uniform and approximate heat-bath sampling is performed\non the all-electron nitrogen dimer at equilibrium in Dunning's cc-pVXZ basis\nsets with X in {D, T, Q, 5}, demonstrating a large gain in efficiency that\nincreases with basis set size. In addition, a comparison in efficiency is\nperformed on three all-electron first-row dimers, B_2, N_2, and F_2, in a\ncc-pVQZ basis, demonstrating that the gain in efficiency compared to uniform\nsampling also increases dramatically with the number of electrons.\n", "  The recently derived expressions for finite gauge transformations in double\nfield theory with duality group O(d,d) are generalised to give expressions for\nfinite gauge transformations for extended field theories with duality group\nSL(5,R), SO(5,5) and E6. The generalised metrics are discussed.\n", "  The two-dimensional, massless Gross-Neveu model with Nc colors and SU(2)\nisospin is studied analytically in the large Nc limit. The chiral SU(2)L X\nSU(2)R symmetry is broken spontaneously in the vacuum. Twisted kinks connecting\ntwo arbitrary points on the vacuum manifold S3 are constructed, and their\nproperties are explored. The phase diagram as a function of temperature,\nbaryon- and isospin chemical potential is discussed, with special emphasis on\ninhomogeneous phases. The preferred form of the condensate is a product of the\nreal kink crystal and the chiral spiral. Kink-kink scattering is solved, using\nthe general solution of the multicomponent Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation\nrecently presented by Takahashi.\n", "  In this paper, we study the three-dimensional noncommutative\nMaxwell-Chern-Simons theory. In the present analysis, a complete account for\nthe gauge field two-point function renormalizability is presented and physical\nsignificant quantities are carefully established. The respective form factor\nexpressions from the gauge field self-energy are computed at one-loop order.\nMore importantly, an analysis of the gauge field dispersion relation, in search\nof possible noncommutative anomalies and infrared finiteness, is performed for\nthree special cases, with particular interest in the highly noncommutative\nlimit.\n", "  A topological superconducting wire with an effective time reversal symmetry\nis known to have a $\\mathbb{Z}_8$ topological classification in the presence of\ninteractions. The topological index $|n| \\le 4$ counts the number of Majorana\nend states, negative $n$ corresponding to end states that are odd under time\nreversal. If such a wire is weakly coupled to a normal-metal lead, interactions\ninduce a Kondo-like correlated state if $|n| = 4$. We show that the Kondo-like\nstate manifests itself in an anomalous temperature dependence of the zero-bias\nconductance and by an anomalous Fano factor for the zero-temperature\nnormally-reflected current at finite bias. We also consider the splitting of\nthe effective Kondo resonance for weak symmetry-breaking perturbations.\n", "  Measurements of black-hole spins from gravitational-wave observations of\nblack-hole binaries with ground-based detectors are expected to be hampered by\npartial degeneracies in the gravitational-wave phasing: between the two\ncomponent spins, and between the spins and the binary's mass ratio, at least\nfor signals that are dominated by the binary's inspiral. Through the merger and\nringdown, however, a different set of degeneracies apply. This suggests the\npossibility that, if the inspiral, merger and ringdown are all within the\nsensitive frequency band of a detector, we may be able to break these\ndegeneracies and more accurately measure both spins. In this work we\ninvestigate our ability to measure individual spins for non-precessing\nbinaries, for a range of configurations and signal strengths, and conclude that\nin general the spin of the larger black hole will be measurable (at best) with\nobservations from Advanced LIGO and Virgo. This implies that in many\napplications waveform models parameterized by only one \\emph{effective spin}\nwill be sufficient. Our work does not consider precessing binaries or\nsub-dominant harmonics, although we provide some arguments why we expect that\nthese will not qualitatively change our conclusions.\n", "  We investigate the question of electroweak naturalness within the deflected\nmirage mediation (DMM) framework for supersymmetry breaking in the minimal\nsupersymmetric standard model (MSSM). The class of DMM models considered are\nnine-parameter theories that fall within the general classification of the\n19-parameter phenomenological MSSM (pMSSM). Our results show that these DMM\nmodels have regions of parameter space with very low electroweak fine-tuning,\nat levels comparable to the pMSSM. These parameter regions should be probed\nextensively in the current LHC run.\n", "  We consider the space-condensate inflation model to study the primordial\ngravitational waves generated in the early Universe. We calculate the energy\nspectrum of gravitational waves induced by the space-condensate inflation model\nfor full frequency range with assumption that the phase transition between two\nconsecutive regimes to be abrupt during evolution of the Universe. The\nsuppression of energy spectrum is found in our model for the decreasing\nfrequency of gravitational waves depending on the model parameter. To realize\nthe suppression of energy spectrum of the primordial gravitational waves, we\nstudy an existence of the early phase transition during inflation for the\nspace-condensate inflation model.\n", "  We constrain deviations of the form $T\\propto (1+z)^{1+\\epsilon}$ from the\nstandard redshift-temperature relation, corresponding to modifying distance\nduality as $D_L=(1+z)^{2(1+\\epsilon)} D_A$. We consider a consistent model, in\nwhich both the background and perturbation equations are changed. For this\npurpose, we introduce a species of dark radiation particles to which photon\nenergy density is transferred, and assume $\\epsilon\\ge0$. The Planck 2015\nrelease high multipole temperature plus low multipole data give the limit\n$\\epsilon<4.5\\times 10^{-3}$ at 95% C.L. The main obstacle to improving this\nCMB-only result is strong degeneracy between $\\epsilon$ and the physical matter\ndensities $\\omega_{\\rm b}$ and $\\omega_{\\rm c}$. A constraint on deuterium\nabundance improves the limit to $\\epsilon<1.8\\times 10^{-3}$. Adding the Planck\nhigh-multipole CMB polarisation and BAO data leads to a small improvement; with\nthis maximal dataset we obtain $\\epsilon<1.3\\times 10^{-3}$. This dataset\nconstrains the present dark radiation energy density to at most 12% of the\ntotal photon plus dark radiation density. Finally, we discuss the degeneracy\nbetween dark radiation and the effective number of relativistic species $N_{\\rm\neff}$, and consider the impact of dark radiation perturbations and allowing\n$\\epsilon<0$ on the results.\n", "  In most iron-based superconductors, the transition to the magnetically\nordered state is closely linked to a lowering of structural symmetry from\ntetragonal ($C_{4}$) to orthorhombic ($C_{2}$). However, recently, a regime of\n$C_{4}$-symmetric magnetic order has been reported in certain hole-doped\niron-based superconductors. This novel magnetic ground state can be understood\nas a double-$\\mathbf{Q}$ spin density wave characterized by two order\nparameters $\\mathbf{M}_{1}$ and $\\mathbf{M}_{2}$ related to each of the two\n$\\mathbf{Q}$ vectors. Depending on the relative orientations of the order\nparameters, either a noncollinear spin-vortex crystal or a nonuniform\ncharge-spin density wave could form. Experimentally, M\\\"ossbauer spectroscopy,\nneutron scattering, and muon spin rotation established the latter as the\nmagnetic configuration of some of these optimally hole-doped iron-based\nsuperconductors. Theoretically, low-energy itinerant models do support a\ntransition from single-$\\mathbf{Q}$ to double-$\\mathbf{Q}$ magnetic order, but\nwith nearly-degenerate spin-vortex crystal and charge-spin density wave states.\nIn fact, extensions of these low-energy models including additional electronic\ninteractions tip the balance in favor of the spin-vortex crystal, in apparent\ncontradiction with the recent experimental findings. In this paper, we revisit\nthe phase diagram of magnetic ground states of low-energy multi-band models in\nthe presence of weak disorder. We show that impurity scattering not only\npromotes the transition from $C_{2}$ to $C_{4}$-magnetic order, but it also\nfavors the charge-spin density wave over the spin-vortex crystal phase.\nAdditionally, in the single-$\\mathbf{Q}$ phase, our analysis of the nematic\ncoupling constant in the presence of disorder supports the experimental finding\nthat the splitting between the structural and stripe-magnetic transition is\nenhanced by disorder.\n", "  We consider the possibility that the diphoton excess at 750 GeV is caused by\na new scalar resonance produced in photon fusion. This scenario is parametrised\nby only one relevant effective couplings and is thus minimal. We show that this\nsetup can reproduce both the production rate and width of the resonance, and is\nnot in conflict with the 8 TeV limits on the diphoton cross section. The\nscenario also predicts event rates for $WW$, $ZZ$, $Z\\gamma$ final states. We\nsuggest to perform precision measurements by studying light-by-light scattering\nwith intact protons detected in forward detectors. We construct a simple model\nthat shows that the required couplings can be achieved with new vectorlike,\nuncolored fermions (with a strong Yukawa coupling to the resonance) which may\nalso account for the required width.\n", "  We point out a potential common origin of the recently observed 750 GeV\ndiphoton resonance and a Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) candidate.\nIn a dark QCD sector with an unbroken dark G-parity, the diphoton resonance\ncould be a dark G-even pion, while the WIMP could be the lightest dark G-odd\npion. Both particles are Standard Model gauge singlets and have the same decay\nconstant. For the dark pion decay constant of around 500 GeV, both the diphoton\nexcess at the LHC and the dark matter thermal abundance can be accommodated in\nour model. Our model predicts additional dark G-even and dark G-odd color-octet\npions within reach of the 13 TeV LHC runs. For the 5 + 5bar model, compatible\nwith the Grand Unified Theories, the WIMP mass is predicted to be within (613,\n750) GeV.\n", "  Fundamental sensitivity of an optical interferometric gravitational wave\ndetector increases with increase of the optical power which, in turn, limited\nbecause of the opto-mechanical parametric instabilities of the interferometer.\nWe propose to optimize geometrical shape of the mirrors of the detector to\nreduce the diffraction-limited finesse of unessential optical modes of the\ninterferometer resulting in increase of the threshold of the opto-mechanical\ninstabilities and subsequent increase of the measurement sensitivity. Utilizing\nparameters of the LIGO interferometer we found that the proposed technique\nallows constructing a Fabry-Perot interferometer with round trip diffraction\nloss of the fundamental mode not exceeding $5$~ppm, whereas the loss of the\nfirst dipole as well as the other high order modes exceed $1,000$~ppm and\n$8,000$~ppm, respectively. The optimization comes at the price of tighter\ntolerances on the mirror tilt stability, but does not result in a significant\nmodification of the optical beam profile and does not require changes in the\nthe gravity detector read-out system. The cavity with proposed mirrors is also\nstable with respect to the slight modification of the mirror shape.\n", "  We experimentally investigate the interplay of Turing and Faraday\n(modulational) instabilities in a bistable passive nonlinear resonator. The\nFaraday branch is induced via parametric resonance owing to a periodic\nmodulation of the resonator dispersion. We show that the bistable switching\ndynamics is dramatically affected by the competition between the two\ninstability mechanisms, which dictates two completely novel scenarios. At low\ndetunings from resonance switching occurs between the stable stationary lower\nbranch and the Faraday-unstable upper branch, whereas at high detunings we\nobserve the crossover between the Turing and Faraday periodic structures. The\nresults are well explained in terms of the universal Lugiato-Lefever model.\n", "  The mass of the dark matter particle is unknown, and may be as low as\n~$10^{-22}$ eV. The lighter part of this range, below ~eV, is relatively\nunexplored both theoretically and experimentally but contains an array of\nnatural dark matter candidates. An example is the relaxion, a light boson\npredicted by cosmological solutions to the hierarchy problem. One of the few\ngeneric signals such light dark matter can produce is a time-oscillating,\nEP-violating force. We propose searches for this using accelerometers, and\nconsider in detail the examples of torsion balances, atom interferometry, and\npulsar timing. These approaches have the potential to probe large parts of\nunexplored parameter space in the next several years. Thus such accelerometers\nprovide radically new avenues for the direct detection of dark matter.\n", "  We consider extensions of the Standard Model in which a spontaneously broken\nglobal chiral Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry arises as an accidental symmetry of an\nexact $Z_N$ symmetry. For $N = 9$ or $10$, this symmetry can protect the accion\n- the Nambu-Goldstone boson arising from the spontaneous breaking of the\naccidental PQ symmetry - against semi-classical gravity effects, thus\nsuppressing gravitational corrections to the effective potential, while it can\nat the same time provide for the small explicit symmetry breaking term needed\nto make models with domain wall number $N_{\\rm DW}>1$, such as the popular\nDine-Fischler-Srednicki-Zhitnitsky (DFSZ) model ($N_{\\rm DW}=6$),\ncosmologically viable even in the case where spontaneous PQ symmetry breaking\noccurred after inflation. We find that $N=10$ DFSZ accions with mass $m_A\n\\approx 3.5$-$4.2\\,\\mathrm{meV}$ can account for cold dark matter and\nsimultaneously explain the hints for anomalous cooling of white dwarfs. The\nproposed helioscope International Axion Observatory - being sensitive to solar\nDFSZ accions with mass above a few meV - will decisively test this scenario.\n", "  Magnetic fields pervade the entire Universe and affect the formation and\nevolution of astrophysical systems from cosmological to planetary scales. The\ngeneration and dynamical amplification of extragalactic magnetic fields through\ncosmic times, up to $\\mu$Gauss levels reported in nearby galaxy clusters, near\nequipartition with kinetic energy of plasma motions and on scales of at least\ntens of kiloparsecs, is a major puzzle largely unconstrained by observations. A\ndynamo effect converting kinetic flow energy into magnetic energy is often\ninvoked in that context, however extragalactic plasmas are weakly collisional\n(as opposed to magnetohydrodynamic fluids), and whether magnetic-field growth\nand sustainment through an efficient turbulent dynamo instability is possible\nin such plasmas is not established. Fully kinetic numerical simulations of the\nVlasov equation in a six-dimensional phase space necessary to answer this\nquestion have until recently remained beyond computational capabilities. Here,\nwe show by means of such simulations that magnetic-field amplification via a\ndynamo instability does occur in a stochastically-driven, non-relativistic\nsubsonic flow of initially unmagnetized collisionless plasma. We also find that\nthe dynamo self-accelerates and becomes entangled with kinetic instabilities as\nmagnetization increases. The results suggest that such a plasma dynamo may be\nrealizable in laboratory experiments, support the idea that intracluster medium\n(ICM) turbulence may have significantly contributed to the amplification of\ncluster magnetic fields up to near-equipartition levels on a timescale shorter\nthan the Hubble time, and emphasize the crucial role of multiscale kinetic\nphysics in high-energy astrophysical plasmas.\n", "  We extend the electrodynamics of two dimensional electron gases to account\nfor the extrinsic spin Hall effect (SHE). The theory is applied to doped\ngraphene decorated with a random distribution of absorbates that induce\nspin-orbit coupling (SOC) by proximity. The formalism extends previous\nsemiclassical treatments of the SHE to the non-local dynamical regime. Within a\nparticle-number conserving approximation, we compute the conductivity,\ndielectric function, and spin Hall angle in the small frequency and wave vector\nlimit. The spin Hall angle is found to decrease with frequency and wave number,\nbut it remains comparable to its zero-frequency value around the frequency\ncorresponding to the Drude peak. The plasmon dispersion and linewidth are also\nobtained. The extrinsic SHE affects the plasmon dispersion in the long\nwavelength limit, but not at large values of the wave number. This result\nsuggests an explanation for the rather similar plasmonic response measured in\nexfoliated graphene, which does not exhibit the SHE, and graphene grown by\nchemical vapor deposition, for which a large SHE has been recently reported.\nOur theory also lays the foundation for future experimental searches of SOC\neffects in the electrodynamic response of two-dimensional electron gases with\nSOC disorder.\n", "  The cold dark matter (CDM) cosmological model unambigously predicts that a\nlarge number of haloes should survive as subhaloes when they are accreted into\na larger halo. The CDM model would be ruled out if such substructures were\nshown not to exist. By contrast, if the dark matter consists of warm particles\n(WDM), then below a threshold mass that depends on the particle mass far fewer\nsubstructures would be present. Finding subhaloes below a certain mass would\nthen rule out warm particle masses below some value. Strong gravitational\nlensing provides a clean method to measure the subhalo mass function through\ndistortions in the structure of Einstein rings and giant arcs.Using mock\nlensing observations constructed from high-resolution N-body simulations, we\nshow that measurements of approximately 100 strong lens systems with a\ndetection limit of $10^7 h^{-1} M_{\\odot}$ would clearly distinguish CDM from\nWDM in the case where this consists of 7 keV sterile neutrinos such as those\nthat might be responsible for the 3.5 keV X-ray emission line recently detected\nin galaxies and clusters.\n", "  Motivated by the recently reported diphoton excess at 750 GeV observed by\nboth CMS and ATLAS, we study string-based particle physics models which can\naccommodate this signal. Quite remarkably, although Grand Unified Theories in\nF-theory tend to impose tight restrictions on candidate extra sectors, the case\nof a probe D3-brane near an E-type Yukawa point naturally leads to a class of\nstrongly coupled models capable of accommodating the observed signature. In\nthese models, the visible sector is realized by intersecting 7-branes, and the\n750 GeV resonance is a scalar modulus associated with motion of the D3-brane in\nthe direction transverse to the Standard Model 7-branes. Integrating out heavy\n3-7 string messenger states leads to dimension five operators for gluon fusion\nproduction and diphoton decays. Due to the unified structure of interactions,\nthese models also predict that there should be additional decay channels to ZZ\nand Z gamma. We also comment on models with distorted unification, where both\nthe production mechanism and decay channels can differ.\n", "  In this paper, we numerically study the magnetic transport properties of\ndisordered Weyl semimetals (WSM) in the ultra-quantum limit. We find a positive\nmagnetic conductivity for the long-range disorder, although the system tends to\nhave negative magnetic conductivity for the weak short-range disorder.\nRemarkably, for long-range disorder, such a positive magnetic conductivity\ncannot be described by the semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory even in the\nweak disorder limit, and the back-scattering assisted by the high Landau levels\nis always important. Our results have significant implications for the positive\nmagnetic conductivity recently discovered in the WSM systems, and point out two\nphysical mechanisms: (i) the long-range correlated disorder suppresses the\nback-scattering among the zeroth Landau level modes; (ii) with increasing the\nmagnetic field, the back-scattering assisted by the high Landau levels will\nalso be suppressed.\n", "  QCD with imaginary chemical potential is free of the sign problem and\nexhibits a rich phase structure constraining the phase diagram at real chemical\npotential. We simulate the critical endpoint of the Roberge-Weiss (RW)\ntransition at imaginary chemical potential for $N_\\text{f}=2$ QCD on $N_\\tau=6$\nlattices with standard Wilson fermions. As found on coarser lattices, the RW\nendpoint is a triple point connecting the deconfinement/chiral transitions in\nthe heavy/light quark mass regions and changes to a second-order endpoint for\nintermediate masses. These regimes are separated by two tricritical values of\nthe quark mass, which we determine by extracting the critical exponent $\\nu$\nfrom a systematic finite size scaling analysis of the Binder cumulant of the\nimaginary part of the Polyakov loop. We are able to explain a previously\nobserved finite size effect afflicting the scaling of the Binder cumulant in\nthe regime of three-phase coexistence. Compared to $N_\\tau=4$ lattices, the\ntricritical masses are shifted towards smaller values. Exploratory results on\n$N_\\tau=8$ as well as comparison with staggered simulations suggest that\nsignificantly finer lattices are needed before a continuum extrapolation\nbecomes feasible.\n", "  Continued progress in observational stellar astrophysics requires a deep\nunderstanding of the underlying convection dynamics. We present results of\nrealistic 3D radiative hydrodynamic simulations of the outer layers of a\nmoderate mass star (1.47 Msun), including the full convection zone, the\novershoot region, and the top layers of the radiative zone. The simulation\nresults show that the surface granulation has a broad range of scales, from 2\nto 12 Mm, and that large granules are organized in well-defined clusters,\nconsisting of several granules. Comparison of the mean structure profiles from\n3D simulations with the corresponding 1D standard stellar model shows an\nincrease of the stellar radius by ~800 km, as well as significant changes in\nthe thermodynamic structure and turbulent properties of the ionization zones.\nConvective downdrafts in the intergranular lanes between granulation clusters\nreach speeds of more than 20 km/s, penetrate through the whole convection zone,\nhit the radiative zone, and form a 8 Mm thick overshoot layer. Contrary to\nsemi-empirical overshooting models, our results show that the 3D dynamic\novershoot region consists of two layers: a nearly adiabatic extension of the\nconvection zone and a deeper layer of enhanced subadiabatic stratification.\nThis layer is formed because of heating caused by the braking of the\novershooting convective plumes. This effect has to be taken into account in\nstellar modeling and the interpretation of asteroseismology data. In\nparticular, we demonstrate that the 3D model can qualitatively explain\ndeviations from the standard solar model found by helioseismology.\n", "  Density functional theory (DFT) is notorious for the absence of gradient\ncorrections to the two-dimensional (2D) Thomas-Fermi kinetic-energy functional;\nit is widely accepted that the 2D analog of the 3D von Weizs\\\"acker correction\nvanishes, together with all higher-order corrections. Contrary to this\nlong-held belief, we show that the leading correction to the kinetic energy\ndoes not vanish, is unambiguous, and contributes perturbatively to the total\nenergy. This insight emerges naturally in a simple extension of standard DFT,\nwhich has the effective potential energy as a functional variable on equal\nfooting with the single-particle density.\n", "  Incompatible observables can be approximated by compatible observables in\njoint measurement or measured sequentially, with constrained accuracy as\nimplied by Heisenberg's original formulation of the uncertainty principle.\nRecently, Busch, Lahti, and Werner proposed inaccuracy trade-off relations\nbased on statistical distances between probability distributions of measurement\noutcomes [Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 160405 (2013); Phys. Rev. A 89, 012129 (2014)].\nHere we reform their theoretical framework, derive an improved relation for\nqubit measurement, and perform an experimental test on a spin system. The\nrelation reveals that the worst-case inaccuracy is tightly bounded from below\nby the incompatibility of target observables, and is verified by the experiment\nemploying joint measurement in which two compatible but typically\nnon-commutative observables on one qubit are measured simultaneously.\n", "  We study general relativity with pressureless dust in the canonical\nformulation, with the dust field chosen as a matter-time gauge. The resulting\ntheory has three physical degrees of freedom in the metric field. The\nlinearized canonical theory reveals two graviton modes and a scalar mode. We\nfind that the graviton modes remain Lorentz covariant despite the time gauge,\nand that the scalar mode is ultralocal. We discuss also a modification of the\ntheory to include a parameter in the Hamiltonian analogous to that in\nHorava-Lifshitz models. In this case the scalar mode is no longer ultralocal,\nand acquires a propagation speed dependent on the deformation parameter.\n", "  We derive a free-form mass distribution for the massive cluster AS1063\n(z=0.348) using the completed optical imaging from the Hubble Frontier Fields\nprogramme. Based on a subset of 11 multiply lensed systems with spectroscopic\nredshift we produce a lens model that is accurate enough to unveil new multiply\nlensed systems, totalling over a 100 arclets, and to estimate their redshifts\ngeometrically. Consistency is found between this precise model and that\nobtained using only the subset of lensed sources with spectroscopically\nmeasured redshifts. Although a relatively large elongation of the mass\ndistribution is apparent relative to the X-ray map, no significant offset is\nfound between the centroid of our mass distribution and that of the X-ray\nemission map, suggesting a relatively relaxed state for this cluster. For the\nwell resolved lensed images we provide detailed model comparisons to illustrate\nthe precision of our model and hence the reliability of our de-lensed sources.\nA clear linear structure is associated with one such source extending approx.\n23 kpc in length, that could be an example of jet-induced star formation, at\nredshift z=3.1.\n", "  The properties of the first generation of stars and their supernova (SN)\nexplosions remains unknown due to the lack of their actual observations.\nRecently many transient surveys are conducted and the feasibility of the\ndetection of supernovae (SNe) of Pop III stars is growing. In this paper we\nstudy the multicolor light curves for a number of metal-free core-collapse SN\nmodels (25-100 M$_{\\odot}$) to provide the indicators for finding and\nidentification of first generation SNe. We use mixing-fallback supernova\nexplosion models which explain the observed abundance patterns of metal poor\nstars. Numerical calculations of the multicolor light curves are performed\nusing multigroup radiation hydrodynamic code STELLA. The calculated light\ncurves of metal-free SNe are compared with non-zero metallicity models and\nseveral observed SNe. We have found that the shock breakout characteristics,\nthe evolution of the photosphere's velocity, the luminosity, the duration and\ncolor evolution of the plateau - all the SN phases are helpful to estimate the\nparameters of SN progenitor: the mass, the radius, the explosion energy and the\nmetallicity. We conclude that the multicolor light curves can be potentially\nused to identify first generation SNe in the current (Subaru/HSC) and future\ntransient surveys (LSST, JWST). They are also suitable for identification of\nthe low-metallicity SNe in the nearby Universe (PTF, Pan-STARRS, Gaia).\n", "  A critical aspect of quantum mechanics is the nonlocal nature of the\nwavefunction, a characteristic that may yield unexpected coupling of\nnominally-isolated systems. The capacity to detect this coupling can be vital\nin many situations, especially those in which its strength is weak. In this\nwork we address this problem in the context of mesoscopic physics, by\nimplementing an electron-wave realization of a Fano interferometer using pairs\nof coupled quantum point contacts (QPCs). Within this scheme, the discrete\nlevel required for a Fano resonance is provided by pinching off one of the\nQPCs, thereby inducing the formation of a quasi-bound state at the center of\nits self-consistent potential barrier. Using this system, we demonstrate a form\nof \\textit{nonequilibrium} Fano resonance (NEFR), in which nonlinear electrical\nbiasing of the interferometer gives rise to pronounced distortions of its Fano\nresonance. Our experimental results are captured well by a quantitative\ntheoretical model, which considers a system in which a standard two-path Fano\ninterferometer is coupled to an additional, \\textit{intruder}, continuum.\nAccording to this theory, the observed distortions in the Fano resonance arise\n\\textit{only} in the presence of coupling to the intruder, indicating that the\nNEFR provides a sensitive means to infer the presence of weak coupling between\nmesoscopic systems.\n", "  We interpret the 750~GeV diphoton excess recently found in the 13~TeV LHC\ndata as a singlet scalar in an extra dimensional model, where one extra\ndimension is introduced. In the model, the scalar couples to multiple\nvector-like fermions, which are just the KK modes of SM fermions. Mediated by\nthe loops of these vector-like fermions, the $\\phi$ effective couplings to\ngluons and photons can be significantly large. Therefore, it is quite easy to\nobtain an observed cross section for the diphoton excess. We also calculate the\ncross sections for other decay channels of $\\phi$, and find that this\ninterpretation can evade the bounds from the 8~TeV LHC data.\n", "  We interpret the diphoton anomaly as a heavy scalar $H_3$ in the so-called\n331 model. The scalar is responsible for breaking the $SU(3)_C\\otimes\nSU(3)_L\\otimes U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry down to the standard model electroweak\ngauge group. It mainly couples to the standard model gluons and photons through\nquantum loops involving heavy quarks and leptons. Those quarks and leptons, in\ntogether with the SM quarks and leptons, form the fundamental representation of\nthe 331 model. We use low energy theorem to calculate effective coupling of\n$H_3gg$, $H_3\\gamma\\gamma$, $H_3ZZ$, $H_3WW$ and $H_3Z\\gamma$. The analytical\nresults can be applied to new physics models satisfying the low energy theorem.\nWe show that the heavy quark and lepton contribution cannot produce enough\ndiphoton pairs. It is crucial to include the contribution of charged scalars to\nexplain the diphoton excess. The extra neutral $Z^\\prime$ boson could also\nexplain the 2 TeV diboson excess observed at the LHC Run-I.\n", "  Although known that single domain proteins fold and unfold by parallel\npathways, demonstration of this expectation has been difficult to establish in\nexperiments. Unfolding rate, $k_\\mathrm{u}(f)$, as a function of force $f$,\nobtained in single molecule pulling experiments on src SH3 domain, exhibits\nupward curvature on a $\\log k_\\mathrm{u}(f)$ plot. Similar observations were\nreported for other proteins for the unfolding rate $k_\\mathrm{u}([C])$. These\nfindings imply unfolding in these single domain proteins involves a switch in\nthe pathway as $f$ or $[C]$ is increased from a low to a high value. We provide\na unified theory demonstrating that if $\\log k_\\mathrm{u}$ as a function of a\nperturbation ($f$ or $[C]$) exhibits upward curvature then the underlying\nenergy landscape must be strongly multidimensional. Using molecular simulations\nwe provide a structural basis for the switch in the pathways and dramatic\nshifts in the transition state ensemble (TSE) in src SH3 domain as $f$ is\nincreased. We show that a single point mutation shifts the upward curvature in\n$\\log k_\\mathrm{u}(f)$ to a lower force, thus establishing the malleability of\nthe underlying folding landscape. Our theory, applicable to any perturbation\nthat affects the free energy of the protein linearly, readily explains movement\nin the TSE in a $\\beta$-sandwich (I27) protein and single chain monellin as the\ndenaturant concentration is varied. We predict that in the force range\naccessible in laser optical tweezer experiments there should be a switch in the\nunfolding pathways in I27 or its mutants.\n", "  An expression is obtained on the basis of phase perturbation theory for the\ncontribution to the mean differential reflection coefficient from the in-plane\nco-polarized component of the light scattered diffusely from a two-dimensional\nrandomly rough dielectric surface when the latter is illuminated by s-polarized\nlight. This result forms the basis for an approach to inverting experimental\nlight scattering data to obtain the normalized surface height autocorrelation\nfunction of the surface. Several parametrized forms of this correlation\nfunction, and the minimization of a cost function with respect to the\nparameters defining these representations, are used in the inversion scheme.\nThis approach also yields the rms height of the surface roughness, and the\ndielectric constant of the dielectric substrate if it is not known in advance.\nThe input data used in validating this inversion consists of computer\nsimulation results for surfaces defined by exponential and Gaussian surface\nheight correlation functions, without and with the addition of multiplicative\nnoise, for a single or multiple angles of incidence. The reconstructions\nobtained by this approach are quite accurate for weakly rough surfaces, and the\nproposed inversion scheme is computationally efficient.\n", "  We revisit the analysis made by Hwang and Noh [JCAP 1310 (2013)] aiming the\nconstruction of a Newtonian set of equations incorporating pressure effects\ntypical of the General Relativity theory. We explicitly derive the Hwang-Noh\nequations, comparing them with similar computations found in the literature.\nThen, we investigate $i)$ the cosmological expansion, $ii)$ linear cosmological\nperturbations theory and $iii)$ stellar equilibrium by using the new set of\nequations and comparing the results with those coming from the usual Newtonian\ntheory, from the Neo-Newtonian theory and from the General Relativity theory.\nWe show that the predictions for the background evolution of the Universe are\ndeeply changed with respect to the General Relativity theory: the acceleration\nof the Universe is achieved with positive pressure. On the other hand, the\nbehaviour of small cosmological perturbations reproduces the one found in the\nrelativistic context, even if only at small scales. We argue that this last\nresult may open new possibilities for numerical simulations for structure\nformation in the Universe. Finally, the properties of neutron stars are\nqualitatively reproduced by Hwang-Noh equations, but the upper mass limit is at\nleast one order of magnitude higher than the one obtained in General\nRelativity.\n", "  We discuss the characteristic low energy phenomenological implications of an\nSU(5) Supersymmetric Grand Unified Theory (SUSY GUT) whose flavour structure is\ncontrolled by the family symmetry S4 x U(1), which provides a good description\nof all quark and lepton masses, mixings as well as CP violation. Although the\nmodel closely mimics Minimal Flavour Violation (MFV) as shown in\narXiv:1511.07886, here we focus on the differences. We first present numerical\nestimates of the low energy mass insertion parameters, including canonical\nnormalisation and renormalisation group running, for well-defined ranges of\nSUSY parameters and compare the naive model expectations to the numerical scans\nand the experimental bounds. Our results are then used to estimate the\nmodel-specific predictions for Electric Dipole Moments (EDMs), Lepton Flavour\nViolation (LFV), B and K meson mixing as well as rare B decays. The largest\nobservable deviations from MFV come from the LFV process mu --> e gamma and the\nelectron EDM.\n", "  Prompt neutrino fluxes are basic backgrounds in the search of high-energy\nneutrinos of astrophysical origin, performed by means of full-size neutrino\ntelescopes located at Earth, under ice or under water. Predictions for these\nfluxes are provided on the basis of up-to-date theoretical results for charm\nhadroproduction in perturbative QCD, together with a comprehensive discussion\nof the various sources of theoretical uncertainty affecting their computation,\nand a quantitative estimate of each uncertainty contribution.\n", "  High resolution X-ray spectra of black hole X-ray binaries (BHBs) show\nblueshifted absorption lines from disk winds which seem to be equatorial. Winds\noccur in the Softer (disk-dominated) states of the outburst and are less\nprominent or absent in the Harder (power-law dominated) states. We use\nself-similar magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) accretion-ejection models to explain\nthe disk winds in BHBs. In our models, the density at the base of the outflow\nfrom the accretion disk is not a free parameter, but is determined by solving\nthe full set of dynamical MHD equations. Thus the physical properties of the\noutflow are controlled by the global structure of the disk. We studied\ndifferent MHD solutions characterized by different values of (a) the disk\naspect ratio ($\\varepsilon$) and (b) the ejection efficiency ($p$). We use two\nkinds of MHD solutions depending on the absence (cold solution) or presence\n(warm solution) of heating at the disk surface. Such heating could be from e.g.\ndissipation of energy due to MHD turbulence in the disk or from illumination.\nWe use each of these MHD solutions to predict the physical parameters of an\noutflow; put limits on the ionization parameter ($\\xi$), column density and\ntimescales, motivated by observational results; and thus select regions within\nthe outflow which are consistent with the observed winds. The cold MHD\nsolutions cannot account for winds due to their low ejection efficiency. But\nwarm solutions can explain the observed physical quantities in the wind because\nthey can have sufficiently high values of $p$ ($\\gtrsim 0.1$, implying larger\nmass loading at the base of the outflow). Further from our thermodynamic\nequilibrium curve analysis for the outflowing gas, we found that in the Hard\nstate a range of $\\xi$ is thermodynamically unstable, and had to be excluded.\nThis constrain made it impossible to have any wind at all, in the Hard state.\n", "  In this article we obtain a new anisotropic solution for Einstein's field\nequation of embedding class one metric. The solution is representing the\nrealistic objects such as $Her~X-1$ and $RXJ~1856-37$. We perform detailed\ninvestigation of both objects by solving numerically the Einstein field\nequations under with anisotropic pressure. The physical features of the\nparameters depend on the anisotropic factor i.e. if anisotropy is zero\neverywhere inside the star then the density and pressures will become zero and\nmetric turns out to be flat. We report our results and compare with the above\nmentioned two compact objects on a number of key aspects: the central density,\nthe surface density onset and the critical scaling behavior, the effective mass\nand radius ratio, the anisotropization with isotropic initial conditions,\nadiabatic index and red shift. Along with this we have also made a comparison\nbetween the classical limit and theoretical model treatment of the compact\nobjects. Finally we discuss the implications of our findings for the stability\ncondition in relativistic compact star.\n", "  We investigate the loss rates of the hydrogen atmospheres of terrestrial\nplanets with a range of masses and orbital distances by assuming a stellar\nextreme ultraviolet (EUV) luminosity that is 100 times stronger than that of\nthe current Sun. We apply a 1D upper atmosphere radiation absorption and\nhydrodynamic escape model that takes into account ionization, dissociation and\nrecombination to calculate hydrogen mass loss rates. We study the effects of\nthe ionization, dissociation and recombination on the thermal mass loss rates\nof hydrogen-dominated super-Earths and compare the results to those obtained by\nthe energy-limited escape formula which is widely used for mass loss evolution\nstudies. Our results indicate that the energy-limited formula can to a great\nextent over- or underestimate the hydrogen mass loss rates by amounts that\ndepend on the stellar EUV flux and planetary parameters such as mass, size,\neffective temperature, and EUV absorption radius.\n", "  Motivated by recent experimental progress in the context of ultra-cold\nmulti-color fermionic atoms in optical lattices, we have developed a method to\nexactly diagonalize the Heisenberg $SU(N)$ Hamiltonian with several particles\nper site living in a fully symmetric or antisymmetric representation of\n$SU(N)$. The method, based on the use of standard Young tableaux, takes\nadvantage of the full $SU(N)$ symmetry, allowing one to work directly in each\nirreducible representations of the global $SU(N)$ group. Since the $SU(N)$\nsinglet sector is often much smaller than the full Hilbert space, this enables\none to reach much larger system sizes than with conventional exact\ndiagonalizations. The method is applied to the study of Heisenberg chains in\nthe symmetric representation with two and three particles per site up to $N=10$\nand up to 20 sites. For the length scales accessible to this approach, all\nsystems except the Haldane chain ($SU(2)$ with two particles per site) appear\nto be gapless, and the central charge and scaling dimensions extracted from the\nresults are consistent with a critical behaviour in the $SU(N)$ level $k$\nWess-Zumino-Witten universality class, where $k$ is the number of particles per\nsite. These results point to the existence of a cross-over between this\nuniversality class and the asymptotic low-energy behavior with a gapped\nspectrum or a critical behavior in the $SU(N)$ level $1$ WZW universality\nclass.\n", "  We present a new method of conducting molecular dynamics simulation in\nisothermal-isobaric ensemble based on Langevin equations of motion. The\nstochastic coupling to all particle and cell degrees of freedoms is introduced\nin a correct way, in the sense that the stationary configurational distribution\nis proved to be in consistent with that of the isothermal-isobaric ensemble. In\norder to apply the proposed method in computer simulations, a second order\nsymmetric numerical integration scheme is developed by Trotter's splitting of\nthe single-step propagator. Moreover, a practical guide of choosing working\nparameters is suggested for user specified thermo- and baro-coupling\ntime-scales. The method and software implementation are carefully validated by\na numerical example.\n", "  Motivated by the recent LHC discovery of the di-photon excess at the\ninvariant mass of ~ 750 GeV, we study the prospect of investigating the scalar\nresonance at a future photon-photon collider. We show that, if the di-photon\nexcess observed at the LHC is due to a new scalar boson coupled to the\nstandard-model gauge bosons, such a scalar boson can be observed and studied at\nthe photon-photon collider with the center-of-mass energy of ~ 1 TeV in large\nfraction of parameter space.\n", "  It is usually assumed that the inflationary fluctuations start from the\nBunch-Davies (BD) vacuum and the $i\\varepsilon$ prescription is used when\ninteractions are calculated. We show that those assumptions can be verified\nexplicitly by calculating the loop corrections to the inflationary two-point\nand three-point correlation functions. Those loop corrections can be resumed to\nexponential factors, which suppress non-BD coefficients and behave as the\n$i\\varepsilon$ factor for the case of the BD initial condition. A new technique\nof loop chain diagram resummation is developed for this purpose. For the non-BD\ninitial conditions which is setup at finite time and has not fully decayed,\nexplicit correction to the two-point and three-point correlation functions are\ncalculated. Especially, non-Gaussianity in the folded limit is regularized due\nto the interactions.\n", "  The fourth post-Newtonian (4PN) two-body dynamics has been recently tackled\nby several different approaches: effective field theory, Arnowitt-Deser-Misner\nHamiltonian, action-angle-Delaunay averaging, effective-one-body, gravitational\nself-force, first law of dynamics, and Fokker action. We review the\nachievements of these approaches and discuss the complementarity of their\nresults. Our main conclusions are: (i) the results of the first complete\nderivation of the 4PN dynamics [T.Damour, P.Jaranowski, and G.Sch\\\"afer, Phys.\nRev. D 89, 064058 (2014)] have been, piecewise, fully confirmed by several\nsubsequent works; (ii) the results of the Delaunay-averaging technique\n[T.Damour, P.Jaranowski, and G.Sch\\\"afer, Phys. Rev. D 91, 084024 (2015)] have\nbeen confirmed by several independent works; and (iii) several claims in a\nrecent Fokker-action computation [L.Bernard et al., arXiv:1512.02876v2 [gr-qc]]\nare incorrect, but can be corrected by the addition of a couple of ambiguity\nparameters linked to subtleties in the regularization of infrared and\nultraviolet divergences.\n", "  We explore field theories of a single p-form with equations of motions of\norder strictly equal to two and gauge invariance. We give a general method for\nthe classification of such theories which are extensions to the p-forms of the\nGalileon models for scalars. Our classification scheme allows to compute an\nupper bound on the number of different such theories depending on p and on the\nspace-time dimension. We are also able to build a non trivial Galileon like\ntheory for a 3-form with gauge invariance and an action which is polynomial\ninto the derivatives of the form. This theory has gauge invariant field\nequations but an action which is not, like a Chern-Simons theory. Hence the\nrecently discovered no-go theorem stating that there are no non trivial gauge\ninvariant vector Galileons (which we are also able here to confirm with our\nmethod) does not extend to other odd p cases.\n", "  We describe in detail the methods used to obtain the lower bound on the\nlifetime of neutrinoless double-beta ($0\\nu\\beta\\beta$) decay in $^{130}$Te and\nthe associated limit on the effective Majorana mass of the neutrino using the\nCUORE-0 detector. CUORE-0 is a bolometric detector array located at the\nLaboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso that was designed to validate the\nbackground reduction techniques developed for CUORE, a next-generation\nexperiment scheduled to come online in 2016. CUORE-0 is also a competitive\n$0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay search in its own right and functions as a platform to\nfurther develop the analysis tools and procedures to be used in CUORE. These\ninclude data collection, event selection and processing, as well as an\nevaluation of signal efficiency. In particular, we describe the amplitude\nevaluation, thermal gain stabilization, energy calibration methods, and the\nanalysis event selection used to create our final $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay search\nspectrum. We define our high level analysis procedures, with emphasis on the\nnew insights gained and challenges encountered. We outline in detail our\nfitting methods near the hypothesized $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay peak and catalog\nthe main sources of systematic uncertainty. Finally, we derive the\n$0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay half-life limits previously reported for CUORE-0,\n$T^{0\\nu}_{1/2}>2.7\\times10^{24}$ yr, and in combination with the Cuoricino\nlimit, $T^{0\\nu}_{1/2}>4.0\\times10^{24}$ yr.\n", "  Planktonic copepods are small crustaceans that have the ability to swim by\nquick powerful jumps. Such an aptness is used to escape from high shear\nregions, which may be caused either by flow per- turbations, produced by a\nlarge predator (i.e., fish larvae), or by the inherent highly turbulent\ndynamics of the ocean. Through a combined experimental and numerical study, we\ninvestigate the impact of jumping behaviour on the small-scale patchiness of\ncopepods in a turbulent environment. Recorded velocity tracks of copepods\ndisplaying escape response jumps in still water are here used to define and\ntune a Lagrangian Copepod (LC) model. The model is further employed to simulate\nthe behaviour of thousands of copepods in a fully developed hydrodynamic\nturbulent flow obtained by direct numerical simulation of the Navier-Stokes\nequations. First, we show that the LC velocity statistics is in qualitative\nagreement with available experimental observations of copepods in tur- bulence.\nSecond, we quantify the clustering of LC, via the fractal dimension $D_2$. We\nshow that $D_2$ can be as low as ~ 2.3 and that it critically depends on the\nshear-rate sensitivity of the proposed LC model, in particular it exhibits a\nminimum in a narrow range of shear-rate values. We further investigate the\neffect of jump intensity, jump orientation and geometrical aspect ratio of the\ncopepods on the small-scale spatial distribution. At last, possible ecological\nimplications of the observed clustering on encounter rates and mating success\nare discussed\n", "  Single-crystalline \\beta-Ag2Se nanostructures, a new class of 3D topological\ninsulators (TIs), were synthesized using the chemical vapor transport method.\nThe topological surface states were verified by measuring electronic transport\nproperties including the weak antilocalization effect, Aharonov-Bohm\noscillations, and Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations. First-principles band\ncalculations revealed that the band inversion in \\b{eta}-Ag2Se is caused by\nstrong spin-orbit coupling and Ag-Se bonding hybridization. These extensive\ninvestigations provide new meaningful information about silver-chalcogenide TIs\nthat have anisotropic Dirac cones, which could be useful for spintronics\napplications.\n", "  The 2 Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) of type III has renormalisable Lepton\nFlavour-Violating couplings, and its one and two-loop (\"Barr-Zee\")\ncontributions to $\\mu \\to e \\gamma$ are known. In the decoupling limit, where\nthe mass scale M of the second doublet is much greater than the electroweak\nscale, the model can be parametrised with an Effective Field Theory(EFT)\ncontaining dimension six operators. The $1/M^2$ terms of the exact calculation\nare reproduced in the EFT, provided that the four-fermion operator basis below\nthe weak scale is enlarged with respect to the SU(2)-invariant Buchmuller-Wyler\nlist. The two-loop \"Barr-Zee\" contributions are located in the EFT, showing\nthat two-loop matching and running would be required to obtain the most\nimportant contributions, and that dimension eight operators can be numerically\nrelevant.\n", "  The spatial and temporal distributions of solar filaments were analyzed using\ndata from the Meudon Observatory for the period 1919-2003 and the Kislovodsk\nMountain Astronomical Station for the period 1979-2014. We scanned $H_\\alpha$\nsolar synoptic charts on which the filaments were isolated and digitized. The\ndata on each filament comprise its location, length, area, and other\ngeometrical characteristics. The temporal distributions of the number and total\nlength of the filaments have been obtained. We also found latitudinal migration\nof filament locations with the solar cycle, and analyzed the longitudinal\ndistribution and asymmetry of filaments in the northern and southern\nhemispheres, and other properties of their distribution.\n  The tilt angles of filaments with respect the solar equator ($\\tau$) were\nanalyzed. On average, the eastern tips of filaments are closer to the poles\nthan the western ones ($\\tau \\sim 10^\\circ$). On the other hand, the filaments\nin the polar regions ($\\theta>50^\\circ$, where $\\theta$ is the latitude)\nusually have negative tilts ($\\tau <0^\\circ$). The tilt angles vary with the\nphases of the 11 year sunspot cycle and are at their highest values in the\nepoch of the activity maximum. In the century-long modulation of the solar\nactivity (Gleissberg cycle), the mean tilt angles of filaments in the\nmid-latitude zone ($\\theta \\sim \\pm 40^\\circ$) were maximum in the middle of\nthe 20th century in solar sunspot cycles 18-19. We hereby propose using the\nstatistical properties of solar filaments as an additional coherent measure of\nmanifestation of the solar cycle which covers all latitudes and for which\nalmost a century long systematically calibrated data series is available.\n", "  In this work, we present a new and general method for measuring the\nastrophysical S-factor of nuclear reactions in laser-induced plasmas and we\napply it to d(d,n)$^{3}$He. The experiment was performed with the Texas\nPetawatt laser, which delivered 150-270 fs pulses of energy ranging from 90 to\n180 J to D$_{2}$ or CD$_{4}$ molecular clusters. After removing the background\nnoise, we used the measured time-of-flight data of energetic deuterium ions to\nobtain their energy distribution. We derive the S-factor using the measured\nenergy distribution of the ions, the measured volume of the fusion plasma and\nthe measured fusion yields. This method is model-independent in the sense that\nno assumption on the state of the system is required, but it requires an\naccurate measurement of the ion energy distribution especially at high energies\nand of the relevant fusion yields. In the d(d,n)$^{3}$He and\n$^{3}$He(d,p)$^{4}$He cases discussed here, it is very important to apply the\nbackground subtraction for the energetic ions and to measure the fusion yields\nwith high precision. While the available data on both ion distribution and\nfusion yields allow us to determine with good precision the S-factor in the d+d\ncase (lower Gamow energies), for the d+$^3$He case the data are not precise\nenough to obtain the S-factor using this method. Our results agree with other\nexperiments within the experimental error, even though smaller values of the\nS-factor were obtained. This might be due to the plasma environment differing\nfrom the beam target conditions in a conventional accelerator experiment.\n", "  We study orbital and spin-orbit proximity effects in graphene adsorbed to the\nCu(111) surface by means of density functional theory (DFT). The proximity\neffects are caused mainly by the hybridization of graphene $\\pi$ and copper d\norbitals. Our electronic structure calculations agree well with the\nexperimentally observed features. We carry out a graphene-Cu(111) distance\ndependent study to obtain proximity orbital and spin-orbit coupling parameters,\nby fitting the DFT results to a robust low energy model Hamiltonian. We find a\nstrong distance dependence of the Rashba and intrinsic proximity induced\nspin-orbit coupling parameters, which are in the meV and hundreds of $\\mu$eV\nrange, respectively, for experimentally relevant distances. The Dirac spectrum\nof graphene also exhibits a proximity orbital gap, of about 20 meV.\nFurthermore, we find a band inversion within the graphene states accompanied by\na reordering of spin and pseudospin states, when graphene is pressed towards\ncopper.\n", "  We report on the realization of a single-electron source, where current is\ntransported through a single-level quantum dot (Q), tunnel-coupled to two\nsuperconducting leads (S). When driven with an ac gate voltage, the experiment\ndemonstrates electron turnstile operation. Compared to the more conventional\nsuperconductor - normal metal - superconductor turnstile, our SQS device\npresents a number of novel properties, including higher immunity to the\nunavoidable presence of non-equilibrium quasiparticles in superconducting\nleads. In addition, we demonstrate its ability to deliver electrons with a very\nnarrow energy distribution.\n", "  As a result of our limited data on reionization, the total optical depth for\nelectron scattering, $\\tau$, limits precision measurements of cosmological\nparameters from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). It was recently shown\nthat the predicted 21-cm signal of neutral hydrogen contains enough information\nto reconstruct $\\tau$ with sub-percent accuracy, assuming that the neutral gas\nwas much hotter than the CMB throughout the entire epoch of reionization. Here\nwe relax this assumption and use the global 21-cm signal alone to extract\n$\\tau$ for realistic X-ray heating scenarios. We test our model-independent\napproach using mock data for a wide range of ionization and heating histories\nand show that an accurate measurement of the reionization optical depth at a\nsub-percent level is possible in most of the considered scenarios even when\nheating is not saturated during the epoch of reionization, assuming that the\nforegrounds are mitigated. However, we find that in cases where heating sources\nhad hard X-ray spectra and their luminosity was close to or lower than what is\npredicted based on low-redshift observations, the global 21-cm signal alone is\nnot a good tracer of the reionization history.\n", "  Macroscopic entropy production $\\sigma^{(tot)}$ in the general nonlinear\nisothermal chemical reaction system with mass action kinetics is decomposed\ninto a free energy dissipation and a house-keeping heat:\n$\\sigma^{(tot)}=\\sigma^{(fd)}+\\sigma^{(hk)}$; $\\sigma^{(fd)}=-\\rd A/\\rd t$,\nwhere $A$ is a generalized free energy function. This yields a novel\nnonequilibrium free energy balance equation $\\rd A/\\rd\nt=-\\sigma^{(tot)}+\\sigma^{(hk)}$, which is on a par with celebrated entropy\nbalance equation $\\rd S/\\rd t=\\sigma^{(tot)}+\\eta^{(ex)}$ where $\\eta^{(ex)}$\nis the rate of entropy exchange with the environment.For kinetic systems with\ncomplex balance, $\\sigma^{(fd)}$ and $\\sigma^{(hk)}$ are the macroscopic limits\nof stochastic free energy dissipation and house-keeping heat, which are both\nnonnegative, in the Delbr\\\"uck-Gillespie description of the stochastic chemical\nkinetics.Therefore, we show that a full kinetic and thermodynamic theory of\nchemical reaction systems that transcends mesoscopic and macroscopic levels\nemerges.\n", "  We study the inhomogeneous solitonic modulation of a chiral condensate within\nthe effective Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model when a constant external magnetic field\nis present. The self-consistent Pauli-Villars regularization scheme is adopted\nto manipulate the ultraviolet divergence encountered in the thermodynamic\nquantities. In order to determine the chiral restoration lines efficiently, a\nnew kind of Ginzburg-Landau expansion approach is proposed here. At zero\ntemperature, we find that both the upper and lower boundaries of the solitonic\nmodulation oscillate with the magnetic field in the $\\mu$--$B$ phase diagram\nwhich is actually the de Hass-van Alphan (dHvA) oscillation. It is very\ninteresting to find out how the tricritical Lifshitz point $(T_L,\\mu_L)$\nevolves with the magnetic field: There are also dHvA oscillations in the\n$T_L$--$B$ and $\\mu_L$--$B$ curves, though the tricritical temperature $T_L$\nincreases monotonically with the magnetic field.\n", "  We investigate the static, spherically symmetric black hole solutions in the\nquasi-dilaton model and its generalizations, which are scalar extended dRGT\nmassive gravity with a shift symmetry. We show that, unlike generic scalar\nextended massive gravity models, these theories do not admit static,\nspherically symmetric black hole solutions until the theory parameters in the\ndRGT potential is fine-tuned. When fine-tuned, the geometry of the static,\nspherically symmetric black hole is necessarily that of general relativity and\nthe quasi-dilaton field is constant across the spacetime. The fine-tuning and\nthe no hair theorem apply to black holes with flat, anti-de Sitter or de Sitter\nasymptotics.\n", "  The correlation between the transverse momentum and the azimuthal asymmetry\nthe flow is studied. A correlation coefficient is defined between the average\ntransverse momentum of hadrons emitted in an event and the square of the\nelliptic or triangular flow coefficient. The hydrodynamic model predicts a\npositive correlation of the transverse momentum with the elliptic flow, and\nalmost no correlation with the triangular flow in Pb-Pb collisions at LHC\nenergies. In p-Pb collisions the new correlation observable is very sensitive\nto the mechanism of energy deposition in the first stage of the collision.\n", "  We present a modified Altarelli and Feruglio $A_4$ model where an additional\n$A_4$ singlet-prime flavon is introduced. In this model, non-zero $\\theta\n_{13}$ is given by this additional $A_4$ singlet-prime flavon which breaks\ntri-bimaximal mixing. In the framework of the supersymmetry with $U(1)_R$\nsymmetry, we obtain vacuum expectation values (VEVs) and VEV alignments of\nflavons through driving fields. It is considered that flavon induces\ndistinctive flavor violating process if flavon mass is light. Assuming mass of\nSUSY particles are sufficiently heavy so that the SUSY contributions can be\nnegligible, we discuss the flavor violating Yukawa interaction through flavon\nexchange in the charged lepton sector. According to the potential analysis, the\nVEV of flavon breaks $A_4$ down to $Z_3$ in the charged lepton sector and\nrelation among flavon masses is determined. Thanks for the residual $Z_3$\nsymmetry, many lepton flavor violating decay modes are forbidden except for\n$\\tau \\rightarrow \\mu \\mu \\bar{e}$ and $\\tau \\rightarrow e e \\bar{\\mu}$. A mass\nlimit of the flavon from these three-body decay modes is $60$~GeV taking into\naccount the current experimental lower bounds at the Belle experiment. In our\nmodel, we predict a ratio of the branching ratios $\\tau \\rightarrow \\mu \\mu\n\\bar{e}$ and $\\tau \\rightarrow e e \\bar{\\mu}$ by using known charged lepton\nmasses. We also find that the production cross section for the flavon can be\n$\\mathcal{O}(1)$ fb. Thus the flavon would be found at the LHC run 2 by\nsearching for 4-tau lepton signal.\n", "  We revisit the bottomonium spectrum motivated by the recently exciting\nexperimental progress in the observation of new bottomonium states, both\nconventional and unconventional. Our framework is a nonrelativistic constituent\nquark model which has been applied to a wide range of hadronic observables from\nthe light to the heavy quark sector and thus the model parameters are\ncompletely constrained. Beyond the spectrum, we provide a large number of\nelectromagnetic, strong and hadronic decays in order to discuss the quark\ncontent of the bottomonium states and give more insights about the better way\nto determine their properties experimentally.\n", "  The ubiquity of M dwarfs, combined with the relative ease of detecting\nterrestrial-mass planets around them, has made them prime targets for finding\nand characterising planets in the \"Habitable Zone\" (HZ). However, Kepler finds\nthat terrestrial-mass exoplanets are often born with voluminous H/He envelopes,\ncomprising mass-fractions ($M_{env}/M_{core}$) $\\gtrsim 1$%. If these planets\nretain such envelopes over Gyr timescales, they will not be \"habitable\" even\nwithin the HZ. Given the strong X-ray/UV fluxes of M dwarfs, we study whether\nsufficient envelope mass can be photoevaporated away for these planets to\nbecome habitable. We improve upon previous work by using hydrodynamic models\nthat account for radiative cooling as well as the transition from hydrodynamic\nto ballistic escape. Adopting a template active M dwarf XUV spectrum, including\nstellar evolution, and considering both evaporation and thermal evolution, we\nshow that: (1) the mass-loss is (considerably) lower than previous estimates\nthat use an \"energy-limited\" formalism and ignore the transition to Jeans\nescape, (2) at the inner edge of the HZ, planets with core mass $\\lesssim 0.9$\nM$_\\oplus$, can lose enough H/He to become habitable if their initial envelope\nmass-fraction is $\\sim$1%, (3) at the outer edge of the HZ, evaporation cannot\nremove a $\\sim$1% H/He envelope even from cores down to 0.8 M$_\\oplus$. Thus,\nif planets form with bulky H/He envelopes, only those with low-mass cores may\neventually be habitable. Cores $\\gtrsim$ 1 M$_\\oplus$, with $\\gtrsim$1% natal\nH/He envelopes, will not be habitable in the HZ of M dwarfs.\n", "  We present a detailed study of the colours in late-type galaxy discs for ten\nof the EDisCS galaxy clusters with 0.5 < z < 0.8. Our cluster sample contains\n172 spiral galaxies, and our control sample is composed of 96 field disc\ngalaxies. We deconvolve their ground-based V and I images obtained with FORS2\nat the VLT with initial spatial resolutions between 0.4 and 0.8 arcsec to\nachieve a final resolution of 0.1 arcsec with 0.05 arcsec pixels, which is\nclose to the resolution of the ACS at the HST. After removing the central\nregion of each galaxy to avoid pollution by the bulges, we measured the V-I\ncolours of the discs. We find that 50% of cluster spiral galaxies have disc V-I\ncolours redder by more than 1 sigma of the mean colours of their field\ncounterparts. This is well above the 16% expected for a normal distribution\ncentred on the field disc properties. The prominence of galaxies with red discs\ndepends neither on the mass of their parent cluster nor on the distance of the\ngalaxies to the cluster cores. Passive spiral galaxies constitute 20% of our\nsample. These systems are not abnormally dusty. They are are made of old stars\nand are located on the cluster red sequences. Another 24% of our sample is\ncomposed of galaxies that are still active and star forming, but less so than\ngalaxies with similar morphologies in the field. These galaxies are naturally\nlocated in the blue sequence of their parent cluster colour-magnitude diagrams.\nThe reddest of the discs in clusters must have stopped forming stars more than\n~5 Gyr ago. Some of them are found among infalling galaxies, suggesting\npreprocessing. Our results confirm that galaxies are able to continue forming\nstars for some significant period of time after being accreted into clusters,\nand suggest that star formation can decline on seemingly long (1 to 5 Gyr)\ntimescales.\n", "  Very large volume neutrino telescopes (VLVNTs) observe atmospheric neutrinos\nover a wide energy range (GeV to TeV), after they travel distances as large as\nthe Earth's diameter. DeepCore, the low energy extension of IceCube, has\nstarted making meaningful measurements of the neutrino oscillation parameters\n$\\theta_{23}$ and $|\\Delta m^2_{32}|$ by analyzing the atmospheric flux at\nenergies above 10 GeV. PINGU, a proposed project to lower DeepCore's energy\nthreshold, aims to use the same flux to further increase the precision with\nwhich these parameters are known, and eventually determine the sign of $\\Delta\nm^2_{32}$. The latest results from DeepCore, and the planned transition to\nPINGU, are discussed here.\n", "  The $B_s^0 \\rightarrow J/\\psi \\phi \\phi$ decay is observed in $pp$ collision\ndata corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3 fb$^{-1}$ recorded by the\nLHCb detector at centre-of-mass energies of 7 TeV and 8 TeV. This is the first\nobservation of this decay channel, with a statistical significance of 15\nstandard deviations. The mass of the $B_s^0$ meson is measured to be\n$5367.08\\,\\pm \\,0.38\\,\\pm\\, 0.15$ MeV/c$^2$. The branching fraction ratio\n$\\mathcal{B}(B_s^0 \\rightarrow J/\\psi \\phi \\phi)/\\mathcal{B}(B_s^0 \\rightarrow\nJ/\\psi \\phi)$ is measured to be $0.0115\\,\\pm\\, 0.0012\\, ^{+0.0005}_{-0.0009}$.\nIn both cases, the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is\nsystematic. No evidence for non-resonant $B_s^0 \\rightarrow J/\\psi \\phi K^+\nK^-$ or $B_s^0 \\rightarrow J/\\psi K^+ K^- K^+ K^-$ decays is found.\n", "  The collective electronic excitations of arrays of Au chains on regularly\nstepped Si(553) and Si(775) surfaces were studied using electron loss\nspectroscopy with simultaneous high energy and momentum resolution (ELS-LEED)\nin combination with low energy electron diffraction (SPA-LEED) and tunneling\nmicroscopy. Both surfaces contain a double chain of gold atoms per terrace.\nAlthough one-dimensional metallicity and plasmon dispersion is observed only\nalong the wires, two-dimensional effects are important, since plasmon\ndispersion explicitly depends both on the structural motif of the wires and the\nterrace width. The electron density on each terrace turns out to be modulated,\nas seen by tunneling spectroscopy (STS). The effective wire width of 7.5\\,\\AA\\\nfor Si(553)-Au -- 10.2\\,\\AA\\ for Si(775)-Au -- , determined from plasmon\ndispersion is in good agreement with STS data. Clear evidence for coupling\nbetween wires is seen beyond nearest neighbor coupling.\n", "  The effects of power-law Maxwell field on the Van der Waals like phase\ntransition of higher-dimensional dilaton black holes are probed in detail. It\nis shown that the Smarr relation gains corrections due to the effects of both\nthe power-law Maxwell field and the dilaton field while thermodynamic volume is\nexactly the same as that of Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton black holes. We\nsuccessfully derive the analytic solutions of critical point and carry out some\ncheck to ensure that these critical quantities are positive. It is shown that\nthe constraint on the parameters turns out to be $0<\\alpha^2<1$, which is more\ntighter than that in the non-extended phase space. It is also shown that these\ncritical quantities and the ratio $P_cv_c/T_c$ are affected by the power-law\nMaxwell field. Moreover, critical exponents are found to coincide with those of\nother AdS black holes, showing the powerful influence of mean field theory.\n", "  We present observations of the $^{12}$CO(6-5) line and 686GHz continuum\nemission in NGC253 with the Submillimeter Array at an angular resolution of\n~4arcsec. The $^{12}$CO(6-5) emission is clearly detected along the disk and\nfollows the distribution of the lower $^{12}$CO line transitions with little\nvariations of the line ratios in it. A large-velocity gradient analysis\nsuggests a two-temperature model of the molecular gas in the disk, likely\ndominated by a combination of low-velocity shocks and the disk wide PDRs. Only\nmarginal $^{12}$CO(6-5) emission is detected in the vicinity of the expanding\nshells at the eastern and western edges of the disk. While the eastern shell\ncontains gas even warmer (T$_{\\rm kin}$>300~K) than the hot gas component\n(T$_{\\rm kin}$=300K) of the disk, the western shell is surrounded by gas much\ncooler (T$_{\\rm kin}$=60K) than the eastern shell but somewhat hotter than the\ncold gas component of the disk (for similar H$_2$ and CO column densities),\nindicative of different (or differently efficient) heating mechansisms. The\ncontinuum emission at 686GHz in the disk agrees well in shape and size with\nthat at lower (sub-)millimeter frequencies, exhibiting a spectral index\nconsistent with thermal dust emission. We find dust temperatures of ~10-30K and\nlargely optically thin emission. However, our fits suggest a second (more\noptically thick) dust component at higher temperatures (T$_{\\rm d}$>60K),\nsimilar to the molecular gas. We estimate a global dust mass of ~10$^6$Msun for\nthe disk translating into a gas-to-dust mass ratio of a few hundred consistent\nwith other nearby active galaxies.\n", "  The MiniBooNE large axial mass anomaly has prompted a great deal of\ntheoretical work on sophisticated Charged Current Quasi-Elastic (CCQE) neutrino\ninteraction models in recent years. As the dominant interaction mode at T2K\nenergies, and the signal process in oscillation analyses, it is important for\nthe T2K experiment to include realistic CCQE cross section uncertainties in T2K\nanalyses. To this end, T2K's Neutrino Interaction Working Group has implemented\na number of recent models in NEUT, T2K's primary neutrino interaction event\ngenerator. In this paper, we give an overview of the models implemented, and\npresent fits to published muon neutrino and muon antineutrino CCQE cross\nsection measurements from the MiniBooNE and MINERvA experiments. The results of\nthe fits are used to select a default cross section model for future T2K\nanalyses, and to constrain the cross section uncertainties of the model. We\nfind a model consisting of a modified relativistic Fermi gas model and\nmultinucleon interactions most consistently describes the available data.\n", "  This paper is the third in a series of ammonia multilevel imaging studies in\nwell-known high-mass star forming regions. Using the JVLA, we have mapped the\nhot and dense molecular gas in W51 Main, with about 0.2 arcsec angular\nresolution, in five highly-excited metastable inversion transitions of ammonia\n(ammonia): (J,K)=(6,6), (7,7), (9,9), (10,10), and (13,13). We have identified\nand characterised two main centers of high-mass star formation in W51-Main: the\nW51e2 complex and the W51e8 core (6 arcsec southward of W51e2). The former\nbreaks down into three further sub-cores: W51e2-W, which surrounds the well\nknown HC HII region, where hot ammonia is observed in absorption, and two\nadditional dusty cores, W51e2-E (~0.8\" to the East) and W51e2-NW (~1\" to the\nNorth), where hot ammonia is observed in emission. The velocity maps towards\nthe HC HII region show a clear velocity gradient that may indicate rotation,\nthough we do not directly observe a Keplerian velocity profile. The absence of\noutflow and/or maser activity and the low amount of molecular gas available for\naccretion (~5 solar masses) with respect to the mass of the central YSO (>20\nsolar masses), both indicate that the central YSO has already accreted most of\nits final mass. On the other hand, in the nearby W51e2-E object, the relatively\nlarge amount of hot molecular gas available for accretion (~20 solar masses,\nwithin about half an arcsecond or 2500 AU), along with strong outflow and maser\nactivity, indicates that the main accretion center in the W51e2 complex is\nW51e2-E rather than W51e2-W. Finally, W51e2-NW and W51e8, although less dense,\nare also hot cores and contain a significant amount of molecular gas (~30 and\n70 solar masses, respectively). We speculate that they may host high-mass YSOs\neither at a previous evolutionary stage or with lower mass than W51e2-E and\nW51e2-W.\n", "  The paper deals with phantom scalar field cosmology in Einstein gravity. At\nfirst using Lie symmetry, the coupling function to the kinetic term and the\npotential function of the scalar field and the equation of state parameter of\nthe matter field are determined and a simple solution is obtained.\nSubsequently, Noether symmetry is imposed on the Lagrangian of the system. The\nsymmetry vector is obtained and the potential takes a very general form from\nwhich potential using Lie Symmetry can be obtained as a particular case. Then\nwe choose a point transformation $(a,\\phi)\\rightarrow(u,v)$ such that one of\nthe transformed variables (say u) is a cyclic for the Lagrangian. Using\nconserved charge (corresponding to the cyclic coordinate) and the constant of\nmotion, solutions are obtained.\n", "  A simple proof is given that every globally hyperbolic spacetime admits a\nsmooth Cauchy steep time function. This result is useful in order to show that\nglobally hyperbolic spacetimes can be isometrically embedded in Minkowski\nspacetimes and that they spit as a product. The proof is based on a recent\nresult on the differentiability of Geroch's volume functions.\n", "  Single top production processes at hadron colliders provide information on\nthe relation between the top quark and the electroweak sector of the standard\nmodel. We compute the next-to-leading order QCD corrections to the three main\nproduction channels: $t$-channel, $s$-channel and $tW$ associated production,\nin the standard model including operators up to dimension-six. The calculation\ncan be matched to parton shower programs and can therefore be directly used in\nexperimental analyses. The QCD corrections are found to significantly impact\nthe extraction of the current limits on the operators, because both of an\nimproved accuracy and a better precision of the theoretical predictions. In\naddition, the distributions of some of the key discriminating observables are\nmodified in a nontrivial way, which could change the interpretation of\nmeasurements in terms of UV complete models.\n", "  Segregation-induced structural transitions in metallic grain boundaries are\nstudied with hybrid atomistic Monte Carlo/molecular dynamics simulations using\nCu-Zr as a model system, with a specific emphasis on understanding the effect\nof grain boundary character. With increasing global composition, the six grain\nboundary types chosen for this study first form ordered complexions, with the\nlocal segregation pattern depending on the grain boundary core structure, then\ntransform into disordered complexions when the grain boundary composition\nreaches a critical value that is temperature dependent. The tendency for this\ntransition to a disordered interfacial structure consistently depends on the\nrelative solute excess, instead of the grain boundary energy or misorientation\nangle. Grain boundaries with high relative solute excess go through gradual\ndisordering transitions, whereas those with low relative solute excess remain\nordered until high global Zr concentrations but then abruptly transform into\nthick disordered films. The results presented here provide a clear picture of\nthe effect of interface character on both dopant segregation patterns and\ndisordered intergranular film formation, showing that all grain boundaries are\nnot equal when discussing complexion transitions.\n", "  The Fermi-surfaces and Elliott-Yafet spin-mixing parameter (EYP) of several\nelemental metals are studied by \\emph{ab initio} calculations. We focus first\non the anisotropy of the EYP as a function of the direction of the\nspin-quantization axis [Phys.~Rev.~Lett.\\ \\textbf{109}, 236603 (2012)]. We\nanalyze in detail the origin of the gigantic anisotropy in $5d$ hcp metals as\ncompared to $5d$ cubic metals by band-structure calculations and discuss the\nstability of our results against an applied magnetic field. We further present\ncalculations of light (4$d$ and 3$d$) hcp crystals, where we find a huge\nincrease of the EYP anisotropy, reaching colossal values as large as $6000\\%$\nin hcp Ti. We attribute these findings to the reduced strength of spin-orbit\ncoupling, which promotes the anisotropic spin-flip hot loops at the Fermi\nsurface.\n  In order to conduct these investigations, we developed an adapted\ntetrahedron-based method for the precise calculation of Fermi surfaces of\ncomplicated shape and accurate Fermi-surface integrals within the\nfull-potential relativistic Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker Green-function method.\n", "  All four point functions of brane anti brane system including their correct\nall order $\\alpha'$ corrections have been addressed. All five point functions\nof one closed string Ramond-Ramond (RR), two real tachyons and either one gauge\nfield or the scalar field in both symmetric and asymmetric pictures have also\nbeen explored. The entire analysis of $<C^{-2} A^0 T^0 T ^{0}>$ is carried out.\nNot only does it fix the vertex operator of RR in asymmetric picture and in\nhigher point functions of string theory amplitudes but also it confirms the\nfact that there is no issue of picture dependence of the mixed closed RR, gauge\nfields, tachyons and fermion fields in all symmetric or anti symmetric ones. We\ncompute $<C^{-2} \\phi^0 T^0 T ^{0}>$ S-matrix in the presence of a transverse\nscalar field, two real tachyons and that reveals two different kinds of bulk\nsingularity structures, involving an infinite number of $u$- channel gauge\nfield and $(u+s'+t')$- channel scalar bulk poles. In order to produce all those\nbulk singularity structures, we define various couplings at the level of the\neffective field theory that involve the mixing term of Chern-Simons coupling\n(with C-potential field) and a covariant derivative of the scalar field that\ncomes from the pull-back of brane. Eventually we explore their all order\n$\\alpha'$ corrections in the presence of brane anti brane system where various\nremarks will be also pointed out.\n", "  We present initial results of the first large scale survey of embedded star\nclusters in molecular clouds in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) using\nnear-infrared (NIR) imaging from the VISTA Magellanic Clouds Survey (Cioni et\nal. 2011). We have explored a ~1.65 square degree area of the LMC, which\ncontains the well-known star-forming region 30 Doradus as well as ~14 percent\nof the galaxy's CO clouds (Wong et al. 2011), and have identified 67 embedded\ncluster candidates, 45 of which are newly discovered as clusters. We have\ndetermined sizes, luminosities and masses for these embedded clusters, examined\nthe star formation rates (SFRs) of their corresponding molecular clouds, and\nmade a comparison between the LMC and the Milky Way. Our preliminary results\nindicate that embedded clusters in the LMC are generally larger, more luminous\nand more massive than those in the local Milky Way. We also find that the\nsurface densities of both embedded clusters and molecular clouds is ~3 times\nhigher than in our local environment, the embedded cluster mass surface density\nis ~40 times higher, the SFR is ~20 times higher, and the star formation\nefficiency is ~10 times higher. Despite these differences, the SFRs of the LMC\nmolecular clouds are consistent with the SFR scaling law presented in Lada et\nal. (2012). This consistency indicates that while the conditions of embedded\ncluster formation may vary between environments, the overall process within\nmolecular clouds may be universal.\n", "  We investigate the competition between electron-solid and quantum-liquid\nphases in graphene, which arise in partially filled Landau levels. The\ndifferences in the wave function describing the electrons in the presence of a\nperpendicular magnetic field in graphene with respect to the conventional\nsemiconductors, such as GaAs, can be captured in a form factor which carries\nthe Landau level index. This leads to a quantitative difference in the\nelectron-solid and -liquid energies. For the lowest Landau level, there is no\ndifference in the wave function of relativistic and non-relativistic systems.\nWe compute the cohesive energy of the solid phase analytically using a\nHartree-Fock Hamiltonian. The liquid energies are computed analytically as well\nas numerically, using exact diagonalization. We find that the liquid phase\ndominates in the n=1 Landau level, whereas the Wigner crystal and\nelectron-bubble phases become more prominent in the n=2 and n=3 Landau level.\n", "  We consider the phenomenology of a 750 GeV resonance X which can be produced\nat the LHC by only photon fusion and subsequently decay into di-photons. We\npropose that the spin-zero state X is coupled to a heavy lepton that lives in\nthe bulk of a higher-dimensional theory and interacts only with the photons of\nthe Standard Model. We compute the di-photon rate in these models with two and\nmore compact extra dimensions and demonstrate that they allow for a compelling\nexplanation of the di-photon excess recently observed by the ATLAS and CMS\ncollaborations. The central role in our approach is played by the summation\nover the Kaluza-Klein modes of the new leptons, thus providing a significant\nenhancement of the $X\\to \\gamma\\gamma$ loops for the production and decay\nsubprocesses. It is expected that the jet activity accompanying these purely\nelectromagnetic (at the partonic level) processes is numerically suppressed by\nfactors such as $\\alpha_{em}^2 C_{q\\bar{q}}/C_{\\gamma\\gamma}\\sim 10^{-3}$.\n", "  We measure the H{\\alpha} and [OIII] emission line properties as well as\nspecific star-formation rates (sSFR) of spectroscopically confirmed 3<z<6\ngalaxies in COSMOS from their observed colors vs. redshift evolution. Our model\ndescribes consistently the ensemble of galaxies including intrinsic properties\n(age, metallicity, star-formation history), dust-attenuation, and optical\nemission lines. We forward-model the measured H{\\alpha} equivalent-widths (EW)\nto obtain the sSFR out to z~6 without stellar mass fitting. We find a strongly\nincreasing rest-frame H{\\alpha} EW that is flattening off above z~2.5 with\naverage EWs of 300-600A at z~6. The sSFR is increasing proportional to\n(1+z)^2.4 at z<2.2 and (1+z)^1.5 at higher redshifts, indicative of a fast mass\nbuild-up in high-z galaxies within e-folding times of 100-200Myr at z~6. The\nredshift evolution at z>3 cannot be fully explained in a picture of cold\naccretion driven growth. We find a progressively increasing\n[OIII]{\\lambda}5007/H{\\beta} ratio out to z~6, consistent with the ratios in\nlocal galaxies selected by increasing H{\\alpha} EW (i.e., sSFR). This\ndemonstrates the potential of using \"local high-z analogs\" to investigate the\nspectroscopic properties and relations of galaxies in the re-ionization epoch.\n", "  The unification of general relativity with quantum theory will also require a\ncoming together of the two quite different mathematical languages of general\nrelativity and quantum theory, i.e., of differential geometry and functional\nanalysis respectively. Of particular interest in this regard is the field of\nspectral geometry, which studies to which extent the shape of a Riemannian\nmanifold is describable in terms of the spectra of differential operators\ndefined on the manifold. Spectral geometry is hard because it is highly\nnonlinear, but linearized spectral geometry, i.e., the task to determine small\nshape changes from small spectral changes, is much more tractable, and may be\niterated to approximate the full problem. Here, we generalize this approach,\nallowing, in particular, non-equal finite numbers of shape and spectral degrees\nof freedom. This allows us to study how well the shape degrees of freedom are\nencoded in the eigenvalues. We apply this strategy numerically to a class of\nplanar domains and find that the reconstruction of small shape changes from\nsmall spectral changes is possible if enough eigenvalues are used. While\nisospectral non-isometric shapes are known to exist, we find evidence that\ngenerically shaped isospectral non-isometric shapes, if existing, are\nexceedingly rare.\n", "  To explain quark and lepton masses and mixing angles, one has to extend the\nstandard model, and the usual practice is to put the quarks and leptons into\nirreducible representations of discrete groups. We argue that discrete flavor\nsymmetries (and their concomitant problems) can be avoided if we extend the\ngauge group. In the framework of SU(12) we give explicit examples of models\nhaving varying degrees of predictability obtained by scanning over groups and\nrepresentations and identifying cases with operators contributing to mass and\nmixing matrices that need little fine- tuning of prefactors. Fitting with quark\nand lepton masses run to the GUT scale and known mixing angles allows us to\nmake predictions for the neutrino masses and hierarchy, the octant of the\natmospheric mixing angle, leptonic CP violation, Majorana phases, and the\neffective mass observed in neutrinoless double beta decay.\n", "  We study the gravitational collapse of two thin shells of matter, in\nasymptotically flat spacetime or constrained to move within a spherical box. We\nshow that this simple two-body system has surprisingly rich dynamics, which\nincludes prompt collapse to a black hole, perpetually oscillating solutions or\nblack hole formation at arbitrarily large times. Collapse is induced by shell\ncrossing and the black hole mass depends sensitively on the number of shell\ncrossings. At certain critical points, the black hole mass exhibits critical\nbehavior, determined by the change in parity (even or odd) of the number of\ncrossings, with or without mass-gap during the transition. Some of the features\nwe observe are reminiscent of confined scalars undergoing \"turbulent\" dynamics.\n", "  Empirical constraints on reionization require galactic ionizing photon escape\nfractions fesc>20%, but recent high-resolution radiation-hydrodynamic\ncalculations have consistently found much lower values ~1-5%. While these\nmodels include strong stellar feedback and additional processes such as runaway\nstars, they almost exclusively consider stellar evolution models based on\nsingle (isolated) stars, despite the fact that most massive stars are in\nbinaries. We re-visit these calculations, combining radiative transfer and\nhigh-resolution cosmological simulations from the Feedback in Realistic\nEnvironments (FIRE) project. For the first time, we use a stellar evolution\nmodel that includes a physically and observationally motivated treatment of\nbinaries (the BPASS model). Binary mass transfer and mergers enhance the\npopulation of massive stars at late times (>3 Myr) after star formation, which\nin turn strongly enhances the late-time ionizing photon production (especially\nat low metallicities). These photons are produced after feedback from massive\nstars has carved escape channels in the ISM, and so efficiently leak out of\ngalaxies. As a result, the time-averaged \"effective\" escape fraction (ratio of\nescaped ionizing photons to observed 1500 A photons) increases by factors 4-10,\nsufficient to explain reionization. While important uncertainties remain, we\nconclude that binary evolution may be critical for understanding the ionization\nof the Universe.\n", "  We conducted a Doppler survey at Keck combined with NIRC2 K-band AO imaging\nto search for massive, long-period companions to 123 known exoplanet systems\nwith one or two planets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Our\nsurvey is sensitive to Jupiter mass planets out to 20 AU for a majority of\nstars in our sample, and we report the discovery of eight new long-period\nplanets, in addition to 20 systems with statistically significant RV trends\nindicating the presence of an outer companion beyond 5 AU. We combine our RV\nobservations with AO imaging to determine the range of allowed masses and\norbital separations for these companions, and account for variations in our\nsensitivity to companions among stars in our sample. We estimate the total\noccurrence rate of companions in our sample to be 52 +/- 5% over the range 1 -\n20 M_Jup and 5 - 20 AU. Our data also suggest a declining frequency for gas\ngiant planets in these systems beyond 3-10 AU, in contrast to earlier studies\nthat found a rising frequency for giant planets in the range 0.01-3 AU. This\nsuggests either that the frequency of gas giant planets peaks between 3-10 AU,\nor that outer companions in these systems have a different semi-major axis\ndistribution than the overall gas giant planet population. Our results also\nsuggest that hot gas giants may be more likely to have an outer companion than\ncold gas giants. We find that planets with an outer companion have higher\naverage eccentricities than their single counterparts, suggesting that\ndynamical interactions between planets may play an important role in these\nsystems.\n", "  Recently a new type of Feshbach resonance, i.e., orbital Feshbach resonance\n(OFR) was proposed for the ultracold alkali-earth (like) atoms, and\nexperimentally observed in the ultracold gases of $^{{\\rm 173}}$Yb atoms.\nUnlike most of the magnetic Feshbach resonances of ultracold alkali atoms, when\nthe OFR of $^{{\\rm 173}}$Yb atoms appears, the energy gap between the\nthresholds of the open channel (OC) and the closed channel (CC) is much smaller\nthan the characteristic energy of the inter-atomic interaction, i.e., the van\nder Waals energy. In this paper we study the OFR in the systems with small\nCC-OC threshold gap. We show that in these systems the OFR can be induced by\nthe coupling between the OC and either an isolated bound state of the CC or the\nscattering states of the CC. Moreover, we also show that in each case the\ntwo-channel Huang-Yang pesudopoential is always applicable for the approximate\ncalculation of the low-energy scattering amplitude. Our results imply that in\nthe theoretical calculations for these systems it is appropriate to take into\naccount the contributions from the scattering states of the CC.\n", "  The first complete calculation of the next-to-leading-order electroweak\ncorrections to four-lepton production at the LHC is presented, where all\noff-shell effects of intermediate Z bosons and photons are taken into account.\nFocusing on the mixed final state $\\mu^+\\mu^-e^+e^-$, we study differential\ncross sections that are particularly interesting for Higgs-boson analyses. The\nelectroweak corrections are divided into photonic and purely weak corrections.\nThe former exhibit patterns familiar from similar W/Z-boson production\nprocesses with very large radiative tails near resonances and kinematical\nshoulders. The weak corrections are of the generic size of 5% and show\ninteresting variations, in particular a sign change between the regions of\nresonant Z-pair production and the Higgs signal.\n", "  We demonstrate experimentally and theoretically a controllable way of\nshifting the frequency of an optical pulse by using a combination of spectral\nhole burning, slow light effect, and linear Stark effect in a rare-earth-ion\ndoped crystal. We claim that the solid angle of acceptance of a frequency shift\nstructure can be close to $2\\pi$, which means that the frequency shifter could\nwork not only for optical pulses propagating in a specific spatial mode but\nalso for randomly scattered light. As the frequency shift is controlled solely\nby an external electric field, it works also for weak coherent light fields,\nand can e.g. be used as a frequency shifter for quantum memory devices in\nquantum communication.\n", "  Spectral modelling of SNII atmospheres indicates a clear dependence of metal\nline strengths on progenitor metallicity. This motivates further work to\nevaluate the accuracy with which these SNe can be used as metallicity\nindicators. To assess this accuracy we present a sample of SNII HII-region\nspectroscopy, from which environment abundances are derived. These environment\nabundances are compared to the observed strength of metal lines in SN spectra.\nCombining our sample with measurements from the literature, we present oxygen\nabundances of 119 host HII regions, by extracting emission line fluxes and\nusing abundance diagnostics. Then, following Dessart et al., these abundances\nare compared to equivalent widths of Fe 5018 A at various time and colour\nepochs. Our distribution of inferred SNII host HII-region abundances has a\nrange of ~0.6 dex. We confirm the dearth of SNeII exploding at metallicities\nlower than those found (on average) in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The\nequivalent width of Fe 5018 A at 50 days post explosion shows a statistically\nsignificant correlation with host HII-region oxygen abundance. The strength of\nthis correlation increases if one excludes abundance measurements derived far\nfrom SN explosion sites. The correlation significance also increases if we only\nanalyse a 'gold' IIP sample, and if a colour epoch is used in place of time. In\naddition, no evidence is found of correlation between progenitor metallicity\nand SN light-curve or spectral properties - except for that stated above with\nrespect to Fe 5018 A equivalent width - suggesting progenitor metallicity is\nnot a driving factor in producing the diversity observed in our sample. This\nstudy provides observational evidence of the usefulness of SNII as metallicity\nindicators. We finish with a discussion of the methodology needed to use SN\nspectra as independent metallicity diagnostics throughout the Universe.\n", "  Relevance of the M\\\"ossbauer spectroscopy in the study of harmonically\nmodulated electronic structures i.e. spin-density waves (SDWs) and\ncharge-density waves (CDWs) is presented and discussed. First, the effect of\nvarious parameters pertinent to the SDWs and CDWs is outlined on simulated\n119Sn spectra and distributions of the hyperfine field and the isomer shift.\nNext, various examples of the 119Sn spectra measured on single-crystals and\npolycrystalline samples of Cr and Cr-V are reviewed.\n", "  We demonstrate ultrafast incoherent depopulation of a quantum dot from above\nto below the transparency point using LA-phonon-assisted emission stimulated by\na redshifted laser pulse. The QD is turned from a weakly vibronic system into a\nstrongly vibronic one by laser driving which enables the phonon-assisted\nrelaxation between the excitonic components of two dressed states. The\ndepopulation is achieved within a laser pulse-width-limited time of 20 ps and\nexhibits a broad tuning range of a few meV. Our experimental results are well\nreproduced by path-integral calculations.\n", "  Stress-energies for Fermi fields are derived from the principle of general\ncovariance. This is done by developing a notion of Lie derivatives of spinors\nalong arbitrary vector fields. A substantial theory of such derivatives was\nfirst introduced by Kosmann; here I show how an apparent conflict in the\nliterature on this is due to a difference in the definitions of spinors, and\nthat tracking the Lie derivative of the Infeld-van der Waerden symbol, as well\nas the spinor fields under consideration, gives a fuller picture of the\ngeometry and leads to the Fermion stress-energy. The differences in the\ndefinitions of spinors do not affect the results here, but could matter in\ncertain quantum-gravity programs and for spinor transformations under discrete\nsymmetries.\n", "  The JCMT Gould Belt Legacy Survey obtained SCUBA-2 observations of dense\ncores within three sub-regions of Orion B: LDN 1622, NGC 2023/2024, and NGC\n2068/2071, all of which contain clusters of cores. We present an analysis of\nthe clustering properties of these cores, including the two-point correlation\nfunction and Cartwright's Q parameter. We identify individual clusters of dense\ncores across all three regions using a minimal spanning tree technique, and\nfind that in each cluster, the most massive cores tend to be centrally located.\nWe also apply the independent M-Sigma technique and find a strong correlation\nbetween core mass and the local surface density of cores. These two lines of\nevidence jointly suggest that some amount of mass segregation in clusters has\nhappened already at the dense core stage.\n", "  We study propagation of waves and appearance of caustics in k-essence and\ngalileon theories. First we show that previously known solutions for travelling\nwaves in k-essence and galileon models correspond to very specific fine-tuned\ninitial conditions. On the contrary, as we demonstrate by the method of\ncharacteristics, generic initial conditions leads to a wave in k-essence which\nends up with formation of caustics. Finally, we find that any wave solution in\npure k-essence is also a solution for a galileon theory with the same k-essence\nterm. Thus in the Horndeski theory with a k-essence term formation of caustics\nis generic. We discuss physical consequences of the caustics formation and\npossible ways to cure the problem.\n", "  We propose a theoretical framework for dealing with a transient polymer\nnetwork undergoing small deformations, based on the rate of breaking and\nre-forming of network crosslinks and the evolving elastic reference state. In\nthis framework, the characteristics of the deformed transient network at\nmicroscopic and macroscopic scales are naturally unified. Microscopically, the\nbreakage rate of the crosslinks is affected by the local force acting on the\nchain. Macroscopically, we use the classical continuum model for rubber\nelasticity to describe the structure of the deformation energy, whose reference\nstate is defined dynamically according to when crosslinks are broken and\nformed. With this, the constitutive relation can be obtained. We study three\napplications of the theory in uniaxial stretching geometry: for the stress\nrelaxation after an instantaneous step strain is imposed, for the stress\novershoot and subsequent decay in the plastic regime when a strain ramp is\napplied, and for the cycle of stretching and release. We compare the model\npredictions with experimental data on stress relaxation and stress overshoot in\nphysically bonded thermoplastic elastomers and in vitrimer networks.\n", "  We report on sliding Charge Density Wave (CDW) in the quasi two-dimensional\nTbTe$_3$ system probed by coherent x-ray diffraction combined with {\\it\nin-situ} transport measurements. We show that the non-Ohmic conductivity in\nTbTe$_3$ is made possible thanks to a strong distortion of the CDW. Our\ndiffraction experiment versus current shows first that the CDW remains\nundeformed below the threshold current I$_S$ and then suddenly rotates and\nreorders by motion above threshold. Contrary to quasi-one dimensional systems,\nthe CDW in TbTe$_3$ does not display any phase shifts below I$_S$ and tolerates\nonly slow spatial variations of the phase above. This is a first observation of\nCDW behavior in the bulk in a quasi-two dimensional system allowing collective\ntransport of charges at room temperature.\n", "  An algebraic formalism, developped with V. Glaser and R. Stora for the study\nof the generalized retarded functions of quantum field theory, is used to prove\na factorization theorem which provides a complete description of the\ngeneralized retarded functions associated with any tree graph. Integrating over\nthe variables associated to internal vertices to obtain the perturbative\ngeneralized retarded functions for interacting fields arising from such graphs\nis shown to be possible for a large category of space-times.\n", "  Context. Machine-Learning (ML) solves problems by learning patterns from\ndata, with limited or no human guidance. In Astronomy, it is mainly applied to\nlarge observational datasets, e.g. for morphological galaxy classification.\nAims. We apply ML to gravitational N-body simulations of star clusters that are\neither formed by merging two progenitors or evolved in isolation, planning to\nlater identify Globular Clusters (GCs) that may have a history of merging from\nobservational data. Methods. We create mock-observations from simulated GCs,\nfrom which we measure a set of parameters (also called features in the\nmachine-learning field). After dimensionality reduction on the feature space,\nthe resulting datapoints are fed to various classification algorithms. Using\nrepeated random subsampling validation we check whether the groups identified\nby the algorithms correspond to the underlying physical distinction between\nmergers and monolithically evolved simulations. Results. The three algorithms\nwe considered (C5.0 trees, k-nearest neighbour, and support-vector machines)\nall achieve a test misclassification rate of about 10% without parameter\ntuning, with support-vector machines slightly outperforming the others. The\nfirst principal component of feature space correlates with cluster\nconcentration. If we exclude it from the regression, the performance of the\nalgorithms is only slightly reduced.\n", "  Perturbative quantities, such as the growth rate ($f$) and index ($\\gamma$),\nare powerful tools to distinguish different dark energy models or modified\ngravity theories even if they produce the same cosmic expansion history. In\nthis work, without any assumption about the dynamics of the Universe, we apply\na non-parametric method to current measurements of the expansion rate $H(z)$\nfrom cosmic chronometers and high-$z$ quasar data and reconstruct the growth\nfactor and rate of linearised density perturbations in the non-relativistic\nmatter component. Assuming realistic values for the matter density parameter\n$\\Omega_{m0}$, as provided by current CMB experiments, we also reconstruct the\nevolution of the growth index $\\gamma$ with redshift. We show that the\nreconstruction of current $H(z)$ data constrains the growth index to\n$\\gamma=0.56 \\pm 0.12$ (2$\\sigma$) at $z = 0.09$, which is in full agreement\nwith the prediction of the $\\Lambda$CDM model and some of its extensions.\n", "  We generalize current holographic models with homogeneous breaking of\ntranslation symmetry by incorporating higher derivative couplings, in the\nspirit of effective field theories. Focusing on charge transport, we specialize\nto two simple couplings between the charge and translation symmetry breaking\nsectors. We obtain analytical charged black brane solutions and compute their\nDC conductivity in terms of horizon data. We constrain the allowed values of\nthe couplings and note that the DC conductivity can vanish at zero temperature\nfor strong translation symmetry breaking, thus showing that in general there is\nno lower bound on the conductivity.\n", "  We study two nonlinear extensions of the nonlocal $R\\,\\Box^{-2}R$ gravity\ntheory. We extend this theory in two different ways suggested by conformal\nsymmetry, either replacing $\\Box^{-2}$ with $(-\\Box + R/6)^{-2}$, which is the\noperator that enters the action for a conformally-coupled scalar field, or\nreplacing $\\Box^{-2}$ with the inverse of the Paneitz operator, which is a\nfour-derivative operator that enters in the effective action induced by the\nconformal anomaly. We show that the former modification gives an interesting\nand viable cosmological model, with a dark energy equation of state today\n$w_{\\rm DE}\\simeq -1.01$, which very closely mimics $\\Lambda$CDM and evolves\nasymptotically into a de Sitter solution. The model based on the Paneitz\noperator seems instead excluded by the comparison with observations. We also\nreview some issues about the causality of nonlocal theories, and we point out\nthat these nonlocal models can be modified so to nicely interpolate between\nStarobinski inflation in the primordial universe and accelerated expansion in\nthe recent epoch.\n", "  We have examined the outburst tracks of 40 novae in the color-magnitude\ndiagram (intrinsic B-V color versus absolute V magnitude). After reaching the\noptical maximum, each nova generally evolves toward blue from the upper-right\nto the lower-left and then turns back toward the right. The 40 tracks are\ncategorized into one of six templates: very fast nova V1500 Cyg; fast novae\nV1668 Cyg, V1974 Cyg, and LV Vul; moderately fast nova FH Ser; and very slow\nnova PU Vul. These templates are located from the left (blue) to the right\n(red) in this order, depending on the envelope mass and nova speed class. A\nbluer nova has a less massive envelope and faster nova speed class. In novae\nwith multiple peaks, the track of the first decay is more red than that of the\nsecond (or third) decay, because a large part of the envelope mass had already\nbeen ejected during the first peak. Thus, our newly obtained tracks in the\ncolor-magnitude diagram provide useful information to understand the physics of\nclassical novae. We also found that the absolute magnitude at the beginning of\nthe nebular phase is almost similar among various novae. We are able to\ndetermine the absolute magnitude (or distance modulus) by fitting the track of\na target nova to the same classification of a nova with a known distance. This\nmethod for determining nova distance has been applied to some recurrent novae\nand their distances have been recalculated.\n", "  We derive formulas which connect cumulants of particle numbers observed with\nefficiency losses with the original ones based on the binomial model. These\nformulas can describe the case with multiple efficiencies in a compact form.\nCompared with the presently suggested ones based on factorial moments, these\nformulas would drastically reduce the numerical cost for efficiency corrections\nwhen the order of the cumulant and the number of different efficiencies are\nlarge. The efficiency correction with realistic $p_T$-dependent efficiency\nwould be carried out with the aid of these formulas.\n", "  We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of classical particles in a driven\nquasiperiodic lattice based on the Fibonacci sequence. An intricate transient\ndynamics of extraordinarily long ballistic flights at distinct velocities is\nfound. We argue how these transients are caused and can be under- stood by a\nhierarchy of block decompositions of the quasiperiodic lattice. A comparison to\nthe cases of periodic and fully randomized lattices is performed.\n", "  We study the impact of the effect of multinucleon interactions in the\nreconstruction of the neutrino energy on the fit of the MiniBooNE data in terms\nof neutrino oscillations. We obtain some improvement of the fit of the\nMiniBooNE low-energy excess in the framework of two-neutrino oscillations and a\nshift of the allowed region in the $\\sin^2 2\\vartheta$--$\\Delta{m}^2$ plane\ntowards smaller values of $\\sin^2 2\\vartheta$ and larger values of\n$\\Delta{m}^2$. However this effect is not enough to solve the problem of the\nappearance-disappearance tension in the global fit of short-baseline neutrino\noscillation data.\n", "  Studying abroad has become very popular among students. The ERASMUS mobility\nprogram is one of the largest international student exchange programs in the\nworld, which has supported already more than three million participants since\n1987. We analyzed the mobility pattern within this program in 2011-12 and found\na gender gap across countries and subject areas. Namely, for almost all\nparticipating countries, female students are over-represented in the ERASMUS\nprogram when compared to the entire population of tertiary students. The same\ntendency is observed across different subject areas. We also found a gender\nasymmetry in the geographical distribution of hosting institutions, with a bias\nof male students in Scandinavian countries. However, a detailed analysis\nreveals that this latter asymmetry is rather driven by subject and consistent\nwith the distribution of gender ratios among subject areas.\n", "  Phase separation, i.e., the coexistence of two different phases, is observed\nin many systems away from the coexistence curve of a first-order transition,\nleading to a stable heterogeneous phase or region. Examples include various\nquantum ferromagnets, heavy-fermion systems, rare-earth nickelates, and others.\nThese observations seem to violate basic notions of equilibrium thermodynamics,\nwhich state that phase separation can occur only on the coexistence curve. We\nshow theoretically that quenched disorder allows for phase separation away from\nthe coexistence curve even in equilibrium due to the existence of stable\nminority-phase droplets within the majority phase. Our scenario also answers a\nrelated question: How can a first-order transition remain sharp in the presence\nof quenched disorder without violating the rigorous lower bound $\\nu \\geq 2/d$\nfor the correlation-length exponent? We discuss this scenario in the context of\nexperimental results for a large variety of systems.\n", "  We describe expressions for pion and kaon dressed-quark distribution\nfunctions that incorporate contributions from gluons which bind quarks into\nthese mesons and hence overcome a flaw of the commonly used handbag\napproximation. The distributions therewith obtained are purely valence in\ncharacter, ensuring that dressed-quarks carry all a meson's momentum at a\ncharacteristic hadronic scale and vanishing as $(1-x)^2$ when Bjorken-$x\\to 1$.\nComparing such distributions within the pion and kaon, it is apparent that the\nsize of SU(3)-flavour symmetry breaking in meson parton distribution functions\nis modulated by the flavour dependence of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking.\nCorrections to these leading-order formulae may be divided into two classes,\nresponsible for shifting dressed-quark momentum into glue and sea-quarks.\nWorking with available empirical information, we build an algebraic framework\nthat is capable of expressing the principal impact of both classes of\ncorrections. This enables a realistic comparison with experiment which allows\nus to identify and highlight basic features of measurable pion and kaon\nvalence-quark distributions. We find that whereas roughly two-thirds of the\npion's light-front momentum is carried by valence dressed-quarks at a\ncharacteristic hadronic scale, this fraction rises to 95% in the kaon; evolving\ndistributions with these features to a scale typical of available Drell-Yan\ndata produces a kaon-to-pion ratio of u-quark distributions that is in\nagreement with the single existing data set; and predict a u-quark distribution\nwithin the pion that agrees with a modern reappraisal of $\\pi N$ Drell-Yan\ndata. Precise new data are essential in order to validate this reappraisal and\nbecause a single modest-quality measurement of the kaon-to-pion ratio cannot be\nconsidered definitive.\n", "  Black hole transients during bright outbursts show distinct changes of their\nspectral and variability properties as they evolve during an outburst, that are\ninterpreted as evidence for changes in the accretion flow and X-ray emitting\nregions. We obtained an anticipated XMM-Newton ToO observation of H 1743-322\nduring its outburst in September 2014. Based on data of eight outbursts\nobserved in the last 10 years we expected to catch the start of the\nhard-to-soft state transition. The fact that neither the general shape of the\nobserved power density spectrum nor the characteristic frequency show an energy\ndependence implies that the source still stays in the low-hard state at the\ntime of our observation near outburst peak. The spectral properties agree with\nthe source being in the low-hard state and a Swift/XRT monitoring of the\noutburst reveals that H 1743-322 stays in the low-hard state during the entire\noutburst (a. k. a. 'failed outburst'). We derive the averaged QPO waveform and\nobtain phase-resolved spectra. Comparing the phase-resolved spectra to the\nphase averaged energy spectrum reveals spectral pivoting. We compare\nvariability on long and short time scales using covariance spectra and find\nthat the covariance ratio does not show an increase towards lower energies as\nhas been found in other black hole X-ray binaries. There are two possible\nexplanations: either the absence of additional disc variability on longer time\nscales is related to the rather high inclination of H 1743-322 compared to\nother black hole X-ray binaries or it is the reason why we observe H 1743-322\nduring a failed outburst. More data on failed outbursts and on high-inclination\nsources will be needed to investigate these two possibilities further.\n", "  We compare APOGEE radial velocities (RVs) of young stars in the Orion A cloud\nwith CO line gas emission and find a correlation between the two at\nlarge-scales, in agreement with previous studies. However, at smaller scales we\nfind evidence for the presence of substructure in the stellar velocity field.\nUsing a Friends-of-Friends approach we identify 37 stellar groups with almost\nidentical RVs. These groups are not randomly distributed but form elongated\nchains or strings of stars with five or more members with low velocity\ndispersion, across lengths of 1-1.5~pc. The similarity between the kinematic\nproperties of the APOGEE strings and the internal velocity field of the chains\nof dense cores and fibers recently identified in the dense ISM is striking and\nsuggests that for most of the Orion A cloud, young stars keep memory of the\nparental gas substructure where they originated.\n", "  We present the discovery in Kepler's $K2$ mission observations and our\nfollow-up radial velocity observations from Keck/HIRES for four eclipsing\nbinary (EB) star systems in the young benchmark Pleiades cluster. Based on our\nmodeling results, we announce two new low mass ($M_{tot} < 0.6 M_\\odot$) EBs\namong Pleiades members (HCG 76 and MHO 9) and we report on two previously known\nPleiades binaries that are also found to be EB systems (HII 2407 and HD 23642).\nWe measured the masses of the binary HCG 76 to $\\lesssim$2.5% precision, and\nthe radii to $\\lesssim$4.5% precision, which together with the precise\neffective temperatures yield an independent Pleiades distance of 132$\\pm$5 pc.\nWe discuss another EB towards the Pleiades that is a possible but unlikely\nPleiades cluster member (AK II 465). The two new confirmed Pleiades systems\nextend the mass range of Pleiades EB components to 0.2-2 $M_\\odot$. Our initial\nmeasurements of the fundamental stellar parameters for the Pleiades EBs are\ndiscussed in the context of the current stellar models and the nominal cluster\nisochrone, finding good agreement with the stellar models of Baraffe et al.\n(2015) at the nominal Pleiades age of 120 Myr.\n  Finally, in the Hyades, we report a new low mass eclipsing system (vA 50)\nthat was concurrently discovered and studied by Mann et al. (2016). We confirm\nthat the eclipse is likely caused by a Neptune-sized transiting planet, and\nwith the additional radial velocity constraints presented here we improve the\nconstraint on the maximum mass of the planet to be $\\lesssim$1.2\n$M_\\mathrm{Jup}$.\n", "  As part of Villanova's Living with a Red Dwarf program, we have obtained UV,\nX-ray and optical data of the Population II red dwarf -- Kapteyn's Star.\nKapteyn's Star is noteworthy for its large proper motions and high RV of ~+245\nkm s^-1. As the nearest Pop II red dwarf, it serves as an old age anchor for\ncalibrating Activity/Irradiance-Rotation-Age relations, and an important test\nbed for stellar dynamos and the resulting X-ray -- UV emissions of slowly\nrotating, near-fully convective red dwarf stars. Adding to the notoriety,\nKapteyn's Star has recently been reported to host two super-Earth candidates,\none of which (Kapteyn b) is orbiting within the habitable zone (Anglada-Escude\net al. 2014a, 2015). However, Robertson et al. (2015) questioned the planet's\nexistence since its orbital period may be an artifact of activity, related to\nthe star's rotation period. Because of its large Doppler-shift, measures of the\nimportant, chromospheric H I Lyman-alpha 1215.67A emission line can be reliably\nmade, because it is mostly displaced from ISM and geo-coronal sources.\nLyman-alpha emission dominates the FUV region of cool stars. Our measures can\nhelp determine the X-ray--UV effects on planets hosted by Kapteyn's Star, and\nplanets hosted by other old red dwarfs. Stellar X-ray and Lyman-alpha emissions\nhave strong influences on the heating and ionization of upper planetary\natmospheres and can (with stellar winds and flares) erode or even eliminate\nplanetary atmospheres. Using our program stars, we have reconstructed the past\nexposures of Kapteyn's Star's planets to coronal -- chromospheric XUV emissions\nover time.\n", "  We revisit the dynamics of Atlas. Using Cassini ISS astrometric observations\nspanning February 2004 to August 2013, Cooper et al. (2015) found evidence that\nAtlas is currently perturbed by both a 54:53 corotation eccentricity resonance\n(CER) and a 54:53 Lindblad eccentricity resonance (LER) with Prometheus. They\ndemonstrated that the orbit of Atlas is chaotic, with a Lyapunov time of order\n10 years, as a direct consequence of the coupled resonant interaction (CER/LER)\nwith Prometheus. Here we investigate the interactions between the two\nresonances using the CoraLin analytical model (El Moutamid et al. 2014),\nshowing that the chaotic zone fills almost all the corotation sites occupied by\nthe satellite's orbit. Four 70:67 apse-type mean motion resonances with Pandora\nare also overlapping, but these resonances have a much weaker effect. Frequency\nanalysis allows us to highlight the coupling between the 54:53 resonances, and\nconfirms that a simplified system including the perturbations due to Prometheus\nand Saturn's oblateness only captures the essential features of the dynamics.\n", "  We present a two-channel deconvolution method that decomposes images into a\nparametric point-source channel and a pixelized extended-source channel. Based\non the central idea of the deconvolution algorithm proposed by Magain, Courbin\n& Sohy (1998), the method aims at improving the resolution of the data rather\nthan at completely removing the point spread function (PSF). Improvements over\nthe original method include a better regularization of the pixel channel of the\nimage, based on wavelet filtering and multiscale analysis, and a better\ncontrolled separation of the point source vs. the extended source. In addition,\nthe method is able to simultaneously deconvolve many individual frames of the\nsame object taken with different instruments under different PSF conditions.\nFor this purpose, we introduce a general geometric transformation between\nindividual images. This transformation allows the combination of the images\nwithout having to interpolate them. We illustrate the capability of our\nalgorithm using real and simulated images with complex diffraction-limited PSF.\n", "  Using a Josephson junction interferometer (DC SQUID) as a microwave source\nfor irradiating a single-electron trap, both devices fabricated on the same\nchip, we study the process of photon-assisted tunneling as an effective\nmechanism of single photon detection. High sensitivity down to a very small\noscillation amplitude $v_{\\rm J} \\sim$ 10 nV$\\ll E_{\\rm act} \\lesssim hf_{\\rm\nJ}$ and down to low photon absorption rates $\\Gamma_{\\rm ph} \\sim$ (1--50)Hz,\nas well as a clear threshold type of operation with an activation energy\n$E_{\\rm act} \\sim$ 400 $\\mu$eV, are demonstrated for the trap with respect to\nthe microwave photons of frequency $f_{\\rm J} \\sim$ (100--200)GHz. Tunable\ngeneration is demonstrated with respect to the power and frequency of the\nmicrowave signal produced by the SQUID source biased within the subgap voltage\nrange. A much weaker effect is observed at the higher junction voltages along\nthe quasiparticle branch of the $I-V$ curve; this response mostly appears due\nto the recombination phonons.\n", "  Using the largest single-survey sample of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) to\ndate, we study the relationship between properties of SNe Ia and those of their\nhost galaxies, focusing primarily on correlations with Hubble residuals (HR).\nOur sample consists of 345 photometrically-classified or\nspectroscopically-confirmed SNeIa discovered as part of the SDSS-II Supernova\nSurvey (SDSS-SNS). This analysis utilizes host-galaxy spectroscopy obtained\nduring the SDSS-I/II spectroscopic survey and from an ancillary program on the\nSDSS-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) that obtained spectra\nfor nearly all host galaxies of SDSS-II SN candidates. In addition, we use\nphotometric host-galaxy properties from the SDSS-SNS data release (Sako et al.\n2014) such as host stellar mass and star-formation rate. We confirm the\nwell-known relation between HR and host-galaxy mass and find a 3.6{\\sigma}\nsignificance of a non-zero linear slope. We also recover correlations between\nHR and host-galaxy gas-phase metallicity and specific star-formation rate as\nthey are reported in the literature. With our large dataset, we examine\ncorrelations between HR and multiple host-galaxy properties simultaneously and\nfind no evidence of a significant correlation. We also independently analyze\nour spectroscopically-confirmed and photometrically-classified SNe Ia and\ncomment on the significance of similar combined datasets for future surveys.\n", "  The \"main sequence of galaxies\" $-$ defined in terms of the total star\nformation rate $\\psi$ vs. the total stellar mass $M_*$ $-$ is a well-studied\ntight relation that has been observed at several wavelengths and at different\nredshifts. All earlier studies have derived this relation from integrated\nproperties of galaxies. We recover the same relation from an analysis of\nspatially-resolved properties, with integral field spectroscopic (IFS)\nobservations of 306 galaxies from the CALIFA survey. We consider the SFR\nsurface density in units of log(M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ Kpc$^{-2}$) and the\nstellar mass surface density in units of log(M$_{\\odot}$ Kpc$^{-2}$) in\nindividual spaxels which probe spatial scales of 0.5-1.5 Kpc. This local\nrelation exhibits a high degree of correlation with small scatter ($\\sigma =\n0.23$ dex), irrespective of the dominant ionisation source of the host galaxy\nor its integrated stellar mass. We highlight: $(i)$ the integrated star\nformation main sequence formed by galaxies whose dominant ionisation process is\nrelated to star formation, for which we find a slope of 0.81 $\\pm 0.02$; (ii)\nthe spatially-resolved relation obtained with the spaxel analysis, we find a\nslope of 0.72 $\\pm 0.04$; (iii) for the integrated main sequence we identified\nalso a sequence formed by galaxies that are dominated by an old stellar\npopulation, which we have called the retired galaxies sequence.\n", "  Although quantum key distribution (QKD) is theoretically secure, there is a\ngap between the theory and practice. In fact, real-life QKD may not be secure\nbecause component devices in QKD systems may deviate from the theoretical\nmodels assumed in security proofs. To solve this problem, it is necessary to\nconstruct the security proof under realistic assumptions on the source and\nmeasurement unit. In this paper, we prove the security of a QKD protocol under\npractical assumptions on the source that accommodate fluctuation of the phase\nand intensity modulations. As long as our assumptions hold, it does not matter\nat all how the phase and intensity distribute nor whether or not their\ndistributions over different pulses are independently and identically\ndistributed (I.I.D.). Our work shows that practical sources can be safely\nemployed in QKD experiments.\n", "  Planetesimals in gaseous protoplanetary disks may grow by collecting dust\nparticles. Hydrodynamical studies show that small particles generally avoid\ncollisions with the planetesimals because they are entrained by the flow around\nthem. This occurs when $St$, the Stokes number, defined as the ratio of the\ndust stopping time to the planetesimal crossing time, becomes much smaller than\nunity. However, these studies have been limited to the laminar case, whereas\nthese disks are believed to be turbulent. We want to estimate the influence of\ngas turbulence on the dust-planetesimal collision rate and on the impact\nspeeds. We used three-dimensional direct numerical simulations of a fixed\nsphere (planetesimal) facing a laminar and turbulent flow seeded with small\ninertial particles (dust) subject to a Stokes drag. A no-slip boundary\ncondition on the planetesimal surface is modeled via a penalty method. We find\nthat turbulence can significantly increase the collision rate of dust particles\nwith planetesimals. For a high turbulence case (when the amplitude of turbulent\nfluctuations is similar to the headwind velocity), we find that the collision\nprobability remains equal to the geometrical rate or even higher for $St\\geq\n0.1$, i.e., for dust sizes an order of magnitude smaller than in the laminar\ncase. We derive expressions to calculate impact probabilities as a function of\ndust and planetesimal size and turbulent intensity.\n", "  Using three fiducial Nbody+SPH simulations, we follow the merging of two disk\ngalaxies with a hot gaseous halo component each, and examine whether the merger\nremnant can be a spiral galaxy. The stellar progenitor disks are destroyed by\nviolent relaxation during the merging and most of their stars form a classical\nbulge, while the remaining form a thick disk and its bar. A new stellar disk\nforms subsequently and gradually in the remnant from the gas accreted mainly\nfrom the halo. It is vertically thin and well extended in its equatorial plane.\nA bar starts forming before the disk is fully in place, contrary to what is\nassumed in idealised simulations of isolated bar-forming galaxies. It has\nmorphological features such as ansae and boxy/peanut bulges. Stars of different\nages populate different parts of the box/peanut. A disky pseudobulge forms\nalso, so that by the end of the simulation, all three types of bulges coexist.\nThe oldest stars are found in the classical bulge, followed by those of the\nthick disk, then by those in the thin disk. The youngest stars are in the\nspiral arms and the disky pseudobulge. The disk surface density profiles are of\ntype II (exponential with downbending), and the circular velocity curves are\nflat and show that the disks are submaximum in these examples: two clearly so\nand one near-borderline between maximum and submaximum. On average, only\nroughly between 10 and 20% of the stellar mass is in the classical bulge of the\nfinal models, i.e. much less than in previous simulations.\n", "  We introduce and theoretically demonstrate a quantum metamaterial made of\ndense ultracold neutral atoms loaded into an inherently defect-free artificial\ncrystal of light, immune to well-known critical chal- lenges inevitable in\nconventional solid-state platforms. We demonstrate an all-optical control on\nultrafast time scales over the photonic topological transition of the\nisofrequency contour from an open to close topology at the same frequency. This\natomic lattice quantum metamaterial enables a dynamic manipula- tion of the\ndecay rate of a probe quantum emitter by more than an order of magnitude. This\nproposal may lead to practically lossless, tunable and\ntopologically-reconfigurable quantum metamaterials, for single- or\nfew-photon-level applications as varied as quantum sensing, quantum information\nprocessing, and quantum simulations using metamaterials.\n", "  Stellar evolution models predict that internal mixing should cause some\nsodium overabundance at the surface of red giants more massive than ~ 1.5--2.0\nMsun. The surface aluminium abundance should not be affected. Nevertheless,\nobservational results disagree about the presence and/or the degree of the Na\nand Al overabundances. In addition, Galactic chemical evolution models adopting\ndifferent stellar yields lead to quite different predictions for the behavior\nof [Na/Fe] and [Al/Fe] versus [Fe/H]. Overall, the observed trends of these\nabundances with metallicity are not well reproduced. We readdress both issues,\nusing new Na and Al abundances determined within the Gaia-ESO Survey, using two\nsamples: i) more than 600 dwarfs of the solar neighborhood and of open clusters\nand ii) low- and intermediate-mass clump giants in six open clusters.\nAbundances of Na in giants with mass below ~2.0 Msun, and of Al in giants below\n~3.0 Msun, seem to be unaffected by internal mixing processes. For more massive\ngiants, the Na overabundance increases with stellar mass. This trend agrees\nwell with predictions of stellar evolutionary models. Chemical evolution models\nthat are able to fit well the observed [Na/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] trend in solar\nneighborhood dwarfs can not simultaneously explain the run of [Al/Fe] with\n[Fe/H], and viceversa. The comparison with stellar ages is hampered by severe\nuncertainties. Indeed, reliable age estimates are available for only a half of\nthe stars of the sample. We conclude that Al is underproduced by the models,\nexcept for stellar ages younger than about 7 Gyr. In addition, some significant\nsource of late Na production seems to be missing in the models. Either current\nNa and Al yields are affected by large uncertainties, and/or some important\nGalactic source(s) of these elements has not been taken into account up to now.\n[abridged]\n", "  We use high-precision kinematic and lensing measurements of the total mass\nprofile of the dynamically relaxed galaxy cluster MACS J1206.2-0847 at $z=0.44$\nto estimate the value of the ratio $\\eta=\\Psi/\\Phi$ between the two scalar\npotentials in the linear perturbed Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker\nmetric.[...] Complementary kinematic and lensing mass profiles were derived\nfrom exhaustive analyses using the data from the Cluster Lensing And Supernova\nsurvey with Hubble (CLASH) and the spectroscopic follow-up with the Very Large\nTelescope (CLASH-VLT). Whereas the kinematic mass profile tracks only the\ntime-time part of the perturbed metric (i.e. only $\\Phi$), the lensing mass\nprofile reflects the contribution of both time-time and space-space components\n(i.e. the sum $\\Phi+\\Psi$). We thus express $\\eta$ as a function of the mass\nprofiles and perform our analysis over the radial range $0.5\\,Mpc\\le r\\le\nr_{200}=1.96\\,Mpc$. Using a spherical Navarro-Frenk-White mass profile, which\nwell fits the data, we obtain $\\eta(r_{200})=1.01\\,_{-0.28}^{+0.31}$ at the\n68\\% C.L. We discuss the effect of assuming different functional forms for mass\nprofiles and of the orbit anisotropy in the kinematic reconstruction.\nInterpreting this result within the well-studied $f(R)$ modified gravity model,\nthe constraint on $\\eta$ translates into an upper bound to the interaction\nlength (inverse of the scalaron mass) smaller than 2 Mpc. This tight constraint\non the $f(R)$ interaction range is however substantially relaxed when\nsystematic uncertainties in the analysis are considered. Our analysis\nhighlights the potential of this method to detect deviations from general\nrelativity, while calling for the need of further high-quality data on the\ntotal mass distribution of clusters and improved control on systematic effects.\n", "  We theoretically study the generation of optical frequency combs and\ncorresponding pulse trains in doubly resonant intracavity second-harmonic\ngeneration (SHG). We find that, despite the large temporal walk-off\ncharacteristic of realistic cavity systems, the nonlinear dynamics can be\naccurately and efficiently modelled using a pair of coupled mean-field\nequations. Through rigorous stability analysis of the system's steady-state\ncontinuous wave solutions, we demonstrate that walk-off can give rise to a new,\npreviously unexplored regime of temporal modulation instability (MI). Numerical\nsimulations performed in this regime reveal rich dynamical behaviours,\nincluding the emergence of temporal patterns that correspond to coherent\noptical frequency combs. We also demonstrate that the two coupled equations\nthat govern the doubly resonant cavity behaviour can, under typical conditions,\nbe reduced to a single mean-field equation akin to that describing the dynamics\nof singly resonant cavity SHG [F. Leo et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 033901\n(2016)]. This reduced approach allows us to derive a simple expression for the\nMI gain, thus permitting to acquire significant insight into the underlying\nphysics. We anticipate that our work will have wide impact on the study of\nfrequency combs in emerging doubly resonant cavity SHG platforms, including\nquadratically nonlinear microresonators.\n", "  Heavy-quark observables in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions, like the\nnuclear modification factor and the elliptic flow, give insight into the\nmechanisms of high-momentum suppression and low-momentum thermalization of\nheavy quarks. Here, we present a global study of these two observables within a\ncoupled approach of the heavy-quark propagation in a realistic fluid dynamical\nmedium, MC@sHQ+EPOS2, and compare to experimental data from RHIC and LHC\nexperiments. The heavy quarks scatter elastically and inelastically with the\nquasiparticles of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), which are represented\nconsistently with the underlying equation of state. We examine two scenarios:\nfirst, we interpret the lattice QCD equation of state as a sum of partonic and\nhadronic contributions, and second, as a gas of massive partonic\nquasiparticles. It is observed that independent of their momentum the energy\nloss of heavy quarks depends strongly on how the lattice QCD equation of state\nis translated into degrees of freedom of the QGP.\n", "  The magnetic activity of late-type MS stars is characterized by different\nregimes, and their activity levels are well described by Ro, the ratio between\nP_rot and the convective turnover time. Very young PMS stars show, similarly to\nMS stars, intense magnetic activity. However they do not show clear\nactivity-rotation trends, and it still debated which stellar parameters\ndetermine their magnetic activity levels. To bridge the gap between MS and PMS\nstars, we studied the activity-rotation relation in the young cluster h Per, a\n~13 Myr old cluster, that contains both fast and slow rotators, whose members\nhave ended their accretion phase and have already developed a radiative core.\nIt offers us the opportunity to study the activity level of intermediate-age\nPMS stars with different rotational velocities, excluding any interactions with\nthe circumstellar environment. We constrained the magnetic activity levels of h\nPer members measuring their X-ray emission from a Chandra observation, while\nP_rot were obtained by Moraux et al. (2013). We collected a final catalog of\n414 h Per members with known P_rot, T_eff, M_star, with 169 of them having also\ndetected X-ray emission. We found that h Per members, with 1.0 M_sun < M_star <\n1.4 M_sun, display different activity regimes: fast rotators show\nsupersaturation, while slower rotators have activity levels compatible to the\nnon-saturated regime. At 13 Myr h Per is therefore the youngest cluster showing\nactivity-rotation regimes analogous to that of MS stars, indicating that, at\nthis age, magnetic field production is likely regulated by the alpha-Omega type\ndynamo. Moreover we observed that supersaturation is better described by P_rot\nthan Ro, and that the observed patterns are compatible with the hypothesis of\ncentrifugal stripping. In this scenario we inferred that coronae can produce\nstructures as large as ~2 R_star above the stellar surface.\n", "  The jet composition and energy dissipation mechanism of Gamma-ray bursts\n(GRBs) and Blazars are fundamental questions which remain not fully understood.\nOne plausible model is to interpret the $\\gamma$-ray emission of GRBs and\noptical emission of blazars as synchrotron radiation of electrons accelerated\nfrom the collision-induced magnetic dissipation regions in\nPoynting-flux-dominated jets. The polarization observation is an important and\nindependent information to test this model. Based on our recent 3D relativistic\nMHD simulations of collision-induced magnetic dissipation of magnetically\ndominated blobs, here we perform calculations of the polarization properties of\nthe emission in the dissipation region and apply the results to model the\npolarization observational data of GRB prompt emission and blazar optical\nemission. We show that the same numerical model with different input parameters\ncan reproduce well the observational data of both GRBs and blazars, especially\nthe $90^{\\circ}$ polarization angle (PA) change in GRB 100826A and the\n$180^{\\circ}$ PA swing in Blazar 3C279. This supports a unified model for GRB\nand blazar jets, suggesting that collision-induced magnetic reconnection is a\ncommon physical mechanism to power the relativistic jet emission from events\nwith very different black hole masses.\n", "  The dust extinction curve is a critical component of many observational\nprograms and an important diagnostic of the physics of the interstellar medium.\nHere we present new measurements of the dust extinction curve and its variation\ntowards tens of thousands of stars, a hundred-fold larger sample than in\nexisting detailed studies. We use data from the APOGEE spectroscopic survey in\ncombination with ten-band photometry from Pan-STARRS1, 2MASS, and WISE. We find\nthat the extinction curve in the optical through infrared is well characterized\nby a one-parameter family of curves described by R(V). The extinction curve is\nmore uniform than suggested in past works, with sigma(R(V)) = 0.18, and with\nless than one percent of sight lines having R(V) > 4. Our data and analysis\nhave revealed two new aspects of Galactic extinction: first, we find\nsignificant, wide-area variations in R(V) throughout the Galactic plane. These\nvariations are on scales much larger than individual molecular clouds,\nindicating that R(V) variations must trace much more than just grain growth in\ndense molecular environments. Indeed, we find no correlation between R(V) and\ndust column density up to E(B-V) ~ 2. Second, we discover a strong relationship\nbetween R(V) and the far-infrared dust emissivity.\n", "  In this paper we show that the excess of the tau tau events with respect to\nthe Standard Model background predictions, observed by the ATLAS and CMS\ncollaborations and interpreted as the evidence of the Higgs-boson decay into a\npair of tau-leptons, may be accounted for by properly taking into account QED\nradiative corrections in the modelling of the Z/gamma* -> tau tau background.\n", "  Clouds have been shown to be present in many exoplanetary atmospheres. Cloud\nformation modeling predicts considerable inhomogeneities of cloud cover,\nconsistent with optical phase curve observations. However, optical phase curves\ncannot resolve some existing degeneracies between cloud location and cloud\noptical properties.\n  We present a conceptually simple technique to detect inhomogeneous cloud\ncover on exoplanets. Such an inhomogeneous cloud cover produces an asymmetric\nprimary transit of the planet in front of the host star. Asymmetric transits\nproduce characteristic residuals compared to a standard symmetric model.\nFurthermore, bisector spans can be used to determine asymmetries in the transit\nlight curve.\n  We apply a model of asymmetric transits to the light curves of HAT-P-7b,\nKepler-7b and HD209458b and search for possible cloud signatures. The nearly\nuninterrupted Kepler photometry is particularly well-suited for this method\nsince it allows for a very high time resolution.\n  We do not find any statistically sound cloud signature in the data of the\nconsidered planets. For HAT-P-7b, a tentative detection of an asymmetric cloud\ncover is found, consistent with analysis of the optical phase curve. Based on\nBayesian probability arguments, a symmetric model with an offset in the transit\nephemeris remains, however, the most viable model. Still, this work\ndemonstrates that for suitable targets, namely low-gravity planets around\nbright stars, the method can be used to constrain cloud cover characteristics\nand is thus a helpful additional tool to study exoplanetary atmospheres.\n", "  Regular spaceborne measurements have revealed that solar brightness varies on\nmultiple timescales, variations on timescales greater than a day being\nattributed to surface magnetic field. Independently, ground-based and\nspaceborne measurements suggest that Sun-like stars show a similar, but\nsignificantly broader pattern of photometric variability.\n  To understand whether the broader pattern of stellar variations is consistent\nwith the solar paradigm we assess relative contributions of faculae and spots\nto solar magnetically-driven brightness variability. We investigate how the\nsolar brightness variability as well as its facular and spot contributions\ndepend on the wavelength, timescale of variability, and position of the\nobserver relative to the ecliptic plane.\n  We perform calculations with the SATIRE model, which returns solar brightness\nwith daily cadence from solar disc area coverages of various magnetic features.\n  Moving the observer away from the ecliptic plane increases the amplitude of\n11-year variability as it would be seen in Str\\\"omgren $(b+y)/2$ photometry,\nbut decreases the amplitude of the rotational brightness variations as it would\nappear in Kepler and CoRoT passbands. The spot and facular contributions to the\n11-year solar variability in the Str\\\"omgren $(b+y)/2$ photometry almost fully\ncompensate each other so that the Sun appears anomalously quiet with respect to\nits stellar cohort. Such a compensation does not occur on the rotational\ntimescale.\n  The rotational solar brightness variability as it would appear in Kepler and\nCoRoT passband from the ecliptic plane is spot-dominated but the relative\ncontribution of faculae increases for out-of-ecliptic viewing so that the\napparent brightness variations are faculae-dominated for inclinations less than\nabout $i=45^{\\circ}$.\n", "  Planets around binary stars and those in multiplanet systems may experience\nresonant eccentricity excitation and disruption due to perturbations from a\ndistant stellar companion. This \"evection resonance\" occurs when the apsidal\nprecession frequency of the planet, driven by the quadrupole associated with\nthe inner binary or the other planets, matches the orbital frequency of the\nexternal companion. We develop an analytic theory to study the effects of\nevection resonance on circumbinary planets and multiplanet systems. We derive\nthe general conditions for effective eccentricity excitation or resonance\ncapture of the planet as the system undergoes long-term evolution. Applying to\ncircumbinary planets, we show that inward planet migration may lead to\neccentricity growth due to evection resonance with an external perturber, and\nplanets around shrinking binaries may not survive the resonant eccentricity\ngrowth. On the other hand, significant eccentricity excitation in multiplanet\nsystems occurs in limited parameter space of planet and binary semimajor axes,\nand requires the planetary migration to be sufficiently slow.\n", "  In the scalar-tensor theories with a massive scalar field the coupling\nconstants, and the coupling functions in general, which are observationally\nallowed, can differ significantly from those in the massless case. This fact\nnaturally implies that the scalar-tensor neutron stars with a massive scalar\nfield can have rather different structure and properties in comparison with\ntheir counterparts in the massless case and in general relativity. In the\npresent paper we study slowly rotating neutron stars in scalar-tensor theories\nwith a massive gravitational scalar. Two examples of scalar-tensor theories are\nexamined - the first example is the massive Brans-Dicke theory and the second\none is a massive scalar-tensor theory indistinguishable from general relativity\nin the weak field limit. In the later case we study the effect of the scalar\nfield mass on the spontaneous scalarization of neutron stars. Our numerical\nresults show that the inclusion of a mass term for the scalar field indeed\nchanges the picture drastically compared to the massless case. It turns out\nthat mass, radius and moment of inertia for neutron stars in massive\nscalar-tensor theories can differ drastically from the pure general\nrelativistic solutions if sufficiently large masses of the scalar field are\nconsidered.\n", "  The effects of local Lorentz violation on dispersion and birefringence of\ngravitational waves are investigated. The covariant dispersion relation for\ngravitational waves involving gauge-invariant Lorentz-violating operators of\narbitrary mass dimension is constructed. The chirp signal from the\ngravitational-wave event GW150914 is used to place numerous first constraints\non gravitational Lorentz violation.\n", "  We study the one-dimensional, longitudinally boost-invariant motion of an\nideal fluid with infinite conductivity in the presence of a transverse magnetic\nfield, i.e., in the ideal transverse magnetohydrodynamical limit. In an\nextension of our previous work Roy et al., [Phys. Lett. B 750, 45 (2015)], we\nconsider the fluid to have a non-zero magnetization. First, we assume a\nconstant magnetic susceptibility $\\chi_{m}$ and consider an ultrarelativistic\nideal gas equation of state. For a paramagnetic fluid (i.e., with\n$\\chi_{m}>0$), the decay of the energy density slows down since the fluid gains\nenergy from the magnetic field. For a diamagnetic fluid (i.e., with\n$\\chi_{m}<0$), the energy density decays faster because it feeds energy into\nthe magnetic field. Furthermore, when the magnetic field is taken to be\nexternal and to decay in proper time $\\tau$ with a power law $\\sim\\tau^{-a}$,\ntwo distinct solutions can be found depending on the values of $a$ and\n$\\chi_m$. Finally, we also solve the ideal magnetohydrodynamical equations for\none-dimensional Bjorken flow with a temperature-dependent magnetic\nsusceptibility and a realistic equation of state given by lattice-QCD data. We\nfind that the temperature and energy density decay more slowly because of the\nnon-vanishing magnetization. For values of the magnetic field typical for\nheavy-ion collisions, this effect is, however, rather small. Only for magnetic\nfields which are about an order of magnitude larger than expected for heavy-ion\ncollisions, the system is substantially reheated and the lifetime of the quark\nphase might be extended.\n", "  By means of one-step model calculations the strong in-plane anisotropy seen\nin angle-resolved photoemission of the well-known iron pnictide prototype\ncompounds BaFe$_2$As$_2$ and Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$As$_2$ in their\nlow-temperature antiferromagnetic phases is investigated. The\nfully-relativistic calculations are based on the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker-Green\nfunction approach combined with the coherent potential approximation alloy\ntheory to account for the disorder induced by Co substitution on Fe sites in a\nreliable way. The results of the calculations can be compared directly to\nexperimental spectra of detwinned single crystals. One finds very good\nagreement with experiment and can reveal all features of the electronic\nstructure contributing to the in-plane anisotropy. In particular the local\ndensity approximation can capture most of the correlation effects for the\ninvestigated system without the need for more advanced techniques. In addition,\nthe evolution of the anisotropy for increasing Co concentration $x$ in\nBa(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$As$_2$ can be tracked almost continuously. The results\nare also used to discuss surface effects and it is possible to identify clear\nsignatures to conclude about different types of surface termination.\n", "  Short Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are explosions of cosmic origin believed to be\nassociated with the merger of two compact objects, either two neutron stars, or\na neutron star and a black hole. The presence of at least one neutron star has\nlong been thought to be an essential element of the model: its tidal disruption\nprovides the needed baryonic material whose rapid accretion onto the\npost-merger black hole powers the burst. The recent tentative detection by the\nFermi satellite of a short GRB in association with the gravitational wave\nsignal GW150914 produced by the merger of two black holes has challenged this\nstandard paradigm. Here we show that the evolution of two high-mass,\nlow-metallicity stars with main sequence rotational speeds a few tens of\npercent of the critical speed eventually undergoing a weak supernova explosion\n{\\em can} produce a short gamma-ray burst. The outer layers of the envelope of\nthe last exploding star remain bound and circularize at large radii. With time,\nthe disk cools and becomes neutral, suppressing the magneto-rotational\ninstability, and hence the viscosity. The disk remains 'long-lived dead' until\ntidal torques and shocks during the pre-merger phase heat it up and re-ignite\naccretion, rapidly consuming the disk and powering the short gamma-ray burst.\n", "  The interactions between magnetic islands are considered to play an important\nrole in electron acceleration during magnetic reconnection. In this paper,\ntwo-dimensional (2-D) particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations are performed to study\nelectron acceleration during multiple X line reconnection with a guide field.\nThe electrons remain almost magnetized, and we can then analyze the\ncontributions of the parallel electric field, Fermi and betatron mechanisms to\nelectron acceleration during the evolution of magnetic reconnection by\ncomparing with a guide-center theory. The results show that with the proceeding\nof magnetic reconnection, two magnetic islands are formed in the simulation\ndomain. The electrons are accelerated by both the parallel electric field in\nthe vicinity of the X lines and Fermi mechanism due to the contraction of the\ntwo magnetic islands. Then the two magnetic islands begin to merge into one,\nand in such a process electrons can be accelerated by the parallel electric\nfield and betatron mechanisms. During the betatron acceleration, the electrons\nare locally accelerated in the regions where the magnetic field is piled up by\nthe high-speed flow from the X line. At last, when the coalescence of the two\nislands into a big one finishes, electrons can further be accelerated by the\nFermi mechanism because of the contraction of the big island. With the increase\nof the guide field, the contributions of Fermi and betatron mechanisms to\nelectron acceleration become less and less important. When the guide field is\nsufficiently large, the contributions of Fermi and betatron mechanisms are\nalmost negligible.\n", "  We present continuum images of the \"Galactic Center Mini-spiral\" of 100, 250,\nand 340 GHz bands with the analysis of the Cy.0 data acquired from the Atacama\nLarge Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) archive. Pretty good UV coverage of\nthe data and the \"self-calibration\" method give us an opportunity to obtain\ndynamic ranges of over 2x10^4 in the resultant maps of the 250 and 340 GHz\nbands. In particular the image of the 340 GHz band has high dynamic ranges\nunprecedented in sub-millimeter wave. The angular resolutions attain to\n1.57\"x1.33\" in the 100 GHz band, 0.63\"x0.53\" in the 250 GHz band, and\n0.44\"x0.38\" in the 340 GHz band, respectively. The continuum images clearly\ndepict the \"Mini-spiral\", which is an ionized gas stream in the vicinity of Sgr\nA*. We found the tight correlation between the dust emission peaks and the\nOB/WR stars in the Northern-arm of the \"Mini-spiral\". The core mass function of\nthe dust core identified by the clumpfind algorithm would obey the flat\npower-law dN/dM=aM^-1.5+/-0.4 on the high-mass side. These support the scenario\nthat the star forming cloud has fallen into the immediate vicinity of Sgr A*\nfor the origin of the Central cluster.\n", "  In Taylor's theory, the longitudinal dispersion in turbulent pipe flows\napproaches, on long timescales, a diffusive behavior with a constant\ndiffusivity $K_L$, that depends \\emph{empirically} on the Reynolds number $Re$.\nWe show that the dependence on $Re$ can be determined from the turbulent energy\nspectrum. By using the intimate connection between the friction factor and\nlongitudinal dispersion in wall-bounded turbulence, we predict different\nasymptotic scaling laws of $K_L(Re)$ depending on the different turbulent\ncascades in two-dimensional turbulence. We also explore numerically the\n$K_L(Re)$ dependence in turbulent channel flows with smooth and rough walls\nusing a lattice Boltzmann method.\n", "  Cosmology experiments at mm-wavelengths can detect Planet Nine if it is the\nsize of Neptune, has an effective temperature of 40 K, and is 700 AU from the\nSun. It would appear as a ~30 mJy source at 1 mm with an annual parallax of ~5\narcmin. The challenge is to distinguish it from the approximately 4000\nforeground asteroids brighter than 30 mJy. Fortunately, these asteroids are\nknown to the Minor Planet Center and can be identified because they move across\na resolution element in a matter of hours, orders of magnitude faster than\nPlanet Nine. If Planet Nine is smaller, colder, and/or more distant than\nexpected, then it could be as faint as 1 mJy at 1 mm. There are roughly $10^6$\nasteroids this bright and many are unknown, making current cosmology\nexperiments confusion limited for moving sources. Nonetheless, it may still be\npossible to find the proverbial needle in the haystack using a matched filter.\nThis would require mm telescopes with high angular resolution and high\nsensitivity in order to alleviate confusion and to enable the identification of\nmoving sources with relatively short time baselines. Regardless of its mm flux\ndensity, searching for Planet Nine would require frequent radio measurements\nfor large swaths of the sky, including the ecliptic and Galactic plane. Even if\nPlanet Nine had already been detected by other means, measuring its mm-flux\nwould constrain its internal energy budget, and therefore help resolve the\nmystery of Uranus and Neptune, which have vastly different internal heat.\n", "  We present a study of the statistical flare rates of M dwarfs (dMs) with\nclose white dwarf (WD) companions (WD+dM; typical separations < 1 au). Our\nprevious analysis demonstrated that dMs with close WD companions are more\nmagnetically active than their field counterparts. One likely implication of\nhaving a close binary companion is increased stellar rotation through\ndisk-disruption, tidal effects, and/or angular momentum exchange; increased\nstellar rotation has long been associated with an increase in stellar activity.\nPrevious studies show a strong correlation between dMs that are magnetically\nactive (showing H{\\alpha} in emission) and the frequency of stellar flare\nrates. We examine the difference between the flare rates observed in close\nWD+dM binary systems and field dMs. Our sample consists of a subset of 181\nclose WD+dM pairs from Morgan et al. (2012) observed in the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey Stripe 82, where we obtain multi-epoch observations in the Sloan\nugriz-bands. We find an increase in the overall flaring fraction in the close\nWD+dM pairs (0.09$\\pm$0.03%) compared to the field dMs (0.0108$\\pm$0.0007%;\nKowalski et al. 2009) and a lower flaring fraction for active WD+dMs\n(0.05$\\pm$0.03%) compared to active dMs (0.28$\\pm$0.05%; Kowalski et al. 2009).\nWe discuss how our results constrain both the single and binary dM flare rates.\nOur results also constrain dM multiplicity, our knowledge of the Galactic\ntransient background, and may be important for the habitability of attending\nplanets around dMs with close companions.\n", "  An erroneous interpretation of the hydrodynamical results led to an incorrect\ndetermination of the fallback masses in Ugliano et al. (2012), which also (on a\nsmaller level) affects the neutron star masses provided in that paper. This\nproblem was already addressed and corrected in the follow-up works by Ertl et\nal. (2015) and Sukhbold et al. (2015). Therefore, the reader is advised to use\nthe new data of the latter two publications. In the remaining text of this\nErratum we present the differences of the old and new fallback results in\ndetail and explain the origin of the mistake in the original analysis by\nUgliano et al. (2012).\n", "  Level-crossing spectroscopy involves lifting the degeneracy of an excited\nstate and using the interference of two nearly degenerate levels to measure the\nexcited state lifetime. Here we use the idea of interference between different\npathways to study the momentum-dependent wave packet lifetime due an excited\nstate level-crossing (conical intersection) in a molecule. Changes in\npopulation from the wave packet propagation are reflected in the detected\nfluorescence. We use a chirped pulse to control the wave packet momentum.\nChanging the chirp rate affects the transition to the lower state through the\nconical intersection. It also affects the interference of different pathways in\nthe upper electronic state, due to the geometric phase acquired. Increasing the\nchirp rate decreases the coherence of the wave packet in the upper electronic\nstate. This suggests that there is a finite momentum dependent lifetime of the\nwave packet through the level-crossing as function of chirp. We dub this\nlifetime the wave packet momentum lifetime.\n", "  We present an asteroseismological study of SDSS J0349-0059 and VV 47 aimed\nmainly at deriving their total mass on the basis of state-of-the-art PG 1159\nevolutionary models. We compute adiabatic nonradial $g$-mode pulsation periods\nfor PG 1159 evolutionary models with stellar masses ranging from $0.515$ to\n$0.741\\ M_{\\sun}$, that take into account the complete evolution of the\nprogenitor stars. We first estimate a mean period spacing for both SDSS\nJ0349-0059 and VV 47. By comparing the observed period spacing with the\nasymptotic period spacing we obtain $M_{\\star}\\sim 0.569\\ M_{\\sun}$ for SDSS\nJ0349-0059 and $M_{\\star}\\sim 0.523\\ M_{\\sun}$ for VV 47. If we compare the\nobserved period spacing with the average of the computed period spacings we\nfound $M_{\\star}\\sim 0.535\\ M_{\\sun}$ for SDSS J0349-0059 and $M_{\\star}\\sim\n0.528 M_{\\sun}$ for VV 47. Searching for the best period fit we found, in the\ncase of SDSS J0349-0059, an asteroseismological model with $M_{\\star}= 0.542\\\nM_{\\sun}$ and $T_{\\rm eff}= 91\\, 255\\ $K. For VV 47, we could not find a unique\nand unambiguous asteroseismological model. Finally, for SDSS J0349-0059, we\ndetermined the rotation period as being $P_{\\rm rot}= 1/\\Omega \\sim 0.407$\ndays. The results presented in this work constitute a further step in the study\nof GW Vir stars through asteroseismology in the frame of fully evolutionary\nmodels of PG 1159 stars. In particular, once again it is shown the potential of\nasteroseismology to derive stellar masses of PG 1159 stars with an\nunprecedented precision.\n", "  (Abridged) By using an N-body simulation of a bulge that was formed via a bar\ninstability mechanism, we analyse the imprints of the initial (i.e. before bar\nformation) location of stars on the bulge kinematics, in particular on the\nheliocentric radial velocity distribution of bulge stars. Four different\nlatitudes were considered: $b=-4^\\circ$, $-6^\\circ$, $-8^\\circ$, and\n$-10^\\circ$, along the bulge minor axis as well as outside it, at\n$l=\\pm5^\\circ$ and $l=\\pm10^\\circ$. The bulge X-shaped structure comprises\nstars that formed in the disk at different locations. Stars formed in the outer\ndisk, beyond the end of the bar, which are part of the boxy peanut-bulge\nstructure may show peaks in the velocity distributions at positive and negative\nheliocentric radial velocities with high absolute values that can be larger\nthan 100 $\\rm km$ $\\rm s^{-1}$, depending on the observed direction. In some\ncases the structure of the velocity field is more complex and several peaks are\nobserved. Stars formed in the inner disk, the most numerous, contribute\npredominantly to the X-shaped structure and present different kinematic\ncharacteristics. Our results may enable us to interpret the cold high-velocity\npeak observed in the APOGEE commissioning data, as well as the excess of\nhigh-velocity stars in the near and far arms of the X-shaped structure at\n$l$=$0^\\circ$ and $b$=$-6^\\circ$. When compared with real data, the kinematic\npicture becomes more complex due to the possible presence in the observed\nsamples of classical bulge and/or thick disk stars. Overall, our results point\nto the existence of complex patterns and structures in the bulge velocity\nfields, which are generated by the bar. This suggests that caution should be\nused when interpreting the bulge kinematics: the presence of substructures,\npeaks and clumps in the velocity fields is not necessarily a sign of past\naccretion events.\n", "  We study the dynamics and the phase-space structures of Coulombic and\nself-gravitating versions of the classical one-dimensional 3-body system with\nperiodic boundary conditions. We demonstrate that such a 3-body system may be\nreduced isomorphically to a spatially periodic system of a single particle\nexperiencing a two-dimensional potential on a rhombic plane. For the case of\nboth Coulombic and gravitational versions, exact expressions of the Hamiltonian\nhave been derived in rhombic coordinates. We simulate the phase-space evolution\nthrough an event-driven algorithm that utilizes analytic solutions to the\nequations of motion. The simulation results show that the motion exhibits\nchaotic, quasiperiodic, and periodic behaviors in segmented regions of the\nphase space. While there is no evidence of global chaos in either the Coulombic\nor the gravitational system, the former exhibits a transition from a completely\nnon-chaotic phase space at low energies to a mixed behavior. Gradual yet\nstriking transitions from mild to intense chaos are indicated with changing\nenergy, a behavior that differentiates the spatially periodic systems studied\nin this paper from the well-understood free-boundary versions of the 3-body\nproblem. Our treatment of the 3-body systems is the first one of its kind and\nopens avenues for analysis of the dynamical properties exhibited by spatially\nperiodic versions of various classes of systems studied in plasma and\ngravitational physics as well as in cosmology.\n", "  A Hubble diagram (HD) has recently been constructed in the redshift range\n0<z<6.5 using a non-linear relation between the ultraviolet and X-ray\nluminosities of QSOs. The Type Ia SN HD has already provided a high-precision\ntest of cosmological models, but the fact that the QSO distribution extends\nwell beyond the supernova range (z<1.8), in principle provides us with an\nimportant complementary diagnostic whose significantly greater leverage in z\ncan impose tighter constraints on the distance versus redshift relationship. In\nthis paper, we therefore perform an independent test of nine different\ncosmological models, among which six are expanding, while three are static.\nMany of these are disfavoured by other kinds of observations (including the\naforementioned Type Ia SNe). We wish to examine whether the QSO HD confirms or\nrejects these earlier conclusions. We find that four of these models\n(Einstein-de Sitter, the Milne universe, the Static Universe with simple tired\nlight and the Static universe with plasma tired light) are excluded at the >99%\nC.L. The Quasi-Steady State Model is excluded at >95% C.L. The remaining four\nmodels (Lambda-CDM/wCDM, the R_h=ct Universe, the Friedmann open universe and a\nStatic universe with a linear Hubble law) all pass the test. However, only\nLambda-CDM/wCDM and $R_{\\rm h}=ct$ also pass the Alcock-Paczynski (AP) test.\nThe optimized parameters in Lambda-CDM/wCDM are Omega_m=0.20^{+0.24}_{-0.20}\nand w_{de}=-1.2^{+1.6}_{-infinity} (the dark-energy equation-of-state).\nCombined with the AP test, these values become Omega_m=0.38^{+0.20}_{-0.19} and\nw_{de}=-0.28^{+0.52}_{-0.40}. But whereas this optimization of parameters in\nLambda-CDM/wCDM creates some tension with their concordance values, the $R_{\\rm\nh}=ct$ Universe has the advantage of fitting the QSO and AP data without any\nfree parameters.\n", "  The Fermi-LAT \\gamma-ray data have been used to study the morphological and\nspectral features of the so-called GeV excess - a diffuse radiation component\nrecently discovered towards the Galactic centre. We used the likelihood method\nto analyze Fermi-LAT data. Our study does confirm the existence of such an\nextra component in the diffuse \\gamma-ray emission at GeV energies. Based on a\ndetailed morphological analysis, a spatial template that fits the data best was\ngenerated and adopted. Using this template, the energy distribution of\n\\gamma-rays was derived in the 0.3-30 GeV energy interval. The spectrum\nappeared to have less distinct ('bump'-like) structure than previous reported.\nWe argue that the morphology of this radiation component has a bipolar rather\nthan a spherically symmetric structure as has been assumed a priori in previous\nstudies. This finding excludes the associations of the GeV excess with Dark\nMatter. We briefly discuss the radiation mechanisms and possible source\npopulations that could be responsible for this new component of diffuse gamma\nradiation.\n", "  We present numerical simulations of reduced magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD)\nturbulence in a magnetic flux tube at the center of a polar coronal hole. The\nmodel for the background atmosphere is a solution of the momentum equation, and\nincludes the effects of wave pressure on the solar wind outflow. Alfv\\'{e}n\nwaves are launched at the coronal base, and reflect at various heights due to\nvariations in Alfv\\'{e}n speed and outflow velocity. The turbulence is driven\nby nonlinear interactions between the counter-propagating Alfv\\'{e}n waves.\nResults are presented for two models of the background atmosphere. In the first\nmodel the plasma density and Alfv\\'{e}n speed vary smoothly with height,\nresulting in minimal wave reflections and low energy dissipation rates. We find\nthat the dissipation rate is insufficient to maintain the temperature of the\nbackground atmosphere. The standard phenomenological formula for the\ndissipation rate significantly overestimates the rate derived from our RMHD\nsimulations, and a revised formula is proposed. In the second model we\nintroduce additional density variations along the flux tube with a correlation\nlength of 0.04 $R_\\odot$ and with relative amplitude of $10 \\%$. These density\nvariations simulate the effects of compressive MHD waves on the Alfv\\'{e}n\nwaves. We find that such variations significantly enhance the wave reflection\nand thereby the turbulent dissipation rates, producing enough heat to maintain\nthe background atmosphere. We conclude that interactions between Alfv\\'{e}n-\nand compressive waves may play an important role in the turbulent heating of\nthe fast solar wind.\n", "  We investigate the cosmological applications of a bi-scalar modified gravity\nthat exhibits partial conformal invariance, which could become full conformal\ninvariance in the absence of the usual Einstein-Hilbert term and introducing\nadditionally either the Weyl derivative or properly rescaled fields. Such a\ntheory is constructed by considering the action of a non-minimally\nconformally-coupled scalar field, and adding a second scalar allowing for a\nnonminimal derivative coupling with the Einstein tensor and the energy-momentum\ntensor of the first field. At a cosmological framework we obtain an effective\ndark-energy sector constituted from both scalars. In the absence of an explicit\nmatter sector we extract analytical solutions, which for some parameter regions\ncorrespond to an effective matter era and/or to an effective radiation era,\nthus the two scalars give rise to \"mimetic dark matter\" or to \"dark radiation\"\nrespectively. In the case where an explicit matter sector is included we obtain\na cosmological evolution in agreement with observations, that is a transition\nfrom matter to dark energy era, with the onset of cosmic acceleration.\nFurthermore, for particular parameter regions, the effective dark-energy\nequation of state can transit to the phantom regime at late times. These\nbehaviours reveal the capabilities of the theory, since they arise purely from\nthe novel, bi-scalar construction and the involved couplings between the two\nfields.\n", "  Most of the celestial gamma rays detected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT)\naboard the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope originate from the interstellar\nmedium when energetic cosmic rays interact with interstellar nucleons and\nphotons. Conventional point and extended source studies rely on the modeling of\nthis diffuse emission for accurate characterization. We describe here the\ndevelopment of the Galactic Interstellar Emission Model (GIEM) that is the\nstandard adopted by the LAT Collaboration and is publicly available. The model\nis based on a linear combination of maps for interstellar gas column density in\nGalactocentric annuli and for the inverse Compton emission produced in the\nGalaxy. We also include in the GIEM large-scale structures like Loop I and the\nFermi bubbles. The measured gas emissivity spectra confirm that the cosmic-ray\nproton density decreases with Galactocentric distance beyond 5 kpc from the\nGalactic Center. The measurements also suggest a softening of the proton\nspectrum with Galactocentric distance. We observe that the Fermi bubbles have\nboundaries with a shape similar to a catenary at latitudes below 20 degrees and\nwe observe an enhanced emission toward their base extending in the North and\nSouth Galactic direction and located within 4 degrees of the Galactic Center.\n", "  Hydrostatic models of Wolf-Rayet stars typically contain low-density outer\nenvelopes that inflate the stellar radii by a factor of several and are capped\nby a denser shell of gas. Inflated envelopes and density inversions are\nhallmarks of envelopes that become super-Eddington as they cross the iron-group\nopacity peak, but these features disappear when mass loss is sufficiently\nrapid. We re-examine the structures of steady, spherically symmetric wind\nsolutions that cross a sonic point at high optical depth, identifying the\nphysical mechanism by which outflow affects the stellar structure, and provide\nan improved analytical estimate for the critical mass loss rate above which\nextended structures are erased. Weak-flow solutions below this limit resemble\nhydrostatic stars even in supersonic zones; however, we infer that these fail\nto successfully launch optically thick winds. Wolf-Rayet envelopes will\ntherefore likely correspond to the strong, compact solutions. We also find that\nwind solutions with negligible gas pressure are stably stratified at and below\nthe sonic point. This implies that convection is not the source of variability\nin Wolf-Rayet stars, as has been suggested; but, acoustic instabilities provide\nan alternative explanation. Our solutions are limited to high optical depths by\nour neglect of Doppler enhancements to the opacity, and do not account for\nacoustic instabilities at high Eddington factors; yet they provide useful\ninsights into Wolf-Rayet stellar structures.\n", "  The recently renewed interest in a possible additional major body in the\nouter solar system prompted us to study the thermodynamic evolution of such an\nobject. We assumed that it is a smaller version of Uranus and Neptune. We\nmodeled the temporal evolution of the radius, temperature, intrinsic\nluminosity, and the blackbody spectrum of distant ice giant planets. The aim is\nalso to provide estimates of the magnitudes in different bands to assess\nwhether the object might be detectable. Simulations of the cooling and\ncontraction were conducted for ice giants with masses of 5, 10, 20, and 50\nMearth that are located at 280, 700, and 1120 AU from the Sun. The core\ncomposition, the fraction of H/He, the efficiency of energy transport, and the\ninitial luminosity were varied. The atmospheric opacity was set to 1, 50, and\n100 times solar metallicity. We find for a nominal 10 Mearth planet at 700 AU\nat the current age of the solar system an effective temperature of 47 K, much\nhigher than the equilibrium temperature of about 10 K, a radius of 3.7 Rearth,\nand an intrinsic luminosity of 0.006 Ljupiter. It has estimated apparent\nmagnitudes of Johnson V, R, I, L, N, Q of 21.7, 21.4, 21.0, 20.1, 19.9, and\n10.7, and WISE W1-W4 magnitudes of 20.1, 20.1, 18.6, and 10.2. The Q and W4\nband and other observations longward of about 13 microns pick up the intrinsic\nflux. If candidate Planet 9 has a significant H/He layer and an efficient\nenergy transport in the interior, then its luminosity is dominated by the\nintrinsic contribution, making it a self-luminous planet. At a likely position\non its orbit near aphelion, we estimate for a mass of 5, 10, 20, and 50 Mearth\na V magnitude from the reflected light of 24.3, 23.7, 23.3, and 22.6 and a Q\nmagnitude from the intrinsic radiation of 14.6, 11.7, 9.2, and 5.8. The latter\nwould probably have been detected by past surveys.\n", "  Magnetohydrodynamic waves are believed to play a significant role in coronal\nheating, and could be used for remote diagnostics of solar plasma. Both the\nheating and diagnostic applications rely on a correct inversion (or backward\nmodelling) of the observables into the thermal and magnetic structures of the\nplasma. However, owing to the limited availability of observables, this is an\nill-posed issue. Forward Modelling is to establish a plausible mapping of\nplasma structuring into observables. In this study, we set up forward models of\nstanding kink modes in coronal loops and simulate optically thin emissions in\nthe extreme ultraviolet bandpasses, and then adjust plasma parameters and\nviewing angles to match three events of transverse loop oscillations observed\nby the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly. We demonstrate\nthat forward models could be effectively used to identify the oscillation\novertone and polarization, to reproduce the general profile of oscillation\namplitude and phase, and to predict multiple harmonic periodicities in the\nassociated emission intensity and loop width variation.\n", "  We investigate data from the Galactic Effelsberg--Bonn HI Survey (EBHIS),\nsupplemented with data from the third release of the Galactic All Sky Survey\n(GASS III) observed at Parkes. We explore the all sky distribution of the local\nGalactic HI gas with $|v_{\\rm LSR}| < 25 $ kms$^{-1}$ on angular scales of 11'\nto 16'. Unsharp masking (USM) is applied to extract small scale features. We\nfind cold filaments that are aligned with polarized dust emission and conclude\nthat the cold neutral medium (CNM) is mostly organized in sheets that are,\nbecause of projection effects, observed as filaments. These filaments are\nassociated with dust ridges, aligned with the magnetic field measured on the\nstructures by Planck at 353 GHz. The CNM above latitudes $|b|>20^\\circ$ is\ndescribed by a log-normal distribution, with a median Doppler temperature\n$T_{\\rm D} = 223$ K, derived from observed line widths that include turbulent\ncontributions. The median neutral hydrogen (HI) column density is $N_{\\rm HI}\n\\simeq 10^{19.1}\\,{\\rm cm^{-2}}$. These CNM structures are embedded within a\nwarm neutral medium (WNM) with $N_{\\rm HI} \\simeq 10^{20} {\\rm cm^{-2}}$.\nAssuming an average distance of 100 pc, we derive for the CNM sheets a\nthickness of $< 0.3$ pc. Adopting a magnetic field strength of $B_{\\rm tot} =\n(6.0 \\pm 1.8)\\mu$G, proposed by Heiles & Troland 2005, and assuming that the\nCNM filaments are confined by magnetic pressure, we estimate a thickness of\n0.09 pc. Correspondingly the median volume density is in the range $ 14 < n <\n47 {\\rm cm^{-3}}$.\n", "  We present a near-IR survey for the visual multiples in the Orion molecular\nclouds region at separations between 100 and 1000 AU. These data were acquired\nat 1.6~$\\mu$m with the NICMOS and WFC3 cameras on the Hubble Space Telescope.\nAdditional photometry was obtained for some of the sources at 2.05~$\\mu$m with\nNICMOS and in the $L'$-band with NSFCAM2 on the IRTF. Towards 129 protostars\nand 197 pre-main sequence stars with disks observed with WFC3, we detect 21 and\n28 candidate companions between the projected separations of 100---1000 AU, of\nwhich less than 5 and 8, respectively, are chance line of sight coincidences.\nThe resulting companion fraction ($CF$) after the correction for the line of\nsight contamination is 14.4$^{+1.1}_{-1.3}$% for protostars and\n12.5$^{+1.2}_{-0.8}$% for the pre-main sequence stars. These values are similar\nto those found for main sequence stars, suggesting that there is little\nvariation in the $CF$ with evolution, although several observational biases may\nmask a decrease in the $CF$ from protostars to the main sequence stars. After\nsegregating the sample into two populations based on the surrounding surface\ndensity of YSOs, we find that the $CF$ in the high stellar density regions\n($\\Sigma_{YSO} > 45$~pc$^{-2}$) is approximately 50% higher than that found in\nthe low stellar density regions ($\\Sigma_{YSO} < 45$~pc$^{-2}$). We interpret\nthis as evidence for the elevated formation of companions at 100 to 1000 AU in\nthe denser environments of Orion. We discuss possible reasons for this elevated\nformation.\n", "  We introduce the Evolution of 21-cm Structure (EOS) project: providing\nperiodic, public releases of the latest cosmological 21-cm simulations. 21-cm\ninterferometry is set to revolutionize studies of the Cosmic Dawn (CD) and\nepoch of reionization (EoR), eventually resulting in 3D maps of the first\nbillion years of our Universe. Progress will depend on sophisticated data\nanalysis pipelines, which are in turn tested on large-scale mock observations.\nHere we present the 2016 EOS data release, consisting of the largest (1.6 Gpc\non side with a 1024^3 grid), public 21-cm simulations of the CD and EoR. We\ninclude calibrated, sub-grid prescriptions for inhomogeneous recombinations and\nphoto-heating suppression of star formation in small mass galaxies. We present\ntwo simulation runs that approximately bracket the contribution from faint\nunseen galaxies. From these two extremes, we predict that the duration of\nreionization (defined as a change in the mean neutral fraction from 0.9 to 0.1)\nshould be between 2.7 < Delta z < 5.7. The large-scale 21-cm power during the\nadvanced EoR stages can be different by up to a factor of ~10, depending on the\nmodel. This difference has a comparable contribution from: (i) the typical bias\nof sources; and (ii) a more efficient negative feedback in models with an\nextended EoR driven by faint galaxies. We also make detectability forecasts.\nWith a 1000h integration, HERA and SKA1-low should achieve a signal-to-noise of\n~few-hundreds throughout the EoR/CD, while in the maximally optimistic scenario\nof perfect foreground cleaning, all instruments should make a statistical\ndetection of the cosmic signal. We also caution that our ability to clean\nforegrounds determines the relative performance of narrow/deep vs. wide/shallow\nsurveys expected with SKA1. Our 21-cm power spectra, simulation outputs and\nvisualizations are publicly available.\n", "  A simple variant of a realistic flavour symmetry scheme for fermion masses\nand mixings provides a possible interpretation of the diphoton anomaly as an\nelectroweak singlet \"flavon\". The existence of TeV scale vector-like T-quarks\nrequired to provide adequate values for CKM parameters can also naturally\naccount for the diphoton anomaly. Correlations between $V_{ub}$ and $V_{cb}$\nwith the vector-like T-quark mass can be predicted. Should the diphoton anomaly\nsurvive in a future Run, our proposed interpretation can also be tested in\nupcoming B and LHC studies.\n", "  Single crystals of the Kitaev spin-liquid candidate $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ have\nbeen studied to determine low-temperature bulk properties, structure and the\nmagnetic ground state. Refinements of x-ray diffraction data show that the low\ntemperature crystal structure is described by space group $C2/m$ with a\nnearly-perfect honeycomb lattice exhibiting less than 0.2 \\% in-plane\ndistortion. The as-grown single crystals exhibit only one sharp magnetic\ntransition at $T_{N}$ = 7~K. The magnetic order below this temperature exhibits\na propagation vector of $k$ = (0, 1, 1/3), which coincides with a 3-layer\nstacking of the $C2/m$ unit cells. Magnetic transitions at higher temperatures\nup to 14~K can be introduced by deformations of the crystal that result in\nregions in the crystal with a 2-layer stacking sequence. The best fit symmetry\nallowed magnetic structure of the as-grown crystals shows that the spins lie in\nthe $ac$-plane, with a zigzag configuration in each honeycomb layer. The three\nlayer repeat out-of-plane structure can be refined as a 120$^o$ spiral order or\na collinear structure with spin direction 35$^o$ away from the $a$-axis. The\ncollinear spin configuration yields a slightly better fit and also is\nphysically preferred. The average ordered moment in either structure is less\nthan 0.45(5) $\\mu_B$ per Ru$^{3+}$ ion.\n", "  Loops undergoing thermal fluctuations are prevalent in nature. Ring-like or\ncross-linked polymers, cyclic macromolecules, and protein-mediated DNA loops\nall belong to this category. Stability of these molecules are generally\ndescribed in terms of free energy, an average quantity, but it may also be\nimpacted by local fluctuating forces acting within these systems. The full\ndistribution of these forces can thus give us insights into mechanochemistry\nbeyond the predictive capability of thermodynamics. In this paper, we study the\nforce exerted by an inextensible semiflexible polymer constrained in a looped\nstate. By using a novel simulation method termed \"phase-space sampling\", we\ngenerate the equilibrium distribution of chain conformations in both position\nand momentum space. We compute the constraint forces between the two ends of\nthe loop in this chain ensemble using Lagrangian mechanics, and show that the\nmean of these forces is equal to the thermodynamic force. By analyzing kinetic\nand potential contributions to the forces, we find that the mean force acts in\nthe direction of increasing extension not because of bending stress, but in\nspite of it. Furthermore, we obtain a distribution of constraint forces as a\nfunction of chain length, extension, and stiffness. Notably, increasing contour\nlength decreases the average force, but the additional freedom allows\nfluctuations in the constraint force to increase. The force distribution is\nasymmetric and falls off less sharply than a Gaussian distribution. Our work\nexemplifies a system where large-amplitude fluctuations occur in a way\nunforeseen by a purely thermodynamic framework, and offers novel computational\ntools useful for efficient, unbiased simulation of a constrained system.\n", "  Understanding urban growth is one with understanding how society evolves to\nsatisfy the needs of its individuals in sharing a common space and adapting to\nthe territory. We propose here a quantitative analysis of the historical\ndevelopment of a large urban area by investigating the spatial distribution and\nthe age of commercial activities in the whole city of Rome. We find that the\nage of activities of various categories presents a very interesting double\nexponential trend, with a transition possibly related to the long-term\neconomical effects determined by the oil crisis of the Seventies. The\ndiversification of commercial categories, studied through various measures of\nentropy, shows, among other interesting features, a saturating behaviour with\nthe density of activities. Moreover, different couples of commercial categories\nexhibit over the years a tendency to attract in space. Our results demonstrate\nthat the spatio-temporal distribution of commercial activities can provide\nimportant insights on the urbanisation processes at work, revealing specific\nand not trivial socio-economical dynamics, as the presence of crisis periods\nand expansion trends, and contributing to the characterisation of the maturity\nof urban areas.\n", "  In this work we provide simple and precise parameterizations of the existing\n$\\pi K$ scattering data from threshold up to 1.6 GeV, which are constrained to\nsatisfy forward dispersion relations as well as three additional threshold sum\nrules. We also provide phenomenological values of the threshold parameters and\nof the resonance poles that appear in elastic scattering.\n", "  Keane et al. have recently claimed to have obtained the first precise\nlocalization for a Fast Radio Burst (FRB) thanks to the identification of a\ncontemporaneous fading slow (~week-timescale) radio transient. They use this\nlocalization to pinpoint the FRB to a galaxy at z ~ 0.49 that exhibits no\ndiscernable star formation activity. We argue that the transient is not genuine\nand that the host candidate, WISE J071634.59-190039.2, is instead a radio\nvariable: the available data did not exclude this possibility; a random radio\nvariable consistent with the observations is not unlikely to have a redshift\ncompatible with the FRB dispersion measure; and the proposed transient light\ncurve is better explained as a scintillating steady source, perhaps also\nshowing an active galactic nucleus (AGN) flare, than a synchrotron-emitting\nblastwave. The radio luminosity of the host candidate implies that it is an AGN\nand we present new late-time Very Large Array observations showing that the\ngalaxy is indeed variable at a level consistent with the claimed transient.\nTherefore the claimed precise localization and redshift determination for FRB\n150418 cannot be justified.\n", "  The viscous inhomogeneities of a relativistic plasma determine a further\nclass of entropic modes whose amplitude must be sufficiently small since\ncurvature perturbations are observed to be predominantly adiabatic and Gaussian\nover large scales. When the viscous coefficients only depend on the energy\ndensity of the fluid the corresponding curvature fluctuations are shown to be\nalmost adiabatic. After addressing the problem in a gauge-invariant\nperturbative expansion, the same analysis is repeated at a non-perturbative\nlevel by investigating the nonlinear curvature inhomogeneities induced by the\nspatial variation of the viscous coefficients. It is demonstrated that the\nquasiadiabatic modes are suppressed in comparison with a bona fide adiabatic\nsolution. Because of its anomalously large tensor to scalar ratio the\nquasiadiabatic mode cannot be a substitute for the conventional adiabatic\nparadigm so that, ultimately, the present findings seems to exclude the\npossibility of a successful accelerated dynamics solely based on relativistic\nviscous fluids. If the dominant adiabatic mode is not affected by the viscosity\nof the background a sufficiently small fraction of entropic fluctuations of\nviscous origin cannot be a priori ruled out.\n", "  In this study, we obtain the size distribution of voids as a 3-parameter\nredshift independent log-normal void probability function (VPF) directly from\nthe Cosmic Void Catalog (CVC). Although many statistical models of void\ndistributions are based on the counts in randomly placed cells, the log-normal\nVPF that we here obtain is independent of the shape of the voids due to the\nparameter-free void finder of the CVC. We use three void populations drawn from\nthe CVC generated by the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) Mocks which are\ntuned to three mock SDSS samples to investigate the void distribution\nstatistically and the effects of the environments on the size distribution. As\na result, it is shown that void size distributions obtained from the HOD Mock\nsamples are satisfied by the 3-parameter log-normal distribution. In addition,\nwe find that there may be a relation between hierarchical formation, skewness\nand kurtosis of the log-normal distribution for each catalog. We also show that\nthe shape of the 3-parameter distribution from the samples is strikingly\nsimilar to the galaxy log-normal mass distribution obtained from numerical\nstudies. This similarity of void size and galaxy mass distributions may\npossibly indicate evidence of nonlinear mechanisms affecting both voids and\ngalaxies, such as large scale accretion and tidal effects. Considering in this\nstudy all voids are generated by galaxy mocks and show hierarchical structures\nin different levels, it may be possible that the same nonlinear mechanisms of\nmass distribution affect the void size distribution.\n", "  The purpose of this work is to provide a fast and accurate scatter artifacts\ncorrection algorithm for cone beam CT (CBCT) imaging. The method starts with an\nestimation of coarse scatter profiles for a set of CBCT data in either image\ndomain or projection domain. A denoising algorithm designed specifically for\nPoisson signals is then applied to derive the final scatter distribution.\nQualitative and quantitative evaluations using thorax and abdomen phantoms with\nMonte Carlo (MC) simulations, experimental Catphan phantom data, and in vivo\nhuman data acquired for a clinical image guided radiation therapy were\nperformed. Results show that the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce\nscatter artifacts and recover the correct HU in either projection domain or\nimage domain. For the MC thorax phantom study, four components segmentation\nyield the best results, while the results of three components segmentation are\nstill acceptable. For the Catphan phantom data, the mean value over all pixels\nin the residual image is reduced from -21.8 HU to -0.2 HU and 0.7 HU for\nprojection domain and image domain, respectively. The contrast of the in vivo\nhuman images are greatly improved after correction. The software-based\ntechnique has a number of advantages, such as high computational efficiency and\naccuracy, and the capability of performing scatter correction without modifying\nthe clinical workflow or modifying the imaging hardware. When implemented\npractically, this should improve the accuracy of CBCT image quantitation and\nsignificantly impact CBCT-based interventional procedures and adaptive\nradiation therapy.\n", "  Recent in vitro experiments with FtsZ polymers show self-organization into\ndifferent dynamic patterns, including structures reminiscent of the bacterial\nZ-ring. We model FtsZ polymers as active particles moving along chiral,\ncircular paths by Brownian dynamics simulations and a Boltzmann approach. Our\ntwo conceptually different methods point to a generic phase behavior. At\nintermediate particle densities, we find self-organization into vortex\nstructures including closed rings. Moreover, we show that the dynamics at the\nonset of pattern formation is described by a generalized complex\nGinzburg-Landau equation.\n", "  We present a consistent theoretical approach for calculating effective\nnonlinear susceptibilities of metamaterials taking into account both frequency\nand spatial dispersion. Employing the discrete dipole model, we demonstrate\nthat effects of spatial dispersion become especially pronounced in the vicinity\nof effective permittivity resonance where nonlinear susceptibilities reach\ntheir maxima. In that case spatial dispersion may enable simultaneous\ngeneration of two harmonic signals with the same frequency and polarization but\ndifferent wave vectors. We also prove that the derived expressions for\nnonlinear susceptibilities transform into the known form when spatial\ndispersion effects are negligible. In addition to revealing new physical\nphenomena, our results provide useful theoretical tools for analysing resonant\nnonlinear metamaterials.\n", "  We investigate photon merging and splitting processes in inhomogeneous,\nslowly varying electromagnetic fields. Our study is based on the three-photon\npolarization tensor following from the Heisenberg-Euler effective action. We\nput special emphasis on deviations from the well-known constant field results,\nalso revisiting the selection rules for these processes. In the context of\nhigh-intensity laser facilities, we analytically determine compact expressions\nfor the number of merged/split photons as obtained in the focal spots of\nintense laser beams. For the parameter range of a typical petawatt class laser\nsystem as pump and a terawatt class laser as probe, we provide estimates for\nthe numbers of signal photons attainable in an actual experiment. The\ncombination of frequency upshifting, polarization dependence and scattering off\nthe inhomogeneities renders photon merging an ideal signature for the\nexperimental exploration of nonlinear quantum vacuum properties.\n", "  Using a mixed-ligand synthetic scheme, we create a family of\nquasi-two-dimensional antiferromagnets, namely, [Cu(HF$_2$)(pyz)$_2$]ClO$_4$\n[pyz = pyrazine], [Cu$L_2$(pyz)$_2$](ClO$_4$)$_2$ [$L$ = pyO = pyridine-N-oxide\nand 4-phpyO = 4-phenylpyridine-N-oxide. These materials are shown to possess\nequivalent two-dimensional [Cu(pyz)$_2$]$^{2+}$ nearly square layers, but\nexhibit interlayer spacings that vary from 6.5713~\\AA ~to 16.777~\\AA, as\ndictated by the axial ligands. We present the structural and magnetic\nproperties of this family as determined via x-ray diffraction, electron-spin\nresonance, pulsed- and quasistatic-field magnetometry and muon-spin rotation,\nand compare them to those of the prototypical two-dimensional magnetic polymer\nCu(pyz)$_2$(ClO$_4$)$_2$. We find that, within the limits of the experimental\nerror, the two-dimensional, {\\it intralayer} exchange coupling in our family of\nmaterials remains largely unaffected by the axial ligand substitution, while\nthe observed magnetic ordering temperature decreases slowly with increasing\nlayer separation. Despite the structural motifs common to this family and\nCu(pyz)$_2$(ClO$_4$)$_2$, the latter has significantly stronger two-dimensional\nexchange interactions and hence a higher ordering temperature. We discuss these\nresults, as well as the mechanisms that might drive the long-range order in\nthese materials, in terms of departures from the ideal $S=1/2$ two-dimensional\nsquare-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet. In particular, we find that both\nspin exchange anisotropy in the intralayer interaction and interlayer couplings\n(exchange, dipolar, or both) are needed to account for the observed ordering\ntemperatures, with the intralayer anisotropy becoming more important as the\nlayers are pulled further apart.\n", "  Recent observations have revealed the existence of an abundant population of\nfaint, low surface brightness (SB) galaxies, which appear to be numerous and\nubiquitous in nearby galaxy clusters, including the Virgo, Coma and Fornax\nclusters. With median stellar masses of dwarf galaxies, these ultra-diffuse\ngalaxies (UDGs) have unexpectedly large sizes, corresponding to a mean SB of\n$24\\lesssim\\langle\\mu_e\\rangle_r\\ {\\rm mag}^{-1} {\\rm arcsec}^2\\lesssim27$\nwithin the effective radius. We show that the UDG population represents the\ntail of galaxies formed in dwarf-sized haloes with higher-than-average angular\nmomentum. By adopting the standard model of disk formation -- in which the size\nof galaxies is set by the spin of the halo -- we recover both the abundance of\nUDGs as a function of the host cluster mass and the distribution of sizes\nwithin the UDG population. According to this model, UDGs are not failed $L_*$\ngalaxies, but genuine dwarfs, and their low SB is not uniquely connected to the\nharsh cluster environment. We therefore expect a correspondingly abundant\npopulation of UDGs in the field, with likely different morphologies and\ncolours.\n", "  A global evolution picture of protoplanetary disks (PPDs) is key to\nunderstanding almost every aspect of planet formation, where standard\nalpha-disk models have been constantly employed for its simplicity. In the mean\ntime, disk mass loss has been conventionally attributed to photoevaporation,\nwhich controls disk dispersal. However, a paradigm shift towards accretion\ndriven by magnetized disk winds has been realized in the recent years, thanks\nto studies of non-ideal magneto-hydrodynamic effects in PPDs. I present a\nframework of global PPD evolution aiming to incorporate these advances,\nhighlighting the role of wind-driven accretion and wind mass loss. Disk\nevolution is found to be largely dominated by wind-driven processes, and\nviscous spreading is suppressed. The timescale of disk evolution is controlled\nprimarily by the amount of external magnetic flux threading the disks, and how\nrapidly the disk loses the flux. Rapid disk dispersal can be achieved if the\ndisk is able to hold most of its magnetic flux during the evolution. In\naddition, because wind launching requires sufficient level of ionization at\ndisk surface (mainly via external far-UV radiation), wind kinematics is also\naffected by far-UV penetration depth and disk geometry. For typical disk\nlifetime of a few Myrs, the disk loses approximately the same amount of mass\nthrough the wind as through accretion onto the protostar, and most of the wind\nmass loss proceeds from the outer disk via a slow wind. Fractional wind mass\nloss increases with increasing disk lifetime. Significant wind mass loss likely\nsubstantially enhances the dust to gas mass ratio, and promotes planet\nformation.\n", "  We study the strong decay channels $P_c^+(4380) \\to J/\\psi p$ and\n$P_c^+(4450) \\to J/\\psi p$ under $\\Sigma_c \\bar{D}^*$ molecular state ansatz.\nWith various spin-parity assignments, the partial decay widths of $J/\\psi p$\nfinal state are calculated. Our results show that all the $P$ wave $\\Sigma_c\n{\\bar D}^*$ assignments are excluded, while $S$ wave $\\Sigma_c {\\bar D}^*$\npictures for $P_c(4380)$ and $P_c(4450)$ are both allowed by present\nexperimental data. The $J^P=3/2^-$ $\\Sigma_c^* \\bar{D}$ and $\\Sigma_c^*\n\\bar{D}^*$ molecules are also discussed in the heavy quark limit, and find that\nthe $\\Sigma_c^* \\bar{D}$ system for $P_c(4380)$ is possible. More experimental\ninformation on spin-parities and partial decay widths and theoretical\ninvestigations on other decay modes are needed to clarify the nature of the two\n$P_c$ states.\n", "  Near-forward Raman scattering combined with ab initio phonon and bond length\ncalculations is used to study the phonon-polariton transverse optical modes\n(with mixed electrical and mechanical character) of the II-VI ZnSeS mixed\ncrystal under pressure. The goal of the study is to determine the pressure\ndependence of the poorly resolved percolation-type Zn-S Raman doublet of the\nthree oscillator [1(Zn-Se),2(Zn-S)] ZnSe68S32 mixed crystal, which exhibits a\nphase transition at approximately the same pressure as its two end compounds\n(~14 GPa, zincblende-to-rocksalt), as determined by high-pressure x-ray\ndiffraction. We find that the intensity of the lower Zn-S sub-mode of\nZnSe68S32, due to Zn-S bonds vibrating in their own (S-like) environment,\ndecreases under pressure (Raman scattering), whereas its frequency\nprogressively converges onto that of the upper Zn- S sub-mode, due to Zn-S\nvibrations in the foreign (Se-like) environment (ab initio calculations).\nUltimately, only the latter sub-mode survives. A similar phonon freezing was\nearlier evidenced with the well-resolved percolation-type Be-Se doublet of\nZnBeSe [Pradhan et al. Phys. Rev. B 81, 115207 (2010)], that exhibits a large\ncontrast in the pressure-induced structural transitions of its end compounds.\nWe deduce that the above collapse and convergence process is intrinsic to the\npercolation doublet of a short bond under pressure, at least in a ZnSe-based\nmixed crystal, and not due to any pressure-induced structural transition.\n", "  The continuous photometric observations collected by the Kepler satellite\nover 4 years provide a whelm of data with an unequalled quantity and quality\nfor the study of stellar evolution of more than 200000 stars. Moreover, the\nlength of the dataset provide a unique source of information to detect magnetic\nactivity and associated temporal variability in the acoustic oscillations. In\nthis regards, the Kepler mission was awaited with great expectation. The search\nfor the signature of magnetic activity variability in solar-like pulsations\nstill remained unfruitful more than 2 years after the end of the nominal\nmission. Here, however, we report the discovery of temporal variability in the\nlow-degree acoustic frequencies of the young (1 Gyr-old) solar analog KIC\n10644253 with a modulation of about 1.5 years with significant temporal\nvariations along the duration of the Kepler observations. The variations are in\nagreement with the derived photometric activity. The frequency shifts extracted\nfor KIC 10644253 are shown to result from the same physical mechanisms involved\nin the inner sub-surface layers as in the Sun. In parallel, a detailed\nspectroscopic analysis of KIC 10644253 is performed based on complementary\nground-based, high-resolution observations collected by the HERMES instrument\nmounted on the MERCATOR telescope. Its lithium abundance and chromospheric\nactivity S-index confirm that KIC 10644253 is a young and more active star than\nthe Sun.\n", "  Many recent observations and numerical simulations suggest that nearby\nmassive, early-type galaxies were formed through a \"two-phase\" process. In the\nproposed second phase, the extended stellar envelope was accumulated through\nmany dry mergers. However, details of the past merger history of present-day\nellipticals, such as the typical merger mass ratio, are difficult to constrain\nobservationally. Within the context and assumptions of the two-phase formation\nscenario, we propose a straightforward method, using photometric data alone, to\nestimate the average mass ratio of mergers that contributed to the build-up of\nmassive elliptical galaxies. We study a sample of nearby massive elliptical\ngalaxies selected from the Carnegie-Irvine Galaxy Survey, using two-dimensional\nanalysis to decompose their light distribution into an inner, denser component\nplus an extended, outer envelope, each having a different optical color. The\ncombination of these two substructures accurately recovers the negative color\ngradient exhibited by the galaxy as whole. The color difference between the two\ncomponents (<\\Delta(B-V)> ~ 0.10 mag; <\\Delta(B-R)> ~ 0.14 mag), based on the\nslope of the M_stellar-color relation for nearby early-type galaxies, can be\ntranslated into an estimate of the average mass ratio of the mergers. The rough\nestimate, 1:5 to 1:10, is consistent with the expectation of the two-phase\nformation scenario, suggesting that minor mergers were largely responsible for\nbuilding up to the outer stellar envelope of present-day massive ellipticals.\nWith the help of accurate photometry, large sample size, and more choices of\ncolors promised by ongoing and future surveys, the approach proposed here can\nreveal more insights into the growth of massive galaxies during the last few\nGyr.\n", "  Several supernovae (SNe) with an unusually dense circumstellar medium (CSM)\nhave been recently observed at radio frequencies. Their radio emission is\npowered by relativistic electrons that can be either accelerated at the SN\nshock (primaries) or injected as a by-product (secondaries) of inelastic\nproton-proton collisions. We investigate the radio signatures from secondary\nelectrons, by detailing a semi-analytical model to calculate the temporal\nevolution of the distributions of protons, primary and secondary electrons.\nWith our formalism, we track the cooling history of all the particles that have\nbeen injected into the emission region up to a given time, and calculate the\nresulting radio spectra and light curves. For a SN shock propagating through\nthe progenitor wind, we find that secondary electrons control the early radio\nsignatures, but their contribution decays faster than that of primary\nelectrons. This results in a flattening of the light curve at a given radio\nfrequency that depends only upon the radial profiles of the CSM density and of\nthe shock velocity, $v_0$. The relevant transition time at the peak frequency\nis $\\sim 190 \\, K_{\\rm ep,-3}^{-1} A_{\\rm w, 16} \\beta_{0, -1.5}^{-2}\\,{\\rm\nd}$, where $A_{\\rm w}$ is the wind mass-loading parameter, $\\beta_0=v_0/c$ and\n$K_{\\rm ep}$ is the electron-to-proton ratio of accelerated particles. We\nexplicitly show that late peak times at 5 GHz (i.e., $t_{\\rm pk} \\gtrsim\n300-1000$ d) suggest a shock wave propagating in a dense wind ($A_{\\rm w}\n\\gtrsim 10^{16}-10^{17}$ gr cm$^{-1}$), where secondary electrons are likely to\npower the observed peak emission.\n", "  We apply a combination of a Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Support Vector\nMachines (SVM) machine learning algorithm to solve two important problems faced\nby the astronomical community: star/galaxy separation, and photometric redshift\nestimation of galaxies in survey catalogs. We use the GA to select the relevant\nfeatures in the first step, followed by optimization of SVM parameters in the\nsecond step to obtain an optimal set of parameters to classify or regress, in\nprocess of which we avoid over-fitting. We apply our method to star/galaxy\nseparation in Pan-STARRS1 data. We show that our method correctly classifies\n98% of objects down to i_P1= 24.5, with a completeness (or true positive rate)\nof 99% for galaxies, and 88% for stars. By combining colors with morphology,\nour star/classification method yields better results than the new SExtractor\nclassifier spread_model in particular at the faint end (i_P1>22). We also use\nour method to derive photometric redshifts for galaxies in the COSMOS bright\nmulti-wavelength dataset down to an error in (1+z) of sigma=0.013, which\ncompares well with estimates from SED fitting on the same data (sigma=0.007)\nwhile making a significantly smaller number of assumptions.\n", "  The Grand Tack model of terrestrial planet formation has emerged in recent\nyears as the premier scenario used to account for several observed features of\nthe inner solar system. It relies on early migration of the giant planets to\ngravitationally sculpt and mix the planetesimal disc down to ~1 AU, after which\nthe terrestrial planets accrete from material left in a narrow circum-solar\nannulus. Here we have investigated how the model fares under a range of initial\nconditions and migration course-change (`tack') locations. We have run a large\nnumber of N-body simulations with a tack location of 1.5 AU and 2 AU and tested\ninitial conditions using equal mass planetary embryos and a semi-analytical\napproach to oligarchic growth. We make use of a recent model of the protosolar\ndisc that takes account of viscous heating, include the full effect of type 1\nmigration, and employ a realistic mass-radius relation for the growing\nterrestrial planets. Results show that the canonical tack location of Jupiter\nat 1.5 AU is inconsistent with the most massive planet residing at 1 AU at\ngreater than 95% confidence. This favours a tack farther out at 2 AU for the\ndisc model and parameters employed. Of the different initial conditions, we\nfind that the oligarchic case is capable of statistically reproducing the\norbital architecture and mass distribution of the terrestrial planets, while\nthe equal mass embryo case is not.\n", "  The supermassive black hole Sgr A* is located at the Milky Way center. We\nstudied its flaring activity close to the DSO/G2 pericenter passage to\nconstrain the physical properties and origin of the flares.\nSimultaneous/coordinated observations were made in 2014 Feb-Apr with\nXMM-Newton, HST/WFC3, VLT/SINFONI, VLA and CARMA. We detected 2 X-ray and 3 NIR\nflares on Mar. 10 and Apr. 2 with XMM-Newton and HST and 2 NIR flares on Apr. 3\nand 4 with VLT. The Mar. 10 X-ray flare has a long rise and a rapid decay. Its\nNIR counterpart peaked 4320s before the X-ray peak implying a variation in the\nX-ray-to-NIR flux ratio. This flare may be a single flare where change in the\nflux ratio is explained by the adiabatic compression of a plasmon or 2 close\nflares with simultaneous X-ray/NIR peaks. We observed an increase in the rising\nradio flux density on Mar. 10 with the VLA. It could be the delayed emission\nfrom a NIR/X-ray flare preceding our observation. The Apr. 2 X-ray flare\noccurred for HST in the Earth occultation of Sgr A*. We thus only observed the\nstart of its NIR counterpart. After the occultation, we observed the decay\nphase of a bright NIR flare with no X-ray counterpart. On Apr. 3, 2 CARMA\nflares were observed. The 1rst one may be the delayed emission of a VLT NIR\nflare. We thus observed 7 NIR flares whose 3 have an X-ray counterpart. We\nstudied the physical parameters of the flaring region for each NIR flare but\nnone of the possible radiative processes can be ruled out for the X-ray flares\ncreation. Our X-ray flaring rate is consistent with those observed in the 2012\nChandra XVP campaign. No increase in the flaring activity was thus triggered\nclose to the DSO/G2 pericenter passage. Moreover, higher X-ray flaring rates\nhad already been observed with no increase in the quiescent level. There is\nthus no direct link between an X-ray flaring-rate increase and an\naccretion-rate change. (abridged)\n", "  Mergers of carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarfs (WDs) are considered as one of the\npotential progenitors of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Recent hydrodynamical\nsimulations showed that the less massive (secondary) WD violently accretes onto\nthe more massive (primary) one, carbon detonation occurs, the detonation wave\npropagates through the primary, and the primary finally explodes as a\nsub-Chandrasekhar mass SN Ia. Such an explosion mechanism is called the violent\nmerger scenario. Based on the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations\nof merging CO WDs, we derived more stringent critical mass ratio (qcr) leading\nto the violent merger scenario than the previous results. We conclude that this\ndifference mainly comes from the differences in the initial condition,\nsynchronously spinning of WDs or not. Using our new results, we estimated the\nbrightness distribution of SNe Ia in the violent merger scenario and compared\nit with previous studies. We found that our new qcr does not significantly\naffect the brightness distribution. We present the direct outcome immediately\nfollowing CO WD mergers for various primary masses and mass ratios. We also\ndiscussed the final fate of the central system of the bipolar planetary nebula\nHenize 2-428, which was recently suggested to be a double CO WD system whose\ntotal mass exceeds the Chandrasekhar-limiting mass, merging within the Hubble\ntime. Even considering the uncertainties in the proposed binary parameters, we\nconcluded that the final fate of this system is almost certainly a\nsub-Chandrasekhar mass SN Ia in the violent merger scenario.\n", "  Semiconductor-based quantum dot single-electron pumps are currently the most\npromising candidates for the direct realization of the emerging quantum\nstandard of the ampere in the International System of Units. Here, we discuss a\nsilicon quantum dot single-electron pump with radio frequency control over the\ntransparencies of entrance and exit barriers as well as the dot potential. We\nshow that our driving protocol leads to robust bidirectional pumping: one can\nconveniently reverse the direction of the quantized current by changing only\nthe phase shift of one driving waveform with respect to the others. We also\nstudy the improvement in the robustness of the current quantization owing to\nthe introduction of three control voltages in comparison with the two-waveform\ndriving. We anticipate that this pumping technique may be used in the future to\nperform error counting experiments by pumping the electrons into and out of a\nreservoir island monitored by a charge sensor.\n", "  The charged lepton flavor violating (CLFV) processes of $\\mu^-e^-\\rightarrow\ne^-e^-$ decay by four Fermi contact interactions in a muonic atom for various\natoms are investigated. The wave functions of bound and scattering state\nleptons are properly treated by solving Dirac equations with Coulomb\ninteraction of the finite nuclear charge distributions. This new effect\ncontributes significantly in particular for heavier atoms, where the obtained\ndecay rate is about one order of magnitude larger than the previous estimation\nfor $^{208}$Pb. We find that, as the atomic number $Z$ increases, the\n$\\mu^-e^-\\rightarrow e^-e^-$ decay rates increase more rapidly than the result\nof the previous work of $Z^3$, suggesting this decay as one of the promising\nprocesses to search for CLFV interaction.\n", "  In this work we have used a Ho\\v{r}ava-Lifshitz scaling to rewrite a\nLorentz-violating higher-order derivative electrodynamics controlled by a\nbackground four-vector $n_{\\mu}$. The photon propagator was obtained and we\nhave analyzed the dispersion relation and the observational results of\ngamma-ray burst (GRB) experiments were used. The limits of the critical\nexponent were discussed in the light of the GRB data and the physical\nimplications were compared with the current GRB-Lorentz-invariance-violation\nliterature. We show that the bound for the Lorentz-violating coupling for\ndimension-six operators, obtained from a Ho\\v{r}ava-Lifshitz scaling, is eight\norders of magnitude better than the result found without considering a\nHo\\v{r}ava-Lifshitz scaling, also this bound is nearby one, which is expected\nto be relevant phenomenologically.\n", "  We present an analysis of four epochs of H$\\alpha$ and [S II]\n$\\lambda\\lambda$ 6716/6731 HST images of HH 1. For determining proper motions\nwe explore a new method based on analysis of spatially degraded images obtained\nconvolving the images with wavelet functions of chosen widths. With this\nprocedure we are able to generate maps of proper motion velocities along and\nacross the outflow axis, as well as (angularly integrated) proper motion\nvelocity distributions. From the four available epochs, we find the time\nevolution of the velocities, intensities and spatial distribution of the line\nemission. We find that over the last two decades HH 1 shows a clear\nacceleration. Also, the H$\\alpha$ and [S II] intensities have first dropped,\nand then recovered in the more recent (2014) images. Finally, we show a\ncomparison between the two available HST epochs of [O III] $\\lambda$ 5007 (1994\nand 2014), in which we see a clear drop in the value of the [O III]/H$\\alpha$\nratio.\n", "  Trions and biexcitons in anisotropic two-dimensional materials are\ninvestigated within an effective mass theory. Explicit results are obtained for\nphosphorene and arsenene, materials that share features such as a direct\nquasi-particle gap and anisotropic conduction and valence bands. Trions are\npredicted to have remarkably high binding energies and an elongated\nelectron-hole structure with a preference for alignment along the armchair\ndirection, where the effective masses are lower. We find that biexciton binding\nenergies are also notably large, especially for monolayer phosphorene, where\nthey are found to be twice as large as those for typical monolayer transition\nmetal dichalcogenides.\n", "  We present VLT/X-Shooter and MUSE spectroscopy of an faint F814W=28.60+/-0.33\n(Muv=-17.0), low mass (~<10^7 Msun) and compact (Reff=62pc) freshly\nstar-forming galaxy at z=3.1169 magnified (16x) by the Hubble Frontier Fields\ngalaxy cluster Abell S1063. Gravitational lensing allows for a significant jump\ntoward low-luminosity regimes, in moderately high resolution spectroscopy\n(R=lambda/dlambda ~ 3000-7400). We measured CIV1548,1550, HeII1640,\nOIII]1661,1666, CIII]1907,1909, Hbeta, [OIII]4959,5007, emission lines with\nFWHM< 50 km/s and (de-lensed) fluxes spanning the interval 1.0x10^-19 -\n2.0x10^-18 erg/s/cm2 at S/N=4-30. The double peaked Lya emission with\nDelta_v(red-blue) = 280(+/-7)km/s and de-lensed fluxes\n2.4_(blue)|8.5_(red)x10^-18 erg/s/cm2 (S/N=38_(blue)|110_(red)) indicate a low\ncolumn density of neutral hydrogen gas consistent with a highly ionized\ninterstellar medium as also inferred from the large [OIII]5007/[OII]3727>10\nratio. We detect CIV1548,1550 resonant doublet in emission, each component with\nFWHM ~< 45 km/s, and redshifted by +51(+/-10)km/s relative to the systemic\nredshift. We interpret this as nebular emission tracing an expanding\noptically-thin interstellar medium. Both CIV1548,1550 and HeII1640 suggest the\npresence of hot and massive stars (with a possible faint AGN). The ultraviolet\nslope is remarkably blue, beta =-2.95 +/- 0.20 (F_lambda=lambda^beta),\nconsistent with a dust-free and young ~<20 Myr galaxy. Line ratios suggest an\noxygen abundance 12+log(O/H)<7.8. We are witnessing an early episode of\nstar-formation in which a relatively low NHI and negligible dust attenuation\nmight favor a leakage of ionizing radiation. This galaxy currently represents a\nunique low-luminosity reference object for future studies of the reionization\nepoch with JWST.\n", "  Kink magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves are frequently observed in various\nmagnetic structures of the solar atmosphere. They may contribute significantly\nto coronal heating and could be used as a tool to diagnose the solar plasma. In\nthis study, we synthesise the \\ion{Fe}{9} $\\lambda171.073$ emission of a\ncoronal loop supporting a standing kink MHD mode. The kink MHD wave solution of\na plasma cylinder is mapped into a semi-torus structure to simulate a curved\ncoronal loop. We decompose the solution into a quasi-rigid kink motion and a\nquadrupole term, which dominate the plasma inside and outside the flux tube,\nrespectively. At the loop edges, the line-of-sight integrates relatively more\nambient plasma, and the background emission becomes significant. The plasma\nmotion associated with the quadrupole term causes spectral line broadening and\nemission suppression. The periodic intensity suppression will modulate the\nintegrated intensity and the effective loop width, which both exhibit\noscillatory variations at half of the kink period. The quadrupole term can be\ndirectly observed as a pendular motion at front view.\n", "  In the last decade, the photospheric abundances of the Sun had been revised\nseveral times by many observers. The standard solar models (SSM) constructed\nwith the new low-metal abundances disagree with helioseismic results and\ndetected neutrino fluxes. The solar model problem has been puzzled some stellar\nphysicists for more than ten years. Rotation, enhanced diffusion, convection\novershoot, and magnetic fields are used to reconcile the new abundances with\nhelioseismology. The \\textbf{too} low-helium \\textbf{subsurface abundance} in\nenhanced diffusion models can be improved by the mixing caused by rotation and\nmagnetic fields. The problem of the depth of the convective zone in rotating\nmodels can be resolved by convection overshoot. Consequently the\nAsplund-Grevesse-Sauval rotation model including overshooting (AGSR) reproduces\nthe seismically inferred sound-speed and density profiles, and the convection\nzone depth as well as the Grevesse and Sauval (GS98) model computed before. But\nthis model fails to reproduce the surface helium abundance which is 0.2393\n($2.6$ $\\sigma$ away from the seismic value) and neutrino fluxes. The magnetic\nmodel called AGSM keeps the agreement of the AGSR and improves the prediction\nof the surface helium abundance. The observed separation ratios $r_{02}$ and\n$r_{13}$ are reasonably reproduced by AGSM. Moreover, neutrino fluxes\ncalculated by this model are not far from the detected neutrino fluxes and the\npredictions of previous works.\n", "  Detailed studies of galaxy formation require clear definitions of the\nstructural components of galaxies. Precisely defined components also enable\nbetter comparisons between observations and simulations. We use a subsample of\neighteen cosmological zoom-in simulations from the NIHAO project to derive a\nrobust method for defining stellar kinematic discs in galaxies. Our method uses\nGaussian Mixture Models in a 3D space of dynamical variables. The NIHAO\ngalaxies have the right stellar mass for their halo mass, and their angular\nmomenta and S\\'ersic indices match observations. While the photometric\ndisc-to-total ratios are close to 1 for all the simulated galaxies, the\nkinematic ratios are around ~0.5. Thus, exponential structure does not imply a\ncold kinematic disc. Above log(M*)~9.5, the decomposition leads to thin discs\nand spheroids that have clearly different properties, in terms of angular\nmomentum, rotational support, ellipticity, [Fe/H] and [O/Fe]. At log(M*)<9.5,\nthe decomposition selects discs and spheroids with less distinct properties. At\nthese low masses, both the discs and spheroids have exponential profiles with\nhigh minor-to-major axes ratios, i.e. thickened discs.\n", "  Many accreting black holes manifest time lags during outbursts, in which the\nhard Fourier component typically lags behind the soft component. Despite\ndecades of observations of this phenomenon, the underlying physical explanation\nfor the time lags has remained elusive, although there are suggestions that\nCompton reverberation plays an important role. However, the lack of analytical\nsolutions has hindered the interpretation of the available data. In this paper,\nwe investigate the generation of X-ray time lags in Compton scattering coronae\nusing a new mathematical approach based on analysis of the Fourier-transformed\ntransport equation. By solving this equation, we obtain the Fourier transform\nof the radiation Green's function, which allows us to calculate the exact\ndependence of the time lags on the Fourier frequency, for both homogeneous and\ninhomogeneous coronal clouds. We use the new formalism to explore a variety of\ninjection scenarios, including both monochromatic and broadband\n(bremsstrahlung) seed photon injection. We show that our model can successfully\nreproduce both the observed time lags and the time-averaged (quiescent) X-ray\nspectra for Cyg~X-1 and GX~339-04, using a single set of coronal parameters for\neach source. The time lags are the result of impulsive bremsstrahlung injection\noccurring near the outer edge of the corona, while the time-averaged spectra\nare the result of continual distributed injection of soft photons throughout\nthe cloud.\n", "  With the velocity vector and temperature of the pristine interstellar neutral\n(ISN) He recently obtained with high precision from a coordinated analysis\nsummarized by McComas et al.2015b, we analyzed the IBEX observations of neutral\nHe left out from this analysis. These observations were collected during the\nISN observation seasons 2010---2014 and cover the region in the Earth's orbit\nwhere the Warm Breeze persists. We used the same simulation model and a very\nsimilar parameter fitting method to that used for the analysis of ISN He. We\napproximated the parent population of the Warm Breeze in front of the\nheliosphere with a homogeneous Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution function and\nfound a temperature of $\\sim 9\\,500$ K, an inflow speed of 11.3 km s$^{-1}$,\nand an inflow longitude and latitude in the J2000 ecliptic coordinates\n$251.6^\\circ$, $12.0^\\circ$. The abundance of the Warm Breeze relative to the\ninterstellar neutral He is 5.7\\% and the Mach number is 1.97. The newly found\ninflow direction of the Warm Breeze, the inflow directions of ISN H and ISN He,\nand the direction to the center of IBEX Ribbon are almost perfectly co-planar,\nand this plane coincides within relatively narrow statistical uncertainties\nwith the plane fitted only to the inflow directions of ISN He, ISN H, and the\nWarm Breeze. This co-planarity lends support to the hypothesis that the Warm\nBreeze is the secondary population of ISN He and that the center of the Ribbon\ncoincides with the direction of the local interstellar magnetic field. The\ncommon plane for the direction of inflow of ISN gas, ISN H, the Warm Breeze,\nand the local interstellar magnetic field %includes the Sun and is given by the\nnormal direction: ecliptic longitude $349.7^\\circ \\pm 0.6^\\circ$ and latitude\n$35.7^\\circ \\pm 0.6^\\circ$ in the J2000 coordinates, with the correlation\ncoefficient of 0.85.\n", "  The idea of single exomoon detection due to the radio emissions caused by its\ninteraction with the host exoplanet is extended to multiple-exomoon systems.\nThe characteristic radio emissions are made possible in part by plasma from the\nexomoons own ionosphere (Noyola et. al. 2014). In this work, it is demonstrated\nthat neighboring exomoons and the exoplanetary magnetosphere could also provide\nenough plasma to generate a detectable signal. In particular, the\nplasma-torus-sharing phenomenon is found to be particularly well suited to\nfacilitate the radio detection of plasma-deficient exomoons. The efficiency of\nthis process is evaluated, and the predicted power and frequency of the\nresulting radio signals are presented.\n", "  The S\\'ersic $R^{1/n}$ model is the best approximation known to date for\ndescribing the light distribution of stellar spheroidal and disk components,\nwith the S\\'ersic index $n$ providing a direct measure of the central radial\nconcentration of stars. The S\\'ersic index of a galaxy's spheroidal component,\n$n_{sph}$, has been shown to tightly correlate with the mass of the central\nsupermassive black hole, $M_{BH}$. The $M_{BH}-n_{sph}$ correlation is also\nexpected from other two well known scaling relations involving the spheroid\nluminosity, $L_{sph}$: the $L_{sph}-n_{sph}$ and the $M_{BH}-L_{sph}$.\nObtaining an accurate estimate of the spheroid S\\'ersic index requires a\ncareful modelling of a galaxy's light distribution and some studies have failed\nto recover a statistically significant $M_{BH}-n_{sph}$ correlation. With the\naim of re-investigating the $M_{BH}-n_{sph}$ and other black hole mass scaling\nrelations, we performed a detailed (i.e.~bulge, disks, bars, spiral arms,\nrings, halo, nucleus, etc.) decomposition of 66 galaxies, with directly\nmeasured black hole masses, that had been imaged at $3.6\\rm~\\mu m$ with\nSpitzer. In this paper, the third of this series, we present an analysis of the\n$L_{sph}-n_{sph}$ and $M_{BH}-n_{sph}$ diagrams. While early-type\n(elliptical+lenticular) and late-type (spiral) galaxies split into two separate\nrelations in the $L_{sph}-n_{sph}$ and $M_{BH}-L_{sph}$ diagrams, they reunite\ninto a single $M_{BH} \\propto n_{sph}^{3.39 \\pm 0.15}$ sequence with relatively\nsmall intrinsic scatter ($\\epsilon \\simeq 0.25 \\rm~dex$). The black hole mass\nappears to be closely related to the spheroid central concentration of stars,\nwhich mirrors the inner gradient of the spheroid gravitational potential.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the electron Landau-level stability and its\ninfluence on the electron Fermi energy, $E_{\\rm F}(e)$, in the circumstance of\nmagnetars, which are powered by magnetic field energy. In a magnetar, the\nLandau levels of degenerate and relativistic electrons are strongly quantized.\nA new quantity $g_{n}$, the electron Landau-level stability coefficient is\nintroduced. According to the requirement that $g_{n}$ decreases with increasing\nthe magnetic field intensity $B$, the magnetic-field index $\\beta$ in the\nexpression of $E_{\\rm F}(e)$ must be positive. By introducing the\nDirac$-\\delta$ function, we deduce a general formulae for the Fermi energy of\ndegenerate and relativistic electrons, and obtain a particular solution to\n$E_{\\rm F}(e)$ in a superhigh magnetic field (SMF). This solution has a low\nmagnetic-field index of $\\beta=1/6$, compared with the previous one, and works\nwhen $\\rho\\geq 10^{7}$~g cm$^{-3}$ and $B_{\\rm cr}\\ll B\\leq 10^{17}$~Gauss. By\nmodifying the phase space of relativistic electrons, a SMF can enhance the\nelectron number density $n_e$, and decrease the maximum of electron Landau\nlevel number, which results in a redistribution of electrons. According to\nPauli exclusion principle, the degenerate electrons will fill quantum states\nfrom the lowest Landau level to the highest Landau level. As $B$ increases,\nmore and more electrons will occupy higher Landau levels, though $g_{n}$\ndecreases with the Landau level number $n$. The enhanced $n_{e}$ in a SMF means\nan increase in the electron Fermi energy and an increase in the electron\ndegeneracy pressure. The results are expected to facilitate the study of the\nweak-interaction processes inside neutron stars and the magnetic-thermal\nevolution mechanism for megnetars.\n", "  In this paper we continue our program to construct a model for high energy\nsoft interactions, based on the CGC/saturation approach. We demonstrate that in\nour model which describes diffractive physics as well as multi-particle\nproduction at high energy, the density variation mechanism leads to the value\nof $v_2$ which is about $60\\% \\div 70\\%$ of the measured $v_2$. Bearing in mind\nthat in CGC/saturation approach there are two other mechanisms present: Bose\nenhancement in the wave function and local anisotropy, we believe that the\nazimuthal long range rapidity correlations in proton-proton collisions stem\nfrom the CGC/saturation physics, and not from quark-gluon plasma production.\n", "  The theory of deconfined quantum critical points describes phase transitions\nat temperature T = 0 outside the standard paradigm, predicting continuous\ntransformations between certain ordered states where conventional theory\nrequires discontinuities. Numerous computer simulations have offered no proof\nof such transitions, however, instead finding deviations from expected scaling\nrelations that were neither predicted by the DQC theory nor conform to standard\nscenarios. Here we show that this enigma can be resolved by introducing a\ncritical scaling form with two divergent length scales. Simulations of a\nquantum magnet with antiferromagnetic and dimerized ground states confirm the\nform, proving a continuous transition with deconfined excitations and also\nexplaining anomalous scaling at T > 0. Our findings revise prevailing paradigms\nfor quantum criticality, with potentially far-reaching implications for many\nstrongly-correlated materials.\n", "  (Abridged for arXiv) The history of the mass assembly of brightest cluster\ngalaxies may be studied by the mapping the stellar populations at large radial\ndistances from the galaxy centre. We provide extended and robust measurements\nof the stellar population parameters in NGC 3311, the cD galaxy at the centre\nof the Hydra I cluster and out to three effective radii. Using seven\nabsorption-features defined in the Lick/IDS system and single stellar\npopulations models, we obtained luminosity-weighted ages, metallicities and\nalpha element abundances. The trends in the Lick indices and the distribution\nof the stellar population parameters indicate that the stars of NGC 3311 may be\ndivided into two radial regimes, one within and the another beyond one\neffective radius, $R_e = 8.4$ kpc, similar to the distinction between inner\ngalaxy and external halo derived from the NGC 3311 velocity dispersion profile.\nThe inner galaxy ($R\\leq R_e$) is old (age $\\sim 14$ Gyr), have negative\nmetallicity gradients and positive alpha element gradients. The external halo\nis also very old, but the metal and element abundances of the external halo\nhave both a large scatter, indicating that stars from a variety of satellites\nwith different masses have been accreted. The region in the extended halo\nassociated with the off-centred envelope at 0$^o$ < P.A.< 90$^o$ (Arnaboldi et\nal. 2012) has higher metallicity with respect to the symmetric external halo.\nThe different stellar populations in the inner galaxy and extended halo reflect\nthe dominance of in situ stars in the former and the accreted origin for the\nlarge majority of the stars in the latter. These results provide supporting\nevidence to the recent theoretical models of formation of massive ellipticals\nas a two-phase process.\n", "  We present a new method to effectively select objects which may be low-mass\nactive black holes (BHs) at galaxy centers using high-cadence optical imaging\ndata, and our first spectroscopic identification of an active 2.7x10^6 Msun BH\nat z=0.164. This active BH was originally selected due to its rapid optical\nvariability, from a few hours to a day, based on Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam~(HSC)\ng-band imaging data taken with 1-hour cadence. Broad and narrow H-alpha and\nmany other emission lines are detected in our optical spectra taken with Subaru\nFOCAS, and the BH mass is measured via the broad H-alpha emission line width\n(1,880 km s^{-1}) and luminosity (4.2x10^{40} erg s^{-1}) after careful\ncorrection for the atmospheric absorption around 7,580-7,720A. We measure the\nEddington ratio to be as low as 0.05, considerably smaller than those in a\nprevious SDSS sample with similar BH mass and redshift, which indicates one of\nthe strong potentials of our Subaru survey. The g-r color and morphology of the\nextended component indicate that the host galaxy is a star-forming galaxy. We\nalso show effectiveness of our variability selection for low-mass active BHs.\n", "  We have carried out a statistical study on the mid- and far-infrared (IR)\nproperties of Galactic IR bubbles observed by Spitzer. Using the Spitzer 8\n${\\mu}{\\rm m}$ images, we estimated the radii and covering fractions of their\nshells, and categorized them into closed, broken and unclassified bubbles with\nour data analysis method. Then, using the AKARI all-sky images at wavelengths\nof 9, 18, 65, 90, 140 and 160 ${\\mu}{\\rm m}$, we obtained the spatial\ndistributions and the luminosities of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH),\nwarm and cold dust components by decomposing 6-band spectral energy\ndistributions with model fitting. As a result, 180 sample bubbles show a wide\nrange of the total IR luminosities corresponding to the bolometric luminosities\nof a single B-type star to many O-type stars. For all the bubbles, we\ninvestigated relationships between the radius, luminosities and luminosity\nratios, and found that there are overall similarities in the IR properties\namong the bubbles regardless of their morphological types. In particular, they\nfollow a power-law relation with an index of $\\sim$3 between the total IR\nluminosity and radius, as expected from the conventional picture of the\nStr$\\rm{\\ddot{o}}$mgren sphere. The exceptions are large broken bubbles; they\nindicate higher total IR luminosities, lower fractional luminosities of the PAH\nemission, and dust heating sources located nearer to the shells. We discuss the\nimplications of those differences for a massive star-formation scenario.\n", "  Using the variational cluster approximation (VCA) and the cluster\nperturbation theory, we study the finite temperature phase diagram of a\nhalf-depleted periodic Anderson model on the honeycomb lattice at half filling\nfor a model of graphone, i.e., single-side hydrogenated graphene. The ground\nstate of this model is found to be ferromagnetic (FM) semi-metal. The spin wave\ndispersion in the FM state is linear in momentum at zero temperature but\nbecomes quadratic at finite temperatures, implying that the FM state is fragile\nagainst thermal fluctuations. Indeed, our VCA calculations find that the\nparamagnetic (PM) state dominates the finite temperature phase diagram. More\nsurprisingly, we find that massless Dirac quasiparticles with the linear energy\ndispersion emerge at the Fermi energy upon introducing the electron correlation\n$U$ at the impurity sites in the PM phase. The Dirac Fermi velocity is found to\nbe highly correlated to the quasiparticle weight of the emergent massless Dirac\nquasiparticles at the Fermi energy and monotonically increases with $U$. These\nunexpected massless Dirac quasiparticles are also examined with the Hubbard-I\napproximation and the origin is discussed in terms of the spectral weight\nredistribution involving a large energy scale of $U$. Considering an effective\nquasiparticle Hamiltonian which reproduces the single-particle excitations\nobtained by the Hubbard-I approximation, we argue that the massless Dirac\nquasiparticles are protected by the electron correlation. Our finding is\ntherefore the first example of the emergence of massless Dirac quasiparticles\ndue to dynamical electron correlations without breaking any spatial symmetry.\nThe experimental implications of our results for graphone as well as a graphene\nsheet on transition metal substrates are also briefly discussed.\n", "  A multi-objective genetic algorithm is developed for optimizing\nnonlinearities in diffraction limited storage rings. This algorithm determines\nsextupole and octupole strengths for chromaticity correction that deliver\noptimized dynamic aperture and beam lifetime. The algorithm makes use of\ndominance constraints to breed desirable properties into the early generations.\nThe momentum aperture is optimized indirectly by constraining the chromatic\ntune footprint and optimizing the off-energy dynamic aperture. The result is an\neffective and computationally efficient technique for correcting chromaticity\nin a storage ring while maintaining optimal dynamic aperture and beam lifetime.\nThis framework was developed for the Swiss Light Source (SLS) upgrade project.\n", "  We address the problem of calculating the transverse magnetic field in the\nsolar wind outside of the hypothetical sphere called the source surface where\nthe solar wind originates. This calculation must overcome a widely used\nfundamental assumption about the source surface -- the field is normally\nrequired to purely radial at the source surface. Our model rests on the fact\nthat a change in the radial field strength at the source surface is a change in\nthe field line density. Surrounding field lines must move laterally in order to\naccommodate this field line density change. As the outward wind velocity drags\nfield lines past the source surface this lateral component of motion produces a\ntilt implying there is a transverse component to the field.\n  An analytic method of calculating the lateral translation speed of the field\nlines is developed. We apply the technique to an interval of approximately two\nCarrington rotations at the beginning of 2011 using 2-h averages of data from\nthe Helioseismic Magnetic Imager instrument on the Solar Dynamics Observatory\nspacecraft. We find that the value of the transverse magnetic field is\ndominated on a global scale by the effects of high latitude concentrations of\nfield lines being buffetted by supergranular motions.\n", "  The expected level of gamma-gamma absorption in the Broad Line Region (BLR)\nradiation field of gamma-ray loud Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs)is\nevaluated as a function of the location of the gamma-ray emission region. This\nis done self-consistently with parameters inferred from the shape of the\nspectral energy distribution (SED) in a single-zone leptonic EC-BLR model\nscenario. We take into account all geometrical effects both in the calculation\nof the gamma-gamma opacity and the normalization of the BLR radiation energy\ndensity. As specific examples, we study the FSRQs 3C279 and PKS 1510-089,\nkeeping the BLR radiation energy density at the location of the emission region\nfixed at the values inferred from the SED. We confirm previous findings that\nthe optical depth due to $\\gamma\\gamma$ absorption in the BLR radiation field\nexceeds unity for both 3C279 and PKS 1510-089 for locations of the gamma-ray\nemission region inside the inner boundary of the BLR. It decreases\nmonotonically, with distance from the central engine and drops below unity for\nlocations within the BLR. For locations outside the BLR, the BLR radiation\nenergy density required for the production of GeV gamma-rays rapidly increases\nbeyond observational constraints, thus making the EC-BLR mechanism implausible.\nTherefore, in order to avoid significant gamma-gamma absorption by the BLR\nradiation field, the gamma-ray emission region must therefore be located near\nthe outer boundary of the BLR.\n", "  Using UV spectra and SJIs from the IRIS, and coronal images and magnetograms\nfrom the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), we present the new features in a\nquiescent filament channel: subarcsecond bright points (BPs) and quasi-periodic\nupflows. The BPs in the TR have a spatial scale of about 350$-$580 km and\nlifetime of more than several tens of minutes. They are located at stronger\nmagnetic structures in the filament channel, with magnetic flux of about\n10$^{17}$$-$10$^{18}$ Mx. Quasi-periodic brightenings and upflows are observed\nin the BPs and the period is about 4$-$5 min. The BP and the associated\njet-like upflow comprise a \"tadpole-shaped\" structure. The upflows move along\nbright filament threads and their directions are almost parallel to the spine\nof the filament. The upflows initiated from the BPs with opposite polarity\nmagnetic fields have opposite directions. The velocity of the upflows in plane\nof sky is about 5$-$50 km s$^{-1}$. The emission line of Si IV 1402.77 {\\AA} at\nthe locations of upflows exhibits obvious blueshifts of about 5$-$30 km\ns$^{-1}$, and the line profile is broadened with the width of more than 20 km\ns$^{-1}$. The BPs seem to be the bases of filament threads and the upflows are\nable to convey mass for the dynamic balance of the filament. The\n\"counter-streaming\" flows in previous observations may be caused by the\npropagation of bi-directional upflows initiated from opposite polarity magnetic\nfields. We suggest that quasi-periodic brightenings of BPs and quasi-periodic\nupflows result from small-scale oscillatory magnetic reconnections, which are\nmodulated by solar p-mode waves.\n", "  We present the first comprehensive thermal and rotational analysis of the\nsecond most distant trans-Neptunian object (225088) 2007 OR10. We combined\noptical light curves provided by the Kepler space telescope -- K2 extended\nmission and thermal infrared data provided by the Herschel Space Observatory.\nWe found that (225088) 2007 OR10 is likely to be larger and darker than derived\nby earlier studies: we obtained a diameter of d=1535^{+75}_{-225} km which\nplaces (225088) 2007 OR10 in the biggest top three trans-Neptunian objects. The\ncorresponding visual geometric albedo is p_V=0.089^{+0.031}_{-0.009}. The light\ncurve analysis revealed a slow rotation rate of P_rot=44.81+/-0.37 h,\nsuperseded by a very few objects only. The most likely light-curve solution is\ndouble-peaked with a slight asymmetry, however, we cannot safely rule out the\npossibility of having a rotation period of P_rot=22.40+/-0.18 h which\ncorresponds to a single-peaked solution. Due to the size and slow rotation, the\nshape of the object should be a MacLaurin ellipsoid, so the light variation\nshould be caused by surface inhomogeneities. Its newly derived larger diameter\nalso implies larger surface gravity and a more likely retention of volatiles --\nCH_4, CO and N_2 -- on the surface.\n", "  The Planck collaboration has measured the temperature and polarization of the\ncosmic microwave background well enough to determine the locations of eight\npeaks in the temperature (TT) power spectrum, five peaks in the polarization\n(EE) power spectrum and twelve extrema in the cross (TE) power spectrum. The\nrelative locations of these extrema give a striking, and beautiful,\ndemonstration of what we expect from acoustic oscillations in the plasma; e.g.,\nthat EE peaks fall half way between TT peaks. We expect this because the\ntemperature map is predominantly sourced by temperature variations in the last\nscattering surface, while the polarization map is predominantly sourced by\ngradients in the velocity field, and the harmonic oscillations have temperature\nand velocity 90 degrees out of phase. However, there are large differences in\nexpectations for extrema locations from simple analytic models vs. numerical\ncalculations. Here we quantitatively explore the origin of these differences in\ngravitational potential transients, neutrino free-streaming, the breakdown of\ntight coupling, the shape of the primordial power spectrum, details of the\ngeometric projection from three to two dimensions, and the thickness of the\nlast scattering surface. We also compare the peak locations determined from\nPlanck measurements to expectations under the $\\Lambda$CDM model. Taking into\naccount how the peak locations were determined, we find them to be in\nagreement.\n", "  We study the ground-state phase diagram and dynamics of the one-dimensional\ncluster model with several competing interactions. Paying particular attention\nto the relation between the entanglement spectrum (ES) and the bulk topological\n(winding) number, we first map out the ground-state phases of the model and\ndetermine the universality classes of the transitions from the exact solution.\nWe then investigate the dynamical properties during interaction sweeps through\nthe critical points of topological phase transitions. When the sweep speed is\nslow, the correlation functions and the entanglement entropy exhibit spatially\nperiodic structures. On top of this, the levels in the ES oscillate temporally\nduring the dynamics. By explicitly calculating the above quantities for excited\nstates, we attribute these behaviors to the Bogoliubov quasiparticles generated\nnear the critical points. We also show that the ES reflects the strength of the\nMajorana correlation even for the excited states.\n", "  3D Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulent flows with initially magnetic and\nkinetic energies at equipartition spontaneously develop a magnetic excess (or\nresidual energy), as well in numerical simulations and in the solar wind.\nClosure equations obtained in 1983 describe the residual spectrum as being\nproduced by a dynamo source proportional to the total energy spectrum, balanced\nby a linear Alfv\\'en damping term. A good agreement was found in 2005 with\nincompressible simulations; however, recent solar wind measurements disagree\nwith these results. The previous dynamo-Alfv\\'en theory is generalized to a\nfamily of models, leading to simple relations between residual and total energy\nspectra. We want to assess these models in detail against MHD simulations and\nsolar wind data. The family of models is tested against compressible decaying\nMHD simulations with low Mach number, low cross-helicity, zero mean magnetic\nfield, without or with expansion terms (EBM or expanding box model). A single\ndynamo-Alfv\\'en model is found to describe correctly both solar wind scalings\nand compressible simulations without or with expansion. It is equivalent to the\n1983-2005 closure equation but with critical balance of nonlinear turnover and\nlinear Alfv\\'en times, while the dynamo source term remains unchanged. The\ndiscrepancy with previous incompressible simulations is elucidated. The model\npredicts a linear relation between the spectral slopes of total and residual\nenergies $m_R = -1/2 + 3/2 m_T$. Examining the solar wind data as in\n\\cite{2013ApJ...770..125C}, our relation is found to be valid whatever the\ncross-helicity, even better so at high cross-helicity, with the total energy\nslope varying from $1.7$ to $1.55$.\n", "  The first long-baseline ALMA campaign resolved the disk around the young star\nHL Tau into a number of axisymmetric bright and dark rings. Despite the very\nyoung age of HL Tau these structures have been interpreted as signatures for\nthe presence of (proto)planets. The ALMA images triggered numerous theoretical\nstudies based on disk-planet interactions, magnetically driven disk structures,\nand grain evolution. Of special interest are the inner parts of disks, where\nterrestrial planets are expected to form. However, the emission from these\nregions in HL Tau turned out to be optically thick at all ALMA wavelengths,\npreventing the derivation of surface density profiles and grain size\ndistributions. Here, we present the most sensitive images of HL Tau obtained to\ndate with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array at 7.0 mm wavelength with a\nspatial resolution comparable to the ALMA images. At this long wavelength the\ndust emission from HL Tau is optically thin, allowing a comprehensive study of\nthe inner disk. We obtain a total disk dust mass of 0.001 - 0.003 Msun,\ndepending on the assumed opacity and disk temperature. Our optically thin data\nalso indicate fast grain growth, fragmentation, and formation of dense clumps\nin the inner densest parts of the disk. Our results suggest that the HL Tau\ndisk may be actually in a very early stage of planetary formation, with planets\nnot already formed in the gaps but in the process of future formation in the\nbright rings.\n", "  We discuss the thermal pressures ($n_H T$) in predominantly cold, neutral\ninterstellar gas in the Magellanic Clouds, derived from analyses of the\nfine-structure excitation of neutral carbon, as seen in high-resolution\nHST/STIS spectra of seven diverse sight lines in the LMC and SMC. Detailed fits\nto the line profiles of the absorption from C I, C I*, and C I** yield\nconsistent column densities for the 3--6 C I multiplets detected in each sight\nline. In the LMC and SMC, $N$(C I$_{\\rm tot}$) is consistent with Galactic\ntrends versus $N$(Na I) and $N$(CH), but is slightly lower versus $N$(K I) and\n$N$(H$_2$). As for $N$(Na I) and $N$(K I), $N$(C I$_{\\rm tot}$) is generally\nsignificantly lower, for a given $N$(H$_{\\rm tot}$), in the LMC and\n(especially) in the SMC, compared to the local Galactic relationship. For the\nLMC and SMC components with well determined column densities for C I, C I*, and\nC I**, the derived thermal pressures are typically factors of a few higher than\nthe values found for most cold, neutral clouds in the Galactic ISM. Such\ndifferences are consistent with the predictions of models for clouds in systems\n(like the LMC and SMC) that are characterized by lower metallicities, lower\ndust-to-gas ratios, and enhanced radiation fields -- where higher pressures are\nrequired for stable cold, neutral clouds. The pressures may be further enhanced\nby energetic activity (e.g., due to stellar winds, star formation, and/or\nsupernova remnants) in several of the regions probed by these sight lines.\nComparisons are made with the C I observed in some quasar absorption-line\nsystems.\n", "  Context. Coronal heating is currently thought to proceed via the mechanism of\nnanoflares, small-scale and possibly recurring heating events that release\nmagnetic energy. Aims. We investigate the effects of a periodic high-energy\nelectron beam on the synthetic spectra of coronal Fe ions. Methods. Initially,\nthe coronal plasma is assumed to be Maxwellian with a temperature of 1 MK. The\nhigh-energy beam, described by a kappa-distribution, is then switched on every\nperiod $P$ for the duration of P/2. The periods are on the order of several\ntens of seconds, similar to exposure times or cadences of space-borne\nspectrometers. Ionization, recombination, and excitation rates for the\nrespective distributions are used to calculate the resulting non-equilibrium\nionization state of Fe and the instantaneous and period-averaged synthetic\nspectra. Results. Under the presence of the periodic electron beam, the plasma\nis out of ionization equilibrium at all times. The resulting spectra averaged\nover one period are almost always multithermal if interpreted in terms of\nionization equilibrium for either a Maxwellian or a kappa-distribution.\nExceptions occur, however; the EM-loci curves appear to have a nearly\nisothermal crossing-point for some values of kappa_s. The instantaneous spectra\nshow fast changes in intensities of some lines, especially those formed outside\nof the peak of the respective EM(T) distributions if the ionization equilibrium\nis assumed.\n", "  Long-lived radioactive nuclei play an important role as\nnucleo-cosmochronometers and as cosmic tracers of nucleosynthetic source\nactivity. In particular nuclei in the actinide region like thorium, uranium,\nand plutonium can testify to the enrichment of an environment by the still\nenigmatic astrophysical sources that are responsible for the production of\nneutron-rich nuclei by the rapid neutron-capture process (r-process).\nSupernovae and merging neutron-star (NS) or NS-black hole binaries are\nconsidered as most likely sources of the r-nuclei. But arguments in favour of\none or the other or both are indirect and make use of assumptions; they are\nbased on theoretical models with remaining simplifications and shortcomings. An\nunambiguous observational determination of a production event is still missing.\nIn order to facilitate searches in this direction, e.g.\\ by looking for\nradioactive tracers in stellar envelopes, the interstellar medium or\nterrestrial reservoirs, we provide improved theoretical estimates and\ncorresponding uncertainty ranges for the actinide production ($^{232}$Th,\n$^{235,236,238}$U, $^{237}$Np, $^{244}$Pu, and $^{247}$Cm) in neutrino-driven\nwinds of core-collapse supernovae. Since state-of-the-art supernova models do\nnot yield r-process viable conditions ---but still lack, for example, the\neffects of strong magnetic fields--- we base our investigation on a simple\nanalytical, Newtonian, adiabatic and steady-state wind model and consider the\nsuperposition of a large number of contributing components, whose\nnucleosynthesis-relevant parameters (mass weight, entropy, expansion time\nscale, and neutron excess) are constrained by the assumption that the\nintegrated wind nucleosynthesis closely reproduces the solar system\ndistribution of r-process elements. We also test the influence of uncertain\nnuclear physics.\n", "  Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are ideal probes of the epoch of the first stars and\ngalaxies. We review the recent theoretical understanding of the formation and\nevolution of the first (so-called Population III) stars, in light of their\nviability of providing GRB progenitors. We proceed to discuss possible unique\nobservational signatures of such bursts, based on the current formation\nscenario of long GRBs. These include signatures related to the prompt emission\nmechanism, as well as to the afterglow radiation, where the surrounding\nintergalactic medium might imprint a telltale absorption spectrum. We emphasize\nimportant remaining uncertainties in our emerging theoretical framework.\n", "  Aims. We aim studying the use of cross-correlation techniques to infer the\nfrequency shifts induced by changing magnetic fields in the p-mode frequencies\nand provide precise estimation of the error bars. Methods. This technique and\nthe calculation of the associated errors is first tested and validated on the\nSun where the p-mode magnetic behaviour is very well known. These validation\ntests are performed on 6000-day time series of Sun-as-a-star observations\ndelivered by the SoHO spacecraft. Errors of the frequency shifts are quantified\nthrough Monte Carlo simulations. The same methodology is then applied to three\nsolar-like oscillating stars: HD 49933, observed by CoRoT, as well as KIC\n3733735 and KIC 7940546 observed by Kepler. Results. We first demonstrate the\nreliability of the error bars computed with the Monte Carlo simulations using\nthe Sun. From the three analyzed stars we confirm the presence of a magnetic\nactivity cycle with this methodology in HD 49933 and we unveil seismic\nsignature of on going magnetic variations in KIC 3733735. Finally, the third\nstar, KIC 7940546, seems to be in a quiet regime.\n", "  We study the differences in the heavy ion composition of solar energetic\nparticle (SEP) events between solar cycles 23 and 24. We have surveyed the\nSOHO/ERNE heavy ion data from the beginning of solar cycle 23 until the end of\nJune 2015, that is, well into the declining phase of cycle 24. We used this\nlong observation period to study the properties of heavy ions (from C to Fe)\nand to compare the two solar cycles in this respect. We surveyed the data for\nSEP events with enhancements in the Fe/C and Fe/O intensity ratios in the\nenergy range 5-15 MeV per nucleon, and associated the events with solar flare\nand coronal mass ejections (CME) when possible. We studied the properties of\nheavy ions in these events and compared the average relative abundances of\nheavy ions between the two solar cycles. We found that fewer days had C and O\nintensities higher than ~10$^{-3}$\ncm$^{-2}$sr$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$(MeVn$^{-1}$)$^{-1}$ during solar cycle 24 than\nduring cycle 23. For Fe this difference was clear even at lower intensities. We\nalso found that fewer days had Fe/(C+O) > 0.183 during cycle 24. We identified\n86 SEP events with at least one Fe-rich day, 65 of which occurred during cycle\n23 and only 21 during cycle 24. We found that impulsive events have been almost\ncompletely absent during cycle 24. Mean abundances of heavy ions in the events\nwere found to be significantly lower during cycle 24 than in cycle 23. Our\nresults reflect the reduced solar activity in cycle 24 and indicate lower\nefficiency of particle acceleration processes for both gradual and impulsive\nSEP events in cycle 24.\n", "  The absence of intrinsic broad line emission has been reported in a number of\nactive galactic nuclei (AGN), including some with high Eddington ratios. Such\n\"true type 2 AGN\" are inherent to the disk-wind scenario for the broad line\nregion: Broad line emission requires a minimal column density, implying a\nminimal outflow rate and thus a minimal accretion rate. Here we perform a\ndetailed analysis of the consequences of mass conservation in the process of\naccretion through a central disk. The resulting constraints on luminosity are\nconsistent with all the cases where claimed detections of true type 2 AGN pass\nstringent criteria, and predict that intrinsic broad line emission can\ndisappear at luminosities as high as about 4x$10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and any\nEddington ratio, though more detections can be expected at Eddington ratios\nbelow about 1%. Our results are applicable to every disk outflow model,\nwhatever its details and whether clumpy or smooth, irrespective of the wind\nstructure and its underlying dynamics. While other factors, such as changes in\nspectral energy distribution or covering factor, can affect the intensities of\nbroad emission lines, within this scenario they can only produce true type 2\nAGN of higher luminosity then those prescribed by mass conservation.\n", "  We explain some phenomena existing generally in the timing residuals:\namplitude and sign of the second derivative of a pulsar's spin-frequency\n($\\ddot\\nu$), some sophisticated residual patterns, which also change with the\ntime span of data segments. The sample is taken from Hobbs et al.\\,(2010), in\nwhich the pulsar's spin-frequency and its first derivative have been subtracted\nfrom the timing solution fitting. We first classify the timing residual\npatterns into different types based on the sign of $\\ddot\\nu$. Then we use the\nmagnetic field oscillation model developed in our group \\citep{zhang12a} to fit\nsuccessfully the different kinds of timing residuals with the Markov Chain\nMonte Carlo method. Finally, we simulate the spin evolution over 20 years for a\npulsar with typical parameters and analyze the data with the conventional\ntiming solution fitting. By choosing different segments of the simulated data,\nwe find that most of the observed residual patterns can be reproduced\nsuccessfully. This is the first time that the observed residual patterns are\nfitted by a model and reproduced by simulations with very few parameters. From\nthe distribution of the different residual patterns in the $P-\\dot P$ diagram,\nwe argue that (1) a single magnetic field oscillation mode exists commonly in\nall pulsars throughout their lifetimes; (2) there may be a transition period\nover the lifetimes of pulsars, in which multiple magnetic field oscillation\nmodes exist.\n", "  Improving survey specifications are causing an exponential rise in pulsar\ncandidate numbers and data volumes. We study the candidate filters used to\nmitigate these problems during the past fifty years. We find that some existing\nmethods such as applying constraints on the total number of candidates\ncollected per observation, may have detrimental effects on the success of\npulsar searches. Those methods immune to such effects are found to be\nill-equipped to deal with the problems associated with increasing data volumes\nand candidate numbers, motivating the development of new approaches. We\ntherefore present a new method designed for on-line operation. It selects\npromising candidates using a purpose-built tree-based machine learning\nclassifier, the Gaussian Hellinger Very Fast Decision Tree (GH-VFDT), and a new\nset of features for describing candidates. The features have been chosen so as\nto i) maximise the separation between candidates arising from noise and those\nof probable astrophysical origin, and ii) be as survey-independent as possible.\nUsing these features our new approach can process millions of candidates in\nseconds (~1 million every 15 seconds), with high levels of pulsar recall\n(90%+). This technique is therefore applicable to the large volumes of data\nexpected to be produced by the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Use of this\napproach has assisted in the discovery of 20 new pulsars in data obtained\nduring the LOFAR Tied-Array All-Sky Survey (LOTAAS).\n", "  A continuous process of creation of particles is investigated as a possible\nconnection between the inflationary stage with late cosmic acceleration. In\nthis model, the inflationary era occurs due to a continuous and fast process of\ncreation of relativistic particles, and the recent accelerating phase is driven\nby the non-relativistic matter creation from the gravitational field acting on\nthe quantum vacuum, which finally results in an effective equation of state\nless than $-1$. Thus, explaining recent results in favor of a phantom dynamics\nwithout the need of any modifications in the gravity theory has been proposed.\nFinally, we confront the model with recent observational data of type Ia\nSupernova, history of the Hubble parameter, baryon acoustic oscillations, and\nthe cosmic microwave background.\n", "  The aim here is to model the standing torsional oscillations in solar\nspicules in the presence of density stratification, magnetic field expansion,\nand steady flows. By implementing cylindrical geometry, the eigenfrequencies,\neigenfunctions, and the period ratio P_1/P_2 of these waves is obtained for\nfinite plasma-beta. The shifts created by the steady flow justifies the\ndivergence of the observed period ratio for the first and second periods from\nthe number 2.\n", "  We present 8.5 arcsec resolution 1.1mm continuum imaging and CO spectroscopic\nredshift measurements of eight extremely bright submillimetre galaxies\nidentified from the Planck and Herschel surveys, taken with the Large\nMillimeter Telescope's AzTEC and Redshift Search Receiver instruments. We\ncompiled a candidate list of high redshift galaxies by cross-correlating the\nPlanck Surveyor mission's highest frequency channel (857 GHz, FWHM = 4.5\narcmin) with the archival Herschel Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver\n(SPIRE) imaging data, and requiring the presence of a unique, single Herschel\ncounterpart within the 150 arcsec search radius of the Planck source positions\nwith 350 micron flux density larger than 100 mJy, excluding known blazars and\nforeground galaxies. All eight candidate objects observed are detected in 1.1mm\ncontinuum by AzTEC bolometer camera, and at least one CO line is detected in\nall cases with a spectroscopic redshift between 1.3 < z(CO) < 3.3. Their\ninfrared spectral energy distributions mapped using the Herschel and AzTEC\nphotometry are consistent with cold dust emission with characteristic\ntemperature between $T_d$ = 43 K and 84 K. With apparent infrared luminosity of\nup to L(IR) = $3\\times10^{14} \\mu^{-1} L_\\odot$, they are some of the most\nluminous galaxies ever found (with yet unknown gravitational magnification\nfactor $\\mu$). The analysis of their spectral energy distributions (SEDs)\nsuggests that star formation is powering the bulk of their extremely large IR\nluminosities. Derived molecular gas masses of $M_{H2}=(0.6-7.8)\\times 10^{11}\nM_\\odot$ (for $\\mu$~10) also make them some of the most gas-rich high redshift\ngalaxies ever detected.\n", "  Thermal conductivity of hadron matter is studied using a microscopic\ntransport model, which will be used to simulate ultra-relativistic heavy ion\ncollisions at different energy densities, namely the Ultra-relativistic Quantum\nMolecular Dynamics (UrQMD). The molecular dynamics simulation is performed for\na system of light mesons species (pion, rho, kaon) in a box with periodic\nboundary conditions. The equilibrium state is investigated by studying chemical\nequilibrium and thermal equilibrium of the system. Particle multiplicity\nequilibrates with time, and the energy spectra of different light mesons\nspecies have the same slopes and common temperatures when thermal equilibrium\nis reached. Thermal conductivity transport coefficient is calculated from the\nheat current - current correlations using the Green-Kubo relations.\n", "  Cosmic rays (CRs) in starburst galaxies produce high energy gamma-rays by\ncolliding with the dense interstellar medium (ISM). Arp 220 is the nearest\nultra luminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) that has star-formation at extreme\nlevels, so it has long been predicted to emit high-energy gamma-rays. However,\nno evidence of gamma-ray emission was found despite intense efforts of search.\nHere we report the discovery of high-energy gamma-ray emission above 200 MeV\nfrom Arp 220 at a confidence level of $\\sim 6.3 \\sigma $ using 7.5 years of\n\\textsl {Fermi} Large Area Telescope observations. The gamma-ray emission shows\nno significant variability over the observation period and it is consistent\nwith the quasi-linear scaling relation between the gamma-ray luminosity and\ntotal infrared luminosity for star-forming galaxies, suggesting that these\ngamma-rays arise from CR interactions. As the high density medium of Arp 220\nmakes it an ideal CR calorimeter, the gamma-ray luminosity can be used to\nmeasure the efficiency of powering CRs by supernova (SN) remnants given a known\nsupernova rate in Arp 220. We find that this efficiency is about $4.2\\pm2.6\\%$\nfor CRs above 1 GeV.\n", "  We applied three statistical classification techniques - linear discriminant\nanalysis (LDA), logistic regression and random forests - to three astronomical\ndatasets associated with searches for interstellar masers. We compared the\nperformance of these methods in identifying whether specific mid-infrared or\nmillimetre continuum sources are likely to have associated interstellar masers.\nWe also discuss the ease, or otherwise, with which the results of each\nclassification technique can be interpreted. Non-parametric methods have the\npotential to make accurate predictions when there are complex relationships\nbetween critical parameters. We found that for the small datasets the\nparametric methods logistic regression and LDA performed best, for the largest\ndataset the non-parametric method of random forests performed with comparable\naccuracy to parametric techniques, rather than any significant improvement.\nThis suggests that at least for the specific examples investigated here\naccuracy of the predictions obtained is not being limited by the use of\nparametric models. We also found that for LDA, transformation of the data to\nmatch a normal distribution in the input parameters led to big improvements in\naccuracy. The different classification techniques had significant overlap in\ntheir predictions, further astronomical observations will enable the accuracy\nof these predictions to be tested.\n", "  We present 947 radial velocities of RR Lyrae variable stars in four fields\nlocated toward the Galactic bulge, observed within the data from the ongoing\nBulge RR Lyrae Radial Velocity Assay (BRAVA-RR). We show that these RR Lyrae\nstars exhibit hot kinematics and null or negligible rotation and are therefore\nmembers of a separate population from the bar/pseudobulge that currently\ndominates the mass and luminosity of the inner Galaxy. Our RR Lyrae stars\npredate these structures, and have metallicities, kinematics, and spatial\ndistribution that are consistent with a \"classical\" bulge, although we cannot\nyet completely rule out the possibility that they are the metal-poor tail of a\nmore metal rich ([Fe/H] ~ -1 dex) halo-bulge population. The complete catalog\nof radial velocities for the BRAVA-RR stars is also published electronically.\n", "  ATLAS and CMS have reported an excess in the flavor violating decay of the\nHiggs boson, $h \\rightarrow \\mu \\tau$. We show that this result can be\naccommodated through a mixing of the Higgs with a flavon, the field responsible\nfor generating the Yukawa matrices in the lepton sector. We employ a version of\nthe Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism at the electroweak scale, with only the leptons\nand the flavon transforming non--trivially under the corresponding symmetry\ngroup. Non--observation of charged lepton flavor violation (LFV) in other\nprocesses imposes important constraints on the model, which we find to be\nsatisfied in substantial regions of parameter space.\n", "  In this work we investigate the global activity patterns predicted from a\nmodel active region heated by distributions of nanoflares that have a range of\nfrequencies. What differs is the average frequency of the distributions. The\nactivity patterns are manifested in time lag maps of narrow-band instrument\nchannel pairs. We combine hydrodynamic and forward modeling codes with a\nmagnetic field extrapolation to create a model active region and apply the time\nlag method to synthetic observations. Our aim is not to reproduce a particular\nset of observations in detail, but to recover some typical properties and\npatterns observed in active regions. Our key findings are the following. 1.\ncooling dominates the time lag signature and the time lags between the channel\npairs are generally consistent with observed values. 2. shorter coronal loops\nin the core cool more quickly than longer loops at the periphery. 3. all\nchannel pairs show zero time lag when the line-of-sight passes through coronal\nloop foot-points. 4. there is strong evidence that plasma must be re-energized\non a time scale comparable to the cooling timescale to reproduce the observed\ncoronal activity, but it is likely that a relatively broad spectrum of heating\nfrequencies are operating across active regions. 5. due to their highly dynamic\nnature, we find nanoflare trains produce zero time lags along entire flux tubes\nin our model active region that are seen between the same channel pairs in\nobserved active regions.\n", "  Winds of AGB stars are thought to be driven by a combination of\npulsation-induced shock waves and radiation pressure on dust. In dynamic\natmosphere and wind models, the stellar pulsation is often simulated by\nprescribing a simple sinusoidal variation in velocity and luminosity at the\ninner boundary of the model atmosphere. We experiment with different forms of\nthe luminosity variation in order to assess the effects on the wind velocity\nand mass-loss rate, when progressing from the simple sinusoidal recipe towards\nmore realistic descriptions. Using state-of-the-art dynamical models of C-rich\nAGB stars, a range of different asymmetric shapes of the luminosity variation\nand a range of phase shifts of the luminosity variation relative to the radial\nvariation are tested. These tests are performed on two stellar atmosphere\nmodels. The first model has dust condensation and, as a consequence, a stellar\nwind is triggered, while the second model lacks both dust and wind. The first\nmodel with dust and stellar wind is very sensitive to moderate changes in the\nluminosity variation. There is a complex relationship between the luminosity\nminimum, and dust condensation: changing the phase corresponding to minimum\nluminosity can either increase or decrease mass-loss rate and wind velocity.\nThe luminosity maximum dominates the radiative pressure on the dust, which in\nturn, is important for driving the wind. These effects of changed luminosity\nvariation are coupled with the dust formation. In contrast there is very little\nchange to the structure of the model without dust. Changing the luminosity\nvariation, both by introducing a phase shift and by modifying the shape,\ninfluences wind velocity and the mass-loss rate. To improve wind models it\nwould probably be desirable to extract boundary conditions from 3D dynamical\ninterior models or stellar pulsation models.\n", "  The long-period, highly eccentric O-star binary 9 Sgr, known for its\nnon-thermal radio emission and its relatively bright X-ray emission, went\nthrough its periastron in 2013. Such an event can be used to observationally\ntest the predictions of the theory of colliding stellar winds over a broad\nrange of wavelengths. We have conducted a multi-wavelength monitoring campaign\nof 9 Sgr around the 2013 periastron. In this paper, we focus on X-ray\nobservations and optical spectroscopy. The optical spectra allow us to revisit\nthe orbital solution of 9 Sgr and to refine its orbital period to 9.1 years.\nThe X-ray flux is maximum at periastron over all energy bands, but with clear\ndifferences as a function of energy. The largest variations are observed at\nenergies above 2 keV, whilst the spectrum in the soft band (0.5 - 1.0 keV)\nremains mostly unchanged indicating that it arises far from the collision\nregion, in the inner winds of the individual components. The level of the hard\nemission at periastron clearly deviates from the 1/r relation expected for an\nadiabatic wind interaction zone, whilst this relation seems to hold at the\nother phases covered by our observations. The spectra taken at phase 0.946\nreveal a clear Fe xxv line at 6.7 keV, but no such line is detected at\nperiastron (phi = 0.000) although a simple model predicts a strong line that\nshould be easily visible in the data. The peculiarities of the X-ray spectrum\nof 9 Sgr could reflect the impact of radiative inhibition as well as a\nphase-dependent efficiency of particle acceleration on the shock properties.\n", "  We propose a semianalytical method to compute the strengths on each of the\nthree massive bodies participating in a three body mean motion resonance (3BR).\n  Applying this method we explore the dependence of the strength on the masses,\nthe orbital parameters and the order of the resonance and we compare with\nprevious studies. We confirm that for low eccentricity low inclination orbits\nzero order resonances are the strongest ones; but for excited orbits higher\norder 3BRs become also dynamically relevant. By means of numerical integrations\nand the construction of dynamical maps we check some of the predictions of the\nmethod. We numerically explore the possibility of a planetary system to be\ntrapped in a 3BR due to a migrating scenario. Our results suggest that capture\nin a chain of two body resonances is more probable than a capture in a pure\n3BR. When a system is locked in a 3BR and one of the planets is forced to\nmigrate the other two can react migrating in different directions. We exemplify\nstudying the case of the Galilean satellites where we show the relevance of the\ndifferent resonances acting on the three innermost satellites.\n", "  Perturbative algebraic quantum field theory (pAQFT) is a mathematically\nrigorous framework that allows to construct models of quantum field theories on\na general class of Lorentzian manifolds. Recently this idea has been applied\nalso to perturbative quantum gravity, treated as an effective theory. The\ndifficulty was to find the right notion of observables that would in an\nappropriate sense be diffeomorphism invariant. In this article I will outline a\ngeneral framework that allows to quantize theories with local symmetries (this\nincludes infinitesimal diffeomorphism transformations) with the use of the BV\n(Batalin-Vilkovisky) formalism. This approach has been successfully applied to\neffective quantum gravity in a recent paper by R. Brunetti, K. Fredenhagen and\nmyself. In the same paper we also proved perturbative background independence\nof the quantized theory, which is going to be discussed in the present work as\nwell.\n", "  We report multi-wavelength and multi-viewpoint observations of a solar\neruptive event which involves loop-loop interactions. During a C2.0 flare,\nmotions associated with inflowing and outflowing plasma provide evidence for\nongoing magnetic reconnection. The flare loop top and a rising \"concave-up\"\nfeature are connected by a current-sheet-like structure (CSLS). The physical\nproperties (thickness, length, temperature, and density) of the CSLS are\nevaluated. In regions adjacent to the CSLS, the EUV emission (characteristic\ntemperature at 1.6 MK) begins to increase more than ten minutes prior to the\nonset of the flare, and steeply decreases during the decay phase. The reduction\nof the emission resembles that expected from coronal dimming. The dynamics of\nthis event imply a magnetic reconnection rate in the range 0.01 -- 0.05.\n", "  We have carried out a multi-band photometric monitoring of the close visual\nbinary GJ3039, consisting of a M4 primary and a fainter secondary component,\nand likely member of the young stellar association $\\beta$ Pictoris (24-Myr\nold). From our analysis we found that both components are photometric variables\nand, for the first time, we detected two micro-flare events. We measured from\nperiodogram analysis of the photometric time series two rotation periods P =\n3.355d and P = 0.925d, that we could attribute to the brighter GJ3039A and the\nfainter GJ3039B components, respectively. A comparison of these rotation\nperiods with the period distribution of other $\\beta$ Pictoris members further\nsupports that GJ3039A is a member of this association. We find that also\nGJ3039B could be a member, but the infrared magnitude differences between the\ntwo components taken from the literature and the photometric variability, which\nis found to be comparable in both stars, suggest that GJ3039B could be a\nforeground star physically unbound to the primary A component.\n", "  We re-compute the recently derived two-loop five-point all plus Yang-Mills\namplitude using Unitarity and Recursion. Recursion requires augmented recursion\nto determine the sub-leading pole. Using these methods the simplicity of this\namplitude is understood.\n", "  High-quality astrometric, spectroscopic, interferometric and, importantly,\nasteroseismic observations are available for $\\alpha$ Cen A, which is the\nclosest binary star system to earth. Taking all these constraints into account,\nwe study the internal structure of the star by means of theoretical modelling.\nUsing the Aarhus STellar Evolution Code (ASTEC) and the tools of Computational\nBayesian Statistics, in particular a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, we\nperform statistical inferences for the physical characteristics of the star. We\nfind that $\\alpha$ Cen A has a probability of approximately 40% of having a\nconvective core. This probability drops to few percents if one considers\nreduced rates for the $^{14}$N(p,$\\gamma$)$^{15}$O reaction. These convective\ncores have fractional radii less than 8% when overshoot is neglected. Including\novershooting also leads to the possibility of a convective core mostly\nsustained by the ppII chain energy output. We finally show that roughly 30% of\nthe stellar models describing $\\alpha$ Cen A are in the subgiant regime.\n", "  Molecular spintronics is made possible by the coupling between electronic\nconfiguration and magnetic po- larization of the molecules. For control and\napplication of the individual molecular states it is necessary to both read and\nwrite their spin states. Conventionally, this is achieved by means of external\nmagnetic fields or ferromagnetic contacts, which may change the intentional\nspin state and may present additional challenges when downsizing devices. Here,\nwe predict that coupling magnetic molecules together opens up possibilities for\nall electrical control of both the molecular spin states as well as the current\nflow through the system. Tuning between the regimes of ferromagnetic and\nanti-ferromagnetic exchange interaction, the current can be, at least, an order\nof magnitude enhanced or reduced. The effect is susceptible to the tunnel\ncoupling and molecular level alignment which can be used to achieve current\nrectification.\n", "  We measure the cross-correlation signature between the Planck CMB lensing map\nand the weak lensing observations from both the Red-sequence Cluster Lensing\nSurvey (RCSLenS) and the Canada-France-Hawai Telescope Lensing Survey\n(CFHTLenS). In addition to a Fourier analysis, we include the first\nconfiguration-space detection, based on the estimators $\\langle \\kappa_{\\rm\nCMB} \\kappa_{\\rm gal} \\rangle$ and $\\langle \\kappa_{\\rm CMB} \\gamma_{t}\n\\rangle$. Combining 747.2 deg$^2$ from both surveys, we find a detection\nsignificance that exceeds $4.2\\sigma$ in both Fourier- and configuration-space\nanalyses. Scaling the predictions by a free parameter $A$, we obtain $A^{\\rm\nPlanck}_{\\rm CFHT}= 0.68\\pm 0.31 $ and $A^{\\rm Planck}_{\\rm RCS}= 1.31\\pm\n0.33$. In preparation for the next generation of measurements similar to these,\nwe quantify the impact of different analysis choices on these results. First,\nsince none of these estimators probes the exact same dynamical range, we\nimprove our detection by combining them. Second, we carry out a detailed\ninvestigation on the effect of apodization, zero-padding and mask\nmultiplication, validated on a suite of high-resolution simulations, and find\nthat the latter produces the largest systematic bias in the cosmological\ninterpretation. Finally, we show that residual contamination from intrinsic\nalignment and the effect of photometric redshift error are both largely\ndegenerate with the characteristic signal from massive neutrinos, however the\nsignature of baryon feedback might be easier to distinguish. The three lensing\ndatasets are now publicly available.\n", "  We present WISEA J114724.10$-$204021.3, a young, low-mass, high probability\nmember of the TW Hya association. WISEA J114724.10$-$204021.3 was discovered\nbased on its red AllWISE color (W1$-$W2 = 0.63 mag) and extremely red 2MASS\n$J-K_{\\rm S}$ color ($>$ 2.64 mag), the latter of which is confirmed with\nnear-infrared photometry from the VISTA Hemisphere Survey ($J-K_{\\rm S}$ =\n2.57$\\pm$0.03). Follow-up near-infrared spectroscopy shows a spectral type of\nL7 $\\pm$ 1 as well as several spectroscopic indicators of youth. These include\na peaked $H$-band shape and a steeper $K$-band slope, traits typically\nattributed to low surface gravity. The sky position, proper motion, and\ndistance estimates of WISEA J114724.10$-$204021.3 are all consistent with\nmembership in the $\\sim$10 Myr old TW Hya association. Using the age of the TW\nHya association and evolutionary models, we estimate the mass of WISEA\nJ114724.10$-$204021.3 to be 5$-$13 $M_{\\rm Jup}$, making it one of the youngest\nand lowest mass free-floating objects yet discovered in the Solar neighborhood.\n", "  Using a sample of 215 supernovae (SNe), we analyze their positions relative\nto the spiral arms of their host galaxies, distinguishing grand-design (GD)\nspirals from non-GD (NGD) galaxies. We find that: (1) in GD galaxies, an offset\nexists between the positions of Ia and core-collapse (CC) SNe relative to the\npeaks of arms, while in NGD galaxies the positions show no such shifts; (2) in\nGD galaxies, the positions of CC SNe relative to the peaks of arms are\ncorrelated with the radial distance from the galaxy nucleus. Inside (outside)\nthe corotation radius, CC SNe are found closer to the inner (outer) edge. No\nsuch correlation is observed for SNe in NGD galaxies nor for SNe Ia in either\ngalaxy class; (3) in GD galaxies, SNe Ibc occur closer to the leading edges of\nthe arms than do SNe II, while in NGD galaxies they are more concentrated\ntowards the peaks of arms. In both samples of hosts, the distributions of SNe\nIa relative to the arms have broader wings. These observations suggest that\nshocks in spiral arms of GD galaxies trigger star formation in the leading\nedges of arms affecting the distributions of CC SNe (known to have short-lived\nprogenitors). The closer locations of SNe Ibc vs. SNe II relative to the\nleading edges of the arms supports the belief that SNe Ibc have more massive\nprogenitors. SNe Ia having less massive and older progenitors, have more time\nto drift away from the leading edge of the spiral arms.\n", "  A first-principles approach called the {\\it{self-consistent quasiharmonic\napproximation}} (SC-QHA) method is formulated to calculate the thermal\nexpansion, thermomechanics, and thermodynamic functions of solids at finite\ntemperatures with both high efficiency and accuracy. The SC-QHA method requires\nfewer phonon calculations than the conventional QHA method, and also\nfacilitates the convenient analysis of the microscopic origins of macroscopic\nthermal phenomena. The superior performance of the SC-QHA method is\nsystematically examined by comparing it with the conventional QHA method and\nexperimental measurements on silicon, diamond, and alumina. It is then used to\nstudy the effects of pressure on the anharmonic lattice properties of diamond\nand alumina. The thermal expansion and thermomechanics of Ca$_3$Ti$_2$O$_7$,\nwhich is a recently discovered important ferroelectric ceramic with a complex\ncrystal structure that is computationally challenging for the conventional QHA\nmethod, are also calculated using the formulated SC-QHA method. The SC-QHA\nmethod can significantly reduce the computational expense for various\nquasiharmonic thermal properties especially when there are a large number of\nstructures to consider or when the solid is structurally complex. It is\nanticipated that the algorithm will be useful for a variety of fields,\nincluding oxidation, corrosion, high-pressure physics, ferroelectrics, and\nhigh-throughput structure screening when temperature effects are required to\naccurately describe realistic properties.\n", "  When masless excitations are limited or modified by the presence of material\nbodies one observes a force atcing between them generally called Casimir force.\nSuch excitations are present in any fluid system close to its true bulk\ncritical point. We derive exact analytical results for both the temperature and\nexternal ordering field behavior of the thermodynamic Casimir force within the\nmean-field Ginzburg-Landau Ising type model of a simple fluid or binary liquid\nmixture. We investigate the case when under a film geometry the boundaries of\nthe system exhibit strong adsorption onto one of the phases (components) of the\nsystem. We present analytical and numerical results for the (temperature-field)\nsurface of the force in both the critical region of the film close to its\nfinite-size or bulk critical points as well as in the capillary condensation\nregime below the finite-size critical point.\n", "  In a recent search for unusually red L and T dwarfs, we identified 2MASS\nJ11193254-1137466 as a likely young L7 dwarf and potential member of the TW\nHydrae association. We present spectra that confirm the youth of this object.\nWe also measure a radial velocity of 8.5 +/- 3.3 km/s that, together with the\nsky position, proper motion and photometric distance, results in a 92%\nprobability of membership in the TW Hydrae association, with a calibrated field\ncontamination probability of 0.0005% using the BANYAN II tool. Using the age of\nTW Hydrae and the luminosity of 2MASS J11193254-1137466, we estimate its mass\nto be 4.3--7.6 MJup. It is the lowest-mass and nearest isolated member of TW\nHydrae at a kinematic distance of 28.9 +/- 3.6 pc, and the second-brightest\nisolated <10 MJup object discovered to date.\n", "  We study the effect of the Rashba spin-orbit interaction in the quantum\ntransport of carbon nanotubes with arbitrary chiralities. For certain spin\ndirections, we find a strong spin-polarized electrical current that depends on\nthe diameter of the tube, the length of the Rashba region and on the tube\nchirality. Predictions for the spin-dependent conductances are presented for\ndifferent families of achiral and chiral tubes. We have found that different\nsymmetries acting on spatial and spin variables have to be considered in order\nto explain the relations between spin-resolved conductances in carbon\nnanotubes. These symmetries are more general than those employed in planar\ngraphene systems. Our results indicate the possibility of having stable\nspin-polarized electrical currents in absence of external magnetic fields or\nmagnetic impurities in carbon nanotubes.\n", "  Using the short-high module of the Infrared Spectrograph on the Spitzer Space\nTelescope, we have measured the [S IV] 10.51, [Ne II] 12.81, [Ne III] 15.56,\nand [S III] 18.71-micron emission lines in nine H II regions in the dwarf\nirregular galaxy NGC 6822. These lines arise from the dominant ionization\nstates of the elements neon (Ne$^{++}$, Ne$^+$) and sulphur (S$^{3+}$,\nS$^{++}$), thereby allowing an analysis of the neon to sulphur abundance ratio\nas well as the ionic abundance ratios Ne$^+$/Ne$^{++}$ and S$^{3+}$/S$^{++}$.\nBy extending our studies of H II regions in M83 and M33 to the lower\nmetallicity NGC 6822, we increase the reliability of the estimated Ne/S ratio.\nWe find that the Ne/S ratio appears to be fairly universal, with not much\nvariation about the ratio found for NGC 6822: the median (average) Ne/S ratio\nequals 11.6 (12.2$\\pm$0.8). This value is in contrast to Asplund et al.'s\ncurrently best estimated value for the Sun: Ne/S = 6.5. In addition, we\ncontinue to test the predicted ionizing spectral energy distributions (SEDs)\nfrom various stellar atmosphere models by comparing model nebulae computed with\nthese SEDs as inputs to our observational data, changing just the stellar\natmosphere model abundances. Here we employ a new grid of SEDs computed with\ndifferent metallicities: Solar, 0.4 Solar, and 0.1 Solar. As expected, these\nchanges to the SED show similar trends to those seen upon changing just the\nnebular gas metallicities in our plasma simulations: lower metallicity results\nin higher ionization. This trend agrees with the observations.\n", "  The professional literature provides one means to review the evolution and\ngeographic distribution of the scientific communities engaged in solar and\nheliospheric physics. With help of the Astrophysics Data System (NASA/ADS), I\ntrace the growth of the research community over the past century from a few\ndozen researchers early in the 20-th Century to over 4,000 names with over\nrefereed 2,000 publications in recent years, with 90% originating from 20\ncountries, being published in 90 distinct journals. Overall, the lead authors\nof these publications have their affiliations for 45% in Europe, 29% in the\nAmericas, 24% in Australasia, and 2% in Africa and Arab countries. Publications\nmost frequently appear (in decreasing order) in the Astrophysical Journal, the\nJournal of Geophysical Research (Space Physics), Solar Physics, Astronomy and\nAstrophysics, and Advances in Space Research (adding up to 59% of all\npublications in 2015).\n", "  We present K2SC (K2 Systematics Correction), a Python pipeline to model\ninstrumental systematics and astrophysical variability in light curves from the\nK2 mission. K2SC uses Gaussian process regression to model position-dependent\nsystematics and time-dependent variability simultaneously, enabling the user to\nremove both (e.g., for transit searches) or to remove systematics while\npreserving variability (for variability studies). For periodic variables, K2SC\nautomatically computes estimates of the period, amplitude and evolution\ntimescale of the variability. We apply K2SC to publicly available K2 data from\ncampaigns 3--5, showing that we obtain photometric precision approaching that\nof the original Kepler mission. We compare our results to other publicly\navailable K2 pipelines, showing that we obtain similar or better results, on\naverage. We use transit injection and recovery tests to evaluate the impact of\nK2SC on planetary transit searches in K2 PDC (Pre-search Data Conditioning)\ndata, for planet-to-star radius ratios down Rp/Rstar = 0.01 and periods up to P\n= 40 d, and show that K2SC significantly improves the ability to distinguish\nbetween correct and false detections, particularly for small planets. K2SC can\nbe run automatically on many light curves, or manually tailored for specific\nobjects such as pulsating stars or large amplitude eclipsing binaries. It can\nbe run on ASCII and FITS light curve files, regardless of their origin. Both\nthe code and the processed light curves are publicly available, and we provide\ninstructions for downloading and using them. The methodology used by K2SC will\nbe applicable to future transit search missions such as TESS and PLATO.\n", "  There are no field brown dwarf analogs with measured masses, radii, and\nluminosities, precluding our ability to connect the population of transiting\nbrown dwarfs with measurable masses and radii and field brown dwarfs with\nmeasurable luminosities and atmospheric properties. LHS 6343 C, a\nweakly-irradiated brown dwarf transiting one member of an M+M binary in the\nKepler field, provides the first opportunity to probe the atmosphere of a\nnon-inflated brown dwarf with a measured mass and radius. Here, we analyze four\nSpitzer observations of secondary eclipses of LHS 6343 C behind LHS 6343 A.\nJointly fitting the eclipses with a Gaussian process noise model of the\ninstrumental systematics, we measure eclipse depths of 1.06 \\pm 0.21 ppt at 3.6\nmicrons and 2.09 \\pm 0.08 ppt at 4.5 microns, corresponding to brightness\ntemperatures of 1026 \\pm 57 K and 1249 \\pm 36 K, respectively. We then apply\nbrown dwarf evolutionary models to infer a bolometric luminosity log(L_star /\nL_sun) = -5.16 \\pm 0.04. Given the known physical properties of the brown dwarf\nand the two M dwarfs in the LHS 6343 C system, these depths are consistent with\nmodels of a 1100 K T dwarf at an age of 5 Gyr and empirical observations of\nfield T5-6 dwarfs with temperatures of 1070 \\pm 130 K. We investigate the\npossibility that the orbit of LHS 6343 C has been altered by the Kozai-Lidov\nmechanism and propose additional astrometric or Rossiter-McLaughlin\nmeasurements of the system to probe the dynamical history of the system.\n", "  In a previous paper, we studied the interior solution of a collapsing body in\na non-local theory of gravity super-renormalizable at the quantum level. We\nfound that the classical singularity is replaced by a bounce, after which the\nbody starts expanding. A black hole, strictly speaking, never forms. The\ngravitational collapse does not create an event horizon but only an apparent\none for a finite time. In this paper, we solve the equations of motion assuming\nthat the exterior solution is static. With such an assumption, we are able to\nreconstruct the solution in the whole spacetime, namely in both the exterior\nand interior regions. Now the gravitational collapse creates an event horizon\nin a finite comoving time, but the central singularity is approached in an\ninfinite time. We argue that these black holes should be unstable, providing a\nlink between the scenarios with and without black holes. Indeed, we find a non\ncatastrophic ghost-instability of the metric in the exterior region.\nInterestingly, under certain conditions, the lifetime of our black holes\nexactly scales as the Hawking evaporation time.\n", "  We use magnetohydrodynamical simulations of converging warm neutral medium\nflows to analyse the formation and global evolution of magnetised and turbulent\nmolecular clouds subject to supernova feedback from massive stars. We show that\nsupernova feedback alone fails to disrupt entire, gravitationally bound,\nmolecular clouds, but is able to disperse small--sized (~10 pc) regions on\ntimescales of less than 1 Myr. Efficient radiative cooling of the supernova\nremnant as well as strong compression of the surrounding gas result in\nnon-persistent energy and momentum input from the supernovae. However, if the\ntime between subsequent supernovae is short and they are clustered, large hot\nbubbles form that disperse larger regions of the parental cloud. On longer\ntimescales, supernova feedback increases the amount of gas with moderate\ntemperatures (T~300-3000 K). Despite its inability to disrupt molecular clouds,\nsupernova feedback leaves a strong imprint on the star formation process. We\nfind an overall reduction of the star formation efficiency by a factor of 2 and\nof the star formation rate by roughly factors of 2-4.\n", "  Extrasolar planets abound in almost any possible configuration. However,\nuntil five years ago, there was a lack of planets orbiting closer than 0.5 au\nto giant or subgiant stars. Since then, recent detections have started to\npopulated this regime by confirming 13 planetary systems. We discuss the\nproperties of these systems in terms of their formation and evolution off the\nmain sequence. Interestingly, we find that $70.0\\pm6.6$ % of the planets in\nthis regime are inner components of multiplanetary systems. This value is\n4.2$\\sigma$ higher than for main-sequence hosts, which we find to be\n$42.4\\pm0.1$ %. The properties of the known planets seem to indicate that the\nclosest-in planets (a < 0.06 au) to main-sequence stars are massive (i.e., hot\nJupiters) and isolated and that they are subsequently engulfed by their host as\nit evolves to the red giant branch, leaving only the predominant population of\nmultiplanetary systems in orbits 0.06 < a < 0.5 au. We discuss the implications\nof this emerging observational trend in the context of formation and evolution\nof hot Jupiters.\n", "  We obtained deep near-infrared images of Sh 2-208, one of the\nlowest-metallicity HII regions in the Galaxy, [O/H] = -0.8 dex. We detected a\nyoung cluster in the center of the HII region with a limiting magnitude of K =\n18.0 mag (10sigma), which corresponds to a mass detection limit of ~0.2 M_sun.\nThis enables the comparison of star-forming properties under low metallicity\nwith those of the solar neighborhood. We identified 89 cluster members. From\nthe fitting of the K-band luminosity function (KLF), the age and distance of\nthe cluster are estimated to be ~0.5 Myr and ~4 kpc, respectively. The\nestimated young age is consistent with the detection of strong CO emission in\nthe cluster region and the estimated large extinction of cluster members (Av ~\n4--25 mag). The observed KLF suggests that the underlying initial mass function\n(IMF) of the low-metallicity cluster is not significantly different from\ncanonical IMFs in the solar neighborhood in terms of both high-mass slope and\nIMF peak (characteristic mass). Despite the very young age, the disk fraction\nof the cluster is estimated at only 27pm6 %, which is significantly lower than\nthose in the solar metallicity. Those results are similar to Sh 2-207, which is\nanother low-metallicity star-forming region close to Sh 2-208 with a separation\nof 12 pc,suggesting that their star-forming activities in low-metallicity\nenvironments are essentially identical to those in the solar neighborhood,\nexcept for the disk dispersal timescale. From large-scale mid-infrared images,\nwe suggest that sequential star formation is taking place in Sh 2-207, Sh 2-208\nand the surrounding region, triggered by an expanding bubble with a ~30 pc\nradius.\n", "  G-band bright points (GBPs) are regarded as good manifestations of magnetic\nflux concentrations. We aim to investigate the relationship between the dynamic\nproperties of GBPs and their longitudinal magnetic field strengths. High\nspatial and temporal resolution observations were recorded simultaneously with\nG-band filtergrams and Narrow-band Filter Imager (NFI) Stokes I and V images\nwith Hinode /Solar Optical Telescope. The GBPs are identified and tracked in\nthe G-band images automatically, and the corresponding longitudinal magnetic\nfield strength of each GBP is extracted from the calibrated NFI magnetograms by\na point-to-point method. After categorizing the GBPs into five groups by their\nlongitudinal magnetic field strengths, we analyze the dynamics of GBPs of each\ngroup. The results suggest that with increasing longitudinal magnetic field\nstrengths of GBPs correspond to a decrease in their horizontal velocities and\nmotion ranges as well as by showing more complicated motion paths. This\nsuggests that magnetic elements showing weaker magnetic field strengths prefer\nto move faster and farther along straighter paths, while stronger ones move\nmore slowly in more erratic paths within a smaller region. The dynamic\nbehaviors of GBPs with different longitudinal magnetic field strengths can be\nexplained by that the stronger flux concentrations withstand the convective\nflows much better than weaker ones.\n", "  One of the central features of quantum theory is that there are pairs of\nquantum observables that cannot be measured simultaneously. This\nincompatibility of quantum observables is a necessary ingredient in several\nquantum phenomena, such as measurement uncertainty relations, violation of Bell\ninequalities and steering. Two quantum observables that admit a simultaneous\nmeasurement are, in this respect, classical. A finer classification of\nclassicality can be made by formulating four symmetric relations on the set of\nobservables that are stronger than compatibility; they are broadcastability,\none-side broadcastability, mutual nondisturbance and nondisturbance. It is\nproven that the five relations form a hierarchy, and their differences in terms\nof the required devices needed in a simultaneous measurement is explained. All\nthe four relations stronger than compatibility are completely characterized in\nthe case of qubit observables.\n", "  Decades ago two classes of gamma-ray bursts were identified and delineated as\nhaving durations shorter and longer than about 2 s. Subsequently indications\nalso supported the existence of a third class. Using maximum likelihood\nestimation we analyze the duration distribution of 888 Swift BAT bursts\nobserved before October 2015. Fitting three log-normal functions to the\nduration distribution of the bursts provides a better fit than two log-normal\ndistributions, with 99.9999% significance. Similarly to earlier results, we\nfound that a fourth component is not needed. The relative frequencies of the\ndistribution of the groups are 8% for short, 35% for intermediate and 57% for\nlong bursts which correspond to our previous results. We analyse the redshift\ndistribution for the 269 GRBs of the 888 GRBs with known redshift. We find no\nevidence for the previously suggested difference between the long and\nintermediate GRBs' redshift distribution. The observed redshift distribution of\nthe 20 short GRBs differs with high significance from the distributions of the\nother groups.\n", "  Many physical parameters in astrophysics are derived using the ratios of two\nobserved quantities. If the relative uncertainties on measurements are small\nenough, uncertainties can be propagated analytically using simplifying\nassumptions, but for large normally distributed uncertainties, the probability\ndistribution of the ratio become skewed, with a modal value offset from that\nexpected in Gaussian uncertainty propagation. Furthermore, the most likely\nvalue of a ratio A/B is not equal to the reciprocal of the most likely value of\nB/A. The effect is most pronounced when the uncertainty on the denominator is\nlarger than that on the numerator.\n  We show that this effect is seen in an analysis of 12,126 spectra from the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey. The intrinsically fixed ratio of the [O III] lines at\n4959 and 5007 ${\\AA}$ is conventionally expressed as the ratio of the stronger\nline to the weaker line. Thus, the uncertainty on the denominator is larger,\nand non-Gaussian probability distributions result. By taking this effect into\naccount, we derive an improved estimate of the intrinsic 5007/4959 ratio. We\nobtain a value of 3.012 $\\pm$ 0.008, which is slightly but statistically\nsignificantly higher than the theoretical value of 2.98.\n  We further investigate the suggestion that fluxes measured from emission\nlines at low signal to noise are strongly biased upwards. We were unable to\ndetect this effect in the SDSS line flux measurements, and we could not\nreproduce the results of Rola and Pelat who first described this bias. We\nsuggest that the magnitude of this effect may depend strongly on the specific\nfitting algorithm used.\n", "  Aims. Atomic diffusion, including the effect of radiative accelerations on\nindividual elements, leads to important variations of the chemical composition\ninside the stars. The accumulation in specific layers of the elements, which\nare the main contributors of the local opacity, leads to hydrodynamical\ninstabilities that modify the internal stellar structure and surface\nabundances. Our aim is to study these effects and compare the resulting surface\nabundances with spectroscopic observations Methods. We computed the detailed\nstructure of A-type stars including these effects. We used the Toulouse-Geneva\nEvolution Code (TGEC), where radiative accelerations are computed using the\nSingle Valued Parameter (SVP) method, and we added double-diffusive convection\nwith mixing coefficients deduced from three-dimensional (3D) simulations.\nResults. We show that the modification of the initial chemical composition has\nimportant effects on the internal stellar mixing and leads to different surface\nabundances of the elements. The results fit the observed surface chemical\ncomposition well if the layers, which are individually mixed by\ndouble-diffusive convection, are connected.\n", "  We construct a string-inspired model, motivated by the flavored Peccei-Quinn\n(PQ) axions, as a useful bridge between flavor physics and string theory. The\nkey feature is two anomalous gauged $U(1)$ symmetries, responsible for both the\nfermion mass hierarchy problem of the standard model and the strong CP problem,\nthat combine string theory with flavor physics and severely constrain the form\nof the F- and D-term contributions to the potential. In the context of\nsupersymmetric moduli stabilization we stabilize the size moduli with positive\nmasses while leaving two axions massless and one axion massive. We demonstrate\nthat, while the massive gauge bosons eat the two axionic degrees of freedom,\ntwo axionic directions survive to low energies as the flavored PQ axions.\n", "  (Abridged) Most stellar activity cycles similar to that found in the Sun have\nbeen detected by using the chromospheric Ca II H&K lines as stellar activity\nproxies. However, it is unclear if such activity cycles could be identified\nusing other optical lines. Aims. To detect activity cycles in solar-analog\nstars and determine if these can be identified through other optical lines,\nsuch as Fe II and Balmer lines. We study the solar-analog star HD 45184.\nMethods. We analyse the activity signatures of HD 45184 by using 291 HARPS\nspectra obtained between 2003 and 2014. In order to search for line-core fluxes\nvariations, we focus on Ca II H&K and Balmer H$\\alpha$, H$\\beta$ lines, which\nare usually used as optical chromospheric activity indicators. We calculate the\nHARPS-S index from Ca II H&K lines and convert it to the Mount-Wilson scale. In\naddition, we also consider as activity indicators the equivalent widths of\nBalmer lines. Moreover, we analyse the possible variability of Fe II and other\nmetallic lines in the optical spectra. Results. We report for the first time a\nlong-term 5.14-yr activity cycle in the solar-analog star HD 45184. This makes\nHD 45184 one of most similar stars to the Sun with known activity cycle. Such\nvariation is also evident in the first lines of the Balmer series, which not\nalways show a correlation with activity in solar-type stars. Notably, unlike\nthe solar case, we also found that the equivalent widths of the high\nphotospheric Fe II lines (4924 \\AA, 5018 {\\AA} and 5169 \\AA) are modulated\n($\\pm$ 2 m\\AA) by the chromospheric cycle of the star. From short-term\nmodulation of the S index we calculate a rotational period of 19.98 days, which\nagrees with its mean chromospheric activity level.\n", "  Quasars are associated with and powered by the accretion of material onto\nmassive black holes; the detection of highly luminous quasars with redshifts\ngreater than z = 6 suggests that black holes of up to ten billion solar masses\nalready existed 13 billion years ago. Two possible present-day dormant\ndescendants of this population of active black holes have been found in the\ngalaxies NGC 3842 and NGC 4889 at the centres of the Leo and Coma galaxy\nclusters, which together form the central region of the Great Wall - the\nlargest local structure of galaxies. The most luminous quasars, however, are\nnot confined to such high-density regions of the early Universe; yet dormant\nblack holes of this high mass have not yet been found outside of modern-day\nrich clusters. Here we report observations of the stellar velocity distribution\nin the galaxy NGC 1600 - a relatively isolated elliptical galaxy near the\ncentre of a galaxy group at a distance of 64 Mpc from Earth. We use orbit\nsuperposition models to determine that the black hole at the centre of NGC 1600\nhas a mass of 17 billion solar masses. The spatial distribution of stars near\nthe centre of NGC 1600 is rather diffuse. We find that the region of depleted\nstellar density in the cores of massive elliptical galaxies extends over the\nsame radius as the gravitational sphere of influence of the central black\nholes, and interpret this as the dynamical imprint of the black holes.\n", "  Solar post-flare loops (PFLs) are arcade-like loop systems that appear during\nthe gradual phases of eruptive flares. The extreme ultraviolet (EUV)\nobservations from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar\nDynamics Observatory (SDO) allow us to investigate the fine structures in PFLs.\nIn this work, we focus on studying the dark post-flare loops (DPFLs) during\nX-class flares, which are more evident in SDO/AIA data than in previous EUV\ndata. We identify and analyze the DPFLs observed by SDO and find that: (1) the\nDPFLs of an X5.4 flare have an average lifetime of 10.0 $\\pm$ 5.5 minutes, an\naverage width of 1022 $\\pm$ 339 km, and an average maximum length of 33 $\\pm$\n10 Mm, (2) blob-like falling features with a size close to the resolution of\nSDO/AIA are identified in the DPFLs and they have an average velocity of 76\n$\\pm$ 19 km s$^{-1}$, and (3) the average widths of the DPFLs slightly increase\nwith the characteristic temperatures in AIA 304, 171, 193, and 211 {\\AA}\nchannels. Our investigation shows that DPFLs are found in all of the 20 cases\nwithin this study, which suggests that they are a common phenomenon in X-class\nflares and are probably produced by the same mechanism that creates coronal\nrain.\n", "  We present results of our numerical simulation of three H2-bearing damped\nLyman alpha absorbers (DLAs) in the redshift interval ~ 2-3. The systems we\nhave modelled are the DLAs at zabs = 2.3377 towards the quasar LBQS 1232+0815,\nat zabs = 2.41837 towards SDSS J143912.04+111740.5 and at zabs = 2.6265 towards\nFBQS J081240.6+320808. We have used the spectral synthesis code CLOUDY to\nsimulate the physical environment of these DLAs, and constrain the density,\nradiation field, geometry and dust-grain properties of the DLAs\nself-consistently based on the observed column densities of various atomic and\nmolecular species such as H I, fine structure lines of C I and the rotational\nlevel population of H2. In our models, we explore the effect of grain size\ndistribution on the predicted column densities of different species. Within the\nallowed uncertainties in the inferred dust-to-gas ratio, both models with\nstandard ISM grains and smaller-sized grains reproduce the observations equally\nwell. Improved constraints on dust-to-gas ratio and line-of-sight extinction\nare important for probing the grain size distribution in high-z DLAs. We find\nthe H2-bearing clouds to have line-of-sight thickness in the range 1-6 pc,\nconsistent with what has been found using partial coverage or 21-cm\nobservations in some high-z DLAs.\n", "  CLEAN algorithms are a class of deconvolution solvers which are widely used\nto remove the effect of the telescope Point Spread Function (PSF). Loop gain is\none important parameter in CLEAN algorithms. Currently the parameter is fixed\nduring deconvolution, which restricts the performance of CLEAN algorithms. In\nthis paper, we propose a new deconvolution algorithm with an adaptive loop gain\nscheme, which is referred to as the adaptive-loop-gain adaptivescale CLEAN\n(Algas-Clean) algorithm. The test results show that the new algorithm can give\na more accurate model with faster convergence.\n", "  Evidence derived with minimal assumptions from existing published\nobservations is presented to show that an ion-proton plasma is the source of\nradio-frequency emission in millisecond and in normal isolated pulsars. There\nis no primary involvement of electron-positron pairs. This conclusion has also\nbeen reached by studies of the plasma composition based on well-established\nparticle-physics processes in neutron stars with positive polar-cap\ncorotational charge density. This work has been published in a series of papers\nwhich are also summarized here. It is now confirmed by simple analyses of the\nobserved radio-frequency characteristics, and its implications for the further\nstudy of neutron stars are outlined.\n", "  Dynamics of an open two-qubit system is investigated in the post-Markovian\nregime, where the environments have a short-term memory. Each qubit is coupled\nto separate environment which is held in its own temperature. The inter-qubit\ninteraction is modeled by XY-Heisenberg model in the presence of spin-orbit\ninteraction and inhomogeneous magnetic field. The dynamical behavior of\nentanglement and discord has been considered. The results show that, quantum\ndiscord is more robust than quantum entanglement, during the evolution. Also\nthe asymmetric feature of quantum discord can be monitored by introducing the\nasymmetries due to inhomogeneity of magnetic field and temperature difference\nbetween the reservoirs. By employing proper parameters of the model, it is\npossible to maintain non-vanishing quantum correlation at high degree of\ntemperature. The results can provide a useful recipe for studying of dynamical\nbehavior of two-qubit systems such as trapped spin-electrons in coupled quantum\ndots.\n", "  The discrete wave equation in a multidimensional uniform space with local\ndefects and sources is considered. The characterization of all possible defect\nconfigurations corresponding to given amplitudes of waves at the receivers\n(detectors) is provided.\n", "  We present the Lambda Adaptive Multi-Band Deblending Algorithm in R\n(LAMBDAR), a novel code for calculating matched aperture photometry across\nimages that are neither pixel- nor PSF-matched, using prior aperture\ndefinitions derived from high resolution optical imaging. The development of\nthis program is motivated by the desire for consistent photometry and\nuncertainties across large ranges of photometric imaging, for use in\ncalculating spectral energy distributions. We describe the program,\nspecifically key features required for robust determination of panchromatic\nphotometry: propagation of apertures to images with arbitrary resolution, local\nbackground estimation, aperture normalisation, uncertainty determination and\npropagation, and object deblending. Using simulated images, we demonstrate that\nthe program is able to recover accurate photometric measurements in both\nhigh-resolution, low-confusion, and low-resolution, high-confusion, regimes. We\napply the program to the 21-band photometric dataset from the Galaxy And Mass\nAssembly (GAMA) Panchromatic Data Release (PDR; Driver et al. 2016), which\ncontains imaging spanning the far-UV to the far-IR. We compare photometry\nderived from LAMBDAR with that presented in Driver et al. (2016), finding broad\nagreement between the datasets. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that the photometry\nfrom LAMBDAR is superior to that from the GAMA PDR, as determined by a\nreduction in the outlier rate and intrinsic scatter of colours in the LAMBDAR\ndataset. We similarly find a decrease in the outlier rate of stellar masses and\nstar formation rates using LAMBDAR photometry. Finally, we note an exceptional\nincrease in the number of UV and mid-IR sources able to be constrained, which\nis accompanied by a significant increase in the mid-IR colour-colour\nparameter-space able to be explored.\n", "  We report the $\\gamma$-ray detection of a young radio galaxy, PKS 1718$-$649,\nbelonging to the class of Compact Symmetric Objects (CSOs), with the Large Area\nTelescope (LAT) on board the {\\it Fermi} satellite. The third {\\it Fermi}\nGamma-ray LAT catalog (3FGL) includes an unassociated $\\gamma$-ray source, 3FGL\nJ1728.0$-$6446, located close to PKS 1718$-$649. Using the latest Pass 8\ncalibration, we confirm that the best fit $1 \\sigma$ position of the\n$\\gamma$-ray source is compatible with the radio location of PKS 1718$-$649.\nCross-matching of the $\\gamma$-ray source position with the positions of blazar\nsources from several catalogs yields negative results. Thus, we conclude that\nPKS 1718$-$649 is the most likely counterpart to the unassociated LAT source.\nWe obtain a detection test statistics TS$\\sim 36$ ($>$5$\\sigma$) with a best\nfit photon spectral index $\\Gamma=$2.9$\\pm$0.3 and a 0.1-100 GeV photon flux\ndensity $F_{\\rm 0.1-100GeV}=$(11.5$\\pm$0.3)$\\times{\\rm 10^{-9}}$ ph cm$^{-2}$\ns$^{-1}$. We argue that the linear size ($\\sim$2 pc), the kinematic age\n($\\sim$100 years), and the source distance ($z=0.014$) make PKS 1718$-$649 an\nideal candidate for $\\gamma$-ray detection in the framework of the model\nproposing that the most compact and the youngest CSOs can efficiently produce\nGeV radiation via inverse-Compton scattering of the ambient photon fields by\nthe radio lobe non-thermal electrons. Thus, our detection of the source in\n$\\gamma$-rays establishes young radio galaxies as a distinct class of\nextragalactic high-energy emitters, and yields an unique insight on the\nphysical conditions in compact radio lobes interacting with the interstellar\nmedium of the host galaxy.\n", "  An updated set of (anti)neutrino-nucleon charged and neutral current cross\nsections at $3~{\\rm GeV} \\lesssim E_\\nu \\lesssim 100~{\\rm GeV}$ is presented.\nThese cross sections are of particular interest for the detector optimization\nand data processing and interpretation in the future Megaton-scale experiments\nlike PINGU, ORCA, and Hyper-Kamiokande. Finite masses of charged leptons and\ntarget mass corrections in exclusive and deep inelastic $(\\bar\\nu)\\nu N$\ninteractions are taken into account. A new set of QCD NNLO parton density\nfunctions, the ABMP15, is used for calculation of the DIS cross sections. The\nsensitivity of the cross sections to phenomenological parameters and to\nextrapolations of the nucleon structure functions to small $x$ and $Q^2$ is\nstudied. An agreement within the uncertainties of our calculations with\nexperimental data is demonstrated.\n", "  We present new results on the auto- and cross-correlation functions of\ngalaxies and OVI absorbers in a $\\sim 18~\\textrm{Gpc}^3$ comoving volume at $z\n< 1$. We use a sample of 51,296 galaxies and 140 OVI absorbers in the column\ndensity range $13 \\lesssim \\log N \\lesssim 15$ to measure two-point correlation\nfunctions in the two dimensions transverse and orthogonal to the line-of-sight\n$\\xi(r_{\\perp}, r_{\\parallel})$. We furthermore infer the corresponding\n'real-space' correlation functions, $\\xi(r)$, by projecting $\\xi(r_{\\perp},\nr_{\\parallel})$ along $r_{\\parallel}$, and assuming a power-law form, $\\xi(r) =\n(r / r_0)^{-\\gamma}$. Comparing the results from the absorber-galaxy\ncross-correlation function, $\\xi_{\\textrm{ag}}$, the galaxy auto-correlation\nfunction, $\\xi_{\\textrm{gg}}$, and the absorber auto-correlation function,\n$\\xi_{\\textrm{aa}}$, we constrain the statistical connection between galaxies\nand the metal-enriched intergalactic medium as a function of star-formation\nactivity. We also compare these results to predictions from the EAGLE\ncosmological hydrodynamical simulation and find a reasonable agreement. We find\nthat: (i) OVI absorbers show very little velocity dispersion with respect to\ngalaxies on $\\sim$ Mpc scales, likely $\\lesssim$ 100 \\kms; (ii) OVI absorbers\nand galaxies may not linearly trace the same underlying distribution of matter\nin general. In particular, our results demonstrate that OVI absorbers are less\nclustered, and potentially more extended around galaxies than galaxies are\naround themselves; (iii) On $\\gtrsim 100$ kpc scales, the likelihood of finding\nOVI absorbers around star-forming galaxies is similar to the likelihood of\nfinding OVI absorbers around non star-forming galaxies (abridged)\n", "  Non-radial pulsations have been identified in a number of accreting white\ndwarfs in cataclysmic variables. These stars offer insight into the excitation\nof pulsation modes in atmospheres with mixed compositions of hydrogen, helium,\nand metals, and the response of these modes to changes in the white dwarf\ntemperature. Among all pulsating cataclysmic variable white dwarfs, GW Librae\nstands out by having a well-established observational record of three\nindependent pulsation modes that disappeared when the white dwarf temperature\nrose dramatically following its 2007 accretion outburst. Our analysis of HST\nultraviolet spectroscopy taken in 2002, 2010 and 2011, showed that pulsations\nproduce variations in the white dwarf effective temperature as predicted by\ntheory. Additionally in May~2013, we obtained new HST/COS ultraviolet\nobservations that displayed unexpected behaviour: besides showing variability\nat ~275s, which is close to the post-outburst pulsations detected with HST in\n2010 and 2011, the white dwarf exhibits high-amplitude variability on a ~4.4h\ntime-scale. We demonstrate that this variability is produced by an increase of\nthe temperature of a region on white dwarf covering up to ~30 per cent of the\nvisible white dwarf surface. We argue against a short-lived accretion episode\nas the explanation of such heating, and discuss this event in the context of\nnon-radial pulsations on a rapidly rotating star\n", "  $\\kappa$ Andromedae, an early type star that hosts a directly imaged low mass\ncompanion, is expected to be oblate due to its rapid rotational velocity\n($v\\sin i$ = $\\sim$162 $\\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$). We observed the star with the\nCHARA Array's optical beam combiner, PAVO, measuring its size at multiple\norientations and determining its oblateness. The interferometric measurements,\ncombined with photometry and this $v\\sin i$ value are used to constrain an\noblate star model that yields the fundamental properties of the star and finds\na rotation speed that is $\\sim$85\\% of the critical rate and a low inclination\nof $\\sim$30$^\\circ$. Three modeled properties (the average radius, bolometric\nluminosity, and equatorial velocity) are compared to MESA evolution models to\ndetermine an age and mass for the star. In doing so, we determine an age for\nthe system of 47$^{+27}_{-40}$ Myr. Based on this age and previous measurements\nof the companion's temperature, the BHAC15 evolution models imply a mass for\nthe companion of 22$^{+8}_{-9}$ M$_\\mathrm{J}$.\n", "  We present a theoretical model for the evolution of mass, angular momentum\nand size of galaxy disks and bulges, and we implement it into the semi-analytic\ngalaxy formation code SAGE. The model follows both secular and violent\nevolutionary channels, including smooth accretion, disk instabilities, minor\nand major mergers. We find that the combination of our recipe with hierarchical\nclustering produces two distinct populations of bulges: merger-driven bulges,\nakin to classical bulges and ellipticals, and instability-driven bulges, akin\nto secular (or pseudo-)bulges. The model mostly reproduces the mass-size\nrelation of gaseous and stellar disks, the evolution of the mass-size relation\nof ellipticals, the Faber-Jackson relation, and the magnitude-colour diagram of\nclassical and secular bulges. The model predicts only a small overlap of\nmerger-driven and instability-driven components in the same galaxy, and\npredicts different bulge types as a function of galaxy mass and disk fraction.\nBulge type also affects the star formation rate and colour at a given\nluminosity. The model predicts a population of merger-driven red ellipticals\nthat dominate both the low-mass and high-mass ends of the galaxy population,\nand span all dynamical ages; merger-driven bulges in disk galaxies are\ndynamically old and do not interfere with subsequent evolution of the\nstar-forming component. Instability-driven bulges dominate the population at\nintermediate galaxy masses, especially thriving in massive disks. The model\ngreen valley is exclusively populated by instability-driven bulge hosts.\nThrough the present implementation the mass accretion history is perceivable in\nthe galaxy structure, morphology and colours.\n", "  We report three-minute oscillations in the solar chromosphere driven by a\nstrong downflow event in a sunspot. We used the Fast Imaging Solar Spectrograph\nof the 1.6 m New Solar Telescope and the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph\n(IRIS). The strong downflow event is identified in the chromospheric and\ntransition region lines above the sunspot umbra. After the event, oscillations\noccur at the same region. The amplitude of the Doppler velocity oscillations is\n2 km/s, and gradually decreases with time. In addition, the period of the\noscillations gradually increases from 2.7 minutes to 3.3 minutes. In the IRIS\n1330 slit-jaw images, we identify a transient brightening near the footpoint of\nthe downflow detected in the Ha+0.5A image. The characteristics of the\ndownflowing material are consistent with those of sunspot plumes. Based on our\nfindings, we suggest that the gravitationally stratified atmosphere came to\noscillate with three minute period in response to the impulsive downflow event\nas was theoretically investigated by Chae & Goode(2015).\n", "  We report the discovery of 2 new Be stars, and re-identify one known Be star\nin the open cluster NGC 6830. Eleven H-alpha emitters were discovered using the\nH-alpha imaging photometry of the Palomar Transient Factory Survey. Stellar\nmembership of the candidates was verified with photometric and kinematic\ninformation using 2MASS data and proper motions. The spectroscopic confirmation\nwas carried out by using the Shane 3-m telescope at Lick observatory. Based on\ntheir spectral types, three H-alpha emitters were confirmed as Be stars with\nH-alpha equivalent widths > -10 Angstrom. Two objects were also observed by the\nnew spectrograph SED-Machine on the Palomar 60 inch Telescope. The SED-Machine\nresults show strong H-alpha emission lines, which are consistent with the\nresults of the Lick observations. The high efficiency of the SED-Machine can\nprovide rapid observations for Be stars in a comprehensive survey in the\nfuture.\n", "  We present a primary transit observation for the ultra hot (Teq~2400K) gas\ngiant expolanet WASP-121b, made using the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field\nCamera 3 in spectroscopic mode across the 1.12-1.64 micron wavelength range.\nThe 1.4 micron water absorption band is detected at high confidence (5.4 sigma)\nin the planetary atmosphere. We also reanalyze ground-based photometric\nlightcurves taken in the B, r', and z' filters. Significantly deeper transits\nare measured in these optical bandpasses relative to the near-infrared\nwavelengths. We conclude that scattering by high-altitude haze alone is\nunlikely to account for this difference, and instead interpret it as evidence\nfor titanium oxide and vanadium oxide absorption. Enhanced opacity is also\ninferred across the 1.12-1.3 micron wavelength range, possibly due to iron\nhydride absorption. If confirmed, WASP-121b will be the first exoplanet with\ntitanium oxide, vanadium oxide, and iron hydride detected in transmission. The\nlatter are important species in M/L dwarfs, and their presence is likely to\nhave a significant effect on the overall physics and chemistry of the\natmosphere, including the production of a strong thermal inversion.\n", "  We introduce a universal sparse preconditioner that accelerates geometry\noptimisation and saddle point search tasks that are common in the atomic scale\nsimulation of materials. Our preconditioner is based on the neighbourhood\nstructure and we demonstrate the gain in computational efficiency in a wide\nrange of materials that include metals, insulators and molecular solids. The\nsimple structure of the preconditioner means that the gains can be realised in\npractice not only when using expensive electronic structure models but also for\nfast empirical potentials. Even for relatively small systems of a few hundred\natoms, we observe speedups of a factor of two or more, and the gain grows with\nsystem size. An open source Python implementation within the Atomic Simulation\nEnvironment is available, offering interfaces to a wide range of atomistic\ncodes.\n", "  Pulsars show two classes of rotational irregularities that can be used to\nunderstand neutron-star interiors and magnetospheres: glitches and timing\nnoise. Here we present an analysis of the Vela pulsar spanning nearly 21 yr of\nobservation and including 8 glitches. We identify the relative pulse number of\nall of the observations between glitches, with the only pulse-number\nambiguities existing over glitch events. We use the phase coherence of the\ntiming solution to simultaneously model the timing noise and glitches in a\nBayesian framework, allowing us to select preferred models for both. We find\nthe glitches can be described using only permanent and transient changes in\nspin frequency, i.e., no step changes in frequency derivative. For all of the\nglitches, we only need two exponentially decaying changes in spin frequency to\nmodel the transient components. In contrast to previous studies, we find that\nthe dominant transient components decay on a common $\\approx$ 1300 d time\nscale, and that a larger fraction ( $\\gtrsim 25\\%$) of glitch amplitudes are\nassociated with these transient components. We also detect shorter-duration\ntransient components of $\\approx$ 25 d, as previously observed, but are limited\nin sensitivity to events with shorter durations by the cadence of our\nobservations. The timing noise is well described by a steep power-law process\nthat is independent of the glitches and subdominant to the glitch recovery. The\nbraking index is constrained to be $<$ 8 with 95% confidence. This methodology\ncan be used to robustly measure the properties of glitches and timing noise in\nother pulsars.\n", "  The $^3$He isotope is important to many fields of astrophysics, including\nstellar evolution, chemical evolution, and cosmology. The isotope is produced\nin low-mass stars which evolve through the planetary nebula (PN) phase. $^3$He\nabundances in PNe can help test models of the chemical evolution of the Galaxy.\nWe present the detection of the $^3$He$^+$ emission line using the single dish\nDeep Space Station 63, towards the PN IC$\\,$418. We derived a $^3$He/H\nabundance in the range 1.74$\\pm$0.8$\\times$10$^{-3}$ to\n5.8$\\pm$1.7$\\times$10$^{-3}$, depending on whether part of the line arises in\nan outer ionized halo. The lower value for $^3$He/H ratio approaches values\npredicted by stellar models which include thermohaline mixing, but requires\nthat large amounts of $^3$He are produced inside low-mass stars which enrich\nthe interstellar medium (ISM). However, this over-predicts the $^3$He abundance\nin HII regions, the ISM, and proto-solar grains, which is known to be of the\norder of 10$^{-5}$. This discrepancy questions our understanding of the\nevolution of the $^3$He, from circumstellar environments to the ISM.\n", "  Any physical system considered to study the QCD deconfinement phase\ntransition certainly has a finite volume, so the finite size effects are\ninevitably present. This renders the location of the phase transition and the\ndetermination of its order as an extremely difficult task, even in the simplest\nknown cases. In order to identify and locate the colorless QCD deconfinement\ntransition point in finite volume $T_{0}(V)$, a new approach based on the\nfinite-size cumulant expansion of the order parameter and the\n$\\mathscr{L}_{m,n}$-Method is used.We have shown that both cumulants of higher\norder and their ratios, associated to the thermodynamical fluctuations of the\norder parameter, in QCD deconfinement phase transition behave in a particular\nenough way revealing pronounced oscillations in the transition region. The sign\nstructure and the oscillatory behavior of these in the vicinity of the\ndeconfinement phase transition point might be a sensitive probe and may allow\none to elucidate their relation to the QCD phase transition point. In the\ncontext of our model, we have shown that the finite volume transition point is\nalways associated to the appearance of a particular point in whole higher order\ncumulants under consideration.\n", "  We embark on a study of quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) in the decay phase\nof white-light stellar flares observed by Kepler. Out of the 1439 flares on 216\ndifferent stars detected in the short-cadence data using an automated search,\n56 flares are found to have pronounced QPP-like signatures in the light curve,\nof which 11 have stable decaying oscillations. No correlation is found between\nthe QPP period and the stellar temperature, radius, rotation period and surface\ngravity, suggesting that the QPPs are independent of global stellar parameters.\nHence they are likely to be the result of processes occurring in the local\nenvironment. There is also no significant correlation between the QPP period\nand flare energy, however there is evidence that the period scales with the QPP\ndecay time for the Gaussian damping scenario, but not to a significant degree\nfor the exponentially damped case. This same scaling has been observed for MHD\noscillations on the Sun, suggesting that they could be the cause of the QPPs in\nthose flares. Scaling laws of the flare energy are also investigated,\nsupporting previous reports of a strong correlation between the flare energy\nand stellar temperature/radius. A negative correlation between the flare energy\nand stellar surface gravity is also found.\n", "  In this paper we present an homogeneous analysis of photospheric abundances\nbased on high-resolution spectroscopy of a sample of 182 barium stars and\ncandidates. We determined atmospheric parameters, spectroscopic distances,\nstellar masses, ages, luminosities and scale height, radial velocities,\nabundances of the Na, Al, $alpha$-elements, iron-peak elements, and s-process\nelements Y, Zr, La, Ce, and Nd. We employed the local-thermodynamic-equilibrium\nmodel atmospheres of Kurucz and the spectral analysis code {\\sc moog}. We found\nthat the metallicities, the temperatures and the surface gravities for barium\nstars can not be represented by a single gaussian distribution. The abundances\nof $alpha$-elements and iron peak elements are similar to those of field giants\nwith the same metallicity. Sodium presents some degree of enrichment in more\nevolved stars that could be attributed to the NeNa cycle. As expected, the\nbarium stars show overabundance of the elements created by the s-process. By\nmeasuring the mean heavy-element abundance pattern as given by the ratio\n[s/Fe], we found that the barium stars present several degrees of enrichment.\nWe also obtained the [hs/ls] ratio by measuring the photospheric abundances of\nthe Ba-peak and the Zr-peak elements. Our results indicated that the [s/Fe] and\nthe [hs/ls] ratios are strongly anti-correlated with the metallicity. Our\nkinematical analysis showed that 90% of the barium stars belong to the thin\ndisk population. Based on their luminosities, none of the barium stars are\nluminous enough to be an AGB star, nor to become self-enriched in the s-process\nelements. Finally, we determined that the barium stars also follow an\nage-metallicity relation.\n", "  Molecules with hyperfine splitting of their rotational line spectra are\nuseful probes of optical depth, via the relative line strengths of their\nhyperfine components.The hyperfine splitting is particularly advantageous in\ninterpreting the physical conditions of the emitting gas because with a second\nrotational transition, both gas density and temperature can be derived. For HCN\nhowever, the relative strengths of the hyperfine lines are anomalous. They\nappear in ratios which can vary significantly from source to source, and are\ninconsistent with local thermodynamic equilibrium. This is the HCN hyperfine\nanomaly, and it prevents the use of simple LTE models of HCN emission to derive\nreliable optical depths. In this paper we demonstrate how to model HCN\nhyperfine line emission, and derive accurate line ratios, spectral line shapes\nand optical depths. We show that by carrying out radiative transfer\ncalculations over each hyperfine level individually, as opposed to summing them\nover each rotational level, the anomalous hyperfine emission emerges naturally.\nTo do this requires not only accurate radiative rates between hyperfine states,\nbut also accurate collisional rates. We investigate the effects of different\nsets of hyperfine collisional rates, derived via the 'proportional method' and\nthrough direct recoupling calculations. Through an extensive parameter sweep\nover typical low mass star forming conditions, we show the HCN line ratios to\nbe highly variable to optical depth. We also reproduce an observed effect\nwhereby the red-blue asymmetry of the hyperfine lines (an infall signature)\nswitches sense within a single rotational transition.\n", "  Stellar activity and rotation frustrate the detection of exoplanets through\nthe radial velocity technique. This effect is particularly of concern for M\ndwarfs, which can remain magnetically active for billions of years. We compile\nrotation periods for late-type stars and for the M dwarf planet-host sample in\norder to investigate the rotation periods of older field stars across the main\nsequence. We show that for stars with masses between 0.25 and 0.5 solar masses\n(M4V to M1V), the stellar rotation period typical of field stars coincides with\nthe orbital periods of planets in the habitable zone. This will pose a\nfundamental challenge to the discovery and characterization of potentially\nhabitable planets around early M dwarfs. Due to the longer rotation periods\nreached by mid M dwarfs and the shorter orbital period at which the planetary\nhabitable zone is found, stars with masses between 0.1 and 0.25 solar masses\n(M6V to M4V) offer better opportunities for the detection of habitable planets\nvia radial velocities.\n", "  Future generations of precise radial velocity (RV) surveys aim to achieve\nsensitivity sufficient to detect Earth mass planets orbiting in their stars'\nhabitable zones. A major obstacle to this goal is astrophysical radial velocity\nnoise caused by active areas moving across the stellar limb as a star rotates.\nIn this paper, we quantify how stellar activity impacts exoplanet detection\nwith radial velocities as a function of orbital and stellar rotational periods.\nWe perform data-driven simulations of how stellar rotation affects planet\ndetectability and compile and present relations for the typical timescale and\namplitude of stellar radial velocity noise as a function of stellar mass. We\nshow that the characteristic timescales of quasi-periodic radial velocity\njitter from stellar rotational modulations coincides with the orbital period of\nhabitable zone exoplanets around early M-dwarfs. These coincident periods\nunderscore the importance of monitoring the targets of RV habitable zone planet\nsurveys through simultaneous photometric measurements for determining rotation\nperiods and activity signals, and mitigating activity signals using\nspectroscopic indicators and/or RV measurements at different wavelengths.\n", "  The $\\Lambda$CDM cosmological model successfully reproduces many aspects of\nthe galaxy and structure formation of the universe. However, the growth of\nlarge-scale structures (LSSs) in the early universe is not well tested yet with\nobservational data. Here, we have utilized wide and deep optical--near-infrared\ndata in order to search for distant galaxy clusters and superclusters\n($0.8<z<1.2$). From the spectroscopic observation with the Inamori Magellan\nAreal Camera and Spectrograph (IMACS) on the Magellan telescope, three massive\nclusters at $z\\sim$0.91 are confirmed in the SSA22 field. Interestingly, all of\nthem have similar redshifts within $\\Delta z\\sim$0.01 with velocity dispersions\nranging from 470 to 1300 km s$^{-1}$. Moreover, as the maximum separation is\n$\\sim$15 Mpc, they compose a supercluster at $z\\sim$0.91, meaning that this is\none of the most massive superclusters at this redshift to date. The galaxy\ndensity map implies that the confirmed clusters are embedded in a larger\nstructure stretching over $\\sim$100 Mpc. $\\Lambda$CDM models predict about one\nsupercluster like this in our surveyed volume, consistent with our finding so\nfar. However, there are more supercluster candidates in this field, suggesting\nthat additional studies are required to determine if the $\\Lambda$CDM\ncosmological model can successfully reproduce the LSSs at high redshift.\n", "  We explore the gas dynamics near the dust sublimation radius of active\ngalactic nucleus (AGN). For the purpose, we perform axisymmetric radiation\nhydrodynamic simulations of a dusty gas disk of radius $\\approx 1\\,\\mathrm{pc}$\naround a supermassive black hole of mass $10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$ taking\ninto account (1) anisotropic radiation of accretion disk, (2) X-ray heating by\ncorona, (3) radiative transfer of infrared (IR) photons reemitted by dust, (4)\nfrequency dependency of direct and IR radiations, and (5) separate temperatures\nfor gas and dust. As a result, we find that for Eddington ratio $\\approx 0.77$,\na nearly neutral, dense ($\\approx 10^{6\\operatorname{-}8}\\;\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$),\ngeometrically-thin ($h/r<0.06$) disk forms with a high velocity ($\\approx 200\n\\sim 3000\\;\\mathrm{km/s}$) dusty outflow launched from the disk surface. The\ndisk temperature is determined by the balance between X-ray heating and various\ncooling, and the disk is almost supported by thermal pressure. Contrary to\n\\citet{krolik07:_agn}, the radiation pressure by IR photons is not effective to\nthicken the disk, but rather compresses it. Thus, it seems difficult for a\nradiation-supported, geometrically-thick, obscuring torus to form near the dust\nsublimation radius as far as the Eddington ratio is high ($\\sim 1$). The mass\noutflow rate is $0.05$-$0.1\\;\\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}/\\mathrm{yr}$ and the column\ndensity of the outflow is $N_{\\mathrm{H}}\\lesssim 10^{21}\\;\\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$.\nTo explain observed type-II AGN fraction, it is required that outflow gas is\nextended to larger radii ($r\\gtrsim 10\\;\\mathrm{pc}$) or that a denser dusty\nwind is launched from smaller radii ($r\\sim 10^{4}\\;R_{g}$).\n", "  We present X-ray spectral variability of 24 local active galactic nuclei\n(AGN) from the Palomar sample of nearby galaxies, as observed mainly by Swift.\nFrom hardness ratio measurements, we find that 18 AGN with low accretion rates\nshow hardening with increasing count rate, converse to the softer-when-brighter\nbehaviour normally observed in AGN with higher accretion rates. Two AGN show\nsoftening with increasing count rate, two show more complex behaviour, and two\ndo not show any simple relationship.\n  Sufficient data were available for the spectra of 13 AGN to be summed in\nflux-bins. In 9 of these sources, correlated luminosity-dependent changes in\nthe photon index ($\\Gamma$) of a power-law component are found to be the main\ncause of hardness variability. For 6 objects, with a low accretion rate as a\nfraction of the Eddington rate (\\.m$\\mathrm{_{Edd}}$), $\\Gamma$ is\nanticorrelated with \\.m$\\mathrm{_{Edd}}$, i.e. `harder-when-brighter' behaviour\nis observed. The 3 higher-\\.m$\\mathrm{_{Edd}}$-rate objects show a positive\ncorrelation between $\\Gamma$ and \\.m$\\mathrm{_{Edd}}$. This transition from\nharder-when-brighter at low \\.m$\\mathrm{_{Edd}}$s to softer-when-brighter at\nhigh \\.m$\\mathrm{_{Edd}}$s can be explained by a change in the dominant source\nof seed-photons for X-ray emission from cyclo-synchrotron emission from the\nComptonising corona itself to thermal seed-photons from the accretion disc.\nThis transition is also seen in the `hard state' of black hole X-ray binaries\n(BHXRBs). The results support the idea that LINERs are analogues of BHXRBs in\nthe hard state and that Seyferts are analogues of BHXRBs in either the\nhigh-accretion-rate end of the hard state or in the hard-intermediate state.\n", "  The runaway collision scenario is one of the most promising mechanisms to\nexplain the formation of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) in young dense\nstar clusters. On the other hand, the massive stars that participate in the\nrunaway collisions lose mass by stellar winds. In this paper, we discuss new\nN-body simulations of massive (6.5x10^4 Msun) star clusters, in which we added\nupgraded recipes for stellar winds and supernova explosion at different\nmetallicity. We follow the evolution of the principal collision product (PCP),\nthrough dynamics and stellar evolution, till it forms a stellar remnant. At\nsolar metallicity, the mass of the final merger product spans from few solar\nmasses up to ~30 Msun. At low metallicity (0.01-0.1 Zsun) the maximum remnant\nmass is ~250 Msun, in the range of IMBHs. A large fraction (~0.6) of the PCPs\nare not ejected from the parent star cluster and acquire stellar or black hole\n(BH) companions. Most of the long-lived binaries hosting a PCP are BH-BH\nbinaries. We discuss the importance of this result for gravitational wave\ndetection.\n", "  IGR J14091-6108 is a Galactic X-ray source known to have an iron emission\nline, a hard X-ray spectrum, and an optical counterpart. Here, we report on\nX-ray observations of the source with XMM-Newton and NuSTAR as well as optical\nspectroscopy with ESO/VLT and NOAO/SOAR. In the X-rays, this provides data with\nmuch better statistical quality than the previous observations, and this is the\nfirst report of the optical spectrum. Timing analysis of the XMM data shows a\nvery significant detection of 576.3+/-0.6 s period. The signal has a pulsed\nfraction of 30%+/-3% in the 0.3-12 keV range and shows a strong drop with\nenergy. The optical spectra show strong emission lines with significant\nvariability in the lines and continuum, indicating that they come from an\nirradiated accretion disk. Based on these measurements, we identify the source\nas a magnetic Cataclysmic Variable of Intermediate Polar (IP) type where the\nwhite dwarf spin period is 576.3 s. The X-ray spectrum is consistent with the\ncontinuum emission mechanism being due to thermal Bremsstrahlung, but partial\ncovering absorption and reflection are also required. In addition, we use the\nIP mass (IPM) model, which suggests that the white dwarf in this system has a\nhigh mass, possibly approaching the Chandrasekhar limit.\n", "  Pulsar electrodynamics is reviewed emphasizing the role of the inductive\nelectric field in an oblique rotator and the incomplete screening of its\nparallel component by charges, leaving `gaps' with $E_\\parallel\\ne0$. The\nresponse of the plasma leads to a self-consistent electric field that\ncomplements the inductive electric field with a potential field leading to an\nelectric drift and a polarization current associated with the total field. The\nelectrodynamic models determine the charge density, $\\rho$, and the current\ndensity, ${\\bf J}$, charge starvation refers to situations where the plasma\ncannot supply $\\rho$, resulting in a gap and associated particle acceleration\nand pair creation. It is pointed out that a form of current starvation also\noccurs implying a new class of gaps. The properties of gaps are discussed,\nemphasizing that static models are unstable, the role of large-amplitude\nlongitudinal waves, and the azimuthal dependence that arises across a gap in an\noblique rotator. Wave dispersion in a pulsar plasma is reviewed briefly,\nemphasizing its role in radio emission. Pulsar radio emission mechanisms are\nreviewed, and it is suggested that the most plausible is a form of plasma\nemission.\n", "  We report the detection of a wing component in NH$_3$ emission toward the\nstarless core TUKH122 with subthermal turbulence in the Orion A cloud. This\nNH$_3$ core is suggested to be on the verge of star formation because the\nturbulence inside the NH$_3$ core is almost completely dissipated, and also\nbecause it is surrounded by CCS, which resembles the prestellar core L1544 in\nTaurus showing infall motions. Observations were carried out with the Nobeyama\n45 m telescope at 0.05 km s$^{-1}$ velocity resolution. We find that the NH$_3$\nline profile consists of two components. The quiescent main component has a\nsmall linewidth of 0.3 km s$^{-1}$ dominated by thermal motions, and the\nred-shifted wing component has a large linewidth of 1.36 km s$^{-1}$\nrepresenting turbulent motions. These components show kinetic temperatures of\n11 K and $<$ 30 K, respectively. Furthermore, there is a clear velocity offset\nbetween the NH$_3$ quiescent gas ($VLSR=3.7$ km s$^{-1}$) and the turbulent gas\n($VLSR=4.4$ km s$^{-1}$). The centroid velocity of the turbulent gas\ncorresponds to that of the surrounding gas traced by the $^{13}$CO ($J=1-0$)\nand CS ($J=2-1$) lines. LVG model calculations for CS and CO show that the\nturbulent gas has a temperature of $8-13$ K and an H$_2$ density of ~ $10^4$\ncm$^{-3}$, suggesting that the temperature of the turbulent component is also ~\n10 K. The detections of both NH$_3$ quiescent and wing components may indicate\na sharp transition from the turbulent parent cloud to the quiescent dense core.\n", "  This paper reports on the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectrum of three low\nredshift ($z \\sim 0.6$) radio loud quasars, 3C 95, 3C 57 and PKS 0405-123. The\nspectra were obtained with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) of the Hubble\nSpace Telescope. The bolometric thermal emission, $L_{bol}$, associated with\nthe accretion flow is a large fraction of the Eddington limit for all of these\nsources. We estimate the long term time averaged jet power, $\\overline{Q}$, for\nthe three sources. $\\overline{Q}/L_{bol}$, is shown to lie along the\ncorrelation of $\\overline{Q}/L_{bol}$ and $\\alpha_{EUV}$ found in previous\nstudies of the EUV continuum of intermediate and high redshift quasars, where\nthe EUV continuum flux density between 1100 \\AA\\, and 700 \\AA\\, is defined by\n$F_{\\nu} \\sim \\nu^{-\\alpha_{EUV}}$. The high Eddington ratios of the three\nquasars extends the analysis into a wider parameter space. Selecting quasars\nwith high Eddington ratios has accentuated the statistical significance of the\npartial correlation analysis of the data. Namely. the correlation of\n$\\overline{Q}/L_{\\mathrm{bol}}$ and $\\alpha_{EUV}$ is fundamental and the\ncorrelation of $\\overline{Q}$ and $\\alpha_{EUV}$ is spurious at a very high\nstatistical significance level (99.8\\%). This supports the regulating role of\nram pressure of the accretion flow in magnetically arrested accretion models of\njet production. In the process of this study, we use multi-frequency and\nmulti-resolution Very Large Array radio observations to determine that one of\nthe bipolar jets in 3C 57 is likely frustrated by galactic gas that keeps the\njet from propagating outside the host galaxy.\n", "  A new method to study the intrinsic color and luminosity of type Ia\nsupernovae (SNe Ia) is presented. A metric space built using principal\ncomponent analysis (PCA) on spectral series SNe Ia between -12.5 and +17.5 days\nfrom B maximum is used as a set of predictors. This metric space is built to be\ninsensitive to reddening. Hence, it does not predict the part of color excess\ndue to dust-extinction. At the same time, the rich variability of SN Ia spectra\nis a good predictor of a large fraction of the intrinsic color variability.\nSuch metric space is a good predictor of the epoch when the maximum in the B-V\ncolor curve is reached. Multivariate Partial Least Square (PLS) regression\npredicts the intrinsic B band light-curve and the intrinsic B-V color curve up\nto a month after maximum. This allows to study the relation between the light\ncurves of SNe Ia and their spectra. The total-to-selective extinction ratio RV\nin the host-galaxy of SNe Ia is found, on average, to be consistent with\ntypical Milky-Way values. This analysis shows the importance of collecting\nspectra to study SNe Ia, even with large sample publicly available. Future\nautomated surveys as LSST will provide a large number of light curves. The\nanalysis shows that observing accompaning spectra for a significative number of\nSNe will be important even in the case of \"normal\" SNe Ia.\n", "  In this paper, we report the results of spectroscopic and photometric\nobservations of the candidate evolved massive star MN48 disclosed via detection\nof a mid-infrared circular shell around it with the Spitzer Space Telescope.\nFollow-up optical spectroscopy of MN48 with the Southern African Large\nTelescope (SALT) carried out in 2011--2015 revealed significant changes in the\nspectrum of this star, which are typical of luminous blue variables (LBVs). The\nLBV status of MN48 was further supported by photometric monitoring which shows\nthat in 2009--2011 this star has brightened by approx 0.9 and 1 mag in the V\nand I_c bands, respectively, then faded by approx 1.1 and 1.6 mag during the\nnext four years, and apparently started to brighten again recently. The\ndetected changes in the spectrum and brightness of MN48 make this star the 18th\nknown Galactic bona fide LBV and increase the percentage of LBVs associated\nwith circumstellar nebulae to more than 70 per cent. We discuss the possible\nbirth place of MN48 and suggest that this star might have been ejected either\nfrom a putative star cluster embedded in the HII region IRAS 16455-4531 or the\nyoung massive star cluster Westerlund 1.\n", "  Hydrogen and helium emission lines in nebulae form by radiative\nrecombination. This is a simple process which, in principle, can be described\nto very high precision. Ratios of He I and H I emission lines can be used to\nmeasure the He$^+$/H$^+$ abundance ratio to the same precision as the\nrecombination rate coefficients. This paper investigates the controversy over\nthe correct theory to describe dipole $l$-changing collisions ($nl\\rightarrow\nnl'=l\\pm 1$) between energy-degenerate states within an $n$-shell. The work of\nPengelly & Seaton (1964) has, for half-a-century, been considered the\ndefinitive study which \"solved\" the problem. Recent work by Vrinceanu et\nal.(2012) recommended the use of rate coefficients from a semi-classical\napproximation which are nearly an order of magnitude smaller than those of\nPengelly & Seaton (1964), with the result that significantly higher densities\nare needed for the $nl$ populations to come into local thermodynamic\nequilibrium.\n  Here, we compare predicted H~I emissivities from the two works and find\nwidespread differences, of up to $\\approx 10$%. This far exceeds the 1%\nprecision required to obtain the primordial He/H abundance ratio from\nobservations so as to constrain Big Bang cosmologies. We recommend using the\nrate coefficients of Pengelly & Seaton (1964) for $l$-changing collisions, to\ndescribe the H recombination spectrum, based-on their quantum mechanical\nrepresentation of the long-range dipole interaction.\n", "  We observed the nuclear region of the galaxy NGC 1365 with the integral field\nunit of the Gemini Multi Object Spectrograph mounted on the GEMINI-South\ntelescope. The field of view covers $13^{\\prime\\prime} \\times 6^{\\prime\\prime}$\n($1173 \\times 541$ pc$^{2}$) centered on the nucleus, at a spatial resolution\nof $52$ pc. The spectral coverage extends from $5600$ \\AA\\ to $7000$ \\AA, at a\nspectral resolution $R=1918$. NGC 1365 hosts a Seyfert 1.8 nucleus, and\nexhibits a prominent bar extending out to $100^{\\prime\\prime}$ (9 kpc) from the\nnucleus. The field of view lies within the inner Lindblad resonance. Within\nthis region, we found that the kinematics of the ionized gas (as traced by\n[OI], [NII], H$\\alpha$, and [SII]) is consistent with rotation in the\nlarge-scale plane of the galaxy. While rotation dominates the kinematics, there\nis also evidence for a fan-shaped outflow, as found in other studies based on\nthe [OIII] emission lines. Although evidence for gas inflowing along nuclear\nspirals has been found in a few barred galaxies, we find no obvious signs of\nsuch features in the inner kiloparsec of NGC 1365. However, the emission lines\nexhibit a puzzling asymmetry that could originate from gas which is slower than\nthe gas responsible for the bulk of the narrow-line emission. We speculate that\nit could be tracing gas which lost angular momentum, and is slowly migrating\nfrom the inner Lindblad resonance towards the nucleus of the galaxy.\n", "  We assemble a sample of disk star-forming galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey Data Release 7, studying the structure of H$\\alpha$ emission lines,\nfinding a large fraction of this sample contains boxy H$\\alpha$ line profiles.\nThis fraction depends on galaxy physical and geometric parameters in the\nfollowing way: (1) it increases monotonically with star formation rate per unit\narea ($\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}$), and stellar mass ($M_*$), with the trend being much\nstronger with $M_*$, from $\\sim$0% at $M_*=10^{10}M_{\\odot}$ to about 50% at\n$M_*=10^{11}M_\\odot$; (2) the fraction is much smaller in face-on systems than\nin edge-on systems. It increases with galaxy inclination ($i$) while $i <\n60\\,^{\\circ}$ and is roughly a constant of 25% beyond this range; (3) for the\nsources which can be modeled well with two velocity components, blueshifted and\nredshifted from the systemic velocity, these is a positive correlation between\nthe velocity difference of these two components and the stellar mass, with a\nslope similar to the Tully-Fisher relation; (4) the two components are very\nsymmetric in the mean, both in velocity and in amplitude. The four findings\nlisted above can be understood as a natural result of a rotating galaxy disk\nwith a kpc-scale ring-like H$\\alpha$ emission region.\n", "  Substellar members of young ($\\lesssim$150 Myr) moving groups are valuable\nbenchmarks to empirically define brown dwarf evolution with age and to study\nthe low-mass end of the initial mass function. We have combined Pan-STARRS1\n(PS1) proper motions with optical$-$IR photometry from PS1, 2MASS and\n$\\textit{WISE}$ to search for substellar members of the AB Dor Moving Group\nwithin $\\approx$50 pc and with spectral types of late-M to early-L,\ncorresponding to masses down to $\\approx$30 M$_{Jup}$ at the age of the group\n($\\approx$125 Myr). Including both photometry and proper motions allows us to\nbetter select candidates by excluding field dwarfs whose colors are similar to\nyoung AB~Dor Moving Group members. Our near-IR spectroscopy has identified six\nultracool dwarfs (M6$-$L4; $\\approx$30$-$100 M$_{Jup}$) with intermediate\nsurface gravities (INT-G) as candidate members of the AB Dor Moving Group. We\nfind another two candidate members with spectra showing hints of youth but\nconsistent with field gravities. We also find four field brown dwarfs\nunassociated with the AB Dor Moving Group, three of which have INT-G gravity\nclassification. While signatures of youth are present in the spectra of our\n$\\approx$125 Myr objects, neither their $J-K$ nor $W1-W2$ colors are\nsignificantly redder than field dwarfs with the same spectral types, unlike\nyounger ultracool dwarfs. We also determined PS1 parallaxes for eight of our\ncandidates and one previously identified AB Dor Moving Group candidate.\nAlthough radial velocities (and parallaxes, for some) are still needed to fully\nassess membership, these new objects provide valuable insight into the spectral\ncharacteristics and evolution of young brown dwarfs.\n", "  Galactic Globular clusters (GCs) are now known to harbour multiple stellar\npopulations, which are chemically distinct in many light element abundances. It\nis becoming increasingly clear that asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars in GCs\nshow different abundance distributions in light elements compared to those in\nthe red giant branch (RGB) and other phases, skewing toward more primordial,\nfield-star-like abundances, which we refer to as subpopulation one (SP1). As\npart of a larger program targeting giants in GCs, we obtained high-resolution\nspectra for a sample of 106 RGB and 15 AGB stars in Messier 4 (NGC 6121) using\nthe 2dF+HERMES facility on the Anglo-Australian Telescope. In this Letter we\nreport an extreme paucity of AGB stars with [Na/O] > -0.17 in M4, which\ncontrasts with the RGB that has abundances up to [Na/O] =0.55. The AGB\nabundance distribution is consistent with all AGB stars being from SP1. This\nresult appears to imply that all subpopulation two stars (SP2; Na-rich, O-poor)\navoid the AGB phase. This is an unexpected result given M4's horizontal branch\nmorphology -- it does not have an extended blue horizontal branch. This is the\nfirst abundance study to be performed utilising the HERMES spectrograph.\n", "  This is the third paper in a series describing the spectroscopic properties\nof a sample of 39 AGN at $z \\sim 1.5$, selected to cover a large range in black\nhole mass ($M_{BH}$) and Eddington ratio ($L/L_{Edd}$). In this paper, we\ncontinue the analysis of the VLT/X-shooter observations of our sample with the\naddition of 9 new sources. We use an improved Bayesian procedure, which takes\ninto account intrinsic reddening, and improved $M_{BH}$ estimates, to fit thin\naccretion disc (AD) models to the observed spectra and constrain the spin\nparameter ($a_*$) of the central black holes. We can fit 37 out of 39 AGN with\nthe thin AD model, and for those with satisfactory fits, we obtain constraints\non the spin parameter of the BHs, with the constraints becoming generally less\nwell defined with decreasing BH mass. Our spin parameter estimates range from\n$\\sim$$-$0.6 to maximum spin for our sample, and our results are consistent\nwith the \"spin-up\" scenario of BH spin evolution. We also discuss how the\nresults of our analysis vary with the inclusion of non-simultaneous GALEX\nphotometry in our thin AD fitting. Simultaneous spectra covering the rest-frame\noptical through far-UV are necessary to definitively test the thin AD theory\nand obtain the best constraints on the spin parameter.\n", "  By combining the data from surveys for HI 21-cm absorption at various impact\nparameters in near-by galaxies, we report an anti-correlation between the 21-cm\nabsorption strength (velocity integrated optical depth) and the impact\nparameter. Also, by combining the 21-cm absorption strength with that of the\nemission, giving the neutral hydrogen column density, we find no evidence that\nthe spin temperature of the gas (degenerate with the covering factor) varies\nsignificantly across the disk. This is consistent with the uniformity of spin\ntemperature measured across the Galactic disk. Furthermore, comparison with the\nGalactic distribution suggests that intervening 21-cm absorption preferentially\narises in disks of high inclinations (near face-on). We also investigate the\nhypothesis that 21-cm absorption is favourably detected towards compact radio\nsources. Although there is insufficient data to determine whether there is a\nhigher detection rate towards quasar, rather than radio galaxy, sight-lines,\nthe 21-cm detections intervene objects with a mean turnover frequency of 5 x\n10^8 Hz, compared to 1 x 10^8 Hz for the non-detections. Since the turnover\nfrequency is anti-correlated with radio source size, this does indicate a\npreferential bias for detection towards compact background radio sources.\n", "  A model-independent method for the analysis of the two-particle short-range\ncorrelations is presented, that can be utilized to describe e.g. Bose-Einstein\n(HBT), dynamical (ridge) or other correlation functions, that have a nearly\nL\\'evy or streched exponential shape. For the special case of L\\'evy exponent\nalpha = 1, the earlier Laguerre expansions are recovered, for the alpha = 2\nspecial case, a new expansion method is obtained for nearly Gaussian\ncorrelation functions. Multi-dimensional L\\'evy expansions are also introduced\nand their potential application to analyze rigde correlation data is discussed.\n", "  Deuteron has been studied using a noncritical holographic\nquantumchromodynamics model constructed in the six-dimensional Anti-de-Sitter\nsupergravity background. The nucleus potential energy is calculated. The\nbinding energy has been estimated as the minimum of the potential energy. The\nroles of various mesons in producing the deuteron potential energy are\ndiscussed in details.\n", "  An extended XMM-Newton observation of the luminous narrow line Seyfert galaxy\nPG 1211+143 in 2014 has revealed a more complex high velocity wind, with\ncomponents distinguished in velocity, ionization level, and column density.\nHere we report soft x-ray emission and absorption features from the ionized\noutflow, finding counterparts of both high velocity components, v ~ 0.129c and\nv ~ 0.066c, recently identified in the highly ionized Fe K absorption spectrum.\nThe lower ionization of the co-moving soft x-ray absorbers imply a distribution\nof higher density clouds embedded in the main outflow, while much higher column\ndensities for the same flow component in the hard x-ray spectra suggest\ndiffering sight lines to the continuum x-ray source.\n", "  We report the results of VERA multi-epoch VLBI 22 GHz water maser\nobservations of S255IR-SMA1, a massive young stellar object located in the S255\nstar forming region. By annual parallax the source distance was measured as D =\n1.78 +-0.12 kpc and the source systemic motion was (u alpha cos d, u d) =\n(-0.13 +- 0.20, -0.06 +- 0.27) mas yr-1. Masers appear to trace a U-shaped bow\nshock whose morphology and proper motions are well reproduced by a jet-driven\noutflow model with a jet radius of about 6 AU. The maser data, in the context\nof other works in the literature, reveal ejections from S255IR-SMA1 to be\nepisodic, operating on timescales of ~1000 years.\n", "  We present the first detection of molecular emission from a galaxy selected\nto be near a projected background quasar using the Atacama Large\nMillimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The ALMA detection of CO(1$-$0) emission\nfrom the $z=0.101$ galaxy toward quasar PKS 0439-433 is coincident with its\nstellar disk and yields a molecular gas mass of $M_{\\rm mol} \\approx 4.2 \\times\n10^9 M_\\odot$ (for a Galactic CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor), larger than the\nupper limit on its atomic gas mass. We resolve the CO velocity field, obtaining\na rotational velocity of $134 \\pm 11$ km s$^{-1}$, and a resultant dynamical\nmass of $\\geq 4 \\times 10^{10} M_\\odot$. Despite its high metallicity and large\nmolecular mass, the $z=0.101$ galaxy has a low star formation rate, implying a\nlarge gas consumption timescale, larger than that typical of late-type\ngalaxies. Most of the molecular gas is hence likely to be in a diffuse extended\nphase, rather than in dense molecular clouds. By combining the results of\nemission and absorption studies, we find that the strongest molecular\nabsorption component toward the quasar cannot arise from the molecular disk,\nbut is likely to arise from diffuse gas in the galaxy's circumgalactic medium.\nOur results emphasize the potential of combining molecular and stellar emission\nline studies with optical absorption line studies to achieve a more complete\npicture of the gas within and surrounding high-redshift galaxies.\n", "  It is suggested that essentially all of the UHECRs we detect, including those\nat the highest energy, originate in our Galaxy. It is shown that even if the\ndensity of sources decreases with Galactic radius, then the anisotropy and\ncomposition can be understood. Inward anisotropy, as recently reported by the\nAuger collaboration can be understood as drift along the current sheet of\nUHECRs originating outside the solar circle, as predicted in Kumar and Eichler\n(2014), while those originating within the solar circle exit the Galaxy at high\nlatitudes.\n", "  iPTF14atg, a subluminous peculiar Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) similar to SN\n2002es, is the first SN Ia for which a strong UV flash was observed in the\nearly-time light curves. This has been interpreted as evidence for a\nsingle-degenerate (SD) progenitor system where such a signal is expected from\ninteractions between the SN ejecta and the non-degenerate companion star. Here,\nwe compare synthetic observables of multi-dimensional state-of-the-art\nexplosion models for different progenitor scenarios to the light curves and\nspectra of iPTF14atg. From our models, we have difficulties explaining the\nspectral evolution of iPTF14atg within the SD progenitor channel. In contrast,\nwe find that a violent merger of two carbon-oxygen white dwarfs with 0.9 and\n0.76 solar masses, respectively, provides an excellent match to the spectral\nevolution of iPTF14atg from 10d before to several weeks after maximum light.\nOur merger model does not naturally explain the initial UV flash of iPTF14atg.\nWe discuss several possibilities like interactions of the SN ejecta with the\ncircum-stellar medium and surface radioactivity from a He ignited merger that\nmay be able to account for the early UV emission in violent merger models.\n", "  We examine the convective stability of hydrodynamic discs with full\nstratification in the local approximation and in the presence of thermal\ndiffusion (or relaxation). Various branches of the relevant axisymmetric\ndispersion relation derived by Urpin (2003) are discussed. We find that when\nthe vertical Richardson number is larger than or equal to the radial one (i.e.\n$|Ri_z|\\geq|Ri_x|$) and wavenumbers are comparable (i.e. $|k_x|\\sim|k_z|$) the\ndisc becomes unstable, even in the presence of radial and vertical\nstratifications with $Ri_x>0$ and $Ri_z>0$. The origin of this resides in an\nhybrid radial-vertical Richardson number. We propose an equilibrium profile\nwith temperature depending on the radial and vertical coordinates and with\n$Ri_z>0$ for which this destabilization mechanism occurs. We notice as well\nthat the dispersion relation of the \"convective overstability\" is the branch of\nthe one here discussed in the limit $|k_z|\\gg|k_x|$ (i. e. two-dimensional\ndisc).\n", "  We report measurements from an XMM-Newton observation of the low-excitation\nradio galaxy 3C 386. The study focusses on an X-ray-emitting gas belt, which\nlies between and orthogonal to the radio lobes of 3C 386 and has a mean\ntemperature of $0.94\\pm0.05$ keV, cooler than the extended group atmosphere.\nThe gas in the belt shows temperature structure with material closer to the\nsurrounding medium being hotter than gas closer to the host galaxy. We suggest\nthat this gas belt involves a `buoyancy-driven inflow' of part of the group-gas\natmosphere where the buoyant rise of the radio lobes through the ambient medium\nhas directed an inflow towards the relic cold core of the group.\nInverse-Compton emission from the radio lobes is detected at a level consistent\nwith a slight suppression of the magnetic field below the equipartition value.\n", "  Recently, Li et al. (2016) claimed to have found evidence for multiple\ngenerations of stars in the intermediate age clusters NGC 1783, NGC 1696 and\nNGC 411 in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC/SMC). Here we show that\nthese young stellar populations are present in the field regions around these\nclusters and are not likely associated with the clusters themselves. Using the\nsame datasets, we find that the background subtraction method adopted by the\nauthors does not adequately remove contaminating stars in the small number\nPoisson limit. Hence, we conclude that their results do not provide evidence of\nyoung generations of stars within these clusters.\n", "  Using Arcminute Microkelvin Imager (AMI) SZ observations towards ten CLASH\nclusters we investigate the influence of cluster mergers on observational\ngalaxy cluster studies. Although selected to be largely relaxed, there is\ndisagreement in the literature on the dynamical states of CLASH sample members.\nWe analyse our AMI data in a fully Bayesian way to produce estimated cluster\nparameters and consider the intrinsic correlations in our NFW/GNFW-based model.\nVarying pressure profile shape parameters, illustrating an influence of mergers\non scaling relations, induces small deviations from the canonical self-similar\npredictions -- in agreement with simulations of Poole et al. 2007 who found\nthat merger activity causes only small scatter perpendicular to the relations.\nWe demonstrate this effect observationally using the different dependencies of\nSZ and X-ray signals to $n_{\\rm e}$ that cause different sensitivities to the\nshocking and/or fractionation produced by mergers. Plotting $Y_{\\rm\nX}$--$M_{\\rm gas}$ relations (where $Y_{\\rm X}=M_{\\rm gas}T$) derived from AMI\nSZ and from $Chandra$ X-ray gives ratios of AMI and $Chandra$ $Y_{\\rm X}$ and\n$M_{\\rm gas}$ estimates that indicate movement of clusters \\textit{along} the\nscaling relation, as predicted by Poole et al. 2007. Clusters that have moved\nmost along the relation have the most discrepant $T_{\\rm SZ}$ and $T_{\\rm X}$\nestimates: all the other clusters (apart from one) have SZ and X-ray estimates\nof $M_{\\rm gas}$, $T$ and $Y_{\\rm X}$ that agree within $r_{500}$. We use SZ vs\nX-ray discrepancies in conjunction with $Chandra$ maps and $T_{\\rm X}$\nprofiles, making comparisons with simulated cluster merger maps in Poole et al.\n2006, to identify disturbed members of our sample and estimate merger stages.\n", "  Intense electric currents called electrojets occur in weakly ionized\nmagnetized plasmas. An example occurs in the Earth's ionosphere near the\nmagnetic equator where neutral winds drive the plasma across the geomagnetic\nfield. Similar processes take place in the Solar chromosphere and MHD\ngenerators. This letter argues that not all convective neutral flows generate\nelectrojets and it introduces the corresponding universal criterion for\nelectrojet formation, $\\nabla\\times\n(\\vec{U}\\times\\vec{B})\\neq\\partial\\vec{B}/\\partial t$, where $\\vec{U}$ is the\nneutral flow velocity, $\\vec{B}$ is the magnetic field, and $t$ is time. This\ncriterion does not depend on the conductivity tensor, $\\hat{\\sigma}$. For many\nsystems, the displacement current, $\\partial\\vec{B}/\\partial t$, is negligible,\nmaking the criterion even simpler. This theory also shows that the\nneutral-dynamo driver that generates electrojets plays the same role as the DC\nelectric current plays for the generation of the magnetic field in the\nBiot-Savart law.\n", "  Dwarf spheroidal galaxies are among the most numerous galaxy population in\nthe Universe, but their main formation and evolution channels are still not\nwell understood. The three dwarf spheroidal satellites (NGC147, NGC185, and\nNGC205) of the Andromeda galaxy are characterised by very different\ninterstellar medium (ISM) properties, which might suggest them being at\ndifferent galaxy evolutionary stages. While the dust content of NGC205 has been\nstudied in detail by De Looze et al. (2012), we present new Herschel dust\ncontinuum observations of NGC147 and NGC185. The non-detection of NGC147 in\nHerschel SPIRE maps puts a strong constraint on its dust mass (< 128 Msun). For\nNGC185, we derive a total dust mass M_d = 5.1 x 10^3 Msun, which is a factor of\n~2-3 higher than that derived from ISO and Spitzer observations and confirms\nthe need for longer wavelength observations to trace more massive cold dust\nreservoirs. We, furthermore, estimate the dust production by asymptotic giant\nbranch (AGB) stars and supernovae (SNe). For NGC147, the upper limit on the\ndust mass is consistent with expectations of the material injected by the\nevolved stellar population. In NGC185 and NGC205, the observed dust content is\none order of magnitude higher compared to the estimated dust production by AGBs\nand SNe. Efficient grain growth, and potentially longer dust survival times\n(3-6 Gyr) are required to account for their current dust content. Our study\nconfirms the importance of grain growth in the gas phase to account for the\ncurrent dust reservoir in galaxies.\n", "  Activation of shallow acceptor state has been observed in ion irradiated and\nsubsequently air annealed polycrystalline ZnO material. Low temperature\nphotoluminescence (PL) spectrum of the sample exhibits clear signature of\nacceptor bound exciton (ABX) emission at 3.360 eV. The other two samples,\npristine and ion irradiated (without annealing), however, do not show acceptor\nrelated PL emission in the nearby energy region. Electron transition from\nshallow donor (most probable site is interstitial zinc for undoped ZnO) to such\nnewly formed shallow acceptor state creates new donor-acceptor pair (DAP)\nluminescence peak ~ 3.229 eV. ABX and DAP peak energy positions confirm that\nthe acceptor is N related. The acceptor exciton binding energy has been\nestimated to be 180 +/- 15 meV which is in conformity with earlier reports. The\nactivation of shallow acceptors without any source of atomic nitrogen can only\nbe possible through diffusion of molecular nitrogen inside the sample during\nannealing. The N2 molecules get trapped at bulk defect sites incorporated by\nion irradiation and subsequent annealing. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman\nspectroscopic (RS) investigation have been employed to probe the changing\ndefective nature of the ZnO samples. Irradiation induced increased disorder has\nbeen detected (both by XRD and RS) which is partially removed/modified by\nannealing at 300 oC. Simultaneous activation of molecular nitrogen acceptor in\npurposefully defective ZnO is the key finding of this work. Results presented\nhere provide a simple but controlled way of producing shallow acceptor state in\nZnO. If optimized through suitable choice of ion, its energy and fluence as\nwell as the annealing temperature, this methodology can trigger further scope\nto fabricate devices using ZnO epitaxial thin films or nanowires.\n", "  The necessary information to distinguish a local inhomogeneous mass density\nfield from its spatial average on a compact domain of the universe can be\nmeasured by relative information entropy. The Kullback-Leibler (KL) formula\narises very naturally in this context, however, it provides a very complicated\nway to compute the mutual information between spatially separated but causally\nconnected regions of the universe in a realistic, inhomogeneous model. To\ncircumvent this issue, by considering a parametric extension of the KL measure,\nwe develop a simple model to describe the mutual information which is entangled\nvia the gravitational field equations. We show that the Tsallis relative\nentropy can be a good approximation in the case of small inhomogeneities, and\nfor measuring the independent relative information inside the domain, we\npropose the R\\'enyi relative entropy formula.\n", "  This review focuses on the striking recent progress in solving for\nhydrophobic interactions between small inert molecules. We discuss several new\nunderstandings. Firstly, the _inverse _temperature phenomenology of hydrophobic\ninteractions, _i.e., strengthening of hydrophobic bonds with increasing\ntemperature, is decisively exhibited by hydrophobic interactions between\natomic-scale hard sphere solutes in water. Secondly, inclusion of attractive\ninteractions associated with atomic-size hydrophobic reference cases leads to\nsubstantial, non-trivial corrections to reference results for purely repulsive\nsolutes. Hydrophobic bonds are _weakened by adding solute dispersion forces to\ntreatment of reference cases. The classic statistical mechanical theory for\nthose corrections is not accurate in this application, but molecular\nquasi-chemical theory shows promise. Finally, because of the masking roles of\nexcluded volume and attractive interactions, comparisons that do not\ndiscriminate the different possibilities face an interpretive danger.\n", "  The nonlinearities of current-voltage characteristics (IVC) of\nsuperconducting niobium point contacts for voltages of the order of the\ncharacteristic phonon frequencies are investigated. It is shown that in\nlimiting by dirty contacts ${{l}_{1}}\\ll d$ , (${{l}_{1}}$ is the momentum\nmean-free path of electrons), features are observed on the IVC corresponding to\nmaxima in the first or second derivatives and are situated at energies close to\nthe characteristic phonon energies. These features are due to the energy\ndependence of the excess current, since the nonlinearity of the IVC in the\nnormal state is several times smaller in absolute magnitude, and its second\nderivative is monotonic. For a contact diameter $d$ of the order of several\ntens of angstroms (the contact resistance is of the order of 100 $\\Omega $),\nthe thermal effects can be neglected. It is assumed that in the region of the\nconstriction, the characteristic lengths of the system satisfy the relation\n$\\xi \\gtrsim d>{{\\Lambda }_{\\varepsilon }}$ (${{\\Lambda }_{\\varepsilon }}$ is\nthe diffusion length for energy relaxation of the electrons, $\\xi$ is the\ncoherence length) which makes possible inelastic transitions of electrons\nbetween pair chemical potentials differing in energy by an account $eV$ ($V$ is\nthe voltage drop across the contact)\n", "  This paper studies stabilities of stochastic differential equation (SDE)\ndriven by time-changed L\\'evy noise in both probability and moment sense. This\nprovides more flexibility in modeling schemes in application areas including\nphysics, biology, engineering, finance and hydrology. Necessary conditions for\nsolution of time-changed SDE to be stable in different senses will be\nestablished. Connection between stability of solution to time-changed SDE and\nthat to corresponding original SDE will be disclosed. Examples related to\ndifferent stabilities will be given. We study SDEs with time-changed L\\'evy\nnoise, where the time-change processes are inverse of general L\\'evy\nsubordinators. These results are important improvements of the results in \"Q.\nWu, Stability of stochastic differential equation with respect to time-changed\nBrownian motion, 2016.\".\n", "  Surface plasmon polaritons are electromagnetic waves propagating on the\nsurface of a metal. Thanks to subwavelength confinement to the surface, they\ncan concentrate optical energy on the micrometer or even nanometer scale,\nenabling new applications in bio-sensing, optical interconnects, and nonlinear\noptics, where small footprint and strong field concentration is of the essence.\nThe major obstacle in developing plasmonic applications is dissipative loss,\nwhich limits the propagation length of surface plasmons and broadens the\nbandwidth of surface-plasmon resonances. Here we present a new analysis of\nplasmonic materials and geometries that fully considers the trade-off between\nthe propagation length and the degree of confinement of surface plasmon\npolaritons and allows a fair comparison between different substrates.\n", "  We apply the Law of Total Probability to the construction of scale-invariant\nprobability distribution functions (pdfs), and require that probability\nmeasures be dimensionless and unitless under a continuous change of scales. If\nthe scale-change distribution function is scale invariant then the constructed\ndistribution will also be scale invariant. Repeated application of this\nconstruction on an arbitrary set of (normalizable) pdfs results again in\nscale-invariant distributions. The invariant function of this procedure is\ngiven uniquely by the reciprocal distribution, suggesting a kind of\nuniversality. We separately demonstrate that the reciprocal distribution\nresults uniquely from requiring maximum entropy for size-class distributions\nwith uniform bin sizes.\n", "  We present the results of a theoretical investigation of the dynamics of a\ndroplet walking on a vibrating fluid bath under the influence of a harmonic\npotential. The walking droplet's horizontal motion is described by an\nintegro-differential trajectory equation, which is found to admit steady\norbital solutions. Predictions for the dependence of the orbital radius and\nfrequency on the strength of the radial harmonic force field agree favorably\nwith experimental data. The orbital quantization is rationalized through an\nanalysis of the orbital solutions. The predicted dependence of the orbital\nstability on system parameters is compared with experimental data and the\nlimitations of the model are discussed.\n", "  A bouncing drop and its associated accompanying wave forms a walker. Based on\nprevious works, we show in this article that it is possible to formulate a\nsimple theoretical framework for the walker dynamics. It relies on a time scale\ndecomposition corresponding to the effects successively generated when the\nmemory effects increase. While the short time scale effect is simply\nresponsible for the walker's propulsion, the intermediate scale generates\nspontaneously pivotal structures endowed with angular momentum. At an even\nlarger memory scale, if the walker is spatially confined, the pivots become the\nbuilding blocks of a self-organization into a global structure. This new\ntheoretical framework is applied in the presence of an external harmonic\npotential, and reveals the underlying mechanisms leading to the emergence of\nthe macroscopic spatial organization reported by Perrard et al. (2014, Nature\nCommun. 5, 3219)\n", "  We describe an introductory data science course, entitled Introduction to\nData Science, offered at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The\ncourse introduced general programming concepts by using the Python programming\nlanguage with an emphasis on data preparation, processing, and presentation.\nThe course had no prerequisites, and students were not expected to have any\nprogramming experience. This introductory course was designed to cover a wide\nrange of topics, from the nature of data, to storage, to visualization, to\nprobability and statistical analysis, to cloud and high performance computing,\nwithout becoming overly focused on any one subject. We conclude this article\nwith a discussion of lessons learned and our plans to develop new data science\ncourses.\n", "  Group discussions are essential for organizing every aspect of modern life,\nfrom faculty meetings to senate debates, from grant review panels to papal\nconclaves. While costly in terms of time and organization effort, group\ndiscussions are commonly seen as a way of reaching better decisions compared to\nsolutions that do not require coordination between the individuals (e.g.\nvoting)---through discussion, the sum becomes greater than the parts. However,\nthis assumption is not irrefutable: anecdotal evidence of wasteful discussions\nabounds, and in our own experiments we find that over 30% of discussions are\nunproductive.\n  We propose a framework for analyzing conversational dynamics in order to\ndetermine whether a given task-oriented discussion is worth having or not. We\nexploit conversational patterns reflecting the flow of ideas and the balance\nbetween the participants, as well as their linguistic choices. We apply this\nframework to conversations naturally occurring in an online collaborative world\nexploration game developed and deployed to support this research. Using this\nsetting, we show that linguistic cues and conversational patterns extracted\nfrom the first 20 seconds of a team discussion are predictive of whether it\nwill be a wasteful or a productive one.\n", "  We study the Cauchy problem for the focusing nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS)\nequation. Using the DBAR generalization of the nonlinear steepest descent\nmethod we compute the long time asymptotic expansion of the solution in any\nfixed space-time cone x_1 + v_1 t <= x <= x_2 + v_2 t with v_1 <= v_2 up to an\n(optimal) residual error of order O(t^(-3/4)). In each (x,t) cone the leading\norder term in this expansion is a multi-soliton whose parameters are modulated\nby soliton-soliton and soliton-radiation interactions as one moves through the\ncone. Our results only require that the initial data possess one L^2(R) moment\nand (weak) derivative and that it not generate any spectral singularities\n(embedded eigenvalues).\n", "  The study of fundamental properties (such as temperatures, radii, masses, and\nages) and interior processes (such as convection and angular momentum\ntransport) of stars has implications on various topics in astrophysics, ranging\nfrom the evolution of galaxies to understanding exoplanets. In this\ncontribution I will review the basic principles of two key observational\nmethods for constraining fundamental and interior properties of single field\nstars: the study stellar oscillations (asteroseismology) and optical\nlong-baseline interferometry. I will highlight recent breakthrough discoveries\nin asteroseismology such as the measurement of core rotation rates in red\ngiants and the characterization of exoplanet systems. I will furthermore\ncomment on the reliability of interferometry as a tool to calibrate indirect\nmethods to estimate fundamental properties, and present a new angular diameter\nmeasurement for the exoplanet host star HD219134 which demonstrates that\ndiameters for stars which are relatively well resolved (~> 1 mas for the K\nband) are consistent across different instruments. Finally I will discuss the\nsynergy between asteroseismology and interferometry to test asteroseismic\nscaling relations, and give a brief outlook on the expected impact of\nspace-based missions such as K2, TESS and Gaia.\n", "  This paper extends the Lorentz-Abraham model of an electron (i.e. the\nequations of motion for a small spherical shell of charge, which is rigid in\nits proper frame) to treat a small spherically symmetric charge distribution,\nallowing for small internal dipolar motion. This is done by dividing the\ndistribution into thin spherical shells (in the continuum limit), and tracking\nthe interactions between shells. Dipolar motion of each constituent spherical\nshell is allowed along the net dipole moment, but higher order\nmultipole-moments are ignored. The amplitude of dipolar motion of each\nspherical shell is assumed to be linearly proportional to the net dipole\nmoment. Under these assumptions, low velocity equations of motion are\ndetermined for both the center-of-mass motion and net dipolar motion of the\ndistribution. This is then generalized to arbitrary (relativistic)\ncenter-of-mass velocity and acceleration, assuming the motion of individual\nshells is completely in phase or out of phase with the net dipole moment.\n", "  We give a detailed derivation of the second-order (local) hydrodynamics for\nBoltzmann equation with an external force by using the renormalization group\nmethod. In this method, we solve the Boltzmann equation faithfully to extract\nthe hydrodynamics without recourse to any ansatz. Our method leads to\nmicroscopic expressions of not only all the transport coefficients that are of\nthe same form as those in Chapman-Enskog method but also those of the viscous\nrelaxation times $\\tau_i$ that admit physically natural interpretations. As an\nexample, we apply our microscopic expressions to calculate the transport\ncoefficients and the relaxation times of the cold fermionic atoms in a\nquantitative way, where the transition probability in the collision term is\ngiven explicitly in terms of the $s$-wave scattering length $a_s$. We thereby\ndiscuss the quantum statistical effects, temperature dependence, and\nscattering-length dependence of the first-order transport coefficients and the\nviscous relaxation times: It is shown that as the temperature is lowered, the\ntransport coefficients and the relaxation times increase rapidly because Pauli\nprinciple acts effectively. On the other hand, as $a_s$ is increased, these\nquantities decrease and become vanishingly small at unitarity because of the\nstrong coupling. The numerical calculation shows that the relation\n$\\tau_\\pi=\\eta/P$, which is derived in the relaxation-time approximation and\nused in most of literature without almost any foundation, turns out to be\nsatisfied quite well, while the similar relation for the relaxation time\n$\\tau_J$ of the heat conductivity is satisfied only approximately with a\nconsiderable error.\n", "  There is a natural left and right invariant Haar measure associated with the\nmatrix groups GL${}_N(\\mathbb R)$ and SL${}_N(\\mathbb R)$ due to Siegel. For\nthe associated volume to be finite it is necessary to truncate the groups by\nimposing a bound on the norm, or in the case of SL${}_N(\\mathbb R)$, by\nrestricting to a fundamental domain. We compute the asymptotic volumes\nassociated with the Haar measure for GL${}_N(\\mathbb R)$ and SL${}_N(\\mathbb\nR)$ matrices in the case of that the operator norm lies between $R_1$ and\n$1/R_2$ in the former, and this norm, or alternatively the 2-norm, is bounded\nby $R$ in the latter. By a result of Duke, Rundnick and Sarnak, such asymptotic\nformulas in the case of SL${}_N(\\mathbb R)$ imply an asymptotic counting\nformula for matrices in SL${}_N(\\mathbb Z)$. We discuss too the sampling of\nSL${}_N(\\mathbb R)$ matrices from the truncated sets. By then using lattice\nreduction to a fundamental domain, we obtain histograms approximating the\nprobability density functions of the lengths and pairwise angles of shortest\nlength bases vectors in the case $N=2$ and 3, or equivalently of shortest\nlinearly independent vectors in the corresponding random lattice. In the case\n$N=2$ these distributions are evaluated explicitly.\n", "  In this paper we study the anti-integrable limit scenario of skew-product\nsystems. We consider a generalization of such systems based on the\nFrenkel-Kontorova model, and prove the existence of orbits with any fibered\nrotation number in systems of both one and two degrees of freedom. In\nparticular, our results also apply to two dimensional maps with degenerate\npotentials (vanishing second derivative), so extending the results of existence\nof Cantori for more general twist maps.\n  We also prove that under certain mild regularity conditions on the potential\nthe structure of the orbits is of Cantor type. From our results we deduce the\nexistence of the non-smooth folding bifurcation (conjectured by Figueras-Haro,\n\\textit{Different scenarios for hyperbolicity breakdown in quasiperiodic area\npreserving twist maps}, Chaos:25 (2015)).\n  Lastly we present a pair of results which are useful in determining if a\npotential satisfies the regularity conditions required for the Cantor sets of\norbits to exist and are also of independent interest.\n", "  We present a simple solution to enhance the separation ability of\ndeterministic lateral displacement (DLD) systems by expanding the\ntwo-dimensional nature of these devices and driving the particles into\nsize-dependent, fully three-dimensional trajectories. Specifically, we drive\nthe particles through an array of long cylindrical posts, such that they not\nonly move in the plane perpendicular to the posts as in traditional\ntwo-dimensional DLD systems (in-plane motion), but also along the axial\ndirection of the solid posts (out-of-plane motion). We show that the\n(projected) in-plane motion of the particles is completely analogous to that\nobserved in 2D-DLD systems. In fact, a theoretical model originally developed\nfor force-driven, two-dimensional DLD systems accurately describes the\nexperimental results. More importantly, we analyze the particles out-of-plane\nmotion and observe that, for certain orientations of the driving force,\nsignificant differences in the out-of-plane displacement depending on particle\nsize. Therefore, taking advantage of both the in-plane and out-of-plane motion\nof the particles, it is possible to achieve the simultaneous fractionation of a\npolydisperse suspension into multiple streams.\n", "  Using a C-metric-type ansatz, we obtain an exact solution to conformal\ngravity coupled to a Maxwell electromagnetic field. The solution resembles a\nC-metric spacetime carrying an electromagnetic charge. The metric is cast in a\nfactorised form which allows us to study the domain structure of its static\ncoordinate regions. This metric reduces to the well-known Mannheim-Kazanas\nmetric under an appropriate limiting procedure, and also reduces to the\n(Anti-)de Sitter C-metric of Einstein gravity for a particular choice of\nparameters.\n", "  Self-assembly of soft materials attracts keen interest for patterning\napplications owing to its ease and spontaneous behavior. We report the\nfabrication of nanogrooves using sublimation and recondensation of liquid\ncrystal (LC) materials. First, well-aligned smectic LC structures are obtained\non the micron-scale topographic patterns of the microchannel; then the\nsublimation and recondensation process directly produces nanogrooves having\nsub-200-nm scale. The entire process can be completed in less than 30 min.\nAfter it is replicated using an ultraviolet-curable polymer, our platform can\nbe used as an alignment layer to control other guest LC materials.\n", "  Enhancements of the comic-ray intensity as observed by detectors on the\nground have been observed 71 times since 1942. They are due to solar energetic\nparticles accelerated in the regions of solar flares deep in the corona, or in\nthe shock front of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in the solar wind. The latter\nis the favoured model for the classical gradual ground-level enhancement (GLE).\nIn several papers since the one of McCracken et al. (2008), we pointed out,\nhowever, that some GLEs are too impulsive to be accelerated in the CME shocks.\nWith this hypothesis in mind we study the time profiles of all the available\nGLEs. The main results are that there is a continuous range from gradual to\nimpulsive, that the fastest risers are concentrated at heliolongitudes that are\nmagnetically well-connected to Earth, and that the shape of the pulse is a\npowerful indicator of propagation conditions between Sun and Earth. This ranges\nfrom relatively quiet to highly disturbed.\n", "  Many exotic physics anticipated in topological insulators require a gap to be\nopened for their topologica surface states by breaking time reversal symmetry.\nThe gap opening has been achieved by doping magnetic impurities, which however\ninevitably create extra carriers and disorder that undermine the electronic\ntransport. In contrast, the proximity to a ferromagnetic/ferrimagnetic\ninsulator may improve the device quality, thus promises a better way to open\nthe gap while minimizing the side-effects. Here, we grow thin single-crystal\nSb1.9Bi0.1Te3 micro flakes on insulating ferrimagnet BaFe12O19 by using the van\nder Waals epitaxy technique. The micro flakes show a negative magnetoresistance\nin weak perpendicular fields below 50 K, which can be quenched by increasing\ntemperature. The signature implies the weak localization effect as its origin,\nwhich is absent in intrinsic topological insulators, unless a surface state gap\nis opened. The surface state gap is estimated to be 10 meV by using the theory\nof the gap-induced weak localization effect. These results indicate that the\nmagnetic proximity effect may open the gap for the topological surface attached\nto BaM insulating ferrimagnet. This heterostructure may pave the way for the\nrealization of new physical effects as well as the potential applications of\nspintronics devices.\n", "  Hard X-ray generation for Au nanoparticle dispersion was systematically\ninvestigated for different particle diameters ranging from 10 to 100 nm with a\nnarrow size distribution of +/- 2%. Scaling law of X-ray generation is close to\na 6-photon process before the onset of saturation for excitation by 45 fs laser\npulses with central wavelength of 800 nm. This is consistent with bulk plasmon\nexcitation at wavelength ~ 138 nm. The longitudinal E-field component due to\nnanoparticle focusing is responsible for the excitation of the longitudinal\nbulk plasmon. The proposed analysis also explains X-ray emission from water\nbreakdown via an electron solvation mechanism at ~6.2 eV. The most efficient\nemission of X-rays was observed for 40 +/- 10 nm diameter nanoparticles which\nalso had the strongest UV extinction. X-ray emission was the most efficient\nwhen induced by pre-chirped 370 +/- 20 fs laser pulses and exhibited the\nhighest intensity at a negative chirp.\n", "  Nanoporous carbon composite membranes, comprising a layer of porous carbon\nfiber structures with an average channel width of 30-60 nm grown on a porous\nceramic substrate, are found to exhibit robust desalination effect with high\nfreshwater flux. In three different membrane processes of vacuum membrane\ndistillation, reverse osmosis and forward osmosis, the carbon composite\nmembrane showed 100% salt rejection with 3.5 to 20 times higher freshwater flux\ncompared to existing polymeric membranes. Thermal accounting experiments found\nthat at least 80% of the freshwater pass through the carbon composite membrane\nwith no phase change. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed a unique salt\nrejection mechanism. When seawater is interfaced with either vapor or the\nsurface of carbon, one to three interfacial atomic layers contain no salt ions.\nBelow the liquid entry pressure, the salt solution is stopped at the openings\nto the porous channels and forms a meniscus, while the surface layer of\nfreshwater can feed the surface diffusion flux that is fast-transported on the\nsurfaces of the carbon fibers, driven by the chemical potential gradient. As\nthe surface-transported water does not involve a phase change, hence that\ncomponent involves no energy expenditure in the form of latent heat.\n", "  In this work, we present a calculation of the non-Fermi liquid correction to\nthe specific heat of magnetized degenerate quark matter present at the core of\nthe neutron star. The role of non-Fermi liquid corrections to the neutrino\nemissivity has been calculated beyond leading order. We extend our result to\nthe evaluation of the pulsar kick velocity and cooling of the star due to such\nanomalous corrections and present a comparison with the simple Fermi liquid\ncase.\n", "  Thanks to a technique that reveals galaxies in 3D, astronomers can now show\nthat many galaxies have been wrongly classified. Davor Krajnovi\\'c argues that\nthe classification scheme proposed 85 years ago by Edwin Hubble now needs to be\nrevised.\n", "  The origin of the ultra high energy cosmic rays (UHECR) with energies above E\n> 1017eV, is still unknown. The discovery of their sources will reveal the\nengines of the most energetic astrophysical accelerators in the universe. This\nis a written version of a series of lectures devoted to UHECR at the 2013\nCERN-Latin-American School of High-Energy Physics. We present an introduction\nto acceleration mechanisms of charged particles to the highest energies in\nastrophysical objects, their propagation from the sources to Earth, and the\nexperimental techniques for their detection. We also discuss some of the\nrelevant observational results from Telescope Array and Pierre Auger\nObservatory. These experiments deal with particle interactions at energies\norders of magnitude higher than achieved in terrestrial accelerators.\n", "  Cosmic surveys provide crucial information about high energy physics\nincluding strong evidence for dark energy, dark matter, and inflation. Ongoing\nand upcoming surveys will start to identify the underlying physics of these new\nphenomena, including tight constraints on the equation of state of dark energy,\nthe viability of modified gravity, the existence of extra light species, the\nmasses of the neutrinos, and the potential of the field that drove inflation.\nEven after the Stage IV experiments, DESI and LSST, complete their surveys,\nthere will still be much information left in the sky. This additional\ninformation will enable us to understand the physics underlying the dark\nuniverse at an even deeper level and, in case Stage IV surveys find hints for\nphysics beyond the current Standard Model of Cosmology, to revolutionize our\ncurrent view of the universe. There are many ideas for how best to supplement\nand aid DESI and LSST in order to access some of this remaining information and\nhow surveys beyond Stage IV can fully exploit this regime. These ideas flow to\npotential projects that could start construction in the 2020's.\n", "  We study the singularity of the congruences for both timelike and null\ngeodesic curves using the expansion of the early anisotropic Bianchi type I\nUniverse. In this paper, we concentrate on the influence of the shear of the\ntimelike and null geodesic congruences in the early Universe. Under some\nnatural conditions, we derive the Raychaudhuri type equation for the expansion\nand the shear-related equations. Recently, scientists working on the LIGO\n(Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) have shown many\npossibilities to observing the anisotropy of the primordial gravitational wave\nbackground radiation. We deduce the evolution equation for the shear that may\nbe responsible for those observational results.\n", "  The BaBar Collaboration has an intensive program studying the cross sections\nof hadron production in low-energy e+e- annihilation, accessible via\ninitial-state radiation. Our measurements allow a significant improvement in\nthe precision of the predicted value of the muon anomalous magnetic moment.\nThese improvements are necessary for shedding light on the current > 3 sigma\ndifference between the predicted and the experimental values. We have published\nresults on a number of processes with two to six hadrons in the final state,\nand other final states are currently under investigation. We report here on the\nmost recent results obtained by analysing the entire Babar dataset.\n", "  Reversible photodegradation is a process that has been observed in several\ndye molecules, but the underlying mechanisms are not still well understood. In\nthis contribution, we characterize a series of anthraquinone dyes to determine\nhow self-healing depends on molecular structure. Past studies have used probing\ntechniques that rely on linear absorption, two-photon fluorescence, and\namplified spontaneous emission. Each of these probes provide an indirect\nmeasure of the populations of the damaged and undamaged species, requiring\ncalibrations or assumptions to be made that might affect the accuracy of the\nresults. The present studies use fluorescence as a probe, which is shown to\ndirectly measure the undamaged population. It is found that certain\nanthraquinone classes share common structural features that are associated with\nself healing. Furthermore, the time and temperature dependence of\nphotodegradation and self-healing is found to be consistent with the domain\nmodel of self healing.\n", "  A correspondence of classical to quantum physics studied by Schr\\\"{o}\\-dinger\nand Ehrenfest applies without the necessity of technical conjecture that\nclassical observables are associated with Hermitian Hilbert space operators.\nThis correspondence provides appropriate nonrelativistic classical\ninterpretations to realizations of relativistic quantum physics that are\nincompatible with the canonical formalism. Using this correspondence, Newtonian\nmechanics for a $1/r$ potential provides approximations for the dynamics of\nnonrelativistic classical particle states within unconstrained quantum field\ntheory (UQFT).\n", "  A model is proposed for the spectrum of $\\Lambda$ hypernuclei based on the\n$u(3)\\times u(2)$ Lie algebra, in which the internal degrees of freedom of the\nspin-1/2 $\\Lambda$ particle are treated in the Fermionic $u(2)$ scheme, while\nthe motion of the hyperon inside a nucleus is described in the Bosonic $u(3)$\nharmonic oscillator scheme. Within this model, a simple formula for\nsingle-particle energies of the $\\Lambda$ particle is obtained from the natural\ndynamical symmetry. The formula is applied to the experimental data on the\nreaction spectroscopy for the $^{89}_\\Lambda$Y and $^{51}_\\Lambda$V\nhypernuclei, providing a clear theoretical interpretation of the observed\nstructures.\n", "  We report an experimental study of a magnetic liquid drop deposited on a\nsuperhydrophobic substrate and subjected to vertical vibrations in presence of\na static magnetic field. It is well-known that a flattened drop of usual liquid\ndisplays oscillating lobes at its periphery when vibrated. By adding\nferromagnetic nanoparticles to a water drop and varying the strength of the\nmagnetic field, we are experimentally able to efficiently tune the resonant\nfrequencies of the drop. By using conservation energy arguments, we show that\nthe magnetic field contribution is equivalent to adding an effective negative\nsurface tension to the drop. Our model is found in good agreement with the\nexperiments with no fitting parameter.\n", "  Since the 1970s there has been a large number of countries that combine\nformal democratic institutions with authoritarian practices. Although in such\ncountries the ruling elites may receive considerable voter support they often\nemploy several manipulation tools to control election outcomes. A common\npractice of these regimes is the coercion and mobilization of a significant\namount of voters to guarantee the electoral victory. This electoral\nirregularity is known as voter rigging, distinguishing it from vote rigging,\nwhich involves ballot stuffing or stealing. Here we develop a statistical test\nto quantify to which extent the results of a particular election display traces\nof voter rigging. Our key hypothesis is that small polling stations are more\nsusceptible to voter rigging, because it is easier to identify opposing\nindividuals, there are less eye witnesses, and supposedly less visits from\nelection observers. We devise a general statistical method for testing whether\nvoting behavior in small polling stations is significantly different from the\nbehavior of their neighbor stations in a way that is consistent with the\nwidespread occurrence of voter rigging. Based on a comparative analysis, the\nmethod enables to rule out whether observed differences in voting behavior\nmight be explained by geographic heterogeneities in vote preferences. We\nanalyze 21 elections in ten different countries and find significant anomalies\ncompatible with voter rigging in Russia from 2007-2011, in Venezuela from\n2006-2013, and in Uganda 2011. Particularly disturbing is the case of Venezuela\nwhere these distortions have been outcome-determinative in the 2013\npresidential elections.\n", "  The diameter of a star is a major observable that serves to test the validity\nof stellar structure theories. It is also a difficult observable that is mostly\nobtained with indirect methods since the stars are so remote. Today only ~600\napparent star diameters have been measured by direct methods: optical\ninterferometry and lunar occultations. Accurate star diameters are now required\nin the new field of exoplanet studies, since they condition the planets' sizes\nin transit observations, and recent publications illustrate a visible renewal\nof interest in this topic.\n  Our analysis is based on the modeling of the relationship between measured\nangular diameters and photometries. It makes use of two new reddening-free\nconcepts: a distance indicator called pseudomagnitude, and a quasi-experimental\nobservable that is independent of distance and specific to each star, called\nthe differential surface brightness (DSB). The use of all the published\nmeasurements of apparent diameters that have been collected so far, and a\ncareful modeling of the DSB allow us to estimate star diameters with a median\nstatistical error of 1%, knowing their spectral type and, in the present case,\nthe VJHKs photometries.\n  We introduce two catalogs, the JMMC Measured Diameters Catalog (JMDC),\ncontaining measured star diameters, and the second version of the JMMC Stellar\nDiameter Catalog (JSDC), augmented to about 453000 star diameters. Finally, we\nprovide simple formulas and a table of coefficients to quickly estimate stellar\nangular diameters and associated errors from (V, Ks) magnitudes and spectral\ntypes.\n", "  For a general attractive Probabilistic Cellular Automata on S Z d , we prove\nthat the (time-) convergence towards equilibrium of this Markovian parallel\ndynamics, exponentially fast in the uniform norm, is equivalent to a condition\n(A). This condition means the exponential decay of the inuence from the\nboundary for the invariant measures of the system restricted to nite boxes. For\na class of reversible PCA dynamics on {--1, +1} Z d , with a naturally\nassociated Gibbsian potential $\\varphi$, we prove that a (spatial-) weak mixing\ncondition (WM) for $\\varphi$ implies the validity of the assumption (A); thus\nexponential (time-) ergodicity of these dynamics towards the unique Gibbs\nmeasure associated to $\\varphi$ holds. On some particular examples we state\nthat exponential ergodicity holds as soon as there is no phase transition.\n", "  Structural changes of Li2C2 under pressure were studied by synchrotron x-ray\ndiffraction in a diamond anvil cell under hydrostatic conditions and by using\nevolutionary search methodology for crystal structure prediction. We show that\nthe high-pressure polymorph of Li2C2, which forms from the Immm ground-state\nstructure (Z = 2) at around 15 GPa, adopts an orthorhombic Pnma structure with\nZ = 4. Acetylide C2 dumbbells characteristic of Immm Li2C2 are retained in Pnma\nLi2C2. The structure of Pnma Li2C2 relates closely to the anticotunnite-type\nstructure. C2 dumbbell units are coordinated by nine Li atoms, as compared to\neight in the antifluorite structure of Immm Li2C2. First-principles\ncalculations predict a transition of Pnma Li2C2 at 32 GPa to a topologically\nidentical phase with a higher Cmcm symmetry. The coordination of C2 dumbbell\nunits by Li atoms is increased to 11. The structure of Cmcm Li2C2 relates\nclosely to the Ni2 In-type structure. It is calculated that Cmcm Li2C2 becomes\nmetallic at pressures above 40 GPa. In experiments, however, Pnma Li2C2 is\nsusceptible to irreversible amorphization.\n", "  As the number of detected extrasolar planets increases, exoplanet databases\nbecome a valuable resource, confirming some details about planetary formation,\nbut also challenging our theories with new unexpected properties.\n", "  Formation evaluation of unconventional reservoirs is challenging due to the\ncoexistence of different phases such as kerogen, bitumen, movable and bound\nlight hydrocarbon and water. Current low-frequency (0.05 T) nuclear magnetic\nresonance (NMR) laboratory and logging methods are incapable of quantitatively\nseparating the different phases. We demonstrate the utility of high-field (9 T)\nNMR 2D T1-T2 measurements for separating hydrocarbon and the clay-interacting\naqueous phases in shale based on the difference in the frequency dependence of\nthe spin-lattice relaxation time. Furthermore, we demonstrate 23Na NMR as a\npromising complementary technique to conventional 1H NMR for shale fluid\ntyping, taking advantage of the fact that sodium ions are only present in the\naqueous phase. We validate high-field (9 T) 23Na-1H NMR relaxometry for\nassessing brine-filled porosity and brine salinity in various porous materials,\nincluding porous glass, conventional rocks, clays, and shale, and apply it for\ndifferentiating hydrocarbon versus aqueous components and also the\nclay-associated versus free water in Eagle Ford shale cores. This work lays the\ngroundwork for developing future downhole 23Na-1H NMR logging techniques.\n", "  We study the dynamics of an infinite system of point particles of two types.\nThey perform random jumps in $\\mathbf{R}^d$ in the course of which particles of\ndifferent types repel each other whereas those of the same type do not\ninteract. The states of the system are probability measures on the\ncorresponding configuration space, the global (in time) evolution of which is\nconstructed by means of correlation functions. It is proved that for each\ninitial sub-Poissonian state $\\mu_0$, the states evolve $\\mu_0 \\mapsto \\mu_t$\nin such a way that $\\mu_t$ is sub-Poissonian for all $t>0$. The mesoscopic\n(approximate) description of the evolution of states is also given. The\nstability of translation invariant stationary states is studied. In particular,\nwe show that some of such states can be unstable with respect to\nspace-dependent perturbations.\n", "  In this paper, we consider the heat flow for Yang-Mills connections on\n$\\mathbb{R}^5 \\times SO(5)$. In the $SO(5)-$equivariant setting, the Yang-Mills\nheat equation reduces to a single semilinear reaction-diffusion equation for\nwhich an explicit self-similar blowup solution was found by Weinkove\n\\cite{Wei04}. We prove the nonlinear asymptotic stability of this solution\nunder small perturbations. In particular, we show that there exists an open set\nof initial conditions in a suitable topology such that the corresponding\nsolutions blow up in finite time and converge to a non-trivial self-similar\nblowup profile on an unbounded domain. Convergence is obtained in suitable\nSobolev norms and in $L^{\\infty}$.\n", "  Micro-channel plate (MCP)-based photodetectors are capable of picosecond\nlevel time resolution and sub-mm level position resolution, which makes them a\nperfect candidate for the next generation large area photodetectors. The\nlarge-area picosecond photodetector (LAPPD) collaboration is developing new\ntechniques for making large-area photodetectors based on new MCP fabrication\nand functionalization methods. A small single tube processing system (SmSTPS)\nwas constructed at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) for developing scalable,\ncost-effective, glass-body, 6 cm x 6 cm, picosecond photodetectors based on\nMCPs functionalized by Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD). Recently, a number of\nfully processed and hermitically sealed prototypes made of MCPs with 20 micron\npores have been fabricated. This is a significant milestone for the LAPPD\nproject. These prototypes were characterized with a pulsed laser test facility.\nWithout optimization, the prototypes have shown excellent results: The time\nresolution is ~57 ps for single photoelectron mode and ~15 ps for\nmulti-photoelectron mode; the best position resolution is < 0.8 mm for large\npulses. In this paper, the tube processing system, the detector assembly,\nexperimental setup, data analysis and the key performance will be presented.\n", "  We consider a generalization of the non-Hermitian ${\\mathcal PT}$ symmetric\nJaynes-Cummings {Hamiltonian, recently introduced for studying optical\nphenomena with time-dependent physical parameters, that includes\nenvironment-induced decay}. In particular, we investigate the interaction of a\ntwo-level fermionic system (such as a two-level atom) with a single bosonic\nfield mode in a cavity. The states of {the} two-level system are allowed to\ndecay because of the interaction with the environment, {and this is included\nphenomenologically in our non-Hermitian Hamiltonian by introducing complex\nenergies for the fermion system. We focus our attention} on the occurrence of\nexceptional points in the spectrum of the Hamiltonian, clarifying its\nmathematical and physical meaning.\n", "  We treat the canonical commutation relations and the conventional calculus\nbased on it as an algebraic syntax of quantum mechanics and establish a\ngeometric semantics of this syntax. This leads us to a geometric model, the\nspace of states with the action of time evolution operators, which is a limit\nof finite models. The finitary nature of the space allows to give a precise\nmeaning and calculate various classical quantum mechanical quantities.\n", "  The predictions of the multiple burst accretion model of chemical evolution\nare compared to the observations of the stellar masses and metallicities of\nstar-forming galaxies. With the addition of one parameter, the model can\naccount for the observations of the star-forming galaxies if the observations\nof the galaxies are identified with the star bursting behaviour of the model.\nThis consistency with the model holds only if galaxy downsizing is assumed to\noccur.\n", "  In this review we consider first order gravity in four dimensions. In\nparticular, we focus our attention in formulations where the fundamental\nvariables are a tetrad $e_a^I$ and a SO(3,1) connection ${\\omega_{aI}}^J$. We\nstudy the most general action principle compatible with diffeomorphism\ninvariance. This implies, in particular, considering besides the standard\nEinstein-Hilbert-Palatini term, other terms that either do not change the\nequations of motion, or are topological in nature. Having a well defined action\nprinciple sometimes involves the need for additional boundary terms, whose\ndetailed form may depend on the particular boundary conditions at hand. In this\nwork, we consider spacetimes that include a boundary at infinity, satisfying\nasymptotically flat boundary conditions and/or an internal boundary satisfying\nisolated horizons boundary conditions. We focus on the covariant Hamiltonian\nformalism where the phase space $\\Gamma$ is given by solutions to the equations\nof motion. For each of the possible terms contributing to the action we\nconsider the well posedness of the action, its finiteness, the contribution to\nthe symplectic structure, and the Hamiltonian and Noether charges. For the\nchosen boundary conditions, standard boundary terms warrant a well posed\ntheory. Furthermore, the boundary and topological terms do not contribute to\nthe symplectic structure, nor the Hamiltonian conserved charges. The Noether\nconserved charges, on the other hand, do depend on such additional terms. The\naim of this manuscript is to present a comprehensive and self-contained\ntreatment of the subject, so the style is somewhat pedagogical. Furthermore,\nalong the way we point out and clarify some issues that have not been clearly\nunderstood in the literature.\n", "  Relativistic dipolar to hexadecapolar polarizabilities of the ground state\nand some excited states of hydrogenic atoms are calculated by using numerically\nexact energies and wave functions obtained from the Dirac equation with the\nLagrange-mesh method. This approach is an approximate variational method taking\nthe form of equations on a grid because of the use of a Gauss quadrature\napproximation. The partial polarizabilities conserving the absolute value of\nthe quantum number $\\kappa$ are also numerically exact with small numbers of\nmesh points. The ones where $|\\kappa|$ changes are very accurate when using\nthree different meshes for the initial and final wave functions and for the\ncalculation of matrix elements. The polarizabilities of the $n=2$ excited\nstates of hydrogenic atoms are also studied with a separate treatment of the\nfinal states that are degenerate at the nonrelativistic approximation. The\nmethod provides high accuracies for polarizabilities of a particle in a Yukawa\npotential and is applied to a hydrogen atom embedded in a Debye plasma.\n", "  Non-linear voter models assume that the opinion of an agent depends on the\nopinions of its neighbors in a non-linear manner. This allows for voting rules\ndifferent from majority voting. While the linear voter model is known to reach\nconsensus, non-linear voter models can result in the coexistence of opposite\nopinions. Our aim is to derive approximations to correctly predict the time\ndependent dynamics, or at least the asymptotic outcome, of such local\ninteractions. Emphasis is on a probabilistic approach to decompose the opinion\ndistribution in a second-order neighborhood into lower-order probability\ndistributions. This is compared with an analytic pair approximation for the\nexpected value of the global fraction of opinions and a mean-field\napproximation. Our reference case are averaged stochastic simulations of a\none-dimensional cellular automaton. We find that the probabilistic second-order\napproach captures the dynamics of the reference case very well for different\nnon-linearities, i.e for both majority and minority voting rules, which only\npartly holds for the first-order pair approximation and not at all for the\nmean-field approximation. We further discuss the interesting phenomenon of a\ncorrelated coexistence, characterized by the formation of large domains of\nopinions that dominate for some time, but slowly change.\n", "  A promising route to tailoring the electronic properties of quantum materials\nand devices rests on the idea of orbital engineering in multilayered oxide\nheterostructures. Here we show that the interplay of interlayer charge\nimbalance and ligand distortions provides a knob for tuning the sequence of\nelectronic levels even in intrinsically stacked oxides. We resolve in this\nregard the $d$-level structure of layered Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ by electron spin\nresonance. While canonical ligand-field theory predicts $g_{\\parallel}$-factors\n$\\!<\\!2$ for positive tetragonal distortions as present in Sr$_2$IrO$_4$, the\nexperiment indicates $g_{\\parallel}\\!>\\!2$. This implies that the iridium $d$\nlevels are inverted with respect to their normal ordering. State-of-the-art\nelectronic-structure calculations confirm the level switching in Sr$_2$IrO$_4$,\nwhereas we find them in Ba$_2$IrO$_4$ to be instead normally ordered. Given the\nnonpolar character of the metal-oxygen layers, our findings highlight the\ntetravalent transition-metal 214 oxides as ideal platforms to explore\n$d$-orbital reconstruction in the context of oxide electronics.\n", "  We investigate the spread of an infection or other malfunction of cascading\nnature when a system component can recover only if it remains reachable from a\nfunctioning central component. We consider the susceptible-infected-susceptible\nmodel, typical of mathematical epidemiology, on a network. Infection spreads\nfrom infected to healthy nodes, with the addition that infected nodes can only\nrecover when they remain connected to a predefined central node, through a path\nthat contains only healthy nodes. In this system, clusters of infected nodes\nwill absorb their noninfected interior because no path exists between the\ncentral node and encapsulated nodes. This gives rise to the simultaneous\ninfection of multiple nodes. Interestingly, the system converges to only one of\ntwo stationary states: either the whole population is healthy or it becomes\ncompletely infected. This simultaneous cluster infection can give rise to\ndiscontinuous jumps of different sizes in the number of failed nodes. Larger\njumps emerge at lower infection rates. The network topology has an important\neffect on the nature of the transition: we observed hysteresis for networks\nwith dominating local interactions. Our model shows how local spread can\nabruptly turn uncontrollable when it disrupts connectivity at a larger spatial\nscale.\n", "  Al/ maleic anhydride (MA) /p-Si organic Schottky devices were fabricated on a\np-Si semiconductor wafer by spin coating. The frequency and voltage dependent\ndielectric constant of Al/MA/p-Si have been investigated. Dielectric properties\nand electrical conductivity of contact structures have been investigated in\ndetail by using spectroscopic technique in a wide range of frequencies and\napplied bias voltages at room temperature. The values of dielectric constant,\ndielectric loss, dielectric loss tangent, real and imaginary parts of the\nelectrical modulus and ac electrical conductivity were found considerably\nsensitive to frequency and applied bias voltage especially in depletion and\naccumulation regions. Experimental results indicate that the values of\ndielectric constant show a steep decrease with increasing frequency for each\nvoltage. The values of dielectric loss as a function of voltage show a jump,\nand dielectric loss decreases with decreasing voltage and increasing frequency.\nThe weak increasing of the ac electrical conductivity on frequency is observed.\nThe real part of electric modulus increases with increasing frequency. Also,\nthe imaginary part of electric modulus shows a peak and the peak position\nshifts to higher frequency with increasing applied voltage. It can be concluded\nthat the interfacial polarization can be more easily occurred at low\nfrequencies and the majority of interface states at metal semiconductor\ninterface contributes to deviation of dielectric properties of Al/MA/p-Si\nstructures.\n", "  We study waves governed by the planar Helmholtz equation, propagating in an\ninfinite lattice of subwavelength Dirichlet scatterers, the periodicity being\ncomparable to the wavelength. Applying the method of matched asymptotic\nexpansions, the scatterers are effectively replaced by asymptotic point\nconstraints. The resulting coarse-grained Bloch-wave dispersion problem is\nsolved by a generalised Fourier series, whose singular asymptotics in the\nvicinities of scatterers yield the dispersion relation governing modes that are\nstrongly perturbed from plane-wave solutions existing in the absence of the\nscatterers; there are also empty-lattice waves that are only weakly perturbed.\nCharacterising the latter is useful in interpreting and potentially designing\nthe dispersion diagrams of such lattices. The method presented, that simplifies\nand expands on Krynkin & McIver [Waves Random Complex, 19 347 2009], could be\napplied in the future to study more sophisticated designs entailing resonant\nsubwavelength elements distributed over a lattice with periodicity on the order\nof the operating wavelength.\n", "  Here we report the possible signature of Dirac fermions in the\nmagnetoresistance, Hall resistivity and magnetothermopower of LaAgSb$_2$. The\nopposite sign between Hall resistivity and Seebeck coefficient indicates the\nmultiband effect. Electronic structure calculation reveals the existence of the\nlinear bands and the parabolic bands crossing the Fermi level. The large linear\nmagnetoresistance was attributed to the quantum limit of the possible Dirac\nfermions or the breakdown of weak-field magnetotransport at the charge density\nwave phase transition. Analysis of Hall resistivity using two-band model\nreveals that Dirac holes which dominate the electronic transport have much\nhigher mobility and larger density than conventional electrons. Magnetic field\nsuppresses the apparent Hall carrier density, and also induces the sign change\nof the Seebeck coefficient from negative to positive. These effects are\npossibly attributed to the magnetic field suppression of the density of states\nat the Fermi level originating from the quantum limit of the possible Dirac\nholes.\n", "  We present the first high angular resolution study of giant molecular clouds\n(GMCs) in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 300, based on observations from the\nSubmillimeter Array (SMA). We target eleven 500 pc-sized regions of active star\nformation within the galaxy in the CO(J=2-1) line at 40 pc spatial and 1 km/s\nspectral resolution and identify 45 individual GMCs. We characterize the\nphysical properties of these GMCs, and find that they are similar to GMCs in\nthe disks of the Milky Way and other nearby spiral galaxies. For example, the\nGMC mass spectrum in our sample has a slope of 1.80+/-0.07. Twelve clouds are\nspatially resolved by our observations, of which ten have virial mass estimates\nthat agree to within a factor of two with mass estimates derived directly from\nCO integrated intensity, suggesting that the majority of these GMCs are bound.\nThe resolved clouds show consistency with Larson's fundamental relations\nbetween size, linewidth, and mass observed in the Milky Way. We find that the\nlinewidth scales with the size as DeltaV ~ R^(0.52+/-0.20), and the median\nsurface density in the subsample is 54 Msun/pc^(-2). We detect 13CO in four\nGMCs and find a mean 12CO/13CO flux ratio of 6.2. Our interferometric\nobservations recover between 30% and 100% of the integrated intensity from the\nAPEX single dish CO observations of Faesi et al. 2014, suggesting the presence\nof low-mass GMCs and/or diffuse gas below our sensitivity limit. The fraction\nof APEX emission recovered increases with the SMA total intensity as well as\nwith the star formation rate.\n", "  In the Symmetries of Feynman Integrals (SFI) approach, a diagram's parameter\nspace is foliated by orbits of a Lie group associated with the diagram. SFI is\nrelated to the important methods of Integrations By Parts and of Differential\nEquations. It is shown that sometimes there exist a locus in parameter space\nwhere the set of SFI differential equations degenerates into an algebraic\nequation, thereby enabling a solution in terms of integrals associated with\ndegenerations of the diagram. This is demonstrated by the two-loop vacuum\ndiagram, where the algebraic locus can be interpreted as a threshold phenomenon\nand is given by the zeros of the Baikov polynomial. In addition, the symmetry\ngroup is interpreted geometrically as linear transformations of loop currents\nwhich preserve the subspace of squared currents within the space of quadratics\nin loop currents.\n", "  Time-dependent entanglement entropy (EE) is computed for a single interval in\ntwo-dimensional conformal theories from a quenched initial state in the\npresence of spatial boundaries. The EE is found to be periodic in time with\nperiodicity equal to the system size $L$. For large enough $L$, the EE shows a\nrise to a thermal value (characterized by a temperature $1/\\beta$ determined by\nthe initial state), followed by periodic returns to the original value. This\nworks irrespective of whether the conformal field theory (CFT) is rational or\nirrational. For conformal field theories with a holographic dual, the large $c$\nlimit plays an essential role in ensuring that the EE computed from the CFT is\nuniversal (independent of the details of the CFT and of boundary conditions)\nand is exactly matched by the holographic EE. The dual geometry is computed and\nit interpolates between a BTZ black hole at large $L$ and global AdS at large\n$\\beta$.\n", "  Recently, the theory of Topologically massive gravity non-minimally coupled\nto a scalar field has been proposed which comes from Lorentz-Chern-Simons\ntheory \\cite{1}. That theory is a torsion free one. We extend that theory by\nadding an extra term which makes torsion to be non-zero. The extended theory\ncan be regarded as an extension of Minimal massive gravity such that it is\nnon-minimally coupled to a scalar field. We obtain equations of motion of\nextended theory such that they are expressed in terms of usual torsion free\nspin-connection. We show that BTZ spacetime is a solution of this theory when\nscalar field is constant. We define quasi-local conserved charge by the concept\nof generalized off-shell ADT current which both are conserved for any\nasymptotically Killing vector field as well as a Killing vector field which is\nadmitted by spacetime everywhere. Also we find general formula for entropy of\nstationary black hole solution in the context of considered theory. We apply\nthe obtained formulas on BTZ black hole solution, to calculate energy, angular\nmomentum and entropy of this soultion. We obtain the central extension term,\nthe central charges and the eigenvalues of the Virasoro algebra generators for\nthe BTZ black hole solution. We calculate energy and angular momentum of BTZ\nblack hole using the eigenvalues of the Virasoro algebra generators. Also we\ncalculate the entropy of BTZ black hole by using the Cardy formula. We find\nthat obtained results using two different ways are exactly matched as we\nexpected.\n", "  We classify three dimensional isolated weighted homogeneous rational complete\nintersection singularities, which define many new four dimensional N=2\nsuperconformal field theories. We also determine the mini-versal deformation of\nthese singularities, and therefore solve the Coulomb branch spectrum and\nSeiberg-Witten solution.\n", "  [Abridged] Whether technological societies remain small and planet-bound like\nour own, or ultimately span across galaxies is an open question in the Search\nfor Extraterrestrial Intelligence. Societies that engineer on a galactic scale\nare classified as Type III on Kardashev's scale. I argue that Type III\nsocieties can take the form of blackboxes, entire galaxies veiled in an opaque\nscreen. A blackbox has a temperature that is just above that of the cosmic\nmicrowave background. The screen can be made from artificial dust pervading the\ngalaxy. I show that there is enough material in galaxies to build blackboxes if\nthe dust is fashioned into dipole antennas. The thermal emission of a blackbox\nmakes it a bright microwave source. I examine the Planck Catalog of Compact\nSources to constrain the abundance of blackboxes. None of the 100 GHz sources\nhas the spectrum expected of a blackbox. The null result rules out shrouded\ngalaxy clusters out to z ~ 1 and shrouded Milky Ways out to (comoving) 700 Mpc.\nThe reach of the results includes 3 million galaxies containing an estimated\n300 quadrillion terrestrial planets, as well as tens of thousands of galaxy\nclusters. Combined with the null results from other searches for Type III\nsocieties, I conclude that they are so rare that they basically do not exist\nwithin the observable Universe. A hypothesis of \"Cosmic Pessimism\" is\ndiscussed, in which we are alone, our long-term chances for survival are slim,\nand if we do survive, our future history will be checkered. Our loneliness is\nsuggested by the lack of Type III societies. I discuss the remaining forms of\nType III societies not yet well constrained by observation. I argue that the\nease of building blackboxes on planetary and Solar System scales may lead,\nwithin a few centuries, to environmental catastrophes vastly more devastating\nthan anything we are doing now, boding ill for us.\n", "  Recognition and determination of paraquat (PQ) using graphite pencil\nelectrode (GPE) modified with polypyrrole (Ppy) doped with Eriochrome\nblue-black B (EBB) is reported. To that end, a thin film of Ppy was deposited\nonto the electrode surface by electropolymerization in the presence of a\nfunctional doping ion, EBB. The Ppy/EBB-coated electrode was templated by PQ\nion and then the performance of the molecularly imprinted EBB/Ppy/GPE was\nevaluated by voltammetric technique. The prepared electrode exhibited\nconsiderable increase in electroactivity of the sensor toward this herbicide\ncompared to the non-imprinted electrode. To enhance the detection capability of\nthe prepared system, the factors controlling its response were investigated and\noptimized using differential pulse voltammetry. The proposed analytical\nprocedure was proved to be applicable in the concentration range of 5 to 50\n{\\mu}M (R^2 = 0.9939) and detection limit of (3{\\sigma}) 0.22 {\\mu}M.\nUltimately, the proposed analytical methodology was applied to ascertain\npossible interferences and investigate real samples of dam water. Recovery\nfactors were achieved between the range of 93-104%.\n", "  The MicroBooNE experiment is a liquid argon TPC experiment designed for\nshort-baseline neutrino physics, currently running at Fermilab. Due to its\nlocation near the surface, cosmic muons can be a source of backgrounds to many\nanalyses and having a good understanding of the cosmic rays will be very\nvaluable for the experiment. These proceedings describe the physics motivation,\nsetup, and performance of a small external muon counter system, which will\nprovide improved calibration for the liquid argon TPC and better understanding\nof the cosmogenic background.\n", "  This note is a sequel to the previous series \"Tensor Track I-III\". Assuming\nsome familiarity with the tensor track approach to quantum gravity, we provide\na brief introduction to the developments of the last two years and to their\ncorresponding bibliography. They center around understanding the interface\nbetween random matrices and random tensors through the intermediate field\nrepresentation, finding new types of $1/N$ expansions by enhancing sub-leading\ntensor interactions, exploring the renormalization group flows in the tensor\ntheory space, and developing the constructive aspects of the theory.\n", "  In many theoretical frameworks our visible world is a $3$-brane, embedded in\na multidimensional bulk, possibly coexisting with hidden braneworlds. Some\nworks have also shown that matter swapping between braneworlds can occur. Here\nwe report the results of an experiment - at the Institut Laue-Langevin\n(Grenoble, France) - designed to detect thermal neutron swapping to and from\nanother braneworld, thus constraining the probability $p^2$ of such an event.\nThe limit, $p<4.6\\times 10^{-10}$ at $95 \\%$ C.L., is $4$ orders of magnitude\nbetter than the previous bound based on the disappearance of stored ultracold\nneutrons. In the simplest braneworld scenario, for two parallel Planck-scale\nbranes separated by a distance $d$, we conclude that $d>87$ in Planck length\nunits.\n", "  Several locally deterministic interpretations of quantum mechanics are\npresented and reviewed. The fundamental differences between these\ninterpretations are made transparent by explicitly showing what information is\ncarried locally by each physical system in an idealized experimental test of\nBell's theorem. This also shows how each of these models can be locally causal\nand deterministic. First, a model is presented which avoids Bell's arguments\nthrough the assumption that space-time inflated from an initial singularity,\nwhich encapsulates the entire past light cone of every event in the universe.\nFrom this assumption, it is shown how quantum mechanics can produce locally\nconsistent reality by choosing one of many possible futures at the time of the\nsingularity. Secondly, we review and expand the Parallel Lives interpretation\nof Brassard and Raymond-Robichaud, which maintains local causality and\ndeterminism by abandoning the strictest notion of realism. Finally, the two\nideas are combined, resulting in a parallel lives model in which lives branch\napart earlier, under the assumption of a single unified interaction history.\nThe physical content of weak values within each model is discussed, along with\nrelated philosophical issues concerning free will.\n", "  This work is motivated by discrete-to-continuum modeling of the mechanics of\na graphene sheet, which is a single-atom thick macromolecule of carbon atoms\ncovalently bonded to form a hexagonal lattice. The strong covalent bonding\nmakes the sheet essentially inextensible and gives the sheet a resistance to\nbending. We study a one-dimensional atomistic model that describes the\ncross-section of a graphene sheet as a collection of rigid links connected by\ntorsional springs. $\\Gamma$-convergence is used to rigorously justify an\nupscaling procedure for the discrete bending energy of the atomistic model. Our\nresult establishes that as the bond length in the atomistic model goes to 0,\nthe bending energies $\\Gamma$-converge to Euler's elastica.\n", "  We characterize the scale-dependent rheological properties of mucus from the\nChaetopterus marine worm and determine the intrinsic lengthscales controlling\ndistinct rheological and structural regimes. Mucus produced by this ubiquitous\nfilter feeder serves a host of roles including filtration, protection and\ntrapping nutrients. The ease of clean mucus extraction coupled with\nsimilarities to human mucus rheology also make Chaetopterus mucus a potential\nmodel system for elucidating human mucus mechanics. We use optically trapped\nmicrosphere probes of 2-10 microns, to induce oscillatory strains and measure\nmucus stress response. We show that viscoelastic properties are highly\ndependent on the strain scale (l) with three distinct regimes emerging:\nmicroscale: l_1<4 microns, mesoscale: l_2~4-10 microns, and macroscale: l_3>10\nmicrons. While mucus response is similar to water for l_1 indicating that\nprobes rarely contact the mucus mesh, for l_2 the response is distinctly more\nviscous and independent of probe size, demonstrating that the mucus behaves as\na continuum. However, this principally viscous mesoscale response is distinct\nfrom the largely elastic macroscopic mucus response. Only for l_3 does the\nresponse mimic macroscopic elasticity, with rigid constraints strongly\nresisting microsphere displacement. Our results demonstrate that a uniform mesh\nmodel for mucus with a single lengthscale modulating the crossover from\nwater-like to elastic is too simplistic. Rather, the mucus responds as a\nhierarchical network with a loose microscopic mesh controlling mechanics for\nl_2, coupled with a mesoscale rigid scaffold responsible for the macroscopic\ngel-like mechanics beyond l_3. Our results shed important new light onto the\ndesign of drug delivery platforms, preventing pathogen penetration, and\nimproving filtration, coating and clearance capabilities of mucus.\n", "  Optimal state transfer of a single two-level system (TLS) coupled to an Ohmic\nboson bath via off-diagonal TLS-bath coupling is studied by using optimal\ncontrol theory. In the weak system-bath coupling regime where the\ntime-dependent Bloch-Redfield formalism is applicable, we obtain the Bloch\nequation to probe the evolution of the dissipative TLS in the presence of a\ntime-dependent external control field. By using the automatic differentiation\ntechnique to compute the gradient for the cost functional, we calculate the\noptimal transfer integral profile that can achieve an ideal transfer within a\ndimer system in the FennaMatthews-Olson (FMO) model. The robustness of the\ncontrol profile against temperature variation is also analyzed.\n", "  We systematically analyze the broadband (0.5--200 keV) X-ray spectra of hard\nX-ray ($>10$ keV) selected local low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs)\nobserved with {\\it Suzaku} and {\\it Swift}/BAT. The sample consists of ten\nLLAGNs detected with {\\it Swift}/BAT with intrinsic 14--195 keV luminosities\nsmaller than $10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ available in the {\\it Suzaku} archive,\ncovering a wide range of the Eddington ratio from $10^{-5}$ to $10^{-2}$. The\noverall spectra can be reproduced with an absorbed cut-off power law, often\naccompanied by reflection components from distant cold matter, and/or\noptically-thin thermal emission from the host galaxy. In all objects,\nrelativistic reflection components from the innermost disk are not required.\nEight objects show a significant narrow iron-K$\\alpha$ emission line. Comparing\ntheir observed equivalent widths with the predictions from the Monte-Carlo\nbased torus model by \\cite{Ike09}, we constrain the column density in the\nequatorial plane to be $\\log N^{\\rm eq}_{\\rm H} > 22.7$ or the torus half\nopening angle $\\theta_{\\rm oa} < 70^\\circ$. We infer that the Eddington ratio\n($\\lambda_{\\rm Edd}$) is a key parameter that determines the torus structure of\nLLAGNs: the torus becomes large at $\\lambda_{\\rm Edd} \\gtrsim 2\\times10^{-4}$,\nwhereas at lower accretion rates it is little developed. The luminosity\ncorrelation between the hard X-ray and mid-infrared (MIR) bands of the LLAGNs\nfollows the same one as for more luminous AGNs. This implies that other\nmechanisms than AGN-heated dust are responsible for the MIR emission in low\nEddington ratio LLAGNs.\n", "  Intrinsic electrical and excitonic properties of monolayer transition metal\ndichalcogenides are studied on CYTOP fluoropolymer substrates with greatly\nsuppressed unintentional doping and dielectric screening. Ambipolar transport\nbehavior is observed in monolayer WS2 by applying solid states backdates. The\nexcitonic properties of monolayer MoS2 and WS2 are determined by intricate\ninterplays between the bandage renormalization, Pauli blocking and carrier\nscreening against carrier doping.\n", "  Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have found plenty of applications in electronics,\nsensing, actuation, mechanical structures, etc. There is a growing demand to\nproduce large scale arrays of CNTs that can satisfy the requirements of cost\neffective, quick and relatively simpler methods of growth. The other\nconflicting requirement is to produce very high quality of CNTs in very high\ndensities and volumes. There has been considerable research that has gone into\nresolving the above mentioned issues. Here we show that a significantly simple\nand quick method of growing CNTs using Al-Fe thin film catalysts can also\nproduce very dense and tall forests of vertically aligned CNTs that can be\ngrown very uniformly over a substrate. We further show that this can be easily\ntransferred onto a flexible substrate like an adhesive tape.\n", "  In this work, we report numerical simulations and experiments of the optical\nresponse of a gold nanostrip embedded in a silicon strip waveguide gap at\ntelecom wavelengths. We show that the spectral features observed in\ntransmission and reflection when the metallic nanostructure is inserted in the\ngap are extremely different to those observed in free-space excitation. First,\nwe find that interference between the guided field and the electric dipolar\nresonance of the metallic nanostructure results in high-contrast (> 10)\nspectral features showing an asymmetric Fano spectral profile. Secondly, we\nreveal a crossing in the transmission and reflection responses close to the\nnanostructure resonance wavelength as a key feature of our system. This\napproach, which can be realized using standard semiconductor nanofabrication\ntools, could lead to fully exploit the extreme properties of subwavelength\nmetallic nanostructures in an on-chip configuration, with special relevance in\nfields such as biosensing or optical switching.\n", "  In this article we review results of computer simulation of glasses carried\nout using first principles approaches, notably density functional theory. We\nstart with a brief introduction to this method and compare the pros and cons of\nthis approach with the ones of simulations with classical potentials. This is\nfollowed by a discussion of simulation results of various glass-forming systems\nthat have been obtained via ab initio simulations and that demonstrate the\nusefulness of this approach to understand the properties of glasses on the\nmicroscopic level.\n", "  We study numerically the roughening properties of an interface in a\ntwo-dimensional Ising model with either random bonds or random fields, which\nare representative of universality classes where disorder acts only on the\ninterface or also away from it, in the bulk. The dynamical structure factor\nshows a rich crossover pattern from the form of a pure system at large\nwavevectors $k$, to a different behavior, typical of the kind of disorder, at\nsmaller $k$'s. For the random field model a second crossover is observed from\nthe typical behavior of a system where disorder is only effective on the\nsurface, as the random bond model, to the truly large scale behavior, where\nbulk-disorder is important, that is observed at the smallest wavevectors.\n", "  The ongoing scientific interest in the properties and structure of electric\ndouble layers (EDLs) stems from their pivotal role in (super)capacitive energy\nstorage, energy harvesting, and water treatment technologies. Classical density\nfunctional theory (DFT) is a promising framework for the study of the in- and\nout-of-plane structural properties of double layers. Supported by molecular\ndynamics simulations, we demonstrate the adequate performance of DFT for\nanalyzing charge layering in the EDL perpendicular to the electrodes. We\ndiscuss charge storage and capacitance of the EDL and the impact of screening\ndue to dielectric solvents. We further calculate, for the first time, the\nin-plane structure of the EDL within the framework of DFT. While our\nout-of-plane results already hint at structural in-plane transitions inside the\nEDL, which have been observed recently in simulations and experiments, our DFT\napproach performs poorly in predicting in-plane structure in comparison to\nsimulations. However, our findings isolate fundamental issues in the\ntheoretical description of the EDL within the primitive model and point towards\nlimitations in the performance of DFT in describing the out-of-plane structure\nof the EDL at high concentrations and potentials.\n", "  We discuss various properties of Probabilistic Cellular Automata, such as the\nstructure of the set of stationary measures and multiplicity of stationary\nmeasures (or phase transition) for reversible models.\n", "  The ultraviolet structure of $s$-channel mediator dark matter simplified\nmodels at hadron colliders is considered. In terms of commonly studied\n$s$-channel mediator simplified models it is argued that at arbitrarily high\nenergies the perturbative description of dark matter production in high energy\nscattering at hadron colliders will break down in a number of cases. This is\nanalogous to the well documented breakdown of an EFT description of dark matter\ncollider production. With this in mind, to diagnose whether or not the use of\nsimplified models at the LHC is valid, perturbative unitarity of the scattering\namplitude in the processes relevant to LHC dark matter searches is studied. The\nresults are as one would expect: at the LHC and future proton colliders the\nsimplified model descriptions of dark matter production are in general valid.\nAs a result of the general discussion, a simple new class of previously\nunconsidered `Fermiophobic Scalar' simplified models is proposed, in which a\nscalar mediator couples to electroweak vector bosons. The Fermiophobic\nsimplified model is well motivated and exhibits interesting collider and direct\ndetection phenomenology.\n", "  After the {\\em Solar and Heliospheric Observatory} ({\\em SOHO}) was launched\nin 1996, the aboard Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) observed a\nglobal coronal wave phenomenon, which was initially named \"EIT wave\" after the\ntelescope. The bright fronts are immediately followed by expanding dimmings. It\nhas been shown that the brightenings and dimmings are mainly due to plasma\ndensity increase and depletion, respectively. Such a spectacular phenomenon\nsparked long-lasting interest and debates. The debates were concentrated on two\ntopics, one is about the driving source, and the other is about the nature of\nthis wavelike phenomenon. The controversies are most probably because there may\nexist two types of large-scale coronal waves that were not well resolved before\nthe {\\em Solar Dynamics Observatory} ({\\em SDO}) was launched: one is a\npiston-driven shock wave straddling over the erupting coronal mass ejection\n(CME), and the other is an apparently propagating front, which may correspond\nto the CME frontal loop. Such a two-wave paradigm was proposed more than 13\nyears ago, and now is being recognized by more and more colleagues. In this\npaper, we review how various controversies can be resolved in the two-wave\nframework and how important it is to have two different names for the two types\nof coronal waves.\n", "  An overview of recent developments in \\pythia~8 is given. First the new hard\ndiffraction model, which is implemented as a part of the multiparton\ninteractions (MPI) framework, is discussed. Then the new colour reconnection\nmodel, which includes beyond leading colour effects that can become important\nwhen MPI are present, is briefly reviewed. As a last topic an introduction is\ngiven to our implementation of photon-photon collisions. In particular photon\nPDFs, required modifications for the initial state radiation algorithm and beam\nremnant handling with photon beams is discussed.\n", "  Since the number of dark energy models have rapidly increased over the last\nyears, some model-independent methods have been developed in order to analyse\nthe cosmological evolution in a phenomenological way. In this manuscript, we\nanalyse some of these approaches and their shortcomings to provide reliable\ninformation.\n", "  Subarcsecond-resolution images of the rotational line emissions of CS and\nc-C$_3$H$_2$ obtained toward the low-mass protostar IRAS 04368$+$2557 in L1527\nwith the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array are investigated to\nconstrain the orientation of the outflow/envelope system. The distribution of\nCS consists of an envelope component extending from north to south and a faint\nbutterfly-shaped outflow component. The kinematic structure of the envelope is\nwell reproduced by a simple ballistic model of an infalling rotating envelope.\nAlthough the envelope has a nearly edge-on configuration, the inclination angle\nof the rotation axis from the plane of the sky is found to be 5$^\\circ$, where\nwe find that the western side of the envelope faces the observer. This\nconfiguration is opposite to the direction of the large-scale ($\\sim$ 10$^4$\nAU) outflow suggested previously from the $^{12}$CO ($J$=3$-$2) observation,\nand to the morphology of infrared reflection near the protostar ($\\sim$ 200\nAU). The latter discrepancy could originate from high extinction by the outflow\ncavity of the western side, these discrepancies or may indicate that the\noutflow axis is not parallel to the rotation axis of the envelope.\nPosition-velocity diagrams show the accelerated outflow cavity wall, and its\nkinematic structure in the 2000 AU scale is explained by a standard parabolic\nmodel with the inclination angle derived from the analysis of the envelope. The\ndifferent orientation of the outflow between the small and large scale implies\na possibility of precession of the outflow axis. The shape and the velocity of\nthe outflow in the vicinity of the protostar are compared with those of other\nprotostars.\n", "  This thesis explores ways in which quantum channels and correlations (of both\nclassical and quantum types) manifest themselves, and also studies the\ninterplay between these two aspects in various physical settings. Quantum\nchannels represent all possible evolutions of states allowed by quantum\nmechanics while correlations are intrinsic (nonlocal) properties of composite\nsystems. There are four main problems that are addressed (i) the role played by\ninitial system-bath correlations on the subsystem dynamics of an open quantum\nsystem, (ii) computation of correlations for two-qubit X-states, (iii) the\nrobustness of non-Gaussian entanglement under symmetric local noisy attenuator\nand amplifier channels, and finally, (iv) the connection between\nnonclassicality breaking and entanglement breaking for single-mode bosonic\nGaussian channels.\n", "  We compute multiprecision solutions of the Lane-Emden equation. This\ndifferential equation arises when introducing the well-known polytropic model\ninto the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium for a nondistorted star. Since\nsuch multiprecision computations are time-consuming, we apply to this problem\nparallel programming techniques and thus the execution time of the computations\nis drastically reduced.\n", "  We present results of the experimental measurements of the isobaric heat\ncapacity for 1-bromohexane, 1-bromoheptane, 1-bromooctane, 1-bromononane,\n1-bromodecane, 1-bromoundecane, 1-bromododecane and 1-bromo-tetradecane at\nnormal pressure and the speed of sound and the density for 1-bromotetradecane\nwithin the temperature range 298.15--423.15~K. These data on the isobaric heat\ncapacity and the literature-based reference data for the density and the speed\nof sound were used to calculate the isothermal compressibility and the inverse\nreduced fluctuations. Based on the comparison of the results for pure n-alkanes\nand $\\alpha,\\omega$-dibromoalkanes, we discuss the influence of bromine atom on\nthe volume fluctuations.\n", "  Recent data of reactor neutrino experiments set more stringent constraint on\nleptonic mixing patterns. We examine all possible patterns on the basis of\ncombinations of elementary correlations of elements of leptonic mixing matrix.\nwe obtain 62 viable mixing patters at 3$\\sigma$ level of mixing parameters.\nMost of these patterns can be paired via the {\\mu}- interchange which changes\nthe octant of $\\theta_{23}$ and the sign of $\\cos{\\delta}$. All viable patterns\ncan be classified into two groups: the perturbative patterns and\nnon-perturbative patterns. The former can be obtained from perturbing TBM. The\nlatter cannot be obtained from perturbing any mixing pattern whose\n$\\theta_{13}$ is zero. Different predictions of Dirac CP phase $\\delta$ of\nthese two types of mixing patterns are discussed. Evolutions of mass matrices\nof neutrinos with small mixing parameters are discussed via special mixing\npatterns on the basis of flavor groups. In general cases, a small variation of\n$\\sin\\theta_{13}$ may bring about large modifications to alignment of vacuum\nexpectation values in a mixing model. Therefore, small but nonzero\n$\\sin\\theta_{13}$ brings a severer challenge to leptonic mixing models on the\nbasis of flavor groups than usual views.\n", "  Several powerful techniques for evaluating massless scalar Feynman diagrams\nare developed, viz: the solution of recurrence relations to evaluate diagrams\nwith arbitrary numbers of loops in $n=4-2\\omega$ dimensions; the discovery and\nuse of symmetry properties to restrict and compute Taylor series in $\\omega$;\nthe reduction of triple sums over Chebyshev polynomials to products of Riemann\nzeta functions; the exploitation of conformal invariance to avoid\nfour-dimensional Racah coefficients. As an example of the power of these\ntechniques we evaluate all of the 216 diagrams, with 5 loops or less, which\ngive finite contributions of order $1/k^2$ or $1/k^4$ to a propagator of\nmomentum $k$ in massless four-dimensional scalar field theories. Remarkably,\nonly 5 basic numbers are encountered: $\\zeta(3)$, $\\zeta(5)$, $\\zeta(7)$,\n$\\zeta(9)$ and the value of the most symmetrical diagram, which is calculated\nto 14 significant figures. It is conceivable that these are the only\nirrationals appearing in 6-loop beta functions. En route to these results we\nuncover and only partially explain many remarkable relations between diagrams.\n", "  The electrostatic charge density of particles is of paramount importance for\nthe control of the dispersion stability. Conventional methods use\npotentiometric, conductometric or turbidity titration but require large amount\nof samples. Here we report a simple and cost-effective method called\npolyelectrolyte assisted charge titration spectrometry or PACTS. The technique\ntakes advantage of the propensity of oppositely charged polymers and particles\nto assemble upon mixing, leading to aggregation or phase separation. The mixed\ndispersions exhibit a maximum in light scattering as a function of the\nvolumetric ratio X, and the peak position XMax is linked to the particle charge\ndensity according to {\\sigma} ~ D0 XMax where D0 is the particle diameter. The\nPACTS is successfully applied to organic latex, aluminum and silicon oxide\nparticles of positive or negative charge using poly(diallyldimethylammonium\nchloride) and poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate). The protocol is also optimized\nwith respect to important parameters such as pH and concentration, and to the\npolyelectrolyte molecular weight. The advantages of the PACTS technique are\nthat it requires minute amounts of sample and that it is suitable to a broad\nvariety of charged nano-objects.\n", "  Practical aspects of the robust method we recently proposed for producing\nfew-cycle attosecond pulses with arbitrary waveform in the extreme ultraviolet\nspectral range are studied numerically. It is based on the undulator radiation\nof relativistic ultrathin electron layers produced by inverse free-electron\nlaser process. Optimal conditions for nanobunching are given; attosecond pulse\nenergy and waveform, and their stability are studied. For K=0.8 undulator\nparameter, carrier-envelope-phase stable pulses with >45 nJ energy and 80 as\nduration at 20 nm, and >250 nJ energy and 240 as duration at 60 nm are\npredicted with 31 mrad and 13 mrad phase stability, respectively.\n", "  We propose an innovative design for a vector magnet compatible with neutron\nscattering experiments. This would vastly expand the range of experimental\npossibilities since applying a magnetic field and orienting the sample in\ndiffraction conditions will become completely independent. This Wide Aperture\nVEctor magnet is a setup made of 16 coils, all with a vertical axis. The\nvertical component of the field is produced by two pairs of coaxial coils\ncarrying opposite currents for an active shielding of the stray field, while\nthe horizontal components are generated by 3 sets of 4 coils each, two above\nand two below the diffraction plane. This innovative geometry allows a very\nwide aperture (220$\\,^{\\circ}$ horizontal, $\\pm$ 10$\\,^{\\circ}$ vertical),\nwhich is crucial for neutron diffraction and inelastic neutron scattering\nexperiments. Moreover, the homogeneity of the field is far better than in the\nusual vertical coils, and the diameter of the sample bore is unusually large\n(10 cm).\n  The concept has been developed so as to be used as a sample environment on\nevery LLB instrument relevant for magnetism studies.\n", "  Using the laws of thermodynamics together with empirical data, we present a\nqualitative geometric construction of the fundamental relation of a pure\nsubstance $S = S(E,N,V)$, with $S$ entropy, $E$ energy, $N$ number of particles\nand $V$ volume. We analyze two very general type of substances, a \"normal\" and\na \"quantum\" one, the main difference between them being that the latter\npresents superfluid phases. It is found that the constant entropy level curves\nare completely different in both cases, in the normal substances being obtuse\nwhile acute in quantum ones. A concomitant signature of the previous result is\nthat the chemical potential can be both positive and negative in quantum\nsubstances, but only negative in normal ones. Our results suggest the existence\nof a region in the quantum substances that may be identified as a supersolid\nphase. We also make emphasis on the relevance of the present study within the\ncontext of superfluidity in ultracold gases.\n", "  We present a description of our method to process a set of\nautocollimator-based deflectometer 1-dimensional line-scans taken over a large\noptical surface and reconstruct them to a best-fit conic-section surface. The\nchallenge with our task is that each line-scan is in a different (unknown)\ncoordinate reference frame with respect to the other line-scans in the set.\nThis problem arises due to the limited angular measurement range of the\nautocollimator used in the deflectometer and the need to measure over a greater\nrange; this results in the optic under measurement being rotated (in pitch and\nroll) between each scan to bring the autocollimator back into measurement range\nand therefore each scan is taken in a different coordinate frame. We describe\nan approach using a 6N+2 dimension optimisation (where N is the number of scan\nlines taken across the mirror) that uses a gradient-based non-linear least\nsquares fitting combined with a multi-start global search strategy to find the\nbest-fit surface. Careful formulation of the problem is required to reduce\nnumerical noise and allow the routine to converge on a solution of the required\naccuracy.\n", "  Mixing fronts, where fluids of different chemical compositions mix with each\nother, are typically subjected to velocity gradients, ranging from the pore\nscale to the catchment scale due to permeability variations and flow line\ngeometries. A common trait of these processes is that the mixing interface is\nstrained by shear. Depending on the P\\'eclet number $Pe$, which represents the\nratio of the characteristic diffusion time to the characteristic advection\ntime, and the Damk\\\"ohler number $Da$, which represents the ratio of the\ncharacteristic diffusion time to the characteristic reaction time, the local\nreaction rates can be strongly impacted by the dynamics of the mixing\ninterface. This impact has been characterized mostly either in kinetics-limited\nor in mixing-limited conditions, that is, for either very low or very high\n$Da$. Here the coupling of shear flow and chemical reactivity is investigated\nfor arbitrary Damk\\\"ohler numbers, for a bimolecular reaction and an initial\ninterface with separated reactants. Approximate analytical expressions for the\nglobal production rate and reactive mixing scale are derived based on a\nreactive lamella approach that allows for a general coupling between stretching\nenhanced mixing and chemical reactions. While for $Pe<Da$, reaction kinetics\nand stretching effects are decoupled, a scenario which we name \"weak\nstretching\", for $Pe>Da$, we uncover a \"strong stretching\" scenario where new\nscaling laws emerge from the interplay between reaction kinetics, diffusion,\nand stretching. The analytical results are validated against numerical\nsimulations. These findings shed light on the effect of flow heterogeneity on\nthe enhancement of chemical reaction and the creation of spatially localized\nhotspots of reactivity for a broad range of systems ranging from kinetic\nlimited to mixing limited situations.\n", "  We discuss the state-of-the-art and remaining challenges in the fundamental\nunderstanding and technology development for controlling light-matter\ninteractions in nanophotonic environments in and away from thermal equilibrium.\nThe topics covered range from the basics of the thermodynamics of light\nemission and absorption, to applications in solar-thermal energy generation,\nthermophotovoltaics, optical refrigeration, personalized cooling technologies,\ndevelopment of coherent incandescent light sources, and spinoptics.\n", "  Information physics considers physical laws to result from the consistent\nquantification and processing of information about physical phenomena. In\nprevious efforts, one of us (Knuth) has shown that a simple model of particles\nthat directly influence one another results in a partially ordered set referred\nto as the influence network, from which emerge the Minkowski metric and Lorentz\ntransformations of special relativity. Here, we extend earlier work on receipt\nof influence to the case of one particle influencing another, finding that this\ngives rise to equations of the form of geodesic equations from general\nrelativity in 1+1 dimensions. Future work will test the equivalence of the\ncurrent result to general relativity in 1+1 dimensions.\n", "  Turbulent radiation flow is ubiquitous in many physical systems where\nlight-matter interaction becomes relevant. Photon bubbling, in particular, has\nbeen identified as the main source of turbulent radiation transport in many\nastrophysical objects, such as stars and accretion disks. This mechanism takes\nplace when radiation trapping in optically dense media becomes unstable,\nleading to the energy dissipation from the larger to the smaller bubbles. Here,\nwe report on the observation of photon bubble turbulence in cold atomic gases\nin the presence of multiple scattering of light. The instability is\ntheoretically explained by a fluid description for the atom density coupled to\na diffusive transport equation for the photons, which is known to be accurate\nin the multiple scattering regime investigated here. We determine the power\nspectrum of the atom density fluctuations, which displays an unusual $\\sim\nk^{-4}$ scaling, and entails a complex underlying turbulent dynamics resulting\nfrom the formation of dynamical bubble-like structures. We derive a power\nspectrum from the theoretical photon bubble model which, to a high level of\naccuracy, explains the observations. The experimental results reported here,\nalong with the theoretical model we developed may shed light on the analogue\nphoton bubble instabilities in astrophysical scenarios.\n", "  Direct optical frequency Comb Spectroscopy (DCS) is proving to be a\nfundamental tool in many areas of science and technology thanks to its unique\nperformance in terms of ultra-broadband, high-speed detection and frequency\naccuracy, allowing for high-fidelity mapping of atomic and molecular energy\nstructure. Here we present a novel DCS approach based on a scanning Fabry-Perot\nmicro-cavity resonator (SMART) providing a simple, compact and accurate method\nto resolve the mode structure of an optical frequency comb. The SMART approach,\nwhile drastically reducing system complexity, allows for a straightforward\nabsolute calibration of the optical-frequency axis with an ultimate resolution\nlimited by the micro-resonator resonance linewidth and can be used in any\nspectral region from XUV to THz. An application to high-precision spectroscopy\nof acetylene at 1.54 um is presented, demonstrating frequency resolution as low\nas 20 MHz with a single-scan optical bandwidth up to 1 THz in 20-ms measurement\ntime and a noise-equivalent-absorption level per comb mode of 2.7 10^-9 cm^-1\nHz^(-1/2). Using higher finesse micro-resonators along with an enhancement\ncavity, this technique has the potential to improve by more than one order of\nmagnitude the noise equivalent absorption in a multiterahertz spectral interval\nwith unchanged frequency resolution.\n", "  A summary is presented of the workshop \"top physics at linear colliders\" that\nwas held at IFIC Valencia from the 30th of June to the 3rd July 2015. We\npresent an up-to-date status report of studies into the potential for top quark\nphysics of lepton colliders with an energy reach that exceeds the top quark\npair production threshold, with a focus on the linear collider projects ILC and\nCLIC. This summary shows that such projects can offer very competitive\ndeterminations of top quark properties (mass, width) and its interactions with\nother Standard Model particles, in particular electroweak gauge bosons and the\nHiggs boson. In both areas the prospects exceed the LHC potential significantly\n- often by an order of magnitude.\n", "  All-dielectric photonic quasicrystals may act as zero-refractive-index\nhomogeneous materials despite their lack of translational symmetry and\nperiodicity, stretching wavelengths to infinity and offering applications in\nlight wavefront sculpting and optical cloaking.\n", "  During the design of fixed bed adsorbers, it is vital to understand the\ndynamic adsorption properties of the system. Because temperature is one of the\nmost important factors affecting adsorbent performance, such that the dynamic\nadsorption coefficients tend to increase as the temperature decreases, the\ndynamic adsorption characteristics of Xe on a fixed bed adsorber at 77 K were\nstudied in the present work to minimize the volume of fixed bed adsorber,\nemploying a variety of adsorbents under different operational conditions. The\nresults show that the adsorption performance of carbon molecular sieve is\nsuperior to that of activated carbon. And both operational conditions and the\npresence of gaseous impurities were found to affect adsorption properties.\n", "  The properties of thermal radiation exchange between hot and cold objects can\nbe strongly modified if they interact in the near field where electromagnetic\ncoupling occurs across gaps narrower than the dominant wavelength of thermal\nradiation. Using a rigorous fluctuational electrodynamics approach, we predict\nthat ultra-thin films of plasmonic materials can be used to dramatically\nenhance near-field heat transfer. The total spectrally integrated film-to-film\nheat transfer is over an order of magnitude larger than between the same\nmaterials in bulk form and also exceeds the levels achievable with polar\ndielectrics such as SiC. We attribute this enhancement to the significant\nspectral broadening of radiative heat transfer due to coupling between surface\nplasmon polaritons (SPPs) on both sides of each thin film. We show that the\nradiative heat flux spectrum can be further shaped by the choice of the\nsubstrate onto which the thin film is deposited. In particular, substrates\nsupporting surface phonon polaritons (SPhP) strongly modify the heat flux\nspectrum owing to the interactions between SPPs on thin films and SPhPs of the\nsubstrate. The use of thin film phase change materials on polar dielectric\nsubstrates allows for dynamic switching of the heat flux spectrum between\nSPP-mediated and SPhP-mediated peaks.\n", "  The appearance and disappearance of shells and subshells are determined using\na previously introduced method of structural analysis. This work extends the\napproach and applies it to protons, in addition to neutrons, in an attempt to\nprovide a more complete understanding of shell structure in nuclei.\nExperimental observables including the mean-square charge radius, as well as\nother spectroscopic and mass related quantities are analyzed for extrema. This\nanalysis also uses differential observables among adjacent even-even nuclei to\nserve as the derivatives for these quantities of interest. Local extrema in\nthese quantities indicate shell structure and the lack of local extrema\nindicate missing shell closures. The shell structure of low-mass nuclei is\ninconsistent likely as a consequence of the single-particle structure.\nAdditionally, multiple shell features occurring in midshell regions are\ndetermined by combining information from two or more observables. Our results\nnear stability complement previous observations further out.\n", "  It has been demonstrated for the first time that an existence of acoustic\nanalogue of photonic jet phenomenon, called acoustojet, providing for\nsubwavelength localization of acoustic field in the shadow area of arbitrary 3D\npenetrable mesoscale particle, is possible.\n", "  Capacitance measurements from cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic\nchronopotentiometry and calculation of capacitance from imaginary part of\nimpedance are widely used in investigations of supercapacitors. The methods\nassume the supercapacitor is a capacitor, while real objects correspond to\ndifferent equivalent electric circuits and show various contributions of\nnon-capacitive currents to the current which is used for calculation of\ncapacitance. Specific capacitances which are presented in F g-1 units in\npublications not always refer to electric capacitance. The inadequateness of\nthe capacitance characterization has already resulted in groundless attribution\nto supercapacitors of various systems with electrochemical responses of poorly\nreversible electrochemical reactions. The number of publications that present\nfalse capacitances is terrible and still increases. A widespread neglect of\nenergy dissipation in calculations of specific capacitance leads to further\nconfusion in the characterization of supercapacitors.\n", "  The accessibility of both n-type and p-type MoS2 FET is necessary for\ncomplementary device applications involving MoS2. However, MoS2 PFET is rarely\nachieved due to pinning effect resulting high Rc at metal-MoS2 interface and\nthe inherently strong n-type property of the MoS2 material. In this study, we\nrealized a high-performance multi-layer MoS2 PFET via controllable chemical\ndoping, which has an excellent on/off ratio of 107 and a maximum hole mobility\nof 72 cm2/Vs at room temperature, and these values are further exceeding to 109\nand 132 cm2/Vs at 133K. In addition, we revealed that large Rc hindered the\npolar transition of MoS2 FET from n-type to p-type, meanwhile channel Rs\nlimited Ion of PFET. Therefore it is suggested that reducing Rc at high work\nfunction metal-MoS2 interface and p-type doping of channel were necessary for\nachieving high performance MoS2 PFET. Based on the high performance PFET, we\nsuccessfully demonstrated a MoS2 CMOS inverter by integrating NFET and PFET.\n", "  The response of the Earth's magnetosphere to changing solar wind conditions\nare studied with a 3D Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model. One full year (155\nCluster orbits) of the Earth's magnetosphere is simulated using Grand Unified\nMagnetosphere Ionosphere Coupling simulation (GUMICS-4) magnetohydrodynamic\ncode. Real solar wind measurements are given to the code as input to create the\nlongest lasting global magnetohydrodynamics simulation to date. The\napplicability of the results of the simulation depends critically on the input\nparameters used in the model. Therefore, the validity and the variance of the\nOMNIWeb data is first investigated thoroughly using Cluster measurement close\nto the bow shock. The OMNIWeb and the Cluster data were found to correlate very\nwell before the bow shock. The solar wind magnetic field and plasma parameters\nare not changed significantly from the $L_1$ Lagrange point to the foreshock,\ntherefore the OMNIWeb data is appropriate input to the GUMICS-4. The Cluster\nSC3 footprints are determined by magnetic field mapping from the simulation\nresults and the Tsyganenko (T96) model in order to compare two methods. The\ndetermined footprints are in rather good agreement with the T96. However, it\nwas found that the footprints agree better in the northern hemisphere than the\nsouthern one during quiet conditions. If the By is not zero, the agreement of\nthe GUMICS-4 and T96 footprint is worse in longitude in the southern\nhemisphere. Overall, the study implies that a 3D MHD model can increase our\ninsight of the response of the magnetosphere to solar wind conditions.\n", "  As the amount of information to be transmitted from deep-space rapidly\nincreases, the radiofrequency technology has become a bottleneck in space\ncommunications. RF is already limiting the scientific outcome of deep-space\nmissions and could be a significant obstacle in the developing of manned\nmissions. Lasercom holds the promise to solve this problem, as it will\nconsiderably increase the data rate while decreasing the energy, mass and\nvolume of onboard communication systems. In RF deep-space communications, where\nthe received power is the main limitation, the traditional approach to boost\nthe data throughput has been increasing the receiver's aperture, e.g. the 70-m\nantennas in the NASA's Deep Space Network. Optical communications also can\nbenefit from this strategy, thus 10-m class telescopes have typically been\nsuggested to support future deep-space links. However, the cost of big\ntelescopes increase exponentially with their aperture, and new ideas are needed\nto optimize this ratio. Here, the use of ground-based gamma-ray telescopes,\nknown as Cherenkov telescopes, is suggested. These are optical telescopes\ndesigned to maximize the receiver's aperture at a minimum cost with some\nrelaxed requirements. As they are used in an array configuration and multiple\nidentical units need to be built, each element of the telescope is designed to\nminimize its cost. Furthermore, the native array configuration would facilitate\nthe joint operation of Cherenkov and lasercom telescopes. These telescopes\noffer very big apertures, ranging from several meters to almost 30 meters,\nwhich could greatly improve the performance of optical ground stations. The key\nelements of these telescopes have been studied applied to lasercom, reaching\nthe conclusion that it could be an interesting strategy to include them in the\nfuture development of an optical deep-space network.\n", "  Observational constraints provided by high resolution and high sensitivity\nobservations of external galaxies made in the millimeter and submillimeter\nrange have started to put on a firm ground the study of extragalactic chemistry\nof molecular gas. In particular, the availability of multi-species and\nmulti-line surveys of nearby galaxies is central to the interpretation of\nexistent and forthcoming millimeter observations of the high redshift universe.\nProbing the physical and chemical status of molecular gas in starbursts and\nactive galaxies (AGN) requires the use of specific tracers of the relevant\nenergetic phenomena that are known to be at play in these galaxies: large-scale\nshocks, strong UV fields, cosmic rays and X-rays. We present below the first\nresults of an ongoing survey, allying the IRAM 30m telescope with the Plateau\nde Bure interferometer(PdBI), devoted to study the chemistry of molecular gas\nin a sample of starbursts and AGN of the local universe. These observations\nhighlight the existence of a strong chemical differentiation in the molecular\ndisks of starbursts and AGN.\n", "  We review the present status of black hole thermodynamics. Our review\nincludes discussion of classical black hole thermodynamics, Hawking radiation\nfrom black holes, the generalized second law, and the issue of entropy bounds.\nA brief survey also is given of approaches to the calculation of black hole\nentropy. We conclude with a discussion of some unresolved open issues.\n", "  In this paper we study the stability and quasi-normal modes of scalar\nperturbations of black holes. The static charged black hole considered here is\na solution to Born-Infeld electrodynamics coupled to gravity. We conclude that\nthe black hole is stable. We also compare the stability of it with its linear\ncounter-part Reissner-Nordstrom black hole. The quasi-normal modes are computed\nusing the WKB method. The behavior of these modes with the non-linear\nparameter, temperature, mass of the scalar field and the spherical index are\nanalyzed in detail.\n", "  The spin-field interaction is considered, in the context of the gauge\nfields/string correspondence, in the large 't Hooft coupling limit. The latter\ncan be viewed as a WKB-type approximation to the AdS/CFT duality conjecture.\nBasic theoretical objects entering the present study are (a) the Wilson loop\nfunctional, on the gauge field side and (b) the sigma model action for the\nstring propagating in AdS$_5$. Spin effects are introduced in a worldline\nsetting, via the spin factor for a particle entity propagating on a Wilson loop\ncontour. The computational tools employed for conducting the relevant analysis,\nfollow the methodological guidelines introduced in two papers by Polyakov and\nRychkov. The main result is expressed in terms of the modification of the spin\nfactor brought about by dynamical effects, both perturbative and\nnon-perturbative, according to AdS/CFT in the considered limit.\n", "  We give an exhaustive, non-perturbative classification of exact\ntravelling-wave solutions of a perturbed sine-Gordon equation (on the real line\nor on the circle) which is used to describe the Josephson effect in the theory\nof superconductors and other remarkable physical phenomena. The perturbation of\nthe equation consists of a constant forcing term and a linear dissipative term.\nOn the real line candidate orbitally stable solutions with bounded energy\ndensity are either the constant one, or of kink (i.e. soliton) type, or of\narray-of-kinks type, or of \"half-array-of-kinks\" type. While the first three\nhave unperturbed analogs, the last type is essentially new. We also propose a\nconvergent method of successive approximations of the (anti)kink solution based\non a careful application of the fixed point theorem.\n", "  The applications of the extensions of relativistic mean field (RMF) theory to\nthe rotating frame, such as cranked relativistic mean field (CRMF) theory and\ncranked relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov (CRHB) theory, for the description of\nsuperdeformed bands in the $A\\sim 60$, 140-150 and 190 mass regions are\noverviewed and compared briefly with the results obtained in non-relativistic\nmean field theories.\n"]}
