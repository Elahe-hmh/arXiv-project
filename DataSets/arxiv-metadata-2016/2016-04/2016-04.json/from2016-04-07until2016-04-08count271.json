use Thompson's renormalization group method to treat\nQCD-vacuum behavior close to the regime of asymptotic freedom. QCD-vacuum\nbehaves effectively like a \"paramagnetic system\" of a classical theory in the\nsense that virtual color charges (gluons) emerge in it as spin effect of a\nparamagnetic material when a magnetic field aligns their microscopic magnetic\ndipoles. Making a classical analogy with the paramagnetism of Landau's\ntheory,we are able to introduce a kind of Landau effective action without\ntemperature and phase transition for simply representing QCD-vacuum behavior at\nhigher energies as magnetization of a paramagnetic material in the presence of\na magnetic field H. This reasoning allows us to use Thompson's heuristic\napproach in order to extract an \"effective susceptibility\" ($\\chi>0$) of\nQCD-vacuum. It depends on logarithmic of energy scale u to investigate hadronic\nmatter. Consequently,we are able to get an \"effective magnetic permeability\"\n($\\mu>1$) of such a \"paramagnetic vacuum\". As QCD-vacuum must obey Lorentz\ninvariance,the attainment of $\\mu>1$ must simply require that the \"effective\nelectrical permissivity\" is $\\epsilon<1$,in such a way that $\\mu\\epsilon=1$\n(c^2=1).This leads to the antiscreening effect, where the asymptotic freedom\ntakes place. On the other hand, quarks cofinement, a subject which is not\ntreatable by perturbative calculations, is worked by the present approach. We\napply the method to study this subject in order to obtain the string constant,\nwhich is in agreement with the experiments.\n", "  We use a renormalization group method to treat QCD-vacuum behavior specially\ncloser to the regime of asymptotic freedom. QCD-vacuum behaves effectively like\na \"paramagnetic system\" of a classical theory in the sense that virtual color\ncharges (gluons) emerges in it as a spin effect of a paramagnetic material when\na magnetic field aligns their microscopic magnetic dipoles. Due to that strong\nclassical analogy with the paramagnetism of Landau's theory,we will be able to\nuse a certain Landau effective action without temperature and phase transition\nfor just representing QCD-vacuum behavior at higher energies as being\nmagnetization of a paramagnetic material in the presence of a magnetic field\n$H$. This reasoning will allow us to apply Thompson's approach to such an\naction in order to extract an \"effective susceptibility\" ($\\chi>0$) of\nQCD-vacuum. It depends on logarithmic of energy scale $u$ to investigate\nhadronic matter. Consequently we are able to get an ``effective magnetic\npermeability\" ($\\mu>1$) of such a \"paramagnetic vacuum\". Actually,as QCD-vacuum\nmust obey Lorentz invariance,the attainment of $\\mu>1$ must simply require that\nthe \"effective electrical permissivity\" is $\\epsilon<1$ in such a way that\n$\\mu\\epsilon=1$ ($c^2=1$). This leads to the anti-screening effect where the\nasymptotic freedom takes place. We will also be able to extend our\ninvestigation to include both the diamagnetic fermionic properties of\nQED-vacuum (screening) and the paramagnetic bosonic properties of QCD-vacuum\n(anti-screening) into the same formalism by obtaining a $\\beta$-function at 1\nloop,where both the bosonic and fermionic contributions are considered.\n", "  We consider the method of topological quantization for conservative systems\nwith a finite number of degrees of freedom. Maupertuis' formalism for classical\nmechanics provides an appropriate scenario which permit us to adapt the method\nof topological quantization, originally formulated for gravitational field\nconfigurations. We show that any conservative system in classical mechanics can\nbe associated with a principal fiber bundle. As an application of topological\nquantization we derive expressions for the topological spectra of some simple\nmechanical systems and show that they reproduce the discrete behavior of the\ncorresponding canonical spectra.\n", "  This is the first of a set of papers having the aim to provide a detailed\ndescription of brane configurations on a family of noncompact threedimensional\nCalabi-Yau manifolds. The starting point is the singular manifold C^3/Z_6,\nwhich admits five distinct crepant resolutions. Here we apply local mirror\nsymmetry to partially determine the prepotential encoding the GW-invariants of\nthe resolved varieties. It results that such prepotential provides all numbers\nbut the ones corresponding to curves having null intersection with the compact\ndivisor. This is realized by means of a conjecture, due to S. Hosono, so that\nour results provide a check confirming at least in part the conjecture.\n", "  We evaluate new complexity measures on the symbolic dynamics of coupled tent\nmaps and cellular automata. These measures quantify complexity in terms of\n$k$-th order statistical dependencies that cannot be reduced to interactions\nbetween $k-1$ units. We demonstrate that these measures are able to identify\ncomplex dynamical regimes.\n", "  We investigate exponential families of random graph distributions as a\nframework for systematic quantification of structure in networks. In this paper\nwe restrict ourselves to undirected unlabeled graphs. For these graphs, the\ncounts of subgraphs with no more than k links are a sufficient statistics for\nthe exponential families of graphs with interactions between at most k links.\nIn this framework we investigate the dependencies between several observables\ncommonly used to quantify structure in networks, such as the degree\ndistribution, cluster and assortativity coefficients.\n", "  We clarify some aspects of the geometry of a resolution of the orbifold X =\nC3/D_27, the noncompact complex manifold underlying the brane quiver standard\nmodel recently proposed by Verlinde and Wijnholt. We explicitly realize a map\nbetween X and the total space of the canonical bundle over a degree 1 quasi del\nPezzo surface, thus defining a desingularization of X. Our analysis relys\nessentially on the relationship existing between the normalizer group of D_27\nand the Hessian group and on the study of the behaviour of the Hesse pencil of\nplane cubic curves under the quotient.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the entanglement dynamics and decoherence in\nthe interacting system of a strongly driven two-level atom and a single mode\nvacuum field in the presence of dissipation for the cavity field. Starting with\nan initial product state with the atom in a general pure state and the field in\na vacuum state, we show that the final density matrix is supported on ${\\mathbb\nC}^2\\otimes{\\mathbb C}^2$ space, and therefore, the concurrence can be used as\na measure of entanglement between the atom and the field. The influences of the\ncavity decay on the quantum entanglement of the system are also discussed. We\nalso examine the Bell-CHSH violation between the atom and the field and show\nthat there are entangled states for which the Bell-BCSH inequality is not\nviolated. Using the above system as a quantum channel, we also investigate the\nquantum teleportation of a generic qubit state and also a two-qubit entangled\nstate, and show that in both cases the atom-field entangled state can be useful\nto teleport an unknown state with fidelity better than any classical channel.\n", "  Chaotic multiscale dynamical systems are common in many areas of science, one\nof the examples being the interaction of the low-frequency dynamics in the\natmosphere with the fast turbulent weather dynamics. One of the key questions\nabout chaotic multiscale systems is how the fast dynamics affects chaos at the\nslow variables, and, therefore, impacts uncertainty and predictability of the\nslow dynamics. Here we demonstrate that the linear slow-fast coupling with the\ntotal energy conservation property promotes the suppression of chaos at the\nslow variables through the rapid mixing at the fast variables, both\ntheoretically and through numerical simulations. A suitable mathematical\nframework is developed, connecting the slow dynamics on the tangent subspaces\nto the infinite-time linear response of the mean state to a constant external\nforcing at the fast variables. Additionally, it is shown that the uncoupled\ndynamics for the slow variables may remain chaotic while the complete\nmultiscale system loses chaos and becomes completely predictable at the slow\nvariables through increasing chaos and turbulence at the fast variables. This\nresult contradicts the common sense intuition, where, naturally, one would\nthink that coupling a slow weakly chaotic system with another much faster and\nmuch stronger mixing system would result in general increase of chaos at the\nslow variables.\n", "  Transition Probability (fidelity) for pairs of density operators can be\ndefined as \"functor\" in the hierarchy of \"all\" quantum systems and also within\nany quantum system. The introduction of \"amplitudes\" for density operators\nallows for a more intuitive treatment of these quantities, also pointing to a\nnatural parallel transport. The latter is governed by a remarkable gauge theory\nwith strong relations to the Riemann-Bures metric.\n", "  Many applications of contemporary science involve multiscale dynamics, which\nare typically characterized by the time and space scale separation of patterns\nof motion, with fewer slowly evolving variables and much larger set of faster\nevolving variables. This time-space scale separation causes direct numerical\nsimulation of the evolution of the dynamics to be computationally expensive,\ndue both to the large number of variables and the necessity to choose a small\ndiscretization time step in order to resolve the fast components of dynamics.\nIn this work we propose a simple method of determining the closed model for\nslow variables alone, which requires only a single computation of appropriate\nstatistics for the fast dynamics with a certain fixed state of the slow\nvariables. The method is based on the first-order Taylor expansion of the\naveraged coupling term with respect to the slow variables, which can be\ncomputed using the linear fluctuation-dissipation theorem. We show that, with\nsimple linear coupling in both slow and fast variables, this method produces\nquite comparable statistics to what is exhibited by a complete two-scale model.\nThe main advantage of the method is that it applies even when the statistics of\nthe full multiscale model cannot be simulated due to computational complexity,\nwhich makes it practical for real-world large scale applications.\n", "  Particle-hole continuum (PHC) for massive Dirac fermions in presence of short\nrange interactions, provides an unprecedented opportunity for formation of two\ncollective split-off states, one in the singlet and the other in the triplet\n(spin-1) channel in undoped system. Both poles are close in energy and are\nseparated from thec continuum of free particle-hole excitations by an energy\nscale of the order of gap parameter $\\Delta$. They both disperse linearly with\ntwo different velocities reminiscent of spin-charge separation in Luttinger\nliquids. When the strength of Hubbard interactions is stronger than a critical\nvalue, the velocity of singlet excitation which we interpret as a charge boson\ncomposite becomes zero, and renders the system a Mott insulator. Beyond this\ncritical point, the low-energy sector is left with a linearly dispersing\ntriplet mode -- a characteristic of a Mott insulator. The velocity of triplet\nmode at the Mott criticality is twice the velocity of underlying Dirac\nfermions. The phase transition line in the space of $U$ and $\\Delta$ is in\nqualitative agreement with a more involved dynamical mean field theory (DMFT)\ncalculation.\n", "  Recurrence networks are a novel tool of nonlinear time series analysis\nallowing the characterisation of higher-order geometric properties of complex\ndynamical systems based on recurrences in phase space, which are a fundamental\nconcept in classical mechanics. In this Letter, we demonstrate that recurrence\nnetworks obtained from various deterministic model systems as well as\nexperimental data naturally display power-law degree distributions with scaling\nexponents $\\gamma$ that can be derived exclusively from the systems' invariant\ndensities. For one-dimensional maps, we show analytically that $\\gamma$ is not\nrelated to the fractal dimension. For continuous systems, we find two distinct\ntypes of behaviour: power-laws with an exponent $\\gamma$ depending on a\nsuitable notion of local dimension, and such with fixed $\\gamma=1$.\n", "  Using the invariant form of the equation of geodesic deviation, which\ndescribes relative motion of free test particles, we investigate a general\nfamily of D-dimensional Kundt spacetimes. We demonstrate that local influence\nof the gravitational field can be naturally decomposed into Newton-type tidal\neffects typical for type II spacetimes, longitudinal deformations mainly\npresent in spacetimes of algebraic type III, and type N purely transverse\neffects corresponding to gravitational waves with D(D-3)/2 independent\npolarization states. We explicitly study the most important examples, namely\nexact pp-waves, gyratons, and VSI spacetimes. This analysis helps us to clarify\nthe geometrical and physical interpretation of the Kundt class of nonexpanding,\nnontwisting and shearfree geometries.\n", "  We use a new idea that emerged in the examination of exposed positive maps\nbetween matrix algebras to investigate in more detail the difference between\npositive maps on $M_2(C)$ and $M_3(C)$. Our main tool stems from classical\nGrothendieck theorem on tensor product of Banach spaces and is an older and\nmore general version of Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism between positive maps and\nblock positive Choi matrices. It takes into account the correct topology on the\nlatter set that is induced by the uniform topology on positive maps. In this\nsetting we show that in $M_2(C)$ case a large class of nice positive maps can\nbe generated from the small set of maps represented by self-adjoint unitaries,\n$2 P_x$ with $x$ maximally entangled vector and $p\\otimes 1$ with $p$ rank 1\nprojector. We show why this construction fails in $M_3(C)$ case. There are also\nsimilarities. In both $M_2(C)$ and $M_3(C)$ cases any unital positive map\nrepresented by self-adjoint unitary is unitarily equivalent to the\ntransposition map. Consequently we obtain a large family of exposed maps. We\nalso investigate a convex structure of the Choi map, the first example of\nnon-decomposable map. As a result the nature of the Choi map will be explained.\nThis gives an information on the origin of appearance of non-decomposable maps\non $M_3(C)$.\n", "  The absence of time-reversal symmetry is a fundamental property of many\nnonlinear time series. Here, we propose a new set of statistical tests for time\nseries irreversibility based on standard and horizontal visibility graphs.\nSpecifically, we statistically compare the distributions of time-directed\nvariants of the common complex network measures degree and local clustering\ncoefficient. Our approach does not involve surrogate data and is applicable to\nrelatively short time series. We demonstrate its performance for paradigmatic\nmodel systems with known time-reversal properties as well as for picking up\nsignatures of nonlinearity in neuro-physiological data.\n", "  Network theory provides a rich toolbox consisting of methods, measures, and\nmodels for studying the structure and dynamics of complex systems found in\nnature, society, or technology. Recently, it has been pointed out that many\nreal-world complex systems are more adequately mapped by networks of\ninteracting or interdependent networks, e.g., a power grid showing\ninterdependency with a communication network. Additionally, in many real-world\nsituations it is reasonable to include node weights into complex network\nstatistics to reflect the varying size or importance of subsystems that are\nrepresented by nodes in the network of interest. E.g., nodes can represent\nvastly different surface area in climate networks, volume in brain networks or\neconomic capacity in trade networks. In this letter, combining both ideas, we\nderive a novel class of statistical measures for analysing the structure of\nnetworks of interacting networks with heterogeneous node weights. Using a\nprototypical spatial network model, we show that the newly introduced\nnode-weighted interacting network measures indeed provide an improved\nrepresentation of the underlying system's properties as compared to their\nunweighted analogues. We apply our method to study the complex network\nstructure of cross-boundary trade between European Union (EU) and non-EU\ncountries finding that it provides important information on trade balance and\neconomic robustness.\n", "  Synchronisation between coupled oscillatory systems is a common phenomenon in\nmany natural as well as technical systems. Varying the strength of coupling\noften leads to qualitative changes in the complex dynamics of the mutually\ncoupled systems including different types of synchronisation such as phase,\nlag, generalised, or even complete synchronisation. Here, we study the\ngeometric signatures of coupling along with the onset of generalised\nsynchronisation between two coupled chaotic oscillators by mapping the systems'\nindividual as well as joint recurrences in phase space to a complex network.\nFor a paradigmatic continuous-time model system, the transitivity properties of\nthe resulting joint recurrence networks display distinct variations associated\nwith changes in the structural similarity between different parts of the\nconsidered trajectories. They therefore provide a useful indicator for the\nemergence of generalised synchronisation.\n  This paper is dedicated to the 25th anniversary of the introduction of\nrecurrence plots by Eckmann et al. (Europhys. Lett. 4 (1987), 973).\n", "  A search strategy for asymptotic safety is put forward and tested for a\nsimplified version of gravity in four dimensions using the renormalization\ngroup. Taking the action to be a high-order polynomial of the Ricci scalar, a\nself-consistent ultraviolet fixed point is found where curvature invariants\nbecome increasingly irrelevant with increasing mass dimension. Intriguingly,\nuniversal scaling exponents take near-Gaussian values despite the presence of\nresidual interactions. Asymptotic safety of metric gravity would seem in reach\nif this pattern carries over to the full theory.\n", "  In this paper we consider the total space of the canonical bundle of P^2 and\nwe use a proposal by Hosono, together with results in Seidel and\nAuroux-Katzarkov-Orlov, to deduce the right physical mirror equivalence between\nD^b(K_{P^2}) and the derived Fukaya category of its mirror. By construction,\nour equivalence is compatible with the mirror map between moduli spaces and\nwith the computation of Gromov--Witten invariants.\n", "  Multiscale dynamics are frequently present in real-world processes, such as\nthe atmosphere-ocean and climate science. Because of time scale separation\nbetween a small set of slowly evolving variables and much larger set of rapidly\nchanging variables, direct numerical simulations of such systems are difficult\nto carry out due to many dynamical variables and the need for an extremely\nsmall time discretization step to resolve fast dynamics. One of the common\nremedies for that is to approximate a multiscale dynamical systems by a closed\napproximate model for slow variables alone, which reduces the total effective\ndimension of the phase space of dynamics, as well as allows for a longer time\ndiscretization step. Recently we developed a new method for constructing a\ndeterministic reduced model of multiscale dynamics where coupling terms were\nparameterized via the Fluctuation-Dissipation theorem. In this work we further\nimprove this previously developed method for deterministic reduced models of\nmultiscale dynamics by introducing a new method for parameterizing slow-fast\ninteractions through additive stochastic noise in a systematic fashion. For the\ntwo-scale Lorenz 96 system with linear coupling, we demonstrate that the new\nmethod is able to recover additional features of multiscale dynamics in a\nstochastically forced reduced model, which the previously developed\ndeterministic method could not reproduce.\n", "  We analyze the structure of the so called non-signaling theories respecting\nrelativistic causality but allowing correlations violating bounds imposed by\nquantum mechanics such as CHSH inequality. We discuss relations among such\ntheories, quantum mechanics, and classical physics. In particular we\nreconstruct the probability theory adequate for the simplest instance of a\nnon-signaling theory, the two non-signaling boxes world, and exhibit its\ndifferences in comparison with classical and quantum probabilities. We show\nthat the question whether such a theory can be treated as a kind of\n\"generalization\" of the quantum theory of the two-qubit system cannot be\nanswered positively. Some of its features put it closer to the quantum world,\nfor example measurements must be destructive, on the other hand the Heisenberg\nuncertainty relations are not satisfied. Another interesting property\ncontrasting it from quantum mechanics is that the subset of \"classically\ncorrelated states,\" i.e.\\ the states with only classical correlations, does not\nreproduce the classical world of two two-state systems. Our results establish a\nnew link between quantum information theory and the well-developed theory of\nquantum logics and can shed new light on the problem why quantum mechanics is\ndistinguished among non-signaling theories.\n", "  We examine quantum percolation on a square lattice with random dilution up to\n$q=38%$ and energy $0.001 \\le E \\le 1.6$ (measured in units of the hopping\nmatrix element), using numerical calculations of the transmission coefficient\nat a much larger scale than previously. Our results confirm the previous\nfinding that the two dimensional quantum percolation model exhibits\nlocalization-delocalization transitions, where the localized region splits into\nan exponentially localized region and a power-law localization region. We\ndetermine a fuller phase diagram confirming all three regions for energies as\nlow as $E=0.1$, and the delocalized and exponentially localized regions for\nenergies down to $E=0.001$. We also examine the scaling behavior of the\nresidual transmission coefficient in the delocalized region, the power law\nexponent in the power-law localized region, and the localization length in the\nexponentially localized region. Our results suggest that the residual\ntransmission at the delocalized to power-law localized phase boundary may be\ndiscontinuous, and that the localization length is likely not to diverge with a\npower-law at the exponentially localized to power-law localized phase boundary.\nHowever, further work is needed to definitively assess the characters of the\ntwo phase transitions as well as the nature of the intermediate power-law\nregime.\n", "  Generalized quantum discord $(D_q)$, Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering $(S)$,\nentanglement $(E)$, and Bell nonlocality ($N$), are logically distinct\nquantifiers of quantum correlations. All these measures capture nonclassical\naspects of quantum states and play some role as resources in quantum\ninformation processing. In this work, we look for the hierarchy satisfied by\nthese quantum correlation witnesses for a class of two-qubit states. We show\nthat $N \\triangleright S\\triangleright E\\triangleright D_q$, meaning that\nnonlocality implies steering, which in turn implies entanglement, which then\nimplies $q$-discord. For the quantum states under concern, we show that the\ninvariance of this hierarchy under noisy quantum channels directly implies a\ndeath chronology. Additionally, we have found that sudden death of all quantum\nresources except discord is absent only for a subset of states of measure zero.\nAt last, we provide an illustration of another consequence of the\naforementioned hierarchy, namely, the existence of a sudden birth chronology\nunder non-Markovian channels.\n", "  We report here the experimental observation of a dynamical quantum phase\ntransition in a strongly interacting open photonic system. The system studied,\ncomprising a Jaynes-Cummings dimer realized on a superconducting circuit\nplatform, exhibits a dissipation driven localization transition. Signatures of\nthe transition in the homodyne signal and photon number reveal this transition\nto be from a regime of classical oscillations into a macroscopically\nself-trapped state manifesting revivals, a fundamentally quantum phenomenon.\nThis experiment also demonstrates a small-scale realization of a new class of\nquantum simulator, whose well controlled coherent and dissipative dynamics is\nsuited to the study of quantum many-body phenomena out of equilibrium.\n", "  Taking into account the possibility of a p-wave hybridization function\n$V(\\vec k)$ of ad-atom with Dirac electrons in graphene -- which arises for\nvacancies and hollow-site impurities -- we study the nature of magnetic moment\nformation within the single impurity Anderson model (SIAM). Compared to the\ns-wave hybridization function, we find that the local moments formed within the\nHartree mean field are robust against the change in the parameters of the\nmodel. Further we investigate the stability of the local moments with respect\nto quantum fluctuations by going beyond the Hartree approximation. We find that\nfor parameter regimes where local moments formed by top-site ad-atoms are\ncompletely washed out by quantum fluctuations, those formed by vacancies (or\nhollow-site impurities) survive the quantum fluctuations captured by\npost-Hartree approximation. Hence vacancies and hollow-site ad-atoms are\nsuitable candidates to produce stable local moments.\n", "  In a nanoscopic thin film of a strong topological insulator (TI) the Coulomb\ninteraction in the channel that exchanges the two electrons with the same\nchirality in two different planes of the slab takes advantage of the minus sign\nresulting from such \"exchange\" and gives rise to a bound state between the\npositive energy states in one surface and the negative energy states in the\nopposite surfaces. Therefore particle and hole pairs in the {\\em undoped} Dirac\ncone of the TI thin film form an inter-surface spin-singlet state that lies\nbelow the continuum of free particle-hole pairs. This mode is similar to the\nexcitons of semiconductors, albeit formed between the electron and hole pairs\nfrom two different two-dimensional surfaces. For low-momenta the dispersion\nrelation characterizing this collective mode is linear. Experimental comparison\nof two slabs with different thicknesses can capture the exponential dependence\nof the present effect on the slab thickness.\n", "  We report high-fidelity, quantum nondemolition, single-shot readout of a\nsuperconducting transmon qubit using a DC-biased superconducting low-inductance\nundulatory galvanometer(SLUG) amplifier. The SLUG improves the system\nsignal-to-noise ratio by 7 dB in a 20 MHz window compared with a bare HEMT\namplifier. An optimal cavity drive pulse is chosen using a genetic search\nalgorithm, leading to a maximum combined readout and preparation fidelity of\n91.9% with a measurement time of Tmeas = 200ns. Using post-selection to remove\npreparation errors caused by heating, we realize a combined preparation and\nreadout fidelity of 94.3%.\n", "  In this paper, we complete the study of the geometry of the TDOA map that\nencodes the noiseless model for the localization of a source from the range\ndifferences between three receivers in a plane, by computing the Cartesian\nequation of the bifurcation curve in terms of the positions of the receivers.\nFrom that equation, we can compute its real asymptotic lines. The present\nmanuscript completes the analysis of [Inverse Problems, Vol. 30, Number 3,\nPages 035004]. Our result is useful to check if a source belongs or is closed\nto the bifurcation curve, where the localization in a noisy scenario is\nambiguous.\n", "  A new fast multipole formulation for solving elliptic difference equations on\nunbounded domains and its parallel implementation are presented. These\ndifference equations can arise directly in the description of physical systems,\ne.g. crystal structures, or indirectly through the discretization of PDEs. In\nthe analog to solving continuous inhomogeneous differential equations using\nGreen's functions, the proposed method uses the fundamental solution of the\ndiscrete operator on an infinite grid, or lattice Green's function. Fast\nsolutions $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ are achieved by using a kernel-independent\ninterpolation-based fast multipole method. Unlike other fast multipole\nalgorithms, our approach exploits the regularity of the underlying Cartesian\ngrid and the efficiency of FFTs to reduce the computation time. Our parallel\nimplementation allows communications and computations to be overlapped and\nrequires minimal global synchronization. The accuracy, efficiency, and parallel\nperformance of the method are demonstrated through numerical experiments on the\ndiscrete 3D Poisson equation.\n", "  Optical frequency combs have had a remarkable impact on precision\nspectroscopy. Enabling this technology in the x-ray domain is expected to\nresult in wide-ranging applications, such as stringent tests of astrophysical\nmodels and quantum electrodynamics, a more sensitive search for the variability\nof fundamental constants, and precision studies of nuclear structure.\nUltraprecise x-ray atomic clocks may also be envisaged. In this work, an x-ray\npulse-shaping method is put forward to generate a comb in the absorption\nspectrum of an ultrashort high-frequency pulse. The method employs an\noptical-frequency-comb laser, manipulating the system's dipole response to\nimprint a comb on an excited transition with a high photon energy. The\ndescribed scheme provides higher comb frequencies and requires lower\noptical-comb peak intensities than currently explored methods, preserves the\noverall width of the optical comb, and may be implemented by presently\navailable x-ray technology.\n", "  De Rham cohomology with spacelike compact and timelike compact supports has\nrecently been noticed to be of importance for understanding the structure of\nclassical and quantum Maxwell theory on curved spacetimes. Similarly causally\nrestricted cohomologies of different differential complexes play a similar role\nin other gauge theories. We introduce a method for computing these causally\nrestricted cohomologies in terms of cohomologies with either compact or\nunrestricted supports. The calculation exploits the fact that the de\nRham-d'Alembert wave operator can be extended to a chain map that is homotopic\nto zero and that its causal Green function fits into a convenient exact\nsequence. As a first application, we use the method on the de Rham complex,\nthen also on the Calabi (or Killing-Riemann-Bianchi) complex, which appears in\nlinearized gravity on constant curvature backgrounds. We also discuss\napplications to other complexes, as well as generalized causal structures and\nfunctoriality.\n", "  Moving Target Defense (MTD) can enhance the resilience of cyber systems\nagainst attacks. Although there have been many MTD techniques, there is no\nsystematic understanding and {\\em quantitative} characterization of the power\nof MTD. In this paper, we propose to use a cyber epidemic dynamics approach to\ncharacterize the power of MTD. We define and investigate two complementary\nmeasures that are applicable when the defender aims to deploy MTD to achieve a\ncertain security goal. One measure emphasizes the maximum portion of time\nduring which the system can afford to stay in an undesired configuration (or\nposture), without considering the cost of deploying MTD. The other measure\nemphasizes the minimum cost of deploying MTD, while accommodating that the\nsystem has to stay in an undesired configuration (or posture) for a given\nportion of time. Our analytic studies lead to algorithms for optimally\ndeploying MTD.\n", "  Conventional approaches to incorporating general relativistic effects into\nthe dynamics of N-body systems containing central black holes, or of\nhierarchical triple systems with a relativistic inner binary, may not be\nadequate when the goal is to study the evolution of the system over a timescale\nrelated to relativistic secular effects, such as the precession of the\npericenter. For such problems, it may necessary to include post-Newtonian\n\"cross terms\" in the equations of motion in order to capture relativistic\neffects consistently over the long timescales. Cross terms are post-Newtonian\n(PN) terms that explicitly couple the two-body relativistic perturbations with\nthe Newtonian perturbations due to other bodies in the system. In this paper,\nwe show that the total energy and the normal component of total angular\nmomentum of a hierarchical triple system is manifestly conserved to Newtonian\norder over the relativistic pericenter precession timescale of the inner binary\nif and only if PN cross-term effects in the equations of motion are taken\ncarefully into account.\n", "  In this paper we propose a new version for the noncommutative superspace in\n3D. This version is shown to be convenient for performing quantum calculations.\nIn the paper, we use the theory of the chiral superfield as a prototype for\npossible generalizations, calculating the one-loop two-point function of a\nchiral supefield and the one-loop low-energy effective action in this theory.\n", "  It is often said that the transition from quantum to classical worlds is\ncaused by decoherence originated from an interaction between a system of\ninterest and its surrounding environment. Here we establish a computational\nquantum-classical boundary from the viewpoint of classical simulatability of a\nquantum system under decoherence. Specifically, we consider commuting quantum\ncircuits being subject to decoherence. Or equivalently, we can regard them as\nmeasurement-based quantum computation on decohered weighted graph states. To\nshow intractability of classical simulation above the boundary, we utilize the\npostselection argument introduced by M. J. Bremner, R. Jozsa, and D. J.\nShepherd [Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and\nEngineering Science 465, 1413 (2009).] and crucially strengthen its statement\nby taking noise effect into account. Classical simulatability below the\nboundary is also shown constructively by using both separable criteria in a\nprojected-entangled-pair-state picture and the Gottesman-Knill theorem for\nmixed state Clifford circuits. We found that when each qubit is subject to a\nsingle-qubit complete-positive-trace-preserving noise, the computational\nquantum-classical boundary is sharply given by the noise rate required for the\ndistillability of a magic state. The obtained quantum-classical boundary of\nnoisy quantum dynamics reveals a complexity landscape of controlled quantum\nsystems. This paves a way to an experimentally feasible verification of quantum\nmechanics in a high complexity limit beyond classically simulatable region.\n", "  Since the seminal work of Marzari and Vanderbilt, maximally localized Wannier\nfunctions have become widely used as a real-space representation of the\nelectronic structure of periodic materials. In this paper we introduce\nselectively localized Wannier functions which extend the method of Marzari and\nVanderbilt in two important ways. First, our method allows us to focus on\nlocalizing a subset of orbitals of interest. Second, our method allows us to\nfix centers of these orbitals, and ensure the preservation of the point-group\nsymmetry. These characteristics are important when Wannier functions are used\nin methodologies that go beyond density functional theory by treating a local\nsubspace of the Hamiltonian more effectively. Application of our method to\nGaAs, SrMnO$_3$, and Co demonstrates that selectively localized Wannier\nfunctions can offer improvements over the maximally localized Wannier function\ntechnique.\n", "  We study the problem of coupling Einstein's equations to a relativistic and\nphysically well-motivated version of the Navier-Stokes equations. Under a\nnatural evolution condition for the vorticity, we prove existence and\nuniqueness in a suitable Gevrey class if the fluid is incompressible, where\nthis condition is given an appropriate relativistic interpretation, and show\nthat the solutions enjoy the finite propagation speed property.\n", "  Bismuth and its alloys provide a paradigm to realize three dimensional\nmaterials whose low-energy effective theory is given by Dirac equation in 3+1\ndimensions. We study the quantum transport properties of three dimensional\nDirac materials within the framework of Landauer-B\\\"uttiker formalism. Charge\ncarriers in normal metal satisfying the Schr\\\"odinger equation, can be split\ninto four-component with appropriate matching conditions at the boundary with\nthe three dimensional Dirac material (3DDM). We calculate the conductance and\nthe Fano factor of an interface separating 3DDM from a normal metal, as well as\nthe conductance through a slab of 3DDM. Under certain circumstances the 3DDM\nappears transparent to electrons hitting the 3DDM. We find that electrons\nhitting the metal-3DDM interface from metallic side can enter 3DDM in a\nreversed spin state as soon as their angle of incidence deviates from the the\ndirection perpendicular to interface. However the presence of a second\ninterface completely cancels this effect.\n", "  We identify infinite-dimensional stochastic differential equations (ISDEs)\ndescribing the stochastic dynamics related to Airy$_{\\beta } $ random point\nfields with $ \\beta =1,2,4 $. We prove the existence of unique strong solutions\nof these ISDEs. When $ \\beta = 2 $, this solution is equal to the stochastic\ndynamics defined by the space-time correlation functions obtained by Spohn and\nJohansson among others. We develop a new method to construct a unique, strong\nsolution of ISDEs. We expect that our approach is valid for other soft-edge\nscaling limits of stochastic dynamics arising from the random matrix theory.\n", "  We examine the cosmological consequences of an alternative to the standard\nexpression for bulk viscosity, one which was proposed to avoid the propagation\nof superluminal signals without the necessity of extending the space of\nvariables of the theory. The Friedmann equation is derived for this case, along\nwith an expression for the effective pressure. We find solutions for the\nevolution of the density of a viscous component, which differs markedly from\nthe case of conventional Eckart theory; our model evolves toward late-time\nphantom-like behavior with a future singularity. Entropy production is\naddressed, and some similarities and differences to approaches based on the\nMueller-Israel-Stewart theory are discussed.\n", "  The measurement of the deflection of starlight during a total solar eclipse\non May 29, 1919 was the first verification of general relativity by an external\nteam of scientists, brought Einstein and his theory to the attention of the\ngeneral public, and left a legacy of experimental testing that continues today.\nThe discovery of gravitational lenses turned Einstein's deflection into an\nimportant tool for astronomy and cosmology. This article reviews the history of\nthe 1919 measurement and other eclipse measurements, describes modern\nmeasurements of the effect using radio astronomy, and of its cousin, the\nShapiro time delay, and discusses gravitational lenses.\n", "  We study on the relations between modulational instability and several\nwell-known nonlinear excitations in a nonlinear fiber, such as bright soliton,\nnonlinear continuous wave, Akhmediev breather, Peregrine rogue wave, and\nKuznetsov-Ma breather. We present a quantitative correspondence between them\nbased on the dominant frequency and propagation constant of each perturbation\non a continuous wave background. Especially, we find rogue wave comes from\nmodulational instability under the \"resonance\" perturbation with continuous\nwave background. These results will deepen our understanding on rogue wave\nexcitation and could be helpful for controllable nonlinear wave excitations in\nnonlinear fiber and other nonlinear systems.\n", "  Starting from the origin of Einstein general relativity (GR) the request of\nMach on the theory's structure has been the core of the foundational debate.\nThat problem is strictly connected with the nature of the mass-energy\nequivalence. It is well known that this is exactly the key point that Einstein\nused to realize a metric theory of gravitation having an unequalled beauty and\nelegance. On the other hand, the current requirements of particle physics and\nthe open questions within extended gravity theories request a better\nunderstanding of Equivalence Principle (EP). The MOND theory by Milgrom\nproposes a modification of Newtonian dynamics and we consider a direct coupling\nbetween the Ricci curvature scalar and the matter Lagrangian showing that a non\ngeodesic ratio m_{i}/m_{g} can be fixed and that Milgrom acceleration is\nretrieved at low energies.\n", "  We extend an $L^2$ energy gap result due independently to Min-Oo and Parker\n(1982) for Yang-Mills connections on principal $G$-bundles, $P$, over closed,\nconnected, four-dimensional, oriented, smooth manifolds, $X$, from the case of\npositive Riemannian metrics to the more general case of good Riemannian\nmetrics, including metrics that are generic and where the topologies of $P$ and\n$X$ obey certain mild conditions and the compact Lie group, $G$, is\n$\\mathrm{SU}(2)$ or $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$.\n", "  We develop a framework for studying variational problems in Banach spaces\nwith respect to gradient relations, which encompasses many of the notions of\ngeneralized gradients that appear in the literature. We stress the fact that\nour approach is not dependent on function spaces and therefore applies equally\nwell to functions on metric spaces as to operator algebras. In particular, we\nconsider analogues of Dirichlet and obstacle problems, as well as first\neigenvalue problems, and formulate conditions for the existence of solutions\nand their uniqueness. Moreover, we investigate to what extent a lattice\nstructure may be introduced on (ordered) Banach spaces via a norm-minimizing\nvariational problem. A multitude of examples is provided to illustrate the\nversatility of our approach.\n", "  Thermodynamics is a highly successful macroscopic theory widely used across\nthe natural sciences and for the construction of everyday devices, from car\nengines and fridges to power plants and solar cells. With thermodynamics\npredating quantum theory, research now aims to uncover the thermodynamic laws\nthat govern finite size systems which may in addition host quantum effects.\nHere we identify information processing tasks, the so-called \"projections\",\nthat can only be formulated within the framework of quantum mechanics. We show\nthat the physical realisation of such projections can come with a non-trivial\nthermodynamic work only for quantum states with coherences. This contrasts with\ninformation erasure, first investigated by Landauer, for which a thermodynamic\nwork cost applies for classical and quantum erasure alike. Implications are\nfar-reaching, adding a thermodynamic dimension to measurements performed in\nquantum thermodynamics experiments, and providing key input for the\nconstruction of a future quantum thermodynamic framework. Repercussions are\ndiscussed for quantum work fluctuation relations and thermodynamic single-shot\napproaches.\n", "  The nuclear spins of ionized donors in silicon have become an interesting\nquantum resource due to their very long coherence times. Their perfect\nisolation, however, comes at a price, since the absence of the donor electron\nmakes the nuclear spin difficult to control. We demonstrate that the\nquadrupolar interaction allows us to effectively tune the nuclear magnetic\nresonance of ionized arsenic donors in silicon via strain and determine the two\nnonzero elements of the S tensor linking strain and electric field gradients in\nthis material to $S_{11}=1.5\\times10^{22}$ V/m$^2$ and $S_{44}=6\\times 10^{22}$\nV/m$^2$. We find a stronger benefit of dynamical decoupling on the coherence\nproperties of transitions subject to first-order quadrupole shifts than on\nthose subject to only second-order shifts and discuss applications of\nquadrupole physics including mechanical driving of magnetic resonance, cooling\nof mechanical resonators, and strain-mediated spin coupling.\n", "  We first find the linear approximation of the second plus fourth order\nderivative massive conformal gravity action. Then we reduce the linearized\naction to separated second order derivative terms, which allows us to quantize\nthe theory by using the standard first order canonical quantization method. It\nis shown that quantum massive conformal gravity is renormalizable but has ghost\nstates. A possible decoupling of these ghost states at high energies is\ndiscussed.\n", "  We consider the gravity interacting with matter scalar fields and quantized\nin the minisuperspace approach in which the wave functional is described by the\nWheeler-DeWitt equations (WdW). Assuming the domination of the homogeneous and\nisotropic geometry the leading contributions to the wave functional in the\napproximation of the minisuperspace with Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric\n(FRW) and spatially uniform scalar fields are considered. The model of several\nscalar fields with exponential potentials and kinetic terms admitting such a\nspecial mixing that ultimately it is possible to separate the variables in the\nWdW equation and to find its exact solution in terms of the special functions\nis proposed. The semiclassical approximation is thoroughly investigated and the\nboundary conditions permitting the physical solution selection for classical\ncosmologies are chosen.\n", "  Using the complex-valued self-dual connection variables, the loop quantum\ncosmology of a closed Friedmann universe coupled to a massless scalar field is\nstudied. It is shown how the reality conditions can be imposed in the quantum\ntheory by choosing a particular inner product for the kinematical Hilbert\nspace. While holonomies of the self-dual Ashtekar connection are not\nwell-defined in the kinematical Hilbert space, it is possible to introduce a\nfamily of generalized holonomy-like operators of which some are well-defined;\nthese operators in turn are used in the definition of the Hamiltonian\nconstraint operator where the scalar field can be used as a relational clock.\nThe resulting quantum theory is closely related, although not identical, to\nstandard loop quantum cosmology constructed from the Ashtekar-Barbero variables\nwith a real Immirzi parameter. Effective Friedmann equations are derived, which\nprovide a good approximation to the full quantum dynamics for sharply-peaked\nstates whose volume remains much larger than the Planck volume, and they show\nthat for these states quantum gravity effects resolve the big-bang and\nbig-crunch singularities and replace them by a non-singular bounce. Finally,\nthe loop quantization in self-dual variables of a flat Friedmann space-time is\nrecovered in the limit of zero spatial curvature and is identical to the\nstandard loop quantization in terms of the real-valued Ashtekar-Barbero\nvariables.\n", "  Neutrino oscillations are well established and the relevant parameters\ndetermined with good precision, except for the CP phase, in terms of a unitary\nlepton mixing matrix. Seesaw extensions of the Standard Model predict unitarity\ndeviations due to the admixture of heavy isosinglet neutrinos. We provide a\ncomplete description of the unitarity and universality deviations in the light\nneutrino sector. Neutrino oscillation experiments involving electron or muon\nneutrinos and anti-neutrinos are fully described in terms of just three new\nreal parameters and a new CP phase, in addition to the ones describing\noscillations with unitary mixing. Using this formalism we describe the\nimplications of non-unitarity for neutrino oscillations and summarize the\nmodel-independent constraints on heavy neutrino couplings that arise from\ncurrent experiments.\n", "  Photospheric magnetic fields are studied using synoptic maps from 1976 to\n2003 produced at the National Solar Observatory, Kitt Peak (NSO/KP). Synoptic\nmaps were averaged over the time interval of nearly three solar cycles (Solar\nCycles 21-23). The change in the latitudinal distribution was considered for\nthe following groups of magnetic field values: B = 0-5 G, B = 5-15 G, B = 15-50\nG, and B>50 G. Magnetic fields in each of the above groups have common\nlatitudinal distribution features, while for different field groups these\nfeatures are significantly different. Each of the groups is closely related to\na certain manifestation of solar activity. Strong magnetic fields are connected\nwith two types of solar activity: active regions (magnetic fields B>15 G)that\nare related to sunspot zones, and polar faculae (magnetic fields 50 G > B > 15\nG) that occupy latitudes around 65$^\\circ$-75$^\\circ$. Fields from 5 to 15 G\noccupy the polar regions and are connected with polar coronal holes (the global\nsolar dipole). Fields of B<5 G occupy a) the equatorial region and b) latitudes\n40$^{\\circ}$-60$^\\circ$.\n", "  Graphene-based Josephson junctions provide a novel platform for studying the\nproximity effect due to graphene's unique electronic spectrum and the\npossibility to tune junction properties by gate voltage. Here we describe\ngraphene junctions with a mean free path of several micrometres, low contact\nresistance and large supercurrents. Such devices exhibit pronounced\nFabry-P\\'erot oscillations not only in the normal-state resistance but also in\nthe critical current. The proximity effect is mostly suppressed in magnetic\nfields below 10mT, showing the conventional Fraunhofer pattern. Unexpectedly,\nsome proximity survives even in fields higher than 1 T. Superconducting states\nrandomly appear and disappear as a function of field and carrier concentration,\nand each of them exhibits a supercurrent carrying capacity close to the\nuniversal quantum limit. We attribute the high-field Josephson effect to\nmesoscopic Andreev states that persist near graphene edges. Our work reveals\nnew proximity regimes that can be controlled by quantum confinement and\ncyclotron motion.\n", "  We present our development of Zeldovich's ideas for the measurement of the\ncosmological angular diameter distance (ADD) in the Friedmann Universe. We\nderive the general differential equation for the ADD measurement which is valid\nfor an open, spatially-flat and closed universe, and for any stress energy\ntensor. We solve the mentioned equations in terms of quadratures in a form\nsuitable for further numerical investigations for the present universe filled\nby radiation, (baryonic and dark) matter and dark energy. We perform the\nnumerical investigation in the absence of radiation, and show the strong\ndependence ADD on the filling of the cone of light rays (CLR). The difference\nof the empty and totally filled CLR may reach 600-700 Mps. for the redshift\n$f\\simeq 3$.\n", "  This paper considers work extraction from a quantum system to a work storage\nsystem (or weight) following reference [1]. An alternative approach is here\ndeveloped that relies on the comparison of subspace dimensions without a need\nto introduce thermo-majorisation used previously. Optimal single shot work for\nprocesses where a weight transfers from (a) a single energy level to another\nsingle energy level is then re-derived. In addition we discuss the final state\nof the system after work extraction and show that the system typically ends in\nits thermal state, while there are cases where the system is only close to it.\nThe work of formation in the single level transfer setting [1] is also\nre-derived. The approach presented now allows the extension of the single shot\nwork concept to work extraction (b) involving multiple final levels of the\nweight. A key conclusion here is that the single shot work for case (a) is\nappropriate only when a \\emph{resonance} of a particular energy is required.\nWhen wishing to identify \"work extraction\" with finding the weight in a\nspecific available energy or any higher energy a broadening of the single shot\nwork concept is required. As a final contribution we consider transformations\nof the system that (c) result in general weight state transfers. Introducing a\ntransfer-quantity allows us to formulate minimum requirements for\ntransformations to be at all possible in a thermodynamic framework. We show\nthat choosing the free energy difference of the weight as the transfer-quantity\none recovers various single shot results including single level transitions\n(a), multiple final level transitions (b), and recent results on restricted\nsets of multi-level to multi-level weight transfers.\n", "  We propose a Lagrangian function, which combines Landau-Ginzburg term and\nChern-Simons term, for describing the competition between disorder and\nsuperconductivity. To describe the normal-to-superconducting transition in the\nthin superconducting films, we apply Wilson's renormalization group methods\ninto this Lagrangian function. Finally, we obtain a scaling law between\ncritical temperature (T_c), film thickness (d), sheet resistance of the film at\nthe normal state (R_s), and number density of the electrons at the normal state\n(N). Such a scaling law is in agreement with recent experimental investigations\n[Ivry, Y. et al, Physical Review B 90, 214515 (2014)]. Our finding may have\npotential benefits for improving transition temperature T_c.\n", "  We show how R-parity can be dynamically broken by non-perturbative quantum\ngravity effects. In particular, in D-brane models, Exotic instantons provide a\nsimple and calculable mechanism for the generation of R-parity violating\nbilinear, trilinear and higher order superpotential terms. We show examples of\nMSSM-like D-brane models, in which one Exotic Instanton induces only one term\namong the possible R-parity violating superpotentials. Naturally, the idea can\nbe generalized for other gauge groups.\n  As a consequence, a dynamical violation of R-parity does not necessarily\ndestabilize the proton, i.e. a strong fine tuning is naturally avoided, in our\ncase. For example, a Lepton violating superpotential term can be generated\nwithout generating Baryon violating terms, and viceversa. This has strong\nimplications in phenomenology: neutrino, neutron-antineutron, electric dipole\nmoments, dark matter and LHC physics.\n", "  We show that the squared maximal height of the top path among $N$\nnon-intersecting Brownian bridges starting and ending at the origin is\ndistributed as the top eigenvalue of a random matrix drawn from the Laguerre\nOrthogonal Ensemble. This result can be thought of as a discrete version of K.\nJohansson's result that the supremum of the Airy$_2$ process minus a parabola\nhas the Tracy-Widom GOE distribution, and as such it provides an explanation\nfor how this distribution arises in models belonging to the KPZ universality\nclass with flat initial data. The result can be recast in terms of the\nprobability that the top curve of the stationary Dyson Brownian motion hits an\nhyperbolic cosine barrier.\n", "  We revisit on rational solution of Sasa-Satsuma equation, which can be used\nto describe evolution of optical field in a nonlinear fiber with some\nhigh-order effects. We find a striking dynamical process which involves both\nmodulational instability and modulational stability regimes, in contrast to the\nrogue waves and W-shaped soliton reported before which involves modulational\ninstability and stability respectively. It is demonstrated that stable W-shaped\nsolitons can be generated from a weak modulation signal on continuous wave\nbackground. This provides a possible way to obtain stable high-intensity pulse\nfrom low-intensity continuous wave background.\n", "  We reconsider a gauge theory of gravity in which the gauge group is the\nconformal group SO(4,2) and the action is of the Yang-Mills form, quadratic in\nthe curvature. The resulting gravitational theory exhibits local conformal\nsymmetry and reduces to Weyl-squared gravity under certain conditions. When the\ntheory is linearized about flat spacetime, we find that matter which couples to\nthe generators of special conformal transformations reproduces Newton's inverse\nsquare law. Conversely, matter which couples to generators of translations\ninduces a constant and possibly repulsive force far from the source, which may\nbe relevant for explaining the late time acceleration of the universe. The\ncoupling constant of theory is dimensionless, which means that it is\npotentially renormalizable.\n", "  A necessary condition for superconductivity (SC) driven by electron\ncorrelations is that electron-electron (e-e) interactions enhance\nsuperconducting pair-pair correlations, relative to the noninteracting limit.\nWe report high-precision numerical calculations of the ground state within the\nfrustrated two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard Hamiltonian for a wide range of carrier\nconcentration $\\rho$ (0 < $\\rho$ <1) per site. We find that long range\nsuperconducting pair correlations are enhanced only for $\\rho$ $\\simeq$ 0.5. At\nall other fillings e-e interactions mostly suppress pair correlations. The\nenhancement of pair correlations is driven by the strong tendency to local\nsinglet bond formation and spin gap (SG) in $\\rho$ = 0.5, in lattices with\nquantum fluctuation. We also report determinantal quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC)\ncalculations that are in strong agreement with our ground state results. Our\nwork provides a key ingredient to the mechanism of SC in the 2D organic\ncharge-transfer solids (CTS), and many other unconventional superconductors\nwith frustrated crystal lattices and $\\rho$ $\\simeq$ 0.5, while explaining the\nabsence of SC in structurally related materials with substantially different\n$\\rho$.\n", "  We present an embedding scheme for periodic systems that facilitates the\ntreatment of the physically important part (here the unit cell) with advanced\nelectronic-structure methods, that are computationally too expensive for\nperiodic systems. The rest of the periodic system is treated with\ncomputationally less demanding approaches, e.g., Kohn-Sham density-functional\ntheory, in a self- consistent manner. Our scheme is based on the concept of\ndynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) formulated in terms of Green functions. In\ncontrast to the original DMFT formulation for correlated model Hamiltonians, we\nhere consider the unit cell as local embedded cluster in a first-principles\nway, that includes all electronic degrees of freedom. Our real-space dynamical\nmean-field embedding (RDMFE) scheme features two nested Dyson equations, one\nfor the embedded cluster and another for the periodic surrounding. The total\nenergy is computed from the resulting Green functions. The performance of our\nscheme is demonstrated by treating the embedded region with hybrid functionals\nand many-body perturbation theory in the GW approach for simple bulk systems.\nThe total energy and the density of states converge rapidly with respect to the\ncomputational parameters and approach their bulk limit with increasing cluster\n(i.e., unit cell) size.\n", "  In quantum optimal control theory the success of an optimization algorithm is\nhighly influenced by how the figure of merit to be optimized behaves as a\nfunction of the control field, i.e. by the control landscape. Constraints on\nthe control field introduce local minima in the landscape --false traps-- which\nmight prevent an efficient solution of the optimal control problem. Rabitz et\nal. [Science 303, 1998 (2004)] showed that local minima occur only rarely for\nunconstrained optimization. Here, we extend this result to the case of\nbandwidth-limited control pulses showing that in this case one can eliminate\nthe false traps arising from the constraint. Based on this theoretical\nunderstanding, we modify the Chopped Random Basis (CRAB) optimal control\nalgorithm and show that this development exploits the advantages of both\n(unconstrained) gradient algorithms and of truncated basis methods, allowing to\nalways follow the gradient of the unconstrained landscape by bandwidth-limited\ncontrol functions. We study the effects of additional constraints and show that\nfor reasonable constraints the convergence properties are still maintained.\nFinally, we numerically show that this approach saturates the theoretical bound\non the minimal bandwidth of the control needed to optimally drive the system.\n", "  Quantum mechanics represents one of the greatest triumphs of human intellect\nand, undoubtedly, is the most successful physical theory we have to date.\nHowever, since its foundation about a century ago, it has been uninterruptedly\nthe center of harsh debates ignited by the counterintuitive character of some\nof its predictions. The subject of one of these heated discussions is the\nso-called \"retrodiction paradox\", namely a deceptive inconsistency of quantum\nmechanics which is often associated with the \"measurement paradox\" and the\n\"collapse of the wave function\"; it comes from the apparent time-asymmetry\nbetween state preparation and measurement. Actually, in the literature one\nfinds several versions of the retrodiction paradox; however, a particularly\ninsightful one was presented by Sir Roger Penrose in his seminal book \\emph{The\nRoad to Reality}. Here, we address the question to what degree Penrose's\nretrodiction paradox occurs in the classical and quantum domain. We achieve a\ntwofold result. First, we show that Penrose's paradox manifests itself in some\nform also in classical optics. Second, we demonstrate that when information is\ncorrectly extracted from the measurements and the quantum-mechanical formalism\nis properly applied, Penrose's retrodiction paradox does not manifest itself in\nquantum optics.\n", "  Topological order in two dimensions can be described in terms of deconfined\nquasiparticle excitations - anyons - and their braiding statistics. However, it\nhas recently been realized that this data does not completely describe the\nsituation in the presence of an unbroken global symmetry. In this case, there\ncan be multiple distinct quantum phases with the same anyons and statistics,\nbut with different patterns of symmetry fractionalization - termed symmetry\nenriched topological (SET) order. When the global symmetry group $G$, which we\ntake to be discrete, does not change topological superselection sectors - i.e.\ndoes not change one type of anyon into a different type of anyon - one can\nimagine a local version of the action of $G$ around each anyon. This leads to\nprojective representations and a group cohomology description of symmetry\nfractionalization, with $H^2(G,{\\cal A})$ being the relevant group. In this\npaper, we treat the general case of a symmetry group $G$ possibly permuting\nanyon types. We show that despite the lack of a local action of $G$, one can\nstill make sense of a so-called twisted group cohomology description of\nsymmetry fractionalization, and show how this data is encoded in the\nassociativity of fusion rules of the extrinsic `twist' defects of the symmetry.\nFurthermore, building on work of Hermele, we construct a wide class of exactly\nsolved models which exhibit this twisted symmetry fractionalization, and\nconnect them to our formal framework.\n", "  Prompt photon production in $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}} = 2.76$ TeV Pb+Pb\ncollisions has been measured by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron\nCollider using data collected in 2011 with an integrated luminosity of 0.14\nnb$^{-1}$. Inclusive photon yields, scaled by the mean nuclear thickness\nfunction, are presented as a function of collision centrality and transverse\nmomentum in two pseudorapidity intervals, $|\\eta| < 1.37$ and $1.52 < |\\eta| <\n2.37$. The scaled yields in the two pseudorapidity intervals, as well as the\nratios of the forward yields to those at midrapidity, are compared to the\nexpectations from next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculations from\nJETPHOX. The measured cross sections agree well with the predictions for\nproton-proton collisions within statistical and systematic uncertainties. Both\nthe yields and ratios are also compared to two other pQCD calculations, one\nwhich uses the isospin content appropriate to colliding lead nuclei, and\nanother which includes the EPS09 nuclear modifications to the nucleon parton\ndistribution functions.\n", "  Redshifted 21cm signal is a promising tool to investigate the state of\nintergalactic medium (IGM) in the Cosmic Dawn (CD) and Epoch of\nReionization(EoR). In our previous work (Shimabukuro et al 2015), we studied\nthe variance and skewness to give a clear interpretation of 21cm power spectrum\nand found that skewness is a good indicator of the epoch when X-ray heating\nbecomes effective. Thus, the non-Gaussian feature of the spatial distribution\nof the 21cm signal is expected to be useful to investigate the astrophysical\neffects in the CD and EoR. In this paper, in order to investigate such a\nnon-Gaussian feature in more detail, we focus on the bispectrum of the 21cm\nsignal. It is expected that the 21cm brightness temperature bispectrum is\nproduced by non-gaussianity due to the various astrophysical effects such as\nWouthysen-Field (WF) effect, X-ray heating and reionization. We study the\nvarious properties of 21cm bispectrum such as scale dependence, shape\ndependence and redshift evolution. And also we study the contribution from each\ncomponent of 21cm bispectrum. We find that the contribution from each component\nhas characteristic scale-dependent feature, and it is expected that we could\nobtain more detailed information on the IGM in the CD and EoR by using the 21cm\nbispectrum in the future experiments, combined with the power spectrum and\nskewness.\n", "  We introduce the \\texttt{pyunicorn} (Pythonic unified complex network and\nrecurrence analysis toolbox) open source software package for applying and\ncombining modern methods of data analysis and modeling from complex network\ntheory and nonlinear time series analysis. \\texttt{pyunicorn} is a fully\nobject-oriented and easily parallelizable package written in the language\nPython. It allows for the construction of functional networks such as climate\nnetworks in climatology or functional brain networks in neuroscience\nrepresenting the structure of statistical interrelationships in large data sets\nof time series and, subsequently, investigating this structure using advanced\nmethods of complex network theory such as measures and models for spatial\nnetworks, networks of interacting networks, node-weighted statistics or network\nsurrogates. Additionally, \\texttt{pyunicorn} provides insights into the\nnonlinear dynamics of complex systems as recorded in uni- and multivariate time\nseries from a non-traditional perspective by means of recurrence quantification\nanalysis (RQA), recurrence networks, visibility graphs and construction of\nsurrogate time series. The range of possible applications of the library is\noutlined, drawing on several examples mainly from the field of climatology.\n", "  A gas of electrons in a one-dimensional periodic potential can be transported\neven in the absence of a voltage bias if the potential is modulated slowly and\nperiodically in time. Remarkably, the transferred charge per cycle is only\nsensitive to the topology of the path in parameter space. Although this\nso-called Thouless charge pump has first been proposed more than thirty years\nago, it has not yet been realized. Here we report the first demonstration of\ntopological Thouless pumping using ultracold atoms in a dynamically controlled\noptical superlattice. We observe a shift of the atomic cloud as a result of\npumping and extract the topological invariance of the pumping process from this\nshift. We demonstrate the topological nature of the Thouless pump by varying\nthe topology of the pumping path and verify that the topological pump indeed\nworks in the quantum region by varying speed and temperature.\n", "  We theoretically analyze surface magnetoplasmon modes in a compact circular\ncavity made of magneto-optical material under a static magnetic field. Such a\ncavity provides two different physical mechanisms for the surface wave to\ncirculate in a unidirectional manner around the cavity, which offers more\nfreedom to realize one-way surface wave. We also show the interaction between\nthis one-way cavity and waveguides, through an example of a circulator, which\nlays the fundamental groundwork for potential nonreciprocal devices.\n", "  In the present article a new class of exact solutions of Einstein's field\nequations for charged anisotropic distribution is obtained on the background of\npseudo-spheroidal spacetime characterized by the metric potential\n$g_{rr}=\\frac{1+K\\frac{r^2}{R^2}}{1+\\frac{r^2}{R^2}}$, where $K$ and $R$ are\ngeometric parameters of the spacetime. The radial pressure $p_r$ and electric\nfield intensity $E$ are taken in the form $8\\pi p_r =\n\\frac{K-1}{R^2}\\frac{\\left(1-\\frac{r^2}{R^2} \\right)}{\\left(1+K\\frac{r^2}{R^2}\n\\right)^2}$ and $E^2 =\n\\frac{\\alpha(K-1)\\frac{r^2}{R^2}}{R^2\\left(1+K\\frac{r^2}{R^2} \\right)^2}$. The\nbounds of geometric parameter $K$ and the parameter $\\alpha$ appearing in the\nexpression of $E^2$ are obtained by imposing the requirements for a physically\nacceptable model. It is found that the model is in good agreement with the\nobservational data of number of compact stars like 4U 1820-30, PSR J1903+327,\n4U 1608-52, Vela X-1, PSR J1614-2230, Cen X-3 given by Gangopadhyay {\\em{et\nal}} [Gangopadhyay T., Ray S., Li X-D., Dey J. and Dey M., {\\it Mon. Not. R.\nAstron. Soc.} {\\bf431} (2013) 3216]. When $\\alpha = 0$, the model reduces to\nthe uncharged anisotropic distribution given by Ratanpal {\\em et al.} [Ratanpal\nB. S., Thomas V. O. and Pandya D. M., arXiv:1506.08512 [gr-qc](2015)]\n", "  In this paper we explore the possibility that recent results by ATLAS and CMS\nsearching for heavy resonances decaying into bosons could be a first hint of a\nnew sector of pure-gauge confining physics, possibly linked to the origin of\nthe Higgs as a Composite Higgs. The lightest resonances (glueballs) of this new\nsector would be neutral, spin-zero and -two, and their behaviour would resemble\nthat of a radion and a massive graviton of extra-dimensions. We outline how\nLHC8 data could be used to improve sensitivity on this scenario, as well as\nfuture characterization during the LHC13 run.\n", "  It is generally believed that any quantum theory of gravity should have a\ngeneric feature --- a quantum of length. We provide a physical ansatz to obtain\nan effective non-local metric tensor starting from the standard metric tensor\nsuch that the spacetime acquires a zero-point-length $\\ell _{0}$ of the order\nof the Planck length $L_{P}$. This prescription leads to several remarkable\nconsequences. In particular, the Euclidean volume $V_D(\\ell,\\ell_{0})$ in a\n$D$-dimensional spacetime of a region of size $\\ell $ scales as $V_D(\\ell, \\ell\n_{0}) \\propto \\ell_{0}^{D-2} \\ell^2$ when $\\ell \\sim \\ell_{0}$, while it\nreduces to the standard result $V_D(\\ell,\\ell_{0}) \\propto \\ell^D$ at large\nscales ($\\ell \\gg \\ell_{0}$). The appropriately defined effective dimension,\n$D_{\\rm eff} $, decreases continuously from $D_{\\rm eff}=D$ (at $\\ell \\gg\n\\ell_{0}$) to $D_{\\rm eff}=2$ (at $\\ell \\sim \\ell_{0}$). This suggests that the\nphysical spacetime becomes essentially 2-dimensional near Planck scale.\n", "  The Littlest Higgs Model with T-parity (LHT) belongs to the simplest new\nphysics scenarios with new sources of flavour and CP violation. We present a\nnew analysis of quark observables in the LHT model in view of the oncoming\nflavour precision era. We use all available information on the CKM parameters,\nlattice QCD input and experimental data on quark flavour observables and\ncorresponding theoretical calculations, taking into account new lower bounds on\nthe symmetry breaking scale and the mirror quark masses from the LHC. We\ninvestigate by how much the branching ratios for a number of rare $K$ and $B$\ndecays are still allowed to depart from their SM values. This includes\n$K^+\\to\\pi^+\\nu\\bar\\nu$, $K_L\\to\\pi^0\\nu\\bar\\nu$, $K_L\\to \\mu^+\\mu^-$,\n$\\epsilon'/\\epsilon$, $B\\to X_s\\gamma$, $B_{s,d}\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-$, $B\\to\nK^{(*)}\\ell^+\\ell^-$, $B\\to K^{(*)}\\nu\\bar\\nu$. Taking into account the\nconstraints from $\\Delta F=2$ processes, significant departures from the SM\npredictions for $K^+\\to\\pi^+\\nu\\bar\\nu$ and $K_L\\to\\pi^0\\nu\\bar\\nu$ are\npossible while the effects in $B$ decays are much smaller. In particular, the\nLHT model favours $\\mathcal{B}(B_{s}\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-) \\ge\n\\mathcal{B}(B_{s}\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-)_{\\rm SM}$, which is not supported by the data,\nand the present anomalies in $B\\to K^{(*)}\\ell^+\\ell^-$ decays cannot be\nexplained in this model. With the recent lattice and large $N$ input the\nimposition of the $\\epsilon'/\\epsilon$ constraint implies a significant\nsuppression of the branching ratio for $K_L\\to\\pi^0\\nu\\bar\\nu$ with respect to\nits SM value while allowing only for small modifications for\n$K^+\\to\\pi^+\\nu\\bar\\nu$. Finally, we investigate how the LHT physics could be\ndistinguished from other models by means of indirect measurements and discuss\nthe consequences for quark flavour observables of not finding any LHT state in\nthe coming years.\n", "  We calculate the squeezed limit of the bispectrum produced by inflation with\nmultiple light fields. To achieve this we allow for different horizon exit\ntimes for each mode and calculate the intrinsic field-space three-point\nfunction in the squeezed limit using soft-limit techniques. We then use the\n$\\delta N$ formalism from the time the last mode exits the horizon to calculate\nthe bispectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation. We apply our results\nto calculate the spectral index of the halo bias, $n_{\\delta b}$, an important\nobservational probe of the squeezed limit of the primordial bispectrum and\ncompare our results with previous formulae. We give an example of a curvaton\nmodel with $n_{\\delta b} \\sim {\\cal O}(n_s-1)$ for which we find a 20%\ncorrection to observable parameters for squeezings relevant to future\nexperiments. For completeness, we also calculate the squeezed limit of\nthree-point correlation functions involving gravitons for multiple field\nmodels.\n", "  Several long, dynamically cold stellar streams have been observed around the\nMilky Way Galaxy, presumably formed from the tidal disruption of globular\nclusters. In integrable potentials---where all orbits are regular---tidal\ndebris phase-mixes close to the orbit of the progenitor system. However, the\nMilky Way's dark matter halo is expected not to be fully integrable; an\nappreciable fraction of orbits will be chaotic. This paper examines the\ninfluence of chaos on the phase-space morphology of cold tidal streams. Streams\neven in weakly chaotic regions look very different from those in regular\nregions. We find that streams can be sensitive to chaos on a much shorter\ntime-scale than any standard prediction (from the Lyapunov or\nfrequency-diffusion times). For example, on a weakly chaotic orbit with a\nchaotic timescale predicted to be $>$1000 orbital periods ($>$1000 Gyr), the\nresulting stellar stream is, after just a few 10's of orbits, substantially\nmore diffuse than any formed on a nearby but regular orbit. We find that the\nenhanced diffusion of the stream stars can be understood by looking at the\nvariance in orbital frequencies of orbit ensembles centered around the parent\n(progenitor) orbit. Our results suggest that long, cold streams around our\nGalaxy must exist only on regular (or very nearly regular) orbits; they\npotentially provide a map of the regular regions of the Milky Way potential.\nThis suggests a promising new direction for the use of tidal streams to\nconstrain the distribution of dark matter around our Galaxy.\n", "  We study spectral features in the gamma-ray emission from dark matter (DM)\nannihilation in the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM), with\neither neutralino or right-handed (RH) sneutrino DM. We perform a series of\nscans over the NMSSM parameter space, compute the DM annihilation cross section\ninto two photons and the contribution of box-shaped features, and compare them\nwith the limits derived from the Fermi-LAT search for gamma-ray lines using the\nlatest Pass 8 data. We implement the LHC bounds on the Higgs sector and on the\nmasses of supersymmetric particles as well as the constraints on low-energy\nobservables. We also consider the recent upper limits from the Fermi-LAT\nsatellite on the continuum gamma-ray emission from dwarf spheroidal galaxies\n(dSphs). We show that in the case of the RH sneutrino the constraint on\ngamma-ray spectral features can be more stringent than the dSph bounds. This is\ndue to the Breit-Wigner enhancement near the ubiquitous resonances with a CP\neven Higgs and the contribution of scalar and pseudoscalar Higgs final states\nto box-shaped features. By contrast, for neutralino DM, the di-photon final\nstate is only enhanced in the resonance with a $Z$ boson and box-shaped\nfeatures are even more suppressed. Therefore, the observation of spectral\nfeatures could constitute a discriminating factor between both models. In\naddition, we compare our results with direct DM searches, including the\nSuperCDMS and LUX limits on the elastic DM-nucleus scattering cross section and\nshow that some of these scenarios would be accessible to next generation\nexperiments. Thus, our findings strengthen the idea of complementarity among\ndistinct DM search strategies.\n", "  We analyze the steady-state transmission of high-momentum (high-$k$)\nelectromagnetic waves through metal-semiconductor multilayer systems with loss\nand gain in the near-infrared (NIR). Using a semi-classical optical gain model\nin conjunction with the scattering matrix method (SMM), we study indium gallium\narsenide phosphide (InGaAsP) quantum wells as the active semiconductor, in\ncombination with the metals, aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) and silver (Ag).\nUnder moderate external pumping levels, we find that NIR transmission through\nAg/InGaAsP systems may be enhanced by several orders of magnitude relative to\nthe unpumped case, over a large angular and frequency bandwidth. Conversely,\ntransmission enhancement through AZO/InGaAsP systems is orders of magnitude\nsmaller, and has a strong frequency dependence. We discuss the relative\nimportance of Purcell enhancement on our results and validate analytical\ncalculations based on the SMM with numerical finite-difference time domain\nsimulations.\n", "  Through consistent Kaluza-Klein reduction, we construct 3D $\\mathcal{N} =2$\ngauged supergravities corresponding to twisted compactifications of M5-branes\non a product of constant curvature Riemann surfaces, including\nK\\\"{a}hler-Einstein four-manifolds. We extend the reduction to fermionic\nsupersymmetry variations in order to determine the 3D Killing spinor equations\nand classify all timelike supersymmetric solutions. As a by-product, we\nidentify an infinite class of new supersymmetric warped $AdS_3$ (G\\\"odel) and\nwarped $d S_3$ solutions. Moreover, we show that the superpotential $T$ encodes\nthe central charge and R symmetry of the dual $\\mathcal{N} = (0,2)$ SCFTs in\nthe large $N$ limit. We demonstrate that the R symmetry matches the canonical\n$U(1)$ isometry from existing classifications of supersymmetric $AdS_3$\nsolutions to 11D supergravity with $\\mathcal{N} = (0,2)$ supersymmetry.\n", "  Can artificial communities of agents develop language with scaling relations\nclose to the Zipf law? As a preliminary answer to this question, we propose an\nAutomata Networks model of the formation of a vocabulary on a population of\nindividuals, under two in principle opposite strategies: the alignment and the\nleast effort principle. Within the previous account to the emergence of\nlinguistic conventions (specially, the Naming Game), we focus on modeling\nspeaker and hearer efforts as actions over their vocabularies and we study the\nimpact of these actions on the formation of a shared language. The numerical\nsimulations are essentially based on an energy function, that measures the\namount of local agreement between the vocabularies. The results suggests that\non one dimensional lattices the best strategy to the formation of shared\nlanguages is the one that minimizes the efforts of speakers on communicative\ntasks.\n", "  This work attempts to give new theoretical insights to the absence of\nintermediate stages in the evolution of language. In particular, it is\ndeveloped an automata networks approach to a crucial question: how a population\nof language users can reach agreement on a linguistic convention? To describe\nthe appearance of sharp transitions in the self-organization of language, it is\nadopted an extremely simple model of (working) memory. At each time step,\nlanguage users simply loss part of their word-memories. Through computer\nsimulations of low-dimensional lattices, it appear sharp transitions at\ncritical values that depend on the size of the vicinities of the individuals.\n", "  We perform a comprehensive study of charged lepton flavour violation in\nRandall-Sundrum (RS) models in a fully 5D quantum-field-theoretical framework.\nWe consider the RS model with minimal field content and a \"custodially\nprotected\" extension as well as three implementations of the IR-brane localized\nHiggs field, including the non-decoupling effect of the Kaluza-Klein (KK)\nexcitations of a narrow bulk Higgs. Our calculation provides the first complete\nresult for the flavour-violating electromagnetic dipole operator in\nRandall-Sundrum models. It contains three contributions with different\ndependence on the magnitude of the anarchic 5D Yukawa matrix, which can all be\nimportant in certain parameter regions. We study the typical range for the\nbranching fractions of mu -> e gamma, mu -> 3e, mu N -> e N as well as tau ->\nmu gamma, tau -> 3 mu and the electron electric dipole moment by a numerical\nscan in both the minimal and the custodial RS model. The combination of mu -> e\ngamma and mu N -> e N currently provides the most stringent constraint on the\nparameter space of the model. A typical lower limit on the KK scale T is around\n2 TeV in the minimal model (up to 4 TeV in the bulk Higgs case with large\nYukawa couplings), and around 4 TeV in the custodially protected model, which\ncorresponds to a mass of about 10 TeV for the first KK excitations, far beyond\nthe lower limit from the non-observation of direct production at the LHC.\n", "  In recent reports, suggestions have been put forward to the effect that\nparity and time-reversal (PT) symmetry in quantum mechanics is incompatible\nwith causality. It is shown here, in contrast, that PT-symmetric quantum\nmechanics is fully consistent with standard quantum mechanics. This follows\nfrom the surprising fact that the much-discussed metric operator on Hilbert\nspace is not physically observable. In particular, for closed quantum systems\nin finite dimensions there is no statistical test that one can perform on the\noutcomes of measurements to determine whether the Hamiltonian is Hermitian in\nthe conventional sense, or PT-symmetric---the two theories are\nindistinguishable. Nontrivial physical effects arising as a consequence of PT\nsymmetry are expected to be observed, nevertheless, for open quantum systems\nwith balanced gain and loss.\n", "  We compute upper limits on the nanohertz-frequency isotropic stochastic\ngravitational wave background (GWB) using the 9-year data release from the\nNorth American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav)\ncollaboration. We set upper limits for a GWB from supermassive black hole\nbinaries under power law, broken power law, and free spectral coefficient GW\nspectrum models. We place a 95\\% upper limit on the strain amplitude (at a\nfrequency of yr$^{-1}$) in the power law model of $A_{\\rm gw} < 1.5\\times\n10^{-15}$. For a broken power law model, we place priors on the strain\namplitude derived from simulations of Sesana (2013) and McWilliams et al.\n(2014). We find that the data favor a broken power law to a pure power law with\nodds ratios of 22 and 2.2 to one for the McWilliams and Sesana prior models,\nrespectively. The McWilliams model is essentially ruled out by the data, and\nthe Sesana model is in tension with the data under the assumption of a pure\npower law. Using the broken power-law analysis we construct posterior\ndistributions on environmental factors that drive the binary to the GW-driven\nregime including the stellar mass density for stellar-scattering, mass\naccretion rate for circumbinary disk interaction, and orbital eccentricity for\neccentric binaries, marking the first time that the shape of the GWB spectrum\nhas been used to make astrophysical inferences. We then place the most\nstringent limits so far on the energy density of relic GWs,\n$\\Omega_\\mathrm{gw}(f)\\,h^2 < 4.2 \\times 10^{-10}$, yielding a limit on the\nHubble parameter during inflation of $H_*=1.6\\times10^{-2}~m_{Pl}$, where\n$m_{Pl}$ is the Planck mass. Our limit on the cosmic string GWB,\n$\\Omega_\\mathrm{gw}(f)\\, h^2 < 2.2 \\times 10^{-10}$, translates to a\nconservative limit of $G\\mu<3.3\\times 10^{-8}$ - a factor of 4 better than the\njoint Planck and high-$l$ CMB data from other experiments.\n", "  Fast-spinning strongly magnetized newborn neutron stars, including nascent\nmagnetars, are popularly implemented as the engine of luminous stellar\nexplosions. Here, we consider the scenario that they power various\nstripped-envelope supernovae, not only super-luminous supernovae Ic but also\nbroad-line supernovae Ibc and possibly some ordinary supernovae Ibc. This\nscenario is also motivated by the hypothesis that Galactic magnetars largely\noriginate from fast-spinning neutron stars as remnants of stripped-envelope\nsupernovae. By consistently modeling the energy injection from magnetized wind\nand Ni decay, we show that proto-neutron stars with >~ 10 ms rotation and B_dip\n>~ 5 x 10^14 G can be harbored in ordinary supernovae Ibc. On the other hand,\nmillisecond proto-neuton stars can solely power broad-line supernovae Ibc if\nthey are born with poloidal magnetic field of B_dip >~ 5 x 10^14 G, and\nsuperluminous supernovae Ic with B_dip >~ 10^13 G. Then, we study how\nmulti-messenger emission can be used to discriminate such pulsar-driven\nsupernova models from other competitive scenarios. First, high-energy x-ray and\ngamma-ray emission from embryonic pulsar wind nebulae is a promising smoking\ngun of the underlying newborn pulsar wind. Follow-up observations of\nstripped-envelope supernovae using NuSTAR ~ 50-100 days after the explosion is\nstrongly encouraged for nearby objects. We also discuss possible effects of\ngravitational-waves on the spin-down of proto-neutron stars. If millisecond\nproto-neutron stars with B_dip <~ a few x 10^13 G emit gravitational waves\nthrough e.g., non-axisymmetric rotation deformed by the inner toroidal fields\nof B_t >~ 10^16 G, the gravitational wave signal can be detectable from\nordinary supernova Ibc in the Virgo cluster by Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo,\nand KAGRA.\n", "  The charged anisotropic star on paraboloidal spacetime is reported by\nchoosing particular form of radial pressure and electric field intensity. The\nnon-singular solution of Einstein-Maxwell system of equation have been derived\nand it is shown that model satisfy all the physical plausibility conditions. It\nis observed that in the absence of electric field intensity, model reduces to\nparticular case of uncharged Sharma \\& Ratanpal model. It is also observed that\nthe parameter used in electric field intensity directly effects the mass of the\nstar.\n", "  We derive a quantum master equation which describes the dynamics of the\nensemble-averaged state of homogeneous disorder models at short times, and\nmediates a transition from coherent superpositions into classical mixtures.\nWhile each single realization follows unitary dynamics, this decoherencelike\nbehavior arises as a consequence of the ensemble average. The master equation\nmanifestly reflects the translational invariance of the disorder correlations\nand allows us to relate the disorder-induced dynamics to a collisional\ndecoherence process, where the disorder correlations determine the spatial\ndecay of coherences. We apply our theory to the (one-dimensional) Anderson\nmodel.\n", "  We present a numerical approach to calculate non-equilibrium eigenstates of a\nperiodically time-modulated quantum system. The approach is based on the use of\na chain of single-step time-independent propagating operators. Each operator is\ntime-specific and constructed by combining the Magnus expansion of the\ntime-dependent system Hamiltonian with the Chebyshev expansion of an operator\nexponent. A construction of a unitary matrix of the Floquet operator, which\nevolves a system state over the full modulation period, is performed by\npropagating the identity matrix over the period. The independence of the\nevolutions of basis vectors makes the propagation stage suitable for\nimplementation on a parallel cluster. Once the propagation stage is completed,\na routine diagonalization of the Floquet matrix is performed. Finally, an\nadditional propagation round, now with the eigenvectors as the initial states,\nallows to resolve the time-dependence of the Floquet states and calculate their\ncharacteristics. We demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of the algorithm\nby applying it to calculate the Floquet states of two quantum models, namely\n(i) a synthesized random-matrix Hamiltonian and (ii) a many-body Bose-Hubbard\ndimer, both of the size up to $10^4$ states.\n", "  Few-body systems with access to multiple internal levels exhibit richness\nbeyond that typically found in their single-level counterparts. One example is\nthat of Efimov states in strongly-correlated spinor three-body systems. In [V.\nE. Colussi, C. H. Greene, and J. P. D'Incao, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 113}, 045302\n(2014)] this problem was analyzed for spinor condensates finding a complex\nlevel structure as in an early work [Bulgac and Efimov, Sov. J. Nucl. Phys. 22,\n153 (1976)] in nuclear physics, and the impact of Efimov physics on the general\nform of the scattering observables was worked out. In this paper we discuss the\nappearance of novel families of Efimov states in the spinor three-body problem.\n", "  Three-dimensional gapless semiconductors with quadratic band touching, such\nas HgTe, $\\alpha$-Sn, or Pr$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ are believed to display a\nnon-Fermi-liquid ground state due to long-range electron-electron interaction.\nWe argue that this state is inherently unstable towards spontaneous formation\nof a (topological) excitonic insulator. The instability can be parameterized by\na critical fermion number $N_c$. For $N < N_c$ the rotational symmetry is\nspontaneously broken, the system develops a gap in the spectrum, and features a\nfinite nematic order parameter. To leading order in the 1/N expansion and in\nthe static approximation, the analogy with the problem of dynamical mass\ngeneration in (2+1)-dimensional quantum electrodynamics yields $N_c =\n16/[3\\pi(\\pi-2)]$. Taking the important dynamical screening effects into\naccount, we find that $N_c \\geq 2.6(2)$ and therefore safely above the physical\nvalue of $N = 1$. Some experimental consequences of the nematic ground state\nare discussed.\n", "  We compare the absolute gain photometric calibration of the Planck/HFI and\nHerschel/SPIRE instruments on diffuse emission. The absolute calibration of HFI\nand SPIRE each relies on planet flux measurements and comparison with\ntheoretical far-infrared emission models of planetary atmospheres. We measure\nthe photometric cross calibration between the instruments at two overlapping\nbands, 545 GHz / 500 $\\mu$m and 857 GHz / 350 $\\mu$m. The SPIRE maps used have\nbeen processed in the Herschel Interactive Processing Environment (Version 12)\nand the HFI data are from the 2015 Public Data Release 2. For our study we used\n15 large fields observed with SPIRE, which cover a total of about 120 deg^2. We\nhave selected these fields carefully to provide high signal-to-noise ratio,\navoid residual systematics in the SPIRE maps, and span a wide range of surface\nbrightness. The HFI maps are bandpass-corrected to match the emission observed\nby the SPIRE bandpasses. The SPIRE maps are convolved to match the HFI beam and\nput on a common pixel grid. We measure the cross-calibration relative gain\nbetween the instruments using two methods in each field, pixel-to-pixel\ncorrelation and angular power spectrum measurements. The SPIRE / HFI relative\ngains are 1.047 ($\\pm$ 0.0069) and 1.003 ($\\pm$ 0.0080) at 545 and 857 GHz,\nrespectively, indicating very good agreement between the instruments. These\nrelative gains deviate from unity by much less than the uncertainty of the\nabsolute extended emission calibration, which is about 6.4% and 9.5% for HFI\nand SPIRE, respectively, but the deviations are comparable to the values 1.4%\nand 5.5% for HFI and SPIRE if the uncertainty from models of the common\ncalibrator can be discounted. Of the 5.5% uncertainty for SPIRE, 4% arises from\nthe uncertainty of the effective beam solid angle, which impacts the adopted\nSPIRE point source to extended source unit conversion factor (Abridged)\n", "  The theoretical description for the reflectivity properties of dielectric,\nmetal and semiconductor plates coated with graphene is developed in the\nframework of the Dirac model. Graphene is described by the polarization tensor\nallowing the analytic continuation to the real frequency axis. The plate\nmaterials are described by the frequency-dependent dielectric permittivities.\nThe general formulas for the reflection coefficients and reflectivities of the\ngraphene-coated plates, as well as their asymptotic expressions at high and low\nfrequencies, are derived. The developed theory is applied to the\ngraphene-coated dielectric (fused silica), metal (Au and Ni), and semiconductor\n(Si with various charge carrier concentrations) plates. In all these cases the\nimpact of graphene coating on the plate reflectivity properties is calculated\nover the wide frequency ranges. The obtained results can be used in many\napplications exploiting the graphene coatings, such as the optical detectors,\ntransparent conductors, anti-reflection surfaces etc.\n", "  We present a realistic modeling of the dipole component of the projected sky\ndistribution of NVSS radio galaxies. The modeling relies on mock catalogs\ngenerated within the context of $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology, in the linear regime of\nstructure formation. After removing the contribution from the solar motion, the\nmocks show that the remaining observed signal is mostly (70\\%) due to\nstructures within $z\\lesssim0.1$. The amplitude of the model signal depends on\nthe bias factor $b$ of the NVSS mock galaxies. For sources with flux density, $\nS> 15 \\; \\rm mJy$, the bias recipe inferred from higher order moments is\nconsistent with the observed dipole signal at $2.12\\sigma$. Flux thresholds\nabove $20 \\; \\rm mJy$ yield a disagreement close to the $3\\sigma $ level. A\nconstant high bias, $b=3$ is needed to mitigate the tension to the $\\sim\n2.3\\sigma$ level.\n", "  Next generation galaxy surveys demand the development of massive ensembles of\ngalaxy mocks to model the observables and their covariances, what is\ncomputationally prohibitive using $N$-body simulations. COLA is a novel method\ndesigned to make this feasible by following an approximate dynamics but with up\nto 3 orders of magnitude speed-ups when compared to an exact $N$-body. In this\npaper we investigate the optimization of the code parameters in the compromise\nbetween computational cost and recovered accuracy in observables such as\ntwo-point clustering and halo abundance. We benchmark those observables with a\nstate-of-the-art $N$-body run, the MICE Grand Challenge simulation (MICE-GC).\nWe find that using 40 time steps linearly spaced since $z_i \\sim 20$, and a\nforce mesh resolution three times finer than that of the number of particles,\nyields a matter power spectrum within $1\\%$ for $k \\lesssim 1\\,h {\\rm\nMpc}^{-1}$ and a halo mass function within $5\\%$ of those in the $N$-body. In\nturn the halo bias is accurate within $2\\%$ for $k \\lesssim 0.7\\,h {\\rm\nMpc}^{-1}$ whereas, in redshift space, the halo monopole and quadrupole are\nwithin $4\\%$ for $k \\lesssim 0.4\\,h {\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. These results hold for a\nbroad range in redshift ($0 < z < 1$) and for all halo mass bins investigated\n($M > 10^{12.5} \\, h^{-1} \\, {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$). To bring accuracy in clustering\nto one percent level we study various methods that re-calibrate halo masses\nand/or velocities. We thus propose an optimized choice of COLA code parameters\nas a powerful tool to optimally exploit future galaxy surveys.\n", "  We obtain Mathisson-Papapetrou-Tulczyjew-Dixon equations of a rotating body\nwith given values of spin and momentum starting from Lagrangian action without\nauxiliary variables. MPTD-equations correspond to minimal interaction of our\nspinning particle with gravity. We shortly discuss some novel properties\ndeduced from the Lagrangian form of MPTD-equations: emergence of an effective\nmetric instead of the original one, non-commutativity of coordinates of\nrepresentative point of the body, spin corrections to Newton potential due to\nthe effective metric as well as spin corrections to the expression for\nintegrals of motion of a given isometry.\n", "  In a collinear antiferromagnet with easy-axis anisotropy, symmetry dictates\nthat the spin wave modes must be doubly degenerate. Theses two modes,\ndistinguished by their opposite polarization and available only in\nantiferromagnets, give rise to a novel degree of freedom to encode and process\ninformation. We show that the spin wave polarization can be manipulated by an\nelectric field induced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and magnetic\nanisotropy. We propose a prototype spin wave field-effect transistor which\nrealizes a gate-tunable magnonic analog of the Faraday effect, and demonstrate\nits application in THz signal modulation. Our findings open up the exciting\npossibility of digital data processing utilizing antiferromagnetic spin waves\nand enable the direct projection of optical computing concepts onto the\nmesoscopic scale.\n", "  We study the QCD vacuum structure under the influence of an electromagnetic\nfield with a nonzero second Lorentz invariant $I_2=\\vec{E}\\cdot{\\vec B}$. We\nshow that the presence of $I_2$ can induce neutral pion ($\\pi^0$) condensation\nin the QCD vacuum through the electromagnetic triangle anomaly. Within the\nframeworks of chiral perturbation theory at leading small-momenta expansion as\nwell as the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model at leading $1/N_c$ expansion, we quantify\nthe dependence of the $\\pi^0$ condensate on $I_2$. The stability of the\n$\\pi^0$-condensed vacuum against the Schwinger charged pair production due to\nelectric field is also discussed.\n", "  [Abridged] Recent results from the BICEP, Keck Array and Planck\nCollaborations demonstrate that Galactic foregrounds are an unavoidable\nobstacle in the search for evidence of inflationary gravitational waves in the\ncosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization. Beyond the foregrounds, the\neffect of lensing by intervening large-scale structure further obscures all but\nthe strongest inflationary signals permitted by current data. With a plethora\nof ongoing and upcoming experiments aiming to measure these signatures, careful\nand self-consistent consideration of experiments' foreground- and\nlensing-removal capabilities is critical in obtaining credible forecasts of\ntheir performance. We investigate the capabilities of instruments such as\nAdvanced ACTPol, BICEP3 and Keck Array, CLASS, EBEX10K, PIPER, Simons Array,\nSPT-3G and SPIDER, and projects as COrE+, LiteBIRD-ext, PIXIE and Stage IV, to\nclean contamination due to polarized synchrotron and dust from raw\nmulti-frequency data, and remove lensing from the resulting co-added CMB maps\n(either using iterative CMB-only techniques or through cross-correlation with\nexternal data). Incorporating these effects, we present forecasts for the\nconstraining power of these experiments in terms of inflationary physics, the\nneutrino sector, and dark energy parameters. Made publicly available through an\nonline interface, this tool enables the next generation of CMB experiments to\nforeground-proof their designs, optimize their frequency coverage to maximize\nscientific output, and determine where cross-experimental collaboration would\nbe most beneficial. We find that analyzing data from ground, balloon and space\ninstruments in complementary combinations can significantly improve component\nseparation performance, delensing, and cosmological constraints over individual\ndatasets.\n", "  The main promise of tunnel FETs (TFETs) is to enable supply voltage\n($V_{DD}$) scaling in conjunction with dimension scaling of transistors to\nreduce power consumption. However, reducing $V_{DD}$ and channel length\n($L_{ch}$) typically deteriorates the ON- and OFF-state performance of TFETs,\nrespectively. Accordingly, there is not yet any report of a high perfor]mance\nTFET with both low V$_{DD}$ ($\\sim$0.2V) and small $L_{ch}$ ($\\sim$6nm). In\nthis work, it is shown that scaling TFETs in general requires scaling down the\nbandgap $E_g$ and scaling up the effective mass $m^*$ for high performance.\nQuantitatively, a channel material with an optimized bandgap\n($E_g\\sim1.2qV_{DD} [eV]$) and an engineered effective mass ($m*^{-1}\\sim40\nV_{DD}^{2.5} [m_0^{-1}]$) makes both $V_{DD}$ and $L_{ch}$ scaling feasible\nwith the scaling rule of $L_{ch}/V_{DD}=30~nm/V$ for $L_{ch}$ from 15nm to 6nm\nand corresponding $V_{DD}$ from 0.5V to 0.2V.\n", "  We present results from recent Suzaku and Chandra X-ray, and MMT optical\nobservations of the strongly merging \"double cluster\" A1750 out to its virial\nradius, both along and perpendicular to a putative large-scale structure\nfilament. Some previous studies of individual clusters have found evidence for\nICM entropy profiles that flatten at large cluster radii, as compared with the\nself-similar prediction based on purely gravitational models of hierarchical\ncluster formation, and gas fractions that rise above the mean cosmic value.\nWeakening accretion shocks and the presence of unresolved cool gas clumps, both\nof which are expected to correlate with large scale structure filaments, have\nbeen invoked to explain these results. In the outskirts of A1750, we find\nentropy profiles that are consistent with self-similar expectations, and gas\nfractions that are consistent with the mean cosmic value, both along and\nperpendicular to the putative large scale filament. Thus, we find no evidence\nfor gas clumping in the outskirts of A1750, in either direction. This may\nindicate that gas clumping is less common in lower temperature (kT~4keV), less\nmassive systems, consistent with some (but not all) previous studies of low\nmass clusters and groups. Cluster mass may therefore play a more important role\nin gas clumping than dynamical state. Finally, we find evidence for diffuse,\ncool (<1 keV) gas at large cluster radii (R200) along the filament, which is\nconsistent with the expected properties of the denser, hotter phase of the\nWHIM.\n", "  The static dielectric constant of liquid water is computed using classical\nforce field based molecular dynamics simulation at fixed electric displacement\nD. The method to constrain the electric displacement is the finite temperature\nclassical variant of the constant-D method developed by Stengel, Spaldin and\nVanderbilt (Nat. Phys. 2009, 5: 304). There is also a modification of this\nscheme imposing fixed values of the macroscopic field E. The method is applied\nto the popular SPC/E model of liquid water. We compare four different estimates\nof the dielectric constant, two obtained from fluctuations of the polarization\nat D = 0 and E = 0 and two from the variation of polarization with finite D and\nE. It is found that all four estimates agree when properly converged. The\ncomputational effort to achieve convergence varies however, with constant D\ncalculations being substantially more efficient. We attribute this difference\nto the much shorter relaxation time of longitudinal polarization compared to\ntransverse polarization accelerating constant D calculations.\n", "  We consider a branching-selection system of particles on the real line that\nevolves according to the following rules: each particle moves according to a\nBrownian motion during an exponential lifetime and then splits into two new\nparticles and, when a particle is at a distance $L$ of the highest particle, it\ndies without splitting. This model has been introduced by Brunet, Derrida,\nMueller and Munier in the physics literature and is called the $L$-branching\nBrownian motion. We show that the position of the system grows linearly at a\nvelocity $v_L$ almost surely and we compute the asymptotic behavior of $v_L$ as\n$L$ tends to infinity: $v_L = \\sqrt{2} - \\pi^2 / 2 \\sqrt{2} L^2 + o(1/L^2)$, as\nconjectured by Brunet, Derrida, Mueller and Munier. The proof makes use of\nresults by Berestycki, Berestycki and Schweinsberg concerning branching\nBrownian motion in a strip.\n", "  This paper presents experimental verification of below-cutoff transmission\nthrough miniaturized waveguides whose interior is coated with a thin\nanisotropic metamaterial liner possessing epsilon-negative and near-zero (ENNZ)\nproperties. These liners are realized using a simple, printed-circuit\nimplementation based on inductively loaded wires, and introduce an HE$_{11}$\nmode well below the natural cutoff frequency. The inclusion of the liner is\nshown to substantially improve the transmission between two embedded\nshielded-loop sources. A homogenization scheme is developed to characterize the\nliner's anisotropic effective-medium parameters, which is shown to accurately\ndescribe a set of frequency-reduced cutoffs. The fabrication of the lined\nwaveguide is discussed, and the experimental and simulated transmission results\nare shown to be in agreement.\n", "  In this chapter we introduce some of the basic models and concepts that will\nbe discussed throughout the volume. In particular we describe systems of\nnonlinear oscillators arranged on low-dimensional lattices and summarize the\nphenomenology of their transport properties.\n", "  Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are placing increasingly stringent constraints on\nthe strain amplitude of continuous gravitational waves emitted by supermassive\nblack hole binaries on subparsec scales. In this paper, we incorporate\nindependent information about the dynamical masses $M_{bh}$ of supermassive\nblack holes in specific galaxies at known distances and use this additional\ninformation to further constrain whether or not those galaxies could host a\ndetectable supermassive black hole binary. We estimate the strain amplitudes\nfrom individual binaries as a function of binary mass ratio for two samples of\nnearby galaxies: (1) those with direct dynamical measurements of $M_{bh}$ in\nthe literature, and (2) the 116 most massive early-type galaxies (and thus\nlikely hosts of the most massive black holes) within 108 Mpc from the MASSIVE\nSurvey. Our exploratory analysis shows that the current PTA upper limits on\ncontinuous waves (as a function of angular position in the sky) can already\nconstrain the mass ratios of hypothetical black hole binaries in many galaxies\nin our samples. The constraints are stronger for galaxies with larger $M_{bh}$\nand at smaller distances. For the black holes with $M_{bh} \\gtrsim 5\\times 10^9\nM_\\odot$ at the centers of NGC 1600, NGC 4889, NGC 4486 (M87) and NGC 4649\n(M60), any binary companion in orbit within the PTA frequency bands would have\nto have a mass ratio of a few percent or less.\n", "  We provide an explanation of recent experimental results of Xue et al., where\nfull revivals in a time-dependent quantum walk model with a periodically\nchanging coin are found. Using methods originally developed for \"electric\"\nwalks with a space-dependent, rather than a time-dependent coin, we provide a\nfull explanation of the observations of Xue et al. We extend the analysis from\nperiodic time-dependence to quasi-periodic behaviour with periods\nincommensurate to the step size. Spectral analysis, one of the principal tools\nfor the study of electric walks, fails for time-dependent systems, but we find\nqualitative propagation behaviour of the time-dependent system in close analogy\nto the electric case.\n", "  We investigate the effect of the hyperscaling violation on the holographic\nsuperconductors. In the s-wave model, we find that the critical temperature\ndecreases first and then increases as the hyperscaling violation increases, and\nthe mass of the scalar field will not modify the value of the hyperscaling\nviolation which gives the minimum critical temperature. We analytically confirm\nthe numerical results by using the Sturm-Liouville method with the higher order\ntrial function and improve the previous findings in J. High Energy Phys. {\\bf\n09}, 048 (2013). However, different from the s-wave case, we note that the\ncritical temperature decreases with the increase of the hyperscaling violation\nin the p-wave model. In addition, we observe that the hyperscaling violation\naffects the conductivity of the holographic superconductors and changes the\nexpected relation in the gap frequency in both s-wave and p-wave models.\n", "  Strongly interacting particles in one dimension subject to external\nconfinement have become a topic of considerable interest due to recent\nexperimental advances and the development of new theoretical methods to attack\nsuch systems. In the case of equal mass fermions or bosons with two or more\ninternal degrees of freedom, one can map the problem onto the well-known\nHeisenberg spin models. However, many interesting physical systems contain\nmixtures of particles with different masses. Therefore, a generalization of the\nrecent strong-coupling techniques would be highly desirable. This is\nparticularly important since such problems are generally considered\nnon-integrable and thus the hugely successful Bethe ansatz approach cannot be\napplied. Here we discuss some initial steps towards this goal by investigating\nsmall ensembles of one-dimensional harmonically trapped particles where\npairwise interactions are either vanishing or infinitely strong with focus on\nthe mass-imbalanced case. We discuss a (semi)-analytical approach to describe\nsystems using hyperspherical coordinates where the interaction is effectively\ndecoupled from the trapping potential. As an illustrative example we analyze\nmass-imbalanced four-particle two-species mixtures with strong interactions\nbetween the two species. For such systems we calculate the energies, densities\nand pair-correlation functions.\n", "  We introduce a general theoretical framework to study the shape dynamics of\nactively growing and remodeling surfaces. Using this framework we develop a\nphysical model for growing bacterial cell walls and study the interplay of cell\nshape with the dynamics of growth and constriction. The model allows us to\nderive constraints on cell wall mechanical energy based on the observed\ndynamics of cell shape. We predict that exponential growth in cell size\nrequires a constant amount of cell wall energy to be dissipated per unit\nvolume. We use the model to understand and contrast growth in bacteria with\ndifferent shapes such as spherical, ellipsoidal, cylindrical and toroidal\nmorphologies. Coupling growth to cell wall constriction, we predict a\ndiscontinuous shape transformation, from partial constriction to cell division,\nas a function of the chemical potential driving cell-wall synthesis. Our model\nfor cell wall energy and shape dynamics relates growth kinetics with cell\ngeometry, and provides a unified framework to describe the interplay between\nshape, growth and division in bacterial cells.\n", "  Smectic liquid crystals are remarkable, beautiful examples of materials\nmicrostructure, with ordered patterns of geometrically perfect ellipses and\nhyperbolas. The solution of the complex problem of filling three-dimensional\nspace with domains of focal conics under constraining boundary conditions\nyields a set of strict rules, which are similar to the compatibility conditions\nin a martensitic crystal. Here we present the rules giving compatible\nconditions for the concentric circle domains found at two-dimensional smectic\ninterfaces with planar boundary conditions. Using configurations generated by\nnumerical simulations, we develop a clustering algorithm to decompose the\nplanar boundaries into domains. The interfaces between different domains agree\nwell with the smectic compatibility conditions. We also discuss generalizations\nof our approach to describe the full three-dimensional smectic domains, where\nthe variant symmetry group is the Weyl-Poincar\\'e group of Lorentz boosts,\ntranslations, rotations, and dilatations.\n", "  The question of optical bandgap anisotropy in the monoclinic semiconductor\n$\\beta$-Ga2O3 was revisited by combining accurate optical absorption\nmeasurements with theoretical analysis, performed using different advanced\ncomputation methods. As expected, the bandgap edge of bulk $\\beta$-Ga2O3 was\nfound to be a function of light polarization and crystal orientation, with the\nlowest onset occurring at polarization in the ac crystal plane around 4.5-4.6\neV; polarization along b unambiguously shifts the onset up by 0.2 eV. The\ntheoretical analysis clearly indicates that the shift of the b onset is due to\na suppression of the transition matrix elements of the three top valence bands\nat $\\Gamma$ point.\n", "  Using density-functional ab initio theoretical techniques, we study\n(Ga$_{1-x}$In$_x$)$_2$O$_3$ in both its equilibrium structures (monoclinic\n$\\beta$ and bixbyite) and over the whole range of composition. We establish\nthat the alloy exhibits a large and temperature-independent miscibility gap. On\nthe low-$x$ side, the favored phase is isostructural with $\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$;\non the high-$x$ side, it is isostructural with bixbyite In$_2$O$_3$. The\nmiscibility gap opens between approximately 15\\% and 55\\% In content for the\nbixbyite alloy grown epitaxially on In$_2$O$_3$, and 15\\% and 85\\% In content\nfor the free-standing bixbyite alloy. The gap, volume and band offsets to the\nparent compound also exhibit anomalies as function of $x$. Specifically, the\noffsets in epitaxial conditions are predominantly type-B staggered, but have\nopposite signs in the two end-of-range phases.\n", "  The $s_\\pm$ and $s_{++}$ models for the superconducting state are subject of\nintense studies regarding Fe-based superconductors. Depending on the\nparameters, disorder may leave intact or suppress $T_c$ in these models. Here\nwe study the special case of disorder with equal values of intra- and interband\nimpurity potentials in the two-band $s_\\pm$ and $s_{++}$ models. We show that\nthis case can be considered as an isolated point and $T_c$ there has maximal\ndamping for a wide range of parameters.\n", "  Slow oscillations (SlO) of magnetoresistance is a convenient tool to measure\nelectronic structure parameters in quasi-two-dimensional metals. We study the\npossibility to apply this method to multi-band conductors, e.g. to iron-based\nhigh-temperature superconducting materials. We show that SlO can be used to\nmeasure the interlayer transfer integral in multi-band conductors similar to\nsingle-band metals. In addition, the SlO allow to measure and compare the\neffective masses or the electron scattering rates in various bands.\n", "  We employ new calculational technique and present complete list of classical\n$r$-matrices for $D=4$ complex homogeneous orthogonal Lie algebra\n$\\mathfrak{o}(4;\\mathbb{C})$, the rotational symmetry of four-dimensional\ncomplex space-time. Further applying reality conditions we obtain the classical\n$r$-matrices for all possible real forms of $\\mathfrak{o}(4;\\mathbb{C})$:\nEuclidean $\\mathfrak{o}(4)$, Lorentz $\\mathfrak{o}(3,1)$, Kleinian\n$\\mathfrak{o}(2,2)$ and quaternionic $\\mathfrak{o}^{\\star}(4)$ Lie algebras.\nFor $\\mathfrak{o}(3,1)$ we get known four classical $D=4$ Lorentz $r$-matrices,\nbut for other real Lie algebras (Euclidean, Kleinian, quaternionic) we provide\nnew results and mention some applications.\n", "  The Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB collider in Japan is designed to\nindirectly probe new physics using approximately 50 times the data recorded by\nits predecessor. An accurate determination of the decay-point position of\nsubatomic particles such as beauty and charm hadrons as well as a precise\nmeasurement of low-momentum charged particles will play a key role in this\npursuit. These will be accomplished by an inner tracking device comprising two\nlayers of pixelated silicon detector and four layers of silicon vertex detector\nbased on double-sided microstrip sensors. We describe herein the design,\nprototyping and construction efforts of the Belle-II silicon vertex detector.\n", "  All quantum optomechanics experiments to date operate at cryogenic\ntemperatures, imposing severe technical challenges and fundamental constraints.\nHere we present a novel design of on-chip mechanical resonators which exhibit\nfundamental modes with frequencies $f$ and mechanical quality factors\n$Q_\\mathrm{m}$ sufficient to enter the optomechanical quantum regime at room\ntemperature. We overcome previous limitations by designing ultrathin,\nhigh-stress silicon nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$) membranes, with tensile stress in the\nresonators' clamps close to the ultimate yield strength of the material. By\npatterning a photonic crystal on the SiN membranes, we observe reflectivities\ngreater than 99%. These on-chip resonators have remarkably low mechanical\ndissipation, with $Q_\\mathrm{m}$$\\sim$$10^8$, while at the same time exhibiting\nlarge reflectivities. This makes them a unique platform for experiments towards\nthe observation of massive quantum behavior at room temperature.\n", "  We give predictions for the nonperturbative (intrinsic) contribution to the\n$s(x) - \\bar{s}(x)$ asymmetry of the nucleon sea. For this purpose we use\ndifferent light-front wave functions inspired by the AdS/QCD formalism,\ntogether with a model of the nucleon in terms of meson-baryon fluctuations. The\nholographic wave functions for an arbitrary number of constituents, recently\nderived by us, give results quite close to known parametrizations that appear\nin the literature.\n", "  Thermal conductance of metal contacts on transferred graphene (trG) could be\nsignificantly reduced from the intrinsic value of similar contacts on as-grown\ngraphene (grG), due to additional resistance by increased roughness, residues,\noxides and voids. In this paper, we compare the thermal conductance (G) of\nAl/trG/Cu interfaces with that of Al/grG/Cu interfaces to understand heat\ntransfer across metal contacts on transferred graphene. Our samples are\npolycrystalline graphene grown on Cu foils by chemical vapor deposition (CVD)\nand CVD-grown graphene transferred to evaporated Cu thin films. We find that\nfor the Al/grG/Cu interfaces of as-grown CVD graphene, G=31 MW m^{-2} K^{-1} at\nroom temperature, two orders of magnitude lower than that of Al/Cu interfaces.\nFor most as-transferred graphene on Cu films, G=20 MW m^{-2} K^{-1}, 35% lower\nthan that of as-grown CVD graphene. We carefully rule out the contributions of\nresidues, native oxides and interfaces roughness, and attribute the difference\nin the thermal conductance of as-grown and as-transferred CVD graphene to\ndifferent degrees of conformity of graphene to the Cu substrates. We find that\na contact area of 50% only reduces the thermal conductance by 35%, suggesting\nthat a small amount of heat transfer occurs across voids at graphene\ninterfaces. We successfully improve the conformity of the as-transferred\ngraphene to the substrates by annealing the samples at 300{\\deg}C, and thus\nenhance the thermal conductance of the transferred graphene to the intrinsic\nvalue. From the temperature dependence measurements of G of Al/trG/Cu and\nAl/grG/Cu interfaces, we also confirm that phonons are the dominant heat\ncarries across the metal/graphene/metal interfaces despite a substantial\ncarrier concentration of 3x10^{12} cm^{-2} induced in the graphene.\n", "  We study the generation of quantum correlations between two excitonic quantum\ndot qubits due to their interaction with the same phonon environment. Such\ngeneration results from the fact that during the pure dephasing process at\nfinite temperatures, each exciton becomes entangled with the phonon\nenvironment. We find that for a wide range of temperatures quantum correlations\nare created due to the interaction. The temperature-dependence of the amount of\ncorrelations created displays a trade-off type behaviour; for small\ntemperatures the phonon-induced distrubance of the qubit states is too small to\nlead to a distinct change of the two-qubit state, hence, the amount of created\ncorrelations is small, while for large temperatures the pure dephasing is not\naccompanied by the creation of entanglement between the qubits and the\nenvironment, so the environment cannot mediate qubit-qubit quantum\ncorrelations.\n", "  We examine the adiabatic preparation of crystalline phases of Rydberg\nexcitations in a one-dimensional lattice gas by frequency sweep of the\nexcitation laser, as proposed by Pohl et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 043002\n(2010)] and recently realized experimentally by Schau{\\ss} et al. [Science 347,\n1455 (2015)]. We find that the preparation of crystals of a few Rydberg\nexcitations in a unitary system of several tens of atoms requires exceedingly\nlong times for the adiabatic following of the ground state of the system\nHamiltonian. Using quantum stochastic (Monte-Carlo) wavefunction simulations,\nwe show that realistic decay and dephasing processes affecting the atoms during\nthe preparation lead to a final state of the system that has only a small\noverlap with the target crystalline state. Yet, the final number and highly\nsub-Poissonian statistics of Rydberg excitations and their spatial order are\nlittle affected by the relaxations.\n", "  The possibility that metals may support ferroelectricity is an open issue.\nAnderson and Blount showed that certain martensitic transitions involve\ninversion symmetry breaking and the formal existence of a polar axis, so\n'metallic ferroelectric' behavior has been claimed for metals undergoing a\ncentrosymmetric (CS) to non-CS structural transformation (Cd2ReO7, LiOsO3) or\nnatively non-CS (SrCaRu2O), or for ferroelectric insulators whose polar\ndistortion survives moderate metallicity induced by doping or proximity.\nHowever, none of these systems, nor any other to our knowledge, embodies a\ntruly ferroelectric metal with native switchable polarization and native\nmetallicity coexisting in a single phase. Here we report the first-ever\ntheoretical prediction of such a material. By first-principles calculations, we\nshow that the layered perovskite Bi5Ti5O17 has a non-zero density of states at\nthe Fermi level and metal-like conductivity, as well as a spontaneous\npolarization in zero field. Further, we predict that the polarization of\nBi5Ti5O17 is switchable both in principle, as the material complies with the\nsufficient symmetry requirements, and in practice, as Bi5Ti5O17 can sustain a\nsizable potential drop along the polar direction, as needed to revert its\npolarization by application of an electric bias.\n", "  Disorder induced melting, where the increase in positional entropy created by\nrandom pinning sites drives the order-disorder transition in a periodic solid,\nprovides an alternate route to the more conventional thermal melting. Here,\nusing real space imaging of the vortex lattice through scanning tunneling\nspectroscopy, we show that in the presence of weak pinning, the vortex lattice\nin a type II superconductor disorders through two distinct topological\ntransitions. Across each transition, we separately identify metastable states\nformed through superheating of the low temperature state or supercooling of the\nhigh temperature state. Comparing crystals with different levels of pinning we\nconclude that the two-step melting is fundamentally associated with the\npresence of random pinning which generates topological defects in the ordered\nvortex lattice.\n", "  We study nonequilibrium dynamics of the quantum Ising chain at zero\ntemperature when the transverse field is varied stochastically. In the\nequivalent fermion representation, the equation of motion of Majorana operators\nis derived in the form of a one-dimensional, continuous-time quantum random\nwalk with stochastic, time-dependent transition amplitudes. This type of\nexternal noise gives rise to decoherence in the associated quantum walk and the\nsemiclassical wave-packet generally has a diffusive behavior. As a consequence,\nin the quantum Ising chain, the average entanglement entropy grows in time as\n$t^{1/2}$ and the logarithmic average magnetization decays in the same form. In\nthe case of a dichotomous noise, when the transverse-field is changed in\ndiscrete time-steps, $\\tau$, there can be excitation modes, for which coherence\nis maintained, provided their energy satisfies $\\epsilon_k \\tau\\approx n\\pi$\nwith a positive integer $n$. If the dispersion of $\\epsilon_k$ is quadratic,\nthe long-time behavior of the entanglement entropy and the logarithmic\nmagnetization is dominated by these ballistically traveling coherent modes and\nboth will have a $t^{3/4}$ time-dependence.\n", "  Magnetized high-energy-density plasmas can often have strong electromagnetic\nfluctuations whose correlation scale is smaller than the electron Larmor\nradius. Radiation from the electrons in such plasmas, which markedly differs\nfrom both synchrotron and cyclotron radiation, and their energy and pitch-angle\ndiffusion are tightly related. In this paper, we present a comprehensive\ntheoretical and numerical study of the particles' transport in both cold,\n\"small-scale\" Langmuir and Whistler-mode turbulence and its relation to the\nspectra of radiation simultaneously produced by these particles. We emphasize\nthat this relation is a superb diagnostic tool of laboratory, astrophysical,\ninterplanetary, and solar plasmas with a mean magnetic field and strong\nsmall-scale turbulence.\n", "  Exceptional Field Theory employs an extended spacetime to make supergravity\nfully covariant under the U-duality groups of M-theory. This allows for the\nwave and monopole solutions to be combined into a single solution which obeys a\ntwisted self-duality relation. All fundamental, solitonic and Dirichlet branes\nof ten- and eleven-dimensonal supergravity may be extracted from this single\nsolution in Exceptional Field Theory.\n", "  Electronic devices composed of single molecules constitute the ultimate limit\nin the continued downscaling of electronic components. A key challenge for\nsingle-molecule electronics is to control the temperature of these junctions.\nControlling heating and cooling effects in individual vibrational modes, can in\nprinciple, be utilized to increase stability of single-molecule junctions under\nbias, to pump energy into particular vibrational modes to perform\ncurrent-induced reactions or to increase the resolution in inelastic electron\ntunneling spectroscopy by controlling the life-times of phonons in a molecule\nby suppressing absorption and external dissipation processes. Under bias the\ncurrent and the molecule exchange energy, which typically results in heating of\nthe molecule. However, the opposite process is also possible, where energy is\nextracted from the molecule by the tunneling current. Designing a molecular\n'heat sink' where a particular vibrational mode funnels heat out of the\nmolecule and into the leads would be very desirable. It is even possible to\nimagine how the vibrational energy of the other vibrational modes could be\nfunneled into the 'cooling mode', given the right molecular design. Previous\nefforts to understand heating and cooling mechanisms in single molecule\njunctions, have primarily been concerned with small models, where it is unclear\nwhich molecular systems they correspond to. In this paper, our focus is on\nsuppressing heating and obtaining current-induced cooling in certain\nvibrational modes. Strategies for cooling vibrational modes in single-molecule\njunctions are presented, together with atomistic calculations based on those\nstrategies. Cooling and reduced heating are observed for two different cooling\nschemes in calculations of atomistic single-molecule junctions.\n", "  A Cooper pair splitter consists of two quantum dots side-coupled to a\nconventional superconductor. Usually, the quantum dots are assumed to have a\nlarge charging energy compared to the superconducting gap, in order to suppress\nprocesses other than the coherent splitting of Cooper pairs. In this work, in\ncontrast, we investigate the limit in which the charging energy is smaller than\nthe superconducting gap. This allows us, in particular, to study the effect of\na Zeeman field comparable to the charging energy. We find analytically that in\nthis parameter regime the superconductor mediates an inter-dot tunneling term\nwith a spin symmetry determined by the Zeeman field. Together with\nelectrostatically tunable quantum dots, we show that this makes it possible to\nengineer a spin triplet state shared between the quantum dots. Compared to\nprevious works, we thus extend the capabilities of the Cooper pair splitter to\ncreate entangled non local electron pairs.\n", "  Black hole microstates and their approximate thermodynamic properties can be\nstudied using heavy-light correlation functions in AdS/CFT. Universal features\nof these correlators can be extracted from the Virasoro conformal blocks in\nCFT2, which encapsulate quantum gravitational effects in AdS3. At infinite\ncentral charge c, the Virasoro vacuum block provides an avatar of the black\nhole information paradox in the form of periodic Euclidean-time singularities\nthat must be resolved at finite c.\n  We compute Virasoro blocks in the heavy-light, large c limit, extending our\nprevious results by determining perturbative 1/c corrections. We obtain\nexplicit closed-form expressions for both the `semi-classical' $h_L^2 / c^2$\nand `quantum' $h_L / c^2$ corrections to the vacuum block, and we provide\nintegral formulas for general Virasoro blocks. We comment on the interpretation\nof our results for thermodynamics, discussing how monodromies in Euclidean time\ncan arise from AdS calculations using `geodesic Witten diagrams'. We expect\nthat only non-perturbative corrections in 1/c can resolve the singularities\nassociated with the information paradox.\n", "  It has been proposed that adding disorder to a topologically trivial mercury\ntelluride/cadmium telluride (HgTe/CdTe) quantum well can induce a transition to\na topologically nontrivial state. The resulting state was termed topological\nAnderson insulator and was found in computer simulations of the\nBernevig-Hughes-Zhang model. Here, we show that the topological Anderson\ninsulator is a more universal phenomenon and also appears in the Kane-Mele\nmodel of topological insulators on a honeycomb lattice. We numerically\ninvestigate the interplay of the relevant parameters, and establish the\nparameter range in which the topological Anderson insulator exists. A staggered\nsublattice potential turns out to be a necessary condition for the transition\nto the topological Anderson insulator. For weak enough disorder, a calculation\nbased on the lowest-order Born approximation reproduces quantitatively the\nnumerical data. Our results thus considerably increase the number of candidate\nmaterials for the topological Anderson insulator phase.\n", "  The one loop contribution to the lepton flavor violating decay\n$h^0\\rightarrow \\mu\\tau$ of the SM-like neutral Higgs (LFVHD) in the 3-3-1\nmodel with neutral lepton is calculated using the unitary gauge. We have\nchecked in detail that the total contribution is exactly finite, and the\ndivergent cancellations happen separately in two parts of active neutrinos and\nexotic heavy leptons. By numerical investigation, we have indicated that the\none-loop contribution of the active neutrinos is very suppressed while that of\nexotic leptons is rather large. The branching ratio of the LFVHD strongly\ndepends on the Yukawa couplings between exotic leptons and $SU(3)_L$ Higgs\ntriplets. This ratio can reach $10^{-5}$ providing large Yukawa couplings and\nconstructive correlations of the $SU(3)_L$ scale ($v_3$) and the charged Higgs\nmasses. The branching ratio decreases rapidly with the small Yukawa couplings\nand large $v_3$.\n", "  We demonstrate a new method to coherently excite and control the quantum spin\nstates of an atomic Bose gas using parametric excitation of the collective spin\nby time varying the relative strength of the Zeeman and spin-dependent\ncollisional interaction energies at multiples of the natural frequency of the\nsystem. Compared to the usual single-particle quantum control techniques used\nto excite atomic spins (e.g. Rabi oscillations using rf or microwave fields),\nthe method demonstrated here is intrinsically many-body, requiring\ninter-particle interactions. While parametric excitation of a classical system\nis ineffective from the ground state, we show that in our quantum system,\nparametric excitation from the quantum ground state leads to the generation of\nquantum squeezed states.\n", "  An objective definition of pragmatic information and the consideration of\nrecent results about information processing in the human brain can help\novercome some traditional difficulties with the interpretation of quantum\nmechanics. Rather than attempting to define information ab initio, I introduce\nthe concept of interaction between material bodies as a primary concept. Two\ndistinct categories can be identified: 1) Interactions which can always be\nreduced to a superposition of physical interactions (forces) between elementary\nconstituents; 2) Interactions between complex bodies which cannot be reduced to\na superposition of interactions between parts, and in which patterns and forms\n(in space and/or time) play the determining role. Pragmatic information is then\ndefined as the correspondence between a given pattern and the ensuing\npattern-specific change. I will show that pragmatic information is a biological\nconcept that plays no active role in the purely physical domain; it only does\nso when a living organism intervenes. The consequences for the foundations of\nboth classical and quantum physics are important and will be discussed in\ndetail. Since by its very definition pragmatic information (the one our brain\nuses to represent, think about and react to the outside world)cannot operate in\nthe quantum domain, it is advisable to refrain from using it in our mental\nrepresentation of what is happening 'inside' a quantum system. Although the\ntheoretical framework developed for quantum mechanics handles mathematical\nentities specifically attributed to a quantum system, the only truly pragmatic\ninformation it can provide relates to macroscopic effects on the environment\n(natural, or artificial as in a measurement instrument) with which the system\ninteracts.\n", "  We develop, analyse and numerically simulate a model of a prototype,\nglucose-driven, rhythmic drug delivery device, aimed at hormone therapies, and\nbased on chemomechanical interaction in a polyelectrolyte gel membrane. The\npH-driven interactions trigger volume phase transitions between the swollen and\ncollapsed states of the gel.For a robust set of material parameters, we find a\nclass of solutions of the governing system that oscillate between such states,\nand cause the membrane to rhythmically swell, allowing for transport of the\ndrug, fuel and reaction products across it, and collapse, hampering all\ntransport across it. The frequency of the oscillations can be adjusted so that\nit matches the natural frequency of the hormone to be released. The work is\nlinked to extensive laboratory experimental studies of the device built by\nSiegel's team. The thinness of the membrane and its clamped boundary, together\nwith the homogeneously held conditions in the experimental apparatus, justify\nneglecting spatial dependence on the fields of the problem. Upon identifying\nthe forces and energy relevant to the system, and taking into account its\ndissipative properties, we apply Rayleigh's variational principle to obtain the\ngoverning equations. The material assumptions guarantee the monotonicity of the\nsystem and lead to the existence of a three dimensional limit cycle. By scaling\nand asymptotic analysis, this limit cycle is found to be related to a\ntwo-dimensional one that encodes the volume phase transitions of the model. The\nidentification of the relevant parameter set of the model is aided by a Hopf\nbifurcation study of steady state solutions.\n", "  In this work we present a robust and accurate arbitrary order solver for the\nfixed-boundary plasma equilibria in toroidally axisymmetric geometries. To\nachieve this we apply the mimetic spectral element formulation presented in\n[56] to the solution of the Grad-Shafranov equation. This approach combines a\nfinite volume discretization with the mixed finite element method. In this way\nthe discrete differential operators ($\\nabla$, $\\nabla\\times$, $\\nabla\\cdot$)\ncan be represented exactly and metric and all approximation errors are present\nin the constitutive relations. The result of this formulation is an arbitrary\norder method even on highly curved meshes. Additionally, the integral of the\n\\reviewerone{toroidal current $J_{\\phi}$} is exactly equal to the boundary\nintegral of the poloidal field over the plasma boundary. This property can play\nan important role in the coupling between equilibrium and transport solvers.\nThe proposed solver is tested on a varied set of plasma cross-sections (smooth\nand with an X-point) and also for a wide range of pressure and\n\\reviewertwo{toroidal magnetic flux profiles}. Equilibria accurate up to\nmachine precision are obtained. Optimal algebraic convergence rates of order\n$(p+1)$ and geometric convergence rates are shown for Soloviev solutions\n(including high Shafranov shifts), field-reversed configuration (FRC) solutions\nand spheromak analytical solutions. The robustness of the method is\ndemonstrated for non-linear test cases, in particular on an equilibrium\nsolution with a pressure pedestal.\n", "  Like many other advanced imaging methods, x-ray phase contrast imaging and\ntomography require mathematical inversion of the observed data to obtain\nreal-space information. While an accurate forward model describing the\ngenerally nonlinear image formation from a given object to the observations is\noften available, explicit inversion formulas are typically not known. Moreover,\nthe measured data might be insufficient for stable image reconstruction, in\nwhich case it has to be complemented by suitable a priori information. In this\nwork, regularized Newton methods are presented as a general framework for the\nsolution of such ill-posed nonlinear imaging problems. For a proof of\nprinciple, the approach is applied to x-ray phase contrast imaging in the\nnear-field propagation regime. Simultaneous recovery of the phase- and\namplitude from a single near-field diffraction pattern without homogeneity\nconstraints is demonstrated for the first time. The presented methods further\npermit all-at-once phase contrast tomography, i.e. simultaneous phase retrieval\nand tomographic inversion. We demonstrate the potential of this approach by\nthree-dimensional imaging of a colloidal crystal at 95 nm isotropic resolution.\n", "  Using density-functional ab initio calculations, we provide a revised phase\ndiagram of (Ga$_{1-x}$In$_{x})_2$O$_3$. Three phases --monoclinic, hexagonal,\ncubic bixbyite-- compete for the ground state. In particular, in the\n$x$$\\sim$0.5 region we expect coexistence of hexagonal, $\\beta$, and bixbyite\n(the latter separating into binary components). Over the whole $x$ range,\nmixing occurs in three disconnected regions, and non-mixing in two additional\ndistinct regions. We then explore the permanent polarization of the various\nphases, finding that none of them is polar at any concentration, despite the\npossible symmetry reductions induced by alloying. On the other hand, we find\nthat the $\\varepsilon$ phase of Ga$_2$O$_3$ stabilized in recent growth\nexperiments is pyroelectric --i.e. locked in a non-switchable polarized\nstructure-- with ferroelectric-grade polarization and respectable piezoelectric\ncoupling. We suggest that this phase could be used profitably to produce\nhigh-density electron gases in transistor structures.\n", "  We study properties of neutral and charged mesons in strong magnetic fields\n|eB|>> Lambda_QCD^2 with Lambda_QCD being the QCD renormalization scale.\nAssuming long-range interactions, we examine magnetic-field dependences of\nvarious quantities such as the constituent quark mass, chiral condensate, meson\nspectra, and meson wavefunctions by analyzing the Schwinger-Dyson and\nBethe-Salpeter equations. Based on the density of states obtained from these\nanalyses, we extend the hadron resonance gas (HRG) model to investigate\nthermodynamics at large B. As B increases the meson energy behaves as a slowly\ngrowing function of the meson's transverse momenta, and thus a large number of\nmeson states is accommodated in the low energy domain; the density of states at\nlow temperature is proportional to B^2. This extended transverse phase space in\nthe infrared regime significantly enhances the HRG pressure at finite\ntemperature, so that the system reaches the percolation or chiral restoration\nregime at lower temperature compared to the case without a magnetic field; this\nsimple picture would offer a gauge invariant and intuitive explanation of the\ninverse magnetic catalysis.\n", "  We calculate thermal fluctuation properties: volume-averaged order parameter,\nHelmholtz free and internal energies, and their variances of a supersaturated\ndisordered phase in the Gibbs canonical ensemble for an asymmetric (third-order\ninteractions), athermal (independence of the supersaturation and thermal noise)\neffective Hamiltonian. These properties are different from those of the\nsymmetric thermal one with the most important differences being the phase\ncoexistence and \"thermal expansion.\" The fluctuation properties of the system\nwere calculated theoretically, using the perturbation method, and numerically,\nusing the \"brute force\" simulations method. Overall, the numerical calculations\nmatch the theory within the accuracy of the numerical method. However, a\ndiscrepancy of the dependence of the internal energy and its variance on the\nsupersaturation exists. Results of the present study can be used for\ncalculations of the fluctuation properties of the systems and modeling of\nnucleation and other rare events in the framework of the Ginzburg-Landau\nmethod.\n", "  We examine the holographic entanglement entropy of spherical regions in de\nSitter space in the presence of massive flavour fields which are modelled by\nprobe D7 branes in AdS_5xS^5. We focus on the finite part of the massive\ncorrection to the entropy in the limits of small mass and large mass that are\nseparated by a phase transition between two topologically distinct brane\nembeddings. For small masses, it approaches the flat space result for small\nspheres, whereas for large spheres there is a term that goes as the log of the\nsphere radius. For large masses, we find evidence for a universal contribution\nlogarithmic in the mass. In all cases the entanglement entropy is smooth as the\nsphere radius crosses the horizon.\n", "  An exact solution for single electron states on mezoscopic rings with the\nRashba coupling and in the presence of external magnetic and electric fields is\nderived by means of a unitary transformation. The transformation maps the model\nto a bare ring, which gives the possibility of a very simple formulation of\nsingle or many electron problems. As an example some exact results for spin and\nenergy levels are presented.\n", "  We consider a strongly correlated quantum dot, tunnel coupled to two\nsuperconducting leads and capacitively coupled to a single mode microwave\ncavity. When the superconducting gap is the largest energy scale, multiple\nShiba states are formed inside the gap. The competition of these states for the\nground state signals a quantum phase transition. We demonstrate that photonic\nmeasurements can be used to probe such localized Shiba states. Moreover, the\nquantum phase transition can be pinpointed exactly from the sudden change in\nthe transmission signal. Calculations were performed using the numerical\nrenormalization group approach.\n", "  We analytically study the holographic superfluid phase transition in the AdS\nsoliton background by using the variational method for the Sturm-Liouville\neigenvalue problem. By investigating the holographic s-wave and p-wave\nsuperfluid models in the probe limit, we observe that the spatial component of\nthe gauge field will hinder the phase transition. Moreover, we note that,\ndifferent from the AdS black hole spacetime, in the AdS soliton background the\nholographic superfluid phase transition always belongs to the second order and\nthe critical exponent of the system takes the mean-field value in both s-wave\nand p-wave models. Our analytical results are found to be in good agreement\nwith the numerical findings.\n", "  The goal of nuclear astrophysics is to measure cross sections of nuclear\nphysics reactions of interest in astrophysics. At stars temperatures, these\ncross sections are very low due to the suppression of the Coulomb barrier.\nCosmic ray induced background can seriously limit the determination of reaction\ncross sections at energies relevant to astrophysical processes and experimental\nsetups should be arranged in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio.\nPlacing experiments in underground sites, however, reduces this background\nopening the way towards ultra low cross section determination. LUNA (Laboratory\nfor Underground Nuclear Astrophysics) was pioneer in this sense. Two\naccelerators were mounted at the INFN National Laboratories of Gran Sasso\n(LNGS) allowing to study nuclear reactions close to stellar energies. A summary\nof the relevant technology used, including accelerators, target production and\ncharacterisation, and background treatment is given.\n", "  It is firmly established by experimental results that neutrinos are almost\n100\\% longitudinally polarized and left-handed. It is also confirmed by\nneutrino oscillation experiments that neutrinos have tiny but non-zero masses.\nSince their masses are non-zero the neutrinos cannot be strictly described by\npure helicity states which coincide with the chirality eigenstates. On the\nother hand, it is generally assumed that ultrarelativistic massive fermions can\nbe described well enough by the Weyl equations. This assumption obviously\nexplains why the neutrinos are almost 100\\% longitudinally polarized. We\ndiscuss the validity of this assumption and show that the assumption is\nfallacious for a fermion with a general spin orientation. For instance, a\nfermion with a transverse polarization (relative to its momentum) cannot be\ndescribed by one of the Weyl equations even in the ultrarelativistic limit.\nHence, the fact that neutrinos are almost completely longitudinally polarized\ncannot be explained in the basis of relativistic quantum mechanics or quantum\nfield theory. As a solution to this problem, we propose a new hypothesis\naccording to which neutrinos are strictly described by pure helicity states\nalthough they are not massless.\n", "  Transition frequencies of atoms and ions are among the most accurately\naccessible quantities in nature, playing important roles in pushing the\nfrontiers of science by testing fundamental laws of physics, in addition to a\nwide range of applications such as satellite navigation systems. Atomic clocks\nbased on optical transitions approach uncertainties of $10^{-18}$, where full\nfrequency descriptions are far beyond the reach of the SI second. Frequency\nratios of such super clocks, on the other hand, are not subject to this\nlimitation. They can therefore verify consistency and overall accuracy for an\nensemble of super clocks, an essential step towards a redefinition of the\nsecond. However, with the measurement stabilities so far reported for such\nfrequency ratios, a confirmation to $1 \\times 10^{-18}$ uncertainty would\nrequire an averaging time $\\tau$ of multiple months. Here we report a\nmeasurement of the frequency ratio of neutral ytterbium and strontium clocks\nwith a much improved stability of $4 \\times 10^{-16} ({\\tau}/s)^{-1/2}$.\nEnabled by the high stability of optical lattice clocks interrogating hundreds\nof atoms, this marks a 90-fold reduction in the required averaging time over a\nprevious record-setting experiment that determined the ratio of Al+ and Hg+\nsingle-ion clocks to an uncertainty of $5.2 \\times 10^{-17}$. For the Yb/Sr\nratio, we find R = 1.207 507 039 343 337 749(55), with a fractional uncertainty\nof $4.6 \\times 10^{-17}$.\n", "  We investigate the ground-state of a p-wave Kondo-Heisenberg model introduced\nby Alexandrov and Coleman with an Ising-type anisotropy in the Kondo\ninteraction and correlated conduction electrons. Our aim is to understand how\nthey affect the stability of the Haldane state obtained in the SU(2) symmetric\ncase without the Hubbard interaction. By applying the density-matrix\nrenormalization group algorithm and calculating the entanglement entropy we\nshow that in the anisotropic case a phase transition occurs and a N\\'eel state\nemerges above a critical value of the Coulomb interaction. These findings are\nalso corroborated by the examination of the entanglement spectrum and the spin\nprofile of the system which clarify the structure of each phase.\n", "  We use numerical simulations and an effective-medium theory to study the\nrigidity percolation transition of the honeycomb and diamond lattices when weak\nbond-bending forces are included. We use a rotationally invariant bond-bending\npotential, which, in contrast to the Keating potential, does not involve any\nstretching. As a result, the bulk modulus does not depend on the bending\nstiffness $\\kappa$. We obtain scaling functions for the behavior of some\nelastic moduli in the limits of small $\\Delta \\mathcal{P} = 1 - \\mathcal{P}$,\nand small $\\delta \\mathcal{P} = \\mathcal{P} - \\mathcal{P}_c$, where\n$\\mathcal{P}$ is an occupation probability of each bond, and $\\mathcal{P}_c$ is\nthe critical probability at which rigidity percolation occurs. We find good\nquantitative agreement between effective-medium theory and simulations for both\nlattices for $\\mathcal{P}$ close to one.\n", "  This paper presents a mathematical approach to model the effects of phenomena\nwith random nature such as turbulence and fire-spotting into the existing\nwildfire simulators. The formulation proposes that the propagation of the\nfire-front is the sum of a drifting component (obtained from an existing\nwildfire simulator without turbulence and fire-spotting) and a random\nfluctuating component. The modelling of the random effects is embodied in a\nprobability density function accounting for the fluctuations around the fire\nperimeter which is given by the drifting component. In past, this formulation\nhas been applied to include these random effects into a wildfire simulator\nbased on an Eulerian moving interface method, namely the Level Set Method\n(LSM), but in this paper the same formulation is adapted for a wildfire\nsimulator based on a Lagrangian front tracking technique, namely the Discrete\nEvent System Specification (DEVS). The main highlight of the present study is\nthe comparison of the performance of a Lagrangian and an Eulerian moving\ninterface method when applied to wild-land fire propagation. Simple idealised\nnumerical experiments are used to investigate the potential applicability of\nthe proposed formulation to DEVS and to compare its behaviour with respect to\nthe LSM. The results show that DEVS based wildfire propagation model\nqualitatively improves its performance (e.g., reproducing flank and back fire,\nincrease in fire spread due to pre-heating of the fuel by hot air and\nfirebrands, fire propagation across no fuel zones, secondary fire generation,\n\\dots). Though the results presented here are devoid of any validation exercise\nand provide only a proof of concept, they show a strong inclination towards an\nintended operational use. The existing LSM or DEVS based operational simulators\nlike WRF-SFIRE and ForeFire respectively can serve as an ideal basis for the\nsame.\n", "  The ability to manipulate the relative magnetization alignment between\nferromagnetic source and drain electrodes attached to a molecule or small\nquantum dot is a prerequisite for a number of spintronic device applications.\nThe influence of electrode shape and field orientation on pair-wise\nmagnetization reversal mechanisms in nanogap and point-contact structures is\ninvestigated here using micromagnetic simulations. A favorable device geometry\nand setup are identified for enabling planar, monodomain source and drain\nelectrodes with a magnetization alignment that may be controllably switched\nbetween a parallel and anti-parallel configuration.\n", "  Phosphorene has attracted tremendous interest recently due to its intriguing\nelectronic properties. However, the thermal transport properties of\nphosphorene, especially for its allotropes, are still not well-understood. In\nthis work, we calculate the thermal conductivities of five phosphorene\nallotropes ({\\alpha}-, \\b{eta}-, {\\gamma}-, {\\delta}- and {\\zeta}-phase) by\nusing phonon Boltzmann transport theory combined with first-principles\ncalculations. It is found that the {\\alpha}-phosphorene exhibits considerable\nanisotropic thermal transport, while it is less obvious in the other four\nphosphorene allotropes. The highest thermal conductivity is found in the\n\\b{eta}-phosphorene, followed by {\\delta}-, {\\gamma}- and {\\zeta}-phase. The\nmuch lower thermal conductivity of the {\\zeta}-phase can be attributed to its\nrelatively complex atomic configuration. It is expected that the rich thermal\ntransport properties of phosphorene allotropes can have potential applications\nin the thermoelectrics and thermal management.\n", "  It is shown that in turbulent flows the distributed chaos with spontaneously\nbroken translational space symmetry (homogeneity) has a stretched exponential\nspectrum $\\exp-(k/k_{\\beta})^{\\beta }$ with $\\beta =1/2$. Good agreement has\nbeen established between the theory and the data of direct numerical\nsimulations of isotropic homogeneous turbulence (energy dissipation rate\nfield), of a channel flow (velocity field), of a fully developed boundary layer\nflow (velocity field), and the experimental data at the plasma edges of\ndifferent fusion devices (stellarators and tokamaks). An astrophysical\napplication to the large-scale galaxies distribution has been briefly discussed\nand good agreement with the data of recent Sloan Digital Sky Survey SDSS-III\nhas been established.\n", "  We discuss upper and lower bounds on the electrical conductivity of finite\ntemperature strongly coupled quantum field theories, holographically dual to\nprobe brane models, within linear response. In a probe limit where disorder is\nintroduced entirely through an inhomogeneous background charge density, we find\nsimple lower and upper bounds on the electrical conductivity in arbitrary\ndimensions. In field theories in two spatial dimensions, we show that both\nbounds persist even when disorder is included in the bulk metric. We discuss\nthe challenges with finding sharp lower bounds on conductivity in three or more\nspatial dimensions when the metric is inhomogeneous.\n", "  In this paper we compute the collision strengths and their thermally-averaged\nMaxwellian values for electron transitions between the fifteen lowest levels of\ndoubly-ionised cobalt, Co^{2+}, which give rise to forbidden emission lines in\nthe visible and infrared region of spectrum. The calculations also include\ntransition probabilities and predicted relative line emissivities. The data are\nparticularly useful for analysing the thermodynamic conditions of supernova\nejecta.\n", "  We consider $X(3872)$ and $Y(4140)$ as the vector tetraquark states of\n$X_c^0\\equiv c\\bar c u\\bar u(d\\bar d)$ and $c\\bar c s\\bar s$, respectively. By\nconnecting $\\Lambda_b\\to X_c^0\\Lambda$ to $B^-\\to X_c^0 K^-$, we predict that\nthe branching ratios of $\\Lambda_b\\to \\Lambda(X(3872)^0\\to) J/\\psi \\pi^+\\pi^-$\nand $\\Lambda_b\\to \\Lambda(Y(4140)\\to) J/\\psi \\phi$ are $(5.2\\pm 1.8)\\times\n10^{-6}$ and $(4.7\\pm 2.6)\\times 10^{-6}$, which are accessible to the\nexperiments at the LHCb, respectively. The measurements of these $\\Lambda_b$\nmodes would be the first experimental evidences for the $XYZ$ states in\nbaryonic decays.\n", "  We clarify what it means to have a spacetime fractal geometry in quantum\ngravity and show that its properties differ from those of usual fractals. A\nweak and a strong definition of multi-scale and multi-fractal spacetimes are\ngiven together with a sketch of the landscape of multi-scale theories of\ngravitation. Then, in the context of the fractional theory with\n$q$-derivatives, we explore the consequences of living in a multi-fractal\nspacetime. To illustrate the behavior of a non-relativistic body, we take the\nentertaining example of a sea turtle. We show that, when only the time\ndirection is fractal, sea turtles swim at a faster speed than in an ordinary\nworld, while they swim at a slower speed if only the spatial directions are\nfractal. The latter type of geometry is the one most commonly found in quantum\ngravity. For time-like fractals, relativistic objects can exceed the speed of\nlight, but strongly so only if their size is smaller than the range of\nparticle-physics interactions. We also find new results about log-oscillating\nmeasures, the measure presentation and their role in physical observations and\nin future extensions to nowhere-differentiable stochastic spacetimes.\n", "  We study localized plasmonic excitations in bilayer graphene (BLG) nanodisks,\ncomparing AA-stacked and AB-stacked BLG and contrasting the results to the case\nof two monolayers without electronic hybridization. The electrodynamic response\nof the BLG electron gas is described in terms of a spatially homogeneous\nsurface conductivity, and an efficient alternative two-dimensional\nelectrostatic approach is employed to carry out all the numerical calculations\nof plasmon resonances. Due to a unique electronic band structures, the\nresonance frequency of the traditional dipolar plasmonic mode in the AA-stacked\nBLG nanodisk is roughly doping independent in the low-doping regime, while the\nmode is highly damped as the Fermi level approaches the interlayer hopping\nenergy $\\gamma$ associated with tunneling of electrons between the two layers.\nIn addition to the traditional dipolar mode, we find that the AB-stacked BLG\nnanodisk also hosts a new plasmonic mode with energy larger than $\\gamma$. This\nmode can be tuned by either the doping level or structural size, and\nfurthermore, this mode can dominate the plasmonic response for realistic\nstructural conditions.\n", "  H2S is converted under ultrahigh pressure (> 110 GPa) to a metallic phase\nthat becomes superconducting with a record Tc of 200 K. It has been proposed\nthat the superconducting phase is body-centered cubic H3S ( Im3m , a = 3.089\n{\\AA}) resulting from a decomposition reaction 3H2S --> 2H3S + S. The analogy\nof H2S and H2O leads us to a very different conclusion. The well-known\ndissociation of water into H3O+ and OH- increases by orders of magnitude under\npressure. An equivalent behavior of H2S is anticipated under pressure with the\ndissociation, 2H2S --> H3S+ + SH- forming a perovskite structure (SH-)(H3S+),\nwhich consists of corner-sharing SH6 octahedra with SH- at each A-site (i.e.,\nthe center of each S8 cube). Our DFT calculations show that the perovskite\n(SH-)(H3S+) is thermodynamically more stable than the Im3m structure of H3S,\nand suggest that the A-site H atoms are most likely fluxional even at Tc.\n", "  The Jagiellonian Positron Emission Tomograph (J-PET) was constructed as a\nprototype of the cost-effective scanner for the simultaneous metabolic imaging\nof the whole human body. Being optimized for the detection of photons from the\nelectron-positron annihilation with high time- and high angular-resolution, it\nconstitutes a multi-purpose detector providing new opportunities for studying\nthe decays of positronium atoms. Positronium is the lightest purely leptonic\nobject decaying into photons. As an atom bound by a central potential it is a\nparity eigenstate, and as an atom built out of an electron and an anti-electron\nit is an eigenstate of the charge conjugation operator. Therefore, the\npositronium is a unique laboratory to study discrete symmetries whose precision\nis limited in principle by the effects due to the weak interactions expected at\nthe level of (~10$^{-14}$) and photon-photon interactions expected at the level\nof (~10$^{-9}$). The J-PET detector enables to perform tests of discrete\nsymmetries in the leptonic sector via the determination of the expectation\nvalues of the discrete-symmetries-odd operators, which may be constructed from\nthe spin of ortho-positronium atom and the momenta and polarization vectors of\nphotons originating from its annihilation. In this article we present the\npotential of the J-PET detector to test the C, CP, T and CPT symmetries in the\ndecays of positronium atoms.\n", "  The unfolding problem formulation for correcting experimental data\ndistortions due to finite resolution and limited detector acceptance is\ndiscussed. A novel validation of the problem solution is proposed. Attention is\ndrawn to fact that different unfolded distributions may satisfy the validation\ncriteria, in which case a conservative approach using entropy is suggested. The\nimportance of analysis of residuals is demonstrated.\n", "  Small-scale internetwork magnetic fields are important ingredients of the\nquiet Sun. In this paper we analyze how they appear and disappear on the solar\nsurface. Using high resolution Hinode magnetograms, we follow the evolution of\nindividual magnetic elements in the interior of two supergranular cells at the\ndisk center. From up to 38 hr of continuous measurements, we show that magnetic\nflux appears in internetwork regions at a rate of $120\\pm3$ Mx cm$^{-2}$\nday$^{-1}$ ($3.7 \\pm 0.4 \\times 10^{24}$ Mx day$^{-1}$ over the entire solar\nsurface). Flux disappears from the internetwork at a rate of $125 \\pm 6$ Mx\ncm$^{-2}$ day$^{-1}$ ($3.9\\pm 0.5 \\times 10^{24}$ Mx day$^{-1}$) through fading\nof magnetic elements, cancellation between opposite-polarity features, and\ninteractions with network patches, which converts internetwork elements into\nnetwork features. Most of the flux is lost through fading and interactions with\nthe network, at nearly the same rate of about 50 Mx cm$^{-2}$ day$^{-1}$. Our\nresults demonstrate that the sources and sinks of internetwork magnetic flux\nare well balanced. Using the instantaneous flux appearance and disappearance\nrates, we successfully reproduce the time evolution of the total unsigned flux\nin the two supergranular cells.\n", "  The recent discovery of unexplained X-ray line of $3.5-3.6$ keV emitted from\nthe Perseus cluster of galaxies and M31 and the excess X-ray line of $8.7$ keV\nemitted from the Milky Way center may indicate that dark matter would decay. In\nthis article, I show that approximately 80 \\% of dark matter being 7.1 keV\nsterile neutrinos and 20 \\% of dark matter being 17.4 keV sterile neutrinos can\nsatisfactorily explain the observed X-ray lines and account for all missing\nmass. No free parameter is needed in this model. This scenario is also\ncompatible with current robust observational constraints from the matter power\nspectrum in large-scale structures and would alleviate the challenges faced by\nthe existing dark matter models.\n", "  The plasmoid instability in visco-resistive current sheets is analyzed in\nboth the linear and nonlinear regimes. The linear growth rate and the\nwavenumber are found to scale as $S^{1/4} {\\left( {1 + {P_m}} \\right)}^{-5/8}$\nand $S^{3/8} {\\left( {1 + {P_m}} \\right)}^{-3/16}$ with respect to the\nLundquist number $S$ and the magnetic Prandtl number $P_m$. Furthermore, the\nlinear layer width is shown to scale as $S^{-1/8} {(1+P_m)}^{1/16}$. The growth\nof the plasmoids slows down from an exponential growth to an algebraic growth\nwhen they enter into the nonlinear regime. In particular, the time-scale of the\nnonlinear growth of the plasmoids is found to be $\\tau_{NL} \\sim S^{-3/16} {(1\n+ P_m)^{19/32}}{\\tau_{A,L}}$. The nonlinear growth of the plasmoids is\nradically different from the linear one and it is shown to be essential to\nunderstand the global current sheet disruption. It is also discussed how the\nplasmoid instability enables fast magnetic reconnection in visco-resistive\nplasmas. In particular, it is shown that the recursive plasmoid formation can\ntrigger a collisionless reconnection regime if $S \\gtrsim L_{cs} {(\\epsilon_c\nl_k)^{-1}} {(1 + {P_m})^{1/2}}$, where $L_{cs}$ is the half-length of the\nglobal current sheet and $l_k$ is the relevant kinetic length scale. On the\nother hand, if the current sheet remains in the collisional regime, the global\n(time-averaged) reconnection rate is shown to be $\\left\\langle {{{\\left. {d\\psi\n/dt} \\right|}_X}} \\right\\rangle \\approx \\epsilon_c v_{A,u} B_{u} {(1 +\n{P_m})^{-1/2}}$, where $\\epsilon_c$ is the critical inverse aspect ratio of the\ncurrent sheet, while $v_{A,u}$ and $B_{u}$ are the Alfv\\'en speed and the\nmagnetic field upstream of the global reconnection layer.\n", "  We simulated the modulation of the interstellar neutral (ISN) He, Ne, and O\ndensity and pick-up ion (PUI) production rate and count rate along the Earth's\norbit over the solar cycle from 2002 to 2013 to verify if solar cycle-related\neffects may modify the inferred ecliptic longitude of the ISN inflow direction.\nWe adopted the classical PUI model with isotropic distribution function and\nadiabatic cooling, modified by time- and heliolatitude-dependent ionization\nrates and non-zero injection speed of PUIs. We found that the ionization losses\nhave a noticeable effect on the derivation of the ISN inflow longitude based on\nthe Gaussian fit to the crescent and cone peak locations. We conclude that the\nnon-zero radial velocity of the ISN flow and the energy range of the PUI\ndistribution function that is accumulated are of importance for a precise\nreproduction of the PUI count rate along the Earth orbit. However, the temporal\nand latitudinal variations of the ionization in the heliosphere, and\nparticularly their variation on the solar cycle time-scale, may significantly\nmodify the shape of PUI cone and crescent and also their peak positions from\nyear to year and thus bias by a few degrees the derived longitude of the ISN\ngas inflow direction.\n", "  Despite of its huge successes in vast amount of applications, the Kohn-Sham\nscheme of density functional theory (DFT-Kohn-Sham) has not been able to get\nreliable ionization potentials (IP) for semiconductors, due to self-interaction\nerror in the local density approximation (LDA) and generalized gradient\napproximations (GGA), and the difficulty of using asymptotically long-ranged\npotentials for surface calculations. An approximate optimize effective\npotential (OEP), the Becke-Johnson'06 exchange, is used to explore the\ncapability of OEP to calculate semiconductor IP with a surface technique\nsuitable for both short- and long-ranged potentials. Combined with the LDA\ncorrelation, the approximate OEP has achieved an IP accuracy for 17\nsemiconductors which is similar to the much more sophisticated $GW$\napproximation (GWA), with the computational cost of only LDA/GGA. For the first\ntime, this opens the way for systematic calculation of semiconductor IP's by\nthe DFT-Kohn-Sham scheme. The long-range part of the $v_{xc}$ is not as\nimportant for solid surface as for atoms and molecules since the wave functions\nare mainly bound to the slab while less exposed to the asymptotic region.\nNevertheless, it contributes significantly to the total IP and therefore shall\nnot be simply ignored. Without including its effects, it is unlikely that the\nsame GWA procedure could achieve universally accurate band gaps and accurate\nIP's at the same time, as is indeed seen in practical calculations.\n", "  Studies of dynamical stability (chaotic versus regular motion) in galactic\ndynamics often rely on static analytical models of the total gravitational\npotential. Potentials based upon self-consistent N-body simulations offer more\nrealistic models, fully incorporating the time-dependent nature of the systems.\nHere we aim at analysing the fractions of chaotic motion within different\nmorphological components of the galaxy. We wish to investigate how the presence\nof chaotic orbits evolves with time, and how their spatial distribution is\nassociated with morphological features of the galaxy. We employ a\ntime-dependent analytical potential model that was derived from an N-body\nsimulation of a strongly barred galaxy. With this analytical potential we may\nfollow the dynamical evolution of ensembles of orbits. Using the Generalized\nAlignment Index (GALI) chaos detection method, we study the fraction of chaotic\norbits, sampling the dynamics of both the stellar disc and of the dark matter\nhalo. Within the stellar disc, the global trend is for chaotic motion to\ndecrease in time, specially in the region of the bar. We scrutinized the\ndifferent changes of regime during the evolution (orbits that are permanently\nchaotic, permanently regular, those that begin regular and end chaotic, and\nthose that begin chaotic and end regular), tracing the types of orbits back to\ntheir common origins. Within the dark matter halo, chaotic motion also\ndecreases globally in time. The inner halo (r < 5 kpc) is where most chaotic\norbits are found and it is the only region where chaotic orbits outnumber\nregular orbits, in the early evolution.\n", "  beta-Bi2Pd compound has been proposed as another example of a multi-gap\nsuperconductor [Y. Imai et al., J. Phys. Soc. Jap. 81, 113708 (2012)]. Here, we\nreport on measurements of several important physical quantities capable to show\na presence of multiple energy gaps on our superconducting single crystals of\nbeta-Bi2Pd with the critical temperature Tc close to 5 K. The calorimetric\nstudy via a sensitive ac technique shows a sharp anomaly at the superconducting\ntransition, however only a single energy gap is detected. Also other\ncharacteristics inferred from calorimetric measurements as the field dependence\nof the Sommerfeld coefficient and the temperature and angular dependence of the\nupper critical magnetic field point unequivocally to standard single s-wave gap\nsuperconductivity. The Hall-probe magnetometry provides the same result from\nthe analysis of the temperature dependence of the lower critical field. A\nsingle-gapped BCS density of states is detected by the scanning tunneling\nspectroscopy measurements. Then, the bulk as well as the surface sensitive\nprobes evidence a standard conventional superconductivity in this system where\nthe topologically protected surface states have been recently detected by ARPES\n[M. Sakano et al., Nature Comm. 6, 8595 (2015)] .\n", "  Sound waves in and dielectric liquid, that consists of subsystems of valency\nelectrons with effective mass and ions which interact through the long-wave\npotential electric field are considered, on analogies with and metallic liquid,\nbut with the requirement, that electric current is absent. It is shown that\nusual description of sound wave in an ideal liquid as wave of mass density and\nmass velocity follows from the offered consideration. It is also shown that\nsound waves with other side can be considered as waves of potential electric\nfield in an environment. Introduction of phonons in both cases is considered.\n", "  On the basis of the Usadel equation we study a multi-terminal Josephson\njunction. This junction is composed by \"magnetic\" superconductors\nS$_{\\text{m}}$ which have singlet pairing and are separated from the normal\nn~wire by spin filters so that the Josephson coupling is caused only by fully\npolarized triplet components. We show that there is no interaction between\ntriplet Cooper pairs with antiparallel total spin orientations. The presence of\nan additional singlet superconductor S attached to the n wire leads to a finite\nJosephson current $I_{\\text{Q}}$ with an unusual current--phase relation. The\ndensity of states in the n wire for different orientations of spins of Cooper\npairs is calculated. We derive a general formula for the current $I_{\\text{Q}}$\nin a multi-terminal Josephson contact and apply this formula for analysis of\ntwo four-terminal Josephson junctions of different structures. It is shown in\nparticular that both the \"nematic\" and the \"magnetic\" cases can be realized in\nthese junctions. In a two-terminal structure with parallel filter orientations\nand in a three-terminal structure with antiparallel filter orientations of the\n\"magnetic\" superconductors with attached additional singlet superconductor, we\nfind a nonmonotonic temperature dependence of the critical current. Also, in\nthese structures, the critical current shows a Riedel peak like dependence on\nthe exchange field in the \"magnetic\" superconductors. Although there is no\ncurrent through the S/n interface due to orthogonality of the singlet and\ntriplet components, the phase of the order parameter in the superconuctor S is\nshown to affect the Josephson current in a multi-terminal structure.\n", "  We study the dynamics of a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) segment, as a\nsemiflexible polymer, in a shear flow, the strength of which is customarily\nexpressed in terms of the dimensionless Weissenberg number Wi. Polymer chains\nin shear flows are well-known to undergo tumbling motion. When the chain\nlengths are much smaller than the persistence length, one expects a\n(semiflexible) chain to tumble as a rigid rod. At low Wi, a polymer segment\nshorter than the persistence length does indeed tumble as a rigid rod. However,\nfor higher Wi the chain does not tumble as a rigid rod, even if the polymer\nsegment is shorter than the persistence length. In particular, from time to\ntime the polymer segment may assume a buckled form, a phenomenon commonly known\nas Euler buckling. Using a bead-spring Hamiltonian model for extensible dsDNA\nfragments, we first analyze Euler buckling in terms of the oriented\ndeterministic state (ODS), which is obtained as the steady-state solution of\nthe dynamical equations by turning off the stochastic (thermal) forces at a\nfixed orientation of the chain. The ODS exhibits symmetry breaking at a\ncritical Weissenberg number Wi$_{\\text c}$, analogous to a pitchfork\nbifurcation in dynamical systems. We then follow up the analysis with\nsimulations and demonstrate symmetry breaking in computer experiments,\ncharacterized by a unimodal to bimodal transformation of the probability\ndistribution of the second Rouse mode with increasing Wi. Our simulations\nreveal that shear can cause strong deformation for a chain that is shorter than\nits persistence length, similar to recent experimental observations.\n", "  Traditionally, the formation of vocabularies has been studied by agent-based\nmodels (specially, the Naming Game) in which random pairs of agents negotiate\nword-meaning associations at each discrete time step. This paper proposes a\nfirst approximation to a novel question: To what extent the negotiation of\nword-meaning associations is influenced by the order in which the individuals\ninteract? Automata Networks provide the adequate mathematical framework to\nexplore this question. Computer simulations suggest that on two-dimensional\nlattices the typical features of the formation of word-meaning associations are\nrecovered under random schemes that update small fractions of the population at\nthe same time.\n", "  This work develops a computational model (by Automata Networks) of\nphonological similarity effects involved in the formation of word-meaning\nassociations on artificial populations of speakers. Classical studies show that\nin recalling experiments memory performance was impaired for phonologically\nsimilar words versus dissimilar ones. Here, the individuals confound\nphonologically similar words according to a predefined parameter. The main\nhypothesis is that there is a critical range of the parameter, and with this,\nof working-memory mechanisms, which implies drastic changes in the final\nconsensus of the entire population. Theoretical results present proofs of\nconvergence for a particular case of the model within a worst-case complexity\nframework. Computer simulations describe the evolution of an energy function\nthat measures the amount of local agreement between individuals. The main\nfinding is the appearance of sudden changes in the energy function at critical\nparameters.\n", "  Variable emission is one of the defining characteristic of active galactic\nnuclei (AGN). While providing precious information on the nature and physics of\nthe sources, variability is often challenging to observe with time- and\nfield-of-view-limited astronomical observatories such as Imaging Atmospheric\nCherenkov Telescopes (IACTs). In this work, we address two questions relevant\nfor the observation of sources characterized by AGN-like variability: what is\nthe most time-efficient way to detect such sources, and what is the\nobservational bias that can be introduced by the choice of the observing\nstrategy when conducting blind surveys of the sky. Different observing\nstrategies are evaluated using simulated light curves and realistic instrument\nresponse functions of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), a future gamma-ray\nobservatory. We show that strategies that makes use of very small observing\nwindows, spread over large periods of time, allows for a faster detection of\nthe source, and are less influenced by the variability properties of the\nsources, as compared to strategies that concentrate the observing time in a\nsmall number of large observing windows. Although derived using CTA as an\nexample, our conclusions are conceptually valid for any IACTs facility, and in\ngeneral, to all observatories with small field of view and limited duty cycle.\n", "  We show that the vacuum (zero-point) energy of a low-temperature quantum\nliquid is a variable property which changes with the state of the system, in\nnotable contrast to the static vacuum energy in solids commonly considered. We\nfurther show that this energy is inherently anomalous: it decreases with\ntemperature and gives negative contribution to system's heat capacity. This\neffect operates in an equilibrium and macroscopic system, in marked contrast to\nsmall or out-of-equilibrium configurations discussed previously. We find that\nthe negative contribution is over-compensated by the positive term from the\nexcitation of longitudinal fluctuations and demonstrate how the overall\npositive heat capacity is related to the stability of a condensed phase at the\nmicroscopic level.\n", "  We investigate the effects of systematic errors of the control parameters on\nsingle-qubit gates based on non-adiabatic non-Abelian geometric holonomies and\nthose relying on purely dynamical evolution. It is explicitly shown that the\nsystematic error in the Rabi frequency of the control fields affects these two\nkinds of gates in different ways. In the presence of this systematic error, the\ntransformation produced by the non-adiabatic non-Abelian geometric gate is not\nunitary in the computational space, and the resulting gate infidelity is larger\nthan that with the dynamical method. Our results provide a theoretical basis\nfor choosing a suitable method for implementing elementary quantum gates in\nphysical systems, where the systematic noises are the dominant noise source.\n", "  The transit method is presently the most successful planet discovery and\ncharacterization tool at our disposal. Other advanced civilizations would\nsurely be aware of this technique and appreciate that their home planet's\nexistence and habitability is essentially broadcast to all stars lying along\ntheir ecliptic plane. We suggest that advanced civilizations could cloak their\npresence, or deliberately broadcast it, through controlled laser emission. Such\nemission could distort the apparent shape of their transit light curves with\nrelatively little energy, due to the collimated beam and relatively infrequent\nnature of transits. We estimate that humanity could cloak the Earth from\nKepler-like broadband surveys using an optical monochromatic laser array\nemitting a peak power of about 30 MW for roughly 10 hours per year. A chromatic\ncloak, effective at all wavelengths, is more challenging requiring a large\narray of tunable lasers with a total power of approximately 250 MW.\nAlternatively, a civilization could cloak only the atmospheric signatures\nassociated with biological activity on their world, such as oxygen, which is\nachievable with a peak laser power of just around 160 kW per transit. Finally,\nwe suggest that the time of transit for optical SETI is analogous to the\nwater-hole in radio SETI, providing a clear window in which observers may\nexpect to communicate. Accordingly, we propose that a civilization may\ndeliberately broadcast their technological capabilities by distorting their\ntransit to an artificial shape, which serves as both a SETI beacon and a medium\nfor data transmission. Such signatures could be readily searched in the\narchival data of transit surveys.\n", "  An extensive study of single block copolymer knots containing two kinds of\nmonomers $A$ and $B$ is presented. The knots are in a solution and their\nmonomers are subjected to short range interactions that can be attractive or\nrepulsive. In view of possible applications in medicine and the construction of\nintelligent materials, it is shown that several features of copolymer knots can\nbe tuned by changing the monomer configuration. A very fast and abrupt swelling\nwith increasing temperature is obtained in certain multiblock copolymers, while\nthe size and the swelling behavior at high temperatures may be controlled in\ndiblock copolymers. Interesting new effects appear in the thermal diagrams of\ncopolymer knots when their length is increased.\n", "  The problem of detecting communities in a graph is maybe one the most studied\ninference problems, given its simplicity and widespread diffusion among several\ndisciplines. A very common benchmark for this problem is the stochastic block\nmodel or planted partition problem, where a phase transition takes place in the\ndetection of the planted partition by changing the signal-to-noise ratio.\nOptimal algorithms for the detection exist which are based on spectral methods,\nbut we show these are extremely sensible to slight modification in the\ngenerative model. Recently Javanmard, Montanari and Ricci-Tersenghi\n(arXiv:1511.08769) have used statistical physics arguments, and numerical\nsimulations to show that finding communities in the stochastic block model via\nsemidefinite programming is quasi optimal. Further, the resulting semidefinite\nrelaxation can be solved efficiently, and is very robust with respect to\nchanges in the generative model. In this paper we study in detail several\npractical aspects of this new algorithm based on semidefinite programming for\nthe detection of the planted partition. The algorithm turns out to be very\nfast, allowing the solution of problems with $O(10^5)$ variables in few second\non a laptop computer.\n", "  An array of ultracold polar molecules trapped in an external electric field\nis regarded as a promising carrier of quantum information. Under the action of\nthis field, molecules are compelled to undergo pendular oscillations by the\nStark effect. Particular attention has been paid to the influence of intrinsic\ndecoherence on the model of linear polar molecular pendular states, thereby we\nevaluate the tripartite entanglement with negativity, as well as fidelity of\nbipartite quantum systems for input and output signals using electric dipole\nmoments of polar molecules as qubits. According to this study, we consider\nthree typical initial states for both systems respectively, and investigate the\ntemporal evolution with variable values of the external field intensity, the\nintrinsic decoherence factor and the dipole-dipole interaction. Thus we\ndemonstrate the sound selection of these three main parameters to obtain the\nbest entanglement degree and fidelity.\n", "  Accretion discs in AGN may be associated with coronal gas, as suggested by\ntheir X-ray emission. Stellar coronal emission includes radio emission, and AGN\ncorona may also be a significant source for radio emission in radio quiet (RQ)\nAGN. We calculate the coronal properties required to produce the observed radio\nemission in RQ AGN, either from synchrotron emission of power-law (PL)\nelectrons, or from cyclo-synchrotron emission of hot mildly-relativistic\nthermal electrons. We find that a flat spectrum, as observed in about half of\nRQ AGN, can be produced by corona with a disc or a spherical configuration,\nwhich extends from the innermost regions out to a pc scale. A spectral break to\nan optically thin power-law emission is expected around 300-1000 GHz, as the\ninnermost corona becomes optically thin. In case of thermal electrons, a sharp\nspectral cutoff is expected above the break. The position of the break can be\nmeasured with VLBI observations, which exclude the cold dust emission, and it\ncan be used to probe the properties of the innermost corona. Assuming\nequipartition of the coronal thermal energy density, the PL electrons energy\ndensity, and the magnetic field, we find that the energy density in a disc\ncorona should scale as $\\sim R^{-1.3}$, to get a flat spectrum. In the\nspherical case the energy density scales as $\\sim R^{-2}$, and is $\\sim 4\\times\n10^{-4}$ of the AGN radiation energy density. In paper II we derive additional\nconstraints on the coronal parameters from the Gudel-Benz relation, $L_{\\rm\nRadio}/L_{\\rm X-ray}\\sim 10^{-5}$, which RQ AGN follow.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the development of unconventional\nsuperconductivity in the Sb(111) thin film when its Fermi level is tuned to\nnear type-II Van Hove singularities (VHS), which locate at non-time-reversal\ninvariant momenta. Via patch renormalization group analysis, we show that the\nleading instability is a chiral p + ip-wave superconducting order. The origin\nof such pairing relies on the hexagonal structure of the VHS and strong\nspin-orbit coupling, resulting in the anisotropy of the electron-electron\nscattering to provide an attractive channel. Our study hence suggests that\nsuperconducting Sb thin films originated from VHS physics may host Majorana\nzero modes in the magnetic vortices and provides another application\nperspective to such material.\n", "  A problem closely related to epidemiology, where a subgraph of 'infected'\nlinks is defined inside a larger network, is investigated. This subgraph is\ngenerated from the underlying network by a random variable, which decides\nwhether a link is able to propagate a disease/information. The relaxation\ntimescale of this random variable is examined in both annealed and quenched\nlimits, and the effectiveness of propagation of disease/information is\nanalyzed. The dynamics of the model is governed by a master equation and two\ntypes of underlying network are considered: one is scale-free and the other has\nexponential degree distribution. We have shown that the relaxation timescale of\nthe contagion variable has a major influence on the topology of the subgraph of\ninfected links, which determines the efficiency of spreading of\ndisease/information over the network.\n", "  Redshift is a key quantity for inferring cosmological model parameters. In\nphotometric redshift estimation, cosmologists use the coarse data collected\nfrom the vast majority of galaxies to predict the redshift of individual\ngalaxies. To properly quantify the uncertainty in the predictions, however, one\nneeds to go beyond standard regression and instead estimate the full\nconditional density f(z|x) of a galaxy's redshift z given its photometric\ncovariates x. The problem is further complicated by selection bias: usually\nonly the rarest and brightest galaxies have known redshifts, and these galaxies\nhave characteristics and measured covariates that do not necessarily match\nthose of more numerous and dimmer galaxies of unknown redshift. Unfortunately,\nthere is not much research on how to best estimate complex multivariate\ndensities in such settings. Here we describe a general framework for properly\nconstructing and assessing nonparametric conditional density estimators under\nselection bias, and for combining two or more estimators for optimal\nperformance. We propose new improved photo-z estimators and illus- trate our\nmethods on data from the Sloan Data Sky Survey and an application to\ngalaxy-galaxy lensing. Although our main application is photo-z estimation, our\nmethods are relevant to any high-dimensional regression setting with\ncomplicated asymmetric and multimodal distributions in the response variable.\n", "  We investigate numerically conditions for order and chaos in the dynamics of\nan interacting Bose- Einstein condensate (BEC) confined by an external trap cut\noff by a hard-wall box potential. The BEC is stirred by a laser to induce\nexcitations manifesting as irregular spatial and energy oscillations of the\ntrapped cloud. Adding laser stirring to the external trap results in an\neffective time-varying trapping frequency in connection with the dynamically\nchanging combined external+laser potential trap. The resulting dynamics are\nanalyzed by plotting their trajectories in coordinate phase space and in energy\nspace. The Lyapunov exponents are computed to confirm the existence of chaos in\nthe latter space. Quantum effects and trap anharmonicity are demonstrated to\ngenerate chaos in energy space, thus confirming its presence and implicating\neither quantum effects or trap anharmonicity as its generator. The presence of\nchaos in energy space does not necessarily translate into chaos in coordinate\nspace. In general, a dynamic trapping frequency is found to promote chaos in a\ntrapped BEC. An apparent means to suppress chaos in a trapped BEC is achieved\nby increasing the characteristic scale of the external trap with respect to the\ncondensate size.\n", "  Current models of magnetars require extremely strong magnetic fields to\nexplain their observed quiescent and bursting emission, implying that the field\nstrength within the star's outer crust is orders of magnitude larger than the\ndipole component inferred from spin-down measurements. This presents a serious\nchallenge to theories of magnetic field generation in a proto-neutron star.\nHere, we present detailed modelling of the evolution of the magnetic field in\nthe crust of a neutron star through 3-D simulations. We find that, in the\nplausible scenario of equipartition of energy between global-scale poloidal and\ntoroidal magnetic components, magnetic instabilities transfer energy to\nnon-axisymmetric, kilometre-sized magnetic features, in which the local field\nstrength can greatly exceed that of the global-scale field. These intense\nsmall-scale magnetic features can induce high energy bursts through local crust\nyielding, and the localised enhancement of Ohmic heating can power the star's\npersistent emission. Thus, the observed diversity in magnetar behaviour can be\nexplained with mixed poloidal-toroidal fields of comparable energies.\n", "  Radial velocities (RV) measured from near-infrared (NIR) spectra are a\npotentially excellent tool to search for extrasolar planets around cool or\nactive stars. High resolution infrared (IR) spectrographs now available are\nreaching the high precision of visible instruments, with a constant improvement\nover time. GIANO is an infrared echelle spectrograph at the Telescopio\nNazionale Galileo (TNG) and it is a powerful tool to provide high resolution\nspectra for accurate RV measurements of exoplanets and for chemical and\ndynamical studies of stellar or extragalactic objects. No other high spectral\nresolution IR instrument has GIANO's capability to cover the entire NIR\nwavelength range (0.95-2.45 micron) in a single exposure. In this paper we\ndescribe the ensemble of procedures that we have developed to measure high\nprecision RVs on GIANO spectra acquired during the Science Verification (SV)\nrun, using the telluric lines as wavelength reference. We used the Cross\nCorrelation Function (CCF) method to determine the velocity for both the star\nand the telluric lines. For this purpose, we constructed two suitable digital\nmasks that include about 2000 stellar lines, and a similar number of telluric\nlines. The method is applied to various targets with different spectral type,\nfrom K2V to M8 stars. We reached different precisions mainly depending on the H\n-magnitudes: for H ~ 5 we obtain an rms scatter of ~ 10 m s-1, while for H ~ 9\nthe standard deviation increases to ~ 50 - 80 m s-1. The corresponding\ntheoretical error expectations are ~4 m s-1 and 30 m s-1, respectively. Finally\nwe provide the RVs measured with our procedure for the targets observed during\nGIANO Science Verification.\n", "  A metallic hollow waveguide is promising fiber for the delivery of laser\nradiation. Thickness of the nickel plated layer for supporting of the waveguide\nin fabrication of a dielectric coated silver hollow nickel waveguide is very\nimportant factor. In this paper, the change characteristic in the thickness of\nthe nickel plated layer along the length of the silver coated glass mandrel\nduring fabricating the silver hollow nickel waveguide by the outer-coating\nmethod of the liquid phase process has been studied both experimentally and\nanalytically. Waveguides with uniform thickness of the nickel plated layer\nalong the length of the silver coated glass mandrel have been fabricated.\n", "  A new tool providing material contrast control in scanning electron\nmicroscopy (SEM) is demonstrated. The approach is based on deep-UV illumination\nduring SEM imaging and delivers a novel material based contrast as well as\nhigher resolution due to the photoelectric effect. Electrons liberated from\nilluminated sample surface contribute to the imaging which can be carried out\nat a faster acquisition rate, provide material selective contrast, reduce\ndistortions caused by surface charging, and can substitute metal coating in\nSEM. These features provide high fidelity SEM imaging and are expected to\nsignificantly improve the performance of electron beam instruments as well as\nto open new opportunities for imaging and characterization of materials at the\nnanoscale.\n", "  In this paper, we present a basic model for time-interleaved photonic\nanalog-to-digital converter (TIPADC) and analyze its linear, nonlinear, and\nnoise performance. The basic operation mechanism of TIPADC is illustrated and\nthe linear performance is analyzed in frequency domain. The mathematical\nexpressions and the output of the system are presented in each processing step.\nWe reveal that photonic sampling folds the whole spectrum of input signal in a\nnarrow band, which enables the analog bandwidth of a TIPADC to be much higher\nthan the bandwidth of back-end electronics. The feasible regions of the system\nis obtained in terms of system frequency response, and a set of sampling\ncriteria determining the basic requirements to the system are summarized for\ntypical applications. The results show that the global minimum feasible\nbandwidth of back-end electronics is the half of single channel sampling rate\nwhen the bandwidth of photonic sampling pulse is comparable to input signal\nfrequency. The amplitude and phase noise of photonic sampling pulse train, the\nthermal noise and shot noise of photodetection, and the quantization noise and\naperture jitter noise of EADCs are investigated. The nonlinearity of TIPADC is\nalso analyzed. The effect of different factors, such as the single channel\nsampling rate, the average optical power and the bandwidth of back-end\nelectronics, on the effective number of bits of TIPADC is qualitatively and\nquantitatively discussed. The results explicitly show that TIPADC can perform\nhigh fidelity conversion to ultra-high speed analog signal and overcome the\nmajor performance limitations existing in traditional ADCs such as aperture\njitter and bandwidth. The criteria deduced will be an effective supplement to\nthe generalized sampling theorem in designing TIPADC.\n", "  Quasi-brittle behavior where macroscopic failure is preceded by stable\ndamaging and intensive cracking activity is a desired feature of materials\nbecause it makes fracture predictable. Based on a fiber bundle model with\nglobal load sharing we show that blending strength and stiffness disorder of\nmaterial elements leads to the stabilization of fracture, i.e. samples which\nare brittle when one source of disorder is present, become quasi-brittle as a\nconsequence of blending. We derive a condition of quasi-brittle behavior in\nterms of the joint distribution of the two sources of disorder. Breaking bursts\nhave a power law size distribution of exponent 5/2 without any crossover to a\nlower exponent when the amount of disorder is gradually decreased. The results\nhave practical relevance for the design of materials to increase the safety of\nconstructions.\n", "  We present initial results of an ongoing study of the supernova remnants\n(SNRs) and candidates in the Magellanic Clouds. Some 108 objects in both Clouds\nare considered to be either an SNR or a reliable candidate. This represents the\nmost complete sample of known SNRs in any galaxy. therefore, this study allows\nus to study SNR population properties such as the size and spectral index\ndistribution. Here, we also show 12 known Large Magellanic Cloud SNRs from type\nIa SN explosions and briefly comment on their importance.\n", "  I report the result of a which-way experiment based on Young's double-slit\nexperiment. It reveals which slit photons go through while retaining the (self)\ninterference of all the photons collected. The idea is to image the slits using\na lens with a narrow aperture and scan across the area where the interference\nfringes would be. The aperture is wide enough to separate the slits in the\nimages, i.e., telling which way. The illumination pattern over the pupil is\nreconstructed from the series of slit intensities. The result matches the\ndouble-slit interference pattern well. As such, the photon's wave-like and\nparticle-like behaviors are observed simultaneously in a straightforward and\nthus unambiguous way. The implication is far reaching. For one, it presses\nhard, at least philosophically, for a consolidated wave-and-particle\ndescription of quantum objects, because we can no longer dismiss such a\nchallenge on the basis that the two behaviors do not manifest at the same time.\nA bold proposal is to forgo the concept of particles. Then, Heisenberg's\nuncertainty principle would be purely a consequence of waves without being\nordained upon particles.\n", "  Mixing between two different miscible fluids with a mutual interface must be\ninitiated by fluid transporting across this fluid interface, caused for example\nby applying an unsteady velocity agitation. In general, there is no necessity\nfor this physical flow barrier between the fluids to be associated with\nextremal or exponential attraction as might be revealed by applying Lagrangian\ncoherent structures, finite-time Lyapunov exponents or other methods on the\nfluid velocity. It is shown that streaklines are key to understanding the\nbreaking of the interface under velocity agitations, and a theory for locating\nthe relevant streaklines is presented. Simulations of streaklines in a\ncross-channel mixer and a perturbed Kirchhoff's elliptic vortex are\nquantitatively compared to the theoretical results. A methodology for\nquantifying the unsteady advective transport between the two fluids using\nstreaklines is presented.\n", "  The observed cross sections of quasi-elastic scattering of 6He, 7Be, and 8B\nnuclei by 12C nuclei are described within the framework of the diffraction\nnuclear model and the model of nucleus-nucleus scattering in the high-energy\napproximation with a double folding potential, for intermediate energies of the\nincident particles. The calculations make use of realistic distributions of\nnucleon densities and take account of the Coulomb interaction and inelastic\nscattering with excitation of low-lying collective states of the target.\n", "  The sub-THz event observed on the 4 July 2012 with the Bauman Moscow State\nTechnical University Radio Telescope RT-7.5 at 93 and 140~GHz as well as\nKislovodsk and Mets\\\"ahovi radio telescopes, Radio Solar Telescope Network\n(RSTN), GOES, RHESSI, and SDO orbital stations is analyzed. The spectral flux\nbetween 93 and 140 GHz has been observed increasing with frequency. On the\nbasis of the SDO/AIA data the differential emission measure has been\ncalculated. It is shown that the thermal coronal plasma with the temperature\nabove 0.5~MK cannot be responsible for the observed sub-THz flare emission. The\nnon-thermal gyrosynchrotron mechanism can be responsible for the microwave\nemission near $10$~GHz but the observed millimeter spectral characteristics are\nlikely to be produced by the thermal bremsstrahlung emission from plasma with a\ntemperature of about 0.1~MK.\n", "  We perform a mean-field analysis of the EULAG-MHD millenium simulation of\nglobal magnetohydrodynamical convection presented in Passos et al. 2014. The\nturbulent electromotive force operating in the simulation is assumed to be\nlinearly related to the cyclic axisymmetric mean magnetic field and its first\nspatial derivatives. At every grid point in the simulation's meridional plane,\nthis assumed relationship involves 27 independent tensorial coefficients.\nExpanding on Racine et al. 2011, we extract these coefficients from the\nsimulation data through a least-squares minimization procedure based on\nsingular value decomposition. The reconstructed alpha-tensor shows good\nagreement with that obtained by Racine et al. 2011, who did not include\nderivatives of the mean-field in their fit, as well as with the alpha-tensor\nextracted by Augustson et al. 2015 from a distinct ASH MHD simulation. The\nisotropic part of the turbulent magnetic diffusivity tensor beta is positive\ndefinite and reaches values of 5.0x10^7 m2s-1 in the middle of the convecting\nfluid layers. The spatial variations of both alpha_phiphi and beta_phiphi\ncomponent are well reproduced by expressions obtained under the SOCA, with a\ngood matching of amplitude requiring a turbulent correlation time about five\ntimes smaller than the estimated turnover time of the small-scale turbulent\nflow. We find the magnetic quenching of the alpha-effect to be driven primarily\nby a reduction of the small-scale flow's kinetic helicity, with variations of\nthe current helicity playing a lesser role in most locations in the simulation\ndomain. Our measurements of turbulent diffusivity quenching are restricted to\nthe beta_phiphi component, but indicate a weaker quenching, by a factor of\n1.36, than of the alpha effect, which in our simulation drops by a factor of\nthree between the minimum and maximum phases of the magnetic cycle.\n", "  Phenomena of electromagnetically induced transparency (PEIT) may be\ninterpreted by the Autler-Townes Splitting (ATS), where the coupled states are\nsplit by the coupling laser field, or by the quantum destructive interference\n(QDI), where the atomic phases caused by the coupling laser and the probe laser\nfield cancel. We propose modulated experiments to explore the PEIT in an\nalternative way by periodically modulating the coupling and the probe fields in\na ?-type three-level system. Our analytical and numerical results rule out the\nATS interpretation and show that the QDI interpretation is more appropriate for\nthe modulated experiments. The proposed experiments are readily implemented in\natomic gases, artificial atoms in superconducting quantum devices, or\nthree-level meta-atoms in meta-materials.\n", "  Graphene is prepared with a variety of methods, such as thermal decomposition\nof SiC, Chemical Vapor Deposition and pulsed laser deposition. We propose\nanother method to prepare graphitic carbon by irradiating lead pencil drawn\npaper using femtosecond laser [Jpn. J. Appl. Phys. 55 (2016) 01AE24]. In order\nto evaluate electronic properties, such as resistivity and mobility, surface\nroughness of paper is important to evaluate thickness of lead pencil as one of\nprincipal factors. The surface roughness of variety of paper was investigated\nincluding cross section of drawing paper. Femotosecond laser irradiated the\nsample surface with its focus shifted from the optical focal point to enlarge\nthe laser spot and tender irradiation.\n", "  We treat hydrodynamic limits of the Vlasov-Maxwell-Boltzmann system for one\nand two species of particles in a viscous incompressible regime.\n", "  Gravitational potentials of the domain walls in the linearized gravity are\ngrowing with distance, so the particle scattering by the wall can not be\ndescribed in terms of free asymptotic states. In the non-relativistic case this\nproblem is solved using the concept of the potential energy. We show that in\nthe relativistic case one is able to introduce gravitationally dressed momenta\nthe sum of which is conserved up to the momentum flux through the lateral\nsurface of the world tube describing losses due to excitation of the branon\nwaves.\n", "  We consider localised bulging/necking in an inflated hyperelastic membrane\ntube with closed ends. We first show that the initiation pressure for the onset\nof localised bulging is simply the limiting pressure in uniform inflation when\nthe axial force is held fixed. We then demonstrate analytically how, as\ninflation continues, the initial bulge grows continually in diameter until it\nreaches a critical size and then propagates in both directions. The bulging\nsolution before propagation starts is of the solitary-wave type, whereas the\npropagating bulging solution is of the kink-wave type. The stability, with\nrespect to axially symmetric perturbations, of both the solitary-wave type and\nthe kink-wave type solutions is studied by computing the Evans function using\nthe compound matrix method. It is found that when the inflation is\npressure-controlled, the Evans function has a single non-negative real root and\nthis root tends to zero only when the initiation pressure or the propagation\npressure is approached. Thus, the kink-wave type solution is probably stable\nbut the solitary-wave type solution is definitely unstable.\n", "  We study a binary system composed of point particles of unequal masses in\neccentric orbits in the linear regime of the characteristic formulation of\ngeneral relativity, generalising a previous study found in the literature in\nwhich a system of equal masses in circular orbits is considered. We also show\nthat the boundary conditions on the time-like world tubes generated by the\norbits of the particles can be extended beyond circular orbits. Concerning the\npower lost by the emission of gravitational waves, it is directly obtained from\nthe Bondi's News function. It is worth stressing that our results are\ncompletely consistent, because we obtain the same result for the power derived\nby Peters and Mathews, in a different approach, in their seminal paper of 1963.\nIn addition, the present study constitutes a powerful tool to construct\nextraction schemes in the characteristic formalism to obtain the gravitational\nradiation produced by binary systems during the inspiralling phase.\n", "  In Cone-Beam CT (CBCT) imaging systems, the scattering phenomenon has a\nsignificant impact on the reconstructed image and is a long-lasting research\ntopic on CBCT. In this paper, we propose a simple, novel and fast approach for\nmitigating scatter artifacts and increasing the image contrast in CBCT,\nbelonging to the category of convolution-based method in which the projected\ndata is de-convolved with a convolution kernel. A key step in this method is\nhow to determine the convolution kernel. Compared with existing methods, the\nestimation of convolution kernel is based on bi-l1-l2-norm regularization\nimposed on both the intermediate the known scatter contaminated projection\nimages and the convolution kernel. Our approach can reduce the scatter\nartifacts from 12.930 to 2.133.\n", "  The question of whether a fully classical client can delegate a quantum\ncomputation to an untrusted quantum server while fully maintaining privacy\n(blindness) is one of the big open questions in quantum cryptography. Both yes\nand no answers have important practical and theoretical consequences, and the\nquestion seems genuinely hard. The state-of-the-art approaches to securely\ndelegating quantum computation, without exception, rely on granting the client\nmodest quantum powers, or on additional, non-communicating, quantum servers. In\nthis work, we consider the single server setting, and push the boundaries of\nthe minimal devices of the client, which still allow for blind quantum\ncomputation. Our approach is based on the observation that, in many blind\nquantum computing protocols, the \"quantum\" part of the protocol, from the\nclients perspective, boils down to the establishing classical-quantum\ncorrelations (independent from the computation) between the client and the\nserver, following which the steering of the computation itself requires only\nclassical communication. Here, we abstract this initial preparation phase,\nspecifically for the Universal Blind Quantum Computation protocol of Broadbent,\nFitzsimons and Kashefi. We identify sufficient criteria on the powers of the\nclient, which still allow for secure blind quantum computation. We work in a\nuniversally composable framework, and provide a series of protocols, where each\nstep reduces the number of differing states the client needs to be able to\nprepare. As the limit of such reductions, we show that the capacity to prepare\njust two pure states, which have an arbitrarily high overlap (thus are\narbitrarily close to identical), suffices for efficient and secure blind\nquantum computation.\n", "  The present study deals with a theoretical analysis of the effect of delay\ntime of energy transport upon the generation of complex dynamics in continuous\nphysical system. The importance of this time for the presence of quasi -\nperiodicity and chaos in a reactor is demonstrated. The considerations are\npreceded by the analysis of one - dimensional mathematical model.\n", "  The ATLAS muon spectrometer uses drift-tube chambers for precision tracking.\nThe performance of these chambers in the presence of magnetic field and high\nradiation fluxes is studied in this article using test-beam data recorded in\nthe Gamma Irradiation Facility at CERN. The measurements are compared to\ndetailed predictions provided by the Garfield drift-chamber simulation\nprogramme.\n", "  Three kinds of fractal solutions of model of reactors are presented. The\nfirst kind concerns the structure of Feigenbaum_s diagram on the limit of\nchaos. The second kind and the third one concern the effect of initial\nconditions on the dynamic solutions of models. In the course of computations\ntwo types of recirculation were considered, viz. the recirculation of mass\n(return of a part of products stream) and recirculation of heat (heat exchange\nin the external heat exchanger).\n", "  The empirical relation of T_co(K)=2740/<q>_c^4 between the transition\ntemperature of optimum doped superconductors T_co and the mean cationic charge\n<q>_c, a physical paradox, can be recast to strongly support fractal theories\nof high-T_c superconductors, thereby applying the finding that the optimum hole\nconcentration of h^+ = 0.229 can be linked with the universal fractal constant\ndelta_1 = 8.72109... of the renormalized Henon map. The transition temperature\nobviously increases steeply with a domain structure of ever narrower size,\ncharacterized by Fibonacci numbers. With this backing superconductivity above\nroom temperature can be conceived for synthetic sandwich structures of <q>_c\nless than 2+. For instance, composites of tenorite and cuprite respectively\ntenorite and CuI (CuBr, CuCl) onto AuCu alloys are proposed. This specification\nis suggested by previously described filamentary superconductivity of 'bulk'\nCuO_1-x samples. In addition, cesium substitution in the Tl-1223 compound is an\noption. A low mean cationic charge allows the development of a frustrated\nnano-sized fractal structure of possible ferroelastic nature delivering\nnano-channels for the very fast charge transport, in common for both high-T_c\nsuperconductors and organic inorganic halide perovskite solar materials.\n", "  The paper deals with the theoretical analysis of a logistic system composed\nof at least two elements with distributed parameters. It has been shown that\nsuch a system may generate specific oscillations in spite of the fact that the\nsolutions of the mathematical method are characterized by no dynamic\nbifurcations. It has also been shown that the time series of the state\nvariables of such a system may behave in a semi-chaotic way. This means that\nthey have then predictable and unpredictable fragments. The analysis has been\nillustrated by two examples, viz. of a simple logistic model and of a reactor\nwith feedback.\n", "  In this article the role of the supersaturation density equation of state\n(EOS) is explored in simulations of failed core-collapse supernova explosions.\nTherefore the nuclear EOS is extended via a one-parameter excluded volume\ndescription for baryons, taking into account their finite and increasing volume\nwith increasing density in excess of saturation density. Parameters are\nselected such that the resulting supernova EOS represent extreme cases, with\nhigh pressure variations at supersaturation density which feature extreme stiff\nand soft EOS variants of the reference case, i.e. without excluded volume\ncorrections. Unlike in the interior of neutron stars with central densities in\nexcess of several times saturation density, central densities of core-collapse\nsupernovae reach only slightly above saturation density. Hence, the impact of\nthe supersaturation density EOS on the supernova dynamics as well as the\nneutrino signal is found to be negligible. It is mainly determined from the\nlow- and intermediate-density domain, which is left unmodified within this\ngeneralized excluded volume approach.\n", "  A comprehensive analysis of the structure of the nuclear matrix elements\n(NMEs) of neutrinoless double beta-minus decays to the 0^+ ground and first\nexcited states is performed in terms of the contributing multipole states in\nthe intermediate nuclei of neutrinoless double beta-minus transitions. We\nconcentrate on the transitions mediated by the light (l-NMEs) Majorana\nneutrinos. As nuclear model we use the proton-neutron quasiparticle\nrandom-phase approximation (pnQRPA) with a realistic two-nucleon interaction\nbased on the Bonn one-boson-exchange G matrix. In the computations we include\nthe appropriate short-range correlations, nucleon form factors, higher-order\nnucleonic weak currents and restore the isospin symmetry by the\nisoscalar-isovector decomposition of the particle-particle proton-neutron\ninteraction parameter g_{pp}.\n", "  This paper presents an enhancement to the free surface lattice Boltzmann\nmethod (FSLBM) for the simulation of bubbly flows including rupture and breakup\nof bubbles. The FSLBM uses a volume of fluid approach to reduce the problem of\na liquid-gas two-phase flow to a single-phase free surface simulation. In\nbubbly flows compression effects leading to an increase or decrease of pressure\nin the suspended bubbles cannot be neglected. Therefore, the free surface\nsimulation is augmented by a bubble model that supplies the missing information\nby tracking the topological changes of the free surface in the flow. The new\nmodel presented here is capable of handling the effects of bubble breakup and\ncoalesce without causing a significant computational overhead. Thus, the\nenhanced bubble model extends the applicability of the FSLBM to a new range of\npractically relevant problems, like bubble formation and development in\nchemical reactors or foaming processes.\n", "  We analyze two two-mode continuous variable separable states with the same\nmarginal states. We adopt the definition of classicality in the form of\nwell-defined positive Wigner function describing the state and find that\nalthough the states possess positive local Wigner functions, they exhibit\nnegative Wigner functions for the global states. Using the negativity of Wigner\nfunction as an indicator of nonclassicality, we show that despite these states\npossess different negativities of the Wigner function, they do not reveal this\ndifference as phase space nonclassicalities such as negativity of the Mandel\n$Q$ parameter or quadrature squeezing. We then concentrate on quantum\ncorrelation of these states and show that quantum discord and local quantum\nuncertainty, as two well-defined measures of quantum correlation, manifest the\ndifference between negativity of the Wigner functions. The non-Gaussianity of\nthese states is also examined and show that the difference in behavior of their\nnon-Gaussianity is the same as the difference between negativity of their\nWigner functions. We also investigate the influence of correlation rank\ncriterion and find that when the states can be produced locally from classical\nstates, the Wigner functions can not reveal their quantum correlations.\n", "  In his 2003 paper \"Towards an algebraic theory of Boolean circuits\", Lafont\nnotes that the class of reversible circuits over a set of k truth values is\nfinitely generated when k is odd. He cites a private communication for the\nproof. The purpose of this short note is to make the content of that\ncommunication available.\n", "  An active microwave C-section is proposed which provides a flat magnitude\ntransmission in a wide frequency band along with a frequency-dependent group\ndelay response considering practical dissipation losses. The key lies in\nintegrating a constant gain amplifier inside a microwave C-section, which\nperfectly compensates the distributed conductor and dielectric losses of the\ncoupler, while preserving the intrinsic dispersion of the C-section. The\noperation of the proposed device is confirmed using numerical analysis.\n", "  An accurate understanding of the interplay between random and deterministic\nprocesses in generating extreme events is of critical importance in many\nfields, from forecasting extreme meteorological events to the catastrophic\nfailure of materials and in the Earth. Here we investigate the statistics of\nrecord-breaking events in the time series of crackling noise generated by local\nrupture events during the compressive failure of porous materials. The events\nare generated by computer simulations of the uni-axial compression of\ncylindrical samples in a discrete element model of sedimentary rocks that\nclosely resemble those of real experiments. The number of records grows\ninitially as a decelerating power law of the number of events, followed by an\nacceleration immediately prior to failure. We demonstrate the existence of a\ncharacteristic record rank k^* which separates the two regimes of the time\nevolution. Up to this rank deceleration occurs due to the effect of random\ndisorder. Record breaking then accelerates towards macroscopic failure, when\nphysical interactions leading to spatial and temporal correlations dominate the\nlocation and timing of local ruptures. Sub-sequences of bursts between\nconsecutive records are characterized by a power law size distribution with an\nexponent which decreases as failure is approached. High rank records are\npreceded by bursts of increasing size and waiting time between consecutive\nevents and they are followed by a relaxation process. As a reference, surrogate\ntime series are generated by reshuffling the crackling bursts. The record\nstatistics of the uncorrelated surrogates agrees very well with the\ncorresponding predictions of independent identically distributed random\nvariables, which confirms that the temporal and spatial correlation of cracking\nbursts are responsible for the observed unique behaviour.\n", "  Using finite discrete group characters and symmetry breaking by hyperflux as\nwell as constraints on top- quark family, we study minimal low energy effective\ntheory following from SU$_{5}\\times D_{4}$ models embedded in F-theory with non\nabelian flux. Matter curves spectrum of the models is obtained from\nSU$_{5}\\times S_{5}$ theory with monodromy $S_{5}$ by performing two breakings;\nfirst from symmetric group $S_{5}$ to $S_{4}$ subsymmetry; and next to dihedral\n$D_{4}$ subgroup. As a consequence, and depending on the ways of decomposing\ntriplets of $S_{4}$, we end with three types of $D_{4}$- models. Explicit\nconstructions of these theories are given and a MSSM- like spectrum is derived.\n", "  The contributions of one-loop diagrams with dynamical vector mesons to masses\nand decay constants of pseudoscalar mesons are determined. Hereby, a\nrelativistic Lagrangian for both the pseudoscalar-meson octet and the\nvector-meson nonet is used. The vector mesons are given in the antisymmetric\ntensor representation. Both the differences between static and dynamical vector\nmesons and the differences between calculations with and without vector mesons\nare studied as functions of the light quark mass.\n", "  This paper is devoted to reviewing several recent developments concerning\ncertain class of geophysical models, including the primitive equations (PEs) of\natmospheric and oceanic dynamics and a tropical atmosphere model. The PEs for\nlarge-scale oceanic and atmospheric dynamics are derived from the Navier-Stokes\nequations coupled to the heat convection by adopting the Boussinesq and\nhydrostatic approximations, while the tropical atmosphere model considered here\nis a nonlinear interaction system between the barotropic mode and the first\nbaroclinic mode of the tropical atmosphere with moisture.\n  We are mainly concerned with the global well-posedness of strong solutions to\nthese systems, with full or partial viscosity, as well as certain singular\nperturbation small parameter limits related to these systems, including the\nsmall aspect ratio limit from the Navier-Stokes equations to the PEs, and a\nsmall relaxation-parameter in the tropical atmosphere model. These limits\nprovide a rigorous justification to the hydrostatic balance in the PEs, and to\nthe relaxation limit of the tropical atmosphere model, respectively. Some\nconditional uniqueness of weak solutions, and the global well-posedness of weak\nsolutions with certain class of discontinuous initial data, to the PEs are also\npresented.\n", "  Topological quantum materials, including topological insulators and\nsuperconductors, Dirac semimetals and Weyl semimetals, have attracted much\nattention recently for their unique electronic structure, spin texture and\nphysical properties. Very lately, a new type of Weyl semimetals has been\nproposed where the Weyl Fermions emerge at the boundary between electron and\nhole pockets in a new phase of matter, which is distinct from the standard type\nI Weyl semimetals with a point-like Fermi surface. The Weyl cone in this type\nII semimetals is strongly tilted and the related Fermi surface undergos a\nLifshitz transition, giving rise to a new kind of chiral anomaly and other new\nphysics. MoTe2 is proposed to be a candidate of a type II Weyl semimetal; the\nsensitivity of its topological state to lattice constants and correlation also\nmakes it an ideal platform to explore possible topological phase transitions.\nBy performing laser-based angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) measurements\nwith unprecedentedly high resolution, we have uncovered electronic evidence of\ntype II semimetal state in MoTe2. We have established a full picture of the\nbulk electronic states and surface state for MoTe2 that are consistent with the\nband structure calculations. A single branch of surface state is identified\nthat connects bulk hole pockets and bulk electron pockets. Detailed\ntemperature-dependent ARPES measurements show high intensity spot-like features\nthat is ~40 meV above the Fermi level and is close to the momentum space\nconsistent with the theoretical expectation of the type II Weyl points. Our\nresults constitute electronic evidence on the nature of the Weyl semimetal\nstate that favors the presence of two sets of type II Weyl points in MoTe2.\n", "  We revisit the question of whether a two-dimensional topological insulator\nmay arise in a commensurate N\\'eel antiferromagnet, where staggered\nmagnetization breaks both the elementary translation and time reversal, but\nretains their product as a symmetry. In contrast to the so-called $Z_2$\ntopological insulators, an exhaustive characterization of antiferromagnetic\ntopological phases with the help of a topological invariant has been missing.\nWe analyze a simple model of an antiferromagnetic topological insulator and\nchart its phase diagram based on a recently proposed criterion for\ncentrosymmetric systems [Fang et al., Phys. Rev. B 88, 085406 (2013)]. We then\nadapt two methods, originally designed for paramagnetic systems, and make\nantiferromagnetic topological phases manifest. The proposed methods apply far\nbeyond the particular example treated in this work, and admit straightforward\ngeneralization. We illustrate this by considering a non-centrosymmetric system,\nwhere there are no simple criteria to identify topological phases. We also\npresent an explicit construction of edge states in an antiferromagnetic\ntopological insulator.\n", "  We carried out detailed studies of the magnetic structure, magnetoelastic\ncoupling, and thermal properties of EuCrO$_3$ nano-powders from room\ntemperature to liquid helium temperature. Our neutron powder diffraction and\nX-ray powder diffraction measurements provide precise atomic positions of all\natoms in the cell, especially for the light oxygen atoms. The low-temperature\nneutron powder diffraction data revealed extra Bragg peaks of magnetic origin\nwhich can be attributed to a $G_x$ antiferromagnetic structure with an ordered\nmoment of $\\sim$ 2.4 $\\mu_{\\rm B}$ consistent with the $3d^3$ electronic\nconfiguration of the Cr$^{3+}$ cations. Apart from previously reported\nantiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic transitions in EuCrO$_3$ at low\ntemperatures, we also observed an anomaly at about 100 K. This anomaly was\nobserved in temperature dependence of sample's, lattice parameters, thermal\nexpansion, Raman spectroscopy, permittivity and conductance measurements. This\nanomaly is attributed to the magnetoelastic distortion in the EuCrO$_3$\ncrystal.\n", "  In the present paper we consider the coupled system of nonlinear\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equations with the fractional Laplacian \\[ \\left\\{\n\\begin{aligned}\n  (-\\Delta)^\\alpha u_1 & = \\lambda_1u_1+f_1(u_1)+\\partial_1F(u_1,u_2)\\ \\\n\\mathrm{in}\\ \\mathbb{R}^N, \\\\\n  (-\\Delta)^\\alpha u_2 & = \\lambda_2u_2+f_2(u_2)+\\partial_2F(u_1,u_2)\\ \\\n\\mathrm{in}\\ \\mathbb{R}^N, \\end{aligned} \\right. \\] where $u_1,\nu_2:\\mathbb{R}^N\\to \\mathbb{C},\\ N\\geq 2,$ and $0<\\alpha<1.$ By studying an\nappropriate family of constrained minimization problems, we obtain the\nexistence of solutions in the space $H^\\alpha(\\mathbb{R}^N) \\times\nH^\\alpha(\\mathbb{R}^N)$ satisfying \\[ \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^N}|u_1|^2\\ dx =\n\\sigma_1\\ \\ \\textrm{and}\\ \\ \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^N}|u_2|^2\\ dx=\\sigma_2 \\] for\ngiven $\\sigma_j>0.$ The numbers $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$ in the system\nappear as Lagrange multiplier. The method is based on the concentration\ncompactness arguments, but introduces a new way to verify some of the\nproperties of the variational problem that are required in order for the\nconcentration compactness method to work. We consider the case when\n$f_j(s)=\\mu_j|s|^{p_j-2}s$ and $F(s,t)=\\beta |s|^{r_1}|t|^{r_2}$ with $\\mu_j>0,\n\\beta>0,$ and the values $r_i>1, 2<p_j, r_1+r_2<2+\\frac{4\\alpha}{N}.$ The\nmethod also enables us to prove the stability result of standing wave solutions\nassociated with the set of global minimizers.\n", "  The search for life on the planets outside the Solar System can be broadly\nclassified into the following: looking for Earth-like conditions or the planets\nsimilar to the Earth (Earth similarity), and looking for the possibility of\nlife in a form known or unknown to us (habitability). The two frequently used\nindices, ESI and PHI, describe heuristic methods to score\nsimilarity/habitability in the efforts to categorize different exoplanets or\nexomoons. ESI, in particular, considers Earth as the reference frame for\nhabitability and is a quick screening tool to categorize and measure physical\nsimilarity of any planetary body with the Earth. The PHI assesses the\nprobability that life in some form may exist on any given world, and is based\non the essential requirements of known life: a stable and protected substrate,\nenergy, appropriate chemistry and a liquid medium. We propose here a different\nmetric, a Cobb-Douglas Habitability Score (CDHS), based on Cobb-Douglas\nhabitability production function (CD-HPF), which computes the habitability\nscore by using measured and calculated planetary input parameters. The proposed\nmetric, with exponents accounting for metric elasticity, is endowed with\nverifiable analytical properties that ensure global optima, and is scalable to\naccommodate finitely many input parameters. The model is elastic, does not\nsuffer from curvature violations and, as we discovered, the standard PHI is a\nspecial case of CDHS. Computed CDHS scores are fed to K-NN (K-Nearest\nNeighbour) classification algorithm with probabilistic herding that facilitates\nthe assignment of exoplanets to appropriate classes via supervised feature\nlearning methods, producing granular clusters of habitability. The proposed\nwork describes a decision-theoretical model using the power of convex\noptimization and algorithmic machine learning.\n", "  In this paper, we try to put the results of Smilansky and al. on \"Topological\nresonances\" on a mathematical basis.A key role in the asymptotic of resonances\nnear the real axis for Quantum Graphs is played by the set of metrics for which\nthere exists compactly supported eigenfunctions. We give several estimateof the\ndimension of this semi-algebraic set, in particular in terms of the girth of\nthe graph. The case oftrees is also discussed.\n", "  The authors of paper commented claim that trimethylammonium\ntetrachlorozincate crystal shows at 282 K the ferroelectric-paraelectric phase\ntransition. But no ferroelectric hysteresis loop was observed below this\ntemperature. Moreover, in the low-temperature phase the ferroelectric domain\nwalls should exist giving dielectric relaxation in a low frequency electric\nfield. The authors conclude that the phase transition is of the second order.\nThis conclusion is contrary to the DSC data where the phase transition has a\nstrong first order character. In the whole measured temperature range the\ndielectric loss is 100 times higher than the real part of dielectric constant.\n", "  We report the electronic structure, electric and thermal transport properties\nof Ru$_{1-x}$Ir$_{x}$Se$_2$ ($x \\leq 0.2$). RuSe$_2$ is a semiconductor that\ncrystallizes in a cubic pyrite unit cell. The Seebeck coefficient of RuSe$_2$\nexceeds -200 $\\mu$V/K around 730 K. Ir substitution results in the suppression\nof the resistivity and the Seebeck coefficient, suggesting the removal of the\npeaks in density of states near the Fermi level. Ru$_{0.8}$Ir$_{0.2}$Se$_{2}$\nshows a semiconductor-metal crossover at about 30 K. The magnetic field\nrestores the semiconducting behavior. Our results indicate the importance of\nthe electronic correlations in enhanced thermoelectricity of RuSb$_{2}$.\n", "  In quasars which are lensed by galaxies, the point-like images sometimes show\nsharp and uncorrelated brightness variations (microlensing). These brightness\nchanges are associated with the innermost region of the quasar passing through\na complicated pattern of caustics produced by the stars in the lensing galaxy.\nIn this paper, we study whether the universal properties of optical caustics\ncould enable extraction of shape information about the central engine of\nquasars. We present a toy model with a crescent-shaped source crossing a fold\ncaustic. The silhouette of a black hole over an accretion disk tends to produce\nroughly crescent sources. When a crescent-shaped source crosses a fold caustic,\nthe resulting light curve is noticeably different from the case of a circular\nluminosity profile or Gaussian source. With good enough monitoring data, the\ncrescent parameters, apart from one degeneracy, can be recovered.\n", "  I analyze the recent observation of a Bose metal in NbSe$_2$ and place these\nresults in the wider context of the first sighting of such a phase in amorphous\nBi and MoGe thin films.\n", "  These notes are from a series of lectures given at the Universidad de Los\nAndes in Bogot\\'a, Colombia on some topics of current interest in quantum\ninformation. While they aim to be self-contained, they are necessarily\nincomplete and idiosyncratic in their coverage. For a more thorough\nintroduction to the subject, we recommend one of the textbooks by Nielsen and\nChuang or by Wilde, or the lecture notes of Mermin, Preskill or Watrous. Our\nnotes by contrast are meant to be a relatively rapid introduction into some\nmore contemporary topics in this fast-moving field. They are meant to be\naccessible to advanced undergraduates or starting graduate students.\n", "  The threshold displacement energy (TDE) is the minimum amount of kinetic\nenergy required to displace an atom from its lattice site. The magnitude of the\nTDE displays significant variance as a function of the crystallographic\ndirection, system temperature and applied strain, among a variety of other\nfactors. It is critically important to determine an accurate value of the TDE\nin order to calculate the total number of displacements due to a given\nirradiation condition, and thus to understand the materials response to\nirradiation. In this study, molecular dynamics simulations have been performed\nto calculate the threshold displacement energy in body-centered cubic iron as a\nfunction of strain and temperature. With applied strain, a decrease of the TDE\nof up to approximately 14 eV was observed. A temperature increase from 300 K to\n500 K can result in an increase of the TDE of up to approximately 9 eV.\n", "  We investigate Hawking radiation from a five-dimensional Lovelock black hole\nusing the Hamilton-Jacobi method. The behavior of the rate of radiation is\nplotted for various values of the ultraviolet correction parameter and the\ncosmological constant. The results show that, owing to the ultraviolet\ncorrection and the presence of dark energy represented by the cosmological\nconstant, the black hole radiates at a slower rate in comparison to the case\nwithout ultraviolet correction or cosmological constant. Moreover, the presence\nof the cosmological constant makes the effect of the ultraviolet correction on\nthe black hole radiation negligible.\n", "  To facilitate the search for a continuum limit of causal dynamical\ntriangulations, Ambjorn, Coumbe, Gizbert-Studnicki, and Jurkiewicz recently\nreported measurements of the lattice spacing as a function of the bare\ncouplings. Although these authors' methods are technically sound, the\nconclusions that they draw from their analyses rest crucially on certain\nunstated assumptions. I elucidate these assumptions, and I argue that our\ncurrent understanding of causal dynamical triangulations does not entail their\njustification.\n", "  The propagation of electromagnetic waves is investigated in the context of\nthe isotropic and nonlinear dielectric media at rest in the eikonal limit of\nthe geometrical optics. Taking into account the functional dependence\n$\\varepsilon=\\varepsilon(E,B)$ and $\\mu=\\mu(E,B)$ for the dielectric\ncoefficients, a set of phenomena related to the birefringence of the\nelectromagnetic waves induced by external fields are derived and discussed. Our\nresults contemplate the known cases already reported in the literature: Kerr,\nCotton-Mouton, Jones and magnetoelectric effects. Moreover, new effects are\npresented here as well as the perspectives of its experimental confirmations.\n", "  The Abraham--Minkowski controversy refers to a long-standing inability to\nadequately address certain issues involving the conservation of the momentum of\nan electromagnetic field in a linear dielectric medium. We apply the usual\nassumption of a material subsystem that couples to the electromagnetic\nsubsystem such that the total energy and total momentum are conserved. We then\nconstruct the total energy--momentum tensor from the total energy density and\nthe total momentum density. Applying conservation principles to the total\nenergy--momentum tensor, we construct the tensor energy--momentum continuity\nequation. We show that one of the components of the tensor energy--momentum\ncontinuity equation, the energy continuity equation, is manifestly false. We\nconclude that the Abraham--Minkowski controversy is unresolvable because the\nextant principles of conservation are inconsistent in a simple linear\ndielectric medium.\n", "  Four-wave mixing (4WM) is a known source of intense non-classical twin beams.\nIt can be generated when an intense laser beam (the pump) and a weak laser beam\n(the seed) overlap in a $\\chi^{(3)}$ medium (here cesium vapor), with\nfrequencies close to resonance with atomic transitions. The twin beams\ngenerated by 4WM have frequencies naturally close to atomic transitions, and\ncan be intense (gain $\\gg 1$) even in the CW pump regime, which is not the case\nfor PDC $\\chi^{(2)}$ phenomenon in non-linear crystals. So, 4WM is well suited\nfor atom-light interaction and atom-based quantum protocols. Here we present\nthe first realization of a source of 4-wave mixing exploiting $D_2$ line of\nCesium atoms.\n", "  Two atmospheric responses to simulated astrophysical ionizing radiation\nevents significant to life on Earth are production of odd-nitrogen species,\nespecially NO2, and subsequent depletion of stratospheric ozone. Ozone\ndepletion increases incident short-wavelength ultraviolet radiation (UVB,\n280-315 nm) and longer ( > 600 nm) wavelengths of photosynthetically available\nradiation (PAR, 400 -700 nm). On the other hand, the NO2 haze decreases\natmospheric transmission in the long-wavelength UVA (315-400 nm) and short\nwavelength PAR. Here we use the results of previous simulations of incident\nspectral irradiance following an ionizing radiation event to predict changes in\nTerran productivity focusing on photosynthesis of marine phytoplankton. The\nprediction is based on a spectral model of photosynthetic response developed\nfor the dominant genera in central regions of the ocean (Synechococcus and\nProchlorococcus), and remote-sensing based observations of spectral water\ntransparency, temperature, wind speed and mixed layer depth. Predicted\nproductivity declined after a simulated ionizing event, but the effect\nintegrated over the water column was small. For integrations taking into\naccount the full depth range of PAR transmission (down to 0.1% of utilizable\nPAR), the decrease was at most 2-3% (depending on strain), with larger effects\n(5-7%) for integrations just to the depth of the surface mixed layer. The\ndeeper integrations were most affected by the decreased utilizable PAR at depth\ndue to the NO2 haze, whereas shallower integrations were most affected by the\nincreased surface UV.\n", "  In this thesis, I analyse the 2D anisotropic Baryon Acoustic Oscillation\n(BAO) signal present in the final WiggleZ dataset. I utilise newly released\ncovariance matrices from the WizCOLA simulations and follow well tested\nmethodologies used in prior analyses of the BAO signal in alternative datasets.\nThe WiggleZ data is presented in two forms - in multipole expansion and in data\nwedges - both of which are analysed in this thesis. I test my model against\nprevious one dimensional analyses of the BAO signal in the WiggleZ data and\nagainst WizCOLA simulations, and find it to be free of bias or systematic\noffsets. However, the analysis on the wedge data format was unable to properly\nconstrain cosmological parameters, and thus discarded in favour of the\nmultipole analysis. The multipole analysis determined $\\Omega_c h^2$, $H(z)$\nand $D_A(z)$ for three redshift bins, of effective redshifts $z = 0.44, 0.60$\nand $0.73$. The respective constraints on $\\Omega_c h^2$ are\n$0.119^{+0.029}_{-0.026}$, $0.151^{+0.038}_{-0.025}$ and\n$0.140^{+0.036}_{-0.022}$. The fits for $H(z)$ are respectively $87 \\pm 16$,\n$90 \\pm 15$ and $82 \\pm 13$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, and for $D_A(z)$ I find\nvalues of $1300 \\pm 160$, $1300 \\pm 180$ and $1350 \\pm 160$ Mpc. These\ncosmological constraints are consistent with Flat $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology.\n", "  Defect engineering has brought about a unique level of control for Si-based\nsemiconductors, leading to the optimization of various opto-electronic\nproperties and devices. With regard to perovskite transition metal oxides,\noxygen vacancies have been a key ingredient in defect engineering, as they play\na central role in determining the crystal field and consequent electronic\nstructure, leading to important electronic and magnetic phase transitions.\nTherefore, experimental approaches toward understanding the role of defects in\ncomplex oxides have been largely limited to controlling oxygen vacancies. In\nthis study, we report on the selective formation of different types of\nelemental vacancies and their individual roles in determining the atomic and\nelectronic structure of perovskite SrTiO3 (STO) homoepitaxial thin films\nfabricated by pulsed laser epitaxy. Structural and electronic transitions have\nbeen achieved via selective control of the Sr and oxygen vacancy\nconcentrations, respectively, indicating a decoupling between the two phase\ntransitions. In particular, oxygen vacancies were responsible for\nmetal-insulator transitions, but did not influence the Sr vacancy induced\ncubic-to-tetragonal structural transition in epitaxial STO thin film. The\nindependent control of multiple phase transitions in complex oxides by\nexploiting selective vacancy engineering opens up an unprecedented opportunity\ntoward understanding and customizing complex oxide thin films.\n", "  Quasigeostrophic turbulence on a beta-plane with a finite deformation radius\nis studied nu- merically, with particular emphasis on frequency and combined\nwavenumber-frequency do- main analyses. Under suitable conditions, simulations\nwith small-scale random forcing and large-scale drag exhibit a spontaneous\nformation of multiple zonal jets. The first hint of wave-like features is seen\nin the distribution of kinetic energy as a function of frequency; specifically,\nfor progressively larger deformation scales there are systematic departures in\nthe form of isolated peaks (at progressively higher frequencies) from a\npower-law scaling. Con- comitantly, there is an inverse flux of kinetic energy\nin frequency space which extends to lower frequencies for smaller deformation\nscales. The identification of these peaks as Rossby waves is made possible by\nexamining the energy spectrum in frequency-zonal wavenumber and\nfrequency-meridional wavenumber diagrams. In fact, the modified Rhines scale\nturns out to be a useful measure of the dominant meridional wavenumber of the\nmodulating Rossby waves; once this is fixed, apart from a spectral peak at the\norigin (the steady jet), almost all the energy is contained in westward\npropagating disturbances that follow the theoretical Rossby dispersion\nrelation. Quite consistently, noting that the zonal scale of the modulating\nwaves is restricted to the first few wavenumbers, the energy spectrum is almost\nentirely contained within the corresponding Rossby dispersion curves on a\nfrequency-meridional wavenumber diagram. Cases when jets do not form are also\nconsidered; once again, there is a hint of Rossby wave activity, though the\nspectral peaks are quite muted. Further, the kinetic energy scaling in\nfrequency domain follows a -5/3 power-law and is distributed much more broadly\nin frequency-wavenumber diagrams\n", "  Numerical studies are reported to support the idea to explain the particle\nproduction in late inflationary era based on the parametric resonance with a\nnoise effect. Two nonperturbative renormalization group formulations are used\nto numerically calculate the time evolution of particle numbers. Firstly, the\ndynamical renormalization group (DRG) method is applied to sum up the secular\ncontributions. Secondly, we derive an exact evolution equation of the particle\nnumber which turned out to be possible surprisingly owing to the presence of\nthe noise effect. Our numerical results show a drastic enhancement of the\nparticle production in agreement with earlier works qualitatively. A comparison\nis made of numerical results based on two methods. Our work provides\nnonperturbative and quantitative methods to evaluate the particle production\nfor the inflationary cosmology.\n", "  We demonstrate the first experimental observation of coherent population\noscillation, an optical analogue of electromagnetically induced transparency,\nin graphene based on phase sensitive pump-probe system. Degenerate\nfour-wave-mixing between pump and probe modifies the dispersion and absorption\nof the population oscillation process in graphene, and leads to enhance and\ndepression of modulation instability with asymmetry in frequency. The\nanalytically predicted asymmetrical burning hole fully consists with the\nexperiments.\n", "  How to generate genuine quantum randomness from untrusted devices is an\nimportant problem in quantum information processing. Inspired by previous work\non a self-testing quantum random number generator [T. Lunghi et al., Phys. Rev.\nLett. 114, 150501 (2015)], we present a method to generate quantum randomness\nfrom a prepare-and-measure scenario with independent devices. In existing\nprotocols, the quantum randomness depends only on a witness value (e.g.,\nClauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt value), which is calculated with the observed\nprobabilities. Differently, here all the observed probabilities are directly\nused to calculate the min-entropy in our method. Through numerical simulation,\nwe find that the min-entropy of our proposed scheme is higher than that in the\nprevious work when a typical untrusted Bennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84) setup is\nused. Consequently, thanks to the proposed method, more genuine quantum random\nnumbers may be obtained than before.\n", "  To probe the late evolution history of the Universe, we adopt two kinds of\noptimal basis systems. One of them is constructed by performing the principle\ncomponent analysis (PCA) and the other is build by taking the multidimensional\nscaling (MDS) approach. Cosmological observables such as the luminosity\ndistance can be decomposed into these basis systems. These basis are optimized\nfor different kinds of cosmological models that based on different physical\nassumptions, even for a mixture model of them. Therefore, the so-called feature\nspace that projected from the basis systems is cosmological model independent,\nand it provide a parameterization for studying and reconstructing the Hubble\nexpansion rate from the supernova luminosity distance and even gamma-ray bursts\n(GRBs) data with self-calibration. The circular problem when using GRBs as\ncosmological candles is naturally eliminated in this procedure. By using the\nLevenberg-Marquardt (LM) technique and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\nmethod, we perform an observational constraint on this kind of\nparameterization. The data we used include the \"joint light-curve analysis\"\n(JLA) data set that consists of $740$ Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) as well as\n$109$ long gamma-ray bursts with the well-known Amati relation.\n", "  Thermoelectric effects result from the coupling of charge and heat transport,\nand can be used for thermometry, cooling and harvesting of thermal energy. The\nmicroscopic origin of thermoelectric effects is a broken electron-hole\nsymmetry, which is usually quite small in metal structures, and vanishes at low\ntemperatures. We report on a combined experimental and theoretical\ninvestigation of thermoelectric effects in superconductor/ferromagnet hybrid\nstructures. We investigate the depencence of thermoelectric currents on the\nthermal excitation, as well as on the presence of a dc bias voltage across the\njunction. Large thermoelectric effects are observed in\nsuperconductor/ferromagnet and superconductor/normal-metal hybrid structures.\nThe spin-independent signals observed under finite voltage bias are shown to be\nreciprocal to the physics of superconductor/normal-metal microrefrigerators.\nThe spin-dependent thermoelectric signals in the linear regime are due to the\ncoupling of spin and heat transport, and can be used to design more efficient\nrefrigerators\n", "  Reciprocal transformations mix the role of the dependent and independent\nvariables to achieve simpler versions or even linearized versions of nonlinear\nPDEs. These transformations help in the identification of a plethora of PDEs\navailable in the Physics and Mathematics literature. Two different equations,\nalthough seemingly unrelated, happen to be equivalent versions of a same\nequation after a reciprocal transformation. In this way, the big number of\nintegrable equations could be greatly diminished by establishing a method to\ndiscern which equations are disguised versions of a common underlying problem.\nThen, a question arises: Is there a way to identify different versions of an\nunderlying common nonlinear problem? Other useful applications of reciprocal\ntransformations are subsequently discussed and illustrated with examples.\n", "  We show that the space-time uncertainty relation for the quantum clock can be\nderived from the maximum force principle.\n", "  The frequency conversion of light has proved to be a crucial technology for\ncommunication, spectroscopy, imaging, and signal processing. In the quantum\nregime, it also offers great potential for realizing quantum networks\nincorporating disparate physical systems and quantum-enhanced information\nprocessing over a large computational space. The frequency conversion of\nquantum light, such as single photons, has been extensively investigated for\nthe last two decades using all-optical frequency mixing, with the ultimate goal\nof realizing lossless and noiseless conversion. I demonstrate another route to\nthis target using frequency conversion induced by cross-phase modulation in a\ndispersion-managed photonic crystal fiber. Owing to the deterministic and\nall-optical nature of the process, the lossless and low-noise spectral\nreshaping of a single-photon wave packet in the telecommunication band has been\nreadily achieved with a modulation bandwidth as large as 0.4 THz. I further\ndemonstrate that the scheme is applicable to manipulations of a nonclassical\nfrequency correlation, wave packet interference, and entanglement between two\nphotons. This approach presents a new coherent frequency interface for photons\nfor quantum information processing.\n", "  Opportunities for investigations of nuclear reactions at the future nuclear\nphysics facilities such as radioactive ion beam facilities and high-power laser\nfacilities are considered. Post-accelerated radioactive ion beams offer\npossibilities for study of the role of isospin asymmetry in the reaction\nmechanisms at various beam energies. Fission barrier heights of\nneutron-deficient nuclei can be directly determined at low energies.\nPost-accelerated radioactive ion beams, specifically at the future facilities\nsuch as HIE-ISOLDE, SPIRAL-2 or RAON-RISP can be also considered as a candidate\nfor production of very neutron-rich nuclei via mechanism of multi-nucleon\ntransfer. High-power laser facilities such as ELI-NP offer possibilities for\nnuclear reaction studies with beams of unprecedented properties. Specific cases\nsuch as ternary reactions or even production of super-heavy elements are\nconsidered.\n", "  We present a statistical assessment of both, observed and reported,\nphotometric uncertainties in the OGLE-IV Galactic bulge microlensing survey\ndata. This dataset is widely used for the detection of variable stars,\ntransient objects, discovery of microlensing events, and characterization of\nthe exo-planetary systems. Large collections of RR Lyrae stars and Cepheids\ndiscovered by the OGLE project toward the Galactic bulge provide light curves\nbased on this dataset. We describe the method of analysis, and provide the\nprocedure, which can be used to update preliminary photometric uncertainties,\nprovided with the light curves, to the ones reflecting the actual observed\nscatter at a given magnitude and for a given CCD detector of the OGLE-IV\ncamera.This is of key importance for data modeling, in particular, for the\ncorrect estimation of the goodness of fit.\n", "  Transfer Entropy and Directed Information are information-theoretic measures\nof the directional dependency between stochastic processes. Following the\ndefinitions of Schreiber and Massey in discrete time, we define and evaluate\nthese measures for the components of multidimensional Gaussian diffusion\nprocesses. When the components are jointly Markov, the Transfer Entropy and\nDirected Information are both measures of influence according to a simple\nphysical principle. More generally, the effect of other components has to be\naccounted for, and this can be achieved in more than one way. We propose two\ndefinitions, one of which preserves the properties of influence of the jointly\nMarkov case. The Transfer Entropy and Directed Information are expressed in\nterms of the solutions of matrix Riccati equations, and so are easy to compute.\nThe definition of continuous-time Directed Information we propose differs from\nthat previously appearing in the literature. We argue that the latter is not\nstrictly directional.\n", "  The purpose of this short note is to collect a set of formulas pertaining to\nmomentum kinematics for higher spin light-front vertices. At least one of the\nformulas seems to be previously unknown.\n", "  Parameterized relativistic dynamics (PRD) is a manifestly covariant quantum\ntheory with invariant evolution parameter. The theory has been applied to\nneutrino flavor oscillations between two mass states. It is generalized here to\ntransitions between three mass states and applied to electron neutrino\noscillations.\n", "  The article consists of four sections all dealing with the computational\nmodeling of the sputtering process. The first section deals with the difference\nin Bismuth atomic layer deposition at different polar angle and ion flounce. In\nthe second section, atomic layer deposition was studied as a function of\nincident Argon ion energy at different pressure conditions. A curve analogous\nto Bragg curve was obtained .In the third section TiOx films was developed by\nsimulations. The sputtering parameters were varied to get different atomic\nlayers. The variation of coverage with sticking coefficient was shown. The last\nsection deals with sputter based deposition of TiN films. The rate of change of\npartial sputtering yield with coverage was considered. The deposition pressure\nand time were varied to get films of different thickness. All the sections are\nstored separately\n", "  By using the first-principles electronic structure calculations, we have\nsystematically studied the magnetism in three recently synthesized iron-based\nantiperovskite chalco-halides: Ba$_3$(FeS$_4$)Cl, Ba$_3$(FeS$_4$)Br, and\nBa$_3$(FeSe$_4$)Br. These compounds consist of edge-sharing Ba$Q_6$ ($Q$=Cl or\nBr) octahedra intercalated with isolated Fe$X_4$ ($X$=S or Se) tetrahedra. We\nfind that even though the shortest distances between the nearest-neighboring Fe\natoms in these three compounds already exceed 6 \\AA, much larger than the bond\nlength of a chemical bonding, they all remarkably show antiferromagnetic (AFM)\ncoupling along $b$ axis with very weak spin-spin correlation along $a$ axis.\nOur study shows that the mechanism underlying this novel AFM coupling is such a\nnew type of exchange interaction between the nearest-neighboring Fe-based\nsuper-moments mediated by Ba cations, which we call the super-super exchange\ninteraction, in which each magnetic Fe atom partially polarizes its four\nnearest-neighboring $X$ atoms to form a super-moment through $p$-$d$ orbital\nhybridization and the $X$ atoms in neighboring Fe$X_4$ tetrahedra along $b$\naxis antiferromagnetically couple with each others through the intermediate Ba\ncations. Different from the conventional superexchange, here it is cations\nrather than anions that mediate two neighboring super-moments. According to the\ncalculated strength of the AFM coupling, we predict that among these compounds\nthe highest AFM phase transition temperature $T_N$ may reach 110 K in\nBa$_3$(FeSe$_4$)Br, in comparison with the observed $T_N$s of 84 K in\nBa$_3$(FeS$_4$)Br and 95 K in Ba$_3$(FeS$_4$)Cl.\n", "  We investigate the triggering of star formation in clouds that form in\nGalactic scale flows as the ISM passes through spiral shocks. We use the\nLagrangian nature of SPH simulations to trace how the star forming gas is\ngathered into self-gravitating cores that collapse to form stars. Large scale\nflows that arise due to Galactic dynamics create shocks of order 30 km/s that\ncompress the gas and form dense clouds $(n> $several $\\times 10^2$ cm$^{-3}$)\nin which self-gravity becomes relevant. These large-scale flows are necessary\nfor creating the dense physical conditions for gravitational collapse and star\nformation. Local gravitational collapse requires densities in excess of\n$n>10^3$ cm$^{-3}$ which occur on size scales of $\\approx 1$ pc for low-mass\nstar forming regions ($M<100 M_{\\odot}$), and up to sizes approaching 10 pc for\nhigher-mass regions ($M>10^3 M_{\\odot}$). Star formation in the 250 pc region\nlasts throughout the 5 Myr timescale of the simulation with a star formation\nrate of $\\approx 10^{-1} M_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$. In the absence of\nfeedback, the efficiency of the star formation per free-fall time varies from\nour assumed 100 % at our sink accretion radius to values of $< 10^{-3}$ at low\ndensities.\n", "  In this work we present an extension of the ROMA map-making code for data\nanalysis of Cosmic Microwave Background polarization, with particular attention\ngiven to the inflationary polarization B-modes. The new algorithm takes into\naccount a possible cross-correlated noise component among the different\ndetectors of a CMB experiment. We tested the code on the observational data of\nthe BOOMERanG (2003) experiment and we show that we are provided with a better\nestimate of the power spectra, in particular the error bars of the BB spectrum\nare smaller up to 20% for low multipoles. We point out the general validity of\nthe new method. A possible future application is the LSPE balloon experiment,\ndevoted to the observation of polarization at large angular scales.\n", "  We study using combinatorial methods the structural coefficients of the\nformal homogeneous universal enveloping algebra Uh(sl2) of the special linear\nalgebra sl2 over a field of characteristic zero. We provide explicit formulae\nfor the product of generic elements in Uh(sl2), and construct combinatorial\nobjects giving flesh to these formulae.\n", "  Topography evolution of Si(100) surface due to oblique incidence low energy\nion beam sputtering (IBS) is investigated. Experiments were carried out at\ndifferent elevated temperatures from 20$^{\\circ}$C to 450$^{\\circ}$C and at\neach temperature, the ion fluence is systematically varied in a wide range from\n$\\sim$ 1$\\times$10$^{18}$cm$^{-2}$ to 1$\\times$10$^{20}$cm$^{-2}$. The ion\nsputtered surface morphologies are characterized by atomic force microscopy and\nhigh-resolution cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy. At room\ntemperature, the ion sputtered surfaces show periodic ripple nanopatterns and\ntheir wave-vector remains parallel to ion beam projection for entire fluence\nrange. With increase of substrate temperature, these patterns tend to demolish\nand reduce into randomly ordered mound-like structures around 350$^{\\circ}$C.\nFurther rise in temperature above 400$^{\\circ}$C leads, surprisingly,\northogonally rotated ripples beyond fluence 5$\\times$10$^{19}$cm$^{-2}$. All\nthe results are discussed combining the theoretical framework of linear,\nnon-linear and recently developed mass redistribution continuum models of\npattern formation by IBS. These results have technological importance regarding\nthe control over ion induced pattern formation as well as it provides useful\ninformation for further progress in theoretical field.\n", "  Increases in atmospheric CO2 and CH4 result from a combination of forcing\nfrom anthropogenic emissions and Earth System feedbacks that reduce or amplify\nthe effects of those emissions on atmospheric concentrations. Despite decades\nof research carbon-climate feedbacks remain poorly quantified. The impact of\nthese uncertainties on future climate are of increasing concern, especially in\nthe wake of recent climate negotiations. Emissions, long concentrated in the\ndeveloped world, are now shifting to developing countries, where the emissions\ninventories have larger uncertainties. The fraction of anthropogenic CO2\nremaining in the atmosphere has remained remarkably constant over the last 50\nyears. Will this change in the future as the climate evolves? Concentrations of\nCH4, the 2nd most important greenhouse gas, which had apparently stabilized,\nhave recently resumed their increase, but the exact cause for this is unknown.\nWhile greenhouse gases affect the global atmosphere, their sources and sinks\nare remarkably heterogeneous in time and space, and traditional in situ\nobserving systems do not provide the coverage and resolution to attribute the\nchanges to these greenhouse gases to specific sources or sinks. In the past few\nyears, space-based technologies have shown promise for monitoring carbon stocks\nand fluxes. Advanced versions of these capabilities could transform our\nunderstanding and provide the data needed to quantify carbon-climate feedbacks.\nA new observing system that allows resolving global high resolution fluxes will\ncapture variations on time and space scales that allow the attribution of these\nfluxes to underlying mechanisms.\n", "  A new type of Weyl semimetal state, in which the energy values of Weyl nodes\nare not the local extrema, has been theoretically proposed recently, namely\ntype II Weyl semimetal. Distinguished from type I semimetal (e.g. TaAs), the\nFermi surfaces in a type II Weyl semimetal consist of a pair of electron and\nhole pockets touching at the Weyl node. In addition, Weyl fermions in type II\nWeyl semimetals violate Lorentz invariance. Due to these qualitative\ndifferences distinct spectroscopy and magnetotransport properties are expected\nin type II Weyl semimetals. Here, we present the direct observation of the\nFermi arc states in MoTe2 by using angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy.\nTwo arc states are identified for each pair of Weyl nodes whoes surface\nprojections of them possess single topological charge, which is a unique\nproperty for type II Weyl semimetals. The experimentally determined Fermi arcs\nare consistent with our first principle calculations. Our results unambiguously\nestablish that MoTe2 is a type II Weyl semimetal, which serves as a great test\nbed to investigate the phenomena of new type of Weyl fermions with Lorentz\ninvariance violated.\n", "  We report on the emergence of an Electronic Griffiths Phase (EGP) in the\ndoped semiconductor FeSb$_{2}$, predicted for disordered insulators with random\nlocalized moments in the vicinity of a metal-insulator transition (MIT).\nMagnetic, transport, and thermodynamic measurements of\nFe(Sb$_{1-x}$Te$_{x}$)$_{2}$ single crystals show signatures of\ndisorder-induced non-Fermi liquid behavior and a Wilson ratio expected for\nstrong electronic correlations. The EGP states are found on the metallic\nboundary, between the insulating state ($x = 0$) and a long-range albeit weak\nmagnetic order ($x \\geq 0.075$).\n", "  Using quantum field-theoretic arguments, Witten has established a relation\nbetween the Donaldson and Seiberg-Witten invariants of smooth four-manifolds.\nIn this survey article, we describe the program to prove this relation using a\nmoduli space of PU(2) = SO(3) monopoles as a cobordism between the Donaldson\nmoduli space of anti-self-dual SO(3) connections and moduli spaces of U(1)\nmonopoles. We provide an overview of some of our transversality and Uhlenbeck\ncompactness results for PU(2) monopoles, along with some of our calculations of\nDonaldson invariants in terms of Seiberg-Witten invariants. We give a brief\noutline of issues concerning the gluing theory, focussing on some of the\nanalytical difficulties that are particular to PU(2) monopoles, and its\napplication to the PU(2) monopole program to prove the relation between\nDonaldson and Seiberg-Witten invariants.\n", "  In this article we complete the proof---for a broad class of\nfour-manifolds---of Witten's conjecture that the Donaldson and Seiberg-Witten\nseries coincide, at least through terms of degree less than or equal to c-2,\nwhere c is a linear combination of the Euler characteristic and signature of\nthe four-manifold. This article is a revision of sections 4--7 of an earlier\nversion, while a revision of sections 1--3 of that earlier version now appear\nin a separate companion article (math.DG/0007190). Here, we use our\ncomputations of Chern classes for the virtual normal bundles for the\nSeiberg-Witten strata from the companion article (math.DG/0007190), a\ncomparison of all the orientations, and the PU(2) monopole cobordism to compute\npairings with the links of level-zero Seiberg-Witten moduli subspaces of the\nmoduli space of PU(2) monopoles. These calculations then allow us to compute\nlow-degree Donaldson invariants in terms of Seiberg-Witten invariants and\nprovide a partial verification of Witten's conjecture.\n", "  This is the first of two articles in which we give a proof - for a broad\nclass of four-manifolds - of Witten's conjecture that the Donaldson and\nSeiberg-Witten series coincide, at least through terms of degree less than or\nequal to c-2, where c is a linear combination of the Euler characteristic and\nsignature of the four-manifold. This article is a revision of sections 1-3 of\nan earlier version of the article dg-ga/9712005, now split into two parts,\nwhile a revision of sections 4-7 of that earlier version appears in a recently\nupdated dg-ga/9712005. In the present article, we construct virtual normal\nbundles for the Seiberg-Witten strata of the moduli space of PU(2) monopoles\nand compute their Chern classes.\n", "  We prove Witten's formula relating the Donaldson and Seiberg-Witten series\nmodulo powers of degree $c+2$, with $c=-{1/4}(7\\chi+11\\sigma)$, for\nfour-manifolds obeying some mild conditions, where $\\chi$ and $\\sigma$ are\ntheir Euler characteristic and signature. We use the moduli space of SO(3)\nmonopoles as a cobordism between a link of the Donaldson moduli space of\nanti-self-dual SO(3) connections and links of the moduli spaces of\nSeiberg-Witten monopoles. Gluing techniques allow us to compute contributions\nfrom Seiberg-Witten moduli spaces lying in the first (or `one-bubble') level of\nthe Uhlenbeck compactification of the moduli space of SO(3) monopoles.\n", "  We prove that Witten's Conjecture [arXiv:hep-th/9411102] on the relationship\nbetween the Donaldson and Seiberg-Witten series for a four-manifold of\nSeiberg-Witten simple type with $b_1=0$ and odd $b_2^+\\geq 3$ follows from our\n$\\mathrm{SO}(3)$-monopole cobordism formula [arXiv:math/0203047] when the\nfour-manifold has $c_1^2\\geq \\chi_h-3$ or is abundant.\n", "  We prove that the moduli space of solutions to the PU(2) monopole equations\nis a smooth manifold of the expected dimension for simple, generic parameters\nsuch as (and including) the Riemannian metric on the given four-manifold. In a\nprevious article, dg-ga/9710032, we proved transversality using an extension of\nthe holonomy-perturbation methods of Donaldson, Floer, and Taubes, together\nwith the existence of an Uhlenbeck compactification for the perturbed moduli\nspace. However, it remained an important and interesting question to see\nwhether there were simpler, more intrinsic alternatives to the holonomy\nperturbations and this is the issue we settle here. The idea that PU(2)\nmonopoles might lead to a proof of Witten's conjecture (hep-th/9411102,\nhep-th/9709193) concerning the relation between the two types of four-manifold\ninvariants was first proposed by Pidstrigach and Tyurin in 1994\n(dg-ga/9507004): the space of PU(2) monopoles contains the moduli space of\nanti-self-dual connections together with copies of the various Seiberg-Witten\nmoduli spaces, these forming singular loci in the higher-dimensional space of\nPU(2) monopoles. Results in this direction, due to the author and Leness, are\nsurveyed in dg-ga/9709022, with a detailed account appearing in dg-ga/9712005.\nOur transversality theorem ensures that the anti-self-dual and Seiberg-Witten\nloci are the only singularities and that the PU(2) monopole moduli space forms\na smooth - though non-compact, because of bubbling - cobordism between the\nlinks of the singularities.\n", "  In this article we show that some of the recent results of Marino, Moore, and\nPeradze (math.DG/9812042, hep-th/9812055) -- in particular their conjecture\nthat all closed, smooth four-manifolds with b_2^+ > 1 (and Seiberg-Witten\nsimple type) are of `superconformal simple type' -- can be understood using a\nsimple mathematical argument via the PU(2)-monopole cobordism of Pidstrigach\nand Tyurin (dg-ga/9507004) and results of the first and third authors\n(dg-ga/9712005, dg-ga/9709022).\n", "  We show that harmonic spinors obey a strengthened version of the well-known\npointwise Kato inequality for sections of a vector bundle with a connection. We\nthen prove a decay estimate for eigenspinors using this Kato-Yau estimate and\nresulting differential inequality. We briefly describe some applications to\ngauge theory---specifically to integral estimates which are used when gluing\nand ungluing PU(2) monopoles (math.DG/9907107).\n"]}
