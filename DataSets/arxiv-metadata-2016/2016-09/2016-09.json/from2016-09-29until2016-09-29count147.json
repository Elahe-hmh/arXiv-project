The discrimination measurement on surface was limited by nuclear\nrecoils induced by cosmic-ray generated neutrons. This was improved by moving\nthe detector to the SNOLAB underground laboratory, where the reduced background\nrate allowed the same measurement with only a double-coincidence tag.\n  The combined data set contains $1.23\\times10^8$ events. One of those, in the\nunderground data set, is in the nuclear-recoil region of interest. Taking into\naccount the expected background of 0.48 events coming from random pileup, the\nresulting upper limit on the electronic recoil contamination is\n$<2.7\\times10^{-8}$ (90% C.L.) between 44-89 keVee and for a nuclear recoil\nacceptance of at least 90%, with 6% systematic uncertainty on the absolute\nenergy scale.\n  We developed a general mathematical framework to describe PSD parameter\ndistributions and used it to build an analytical model of the distributions\nobserved in DEAP-1. Using this model, we project a misidentification fraction\nof approx. $10^{-10}$ for an electron-equivalent energy threshold of 15 keV for\na detector with 8 PE/keVee light yield. This reduction enables a search for\nspin-independent scattering of WIMPs from 1000 kg of liquid argon with a\nWIMP-nucleon cross-section sensitivity of $10^{-46}$ cm$^2$, assuming\nnegligible contribution from nuclear recoil backgrounds.\n", "  In this paper, we present a new necessary and sufficient condition for which\nthe supremum exists with respect to the logic order. Moreover, we give out a\nnew and much simpler representation of the supremum with respect to the order,\nour results have nice physical meanings.\n", "  One noticed a numerical coincidence between the Pioneer spacecrafts\ndeceleration anomaly and $(\\gamma-1)$, with $\\gamma$ the Lorentz factor. The\nmatch is not only for distances larger than 20 AU, but even for the observed\nslop between 10 and 20 AU. Such numerical link may eventually lead to a\nscientific hypothesis for future theoretical investigations.\n", "  Nanomagnets with biaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy have four stable\nmagnetization orientations that can encode 4-state logic bits (00), (01), (11)\nand (10). Recently, a 4-state NOR gate derived from three such nanomagnets,\ninteracting via dipole interaction, was proposed. Here, we devise a Bennett\nclocking scheme to propagate 4-state logic bits unidirectionally between such\ngates. The nanomagnets are assumed to be made of 2-phase strain-coupled\nmagnetostrictive/piezoelectric multiferroic elements, such as nickel and lead\nzirconate titanate (PZT). A small voltage of 200 mV applied across the\npiezoelectric layer can generate enough mechanical stress in the\nmagnetostrictive layer to rotate its magnetization away from one of the four\nstable orientations and implement Bennett clocking. We show that a particular\nsequence of positive and negative voltages will propagate 4-state logic bits\nunidirectionally down a chain of such multiferroic nanomagnets for logic flow.\n", "  We identify a region of F(R)=R^{N} gravity without external sources which is\nisometric to the spacetime of colliding plane waves (CPW). From the derived\ncurvature sources, N (N>1) measures the strength (i.e. the charge) of the\nsource. The analogy renders construction and collision of plane waves in\nF(R)=R^{N} gravity possible, as in the Einstein-Maxwell (EM) theory, simply\nbecause R=0. A plane wave in this type of gravity is equivalent to a Weyl\ncurvature plus an electromagnetic energy-momentum-like term (i.e. 'source\nwithout source'). For N=1 we recover naturally the plane waves (and their\ncollision) in Einstein's theory. Our aim is to find the effect of an expanding\nuniverse by virtue of F(R)=R^{N} on the colliding gravitational plane waves of\nEinstein.\n", "  We present another explanation for the moon illusion, the phenomenon in which\nthe moon looks larger near the horizon than near the zenith. In our model of\nthe moon illusion, the sky is considered a spatially-contiguous and\ngeometrically-smooth surface. When an object such as the moon breaks the\ncontiguity of the surface, instead of perceiving the object as appearing\nthrough a hole in the surface, humans perceive an occlusion of the surface.\nBinocular vision dictates that the moon is distant, but this perception model\ncontradicts our binocular vision, dictating that the moon is closer than the\nsky. To resolve the contradiction, the brain distorts the projections of the\nmoon to increase the binocular disparity, which results in an increase in the\nperceived size of the moon. The degree of distortion depends upon the apparent\ndistance to the sky, which is influenced by the surrounding objects and the\ncondition of the sky. As the apparent distance to the sky decreases, the\nillusion becomes stronger. At the horizon, apparent distance to the sky is\nminimal, whereas at the zenith, few distance cues are present, causing\ndifficulty with distance estimation and weakening the illusion.\n", "  We investigate the spin texture of Andreev bound states and Majorana states\nin long SN junctions. We show that measuring the spin-polarized density of\nstates (SPDOS) allows one to identify the topological transition. In\nparticular, we find that its total component parallel to the wire is non-zero\nin the topological phase for the lowest-energy state, while vanishing in the\ntrivial one. Also, the component parallel to the Zeeman field is symmetric\nbetween positive and negative energies in the topological phase and asymmetric\nin the trivial phase. Moreover the SPDOS exhibits a moderate accumulation close\nto the SN boundary which changes sign when crossing the topological transition.\nWe propose that these signatures may allow one to unambiguously test the\nformation of a topological phase via spin-resolved transport and STM\nmeasurements.\n", "  Models of electroweak symmetry breaking with extended Higgs sectors are\ntheoretically well motivated. In this study, we focus on models with a low\nenergy spectrum containing a pair of charged scalars $H^\\pm$, as well as a\nlight scalar H and/or a pseudoscalar A. We study the $H^\\pm tb$ associated\nproduction with $H^\\pm \\to AW/HW$, which could reach sizable branching\nfractions in certain parameter regions. With detailed collider analysis, we\nobtain the exclusion bounds as well as discovery reach at the 14 TeV LHC for\nthe process $pp \\to H^\\pm tb \\to AW^\\pm tb/HW^\\pm tb \\to \\tau\\tau bbWW,\nbbbbWW$. We find that for a daughter particle mass of 70 GeV, the 95% C.L.\nexclusion reach in $\\sigma$xBR varies from about 60 fb to 25 fb, for\n$m_{H^\\pm}$ ranging from 150 GeV to 500 GeV with 300 fb$^{-1}$ integrated\nluminosity in the $\\tau\\tau$ mode. We further interpret these bounds in the\ncontext of Type II Two Higgs Doublet Model. The exclusion region in the\n$m_{H^\\pm}-\\tan\\beta$ plane can be extended to $m_{H^\\pm}=$ 600 GeV, while\ndiscovery is possible for $m_{H^\\pm}\\lesssim$ 400 GeV with 300 fb$^{-1}$\nintegrated luminosity. The exotic decay mode $H^\\pm \\to AW^\\pm/HW^\\pm$ offers a\ncomplementary channel to the conventional mode $H^\\pm \\to \\tau\\nu$ for charged\nHiggs searches.\n", "  We study the first eigenvalue of the $p-$Laplacian (with $1<p<\\infty$) on a\nquantum graph with Dirichlet or Kirchoff boundary conditions on the nodes. We\nfind lower and upper bounds for this eigenvalue when we prescribe the total sum\nof the lengths of the edges and the number of Dirichlet nodes of the graph.\nAlso we find a formula for the shape derivative of the first eigenvalue\n(assuming that it is simple) when we perturb the graph by changing the length\nof an edge. Finally, we study in detail the limit cases $p\\to \\infty$ and $p\\to\n1$.\n", "  We propose an efficient and accurate solver for the nonlocal potential in the\nDavey-Stewartson equation using nonuniform FFT (NUFFT). A discontinuity in the\nFourier transform of the nonlocal potential causes accuracy locking if the\npotential is solved by standard FFT with periodic boundary conditions on a\ntruncated domain. Using the fact that the discontinuity disappears in polar\ncoordinates, we reformulate the potential integral and split it into high and\nlow frequency parts. The high frequency part can be approximated by the\nstandard FFT method, while the low frequency part is evaluated with a high\norder Gauss quadrature accelerated by nonuniform FFT. The NUFFT solver has\n$O(N\\log N)$ complexity, where $N$ is the total number of discretization\npoints, and achieves higher accuracy than standard FFT solver, which makes it a\ngood alternative in simulation. Extensive numerical results show the efficiency\nand accuracy of the proposed method.\n", "  We test infinite-dimensional extension of algebra su(k,k) proposed by Fradkin\nand Linetsky as the candidate for conformal higher spin algebra. Adjoint and\ntwisted-adjoint representations of su(k,k) on the space of this algebra are\ncarefully explored. For k=2 corresponding unfolded system is analyzed and it is\nshown to encode Fradkin-Tseytlin equations for the set of all integer spins\n1,2,... with infinite multiplicity.\n", "  We adapt the L-Galaxies semi-analytic model to follow the star-formation\nhistories (SFH) of galaxies -- by which we mean a record of the formation time\nand metallicities of the stars that are present in each galaxy at a given time.\nWe use these to construct stellar spectra in post-processing, which offers\nlarge efficiency savings and allows user-defined spectral bands and dust models\nto be applied to data stored in the Millennium data repository.\n  We contrast model SFHs from the Millennium Simulation with observed ones from\nthe VESPA algorithm as applied to the SDSS-7 catalogue. The overall agreement\nis good, with both simulated and SDSS galaxies showing a steeper SFH with\nincreased stellar mass. The SFHs of blue and red galaxies, however, show poor\nagreement between data and simulations, which may indicate that the termination\nof star formation is too abrupt in the models.\n  The mean star-formation rate (SFR) of model galaxies is well-defined and is\naccurately modelled by a double power law at all redshifts: SFR proportional to\n$1/(x^{-1.39}+x^{1.33})$, where $x=(t_a-t)/3.0\\,$Gyr, $t$ is the age of the\nstars and $t_a$ is the loopback time to the onset of galaxy formation; above a\nredshift of unity, this is well approximated by a gamma function: SFR\nproportional to $x^{1.5}e^{-x}$, where $x=(t_a-t)/2.0\\,$Gyr. Individual\ngalaxies, however, show a wide dispersion about this mean. When split by mass,\nthe SFR peaks earlier for high-mass galaxies than for lower-mass ones, and we\ninterpret this downsizing as a mass-dependence in the evolution of the quenched\nfraction: the SFHs of star-forming galaxies show only a weak mass dependence.\n", "  Organic matter and hydrous silicates are intimately mixed in the matrix of\nchondrites and in-situ determination of their individual D/H ratios is\ntherefore challenging. Nevertheless, the D/H ratio of each pure component in\nthis mixture should yield a comprehensible signature of the origin and\nevolution of water and organic matter in our solar system. We measured hydrogen\nisotope ratios of organic and hydrous silicates in the matrices of two\ncarbonaceous chondrites (Orgueil CI1 and Renazzo CR2) and one unequilibrated\nordinary chondrite (Semarkona, LL3.0). A novel protocol was adopted, involving\nNanoSIMS imaging of H isotopes of monoatomatic ($H^-$) and molecular ($OH^-$)\nsecondary ions collected at the same location. This allowed the most enriched\ncomponent with respect to D to be identified in the mixture. Using this\nprotocol, we found that in carbonaceous chondrites the isotopically homogeneous\nhydrous silicates are mixed with D-rich organic matter. The opposite was\nobserved in Semarkona. Hydrous silicates in Semarkona display highly\nheterogeneous D/H ratios, ranging from $150$ to $1800$ ${\\times}$ $10^{-6}$\n(${\\delta}D_{SMOW} = -40$ to $10,600$ permil). Organic matter in Semarkona does\nnot show such large isotopic variations. This suggests limited isotopic\nexchange between the two phases during aqueous alteration. Our study greatly\nexpands the range of water isotopic values measured so far in solar system\nobjects. This D-rich water reservoir was sampled by the LL ordinary chondrite\nparent body and an estimate (up to 9 %) of its relative contribution to the D/H\nratio of water in Oort cloud family comets is proposed.\n", "  We study the time-dependent Bogoliubov--de-Gennes equations for generic\ntranslation-invariant fermionic many-body systems. For initial states that are\nclose to thermal equilibrium states at temperatures near the critical\ntemperature, we show that the magnitude of the order parameter stays\napproximately constant in time and, in particular, does not follow a\ntime-dependent Ginzburg--Landau equation, which is often employed as a\nphenomenological description and predicts a decay of the order parameter in\ntime. The full non-linear structure of the equations is necessary to understand\nthis behavior.\n", "  While current ATLAS and CMS measurements exclude a light charged Higgs\n($m_{H^\\pm}<160$ GeV) for most of the parameter region in the context of the\nMSSM scenarios, these bounds are significantly weakened in the Type II 2HDM\nonce the exotic decay channel into a lighter neutral Higgs, $H^\\pm \\to AW/HW$,\nis open. In this study, we examine the possibility of a light charged Higgs\nproduced in top decay via single top or top pair production, with the\nsubsequent decay $H^\\pm \\rightarrow AW/HW$, which can reach a sizable branching\nfraction at low $\\tan\\beta$ once it is kinematically permitted. With a detailed\ncollider analysis, we obtain exclusion and discovery bounds for the 14 TeV LHC\nassuming the existence of a 70 GeV neutral scalar. Assuming ${\\rm BR}(H^\\pm\n\\rightarrow AW/HW)=100\\%$ and ${\\rm BR}(A/H \\rightarrow \\tau\\tau)=8.6\\%$, the\n95% exclusion limits on ${\\rm BR}(t \\rightarrow H^+ b)$ are about 0.2% and\n0.03% for single top and top pair production respectively, with an integrated\nluminosity of 300 ${\\rm fb}^{-1}$. The discovery reaches are about 3 times\nhigher. In the context of the Type II 2HDM, discovery is possible at both large\n$\\tan\\beta > 17$ for 155 GeV $< m_{H^\\pm} <$ 165 GeV, and small $\\tan\\beta < 6$\nover the entire mass range. Exclusion is possible in the entire $\\tan\\beta$\nversus $m_{H^\\pm}$ plane except for charged Higgs masses close to the top\nthreshold. The exotic decay channel $H^\\pm \\to AW/HW$ is therefore\ncomplementary to the conventional $H^\\pm \\rightarrow \\tau\\nu$ channel.\n", "  The recently observed excess in gamma-ray signal near the Galactic center\nsuggests that dark matter particles may annihilate into charged fermions that\nproduce gamma-ray to be observed. In this paper, we consider a leptonic dark\nmatter, which annihilates into the standard model leptons, $\\mu^+ \\mu^-$ and\n$\\tau^+ \\tau^-$, by the interaction of the gauged lepton number ${\\rm\nU(1)}_{L_\\mu-L_\\tau}$ and fits the observed excess. Interestingly, the\nnecessary annihilation cross section for the observed gamma-ray flux provides a\ngood fit to the value for the relic abundance of dark matter. We identify the\npreferred parameter space of the model after taking the existing experimental\nconstraints from the precision measurements including the muon $(g-2)$, tau\ndecay, neutrino trident production, dark matter direct detection, LHC, and LEP\nexperiments.\n", "  We consider the non-equilibrium physics induced by joining together two tight\nbinding fermionic chains to form a single chain. Before being joined, each\nchain is in a many-fermion ground state. The fillings (densities) in the two\nchains might be the same or different. We present a number of exact results for\nthe correlation functions in the non-interacting case. We present a short-time\nexpansion, which can sometimes be fully resummed, and which reproduces the\nso-called `light cone' effect or wavefront behavior of the correlators. For\nlarge times, we show how all interesting physical regimes may be obtained by\nstationary phase approximation techniques. In particular, we derive\nsemiclassical formulas in the case when both time and positions are large, and\nshow that these are exact in the thermodynamic limit. We present subleading\ncorrections to the large-time behavior, including the corrections near the\nedges of the wavefront. We also provide results for the return probability or\nLoschmidt echo. In the maximally inhomogeneous limit, we prove that it is\nexactly gaussian at all times. The effects of interactions on the Loschmidt\necho are also discussed.\n", "  We present a method to compute the inverse scattering transform (IST) for the\nfamed Toda lattice by solving the associated Riemann--Hilbert (RH) problem\nnumerically. Deformations for the RH problem are incorporated so that the IST\ncan be evaluated in $\\mathcal O(1)$ operations for arbitrary points in the\n$(n,t)$-domain, including short- and long-time regimes. No time-stepping is\nrequired to compute the solution because $(n,t)$ appear as parameters in the\nassociated RH problem. The solution of the Toda lattice is computed in\nlong-time asymptotic regions where the asymptotics are not known rigorously.\n", "  We present a phenomenological treatment of diffusion-driven martensitic phase\ntransformations in multi-component crystalline solids that arise from\nnon-convex free energies in mechanical and chemical variables. The treatment\ndescribes diffusional phase transformations that are accompanied by symmetry\nbreaking structural changes of the crystal unit cell and reveals the importance\nof a mechano-chemical spinodal, defined as the region in strain-composition\nspace where the free energy density function is non-convex. The approach is\nrelevant to phase transformations wherein the structural order parameters can\nbe expressed as linear combinations of strains relative to a high-symmetry\nreference crystal. The governing equations describing mechano-chemical spinodal\ndecomposition are variationally derived from a free energy density function\nthat accounts for interfacial energy via gradients of the rapidly varying\nstrain and composition fields. A robust computational framework for treating\nthe coupled, higher order diffusion and nonlinear strain gradient elasticity\nproblems is presented. Because the local strains in an inhomogeneous,\ntransforming microstructure can be finite, the elasticity problem must account\nfor geometric nonlinearity. An evaluation of available experimental phase\ndiagrams and first-principles free energies suggests mechano-chemical spinodal\ndecomposition should occur in metal hydrides such as ZrH$_{2-2c}$. The rich\nphysics that ensues is explored in several numerical examples in two and three\ndimensions and the relevance of the mechanism is discussed in the context of\nimportant electrode materials for Li-ion batteries and high temperature\nceramics.\n", "  We solve a multi-period portfolio optimization problem using D-Wave Systems'\nquantum annealer. We derive a formulation of the problem, discuss several\npossible integer encoding schemes, and present numerical examples that show\nhigh success rates. The formulation incorporates transaction costs (including\npermanent and temporary market impact), and, significantly, the solution does\nnot require the inversion of a covariance matrix. The discrete multi-period\nportfolio optimization problem we solve is significantly harder than the\ncontinuous variable problem. We present insight into how results may be\nimproved using suitable software enhancements, and why current quantum\nannealing technology limits the size of problem that can be successfully solved\ntoday. The formulation presented is specifically designed to be scalable, with\nthe expectation that as quantum annealing technology improves, larger problems\nwill be solvable using the same techniques.\n", "  We construct explicit examples of spontaneous energy generation and\nnon-uniqueness for the compressible Euler system, with and without pressure, by\ntaking limits of Hamiltonian dynamics as the number of molecules increases to\ninfinity. The examples come from rescalings of well-posed, deterministic\nsystems of molecules that either collide elastically or interact via singular\npair potentials.\n", "  One-way quantum computing is experimentally appealing because it requires\nonly local measurements on an entangled resource called a cluster state.\nRecord-size, but non-universal, continuous-variable cluster states were\nrecently demonstrated separately in the time and frequency domains. We propose\nto combine these approaches into a scalable architecture in which a single\noptical parametric oscillator and simple interferometer entangle up to\n($3\\times 10^3$ frequencies) $\\times$ (unlimited number of temporal modes) into\na new and computationally universal continuous-variable cluster state. We\nintroduce a generalized measurement protocol to enable improved computational\nperformance on this new entanglement resource.\n", "  A microscopic expression of the residual electrical resistivity tensor is\nderived in linear response theory for Rashba electrons scattering at a magnetic\nimpurity with cylindrical or non-cylindrical potential. The behavior of the\nlongitudinal and transversal residual resistivity is computed for an Fe\nimpurity at the Au(111) surface. We studied the evolution of the resistivity\ntensor elements as function of the Rashba spin-orbit strength and the\nmagnetization direction of the impurity. We found that the absolute values of\nlongitudinal resistivity reduces with increasing spin-orbit strength of the\nsubstrate and that the scattering of the conduction electrons at magnetic\nimpurities with magnetic moments pointing in directions not perpendicular to\nthe surface plane produce a planar Hall effect and an anisotropic\nmagnetoresistance even if the impurity carries no spin-orbit interaction.\nFunctional forms are provided describing the anisotropy of the planar Hall\neffect and the anisotropic magnetoresistance with respect to the direction of\nthe impurity moment. In the limit of no spin-orbit interaction and a\nnon-magnetic impurity of cylindrical symmetry, the expression of the residual\nresistivity of a two-dimensional electron-gas has the same simplicity and form\nas for the three-dimensional electron gas [J. Friedel, NuovoCimento Suppl. 7,\n287 (1958)] and can also be expressed in terms of scattering phase shifts.\n", "  The production rates of heavy quarkonia in ion-ion collisions provide\nsensitive probes in the studies of the hot and dense matter formed in these\ncollisions at high energies. However, a reference for understanding the\nbehavior in the hot medium is necessary; p-A collisions open the possibility to\nstudy heavy quarkonia states in a smaller system of much lower average\ntemperature. This is an important step in forming a baseline for understanding\nA-A collisions, as well as an investigation into the nature of modifications of\nthe parton distributions in the nucleus. Using data collected at the LHC in\n2013, we show results on the prompt J/{\\Psi} and {\\Psi}(2S) nuclear\nmodification factors and the double ratio, {\\Psi}(2S) divided by J/{\\Psi} in\np-Pb divided by the same in p-p, in p-Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV. The charmonia\nstates were reconstructed via the dimuon decay channel and the yield is\nanalyzed differentially in bins of transverse momentum, rapidity, and event\nactivity.\n", "  Strategies incorporating direct reciprocity, e.g., Tit-for-Tat and Pavlov,\nhave been shown to be successful for playing the Iterated Prisoners Dilemma\n(IPD), a paradigmatic problem for studying the evolution of cooperation among\nnon-kin individuals. However it is an open question whether such reciprocal\nstrategies can emerge as the rational outcome of repeated interactions between\nselfish agents. Here we show that adopting a co-action perspective, which takes\ninto account the symmetry between agents - a relevant consideration in\nbiological and social contexts - naturally leads to such a strategy. For a\n2-player IPD, we show that the co-action solution corresponds to the Pavlov\nstrategy, thereby providing a rational basis for it. For an IPD involving many\nplayers, an instance of the Public Goods game where cooperation is generally\nconsidered to be harder to achieve, we show that the cooperators always\noutnumber defectors in the co-action equilibrium. This can be seen as a\ngeneralization of Pavlov to contests involving many players. In general,\nrepeated interactions allow rational agents to become aware of the inherent\nsymmetry of their situation, enabling them to achieve robust cooperation\nthrough co-action strategies - which, in the case of IPD, is a reciprocal\nPavlovian one.\n", "  Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering is a form of quantum nonlocality which\nis intermediate between entanglement and Bell nonlocality. EPR steering is a\nresource for quantum key distribution that is device independent on only one\nside in that it certifies bipartite entanglement when one party's device is not\ncharacterized while the other party's device is fully characterized. In this\nwork, we introduce two types of genuine tripartite EPR-steering, and derive two\nsteering inequalities to detect them. In a semi-device-independent scenario\nwhere only the dimensions of two parties are assumed, the correlations which\nviolate one of these inequalities also certify genuine tripartite entanglement.\nIt is known that Alice can demonstrate bipartite EPR-steering to Bob if and\nonly if her measurement settings are incompatible. We demonstrate that quantum\ncorrelations can also detect tripartite EPR-steering from Alice to Bob and\nCharlie, even if Charlie's measurement settings are compatible.\n", "  We review recent results concerning the mathematical properties of the\nBardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) functional of superconductivity, which were\nobtained in a series of papers partly in collaboration with R. Frank, E. Hamza,\nS. Naboko, and J.P. Solovej. Our discussion includes, in particular, an\ninvestigation of the critical temperature for a general class of interaction\npotentials, as well as a study of its dependence on external fields. We shall\nexplain how the Ginzburg-Landau model can be derived from the BCS theory in a\nsuitable parameter regime.\n", "  In this paper we introduce the concept of decorated character variety for the\nRiemann surfaces arising in the theory of the Painlev\\'e differential\nequations. Since all Painlev\\'e differential equations (apart from the sixth\none) exhibit Stokes phenomenon, it is natural to consider Riemann spheres with\nholes and bordered cusps on such holes. The decorated character is defined as\ncomplexification of the bordered cusped Teichm\\\"uller space introduced in\narXiv:1509.07044. We show that the decorated character variety of a Riemann\nsphere with s holes and n>1 bordered cusps is a Poisson manifold of dimension 3\ns+ 2 n-6 and we explicitly compute the Poisson brackets which are naturally of\ncluster type. We also show how to obtain the confluence procedure of the\nPainlev\\'e differential equations in geometric terms.\n", "  We consider the Bogolubov-Hartree-Fock functional for a fermionic many-body\nsystem with two-body interactions. For suitable interaction potentials that\nhave a strong enough attractive tail in order to allow for two-body bound\nstates, but are otherwise sufficiently repulsive to guarantee stability of the\nsystem, we show that in the low-density limit the ground state of this model\nconsists of a Bose-Einstein condensate of fermion pairs. The latter can be\ndescribed by means of the Gross-Pitaevskii energy functional.\n", "  We present accurate ab initio and quantum scattering calculations on a\nprototypical hybrid ion-atom system Yb$^+$-Rb, recently suggested as a\npromising candidate for the experimental study of open quantum systems, quantum\ninformation processing, and quantum simulation. We identify the second-oder\nspin-orbit (SO) interaction as the dominant source of hyperfine relaxation and\ndecoherence in cold Yb$^+$-Rb collisions. Our results are in good agreement\nwith recent experimental observations [L. Ratschbacher et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.\n110, 160402 (2013)] of hyperfine relaxation rates of trapped Yb$^+$ immersed in\nan ultracold Rb gas. The calculated rates are 4 times smaller than predicted by\nthe Langevin capture theory and display a weak $T^{-0.3}$ temperature\ndependence, indicating significant deviations from statistical behavior. Our\nanalysis underscores the deleterious nature of the SO interaction and implies\nthat light ion-atom combinations such as Yb$^+$-Li should be used to minimize\nhyperfine relaxation and decoherence of trapped ions in ultracold atomic gases.\n", "  In this paper, we provide the two-body exact solutions of two dimensional\n(2D) Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation with isotropic $\\pm 1/r^3$ interactions. Analytic\nquantum defect theory are constructed base on these solutions and are applied\nto investigate the scattering properties as well as two-body bound states of\nultracold polar molecules confined in a quasi-2D geometry. Interestingly, we\nfind that for the attractive case, the scattering resonance happens\nsimultaneously in all partial waves which has not been observed in other\nsystems. The effect of this feature on the scattering phase shift across such\nresonances is also illustrated.\n", "  We analyze deterministic and random temporal variations in dispersion measure\n(DM) from the full three-dimensional velocities of pulsars with respect to the\nsolar system, combined with electron-density variations on a wide range of\nlength scales. Previous treatments have largely ignored the pulsar's changing\ndistance while favoring interpretations involving the change in sky position\nfrom transverse motion. Linear trends in pulsar DMs seen over 5-10~year\ntimescales may signify sizable DM gradients in the interstellar medium (ISM)\nsampled by the changing direction of the line of sight to the pulsar. We show\nthat motions parallel to the line of sight can also account for linear trends,\nfor the apparent excess of DM variance over that extrapolated from\nscintillation measurements, and for the apparent non-Kolmogorov scalings of DM\nstructure functions inferred in some cases. Pulsar motions through atomic gas\nmay produce bow-shock ionized gas that also contributes to DM variations. We\ndiscuss possible causes of periodic or quasi-periodic changes in DM, including\nseasonal changes in the ionosphere, annual variation of the solar elongation\nangle, structure in the heliosphere-ISM boundary, and substructure in the ISM.\nWe assess the solar cycle's role on the amplitude of ionospheric and solar-wind\nvariations. Interstellar refraction can produce cyclic timing variations from\nthe error in transforming arrival times to the solar system barycenter. We\napply our methods to DM time series and DM gradient measurements in the\nliterature and assess consistency with a Kolmogorov medium. Finally, we discuss\nthe implications of DM modeling in precision pulsar timing experiments.\n", "  An infinite class of analytic AdS_7 x S^3 solutions has recently been found.\nThe S^3 is distorted into a \"crescent roll\" shape by the presence of D8-branes.\nThese solutions are conjectured to be dual to a class of \"linear quivers\", with\na large number of gauge groups coupled to (bi-)fundamental matter and tensor\nfields. In this paper we perform a precise quantitative check of this\ncorrespondence, showing that the a Weyl anomalies computed in field theory and\ngravity agree. In the holographic limit, where the number of gauge groups is\nlarge, the field theory result is a quadratic form in the gauge group ranks\ninvolving the inverse of the A_N Cartan matrix C. The agreement can be\nunderstood as a continuum limit, using the fact that C is a lattice analogue of\na second derivative. The discrete data of the field theory, summarized by two\npartitions, become in this limit the continuous functions in the geometry.\nConversely, the geometry of the internal space gets discretized at the quantum\nlevel to the discrete data of the two partitions.\n", "  We use the macroscopic fluctuation theory to determine the statistics of\nlarge currents in the Kipnis-Marchioro-Presutti (KMP) model in a ring geometry.\nAbout 10 years ago this simple setting was instrumental in identifying a\nbreakdown of the additivity principle in a class of lattice gases at currents\nexceeding a critical value. Building on earlier work, we assume that, for\nsupercritical currents, the optimal density profile, conditioned on the given\ncurrent, has the form of a traveling wave (TW). For the KMP model we find this\nTW analytically, in terms of elliptic functions, for any supercritical current\n$I$. Using this TW solution, we evaluate, up to a pre-exponential factor, the\nprobability distribution $P(I)$. We obtain simple asymptotics of the TW and of\n$P(I)$ for currents close to the critical current, and for currents much larger\nthan the critical current. In the latter case we show that $-\\ln P (I) \\sim\nI\\ln I$, whereas the optimal density profile acquires a soliton-like shape. Our\nanalytic results are in a very good agreement with Monte-Carlo simulations and\nnumerical solutions of Hurtado and Garrido (2011).\n", "  With continuous advances in technology, future satellite gradiometry missions\nwill be capable of performing precision relativistic experiments and imposing\nconstraints on modern gravity theories. To this end, the full first-order\npost-Newtonian tidal tensor under inertially guided and Earth-pointing local\nframes along post-Newtonian orbits is worked out. The physical picture behind\nthe \"Mashhoon-Theiss anomaly\" is explained at the post-Newtonian level. The\nrelativistic precession of the local frame with respect to the sidereal frame\nwill produce modulations of Newtonian tidal forces along certain bases, which\ngives rise to two different kinds of secular tidal tensors. The measurements of\nthe secular tidal force from the frame-dragging effect is also discussed.\n", "  Trapping of microparticles and aerosols is of great interest for physics and\nchemistry. We report microparticle trapping in multipole linear Paul trap\ngeometries, operating under Standard Ambient Temperature and Pressure (SATP)\nconditions. An 8-electrode and a 12-electrode linear trap geometries have been\ndesigned and tested with an aim to achieve trapping for larger number of\nparticles and to study microparticle dynamical stability in electrodynamic\nfields. We report emergence of planar and volume ordered structures of the\nmicroparticles, depending on the a.c. trapping frequency and particle specific\ncharge ratio. The electric potential within the trap was mapped using the\nelectrolytic tank method. Particle dynamics was simulated using a stochastic\nLangevin equation. We emphasize extended regions of stable trapping with\nrespect to quadrupole traps, as well as good agreement between experiment and\nnumerical simulations.\n", "  Many experiments have searched for supersymmetric WIMP dark matter, with null\nresults. This may suggest to look for more exotic possibilities, for example\ncompact ultra-dense quark nuggets, widely discussed in literature with several\ndifferent names. Nuclearites are an example of candidate compact objects with\natomic size cross section. After a short discussion on nuclearites, the result\nof a nuclearite search with the gravitational wave bar detectors Nautilus and\nExplorer is reported. The geometrical acceptance of the bar detectors is 19.5\n$\\rm m^2$ sr, that is smaller than that of other detectors used for similar\nsearches. However, the detection mechanism is completely different and is more\nstraightforward than in other detectors. The experimental limits we obtain are\nof interest because, for nuclearites of mass less than $10^{-5}$ g, we find a\nflux smaller than that one predicted considering nuclearites as dark matter\ncandidates. Particles with gravitational only interactions (newtorites) are\nanother example. In this case the sensitivity is quite poor and a short\ndiscussion is reported on possible improvements.\n", "  The use of pulsars as astrophysical clocks for gravitational wave experiments\ndemands the highest possible timing precision. Pulse times of arrival (TOAs)\nare limited by stochastic processes that occur in the pulsar itself, along the\nline of sight through the interstellar medium, and in the measurement process.\nOn timescales of seconds to hours, the TOA variance exceeds that from\ntemplate-fitting errors due to additive noise. We assess contributions to the\ntotal variance from two additional effects: amplitude and phase jitter\nintrinsic to single pulses and changes in the interstellar impulse response\nfrom scattering. The three effects have different dependencies on time,\nfrequency, and pulse signal-to-noise ratio. We use data on 37 pulsars from the\nNorth American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves to assess the\nindividual contributions to the overall intraday noise budget for each pulsar.\nWe detect jitter in 22 pulsars and estimate the average value of RMS jitter in\nour pulsars to be $\\sim 1\\%$ of pulse phase. We examine how jitter evolves as a\nfunction of frequency and find evidence for evolution. Finally, we compare our\nmeasurements with previous noise parameter estimates and discuss methods to\nimprove gravitational wave detection pipelines.\n", "  We investigate the thermodynamics of Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole in\nthe context of the generalized uncertainty principle. The corrections to the\nHawking temperature, entropy and the heat capacity are obtained via the\nmodified Hamilton-Jacobi equation. These modifications show that the GUP\nchanges the evolution of Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole. Specially, the\nGUP effect becomes susceptible when the radius or mass of black hole approach\nto the order of Planck scale, it stops radiating and leads to black hole\nremnant. Meanwhile, the Planck scale remnant can be confirmed through the\nanalysis of the heat capacity. Those phenomenons imply that the GUP may give a\nway to solve the information paradox. Besides, we also investigate the\npossibilities to observe the black hole at LHC, the results demonstrate that\nthe black hole can not be produced in the recent LHC.\n", "  The recently introduced concept of dynamic communicability is a valuable tool\nfor ranking the importance of nodes in a temporal network. Two metrics,\nbroadcast score and receive score, were introduced to measure the centrality of\na node with respect to a model of contagion based on time-respecting walks.\nThis article examines the temporal and structural factors influencing these\nmetrics by considering a versatile stochastic temporal network model. We\nanalytically derive formulae to accurately predict the expectation of the\nbroadcast and receive scores when one or more columns in a temporal edge-list\nare shuffled. These methods are then applied to two publicly available\ndata-sets and we quantify how much the centrality of each individual depends on\nstructural or temporal influences. From our analysis we highlight two practical\ncontributions: a way to control for temporal variation when computing dynamic\ncommunicability, and the conclusion that the broadcast and receive scores can,\nunder a range of circumstances, be replaced by the row and column sums of the\nmatrix exponential of a weighted adjacency matrix given by the data.\n", "  The Fermi-Hubbard model is one of the key models of condensed matter physics,\nwhich holds a potential for explaining the mystery of high-temperature\nsuperconductivity. Recent progress in ultracold atoms in optical lattices has\npaved the way to studying the model's phase diagram using the tools of quantum\nsimulation, which emerged as a promising alternative to the numerical\ncalculations plagued by the infamous sign problem. However, the temperatures\nachieved using elaborate laser cooling protocols so far have been too high to\nshow the appearance of antiferromagnetic and superconducting quantum phases\ndirectly. In this work, we demonstrate that using the machinery of dissipative\nquantum state engineering, one can efficiently prepare antiferromagnetic order\nin present-day experiments with ultracold fermions. The core of the approach is\nto add incoherent laser scattering in such a way that the antiferromagnetic\nstate emerges as the dark state of the driven-dissipative dynamics. In order to\nelucidate the development of the antiferromagnetic order we employ two\ncomplementary techniques: Monte Carlo wave function simulations for small\nsystems and a recently proposed variational method for open quantum systems,\noperating in the thermodynamic limit. The controlled dissipation channels\ndescribed in this work are straightforward to add to already existing\nexperimental setups.\n", "  We build ring resonators to assess the potentialities of Kagome Hollow-Core\nPhotonic Crystal Fibers for future applications to resonant rotation sensing.\nThe large mode diameter of Kagome fibers permits to reduce the free space\nfiber-to-fiber coupling losses, leading to cavities with finesses of about 30\nfor a diameter equal to 15 cm. Resonance linewidths of 3.2~MHz with contrasts\nas large as 89\\% are obtained. Comparison with 7-cell photonic band gap (PBG)\nfiber leads to better finesse and contrast with Kagome fiber. Resonators based\non such fibers are compatible with the angular random walk required for medium\nto high performance rotation sensing. The small amount of light propagating in\nsilica should also permit to further reduce the Kerr-induced non-reciprocity by\nat least three orders of magnitudes in 7-cell Kagome fiber compared with 7-cell\nPBG fiber.\n", "  Preparing highly entangled quantum states between remote parties is a major\nchallenge for quantum communications [1-8]. Particularly promising in this\ncontext are the N00N states, which are entangled N-photon wavepackets\ndelocalized between two different locations, providing measurement sensitivity\nlimited only by the uncertainty principle [1, 10-15]. However, these states are\nnotoriously vulnerable to losses, making it difficult both to share them\nbetween remote locations, and to recombine them to exploit interference\neffects. Here we address this challenge by utilizing the reverse version of the\nHong-Ou-Mandel effect [16] to prepare a high-fidelity two-photon N00N state\nshared between two parties connected by a lossy optical channel. Furthermore,\nwe demonstrate that the enhanced phase sensitivity can be directly exploited in\nthe two distant locations, and we remotely prepare superpositions of coherent\nstates, known as Schr\\\"odinger's cat states\" [17, 18].\n", "  Consider a one-dimensional branching Brownian motion, and rescale the\ncoordinate and time so that the rates of branching and diffusion are both equal\nto $1$. If $X_1(t)$ is the position of the rightmost particle of the branching\nBrownian motion at time $t$, the empirical velocity $c$ of this rightmost\nparticle is defined as $c=X_1(t)/t$. Using the Fisher-KPP equation, we evaluate\nthe probability distribution ${\\mathcal P(c,t)}$ of this empirical velocity $c$\nin the long time $t$ limit for $c > 2$. It was already known that, for a single\nseed particle, ${\\mathcal P(c,t)} \\sim \\exp \\,[-(c^2/4-1)t]$ up to a prefactor\nthat can depend on $c$ and $t$. Here we show how to determine this prefactor.\nThe result can be easily generalized to the case of multiple seed particles and\nto branching random walks associated to other traveling wave equations.\n", "  We present how a neutrino condensate and small neutrino masses emerge from a\ntopological formulation of gravitational anomaly. We first recapitulate how a\ngravitational $\\theta$-term leads to the emergence of a new bound neutrino\nstate analogous to the $\\eta'$ meson of QCD. Then we show the consequent\nformation of a neutrino vacuum condensate, which effectively generates small\nneutrino masses. Afterwards we outline several phenomenological consequences of\nour neutrino mass generation model. The cosmological neutrino mass bound\nvanishes since we predict the neutrinos to be massless until the phase\ntransition in the late Universe, $T\\sim {\\rm meV}$. Deviations from an equal\nflavor rate due to enhanced neutrino decays in extraterrestrial neutrino fluxes\ncan be observed in future IceCube data. The current cosmological neutrino\nbackground only consists of the lightest neutrinos, which, due to enhanced\nneutrino-neutrino interactions, either bind up, form a superfluid, or\ncompletely annihilate into massless bosons. Strongly coupled relic neutrinos\ncould provide a contribution to cold dark matter in the late Universe, together\nwith the new proposed particles and topological defects, which may have formed\nduring neutrino condensation. These enhanced interactions could also be a\nsource of relic neutrino clustering in our Galaxy, which possibly makes the\noverdense cosmic neutrino background detectable in the KATRIN experiment. The\nneutrino condensate provides a mass for the hypothetical $B-L$ gauge boson,\nleading to a gravity-competing force detectable in short-distance measurements.\nGravitational waves detections have the potential to probe our neutrino mass\ngeneration mechanism.\n", "  In this paper, the following scenario is considered: there are two qubits\npossessed by two parties at different locations. Qubits have been prepared in\none of a maximum of four, mutually-orthogonal, entangled states and the parties\nwish to distinguish between the states by using local operations and classical\ncommunication. Although in general it is not possible to distinguish between\nfour arbitrary states, the parties can spend some pre-shared entanglement to\nachieve perfect discrimination between four qubit states and can also preserve\nthe entanglement of the states after discrimination. This is shown by employing\nthe theory of majorization and the connections between entanglement\ntransformations and state discrimination protocols.\n", "  We investigate the appearance of di-neutron bound states in pure neutron\nmatter within the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock approach at zero temperature. We\nconsider Argonne $v_{18}$ and Paris bare interactions as well as chiral two-\nand three-nucleon forces. Self-consistent single-particle potentials are\ncalculated controlling explicitly singularities in the $g$ matrix associated\nwith bound states. Di-neutrons are loosely bound, with binding energies below\n$1$ MeV, but are unambiguously present for Fermi momenta below $1$ fm$^{-1}$\nfor all interactions. Within the same framework we are able to calculate and\ncharacterize di-neutron bound states, obtaining mean radii as high as $\\sim\n110$ fm. The resulting equations of state and mass-radius relations for pure\nneutron stars are analyzed including di-neutron contributions.\n", "  We study effective light-matter interactions in a circuit QED system\nconsisting of a single $LC$ resonator, which is coupled symmetrically to\nmultiple superconducting qubits. Starting from a minimal circuit model, we\ndemonstrate that in addition to the usual collective qubit-photon coupling the\nresulting Hamiltonian contains direct qubit-qubit interactions, which have a\ndrastic effect on the ground and excited state properties of such circuits in\nthe ultrastrong coupling regime. In contrast to a superradiant phase transition\nexpected from the standard Dicke model, we find an opposite mechanism, which at\nvery strong interactions completely decouples the photon mode and projects the\nqubits into a highly entangled ground state. These findings resolve previous\ncontroversies over the existence of superradiant phases in circuit QED, but\nthey more generally show that the physics of two- or multi-atom cavity QED\nsettings can differ significantly from what is commonly assumed.\n", "  An integrated approach to Lie derivatives of spinors, spinor connections and\nthe gravitational field is presented, in the context of a previously proposed,\npartly original formulation of a theory of Einstein-Carta-Maxwell-Dirac fields\nbased on \"minimal geometric data\": all the needed underlying structure is\ngeometrically constructed from the unique assumption of a complex vector field\n$S\\to M$ with 2-dimensional fibers. The Lie derivatives of objects of all\nconsidered types, with respect to a vector field $X:M\\to TM$, are well-defined\nwithout making any special assumption about $X$, and fulfill natural mutual\nrelations.\n", "  Memoryless time evolutions are ubiquitous in nature but often correspond to a\nresolution-induced approximation, i.e. there are correlations in time whose\neffects are undetectable. Recent advances in the dynamical control of small\nquantum systems provide the ideal scenario to probe some of these effects. Here\nwe experimentally demonstrate the precise induction of memory effects on the\nevolution of a quantum coin (qubit) by correlations engineered in its\nenvironment. In particular, we design a collisional model in Nuclear Magnetic\nResonance (NMR) and precisely control the strength of the effects by changing\nthe degree of correlation in the environment and its time of interaction with\nthe qubit. We also show how these effects can be hidden by the limited\nresolution of the measurements performed on the qubit. The experiment\nreinforces NMR as a test bed for the study of open quantum systems and the\nsimulation of their classical counterparts.\n", "  We investigate the superfluid properties of two-dimensional driven Bose\nliquids, such as polariton condensates, using their long-wavelength description\nin terms of a compact Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation for the phase\ndynamics. We account for topological defects (vortices) in the phase field\nthrough a duality mapping between the compact KPZ equation and a theory of\nnon-linear electrodynamics coupled to charges. Using the dual theory we derive\nrenormalization group equations that describe vortex unbinding in these media.\nWhen the non-equilibirum drive is turned off, the KPZ non-linearity {\\lambda}\nvanishes and the RG flow gives the usual Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) transition.\nOn the other hand, with non-linearity {\\lambda} > 0 vortices always unbind,\neven if the same system with {\\lambda} = 0 is superfluid. We predict the finite\nsize scaling behavior of the superfluid stiffness in the crossover governed by\nvortex unbinding showing its clear distinction from the scaling associated with\nthe KT transition.\n", "  A comprehensive theory of the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in\ntwo-dimensional superfluids in thermal equilibrium can be developed within a\ndual representation which maps vortices in the superfluid to charges in a\nCoulomb gas. In this framework, the dissociation of vortex-antivortex pairs at\nthe critical temperature corresponds to the formation of a plasma of free\ncharges. The physics of vortex unbinding in driven-dissipative systems such as\nfluids of light, on the other hand, is much less understood. Here we make a\ncrucial step to fill this gap by deriving a transformation that maps the\ncompact Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation, which describes the dynamics of the\nphase of a driven-dissipative condensate, to a dual electrodynamic theory. The\nlatter is formulated in terms of modified Maxwell equations for the\nelectromagnetic fields and a diffusion equation for the charges representing\nvortices in the KPZ equation. This mapping utilizes an adaption of the Villain\napproximation to a generalized Martin-Siggia-Rose functional integral\nrepresentation of the compact KPZ equation on a lattice.\n", "  We study the effects of strain on the properties and dynamics of Wannier\nexcitons in monolayer (phosphorene) and few-layer black phosphorus (BP), a\npromising two-dimensional material for optoelectronic applications due to its\nhigh mobility, mechanical strength and strain-tuneable direct band gap. We\ncompare the results to the case of molybdenum disulphide (MoS$_2$) monolayers.\nWe find that the so-called funnel effect, i.e. the possibility of controlling\nexciton motion by means of inhomogeneous strains, is much stronger in few-layer\nBP than in MoS$_2$ monolayers and, crucially, is of opposite sign. Instead of\nexcitons accumulating isotropically around regions of high tensile strain like\nin MoS$_2$, excitons in BP are pushed away from said regions. This\n\\emph{inverse} funnel effect is moreover highly anisotropic, with much larger\nfunnel distances along the armchair crystallographic direction, leading to a\ndirectional focusing of exciton flow. A strong inverse funnel effect could\nenable simpler designs of funnel solar cells, and offer new possibilities for\nthe manipulation and harvesting of light.\n", "  In this work, we review how the mass and the width of the $f_{0}(500)$ pole\nbehave in a regime where temperature is below the critical chiral transition\nvalue. This is attained by considering a large-$N$ $O(N + 1)/O(N)$ invariant\nNon-Linear Sigma Model (NLSM) such that we can study the dynamical generation\nof a $f_{0}(500)$ resonance. Introducing thermal effects via the imaginary time\nformalism allows us to study the behavior of the pole and relate it to chiral\nrestoration.\n", "  We present the foundation for a holographic dictionary with depth perception.\nThe dictionary consists of natural CFT operators whose duals are simple,\ndiffeomorphism-invariant bulk operators. The CFT operators of interest are the\n\"OPE blocks,\" contributions to the OPE from a single conformal family. In\nholographic theories, we show that the OPE blocks are dual at leading order in\n1/N to integrals of effective bulk fields along geodesics or homogeneous\nminimal surfaces in anti-de Sitter space. One widely studied example of an OPE\nblock is the modular Hamiltonian, which is dual to the fluctuation in the area\nof a minimal surface. Thus, our operators pave the way for generalizing the\nRyu-Takayanagi relation to other bulk fields.\n  Although the OPE blocks are non-local operators in the CFT, they admit a\nsimple geometric description as fields in kinematic space--the space of pairs\nof CFT points. We develop the tools for constructing local bulk operators in\nterms of these non-local objects. The OPE blocks also allow for conceptually\nclean and technically simple derivations of many results known in the\nliterature, including linearized Einstein's equations and the relation between\nconformal blocks and geodesic Witten diagrams.\n", "  A simultaneous Electroweak and QCD fit of electroweak parameters and parton\ndistribution functions to HERA data on deep inelastic scattering is presented.\nThe input data are neutral current and charged current inclusive cross sections\nmeasured by the H1 and ZEUS collaborations at the ep collider HERA. The\npolarisation of the electron beam was taken into account for the ZEUS and H1\ndata recorded between 2004 and 2007. Results are presented on the vector and\naxial-vector couplings of the Z boson to u- and d-type quarks. The values are\nin agreement with Standard Model predictions. The results on a_u and v_u\nrepresent the most precise measurements from a single process.\n", "  We present a numerical study of charged particle motion in a time-independent\nmagnetic field in cylindrical geometry. The magnetic field model consists of an\nunperturbed reversed-shear helical part and a perturbation consisting of a\nsuperposition of modes. Contrary to most of the previous studies, the particle\ntrajectories are computed by directly solving the full Lorentz force equations\nof motion in a six-dimensional phase space using a sixth-order, implicit,\nsymplectic Gauss-Legendre method. The level of stochasticity in the particle\norbits is diagnosed using averaged, effective Poincare sections. It is shown\nthat when only one mode is present the particle orbits can be stochastic even\nthough the magnetic field line orbits are not stochastic. The lack of\nintegrability of the particle orbits in this case is related to separatrix\ncrossing and the breakdown of the global conservation of the magnetic moment.\nSome perturbation consisting of two modes creates resonance overlapping,\nleading to Hamiltonian chaos in magnetic field lines. Then, the particle orbits\nexhibit a nontrivial dynamics depending on their energy and pitch angle. It is\nshown that the regions where the particle motion is stochastic decrease as the\nenergy increases. The non-monotonicity of the $q$-profile implies the existence\nof magnetic ITBs which correspond to shearless flux surfaces located in the\nvicinity of the $q$-profile minimum. It is shown that depending on the energy,\nthese magnetic ITBs might or might not confine particles. That is, magnetic\nITBs act as an energy-dependent particle confinement filter. Magnetic field\nlines in reversed-shear configurations exhibit topological bifurcations due to\nseparatrix reconnection. We show that a similar but more complex scenario\nappears in the case of particle orbits that depends in a non-trivial way on the\nenergy and pitch angle of the particles.\n", "  We investigate numerically the dynamics of shape and displacement\nfluctuations of two-dimensional flexible vesicles filled with active particles.\nAt low concentration most of the active particles accumulate at the boundary of\nthe vesicle where positive particle number fluctuations are amplified by\ntrapping, leading to the formation of pinched spots of high density, curvature\nand pressure. At high concentration the active particles cover the vesicle\nboundary almost uniformly, resulting in fairly homogeneous pressure and\ncurvature, and nearly circular vesicle shape. The change between polarized and\nspherical shapes is driven by the number of active particles. The\ncenter-of-mass of the vesicle performs a persistent random walk with a long\ntime diffusivity that is strongly enhanced for elongated active particles due\nto orientational correlations in their direction of propulsive motion.\n  In our model shape-shifting induces directional sensing and the cell\nspontaneously migrate along the polarization direction.\n", "  We study electrical and optical conductivities of hole gas in $p$-doped bulk\nIII-V semiconductors described by the Luttinger Hamiltonian. We provide exact\nanalytical expressions of the Drude conductivity, inverse relaxation time for\nvarious impurity potentials, Drude weight and optical conductivity in terms of\nthe Luttinger parameters $\\gamma_1 $ and $\\gamma_2$. The back scattering is\ncompletely suppressed as a result of the helicity conservation of the heavy and\nlight hole states. We find that the inverse relaxation time of heavy holes is\nmuch less than that of the light holes for Coulomb-type and Gaussian-type\nimpurity potentials and vice-versa for short-range impurity potentials. The\nDrude conductivity increases non-linearly with the increase of the hole\ndensity. The exponent of the density dependence of the conductivity is obtained\nin Thomas-Fermi limit. The Drude weight varies linearly with the density even\nin presence of the spin-orbit coupling. The finite-frequency optical\nconductivity goes as $\\sqrt{\\omega}$ and its amplitude strongly depends on the\nLuttinger parameters. The Luttinger parameters can be extracted from the\noptical conductivity measurement.\n", "  We propose a method to improve the stimulated Raman adiabatic passage\n(STIRAP) via dissipative quantum dynamics, taking into account the dephasing\neffects. Fast and robust population transfer can be obtained with the scheme by\nthe designed pulses and detuning, even though the initial state of the system\nis imperfect. With a concrete three-level system as an example, the influences\nof the imperfect initial state, variations in the control parameters, and\nvarious dissipation effects are discussed in detail. The numerical simulation\nshows that the scheme is insensitive to moderate fluctuations of experimental\nparameters and the relatively large dissipation effects of the excited state.\nFurthermore, the dominant dissipative factors, namely, the dephasing effects of\nthe ground states and the imperfect initial state are no longer undesirable, in\nfact, they are the important resources to the scheme. Therefore, the scheme\ncould provide more choices for the realization of the complete population\ntransfer in the strong dissipative fields\n", "  We calculate the strength of the frequency-dependent on-site electronic\ninteractions in the iron pnictides LaFeAsO, BaFe2As2, BaRu2As2, and LiFeAs and\nthe chalcogenide FeSe from first principles within the constrained random phase\napproximation. We discuss the accuracy of an atomic-like parametrization of the\ntwo-index density-density interaction matrices based on the calculation of an\noptimal set of three independent Slater integrals, assuming that the angular\npart of the Fe-d localized orbitals can be described within spherical harmonics\nas for isolated Fe atoms. We show that its quality depends on the ligand-metal\nbonding character rather than on the dimensionality of the lattice: it is\nexcellent for ionic-like Fe-Se (FeSe) chalcogenides and a more severe\napproximation for more covalent Fe-As (LaFeAsO, BaFe2As2) pnictides. We\nfurthermore analyze the relative importance of different screening channels,\nwith similar conclusions for the different pnictides but a somewhat different\npicture for the benchmark oxide SrVO3: the ligand channel does not appear to be\ndominant in the pnictides, while oxygen screening is the most important process\nin the oxide. Finally, we analyze the frequency dependence of the interaction.\nIn contrast to simple oxides, in iron pnictides its functional form cannot be\nsimply modeled by a single plasmon, and the actual density of modes enters the\nconstruction of an effective Hamiltonian determining the low-energy properties.\n", "  Surface acoustic waves (SAWs) traveling on the surface of a piezoelectric\ncrystal can, through the magnetoelastic interaction, excite traveling spin-wave\nresonance in a magnetic film deposited on the substrate. This spin-wave\nresonance in the magnetic film creates a time dynamic surface stress of\nmagnetoelastic origin that acts back on the surface of the piezoelectric and\nmodifies the SAW propagation. Unlike previous analyses that treat the\nexcitation as a magnon-phonon polariton, here the magnetoelastic film is\ntreated as a perturbation modifying boundary conditions on the SAW. We use\nacoustical perturbation theory to find closed form expressions for the\nback-action surface stress and strain fields and the resultant SAW velocity\nshifts and attenuation. We demonstrate that the shear stress fields associated\nwith this spin-wave back-action also generate effective surface currents on the\npiezoelectric both in-phase and out-of-phase with the driving SAW potential.\nCharacterization of these surface currents and their applications in\ndetermination of the magnetoelastic coupling are discussed. The perturbative\ncalculation is carried out explicitly to first order (a regime corresponding to\nmany experimental situations of current interest) and we provide a sketch of\nthe implications of the theory at higher order.\n", "  Bose-Einstein condensates of ultracold atoms can be used to sense\nfluctuations of the magnetic field by means of transitions into untrapped\nhyperfine states. It has been shown recently that counting the outcoupled atoms\ncan yield the power spectrum of the magnetic noise. We calculate the spectral\nresolution function which characterizes the condensate as a noise measurement\ndevice in this scheme. We use the description of the radio-frequency\noutcoupling scheme of an atom laser which takes into account the gravitational\nacceleration. Employing both an intuitive and the exact three-dimensional and\nfully quantum mechanical approach we derive the position-dependent spectral\nresolution function for condensates of different size and shape.\n", "  We present a direct construction of compact real forms of the trigonometric\nand elliptic $n$-particle Ruijsenaars-Schneider systems whose completed\ncenter-of-mass phase space is the complex projective space $\\mathbb{CP}^{n-1}$\nwith the Fubini-Study symplectic structure. These systems are labelled by an\ninteger $p\\in\\{1,\\dots,n-1\\}$ relative prime to $n$ and a coupling parameter\n$y$ varying in a certain punctured interval around $p\\pi/n$. Our work extends\nRuijsenaars's pioneering study of compactifications that imposed the\nrestriction $0<y<\\pi/n$, and also builds on an earlier derivation of more\ngeneral compact trigonometric systems by Hamiltonian reduction.\n", "  This paper deals with Nancy Cartwright's views on the measurement problem in\nQuantum Mechanics, as exposed in her book {\\it{How the Laws of Physics Lie}}.\nShe does not accept the logic of Quantum Mechanics. It is argued that her\nproposals, which are at variance with many facts results and epistemics of\nQuantum Mechanics are the result of her choice of classical logic, which leads\nher to propose the transition rate as the fundamental object of Quantum\nMechanics. I argue that this is incorrect. The positions which Nancy Cartwright\ndefends on the reduction of the wave packet do not address the fundamental\nissue, i.e. the duality of a world where quantum and classical objects coexist\nand interact. I suggest that the main problem with Nancy Cartwright's positions\nis her difficulty in accepting that the contradiction at the basis of Quantum\nMechanics, i.e. the simultaneous corpuscular and wave-like nature of quantum\nobjects, is a fact of nature. Recent experiments, described in this paper, shed\na new light on the foundations of Quantum Mechanics and on the topic of this\npaper. The limits of the no-contradiction principle are discussed; modern\ndialectical materialism is argued to offer a useful framework for the interplay\nbetween knowledge and reality.\n", "  The large coupling rate between the acoustic and optical fields confined in\nGaAs/AlAs superlattice cavities makes them appealing systems for cavity\noptomechanics. We have developed a mathematical model based on the scattering\nmatrix that allows the acoustic guided modes to be predicted in nano and\nmicropillar superlattice cavities. We demonstrate here that the reflection at\nthe surface boundary considerably modifies the acoustic quality factor and\nleads to significant confinement at the micropillar center. Our mathematical\nmodel also predicts unprecedented acoustic Fano resonances on nanopillars\nfeaturing small mode volumes and very high mechanical quality factors, making\nthem attractive systems for optomechanical applications.\n", "  In this article, we assign the $D_{s3}^*(2860)$ to be a D-wave $c\\bar{s}$\nmeson, study the hadronic coupling constants $G_{D_{s3}^*(2860)DK}$ and\n$G_{D_{s3}^*(2860)D^*K}$ with the three-point QCD sum rules, and calculate the\npartial decay widths $\\Gamma\\left(D_{s3}^*(2860)\\to D^{*}K\\right)$ and\n$\\Gamma\\left(D_{s3}^*(2860)\\to DK\\right)$. The predicted ratio\n$R=\\Gamma\\left(D_{s3}^*(2860)\\to D^{*}K\\right)/\\Gamma\\left(D_{s3}^*(2860)\\to\nDK\\right)=0.57\\pm0.38$ cannot reproduce the experimental value $R={\\rm\nBr}\\left(D_{sJ}^*(2860)\\to D^{*}K\\right)/{\\rm Br}\\left(D_{sJ}^*(2860)\\to\nDK\\right)=1.10 \\pm 0.15 \\pm 0.19$.\n", "  The results of a search for the stop, the supersymmetric partner of the top\nquark, in final states with one isolated electron or muon, jets, and missing\ntransverse momentum are reported. The search uses the 2015 LHC $pp$ collision\ndata at a center-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV recorded by the ATLAS\ndetector and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.2 fb${}^{-1}$. The\nanalysis targets two types of signal models: gluino-mediated pair production of\nstops with a nearly mass-degenerate stop and neutralino; and direct pair\nproduction of stops, decaying to the top quark and the lightest neutralino. The\nexperimental signature in both signal scenarios is similar to that of a top\nquark pair produced in association with large missing transverse momentum. No\nsignificant excess over the Standard Model background prediction is observed,\nand exclusion limits on gluino and stop masses are set at 95% confidence level.\nThe results extend the LHC Run-1 exclusion limit on the gluino mass up to 1460\nGeV in the gluino-mediated scenario in the high gluino and low stop mass\nregion, and add an excluded stop mass region from 745 to 780 GeV for the direct\nstop model with a massless lightest neutralino. The results are also\nreinterpreted to set exclusion limits in a model of vector-like top quarks.\n", "  The potential for application of magnetic skyrmions in high density storage\ndevices provides a strong drive to investigate and exploit their stability and\nmanipulability. Through a three-dimensional micromagnetic hysteresis study, we\ninvestigate the question of existence of skyrmions in cylindrical\nnanostructures of variable thickness. We quantify the applied field and\nthickness dependence of skyrmion states, and show that these states can be\naccessed through relevant practical hysteresis loop measurement protocols. As\nskyrmionic states have yet to be observed experimentally in confined\nhelimagnetic geometries, our work opens prospects for developing viable\nhysteresis process-based methodologies to access and observe skyrmionic states.\n", "  We study low-energy excitations of one-dimensional Galilean-invariant models\nintegrable by Bethe ansatz and characterized by nonsingular two-particle\nscattering phase shifts. We prove that the curvature of the excitation spectra\nis described by the recently proposed phenomenological expression for the\neffective mass. Our results apply to such models as the repulsive Lieb-Liniger\nmodel and the hyperbolic Calogero-Sutherland model.\n", "  We study a system of microcavity pillars arranged into a kagome lattice. We\nshow that polarization-dependent tunnel coupling of microcavity pillars leads\nto the emergence of the effective spin-orbit interaction consisting of the\nDresselhaus and Rashba terms, similar to the case of polaritonic graphene\nstudied earlier. Appearance of the effective spin-orbit interaction combined\nwith the time-reversal symmetry-breaking resulting from the application of the\nmagnetic field leads to the nontrivial topological properties of the Bloch\nbundles of polaritonic wavefunction. These are manifested in opening of the gap\nin the band structure and topological edge states localized on the boundary.\nSuch states are analogs of the edge states arising in topological insulators.\nOur study of polarization properties of the edge states clearly demonstrate\nthat opening of the gap is associated with the band inversion in the region of\nthe Dirac points of the Brillouin zone where the two bands corresponding to\npolaritons of opposite polarizations meet. For one particular type of boundary\nwe observe a highly nonlinear energy dispersion of the edge state which makes\npolaritonic kagome lattice a promising system for observation of edge state\nsolitons.\n", "  If a sterile neutrino nu_s with an eV-scale mass and a sizeable mixing to the\nelectron neutrino exists, as indicated by the reactor and gallium neutrino\nanomalies, a strong resonance enhancement of nu_e-nu_s oscillations of\natmospheric neutrinos should occur in the TeV energy range. At these energies\nneutrino flavour transitions in the 3+1 scheme depend on just one neutrino mass\nsquared difference and are fully described within a 3-flavour oscillation\nframework. We demonstrate that the flavour transitions of atmospheric nu_e can\nactually be very accurately described in a 2-flavour framework, with neutrino\nflavour evolution governed by an inhomogeneous Schroedinger-like equation.\nEvolution equations of this type have not been previously considered in the\ntheory of neutrino oscillations.\n", "  Layered two-dimensional (2D) materials display great potential for a range of\napplications, particularly in electronics. We report the large-scale synthesis\nof thin films of platinum diselenide (PtSe2), a thus far scarcely investigated\ntransition metal dichalcogenide. Importantly, the synthesis by thermal assisted\nconversion is performed at 400 {\\deg}C, representing a breakthrough for the\ndirect integration of this novel material with silicon (Si) technology. Besides\nthe thorough characterization of this new 2D material, we demonstrate its\npromise for applications in high-performance gas sensing with extremely short\nresponse and recovery times observed due to the 2D nature of the films.\nFurthermore, we realized vertically-stacked heterostructures of PtSe2 on Si\nwhich act as both photodiodes and photovoltaic cells. Thus this study\nestablishes PtSe2 as a potential candidate for next-generation sensors and\n(opto-)electronic devices, using fabrication protocols compatible with\nestablished Si technologies.\n", "  We study the short-time behavior of the probability distribution\n$\\mathcal{P}(H,t)$ of the surface height $h(x=0,t)=H$ in the\nKardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation in $1+1$ dimension. The process starts from\na stationary interface: $h(x,t=0)$ is given by a realization of two-sided\nBrownian motion constrained by $h(0,0)=0$. We find a singularity of the large\ndeviation function of $H$ at a critical value $H=H_c$. The singularity has the\ncharacter of a second-order phase transition. It reflects spontaneous breaking\nof the reflection symmetry $x \\leftrightarrow -x$ of optimal paths $h(x,t)$\npredicted by the weak-noise theory of the KPZ equation. At $|H|\\gg |H_c|$ the\ncorresponding tail of $\\mathcal{P}(H)$ scales as $-\\ln \\mathcal{P} \\sim\n|H|^{3/2}/t^{1/2}$ and agrees, at any $t>0$, with the proper tail of the\nBaik-Rains distribution, previously observed only at long times. The other tail\nof $\\mathcal{P}$ scales as $-\\ln \\mathcal{P} \\sim |H|^{5/2}/t^{1/2}$ and\ncoincides with the corresponding tail for the sharp-wedge initial condition.\n", "  We derive constraints on dark matter (DM) annihilation cross section and\ndecay lifetime from cross-correlation analyses of the data from Fermi-LAT and\nweak lensing surveys that cover a wide area of $\\sim660$ squared degrees in\ntotal. We improve upon our previous analyses by using an updated extragalactic\n$\\gamma$-ray background data reprocessed with the Fermi Pass 8 pipeline, and by\nusing well-calibrated shape measurements of about twelve million galaxies in\nthe Canada-France-Hawaii Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS) and Red-Cluster-Sequence\nLensing Survey (RCSLenS). We generate a large set of full-sky mock catalogs\nfrom cosmological $N$-body simulations and use them to estimate statistical\nerrors accurately. The measured cross correlation is consistent with null\ndetection, which is then used to place strong cosmological constraints on\nannihilating and decaying DM. For leptophilic DM, the constraints are improved\nby a factor of $\\sim100$ in the mass range of O(1) TeV when including\ncontributions from secondary $\\gamma$ rays due to the inverse-Compton\nupscattering of background photons. Annihilation cross-sections of $\\langle\n\\sigma v \\rangle \\sim 10^{-23}\\, {\\rm cm}^3/{\\rm s}$ are excluded for TeV-scale\nDM depending on channel. Lifetimes of $\\sim 10^{25}$ sec are also excluded for\nthe decaying TeV-scale DM. Finally, we apply this analysis to wino DM and\nexclude the wino mass around 200 GeV. These constraints will be further\ntightened, and all the interesting wino DM parameter region can be tested, by\nusing data from future wide-field cosmology surveys.\n", "  We attempt to get a polynomial solution to the inverse problem, that is, to\ndetermine the form of the mechanical Hamiltonian when given the energy spectrum\nand transition dipole moment matrix. Our approach is to determine the potential\nin the form of a polynomial by finding an approximate solution to the inverse\nproblem, then to determine the hyperpolarizability for that system's\nHamiltonian. We find that the largest hyperpolarizabilities approach the\napparent limit of previous potential optimization studies, but we do not find\nreal potentials for the parameter values necessary to exceed this apparent\nlimit. We also explore half potentials with positive exponent, which cannot be\nexpressed as a polynomial except for integer powers. This yields a simple\nclosed potential with only one parameter that scans nearly the full range of\nthe intrinsic hyperpolarizability. The limiting case of vanishing exponent\nyields the largest intrinsic hyperpolarizability.\n", "  The nonlinear response is investigated for a space-fractional quantum\nmechanical system subject to a static electric field. Expressions for the\npolarizability and hyperpolarizability are derived from the fractional\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation in the particle-centric view for a three-level model\nconstrained by the generalized Thomas-Rieke-Kuhn sum rule matrix elements.\nThese expressions resemble those for a semi-relativistic system, where the\nreduction of the maximum linear and nonlinear static response is attributed to\nthe functional dependence of the canonical position and momentum commutator. As\nexamples, a clipped quantum harmonic oscillator potential and slant well\npotential are studied. The linear and first nonlinear response to the\nperturbing field are shown to decrease as the space fractionality is moved\nfurther below unity, which is caused by a suppression of the dipole transition\nmoments. These results illustrate the importance of dimensionality and the\norder of the kinetic momentum operator which affect the strength of a system's\noptical response.\n", "  We consider the wave equation for sound in a moving fluid with a fourth-order\nanomalous dispersion relation. The velocity of the fluid is a linear function\nof position, giving two points in the flow where the fluid velocity matches the\ngroup velocity of low-frequency waves. We find the exact solution for wave\npropagation in the flow. The scattering shows amplification of classical waves,\nleading to spontaneous emission when the waves are quantized. In the\ndispersionless limit the system corresponds to a 1+1-dimensional black-hole or\nwhite-hole binary and there is a thermal spectrum of Hawking radiation from\neach horizon. Dispersion changes the scattering coefficients so that the\nquantum emission is no longer thermal. The scattering coefficients were\npreviously obtained by Busch and Parentani in a study of dispersive fields in\nde Sitter space [Phys. Rev. D 86, 104033 (2012)]. Our results give further\ndetails of the wave propagation in this exactly solvable case, where our focus\nis on laboratory systems.\n", "  The gap equations for the surface quasiparticle propagators in a slab of\nthree-dimensional topological insulator in external electric and magnetic\nfields perpendicular to the slab surfaces are analyzed and solved. A different\ntype of magnetic catalysis is revealed with the dynamical generation of both\nHaldane and Dirac gaps. Its characteristic feature manifests itself in the\ncrucial role that the electric field plays in dynamical symmetry breaking and\nthe generation of a Dirac gap in the slab. It is argued that, for a\nsufficiently large external electric field, the ground state of the system is a\nphase with a homogeneous surface charge density.\n", "  We report evidence that the experimentally found antiferromagnetic structure\nas well as the semiconducting ground state of BaMn$_2$As$_2$ are caused by\noptimally-localized Wannier states of special symmetry existing at the Fermi\nlevel of BaMn$_2$As$_2$. In addition, we find that a (small) tetragonal\ndistortion of the crystal is required to stabilize the antiferromagnetic\nsemiconducting state. To our knowledge, this distortion has not yet been\nestablished experimentally.\n", "  We study the statistics of the local resolvent and non-ergodic properties of\neigenvectors for a generalised Rosenzweig-Porter $N\\times N$ random matrix\nmodel, undergoing two transitions separated by a delocalised non-ergodic phase.\nInterpreting the model as the combination of on-site random energies $\\{a_i\\}$\nand a structurally disordered hopping, we found that each eigenstate is\ndelocalised over $N^{2-\\gamma}$ sites close in energy $|a_j-a_i|\\leq\nN^{1-\\gamma}$ in agreement with Kravtsov \\emph{et al}, arXiv:1508.01714. Our\nother main result, obtained combining a recurrence relation for the resolvent\nmatrix with insights from Dyson's Brownian motion, is to show that the\nproperties of the non-ergodic delocalised phase can be probed studying the\nstatistics of the local resolvent in a non-standard scaling limit.\n", "  The microscopic effective reaction theory is applied to deuteron-induced\nreactions. A reaction model-space characterized by a $p+n+{\\rm A}$ three-body\nmodel is adopted, where A is the target nucleus, and the nucleon-target\npotential is described by a microscopic folding model based on an effective\nnucleon-nucleon interaction in nuclear medium and a one-body nuclear density of\nA. The three-body scattering wave function in the model space is obtained with\nthe continuum-discretized coupled-channels method (CDCC), and the eikonal\nreaction theory (ERT), an extension of CDCC, is applied to the calculation of\nneutron removal cross sections. Elastic scattering cross sections of deuteron\non $^{58}$Ni and $^{208}$Pb target nuclei at several energies are compared with\nexperimental data. The total reaction cross sections and the neutron removal\ncross sections at 56 MeV on 14 target nuclei are calculated and compared with\nexperimental values.\n", "  The problem of computing differential constraints for a family of evolution\nPDEs is discussed from a constructive point of view. A new method, based on the\nexistence of generalized characteristics for evolution vector fields, is\nproposed in order to obtain explicit differential constraints for PDEs\nbelonging to this family. Several examples, with applications in non-linear\nstochastic filtering theory, stochastic perturbation of soliton equations and\nnon-isospectral integrable systems, are discussed in detail to verify the\neffectiveness of the method.\n", "  In this contribution, we discuss the results of a QM calculation of the\nopen-flavor strong decays of **** light nucleon resonances. These are the\nresults of a recent calculation, where we used a modified $^3P_0$ model for the\namplitudes and the U(7) algebraic model and the Hypercentral Quark Model to\npredict the baryon spectrum. The decay amplitudes are compared with the\nexisting experimental data.\n", "  The theoretical modelling of metal-organic interfaces represents a formidable\nchallenge, especially in consideration of the delicate balance of various\ninteraction mechanisms and the large size of involved molecular species. In the\npresent study, the energies of interface states, which are known to display a\nhigh sensitivity to the adsorption geometry and electronic structure of the\ndeposited molecular species, have been used to test the suitability and\nreliability of current theoretical approaches. Two well-ordered overlayer\nstructures (relaxed and compressed monolayer) of NTCDA on Ag(111) have been\ninvestigated using two-photon-photoemission to derive precise interface state\nenergies for these closely related systems. The experimental values are\nreproduced by our DFT calculations using different treatments of dispersion\ninteractions (optB88, PBE-D3) and basis set approaches (localized numerical\natomic orbitals, plane waves) with remarkable accuracy. This underlines the\ntrustworthiness regarding the description of geometric and electronic\nproperties.\n", "  In this letter, we propose and experimentally test a quantumness criterion\nfor single systems. The criterion is based on the violation of an already\nreported classical inequality. This inequality is expressed in terms of joint\nprobabilities that we identify as realizations of preparation-and-measurement\nschemes. Our analysis points out that superposition is the key notion to grasp\nthe quantum nature of physical systems. We verify our criterion in an\nall-optical experimental setup with heralded single photons generated via\nspontaneous parametric down conversion and use exclusively projective\npreparations and projective measurements.\n", "  Directed and elliptic flows of neutrons and light charged particles were\nmeasured for the reaction 197Au+197Au at 400 MeV/nucleon incident energy within\nthe ASY-EOS experimental campaign at the GSI laboratory. The detection system\nconsisted of the Large Area Neutron Detector LAND, combined with parts of the\nCHIMERA multidetector, of the ALADIN Time-of-flight Wall, and of the\nWashington-University Microball detector. The latter three arrays were used for\nthe event characterization and reaction-plane reconstruction. In addition, an\narray of triple telescopes, KRATTA, was used for complementary measurements of\nthe isotopic composition and flows of light charged particles. From the\ncomparison of the elliptic flow ratio of neutrons with respect to charged\nparticles with UrQMD predictions, a value \\gamma = 0.72 \\pm 0.19 is obtained\nfor the power-law coefficient describing the density dependence of the\npotential part in the parametrization of the symmetry energy. It represents a\nnew and more stringent constraint for the regime of supra-saturation density\nand confirms, with a considerably smaller uncertainty, the moderately soft to\nlinear density dependence deduced from the earlier FOPI-LAND data. The\ndensities probed are shown to reach beyond twice saturation.\n", "  We investigate ionization at a solid-water interface in applied electric\nfield. We attach an electrode to a dielectric film bearing silanol or carboxyl\ngroups with an areal density $\\Gamma_0$, where the degree of dissociation\n$\\alpha$ is determined by the proton density in water close to the film. We\nshow how $\\alpha$ depends on the density $n_0$ of NaOH in water and the surface\ncharge density $\\sigma_m$ on the electrode. For $\\sigma_m>0$, the protons are\nexpelled away from the film, leading to an increase in $\\alpha$. In particular,\nin the range $0<\\sigma_m<e\\Gamma_0$, self-regulation occurs to realize $\\alpha\n\\cong \\sigma_m/e\\Gamma_0 $ for $n_0\\ll n_c$, where $n_c$ is $0.01$ mol$/$L for\nsilica surfaces and is $2\\times 10^{-5}$ mol$/$L for carboxyl-bearing surfaces.\nWe also examine the charge regulation with decreasing the cell thickness $H$\nbelow the Debye length $\\kappa^{-1}$, where a crossover occurs at the\nGouy-Chapman length. In particular, when $\\sigma_m \\sim e\\Gamma_0$ and $H\\ll\n\\kappa^{-1}$, the surface charges remain only partially screened by ions,\nleading to an electric field in the interior.\n", "  We use the spectra of Pleiades and field stars from LAMOST DR2 archive to\nstudy how spottedness and activity vary as a function of mass at young ages. We\nobtained standard TiO band strength by measuring TiO bands near 7050 $\\AA$ from\nLAMOST spectra (R$\\approx$1800) for large sample of field GKM dwarfs with solar\nmetallicity. Analysis show that active dwarfs, including late G- and early\nK-type, have extra TiO absorption compare to inactive counterparts, indicating\nthe presence of cool spots on their surface. Active late K- and M-dwarfs show\ndeeper TiO2 and shallower TiO4 compare to inactive stars at a given TiO5, which\ncould be partly explained through cool spots. We estimated cool spot fractional\ncoverage for 304 Pleiades candidates by modelling their TiO2 (&TiO5) band\nstrength with respect to standard value. Results show that surface of large\nfraction of K- and M-type members have very large spot coverage ($\\sim$50%). We\nanalysed a correlation between spot coverage, rotation and the amplitude of\nlight variation, and found spot coverage on slow rotators ($R_{o}$ > 0.1)\nincreases with decreasing Rossby Number $R_{o}$. Interestingly, we detected a\nsaturation-like feature for spot coverage in fast rotators with a saturation\nlevel of 40%-50%. In addition, spot distribution in hotter fast rotators show\nmore symmetrical compare to slow rotators. More interestingly, we detected\nlarge spot coverage in many M type members with no or little light variation.\nIn bigger picture, these results provide important constraints for stellar\ndynamo on these cool active stars.\n", "  We consider the mechanism of photophoretic transport in protoplanetary disks\nthat are optically thick to radiation. Here, photophoresis is not caused by the\ncentral star but by temperature fluctuations that subject suspended solid\nparticles, including chondrules, to non-isotropic thermal radiation within the\ndisk. These short-lived temperature fluctuations can explain time-of-flight\nsize sorting and general number density enhancements. The same mechanism will\nalso lead to velocity fluctuations of dust aggregates beyond\n$100\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$ for mm-sized particles in protoplanetary disks.\nApplying this in future research will change our understanding of the early\nphases of collisional dust evolution and aggregate growth as particles cross\nthe bouncing barrier and as mass transfer rates are altered.\n", "  In this paper, we extend the Gribov-Zwanziger framework accounting for the\nexistence of Gribov copies to the mass deformed Bagger--Lambert--Gustavsson\n(BLG) theory in $\\mathcal{N} =1 $ superspace. The restriction of the domain of\nintegration in the Euclidean functional integral to the first Gribov horizon is\nimplemented, by adding a non-local horizon term to the effective action.\nFurthermore, the soft breaking of the BRST symmetry due to horizon term is\nrestored with the help of external sources. We compute the various Ward\nidentities for this theory relying on the Lie 3-algebras.\n", "  We investigate a new method to search for keV-scale sterile neutrinos that\ncould account for Dark Matter. Neutrinos trapped in our galaxy could be\ncaptured on stable $^{163}$Dy if their mass is greater than 2.83 keV. Two\nexperimental realizations are studied, an integral counting of $^{163}$Ho atoms\nin dysprosium-rich ores and a real-time measurement of the emerging electron\nspectrum in a dysprosium-based detector. The capture rates are compared to the\nsolar neutrino and radioactive backgrounds. An integral counting experiment\nusing several kilograms of $^{163}$Dy could reach a sensitivity for the\nsterile-to-active mixing angle $\\sin^2\\theta_{e4}$ of $10^{-5}$ significantly\nexceeding current laboratory limits. Mixing angles as low as $\\sin^2\\theta_{e4}\n\\sim 10^{-7}$ / $\\rm m_{^{163}\\rm Dy}\\rm{(ton)}$ could possibly be explored\nwith a real-time experiment.\n", "  In this paper we study a class of physical systems that combine a finite\nnumber of mechanical and thermodynamic observables. We call them finite\ndimensional thermo-mechanical systems. We introduce these systems by means of\nsimple examples. The evolution equations of the involved observables are\nobtained in each example by using, essentially, the Newton's law and the First\nLaw of Thermodynamics only. We show that such equations are similar to those\ndefining certain mechanical systems with higher order constraints. Moreover, we\nshow that all of the given examples can be described in a variational formalism\nin terms of second order constrained systems.\n", "  We analyse the mass assembly of central galaxies in the EAGLE hydrodynamical\nsimulations. We build merger trees to connect galaxies to their progenitors at\ndifferent redshifts and characterize their assembly histories by focusing on\nthe time when half of the galaxy stellar mass was assembled into the main\nprogenitor. We show that galaxies with stellar mass $M_*<10^{10.5}M_{\\odot}$\nassemble most of their stellar mass through star formation in the main\nprogenitor (`in-situ' star formation). This can be understood as a consequence\nof the steep rise in star formation efficiency with halo mass for these\ngalaxies. For more massive galaxies, however, an increasing fraction of their\nstellar mass is formed outside the main progenitor and subsequently accreted.\nConsequently, while for low-mass galaxies the assembly time is close to the\nstellar formation time, the stars in high-mass galaxies typically formed long\nbefore half of the present-day stellar mass was assembled into a single object,\ngiving rise to the observed anti-hierarchical downsizing trend. In a typical\npresent-day $M_*\\geq10^{11}M_{\\odot}$ galaxy, around $20\\%$ of the stellar mass\nhas an external origin. This fraction decreases with increasing redshift.\nBearing in mind that mergers only make an important contribution to the stellar\nmass growth of massive galaxies, we find that the dominant contribution comes\nfrom mergers with galaxies of mass greater than one tenth of the main\nprogenitor's mass. The galaxy merger fraction derived from our simulations\nagrees with recent observational estimates.\n", "  We describe a way to obtain a two-dimensional quasiperiodic tiling with\neight-fold symmetry using cold atoms. A series of such optical tilings, related\nby scale transformations, is obtained for a series of specific values of the\nchemical potential of the atoms. A theoretical model for the optical system is\ndescribed and compared with that of the well-known cut-and-project method for\nthe Ammann-Beenker tiling. This type of cold atom structure should allow the\nsimulation of several important lattice models for interacting quantum\nparticles and spins in quasicrystals.\n", "  Using data from the WISE all-sky survey we discovered that the non-thermal\ninfrared (IR) emission of blazars, the largest known population of\nextragalactic gamma-ray sources, has peculiar spectral properties. In this\nwork, we confirm and strengthen our previous analyses using the latest\navailable releases of both the WISE and the Fermi source catalogs. We also show\nthat there is a tight correlation between the mid-IR colors and the gamma-ray\nspectral index of Fermi blazars. We name this correlation \"the\ninfrared--gamma-ray connection\". We discuss how this connection links both the\nemitted powers and the spectral shapes of particles accelerated in jets arising\nfrom blazars over ten decades in energy. Based on this evidence, we argue that\nthe infrared--gamma-ray connection is stronger than the well known\nradio--gamma-ray connection.\n", "  We report on the successful completion of a 2 trillion particle cosmological\nsimulation to z=0 run on the Piz Daint supercomputer (CSCS, Switzerland), using\n4000+ GPU nodes for a little less than 80h of wall-clock time or 350,000 node\nhours. Using multiple benchmarks and performance measurements on the US Oak\nRidge National Laboratory Titan supercomputer, we demonstrate that our code\nPKDGRAV3, delivers, to our knowledge, the fastest time-to-solution for\nlarge-scale cosmological N-body simulations. This was made possible by using\nthe Fast Multipole Method in conjunction with individual and adaptive particle\ntime steps, both deployed efficiently (and for the first time) on\nsupercomputers with GPU-accelerated nodes. The very low memory footprint of\nPKDGRAV3 allowed us to run the first ever benchmark with 8 trillion particles\non Titan, and to achieve perfect scaling up to 18000 nodes and a peak\nperformance of 10 Pflops.\n", "  We consider an open quantum system for which only a subset of all possible\ntransitions are accessible, while the remaining ones are hidden from direct\nobservation. Using a modification of the notion of quantum jump trajectories we\nintroduce the coarse-grained hidden entropy, which quantifies the entropy\nproduction in the hidden subsystem conditioned on our observations of the\nvisible part. The entropy production consisting of the sum of visible and\ncoarse-grained hidden entropy is shown to satisfy an integral fluctuations\ntheorem. Depending on the nature of the continuously occurring measurement and\nfeedback processes between the interacting subsystems, the visible entropy can\ntake negative values in which case the hidden systems acts as a Maxwell's\ndemon. Our results allow us to study quantum-mechanical effects in autonomous\nsystems, such as the autonomous quantum Maxwell's demon we introduce as an\nillustrative example.\n", "  We investigate the effects of dense environments on galaxy evolution by\nexamining how the properties of galaxies in the z = 1.6 protocluster Cl\n0218.3-0510 depend on their location. We determine galaxy properties using\nspectral energy distribution fitting to 14-band photometry, including data at\nthree wavelengths that tightly bracket the Balmer and 4000A breaks of the\nprotocluster galaxies. We find that two-thirds of the protocluster galaxies,\nwhich lie between several compact groups, are indistinguishable from field\ngalaxies. The other third, which reside within the groups, differ significantly\nfrom the intergroup galaxies in both colour and specific star formation rate.\nWe find that the fraction of red galaxies within the massive protocluster\ngroups is twice that of the intergroup region. These excess red galaxies are\ndue to enhanced fractions of both passive galaxies (1.7 times that of the\nintergroup region) and dusty star-forming galaxies (3 times that of the\nintergroup region). We infer that some protocluster galaxies are processed in\nthe groups before the cluster collapses. These processes act to suppress star\nformation and change the mode of star formation from unobscured to obscured.\n", "  The nearly circular (mean eccentricity <e>~0.06) and coplanar (mean mutual\ninclination <i>~3 deg) orbits of the Solar System planets motivated Kant and\nLaplace to put forth the hypothesis that planets are formed in disks, which has\ndeveloped into the widely accepted theory of planet formation. Surprisingly,\nthe first several hundred extrasolar planets (mostly Jovian) discovered using\nthe Radial Velocity (RV) technique are commonly on eccentric orbits (<e> ~\n0.3). This raises a fundamental question: Are the Solar System and its\nformation special? The Kepler mission has found thousands of transiting planets\ndominated by sub-Neptunes, but most of their orbital eccentricities remain\nunknown. By using the precise spectroscopic host star parameters from the\nLAMOST observations, we measure the eccentricity distributions for a large\n(698) and homogeneous Kepler planet sample with transit duration statistics.\nNearly half of the planets are in systems with single transiting planets\n(singles), while the other half are multiple-transiting planets (multiples). We\nfind an eccentricity dichotomy: on average, Kepler singles are on eccentric\norbits with <e>~0.3, while the multiples are on nearly circular (<e> =\n0.04^{+0.03}_{-0.04}) and coplanar (<i> = 1.4^{+0.8}_{-1.1} deg) orbits similar\nto the Solar System planets. Our results are consistent with previous studies\nof smaller samples and individual systems. We also show that Kepler multiples\nand solar system objects follow a common relation <e>~(1-2)x<i> between mean\neccentricities and mutual inclinations. The prevalence of circular orbits and\nthe common relation may imply that the solar system is not so atypical in the\ngalaxy after all.\n", "  Many multiple-planet systems have been found by the Kepler transit survey and\nvarious radial velocity (RV) surveys. Kepler planets show an asymmetric\nfeature, namely, there are small but significant deficits/excesses of planet\npairs with orbital period spacing slightly narrow/wide of the exact resonance,\nparticularly near the first order mean motion resonance (MMR), such as 2:1 and\n3:2 MMR. Similarly, if not exactly the same, an asymmetric feature (pileup wide\nof 2:1 MMR) is also seen in RV planets, but only for massive ones. We\nanalytically and numerically study planets' orbital evolutions near and in the\nMMR. We find that their orbital period ratios could be asymmetrically\ndistributed around the MMR center regardless of dissipation. In the case of no\ndissipation, Kepler planets' asymmetric orbital distribution could be partly\nreproduced for 3:2 MMR but not for 2:1 MMR, implying that dissipation might be\nmore important to the latter. The pileup of massive RV planets just wide of 2:1\nMMR is found to be consistent with the scenario that planets formed separately\nthen migrated toward the MMR. The location of the pileup infers a K value of\n1-100 on the order of magnitude for massive planets, where K is the damping\nrate ratio between orbital eccentricity and semimajor axis during planet\nmigration.\n", "  The electrical properties of superconducting tapes and coatings in the\ndirection transverse to the long dimension of the composite has been rarely\nstudied. However, transverse dissipation can eventually determine the behavior\nof a transmission line in the case of failure due to the presence of\ntransversal cracks, and is also fundamental in the AC regime. In this paper we\npresent a preliminary experimental study of the electrical transport properties\nalong the transverse direction of BSCCO-metal tapes, and compare them with\nthose measured along the long axis of the material. In spite of the fact that\nthe tapes under study are not multi-filamentary, our experiments suggest that\nthere is a measurable anisotropy of the transport properties between the\nlongitudinal and transverse directions.\n", "  For 32 central stars of PNe we present their parameters interpolated among\nthe new evolutionary sequences. The derived stellar final masses are confined\nbetween 0.53 and 0.58 $M_\\odot$ in good agreement with the peak in the white\ndwarf mass distribution. Consequently, the inferred star formation history of\nthe Galactic bulge is well restricted between 3 and 11 Gyr and is compatible\nwith other published studies. The new evolutionary tracks proved a very good as\na tool for analysis of late stages of stars life. The result provide a\ncompelling confirmation of the accelerated post-AGB evolution.\n", "  Systematic photometric and asteroseismological studies in the last decade\nsupport the belief that white dwarfs in the solar neighborhood harbor a broad\nrange of hydrogen-layer contents. The reasons behind this spread of\nhydrogen-layer masses are not understood and usually misunderstood. In this\nwork we present, and review, the different mechanisms that can (or cannot) lead\nto the formation of white dwarfs with a broad range hydrogen contents.\n", "  The Gemini Planet Imager is a high-contrast near-infrared instrument\nspecifically designed to image exoplanets and circumstellar disks over a narrow\nfield of view. We use science data and AO telemetry taken during the first 1.5\nyr of the GPI Exoplanet Survey to quantify the performance of the AO system. In\na typical 60 sec H-band exposure, GPI achieves a 5$\\sigma$ raw contrast of\n10$^{-4}$ at 0.4\"; typical final 5$\\sigma$ contrasts for full 1 hr sequences\nare more than 10 times better than raw contrasts. We find that contrast is\nlimited by bandwidth wavefront error over much of the PSF. Preliminary\nexploratory factor analysis can explain 60-70% of the variance in raw contrasts\nwith combinations of seeing and wavefront error metrics. We also examine the\neffect of higher loop gains on contrast by comparing wavefront error maps\nreconstructed from AO telemetry to concurrent IFS images. These results point\nto several ways that GPI performance could be improved in software or hardware.\n", "  The Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) is a next-generation high-contrast imager\nbuilt for the Gemini Observatory. The GPI exoplanet survey (GPIES) consortium\nis made up of 102 researchers from 28 institutions in North and South America\nand Europe. In November 2014, we launched a search for young Jovian planets and\ndebris disks. In this paper, we discuss how we have coordinated the work done\nby this large team to improve the technical and scientific productivity of the\ncampaign, and describe lessons we have learned that could be useful for future\ninstrumentation-based astronomical surveys. The success of GPIES lies mostly on\nits decentralized structure, clear definition of policies that are signed by\neach member, and the heavy use of modern tools for communicating, exchanging\ninformation, and processing data.\n", "  The Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) has been designed for the direct detection and\ncharacterization of exoplanets and circumstellar disks. GPI is equipped with a\ndual channel polarimetry mode designed to take advantage of the inherently\npolarized light scattered off circumstellar material to further suppress the\nresidual seeing halo left uncorrected by the adaptive optics. We explore how\nrecent advances in data reduction techniques reduce systematics and improve the\nachievable contrast in polarimetry mode. In particular, we consider different\nflux extraction techniques when constructing datacubes from raw data, division\nby a polarized flat-field and a method for subtracting instrumental\npolarization. Using observations of unpolarized standard stars we find that\nGPI's instrumental polarization is consistent with being wavelength independent\nwithin our errors. In addition, we provide polarimetry contrast curves that\ndemonstrate typical performance throughout the GPIES campaign.\n", "  Most current high contrast imaging point spread function (PSF) subtraction\nalgorithms use some form of a least-squares noise minimization to find\nexoplanets that are, before post-processing, often hidden below the\ninstrumental speckle noise. In the current standard PSF subtraction algorithms,\na set of reference images is derived from the target image sequence to subtract\neach target image, using Angular and/or Simultaneous Spectral Differential\nImaging (ADI, SSDI, respectively). However, to avoid excessive exoplanet\nself-subtraction, ADI and SSDI (in the absence of a strong spectral feature)\nseverely limit the available number of reference images at small separations.\nThis limits the performance of the least-squares algorithm, resulting in lower\nsensitivity to exoplanets at small angular separations. Possible solutions are\nto use additional reference images by acquiring longer sequences, use SSDI if\nthe exoplanet is expected to show strong spectral features, or use images\nacquired on other targets. The latter option, known as Reference Star\nDifferential Imaging (RSDI), which relies on the use of reference images that\nare highly correlated to the target image, has been ineffective in previous\nground-based high contrast imaging surveys. We present the results of work to\noptimize PSF subtraction with the GPIES reference library using a least-squares\nalgorithm designed to minimize speckle noise and maximize planet throughput,\nthus maximizing the planet signal to noise ratio (SNR). Using December 2014 51\nEri GPI data in the inner 100 mas to 300 mas annulus, we find no apparent\nimprovement in SNR when using RSDI and/or our optimization scheme. This result,\nwhile still being investigated, seems to show that current algorithms on\nADI+SSDI data sets are optimized, and that limited gains can be achieved by\nusing a PSF archive.\n", "  In computer simulations of dry foams and of epithelial tissues, vertex models\nare often used to describe the shape and motion of individual cells. Although\nthese models have been widely adopted, relatively little is known about their\nbasic theoretical properties. For example, while fourfold vertices in real\nfoams are always unstable, it remains unclear whether a simplified vertex model\ndescription has the same behavior. Here, we study vertex stability and the\ndynamics of T1 topological transitions in vertex models. We show that, when all\nedges have the same tension, stationary fourfold vertices in these models do\nindeed always break up. In contrast, when tensions are allowed to depend on\nedge orientation, fourfold vertices can become stable, as is observed in some\nbiological systems. More generally, our formulation of vertex stability leads\nto an improved treatment of T1 transitions in simulations and paves the way for\nstudies of more biologically realistic models that couple topological\ntransitions to the dynamics of regulatory proteins.\n", "  Recently, two-dimensional materials and in particular transition metal\ndichalcogenides (TMDs) were extensively studied because of their strong\nlight-matter interaction and the remarkable optoelectronic response of their\nfield-effect transistors (FETs). Here, we report a photoconductivity study from\nFETs built from few-layers of p-WSe2 measured in a multi-terminal configuration\nunder illumination by a 532 nm laser source. The photogenerated current was\nmeasured as a function of the incident optical power, of the drain-to-source\nbias and of the gate voltage. We observe a considerably larger\nphotoconductivity when the phototransistors were measured via a four-terminal\nconfiguration when compared to a two-terminal one. For an incident laser power\nof 248 nW, we extract 18 A/W and ~4000% for the two-terminal responsivity (R)\nand the concomitant external quantum efficiency (EQE) respectively, when a bias\nvoltage Vds = 1 V and a gate voltage Vbg = 10 V are applied to the sample. R\nand EQE are observed to increase by 370% to ~85 A/W and ~20000% respectively,\nwhen using a four-terminal configuration. Thus, we conclude that previous\nreports have severely underestimated the optoelectronic response of transition\nmetal dichalcogenides, which in fact reveals a remarkable potential for\nphotosensing applications.\n", "  Cubic spinel Li$_{\\rm 1+x}$Ti$_2$O$_4$ is a promising electrode material as\nit exhibits a high lithium diffusivity and undergoes minimal changes in lattice\nparameters during lithiation and delithiation, thereby ensuring favorable\ncycleability. The present work is a multi-physics and multi-scale study of\nLi$_{\\rm 1+x}$Ti$_2$O$_4$ that combines first principles computations of\nthermodynamic and kinetic properties with continuum scale modeling of\nlithiation-delithiation kinetics. Density functional theory calculations and\nstatistical mechanics methods are used to calculate lattice parameters, elastic\ncoefficients, thermodynamic potentials, migration barriers and Li diffusion\ncoefficients. These quantities then inform a phase field framework to model the\ncoupled chemo-mechanical evolution of electrode particles. Several case studies\naccounting for either homogeneous or heterogeneous nucleation are considered to\nexplore the temporal evolution of maximum principle stress values, which serve\nto indicate stress localization and the potential for crack initiation, during\nlithiation and delithiation.\n", "  Quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) are high-power coherent light sources in the\nmidinfrared and terahertz parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. They are\ndevices in which the electronic and lattice systems are far from equilibrium,\nstrongly coupled to one another, and the problem bridges disparate spatial\nscales. We present our ongoing work on the multiphysics and multiscale\nsimulation of far-from-equilibrium transport of charge and heat in midinfrared\nQCLs.\n", "  The spectrum of a quasar contains important information about its properties.\nThus, it can be expected that two quasars with similar spectra will have\nsimilar properties, but just how similar has not before been quantified. Here\nwe compare the ultraviolet spectra of a sample of 5553 quasars from Data\nRelease 7 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, focusing on the $1350$ \\AA \\ $\\leq\n\\lambda \\leq 2900$ \\AA \\ rest-frame region which contains prominent emission\nlines from \\SiIV, O IV], \\CIV, \\CIII, and \\MgII\\ species. We use principal\ncomponent analysis to determine the dominant components of spectral variation,\nas well as to quantitatively measure spectral similarity. As suggested by both\nthe Baldwin effect and modified Baldwin effect, quasars with similar spectra\nhave similar properties: bolometric luminosity, Eddington fraction, and black\nhole mass. The latter two quantities are calculated from the luminosity in\nconjunction with spectral features, and the variation between quasars with\nvirtually identical spectra (which we call doppelg\\\"angers) is driven by the\nvariance in the luminosity plus measurement uncertainties. In the doppelgangers\nthe luminosity differences show 1$\\sigma$ uncertainties of 57\\% (or 0.63\nmagnitudes) and $\\sim$70\\% 1$\\sigma$ uncertainties for mass and Eddington\nfraction. Much of the difference in luminosities may be attributable to time\nlags between the spectral lines and the continuum. Furthermore, we find that\nsuggestions that the mostly highly accreting quasars should be better standard\ncandles than other quasars are not bourne out for doppelgangers. Finally, we\ndiscuss the implications for using quasars as cosmological probes and the\nnature of the first two spectral principal components.\n", "  We investigate the quantum phase transitions of spin systems in one and two\ndimensions by employing trace distance and multipartite entanglement along with\nreal-space quantum renormalization group method. As illustration examples, a\none-dimensional and a two-dimensional $XY$ models are considered. It is shown\nthat the quantum phase transitions of these spin-chain systems can be revealed\nby the singular behaviors of the first derivatives of renormalized trace\ndistance and multipartite entanglement in the thermodynamics limit. Moreover,\nwe find the renormalized trace distance and multipartite entanglement obey\ncertain universal exponential-type scaling laws in the vicinity of the quantum\ncritical points.\n", "  We report results on the studies of the $e^+e^-\\to B_s^{(*)}\\bar{B}_s^{(*)}$\nprocesses. The results are based on a $121.4$ fb$^{-1}$ data sample collected\nwith the Belle detector at the center-of-mass energy near the $\\Upsilon(10860)$\npeak and $16.4$ fb$^{-1}$ of data collected at 19 energy points in the range\nfrom 10.77 to 11.02 GeV. We observe a clear $e^+e^-\\to\\Upsilon(10860)\\to\nB_s^{(*)}\\bar{B}_s^{(*)}$ signal, with no statistically significant signal of\n$e^+e^-\\to \\Upsilon(11020)\\to B_s^{(*)}\\bar{B}_s^{(*)}$. The relative\nproduction ratio of $B_s^*\\bar{B}_s^*$, $B_s\\bar{B}_s^{*}$, and $B_s\\bar{B}_s$\nfinal states at $\\sqrt{s}=10.866$ GeV is measured to be $7:$\n$0.856\\pm0.106(stat.)\\pm0.053(syst.):$\n$0.645\\pm0.094(stat.)^{+0.030}_{-0.033}(syst.)$. An angular analysis of the\n$B_s^*\\bar{B}_s^*$ final state produced at the $\\Upsilon(10860)$ peak is also\nperformed.\n", "  The nature and distribution of sulfides within 17 porphyritic chondrules of\nthe Sahara 97096 EH3 enstatite chondrite have been studied by backscattered\nelectron microscopy and electron microprobe in order to investigate the role of\ngas-melt interactions in the chondrule sulfide formation. Troilite (FeS) is\nsystematically present and is the most abundant sulfide within the EH3\nchondrite chondrules. It is found either poikilitically enclosed in low-Ca\npyroxenes or scattered within the glassy mesostasis. Oldhamite (CaS) and\nniningerite [(Mg,Fe,Mn)S] are present in about 60% of the chondrules studied.\nWhile oldhamite is preferentially present in the mesostasis, niningerite\nassociated with silica is generally observed in contact with troilite and\nlow-Ca pyroxene. The chondrule mesostases contain high abundances of alkali and\nvolatile elements as well as silica. Our data suggest that most of the sulfides\nfound in EH3 chondrite chondrules are magmatic minerals that formed after the\ndissolution of S from a volatile-rich gaseous environment into the molten\nchondrules. Troilite formation occurred via sulfur solubility within Fe-poor\nchondrule melts followed by sulfide saturation, which causes an immiscible iron\nsulfide liquid to separate from the silicate melt. The FeS saturation started\nat the same time as or prior to the crystallization of low-Ca pyroxene during\nthe high temperature chondrule forming event(s). Protracted gas-melt\ninteractions under high partial pressures of S and SiO led to the formation of\nniningerite-silica associations via destabilization of the previously formed\nFeS and low-Ca pyroxene. We also propose that formation of the oldhamite\noccurred via the sulfide saturation of Fe-poor chondrule melts at moderate S\nconcentration due to the high degree of polymerization and the high Na-content\nof the chondrule melts, which allowed the activity of CaO in the melt to be\nenhanced.\n", "  We consider a class of opinion dynamics on networks where at each time-step,\neach node in the network disregards the opinions of a certain number of its\nmost extreme neighbors and updates its own opinion as a weighted average of the\nremaining opinions. When all nodes disregard the same number of extreme\nneighbors, previous work has shown that consensus will be reached if and only\nif the network satisfies certain topological properties. In this paper, we\nconsider the implications of allowing each node to have a personal threshold\nfor the number of extreme neighbors to ignore. We provide graph conditions\nunder which consensus is guaranteed for such dynamics. We then study random\nnetworks where each node's threshold is drawn from a certain distribution, and\nprovide conditions on that distribution, together with conditions on the edge\nformation probability, that guarantee that consensus will be reached\nasymptotically almost surely.\n", "  The quantum physics of ions and electrons behind low-energy spectra of\nstrongly correlated {\\it molecular} conductors, superconductors and Mott\ninsulators is poorly known, yet fascinating especially in orbitally degenerate\ncases. The fulleride insulator Cs$_{3}$C$_{60}$ (A15), one such system,\nexhibits infrared (IR) spectra with low temperature peak features and\nsplittings suggestive of static Jahn-Teller distortions with breakdown of\norbital symmetry in the molecular site. That is puzzling, for there is no\ndetectable static distortion, and because the features and splittings disappear\nupon modest heating, which they should not. Taking advantage of the\nMott-induced collapse of electronic wavefunctions from lattice-extended to\nnanoscale localized inside a caged molecular site, we show that unbroken spin\nand orbital symmetry of the ion multiplets explains the IR spectrum without\nadjustable parameters. This demonstrates the importance of a fully quantum\ntreatment of nuclear positions and orbital momenta in the Mott insulator sites,\ndynamically but not statically distorted. The observed demise of these features\nwith temperature is explained by the thermal population of a multiplet term\nwhose nuclear positions are essentially undistorted, but whose energy is very\nlow-lying. That term is in facts a scaled-down orbital excitation analogous to\nthat of other Mott insulators, with the same spin $1/2$ as the ground state,\nbut with a larger orbital moment of two instead of one.\n", "  We report a study on a series of lanthanum doped barium stannate-titanate\n(LBTS) ceramics towards correlating their microstructure with ferroelectric\nproperties. The samples were prepared by solid state reaction technique and the\nXRD analysis indicated predominantly single phase microstructure. Scanning\nElectron Microscopy revealed that while a low La doping of 1 atomic % yielded\ninhibited grain growth in 1LBTS, higher amounts of La doping yield larger leafy\ngrains. This peculiar grain growth and microstructure evolution could be\nattributed to the combination of the following two competing factors: (i)\nsuppression of O vacancies due to La doping leading to grain growth inhibition\nand (ii) enhancement of mechanism leading to nucleation and growth of 2-D\n(leafy) grains for La doping higher than 2 atomic % due to eutectic phenomena.\nDielectric permittivity measurements indicate that addition of La enhances\ndiffused phase transition in BTS, but its frequency dependence is observed only\nat 2 atomic % La doping. This signature relaxor behaviour and the increase in\nthe intensity of a particular Raman peak with La doping, as well as\nnon-saturated PE hysteresis loops confirm the presence of polar nano-regions\nfor 2 and 3 atomic % La doped BTS. However significant enhancement in\ndielectric permittivity could not be achieved due to reduced grain size.\n", "  We consider the measurement of the trilinear couplings of the neutral Higgs\nbosons~($H^0, h^0$) in the minimal supersymmetric standard model~(MSSM) at a\nhigh energy $e^+$ $e^-$ linear collider in the light of the discovery of a\nHiggs boson at the CERN Large Hadron Collider~(LHC). We identify the state\nobserved at the LHC with the lightest CP-even Higgs boson of the MSSM. We\nimplement this constraint, as well as all the other relevant experimental\nconstraints, on the parameter space of the MSSM in order to study the\nfeasibility of measuring the trilinear couplings of the neutral Higgs bosons.\nFor the measurement of trilinear couplings, we consider the multiple Higgs\nproduction processes. We delineate the regions of MSSM parameter space where\nthe trilinear couplings of the neutral Higgs bosons could be measured at a high\nenergy electron-positron collider.\n", "  Some European scholars in the second half of 18th century discussed the myth\nof Atlantis taking into account the studies of the evolution of the Earth and\nof the beginning and diffusion of civilization, in particular the beginning of\nastronomy. Atlantis was considered the cradle of the civilization, and while\nJ.S. Bailly proposed that it was located in the Arctic and tried to convince\nVoltaire about his idea, G.R. Carli maintained the classical position in the\nAtlantic Ocean. Bailly's arguments and their criticism by Carli are of some\ninterest, since they remind of the general problems that still plague cultural\nastronomy and archaeoastronomy. I will mention briefly the methodological\nproblem of demonstration and evidence in these fields, and finally I will\nsuggest a possible psychological limit when dealing with these topics.\n", "  We study a multimode optomechanical system where two mechanical oscillators\nare coupled to an electromagnetic cavity. Previously it has been shown that if\nthe mechanical resonances have nearly equal frequencies, one can make the\noscillators to interact via the cavity by strong pumping with a coherent pump\ntone. One can view the interaction also as emergence of an electromagnetically\ndark mode which gets asymptotically decoupled from the cavity and has a\nlinewidth much smaller than that of the bare cavity. The narrow linewidth and\nlong lifetime of the dark mode could be advantageous for example in information\nstorage and processing. Here we investigate the possibility to create dark\nmodes dynamically using two pump tones. We show that if the mechanical\nfrequencies are intrinsically different, one can bring the mechanical\noscillators and the cavity on-resonance and thus create a dark mode by double\nsideband pumping of the cavity. We realize the scheme in a microwave\noptomechanical device employing two drum oscillators with unmatched\nfrequencies, {\\omega}_1 /2{\\pi} = 8.1MHz and {\\omega}_2 /2{\\pi} = 14.2MHz. We\nalso observe a breakdown of the rotating-wave approximation, most pronounced in\nanother device where the mechanical frequencies are close to each other.\n", "  Liquid droplet whispering-gallery-mode microresonators open a new research\nfrontier for optomechanics and photonic devices. At visible wavelengths, where\nmost liquids are transparent, a major contribution to a droplet optical quality\nfactor is expected theoretically from thermal surface distortions and capillary\nwaves. Here, we investigate experimentally these predictions using transient\ncavity ring-down spectroscopy. In this way, the optical out-coupling and\nintrinsic loss are measured independently while any perturbation induced by\nthermal, acoustic and laser-frequency noise is avoided thanks to the\nultra-short light-cavity interaction time. The measurements reveal a photon\nlifetime ten times longer than the thermal limit and suggest that capillary\nfluctuations activate surface scattering effects responsible for light\ncoupling.\n", "  We describe a general recipe for constructing Metropolis updates for\nDiagrammatic Monte-Carlo (DiagMC) algorithms, based on the Schwinger-Dyson\nequations in quantum field theory. This approach bypasses explicit duality\ntransformations, enumeration or classification of diagrams and can be used for\nlattice quantum field theories with unknown or complicated dual representations\n(such as non-Abelian lattice gauge theories). DiagMC algorithms constructed in\nthis way can still be plagued by the sign problem, which is, however,\ncompletely different from the sign problem in conventional Monte-Carlo\nsimulations and has its origin in cancellations between diagrams with positive\nand negative weights. To test the presented approach, we apply DiagMC to\ncalculate the first 7 orders of 1/N expansion in the quartic matrix model and\nfind good agreement with analytic results, with the exception of the close\nvicinity of the critical coupling where the critical slowing down sets in.\n", "  On the basis of qualitative analysis of the system of differential equations\nof the standard cosmological model it is shown that in the case of zero\ncosmological constant this system has a stable center corresponding to zero\nvalues of potential and its derivative at infinity. Thus, the cosmological\nmodel based on single massive classical scalar field in infinite future would\ngive a flat Universe. The carried out numerical simulation of the dynamic\nsystem corresponding to the system of Einstein - Klein - Gordon equations\nshowed that at great times of the evolution the invariant cosmological\nacceleration has an oscillating character and changes from $-2$ (braking), to\n$+1$ (acceleration). Average value of the cosmological acceleration is negative\nand is equal to $-1/2$. Oscillations of the cosmological acceleration happen on\nthe background of rapidly falling Hubble constant. In the case of nonzero value\nof the cosmological constant depending on its value there are possible three\nvarious qualitative behavior types of the dynamic system on 2-dimensional plane\n$(\\Phi,\\dot{\\Phi})$, which correspond either to zero attractive focus or to\nstable attractive knot with zero values of the potential and its derivative.\nHerewith the system asymptotically enters the secondary inflation. Carried out\nnumerical simulation showed that at cosmological constant $\\Lambda<m^2\n3\\cdot10^{-8}$ the macroscopic value of the cosmological acceleration behaves\nitself similar to the case $\\Lambda=0$, i.e. in the course of the cosmological\nevolution there appears a lasting stage when this value is close to $-1/2$\nwhich corresponds to non-relativistic equation of state. In this article, the\nresults of qualitative and numerical analysis, obtained in Yu. Ignat'ev,\narXiv:1609.00745 [gr-qc], common to the case of a non-zero cosmological term.\n", "  Starting from a spectral expansion of the Fokker-Plank equation for the\nmembrane potential density in a network of spiking neurons, a low-dimensional\ndynamics of the collective firing rate is derived. As a result a $n$-order\nordinary differential equation for the network activity can be worked out by\ntaking into account the slowest $n$ modes of the expansion. The resulting\nlow-dimensional dynamics naturally takes into account the strength of the\nsynaptic couplings under the hypothesis of a not too fast changing membrane\npotential density. By considering only the two slowest modes, the firing rate\ndynamics is equivalent to the one of a damped oscillator in which the angular\nfrequency and the relaxation time are state-dependent. The presented results\napply to a wide class of networks of one-compartment neuron models.\n", "  The aim of this paper is to present an analytical relationship between the\npower spectral density of GRACE-like mission measurements and the accuracies of\nthe gravity field coefficients mainly from the point of view of theory of\nsignal and system, which indicates the one-to-one correspondence between\nspherical harmonic error degree variances and frequencies of the measurement\nnoise. In order to establish this relationship, the average power of the errors\ndue to gravitational acceleration difference and the relationship between\nperturbing forces and range-rate perturbations are derived, based on the\northogonality property of associated Legendre functions and the linear orbit\nperturbation theory, respectively. This method provides a physical insight into\nthe relation between mission parameters and scientific requirements. By taking\nGRACE-FO as the object of research, the effects of sensor noises and time\nvariable gravity signals are analyzed. If LRI measurements are applied, a\nmission goal with a geoid accuracy of 7.4 cm at a spatial resolution of 101 km\nis reachable, whereas if the KBR measurement error model is applied, a mission\ngoal with a geoid accuracy of 10.2 cm at a spatial resolution of 125 km is\nreachable. Based on the discussion of the spectral matching of instrument\naccuracies, an improvement in accuracy of accelerometers is necessary for the\nmatch between the range errors and accelerometer noises in the future mission.\nTemporal aliasing caused by the time variable gravity signals is also discussed\nby this method.\n", "  The recently reported 3rd and 4th biological transparency windows located\nrespectively at 1.6-1.9um and 2.1-2.3um promise deeper tissue penetration and\nreduced collateral photodamage, yet they haven't been utilized in photothermal\ntherapy applications. Nanoparticle based plasmonic photothermal therapy poses a\nnontrivial optimization problem in which the light absorption efficiency of the\nnanoparticle has to be maximized subject to various constraints that are\nimposed by application environment. Upscaling the typical absorber-dominant\nnanoparticle designs (rod, sphere etc.) that operate in the 1st and 2nd\ntransparency windows is not a viable option as their size gets prohibitively\nlarge for cell intrusion and they become scatterer-dominant. The present study\naddresses this issue and suggests a versatile approach for designing both\nlithography based and self-assembling absorber dominant nanostructures for the\nnew transparency windows, while keeping their size relatively small. The\nproposed nanoparticles demonstrate up to 40% size reduction and 2-fold increase\nin absorption efficiency compared to the conventional nanobar design. The\noverall photothermal performance per nanoparticle in the 4th window is boosted\nup by 250% compared to the 2nd window.\n", "  We use radio-continuum all-sky surveys at 1420 and 408 MHz with the aim to\ninvestigate properties of the Galactic radio source Lupus Loop. The survey data\nat 1435 MHz, with the linear polarization of the southern sky, is also used. We\ncalculate properties of this supernova remnant: the brightness temperature,\nsurface brightness and radio spectral index. For determining borders and\ncalculation of its properties, we use the method we have developed. The\nnon-thermal nature of its radiation is confirmed. The distribution of spectral\nindex over its area is also given. A significant correlation between the radio\nspectral index distribution and the corresponding polarized intensity\ndistribution inside the loop borders is found, indicating that the polarization\nmaps could provide us information about the distribution of interstellar\nmedium, and thus could represent one additional way to search for new Galactic\nloops.\n", "  The key to optical analogy to a multi-particle quantum system is the scalable\nproperty. Optical elds modulated with pseudorandom phase sequences is an\ninteresting solution. By utilizing the properties of pseudorandom sequences,\nmixing multiple optical elds are distinguished by using coherent detection and\ncorrelation analysis that are mature methods in optical communication. In this\npaper, we utilize the methods to investigate optical analogies to\nmulti-particle quantum states. In order to demonstrate the feasibility,\nnumerical simulations are carried out in the paper, which is helpful to the\nexperimental verication in the future.\n", "  In 1909, Millikan showed that the charge of electrically isolated systems is\nquantized in units of the elementary electron charge e. Today, the persistence\nof charge quantization in small, weakly connected conductors allows for\ncircuits where single electrons are manipulated, with applications in e.g.\nmetrology, detectors and thermometry. However, quantum fluctuations\nprogressively reduce the discreteness of charge as the connection strength is\nincreased. Here we report on the full quantum control and characterization of\ncharge quantization. By using semiconductor-based tunable elemental conduction\nchannels to connect a micrometer-scale metallic island, the complete evolution\nis explored while scanning the entire range of connection strengths, from\ntunnel barrier to ballistic contact. We observe a robust scaling of charge\nquantization as the square root of the residual electron reflection probability\nacross a quantum channel when approaching the ballistic critical point, which\nalso applies beyond the regimes yet accessible to theory. At increased\ntemperatures, the thermal fluctuations result in an exponential suppression of\ncharge quantization as well as in a universal square root scaling, for\narbitrary connection strengths, in agreement with expectations. Besides direct\napplications to improve single-electron functionalities and for the\nmetal-semiconductor hybrids emerging in the quest toward topological quantum\ncomputing, the knowledge of the quantum laws of electricity will be essential\nfor the quantum engineering of future nanoelectronic devices.\n", "  The evolution of titanyl-phthalocyanine (TiOPc) thin films on Ag(111) has\nbeen investigated using IRAS, SPA-LEED and STM. In the (sub)monolayer regime\nvarious phases are observed that can be assigned to a 2D gas, a commensurate\nand a point-on-line phase. In all three phases the non-planar TiOPc molecule is\nadsorbed on Ag(111) in an oxygen-up configuration with the molecular\npi-conjugated backbone oriented parallel to the surface. The commensurate phase\nreveals a high packing density, containing two molecules at inequivalent\nadsorption sites within the unit cell. Both molecules assume different\nazimuthal orientations which is ascribed to preferred sites and azimuthal\norientations with respect to the Ag(111) substrate and, to a lesser extent, to\na minimization of repulsive Pauli interactions between adjacent molecules at\nshort distances. At full saturation of the monolayer the latter interaction\nbecomes dominant and the commensurate long range order is lost. DFT\ncalculations have been used to study different adsorption geometries of TiOPc\non Ag(111). The most stable configurations among those with pointing up oxygen\natoms (bridge+, bridgex, topx) seem to correspond to those identified\nexperimentally. The calculated dependence of the electronic structure and\nmolecular dipole on the adsorption site and configuration is found to be rather\nsmall.\n", "  Calculations of atmospheric refraction are generally based on a simplified\nmodel of atmospheric density in the troposphere which assumes that the\ntemperature decreases at a constant lapse rate from sea level up to a height\nequal to eleven km, and that afterwards it remains constant. In this model, the\ntemperature divided by the lapse rate determines the length scale in the\ncalculations for altitudes less than this height. But daily balloon\nmeasurements across the U.S.A. reveal that in some cases the air temperature\nactually increases from sea level up to a height of about one km, and only\nafter reaching a plateau, it decreases at an approximately constant lapse rate.\nMoreover, in three examples considered here, the temperature does not remain\nconstant at eleven km , but continues to decreases to a minimum at about\nsixteen kilometers , and then increases at higher altitudes at a lower rate.\nCalculations of atmospheric refraction based on this atmospheric data is\ncompared with the results of simplified models.\n", "  Scale invariance property in the global geometry of Earth may lead to a\ncoupled interactive behaviour between various components of the climate system.\nOne of the most interesting correlations exists between spatial statistics of\nthe global topography and the temperature on Earth. Here we show that the\npower-law behaviour observed in the Earth topography via different approaches,\nresembles a scaling law in the global spatial distribution of independent\natmospheric parameters. We report on observation of scaling behaviour of such\nvariables characterized by distinct universal exponents. More specifically, we\nfind that the spatial power-law behaviour in the fluctuations of the near\nsurface temperature over the lands on Earth, shares the same universal exponent\nas of the global Earth topography, indicative of the global persistent role of\nthe static geometry of Earth to control the steady state of a dynamical\natmospheric field. Such a universal feature can pave the way to the theoretical\nunderstanding of the chaotic nature of the atmosphere coupled to the Earth's\nglobal topography.\n", "  We consider a certain simplification of the two-dimensional thermomicropolar\nfluids equations. We prove the existence of certain solutions to these\nequations depending on the regularity of the intial data. We investigate the\nuniqueness of the solutions and continuous dependence on intial data.\n", "  We report on a Digital Image Correlation-based technique for the detection of\nin-plane elastic waves propagating in structural lattices. The experimental\ncharacterization of wave motion in lattice structures is currently of great\ninterest due its relevance to the design of novel mechanical metamaterials with\nunique/unusual properties such as strongly directional behavior, negative\nrefractive indexes and topologically protected wave motion. Assessment of these\nfunctionalities often requires the detection of highly spatially resolved\nin-plane wavefields, which for reticulated or porous structural assemblies is\nan open challenge. A Digital Image Correlation approach is implemented that\ntracks small displacements of the lattice nodes by centering image subsets\nabout the lattice intersections. A high speed camera records the motion of the\npoints by properly interleaving subsequent frames thus artificially enhancing\nthe available sampling rate. This, along with an imaging stitching procedure,\nenables the capturing of a field of view that is sufficiently large for\nsubsequent processing. The transient response is recorded in the form of the\nfull wavefields, which are processed to unveil features of wave motion in a\nhexagonal lattice. Time snapshots and frequency contours in the spatial Fourier\ndomain are compared with numerical predictions to illustrate the accuracy of\nthe recorded wavefields and demonstrate the suitability of this technique for\nthe experimental characterization of wave properties.\n", "  The results of three-dimensional numerical simulations of the gas dynamics of\nthe atmosphere of a \"hot Jupiter\" exoplanet during the passage of a coronal\nmass ejection (CME) from the central star are presented. These computations\nassumed the parameters for the stellar wind and the CME to be typical of the\nsolar values. The characteristic variations of the flow pattern are considered\nfor quasi-closed and closed (but appreciably distorted by the gravitational\ninfluence of the star) gaseous envelopes of the exoplanet. It is shown that a\ntypical CME is sufficient to tear off the outer part of an asymmetric envelope\nthat is located beyond the Roche lobe and carry it away from the exoplanet.\nThis leads to a substantial increase in the mass-loss rate from the exoplanet\nenvelope during the passage of CMEs. The mass-loss rate grows by about a factor\nof 11 for a closed envelope, and by about a factor of 14 for a quasi-closed\nenvelope. Possible evolutionary consequences of the loss of part of the\natmosphere during the passage of CMEs are discussed.\n", "  We derive a low-energy theory for edge states in transition metal\ndichalcogenide monolayers for a two-band $\\bm{kp}$-Hamiltonian in case of\nuncoupled valleys. In the absence of spin-orbit interaction at the edge, these\nstates possess a linear dispersion described by a single phenomenological\nparameter characterizing the edge structure. Depending on the sign of the\nparameter, the edge state spectrum can either cross the band gap or lie outside\nof it. In the first case, the presence of edge states leads to resonant\nenhancement of the second harmonic generation at frequencies about the half of\nthe band gap, in agreement with recent experiments. The value of the\nphenomenological boundary parameter is extracted from the resonance frequency\nposition.\n", "  A long-standing problem in numerical relativity is the satisfactory treatment\nof future null-infinity. We propose an approach for the evolution of\nhyperboloidal initial data in which the outer boundary of the computational\ndomain is placed at infinity. The main idea is to apply the `dual foliation'\nformalism in combination with hyperboloidal coordinates and the generalized\nharmonic gauge formulation. The strength of the present approach is that,\nfollowing the ideas of Zenginoglu, a hyperboloidal layer can be naturally\nattached to a central region using standard coordinates of numerical relativity\napplications. Employing a generalization of the standard hyperboloidal slices,\ndeveloped by Calabrese et. al., we find that all formally singular terms take a\ntrivial limit as we head to null-infinity. A byproduct is a numerical approach\nfor hyperboloidal evolution of nonlinear wave equations violating the\nnull-condition. The height-function method, used often for fixed background\nspacetimes, is generalized in such a way that the slices can be dynamically\n`waggled' to maintain the desired outgoing coordinate lightspeed precisely.\nThis is achieved by dynamically solving the eikonal equation. As a first\nnumerical test of the new approach we solve the 3D flat space scalar wave\nequation. The simulations, performed with the pseudospectral bamps code, show\nthat outgoing waves are cleanly absorbed at null-infinity and that errors\nconverge away rapidly as resolution is increased.\n", "  We studied the physical parameters of a sample comprising of all Spitzer/IRS\npublic spectra of Seyfert galaxies in the mid-infrared (5.2-38$\\mu$m range)\nunder the active galactic nuclei (AGN) unified model. We compare the observed\nspectra with $\\sim10^6$ CLUMPY model spectral energy distributions, which\nconsider a torus composed of dusty clouds. We find a slight difference in the\ndistribution of line-of-sight inclination angle, $i$, requiring larger angles\nfor Seyfert 2 (Sy2) and a broader distribution for Seyfert 1 (Sy1). We found\nsmall differences in the torus angular width, $\\sigma$, indicating that Sy1 may\nhost a slightly narrower torus than Sy2. The torus thickness, together with the\nbolometric luminosities derived, suggest a very compact torus up to $\\sim$6 pc\nfrom the central AGN. The number of clouds along the equatorial plane, $N$, as\nwell the index of the radial profile, $q$, are nearly the same for both types.\nThese results imply that the torus cloud distribution is nearly the same for\ntype 1 and type 2 objects. The torus mass is almost the same for both types of\nactivity, with values in the range of $M_{tor}\\sim$10$^{4}-$10$^{7}\\rm\nM_{\\odot}$. The main difference appears to be related to the clouds' intrinsic\nproperties: type 2 sources present higher optical depths $\\tau_V$. The results\npresented here reinforce the suggestion that the classification of a galaxy may\ndepend also on the intrinsic properties of the torus clouds rather than simply\non their inclination. This is in contradiction with the simple geometric idea\nof the unification model.\n", "  The recent book by T. Piketty (Capital in the Twenty-First Century) promoted\nthe important issue of wealth inequality. In the last twenty years, physicists\nand mathematicians developed models to derive the wealth distribution using\ndiscrete and continuous stochastic processes (random exchange models) as well\nas related Boltzmann-type kinetic equations. In this literature, the usual\nconcept of equilibrium in Economics is either replaced or completed by\nstatistical equilibrium.\n  In order to illustrate this activity with a concrete example, we present a\nstylised random exchange model for the distribution of wealth. We first discuss\na fully discrete version (a Markov chain with finite state space). We then\nstudy its discrete-time continuous-state-space version and we prove the\nexistence of the equilibrium distribution. Finally, we discuss the connection\nof these models with Boltzmann-like kinetic equations for the marginal\ndistribution of wealth. This paper shows in practice how it is possible to\nstart from a finitary description and connect it to continuous models following\nBoltzmann's original research program.\n", "  Simulations of propagation of light beams in specially designed multilayer\nsemiconductor structures (one-dimensional photonic crystals) with embedded\nquantum wells reveal characteristic optical properties of resonant hyperbolic\nmetamaterials. A strong dependence of the refraction angle and the optical beam\nspread on the exciton radiative lifetime is revealed. We demonstrate the strong\nnegative refraction of light and the control of the group velocity of light by\nan external bias through its effect upon the exciton radiative properties.\n", "  Many different proteins self-aggregate into insoluble fibrils growing\napically by reversible addition of elementary building blocks. But beyond this\ncommon principle, the modalities of fibril formation are very disparate, with\nvarious intermediate forms which can be reshuffled by minor modifications of\nphysico-chemical conditions or amino-acid sequences. To bypass this complexity,\nthe multifaceted phenomenon of fibril formation is reduced here to its most\nelementary principles defined for a linear prototype of fibril. Selected\ngeneric features, including nucleation, elongation and conformational\nrecruitment, are modeled using minimalist hypotheses and tools, by separating\nequilibrium from kinetic aspects and in vitro from in vivo conditions. These\nreductionist approaches allow to bring out known and new rudiments, including\nthe kinetic and equilibrium effects of nucleation, the dual influence of\nelongation on nucleation, the kinetic limitations on nucleation and fibril\nnumbers and the accumulation of complexes in vivo by rescue from degradation.\nOverlooked aspects of these processes are also pointed: the exponential\ndistribution of fibril lengths can be recovered using various models because it\nis attributable to randomness only. It is also suggested that the same term\n\"critical concentration\" is used for different things, involved in either\nnucleation or elongation.\n", "  How the cells break symmetry and organize their edge activity to move\ndirectionally is a fun- damental question in cell biology. Physical models of\ncell motility commonly rely on gradients of regulatory factors and/or feedback\nfrom the motion itself to describe polarization of edge activity. Theses\napproaches, however, fail to explain cell behavior prior to the onset of\npolarization. Our analysis using the model system of polarizing and moving fish\nepidermal keratocytes suggests a novel and simple principle of\nself-organization of cell activity in which local cell-edge dynamics depends on\nthe distance from the cell center, but not on the orientation with respect to\nthe front-back axis. We validate this principle with a stochastic model that\nfaithfully reproduces a range of cell-migration behaviors. Our findings\nindicate that spontaneous polarization, persistent motion, and cell shape are\nemergent properties of the local cell-edge dynamics controlled by the distance\nfrom the cell center.\n", "  Introducing, observing, and manipulating individual impurities coupled to a\nhost material offers the opportunity to create new device concepts based on\nsingle spin and charge states. Because of potential applications in spintronics\nand magneto-electrics, such an approach would be particularly useful for\ntopological insulators (TI), a recently discovered material class hosting\nspin-momentum- locked surface states. To make them useful for new technologies,\na robust control of their interaction with external perturbations is required.\nHowever, traditional approaches such as metal electrodes or doping proved to be\nproblematic and resulted in strong mesoscopic fluctuations making the\nspin-momentum locking ill-defined. Here, we demonstrate the effective gating of\nTIs by coupling molecules to their surface which, by using electric fields,\nallow to dynamically control the interface charge state by adding or removing\nsingle electrons. This process creates a robust transconductance bistability\nresembling a single-electron transistor. Our findings make hybrid molecule/TI\ninterfaces functional elements while at the same time pushing miniaturization\nat its ultimate limit. This opens a new avenue for all electric-controlled\nspintronic devices based on these fascinating materials.\n", "  With an eye toward the usual unphysical divergence of hard fixed-order\ncorrections in predictions for the processes probed in high energy colliding\nhadron beam devices as one approaches the soft limit, we present a new approach\nto the realization of such corrections, with some emphasis on the LHC and the\nfuture FCC devices. We show that the respective divergence is removed in our\napproach. This means that we would render the standard results to be closer to\nthe observed exclusive distributions. While we stress that the approach has\ngeneral applicability, we use the single Z and virtual gamma production and\ndecay to lepton pairs as our prototypical example. Accordingly, our work opens\nanother part of the way to rigorous baselines for the determination of the\ntheoretical precision tags for LHC physics, with an attendant generalization to\nthe future FCC.\n", "  We modify and give complete proofs for the results of\nEtingof-Schiffmann-Varchenko on traces of intertwiners of untwisted quantum\naffine algebras in the opposite coproduct and the standard grading. More\nprecisely, we show that certain normalized generalized traces for\n$U_q(\\hat{\\mathfrak{g}})$ solve four commuting systems of q-difference\nequations: the Macdonald-Ruijsenaars, dual Macdonald-Ruijsenaars, q-KZB, and\ndual q-KZB equations. In addition, we show a symmetry property for these\nrenormalized trace functions. Our modifications are motivated by their\nappearance in recent work of the author.\n"]}
