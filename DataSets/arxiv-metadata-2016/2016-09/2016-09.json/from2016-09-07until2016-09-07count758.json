event-by-event fluctuations of charged hadron\nmultiplicity in relativistic heavy ions is presented. The survey covers Au+Au\ncollisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 62.4 and 200 GeV, and Cu+Cu collisions sqrt(s_NN) =\n22.5, 62.4, and 200 GeV. Fluctuations are measured as a function of collision\ncentrality, transverse momentum range, and charge sign. After correcting for\nnon-dynamical fluctuations due to fluctuations in the collision geometry within\na centrality bin, the remaining dynamical fluctuations expressed as the\nvariance normalized by the mean tend to decrease with increasing centrality.\nThe dynamical fluctuations are consistent with or below the expectation from a\nsuperposition of participant nucleon-nucleon collisions based upon p+p data,\nindicating that this dataset does not exhibit evidence of critical behavior in\nterms of the compressibility of the system. An analysis of Negative Binomial\nDistribution fits to the multiplicity distributions demonstrates that the heavy\nion data exhibit weak clustering properties.\n", "  A new code called VAAQP (Variational Average-Atom in Quantum Plasmas) is\nreported. The model as well as main results of previous studies are briefly\nrecalled. The code is based on a new fully variational model of dense plasmas\nat equilibrium with quantum treatment of all electrons. The code can calculate\nthe Average Atom structure and the mean ionization from the variational\nequations respecting the virial theorem and without imposing the neutrality of\nthe Wigner-Seitz sphere. The formula obtained for the electronic pressure is\nsimple and does not require any numerical differentiation. A description of the\nprincipal features of the code is given. The thermodynamic consistency of the\nresults obtained with VAAQP is shown by a comparison with another approach on\nthe example of the aluminium 10 eV isotherm EOS curve. A first comparison to an\nINFERNO-type model is also presented.\n", "  We present a class of non-asymptotically flat (NAF) charged black p-branes\n(BpB) with p-compact dimensions in higher dimensional Einstein-Yang-Mills\ntheory. Asymptotically the NAF structure manifests itself as an anti-de-sitter\nspacetime. We determine the total mass / energy enclosed in a thin-shell\nlocated outside the event horizon. By comparing the entropies of BpB with those\nof black holes in same dimensions we derive transition criteria between the two\ntypes of black objects. Given certain conditions satisfied our analysis shows\nthat BpB can be considered excited states of black holes. An event horizon\n$r_{+}$ versus charge square $Q^{2}$ plot \\ for the BpB reveals such a\ntransition where $r_{+}$ is related to the horizon radius $r_{h}$ of the black\nhole (BH) both with the common charge $% Q. $\n", "  We investigate transport through nanoribbons in the presence of disorder\nscattering. We show that size quantization patterns are only present when SU(2)\npseudospin symmetry is preserved. Symmetry breaking disorder renders transverse\nquantization invisible, which may provide an explanation for the necessity of\nsuspending graphene nanoconstrictions to obtain size quantization signatures in\nvery recent experiments. Employing a quasi-classical Monte-Carlo simulation, we\nare able to reproduce and explain key qualitative features of the full\nquantum-mechanical calculations.\n", "  We present measurements of the intergalactic medium (IGM) temperature within\n~5 proper Mpc of seven luminous quasars at z~6. The constraints are obtained\nfrom the Doppler widths of Lyman-alpha absorption lines in the quasar\nnear-zones and build upon our previous measurement for the z=6.02 quasar SDSS\nJ0818+1722. The expanded data set, combined with an improved treatment of\nsystematic uncertainties, yields an average temperature at the mean density of\nlog (T_0/K) = 4.21 \\pm 0.03 (\\pm^0.06_0.07) at 68 (95) per cent confidence for\na flat prior distribution over 3.2 < log (T_0/K) < 4.8. In comparison,\ntemperatures measured from the general IGM at z~5 are ~0.3 dex cooler, implying\nan additional source of heating around these quasars which is not yet present\nin the general IGM at slightly lower redshift. This heating is most likely due\nto the recent reionisation of He-II in vicinity of these quasars, which have\nhard, non-thermal ionising spectra. The elevated temperatures may therefore\nrepresent evidence for the earliest stages of He-II reionisation in the most\nbiased regions of the high-redshift Universe. The temperature as a function of\ndistance from the quasars is consistent with being constant, log(T_0/K)~4.2,\nwith no evidence for a line-of-sight thermal proximity effect. However, the\nlimited extent of the quasar near-zones prevents the detection of He-III\nregions larger than ~5 proper Mpc. Under the assumption the quasars have\nreionised the He-II in their vicinity, we infer the data are consistent with an\naverage optically bright phase of duration in excess of 10^6.5 yr. These\nmeasurements represent the highest-redshift IGM temperature constraints to\ndate, and thus provide a valuable data set for confronting models of H-I\nreionisation.\n", "  Vibrational properties of ultralong Rydberg Cs$_2$ molecules are investigated\non corresponding potential curves obtained by perturbation theory. The Rydberg\nCs$_2$ molecules are associated by a Rydberg Cs($nS/nP$) atom $(n=30-70)$ and a\nground state Cs($6s$) atom. The starting point for the perturbation treatment\nof corresponding Rydberg molecular potential curves is to generate accurate\natomic Rydberg states from realistic {\\it ab initio} effective core potential.\nThe calculated results have similar characteristics with available experimental\nand theoretical investigations on Rydberg Rb$_2$ molecules. And this is the\nfirst time that Rydberg molecules are studied at the {\\it ab initio} level.\n", "  Despite being the prototype of its class, T Pyx is arguably the most unusual\nand poorly understood recurrent nova. Here, we use radio observations from the\nKarl G. Jansky Very Large Array to trace the evolution of the ejecta over the\ncourse of the 2011 outburst of T Pyx. The radio emission is broadly consistent\nwith thermal emission from the nova ejecta. However, the radio flux began\nrising surprisingly late in the outburst, indicating that the bulk of the\nradio-emitting material was either very cold, or expanding very slowly, for the\nfirst ~50 days of the outburst. Considering a plausible range of volume filling\nfactors and geometries for the ejecta, we find that the high peak flux\ndensities of the radio emission require a massive ejection of 1-30 x 10^{-5}\nsolar masses. This ejecta mass is much higher than the values normally\nassociated with recurrent novae, and is more consistent with a nova on a white\ndwarf well below the Chandrasekhar limit.\n", "  We push further our study of the all-order asymptotic expansion in beta\nmatrix models with a confining, offcritical potential, in the regime where the\nsupport of the equilibrium measure is a reunion of segments. We first address\nthe case where the filling fractions of those segments are fixed, and show the\nexistence of a 1/N expansion to all orders. Then, we study the asymptotic of\nthe sum over filling fractions, in order to obtain the full asymptotic\nexpansion for the initial problem in the multi-cut regime. We describe the\napplication of our results to study the all-order small dispersion asymptotics\nof solutions of the Toda chain related to the one hermitian matrix model (beta\n= 2) as well as orthogonal polynomials outside the bulk.\n", "  The competing influence of two types of interactions on surface diffusion is\ninvestigated: one of them, epsilon, acts between adsorbed particles, while the\nother one, eta, between activated and adsorbed particles. To this end, a\nspecific lattice-gas model on a triangular, square, and hexagonal lattice is\nconsidered with an attractive epsilon and an attractive or repulsive eta, both\nrestricted to nearest neighbors. For all three lattices the influence is\nqualitatively the same. Namely, when eta is neglected, then epsilon is shown to\ndecelerate diffusion with a rate exponential in epsilon and inverse\ntemperature. Moreover, when eta is present and epsilon is fixed, then a\nsufficiently attractive eta (relative to epsilon) accelerates diffusion\nexponentially fast in eta and inverse temperature. However, quite surprisingly,\na repulsive or slightly attractive eta has practically no effect on diffusion.\nFinally, when eta is set proportional to epsilon via a parameter $a$, surface\ndiffusion is exponentially accelerated (decelerated) for $a$ above (below) a\nthreshold value equal to 4, 5/4, and 7/8 for the three lattices. Thus, an eta\nof strength comparable to epsilon is enough to boost diffusion on the square\nand hexagonal lattices, while an eta of a rather large strength is needed for\nthe boost on the triangular lattice.\n", "  The cold dark matter (CDM) cosmological model has been remarkably successful\nin explaining cosmic structure over an enormous span of redshift, but it has\nfaced persistent challenges from observations that probe the innermost regions\nof dark matter halos and the properties of the Milky Way's dwarf galaxy\nsatellites. We review the current observational and theoretical status of these\n\"small scale controversies.\" Cosmological simulations that incorporate only\ngravity and collisionless CDM predict halos with abundant substructure and\ncentral densities that are too high to match constraints from galaxy dynamics.\nThe solution could lie in baryonic physics: recent numerical simulations and\nanalytic models suggest that gravitational potential fluctuations tied to\nefficient supernova feedback can flatten the central cusps of halos in massive\ngalaxies, and a combination of feedback and low star-formation efficiency could\nexplain why most of the dark matter subhalos orbiting the Milky Way do not host\nvisible galaxies. However, it is not clear that this solution can work in the\nlowest mass galaxies where discrepancies are observed. Alternatively, the\nsmall-scale conflicts could be evidence of more complex physics in the dark\nsector itself. For example, elastic scattering from strong dark matter\nself-interactions can alter predicted halo mass profiles, leading to good\nagreement with observations across a wide range of galaxy mass. Gravitational\nlensing and dynamical perturbations of tidal streams in the stellar halo\nprovide evidence for an abundant population of low mass subhalos in accord with\nCDM predictions. These observational approaches will get more powerful over the\nnext few years.\n", "  The radio light curves of novae rise and fall over the course of months to\nyears, allowing for detailed observations of the evolution of the nova shell.\nHowever, the main parameter determined by radio models of nova explosions - the\nmass of the ejecta - often seems to exceed theoretical expectations by an order\nof magnitude. With the recent technological improvements on the Karl G. Jansky\nVery Large Array (VLA), new observations can test the assumptions upon which\nejecta mass estimates are based. Early observations of the classical nova V1723\nAql showed an unexpectedly rapid rise in radio flux density and a distinct bump\nin the radio light curve on the rise to radio maximum, which is inconsistent\nwith the simple model of spherical ejecta expelled in a single discrete event.\nThis initial bump appears to indicate the presence of shocked material in the\nouter region of the ejected shell, with the emission from the shocks fading\nover time. We explore possible origins for this emission and its relation to\nthe mass loss history of the nova. The evolution of the radio spectrum also\nreveals the density profile, the mass of the ejected shell, and other\nproperties of the ejecta. These observations comprise one of the most complete,\nlongterm set of multi-wavelength radio observations for any classical nova to\ndate.\n", "  We provide a set of stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis calculations that\napplies established physics assumptions simultaneously to low- and\nintermediate-mass and massive star models. Our goal is to provide an internally\nconsistent and comprehensive nuclear production and yield data base for\napplications in areas such as pre-solar grain studies. Our non-rotating models\nassume convective boundary mixing where it has been adopted before. We include\n8 (12) initial masses for $Z = 0.01$ ($0.02$). Models are followed either until\nthe end of the asymptotic giant branch phase or the end of Si burning,\ncomplemented by a simple analytic core-collapse supernova models with two\noptions for fallback and shock velocities. The explosions show which\npre-supernova yields will most strongly be effected by the explosive\nnucleosynthesis. We discuss how these two explosion parameters impacts the\nlight elements and the $s$ and $p$ process. For low- and intermediate-mass\nmodels our stellar yields from H to Bi include the effect of convective\nboundary mixing at the He-intershell boundaries and the stellar evolution\nfeedback of the mixing process that produces the $^{13}$C pocket. All\npost-processing nucleosynthesis calculations use the same nuclear reaction rate\nnetwork and nuclear physics input. We provide a discussion of the nuclear\nproduction across the entire mass range organized by element group. All our\nstellar nucleosynthesis profile and time evolution output is available\nelectronically, and tools to explore the data on the NuGrid VOspace hosted by\nthe Canadian Astronomical Data Centre are introduced.\n", "  The origin of negative thermal expansion (NTE) in the bond frustrated\nZnCr2Se4 has been explored. ESR and FTIR document an ideal paramagnetic state\nabove 100 K, below which ferromagnetic clusters coexist with the paramagnetic\nstate down to TN. By fitting the inverse susceptibility above 100 K using a\nmodified paramagnetic Curie-Weiss law, an exponentially changeable exchange\nintegral J is deduced. In the case of the variable J, magnetic exchange and\nlattice elastic energy couple with each other effectively via magnetoelastic\ninteraction in the ferromagnetic clusters, where NTE occurs at a loss of\nexchange energy while a gain of lattice elastic one.\n", "  The recurrent nova T Pyx underwent its sixth historical outburst in 2011, and\nbecame the subject of an intensive multi-wavelength observational campaign. We\nanalyze data from the Swift and Suzaku satellites to produce a detailed X-ray\nlight curve augmented by epochs of spectral information. X-ray observations\nyield mostly non-detections in the first four months of outburst, but both a\nsuper-soft and hard X-ray component rise rapidly after Day 115. The super-soft\nX-ray component, attributable to the photosphere of the nuclear-burning white\ndwarf, is relatively cool (~45 eV) and implies that the white dwarf in T Pyx is\nsignificantly below the Chandrasekhar mass (~1 M_sun). The late turn-on time of\nthe super-soft component yields a large nova ejecta mass (>~10^-5 M_sun),\nconsistent with estimates at other wavelengths. The hard X-ray component is\nwell fit by a ~1 keV thermal plasma, and is attributed to shocks internal to\nthe 2011 nova ejecta. The presence of a strong oxygen line in this thermal\nplasma on Day 194 requires a significantly super-solar abundance of oxygen and\nimplies that the ejecta are polluted by white dwarf material. The X-ray light\ncurve can be explained by a dual-phase ejection, with a significant delay\nbetween the first and second ejection phases, and the second ejection finally\nreleased two months after outburst. A delayed ejection is consistent with\noptical and radio observations of T Pyx, but the physical mechanism producing\nsuch a delay remains a mystery.\n", "  Random access coding is an information task that has been extensively studied\nand found many applications in quantum information. In this scenario, Alice\nreceives an $n$-bit string $x$, and wishes to encode $x$ into a quantum state\n$\\rho_x$, such that Bob, when receiving the state $\\rho_x$, can choose any bit\n$i \\in [n]$ and recover the input bit $x_i$ with high probability. Here we\nstudy two variants: parity-oblivious random access codes, where we impose the\ncryptographic property that Bob cannot infer any information about the parity\nof any subset of bits of the input apart from the single bits $x_i$; and\neven-parity-oblivious random access codes, where Bob cannot infer any\ninformation about the parity of any even-size subset of bits of the input.\n  In this paper, we provide the optimal bounds for parity-oblivious quantum\nrandom access codes and show that they are asymptotically better than the\noptimal classical ones. Our results provide a large non-contextuality\ninequality violation and resolve the main open problem in a work of Spekkens,\nBuzacott, Keehn, Toner, and Pryde (2009). Second, we provide the optimal bounds\nfor even-parity-oblivious random access codes by proving their equivalence to a\nnon-local game and by providing tight bounds for the success probability of the\nnon-local game via semidefinite programming. In the case of\neven-parity-oblivious random access codes, the cryptographic property holds\nalso in the device-independent model.\n", "  Recently, the longstanding Gaussian optimizer conjecture was proven for\nbosonic Gaussian gauge-covariant or contravariant channels in the work of\nGiovannetti, Holevo and Garcia-Patron [3]. In the paper of Mari, Giovannetti\nand Holevo [11] this result was strengthened for one-mode channels by\nestablishing that the output for the vacuum or coherent input majorizes the\noutput for any other input.\n  In the present paper we give the multimode extension of the result of [11],\nincluding sufficient conditions under which the coherent states are the only\noptimizers. We also discuss direct implications of this multimode majorization\nresult to the positive solution of the additivity problem for the Gaussian\nchannels. In particular, we demonstrate the additivity of the output Renyi\nentropies of arbitrary order p>1. Finally, we present an alternative derivation\nof a majorization property of Glauber's coherent states by Lieb and Solovej\n[10], basing on the method of the work [3].\n", "  We describe the method devised to reconstruct inclined cosmic-ray air showers\nwith zenith angles greater than $60^\\circ$ detected with the surface array of\nthe Pierre Auger Observatory. The measured signals at the ground level are\nfitted to muon density distributions predicted with atmospheric cascade models\nto obtain the relative shower size as an overall normalization parameter. The\nmethod is evaluated using simulated showers to test its performance. The energy\nof the cosmic rays is calibrated using a sub-sample of events reconstructed\nwith both the fluorescence and surface array techniques. The reconstruction\nmethod described here provides the basis of complementary analyses including an\nindependent measurement of the energy spectrum of ultra-high energy cosmic rays\nusing very inclined events collected by the Pierre Auger Observatory.\n", "  Classical novae are the most common astrophysical thermonuclear explosions,\noccurring on the surfaces of white dwarf stars accreting gas from companions in\nbinary star systems. Novae typically expel ~10^(-4) solar masses of material at\nvelocities exceeding 1,000 kilometres per second. However, the mechanism of\nmass ejection in novae is poorly understood, and could be dominated by the\nimpulsive flash of thermonuclear energy, prolonged optically thick winds, or\nbinary interaction with the nova envelope. Classical novae are now routinely\ndetected in gigaelectronvolt gamma-ray wavelengths, suggesting that\nrelativistic particles are accelerated by strong shocks in the ejecta. Here we\nreport high-resolution radio imaging of the gamma-ray-emitting nova V959 Mon.\nWe find that its ejecta were shaped by the motion of the binary system: some\ngas was expelled rapidly along the poles as a wind from the white dwarf, while\ndenser material drifted out along the equatorial plane, propelled by orbital\nmotion. At the interface between the equatorial and polar regions, we observe\nsynchrotron emission indicative of shocks and relativistic particle\nacceleration, thereby pinpointing the location of gamma-ray production. Binary\nshaping of the nova ejecta and associated internal shocks are expected to be\nwidespread among novae, explaining why many novae are gamma-ray emitters.\n", "  Theoretical models of the spin-orbital liquid (SOL) FeSc$_2$S$_4$ have\npredicted it to be in close proximity to a quantum critical point separating a\nspin-orbital liquid phase from a long-range ordered magnetic phase. Here, we\nexamine the magnetic excitations of FeSc$_2$S$_4$ through time-domain terahertz\nspectroscopy under an applied magnetic field. At low temperatures an excitation\nemerges that we attribute to a singlet-triplet excitation from the SOL ground\nstate. A three-fold splitting of this excitation is observed as a function of\napplied magnetic field. As singlet-triplet excitations are forbidden in\ninversion symmetric pure spin systems, our results demonstrate the non-trivial\ncharacter of the entangled spin-orbital singlet ground state. Using\nexperimentally obtained parameters we compare to existing theoretical models to\ndetermine FeSc$_2$S$_4$'s proximity to the quantum critical point. In the\ncontext of these models, we estimate that the characteristic length of the\nsinglet correlations to be $\\xi/ (\\textbf{a}/2) \\approx 8.2$ (where\n$\\textbf{a}/2$ is the nearest neighbor lattice constant) which establishes\nFeSc$_2$S$_4$ as a SOL with long-range entanglement.\n", "  With references to both key and oft-forgotten pioneering works, this article\nstarts by presenting a review into how we came to believe in the existence of\nmassive black holes at the centres of galaxies. It then presents the historical\ndevelopment of the near-linear (black hole)-(host spheroid) mass relation,\nbefore explaining why this has recently been dramatically revised. Past\ndisagreement over the slope of the (black hole)-(velocity dispersion) relation\nis also explained, and the discovery of sub-structure within the (black\nhole)-(velocity dispersion) diagram is discussed. As the search for the\nfundamental connection between massive black holes and their host galaxies\ncontinues, the competing array of additional black hole mass scaling relations\nfor samples of predominantly inactive galaxies are presented.\n", "  The contribution of the different terms of the running-coupling\nBalistky-Kovchegov (rcBK) equation to the description of inclusive HERA data is\ndiscussed. Within this framework an alternative definition of the saturation\nscale is presented. The definition is based on the ratio of the term\ncorresponding to the recombination of two dipoles to the term corresponding to\na dipole splitting. A similar ratio is used to study the contribution of the\nrecombination term to the evolution of inclusive HERA data with rapidity. It is\nfound that, although the data are well described, the behaviour of the\ndifferent terms of the rcBK equation for HERA kinematics is not what it is\nnaively expected from saturation arguments.\n", "  It is generally assumed that a condensate of paired fermions at equilibrium\nis characterized by a macroscopic wavefunction with a well-defined, immutable\nphase. In reality, all systems have a finite size and are prepared at non-zero\ntemperature; the condensate has then a finite coherence time, even when the\nsystem is isolated in its evolution and the particle number $N$ is fixed. The\nloss of phase memory is due to interactions of the condensate with the excited\nmodes that constitute a dephasing environment. This fundamental effect, crucial\nfor applications using the condensate of pairs' macroscopic coherence, was\nscarcely studied. We link the coherence time to the condensate phase dynamics,\nand we show with a microscopic theory that the time derivative of the\ncondensate phase operator $\\hat{\\theta}\\_0$ is proportional to a chemical\npotential operator that we construct including both the pair-breaking and\npair-motion excitation branches. In a single realization of energy $E$,\n$\\hat{\\theta}\\_0$ evolves at long times as $-2\\mu\\_{\\rm mc}(E)t/\\hbar$ where\n$\\mu\\_{\\rm mc}(E)$ is the microcanonical chemical potential; energy\nfluctuations from one realization to the other then lead to a ballistic\nspreading of the phase and to a Gaussian decay of the temporal coherence\nfunction with a characteristic time $\\propto N^{1/2}$. In the absence of energy\nfluctuations, the coherence time scales as $N$ due to the diffusive motion of\n$\\hat{\\theta}\\_0$. We propose a method to measure the coherence time with\nultracold atoms, which we predict to be tens of milliseconds for the canonical\nensemble unitary Fermi gas.\n", "  We study the generation of magnetic field in the primordial plasma of the\nstandard model (SM) particles at temperature $T>80$~TeV much higher than the\nelectroweak scale. It is assumed that there is an excess number of right-handed\nelectrons over left-handed positrons in the plasma. Using the Berry-curvature\nmodified kinetic theory to incorporate the effect of the Abelian anomaly, we\nshow that this chiral-imbalance leads to generation of hyper-magnetic field in\nthe plasma in both the collision dominated and the collisionless regimes. It is\nshown that in the collision dominated regime the chiral-vorticity effect can\ngenerate finite vorticity in the plasma together with the magnetic field.\nTypical strength of the generated magnetic field is $10^{27}$~Gauss at $T\\sim\n80$~TeV with the length scale $10^5/T$ whereas the Hubble length scale is\n$10^{13}/T$. Further the instability can also generate the magnetic field of\norder $10^{31}$~Gauss at typical length scale $10/T$. But there may not be any\nvorticity generation in this regime. We show that the estimated values of the\nmagnetic field are consistent with the bounds obtained from present\nobservations.\n", "  We recently identified a population of low surface brightness objects in the\nfield of the z=0.023 Coma cluster, using the Dragonfly Telephoto Array. Here we\npresent Keck spectroscopy of one of the largest of these \"ultra-diffuse\ngalaxies\" (UDGs), confirming that it is a member of the cluster. The galaxy has\nprominent absorption features, including the Ca II H+K lines and the G-band,\nand no detected emission lines. Its radial velocity of cz=6280 +- 120 km/s is\nwithin the 1 sigma velocity dispersion of the Coma cluster. The galaxy has an\neffective radius of 4.3 +- 0.3 kpc and a Sersic index of 0.89 +- 0.06, as\nmeasured from Keck imaging. We find no indications of tidal tails or other\ndistortions, at least out to a radius of ~2 r_e. We show that UDGs are located\nin a previously sparsely populated region of the size - magnitude plane of\nquiescent stellar systems, as they are ~6 magnitudes fainter than normal\nearly-type galaxies of the same size. It appears that the luminosity\ndistribution of large quiescent galaxies is not continuous, although this could\nlargely be due to selection effects. Dynamical measurements are needed to\ndetermine whether the dark matter halos of UDGs are similar to those of\ngalaxies with the same luminosity or to those of galaxies with the same size.\n", "  Analyzing the physical and chemical properties of single DNA based molecular\nmachines such as polymerases and helicases often necessitates to track stepping\nmotion on the length scale of base pairs. Although high resolution instruments\nhave been developed that are capable of reaching that limit, individual steps\nare oftentimes hidden by experimental noise which complicates data processing.\nHere, we present an effective two-step algorithm which detects steps in a high\nbandwidth signal by minimizing an energy based model (Energy based step-finder,\nEBS). First, an efficient convex denoising scheme is applied which allows\ncompression to tupels of amplitudes and plateau lengths. Second, a\ncombinatorial optimization algorithm formulated on a graph is used to assign\nsteps to the tupel data while accounting for prior information. Performance of\nthe algorithm was tested on poissonian stepping data simulated based on\npublished kinetics data of RNA Polymerase II (Pol II). Comparison to existing\nstep-finding methods shows that EBS is superior both in speed and precision.\nMoreover, the capability to detect backtracked intervals in experimental data\nof Pol II as well as to detect stepping behavior of the Phi29 DNA packaging\nmotor is demonstrated.\n", "  In a previous paper, we developed tools for studying the horizon geometry of\na Kerr black hole that is tidally distorted by a binary companion using\ntechniques that require large mass ratios but can be applied to any bound orbit\nand allow for arbitrary black hole spin. We now apply these tools to generic\nKerr black hole orbits. This allows us to investigate horizon dynamics: the\ntidal field perturbing the horizon's geometry varies over a generic orbit, with\nsignificant variations for eccentric orbits. Many of the features of the\nhorizon's behavior found previously carry over to the dynamical case in a\nnatural way. In particular, we find significant offsets between the applied\ntide and the horizon's response. This leads to bulging in the horizon's\ngeometry which can lag or lead the orbit, depending upon the hole's rotation\nand the orbit's geometry. An interesting and apparently new feature we find are\nsmall-amplitude, high-frequency oscillations in the horizon's response. We have\nnot been able to identify a mechanism for producing these oscillations, but\nfind that they appear most clearly when rapidly rotating black holes are\ndistorted by very strong-field orbits.\n", "  In this lecture I discuss the bulk surface heterogeneity of rotating stars,\nnamely gravity darkening. I especially detail the derivation of the omega-model\nof Espinosa Lara & Rieutord (2011), which gives the gravity darkening in\nearly-type stars. I also discuss the problem of deriving gravity darkening in\nstars owning a convective envelope and in those that are members of a binary\nsystem.\n", "  To study the atomic, molecular and ionized emission of Giant Molecular Clouds\n(GMCs), we have initiated a Large Program with the VLA: 'THOR - The HI, OH,\nRecombination Line survey of the Milky Way'. We map the 21cm HI line, 4 OH\nlines, 19 H_alpha recombination lines and the continuum from 1 to 2 GHz of a\nsignificant fraction of the Milky Way (l=15-67deg, |b|<1deg) at ~20\"\nresolution. In this paper, we focus on the HI emission from the W43\nstar-formation complex. Classically, the HI 21cm line is treated as optically\nthin with column densities calculated under this assumption. This might give\nreasonable results for regions of low-mass star-formation, however, it is not\nsufficient to describe GMCs. We analyzed strong continuum sources to measure\nthe optical depth, and thus correct the HI 21cm emission for optical depth\neffects and weak diffuse continuum emission. Hence, we are able to measure the\nHI mass of W43 more accurately and our analysis reveals a lower limit of\nM=6.6x10^6 M_sun, which is a factor of 2.4 larger than the mass estimated with\nthe assumption of optically thin emission. The HI column densities are as high\nas N(HI)~150 M_sun/pc^2 ~ 1.9x10^22 cm^-2, which is an order of magnitude\nhigher than for low mass star formation regions. This result challenges\ntheoretical models that predict a threshold for the HI column density of ~10\nM_sun/pc^2, at which the formation of molecular hydrogen should set in. By\nassuming an elliptical layered structure for W43, we estimate the particle\ndensity profiles. While at the cloud edge atomic and molecular hydrogen are\nwell mixed, the center of the cloud is strongly dominated by molecular\nhydrogen. We do not identify a sharp transition between hydrogen in atomic and\nmolecular form. Our results are an important characterization of the atomic to\nmolecular hydrogen transition in an extreme environment and challenges current\ntheoretical models.\n", "  We propose an experimental protocol to study $p$-wave superfluidity in a\nspin-polarized cold Fermi gas tuned by an $s$-wave Feshbach resonance. A\ncrucial ingredient is to add a quasi-1D optical lattice and tune the fillings\nof two spins to the $s$ and $p$ band, respectively. The pairing order parameter\nis confirmed to inherit $p$-wave symmetry in its center-of-mass motion. We find\nthat it can further develop into a state of unexpected $\\pi$-phase modulation\nin a broad parameter regime. Measurable quantities are calculated, including\ntime-of-flight distributions, radio-frequency spectra, and in situ\nphase-contrast imaging in an external trap. The $\\pi$-phase $p$-wave superfluid\nis reminiscent of the $\\pi$-state in superconductor-ferromagnet\nheterostructures but differs in symmetry and origin. If observed, it would\nrepresent another example of $p$-wave pairing, first discovered in He-3\nliquids.\n", "  The Higgs boson, recently discovered with a mass of 125.09$\\pm$0.24 GeV is\nknown to mediate the masses of elementary particles, but only 2% of the mass of\nthe nucleon. Extending a previous investigation [1] and including the\nstrange-quark sector, hadron masses are derived from the quark condensate of\nthe QCD vacuum and from the effects of the Higgs boson. These calculations\ninclude the $\\pi$ meson, the nucleon and the scalar mesons $\\sigma(600)$,\n$\\kappa(800)$, $a_0(980)$ $f_0(980)$ and $f_0(1370)$. The predicted second\n$\\sigma$ meson $\\sigma'(1344)=|s\\bar{s}\\rangle$, is investigated and identified\nwith the $f_0(1370)$ meson. An outlook is given on the hyperons $\\Lambda$,\n$\\Sigma^{0,\\pm}$ and $\\Xi^{0,-}$.\n", "  Why is natural supersymmetry neither detected nor ruled-out to date? To\nanswer this question we use the Bayesian approach where the emphasis on finding\nprior-independent features within broader and minimally biased frames is taken\nas the guiding principle. The 20-parameter minimal supersymmetric standard\nmodel (MSSM) fits to subjective naturalness indicate the existence of a\nprior-independent upper bound on the pseudoscalar Higgs boson mass $m_A$ as a\nfunction of $\\tan \\beta$, the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the\nMSSM Higgs doublets. For a 30-parameter MSSM this implies that $m_A \\lesssim 3$\nTeV and $\\tan \\beta \\lesssim 25$ at 95\\% Bayesian confidence. Removing the\ncontradictory subjectiveness within the electroweak fine-tuning measure leads\nto finding the naturalness line, $m_A \\sim \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\, m_Z \\, \\tan\n\\beta,$ that reduces by one the number of MSSM Higgs sector free parameters.\n", "  Parafermions are the simplest generalizations of Majorana fermions that\nrealize topological order. We propose a less restrictive notion of topological\norder in 1D open chains, which generalizes the seminal work by Fendley [J.\nStat. Mech., P11020 (2012)]. The first essential property is that the\ngroundstates are mutually indistinguishable by local, symmetric probes, and the\nsecond is a generalized notion of zero edge modes which cyclically permute the\ngroundstates. These two properties are shown to be topologically robust, and\napplicable to a wider family of topologically-ordered Hamiltonians than has\nbeen previously considered. An an application of these edge modes, we formulate\na new notion of twisted boundary conditions on a closed chain, which guarantees\nthat the closed-chain groundstate is topological, i.e., it originates from the\ntopological manifold of degenerate states on the open chain. Finally, we\ngeneralize these ideas to describe symmetry-breaking phases with a\nparafermionic order parameter. These exotic phases are condensates of\nparafermion multiplets, which generalizes Cooper pairing in superconductors.\nThe stability of these condensates are investigated on both open and closed\nchains.\n", "  Solar Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) radiation creates the conducting E-layer of\nthe ionosphere, mainly by photo ionization of molecular Oxygen. Solar heating\nof the ionosphere creates thermal winds which by dynamo action induce an\nelectric field driving an electric current having a magnetic effect observable\non the ground, as was discovered by G. Graham in 1722. The current rises and\nsets with the Sun and thus causes a readily observable diurnal variation of the\ngeomagnetic field, allowing us the deduce the conductivity and thus the EUV\nflux as far back as reliable magnetic data reach. High-quality data go back to\nthe 'Magnetic Crusade' of the 1830s and less reliable, but still usable, data\nare available for portions of the hundred years before that. J.R. Wolf and,\nindependently, J.-A. Gautier discovered the dependence of the diurnal variation\non solar activity, and today we understand and can invert that relationship to\nconstruct a reliable record of the EUV flux from the geomagnetic record. We\ncompare that to the F10.7 flux and the sunspot number, and find that the\nreconstructed EUV flux reproduces the F10.7 flux with great accuracy. On the\nother hand, it appears that the Relative Sunspot Number as currently defined is\nbeginning to no longer be a faithful representation of solar magnetic activity,\nat least as measured by the EUV and related indices. The reconstruction\nsuggests that the EUV flux reaches the same low (but non-zero) value at every\nsunspot minimum (possibly including Grand Minima), representing an invariant\n'solar magnetic ground state'.\n", "  An edge state is a time-harmonic solution of a conservative wave system, e.g.\nSchroedinger, Maxwell, which is propagating (plane-wave-like) parallel to, and\nlocalized transverse to, a line-defect or \"edge\". Topologically protected edge\nstates are edge states which are stable against spatially localized (even\nstrong) deformations of the edge. First studied in the context of the quantum\nHall effect, protected edge states have attracted huge interest due to their\nrole in the field of topological insulators. Theoretical understanding of\ntopological protection has mainly come from discrete (tight-binding) models and\ndirect numerical simulation. In this paper we consider a rich family of\ncontinuum PDE models for which we rigorously study regimes where topologically\nprotected edge states exist. Our model is a class of Schroedinger operators on\n$\\mathbb{R}^2$ with a background 2D honeycomb potential perturbed by an\n\"edge-potential\". The edge potential is a domain-wall interpolation, transverse\nto a prescribed \"rational\" edge, between two distinct periodic structures.\nGeneral conditions are given for the bifurcation of a branch of topologically\nprotected edge states from Dirac points of the background honeycomb structure.\nThe bifurcation is seeded by the zero mode of a 1D effective Dirac operator. A\nkey condition is a spectral no-fold condition for the prescribed edge. We then\nuse this result to prove the existence of topologically protected edge states\nalong zigzag edges of certain honeycomb structures. Our results are consistent\nwith the physics literature and appear to be the first rigorous results on the\nexistence of topologically protected edge states for continuum 2D PDE systems\ndescribing waves in a non-trivial periodic medium. We also show that the family\nof Hamiltonians we study contains cases where zigzag edge states exist, but\nwhich are not topologically protected.\n", "  We employ a more realistic treatment to investigate the entropy and the\nexcitation-inversion of a coupled system that consists of a nanomechanical\nresonator and a superconducting Cooper pair box. The procedure uses the\nBuck-Sukumar model in the microwave domain, considers the nanoresonator with a\ntime dependent frequency and both subsystems in the presence of losses.\nInteresting results were found for the temporal evolutions of the entropy of\neach subsystem and of the excitation-inversion in the Cooper pair box. A\ncomparison was also performed about which of these two subsystems is more\nsensitive to the presence of losses. The results suggest that appropriate\nchoices of the involved time dependent parameters allow us to monitor these two\nfeatures of the subsystems and may offer potential applications, e.g., in the\ngeneration of nonclassical states, quantum communication, quantum lithography.\n", "  The large observed redshift of quasars has suggested large cosmological\ndistances and a corresponding enormous energy output to explain the brightness\nor luminosity as seen at earth. Alternative or complementary sources of\nredshift have not been identified by the astronomical community. This study\nexamines one possible source of additional redshift: an intrinsic component\nbased on the plasma characteristics of high temperature and high electron\ndensity which are believed to be present.\n", "  We investigate if the hemispherical asymmetry in the CMB is produced from\n\"asymmetric\" excited initial condition. We show that in the limit where the\ndeviations from the Bunch-Davies vacuum is large and the scale of new physics\nis maximally separated from the inflationary Hubble parameter, the primordial\npower spectrum is modulated only by position dependent dipole and quadrupole\nterms. Requiring the dipole contribution in the power spectrum to account for\nthe observed power asymmetry, $A=0.07\\pm0.022$, we show that the amount of\nquadrupole terms is roughly equal to $A^2$. The {\\it mean} local bispectrum,\nwhich gets enhanced for the excited initial state, is within the $1\\sigma$\nbound of Planck 2015 results for a large field model, $f_{\\rm NL}\\simeq 4.17$,\nbut is reachable by future CMB experiments. The amplitude of the local\nnon-gaussianity modulates around this mean value, depending on the angle that\nthe correlated patches on the 2d CMB surface make with the preferred direction.\nThe amount of variation minimizes for the configuration in which the short and\nlong wavelengths modes are around the preferred pole and $|\\vec k_3|\\approx\n|\\vec k_{l\\approx10}|\\ll |\\vec k_1|\\approx |\\vec k_2|\\approx |\\vec\nk_{l\\approx2500}|$ with $f_{\\rm NL}^{\\rm min}\\approx 3.64 $. The maximum occurs\nwhen these modes are at the antipode of the preferred pole, $f_{\\rm NL}^{\\rm\nmax}\\approx 4.81$ . The difference of non-gaussianity between these two\nconfigurations is as large as $\\simeq 1.17$ which can be used to distinguish\nthis scenario from other scenarios that try to explain the observed\nhemispherical asymmetry.\n", "  We use computer simulations to analyse the yielding transition during\nlarge-amplitude oscillatory shear of a simple model for soft jammed solids.\nSimultaneous analysis of global mechanical response and particle-scale motion\ndemonstrates that macroscopic yielding, revealed by a smooth crossover in\nmechanical properties, is accompanied by a sudden change in the particle\ndynamics, which evolves from non-diffusive motion to irreversible diffusion as\nthe amplitude of the shear is increased. We provide numerical evidence that\nthis sharp change corresponds to a non-equilibrium first-order dynamic phase\ntransition, thus establishing the existence of a well-defined microscopic\ndynamic signature of the yielding transition in amorphous materials in\noscillatory shear.\n", "  The quantum circuit model allows gates between any pair of qubits yet\nphysical instantiations allow only limited interactions. We address this\nproblem by providing an interaction graph together with an efficient method for\ncompiling quantum circuits so that gates are applied only locally. The graph\nrequires each qubit to interact with 4 other qubits and yet the time-overhead\nfor implementing any n-qubit quantum circuit is 6 log n. Building a network of\nquantum computing nodes according to this graph enables the network to emulate\na single monolithic device with minimal overhead.\n", "  We study the electronic structures of TiO2/Ti4O7 and Ta2O5/TaO2 interfaces\nusing the screened exchange (sX-LDA) functional. Both of these bilayer\nstructures are useful infrastructures for high performance RRAMs. We find that\nthe system Fermi energies of both interfaces are just above the conduction band\nedge of the corresponding stoichiometric oxides. According to the charge\ntransition levels of the oxygen vacancies in Ta2O5 and TiO2, the oxygen\nvacancies are stabilized at the -2 charged state. We propose to introduce\ninterfacial dopants to shift the system Fermi energies downward so that the +2\ncharged oxygen vacancy can be stable, which is important for the controlled\nswitching under the electrical field. Several dipole models are presented to\naccount for the ability of Fermi level shift due to the interfacial dopants.\n", "  In the framework of scalar-tensor theories of gravity, we construct a new\nkind of cosmological model that conflates inflation and ekpyrosis. During a\nphase of conflation, the universe undergoes accelerated expansion, but with\ncrucial differences compared to ordinary inflation. In particular, the\npotential energy is negative, which is of interest for supergravity and string\ntheory where both negative potentials and the required scalar-tensor couplings\nare rather natural. A distinguishing feature of the model is that, for a large\nparameter range, it does not significantly amplify adiabatic scalar and tensor\nfluctuations, and in particular does not lead to eternal inflation and the\nassociated infinities. We also show how density fluctuations in accord with\ncurrent observations may be generated by adding a second scalar field to the\nmodel. Conflation may be viewed as complementary to the recently proposed\nanamorphic universe of Ijjas and Steinhardt.\n", "  Complex projective t-designs, particularly SICs and full sets of MUBs, play\nan important role in quantum information. We introduce a generalization which\nwe call conical t-designs. They include arbitrary rank symmetric\ninformationally complete measurements (SIMs) and full sets of arbitrary rank\nmutually unbiased measurements (MUMs). They are deeply implicated in the\ndescription of entanglement (as we show in a subsequent paper). Viewed in one\nway a conical 2-design is a symmetric decomposition of a separable Werner state\n(up to a normalization factor). Viewed in another way it is a certain kind of\npolytope in the Bloch body. In the Bloch body picture SIMs and full sets of\nMUMs form highly symmetric polytopes (a single regular simplex in the one case;\nthe convex hull of a set of orthogonal regular simplices in the other). We give\nthe necessary and sufficient conditions for an arbitrary polytope to be what we\ncall a homogeneous conical 2-design. This suggests a way to search for new\nkinds of projective 2-design.\n", "  We present photometric redshift estimates for galaxies used in the weak\nlensing analysis of the Dark Energy Survey Science Verification (DES SV) data.\nFour model- or machine learning-based photometric redshift methods -- ANNZ2,\nBPZ calibrated against BCC-Ufig simulations, SkyNet, and TPZ -- are analysed.\nFor training, calibration, and testing of these methods, we construct a\ncatalogue of spectroscopically confirmed galaxies matched against DES SV data.\nThe performance of the methods is evaluated against the matched spectroscopic\ncatalogue, focusing on metrics relevant for weak lensing analyses, with\nadditional validation against COSMOS photo-zs. From the galaxies in the DES SV\nshear catalogue, which have mean redshift $0.72\\pm0.01$ over the range\n$0.3<z<1.3$, we construct three tomographic bins with means of $z=\\{0.45, 0.67,\n1.00\\}$. These bins each have systematic uncertainties $\\delta z \\lesssim 0.05$\nin the mean of the fiducial SkyNet photo-z $n(z)$. We propagate the errors in\nthe redshift distributions through to their impact on cosmological parameters\nestimated with cosmic shear, and find that they cause shifts in the value of\n$\\sigma_8$ of approx. 3%. This shift is within the one sigma statistical errors\non $\\sigma_8$ for the DES SV shear catalog. We further study the potential\nimpact of systematic differences on the critical surface density,\n$\\Sigma_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, finding levels of bias safely less than the\nstatistical power of DES SV data. We recommend a final Gaussian prior for the\nphoto-z bias in the mean of $n(z)$ of width $0.05$ for each of the three\ntomographic bins, and show that this is a sufficient bias model for the\ncorresponding cosmology analysis.\n", "  Data from social media are providing unprecedented opportunities to\ninvestigate the processes that rule the dynamics of collective social\nphenomena. Here, we consider an information theoretical approach to define and\nmeasure the temporal and structural signatures typical of collective social\nevents as they arise and gain prominence. We use the symbolic transfer entropy\nanalysis of micro-blogging time series to extract directed networks of\ninfluence among geolocalized sub-units in social systems. This methodology\ncaptures the emergence of system-level dynamics close to the onset of socially\nrelevant collective phenomena. The framework is validated against a detailed\nempirical analysis of five case studies. In particular, we identify a change in\nthe characteristic time-scale of the information transfer that flags the onset\nof information-driven collective phenomena. Furthermore, our approach\nidentifies an order-disorder transition in the directed network of influence\nbetween social sub-units. In the absence of a clear exogenous driving, social\ncollective phenomena can be represented as endogenously-driven structural\ntransitions of the information transfer network. This study provides results\nthat can help define models and predictive algorithms for the analysis of\nsocietal events based on open source data.\n", "  A number of applications require the computation of the trace of a matrix\nthat is implicitly available through a function. A common example of a function\nis the inverse of a large, sparse matrix, which is the focus of this paper.\nWhen the evaluation of the function is expensive, the task is computationally\nchallenging because the standard approach is based on a Monte Carlo method\nwhich converges slowly. We present a different approach that exploits the\npattern correlation, if present, between the diagonal of the inverse of the\nmatrix and the diagonal of some approximate inverse that can be computed\ninexpensively. We leverage various sampling and fitting techniques to fit the\ndiagonal of the approximation to the diagonal of the inverse. Depending on the\nquality of the approximate inverse, our method may serve as a standalone kernel\nfor providing a fast trace estimate with a small number of samples.\nFurthermore, the method can be used as a variance reduction method for Monte\nCarlo in some cases. This is decided dynamically by our algorithm. An extensive\nset of experiments with various technique combinations on several matrices from\nsome real applications demonstrate the potential of our method.\n", "  In terms of Sturm's theorem, we reexamine a marginal stable circular orbit\n(MSCO) such as the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of a timelike\ngeodesic in any spherically symmetric and static spacetime. MSCOs for some of\nexact solutions to the Einstein's equation are discussed. Strum's theorem is\nexplicitly applied to the Kottler (often called Schwarzschild-de Sitter)\nspacetime. Moreover, we analyze MSCOs for a spherically symmetric, static and\nvacuum solution in Weyl conformal gravity.\n", "  We study two-stream instabilities in a non-equilibrium system in which a\nstream of electrons is injected into doped graphene. As with equivalent\nnon-equilibrium parabolic band systems, we find that the graphene systems can\nsupport unstable charge-density waves whose amplitudes grow with time. We\ndetermine the range of wavevector $\\boldsymbol{q}$ that are unstable, and their\ngrowth rates. We find no instability for waves with wavevectors parallel or\nperpendicular to the direction of the injected carriers. We find that, within\nthe small wavevector approximation, the angle between $\\boldsymbol{q}$ and the\ndirection of the injected electrons that maximizes the growth rate increases\nwith increasing $\\boldsymbol{|q|}$. We compare the range and strength of the\ninstability in graphene to that of two and three dimensional parabolic band\nsystems.\n", "  For a Dirac theory of quantum gravity obtained from the refined algebraic\nquantization procedure, we propose a quantum notion of Cauchy surfaces. In such\na theory, there is a kernel projector for the quantized scalar and momentum\nconstraints, which maps the kinematic Hilbert space $\\mathbb K$ into the\nphysical Hilbert space $\\mathbb H$. Under this projection, a quantum Cauchy\nsurface isomorphically represents $\\mathbb H$ with a kinematic subspace\n$\\mathbb V \\subset\\mathbb K$. The isomorphism induces the complete sets of\nDirac observables in $\\mathbb D$, which faithfully represent the corresponding\ncomplete sets of self-adjoint operators in $\\mathbb V$. Due to the constraints,\na specific subset of the observables would be \"frozen\" as number operators,\nproviding a background physical time for the rest of the observables.\nTherefore, a proper foliation with the quantum Cauchy surfaces may provide an\nobserver frame describing the physical states of spacetimes in a Schr\\\"odinger\npicture, with the evolutions under a specific physical background. A simple\nmodel will be supplied as an initiative trial.\n", "  We apply the $AdS/CFT$ holography to the simplest possible eternal time\nmachine solution in $AdS_3$ based on two conical defects moving around their\ncenter of mass along a circular orbit. Closed timelike curves in this\nspace-time extend all the way to the boundary of $AdS_3$, violating causality\nof the boundary field theory. By use of the geodesic approximation we address\nthe \"grandfather paradox\" in the dual $1+1$ dimensional field theory and\ncalculate the two-point retarded Green function. It has a non-trivial\nanalytical structure both at negative and positive times, providing us with an\nintuition on how an interacting quantum field could behave once causality is\nbroken. In contrast with the previous considerations our calculations reveal\nthe possibility of a consistent and controllable evolution of a quantum system\nwithout any need to impose additional consistency constraints.\n", "  We study the q-state Potts model on the simple cubic lattice with\nferromagnetic interactions in one lattice direction, and antiferromagnetic\ninteractions in the two other directions. As the temperature T decreases, the\nsystem undergoes a second-order phase transition that fits in the universality\nclass of the 3D O(n) model with n=q-1. This conclusion is based on the\nestimated critical exponents, and histograms of the order parameter. At even\nsmaller T we find, for q=4 and 5, a first-order transition to a phase with a\ndifferent type of long-range order. This long-range order dissolves at T=0, and\nthe system effectively reduces to a disordered two-dimensional Potts\nantiferromagnet. These results are obtained by means of Monte Carlo simulations\nand finite-size scaling.\n", "  Fe doped GST has shown experimentally the ability to alter its magnetic\nproperties by phase change. In this work, we use screened exchange hybrid\nfunctional to study the single neutral substitutional 3d transition metal (TM)\nin crystalline GeTe and GeSb2Te4. By curing the problem of local density\nfunctional (LDA) such as over delocalization of the 3d states, we find that Fe\non Ge/Sb site has its majority d states fully occupied while its minority d\nstates are empty, which is different than previous predicted electronic\nconfiguration by LDA. From early transition metal Cr to heavier Ni, the\nmajority 3d states are gradually populated until fully occupied and then the\nminority 3d states begin to be filled. In order to study the magnetic contrast,\nwe use lower symmetry crystalline GeTe and GeSb2Te4 as the amorphous phases,\nrespectively, which has been proposed to model the medium range disordering. We\nfind that only Co substitution in r-GeSb2Te4 and s-GeSb2Te4 shows magnetic\ncontrast. The experimental magnetic contrast for Fe doped GST may be due to\nadditional TM-TM interaction, which is not included in our model. It can also\nbe possible that these lower symmetry crystalline models are not sufficient to\ncharacterize the magnetic properties of real 3d TM doped amorphous GST.\n", "  We consider the Jaynes-Cummings model describing the interaction of a Cooper\npair box (CPB) and a nanoresonator (NR) in the presence of a Kerr medium and\nlosses The evolution of the entropy of both subsystems and the CPB population\ninversion were calculated numerically. It is found that these properties\nincrease when the NR frequency is time-dependent, even in the presence of\nlosses; the effect is very sensitive to detuning and disappears in the resonant\nregime. The roles played by the losses affecting the CPB and the NR are also\ncompared.\n", "  We show how to construct fully symmetric, gapped states without topological\norder on a honey- comb lattice for S = 1/2 spins using the language of\nprojected entangled pair states(PEPS). An explicit example is given for the\nvirtual bond dimension D = 4. Four distinct classes differing by lattice\nquantum numbers are found by applying the systematic classification scheme\nintroduced by two of the authors [S. Jiang and Y. Ran, Phys. Rev. B 92, 104414\n(2015)]. Lack of topological degeneracy or other conventional forms of symmetry\nbreaking, and the existence of energy gap in the proposed wave functions, are\nchecked by numerical calculations of the entanglement entropy and various\ncorrelation functions. Our work provides the first explicit realization of a\nfeatureless quantum insulator for spin-1/2 particles on a honeycomb lattice.\n", "  The influence of both major and minor mergers is expected to significantly\naffect gradients of stellar ages and metallicities in the outskirts of\ngalaxies. Measurements of observed gradients are beginning to reach large radii\nin galaxies, but a theoretical framework for connecting the findings to a\npicture of galactic build-up is still in its infancy. We analyze stellar\npopulations of a statistically representative sample of quiescent galaxies over\na wide mass range from the Illustris simulation. We measure metallicity and age\nprofiles in the stellar halos of quiescent Illustris galaxies ranging in\nstellar mass from $10^{10}$ to $10^{12} M_\\odot$, accounting for observational\nprojection and luminosity-weighting effects. We find wide variance in stellar\npopulation gradients between galaxies of similar mass, with typical gradients\nagreeing with observed galaxies. We show that, at fixed mass, the fraction of\nstars born in-situ within galaxies is correlated with the metallicity gradient\nin the halo, confirming that stellar halos contain unique information about the\nbuild-up and merger histories of galaxies.\n", "  We study attractively interacting spin-1/2 fermions on the square lattice\nsubject to a spin population imbalance. Using unbiased diagrammatic Monte Carlo\nsimulations we find an extended region in the parameter space where the Fermi\nliquid is unstable towards formation of Cooper pairs with non-zero\ncenter-of-mass momentum, known as the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO)\nstate. In contrast to earlier mean-field and quasi-classical studies we provide\nquantitative and well-controlled predictions on the existence and location of\nthe relevant Fermi-liquid instabilities. The highest temperature where the FFLO\ninstability can be observed is about half of the superfluid transition\ntemperature in the unpolarized system.\n", "  We develop a variational approximation to the entanglement entropy for scalar\n$\\phi^4$ theory in 1+1, 2+1, and 3+1 dimensions, and then examine the\nentanglement entropy as a function of the coupling. We find that in 1+1 and 2+1\ndimensions, the entanglement entropy of $\\phi^4$ theory as a function of\ncoupling is monotonically decreasing and convex. While $\\phi^4$ theory with\npositive bare coupling in 3+1 dimensions is thought to lead to a trivial free\ntheory, we analyze a version of $\\phi^4$ with infinitesimal negative bare\ncoupling, an asymptotically free theory known as precarious $\\phi^4$ theory,\nand explore the monotonicity and convexity of its entanglement entropy as a\nfunction of coupling. Within the variational approximation, the stability of\nprecarious $\\phi^4$ theory is related to the sign of the first and second\nderivatives of the entanglement entropy with respect to the coupling.\n", "  A detailed study of the anharmonicity-induced resonances caused by the\ncoupling of center-of-mass and relative motion is presented for a system of two\nultracold atoms in single-well potentials. As has been confirmed\nexperimentally, these inelastic confinement-induced resonances are of interest,\nsince they can lead to coherent molecule formation, losses, and heating in\nultracold atomic gases. A perturbative model is introduced to describe the\nresonance positions and the coupling strengths. The validity of the model and\nthe behavior of the resonances for different confinement geometries are\nanalyzed in comparison with exact numerical ab initio calculations. While such\nresonances have so far only been detected for large positive values of the\n$s$-wave scattering length, it is found that they are present also for negative\n$s$-wave scattering lengths, i. e. for attractive interactions. The possibility\nto coherently tune the resonances by a variation of the external confinement\ngeometry might pave the way for coherent molecule association where magnetic\nFeshbach resonances are inaccessible.\n", "  Investigation of the inelastic neutron scattering spectra in\nFe$_{1+y}$Te$_{1-x}$Se$_{x}$ near a signature wave vector $\\mathbf{Q} =\n(1,0,0)$ for the bond-order wave (BOW) formation of parent compound\nFe$_{1+y}$Te [Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 187202 (2014)] reveals an\nacoustic-phonon-like dispersion present in all structural phases. While a\nstructural Bragg peak accompanies the mode in the low-temperature phase of\nFe$_{1+y}$Te, it is absent in the high-temperature tetragonal phase, where\nBragg scattering at this $\\mathbf{Q}$ is forbidden by symmetry. Notably, this\nmode is also observed in superconducting FeTe$_{0.55}$Se$_{0.45}$, where\nstructural and magnetic transitions are suppressed, and no BOW has been\nobserved. The presence of this \"forbidden\" phonon indicates that the lattice\nsymmetry is dynamically or locally broken by magneto-orbital BOW fluctuations,\nwhich are strongly coupled to lattice in these materials.\n", "  We present initial results from our study of the outer halo of the Milky Way\nusing a large sample of RR Lyr(ab) variables datamined from the archives of the\nPalomar Transient Facility. Of the 464 RR Lyr in our sample with distances\nexceeding 50 kpc, 62 have been observed spectroscopically at the Keck\nObservatory. Radial velocities and sigma(vr) are given as a function of\ndistance between 50 and 110 kpc, and a very preliminary rather low total mass\nfor the Milky Way out to 110 kpc of ~7 (+-1.5) x 10**11 solar masses is derived\nfrom our data.\n", "  RR Lyrae stars being distance indicators and tracers of old population serve\nas excellent probes of the structure, formation, and evolution of our Galaxy.\nThousands of them are being discovered in ongoing wide-field surveys. The OGLE\nproject conducts the Galaxy Variability Survey with the aim to detect and\nanalyze variable stars, in particular of RRab type, toward the Galactic bulge\nand disk, covering a total area of 3000 deg^2. Observations in these directions\nalso allow detecting background halo variables and unique studies of their\nproperties and distribution at distances from the Galactic Center to even 40\nkpc. In this contribution, we present the first results on the spatial\ndistribution of the observed RRab stars, their metallicity distribution, the\npresence of multiple populations, and relations with the old bulge. We also\nshow the most recent results from the analysis of RR Lyrae stars of the Sgr\ndwarf spheroidal galaxy, including its center, the globular cluster M54.\n", "  This paper presents the search for the production of a Higgs boson in\nassociation with a single top quark (tHq), using data collected in\nproton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV corresponding to\nan integrated luminosity of 19.7 inverse femtobarns. The search exploits a\nvariety of Higgs boson decay modes resulting in final states with photons,\nbottom quarks, and multiple charged leptons, including tau leptons, and employs\na variety of multivariate techniques to maximize sensitivity to the signal. The\nanalysis is optimized for the opposite sign of the Yukawa coupling to that in\nthe standard model and corresponding to a large enhancement of the signal cross\nsection. In the absence of an excess of candidate signal events over the\nbackground predictions, 95% confidence level observed (expected) upper limits\non anomalous tHq production are set, ranging between 600 (450) fb and 1000\n(700) fb depending on the assumed diphoton branching fraction of the Higgs\nboson. This is the first time that results on anomalous tHq production have\nbeen reported.\n", "  We present a new version of the GALFORM semi-analytical model of galaxy\nformation. This brings together several previous developments of GALFORM into a\nsingle unified model, including a different initial mass function (IMF) in\nquiescent star formation and in starbursts, feedback from active galactic\nnuclei supressing gas cooling in massive halos, and a new empirical star\nformation law in galaxy disks based on their molecular gas content. In\naddition, we have updated the cosmology, introduced a more accurate treatment\nof dynamical friction acting on satellite galaxies, and updated the stellar\npopulation model. The new model is able to simultaneously explain both the\nobserved evolution of the K-band luminosity function and stellar mass function,\nand the number counts and redshift distribution of sub-mm galaxies selected at\n850 mu. This was not previously achieved by a single physical model within the\nLambdaCDM framework, but requires having an IMF in starbursts that is somewhat\ntop-heavy. The new model is tested against a wide variety of observational data\ncovering wavelengths from the far-UV to sub-mm, and redshifts from z=0 to z=6,\nand is found to be generally successful. These observations include the optical\nand near-IR luminosity functions, HI mass function, fraction of early type\ngalaxies, Tully-Fisher, metallicity-luminosity and size-luminosity relations at\nz=0, as well as far-IR number counts, and far-UV luminosity functions at z ~\n3-6. [abridged]\n", "  The populations of bright planetary nebulae in the discs of spirals appear to\ndiffer in their spectral properties from those in ellipticals and the bulges of\nspirals. The bright planetary nebulae from the bulge of the Milky Way are\nentirely compatible with those observed in the discs of spiral galaxies. The\nsimilarity might be explained if the bulge of the Milky Way evolved secularly\nfrom the disc, in which case the bulge should be regarded as a pseudo-bulge.\n", "  In two spatial dimensions, topological order is robust for static\ndeformations at zero temperature, while it is fragile at any finite\ntemperature. How robust is topological order after a quantum quench? In this\npaper we show that topological order thermalizes under the unitary evolution\nafter a quantum quench. If the quench preserves gauge symmetry, there is a\nresidual topological entropy exactly like in the finite temperature case.\n  We obtain this result by studying the time evolution of the topological\n2-R\\'enyi entropy in a fully analytical, exact way. These techniques can be\nthen applied to systems with strong disorder to show whether a many-body\nlocalization phenomenon appears in topologically ordered systems.\n", "  Tidal streams of globular clusters are ideal tracers of the Galactic\ngravitational potential. Compared to the few known, complex and diffuse\ndwarf-galaxy streams, they are kinematically cold, have thin morphologies and\nare abundant in the halo of the Milky Way. Their coldness and thinness in\ncombination with potential epicyclic substructure in the vicinity of the stream\nprogenitor turns them into high-precision scales. With the example of Palomar\n5, we demonstrate how modeling of a globular cluster stream allows us to\nsimultaneously measure the properties of the disrupting globular cluster, its\norbital motion, and the gravitational potential of the Milky Way.\n", "  This is a \"biased\" review because I will show recent evidence on the\ncontribution of globular clusters (GCs) to the halo of our Galaxy seen through\nthe lens of the new paradigm of multiple populations in GCs. I will show a few\nexamples where the chemistry of multiple populations helps to answer hot\nquestions including whether and how much GCs did contribute to the halo\npopulation, if we have evidence of the GCs-halo link, what are the strengths\nand weak points concerning this contribution.\n", "  In this contribution the hypothesis that the Galactic globular clusters with\nsubstantial internal [Fe/H] abundance ranges are the former nuclei of disrupted\ndwarf galaxies is discussed. Evidence considered includes the form of the\nmetallicity distribution function, the occurrence of large diffuse outer\nenvelopes in cluster density profiles, and the presence of ([s-process/Fe],\n[Fe/H]) correlations. The hypothesis is shown to be plausible but with the\ncaveat that if significantly more than the current nine clusters known to have\n[Fe/H] spreads are found, then re-evaluation will be required.\n", "  The largest stellar halos in the universe are found in massive galaxy\nclusters, where interactions and mergers of galaxies, along with the cluster\ntidal field, all act to strip stars from their host galaxies and feed the\ndiffuse intracluster light (ICL) and extended halos of brightest cluster\ngalaxies (BCGs). Studies of the nearby Virgo Cluster reveal a variety of\naccretion signatures imprinted in the morphology and stellar populations of its\nICL. While simulations suggest the ICL should grow with time, attempts to track\nthis evolution across clusters spanning a range of mass and redshift have\nproved difficult due to a variety of observational and definitional issues.\nMeanwhile, studies of nearby galaxy groups reveal the earliest stages of ICL\nformation: the extremely diffuse tidal streams formed during interactions in\nthe group environment.\n", "  We develop and apply methods to extract planet masses and eccentricities from\nobserved transit time variations (TTVs). First, we derive simple analytic\nexpressions for the TTV that include the effects of both first- and\nsecond-order resonances. Second, we use N-body Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\nsimulations, as well as the analytic formulae, to measure the masses and\neccentricities of ten planets discovered by Kepler that have not previously\nbeen analyzed. Most of the ten planets have low densities. Using the analytic\nexpressions to partially circumvent degeneracies, we measure small\neccentricities of a few percent or less.\n", "  M54 is the central cluster of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. This stellar\nsystem is now in process of being disrupted by the tidal interaction with the\nMilky Way and represents one of the building blocks of the Galactic Halo.\nRecent discoveries, based on the synergy of photometry and spectroscopy have\nrevealed that the color-magnitude diagram of some massive, anomalous, Globular\nClusters (GCs) host stellar populations with different content of heavy\nelements.In this paper, I use multi-wavelength Hubble Space Telescope\nphotometry to detect and characterize multiple stellar populations in M54. I\nprovide empirical evidence that this GC shares photometric and spectroscopic\nsimilarities with the class of anomalous GCs. These findings make it tempting\nto speculate that, similarly to Sagittarius nuclear cluster M54, other\nanomalous GCs were born in an extra-Galactic environment.\n", "  Stellar halos around galaxies retain fundamental evidence of the processes\nwhich lead to their build up. Sophisticated models of galaxy formation in a\ncosmological context yield quantitative predictions about various observable\ncharacteristics, including the amount of substructure, the slope of radial mass\nprofiles and three dimensional shapes, and the properties of the stellar\npopulations in the halos. The comparison of such models with the observations\nprovides constraints on the general picture of galaxy formation in the\nhierarchical Universe, as well as on the physical processes taking place in the\nhalos formation. With the current observing facilities, stellar halos can be\neffectively probed only for a limited number of nearby galaxies. In this paper\nwe illustrate the progress that we expect in this field with the future ground\nbased large aperture telescopes (E-ELT) and with space based facilities as\nJWST.\n", "  Density functional theory provides the most widespread framework for the\nrealistic description of the electronic structure of solids, but the\ndescription of strongly-correlated systems has remained so far elusive. Here we\nconsider a particular limit of electrons in a periodic ionic potential in which\na one-band description becomes exact all the way from the weakly-correlated\nmetallic regime to the strongly-correlated Mott-Hubbard regime. We provide a\nnecessary condition a density functional should fulfill to describe\nMott-Hubbard behavior and show that it is not satisfied by standard and widely\nused local, semilocal and hybrid functionals. We illustrate the condition in\nthe case of a few-atom system and provide an analytic approximation to the\nexact exchange-correlation potential based on a variational wave function which\nshows explicitly the correct behavior providing a robust scheme to combine\nlattice and continuum methods.\n", "  In the wide-field Panoramic Imaging Survey of Centaurus and Sculptor\n(PISCeS), we investigate the resolved stellar halos of two nearby galaxies (the\nelliptical Centaurus A and the spiral Sculptor, D $\\sim3.7$ Mpc) out to a\nprojected galactocentric radius of 150 kpc with Magellan/Megacam. The survey\nhas led to the discovery of $\\sim$20 faint satellites to date, plus prominent\nstreams and substructures in two environments that are substantially different\nfrom the Local Group, i.e. the Centaurus A group dominated by an elliptical and\nthe loose Sculptor group of galaxies. These discoveries clearly attest to the\nimportance of past and ongoing accretion processes in shaping the halos of\nthese nearby galaxies, and provide the first census of their satellite systems\ndown to an unprecedented $M_V<-8$. The detailed characterization of the stellar\ncontent, shape and gradients in the extended halos of Sculptor, Centaurus A,\nand their dwarf satellites provides key constraints on theoretical models of\ngalaxy formation and evolution.\n", "  We consider particle acceleration in vacuum gaps in magnetospheres of black\nholes powered through Blandford-Znajek mechanism and embedded into\nradiatively-inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) environment. In such situation\nthe gap height is limited by the onset of gamma-gamma pair production on the\ninfrared photons originating from the RIAF. We numerically calculate\nacceleration and propagation of charged particles taking into account the\ndetailed structure of electric and magnetic field in the gap and in the entire\nblack hole magnetosphere, radiative energy losses and interactions of gamma\nrays produced by the propagated charged particles with the background radiation\nfield of RIAF. We show that the presence of the vacuum gap has clear\nobservational signatures. The spectra of emission from gaps embedded into a\nrelatively high luminosity RIAF are dominated by the inverse Compton emission\nwith a sharp, super-exponential cut-off in the very-high-energy gamma-ray band.\nThe cut-off energy is determined by the properties of the RIAF and is largely\nindependent of the structure of magnetosphere and geometry of the gap.The\nspectra of the gap residing in low-luminosity RIAFs are dominated by\nsynchrotron / curvature emission with the spectra extending into 1-100 GeV\nenergy range. We also consider the effect of possible acceleration of protons\nin the gap and find that proton energies could reach the ultra-high-energy\ncosmic ray (UHECR) range only in extremely low luminosity RIAFs.\n", "  The visibility of LyA emitting galaxies during the Epoch of Reionization is\ncontrolled by both diffuse HI patches in large-scale bubble morphology and\nsmall-scale absorbers. To investigate the impact on LyA photons, we apply a\nnovel combination of analytic and numerical calculations to three scenarios:\n(i) the `bubble' model, where only diffuse HI outside ionized bubbles is\npresent; (ii) the `web' model, where HI exists only in overdense self-shielded\ngas; and (iii) the more realistic 'web-bubble' model, which contains both. Our\nanalysis confirms that there is a degeneracy between the ionization structure\nof the intergalactic medium (IGM) and the HI fraction inferred from LyA\nsurveys, as the three models suppress LyA flux equally with very different HI\nfractions. We argue that a joint analysis of the LyA luminosity function and\nthe rest-frame equivalent width distribution/LyA fraction can break this\ndegeneracy and provide constraints on the reionization history and its\ntopology. We further show that constraints can improve if we consider the full\nshape of the M_UV-dependent redshift evolution of the LyA fraction of Lyman\nbreak galaxies. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we find that (i) a drop of LyA\nfraction larger for UV-faint than for UV-bright galaxies can be reproduced with\nweb and web-bubble models and therefore does not provide exclusive evidence of\npatchy reionization, and (ii) the IGM-transmission PDF is unimodal for bubble\nmodels and bimodal in web models. We further highlight the importance of\ngalaxy-absorber cross-correlation. Comparing our models to observations, the\nneutral fraction at z~7 is likely to be of order of tens of per cent when\ninterpreted with bubble or web-bubble models. Alternatively, we obtain a\nconservative lower limit ~1% in the web models, if we allow for a drop in the\nphotoionization rate by a factor of ~100 from the post-reionized universe.\n[abridged]\n", "  Hot subdwarf stars (sdO/Bs) are the stripped cores of red giants located at\nthe bluest extension of the horizontal branch. They constitute the dominant\npopulation of UV-bright stars in old stellar environments and are most likely\nformed by binary interactions. We perform the first systematic, spectroscopic\nanalysis of a sample of those stars in the Galactic halo based on data from\nSDSS. In the course of this project we discovered 177 close binary candidates.\nA significant fraction of the sdB binaries turned out to have close substellar\ncompanions, which shows that brown dwarfs and planets can significantly\ninfluence late stellar evolution. Close hot subdwarf binaries with massive\nwhite dwarf companions on the other hand are good candidates for the\nprogenitors of type Ia supernovae. We discovered a hypervelocity star, which\nnot only turned out to be the fastest unbound star known in our Galaxy, but\nalso the surviving companion of such a supernova explosion.\n", "  We examine metallicities, ages and orbital properties of halo stars in a\nMilky-Way like disk galaxy formed in the cosmological hydrodynamical MaGICC\nsimulations. Halo stars were either accreted from satellites or they formed in\nsitu in the disk or bulge of the galaxy and were then kicked up into the halo\n(\"in situ/ kicked-up\" stars). Regardless of where they formed both types show\nsurprisingly similar orbital properties: the majority of stars of both types\nare on short-axis tubes with the same sense of rotation as the disk -- implying\nthat a large fraction of satellites are accreted onto the halo with the same\nsense of angular momentum as the disk.\n", "  We investigate electron transport inside a ring system composed of a quantum\ndot (QD) coupled to two Majorana bound states confined at the ends of a\none-dimensional topological superconductor nanowire. By tuning the magnetic\nflux threading through the ring, the model system we consider can be switched\ninto states with or without zero-energy modes when the nanowire is in its\ntopological phase. We find that the Fano profile in the conductance spectrum\ndue to the interference between bound and continuum states exhibits markedly\ndifferent features for these two different situations, which consequently can\nbe used to detect the Majorana zero-energy mode. Most interestingly, as a\nperiodic function of magnetic flux, the conductance shows $2\\pi$ periodicity\nwhen the two Majorana bound states are nonoverlapping (as in an infinitely long\nnanowire) but displays $4\\pi$ periodicity when the overlapping becomes nonzero\n(as in a finite length nanowire). We map the model system into a QD--Kitaev\nring in the Majorana fermion representation and affirm these different\ncharacteristics by checking the energy spectrum.\n", "  The T2K long-baseline neutrino-oscillation experiment accumulated\napproximately 11.0x10^20 POT (protons on target) data until June 2015. The\nresults of \\nu_e appearance as well as \\nu_\\mu disappearance for 6.57x10^20 POT\nneutrino beam data are reported. A comparison with the results of reactor \\nu_e\ndisappearance experiments provides possible hints toward negative \\delta_CP\nphase with normal mass hierarchy. Preliminary results based on 4.04x10^20 POT\nanti-neutrino beam data are also presented.\n", "  Several unexpected features have been observed in the microwave sky at large\nangular scales, both by WMAP an by Planck. Among those features is a lack of\nboth variance and correlation on the largest angular scales, alignment of the\nlowest multipole moments with one another and with the motion and geometry of\nthe Solar System, a hemispherical power asymmetry or dipolar power modulation,\na preference for odd parity modes and an unexpectedly large cold spot in the\nSouthern hemisphere. The individual p-values of the significance of these\nfeatures are in the per mille to per cent level, when compared to the\nexpectations of the best-fit inflationary $\\Lambda$CDM model. Some pairs of\nthose features are demonstrably uncorrelated, increasing their combined\nstatistical significance and indicating a significant detection of CMB features\nat angular scales larger than a few degrees on top of the standard model.\nDespite numerous detailed investigations, we still lack a clear understanding\nof these large-scale features, which seem to imply a violation of statistical\nisotropy and scale invariance of inflationary perturbations. In this\ncontribution we present a critical analysis of our current understanding and\ndiscuss several ideas of how to make further progress.\n", "  A comprehensive study on the atmospheric neutrino flux in the energy region\nfrom sub-GeV up to several TeV using the Super-Kamiokande water Cherenkov\ndetector is presented in this paper. The energy and azimuthal spectra of the\natmospheric ${\\nu}_e+{\\bar{\\nu}}_e$ and ${\\nu}_{\\mu}+{\\bar{\\nu}}_{\\mu}$ fluxes\nare measured. The energy spectra are obtained using an iterative unfolding\nmethod by combining various event topologies with differing energy responses.\nThe azimuthal spectra depending on energy and zenith angle, and their\nmodulation by geomagnetic effects, are also studied. A predicted east-west\nasymmetry is observed in both the ${\\nu}_e$ and ${\\nu}_{\\mu}$ samples at 8.0\n{\\sigma} and 6.0 {\\sigma} significance, respectively, and an indication that\nthe asymmetry dipole angle changes depending on the zenith angle was seen at\nthe 2.2 {\\sigma} level. The measured energy and azimuthal spectra are\nconsistent with the current flux models within the estimated systematic\nuncertainties. A study of the long-term correlation between the atmospheric\nneutrino flux and the solar magnetic activity cycle is also performed, and a\nweak indication of a correlation was seen at the 1.1 {\\sigma} level, using SK\nI-IV data spanning a 20 year period. For particularly strong solar activity\nperiods known as Forbush decreases, no theoretical prediction is available, but\na deviation below the typical neutrino event rate is seen at the 2.4 {\\sigma}\nlevel.\n", "  Cosmic reionization by starlight from early galaxies affected their\nevolution, thereby impacting reionization, itself. Star formation suppression,\nfor example, may explain the observed underabundance of Local Group dwarfs\nrelative to N-body predictions for Cold Dark Matter. Reionization modelling\nrequires simulating volumes large enough [~(100Mpc)^3] to sample reionization\n\"patchiness\", while resolving millions of galaxy sources above ~10^8 Msun ,\ncombining gravitational and gas dynamics with radiative transfer. Modelling the\nLocal Group requires initial cosmological density fluctuations pre-selected to\nform the well-known structures of the local universe today. Cosmic Dawn\n(\"CoDa\") is the first such fully-coupled, radiation-hydrodynamics simulation of\nreionization of the local universe. Our new hybrid CPU-GPU code,\nRAMSES-CUDATON, performs hundreds of radiative transfer and ionization\nrate-solver timesteps on the GPUs for each hydro-gravity timestep on the CPUs.\nCoDa simulated (91Mpc)^3 with 4096^3 particles and cells, to redshift 4.23, on\nORNL supercomputer Titan, utilizing 8192 cores and 8192 GPUs. Global\nreionization ended slightly later than observed. However, a simple temporal\nrescaling which brings the evolution of ionized fraction into agreement with\nobservations also reconciles ionizing flux density, cosmic star formation\nhistory, CMB electron scattering optical depth and galaxy UV luminosity\nfunction with their observed values. Photoionization heating suppressed the\nstar formation of haloes below ~2 x 10^9 Msun , decreasing the abun- dance of\nfaint galaxies around MAB_1600 = [-10,-12]. For most of reionization, star\nformation was dominated by haloes between 10^10 - 10^11 Msun , so low-mass halo\nsuppression was not reflected by a distinct feature in the global star\nformation history. (Abridged)\n", "  Rayleigh's criterion for resolving two incoherent point sources has been the\nmost influential measure of optical imaging resolution for over a century. In\nthe context of statistical image processing, violation of the criterion is\nespecially detrimental to the estimation of the separation between the sources,\nand modern farfield superresolution techniques rely on suppressing the emission\nof close sources to enhance the localization precision. Using quantum optics,\nquantum metrology, and statistical analysis, here we show that, even if two\nclose incoherent sources emit simultaneously, measurements with linear optics\nand photon counting can estimate their separation from the far field almost as\nprecisely as conventional methods do for isolated sources, rendering Rayleigh's\ncriterion irrelevant to the problem. Our results demonstrate that\nsuperresolution can be achieved not only for fluorophores but also for stars.\n", "  The diffuse extended outer regions of galaxies are hard to study because they\nare faint, with typical surface brightness of 1% of the dark night sky. We can\ntackle this problem by using resolved star tracers which remain visible at\nlarge distances from the galaxy centres. This article describes the use of\nPlanetary Nebulae as tracers and the calibration of their properties as\nindicators of the star formation history, mean age and metallicity of the\nparent stars in the Milky Way and Local Group galaxies . We then report on the\nresults from a deep, extended, planetary nebulae survey in a 0.5 sqdeg region\ncentred on the brightest cluster galaxy NGC 4486 (M87) in the Virgo cluster\ncore, carried out with SuprimeCam@Subaru and FLAMES-GIRAFFE@VLT. Two PN\npopulations are identified out to 150 kpc distance from the centre of M87. One\npopulation is associated with the M87 halo and the second one with the\nintracluster light in the Virgo cluster core. They have different line-of-sight\nvelocity and spatial distributions, as well as different planetary nebulae\nspecific frequencies and luminosity functions. The intracluster planetary\nnebulae in the surveyed region correspond to a luminosity of four times the\nluminosity of the Large Magellanic Cloud. The M87 halo planetary nebulae trace\nan older, more metal-rich, parent stellar population. A substructure detected\nin the projected phase-space of the line-of-sight velocity vs. major axis\ndistance for the M87 halo planetary nebulae provides evidence for the recent\naccretion event of a satellite galaxy with luminosity twice that of M33. The\nsatellite stars were tidally stripped about 1 Gyr ago, and reached apocenter at\na major axis distance of 60-90 kpc from the centre of M87. The M87 halo is\nstill growing significantly at the distances where the substructure is\ndetected.\n", "  We present a loophole-free violation of local realism using entangled photon\npairs. We ensure that all relevant events in our Bell test are spacelike\nseparated by placing the parties far enough apart and by using fast random\nnumber generators and high-speed polarization measurements. A high-quality\npolarization-entangled source of photons, combined with high-efficiency,\nlow-noise, single-photon detectors, allows us to make measurements without\nrequiring any fair-sampling assumptions. Using a hypothesis test, we compute\np-values as small as $5.9\\times 10^{-9}$ for our Bell violation while\nmaintaining the spacelike separation of our events. We estimate the degree to\nwhich a local realistic system could predict our measurement choices.\nAccounting for this predictability, our smallest adjusted p-value is $2.3\n\\times 10^{-7}$. We therefore reject the hypothesis that local realism governs\nour experiment.\n", "  We obtain all the type II supergravity constraints in the pure spinor\nambitwistor string by imposing consistency of local worldsheet gauge\nsymmetries.\n", "  We use the Ly-$\\alpha$ Mass Association Scheme (LyMAS; Peirani et al. 2014)\nto predict cross-correlations at $z=2.5$ between dark matter halos and\ntransmitted flux in the Ly-$\\alpha$ forest, and compare to cross-correlations\nmeasured for quasars and damped Ly-$\\alpha$ systems (DLAs) from the Baryon\nOscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) by Font-Ribera et al. (2012, 2013). We\ncalibrate LyMAS using Horizon-AGN hydrodynamical cosmological simulations of a\n$(100\\ h^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{Mpc})^3$ comoving volume. We apply this calibration to a\n$(1\\ h^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{Gpc})^3$ simulation realized with $2048^3$ dark matter\nparticles. In the 100 $h^{-1}$ Mpc box, LyMAS reproduces the halo-flux\ncorrelations computed from the full hydrodynamic gas distribution very well. In\nthe 1 $h^{-1}$ Gpc box, the amplitude of the large scale cross-correlation\ntracks the halo bias $b_h$ as expected. We provide empirical fitting functions\nthat describe our numerical results. In the transverse separation bins used for\nthe BOSS analyses, LyMAS cross-correlation predictions follow linear theory\naccurately down to small scales. Fitting the BOSS measurements requires\ninclusion of random velocity errors; we find best-fit RMS velocity errors of\n399 km s$^{-1}$ and 252 km s$^{-1}$ for quasars and DLAs, respectively. We\ninfer bias-weighted mean halo masses of $M_h/10^{12}\\\nh^{-1}M_\\odot=2.19^{+0.16}_{-0.15}$ and $0.69^{+0.16}_{-0.14}$ for the host\nhalos of quasars and DLAs, with $\\sim 0.2$ dex systematic uncertainty\nassociated with redshift evolution, IGM parameters, and selection of data\nfitting range.\n", "  We apply a fluctuation electrodynamics framework in combination with\nsemianalytical (dipolar) approximations to study amplified spontaneous energy\ntransfer (ASET) between active and passive bodies. We consider near-field\nenergy transfer between semi-infinite planar media and spherical structures\n(dimers and lattices) subject to gain, and show that the combination of loss\ncompensation and near-field enhancement (achieved by the proximity, enhanced\ninteractions, and tuning of subwavelength resonances) in these structures can\nresult in orders of magnitude ASET enhancements below the lasing threshold. We\nexamine various possible geometric configurations, including realistic\nmaterials, and describe optimal conditions for enhancing ASET, showing that the\nlatter depends sensitively on both geometry and gain, enabling efficient and\ntunable gain-assisted energy extraction from structured surfaces.\n", "  We have surveyed 84 Class 0, Class I, and flat-spectrum protostars in\nmid-infrared [Si II], [Fe II] and [S I] line emission, and 11 of these in\nfar-infrared [O I] emission. We use the results to derive their mass outflow\nrates. Thereby we observe a strong correlation of mass outflow rates with\nbolometric luminosity, and with the inferred mass accretion rates of the\ncentral objects, which continues through the Class 0 range the trend observed\nin Class II young stellar objects. Along this trend from large to small\nmass-flow rates, the different classes of young stellar objects lie in the\nsequence Class 0 -- Class I/flat-spectrum -- Class II, indicating that the\ntrend is an evolutionary sequence in which mass outflow and accretion rates\ndecrease together with increasing age, while maintaining rough proportionality.\n  The survey results include two which are key tests of magnetocentrifugal\noutflow-acceleration mechanisms: the distribution of the outflow/accretion\nbranching ratio b, and limits on the distribution of outflow speeds. Neither\nrule out any of the three leading outflow-acceleration,\nangular-momentum-ejection mechanisms, but they provide some evidence that disk\nwinds and accretion-powered stellar winds (APSWs) operate in many protostars.\nAn upper edge observed in the branching-ratio distribution is consistent with\nthe upper bound of b = 0.6 found in models of APSWs, and a large fraction\n(0.31) of the sample have branching ratio sufficiently small that only disk\nwinds, launched on scales as large as several AU, have been demonstrated to\naccount for them.\n", "  Using numerical solutions of the full Einstein field equations coupled to a\nscalar inflaton field in 3+1 dimensions, we study the conditions under which a\nuniverse that is initially expanding, highly inhomogeneous and dominated by\ngradient energy can transition to an inflationary period. If the initial scalar\nfield variations are contained within a sufficiently flat region of the\ninflaton potential, and the universe is spatially flat or open on average,\ninflation will occur following the dilution of the gradient and kinetic energy\ndue to expansion. This is the case even when the scale of the inhomogeneities\nis comparable to the initial Hubble length, and overdense regions collapse and\nform black holes, because underdense regions continue expanding, allowing\ninflation to eventually begin. This establishes that inflation can arise from\nhighly inhomogeneous initial conditions and solve the horizon and flatness\nproblems, at least as long as the variations in the scalar field do not include\nvalues that exceed the inflationary plateau.\n", "  In this work we examine with the help of Monte Carlo simulation whether a\nconsistent primary energy spectrum of cosmic rays emerges from both the\nexperimentally observed total charged particles and muon size spectra of cosmic\nray extensive air showers considering primary composition may or may not change\nbeyond the knee of the energy spectrum. It is found that EAS-TOP observations\nconsistently infer a knee in the primary energy spectrum provided the primary\nis pure unchanging iron whereas no consistent primary spectrum emerges from\nsimultaneous use of the KASCADE observed total charged particle and muon\nspectra. However, it is also found that when primary composition changes across\nthe knee the estimation of spectral index of total charged particle spectrum is\nquite tricky, depends on the choice of selection of points near the knee in the\nsize spectrum.\n", "  Accretion of gas from the cosmic web to galaxy halos and ultimately their\ndisks is a prediction of modern cosmological models but is rarely observed\ndirectly or at the full rate expected from star formation. Here we illustrate\npossible large-scale cosmic HI accretion onto the nearby dwarf starburst galaxy\nIC10, observed with the VLA and GBT. We also suggest that cosmic accretion is\nthe origin of sharp metallicity drops in the starburst regions of other dwarf\ngalaxies, as observed with the 10-m GTC. Finally, we question the importance of\ncosmic accretion in normal dwarf irregulars, for which a recent study of their\nfar-outer regions sees no need for, or evidence of, continuing gas buildup.\n", "  We explore a novel flavor structure in the interactions of dark matter with\nthe Standard Model. We consider theories in which both the dark matter\ncandidate, and the particles that mediate its interactions with the Standard\nModel fields, carry flavor quantum numbers. The interactions are skewed in\nflavor space, so that a dark matter particle does not directly couple to the\nStandard Model matter fields of the same flavor, but only to the other two\nflavors. This framework respects Minimal Flavor Violation, and is therefore\nnaturally consistent with flavor constraints. We study the phenomenology of a\nbenchmark model in which dark matter couples to right-handed charged leptons.\nIn large regions of parameter space the dark matter can emerge as a thermal\nrelic, while remaining consistent with the constraints from direct and indirect\ndetection. The collider signatures of this scenario include events with\nmultiple leptons and missing energy. These events exhibit a characteristic\nflavor pattern that may allow this class of models to be distinguished from\nother theories of dark matter.\n", "  We perform a statistical study of the global motion of cosmic voids using\nboth a numerical simulation and observational data. We analyse their relation\nto large-scale mass flows and the physical effects that drive those motions. We\nanalyse the bulk motions of voids, defined by the mean velocity of haloes in\nthe surrounding shells in the numerical simulation, and by galaxies in the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7. We find void mean bulk velocities\nclose to 400 km/s, comparable to those of haloes (~ 500-600 km/s), depending on\nvoid size and the large-scale environment. Statistically, small voids move\nfaster than large ones, and voids in relatively higher density environments\nhave higher bulk velocities than those placed in large underdense regions.\nAlso, we analyze the mean mass density around voids finding, as expected,\nlarge-scale overdensities (underdensities) along (opposite to) the void motion\ndirection, suggesting that void motions respond to a pull-push mechanism. This\ncontrasts with massive cluster motions who are mainly governed by the pull of\nthe large-scale overdense regions. Our analysis of void pairwise velocities\nshows how their relative motions are generated by large-scale density\nfluctuations. In agreement with linear theory, voids embedded in low (high)\ndensity regions mutually recede (attract) each other, providing the general\nmechanism to understand the bimodal behavior of void motions. In order to\ncompare the theoretical results and the observations we have inferred void\nmotions in the SDSS using linear theory, finding that the estimated\nobservational void motions are in statisticalagreement with the results of the\nsimulation. Regarding large-scale flows, our results suggest a scenario of\ngalaxies and galaxy systems flowing away from void centers with the additional,\nand morerelevant, contribution of the void bulk motion to the total velocity.\n", "  Plasma diagnostics in magnetic confinement fusion plasmas by using visible\nspectrum strongly depends on the knowledge of fundamental atomic properties. A\ndetailed collisional-radiative model of W$^{26+}$ ions has been constructed by\nconsidering radiative and electron excitation processes, in which the necessary\natomic data had been calculated by relativistic configuration interaction\nmethod with the implementation of Flexible Atomic Code. The visible spectrum\nobserved at an electron beam ion trap (EBIT) in Shanghai in the range of 332 nm\nto 392 nm was reproduced by present calculations. Some transition pairs of\nwhich the intensity ratio are sensitive to the electron density were selected\nas potential candidate of plasma diagnostics. Their electron density dependence\nare theoretically evaluated for the cases of EBIT plasmas and magnetic\nconfinement fusion plasmas.\n", "  A fundamental problem in community ecology is to understand how ecological\nprocesses such as selection, drift, and immigration give rise to observed\npatterns in species composition and diversity. Here, we present a simple,\nanalytically tractable, presence-absence (PA) model for community assembly and\nuse it to ask how ecological traits such as the strength of competition, the\namount of diversity, and demographic and environmental stochasticity affect\nspecies composition in a community. In the PA model, species are treated as\nstochastic binary variables that can either be present or absent in a\ncommunity: species can immigrate into the community from a regional species\npool and can go extinct due to competition and stochasticity. Despite its\nsimplicity, the PA model reproduces the qualitative features of more\ncomplicated models of community assembly. In agreement with recent work on\nlarge, competitive Lotka-Volterra systems, the PA model exhibits distinct\necological behaviors organized around a special (\"critical\") point\ncorresponding to Hubbell's neutral theory of biodiversity. These results\nsuggest that the concepts of ecological \"phases\" and phase diagrams can provide\na powerful framework for thinking about community ecology and that the PA model\ncaptures the essential ecological dynamics of community assembly.\n", "  The electronic structure and magnetic properties of the strongly correlated\nmaterial La$_2$O$_3$Fe$_2$Se$_2$ are studied by using both the density function\ntheory plus $U$ (DFT+$U$) method and the DFT plus Gutzwiller (DFT+G)\nvariational method. The ground-state magnetic structure of this material\nobtained with DFT+$U$ is consistent with recent experiments, but its band gap\nis significantly overestimated by DFT+$U$, even with a small Hubbard $U$ value.\nIn contrast, the DFT+G method yields a band gap of 0.1 - 0.2 eV, in excellent\nagreement with experiment. Detailed analysis shows that the electronic and\nmagnetic properties of of La$_2$O$_3$Fe$_2$Se$_2$ are strongly affected by\ncharge and spin fluctuations which are missing in the DFT+$U$ method.\n", "  In this chapter, semi-analytical models for the calculation of the quantum\ncapacitance of both monolayer and bilayer graphene and its nanoribbons, are\npresented. Since electron-hole puddles are experimental facts in all graphene\nsamples, they have been incorporated in our calculations. The temperature\ndependence of the quantum capacitance around the charge neutrality point is\nalso investigated and the obtained results are in agreement with many features\nrecently observed in quantum capacitance measurements on both monolayer and\nbilayer graphene devices. Furtheremore, the impact of finite-size and edge\neffects on the quantum capacitance of graphene nanoribbons is studied taking\ninto account both the edge bond relaxation and third-nearest-neighbour\ninteraction in the band structure of GNRs.\n", "  We use the kinematics of discrete tracers, primarily globular clusters (GCs)\nand planetary nebulae (PNe), along with measurements of the integrated\nstarlight to explore the assembly histories of early type galaxies. Data for\nGCs and stars are taken from the SLUGGS wide field, 2-dimensional,\nchemo-dynamical survey (Brodie et al. 2014). Data for PNe are from the PN.S\nsurvey (see contributions by Gerhard and by Arnaboldi, this volume). We find\nwidespread evidence for 2-phase galaxy assembly and intriguing constraints on\nhierarchical merging under a lambda CDM cosmology.\n", "  We compare simulations, including the Illustris simulations, to observations\nof CIV and CII absorption at z=2-4. These are the CIV column density\ndistribution function in the column density range $10^{12} - 10^{15}$\ncm$^{-2}$, the CIV equivalent width distribution at 0.1 - 2 \\AA, and the\ncovering fractions and equivalent widths of CIV 1548 and CII 1337 around DLAs.\nIn the context of the feedback models we investigate, all CIV observations\nfavour the use of more energetic wind models, which are better able to enrich\nthe gas surrounding halos. We propose two ways to achieve this; an increased\nwind velocity and an increase in wind thermal energy. However, even our most\nenergetic wind models do not produce enough absorbers with CIV equivalent width\n> 0.6 \\AA, which in our simulations are associated with the most massive\nhaloes. All simulations are in reasonable agreement with the CII covering\nfraction and equivalent widths around Damped Lyman-$\\alpha$ absorbers, although\nthere is a moderate deficit in one bin 10 - 100 kpc from the DLA. Finally, we\nshow that the CIV in our simulations is predominantly photoionized.\n", "  In a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) space-time background we study the\nclassical cosmological models in the context of recently proposed theory of\nnonlinear minimal massive bigravity. We show that in the presence of perfect\nfluid the classical field equations acquire contribution from the massive\ngraviton as a cosmological term which is positive or negative depending on the\ndynamical competition between two scale factors of bigravity metrics. We obtain\nthe classical field equations for flat and open universes in the ordinary and\nSchutz representation of perfect fluid. Focusing on the Schutz representation\nfor flat universe, we find classical solutions exhibiting singularities at\nearly universe with vacuum equation of state. Then, in the Schutz\nrepresentation, we study the quantum cosmology for flat universe and derive the\nSchrodinger-Wheeler-DeWitt equation. We find its exact and wave packet\nsolutions and discuss on their properties to show that the initial singularity\nin the classical solutions can be avoided by quantum cosmology. Similar to the\nstudy of Hartle-Hawking no-boundary proposal in the quantum cosmology of de\nRham, Gabadadze and Tolley (dRGT) massive gravity, it turns out that the mass\nof graviton predicted by quantum cosmology of the minimal massive bigravity is\nlarge at early universe. This is in agreement with the fact that at early\nuniverse the cosmological constant should be large.\n", "  We review the recent developments in the field of cuprate superconductors\nwith the special focus on the recently observed charge order in the underdoped\ncompounds. We introduce new theoretical developments following the study of the\nantiferromagnetic (AF) quantum critical point (QCP) in two dimensions, in which\npreemptive orders in the charge and superconducting (SC) sectors emerged, that\nare in turn related by an SU(2) symmetry. We consider the implications of this\nproliferation of orders in the underdoped region, and provide a study of the\ntype of fluctuations which characterize the SU(2) symmetry. We identify an\nintermediate energy scale where the SU(2) pairing fluctuations are dominant and\nargue that they are unstable towards the formation of a Resonant Peierls\nExcitonic (RPE) state at the pseudogap (PG) temperature $T^{*}$. We discuss the\nimplications of this scenario for a few key experiments.\n", "  The gauge field strength tensor $F_{\\mu \\nu}$ in Abelian and non-Abelian\nlocal gauge field theories is a key object in the construction of the\nLagrangian since it provides the kinetic term(s) of the gauge field(s) $A_\\mu$.\nWhen introducing this object, most of textbooks employ as a tool the commutator\nof the gauge covariant derivatives $D_\\mu \\psi$ of a fermion field $\\psi$:\n$F_{\\mu \\nu} \\psi = (i/g)[D_\\mu,D_\\nu]\\psi$. I argue that such a construction,\nalthough completely correct and valid, is not pedagogical enough for many\nstudents that approach the gauge field theories for the first time. Another\nconstruction, based on the object $D_\\mu A_\\nu$: $F_{\\mu \\nu} = D_{[\\mu}\nA_{\\nu]}$, which avoids the introduction of additional and, for the case in\nconsideration, spurious degrees of freedom such as the fermion one, simpler,\nmore pedagogical in many cases, and suitable for first-time students, is\npresented.\n", "  Using the Sen's entropy function formalism, we compute the entropy for the\nextremal dyonic black hole solutions of theories in the presence of dilaton\nfield coupled to the field strength and a dilaton potential. We solve the\nattractor equations analytically and determine the near horizon metric, the\nvalue of the scalar fields and the electric field on the horizon, and\nconsequently the entropy of these black holes. The attractor mechanism plays a\nvery important role for these systems, and after studying the simplest systems\ninvolving dilaton fields, we propose a general ansatz for the value of the\nscalar field on the horizon, which allows us to solve the attractor equations\nfor gauged supergravity theories in $AdS_4$ spaces. In particular, we derive an\nexpression for the dyonic black hole entropy for the $\\mathcal{N}=8$ gauged\nsupergravity in 4 dimensions which does not contain explicitly the gauge\nparameter of the potential.\n", "  Single flux quantum pulses are a natural candidate for on-chip control of\nsuperconducting qubits. We show that they can drive high-fidelity single-qubit\nrotations---even in leaky transmon qubits---if the pulse sequence is suitably\noptimized. We achieve this objective by showing that, for these restricted\nall-digital pulses, genetic algorithms can be made to converge to arbitrarily\nlow error, verified up to a reduction in gate error by 2 orders of magnitude\ncompared to an evenly spaced pulse train. Timing jitter of the pulses is taken\ninto account, exploring the robustness of our optimized sequence. This approach\ntakes us one step further towards on-chip qubit controls.\n", "  We study the interplay of nematic and superconducting order in the\ntwo-dimensional Hubbard model and show that they can coexist, especially when\nsuperconductivity is not the energetically dominant phase. Due to a breaking of\nthe $C_4$ symmetry, the coexisting phase inherently contains admixture of the\n$s$-wave pairing components. As a result, the superconducting gap exhibits very\nnon-standard features including changed nodal directions. Our results also show\nthat in the optimally doped regime the superconducting phase is typically\nunstable towards developing nematicity (breaking of the $C_4$ symmetry). This\nhas implications for the cuprate high-$T_c$ superconductors, for which in this\nregime the so-called intertwined orders have recently been observed. Namely,\nthe coexisting phase may be viewed as a precursor to such more involved\npatterns of symmetry breaking.\n", "  The spherical isothermal Lane-Emden equation is a second order non-linear\ndifferential equation that model many configurations in astrophysics. In the\npresent paper and based on the fractal index technique and the series\nexpansion, the fractional lane-Emden equation involving modified\nRiemann-Liouville derivative is solved. The results indicate that, the series\nconverges for the radius range with fractional parameter spreads over a wide\nrange of the fractional parameter . Comparison with the numerical solution\nrevealed a good agreement with a maximum relative error 0.05.\n", "  After a brief historical review of ergodicity and mixing in dynamics,\nparticularly in quantum dynamics, we introduce definitions of quantum\nergodicity and mixing using the structure of the system's energy levels and\nspacings. Our definitions are consistent with usual understanding of ergodicity\nand mixing. Two parameters concerning the degeneracy in energy levels and\nspacings are introduced. They are computed for right triangular billiards and\nthe results indicate a very close relation between quantum ergodicity (mixing)\nand quantum chaos. At the end, we argue that, besides ergodicity and mixing,\nthere may exist a third class of quantum dynamics which is characterized by a\nmaximized entropy.\n", "  We apply the concept of superradiance introduced by Dicke in 1954 to the OH\nmolecule 1612 MHz spectral line often used for the detection of masers in\ncircumstellar envelopes of evolved stars. As the detection of 1612 MHz OH\nmasers in the outer shells of envelopes of these stars implies the existence of\na population inversion and a high level of velocity coherence, and that these\nare two necessary requirements for superradiance, we investigate whether\nsuperradiance can also happen in these regions. Superradiance is characterized\nby high intensity, spatially compact, burst-like features taking place over\ntime-scales on the order of seconds to years, depending on the size and\nphysical conditions present in the regions harboring such sources of radiation.\nOur analysis suggests that superradiance provides a valid explanation for\nprevious observations of intensity flares detected in that spectral line for\nthe U Orionis Mira star and the IRAS18276-1431 pre-planetary nebula.\n", "  Hagedorn states are the key to understand how all hadrons observed in high\nenergy heavy ion collisions seem to reach thermal equilibrium so quickly. An\nassembly of Hagedorn states is formed in elementary hadronic or heavy ion\ncollisions at hadronization. Microscopic simulations within the transport model\nUrQMD allow to study the time evolution of such a pure non-equilibrated\nHagedorn state gas towards a thermally equilibrated Hadron Resonance Gas by\nusing dynamics, which unlike strings, fully respect detailed balance.\nPropagation, repopulation, rescatterings and decays of Hagedorn states provide\nthe yields of all hadrons up to a mass of m=2.5 GeV. Ratios of feed down\ncorrected hadron multiplicities are compared to corresponding experimental data\nfrom the ALICE collaboration at LHC. The quick thermalization within t=1-2 fm\\c\nof the emerging Hadron Resonance Gas exposes Hagedorn states as a tool to\nunderstand hadronization.\n", "  We prove the existence and uniqueness of the Dirichlet problem for spacelike,\nspherically symmetric, constant mean curvature equation with symmetric boundary\ndata in the extended Schwarzschild spacetime. As an application, we completely\nsolve the CMC foliation conjecture which is posted by Malec and O Murchadha in\n2003.\n", "  We propose a novel mechanism for ion acceleration based on the guided motion\nof electrons from a thin target. The electron motion is locked to the moving\nnodes of a standing wave formed by a chirped laser pulse reflected from a\nmirror behind the target. This provides a stable longitudinal field of charge\nseparation, thus giving rise to chirped standing wave acceleration (CSWA) of\nthe residual ions of the layer. We demonstrate, both analytically and\nnumerically, that quasi-monoenergetic ion beams with energies of the order 100\nMeV are feasible for realistic pulse energies of 10 J. Moreover, a scaling law\nfor higher laser intensities and layer densities is presented, indicating\nstable GeV-level energy gains of dense ion bunches, for soon-to-be available\nlaser intensities.\n", "  To model modern large-scale datasets, we need efficient algorithms to infer a\nset of $P$ unknown model parameters from $N$ noisy measurements. What are\nfundamental limits on the accuracy of parameter inference, given finite\nsignal-to-noise ratios, limited measurements, prior information, and\ncomputational tractability requirements? How can we combine prior information\nwith measurements to achieve these limits? Classical statistics gives incisive\nanswers to these questions as the measurement density $\\alpha =\n\\frac{N}{P}\\rightarrow \\infty$. However, these classical results are not\nrelevant to modern high-dimensional inference problems, which instead occur at\nfinite $\\alpha$. We formulate and analyze high-dimensional inference as a\nproblem in the statistical physics of quenched disorder. Our analysis uncovers\nfundamental limits on the accuracy of inference in high dimensions, and reveals\nthat widely cherished inference algorithms like maximum likelihood (ML) and\nmaximum-a posteriori (MAP) inference cannot achieve these limits. We further\nfind optimal, computationally tractable algorithms that can achieve these\nlimits. Intriguingly, in high dimensions, these optimal algorithms become\ncomputationally simpler than MAP and ML, while still outperforming them. For\nexample, such optimal algorithms can lead to as much as a 20% reduction in the\namount of data to achieve the same performance relative to MAP. Moreover, our\nanalysis reveals simple relations between optimal high dimensional inference\nand low dimensional scalar Bayesian inference, insights into the nature of\ngeneralization and predictive power in high dimensions, information theoretic\nlimits on compressed sensing, phase transitions in quadratic inference, and\nconnections to central mathematical objects in convex optimization theory and\nrandom matrix theory.\n", "  Octupole vibrations are studied in some doubly magic nuclei using the\ntime-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory with a Skyrme energy density\nfunctional. Through the use of the linear response theory, the energies and\ntransition amplitudes of the low-lying vibrational modes for each of the nuclei\nwere determined. Energies were found to be close to experimental results.\nHowever, transition amplitudes, quantified by the deformation parameter\n$\\beta_3$, are underestimated by TDHF. A comparison with single-particle\nexcitations on the Hartree-Fock ground-state shows that the collective octupole\nvibrations have their energy lowered due to attractive RPA residual\ninteraction.\n", "  We experimentally investigate magnon-polaritons, arising in ferrimagnetic\nresonance experiments in a microwave cavity with a tuneable quality factor. To\nhis end, we simultaneously measure the electrically detected spin pumping\nsignal and microwave reflection (the ferrimagnetic resonance signal) of a\nyttrium iron garnet (YIG) / platinum (Pt) bilayer in the microwave cavity. The\ncoupling strength of the fundamental magnetic resonance mode and the cavity is\ndetermined from the microwave reflection data. All features of the magnetic\nresonance spectra predicted by first principle calculations and an input-output\nformalism agree with our experimental observations. By changing the decay rate\nof the cavity at constant magnon-photon coupling rate, we experimentally tune\nin and out of the strong coupling regime and successfully model the\ncorresponding change of the spin pumping signal. Furthermore, we observe the\ncoupling and spin pumping of several spin wave modes and provide a quantitative\nanalysis of their coupling rates to the cavity.\n", "  The problem of how space-time responds to gravitating quantum matter in full\nquantum gravity has been one of the main questions that any program of\nquantization of gravity should address. Here we analyze this issue by\nconsidering the quantization of a collapsing null shell coupled to spherically\nsymmetric loop quantum gravity. We show that the constraint algebra of\ncanonical gravity is Abelian both classically and when quantized using loop\nquantum gravity techniques. The Hamiltonian constraint is well defined and\nsuitable Dirac observables characterizing the problem were identified at the\nquantum level. We can write the metric as a parameterized Dirac observable at\nthe quantum level and study the physics of the collapsing shell and black hole\nformation. We show how the singularity inside the black hole is eliminated by\nloop quantum gravity and how the shell can traverse it. The construction is\ncompatible with a scenario in which the shell tunnels into a baby universe\ninside the black hole or one in which it could emerge through a white hole.\n", "  The shape and diversity of dwarf galaxy rotation curves is at apparent odds\nwith dark matter halos in a $\\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter ($\\Lambda$CDM)\ncosmology. We use mock data from isolated dwarf galaxy simulations to show that\nthis owes to three main effects. Firstly, stellar feedback heats dark matter,\nleading to a 'coreNFW' dark matter density profile with a slowly rising\nrotation curve. Secondly, if close to a recent starburst, large HI bubbles push\nthe rotation curve out of equilibrium, deforming the rotation curve shape.\nThirdly, when galaxies are viewed near face-on, their best fit inclination is\nbiased high. This can lead to a very shallow rotation curve that falsely\nimplies a large dark matter core. All three problems can be avoided, however,\nby a combination of improved mass models and a careful selection of target\ngalaxies. Fitting our coreNFW model to mock rotation curve data, we show that\nwe can recover the rotation curve shape, dark matter halo mass $M_{200}$ and\nconcentration parameter $c$ within our quoted uncertainties.\n  We fit our coreNFW model to real data for four isolated dwarf irregulars,\nchosen to span a wide range of rotation curve shapes. We obtain an excellent\nfit for NGC 6822 and WLM, with tight constraints on $M_{200}$, and $c$\nconsistent with $\\Lambda$CDM. However, IC 1613 and DDO 101 give a poor fit. For\nIC 1613, we show that this owes to disequilibria and its uncertain inclination\n$i$; for DDO 101, it owes to its uncertain distance $D$. If we assume $i_{\\rm\nIC1613} \\sim 15^\\circ$ and $D_{\\rm DDO101} \\sim 12$ Mpc, consistent with\ncurrent uncertainties, we are able to fit both galaxies very well. We conclude\nthat $\\Lambda$CDM appears to give an excellent match to dwarf galaxy rotation\ncurves.\n", "  The quark orbital angular momentum component of proton spin, $L_q$, can be\ndefined in QCD as the integral of a Wigner phase space distribution weighting\nthe cross product of the quark's transverse position and momentum. It can also\nbe independently defined from the operator product expansion for the\noff-forward Compton amplitude in terms of a twist-three generalized parton\ndistribution. We provide an explicit link between the two definitions,\nconnecting them through their dependence on partonic intrinsic transverse\nmomentum. Connecting the definitions provides the key for correlating direct\nexperimental determinations of $L_q$, and evaluations through Lattice QCD\ncalculations. The direct observation of quark orbital angular momentum does not\nrequire transverse spin polarization, but can occur using longitudinally\npolarized targets.\n", "  In the first part of this paper we analyze possible quantum computational\ncapacities due to quantum queries associated with equi-partitions of pure\northogonal states. Special emphasis is given to the parity of product states\nand to functional parity. The second part is dedicated to a critical review of\nthe relational encoding of multipartite states across (space-like separated)\nspace-time regions; a property often referred to as \"quantum nonlocality.\"\n", "  We report a new correlated phase of two-dimensional charged carriers in high\nmagnetic fields, manifested by an anisotropic insulating behavior at low\ntemperatures. It appears near Landau level filling factor $\\nu=1/2$ in hole\nsystems confined to wide GaAs quantum wells when the sample is tilted in\nmagnetic field to an intermediate angle. The parallel field component\n($B_{||}$) leads to a crossing of the lowest two Landau levels, and an\nelongated hole wavefunction in the direction of $B_{||}$. Under these\nconditions, the in-plane resistance exhibits an insulating behavior, with the\nresistance along $B_{||}$ more than 10 times smaller than the resistance\nperpendicular to $B_{||}$. We interpret this anisotropic insulating phase as a\ntwo-component, striped Wigner crystal.\n", "  In an accretion of fluid, its velocity may transit from subsonic to\nsupersonic. The point at which such transition occurs is called sonic point and\noften mathematically special. We consider a steady-state and spherically\nsymmetric accretion problem of ideal photon gas in general static spherically\nsymmetric spacetime neglecting back reaction. Our main result is that the EOS\nof ideal photon gas leads to correspondence between its sonic point and the\nphoton sphere of the spacetime in general situations. Despite of the dependence\nof the EOS on the dimension of spacetime, this correspondence holds for\nspacetimes of arbitrary dimensions.\n", "  We consider the FLRW universe in a loop quantum cosmological model filled\nwith the radiation, baryonic matter (with negligible pressure), dark energy and\ndark matter. The dark matter sector is supposed to be of Bose-Einstein\ncondensate type. The Bose-Einstein condensation process in a cosmological\ncontext by supposing it as an approximate first order phase transition, has\nbeen already studied in the literature. Here, we study the evolution of the\nphysical quantities related to the early universe description such as the\nenergy density, temperature and scale factor of the universe, before, during\nand after the condensation process. We also consider in detail the evolution\nera of the universe in a mixed normal-condensate dark matter phase. The\nbehavior and time evolution of the condensate dark matter fraction is also\nanalyzed.\n", "  We give an algorithm for prediction on a quantum computer which is based on a\nlinear regression model with least squares optimisation. Opposed to related\nprevious contributions suffering from the problem of reading out the optimal\nparameters of the fit, our scheme focuses on the machine learning task of\nguessing the output corresponding to a new input given examples of data points.\nFurthermore, we adapt the algorithm to process non-sparse data matrices that\ncan be represented by low-rank approximations, and significantly improve the\ndependency on its condition number. The prediction result can be accessed\nthrough a single qubit measurement or used for further quantum information\nprocessing routines. The algorithm's runtime is logarithmic in the dimension of\nthe input space provided the data is given as quantum information as an input\nto the routine.\n", "  The advent of space-based observatories such as CoRoT and Kepler has enabled\nthe testing of our understanding of stellar evolution on thousands of stars.\nEvolutionary models typically require five input parameters, the mass, initial\nHelium abundance, initial metallicity, mixing- length (assumed to be constant\nover time), and the age to which the star must be evolved. Some of these\nparameters are also very useful in characterizing the associated planets and in\nstudying galactic archaeology. How to obtain these parameters from observations\nrapidly and accurately, specifically in the context of surveys of thousands of\nstars, is an outstanding ques- tion, one that has eluded straightforward\nresolution. For a given star, we typically measure the effective temperature\nand surface metallicity spectroscopically and low-degree oscillation\nfrequencies through space observatories. Here we demonstrate that statistical\nlearning, using artificial neural networks, is successful in determining the\nevolutionary parameters based on spectroscopic and seismic measurements. Our\ntrained networks show robustness over a broad range of parameter space, and\ncritically, are entirely computationally inexpensive and fully automated. We\nanalyze the observations of a few stars using this method and the results com-\npare well to inferences obtained using other techniques. This method is both\ncomputationally cheap and inferentially accurate, paving the way for analyzing\nthe vast quantities of stellar observations from past, current, and future\nmissions.\n", "  In the presence of strong dephasing noise the dynamics of Rydberg gases\nbecomes effectively classical, due to the rapid decay of quantum superpositions\nbetween atomic levels. Recently a great deal of attention has been devoted to\nthe stochastic dynamics that emerges in that limit, revealing several\ninteresting features, including kinetically-constrained glassy behaviour,\nself-similarity and aggregation effects. However, the non-equilibrium physics\nof these systems, in particular in the regime where coherent and dissipative\nprocesses contribute on equal footing, is yet far from being understood. To\nexplore this we study the dynamics of a small one-dimensional Rydberg lattice\ngas subject to dephasing noise by numerically integrating the quantum Master\nequation. We interpolate between the coherent and the strongly dephased regime\nby defining a generalised concept of a blockade length. We find indications\nthat the main features observed in the strongly dissipative limit persist when\nthe dissipation is not strong enough to annihilate quantum coherences at the\ndynamically relevant time scales. These features include the existence of a\ntime-dependent Rydberg blockade radius, and a growth of the density of\nexcitations which is compatible with the power-law behaviour expected in the\nclassical limit.\n", "  The high tunability of the density of states of graphene makes it an ideal\nprobe of quantum transport in different regimes. In particular, the\nsupercurrent that can flow through a non-superconducting (N) material connected\nto two superconducting electrodes, crucially depends on the lenghth of the N\nrelative to the superconducting coherence length. Using graphene as the N\nmaterial we have investigated the full range of the superconducting proximity\neffect, from short to long diffusive junctions. By combining several\nS/graphene/S samples with different contacts and lengths, and measuring their\ngate-dependent critical currents ($ I_c $) and normal state resistance $ R_N $,\nwe compare the product $eR_NI_c$ to the relevant energies, the Thouless energy\nin long junctions and the superconducting gap of the contacts in short\njunctions, over three orders of magnitude of Thouless energy. The experimental\nvariations strikingly follow a universal law, close to the predictions of the\nproximity effect both in the long and short junction regime, as well as in the\ncrossover region, thereby revealing the interplay of the different energy\nscales. Differences in the numerical coefficients reveal the crucial role\nplayed by the interfacial barrier between graphene and the superconducting\nelectrodes, which reduces the supercurrent in both short and long junctions.\nSurprisingly the reduction of supercurrent is independent of the gate voltage\nand of the nature of the electrodes. A reduced induced gap and Thouless energy\nare extracted, revealing the role played by the dwell time in the barrier in\nthe short junction, and an effective increased diffusion time in the long\njunction. We compare our results to the theoretical predictions of Usadel\nequations and numerical simulations which better reproduce experiments with\nimperfect NS interfaces.\n", "  We propose a scheme to realize a highly efficient solid state source of\nphoton pairs using cavity-assisted stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP)\nin a single quantum dot, where a single photon from pump pulse and two stokes\nphotons from cavity mode drives the Raman transition. The Autler-Townes\ndoublet, generated by using a resonant continuous wave laser between biexciton\nand exciton states, and two-photon-resonant transition through strongly coupled\ncavity mode are utilized to facilitate (1+2)type Raman transition in the\nquantum dot. We show in the case of weak pump although the probability of\ngenerating two photons in cavity mode is small without cavity damping but\ntwo-photon-resonant emission is enhanced by cavity damping within strong\ncoupling regime. We also discuss spectrum of the generated photon pair and\nphoton-photon correlations in the generated photon pair. The efficiency of two\nphoton source could be more than 80\\% in current experimental conditions.\n", "  We study pattern-forming dissipative systems in growing domains. We\ncharacterize classes of boundary conditions that allow for defect-free growth\nand derive universal scaling laws for the wavenumber in the bulk of the domain.\nScalings are based on a description of striped patterns in semi-bounded domains\nvia strain-displacement relations. We compare predictions with direct\nsimulations in the Swift-Hohenberg, the Complex Ginzburg-Landau, the\nCahn-Hilliard, and reaction-diffusion equations.\n", "  Ray tracing radiative transfer is a powerful method for comparing theoretical\nmodels of black hole accretion flows and jets with observations. We present a\npublic code, grtrans, for carrying out such calculations in the Kerr metric,\nincluding the full treatment of polarised radiative transfer and parallel\ntransport along geodesics. The code is written in Fortran 90 and efficiently\nparallelises with OpenMP, and the full code and several components have Python\ninterfaces. We describe several tests which are used for verifiying the code,\nand we compare the results for polarised thin accretion disc and semi-analytic\njet problems with those from the literature as examples of its use. Along the\nway, we provide accurate fitting functions for polarised synchrotron emission\nand transfer coefficients from thermal and power law distribution functions,\nand compare results from numerical integration and quadrature solutions of the\npolarised radiative transfer equations. We also show that all transfer\ncoefficients can play an important role in predicted images and polarisation\nmaps of the Galactic center black hole, Sgr A*, at submillimetre wavelengths.\n", "  In order to study the dependence of the coercive force of sintered magnets on\ntemperature, nucleation and domain wall propagation at the grain boundary are\nstudied as rate-determining processes of the magnetization reversal phenomena\nin magnets consisting of bulk hard magnetic grains contacting via grain\nboundaries of a soft magnetic material. These systems have been studied\nanalytically for a continuum model at zero temperature (A. Sakuma, et al. J.\nMag. Mag. Mat. {\\bf 84} 52 (1990)). In the present study, the temperature\ndependence is studied by making use of the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert\nequation at finite temperatures. In particular, the threshold fields for\nnucleation and domain wall propagation are obtained as functions of ratios of\nmagnetic interactions and anisotropies of the soft and hard magnets for various\ntemperatures. It was found that the threshold field for domain wall propagation\nis robust against thermal fluctuations, while that for nucleation is fragile.\nThe microscopic mechanisms of the observed temperature dependence are\ndiscussed.\n", "  We consider collision of two geodesic particles near the horizon of such an\naxially symmetric black hole (rotating or static) that the metric coefficient\n$g_{\\phi \\phi }\\rightarrow 0$ there. It is shown that (both for regular and\nsingular horizons) the energy in the centre of mass frame $% E_{c.m.}$ is\nindefinitely large even without fine-tuning of particles' parameters.\nKinematically, this is collision between two rapid particles that approach the\nhorizon almost with the speed of light but at different angles. The latter is\nthe reason why the relative velocity tends to that of light, hence to high\n$E_{c.m.}$. Our approach is model-independent. It relies on general properties\nof geometry and is insensitive to the details of material source that supports\nthe geometies of the type under consideration. For several particular models\n(the stringy black hole, the Brans-Dicke analogue of the Schwarzschild metric\nand the Janis-Newman-Winicour one) we recover the results found in literature\npreviously.\n", "  Using the Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis code BPASS, we have\ncalculated the rates, timescales and mass distributions for binary black hole\nmergers as a function of metallicity. We consider these in the context of the\nrecently reported 1st LIGO event detection. We find that the event has a very\nlow probability of arising from a stellar population with initial metallicity\nmass fraction above Z=0.010 (Z>0.5Zsun). Binary black hole merger events with\nthe reported masses are most likely in populations below 0.008 (Z<0.4Zsun).\nEvents of this kind can occur at all stellar population ages from ~3 Myr up to\nthe age of the universe, but constitute only 0.1 to 0.4 per cent of binary BH\nmergers between metallicities of Z=0.001 to 0.008. However at metallicity\nZ=0.0001, 26 per cent of binary BH mergers would be expected to have the\nreported masses. At this metallicity the progenitor merger times can be close\nto ~10Gyr and rotationally-mixed stars evolving through quasi-homogeneous\nevolution, due to mass transfer in a binary, dominate the rate. The masses\ninferred for the black holes in the binary progenitor of GW\\,150914 are amongst\nthe most massive expected at anything but the lowest metallicities in our\nmodels. We discuss the implications of our analysis for the electromagnetic\nfollow-up of future LIGO event detections.\n", "  We study the dynamical magnetic susceptibility of a strongly correlated\nelectronic system in the presence of a time-dependent hopping field, deriving a\ngeneralized Bethe-Salpeter equation which is valid also out of equilibrium.\nFocusing on the single-orbital Hubbard model within the time-dependent\nHartree-Fock approximation, we solve the equation in the non-equilibrium\nadiabatic regime, obtaining a closed expression for the transverse magnetic\nsusceptibility. From this, we provide a rigorous definition of non-equilibrium\n(time-dependent) magnon frequencies and exchange parameters, expressed in terms\nof non-equilibrium single-electron Green functions and self-energies. In the\nparticular case of equilibrium, we recover previously known results.\n", "  A combined analysis of the reactions $\\pi^-p\\rightarrow K^0\\Lambda$ and $\\eta\nn$ is carried out with a chiral quark model. The data in the center-of-mass\n(c.m.) energy range from threshold up to $W\\simeq 1.8$ GeV are reasonably\ndescribed. For $\\pi^-p\\rightarrow K^0\\Lambda$, it is found that $N(1535)S_{11}$\nand $N(1650)S_{11}$ paly crucial roles near threshold. The $N(1650)S_{11}$\nresonance contributes to the reaction through configuration mixing with\n$N(1535)S_{11}$. The constructive interference between $N(1535)S_{11}$ and\n$N(1650)S_{11}$ is responsible for the peak structure around threshold in the\ntotal cross section. The $n$-pole, $u$- and $t$-channel backgrounds provide\nsignificant contributions to the reaction as well. While, for the\n$\\pi^-p\\rightarrow \\eta n$ process, the \"first peak\" in the total cross section\nis dominant by $N(1535)S_{11}$, which has a sizeable destructive interference\nwith $N(1650)S_{11}$. Around $P_\\pi \\simeq $ 1.0 GeV/c ($W\\simeq 1.7$ GeV),\nthere seems to be a small bump structure in the total cross section, which\nmight be explained by the interference between the $u$-channel and\n$N(1650)S_{11}$. The $N(1520)D_{13}$ resonance notably affects the angle\ndistributions of the cross sections, although less effects are seen in the\ntotal cross section. The role of $P$-wave state $N(1720)P_{13}$ should be\nfurther confirmed by future experiments. If $N(1720)P_{13}$ has a narrow width\nof $\\Gamma\\simeq 120$ MeV as found in our previous work by a study of the\n$\\pi^0$ photoproduction processes, obvious evidence should be seen in the\n$\\pi^-p\\rightarrow K^0\\Lambda$ and $\\eta n$ processes as well.\n", "  It is shown that electro (magneto) static sector of Maxwell's electrodynamics\ncoupled to the dilaton field in a string theory form possesses the symmetry\ngroup of the stationary General Relativity in vacuum. Performing the Ernst\nformalism, we develope a technique for generation of exact solutions in this\nmodified electrodynamics on the base of the normalized Ehlers symmetry\ntransformation. In the electrostatic case, we construct and study a general\nclass of spherically symmetric solutions that describes a point-like sourse of\nthe Coulomb type. It is shown that this source is characterized by asymptotical\nfreedom of the electrostatic interaction at short distances. Also it is\nestablished that the total electrostatic energy of this source is finite and\ninversely proportional to the dilaton-Maxwell coupling constant.\n", "  The Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (aLIGO) has\ndetected direct signals of gravitational waves (GWs) from GW150914. The event\nwas a merger of binary black holes whose masses are $36^{+5}_{-4}M_{\\odot}$ and\n$29^{+4}_{-4}M_{\\odot}$. Such binary systems are expected to be directly\nevolved from stellar binary systems or formed by dynamical interactions of\nblack holes in dense stellar environments. Here we derive the binary black hole\nmerger rate based on the nearby ultra-luminous X-ray source (ULX) luminosity\nfunction (LF) under the assumption that binary black holes evolve through X-ray\nemitting phases. We obtain the binary black hole merger rate as $5.8 ({t}_{\\rm\nULX}/{0.1 \\ \\rm Myr})^{-1} \\lambda^{-0.6} \\exp{(-0.30\\lambda)} \\ {\\rm Gpc^{-3}\\\nyr^{-1}}$, where $t_{\\rm ULX}$ is the typical duration of the ULX phase and\n$\\lambda$ is the Eddington ratio in luminosity. This is coincident with the\nevent rate inferred from the detection of GW150914 as well as the predictions\nbased on binary population synthesis models. Although we are currently unable\nto constrain the Eddington ratio of ULXs in luminosity due to the uncertainties\nof our models and measured binary black hole merger event rates, further X-ray\nand GW data will allow us to narrow down the range of the Eddington ratios of\nULXs. We also find the cumulative merger rate for the mass range of\n$5M_\\odot\\le M_{\\rm BH}\\le100M_\\odot$ inferred from the ULX LF is consistent\nwith that estimated by the aLIGO collaboration considering various\nastrophysical conditions such as the mass function of black holes.\n", "  We study radiative energy transfer between a donor-acceptor pair across a\nhyperbolic metamaterial slab. We show that similar to a perfect lens a\nhyperbolic lens allows for giant energy transfer rates. For a realistic\nrealization of a hyperbolic multilayer metamaterial we find an enhancement of\nup to three orders of magnitude with respect to the transfer rates across a\nplasmonic silver film of the same size especially for frequencies which\ncoincide with the epsilon-near zero and the epsilonnear pole frequencies.\nFurthermore, we compare exact results based on the S-matrix method with results\nobtained from effective medium theory. Our finding of very large dipole-dipole\ninteraction at distances of the order of a wavelength has important\nconsequences for producing radiative heat transfer, quantum entanglement etc.\n", "  Breakup cross sections are determined for the Borromean nucleus 22C by using\na four-body eikonal model, including Coulomb corrections. Bound and continuum\nstates are constructed within a 20C + n + n three-body model in hyperspherical\ncoordinates. We compute continuum states with the correct asymptotic behavior\nthrough the R-matrix method. For the n+ n potential, we use the Minnesota\ninteraction. As there is no precise experimental information on 21C, we define\ndifferent parameter sets for the 20C + n potentials. These parameter sets\nprovide different scattering lengths, and resonance energies of an expected\n3/2+ excited state. Then we analyze the 22C ground-state energy and rms radius,\nas well as E1 strength distributions and breakup cross sections. The E1\nstrength distribution presents an enhancement at low energies. Its amplitude is\nassociated with the low binding energy, rather than with a three-body\nresonance. We show that the shape of the cross section at low energies is\nsensitive to the ground-state properties. In addition, we suggest the existence\nof a low-energy 2+ resonance, which should be observable in breakup\nexperiments.\n", "  Basic features of nonstrange vector and axial vector mesons are analyzed in\nthe framework of a chiral quark model that includes nonlocal four fermion\ncouplings. Unknown model parameters are determined from some input values of\nmasses and decay constants, while nonlocal form factors are taken from a fit to\nlattice QCD results for effective quark propagators. Numerical results show a\ngood agreement with the observed meson phenomenology.\n", "  The extragalactic gamma-ray and neutrino emission may have a contribution\nfrom dark matter (DM) annihilations. In the case of discrepancies between\nobservations and standard predictions, one could infer the DM pair annihilation\ncross section into cosmic rays by studying the shape of the energy spectrum. So\nfar all analyses of the extragalactic DM signal have assumed the standard\ncosmological model (LambdaCDM) as the underlying theory. However, there are\nalternative DM scenarios where the number of low-mass objects is significantly\nsuppressed. Therefore the characteristics of the gamma-ray and neutrino\nemission in these models may differ from LambdaCDM as a result. Here we show\nthat the extragalactic isotropic signal in these alternative models has a\nsimilar energy dependence to that in LambdaCDM, but the overall normalisation\nis reduced. The similarities between the energy spectra combined with the flux\nsuppression could lead one to misinterpret possible evidence for models beyond\nLambdaCDM as being due to CDM particles annihilating with a much weaker cross\nsection than expected.\n", "  Searches for new hadronic resonances typically focus on high-mass spectra,\ndue to overwhelming QCD backgrounds and detector trigger rates. We present a\nstudy of searches for relatively low-mass hadronic resonances at the LHC in the\ncase that the resonance is boosted by recoiling against a well-measured\nhigh-$p_{\\textrm{T}}$ probe such as a muon, photon or jet. The hadronic decay\nof the resonance is then reconstructed either as a single large-radius jet or\nas a resolved pair of standard narrow-radius jets, balanced in transverse\nmomentum to the probe. We show that the existing 2015 LHC dataset of $pp$\ncollisions with $\\int\\mathcal{L}dt = 4\\ \\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ should already have\npowerful sensitivity to a generic $Z'$ model which couples only to quarks, for\n$Z'$ masses ranging from 20-500 GeV/c$^2$.\n", "  Via gauge-gravity duality, relaxation of far-from-equilibrium initial states\nin a strongly coupled gauge theory has been investigated. In the system we\nconsider in this paper there are two ways where the state under study can\ndeviate from its equilibrium: anisotropic pressure and time-dependent\nexpectation value of a scalar operator with \\Delta=3. In the gravity theory,\nthis system corresponds to Einstein's general relativity with a non-trivial\nmetric, including the anisotropy function, coupled to a massive scalar matter\nfield. We study the effect of different initial configurations for scalar field\nand anisotropy function on physical processes such as thermalization, i.e. time\nevolution of event horizon, equilibration of the expectation value of scalar\noperator and isotropization. We also discuss time ordering of these\ntime-scales.\n", "  Regulator functions applied to two- and three-nucleon forces are a necessary\ningredient in many-body calculations based on chiral effective field theory\ninteractions. These interactions have been developed recently with a variety of\ndifferent cutoff forms, including regulating both the momentum transfer (local)\nand the relative momentum (nonlocal). While in principle any regulator that\nsuppresses high momentum modes can be employed, in practice artifacts are\ninevitable in current power counting schemes. Artifacts from particular\nregulators may cause significant distortions of the physics or may affect\nmany-body convergence rates, so understanding their nature is important. Here\nwe characterize the differences between cutoff effects using uniform matter at\nHartree-Fock and second-order in the interaction as a testbed. This provides a\nclean laboratory to isolate phase-space effects of various regulators on both\ntwo- and three-nucleon interactions. We test the normal-ordering approximation\nfor three-nucleon forces in nuclear matter and find that the relative size of\nthe residual 3N contributions is sensitive to the employed regularization\nscheme.\n", "  Time-dependent systems have recently been shown to support novel types of\ntopological order that cannot be realised in static systems. In this paper, we\nconsider a range of time-dependent, interacting systems in one dimension that\nare protected by an Abelian symmetry group. We classify the distinct\ntopological phases that can exist in this setting and find that they may be\ndescribed by a bulk invariant associated with the unitary evolution of the\nclosed system. In the open system, nontrivial phases correspond to the\nappearance of edge modes in the many-body quasienergy spectrum, which relate to\nthe bulk invariant through a form of bulk-edge correspondence. We introduce\nsimple models which realise nontrivial dynamical phases in a number of cases,\nand outline a loop construction that can be used to generate such phases more\ngenerally.\n", "  Hybrid quantum systems (HQSs) have attracted several research interests in\nthe last years. In this Letter, we report on the design, fabrication, and\ncharacterization of a novel diamond architecture for HQSs that consists of a\nhigh quality thin circular diamond membrane with embedded near-surface\nnitrogen-vacancy centers (NVCs). To demonstrate this architecture, we employed\nthe NVCs by means of their optical and spin interfaces as nanosensors of the\nmotion of the membrane under static pressure and in-resonance vibration, as\nwell as the residual stress of the membrane. Driving the membrane at its\nfundamental resonance mode, we observed coupling of this vibrational mode to\nthe spin of the NVCs by Hahn echo signal. Our realization of this architecture\nwill enable futuristic HQS-based applications in diamond piezometry and\nvibrometry, as well as spin-mechanical and mechanically mediated spin-spin\ncoupling in quantum information science.\n", "  We present post-Newtonian $N$-body simulations on mergers of accreting\nstellar-mass black holes (BHs), where such general relativistic effects as the\npericenter shift and gravitational wave (GW) emission are taken into\nconsideration. The attention is concentrated on the effects of the dynamical\nfriction and the Hoyle-Lyttleton mass accretion by ambient gas. We consider a\nsystem composed of ten BHs with initial mass of $30~M_\\odot$. As a result, we\nshow that mergers of accreting stellar-mass BHs are classified into four types:\na gas drag-driven, an interplay-driven, a three body-driven, or an\naccretion-driven merger. We find that BH mergers proceed before significant\nmass accretion, even if the accretion rate is $\\sim10$ Eddington accretion\nrate, and then all BHs can merge into one heavy BH. Using the simulation\nresults for a wide range of parameters, we derive a critical accretion rate\n($\\dot{m}_{\\rm c}$), below which the BH growth is promoted faster by mergers.\nAlso, it is found that the effect of the recoil by the GW emission can reduce\n$\\dot{m}_{\\rm c}$ especially in gas number density higher than $10^8~{\\rm\ncm}^{-3}$, and enhance the escape probability of merged BHs. Very recently, a\ngravitational wave event, GW150914, as a result of the merger of a $\\sim\n30~M_\\odot$ BH binary has been detected (Abbott et al. 2016). Based on the\npresent simulations, the BH merger in GW150914 is likely to be driven by\nthree-body encounters accompanied by a few $M_\\odot$ of gas accretion, in\nhigh-density environments like dense interstellar clouds or galactic nuclei.\n", "  From the Hamiltonian connecting the inside and outside of an Fabry-Perot\ncavity, which is derived from the Maxwell boundary conditions at a mirror of\nthe cavity, a master equation of a non-Lindblad form is derived when the cavity\nembeds matters, although we can transform it to the Lindblad form by performing\nthe rotating-wave approximation to the connecting Hamiltonian. We calculate\nabsorption spectra by these Lindblad and non-Lindblad master equations and also\nby the Maxwell boundary conditions in the framework of the classical\nelectrodynamics, which we consider the most reliable approach. We found that,\ncompared to the Lindblad master equation, the absorption spectra by the\nnon-Lindblad one agree better with those by the Maxwell boundary conditions.\nAlthough the discrepancy is highlighted only in the ultra-strong light-matter\ninteraction regime with a relatively large broadening, the master equation of\nthe non-Lindblad form is preferable rather than of the Lindblad one for\npursuing the consistency with the classical electrodynamics.\n", "  The statistics and origin of the first discrete plastic event in a one\ndislocation dynamics simulation are studied. This is done via a linear\nstability analysis of the evolving dislocation configuration up to the onset of\nirreversible plasticity. It is found, via a fold catastrophe, the dislocation\nconfiguration prior to loading directly determines the stress at which the\nplastic event occurs and that between one and two trigger dislocations are\ninvolved. The resulting irreversible plastic strain arising from the\ninstability is found to be highly correlated with these triggering\ndislocations.\n", "  We propose a scheme for deterministic generation and long-term stabilization\nof entanglement between two electronic spin qubits confined in spatially\nseparated quantum dots. Our approach relies on an electronic quantum bus,\nconsisting either of quantum Hall edge channels or surface acoustic waves, that\ncan mediate long-range coupling between localized spins over distances of tens\nof micrometers. Since the entanglement is actively stabilized by dissipative\ndynamics, our scheme is inherently robust against noise and imperfections.\n", "  The unprecedented quality of the observations available from the Atacama\nLarge Millimetre/sub-millimetre Array (ALMA) calls for analysis methods making\nthe best of them. Reconstructing in space the morphology and kinematics of\nradio sources is an underdetermined problem that requires imposing additional\nconstraints for its solution. The hypothesis of rotational invariance about a\nwell-defined star axis, which is a good approximation to the description of the\ngas envelopes of many evolved stars and protostars, is particularly efficient\nin this role. In the first part of the article, a systematic use of simulated\nobservations allows for identifying the main problems and for constructing\nquantities aimed at solving them. In particular the evaluation of the\norientation of the star axis in space and the differentiation between expansion\nalong the star axis and rotation about it are given special attention. The use\nof polar rather than Cartesian sky coordinates is shown to better match the\nmorphology and kinematics of actual stars. The radial dependence of the gas\ndensity and temperature and the possible presence of velocity gradients are\nbriefly considered. In the second part, the results obtained in the first part\nare applied to a few stars taken as examples with the aim of evaluating their\nusefulness when applied to concrete cases. A third part takes stock of what\nprecedes and formulates some guidelines for modelling the radio emission of\naxisymmetric radio sources, limited however to the mathematics and geometry of\nthe problem, physics considerations being ignored.\n", "  During their propagation through intergalactic space, ultrahigh energy cosmic\nrays (UHECRs) interact with the background radiation fields. These interactions\ngive rise to energetic electron/positron pairs and photons which in turn feed\nelectromagnetic cascades, contributing to the isotropic gamma-ray background\n(IGRB). The gamma-ray flux level generated in this way highly depends upon the\nUHECR propagation distance, as well as the evolution of their sources with\nredshift. Recently, the Fermi-LAT collaboration reported that the majority of\nthe total extragalactic gamma-ray flux originates from extragalactic point\nsources. This posits a stringent upper limit on the IGRB generated via UHECR\npropagation, and subsequently constrains their abundance in the distant\nUniverse. Focusing on the contribution of UHECR at energies below the ankle\nwithin a narrow energy band ($(1-4)\\times 10^{18}$eV), we calculate the diffuse\ngamma-ray flux generated through UHECR propagation, normalizing the total\ncosmic ray energy budget in this band to that measured. We find that in order\nto not over-produce the new IGRB limit, a local \"fog\" of UHECR produced by\nnearby sources may exist, with a possible non-negligible contribution from our\nGalaxy. Following the assumption that a given fraction of the observed IGRB at\n820GeV originates from UHECR, we obtain a constraint on the maximum distance\nfor the majority of their sources. With other unresolved source populations\nstill contaminating the new IGRB limit, and UHECR above the ankle invariably\ncontributing also to this background, the results presented here are rather\nconservative.\n", "  By using Gutzwiller projected fermionic wave functions and variational Monte\nCarlo technique, we study the spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg model with the\nfirst-neighbor ($J_1$), second-neighbor ($J_2$), and additional scalar chiral\ninteraction $J_{\\chi}{\\bf S}_i \\cdot ({\\bf S}_j \\times {\\bf S}_k)$ on the\ntriangular lattice. In the non-magnetic phase of the $J_1-J_2$ triangular model\nwith $0.08 \\lesssim J_2/J_1 \\lesssim 0.16$, recent density-matrix\nrenormalization group (DMRG) studies [Zhu and White, Phys. Rev. B {\\bf 92},\n041105 (2015); Hu, Gong, Zhu, and Sheng, Phys. Rev. B {\\bf 92}, 140403 (2015)]\nfind a possible gapped spin liquid with the signal of a competition between a\nchiral and a $Z_2$ spin liquid. Motivated by the DMRG results, we consider the\nchiral interaction $J_{\\chi}{\\bf S}_i \\cdot ({\\bf S}_j \\times {\\bf S}_k)$ as a\npertubation for this non-magnetic phase. We find that with growing $J_{\\chi}$,\nthe gapless U(1) Dirac spin liquid, which has the best variational energy for\n$J_{\\chi}=0$, exhibits the energy instability towards a gapped spin liquid with\nnon-trivial magnetic fluxes and nonzero chiral order. We calculate topological\nChern number and ground-state degeneracy, both of which identify this flux\nstate as the chiral spin liquid with fractionalized Chern number $C=1/2$ and\ntwo-fold topological degeneracy. Our results indicate a positive direction to\nstabilize a chiral spin liquid near the non-magnetic phase of the $J_1-J_2$\ntriangular model.\n", "  To discuss the dineutron correlation in the ground state, the quasi-free\nneutron knockout reaction on $^6$He is investigated.In the present work, the\nmomentum distribution of the two emitted neutrons is calculated with the\n$\\alpha$~+~$n$~+~$n$ three-body model and a simple reaction model to assess the\neffects of the knockout process via the $^5$He resonance and the target\ndependence in the momentum distribution. A clear signature of the dineutron\ncorrelation can be obtained by choosing the kinematical condition so the\nprocess via the $^5$He resonance is excluded because the $^5$He resonance\ndrastically changes the momentum distribution. Using the proton target is\nimportant in the quantitative discussion on the dineutron correlation by the\nknockout reaction. In addition to theoretical arguments, a possible\nexperimental setup to determine the dineutron correlation via the quasi-free\nknockout reaction is considered.\n", "  In this work we study the distribution of temporal power-law decay indices,\n$\\alpha$, in the Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) afterglow phase, fitted for $176$ GRBs\n(139 long GRBs, 12 short GRBs {\\it with extended emission} and 25 X-Ray Flashes\n(XRFs)) with known redshifts. These indices are compared with the temporal\ndecay index, $\\alpha_W$, derived with the light curve fitting using the\n\\cite{willingale07} model. This model fitting yields similar distributions of\n$\\alpha_W$ to the fitted $\\alpha$, but for individual bursts a difference can\nbe significant. Analysis of ($\\alpha$, $L_a$) distribution, where $L_a$ is the\ncharacteristic luminosity at the end of the plateau, reveals only a weak\ncorrelation of these quantities. However, we discovered a significant regular\ntrend when studying GRB $\\alpha$ values along the \\cite{dainotti2008}\ncorrelation between $L_a$ and the end time of the plateau emission in the rest\nframe, $T_a^*$, hereafter LT correlation. We note a systematic variation of the\n$\\alpha$ parameter distribution with luminosity for any selected $T_a^*$. We\nanalyze this systematics with respect to the fitted LT correlation line,\nexpecting that the presented trend may allow to constrain the GRB physical\nmodels. We also attempted to use the derived correlation of $\\alpha(T_a)$\nversus $L_a(T_a)$ to diminish the luminosity scatter related to the variations\nof $\\alpha$ along the LT distribution, a step forward in the effort of\nstandardizing GRBs. A proposed toy model accounting for this systematics\napplied to the analyzed GRB distribution results in a slight increase of the LT\ncorrelation coefficient.\n", "  We consider the holographic computation of two dimensional conformal field\ntheory partition functions on non-orientable surfaces. We classify the three\ndimensional geometries that give bulk saddle point contributions to the\npartition function, and find that there are fewer saddles than in the\norientable case. For example, for the Klein bottle there is a single smooth\nsaddle and a single additional saddle with an orbifold singularity. We argue\nthat one must generally include singular bulk saddle points in order to\nreproduce the CFT results. We also discuss loop corrections to these partition\nfunctions for the Klein bottle.\n", "  Adsorption and dissociation of hydrocarbons on metallic surfaces represent\ncrucial steps to carburization of metal. Here, we use density functional theory\ntotal energy calculations with the climbing-image nudged elastic band method to\nestimate the adsorption energies and dissociation barriers for different CO\ncoverages with surface supercells of different sizes. For the absorption of CO,\nthe contribution from van der Waals interaction in the computation of\nadsorption parameters is found important in small systems with high\nCO-coverages. The dissociation process involves carbon insertion into the Fe\nsurface causing a lattice deformation that requires a larger surface system for\nunrestricted relaxation. We show that, in larger surface systems associated\nwith dilute CO-coverages, the dissociation barrier is significantly decreased.\nThe elastic deformation of the surface is generic and can potentially\napplicable for all similar metal-hydrocarbon reactions and therefore a dilute\ncoverage is necessary for the simulation of these reactions as isolated\nprocesses.\n", "  Allowing a single electron to hop to next-nearest neighbours (NNN) in\naddition to the closest atomic sites in the Holstein model, a modified Trugman\nmethod is applied to exactly calculate the effect on the polaronic effective\nmass in one, two, and three dimensions, building on the previous study of the\none-dimensional NNN Holstein model. We also present perturbative calculations\nand a heuristic scaling factor for the coupling strength and ion frequency to\nnearly map the NNN Holstein model back onto the original Holstein model. When\naccount is taken of the modified electronic bandwidth near the electron energy,\nwe find that including NNN hopping effectively increases the polaron effective\nmass.\n", "  We systematically measure and analyze the spin diffusion length and the spin\nHall effect in Pt with a wide range of conductivities using the spin absorption\nmethod in lateral spin valve devices. We observe a linear relation between the\nspin diffusion length and the conductivity, evidencing that the spin relaxation\nin Pt is governed by the Elliott-Yafet mechanism. We find a single intrinsic\nspin Hall conductivity ($\\sigma_{SH}^{int}=1600\\pm150\\: \\Omega^{-1}cm^{-1}$)\nfor Pt in the full range studied which is in good agreement with theory. For\nthe first time we have obtained the crossover between the moderately dirty and\nthe superclean scaling regimes of the spin Hall effect by tuning the\nconductivity. This is equivalent to that obtained for the anomalous Hall\neffect. Our results explain the spread of the spin Hall angle values in the\nliterature and find a route to maximize this important parameter.\n", "  We extend the DFSZ invisible axion model to simultaneously explain small\nDirac neutrino masses and cosmic matter-antimatter asymmetry. After the\nPeccei-Quinn and electroweak symmetry breaking, the effective Yukawa couplings\nof the Dirac neutrinos to the standard model Higgs scalar can be highly\nsuppressed by the ratio of the vacuum expectation value of an iso-triplet Higgs\nscalar over the masses of some heavy gauge-singlet fermions, iso-doublet Higgs\nscalars or iso-triplet fermions. The iso-triplet fields can carry a zero or\nnonzero hypercharge. Through the decays of the heavy gauge-singlet fermions,\niso-doublet scalars or iso-triplet fermions, we can obtain a lepton asymmetry\nin the left-handed leptons and an opposite lepton asymmetry in the right-handed\nneutrinos. Since the right-handed neutrinos do not participate in the sphaleron\nprocesses, the left-handed lepton asymmetry can be partially converted to a\nbaryon asymmetry.\n", "  We extend the standard model by three types of inert fields including\nMajorana fermion singlets/triplets, real Higgs singlets/triplets and leptonic\nHiggs doublets. In the presence of a softly broken lepton number and an exactly\nconserved Z_2 discrete symmetry, these inert fields together can mediate a\none-loop diagram for a Majorana neutrino mass generation. The heavier inert\nfields can decay to realize a successful leptogenesis while the lightest inert\nfield can provide a stable dark matter candidate. As an example, we demonstrate\nthe leptogenesis by the inert Higgs doublet decays. We also perform a\nsystematic study on the inert Higgs triplet dark matter scenario where the\ninterference between the gauge and Higgs portal interactions can significantly\naffect the dark matter properties.\n", "  Large scale surveys of Andromeda's resolved stellar populations have\nrevolutionized our view of this galaxy over the past decade. The combination of\nlarge-scale, contiguous photometric surveys and pointed spectroscopic surveys\nhas been particularly powerful for discovering substructure and disentangling\nthe structural components of Andromeda. The SPLASH (Spectroscopic and\nPhotometric Landscape of Andromeda's Stellar Halo) survey consists of broad-\nand narrow-band imaging and spectroscopy of red giant branch stars in lines of\nsight ranging in distance from 2 kpc to more than 200 kpc from Andromeda's\ncenter. The SPLASH data reveal a power-law surface brightness profile extending\nto at least two-thirds of Andromeda's virial radius (Gilbert et al. 2012), a\nmetallicity gradient extending to at least 100 kpc from Andromeda's center\n(Gilbert et al. 2014), and evidence of a significant population of heated disk\nstars in Andromeda's inner halo (Dorman et al. 2013). We are also using the\nvelocity distribution of halo stars to measure the tangential motion of\nAndromeda (Beaton et al., in prep).\n", "  We present a general method to obtain the exact rate function\n$\\Psi_{[a,b]}(k)$ controlling the large deviation probability\n$\\text{Prob}[\\mathcal{I}_N[a,b]=kN] \\asymp e^{-N\\Psi_{[a,b]}(k)}$ that a $N\n\\times N$ sparse random matrix has $\\mathcal{I}_N[a,b]=kN$ eigenvalues inside\nthe interval $[a,b]$. The method is applied to study the eigenvalue statistics\nin two distinct examples: (i) the shifted index number of eigenvalues for an\nensemble of Erd\\\"os-R\\'enyi graphs and (ii) the number of eigenvalues within a\nbounded region of the spectrum for the Anderson model on regular random graphs.\nA salient feature of the rate function in both cases is that, unlike\nrotationally invariant random matrices, it is asymmetric with respect to its\nminimum. The asymmetric character depends on the disorder in a way that is\ncompatible with the distinct eigenvalue statistics corresponding to localized\nand delocalized eigenstates. The results also show that the number variance\n$\\sigma_{N}^{2}$ for the Anderson model on a regular graph scales as\n$\\sigma_{N}^{2} \\propto N$ ($N \\gg 1$) for any nonzero disorder, which is\nconsistent with the absence of level-repulsion in the extended phase. Our\ntheoretical findings are thoroughly compared to numerical diagonalization in\nboth cases, showing a reasonable good agreement.\n", "  Pure spin currents in semiconductors are essential for implementation in the\nnext generation of spintronic elements. Heterostructures of III- nitride\nsemiconductors are currently employed as central building-blocks for lighting\nand high-power devices. Moreover, the long relaxation times and the spin-orbit\ncoupling (SOC) in these materials indicate them as privileged hosts for spin\ncurrents and related phenomena. Spin pumping is an efficient mechanism for the\ninception of spin current and its conversion into charge current in\nnon-magnetic metals and semiconductors with Rashba SOC $via$ spin Hall effects.\nWe report on the generation in $n$-GaN:Si\\,--\\,at room temperature and through\nspin pumping\\,--\\,of pure spin current, fundamental for the understanding of\nthe spin dynamics in these non-centrosymmetric Rashba systems. We find for\n$n$-GaN:Si a spin Hall angle $\\theta_{\\mathrm{SH}}$=$3.03\\times10^{-3}$,\nexceeding by one order of magnitude those reported for other semiconductors,\npointing at III-nitrides as particularly efficient spin current generators.\n", "  We study a one-parameter generalization of the symmetric simple exclusion\nprocess on a one dimensional lattice. In addition to the usual dynamics (where\nparticles can hop with equal rates to the left or to the right with an\nexclusion constraint), annihilation and creation of pairs can occur. The system\nis driven out of equilibrium by two reservoirs at the boundaries. In this\nsetting the model is still integrable: it is related to the open XXZ spin chain\nthrough a gauge transformation. This allows us to compute the full spectrum of\nthe Markov matrix using Bethe equations. Then, we derive the spectral gap in\nthe thermodynamical limit. We also show that the stationary state can be\nexpressed in a matrix product form permitting to compute the multi-points\ncorrelation functions as well as the mean value of the lattice current and of\nthe creation-annihilation current. Finally the variance of the lattice current\nis exactly computed for a finite size system. In the thermodynamical limit, it\nmatches perfectly the value obtained from the associated macroscopic\nfluctuation theory. It provides a confirmation of the macroscopic fluctuation\ntheory for dissipative system from a microscopic point of view.\n", "  Superradiance has been extensively studied in the 1970s and 1980s in the\nregime of superfluores-cence, where a large number of atoms are initially\nexcited. Cooperative scattering in the linear-optics regime, or \"single-photon\nsuperradiance\" , has been investigated much more recently, and superra-diant\ndecay has also been predicted, even for a spherical sample of large extent and\nlow density, where the distance between atoms is much larger than the\nwavelength. Here, we demonstrate this effect experimentally by directly\nmeasuring the decay rate of the off-axis fluorescence of a large and dilute\ncloud of cold rubidium atoms after the sudden switch-off of a low-intensity\nlaser driving the atomic transition. We show that, at large detuning, the decay\nrate increases with the on-resonance optical depth. In contrast to forward\nscattering, the superradiant decay of off-axis fluorescence is suppressed near\nresonance due to attenuation and multiple-scattering effects.\n", "  Many physical properties of metals can be understood in terms of the free\nelectron model, as proven by the Wiedemann-Franz law. According to this model,\nelectronic thermal conductivity ($\\kappa_{el}$) can be inferred from the\nBoltzmann transport equation (BTE). However, the BTE does not perform well for\nsome complex metals, such as Cu. Moreover, the BTE cannot clearly describe the\norigin of the thermal energy carried by electrons or how this energy is\ntransported in metals. The charge distribution of conduction electrons in\nmetals is known to reflect the electrostatic potential (EP) of the ion cores.\nBased on this premise, we develop a new methodology for evaluating\n$\\kappa_{el}$ by combining the free electron model and non-equilibrium ab\ninitio molecular dynamics (NEAIMD) simulations. We demonstrate that the kinetic\nenergy of thermally excited electrons originates from the energy of the spatial\nelectrostatic potential oscillation (EPO), which is induced by the thermal\nmotion of ion cores. This method directly predicts the $\\kappa_{el}$ of pure\nmetals with a high degree of accuracy.\n", "  The derivation of the Glauber type representation for the high energy\nscattering amplitude of particles of spin 1/2 is given within the framework of\nthe Dirac equation in the Foldy Wouthuysen (FW) representation and\ntwo-component formalism. The differential cross sections on the Yukawa and\nGaussian potentials are also considered and discussed.\n", "  We present evidence from the RAdial Velocity Experiment (RAVE) survey of\nchemically separated, kinematically distinct disc components in the solar\nneighbourhood. We apply probabilistic chemical selection criteria to separate\nour sample into $\\alpha$-low (`thin disc') and $\\alpha$-high (`thick disc')\nsequences. Using newly derived distances, which will be utilized in the\nupcoming RAVE DR5, we explore the kinematic trends as a function of metallicity\nfor each of the disc components. For our $\\alpha$-low disc, we find a negative\ntrend in the mean rotational velocity ($V_{\\mathrm{\\phi}}$) as a function of\niron abundance ([Fe/H]). We measure a positive gradient $\\partial\nV_{\\mathrm{\\phi}}$/$\\partial$[Fe/H] for the $\\alpha$-high disc, consistent with\nresults from high-resolution surveys. We also find differences between the\n$\\alpha$-low and $\\alpha$-high discs in all three components of velocity\ndispersion. We discuss the implications of an $\\alpha$-low, metal-rich\npopulation originating from the inner Galaxy, where the orbits of these stars\nhave been significantly altered by radial mixing mechanisms in order to bring\nthem into the solar neighbourhood. The probabilistic separation we propose can\nbe extended to other data sets for which the accuracy in [$\\alpha$/Fe] is not\nsufficient to disentangle the chemical disc components a priori. For such\ndatasets which will also have significant overlap with Gaia DR1, we can\ntherefore make full use of the improved parallax and proper motion data as it\nbecomes available to investigate kinematic trends in these chemical disc\ncomponents.\n", "  Supermassive black hole -- host galaxy relations are key to the computation\nof the expected gravitational wave background (GWB) in the pulsar timing array\n(PTA) frequency band. It has been recently pointed out that standard relations\nadopted in GWB computations are in fact biased-high. We show that when this\nselection bias is taken into account, the expected GWB in the PTA band is a\nfactor of about three smaller than previously estimated. Compared to other\nscaling relations recently published in the literature, the median amplitude of\nthe signal at $f=1$yr$^{-1}$ drops from $1.3\\times10^{-15}$ to\n$4\\times10^{-16}$. Although this solves any potential tension between\ntheoretical predictions and recent PTA limits without invoking other dynamical\neffects (such as stalling, eccentricity or strong coupling with the galactic\nenvironment), it also makes the GWB detection more challenging.\n", "  We investigate the evolution of supermassive black holes in the `Evolution\nand Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments' (EAGLE) cosmological\nhydrodynamic simulations. The largest of the EAGLE volumes covers a $(100 \\,\\rm\ncMpc)^3$ and includes state-of-the-art physical models for star formation and\nblack hole growth that depend only on local gas properties. We focus on the\nblack hole mass function, Eddington ratio distribution and the implied duty\ncycle of nuclear activity. The simulation is broadly consistent with\nobservational constraints on these quantities. In order to make a more direct\ncomparison with observational data, we calculate the soft and hard X-ray\nluminosity functions of the active galactic nuclei (AGN). Between redshifts $0$\nand $1$, the simulation is in agreement with data. At higher redshifts, the\nsimulation tends to underpredict the luminosities of the brightest observed\nAGN. This may be due to the limited volume of the simulation, or a fundamental\ndeficiency of the underlying model. It seems unlikely that additional\nunresolved variability can account for this difference. The simulation shows a\nsimilar `downsizing' of the AGN population as seen in observational surveys.\n", "  We study a bilayer Kane-Mele-Hubbard model with lattice distortion and\ninter-layer spin exchange interaction under cylinder geometry. Our analysis\nbased on real-space dynamical mean field theory with continuous-time quantum\nMonte Carlo demonstrates the emergence of a topological edge Mott insulating\n(TEMI) state which hosts gapless edge modes only in collective spin\nexcitations. This is confirmed by the numerical calculations at finite\ntemperatures for the spin-Hall conductivity and the single-particle excitation\nspectrum; the spin Hall conductivity is almost quantized,\n$\\sigma^{xy}_\\mathrm{spin}\\sim2(e/2\\pi)$, predicting gapless edge modes\ncarrying the spin current, while the helical edge modes in the single-particle\nspectrum are gapped out with respecting symmetry. It is clarified how the TEMI\nstate evolves from the ordinary spin Hall insulating state with increasing the\nHubbard interaction at a given temperature and then undergoes a phase\ntransition to a trivial Mott insulating state. With a bosonization approach at\nzero temperature, we further address which collective modes host gapless edge\nmodes in the TEMI state.\n", "  Electronic devices based on graphene technology are catching on rapidly and\nthe ability to engineer graphene properties at the nanoscale is becoming, more\nthan ever, indispensable. Here, we present a new procedure of graphene\nfunctionalization on SiC(0001) that paves the way towards the fabrication of\ncomplex graphene electronic chips. The procedure resides on the well-known\nion-implantation technique. The efficiency of the working principle is\ndemonstrated by the intercalation of the epitaxial graphene layer on SiC(0001)\nwith Bi atoms, which was not possible following standard procedures. Our\nresults put forward the ion-beam lithography to nanostructure and functionalize\ndesired graphene chips.\n", "  Light scalar fields coupled to matter are a common consequence of theories of\ndark energy and attempts to solve the cosmological constant problem. The\nchameleon screening mechanism is commonly invoked in order to suppress the\nfifth forces mediated by these scalars, suficiently to avoid current\nexperimental constraints, without fine tuning. The force is suppressed\ndynamically by allowing the mass of the scalar to vary with the local density.\nRecently it has been shown that near future cold atoms experiments using\natom-interferometry have the ability to access a large proportion of the\nchameleon parameter space. In this work we demonstrate how experiments\nutilising asymmetric parallel plates can push deeper into the remaining\nparameter space available to the chameleon.\n", "  We study phase diagrams of one-dimensional bosons with contact interactions\nin the presence of a lattice. We use the worm algorithm in continuous space and\nfocus on the incommensurate superfluid Mott-insulator transition. Our results\nare compared to those from the one-band Bose-Hubbard model. When Wannier states\nare used to determine the Bose-Hubbard model parameters, the comparison unveils\nan apparent breakdown of the one-band description for strong interactions, even\nfor the Mott-insulating state with an average of one particle per site ($n=1$)\nin deep lattices. We introduce an inverse confined scattering analysis to\nobtain the ratio $U/J$, with which the Bose-Hubbard model provides correct\nresults for strong interactions, deep lattices, and $n=1$.\n", "  We show how robust statistical features of a many-particle quantum state's\ntwo-point correlations after transmission through a multi-mode random scatterer\ncan be used as a sensitive probe of the injected particles' mutual\nindistinguishability. This generalises Hong-Ou-Mandel interference as a\ndiagnostic tool for many-particle transmission signals across multi-mode random\nscatterers. Furthermore, we show how, from such statistical features of the\nmany-particle interference pattern, information can be deduced on the temporal\nstructure of the many-particle input state, by inspection of the many-particle\ninterference with an additional probe particle of tuneable distinguishability.\n", "  Motor protein motion on biopolymers can be described by models related to the\ntotally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP). Inspired by experiments on\nthe motion of kinesin-4 motors on antiparallel microtubule overlaps, we analyze\na model incorporating the TASEP on two antiparallel lanes with binding kinetics\nand lane switching. We determine the steady-state motor density profiles using\nphase plane analysis of the steady-state mean field equations and kinetic Monte\nCarlo simulations. We focus on the the density-density phase plane, where we\nfind an analytic solution to the mean-field model. By studying the phase space\nflows, we determine the model's fixed points and their changes with parameters.\nPhases previously identified for the single-lane model occur for low switching\nrate between lanes. We predict a new multiple coexistence phase due to\nadditional fixed points that appear as the switching rate increases: switching\nmoves motors from the higher-density to the lower-density lane, causing local\njamming and creating multiple domain walls. We determine the phase diagram of\nthe model for both symmetric and general boundary conditions.\n", "  The forward Compton scattering off the proton is determined by substituting\nthe empirical total photoabsorption cross sections into dispersive sum rules.\nIn addition to the spin-independent amplitude evaluated previously [Phys. Rev.\nD 92, 074031 (2015)], we obtain the spin-dependent amplitude over a broad\nenergy range. The two amplitudes contain all the information about this\nprocess, and we, hence, can reconstruct the nonvanishing observables of the\nproton Compton scattering in the forward kinematics. The results are compared\nwith predictions of chiral perturbation theory where available. The low-energy\nexpansion of the spin-dependent Compton scattering amplitude yields the\nGerasimov-Drell-Hearn (GDH) sum rule and relations for the forward spin\npolarizabilities (FSPs) of the proton. Our evaluation provides an empirical\nverification of the GDH sum rule for the proton, and yields empirical values of\nthe proton FSPs. For the GDH integral, we obtain $204.5(21.4)$ $\\mu$b, in\nagreement with the sum rule prediction: $204.784481(4)$ $\\mu$b. For the FSPs,\nwe obtain: $\\gamma_0=-92.9(10.5) \\times 10^{-6}$ fm$^4$, and\n$\\bar{\\gamma_0}=48.4(8.2) \\times 10^{-6}$ fm$^6$, improving on the accuracy of\nprevious evaluations.\n", "  The zero-temperature, classical $XY$-model on an $L \\times L$ square-lattice\nis studied by exploring the distribution $\\Phi_L(y)$ of its centered and\nnormalized magnetization $y$ in the large $L$ limit. An integral representation\nof the cumulant generating function, known from earlier works, is used for the\nnumerical evaluation of $\\Phi_L(y)$, and the limit distribution $\\Phi_{L\n\\rightarrow \\infty} (y) = \\Phi_0(y)$ is obtained with high precision. The two\nleading finite-size corrections $\\Phi_L (y) -\\Phi_0 (y) \\approx a_1(L)\\,\n\\Phi_1(y) + a_2(L)\\,\\Phi_2(y)$ are also extracted both from numerics and from\nanalytic calculations. We find that the amplitude $a_1(L)$ scales as\n$\\ln(L/L_0) /L^2$ and the shape correction function $\\Phi_1 (y)$ can be\nexpressed through the low-order derivatives of the limit distribution, $\\Phi_1\n(y) = [\\,y\\, \\Phi_0 (y) + \\Phi'_0 (y)\\,]'$. The second finite-size correction\nhas an amplitude $a_2(L)\\propto 1/L^2$ and one finds that $a_2\\,\\Phi_2(y) \\ll\na_1 \\,\\Phi_1(y)$ already for small system size ($L> 10$). We illustrate the\nfeasibility of observing the calculated finite-size corrections by performing\nsimulations of the $XY$-model at low temperatures, including $T = 0$.\n", "  We investigate different geometries of spin-1/2 nitrogen impurity channels\nfor distributing entanglement between pairs of remote nitrogen vacancy centers\n(NVs) in diamond. To go beyond the system size limits imposed by directly\nsolving the master equation, we implement a matrix product operator method to\ndescribe the open system dynamics. In so doing, we provide an early\ndemonstration of how this technique can be used for simulating real systems.\nFor a fixed NV separation there is an interplay between incoherent impurity\nspin decay and coherent entanglement transfer: Long transfer time, few-spin\nsystems experience strong dephasing that can be overcome by increasing the\nnumber of spins in the channel. We examine how missing spins and disorder in\nthe coupling strengths affect the dynamics, finding that in some regimes a spin\nladder is a more effective conduit for information than a single spin chain.\n", "  We present the MUFASA suite of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, which\nemploys the GIZMO meshless finite mass (MFM) code including H2-based star\nformation, nine-element chemical evolution, two-phase kinetic outflows\nfollowing scalings from the Feedback in Realistic Environments zoom\nsimulations, and evolving halo mass-based quenching. Our fiducial (50 Mpc/h)^3\nvolume is evolved to z=0 with a quarter billion particles, The predicted galaxy\nstellar mass functions (GSMF) reproduce observations from z=4-0 to <1.2sigma in\ncosmic variance, providing an unprecedented match to this key diagnostic. The\ncosmic star formation history and stellar mass growth show general agreement\nwith data, with a strong archaeological downsizing trend such that dwarf\ngalaxies form the majority of their stars after z~1. We run 25 Mpc/h and 12.5\nMpc/h volumes to z=2 with identical feedback prescriptions, the latter\nresolving all hydrogen-cooling halos, and the three runs display fair\nresolution convergence. The specific star formation rates broadly agree with\ndata at z=0, but are underpredicted at z~2 by a factor of three, re-emphasizing\na longstanding puzzle in galaxy evolution models. We compare runs using MFM and\ntwo flavours of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics, and show that the GSMF is\nsensitive to hydrodynamics methodology at the ~x2 level, which is sub-dominant\nto choices for parameterising feedback.\n", "  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely applied in the computer\nvision community to solve complex problems in image recognition and analysis.\nWe describe an application of the CNN technology to the problem of identifying\nparticle interactions in sampling calorimeters used commonly in high energy\nphysics and high energy neutrino physics in particular. Following a discussion\nof the core concepts of CNNs and recent innovations in CNN architectures\nrelated to the field of deep learning, we outline a specific application to the\nNOvA neutrino detector. This algorithm, CVN (Convolutional Visual Network)\nidentifies neutrino interactions based on their topology without the need for\ndetailed reconstruction and outperforms algorithms currently in use by the NOvA\ncollaboration.\n", "  The extended electroweak $\\mathrm{SU(3)_c \\otimes SU(3)_L \\otimes U(1)_X}$\nsymmetry framework \"explaining\" the number of fermion families is revisited.\nWhile $331$-based schemes can not easily be unified within the conventional\nfield theory sense, we show how to do it within an approach based on D-branes\nand (un)oriented open strings, on Calabi-Yau singularities. We show how the\ntheory can be UV-completed in a quiver setup, free of gauge and string\nanomalies. Lepton and baryon numbers are perturbatively conserved, so neutrinos\nare Dirac-type, and their lightness results from a novel TeV scale seesaw\nmechanism. Dynamical violation of baryon number by exotic instantons could\ninduce neutron-antineutron oscillations, with proton decay and other dangerous\nR-parity violating processes strictly forbidden.\n", "  We investigate the properties of $\\sim7000$ narrow-band selected galaxies\nwith strong H$\\beta+$[OIII] and [OII] nebular emission lines from the High-$z$\nEmission Line Survey (HiZELS) between $z \\sim 0.8 - 5.0$. Our sample covers a\nwide range in stellar mass ($M\\sim10^{7.5 - 12.0}$ M$_\\odot$), rest-frame\nequivalent widths (EW$_\\mathrm{rest}\\sim 10 - 10^5$ \\AA), and line luminosities\n($L\\sim10^{40.5 - 43.2}$ erg s$^{-1}$). We measure the H$\\beta+$[OIII] and\n[OII]-selected stellar mass functions out to $z \\sim 3.5$ and find that both\n$M_\\star$ and $\\phi_\\star$ increases with cosmic time, which may be due to the\n[OIII] selection including an increasing fraction of AGN at lower redshifts.\nThe [OII]-selected stellar mass functions show a constant\n$M_\\star\\sim10^{11.6}$ M$_\\odot$ and a strong, increasing evolution with cosmic\ntime in $\\phi_\\star$ in line with H$\\alpha$ studies. We also investigate the\nEW$_\\mathrm{rest}$ evolution as a function of redshift with a fixed mass range\n(10$^{9.5 - 10.0}$ M$_\\odot$) and find an increasing trend best represented by\n$(1+z)^{3.81\\pm0.14}$ and $(1+z)^{2.72\\pm0.19}$ up to $z\\sim 2$ and $\\sim 3$\nfor H$\\beta$+[OIII] and [OII] emitters, respectively. This is the first time\nthat the EW evolution has been directly measured for H$\\beta+$[OIII] and [OII]\nemitters up to these redshifts. There is evidence for a slower evolution for $z\n> 2$ in the H$\\beta+$[OIII] EW and a decreasing trend for $z > 3$ in the [OII]\nEW evolution, which would imply low [OII] EW at the highest redshifts and\nhigher [OIII]/[OII] line ratios. This suggests that the ionization parameter at\nhigher redshift may be significantly higher than the local Universe. Our\nresults set the stage for future near-IR space-based spectroscopic surveys to\ntest our extrapolated predictions and also produce $z > 5$ measurements to\nconstrain the high-$z$ end of the EW$_\\mathrm{rest}$ and [OIII]/[OII]\nevolution.\n", "  The separate quark flavour contributions to the pion and kaon valence quark\ndistribution functions are studied, along with the corresponding\nelectromagnetic form factors in the space-like region. The calculations are\nmade using the solution of the Bethe-Salpeter equation for the model of Nambu\nand Jona-Lasinio with proper-time regularization. Both the pion and kaon form\nfactors and the valence quark distribution functions reproduce many of the\nfeatures of the available empirical data. The larger mass if the strange quark\nnaturally explains the empirical fact that the ratio $u_{K^+}(x)/u_{\\pi^+}(x)$\ndrops below unity at large $x$, with a value of approximately $M^2_u/M_s^2$ as\n$x \\to 1$. With regard to the elastic form factors we report a large flavour\ndependence, with the $u$-quark contribution to the kaon form factor being an\norder of magnitude smaller than that of the $s$-quark at large $Q^2$, which may\nbe a sensitive measure of confinement effects in QCD. Surprisingly though, the\ntotal $K^+$ and $\\pi^+$ form factors differ by only 10\\%.\n", "  We formulate the next-to-leading order nuclear effective field theory without\npions in the two-nucleon sector on a spatial lattice, and investigate\nnonperturbative renormalization group flows in the strong coupling region by\ndiagonalizing the Hamiltonian numerically. The cutoff (proportional to the\ninverse of the lattice constant) dependence of the coupling constants is\nobtained by changing the lattice constant with the binding energy and the\nasymptotic normalization constant for the groundstate being fixed. We argue\nthat the critical line can be obtained by looking at the finite-size dependence\nof the groundstate energy. We determine the relevant operator and locate the\nnontrivial fixed point, as well as the physical flow line corresponding to the\ndeuteron in the two-dimensional plane of dimensionless coupling constants. It\nturns out that the location of the nontrivial fixed point is very close to the\none obtained by the corresponding analytic calculation, but the relevant\noperator is quite different.\n", "  The Boltzmann-Gibbs density, a central result of equilibrium statistical\nmechanics, relates the energy of a system in contact with a thermal bath to its\nequilibrium statistics. This relation is lost for non-thermal systems such as\ncold atoms in optical lattices, where the heat bath is replaced by the laser\nbeams of the lattice. We investigate in detail the stationary phase-space\nprobability for Sisyphus cooling under harmonic confinement. In particular, we\nelucidate whether the total energy of the system still describes its stationary\nstate statistics. We find that this is true for the center part of the\nphase-space density for deep lattices, where the Boltzmann-Gibbs density\nprovides an approximate description. The relation between energy and statistics\nalso persists for strong confinement and in the limit of high energies, where\nthe system becomes underdamped. However, the phase-space density now exhibits\nheavy power-law tails. In all three cases we find expressions for the leading\norder phase-space density and corrections which break the equivalence of\nprobability and energy and violate energy equipartition. The non-equilibrium\nnature of the steady state is confounded by explicit violations of detailed\nbalance. We complement these analytical results with numerical simulations to\nmap out the intricate structure of the phase-space density.\n", "  We report on the measurement of electron emission after the interaction of\nstrong laser pulses with atoms and molecules. These electrons originate from\nhigh-lying Rydberg states with quantum numbers up to $n \\lesssim 120$ formed by\nfrustrated field ionization. Simulations show that both tunneling ionization by\na weak dc field and photoionization by the black-body radiation contribute to\ndelayed electron emission on the nano- to microsecond scale. We measured\nionization rates from these Rydberg states by coincidence spectroscopy.\nFurther, the dependence of the Rydberg-state production on the ellipticity of\nthe driving laser field proves that such high-lying Rydberg states are\npopulated through electron recapture. The present experiment provides detailed\nquantitative information on Rydberg production by frustrated field ionization.\n", "  In gauge/gravity duality, points which are not causally related on the\nboundary cannot be causally related through the bulk; this is the statement of\nboundary causality. By the Gao-Wald theorem, the averaged null energy condition\nin the bulk is sufficient to ensure this property. Here we proceed in the\nconverse direction: we derive a necessary as well as sufficient condition for\nthe preservation of boundary causality under perturbative (quantum or stringy)\ncorrections to the bulk. The condition that we find is a (background-dependent)\nconstraint on the amount by which light cones can \"open\" over all null bulk\ngeodesics. We show that this constraint is weaker than the averaged null energy\ncondition.\n", "  Bistability in magnetism has been extensively used, in particular to store\ninformation. Here we propose an alternative route by using tetrastable magnetic\ndomains. Using numerical and analytical calculations we show that a spin chain\nwith a canting angle of {\\pi}/4 possesses four energy-equivalent states. We\ndiscuss the static properties of such chain such as the profile and the energy\nof the domain walls as they govern the relaxation of the magnetization. The\nrealisation of such spin chain could enable the encoding of the information on\nfour bits which is a potential alternative toward the increase of storage\ndensity.\n", "  We present the results of a search for unknown interactions that couple to\nmass between an optically levitated microsphere and a gold-coated silicon\ncantilever. The scale and geometry of the apparatus enables a search for new\nforces that appear at distances below 100 $\\mu$m and which would have evaded\nprevious searches due to screening mechanisms. The data are consistent with\nelectrostatic backgrounds and place upper limits on the strength of new\ninteractions at $<0.1$ fN in the geometry tested. For the specific example of a\nchameleon interaction with an inverse power law potential, these results\nexclude matter couplings $\\beta > 5.6 \\times 10^4$ in the region of parameter\nspace where the self-coupling $\\Lambda \\gtrsim 5$ meV and the microspheres are\nnot fully screened.\n", "  We report the results from our detailed analysis of the Fermi Large Area\nTelescope (LAT) data for the pulsar binary PSR B1259-63/LS 2883. During the GeV\nflares that occurred when the pulsar was in the periastron passages, we have\ndetected a 5--300 GeV component at $\\simeq 5\\sigma$ in emission from the\nbinary. The detection verifies the presence of the component that has been\nmarginally found in the previous studies of the binary. Furthermore, we have\ndiscovered that this component was present even in the quiescent state of the\nbinary, specifically the mean anomaly phase 0.7--0.9. The component can be\ndescribed by a power law with photon index $\\Gamma\\sim 1.4$, and the flux in\nthe flares is approximately one order of magnitude higher than that in\nquiescence. We discuss the origin of this component. It likely arises from the\ninverse-Compton process: high-energy particles from the shock, due to the\ninteraction between the winds from the pulsar and massive companion, scatter\nthe seed photons from the companion to GeV/TeV energies. Based on this\nscenario, model fits to the broad-band X-ray--to--TeV spectra of the binary in\nthe flaring and quiescent states are provided.\n", "  Multiplex networks describe a large variety of complex systems including\ninfrastructures, transportation networks and biological systems. Most of these\nnetworks feature a significant link overlap. It is therefore of particular\nimportance to characterize the mutually connected giant component in these\nnetworks. Here we provide a message passing theory for characterizing the\npercolation transition in multiplex networks with link overlap and an arbitrary\nnumber of layers $M$. Specifically we propose and compare two message passing\nalgorithms, that generalize the algorithm widely used to study the percolation\ntransition in multiplex networks without link overlap. The first algorithm\ndescribes a directed percolation transition and admits an epidemic spreading\ninterpretation. The second algorithm describes the emergence of the mutually\nconnected giant component, that is the percolation transition, but does not\npreserve the epidemic spreading interpretation. We obtain the phase diagrams\nfor the percolation and directed percolation transition in simple\nrepresentative cases. We demonstrate that for the same multiplex network\nstructure, in which the directed percolation transition has non-trivial\ntricritical points, the percolation transition has a discontinuous phase\ntransition, with the exception of the trivial case in which all the layers\ncompletely overlap.\n", "  Motivated by the fact that many bilayer quantum magnets occur in nature, we\ngeneralize the study of thermal Hall transports of spin excitations to bilayer\nmagnetic systems. It is shown that bilayer magnetic systems can be coupled\neither ferromagnetically or antiferromagnetically. We study both scenarios on\nthe honeycomb lattice and show that the system realizes topologically\nnontrivial magnon bands induced by alternating next-nearest-neighbour\nDzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction (DMI). As a result, the bilayer system\nrealizes both magnon Hall effect and magnon spin Nernst effect. We show that\nantiferromagnetically coupled layers differ from ferromagnetically coupled\nlayers by a sign change in the conductivities as the magnetic field is\nreversed. Furthermore, Chern number protected magnon edge states are observed\nand propagate in the same direction on the top and bottom layers in\nferromagnetically coupled layers, whereas the magnon edge states propagate in\nopposite directions for antiferromagnetically coupled layers.\n", "  In light of the recent 750 GeV diphoton excesses reported by the ATLAS and\nCMS collaborations, we investigate the possibility of explaining this excess\nusing the Minimal Dilaton Model. We find that this model is able to explain the\nobserved excess with the presence of additional top partner(s), with same\ncharge as the top quark, but with mass in the TeV region. First, we constrain\nmodel parameters using in addition to the 750 GeV diphoton signal strength,\nprecision electroweak tests, single top production measurements, as well as\nHiggs signal strength data collected in the earlier runs of the LHC. In\naddition we discuss interesting phenomenolgy that could arise in this model,\nrelevant for future runs of the LHC.\n", "  We review black hole and star solutions for Horndeski theory. For non-shift\nsymmetric theories, black holes involve a Kaluza-Klein reduction of higher\ndimensional Lovelock solutions. On the other hand, for shift symmetric theories\nof Horndeski and beyond Horndeski, black holes involve two classes of\nsolutions: those that include, at the level of the action, a linear coupling to\nthe Gauss-Bonnet term and those that involve time dependence in the galileon\nfield. We analyze the latter class in detail for a specific subclass of\nHorndeski theory, discussing the general solution of a static and spherically\nsymmetric spacetime. We then discuss stability issues, slowly rotating\nsolutions as well as black holes coupled to matter. The latter case involves a\nconformally coupled scalar field as well as an electromagnetic field and the\n(primary) hair black holes thus obtained. We review and discuss the recent\nresults on neutron stars in Horndeski theories.\n", "  How the Milky Way has accumulated its mass over the Hubble time, whether\nsignificant amounts of gas and stars were accreted from satellite galaxies, or\nwhether the Milky Way has experienced an initial gas assembly and then evolved\nmore-or-less in isolation is one of the burning questions in modern astronomy,\nbecause it has consequences for our understanding of galaxy formation in the\ncosmological context. Here we present the evolutionary model of a Milky\nWay-type satellite system zoomed into a cosmological large-scale simulation.\nEmbedded into Dark Matter halos and allowing for baryonic processes these\nchemo-dynamical simulations aim at studying the gas and stellar loss from the\nsatellites to feed the Milky Way halo and the stellar chemical abundances in\nthe halo and the satellite galaxies.\n", "  We report the discovery of a remarkable concentration of massive galaxies\nwith extended X-ray emission at $z_{spec} = 2.506$, which contains 11 massive\n($M_{*} \\gtrsim 10^{11} M_{\\odot}$) galaxies in the central 80kpc region\n(11.6$\\sigma$ overdensity). We have spectroscopically confirmed 17 member\ngalaxies with 11 from CO and the remaining ones from $H\\alpha$. The X-ray\nluminosity, stellar mass content and velocity dispersion all point to a\ncollapsed, cluster-sized dark matter halo with mass $M_{200c} = 10^{13.9\\pm0.2}\nM_{\\odot}$, making it the most distant X-ray-detected cluster known to date.\nUnlike other clusters discovered so far, this structure is dominated by\nstar-forming galaxies (SFGs) in the core with only 2 out of the 11 massive\ngalaxies classified as quiescent. The star formation rate (SFR) in the 80kpc\ncore reaches $\\sim$3400 $M_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ with a gas depletion time of\n$\\sim 200$ Myr, suggesting that we caught this cluster in rapid build-up of a\ndense core. The high SFR is driven by both a high abundance of SFGs and a\nhigher starburst fraction ($\\sim25\\%$, compared to 3\\%-5\\% in the field). The\npresence of both a collapsed, cluster-sized halo and a predominant population\nof massive SFGs suggests that this structure could represent an important\ntransition phase between protoclusters and mature clusters. It provides\nevidence that the main phase of massive galaxy passivization will take place\nafter galaxies accrete onto the cluster, providing new insights into massive\ncluster formation at early epochs. The large integrated stellar mass at such\nhigh redshift challenges our understanding of massive cluster formation.\n", "  A method for 3D interpolation between hard spheres is described. The function\nto be interpolated could be the charge density between atoms in condensed\nmatter. Its electrostatic potential is found analytically, and so are various\nintegrals. Periodicity is not required. The interpolation functions are\nlocalized structure-adapted linear combinations of spherical waves, socalled\nunitary spherical waves (USWs), centered at the spheres where they have\ncubic-harmonic character. Input to the interpolation are the coefficients in\nthe cubic-harmonic expansion of the target function at and slightly outside the\nspheres; specifically, the values and 3 first radial derivatives. To fit this,\nwe use USWs with 4 negative energies. Each interpolation function is actually a\nlinear combination of these 4 sets of USWs with the following properties: (1)\nIt is centered at a specific sphere where it has a specific cubic-harmonic\ncharacter and radial derivative. (2) Its value and first 3 radial derivatives\nvanish at all other spheres and for all other cubic-harmonics. It is therefore\nhighly localized. Explicit expressions are given for these value-and-derivative\n(v&d) functions and their Coulomb potentials in terms of the USWs and their\nstructure matrix, including those with zero energy, as well as for integrals\nover the interstitial of the v&d functions and of their products. Use of point-\nand space-group symmetries can significantly reduce matrix sizes and the number\nof v&d functions. For open structures, additional constraints are needed to\npinpoint the interpolated function deep in the interstitial. This requires the\nUSW set at one extra energy. As examples, we consider a constant density and\nthe valence-electron densities in zinc-blende structured Si, ZnSe, and CuBr.\n", "  We report on the presence of large amounts of million-degree gas in the Milky\nWay's interstellar and circum-galactic medium. This gas (1) permeates both the\nGalactic plane and the halo, (2) extends to distances larger than 60-200 kpc\nfrom the center, and (3) its mass is sufficient to close the Galaxy's baryon\ncensus.\n  Moreover, we show that a vast, $\\sim 6$ kpc radius, spherically-symmetric\ncentral region of the Milky Way above and below the 0.16 kpc thick plane, has\neither been emptied of hot gas or the density of this gas within the cavity has\na peculiar profile, increasing from the center up to a radius of $\\sim 6$ kpc,\nand then decreasing with a typical halo density profile. This, and several\nother converging pieces of evidence, suggest that the current surface of the\ncavity, at 6 kpc from the Galaxy's center, traces the distant echo of a period\nof strong nuclear activity of our super-massive black-hole, occurred about 6\nMyrs ago.\n", "  The $k$-NN hard core lattice gas model on a square lattice, in which the\nfirst $k$ next nearest neighbor sites of a particle are excluded from being\noccupied by another particle, is the lattice version of the hard disc model in\ntwo dimensional continuum. It has been conjectured that the lattice model, like\nits continuum counterpart, will show multiple entropy-driven transitions with\nincreasing density if the high density phase has columnar or striped order.\nHere, we determine the nature of the phase at full packing for $k$ up to\n$820302$. We show that there are only eighteen values of $k$, all less than\n$k=4134$, that show columnar order, while the others show solid-like sublattice\norder.\n", "  The global properties of the final states produced in hadronic interactions\nof protons at centre-of-mass energies of future hadron colliders (such as\nFCC-hh at CERN, and SppC in China), are studied. The predictions of various\nMonte Carlo (MC) event generators used in collider physics (PYTHIA 6, PYTHIA 8,\nand PHOJET) and in ultrahigh-energy cosmic-rays studies (EPOS, and QGSJET) are\ncompared. Despite their different underlying modeling of hadronic interactions,\ntheir predictions for proton-proton (p-p) collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 100 TeV\nare quite similar. The average of all MC predictions (except PHOJET) for the\ndifferent observables are: (i) p-p inelastic cross sections $\\sigma_{\\rm inel}$\n= 105 $\\pm$ 2 mb; (ii) total charged multiplicity $\\rm N_{_{\\rm ch}}$ = 150\n$\\pm$ 20; (iii) charged particle pseudorapidity density at midrapidity $\\rm\ndN_{ch}/d\\eta|_{\\eta=0} = 9.6 \\pm 0.2$; (iv) energy density at midrapidity $\\rm\ndE/d\\eta|_{\\eta=0} = 13.6 \\pm 1.5$ GeV, and $\\rm dE/d\\eta|_{\\eta=5} = 670 \\pm\n70$ GeV at the edge of the central region; and (v) average transverse momenta\nat midrapidities $\\rm < p_{T}> = 0.76 \\pm 0.07$ GeV/c. At midrapidity, EPOS and\nQGSJET-II predict larger per-event multiplicity probabilities at very low ($\\rm\nN_{\\rm ch}<3$) and very high ($\\rm N_{\\rm ch}>100$) particle multiplicities,\nwhereas PYTHIA 6 and 8 feature higher yields in the intermediate region $\\rm\nN_{\\rm ch}\\approx$ 30--80. These results provide useful information for the\nestimation of the detector occupancies and energy deposits from pileup\ncollisions at the expected large FCC-hh/SppC luminosities.\n", "  Massive black-hole binaries (MBHBs) are thought to be the main source of\ngravitational waves (GWs) in the low-frequency domain surveyed by ongoing and\nforthcoming Pulsar Timing Array campaigns and future space-borne missions, such\nas {\\it eLISA}. However, many low-redshift MBHBs in realistic astrophysical\nenvironments may not reach separations small enough to allow significant GW\nemission, but rather stall on (sub)pc-scale orbits. This \"last-parsec problem\"\ncan be eased by the appearance of a third massive black hole (MBH) -- the\n\"intruder\" -- whose action can force, under certain conditions, the inner MBHB\non a very eccentric orbit, hence allowing intense GW emission eventually\nleading to coalescence. A detailed assessment of the process, ultimately driven\nby the induced Kozai-Lidov oscillations of the MBHB orbit, requires a general\nrelativistic treatment and the inclusion of external factors, such as the\nNewtonian precession of the intruder orbit in the galactic potential and its\nhardening by scattering off background stars. In order to tackle this problem,\nwe developed a three-body Post-Newtonian (PN) code framed in a realistic\ngalactic potential, including both non-dissipative 1PN and 2PN terms, and\ndissipative terms such as 2.5PN effects, orbital hardening of the outer binary,\nand the effect of the dynamical friction on the early stages of the intruder\ndynamics. In this first paper of a series devoted at studing the dynamics of\nMBH triplets from a cosmological perspective, we describe, test and validate\nour code.\n", "  This article describes the implementation of a focal plane based wavefront\ncontrol loop on the high-contrast imaging instrument SCExAO (Subaru\nCoronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics). The sensor relies on the Fourier\nanalysis of conventional focal-plane images acquired after an asymmetric mask\nis introduced in the pupil of the instrument. This absolute sensor is used here\nin a closed-loop to compensate the non-common path errors that normally affects\nany imaging system relying on an upstream adaptive optics system.This specific\nimplementation was used to control low order modes corresponding to eight\nzernike modes (from focus to spherical). This loop was successfully run on-sky\nat the Subaru Telescope and is used to offset the SCExAO deformable mirror\nshape used as a zero-point by the high-order wavefront sensor. The paper\nprecises the range of errors this wavefront sensing approach can operate within\nand explores the impact of saturation of the data and how it can be bypassed,\nat a cost in performance. Beyond this application, because of its low hardware\nimpact, APF-WFS can easily be ported in a wide variety of wavefront sensing\ncontexts, for ground- as well space-borne telescopes, and for telescope pupils\nthat can be continuous, segmented or even sparse. The technique is powerful\nbecause it measures the wavefront where it really matters, at the level of the\nscience detector.\n", "  Cumulative number density matching of galaxies is a method to observationally\nconnect descendent galaxies to their typical main progenitors at higher\nredshifts and thereby to assess the evolution of galaxy properties. The\naccuracy of this method is limited due to galaxy merging and scatter in the\nstellar mass growth history of individual galaxies. Behroozi et al. (2013) have\nintroduced a refinement of the method, based on abundance matching of observed\ngalaxies to the Bolshoi dark-matter-only simulation. The EAGLE cosmological\nhydro-simulation is well suited to test this method, because it reproduces the\nobserved evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function and the passive\nfraction. We find agreement with the Behroozi et al. (2013) method for the\ncomplete sample of main progenitors of z = 0 galaxies, but we also find a\nstrong dependence on the current star formation rate. Passive galaxies with a\nstellar mass up to 10^10.75 Msun have a completely different median mass\nhistory than active galaxies of the same mass. This difference persists if we\nonly select central galaxies. This means that the cumulative number density\nmethod should be applied separately to active and passive galaxies. Even then,\nthe typical main progenitor of a z = 0 galaxy already spans two orders of\nmagnitude in stellar mass at z = 2.\n", "  Based on the result of classification in our previous work, we exhaustively\ninvestigate Yukawa sector of $U(8)$ model on magnetized orbifolds\n$T^{2}/Z_{2}$, $T^{2}/Z_{3}$, $T^{2}/Z_{4}$ and $T^{2}/Z_{6}$ by evaluating\nratios of the mass eigenvalues of the three states in all the possible\nconfigurations with one and two Higgs pairs where three generations are\nrealized in fermions. Because of smearing effect via kinetic mixing, one can\nrealize a hierarchy such as $10^{-2}$-$10^{-3}$, but it is very difficult to\nachieve the mass ratio between the up and top quarks\n($m_{\\text{up}}/m_{\\text{top}} \\sim 10^{-5}$) on the complicated magnetized\norbifolds $T^{2}/Z_{N}\\,(N=3,4,6)$.\n", "  In this paper, we study $(2+1)$-dimensional quantum anomalous Hall states,\ni.e. band insulators with quantized Hall conductance, using the exact\nholographic mapping. The exact holographic mapping is an approach to\nholographic duality which maps the quantum anomalous Hall state to a different\nstate living in $(3+1)$-dimensional hyperbolic space. By studying topological\nresponse properties and the entanglement spectrum, we demonstrate that the\nholographic dual theory of a quantum anomalous Hall state is a\n$(3+1)$-dimensional topological insulator. The dual description enables a new\ncharacterization of topological properties of a system by the quantum\nentanglement between degrees of freedom at different length scales.\n", "  We investigate spin-incoherent Luttinger liquid of a one-dimensional spin-1\nBose gas in a harmonic trap. In this regime highly degenerate spin\nconfigurations emerge since the spin exchange energy is much less than the\nthermal energy of the system, while the temperature is low enough that the\nlowest energetic orbitals are occupied. As an example we numerically study the\nmomentum distribution of a one-dimensional spin-1 Bose gas in Tonks- Girardeau\ngas limit and in the sector of zero magnetization.We find that the momentum\ndistributions broaden as the number of atoms increase due to the averaging of\nspin function overlaps. Large momentum ($p$) asymptotic is analytically\nderived, showing the universal $1/p^4$ dependence. We demonstrate that the\nspin-incoherent Luttinger liquid has a momentum distribution also distinct from\nspinless bosons at finite temperature.\n", "  We develop a first-principles procedure for the individual evaluation of the\nintrinsic, side-jump, and skew-scattering contributions to the anomalous Hall\nconductivity $\\sigma_{xy}$. This method is based on the different microscopic\nconductive processes of each origin of $\\sigma_{xy}$ in the Kubo--Bastin\nformula. We also present an approach for implementing this scheme in the\ntight-binding linear muffin-tin orbital (TB-LMTO) method with the coherent\npotential approximation (CPA). The validity of this calculation method is\ndemonstrated for disordered FePt and FePd alloys. We find that the estimated\nvalue of each origin of $\\sigma_{xy}$ exhibits reasonable dependencies on the\nelectron scattering in these disordered alloys.\n", "  We study the frequency dependencies in the renormalization of the fermion\nGreens function for the $\\pi$-band electrons in graphene and their influence on\nthe dynamical gap generation at sufficiently strong interaction. Adopting the\neffective QED-like description for the low-energy excitations within the\nDirac-cone region we self consistently solve the fermion Dyson-Schwinger\nequation in various approximations for the photon propagator and the vertex\nfunction with special emphasis on frequency dependent Lindhard screening and\nretardation effects.\n", "  We discuss the effect of a strong magnetic field on the chemical freezeout\npoints in the ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collision. As a result of the inverse\nmagnetic catalysis or the magnetic inhibition, the crossover onset to hot and\ndense matter out of quarks and gluons should be shifted to a lower temperature.\nTo quantify this shift we employ the hadron resonance gas model and an\nempirical condition for the chemical freezeout. We point out that the charged\nparticle abundances are significantly affected by the magnetic field so that\nthe electric charge fluctuation is largely enhanced especially at high baryon\ndensity. The charge conservation partially cancels the enhancement but our\ncalculation shows that the electric charge fluctuation and the charge chemical\npotential could serve as a magnetometer. We find that the fluctuation exhibits\na crossover behavior rapidly increased for eB >~ (0.4GeV)^2, while the charge\nchemical potential has better sensitivity to the magnetic field.\n", "  It is well known that the probability distribution function (PDF) of galaxy\ndensity contrast is approximately lognormal; whether the PDF of mass\nfluctuations derived from weak lensing convergence (kappa_WL) is lognormal is\nless well established. We derive PDFs of the galaxy and projected matter\ndensity distributions via the Counts in Cells (CiC) method. We use maps of\ngalaxies and weak lensing convergence produced from the Dark Energy Survey\n(DES) Science Verification data over 139 deg^2. We test whether the underlying\ndensity contrast is well described by a lognormal distribution for the\ngalaxies, the convergence and their joint PDF. We confirm that the galaxy\ndensity contrast distribution is well modeled by a lognormal PDF convolved with\nPoisson noise at angular scales from 10-40 arcmin (corresponding to physical\nscales of 3-10 Mpc). We note that as kappa_WL is a weighted sum of the mass\nfluctuations along the line of sight, its PDF is expected to be only\napproximately lognormal. We find that the kappa_WL distribution is well modeled\nby a lognormal PDF convolved with Gaussian shape noise at scales between 10 and\n20 arcmin, with a best-fit chi^2/DOF of 1.11 compared to 1.84 for a Gaussian\nmodel, corresponding to p-values 0.35 and 0.07 respectively, at a scale of 10\narcmin. Above 20 arcmin a simple Gaussian model is sufficient. The joint PDF is\nalso reasonably fitted by a bivariate lognormal. As a consistency check we\ncompare the variances derived from the lognormal modelling with those directly\nmeasured via CiC. Our methods are validated against maps from the MICE Grand\nChallenge N-body simulation.\n", "  We generalize the spin Meissner effect for exciton-polariton condensate\nconfined in annular geometries to the case of non-trivial topology of the\ncondensate wavefunction. In contrast to the conventional spin Meissner state,\ntopological spin Meissner states can in principle be observed at arbitrary high\nmagnetic field not limited by the critical magnetic field value for the\ncondensate in a simply-connected geometry. One special example of the\ntopological Meissner states are half-vortices. We show that in the absence of\nmagnetic field half-vortices in a ring exist in a form of superposition of\nelementary half-vortex states which resolves recent experimental results where\nsuch puzzling superposition was observed. Furthermore, we show that if a pure\nhalf-vortex state is to be observed, a non-zero magnetic field of a specific\nmagnitude needs to be applied. Studying exciton-polariton in a ring in presence\nof TE-TM splitting, we observe spin Meissner states which break rotational\nsymmetry of the system by developing inhomogeneous density distributions. We\nclassify various states arising in presence of non-zero TE-TM splitting based\non what states they can be continued from by increasing the TE-TM splitting\nparameter from zero. With further increasing TE-TM splitting, states with\nbroken symmetry may transform into stable half-dark solitons and therefore may\nserve as a useful tool to generate various non-trivial states of a spinor\ncondensate.\n", "  The goodness-of-fit (GoF) of the Cosmicflows-2 (CF2) database of peculiar\nvelocities with the LCDM standard model of cosmology is presented. Standard\napplication of the Chi^2 statistics of the full database, of its 4,838 data\npoints, is hampered by the small scale nonlinear dynamics which is not\naccounted for by the (linear regime) velocity power spectrum. The bulk velocity\nconstitutes a highly compressed representation of the data which filters out\nthe small scales non-linear modes. Hence the statistics of the bulk flow\nprovides an efficient tool for assessing the GoF of the data given a model. The\nparticular approach introduced here is to use the (spherical top-hat window)\nbulk velocity extracted from the Wiener filter reconstruction of the 3D\nvelocity field as a linear low pass filtered highly compressed representation\nof the CF2 data. An ensemble 2250 random linear realizations of the WMAP/LCDM\nmodel has been used to calculate the bulk velocity auto-covariance matrix. We\nfind that the CF2 data is consistent with the WMAP/LCDM model to better than\nthe 2 sigma confidence limits. This provides a further validation that the CF2\ndatabase is consistent with the standard model of cosmology.\n", "  We show that a fast wind that expands into a bipolar nebula composed of two\nopposite jet-inflated bubbles can form a pair of bipolar rings around giant\nstars. Our model assumes three mass loss episodes: a spherical slow and dense\nshell, two opposite jets, and a spherical fast wind. We use the FLASH\nhydrodynamical code in three-dimensions to simulate the flow, and obtain the\nstructure of the nebula. We assume that the jets are launched from an accretion\ndisk around a stellar companion to the giant star. The accretion disk is\nassumed to be formed when the primary giant star and the secondary star suffer\na strong interaction accompanied by a rapid mass transfer process from the\nprimary to the secondary star, mainly a main sequence star. Later in the\nevolution the primary star is assumed to shrink and blow a fast tenuous wind\nthat interacts with the dense gas on the surface of the bipolar structure. We\nassume that the dense mass loss episode before the jets are launched is\nspherically symmetric. Our results might be applicable to some planetary\nnebulae, and further emphasize the large variety of morphological features that\ncan be formed by jets. But we could not reproduce some of the properties of the\nouter rings of SN1987A. It seems that some objects, like SN1987A, require a\npre-jets mass loss episode with a mass concentration at mid-latitudes.\n", "  High-contrast adaptive optics imaging is a powerful technique to probe the\narchitectures of planetary systems from the outside-in and survey the\natmospheres of self-luminous giant planets. Direct imaging has rapidly matured\nover the past decade and especially the last few years with the advent of\nhigh-order adaptive optics systems, dedicated planet-finding instruments with\nspecialized coronagraphs, and innovative observing and post-processing\nstrategies to suppress speckle noise. This review summarizes recent progress in\nhigh-contrast imaging with particular emphasis on observational results,\ndiscoveries near and below the deuterium-burning limit, and a practical\noverview of large-scale surveys and dedicated instruments. I conclude with a\nstatistical meta-analysis of deep imaging surveys in the literature. Based on\nobservations of 384 unique and single young ($\\approx$5--300~Myr) stars\nspanning stellar masses between 0.1--3.0~\\Msun, the overall occurrence rate of\n5--13~\\Mjup \\ companions at orbital distances of 30--300~AU is\n0.6$^{+0.7}_{-0.5}$\\% assuming hot-start evolutionary models. The most massive\ngiant planets regularly accessible to direct imaging are about as rare as hot\nJupiters are around Sun-like stars. Dividing this sample into individual\nstellar mass bins does not reveal any statistically-significant trend in planet\nfrequency with host mass: giant planets are found around 2.8$^{+3.7}_{-2.3}$\\%\nof BA stars, $<$4.1\\% of FGK stars, and $<$3.9\\% of M dwarfs. Looking forward,\nextreme adaptive optics systems and the next generation of ground- and\nspace-based telescopes with smaller inner working angles and deeper detection\nlimits will increase the pace of discovery to ultimately map the demographics,\ncomposition, evolution, and origin of planets spanning a broad range of masses\nand ages.\n", "  The goal of this work is to study the magnetic fields of six young\nsolar-analogue stars both individually, and collectively, to search for\npossible magnetic field trends with age. If such trends are found, they can be\nused to understand magnetism in the context of stellar evolution of solar-like\nstars and, the past of the Sun and the solar system. This is also important for\nthe atmospheric evolution of the inner planets, Earth in particular. We used\nStokes IV data from two different spectropolarimeters, NARVAL and HARPSpol. The\nleast-squares deconvolution multi-line technique was used to increase the\nsignal-to-noise ratio of the data. We then applied a modern Zeeman-Doppler\nimaging code in order to reconstruct the magnetic topology of all stars and the\nbrightness distribution of one of our studied stars. Our results show a\nsignificant decrease in the magnetic field strength and energy as the stellar\nage increases from 100Myr to 250Myr while there is no significant age\ndependence of the mean magnetic field strength for stars with ages 250-650Myr.\nThe spread in the mean field strength between different stars is comparable to\nthe scatter between different observations of individual stars. The meridional\nfield component has the weakest strength compared to the radial and azimuthal\nfield components in 15 out of the 16 magnetic maps. It turns out that 89-97% of\nthe magnetic field energy is contained in l=1-3. There is also no clear trend\nwith age and distribution of field energy into poloidal/toroidal and\naxisymmetric/non-axisymmetric components within the sample. The two oldest\nstars in this study do show a twice as strong octupole component compared to\nthe quadrupole component. This is only seen in one out of 13 maps of the\nyounger stars. One star, chi1 Ori displays two field polarity switches during\nalmost 5 years of observations suggesting a magnetic cycle length of either 2,\n6 or 8 years.\n", "  In this paper, we consider dyonic charged AdS black hole which is holographic\ndual of a van der Waals fluid. We use logarithmic corrected entropy and study\nthermodynamics of the black hole and show that holographic picture is still\nvalid. Critical behaviors and stability also discussed. Logarithmic corrections\narises due to thermal fluctuations which are important when size of black hole\nbe small. So, thermal fluctuations interpreted as quantum effect. It means that\nwe can see quantum effect of a black hole which is a gravitational system.\n", "  Twisted ribbons subjected to a tension exhibit a remarkably rich morphology,\nfrom smooth and wrinkled helicoids, to cylindrical or faceted patterns. These\nshapes are intimately related to the instability of the natural, helicoidal\nsymmetry of the system, which generates both longitudinal and transverse\nstresses, thereby leading to buckling of the ribbon. In this paper, we focus on\nthe tessellation patterns made of triangular facets. Our experimental\nobservations are described within an \"asymptotic isometry\" approach that brings\ntogether geometry and elasticity. The geometry consists of parametrized\nfamilies of surfaces, isometric to the undeformed ribbon in the singular limit\nof vanishing thickness and tensile load. The energy, whose minimization selects\nthe favored structure among those families, is governed by the tensile work and\nbending cost of the pattern. This framework describes the coexistence lines in\na morphological phase diagram, and determines the domain of existence of\nfaceted structures.\n", "  Cosmic reionization and dark matter decay can impact observations of the\ncosmic microwave sky in a similar way. A simultaneous study of both effects is\nrequired to constrain unstable dark matter from cosmic microwave background\nobservations. We compare two reionization models with and without dark matter\ndecay. We find that a reionization model that fits also data from quasars and\nstar forming galaxies results in tighter constraints on the reionization\noptical depth $\\tau_{\\text{reio}}$, but weaker constraints on the spectral\nindex $n_{\\text{s}}$ than the conventional parametrization. We use the Planck\n2015 data to constrain the effective decay rate of dark matter to $\\Gamma_{\\rm\neff} < 2.9 \\times 10^{-25}/$s at $95$\\% C.L. This limit is robust and model\nindependent. It holds for any type of decaying dark matter and it depends only\nweakly on the chosen parametrization of astrophysical reionization. For light\ndark matter particles that decay exclusively into electromagnetic components\nthis implies a limit of $\\Gamma < 5.3 \\times 10^{-26}/$s at $95$\\% C.L.\nSpecifying the decay channels, we apply our result to the case of keV-mass\nsterile neutrinos as dark matter candidates and obtain constraints on their\nmixing angle and mass, which are comparable to the ones from the diffuse X-ray\nbackground.\n", "  A large number of direct imaging surveys for exoplanets have been performed\nin recent years, yielding the first directly imaged planets and providing\nconstraints on the prevalence and distribution of wide planetary systems.\nHowever, like most of the radial velocity ones, these surveys generally focus\non single stars, hence binaries and higher-order multiples have not been\nstudied to the same level of scrutiny. This motivated the SPOTS (Search for\nPlanets Orbiting Two Stars) survey, which is an ongoing direct imaging study of\na large sample of close binaries, started with VLT/NACO and now continuing with\nVLT/SPHERE. To complement this survey, we have identified the close binary\ntargets in 24 published direct imaging surveys. Here we present our statistical\nanalysis of this combined body of data. We analysed a sample of 117 tight\nbinary systems, using a combined Monte Carlo and Bayesian approach to derive\nthe expected values of the frequency of companions, for different values of the\ncompanion's semi-major axis. Our analysis suggest that the frequency of\nsub-stellar companions in wide orbit is moderately low ($\\lesssim $13% with a\nbest value of 6% at 95% confidence level) and not significantly different\nbetween single stars and tight binaries. One implication of this result is that\nthe very high frequency of circumbinary planets in wide orbits around\npost-common envelope binaries, implied by eclipse timing (up to 90% according\nto Zorotovic & Schreiber 2013), can not be uniquely due to planets formed\nbefore the common-envelope phase (first generation planets), supporting instead\nthe second generation planet formation or a non-Keplerian origin of the timing\nvariations.\n", "  The transneptunian region of the solar system is populated by a wide variety\nof icy bodies showing great diversity. The dwarf planet (136108) Haumea is\namong the largest TNOs and displays a highly elongated shape and hosts two\nmoons, covered with crystalline water ice like Hamuea. Haumea is also the\nlargest member of the sole TNO family known to date. A catastrophic collision\nis likely responsible for its unique characteristics. We report here on the\nanalysis of a new set of observations of Haumea obtained with SINFONI at the\nESO VLT. Combined with previous data, and using light-curve measurements in the\noptical and far infrared, we carry out a rotationally resolved spectroscopic\nstudy of the surface of Haumea. We describe the physical characteristics of the\ncrystalline water ice present on the surface of Haumea for both regions, in and\nout of the Dark Red Spot (DRS), and analyze the differences obtained for each\nindividual spectrum. The presence of crystalline water ice is confirmed over\nmore than half of the surface of Haumea. Our measurements of the average\nspectral slope confirm the redder characteristic of the spot region. Detailed\nanalysis of the crystalline water-ice absorption bands do not show significant\ndifferences between the DRS and the remaining part of the surface. We also\npresent the results of applying Hapke modeling to our data set. The best\nspectral fit is obtained with a mixture of crystalline water ice (grain sizes\nsmaller than 60 micron) with a few percent of amorphous carbon. Improvements to\nthe fit are obtained by adding ~10% of amorphous water ice. Additionally, we\nused the IFU-reconstructed images to measure the relative astrometric position\nof the largest satellite Hi`iaka and determine its orbital elements. An orbital\nsolution was computed with our genetic-based algorithm GENOID and our results\nare in full agreement with recent results.\n", "  A highly anisotropic superconducting gap is found in single crystals of FeSe\nby studying the London penetration depth, $\\Delta \\lambda$, measured down to 50\nmK in samples before and after 2.5 MeV electron irradiation. The gap minimum\nincreases with introduced point - like disorder, indicating the absence of\nsymmetry - imposed nodes. Surprisingly, the superconducting transition\ntemperature, $T_c$, \\textit{increases} by 0.4 K from $T_{c0} \\approx$ 8.8 K\nwhile the structural transition temperature, $T_s$, \\textit{decreases} by 0.9 K\nfrom $T_{s0} \\approx$91.2 K after electron irradiation. We discuss several\nexplanations for the $T_c$ enhancement, and propose that local strengthening of\nthe pair interaction by irradiation-induced Frenkel defects most likely\nexplains the phenomenon.\n", "  We introduce a model of non-Gaussian quantum channel that stems from the\ncombination of two physically relevant processes occurring in open quantum\nsystems, namely amplitude damping and dephasing. For it we find input states\napproaching zero output entropy, while respecting the input energy constraint.\nThese states fully exploit the infinite dimensionality of the Hilbert space.\nUpon truncation of the latter, the minimum output entropy remains finite and\noptimal input states for such a case are conjectured thanks to numerical\nevidences.\n", "  We statistically study the physical properties of a sample of narrow\nabsorption line (NAL) systems looking for empirical evidences to distinguish\nbetween intrinsic and intervening NALs without taking into account any a priori\ndefinition or velocity cut-off. We analyze the spectra of 100 quasars with 3.5\n< z$\\rm_{em}$ < 4.5, observed with X-shooter/VLT in the context of the XQ-100\nLegacy Survey. We detect a $\\sim$ 8 $\\sigma$ excess in the number density of\nabsorbers within 10,000 km/s of the quasar emission redshift with respect to\nthe random occurrence of NALs. This excess does not show a dependence on the\nquasar bolometric luminosity and it is not due to the redshift evolution of\nNALs. It extends far beyond the standard 5000 km/s cut-off traditionally\ndefined for associated absorption lines. We propose to modify this definition,\nextending the threshold to 10,000 km/s when also weak absorbers (equivalent\nwidth < 0.2 \\AA) are considered. We infer NV is the ion that better traces the\neffects of the quasar ionization field, offering the best statistical tool to\nidentify intrinsic systems. Following this criterion we estimate that the\nfraction of quasars in our sample hosting an intrinsic NAL system is 33\npercent. Lastly, we compare the properties of the material along the quasar\nline of sight, derived from our sample, with results based on close quasar\npairs investigating the transverse direction. We find a deficiency of cool gas\n(traced by CII) along the line of sight associated with the quasar host galaxy,\nin contrast with what is observed in the transverse direction.\n", "  We consider violation of Lorentz invariance in QED induced by a very high\nfrequency background wave. An effective theory is obtained by averaging\nobservables over the rapid field oscillations. This preserves Ward identities\nand restores translation invariance below the high frequency scale, but only\npartial Lorentz invariance: we show that the effective theory is C-invariant\nSIM(2)-QED in Very Special Relativity. Averaging generates the nonlocal terms\nfamiliar from SIM(2) theories, while the short-distance behaviour of the\nbackground field fermion propagator generates the infinite number of\nhigher-order vertices of SIM(2)-QED.\n", "  Modelling of massive stars and supernovae (SNe) plays a crucial role in\nunderstanding galaxies. From this modelling we can derive fundamental\nconstraints on stellar evolution, mass-loss processes, mixing, and the products\nof nucleosynthesis. Proper account must be taken of all important processes\nthat populate and depopulate the levels (collisional excitation, de-excitation,\nionization, recombination, photoionization, bound-bound processes). For the\nanalysis of Type Ia SNe and core collapse SNe (Types Ib, Ic and II) Fe group\nelements are particularly important. Unfortunately little data is currently\navailable and most noticeably absent are the photoionization cross-sections for\nthe Fe-peaks which have high abundances in SNe. Important interactions for both\nphotoionization and electron-impact excitation are calculated using the\nrelativistic Dirac Atomic $R$-matrix Codes (DARC) for low ionization stages of\ncobalt. All results are calculated up to photon energies of 45 eV and electron\nenergies up to 20 eV. The wavefunction representation of Co III has been\ngenerated using GRASP0 by including the dominant 3d$^7$, 3d$^6$[4s, 4p],\n3p$^4$3d$^9$ and 3p$^6$3d$^9$ configurations, resulting in 292 fine structure\nlevels. Electron-impact collision strengths and Maxwellian averaged effective\ncollision strengths across a wide range of astrophysically relevant\ntemperatures are computed for Co III. In addition, statistically weighted\nlevel-resolved ground and metastable photoionization cross-sections are\npresented for Co II and compared directly with existing work.\n", "  Using spectra taken with the AAOmega spectrograph, we measure the radial\nvelocities of over 100 stars, many of which are intermediate age carbon stars,\nin the direction of the dwarf irregular galaxy NGC 6822. Kinematic analysis\nsuggests that the carbon stars in the sample are associated with NGC 6822, and\nestimates of its radial velocity and galactic rotation are made from a\nstar-by-star analysis of its carbon star population. We calculate a\nheliocentric radial velocity for NGC 6822 of $-51\\pm3$ \\kms\\ and show that the\npopulation rotates with a mean rotation speed of $11.2\\pm2.1$ \\kms\\ at a mean\ndistance of 1.1 kpc from the galactic centre, about a rotation axis with a\nposition angle of $26^\\circ\\pm13^\\circ$, as projected on the sky. This is close\nto the rotation axis of the HI gas disk and suggests that NGC 6822 is not a\npolar ring galaxy, but is dynamically closer to a late type galaxy. However,\nthe rotation axis is not aligned with the minor axis of the AGB isodensity\nprofiles and this remains a mystery.\n", "  Synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments were performed on the network\ncompounds Ba1-xSrxAl2O4 at temperatures between 15 and 800 K. The ferroelectric\nphase of the parent BaAl2O4 is largely suppressed by the Sr-substitution and\ndisappears for $x\\geq0.1$. Structural refinements reveal that the isotropic\natomic displacement parameter ($B_{\\rm iso}$) in the bridging oxygen atom for\n$x\\geq0.05$ is largely independent of temperature and retains an anomalously\nlarge value in the adjacent paraelectric phase even at the lowest temperature.\nThe $B_{\\rm iso}$ systematically increases as $x$ increases, exhibiting an\nespecially large value for $x\\geq0.5$. According to previous electron\ndiffraction experiments for Ba1-xSrxAl2O4 with $x\\geq0.1$, strong thermal\ndiffuse scattering occurs at two reciprocal points relating to two distinct\nsoft modes at the M- and K-points over a wide range of temperatures below 800 K\n[Y. Ishii et al., Sci. Rep. 6, 19154 (2016)]. Although the latter mode\ndisappears at approximately 200 K, the former does not condense, at least down\nto 100 K. On the contrary, it still survives at low-temperature. The\nanomalously large $B_{\\rm iso}$ observed in this study is ascribed to these\nsoft modes existing in a wide temperature range.\n", "  It has been shown by Remmen and Carroll that, for a model universe which\ncontains only a kinetically canonical scalar field minimally coupled to gravity\nit is possible to choose 'special coordinates' to describe a two-dimensional\neffective phase space. The special, non-canonical, coordinates are\n$\\phi$,$\\dot{\\phi}$ and the ability to describe an effective phase space with\nthese coordinates empowers the common usage of $\\phi-\\dot{\\phi}$ as the space\nto define inflationary initial conditions. This paper extends the result to the\nfull Horndeski action. The existence of a two-dimensional effective phase space\nis shown for the general case. Subsets of the Horndeski action, relevant to\ncosmology are considered as particular examples to highlight important aspects\nof the procedure.\n", "  Polarization-dependent two-dimensional Fourier-transform spectroscopy (2DFTS)\nis performed on excitons in strained bulk GaAs layers probing the coherent\nresponse for differing amounts of strain. Biaxial tensile strain lifts the\ndegeneracy of heavy-hole (HH) and light-hole (LH) valence states, leading to an\nobserved splitting of the associated excitons at low temperature. Increasing\nthe strain increases the magnitude of the HH/LH exciton peak splitting, induces\nan asymmetry in the off-diagonal coherences, increases the difference in the HH\nand LH exciton homogenous linewidths, and increases the inhomogeneous\nbroadening of both exciton species. All results arise from strain-induced\nvariations in the local electronic environment, which is not uniform along the\ngrowth direction of the thin layers. For cross-linear polarized excitation,\nwherein excitonic signals give way to biexcitonic signals, the high-strain\nsample shows evidence of bound LH, HH, and mixed biexcitons.\n", "  We present multi-band ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared photometry,\nalong with visual-wavelength spectroscopy, of supernova (SN) 2014G in the\nnearby galaxy NGC 3448 (25 Mpc). The early-phase spectra show strong emission\nlines of the high ionisation species He II/N IV/C IV during the first 2-3 d\nafter explosion, traces of a metal-rich CSM probably due to pre-explosion mass\nloss events. These disappear by day 9 and the spectral evolution then continues\nmatching that of normal Type II SNe. The post-maximum light curve declines at a\nrate typical of Type II-L class. The extensive photometric coverage tracks the\ndrop from the photospheric stage and constrains the radioactive tail, with a\nsteeper decline rate than that expected from the $^{56}$Co decay if\n$\\gamma$-rays are fully trapped by the ejecta. We report the appearance of an\nunusual feature on the blue-side of H$\\alpha$ after 100 d, which evolves to\nappear as a flat spectral feature linking H$\\alpha$ and the O I doublet. This\nmay be due to interaction of the ejecta with a strongly asymmetric, and\npossibly bipolar CSM. Finally, we report two deep spectra at ~190 and 340 d\nafter explosion, the latter being arguably one of the latest spectra for a Type\nII-L SN. By modelling the spectral region around the Ca II, we find a\nsupersolar Ni/Fe production. The strength of the O I $\\lambda\\lambda$6300,6363\ndoublet, compared with synthetic nebular spectra, suggests a progenitor with a\nzero-age main-sequence mass between 15 and 19 M$_\\odot$.\n", "  We propose a novel inverse-design method that enables brute-force discovery\nof photonic crystal (PhC) structures with complex spectral degeneracies. As a\nproof of principle, we demonstrate PhCs exhibiting third-order Dirac points\nformed by the \\emph{accidental} degeneracy of modes of monopolar, dipolar, and\nquadrupolar nature. We show that under suitable conditions, these modes can\ncoalesce and form a third-order exceptional point (EP3), leading to diverging\nPetermann factors. We show that the spontaneous emission (SE) rate of emitters\nat such EP3s, related to the local density of states, can be enhanced by a\nfactor of 8 in purely lossy (passive) structures, with larger enhancements\n$\\sim \\sqrt{n^3}$ possible at exceptional points of higher order $n$ or in\nmaterials with gain.\n", "  A decrease in system size can induce qualitatively different behavior\ncompared to the macroscopic behavior of the corresponding large-size system.\nThe mechanisms of this transition, which is known as the small-size transition,\ncan be attributed to either a relative increase in the noise intensity or to\nthe discreteness of the state space due to the small system size. The former\nmechanism has been intensively investigated using several toy and realistic\nmodels. However, the latter has rarely been analyzed and is sometimes confused\nwith the former, because a toy model that extracts the essence of the\ndiscreteness-induced transition mechanism is lacking. In this work, we propose\na 1- and 3-body reaction system as a minimal model of the discreteness-induced\ntransition and derive the conditions under which this transition occurs in more\ncomplex systems. This work enriches our understanding of the influence of small\nsystem size on system behavior.\n", "  The knowledge of the properties of the different exact solutions modeling\nbinary systems, is a necessary step towards the classification of physically\nsuitable solutions and its corresponding limits of applicability. In the\npresent paper, we perform an analysis of the geodesics around two\ncounter--rotating Kerr--Newman black holes endowed with opposite electric\ncharges, which achieve equilibrium by means of a strut between their\nconstituents. We find that bounded and unbounded orbits are possible. However,\ntest particles may cross between the black holes only if their angular momentum\nequals zero, otherwise, there exist a repulsive potential, which prohibits such\norbits. Two important aspects are pointed out for these trajectories: ({\\it i})\nthe motion of photons is affected once crossing the strut; and ({\\it ii})\nmassive particles exhibit oscillatory motion, as a first analog of the Sitnikov\nproblem in general relativity. The radius of the innermost stable circular\norbit as a function of the physical parameters of the black holes is also\ninvestigated.\n", "  Transverse spin angular momentum is an inherent feature of evanescent waves\nwhich may have applications in nanoscale optomechanics, spintronics, and\nquantum information technology due to the robust spin-directional coupling.\nHere we analyze a local spin angular momentum density of hybrid surface waves\npropagating along anisotropic hyperbolic metasurfaces. We reveal that, in\ncontrast to bulk plane waves and conventional surface plasmons at isotropic\ninterfaces, the spin of the hybrid surface waves can be engineered to have an\narbitrary angle with the propagation direction. This property allows to tailor\ndirectivity of surface waves via the magnetic control of the spin projection of\nquantum emitters, and it can be useful for optically controlled spin transfer.\n", "  The significant role of interfacial coupling on the superconductivity\nenhancement in FeSe films on SrTiO3 has been widely recognized. But the\nexplicit origination of this coupling is yet to be identified. Here by surface\nphonon measurements using high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy, we\nfound electric field generated by Fuchs-Kliewer (F-K) phonon modes of SrTiO3\ncan penetrate into FeSe films and strongly interact with electrons therein. The\nmode-specific electron-phonon coupling (EPC) constant for the ~92 meV F-K\nphonon is ~0.25 in the single-layer FeSe on SrTiO3. With increasing FeSe\nthickness, the penetrating field intensity decays exponentially, which matches\nwell the observed exponential decay of the superconducting gap. It is\nunambiguously shown that the SrTiO3 F-K phonon penetrating into FeSe is\nessential in the interfacial superconductivity enhancement.\n", "  We study spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity in the one-band Hubbard\nmodel. Higher order effective interactions in $U$ give rise to a\nsuperconducting instability which is very sensitive to changes in the Fermi\nsurface topology arising as a function of doping and changes in the band\nstructure. We show the superconducting phase diagram as a function of doping\nand next-nearest neighbor hopping in the limit of very small Coulomb\ninteraction strength and discuss peculiarities arising at the phase boundaries\nseparating different superconducting domains.\n", "  It is known that the present electroweak vacuum is likely to be metastable\nand it may lead to a serious instability during/after inflation. We propose a\nsimple solution to the problem of vacuum instability during/after inflation. If\nthere is a moduli field which has Planck-suppressed interactions with the\nstandard model fields, the Higgs quartic coupling in the early universe\nnaturally takes a different value from the present one. A slight change of the\nquartic coupling in the early universe makes the Higgs potential absolutely\nstable and hence we are free from the vacuum instability during/after\ninflation.\n", "  We propose that two recent intermediate luminosity optical transients\n(ILOTs), M31LRN 2015 and SN 2015bh (SNHunt 275; PTF 13efv) can be accounted for\nwith a stellar binary model involving mass transfer that leads to the launching\nof jets. We inspect observations of the ILOT M31LRN 2015 and conclude that it\ncannot be explained by the onset of a common envelope evolution (CEE). Instead\nwe conjecture that a $M \\simeq 1 - 3 ~\\rm{M_\\odot}$ main sequence star accreted\n$\\simeq 0.04 ~\\rm{M_\\odot}$ from the giant star, possibly during a periastron\npassage. The main sequence star accreted mass through an accretion disc, that\nlaunches jets. The radiation from the disk and the collision of the jets with\nthe ambient gas can account for the luminosity of the event. Along similar\nlines, we suggest that the 2013 eruption of SN 2015bh (SNHunt~275) can also be\nexplained by the High-Accretion-Powered ILOT (HAPI) model. In this case a\nmassive secondary star $M_2 \\gtrsim 10 ~\\rm{M_\\odot}$ accreted $\\approx 0.05\n~\\rm{M_\\odot}$ from a much more massive and more evolved star during a\nperiastron passage. If the much more energetic 2015 outburst of SN 2015bh\n(SNHunt 275) was not a supernova explosion, it might have been a full almost\nhead-on merger event, or else can be accounted for by a the HAPI-jets model in\na very highly eccentric orbit.\n", "  We find and study the properties of black hole solutions for a subclass of\nHorndeski theory including the cubic Galileon term. The theory under study has\nshift symmetry but not reflection symmetry for the scalar field. The Galileon\nis assumed to have linear time dependence characterized by a velocity\nparameter. We give analytic 3-dimensional solutions that are akin to the BTZ\nsolutions but with a non-trivial scalar field that modifies the effective\ncosmological constant. We then study the 4-dimensional asymptotically flat and\nde Sitter solutions. The latter present three different branches according to\ntheir effective cosmological constant. For two of these branches, we find\nfamilies of black hole solutions, parametrized by the velocity of the scalar\nfield. These spherically symmetric solutions, obtained numerically, are\ndifferent from GR solutions close to the black hole event horizon, while they\nhave the same de-Sitter asymptotic behavior. The velocity parameter represents\nblack hole primary hair.\n", "  We study the spin Hall magnetoresistance effect in ferrimagnet/normal metal\nbilayers, comparing the response in collinear and canted magnetic phases. In\nthe collinear magnetic phase, in which the sublattice magnetic moments are all\naligned along the same axis, we observe the conventional spin Hall\nmagnetoresistance. In contrast, in the canted phase, the magnetoresistance\nchanges sign. Using atomistic spin model calculations of the magnetic\nconfiguration, we show that the electric transport for the different magnetic\nphases can be rationalized considering the individual sublattice moment\norientations. This enables a magneto-transport based investigation of\nnon-collinear magnetic textures.\n", "  An obstacle for spin-based quantum sensors is magnetic noise due to proximal\nspins. However, such a spin cluster surrounding the sensor can become an asset,\nif it can be controlled. Here, we polarize and readout a cluster of three\nnitrogen (N) electron spins coupled to a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) spin in\ndiamond. We further achieve sub-nm localization of the cluster spins. Finally,\nwe demonstrate coherent spin exchange between the species by simultaneous\ndressing of the NV and the N states. These results establish the feasibility of\nenvironment-assisted sensing and quantum simulations with diamond spins.\n", "  The Peccei-Quinn mechanism proposed to solve the CP problem of Quantum\nChromodynamics has as consequence the existence of axions, hypothetical weakly\ninteracting particles whose mass is constrained to be on the sub-eV range. If\nthese particles exist and interact with electrons, they would be emitted from\nthe dense interior of white dwarfs, becoming an important energy sink for the\nstar. Due to their well known physics, white dwarfs are good laboratories to\nstudy the properties of fundamental particles such as the axions. We study the\ngeneral effect of axion emission on the evolution of helium-rich white dwarfs\nand on their pulsational properties. To this aim, we calculate evolutionary\nhelium-rich white dwarf models with axion emission, and asses the pulsational\nproperties of this models. Our results indicate that the rates of change of\npulsation periods are significantly affected by the existence of axions. We are\nable for the first time to independently constrain the mass of the axion from\nthe study of pulsating helium-rich white dwarfs. To do this, we use an\nestimation of the rate of change of period of the pulsating white dwarf PG\n1351+489 corresponding to the dominant pulsation period. From an\nasteroseismological model of PG 1351+489 we obtain $g_{ae}<3.3\\times10^{-13}$\nfor the axion-electron coupling constant, or $m_a\\cos^2{\\beta}\\lesssim$ 11.5\nmeV for the axion mass. This constraint is relaxed to\n$g_{ae}<5.5\\times10^{-13}$ ($m_a\\cos^2{\\beta}\\lesssim$ 19.5 meV), when no\ndetailed asteroseismological model is adopted for the comparison with\nobservations.\n", "  We use a reservoir engineering technique based on two-tone driving to\ngenerate and stabilize a quantum squeezed state of a micron-scale mechanical\noscillator in a microwave optomechanical system. Using an independent\nbackaction evading measurement to directly quantify the squeezing, we observe\n$4.7\\pm0.9$ dB of squeezing below the zero-point level, surpassing the 3 dB\nlimit of standard parametric squeezing techniques. Our measurements also reveal\nevidence for an additional mechanical parametric effect. The interplay between\nthis effect and the optomechanical interaction enhances the amount of squeezing\nobtained in the experiment.\n", "  We present a circuit-compatible compact model of the intrinsic capacitances\nof graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs). Together with a compact drain\ncurrent model, a large-signal model of GFETs is developed combining both models\nas a tool for simulating the electrical behavior of graphene-based integrated\ncircuits, dealing with the DC, transient behavior, and frequency response of\nthe circuit. The drain current model is based in a drift-diffusion mechanism\nfor the carrier transport coupled with an appropriate field-effect approach.\nThe intrinsic capacitance model consists of a 16-capacitance matrix including\nself-capacitances and transcapacitances of a four-terminal GFET. To guarantee\ncharge conservation, a Ward-Dutton linear charge partition scheme has been\nused. The large-signal model has been implemented in Verilog-A, being\ncompatible with conventional circuit simulators and serving as a starting point\ntoward the complete GFET device model that could incorporate additional\nnon-idealities.\n", "  This paper presents a circuit performance benchmarking using the large-signal\nmodel of graphene field effect transistor reported in Part I of this two-part\npaper. To test the model, it has been implemented in a circuit simulator.\nSpecifically we have simulated a high-frequency performance amplifier, together\nwith other circuits that take advantage of the ambipolarity of graphene, such\nas a frequency doubler, a radio-frequency subharmonic mixer and a multiplier\nphase detector. A variety of simulations comprising DC, transient dynamics,\nBode diagram, S-parameters, and power spectrum have been compared with\nexperimental data to assess the validity of the model.\n", "  Inferring cosmological parameters from time-delay strong lenses requires a\nsignificant investment of telescope time; it is therefore tempting to focus on\nthe systems with the brightest sources, the highest image multiplicities and\nthe widest image separations. We investigate if this selection bias can\ninfluence the properties of the lenses studied and the cosmological parameters\nthat are inferred. Using a population of lenses with ellipsoidal powerlaw\ndensity profiles, we build a sample of double and quadruple image systems.\nAssuming reasonable thresholds on image separation and flux, based on current\nlens monitoring campaigns, we find that the typical density profile slopes of\nmonitorable lenses are significantly shallower than the input ensemble. From a\nsample of quadruple image lenses we find that this selection function can\nintroduce a 3.5% bias on the inferred time-delay distances if the ensemble of\ndeflector properties is used as a prior for a cosmographical analysis. This\nbias remains at the 2.4% level when high resolution imaging of the quasar host\nis used to precisely infer the density profiles of individual lenses. We also\ninvestigate if the lines-of-sight for monitorable strong lenses are biased.\nAfter adding external convergence, $\\kappa$, and shear to our lens population\nwe find that the expectation value for $\\kappa$ is increased by 0.004 and 0.009\nfor doubles and quads respectively. $\\kappa$ is degenerate with the value of\n$H_0$ inferred from time delays; fortunately the shift in $\\kappa$ only induces\na 0.9 (0.4) percent bias on $H_0$ for quads (doubles). We therefore conclude\nthat whilst the properties of typical quasar lenses and their lines-of-sight do\ndeviate from the global population, the total magnitude of this effect is\nlikely a subdominant effect for current analyses, but has the potential to be a\nmajor systematic for samples of $\\sim$25 or more lenses.\n", "  Compensated isocurvature perturbations (CIPs) are modes in which the baryon\nand dark matter density fluctuations cancel. They arise in the curvaton\nscenario as well as some models of baryogenesis. While they leave no observable\neffects on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) at linear order, they do\nspatially modulate two-point CMB statistics and can be reconstructed in a\nmanner similar to gravitational lensing. Due to the similarity between the\neffects of CMB lensing and CIPs, lensing contributes nearly Gaussian random\nnoise to the CIP estimator that approximately doubles the reconstruction noise\npower. Additionally, the cross correlation between lensing and the integrated\nSachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect generates a correlation between the CIP estimator and\nthe temperature field even in the absence of a correlated CIP signal. For\ncosmic-variance limited temperature measurements out to multipoles $l \\leq\n2500$, subtracting a fixed lensing bias degrades the detection threshold for\nCIPs by a factor of $1.3$, whether or not they are correlated with the\nadiabatic mode.\n", "  Two-dimensional (2-D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have shown\nnumerous interesting physical and chemical properties, making them promising\nmaterials for electronic, optoelectronic, and energy applications. Tuning\nthermal conductivity of two-dimensional (2-D) materials could expand their\napplicability in many of these fields. In this paper, we propose a strategy of\nusing alloying and nanodomains to suppress the thermal conductivity of 2-D\nmaterials. To predict the thermal conductivity of 2-D alloy embedded with\nnanodomains, we employ the Green's function approach to assess the phonon\nscattering strength due to alloying and nanodomain embedding. Our\nfirst-principles-driven phonon Boltzmann transport equation calculations show\nthat the thermal conductivity of single-layer MoS2 can be reduced to less than\none-tenth of its intrinsic thermal conductivity after alloying with W and\nintroducing nanodomains due to the strong scattering for both high- and\nlow-frequency phonons. The strategies to further reduce the thermal\nconductivity are also discussed.\n", "  In massive numerical experiments we show that a planet embedded in a\nplanetesimal disk induces a characteristic multi-lane \"planetosignature\"\nrepresenting a pattern of several stellar-centric rings. If the planet's mass\nis large enough, the multi-lane signature degenerates to a three-lane one: then\nit consists of three rings, one bright coorbital with the planet, and two dark\ngaps in the radial distribution of the particles. The gaps correspond to\norbital resonances 2:1 and 1:2 with the planet. This theoretical prediction may\nexplain recent ALMA observations of the disk of HL Tau.\n", "  The recent LIGO detection of gravitational waves (GW150914), likely\noriginating from the merger of two $\\sim 30 M_\\odot$ black holes suggests\nprogenitor stars of low metallicity ($[Z/Z_\\odot] \\lesssim 0.3$), constraining\nwhen and where the progenitor of GW150914 may have formed. We combine estimates\nof galaxy properties (metallicity, star formation rate and merger rate) across\ncosmic time to predict the low redshift black hole - black hole merger rate as\na function of present day host galaxy mass, $M_\\mathrm{gal}$, and the formation\nredshift of the progenitor system $z_\\mathrm{form}$ for different progenitor\nmetallicities $Z_\\mathrm{c}$. At $Z_\\mathrm{c}=0.1 Z_\\odot$, the signal is\ndominated by binaries in massive galaxies with $z_\\mathrm{form}\\simeq 2$, with\na small contribution from binaries formed around $z_\\mathrm{form}\\simeq 0.5$ in\ndwarf galaxies. For $Z_\\mathrm{c}=0.01Z_\\odot$, fast mergers are possible and\nvery recent star formation in dwarfs likely dominates. Additional gravitational\nwave detections from merging massive black holes will provide constraints on\nthe mass-metallicity relation and massive star formation at high redshifts.\n", "  Quantum phases characterized by surfaces of gapless excitations are known to\nviolate the otherwise ubiquitous boundary law of entanglement entropy in the\nform of a multiplicative log correction: $S\\sim L^{d-1} \\log L$. Using\nvariational Monte Carlo, we calculate the second R\\'enyi entropy for a model\nwavefunction of the $\\nu=1/2$ composite Fermi liquid (CFL) state defined on the\ntwo-dimensional triangular lattice. By carefully studying the scaling of the\ntotal R\\'enyi entropy and, crucially, its contributions from the modulus and\nsign of the wavefunction on various finite-size geometries, we argue that the\nprefactor of the leading $L \\log L$ term is equivalent to that in the analogous\nfree fermion wavefunction. In contrast to the recent results of Shao et al.\n[PRL 114, 206402 (2015)], we thus conclude that the \"Widom formula\" holds even\nin this non-Fermi liquid CFL state. More generally, our results further\nelucidate---and place on a more quantitative footing---the relationship between\nnontrivial wavefunction sign structure and $S\\sim L \\log L$ entanglement\nscaling in such highly entangled gapless phases.\n", "  We discuss a generalization of the dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) for\nstrongly correlated systems close to a Mott transition based on a systematic\napproximation of the fully irreducible four-point vertex. It is an atomic-limit\napproximation of a functional of the one- and two-particle Green functions,\nbuilt with the second Legendre transform of the free energy with respect to the\ntwo-particle Green function. This functional is represented diagrammatically by\nfour-particle irreducible (4PI) diagrams. Like the dynamical vertex\napproximation (D$\\Gamma$A), the fully irreducible vertex is computed from a\nquantum impurity model whose bath is self-consistently determined by solving\nthe parquet equations. However, in contrast with D$\\Gamma$A and DMFT, the\ninteraction term of the impurity model is also self-consistently determined.\nThe method interpolates between the parquet approximation at weak coupling and\nthe atomic limit, where it is exact. It is applicable to systems with\nshort-range and long-range interactions.\n", "  We perform one-dimensional radiation hydrodynamical simulations to solve\naccretion flows onto massive black holes (BHs) with a very high rate. Assuming\nthat photon trapping limits the luminosity emerging from the central region to\n$L\\lesssim L_{\\rm Edd}$, Inayoshi, Haiman & Ostriker (2016) have shown that an\naccretion flow settles to a \"hyper-Eddington\" solution, with a steady and\nisothermal ($T\\simeq 8000$ K) Bondi profile reaching $\\gtrsim 5000$ times the\nEddington accretion rate $\\dot{M}_{\\rm Edd}\\equiv L_{\\rm Edd}/c^2$. Here we\naddress the possibility that gas accreting with finite angular momentum forms a\nbright nuclear accretion disc, with a luminosity exceeding the Eddington limit\n($1\\lesssim L/L_{\\rm Edd}\\lesssim 100$). Combining our simulations with an\nanalytic model, we find that a transition to steady hyper-Eddington accretion\nstill occurs, as long as the luminosity remains below $L/L_{\\rm Edd}\\lesssim\n35~(M_{\\rm BH}/10^4~M_\\odot)^{3/2}(n_\\infty/10^5~{\\rm\ncm^{-3}})(T_\\infty/10^4~{\\rm K})^{-3/2}(r_{\\star}/10^{14}~{\\rm cm})^{-1/2}$,\nwhere $n_\\infty$ and $T_\\infty$ are the density and temperature of the ambient\ngas, and $r_\\star$ is the radius of the photosphere, at which radiation\nemerges. If the luminosity exceeds this value, accretion becomes episodic. Our\nresults can be accurately recovered in a toy model of an optically thick\nspherical shell, driven by radiation force into a collapsing medium. When the\ncentral source is dimmer than the above critical value, the expansion of the\nshell is halted and reversed by ram pressure of the collapsing medium, and by\nshell's weight. Our results imply that rapid, unimpeded hyper-Eddington\naccretion is possible even if the luminosity of the central source far exceeds\nthe Eddington limit, and can be either steady or strongly episodic.\n", "  We estimate the potential of present and future interferometric\ngravitational-wave detectors to test the Kerr nature of black holes through\n\"gravitational spectroscopy,\" i.e. the measurement of multiple quasinormal mode\nfrequencies from the remnant of a black hole merger. Using population synthesis\nmodels of the formation and evolution of stellar-mass black hole binaries, we\nfind that Voyager-class interferometers will be necessary to perform these\ntests. Gravitational spectroscopy in the local Universe may become routine with\nthe Einstein Telescope, but a 40-km facility like Cosmic Explorer is necessary\nto go beyond $z\\sim 3$. In contrast, eLISA-like detectors should carry out a\nfew - or even hundreds - of these tests every year, depending on uncertainties\nin massive black hole formation models. Many space-based spectroscopical\nmeasurements will occur at high redshift, testing the strong gravity dynamics\nof Kerr black holes in domains where cosmological corrections to general\nrelativity (if they occur in nature) must be significant.\n", "  We investigate the conditions yielding plasmon-exciton strong coupling at the\nsingle emitter level in the gap between two metal nanoparticles. A\nquasi-analytical transformation optics approach is developed that makes\npossible a thorough exploration of this hybrid system incorporating the full\nrichness of its plasmonic spectrum. This allows us to reveal that by placing\nthe emitter away from the cavity center, its coupling to multipolar dark modes\nof both even and odd parity increases remarkably. This way, reversible dynamics\nin the population of the quantum emitter takes place in feasible\nimplementations of this archetypal nanocavity.\n", "  It is by now well established that the magnitude of the two-point\nangular-correlation function of the cosmic microwave background temperature\nanisotropies is anomalously low for angular separations greater than about 60\ndegrees. Physics explanations of this anomaly typically focus on the properties\nof the Universe at the surface of last scattering, relying on the fact that\nlarge-angle temperature fluctuations are dominated by the Sachs-Wolfe effect\n(SW). However, these fluctuations also receive important contributions from the\nintegrated Sachs-Wolfe effect (ISW) at both early (eISW) and late ($\\ell$ISW)\ntimes. Here we study the correlations in those large-angle temperature\nfluctuations and their relative contributions to $S_{1/2}$ -- the standard\nmeasure of the correlations on large angular scales. We find that in the\nbest-fitting $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology, while the auto-correlation of the early\ncontributions (SW plus eISW) dominates $S_{1/2}$, there are also significant\ncontributions originating from cross-terms between the early and late\ncontributions. In particular, realizations of $\\Lambda$CDM with low $S_{1/2}$\nare typically produced from a combination of somewhat low pure-early\ncorrelations and accidental cancellations among early-late correlations. We\nalso find that if the pure $\\ell$ISW auto-correlations were the only\ncontribution to $S_{1/2}$ in $\\Lambda$CDM, then the $p$-value of the observed\ncut-sky $S_{1/2}$ would be unremarkable. This suggests that physical mechanisms\noperating only at or near the last scattering surface could explain the\nobserved lack of large-angle correlations, though this is not the typical\nresolution within $\\Lambda$CDM.\n", "  We find the first binary black hole event horizon with a toroidal topology.\nIt had been predicted that generically the event horizons of merging black\nholes should briefly have a toroidal topology, but such a phase has never been\nseen prior to this work. In all previous binary black hole simulations, in the\ncoordinate slicing used to evolve the black holes, the topology of the event\nhorizon transitions directly from two spheres during the inspiral to a single\nsphere as the black holes merge. We present a coordinate transformation to a\nfoliation of spacelike hypersurfaces that \"cut a hole\" through the event\nhorizon surface, resulting in a toroidal event horizon. A torus could\npotentially provide a mechanism for violating topological censorship. However,\nthese toroidal event horizons satisfy topological censorship by construction,\nbecause we can always trivially apply the inverse coordinate transformation to\nremove the topological feature.\n", "  With Advanced LIGO detecting the gravitational waves emitted from a pair of\nmerging black holes in late 2015, we have a new perspective into the strong\nfield regime of binary black hole systems. Event horizons are the defining\nfeatures of such black hole spacetimes. We introduce a new code for locating\nevent horizons in numerical simulations based on a Delaunay triangulation on a\ntopological sphere. The code can automatically refine arbitrary regions of the\nevent horizon surface to find and explore features such as the hole in a\ntoroidal event horizon, as discussed in our companion paper. We also\ninvestigate various ways of integrating the geodesic equation and find\nevolution equations that can be integrated efficiently with high accuracy.\n", "  We develop a quantum dynamical field theory for studying phase transitions in\ndriven open systems coupled to Markovian noise, where non-linear noise effects\nand fluctuations beyond semiclassical approximations influence the critical\nbehaviour. We systematically compare the diagrammatics, the properties of the\nrenormalization group flow and the structure of the fixed points, of the novel\nquantum dynamical field theory and of its semi-classical counterpart, which is\nemployed to characterise dynamical criticality in three dimensional\ndriven-dissipative condensates. As an application, we perform the Keldysh\nFunctional Renormalization of a one dimensional driven open Bose gas, where a\ntailored diffusion Markov noise realises an analog of quantum criticality for\ndriven-dissipative condensation. We find that the associated non-equilibrium\nquantum phase transition does not map into the critical behaviour of its three\ndimensional classical driven counterpart.\n", "  The angular distributions of Drell-Yan charged lepton pairs around the\n$Z$-boson mass peak probe the underlying QCD dynamics of $Z$-boson production.\nThis paper presents a measurement of the complete set of angular coefficients\n$A_{0-7}$ describing these distributions in the $Z$-boson Collins-Soper frame.\nThe data analysed correspond to 20.3 fb$^{-1}$ of $pp$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s}\n= 8$ TeV, collected by the ATLAS detector at the CERN LHC. The measurements are\ncompared to the most precise fixed-order calculations currently available\n($\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha^{2}_{s})$) and with theoretical predictions embedded in\nMonte Carlo generators. The measurements are precise enough to probe QCD\ncorrections beyond the formal accuracy of these calculations and to provide\ndiscrimination between different parton-shower models. A significant deviation\nfrom the $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha^{2}_{s})$ predictions is observed for\n$A_{0}-A_{2}$. Evidence is found for non-zero $A_{5,6,7}$, consistent with\nexpectations.\n", "  We discuss the two-gluon exchange contribution (formally three-loops) to\nelastic photon-photon scattering in the high-energy approximation. The elastic\n$\\gamma\\gamma \\to \\gamma \\gamma$ amplitude is given in the impact-factor\nrepresentation for all helicity configurations and finite quark masses. We\ndiscuss the importance of including the charm quark, which contribution, due to\ninterference, can enhance the cross section considerably. We investigate the\ncontribution to the $\\gamma \\gamma \\to \\gamma \\gamma$ amplitude from the soft\nregion, by studying its dependence on nonperturbative gluon mass. Helicity-flip\ncontributions are shown to be much smaller than helicity-conserving ones. We\nidentify region(s) of phase space where the two-gluon exchange contribution\nbecomes important ingredient compared to box and nonperturbative VDM-Regge\nmechanisms considered in the literature. Consequences for the $A A \\to A A\n\\gamma \\gamma$ reaction are discussed. Several differential distributions are\nshown. A feasibility study to observe the effect of two-gluon exchange is\npresented. We perform a similar analysis for the $p p \\to p p \\gamma \\gamma$\nreaction. Only by imposing severe cuts on $M_{\\gamma \\gamma}$ and a narrow\nwindow on photon transverse momenta the two gluon contribution becomes\ncomparable to the box contribution but the corresponding cross section is\nrather small.\n", "  Three Earth-sized exoplanets were recently discovered close to the habitable\nzone of the nearby ultracool dwarf star TRAPPIST-1. The nature of these planets\nhas yet to be determined, since their masses remain unmeasured and no\nobservational constraint is available for the planetary population surrounding\nultracool dwarfs, of which the TRAPPIST-1 planets are the first transiting\nexample. Theoretical predictions span the entire atmospheric range from\ndepleted to extended hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. Here, we report a\nspace-based measurement of the combined transmission spectrum of the two inner\nplanets made possible by a favorable alignment resulting in their simultaneous\ntransits on 04 May 2016. The lack of features in the combined spectrum rules\nout cloud-free hydrogen-dominated atmospheres for each planet at 10-$\\sigma$\nlevels; TRAPPIST-1 b and c are hence unlikely to harbor an extended gas\nenvelope as they lie in a region of parameter space where high-altitude\ncloud/haze formation is not expected to be significant for hydrogen-dominated\natmospheres. Many denser atmospheres remain consistent with the featureless\ntransmission spectrum---from a cloud-free water vapour atmosphere to a\nVenus-like atmosphere.\n", "  We experimentally study the optical- and terahertz- induced rotational\ndynamics of asymmetric molecules in the gas phase. Terahertz and optical fields\nare identified as two distinct control handles over asymmetric molecules, as\nthey couple to the rotational degrees of freedom via the molecular- dipole and\npolarizability selectively. The distinction between those two rotational\nhandles is highlighted by different types of quantum revivals observed in long\nduration (>100ps) field-free rotational evolution. The experimental results are\nin excellent agreement with Random Phase Wave Function simulations [Phys. Rev.\nA 91, 063420 (2015)] and provide verification of the RPWF as an efficient\nmethod for calculating asymmetric molecular dynamics at ambient temperatures,\nwhere exact calculation methods are practically not feasible. Our observations\nand analysis pave the way for orchestrated excitations by both optical and THz\nfields as complementary rotational handles, that enable a plethora of new\npossibilities in three-dimensional rotational control of asymmetric molecules.\n", "  We study the electromagnetic spectrum of accretion disks around neutron and\nstrange stars in $\\mathcal{R}^2$ gravity. Both static and rapidly rotating\nmodels are investigated. The results are compared with the General Relativistic\nresults. We found difference between the results in both theories of about 50\\%\nfor the electromagnetic flux and about 20\\% in the luminosity for models with\nequal mass and angular velocity in both theories. The observed differences are\nmuch lower for models rotating with Kelperian velocity and with equal masses.\n", "  We present the detection, performed with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio\nTelescope (WSRT) and the Karl Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), of a fast HI 21-cm\noutflow in the ultra-luminous infrared galaxy Mrk 231. The outflow is observed\nas shallow HI absorption blueshifted ~1300 km/s with respect to the systemic\nvelocity and located against the inner kpc of the radio source. The outflowing\ngas has an estimated column density between 5 and 15x10^18 Tspin cm^-2. We\nderive the Tspin to lie in the range 400-2000 K and the densities are\nn_HI~10-100 cm^-3. Our results confirm the multiphase nature of the outflow in\nMrk231. Although effects of the interaction between the radio plasma and the\nsurrounding medium cannot be ruled out, the energetics and the lack of a clear\nkpc-scale jet suggest that the most likely origin of the HI outflow is a\nwide-angle nuclear wind, as earlier proposed to explain the neutral outflow\ntraced by NaI and molecular gas. Our results suggest that an HI component is\npresent in fast outflows regardless of the acceleration mechanism (wind vs jet\ndriven) and that it must be connected with common properties of the\npre-interaction gas. Considering the observed similarity of their column\ndensities, the HI outflow likely represents the inner part of the broad wind\nidentified on larger scales in NaI. The mass outflow rate of the HI outflow\ndoes not appear to be as large as the one observed in molecular gas. These\ncharacteristics suggest that the HI may represent a short intermediate phase in\nthe rapid cooling of the gas. We also obtained deeper continuum images than\npreviously available. At the resolution of ~1arcsec we do not see a kpc-scale\njet. Instead, we detect a plateau of emission, likely due to star formation,\nsurrounding the bright nuclear region. We also detect a poorly collimated\nbridge which may represent the channel feeding the southern lobe.\n", "  We calculate the electric dipole moment (EDM) for the neutron in the\nframework of the minimal 3-3-1 model. We assume that the only source of $CP$\nviolation arises from a complex trilinear coupling constant and two complex\nvacuum expectation values. However, from the constraint equations obtained from\nthe potential, only one physical phase remains. We find some constraints on the\npossible values of this phase and masses of the exotic particles.\n", "  It is known that electron scattering by surface polar phonons (SPPs) of the\nsubstrate reduces their mobility in supported graphene. However, there is no\nexperimental evidence for contribution of drag of electrons by SPP to\nthermoelectric phenomena in graphene: graphene thermopower exhibits good\nagreement with Mott's law, which means that the diffusion contribution to the\nthermopower is dominant in a wide range of carrier densities and temperatures.\nHere we develop a complete theory of drag of electrons in graphene by SPP. By\nsolving Boltzmann transport equation for electrons scattered by SPPs we derive\nSPP drag contribution to the thermopower in graphene. Compared to diffusion\nthermopower, obtained values appear to be one order of magnitude lower for\nvarious substrates. This can be explained by low occupation number of the SPPs\nand short mean free path of such phonons stemming from their small group\nvelocity. We conclude that experiments on thermopower in graphene can be\ntreated within the framework of Mott's law.\n", "  We present stellar evolution calculations of the remnant of the merger of two\ncarbon-oxygen white dwarfs (CO WDs). We focus on cases that have a total mass\nin excess of the Chandrasekhar mass. After the merger, the remnant manifests as\nan $L \\sim 3 \\times 10^4 L_\\odot$ source for $\\sim 10^4$ yr. A dusty wind may\ndevelop, leading these sources to be self-obscured and to appear similar to\nextreme AGB stars. Roughly $\\sim 10$ such objects should exist in the Milky Way\nand M31 at any time. As found in previous work, off-center carbon fusion is\nignited within the merger remnant and propagates inward via a carbon flame,\nconverting the WD to an oxygen-neon (ONe) composition. By following the\nevolution for longer than previous calculations, we demonstrate that after\ncarbon-burning reaches the center, neutrino-cooled Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction\nleads to off-center neon ignition in remnants with masses $\\ge 1.35 M_\\odot$.\nThe resulting neon-oxygen flame converts the core to a silicon WD. Thus,\nsuper-Chandrasekhar WD merger remnants do not undergo electron-capture induced\ncollapse as traditionally assumed. Instead, if the remnant mass remains above\nthe Chandrasekhar mass, we expect that it will form a low-mass iron core and\ncollapse to form a neutron star. Remnants that lose sufficient mass will end up\nas massive, isolated ONe or Si WDs.\n", "  We propose a hybrid quantum system where the strong coupling regime can be\nachieved between a Rydberg atomic ensemble and propagating surface phonon\npolaritons on a piezoelectric superlattice. By exploiting the large electric\ndipole moment and long lifetime of Rydberg atoms as well as tightly confined\nsurface phonon polariton modes, it is possible to achieve a coupling constant\nfar exceeding the relevant decay rates. The frequency of the surface mode can\nbe selected so it is resonant with a Rydberg transition by engineering the\npiezoelectric superlattice. We describe a way to observe the Rabi splitting\nassociated with the strong coupling regime under realistic experimental\nconditions. The system can be viewed as a new type of optomechanical system.\n", "  As a result of their internal dynamical coherence, thin stellar streams\nformed by disrupting globular clusters (GCs) can act as detectors of dark\nmatter (DM) substructure in the Galactic halo. Perturbations induced by close\nflybys amplify into detectable density gaps, providing a probe both of the\nabundance and of the masses of DM subhaloes. Here, we use N-body simulations to\nshow that the Galactic population of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) can also\nproduce gaps (and clumps) in GC streams, and so may confuse the detection of DM\nsubhaloes. We explore the cases of streams analogous to the observed Palomar 5\nand GD1 systems, quantifying the expected incidence of structure caused by GMC\nperturbations. Deep observations should detect such disturbances regardless of\nthe substructure content of the Milky Way's halo. Detailed modelling will be\nneeded to demonstrate that any detected gaps or clumps were produced by DM\nsubhaloes rather than by molecular clouds.\n", "  A relativistic Bose gas at finite density suffers from a sign problem that\nmakes direct numerical simulations not feasible. One possible solution to the\nsign problem is to re-express the path integral in terms of Lefschetz thimbles.\nUsing this approach we study the relativistic Bose gas both in the symmetric\nphase (low-density) and the spontaneously broken phase (high-density). In the\nhigh-density phase we break explicitly the symmetry and determine the\ndependence of the order parameter on the breaking. We study the relative\ncontributions of the dominant and sub-dominant thimbles in this phase. We find\nthat the sub-dominant thimble only contributes substantially when the explicit\nsymmetry breaking is small, a regime that is dominated by finite volume\neffects. In the regime relevant for the thermodynamic limit, this contribution\nis negligible.\n", "  The CEMP-no stars are long-lived small mass stars presenting a very low iron\ncontent and overabundances of carbon with no sign or only very weak signs for\nthe presence of s- or r-elements. Although the origin of that abundance pattern\nis still a matter of debate, it was very likely inherited from a previous\nmassive star, that we shall call here the source star. We rely on a recent\nclassification of CEMP-no stars arguing that some of them are made of a\nmaterial processed by hydrogen burning that was enriched in products of helium\nburning during the nuclear life of the source star. We examine the possibility\nof forming CEMP-no stars with this material. We study the nucleosynthesis of\nthe CNO cycle and the Ne-Na Mg-Al chains in a hydrogen burning single zone\nwhile injecting the helium burning products $^{12}$C, $^{16}$O, $^{22}$Ne and\n$^{26}$Mg. We investigate the impact of changing the density and temperature,\nas well as the injection rate. The nuclear reaction rates involving the\ncreation and destruction of $^{27}$Al are also examined. $^{14}$N, $^{23}$Na,\n$^{24}$Mg and $^{27}$Al are formed when injecting $^{12}$C, $^{16}$O, $^{22}$Ne\nand $^{26}$Mg in the hydrogen burning zone. The $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio is\nconstant under various conditions in the hydrogen burning zone. The predicted\n[Al/Fe] ratio varies up to $\\sim 2$ dex depending on the prescription used for\nthe reaction rates involving $^{27}$Al. The experiments we carried out support\nthe view that some CEMP-no stars are made of a material processed by hydrogen\nburning, coming from a massive star experiencing mild-to-strong rotational\nmixing. During its burning, this material was likely enriched in helium burning\nproducts. No material coming from the carbon-oxygen rich core of the source\nstar should be added to form the daughter star, otherwise the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C\nratio would be largely above the observed range of values.\n", "  The solar cycle onset at mid-latitudes, the slow down of the sunspot drift\ntoward the equator, the tail-like attachment and the overlap of successive\ncycles at the time of activity minimum are delicate issues in $\\alpha\\Omega$\ndynamo wave and flux transport dynamo models. Very different parameter values\nproduce similar results, making it difficult to understand the origin of these\nsolar cycle properties. We use GONG helioseismic data to investigate the\nprogression of the solar cycle as observed in intermediate-degree global\n$p$-mode frequency shifts at different latitudes and subsurface layers, from\nthe beginning of solar cycle 23 up to the maximum of the current solar cycle.\nWe also analyze those for high-degree modes in each hemisphere obtained through\nthe ring-diagram technique of local helioseismology. The analysis highlighted\ndifferences in the progression of the cycle below 15\\degr\\ compared to higher\nlatitudes. While the cycle starts at mid-latitudes and then migrates\nequatorward/poleward, the sunspot eruptions of the old cycle are still ongoing\nbelow 15\\degr\\ latitude. This prolonged activity causes a delay in the cycle\nonset and an overlap of successive cycles, whose extension differs in the two\nhemispheres. Then the activity level rises faster reaching a maximum\ncharacterized by a single peak structure compared to the double peak at higher\nlatitudes. Afterwards the descending phase shows up with a slower decay rate.\nThe latitudinal properties of the solar cycle progression highlighted in this\nstudy provide useful constraints to discern among the multitude of solar dynamo\nmodels.\n", "  We conclusively show that the entanglement- and the mutual information-based\nmeasures of quantum non-Markovianity are inequivalent. To this aim, we first\nanalytically solve the optimization problem in the definition of the\nentanglement-based measure for a two-level system. We demonstrate that the\noptimal initial bipartite state of the open system and the ancillary is always\ngiven by one of the Bell states for any one qubit dynamics. On top of this\nresult, we present an explicit example dynamics where memory effects emerge\naccording to the mutual information-based measure, even though the time\nevolution remains memoryless with respect to the entanglement-based measure.\nFinally, we explain this disagreement between the two measures in terms of the\ninformation dynamics of the open system, exploring the accessible and\ninaccessible parts of information.\n", "  We consider the entanglement between two spatial subregions in the\nLieb-Liniger model of bosons in one spatial dimension interacting via a contact\ninteraction. Using ground state path integral quantum Monte Carlo we\nnumerically compute the R\\'{e}nyi entropy of the reduced density matrix of the\nsubsystem as a measure of entanglement. Our numerical algorithm is based on a\nreplica method previously introduced by the authors, which we extend to\nefficiently study the entanglement of spatial subsystems of itinerant bosons.\nWe confirm a logarithmic scaling of the R\\'{e}nyi entropy with subsystem size\nthat is expected from conformal field theory, and compute the non-universal\nsubleading constant for interaction strengths ranging over two orders of\nmagnitude. In the strongly interacting limit, we find agreement with the known\nfree fermion result.\n", "  The detection by Rest et al. (2012) of light echoes from $\\eta$ Carinae has\nprovided important new observational constraints on the nature of its 1840's\nera giant eruption. Spectra of the echoes suggest a relatively cool spectral\ntemperature of about 5500K, lower than the lower limit of about 7000K suggested\nin the optically thick wind outflow analysis of Davidson (1987). This has lead\nto a debate about the viability of this steady wind model relative to\nalternative, explosive scenarios. Here we present an updated analysis of the\nwind outflow model using newer low-temperature opacity tabulations and\naccounting for the stronger mass loss implied by the $>$10 Msun mass now\ninferred for the Homunculus. A major conclusion is that, because of the sharp\ndrop in opacity due to free electron recombination for $T<$6500K, a low\ntemperature of about 5000K is compatible with, and indeed expected from, a wind\nwith the extreme mass loss inferred for the eruption. Within a spherical gray\nmodel in radiative equilibrium, we derive spectral energy distributions for\nvarious assumptions for the opacity variation of the wind, providing a basis\nfor comparisons with observed light echo spectra. The scaling results here are\nalso potentially relevant for other highly optically thick outflows, including\nthose from classical novae, giant eruptions of LBVs and SN Type IIn precursors.\nA broader issue therefore remains whether the complex, variable features\nobserved from such eruptions are better understood in terms of a steady or\nexplosive paradigm, or perhaps a balance of these idealizations.\n", "  We report results from a new HST study of the OVI 1032,1038\\AA\\ doublet in\nemission around intensely star-forming galaxies. The programme aims to\ncharacterize the energy balance in starburst galaxies and gas cooling in the\ndifficult-to-map coronal temperature regime of 2-5 x $10^5$K. We present the\nfirst resolved image of gas emission in the OVI line. Our target, SDSS\nJ1156+5008, is very compact in the continuum but displays OVI emission to radii\nof 23 kpc. The surface brightness profile is well fit by an exponential with a\nscale of 7.5kpc. This is ten times the size of the photoionized gas, and we\nestimate that 1/6 the total OVI luminosity comes from resonantly scattered\ncontinuum radiation. Spectroscopy - which closely resembles a stacked sample of\narchival spectra - confirms the OVI emission, and determines the column density\nand outflow velocity from blueshifted absorption. The combination of\nmeasurements enables several new calculations with few assumptions. The OVI\nregions fill only ~$10^{-3}$ of the volume. By comparing the cooling time with\nthe cloud sound-crossing time, the cooling distance with the size, and the\npressure in the OVI and nebular gas, we conclude that the OVI-bearing gas\ncannot have been lifted to the scale height at this temperature, and must be\ncooling in situ through this coronal temperature regime. The coronal phase\ncontains ~1% of the ionized mass, and its kinetic energy is currently ~1% of\nthe budget set by supernova feedback. However a much larger amount of the gas\nmust have cooled through this phase during the star formation episode. The\noutflow exceeds the escape velocity and the gas may become unbound, but it will\nrecombine before it escapes and become visible to Lyman (and OI) spectroscopy.\nThe mapping of this gas represents a crucial step in further constraining\ngalaxy formation scenarios and guiding the development of future satellites.\n", "  The first direct detection of gravitational waves was made in late 2015 with\nthe Advanced LIGO detectors. By prior arrangement, a worldwide collaboration of\nelectromagnetic follow-up observers were notified of candidate gravitational\nwave events during the first science run, and many facilities were engaged in\nthe search for counterparts. No counterparts were identified, which is in line\nwith expectations given that the events were classified as black hole - black\nhole mergers. However these searches laid the foundation for similar follow-up\ncampaigns in future gravitational wave detector science runs, in which the\ndetection of neutron star merger events with observable electromagnetic\ncounterparts is much more likely. Three alerts were issued to the\nelectromagnetic collaboration over the course of the first science run, which\nlasted from September 2015 to January 2016. Two of these alerts were associated\nwith the gravitational wave events since named GW150914 and GW151226. In this\npaper we provide an overview of the Liverpool Telescope contribution to the\nfollow-up campaign over this period. Given the hundreds of square degree\nuncertainty in the sky position of any gravitational wave event, efficient\nsearching for candidate counterparts required survey telescopes with large\n(~degrees) fields-of-view. The role of the Liverpool Telescope was to provide\nfollow-up classification spectroscopy of any candidates. We followed candidates\nassociated with all three alerts, observing 1, 9 and 17 candidates\nrespectively. We classify the majority of the transients we observed as\nsupernovae.\n", "  We report the analysis of the first deep optical observations of three\nisolated $\\gamma$-ray pulsars detected by the {\\em Fermi Gamma-ray Space\nTelescope}: the radio-loud PSR\\, J0248+6021 and PSR\\, J0631+1036, and the\nradio-quiet PSR\\, J0633+0632. The latter has also been detected in the X rays.\nThe pulsars are very similar in their spin-down age ($\\tau \\sim$40--60 kyrs),\nspin-down energy ($\\dot{E} \\sim10^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$), and dipolar surface\nmagnetic field ($B \\sim 3$--$5\\times10^{12}$ G). These pulsars are promising\ntargets for multi-wavelength observations, since they have been already\ndetected in $\\gamma$ rays and in radio or X-rays. None of them has been\ndetected yet in the optical band. We observed the three pulsar fields in 2014\nwith the Spanish 10.4m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC). We could not find any\ncandidate optical counterpart to the three pulsars close to their most recent\nradio or {\\em Chandra} positions down to $3 \\sigma$ limits of $g'\\sim27.3$,\n$g'\\sim27$, $g'\\sim27.3$ for PSR\\, J0248+6021, J0631+1036, and J0633+0632,\nrespectively. From the inferred optical upper limits and estimated distance and\ninterstellar extinction, we derived limits on the pulsar optical luminosity. We\nalso searched for the X-ray counterpart to PSR\\, J0248+6021 with \\chan\\ but we\ndid not detect the pulsar down to a 3$\\sigma$ flux limit of $5 \\times 10^{-14}$\nerg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ (0.3--10 keV). For all these pulsars, we compared the\noptical flux upper limits with the extrapolations in the optical domain of the\n$\\gamma$-ray spectra and compared their multi-wavelength properties with those\nof other $\\gamma$-ray pulsars of comparable age.\n", "  We present the results of an analysis for 107 extremely metal-poor (EMP)\nstars with metallicities less than [Fe/H] = -3.0, identified from\nmedium-resolution spectra in SDSS. We follow a methodology based on comparisons\nof the observed spectra with synthetic spectra. The abundances of Fe, Ca, and\nMg are determined by fitting spectral regions dominated by lines of each\nelement. In addition, we present a technique to determine upper limits for\nelements whose features are not detected in a given spectrum. We also analyse\nour sample with the SEGUE Stellar Parameter Pipeline, in order to obtain\nadditional determinations of the atmospheric parameters, iron and alpha-element\nabundances, to compare with ours, and to infer [C/Fe] ratios. We find that, in\nthese moderate to low signal-to-noise and medium-resolution spectra in this\nmetallicity regime, Ca is usually the only element that exhibits lines that are\nsufficiently strong to reliably measure its abundance. Fe and Mg exhibit weaker\nfeatures that, in most cases, only provide upper limits. We measure [Ca/Fe] and\n[Mg/Fe] for EMP stars in the SDSS spectra, and conclude that most of the stars\nexhibit the usual level of enhancement for {\\alpha}-elements, ~ +0.4, although\na number of stars for which only [Fe/H] upper limits could be estimated point\nto higher [{\\alpha}/Fe] ratios. We also find that 26 % of the stars in our\nsample can be classified as carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars, and that\nthe frequency of CEMP stars also increases with decreasing metallicity, as has\nbeen reported for previous samples. We identity a rare, bright (g = 11.90) EMP\nstar, SDSS J134144.61+474128.6, with [Fe/H] = -3.27, [C/Fe] = +0.95, and\nelevated magnesium ([Mg/Fe] = +0.62), an abundance pattern typical of CEMP-no\nstars.\n", "  Kapitza-Dirac scattering of nonrelativistic electrons from counterpropagating\nbichromatic laser waves of linear polarization is studied. The focus lies on\nthe electronic spin dynamics in the Bragg regime when the laser fields possess\na frequency ratio of two. To this end, the time-dependent Pauli equation is\nsolved numerically, both in coordinate space and momentum space. Our numerical\nresults are corroborated by analytical derivations. We demonstrate that, for\ncertain incident electron momenta, the scattering crucially relies on the\nelectron spin which undergoes characteristic Rabi-like oscillations. A\nparameter regime is identified where the Rabi oscillations reach maximum\namplitude. We also briefly discuss spin-dependent Kapitza-Dirac scattering of\nprotons.\n", "  We present a three-dimensional (3D) study of common envelope events (CEEs) to\nprovide a foundation for future one-dimensional (1D) methods to model the\nself-regulated phase of a CEE. The considered CEEs with a low-mass red giant\nend with one of three different outcomes -- merger, slow spiral-in, or prompt\nformation of a binary. To understand which physical processes determine\ndifferent outcomes, and to evaluate how well 1D simulations model the\nself-regulated phase of a CEE, we introduce tools that map our 3D models to 1D\nprofiles. We discuss the differences in the angular momentum and energy\nredistribution in 1D and 3D codes. We identified four types of ejection\nprocesses: the pre-plunge-in ejection, the outflow during the plunge-in, the\noutflow driven by recombination, and the ejection triggered by a contraction of\nthe circumbinary envelope. Significant mass is lost in all cases, including the\nmergers. Therefore a self-regulated spiral-in can start only with a strongly\nreduced envelope mass. We derive the condition to start a recombination\noutflow, which can proceed either as a runaway or a stationary outflow. We show\nthat the way the energy of the inspiraling companion is added to the envelope\nin 1D studies intensifies the envelope's entropy increase, alters the start of\nthe recombination outflow, and leads to different outcomes in 1D and 3D\nstudies. The steady recombination outflow may dispel most of the envelope in\nall slow spiral-in cases, making the existence of a long-term self-regulated\nphase debatable, at least for low-mass giant donors.\n", "  The complex magnetism and transport properties of tetragonal\nCe$_3$Cu$_4$As$_4$O$_2$ were examined through neutron scattering and physical\nproperties measurements on polycrystalline samples. The lamellar structure\nconsists of alternating layers of $\\rm CeCu_4As_4$ with a single square Ce\nlattice and oxygen-linked Ce bi-layer $\\rm Ce_2O_2$. Extending along $\\bf c$, a\ntube-like Fermi surface from DFT calculations points to a quasi-two-dimensional\nelectronic system. Peaks in the specific heat at the Ne\\'{e}l temperature\n$T_{N}=24$ $\\rm K$, $T_{2}~=~16 $ $\\rm K$ and $T_{3}~=~1.9$ $ \\rm K$ indicate\nthree magnetic phase transitions or distinct cross-over phenomena. For\n$T<T_{N}$ neutron diffraction indicates the development of ferromagnetic ab\nsheets for both Ce sites, with alternating polarization along $\\bf{c}$, a wave\nvector ${\\bf k}_{1}={\\bf c}^*$. For $T<T_{2}$, quasi-two-dimensional low-energy\nspin fluctuations with ${\\bf k}_{2}=\\frac{1}{2}{\\bf a}^*$ and polarized\nperpendicular to ${\\bf k}_{2}$ are suppressed. The data are consistent with\nquasi-two-dimensional antiferromagnetic order in the $\\rm CeCu_4As_4$ planes\npolarized along the ${\\bf k}_{2}$ wave vector. $T_{3}$ marks a spin-flop\ntransition where the ${\\bf k}_{1}$ staggered magnetization switches to in-plane\npolarization. While the narrow 4f bands lie deep below the Fermi surface, there\nare significant transport anomalies associated with the transitions; in\nparticular a substantial reduction in resistivity for $T<T_{N}$. At $T=100$ $\n\\rm mK$ the ${\\bf k}_1$ modulated staggered moment is $0.85~\\mu_B$, which\nmatches the $0.8~\\mu_B$ saturation magnetization achieved for H $~=~7$ $ \\rm T$\nat $T~=~2$ $ \\rm K$. From low T Lorentzian fits the correlation length is in\nexcess of 75 \\AA. We argue the unusual sequence of magnetic transitions results\nfrom competing interactions and anisotropies for the two Ce sites.\n", "  Combining high resolution scanning tunneling microscopy and first principle\ncalculations, we identified the major native defects, in particular the Se\nvacancies and Se interstitial defects that are responsible for the bulk\nconduction and nanoscale potential fluctuation in single crystals of archetypal\ntopological insulator Bi2Se3. Here it is established that the defect\nconcentrations in Bi2Se3 are far above the thermodynamic limit, and that the\ngrowth kinetics dominate the observed defect concentrations. Furthermore,\nthrough careful control of the synthesis, our tunneling spectroscopy suggests\nthat our best samples are approaching the intrinsic limit with the Fermi level\ninside the band gap without introducing extrinsic dopants.\n", "  The Herschel Extragalactic Legacy Project (HELP) brings together a vast range\nof data from many astronomical observatories. Its main focus is on the Herschel\ndata, which maps dust obscured star formation over 1300 deg$^2$. With this\nunprecedented combination of data sets, it is possible to investigate how the\nstar formation vs stellar mass relation (main-sequence) of star-forming\ngalaxies depends on environment. In this pilot study we explore this question\nbetween 0.1 < z < 3.2 using data in the COSMOS field. We estimate the local\nenvironment from a smoothed galaxy density field using the full photometric\nredshift probability distribution. We estimate star formation rates by stacking\nthe SPIRE data from the Herschel Multi-tiered Extragalactic Survey (HerMES).\nOur analysis rules out the hypothesis that the main-sequence for star-forming\nsystems is independent of environment at 1.5 < z < 2, while a simple model in\nwhich the mean specific star formation rate declines with increasing\nenvironmental density gives a better description. However, we cannot exclude a\nsimple hypothesis in which the main-sequence for star-forming systems is\nindependent of environment at z < 1.5 and z > 2. We also estimate the evolution\nof the star formation rate density in the COSMOS field and our results are\nconsistent with previous measurements at z < 1.5 and z > 2 but we find a\n$1.4^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ times higher peak value of the star formation rate density\nat $z \\sim 1.9$.\n", "  We have experimentally demonstrated an on-chip all-silk fibroin whispering\ngallery mode microresonator by using a simple molding and solution-casting\ntechnique. The quality factors of the fabricated silk protein microresonators\nare up to 10^5. A high-sensitivity thermal sensor was realized in this silk\nfibroin microtoroid with sensitivity of 1.17 nm/K, 8 times higher than previous\nWGM resonator based thermal sensors. This opens the way to fabricate\nbiodegradable and biocompatible protein based microresonators on a flexible\nchip for biophotonics applications.\n", "  We have obtained multi-wavelength observations of compact Galactic planetary\nnebulae (PNe) to probe post-Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) evolution from the\nonset of nebular ejection. We analyze new observations from HST to derive the\nmasses and evolutionary status of their central stars (CSs) in order to better\nunderstand the relationship between the CS properties and those of the\nsurrounding nebulae. We also compare this sample with others we obtained using\nthe same technique in different metallicity environments: the Large and Small\nMagellanic Clouds. We work with HST/WFC3 images of 51 targets obtained in a\nsnapshot survey (GO-11657). The high spatial resolution of HST allows us to\nresolve these compact PNe and distinguish the CS emission from that of their\nsurrounding PNe. The targets were imaged through the filters F200LP, F350LP,\nand F814W from which we derive Johnson V and I magnitudes. We derive CS\nbolometric luminosities and effective temperatures using the Zanstra technique,\nfrom a combination of HST photometry and ground-based spectroscopic data. We\npresent new unique photometric measurements of 50 CSs, and derived effective\ntemperatures and luminosities for most of them. Central star masses for 23\ntargets were derived by placing the stars on a temperature-luminosity diagram\nand compare their location with the best available single star post-AGB\nevolutionary tracks, the remaining masses were indeterminate most likely\nbecause of underestimates of the stellar temperature, or because of substantial\nerrors in the adopted statistical distances to these objects. The distribution\nof CS masses in the sample of compact PNe is different than sample in the LMC\nand SMC, but with a median mass of 0.59 solar masses it is similar to other\nGalactic samples. We conclude that the compact nature of many of the PNe is a\nresult of their large distance, rather than their physical dimension.\n", "  Formation of globular clusters (GCs), the Galactic bulge, or galaxy bulges in\ngeneral, are important unsolved problems in Galactic astronomy. Homogeneous\ninfrared observations of large samples of stars belonging to GCs and the\nGalactic bulge field are one of the best ways to study these problems. We\nreport the discovery by APOGEE of a population of field stars in the inner\nGalaxy with abundances of N, C, and Al that are typically found in GC stars.\nThe newly discovered stars have high [N/Fe], which is correlated with [Al/Fe]\nand anti-correlated with [C/Fe]. They are homogeneously distributed across, and\nkinematically indistinguishable from, other field stars in the same volume.\nTheir metallicity distribution is seemingly unimodal, peaking at [Fe/H]~-1,\nthus being in disagreement with that of the Galactic GC system. Our results can\nbe understood in terms of different scenarios. N-rich stars could be former\nmembers of dissolved GCs, in which case the mass in destroyed GCs exceeds that\nof the surviving GC system by a factor of ~8. In that scenario, the total mass\ncontained in so-called \"first-generation\" stars cannot be larger than that in\n\"second-generation\" stars by more than a factor of ~9 and was certainly\nsmaller. Conversely, our results may imply the absence of a mandatory genetic\nlink between \"second generation\" stars and GCs. Last, but not least, N-rich\nstars could be the oldest stars in the Galaxy, the by-products of chemical\nenrichment by the first stellar generations formed in the heart of the Galaxy.\n", "  Spin-dependent processes play a crucial role in organic electronic devices.\nSpin coherence can give rise to spin mixing due to a number of processes such\nas hyperfine coupling, and leads to a range of magnetic field effects. However,\nit is not straightforward to differentiate between pure single-carrier\nspin-dependent transport processes which control the current and therefore the\nelectroluminescence, and spin-dependent electron-hole recombination which\ndetermines the electroluminescence yield and in turn modulates the current. We\ntherefore investigate the correlation between the dynamics of spin-dependent\nelectric current and spin-dependent electroluminescence in two derivatives of\nthe conjugated polymer poly(phenylene-vinylene) using simultaneously measured\npulsed electrically detected (pEDMR) and optically detected (pODMR) magnetic\nresonance spectroscopy. This experimental approach requires careful analysis of\nthe transient response functions under optical and electrical detection. At\nroom temperature and under bipolar charge-carrier injection conditions, a\ncorrelation of the pEDMR and the pODMR signals is observed, consistent with the\nhypothesis that the recombination currents involve spin-dependent electronic\ntransitions. This observation is inconsistent with the hypothesis that these\nsignals are caused by spin-dependent charge carrier transport. These results\ntherefore provide no evidence that supports earlier claims that spindependent\ntransport plays a role for room temperature magnetoresistance effects. At low\ntemperatures, however, the correlation between pEDMR and pODMR is weakened,\ndemonstrating that more than one spin-dependent process influences the\noptoelectronic materials properties.\n", "  We report the achievement of spatial confinement of muonium atoms (the bound\nstate of a positive muon and an electron). Muonium emitted into vacuum from\nmesoporous silica reflects between two SiO$_2$ confining surfaces separated by\n1 mm. From the data, one can extract that the reflection probability on the\nconfining surfaces kept at 100 K is about 90% and the reflection process is\nwell described by a cosine law. This technique enables new experiments with\nthis exotic atomic system and is a very important step towards a measurement of\nthe 1S-2S transition frequency using continuous wave laser spectroscopy.\n", "  The closest ever fly-by of the Martian moon Phobos, performed by the European\nSpace Agency's Mars Express spacecraft, gives a unique opportunity to sharpen\nand test the Planetary Radio Interferometry and Doppler Experiments (PRIDE)\ntechnique in the interest of studying planet - satellite systems. The aim of\nthis work is to demonstrate a technique of providing high precision positional\nand Doppler measurements of planetary spacecraft using the Mars Express\nspacecraft. The technique will be used in the framework of Planetary Radio\nInterferometry and Doppler Experiments in various planetary missions, in\nparticular in fly-by mode. We advanced a novel approach to spacecraft data\nprocessing using the techniques of Doppler and phase-referenced very long\nbaseline interferometry spacecraft tracking. We achieved, on average, mHz\nprecision (30 {\\mu}m/s at a 10 seconds integration time) for radial three-way\nDoppler estimates and sub-nanoradian precision for lateral position\nmeasurements, which in a linear measure (at a distance of 1.4 AU) corresponds\nto ~50 m.\n", "  Spicules of the so-called type II were suggested to be relevant for coronal\nheating because of their ubiquity on the solar surface and their eventual\nextension into the corona. We investigate whether solar spicules are heated to\ntransition-region or coronal temperatures and reach coronal heights (>6 Mm)\nusing multi-wavelength observations of limb spicules in different chromospheric\nspectral lines (Ca II H, Hepsilon, Halpha, Ca II IR at 854.2 nm, He I at 1083\nnm). We determine the line width of individual spicules and throughout the\nfield of view and estimate the maximal height that different types of off-limb\nfeatures reach. We derive estimates of the kinetic temperature and the\nnon-thermal velocity from the line width of spectral lines from different\nchemical elements. We find that most regular spicules reach a maximal height of\nabout 6 Mm above the solar limb. The majority of features found at larger\nheights are irregularly shaped with a significantly larger lateral extension\nthan spicules. Both individual and average line profiles in all spectral lines\nshow a decrease in their line width with height above the limb with very few\nexceptions. Both the kinetic temperature and the non-thermal velocity decrease\nwith height above the limb. We find no indications that the spicules in our\ndata reach coronal heights or transition-region or coronal temperatures.\n", "  Background: Recent high-precision measurements of alpha-induced reaction data\nbelow the Coulomb barrier have pointed out questions of the alpha-particle\noptical-model potential (OMP) which are yet open within various mass ranges.\nPurpose: The applicability of a previous optical potential and eventual\nuncertainties and/or systematic errors of the OMP assessment at low energies\ncan be further considered on this basis. Method: Nuclear model parameters based\non the analysis of recent independent data, particularly gamma-ray strength\nfunctions, have been involved within statistical model calculation of the\n(alpha,x) reaction cross sections. Results: The above-mentioned potential\nprovides a consistent description of the recent alpha-induced reaction data\nwith no empirical rescaling factors of the and/or nucleon widths. Conclusions:\nA suitable assessment of alpha-particle optical potential below the Coulomb\nbarrier should involve the statistical-model parameters beyond this potential\non the basis of a former analysis of independent data.\n", "  Using the non-abelian DBI action we find an effective matrix model that\ndescribes the dynamics of weakly interacting giant gravitons wrapped on\nthree-spheres in the AdS part of AdS_5 x S^5 at high energies with two angular\nmomenta on the S^5. In parallel we consider the limit of \\CN=4 super Yang-Mills\ntheory near a certain unitarity bound where it reduces to the quantum\nmechanical theory called SU(2) Spin Matrix Theory. We show that the exact same\nmatrix model that describes the giant gravitons on the string theory side also\nprovides the effective description in the strong coupling and large energy\nlimit of the Spin Matrix Theory. Thus, we are able to match non-supersymmetric\ndynamics of D-branes on AdS_5 x S^5 to a finite-N regime in \\CN=4 super\nYang-Mills theory near a unitarity bound.\n", "  Josephson junctions are the most prominent nondissipative and at the same\ntime nonlinear elements in superconducting circuits allowing Cooper pairs to\ntunnel coherently between two superconductors separated by a tunneling barrier.\nDue to this, physical systems involving Josephson junctions show highly complex\nbehavior and interesting novel phenomena. Here, we consider an infinite\none-dimensional chain of superconducting islands where neighboring islands are\ncoupled by capacitances. We study the effect of Josephson junctions shunting\neach island to a common ground superconductor. We treat the system in the\nregime where the Josephson energy exceeds the capacitive coupling between the\nislands. For the case of two offset charges on two distinct islands, we\ncalculate the interaction energy of these charges mediated by quantum phase\nslips due to the Josephson nonlinearities. We treat the phase slips in an\ninstanton approximation and map the problem onto a classical partition function\nof interacting particles. Using the Mayer cluster expansion, we find that the\ninteraction potential of the offset charges decays with an universal\ninverse-square power law behavior.\n", "  We calculate the radial profiles of galaxies where the nuclear region is\nself-gravitating, consisting of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) with $F$\ndegrees of freedom. For sufficiently high density this dark matter becomes\ncollisional, regardless of its behaviour on galaxy scales. Our calculations\nshow a spike in the central density profile, with properties determined by the\ndark matter microphysics, and the densities can reach the `mean density' of a\nblack hole (from dividing the black-hole mass by the volume enclosed by the\nSchwarzschild radius). For a galaxy halo of given compactness\n($\\chi=2GM/Rc^2$), certain values for the dark matter entropy yield a dense\ncentral object lacking an event horizon. For some soft equations of state of\nthe SIDM (e.g. $F\\ge6$), there are multiple horizonless solutions at given\ncompactness. Although light propagates around and through a sphere composed of\ndark matter, it is gravitationally lensed and redshifted. While some\ncalculations give non-singular solutions, others yield solutions with a central\nsingularity. In all cases the density transitions smoothly from the central\nbody to the dark-matter envelope around it, and to the galaxy's dark matter\nhalo. We propose that pulsar timing observations will be able to distinguish\nbetween systems with a centrally dense dark matter sphere (for different\nequations of state) and conventional galactic nuclei that harbour a\nsupermassive black hole.\n", "  Galaxies arrive on the red sequences of clusters at high redshift ($z>1$)\nonce their star formation is quenched and evolve passively thereafter. However,\nwe have previously found that cluster red sequence galaxies (CRSGs) undergo\nsignificant morphological evolution subsequent to the cessation of star\nformation, at some point in the past 9-10~Gyr. Through a detailed study of a\nlarge sample of cluster red sequence galaxies spanning $0.2<z<1.4$ we elucidate\nthe details of this evolution. Below $z \\sim 0.5-0.6$ (in the last 5-6 Gyr)\nthere is little or no morphological evolution in the population as a whole,\nunlike in the previous 4-5 Gyrs. Over this earlier time (i) disk-like systems\nwith S{\\'e}rsic $n < 2$ progressively disappear, as (ii) the range of their\naxial ratios similarly decreases, removing the most elongated systems (those\nconsistent with thin disks seen at an appreciable inclination angle), and (iii)\nradial colour gradients (bluer outwards) decrease in an absolute sense from\nsignificant age-related gradients to a residual level consistent with the\nmetallicity-induced gradients seen in low redshift cluster members. The\ndistribution of their effective radii shows some evidence of evolution,\nconsistent with growth of {\\it at most} a factor $<1.5$ between $z\\sim 1.4$ and\n$z \\sim 0.5$, significantly less than for comparable field galaxies, while the\ndistribution of their central ($<1$kpc) bulge surface densities shows no\nevolution at least at $z<1$. A simple model involving the fading and thickening\nof a disk component after comparatively recent quenching (after $z\\sim 1.5$)\naround an otherwise passively evolving older spheroid component is consistent\nwith all of these findings.\n", "  The presence or absence of ice in protoplanetary disks is of great importance\nfor the formation of planets. By enhancing the solid surface density and\nincreasing the sticking efficiency, ice catalyzes the rapid formation of\nplanetesimals and decreases the time scale for giant planet core accretion.\nAims: In this paper we analyse the composition of the outer disk around the\nHerbig star HD~142527. We focus on the composition of the water ice, but also\nanalyse the abundances of previously proposed minerals. Methods: We present new\nHerschel far infrared spectra and a re-reduction of archival data from the\nInfrared Space Observatory (ISO). We model the disk using full 3D radiative\ntransfer to obtain the disk structure. Also, we use an optically thin analysis\nof the outer disk spectrum to obtain firm constraints on the composition of the\ndust component. Results: The water ice in the disk around HD~142527 contains a\nlarge reservoir of crystalline water ice. We determine the local abundance of\nwater ice in the outer disk (i.e. beyond 130\\,AU). The re-reduced ISO spectrum\ndiffers significantly from that previously published, but matches the new\nHerschel spectrum at their common wavelength range. In particular, we do not\ndetect any significant contribution from carbonates or hydrous silicates, in\ncontrast to earlier claims. Conclusions: The amount of water ice detected in\nthe outer disk requires $\\sim80\\,$\\% of the oxygen atoms. This is comparable to\nthe water ice abundance in the outer solar system, in comets and in dense\ninterstellar clouds. The water ice is highly crystalline while the temperatures\nwhere we detect it are too low to crystallize the water on relevant time\nscales. We discuss the implications of this finding.\n", "  Powerful flares from blazars with short ($\\sim$ min) variability timescales\nare challenging for current models of blazar emission. Here, we present a\nphysically motivated ab initio model for blazar flares based on the results of\nrecent particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of relativistic magnetic\nreconnection. PIC simulations demonstrate that quasi-spherical plasmoids filled\nwith high-energy particles and magnetic fields are a self-consistent by-product\nof the reconnection process. By coupling our PIC-based results (i.e., plasmoid\ngrowth, acceleration profile, particle and magnetic content) with a kinetic\nequation for the evolution of the electron distribution function we demonstrate\nthat relativistic reconnection in blazar jets can produce powerful flares whose\ntemporal and spectral properties are consistent with the observations. In\nparticular, our model predicts correlated synchrotron and synchrotron\nself-Compton flares of duration of several hours--days powered by the largest\nand slowest moving plasmoids that form in the reconnection layer. Smaller and\nfaster plasmoids produce flares of sub-hour duration with higher peak\nluminosities than those powered by the largest plasmoids. Yet, the observed\nfluence in both types of flares is similar. Multiple flares with a range of\nflux-doubling timescales (minutes to several hours) observed over a longer\nperiod of flaring activity (days or longer) may be used as a probe of the\nreconnection layer's orientation and the jet's magnetization. Our model shows\nthat blazar flares are naturally expected as a result of magnetic reconnection\nin a magnetically-dominated jet.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the quality of constraining the spin of the\nmassive black hole (MBH) at the Galactic center (GC) by using full general\nrelativistic simulations of the motion of a surrounding star. We obtain the\ndependence mapping of the spin-induced signals on any spin direction of the MBH\nfor given example stars, which indicates the feasibility to test whether the\nspin direction is the same as the normal of the young stellar disk located at\nthe GC, and, further to provide insights into the assembly history of the MBH.\nWe demonstrate the quality of constraining the MBH spin that may be achieved,\ngiven any set of the astrometric and the redshift precisions of observational\nfacilities. We find that in the ranges of the astrometric and the velocity\nprecisions with 1--30$\\mu$as and 0.1--10 km/s, an improvement in astrometric\nprecision would be more effective at improving the quality of constraining the\nspin than an improvement in velocity precision. We obtain the parameter space\nof the semimajor axis and the eccentricity for the orbit of the target star\nthat a high-precision constraint on the GC MBH spin can be obtained via the\nmotion of the star. Our results show that the spin of the GC MBH can be\nconstrained with 1-sigma error <~0.1 or even >~0.02 by monitoring the orbital\nmotion of a star, if existing as expected, with semimajor axis <~300AU and\neccentricity >~0.95 over a period shorter than a decade through future\nfacilities.\n", "  Short version: We apply a new synergetic radiative transfer method: the\nderived 1D density profiles are both consistent with a cut through the Herschel\nPACS/SPIRE and JCMT SCUBA-2 continuum maps of L1689B and with a derived local\ninterstellar radiation field. Choosing an appropriate cut along the filament\nmajor axis, we minimize the impact of the filament emission on the modeling.\nFor the bulk of the core (5000-20000 au) an isothermal sphere model with a\ntemperature of around 10 K provides the best fits. We show that the power law\nindex of the density profile, as well as the constant temperature can be\nderived directly from the radial surface brightness profiles. For the inner\nregion (< 5000 au), we find a range of densities and temperatures that are\nconsistent with the surface brightness profiles and the local interstellar\nradiation field. Based on our core models, we find that pixel-by-pixel single\ntemperature spectral energy distribution fits are incapable of determining\ndense core properties. We conclude that, to derive physical core properties, it\nis important to avoid an azimuthal average of core and filament.\nCorrespondingly, derived core masses are too high since they include some mass\nof the filament, and might introduce errors when determining core mass\nfunctions. The forward radiative transfer methods also avoids the loss of\ninformation owing to smearing of all maps to the coarsest spatial resolution.\nWe find the central core region to be colder and denser than estimated in\nrecent inverse radiative transfer modeling, possibly indicating the start of\nstar formation in L1689B.\n", "  Based on the XMM-Newton large program on SN1006 and our newly developed\nspatially resolved spectroscopy tools (Paper~I), we study the thermal emission\nfrom ISM and ejecta of SN1006 by analyzing the spectra extracted from 583\ntessellated regions dominated by thermal emission. With some key improvements\nin spectral analysis as compared to Paper~I, we obtain much better spectral\nfitting results with less residuals. The spatial distributions of the thermal\nand ionization states of the ISM and ejecta show different features, which are\nconsistent with a scenario that the ISM (ejecta) is heated and ionized by the\nforward (reverse) shock propagating outward (inward). Different elements have\ndifferent spatial distributions and origins, with Ne mostly from the ISM, Si\nand S from the ejecta, and O and Mg from both ISM and ejecta. Fe L-shell lines\nare only detected in a small shell-like region SE to the center of SN1006,\nindicating that most of the Fe-rich ejecta has not yet or just recently been\nreached by the reverse shock. The overall ejecta abundance patterns for most of\nthe heavy elements, except for Fe and sometimes S, are consistent with typical\nType~Ia SN products. The NW half of the SNR interior probably represents a\nregion with turbulently mixed ISM and ejecta, so has enhanced emission from O,\nMg, Si, S, lower ejecta temperature, and a large diversity of ionization age.\nIn addition to the asymmetric ISM distribution, an asymmetric explosion of the\nprogenitor star is also needed to explain the asymmetric ejecta distribution.\n", "  Here we propose a realistic $\\mathrm{SU(3)_c \\otimes SU(3)_L \\otimes U(1)_X}$\nelectroweak gauge model with enlarged Higgs sector. The scheme allows for the\nnatural implementation of a type II seesaw mechanism for Dirac neutrinos, while\ncharged lepton and quark masses are reproduced in a natural way thanks to the\npresence of new scalars. The new $\\mathrm{SU(3)_c \\otimes SU(3)_L \\otimes\nU(1)_X}$ energy scale characterizing neutrino mass generation could be\naccessible to the current LHC experiments.\n", "  We show that the horizon instability of the extremal Kerr black hole is\nassociated with a singular branch point in the Green function at the\nsuperradiant bound frequency. We study generic initial data supported away from\nthe horizon and find an enhanced growth rate due to nonaxisymmetric modes. The\ngrowth is controlled by the conformal weight of each mode. We speculate on\nconnections to near-extremal black holes and holographic duality.\n", "  We report a possible detection of a 55-day X-ray modulation for the\nultraluminous accreting pulsar M82 X-2 from archival Chandra observations.\nBecause M82 X-2 is known to have a 2.5-day orbital period, if the 55-day period\nis real, it will be the superorbital period of the system. We also investigated\nvariabilities of other three nearby ultraluminous X-ray sources in the central\nregion of M82 with the Chandra data and did not find any evidence of\nperiodicities. Furthermore, we re-examined the previously reported 62-day\nperiodicity near the central region of M82 by performing a systematic timing\nstudy with all the archival Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer and Swift data. Using\nvarious dynamic timing analysis methods, we confirmed that the 62-day period is\nnot stable, suggesting that it is not the orbital period of M82 X-1 in\nagreement with previous work.\n", "  We model the time evolution of gaps in tidal streams caused by the impact of\na dark matter subhalo, while both orbit a spherical gravitational potential. To\nthis end, we make use of the simple behaviour of orbits in action-angle space.\nA gap effectively results from the divergence of two nearby orbits whose\ninitial phase-space separation is, for very cold thin streams, largely given by\nthe impulse induced by the subhalo. We find that in a spherical potential the\nsize of a gap increases linearly with time for sufficiently long timescales. We\nhave derived an analytic expression that shows how the growth rate depends on\nthe mass of the perturbing subhalo, its scale and its relative velocity with\nrespect to the stream. We have verified these scalings using N-body simulations\nand find excellent agreement. For example, a subhalo of mass 10^8 Msun directly\nimpacting a very cold thin stream on an inclined orbit can induce a gap that\nmay reach a size of several tens of kpc after a few Gyr. The gap size\nfluctuates importantly with phase on the orbit, and it is largest close to\npericentre. This indicates that it may not be fully straightforward to invert\nthe spectrum of gaps present in a stream to recover the mass spectrum of the\nsubhalos.\n", "  We present the JCMT Gould Belt Survey's first look results of the southern\nextent of the Orion A Molecular Cloud ($\\delta \\leq\n-5\\mathrm{:}31\\mathrm{:}27.5$). Employing a two-step structure identification\nprocess, we construct individual catalogues for large-scale regions of\nsignificant emission labelled as islands and smaller-scale subregions called\nfragments using the 850 $\\mu$m continuum maps obtained using SCUBA-2. We\ncalculate object masses, sizes, column densities, and concentrations. We\ndiscuss fragmentation in terms of a Jeans instability analysis and highlight\ninteresting structures as candidates for follow-up studies. Furthermore, we\nassociate the detected emission with young stellar objects (YSOs) identified by\nSpitzer and Herschel. We find that although the population of active\nstar-forming regions contains a wide variety of sizes and morphologies, there\nis a strong positive correlation between the concentration of an emission\nregion and its calculated Jeans instability. There are, however, a number of\nhighly unstable subregions in dense areas of the map that show no evidence of\nstar formation. We find that only $\\sim$72\\% of the YSOs defined as Class 0+I\nand flat-spectrum protostars coincide with dense 850 $\\mu$m emission structures\n(column densities $>3.7\\times10^{21}\\mathrm{\\:cm}^{-2}$). The remaining 28\\% of\nthese objects, which are expected to be embedded in dust and gas, may be\nmisclassified. Finally, we suggest that there is an evolution in the velocity\ndispersion of young stellar objects such that sources which are more evolved\nare associated with higher velocities.\n", "  We use the Balmer decrements of the broad-line regions (BLRs) and narrow-line\nregions (NLRs) of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) as reddening indicators to\ninvestigate the location of the dust for four samples of AGNs with reliable\nestimates of the NLR contribution to the Balmer lines. Intercomparison of the\nNLR and BLR Balmer decrements indicates that the reddening of the NLR sets a\nlower limit to the reddening of the BLR. Almost no objects have high NLR\nreddening but low BLR reddening. The reddening of the BLR is often\nsubstantially greater than the reddening of the NLR. The BLR reddening is\ncorrelated with the equivalent widths of [O III] lines and the intensity of the\n[O III] lines relative to broad H\\beta. We find these relationships to be\nconsistent with the predictions of a simple model where the additional dust\nreddening the BLR is interior to the NLR. We thus conclude that the dust\ncausing the additional reddening of the accretion disc and BLR is mostly\nlocated at a smaller radius than the NLR.\n", "  A pseudo-magnetic field kink can be realized along a graphene nanoribbon\nusing strain engineering. Electron transport along this kink is governed by\nsnake states that are characterized by a single propagation direction. Those\npseudo-magnetic fields point towards opposite directions in the K and K'\nvalleys, leading to valley polarized snake states. In a graphene nanoribbon\nwith armchair edges this effect results in a valley filter that is based only\non strain engineering. We discuss how to maximize this valley filtering by\nadjusting the parameters that define the stress distribution along the graphene\nribbon.\n", "  We study the physical mechanism of a major X-class solar flare that occurred\nin the super NOAA active region (AR) 12192 using a data-driven numerical\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modeling complemented with observations. With the\nevolving magnetic fields observed at the solar surface as bottom boundary\ninput, we drive an MHD system to evolve self-consistently in correspondence\nwith the realistic coronal evolution. During a two-day time interval, the\nmodeled coronal field has been slowly stressed by the photospheric field\nevolution,which gradually created a large-scale coronal current sheet, i.e., a\nnarrow layer with intense current, in the core of the AR. The current layer was\nsuccessively enhanced until it became so thin that a tether-cutting\nreconnection between the sheared magnetic arcades was set in, which led to a\nflare. The modeled reconnecting field lines and their footpoints match well the\nobserved hot flaring loops and the flare ribbons, respectively, suggesting that\nthe model has successfully \"reproduced\" the macroscopic magnetic process of the\nflare. In particular, with simulation, we explained why this event is a\nconfined eruption-the consequent of the reconnection is the shared arcade\ninstead of a newly formed flux rope. We also found much weaker magnetic\nimplosion effect comparing to many other X-class flares\n", "  We present a combined analysis of the observations of the gravitational\nmicrolensing event OGLE-2015-BLG-0479 taken both from the ground and by the\n{\\it Spitzer Space Telescope}. The light curves seen from the ground and from\nspace exhibit a time offset of $\\sim 13$ days between the caustic spikes,\nindicating that the relative lens-source positions seen from the two places are\ndisplaced by parallax effects. From modeling the light curves, we measure the\nspace-based microlens parallax. Combined with the angular Einstein radius\nmeasured by analyzing the caustic crossings, we determine the mass and distance\nof the lens. We find that the lens is a binary composed of two G-type stars\nwith masses $\\sim 1.0\\ M_\\odot$ and $\\sim 0.9\\ M_\\odot$ located at a distance\n$\\sim 3$ kpc. In addition, we are able to constrain the complete orbital\nparameters of the lens thanks to the precise measurement of the microlens\nparallax derived from the joint analysis. In contrast to the binary event\nOGLE-2014-BLG-1050, which was also observed by {\\it Spitzer}, we find that the\ninterpretation of OGLE-2015-BLG-0479 does not suffer from the degeneracy\nbetween $(\\pm,\\pm)$ and $(\\pm,\\mp)$ solutions, confirming that the four-fold\nparallax degeneracy in single-lens events collapses into the two-fold\ndegeneracy for the general case of binary-lens events. The location of the\nblend in the color-magnitude diagram is consistent with the lens properties,\nsuggesting that the blend is the lens itself. The blend is bright enough for\nspectroscopy and thus this possibility can be checked from future follow-up\nobservations.\n", "  G 207-9 and LP 133-144 are two rarely observed ZZ Ceti stars located in the\nmiddle and close to the blue edge of the ZZ Ceti instability domain,\nrespectively. We aimed to observe them at least during one observing season at\nKonkoly Observatory with the purpose of extending the list of known pulsation\nmodes for asteroseismic investigations and detect any significant changes in\ntheir pulsational behaviour. We determined five and three new normal modes of G\n207-9 and LP 133-144, respectively. In LP 133-144, our frequency analysis also\nrevealed that at least at three modes there are actually triplets with\nfrequency separations of ~4 microHz. The rotational period of LP 133-144 based\non the triplets is ~42 h. The preliminary asteroseismic fits of G 207-9 predict\nTeff=12 000 or 12 400 K and M*=0.855-0.870 MSun values for the effective\ntemperature and mass of the star, depending on the assumptions on the spherical\ndegree (l) values of the modes. These results are in agreement with the\nspectroscopic determinations. In the case of LP 133-144, the best-fitting\nmodels prefer Teff=11 800 K in effective temperature and M*>=0.71 MSun stellar\nmasses, which are more than 0.1 MSun larger than the spectroscopic value.\n", "  A population of quasars at z ~ 2 is determined based on dust luminosities\nvLv(7.8 um) that includes unobscured, partially obscured, and obscured quasars.\nQuasars are classified by the ratio vLv(0.25 um)/vLv(7.8 um) = UV/IR, assumed\nto measure obscuration of UV luminosity by the dust which produces IR\nluminosity. Quasar counts at rest frame 7.8 um are determined for quasars in\nthe Bootes field of the NOAO Deep Wide Field Survey using 24 um sources with\noptical redshifts from the AGN and Galaxy Evolution Survey (AGES) or infrared\nredshifts from the Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph. Spectral energy distributions\nare extended to far infrared wavelengths using observations from the Herschel\nSpace Observatory Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE), and new\nSPIRE photometry is presented for 77 high redshift quasars from the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey. It is found that unobscured and obscured quasars have\nsimilar space densities at rest frame 7.8 um, but the ratio Lv(100 um)/Lv(7.8\num) is about three times higher for obscured quasars compared to unobscured, so\nthat far infrared or submm discoveries are dominated by obscured quasars.\nQuasar source counts for these samples are determined for comparison to the\nnumber of submm sources that have been discovered with the SCUBA-2 camera at z\n~ 2 using the Lv(100 um)/Lv(7.8 um) results together with the Bootes 7.8 um\ncounts, and we find that only ~ 5% of high redshift submm sources are quasars,\nincluding even the most obscured quasars. Illustrative source counts are\npredicted to z = 10, and we show that existing SCUBA-2 850 um surveys or 2 mm\nsurveys with the Goddard-IRAM Superconducting 2 Millimeter Observer (GISMO)\nsurvey camera should already have detected sources at z ~ 10 if quasar and\nstarburst luminosity functions remain the same from z = 2 until z = 10.\n", "  We report on interferometric observations with the CHARA Array of two\nclassical Wolf-Rayet stars in suspected binary systems, namely WR 137 and WR\n138. In both cases, we resolve the component stars to be separated by a few\nmilliarcseconds. The data were collected in the H-band, and provide a measure\nof the fractional flux for both stars in each system. We find that the WR star\nis the dominant H-band light source in both systems ($f_{\\rm WR, 137} =\n0.59\\pm0.04$; $f_{\\rm WR, 138} = 0.67\\pm0.01$), which is confirmed through both\ncomparisons with estimated fundamental parameters for WR stars and O dwarfs, as\nwell as through spectral modeling of each system. Our spectral modeling also\nprovides fundamental parameters for the stars and winds in these systems. The\nresults on WR 138 provide evidence that it is a binary system which may have\ngone through a previous mass-transfer episode to create the WR star. The\nseparation and position of the stars in the WR 137 system together with\nprevious results from the IOTA interferometer provides evidence that the binary\nis seen nearly edge-on. The possible edge-on orbit of WR 137 aligns well with\nthe dust production site imaged by the Hubble Space Telescope during a previous\nperiastron passage, showing that the dust production may be concentrated in the\norbital plane.\n", "  We have derived the abundances of 36 chemical elements in one Cepheid star,\nASAS 181024--2049.6, located R$_{\\rm G}= 2.53$ kpc from the Galactic center.\nThis star falls within a region of the inner thin disc poorly sampled in\nCepheids. Our spectral analysis shows that iron, magnesium, silicon, calcium\nand titanium LTE abundances in that star support the presence of a plateau-like\nabundance distribution in the thin disc within 5 kpc of the Galactic center, as\npreviously suggested by \\cite{Maret15}. If confirmed, the flattening of the\nabundance gradient within that region could be the result of a decrease in the\nstar formation rate due to dynamic effects, possibly from the central Galactic\nbar.\n", "  We have derived elemental abundances of a remarkable star, HD 179821, with\nunusual composition (e.g. [Na/Fe]=1.0$\\pm$0.2 dex) and extra-ordinary spectral\ncharacteristics. Its metallicity at [Fe/H]=0.4 dex places it among the most\nmetal-rich stars yet analyzed. The abundance analysis of this luminous star is\nbased on high resolution and high quality (S/N$\\approx$120--420) optical\nechelle spectra from McDonald Observatory and Special Astronomy Observatory.\nThe data includes five years of observations over twenty-one epochs. Standard\n1D {\\sc LTE} analysis provides a fresh determination of the atmospheric\nparameters over all epochs: \\Teff = 7350$\\pm$200 \\kelvin, \\logg = +0.6$\\pm$0.3,\nand a microturbulent velocity $\\xi =$ 6.6$\\pm$1.6 km s$^{\\rm -1}$ and [Fe/H] =\n0.4$\\pm$0.2, and a carbon abundance [C/Fe]= $-$0.19$\\pm$0.30. We find oxygen\nabundance [O/Fe]= $-$0.25$\\pm$0.28 and an enhancement of 0.9 dex in N. A\nsupersonic macroturbulent velocity of 22.0 $\\pm$ 2.0 km s$^{\\rm -1}$ is\ndetermined from both strong and weak Fe\\,{\\sc i} and Fe\\,{\\sc ii} lines.\nElemental abundances are obtained for 22 elements. HD 179821 is not enriched in\ns-process products. Eu is overabundant relative to the anticipated [X/Fe]\n$\\approx$ 0.0. Some peculiarities of its optical spectrum (e.g. variability in\nthe spectral line shapes) is noticed. This includes the line profile variations\nfor H$\\alpha$ line. Based on its estimated luminosity, effective temperature\nand surface gravity, HD 179821 is a massive star evolving to become a red\nsupergiant and finally a Type II supernova.\n", "  The origin of ultra high energy cosmic rays (UHECR) is still unknown.\nHowever, great progress has been achieved in past years due to the good quality\nand large statistics in experimental data collected by the current\nobservatories. The data of the Pierre Auger Observatory show that the\ncomposition of the UHECRs becomes progressively lighter starting from $10^{17}$\neV up to $\\sim 10^{18.3}$ eV and then, beyond that energy, it becomes\nincreasingly heavier. These analyses are subject to important systematic\nuncertainties due to the use of hadronic interaction models that extrapolate\nlower energy accelerator data to the highest energies. Although proton models\nof UHECRs are disfavored by these results, they cannot be completely ruled out.\nIt is well known that the energy spectra of gamma rays and neutrinos, produced\nduring propagation of these very energetic particles through the intergalactic\nmedium, are a useful tool to constrain the spectrum models. In particular, it\nhas recently been shown that the neutrino upper limits obtained by IceCube\nchallenge the proton models at 95% CL. In this work we study the constraints\nimposed by the extragalactic gamma-ray background, measured by Fermi-LAT, on\nproton models of UHECRs. In particular, we make use of the extragalactic\ngamma-ray background flux, integrated from 50 GeV to 2 TeV, that originates in\npoint sources, which has recently been obtained by the Fermi-LAT collaboration,\nin combination with the neutrino upper limits, to constrain the emission of\nUHECRs at high redshits ($z>1$), in the context of the proton models.\n", "  For sufficiently wide orbital separations {\\it a}, the two members of a\nstellar binary evolve independently. This implies that in a wide double white\ndwarf (DWD), the more massive WD should always be produced first, when its more\nmassive progenitor ends its main-sequence life, and should therefore be older\nand cooler than its companion. The bound, wide DWD HS 2220$+$2146\n($a\\approx500$ AU) does not conform to this picture: the more massive WD is the\nyounger, hotter of the pair. We show that this discrepancy is unlikely to be\ndue to past mass-transfer phases or to the presence of an unresolved companion.\nInstead, we propose that HS 2220$+$2146 formed through a new wide DWD\nevolutionary channel involving the merger of the inner binary in a hierarchical\ntriple system. The resulting blue straggler and its wide companion then evolved\nindependently, forming the WD pair seen today. Although we cannot rule out\nother scenarios, the most likely formation channel has the inner binary merging\nwhile both stars are still on the main sequence. This provides us with the\ntantalizing possibility that Kozai-Lidov oscillations may have played a role in\nthe inner binary's merger. {\\it Gaia} may uncover hundreds more wide DWDs,\nleading to the identification of other systems like HS 2220$+$2146. There are\nalready indications that other WD systems may have been formed through\ndifferent, but related, hierarchical triple evolutionary scenarios.\nCharacterizing these populations may allow for thorough testing of the\nefficiency with which KL oscillations induce stellar mergers.\n", "  High-energy cosmic rays can be accelerated in clusters of galaxies, by\nmega-parsec scale shocks induced by accretion of gas during the formation of\nlarge-scale structure, or by powerful sources harbored in clusters. Once\naccelerated, the highest energy particles leave the cluster via almost\nrectilinear trajectories, while lower energy ones can be confined by the\ncluster magnetic field up to cosmological time and interact with the\nintracluster gas. Using a realistic model of the baryon distribution and the\nturbulent magnetic field in clusters, we studied the propagation and hadronic\ninteraction of high-energy protons in the intracluster medium. We report the\ncumulative cosmic ray and neutrino spectra generated by galaxy clusters\nincluding embedded sources, and demonstrate that clusters can contribute a\nsignificant fraction of the observed IceCube neutrinos above 30 TeV while\nremaining undetected in high-energy cosmic rays and $\\gamma$ rays for\nreasonable choices of parameters and source scenarios.\n", "  We present radiation transfer models of rotating young stellar objects (YSOs)\nwith hotspots in their atmospheres, inner disk warps and other 3-D effects in\nthe nearby circumstellar environment. Our models are based on the geometry\nexpected from the magneto-accretion theory, where material moving inward in the\ndisk flows along magnetic field lines to the star and creates stellar hotspots\nupon impact. Due to rotation of the star and magnetosphere, the disk is\nvariably illuminated. We compare our model light curves to data from the\nSpitzer YSOVAR project (Morales-Calderon et al. 2014, Cody et al. 2014) to\ndetermine if these processes can explain the variability observed at optical\nand mid-infrared wavelengths in young stars. We focus on those variables\nexhibiting \"dipper\" behavior that may be periodic, quasi-periodic, or\naperiodic. We find that the stellar hotspot size and temperature affects the\noptical and near-infrared light curves, while the shape and vertical extent of\nthe inner disk warp affects the mid-IR light curve variations. Clumpy disk\ndistributions with non-uniform fractal density structure produce more\nstochastic light curves. We conclude that the magneto-accretion theory is\nconsistent with certain aspects of the multi-wavelength photometric variability\nexhibited by low-mass YSOs. More detailed modeling of individual sources can be\nused to better determine the stellar hotspot and inner disk geometries of\nparticular sources.\n", "  IRAS 19312+1950 is a peculiar object that has eluded firm characterization\nsince its discovery, with combined maser properties similar to an evolved star\nand a young stellar object (YSO). To help determine its true nature, we\nobtained infrared spectra of IRAS 19312+1950 in the range 5-550 $\\mu$m using\nthe Herschel and Spitzer space observatories. The Herschel PACS maps exhibit a\ncompact, slightly asymmetric continuum source at 170 $\\mu$m, indicative of a\nlarge, dusty circumstellar envelope. The far-IR CO emission line spectrum\nreveals two gas temperature components: $\\approx0.22M_{\\odot}$ of material at\n$280\\pm18$ K, and $\\approx1.6M_{\\odot}$ of material at $157\\pm3$ K. The OI 63\n$\\mu$m line is detected on-source but no significant emission from atomic ions\nwas found. The HIFI observations display shocked, high-velocity gas with\noutflow speeds up to 90 km s$^{-1}$ along the line of sight. From Spitzer\nspectroscopy, we identify ice absorption bands due to H$_2$O at 5.8 $\\mu$m and\nCO$_2$ at 15 $\\mu$m. The spectral energy distribution is consistent with a\nmassive, luminous ($\\sim2\\times10^4L_{\\odot}$) central source surrounded by a\ndense, warm circumstellar disk and envelope of total mass\n$\\sim500$-$700M_{\\odot}$, with large bipolar outflow cavities. The combination\nof distinctive far-IR spectral features suggest that IRAS 19312+1950 should be\nclassified as an accreting high-mass YSO rather than an evolved star. In light\nof this reclassification, IRAS 19312+1950 becomes only the 5th high-mass\nprotostar known to exhibit SiO maser activity, and demonstrates that 18 cm OH\nmaser line ratios may not be reliable observational discriminators between\nevolved stars and YSOs.\n", "  Making use of a new N-body model to describe the evolution of a moderate-size\nglobular cluster we investigate the characteristics of the population of black\nholes within such a cluster. This model reaches core-collapse and achieves a\npeak central density typical of the dense globular clusters of the Milky Way.\nWithin this high-density environment we see direct confirmation of the merging\nof two stellar remnant black-holes in a dynamically-formed binary, a\ngravitational wave source. We describe how the formation, evolution and\nultimate ejection/destruction of binary systems containing black holes impacts\nthe evolution of the cluster core. Also, through comparison with previous\nmodels of lower density, we show that the period distribution of black hole\nbinaries formed through dynamical interactions in this high-density model\nfavours the production of gravitational wave sources. We confirm that the\nnumber of black holes remaining in a star cluster at late times and the\ncharacteristics of the binary black hole population depend on the nature of the\nstar cluster, critically on the number density of stars and by extension the\nrelaxation timescale.\n", "  We present new maps of emission-line flux distributions and kinematics in\nboth ionized (traced by HI and [FeII] lines) and molecular (H2) gas of the\ninner 0.7x0.7kpc2 of the galaxy NGC4303, with a spatial resolution 40-80pc and\nvelocity resolution 90-150 km/s obtained from near-IR integral field\nspecroscopy using the VLT instrument SINFONI. The most promiment feature is a\n200-250pc ring of circum-nuclear star-forming regions. The emission from\nionized and molecular gas shows distinct flux distributions: while the\nstrongest HI and [FeII] emission comes from regions in the west side of the\nring (ages~4Myr), the H2 emission is strongest at the nucleus and in the east\nside of the ring (ages>10Myr). We find that regions of enhanced hot H2 emission\nare anti-correlated with those of enhanced [FeII] and HI emission, which can be\nattributed to post starburst regions that do not have ionizing photons anymore\nbut still are hot enough (~2000K) to excite the H2 molecule. The line ratios\nare consistent with the presence of an AGN at the nucleus.\n  The youngest regions have stellar masses in the range 0.3-1.5E5 MSun and\nionized and hot molecular gas masses of ~0.25-1.2E4 Msun and 2.5-5 Msun,\nrespectively. The stellar and gas velocity fields show a rotation pattern, with\nthe gas presenting larger velocity amplitudes than the stars, with a deviation\nobserved for the H2 along the nuclear bar, where increased velocity dispersion\nis also observed, possibly associated with non circular motions along the bar.\nThe stars in the ring show smaller velocity dispersion than the surroundings,\nthat can be attributed to a cooler dynamics due to their recent formation from\ncool gas.\n", "  The Narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy (NLS1) IRAS 13224$-$3809 is known to exhibit\nsignificant X-ray spectral variation, a sharp spectral drop at $\\sim$ 7 keV,\nstrong soft excess emission, and a hint of iron L-edge feature, which is very\nsimilar to the NLS1 1H 0707$-$495. We have proposed the \"Variable Double\nPartial Covering (VDPC) model\" to explain the energy spectra and spectral\nvariability of 1H 0707$-$495 (Mizumoto, Ebisawa and Sameshima 2014, PASJ, 66,\n122). In this model, the observed flux/spectral variations below 10 keV within\na $\\sim$day are primarily caused by change of the partial covering fraction of\npatchy clouds composed by double absorption layers in the line of sight. In\nthis paper, we apply the VDPC model to IRAS 13224$-$3809. Consequently, we have\nfound that the VDPC model can explain the observed spectral variations of IRAS\n13224$-$3809 in the 0.5$-$10 keV band. In particular, we can explain the\nobserved Root Mean Square (RMS) spectra (energy dependence of the fractional\nflux variation) in the entire 0.5$-$10 keV band. In addition to the well-known\nsignificant drop in the iron K-band, we have found intriguing iron L-peaks in\nthe RMS spectra when the iron L-edge is particularly deep. This feature, which\nis also found in 1H 0707$-$495, is naturally explained with the VDPC model,\nsuch that the RMS variations increase at the energies where optical depths of\nthe partial absorbers are large. The absorbers have a larger optical depth at\nthe iron L-edge than in the adjacent energy bands, thus a characteristic iron\nL-peak appears. On the other hand, just below the iron K-edge, the optical\ndepth is the lowest and the RMS spectrum has a broad dip.\n", "  We study the interaction of the early spherical GC wind powered by Type II\nsupernovae (SNe II) with the surrounding ambient medium consisting of the\ngaseous disk of a star forming galaxy at redshift z ~> 2. The bubble formed by\nthe wind eventually breaks out of the disk, and most of the wind moves directly\nout of the galaxy and is definitively lost. The fraction of the wind moving\nnearly parallel to the galactic plane carves a hole in the disk which will\ncontract after the end of the SN activity. During the interval of time between\nthe end of the SN explosions and the \"closure\" of the hole, very O-poor stars\n(the Extreme population) can form out of the super-AGB (asymptotic giant\nbranch) ejecta collected in the GC center. Once the hole contracts, the AGB\nejecta mix with the pristine gas, allowing the formation of stars with an\noxygen abundance intermediate between that of the very O-poor stars and that of\nthe pristine gas. We show that this mechanism may explain why Extreme\npopulations are present only in massive clusters, and can also produce a\ncorrelation between the spread in helium and the cluster mass. Finally, we also\nexplore the possibility that our proposed mechanism can be extended to the case\nof multiple populations showing bimodality in the iron content, with the\npresence of two populations characterized by a small difference in [Fe/H]. Such\na result can be obtained taking into account the contribution of delayed SN II.\n", "  The discovery of the baryonic states $P_c^+(4380)$ and $P_c^+(4450)$ by the\nLHCb collaboration has evoked a lot of theoretical interest. These states have\nthe minimal quark content $c \\bar{c} u u d$. Interpreted as hidden charm\ndiquark-diquark-antiquark baryons, the assigned spin and angular momentum\nquantum numbers are $P_c^+(4380)= \\{\\bar{c} [cu]_{s=1} [ud]_{s=1};\nL_{\\mathcal{P}}=0, J^{\\rm P}=\\frac{3}{2}^- \\}$ and $P_c^+(4450)= \\{\\bar{c}\n[cu]_{s=1} [ud]_{s=0}; L_{\\mathcal{P}}=1, J^{\\rm P}=\\frac{5}{2}^+ \\}$, where\n$s=0,1$ are the spins of the diquarks and $L_{\\mathcal{P}}=0,1$ are the orbital\nangular momentum quantum numbers of the pentaquarks. We point out that heavy\nquark symmetry allows only the higher mass pentaquark state $P_c^+(4450)$\nhaving $[ud]_{s=0}$ to be produced in $\\Lambda_b^0$ decays, whereas the lower\nmass state $P_c^+(4380)$ having $[ud]_{s=1}$ is disfavored. Pentaquark spectrum\nis rich enough to accommodate a $J^P=\\frac{3}{2}^-$ state, which has the\ncorrect light diquark spin $\\{\\bar{c} [cu]_{s=1} [ud]_{s=0}; L_{\\mathcal{P}}=0,\nJ^{\\rm P}=\\frac{3}{2}^- \\}$ to be produced in $\\Lambda_b^0$ decays. Assuming\nthat the orbital mass difference between the charmed pentaquarks is similar to\nthe corresponding mass difference in the charmed baryons, we estimate the mass\nof the lower pentaquark $J^P=3/2^-$ state to be about 4110 MeV and suggest to\nreanalyze the LHCb data to search for this third state. We present the\nspectroscopy of the $S$- and $P$-wave pentaquark states having a $c\\bar{c}$\npair and three light quarks using an effective Hamiltonian approach. Some of\nthese pentaquarks can be produced in weak decays of the $b$-baryons. Combining\nheavy quark symmetry and the $SU(3)_F$ symmetry results in strikingly simple\nrelations among the decay amplitudes which are presented here.\n", "  We present late-time HST images of the site of supernova (SN) 2009ip taken\nalmost 3 yr after its bright 2012 luminosity peak. SN 2009ip is now slightly\nfainter in broad filters than the progenitor candidate detected by HST in 1999.\nThe current source continues to be dominated by ongoing late-time CSM\ninteraction that produces strong H-alpha emission and a weak pseudo-continuum,\nas found previously for 1-2 yr after explosion. The intent of these\nobservations was to search for evidence of recent star formation in the local\n(1kpc; 10 arcsec) environment around SN 2009ip, in the remote outskirts of its\nhost spiral galaxy NGC 7259. We can rule out the presence of any massive\nstar-forming complexes like 30 Dor or the Carina Nebula at the SN site or\nwithin a few kpc. If the progenitor of SN 2009ip was really a 50-80 Msun star\nas archival HST images suggested, then it is strange that there is no sign of\nthis type of massive star formation anywhere in the vicinity. A possible\nexplanation is that the progenitor was the product of a merger or binary mass\ntransfer, rejuvenated after a lifetime that was much longer than 4-5 Myr,\nallowing its natal H II region to have faded. A smaller region like the Orion\nNebula would be an unresolved but easily detected point source. This is ruled\nout within 1.5 kpc around SN 2009ip, but a small H II region could be hiding in\nthe glare of SN 2009ip itself. Later images after a few more years have passed\nare needed to confirm that the progenitor candidate is truly gone and to test\nfor the presence of a small H II region or cluster at the SN position.\n", "  We have measured an annual parallax of the Mira variable R~Ursae~Majoris\n(R~UMa) with the VLBI exploration for Radio Astronomy (VERA). From the\nmonitoring VLBI observations spanning about two years, we detected H$_2$O maser\nspots in the LSR velocities ranges from 37 to 42 km\\,s$^{-1}$. We derived an\nannual parallax of 1.97$\\pm$0.05\\,mas, and it gives a corresponding distance of\n508$\\pm$13\\,pc. The VLBI maps revealed 72 maser spots distributed in $\\sim$110\nau area around an expected stellar position. Circumstellar kinematics of the\nmaser spots were also revealed by subtracting a systemic motion in the\nHipparcos catalog from proper motions of each maser spots derived from our VLBI\nobservations. Infrared photometry is also conducted to measure a $K$ band\napparent magnitude, and we obtained a mean magnitude of $m_K$ =\n1.19$\\pm$0.02\\,mag. Using the trigonometric distance, the $m_K$ is converted to\na $K$ band absolute magnitude of $M_K = -$7.34$\\pm$0.06\\,mag. This result gives\na much more accurate absolute magnitude of R~UMa than previously provided. We\nsolved a zero-point of $M_K - \\log P$ relation for the Galactic Mira variables\nand obtained a relation of $M_K = -$3.52 $\\log P$ + (1.09 $\\pm$ 0.14). Other\nlong period variables including red supergiants, whose distances were\ndetermined from astrometric VLBI, were also compiled to explore the different\nsequences of $M_K - \\log P$ relation.\n", "  We report on new results on the infrared behaviour of the three-gluon vertex\nin quenched Quantum Chormodynamics, obtained from large-volume lattice\nsimulations. The main focus of our study is the appearance of the\ncharacteristic infrared feature known as 'zero crossing', the origin of which\nis intimately connected with the nonperturbative masslessness of the\nFaddeev-Popov ghost. The appearance of this effect is clearly visible in one of\nthe two kinematic configurations analyzed, and its theoretical origin is\ndiscussed in the framework of Schwinger-Dyson equations. The effective coupling\nin the momentum subtraction scheme that corresponds to the three-gluon vertex\nis constructed, revealing the vanishing of the effective interaction at the\nexact location of the zero crossing.\n", "  The paper analyzes the transverse forces (the Magnus and the Lorentz forces)\non vortices in superfluids put into periodic potentials at $T=0$. The case of\nweak potential and the tight-binding limit described by the Bose-Hubbard model\nwere addressed. The analysis was based on the balance of true momentum and\nquasimomentum. A special attention was paid to the superfluid close to the\nsuperfluid-insulator transition. In this area of the phase diagram the theory\npredicts the particle-hole symmetry line where the Magnus force changes sign\nwith respect to that expected from the sign of velocity circulation. Our\nanalysis has shown that the magnitude of the Magnus force is a continuous\nfunction at crossing the particle-hole symmetry line. This challenges the\ntheory connecting the magnitude of the Magnus force with topological Chern\nnumbers and predicting a jump at crossing this line. Disagreement is explained\nby the role of intrinsic pinning and guided vortex motion ignored in the\ntopological approach. It is one more evidence that in general topological\narguments are not sufficient for derivation of equations of vortex motion.\n", "  We analyze experimental data obtained from an electrical circuit having\ncomponents at different temperatures, showing how to predict its response to\ntemperature variations. This illustrates in detail how to utilize a recent\nlinear response theory for nonequilibrium overdamped stochastic systems. To\nvalidate these results, we introduce a reweighting procedure that mimics the\nactual realization of the perturbation and allows extracting the susceptibility\nof the system from steady state data. This procedure is closely related to\nother fluctuation-response relations based on the knowledge of the steady state\nprobability distribution. As an example, we show that the nonequilibrium heat\ncapacity in general does not correspond to the correlation between the energy\nof the system and the heat flowing into it. Rather, also non-dissipative\naspects are relevant in the nonequilbrium fluctuation response relations.\n", "  The differential cross section of exclusive diffractive vector meson\nproduction in electron proton collisions carries important information on the\ngeometric structure of the proton. More specifically, the coherent cross\nsection as a function of the transferred transverse momentum is sensitive to\nthe size of the proton, while the incoherent, or proton dissociative cross\nsection is sensitive to fluctuations of the gluon distribution in coordinate\nspace. We show that at high energies the experimentally measured coherent and\nincoherent cross sections for the production of $J/\\Psi$ mesons are very well\nreproduced within the color glass condensate framework when strong geometric\nfluctuations of the gluon distribution in the proton are included. For $\\rho$\nmeson production we also find reasonable agreement. We study in detail the\ndependence of our results on various model parameters, including the average\nproton shape, analyze the effect of saturation scale and color charge\nfluctuations and constrain the degree of geometric fluctuations.\n", "  Using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, we have made the\nfirst high spatial and spectral resolution observations of the molecular gas\nand dust in the prototypical blue compact dwarf galaxy II Zw 40. The CO(2-1)\nand CO(3-2) emission is clumpy and distributed throughout the central\nstar-forming region. Only one of eight molecular clouds has associated star\nformation. The continuum spectral energy distribution is dominated by free-free\nand synchrotron: at 870$\\mu m$, only 50% of the emission is from dust. We\nderive a CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor by several methods including a new\nmethod that uses simple photodissocation models and resolved CO line intensity\nmeasurements to derive a relationship that uniquely predicts $\\alpha_{CO}$ for\na given metallicity. We find that the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor is 4 to 35\ntimes that of the Milky Way (18.1 to 150.5 M$_\\odot$ / (K km/s pc$^2$)). The\nstar formation efficiency of the molecular gas at least 10 times higher than\nthat found in normal spiral galaxies, which is likely due to the\nburst-dominated star formation history of II Zw 40 rather than an intrinsically\nhigher efficiency. The molecular clouds within II Zw 40 resemble those in other\nstrongly interacting systems like the Antennae: overall they have high\nsize-linewidth coefficients and molecular gas surface densities. These\nproperties appear to be due to the high molecular gas surface densities\nproduced in this merging system rather than to increased external pressure.\nOverall, these results paint a picture of II Zw 40 as a complex, rapidly\nevolving system whose molecular gas properties are dominated by the large-scale\ngas shocks from its on-going merger.\n", "  We have completed a measurement of the Stark shift within the $^{115}$In\n$6s_{1/2} \\rightarrow 6p_{1/2}$ excited-state transition using two-step laser\nspectroscopy in an indium atomic beam. Combining this measurement with recent\nexperimental results we determine the scalar polarizability, $\\alpha_{0}$, of\nthe $6p_{1/2}$ state to be $7683 \\pm43 \\,a_{0}^{3}$ in atomic units, a result\nwhich agrees very well with recent theoretical calculations. In this\nexperiment, one laser, stabilized to the $5p_{1/2} \\rightarrow 6s_{1/2}$ 410~nm\ntransition, was directed transversely to the atomic beam, while a second,\noverlapping laser was scanned across the 1343~nm $6s_{1/2} \\rightarrow\n6p_{1/2}$ transition. We utilized two-tone frequency-modulation spectroscopy of\nthe infrared laser beam to measure the second-step absorption in the\ninteraction region, where the optical depth is less than 10$^{-3}$. In the\ncourse of our experimental work we also determined the hyperfine splitting\nwithin the $6p_{1/2}$ state, improving upon the precision of an existing\nmeasurement.\n", "  In this paper we investigate the consequences of phantom crossing considering\nthe perturbative dynamics in models with interaction in their dark sector. By\nmean of a general study of gauge-invariant variables in comoving gauge, we\nrelate the sources of instabilities in the structure formation process with the\nphantom crossing. In order to illustrate these relations and its consequences\nin more detail, we consider a specific case of an holographic dark energy\ninteracting with dark matter. We find that in spite of the model is in\nexcellent agreement with observational data at background level, however it is\nplagued of instabilities in its perturbative dynamics. We reconstruct the model\nin order to avoid these undesirable instabilities, and we show that this\nimplies a modification of the concordance model at background. Also we find\ndrastic changes on the parameters space in our model when instabilities are\navoided.\n", "  We present a spectroscopic investigation of the Be+sdO binary system HR 2142\nthat is based upon large sets of ultraviolet observations from the\nInternational Ultraviolet Explorer and ground-based H-alpha observations. We\nmeasured radial velocities for the Be star component from these spectra, and\ncomputed a revised orbit. In order to search for the spectral signature of the\nhot subdwarf, we cross-correlated the short wavelength end of each IUE spectrum\nwith a model hot star spectrum, and then we used the predicted Doppler shifts\nof the subdwarf to shift-and-add all the cross-correlation functions to the\nframe of the subdwarf. This merged function shows the weak signal from the\nspectral lines of the hot star, and a best fit is obtained with a mass ratio\nM_2/M_1 = 0.07 +/- 0.02, companion temperature T_{eff} > 43 +/- 5 kK, projected\nrotational velocity V sin i < 30 km/s, and a monochromatic flux ratio near 1170\nAngstroms of f_2/f_1 > 0.009 +/- 0.001. This hot subdwarf creates a one-armed\nspiral, tidal wake in the disk of the Be star, and we present a circumbinary\ndisk model that can explain the occurrence of shell absorption lines by gas\nenhancements that occur where gas crossing the gap created by the subdwarf\nstrikes the disk boundaries. The faint companion of HR 2142 may be\nrepresentative of a significant fraction of Be stars with undetected former\nmass donor companion stars.\n", "  We study the axionic inflation with a modulated potential and examine if the\nprimordial tensor power spectrum exhibits oscillatory feature, which is\ntestable with future space-based gravitational wave experiments such as DECIGO\nand BBO. In the case of the single-field axion monodromy inflation, it turns\nout that it is difficult to detect the oscillation in the spectrum due to\nsuppression of the sub-Planckian decay constant of axion. On the other hand, in\nthe case of aligned chromo-natural inflation where the axion is coupled to a\nSU(2) gauge field, it turns out that the sizable oscillation in the tensor\nspectrum can occur due to the enhancement of chiral gravitational waves sourced\nby the gauge field. We expect that this feature will be a new probe to axion\nphenomenologies in early universe through the chiral gravitational waves.\n", "  We investigate the properties of $z$=2.23 H$\\alpha$ and [OIII]$\\lambda$5007\nemitters using the narrow-band-selected samples obtained from the High-$z$\nEmission Line Survey (HiZELS: Sobral et al. 2013). We construct two samples of\nthe H$\\alpha$ and [OIII] emitters and compare their integrated physical\nproperties. We find that the distribution of stellar masses, dust extinction,\nstar formation rates (SFRs), and specific SFRs, is not statistically different\nbetween the two samples. When we separate the full galaxy sample into three\nsubsamples according to the detections of the H$\\alpha$ and/or [OIII] emission\nlines, most of the sources detected with both H$\\alpha$ and [OIII] show ${\\rm\nlog(sSFR_{UV})}$$\\gtrsim$-9.5. The comparison of the three subsamples suggests\nthat sources with strong [OIII] line emission tend to have the highest\nstar-forming activity out all galaxies that we study. We argue that the [OIII]\nemission line can be used as a tracer of star-forming galaxies at high\nredshift, and that it is especially useful to investigate star-forming galaxies\nat $z$$>$3, for which H$\\alpha$ emission is no longer observable from the\nground.\n", "  The leading theory for the formation of the Earth's moon invokes a collision\nbetween a Mars-sized body and the proto-Earth to produce a disk of orbiting\nmaterial that later condenses to form the Moon. Here we study the early\nevolution of the protolunar disk. First, we show that the disk opacity is large\nand cooling is therefore inefficient (t_{cool} \\Omega >> 1). In this regime\nangular momentum transport in the disk leads to steady heating unless \\alpha <\n(t_{cool} \\Omega)^{-1} << 1. Following earlier work by Charnoz and Michaut, and\nCarballido et al., we show that once the disk is completely vaporized it is\nwell coupled to the magnetic field. We consider a scenario in which turbulence\ndriven by magnetic fields leads to a brief, hot phase where the disk is\ngeometrically thick, wit h strong turbulent mixing. The disk cools by spreading\nuntil it decouples from the field. We point out that approximately half the\naccretion energy is dissipated in the boundary layer where the disk meets the\nEarth's surface. This creates high entropy material close to the Earth, driving\nconvection and mixing. Finally, a hot, magnetized disk could drive bipolar\noutflows that remove mass and angular momentum from the Earth-Moon system.\n", "  The stellar halos of large galaxies represent a vital probe of the processes\nof galaxy evolution. They are the remnants of the initial bouts of star\nformation during the collapse of the proto-galactic cloud, coupled with imprint\nof ancient and on-going accretion events. Previously, we have reported the\ntentative detection of a possible, faint, extended stellar halo in the Local\nGroup spiral, the Triangulum Galaxy (M33). However, the presence of\nsubstructure surrounding M33 made interpretation of this feature difficult.\nHere, we employ the final data set from the Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey\n(PAndAS), combined with an improved calibration and a newly derived\ncontamination model for the region to revisit this claim. With an array of new\nfitting algorithms, fully accounting for contamination and the substantial\nsubstructure beyond the prominent stellar disk in M33, we reanalyse the\nsurrounds to separate the signal of the stellar halo and the outer halo\nsubstructure. Using more robust search algorithms, we do not detect a large\nscale smooth stellar halo and place a limit on the maximum surface brightness\nof such a feature of ${\\mu}_V$ = 35.5 mags per square arcsec, or a total halo\nluminosity of $L < 10^6L_{\\odot}$.\n", "  The traditional cultures of Aboriginal Australians include a significant\nastronomical component, perpetuated through oral tradition, ceremony, and art.\nThis astronomical knowledge includes a deep understanding of the motion of\nobjects in the sky, which was used for practical purposes such as constructing\ncalendars and for navigation. There is also evidence that traditional\nAboriginal Australians made careful records and measurements of cyclical\nphenomena, recorded unexpected phenomena such as eclipses and meteorite\nimpacts, and could determine the cardinal points to an accuracy of a few\ndegrees. Putative explanations of celestial phenomena appear throughout the\noral record, suggesting traditional Aborig- inal Australians sought to\nunderstand the natural world around them, in the same way as modern scientists,\nbut within their own cultural context. There is also a growing body of evidence\nfor sophisticated navigational skills, including the use of astronomically\nbased songlines. Songlines are effectively oral maps of the landscape, and are\nan efficient way of transmitting oral navigational skills in cultures that do\nnot have a written language. The study of Aboriginal astronomy has had an\nimpact extending beyond mere academic curiosity, facilitating cross-cultural\nunderstanding, demonstrating the intimate links between science and culture,\nand helping students to engage with science.\n", "  We present emission line templates for passively evolving (\"retired\")\ngalaxies, useful for investigation of the evolution of the ISM in these\ngalaxies, and characterization of their high-temperature source populations.\nThe templates are based on high signal-to-noise ($>800$) co-added spectra\n($3700-6800$\\AA) of $\\sim11500$ gas-rich Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxies\ndevoid of star-formation and active galactic nuclei. Stacked spectra are\nprovided for the entire sample and sub-samples binned by mean stellar age. In\nJohansson~et al (2014), these spectra provided the first measurements of the He\nII 4686\\AA\\ line in passively-evolving galaxies, and the observed He\nII/H$\\beta$ ratio constrained the contribution of accreting white dwarfs (the\n\"single-degenerate\" scenario) to the type Ia supernova rate. In this paper, the\nfull range of unambiguously detected emission lines are presented. Comparison\nof the observed [O I] 6300\\AA/H$\\alpha$ ratio with photoionization models\nfurther constrains any high-temperature single-degenerate scenario for type Ia\nsupernovae (with 1.5 $\\lesssim$ T/$10^{5}K$ $\\lesssim$ 10) to $\\lesssim$3-6\\%\nof the observed rate in the youngest age bin (i.e. highest SN Ia rate). Hence,\nfor the same temperatures, in the presence of an ambient population of post-AGB\nstars, we exclude additional high-temperature sources with a combined ionizing\nluminosity of $\\approx 1.35\\times 10^{30} L_{\\odot}/M_{\\odot,*}$ for stellar\npopulations with mean ages of 1 - 4 Gyrs. Furthermore, we investigate the\nextinction affecting both the stellar and nebular continuum. The latter shows\nabout five times higher values. This contradicts isotropically distributed dust\nand gas that renders similar extinction values for both cases.\n", "  We present Submillimeter Array (SMA) 1.35 mm subarcsecond angular resolution\nobservations toward the LkH{\\alpha} 234 intermediate-mass star-forming region.\nThe dust emission arises from a filamentary structure of $\\sim$5 arcsec\n($\\sim$4500 au) enclosing VLA 1-3 and MM 1, perpendicular to the different\noutflows detected in the region. The most evolved objects are located at the\nsoutheastern edge of the dust filamentary structure and the youngest ones at\nthe northeastern edge. The circumstellar structures around VLA 1, VLA 3, and MM\n1 have radii between $\\sim$200 and $\\sim$375 au and masses in the\n$\\sim$0.08-0.3 M$_{\\odot}$ range. The 1.35 mm emission of VLA 2 arises from an\nunresolved (r$< 135$ au) circumstellar disk with a mass of $\\sim$0.02\nM$_{\\odot}$. This source is powering a compact ($\\sim$4000 au), low radial\nvelocity ($\\sim$7 km s$^{-1}$) SiO bipolar outflow, close to the plane of the\nsky. We conclude that this outflow is the \"large-scale\" counterpart of the\nshort-lived, episodic, bipolar outflow observed through H$_2$O masers at much\nsmaller scales ($\\sim $180 au), and that has been created by the accumulation\nof the ejection of several episodic collimated events of material. The\ncircumstellar gas around VLA 2 and VLA 3 is hot ($\\sim$130 K) and exhibits\nvelocity gradients that could trace rotation. There is a bridge of warm and\ndense molecular gas connecting VLA 2 and VLA 3. We discuss the possibility that\nthis bridge could trace a stream of gas between VLA 3 and VLA 2, increasing the\naccretion rate onto VLA 2 to explain why this source has an important outflow\nactivity.\n", "  In this paper, we present results of a photometric and kinematic study for a\nsample of 13 edge-on spiral galaxies with pronounced integral-shape warps of\ntheir stellar discs. The global structure of the galaxies is analyzed on the\nbasis of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) imaging, in the g, r and i\npassbands. Spectroscopic observations are obtained with the 6-m Special\nAstrophysical Observatory telescope. In general, galaxies of the sample are\ntypical bright spiral galaxies satisfying the Tully-Fisher relation. Most of\nthe galaxies reside in dense spatial environments and, therefore, tidal\nencounters are the most probable mechanism for generating their stellar warps.\nWe carried out a detailed analysis of the galaxies and their warps and obtained\nthe following main results: (i) maximum angles of stellar warps in our sample\nare about 20{\\deg}; (ii) warps start, on average, between 2 and 3 exponential\nscale lengths of a disc; (iii) stronger warps start closer to the center, weak\nwarps start farther; (iv) warps are asymmetric, with the typical degree of\nasymmetry of about several degrees (warp angle); (v) massive dark halo is\nlikely to preclude the formation of strong and asymmetric warps.\n", "  Photoionization with attosecond pulses populates hole states in the photoion.\nSuperpositions of hole states represent ideal candidates for time-dependent\nspectroscopy, for example via pump-probe studies. The challenge consists in\nidentifying pulses that create coherent superpositions of hole states while\nsatisfying practical constraints. Here, we employ quantum optimal control to\nmaximize the degree of coherence between these hole states. To this end, we\nintroduce a derivative-free optimization method with Sequential PArametrization\nupdate (SPA-optimization). We demonstrate the versatility and computational\nefficiency of SPA-optimization for photoionization in argon by maximizing the\ncoherence between the $3s$ and $3p_0$ hole states using shaped attosecond\npulses. We show that it is possible to maximize the hole coherence while\nsimultaneously prescribing the ratio of the final hole state populations.\n", "  We present a multi-wavelength analysis of five submillimeter sources (S_1.1mm\n= 0.54-2.02 mJy) that were detected during our 1.1-mm-deep continuum survey in\nthe SXDF-UDS-CANDELS field (2 arcmin^2, 1sigma = 0.055 mJy beam^-1) using the\nAtacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The two brightest sources\ncorrespond to a known single-dish (AzTEC) selected bright submillimeter galaxy\n(SMG), whereas the remaining three are faint SMGs newly uncovered by ALMA. If\nwe exclude the two brightest sources, the contribution of the ALMA-detected\nfaint SMGs to the infrared extragalactic background light is estimated to be ~\n4.1^{+5.4}_{-3.0} Jy deg^{-2}, which corresponds to ~ 16^{+22}_{-12}% of the\ninfrared extragalactic background light. This suggests that their contribution\nto the infrared extragalactic background light is as large as that of bright\nSMGs. We identified multi-wavelength counterparts of the five ALMA sources. One\nof the sources (SXDF-ALMA3) is extremely faint in the optical to near-infrared\nregion despite its infrared luminosity (L_IR ~ 1e12 L_sun or SFR ~ 100 M_sun\nyr^{-1}). By fitting the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) at the\noptical-to-near-infrared wavelengths of the remaining four ALMA sources, we\nobtained the photometric redshifts (z_photo) and stellar masses (M_*): z_photo\n~ 1.3-2.5, M_* ~ (3.5-9.5)e10 M_sun. We also derived their star formation rates\n(SFRs) and specific SFRs (sSFRs) as ~ 30-200 M_sun yr^{-1} and ~ 0.8-2\nGyr^{-1}, respectively. These values imply that they are main-sequence\nstar-forming galaxies.\n", "  The weak interaction charged current processes ($\\nu_e+n\\leftrightarrow\np+e^-$, $\\bar\\nu_e +p\\leftrightarrow n+e^+$, $n\\leftrightarrow\np+e^-+\\bar\\nu_e$) interconvert neutrons and protons in the early universe and\nhave significant influence on Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) light-element\nabundance yields, particulary that for $^{4}{\\rm He}$. We demonstrate that the\ninfluence of these processes is still significant even when they operate well\nbelow temperatures $T\\sim0.7\\,{\\rm MeV}$ usually invoked for \"weak freeze-out,\"\nand in fact down nearly into the alpha-particle formation epoch ($T \\approx\n0.1\\,{\\rm MeV}$). This physics is correctly captured in commonly used BBN\ncodes, though this late-time, low-temperature persistent effect of the\nisospin-changing weak processes, and the sensitivity of the associated rates to\nlepton energy distribution functions and blocking factors are not widely\nappreciated. We quantify this late-time influence by analyzing weak interaction\nrate dependence on the neutron lifetime, lepton energy distribution functions,\nentropy, the proton-neutron mass difference, and Hubble expansion rate. The\neffects we point out here render BBN a keen probe of any beyond-standard-model\nphysics that alters lepton number/energy distributions, even subtly, in epochs\nof the early universe all the way down to near $T=100\\,{\\rm keV}$.\n", "  Background: Two new $J^\\pi=0^+$ states are recently observed around a few MeV\nabove the Hoyle state (the second $0^+$ state in 12C). The characters of them\nare only poorly discussed in theory and are still mysterious.\n  Purpose: I give for the first time a comprehensive understanding of the\nstructures of the $0^+$ states by analyzing their wave functions, and discuss\nrelationship with the Hoyle state, similarities, and differences between the\nstates.\n  Method: I extend a microscopic $\\alpha$-cluster model called\nTohsaki-Horiuchi-Schuck-R\\\"opke (THSR) wave function so as to incorporate\n$2\\alpha+\\alpha$ asymmetric configuration explicitly. The so-called\n$r^2$-constraint method to effectively eliminate spurious continuum components\nis also used.\n  Results: The $0_3^+$ state is shown to have a very large squared overlap with\na single configuration of the extended THSR wave function in an orthogonal\nspace to the Hoyle state as well as to the ground state. The $0_4^+$ state has\na maximal squared overlap with a single extended THSR wave function with an\nextremely prolately-deformed shape.\n  Conclusions: The $0_3^+$ state appears as a family of the Hoyle state to have\na higher nodal structure in the internal motions of the $3\\alpha$ clusters, due\nto the orthogonalization to the Hoyle state. The $0_4^+$ state dominantly has a\nlinear-chain structure, where the $3\\alpha$ clusters move freely in a\nnon-localized way, like a one-dimensional gas of the $3\\alpha$ clusters.\n", "  We present asymptotic giant branch (AGB) models of solar metallicity, to\nallow the interpretation of observations of Galactic AGB stars, whose distances\nshould be soon available after the first release of the Gaia catalogue. We find\nan abrupt change in the AGB physical and chemical properties, occurring at the\nthreshold mass to ignite hot bottom burning,i.e. $3.5M_{\\odot}$. Stars with\nmass below $3.5 M_{\\odot}$ reach the C-star stage and eject into the\ninterstellar medium gas enriched in carbon , nitrogen and $^{17}O$. The higher\nmass counterparts evolve at large luminosities, between $3\\times 10^4\nL_{\\odot}$ and $10^5 L_{\\odot}$. The mass expelled from the massive AGB stars\nshows the imprinting of proton-capture nucleosynthesis, with considerable\nproduction of nitrogen and sodium and destruction of $^{12}C$ and $^{18}O$. The\ncomparison with the most recent results from other research groups are\ndiscussed, to evaluate the robustness of the present findings. Finally, we\ncompare the models with recent observations of galactic AGB stars, outlining\nthe possibility offered by Gaia to shed new light on the evolution properties\nof this class of objects.\n", "  The effect of quantum gravity can bring a tiny light speed variation which is\ndetectable through energetic photons propagating from gamma ray bursts (GRBs)\nto an observer such as the space observatory. Through an analysis of the\nenergetic photon data of the GRBs observed by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space\nTelescope (FGST), we reveal a surprising regularity of the observed time lags\nbetween photons of different energies with respect to the Lorentz violation\nfactor due to the light speed energy dependence. Such regularity suggests a\nlinear form correction of the light speed $v(E)=c(1-E/E_{\\rm LV})$, where $E$\nis the photon energy and $E_{\\rm LV}=(3.60 \\pm 0.26) \\times 10^{17}~ \\rm GeV$\nis the Lorentz violation scale measured by the energetic photon data of GRBs.\nThe results support an energy dependence of the light speed in cosmological\nspace.\n", "  Here, we report a systematic study on the Hall-effect of the semi-metallic\nstate of bulk MoTe$_2$, which was recently claimed to be a candidate for a\nnovel type of Weyl semi-metallic state. The temperature ($T$) dependence of the\ncarrier densities and of their mobilities, as estimated from a numerical\nanalysis based on the isotropic two-carrier model, indicates that its\nexceedingly large and non-saturating magnetoresistance may be attributed to a\nnear perfect compensation between the densities of electrons and holes at low\ntemperatures. A sudden increase in hole density, with a concomitant rapid\nincrease in the electron mobility below $T \\sim 40$ K, leads to comparable\ndensities of electrons and holes at low temperatures suggesting a possible\nelectronic phase-transition around this temperature.\n", "  We predict the electrical generation and injection of domain walls into a\nferromagnetic nano-wire without the need of an assisting magnetic field. Our\nanalytical and numerical results show that above a critical current $j_{c}$\ndomain walls are injected into the nano-wire with a period $T \\sim\n(j-j_{c})^{-1/2}$. Importantly, domain walls can be produced periodically even\nin a simple exchange ferromagnet with uniaxial anisotropy, without requiring\nany standard \"twisting\" interaction like Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya or dipole-dipole\ninteractions. We show analytically that this process and the period exponents\nare universal and do not depend on the peculiarities of the microscopic\nHamiltonian. Finally we give a specific proposal for an experimental\nrealization.\n", "  Detection of the Epoch of Reionization HI signal requires a precise\nunderstanding of the intervening galaxies and AGN, both for instrumental\ncalibration and foreground removal. We present a catalogue of 7394\nextragalactic sources at 182 MHz detected in the RA=0 field of the Murchison\nWidefield Array Epoch of Reionization observation programme. Motivated by\nunprecedented requirements for precision and reliability we develop new methods\nfor source finding and selection. We apply machine learning methods to\nself-consistently classify the relative reliability of 9490 source candidates.\nA subset of 7466 are selected based on reliability class and signal-to-noise\nratio criteria. These are statistically cross-matched to four other radio\nsurveys using both position and flux density information. We find 7369 sources\nto have confident matches, including 90 partially resolved sources that split\ninto a total of 192 sub-components. An additional 25 unmatched sources are\nincluded as new radio detections. The catalogue sources have a median spectral\nindex of -0.85. Spectral flattening is seen toward lower frequencies with a\nmedian of -0.71 predicted at 182 MHz. The astrometric error is 7 arcsec.\ncompared to a 2.3 arcmin. beam FWHM. The resulting catalogue covers\napproximately 1400 sq. deg. and is complete to approximately 80 mJy within half\nbeam power. This provides the most reliable discrete source sky model available\nto date in the MWA EoR0 field for precision foreground subtraction.\n", "  During eruptive solar flares and coronal mass ejections, a non-pot{\\-}ential\nmagnetic arcade with much excess magnetic energy goes unstable and reconnects.\nIt produces a twisted erupting flux rope and leaves behind a sheared arcade of\nhot coronal loops. We suggest that: the twist of the erupting flux rope can be\ndetermined from conservation of magnetic flux and magnetic helicity and\nequipartition of magnetic helicity. It depends on the geometry of the initial\npre-eruptive structure.\n  Two cases are considered, in the first of which a flux rope is not present\ninitially but is created during the eruption by the reconnection. In the second\ncase, a flux rope is present under the arcade in the pre-eruptive state, and\nthe effect of the eruption and reconnection is to add an amount of magnetic\nhelicity that depends on the fluxes of the rope and arcade and the geometry.\n", "  The 6.67 hr periodicity and the variable X-ray flux of the central compact\nobject (CCO) at the center of the SNR RCW 103, named 1E 161348-5055, have been\nalways difficult to interpret within the standard scenarios of an isolated\nneutron star or a binary system. On 2016 June 22, the Burst Alert Telescope\n(BAT) onboard Swift detected a magnetar-like short X-ray burst from the\ndirection of 1E 161348-5055, also coincident with a large long-term X-ray\noutburst. Here we report on Chandra, NuSTAR, and Swift (BAT and XRT)\nobservations of this peculiar source during its 2016 outburst peak. In\nparticular, we study the properties of this magnetar-like burst, we discover a\nhard X-ray tail in the CCO spectrum during outburst, and we study its long-term\noutburst history (from 1999 to July 2016). We find the emission properties of\n1E 161348-5055 consistent with it being a magnetar. However in this scenario,\nthe 6.67 hr periodicity can only be interpreted as the rotation period of this\nstrongly magnetized neutron star, which therefore represents the slowest pulsar\never detected, by orders of magnitude. We briefly discuss the viable slow-down\nscenarios, favoring a picture involving a period of fall-back accretion after\nthe supernova explosion, similarly to what is invoked (although in a different\nregime) to explain the \"anti-magnetar\" scenario for other CCOs.\n", "  Sulfur and zinc are chemically volatile elements, which play significant\nroles as depletion-free tracers in studying galactic chemical evolution.\nHowever, regarding red giants having evolved off the main sequence, reliable\nabundance determinations of S and Zn seem to be difficult despite that a few\nstudies have been reported so far. Given this situation, we tried to establish\nthe abundances of these elements for an extensive sample of 239 field GK giants\n(-0.8 < [Fe/H] < +0.2), by applying the spectrum-fitting technique to S I\n8694-5, S I 6757, and Zn I 6362 lines and by taking into account the non-LTE\neffect. Besides, similar abundance analysis was done for 160 FGK dwarfs to be\nused for comparison. The non-LTE corrections for the S and Zn abundances\nderived from these lines turned out < 0.1(-0.2) dex for most cases and not very\nsignificant. It revealed that the S I 6757 feature is more reliable as an\nabundance indicator than S I 8694-5 for the case of red giants, because the\nlatter suffers blending of unidentified lines. The finally resulting\n[S/Fe]-[Fe/H] and [Zn/Fe]-[Fe/H] relations for GK giants were confirmed to be\nin good agreement with those for FGK dwarfs, indicating that S and Zn\nabundances of red giants are reliably determinable from the S I 6757 and Zn I\n6362 lines. Accordingly, not only main-sequence stars but also evolved red\ngiant stars are usable for tracing the chemical evolution history of S and Zn\nin the regime of disk metallicity by using these lines.\n", "  This is the fifth in a series of papers studying the astrophysics and\ncosmology of massive, dynamically relaxed galaxy clusters. Our sample comprises\n40 clusters identified as being dynamically relaxed and hot in Papers I and II\nof this series. Here we use constraints on cluster mass profiles from X-ray\ndata to test some of the basic predictions of cosmological structure formation\nin the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) paradigm. We present constraints on the\nconcentration--mass relation for massive clusters, finding a power-law mass\ndependence with a slope of $\\kappa_m=-0.16\\pm0.07$, in agreement with CDM\npredictions. For this relaxed sample, the relation is consistent with a\nconstant as a function of redshift (power-law slope with $1+z$ of\n$\\kappa_\\zeta=-0.17\\pm0.26$), with an intrinsic scatter of $\\sigma_{\\ln\nc}=0.16\\pm0.03$. We investigate the shape of cluster mass profiles over the\nradial range probed by the data (typically $\\sim50$kpc--1Mpc), and test for\ndepartures from the simple Navarro, Frenk & White (NFW) form, for which the\nlogarithmic slope of the density profile tends to $-1$ at small radii.\nSpecifically, we consider as alternatives the generalized NFW (GNFW) and\nEinasto parametrizations. For the GNFW model, we find an average value of\n(minus) the logarithmic inner slope of $\\beta=1.02\\pm0.08$, with an intrinsic\nscatter of $\\sigma_\\beta=0.22\\pm0.07$, while in the Einasto case we constrain\nthe average shape parameter to be $\\alpha=0.29\\pm0.04$ with an intrinsic\nscatter of $\\sigma_\\alpha=0.12\\pm0.04$. Our results are thus consistent with\nthe simple NFW model on average, but we clearly detect the presence of\nintrinsic, cluster-to-cluster scatter about the average.\n", "  The average bulge [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are +0.06 and +0.17 dex, respectively, in\nBaade's Window, roughly 0.2 dex higher than the thin disk and ~0.7 dex higher\nthan the local thick disk metallicity. This suggests a higher effective yield\nin the bulge, perhaps due to more efficient retention of supernova ejecta. The\nbulge vertical [Fe/H] gradient, at ~0.5 dex/kpc, appears to be due to a\nchanging mixture of sub-populations (near +0.3 dex and -0.3 dex and one\npossibly near -0.7 dex) with latitude. The bulge is enhanced in O, Mg, Si, Ca,\nTi, and Al relative to the sun, with [alpha/Fe]=+0.15 dex at [Fe/H]=0.0 dex.\nBelow [Fe/H]~-0.5 dex, the bulge and local thick disk compositions are very\nsimilar, but small [Mg/Fe] and possibly [<SiCaTi>/Fe] enhancements, low [La/Eu]\nratios and large [Cu/Fe], relative to the thick disk suggest slightly higher\nSFR in the bulge. However, these composition differences could simply be due to\nmeasurement errors and non-LTE effects. Unfortunately, comparison with the\nthick disk near solar [Fe/H] suffers considerable confusion, due to poor\nidentification of the local thick disk. Unusual zig-zag abundance trends of\n[Cu/Fe] and [Na/Fe] suggest nucleosynthesis dominated by core-collapse\nsupernovae with metallicity-dependent yields, in the Type~Ia supernova\ntime-delay scenario. Thus, the bulge sub-population compositions resemble the\nlocal thin and thick disks, but at higher [Fe/H], suggesting a radial [Fe/H]\ngradient in both the thin and thick disks, within the solar circle, near -0.04\nto -0.05 dex/kpc. If the bulge was built through accretion of inner disk stars\nby a bar, it appears that the inner thin and thick disk stars, incorporated\ninto the bulge, retained vertical scale heights characteristic of their\nkinematic origin, and resulting in the vertical [Fe/H] gradient and [alpha/Fe]\ntrends seen today.\n", "  We study the evolution of galactic magnetic fields using 3D smoothed particle\nmagnetohydrodynamics (SPMHD) simulations of galaxies with an imposed spiral\npotential. We consider the appearance of reversals of the field, and\namplification of the field. We find magnetic field reversals occur when the\nvelocity jump across the spiral shock is above $\\approx$20km s$^{-1}$,\noccurring where the velocity change is highest, typically at the inner Lindblad\nresonance (ILR) in our models. Reversals also occur at corotation, where the\ndirection of the velocity field reverses in the co-rotating frame of a spiral\narm. They occur earlier with a stronger amplitude spiral potential, and later\nor not at all with weaker or no spiral arms. The presence of a reversal at a\nradii of around 4--6 kpc in our fiducial model is consistent with a reversal\nidentified in the Milky Way, though we caution that alternative Galaxy models\ncould give a similar reversal. We find that relatively high resolution, a few\nmillion particles in SPMHD, is required to produce consistent behaviour of the\nmagnetic field. Amplification of the magnetic field occurs in the models, and\nwhile some may be genuinely attributable to differential rotation or spiral\narms, some may be a numerical artefact. We check our results using Athena,\nfinding reversals but less amplification of the field, suggesting that some of\nthe amplification of the field with SPMHD is numerical.\n", "  We discuss dynamical systems approaches and methods applied to flat\nRobertson-Walker models in $f(R)$-gravity. We argue that a complete description\nof the solution space of a model requires a global state space analysis that\nmotivates globally covering state space adapted variables. This is shown\nexplicitly by an illustrative example, $f(R) = R + \\alpha R^2$, $\\alpha > 0$,\nfor which we introduce new regular dynamical systems on global compactly\nextended state spaces for the Jordan and Einstein frames. This example also\nallows us to illustrate several local and global dynamical systems techniques\ninvolving, e.g., blow ups of nilpotent fixed points, center manifold analysis,\naveraging, and use of monotone functions. As a result of applying dynamical\nsystems methods to globally state space adapted dynamical systems formulations,\nwe obtain pictures of the entire solution spaces in both the Jordan and the\nEinstein frames. This shows, e.g., that due to the domain of the conformal\ntransformation between the Jordan and Einstein frames, not all the solutions in\nthe Jordan frame are completely contained in the Einstein frame. We also make\ncomparisons with previous dynamical systems approaches to $f(R)$ cosmology and\ndiscuss their advantages and disadvantages.\n", "  Integral field unit spectrographs allow the 2D exploration of the kinematics\nand stellar populations of galaxies, although they are generally restricted to\nsmall fields-of-view. Using the large field-of-view of the DEIMOS multislit\nspectrograph on Keck and our Stellar Kinematics using Multiple Slits (SKiMS)\ntechnique, we are able to extract sky-subtracted stellar light spectra to large\ngalactocentric radii. Here we present a new DEIMOS mask design named SuperSKiMS\nthat explores large spatial scales without sacrificing high spatial sampling.\nWe simulate a set of observations with such a mask design on the nearby galaxy\nNGC 1023, showing that the kinematic and metallicity measurements can reach\nradii where the galaxy surface brightness is several orders of magnitude\nfainter than the sky. Such a technique is also able to reproduce the kinematic\nand metallicity 2D distributions obtained from literature integral field\nspectroscopy in the innermost galaxy regions. In particular, we use the\nsimulated NGC 1023 kinematics to model its total mass distribution to large\nradii, obtaining comparable results with those from published integral field\nunit observation. Finally, from new spectra of NGC 1023 we obtain stellar 2D\nkinematics and metallicity distributions that show good agreement with integral\nfield spectroscopy results in the overlapping regions. In particular, we do not\nfind a significant offset between our SKiMS and the ATLAS$^\\rm{3D}$ stellar\nvelocity dispersion at the same spatial locations.\n", "  In a recent letter, we presented numerical relativity simulations, solving\nthe full Einstein--Maxwell--Klein-Gordon equations, of superradiantly unstable\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"om black holes (BHs), enclosed in a cavity. Low frequency,\nspherical perturbations of a charged scalar field, trigger this instability.\nThe system's evolution was followed into the non-linear regime, until it\nrelaxed into an equilibrium configuration, found to be a $\\textit{hairy}$ BH: a\ncharged horizon in equilibrium with a scalar field condensate, whose phase is\noscillating at the (final) critical frequency. Here, we investigate the impact\nof adding self-interactions to the scalar field. In particular, we find\nsufficiently large self-interactions suppress the exponential growth phase,\nknown from linear theory, and promote a non-monotonic behaviour of the scalar\nfield energy. Furthermore, we discuss in detail the influence of the various\nparameters in this model: the initial BH charge, the initial scalar\nperturbation, the scalar field charge, mass, and the position of the cavity's\nboundary (mirror). We also investigate the \"explosive\" non-linear regime\npreviously reported to be akin to a bosenova. A mode analysis shows that the\n\"explosions\" can be interpreted as the decay into the BH of modes that exit the\nsuperradiant regime.\n", "  We study time evolution of rotating, axisymmetric, two dimensional inviscid\naccretion flows around black holes using a grid based finite difference method.\nWe do not use reflection symmetry on the equatorial plane in order to inspect\nif the disk along with the centrifugal barrier oscillated vertically. In the\ninviscid limit, we find that the CENtrifugal pressure supported BOundary Layer\n(CENBOL) is oscillating vertically, more so, when the specific angular momentum\nis higher. As a result, the rate of outflow produced from the CENBOL, also\noscillates. Indeed, the outflow rates in the upper half and the lower half are\nfound to be anti-correlated. We repeat the exercise for a series of specific\nangular momentum {\\lambda} of the flow in order to demonstrate effects of the\ncentrifugal force on this interesting behaviour. We find that, as predicted in\ntheoretical models of disks in vertical equilibrium, the CENBOL is produced\nonly when the centrifugal force is significant and more specifically, when\n{\\lambda} > 1.5. Outflow rate itself is found to increase with {\\lambda} as\nwell and so is the oscillation amplitude. The cause of oscillation appears to\nbe due to the interaction among the back flow from the centrifugal barrier, the\noutflowing winds and the inflow. For low angular momentum, the back flow as\nwell as the oscillation are missing. To our knowledge, this is the first time\nthat such an oscillating solution is found with an well-tested grid based\nfinite difference code and such a solution could be yet another reason of why\nQuasi-Periodic Oscillations should be observed in black hole candidates which\nare accreting low angular momentum transonic flows.\n", "  In this work, dislocation master-equations valid for anisotropic materials\nare derived in terms of kernel functions using the framework of micromechanics.\nThe second derivative of the anisotropic Green tensor is calculated in the\nsense of generalized functions and decomposed into a sum of a $1/R^3$-term plus\na Dirac $\\delta$-term. The first term is the so-called \"Barnett-term\" and the\nlatter is important for the definition of the Green tensor as fundamental\nsolution of the Navier equation. In addition, all dislocation master-equations\nare specified for Somigliana dislocations with application to 3D crack\nmodeling. Also the interior Eshelby tensor for a spherical inclusion in an\nanisotropic material is derived as line integral over the unit circle.\n", "  We use high spectral resolution (R > 8000) data covering 3800-13000\\r{A} to\nstudy the physical conditions of the broad line region (BLR) of nine nearby\nSeyfert 1 galaxies. Up to six broad HI lines are present in each spectrum. A\ncomparison - for the first time using simultaneous optical to near-infrared\nobservations - to photoionisation calculations with our devised simple scheme\nyields the extinction to the BLR at the same time as determining the density\nand photon flux, and hence distance from the nucleus, of the emitting gas. This\npoints to a typical density for the HI emitting gas of 10$^{11}$cm$^{-3}$ and\nshows that a significant amount of this gas lies at regions near the dust\nsublimation radius, consistent with theoretical predictions. We also confirm\nthat in many objects the line ratios are far from case B, the best-fit\nintrinsic broad-line H$\\alpha$/H$\\beta$ ratios being in the range 2.5-6.6 as\nderived with our photoionization modeling scheme. The extinction to the BLR,\nbased on independent estimates from HI and HeII lines, is A$_V$ $\\le$ 3 for\nSeyfert 1-1.5s, while Seyfert 1.8-1.9s have A$_V$ in the range 4-8. A\ncomparison of the extinction towards the BLR and narrow line region (NLR)\nindicates that the structure obscuring the BLR exists on scales smaller than\nthe NLR. This could be the dusty torus, but dusty nuclear spirals or filaments\ncould also be responsible. The ratios between the X-ray absorbing column N$_H$\nand the extinction to the BLR are consistent with the Galactic gas-to-dust\nratio if N$_H$ variations are considered.\n", "  The gravitational influence of a second satellite on the rotation of an\noblate moon is numerically examined. A simplified model, assuming the axis of\nrotation perpendicular to the (Keplerian) orbit plane, is derived. The\ndifferences between the two models, i.e. in the absence and presence of the\nsecond satellite, are investigated via bifurcation diagrams and by evolving\ncompact sets of initial conditions in the phase space. It turns out that the\npresence of another satellite causes some trajectories, that were regular in\nits absence, to become chaotic. Moreover, the highly structured picture\nrevealed by the bifurcation diagrams in dependence on the eccentricity of the\noblate body's orbit is destroyed when the gravitational influence is included,\nand the periodicities and critical curves are destroyed as well. For\ndemonstrative purposes, focus is laid on parameters of the\nSaturn-Titan-Hyperion system, and on oblate satellites on low-eccentric orbits,\ni.e. $e\\approx 0.005$.\n", "  Dormant comets in the near-Earth object (NEO) population are thought to be\ninvolved in the terrestrial accretion of water and organic materials.\nIdentification of dormant comets is difficult as they are observationally\nindistinguishable from their asteroidal counterparts, however they may have\nproduced dust during their final active stages which potentially are detectable\ntoday as weak meteor showers at the Earth. Here we present the result of a\nreconnaissance survey looking for dormant comets using 13~567~542 meteor orbits\nmeasured by the Canadian Meteor Orbit Radar (CMOR). We simulate the dynamical\nevolution of the hypothetical meteoroid streams originated from 407 near-Earth\nasteroids in cometary orbits (NEACOs) that resemble orbital characteristics of\nJupiter-family comets (JFCs). Out of the 44 hypothetical showers that are\npredicted to be detectable by CMOR, we identify 5 positive detections that are\nstatistically unlikely to be chance associations, including 3 previously known\nassociations. This translates to a lower limit to the dormant comet fraction of\n$2.0\\pm1.7\\%$ in the NEO population and a dormancy rate of $\\sim\n10^{-5}~\\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ per comet. The low dormancy rate confirms disruption\nand dynamical removal as the dominant end state for near-Earth JFCs. We also\npredict the existence of a significant number of meteoroid streams whose\nparents have already been disrupted or dynamically removed.\n", "  We propose that {\\gamma} -rays in blazars can be produced during encounters\nof relativistic blobs of plasma with radiation field produced by luminous stars\nwithin (or close to) the jet. The blob is expected to contain relativistic\nelectrons which comptonize stellar radiation to the GeV-TeV energies. Produced\n{\\gamma} -rays can initiate the Inverse Compton e+/- pair cascade in the\nstellar radiation. We propose that such a scenario can be responsible for the\nappearance of the so-called orphan {\\gamma} -ray flares. We show that the\nrelativistic blob/luminous star collision model can explain the appearance of\nthe extreme orphan {\\gamma} -ray flare observed in the GeV and sub-TeV energy\nrange from the flat spectrum radio quasar PKS 1222+21.\n", "  The Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) is currently the most important facility\nfor investigating the GeV $\\gamma$-ray sky. With Fermi LAT more than three\nthousand $\\gamma$-ray sources have been discovered so far. 1144 ($\\sim40\\%$) of\nthe sources are active galaxies of the blazar class, and 573 ($\\sim20\\%$) are\nlisted as Blazar Candidate of Uncertain type (BCU), or sources without a\nconclusive classification. We use the Empirical Cumulative Distribution\nFunctions (ECDF) and the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for a fast method of\nscreening and classification for BCUs based on data collected at $\\gamma$-ray\nenergies only, when rigorous multiwavelength analysis is not available. Based\non our method, we classify 342 BCUs as BL Lacs and 154 as FSRQs, while 77\nobjects remain uncertain. Moreover, radio analysis and direct observations in\nground-based optical observatories are used as counterparts to the statistical\nclassifications to validate the method. This approach is of interest because of\nthe increasing number of unclassified sources in Fermi catalogs and because\nblazars and in particular their subclass High Synchrotron Peak (HSP) objects\nare the main targets of atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes.\n", "  We measure the star formation quenching efficiency and timescale in cluster\nenvironments. Our method uses N-body simulations to estimate the probability\ndistribution of possible orbits for a sample of observed SDSS galaxies in and\naround clusters based on their position and velocity offsets from their host\ncluster. We study the relationship between their star formation rates and their\nlikely orbital histories via a simple model in which star formation is quenched\nonce a delay time after infall has elapsed. Our orbit library method is\ndesigned to isolate the environmental effect on the star formation rate due to\na galaxy's present-day host cluster from `pre-processing' in previous group\nhosts. We find that quenching of satellite galaxies of all stellar masses in\nour sample ($10^{9}-10^{11.5}\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot$) by massive ($> 10^{13}\\,{\\rm\nM}_\\odot$) clusters is essentially $100$ per cent efficient. Our fits show that\nall galaxies quench on their first infall, approximately at or within a Gyr of\ntheir first pericentric passage. There is little variation in the onset of\nquenching from galaxy-to-galaxy: the spread in this time is at most $\\sim 2$\nGyr at fixed $M_*$. Higher mass satellites quench earlier, with very little\ndependence on host cluster mass in the range probed by our sample.\n", "  We present evidence of bar-induced secular evolution in galactic discs using\n3.6 ${\\mu m}$ images of nearby galaxies from the Spitzer Survey of Stellar\nStructure in Galaxies (S4G). We find that among massive galaxies\n($M_{star}/M_{sun}> 10^{10}$), longer bars tend to reside in inner discs having\na flatter radial profile. Such galaxies show a light deficit in the disc\nsurrounding the bar, within the bar radius and often show a $\\Theta$-shaped\nmorphology. We quantify this deficit and find that among all galaxies explored\nin this study (with $10^{9}<M_{star}/M_{sun}< 10^{11}$), galaxies with a\nstronger bar (i.e. longer and/or with a higher Bar/T) show a more pronounced\ndeficit. We also examine simulation snapshots to confirm and extend results by\nAthanassoula and Misiriotis, showing that as bars evolve they become longer,\nwhile the light deficit in the disc becomes more pronounced. Theoretical\nstudies have predicted that, as a barred galaxy evolves, the bar captures disc\nstars in its immediate neighbourhood so as to make the bar longer, stronger and\nthinner. Hence, we claim that the light deficit in the inner disc is produced\nby bars, which thus take part in shaping the mass distribution of their host\ngalaxies.\n", "  A fading radio source, coincident in time and position with the fast radio\nburst FRB150418, has been associated with the galaxy WISE J071634.59-190039.2.\nSubsequent observations of this galaxy have revealed that it contains a\npersistent, but variable, radio source. We present e-MERLIN, VLBA, and ATCA\nradio observations and Subaru optical observations of WISE J071634.59-190039.2\nand find that the persistent radio source is unresolved and must be compact\n(<0.01 kpc), and that its location is consistent with the optical centre of the\ngalaxy. We conclude that it is likely that WISE J071634.59-190039.2 contains a\nweak radio AGN.\n", "  Slowly rotating magnetic massive stars develop \"dynamical magnetospheres\"\n(DM's), characterized by trapping of stellar wind outflow in closed magnetic\nloops, shock heating from collision of the upflow from opposite loop\nfootpoints, and subsequent gravitational infall of radiatively cooled material.\nIn 2D and 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations the interplay among these\nthree components is spatially complex and temporally variable, making it\ndifficult to derive observational signatures and discern their overall scaling\ntrends.Within a simplified, steady-state analysis based on overall conservation\nprinciples, we present here an \"analytic dynamical magnetosphere\" (ADM) model\nthat provides explicit formulae for density, temperature and flow speed in each\nof these three components -- wind outflow, hot post-shock gas, and cooled\ninflow -- as a function of colatitude and radius within the closed (presumed\ndipole) field lines of the magnetosphere. We compare these scalings with\ntime-averaged results from MHD simulations, and provide initial examples of\napplication of this ADM model for deriving two key observational diagnostics,\nnamely hydrogen H-alpha emission line profiles from the cooled infall, and\nX-ray emission from the hot post-shock gas. We conclude with a discussion of\nkey issues and advantages in applying this ADM formalism toward derivation of a\nbroader set of observational diagnostics and scaling trends for massive stars\nwith such dynamical magnetospheres.\n", "  We present a deep near-infrared (NIR) photometric catalogue of sources from\nthe Parkes HI Zone of Avoidance (HIZOA) survey, which forms the basis for an\ninvestigation of the matter distribution in the Zone of Avoidance. Observations\nwere conducted between 2006 and 2013 using the Infrared Survey Facility (IRSF),\na 1.4-m telescope situated at the South African Astronomical Observatory site\nin Sutherland. The images cover all 1108 HIZOA detections and yield 915\ngalaxies. An additional 105 bright 2MASS galaxies in the southern ZOA were\nimaged with the IRSF, resulting in 129 galaxies. The average $K_s$-band seeing\nand sky background for the survey are 1.38 arcsec and 20.1 mag, respectively.\nThe detection rate as a function of stellar density and dust extinction is\nfound to depend mainly on the HI mass of the HI detected galaxies, which in\nprincipal correlates with the NIR brightness of the spiral galaxies. The\nmeasured isophotal magnitudes are of sufficient accuracy (errors $\\sim$ 0.02\nmag) to be used in a Tully-Fisher analysis. In the final NIR catalogue, 285\ngalaxies have both IRSF and 2MASS photometry (180 HIZOA plus 105 bright 2MASX\ngalaxies). The $K_s$-band isophotal magnitudes presented in this paper agree,\nwithin the uncertainties, with those reported in the 2MASX catalogue. Another\n30 galaxies, from the HIZOA northern extension, are also covered by UKIDSS\nGalactic Plane Survey (GPS) images, which are one magnitude deeper than our\nIRSF images. A modified version of our photometry pipeline was used to derive\nthe photometric parameters of these UKIDSS galaxies. Good agreement was found\nbetween the respective $K_s$-band isophotal magnitudes. These comparisons\nconfirm the robustness of the isophotal parameters and demonstrate that the\nIRSF images do not suffer from foreground contamination, after star removal,\nnor under-estimate the isophotal fluxes of ZoA galaxies.\n", "  S0 galaxies are known to host classical bulges with a broad range of size and\nmass, while some such S0s are barred and some not. The origin of the bars has\nremained as a long-standing problem -- what made bar formation possible in\ncertain S0s?\n  By analysing a large sample of S0s with classical bulges observed by the\nSpitzer space telescope, we find that most of our barred S0s host comparatively\nlow-mass classical bulges, typically with bulge-to-total ratio ($B/T$) less\nthan $0.5$; whereas S0s with more massive classical bulges than these do not\nhost any bar. Furthermore, we find that amongst the barred S0s, there is a\ntrend for the longer and massive bars to be associated with comparatively\nbigger and massive classical bulges -- possibly suggesting bar growth being\nfacilitated by these classical bulges. In addition, we find that the bulge\neffective radius is always less than the bar effective radius --indicating an\ninteresting synergy between the host classical bulge and bars being maintained\nwhile bar growth occurred in these S0s.\n", "  We report the results of a comprehensive analysis of X-ray (Chandra and Swift\nobservatories), optical (Southern African Large Telescope, SALT) and\nnear-infrared (the VVV survey) observations of the Be/X-ray binary pulsar\n2S1553-542. Accurate coordinates for the X-ray source are determined and are\nused to identify the faint optical/infrared counterpart for the first time.\nUsing VVV and SALTICAM photometry, we have constructed the spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) for this star and found a moderate NIR excess that is\ntypical for Be stars and arises due to the presence of circumstellar material\n(disk). A comparison of the SED with those of known Be/X-ray binaries has\nallowed us to estimate the spectral type of the companion star as B1-2V and the\ndistance to the system as $>15$ kpc. This distance estimation is supported by\nthe X-ray data and makes 2S1553-542 one of the most distant X-ray binaries\nwithin the Milky Way, residing on the far side in the Scutum-Centaurus arm or\neven further.\n", "  Binary-star exoplanetary systems are now known to be common, for both wide\nand close binaries. However, their orbital evolution is generally unsolvable.\nSpecial cases of the N-body problem which are in fact completely solvable\ninclude dynamical architectures known as central configurations. Here, I\nutilize recent advances in our knowledge of central configurations to assess\nthe plausibility of linking them to coplanar exoplanetary binary systems. By\nsimply restricting constituent masses to be within stellar or substellar ranges\ncharacteristic of planetary systems, I find that (i) this constraint reduces by\nover 90 per cent the phase space in which central configurations may occur,\n(ii) both equal-mass and unequal-mass binary stars admit central\nconfigurations, (iii) these configurations effectively represent different\ngeometrical extensions of the Sun-Jupiter-Trojan-like architecture, (iv)\ndeviations from these geometries are no greater than ten degrees, and (v) the\ndeviation increases as the substellar masses increase. This study may help\nrestrict future stability analyses to architectures which resemble exoplanetary\nsystems, and might hint at where observers may discover dust, asteroids and/or\nplanets in binary star systems.\n", "  Dust continuum and molecular observations of the low column density parts of\nmolecular clouds have revealed the presence of elongated structures which\nappear to be well aligned with the magnetic field. These so-called striations\nare usually assumed to be streams that flow towards or away from denser\nregions. We perform ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations adopting four\nmodels that could account for the formation of such structures. In the first\ntwo models striations are created by velocity gradients between ambient,\nparallel streamlines along magnetic field lines. In the third model striations\nare formed as a result of a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability perpendicular to field\nlines. Finally, in the fourth model striations are formed from the nonlinear\ncoupling of MHD waves due to density inhomogeneities. We assess the validity of\neach scenario by comparing the results from our simulations with previous\nobservational studies and results obtained from the analysis of CO (J = 1 - 0)\nobservations from the Taurus molecular cloud. We find that the first three\nmodels cannot reproduce the density contrast and the properties of the spatial\npower spectrum of a perpendicular cut to the long axes of striations. We\nconclude that the nonlinear coupling of MHD waves is the most probable\nformation mechanism of striations.\n", "  Chaotic dynamics are expected during and after planet formation, and a\nleading mechanism to explain large eccentricities of gas giant exoplanets is\nplanet-planet gravitational scattering. The same scattering has been invoked to\nexplain misalignments of planetary orbital planes with respect to their host\nstar's spin. However, an observational puzzle is presented by Kepler-56, which\nhas two inner planets (b and c) that are nearly coplanar with each other, yet\nare more than 45 degrees inclined to their star's equator. Thus the spin-orbit\nmisalignment might be primordial. Instead, we further develop the hypothesis in\nthe discovery paper, that planets on wider orbits generated misalignment\nthrough scattering, and as a result gently torqued the inner planets away from\nthe equator plane of the star. We integrated the equations of motion for\nKepler-56 b and c along with an unstable outer system initialized with either\ntwo or three Jupiter-mass planets. We address here whether the violent\nscattering that generates large mutual inclinations can leave the inner system\nintact, tilting it gently. In almost all of the cases initially with two outer\nplanets, either the inner planets remain nearly coplanar with each other in the\nstar's equator plane, or they are scattered violently to high mutual\ninclination and high spin-orbit misalignment. On the contrary, of the systems\nwith three unstable outer planets, a spin-orbit misalignment large enough to\nexplain the observations is generated 28% of the time for coplanar inner\nplanets, which is consistent with the observed frequency of this phenomenon\nreported so far. We conclude that multiple-planet scattering in the outer parts\nof the system may account for this new population of coplanar planets hosted by\noblique stars.\n", "  Arp194 is a system of recently collided galaxies, where the southern galaxy\n(S) passed through the gaseous disc of the northern galaxy (N) which in turn\nconsists of two close components. This system is of special interest due to the\npresence of regions of active star-formation in the bridge between galaxies,\nthe brightest of which (the region A) has a size of at least 4 kpc. We obtained\nthree spectral slices of the system for different slit positions at the 6-m\ntelescope of SAO RAS. We estimated the radial distribution of line-of-sight\nvelocity and velocity dispersion as well as the intensities of emission lines\nand oxygen abundance $12+\\log(\\mathrm{O/H})$. The gas in the bridge is only\npartially mixed chemically and spatially: we observe the O/H gradient with the\ngalactocentric distances both from S and N galaxies and a high dispersion of\nO/H in the outskirts of N-galaxy. Velocity dispersion of the emission-line gas\nis the lowest in the star-forming sites of the bridge and exceeds 50-70 km/s in\nthe disturbed region of N-galaxy. Based on the SDSS photometrical data and our\nkinematical profiles we measured the masses of stellar population and the\ndynamical masses of individual objects. We confirm that the region A is the\ngravitationally bound tidal dwarf with the age of $10^7 - 10^8 $ yr, which is\nfalling onto the parent S- galaxy. There is no evidence of the significant\namount of dark matter in this dwarf galaxy.\n", "  We develop an alternative Ashtekar formalism in eight dimensions. In fact,\nusing a MacDowell-Mansouri physical framework and a self-dual curvature\nsymmetry we propose an action in eight dimensions in which the Levi-Civita\ntenor with eight indices plays a key role. We explicitly show that such an\naction contains number of linear, quadratic and cubic terms in the Riemann\ntensor, Ricci tensor and scalar curvature. In particular, the linear term is\nreduced to the Einstein-Hilbert action with cosmological constant in eight\ndimensions. We prove that such a reduced action is equivalent to the Lovelock\naction in eight dimensions.\n", "  Quantum dynamics of magnetic order in a chiral multiferroic chain is studied.\nWe consider two different scenarios: Ultrashort terahertz (THz) excitations or\na sudden electric field quench. Performing analytical and numerical exact\ndiagonalization calculations we trace the pulse induced spin dynamics and\nextract quantities that are relevant to quantum information processing. In\nparticular, we analyze the dynamics of the system chirality, the von Neumann\nentropy, the pairwise and the many body entanglement. If the characteristic\nfrequencies of the generated states are non-commensurate then a partial loss of\npair concurrence occurs. Increasing the system size this effect becomes even\nmore pronounced. Many particle entanglement and chirality are robust and\npersist in the incommensurate phase. To analyze the dynamical quantum\ntransitions for the quenched and pulsed dynamics we combined the Weierstrass\nfactorization technique for entire functions and Lanczos exact diagonalization\nmethod. For a small system we obtained analytical results including the rate\nfunction of Loschmidt echo. Exact numerical calculations for a system up to 40\nspins confirm phase transition. Quench- induced dynamical transitions have been\nextensively studied recently. Here we show that related dynamical transitions\ncan be achieved and controlled by appropriate electric field pulses.\n", "  Nanoparticles of very small size (below 10 nm) of TiO2 material are nowadays\nthe functional building blocks of many developing technological applications.\nNano is clearly different from bulk or extended systems as regards surface\narea, molecular binding properties, charge separation efficiency, electron/hole\ntransport, photochemical conversion properties, etc. In this work, we\ninvestigate the life path of energy (excitons) and charge (electrons and holes)\ncarriers in anatase TiO2 nanoparticles of different size (2-3 nm) and shape\n(faceted vs spherical), by means of a wide set of hybrid density functional\ntheory calculations. The attention is focused on the exciton/charge carriers\nformation, separation, recombination, self-trapping processes, which are\nanalyzed in terms of structural deformations, energy gain or cost, charge\nlocalization/delocalization and electronic transitions involved. The\ncomputational models are corroborated by an extensive comparison with available\nexperimental data based on photoluminescence measurements, electron\nparamagnetic resonance and transient absorption spectroscopies. Peculiar\ndifferences are observed for spherical nanoparticles with respect to faceted\nones because of the higher disorder and larger diversity of coordination sites\npresent on the surface. For example, charge delocalization on several lattice\nsites is more competitive with self-trapping processes in faceted than in\nspherical nanoparticles. This relates to the fact that selective compression or\nelongation of Ti-O bonds play a key role in determining the effectiveness of\ntrapping sites, with spherical nanoparticles being more flexible. Moreover,\nhydroxyl groups on surface five-fold coordinated Ti sites are also found to be\ngood hole trapping sites.\n", "  Macroturbulence, introduced as a fudge to reproduce the width and shape of\nstellar absorption lines, reflects gas motions in stellar atmospheres. While in\ncool stars, it is thought to be caused by convection zones immediately beneath\nthe stellar surface, the origin of macroturbulence in hot stars is still under\ndiscussion. Recent works established a correlation between the\nturbulent-to-total pressure ratio inside the envelope of stellar models and the\nmacroturbulent velocities observed in corresponding Galactic stars. To probe\nthis connection further, we evaluated the turbulent pressure that arises in the\nenvelope convective zones of stellar models in the mass range 1-125 Msun based\non the mixing-length theory and computed for metallicities of the Large and\nSmall Magellanic Cloud. We find that the turbulent pressure contributions in\nmodels with these metallicities located in the hot high-luminosity part of the\nHertzsprung-Russel (HR) diagram is lower than in similar models with solar\nmetallicity, whereas the turbulent pressure in low-metallicity models\npopulating the cool part of the HR-diagram is not reduced. Based on our models,\nwe find that the currently available observations of hot massive stars in the\nMagellanic Clouds appear to support a connection between macroturbulence and\nthe turbulent pressure in stellar envelopes. Multidimensional simulations of\nsub-surface convection zones and a larger number of high-quality observations\nare necessary to test this idea more rigorously.\n", "  We present high-frequency ultrasonic measurements on the filled skutterudite\nSmOs$_4$Sb$_{12}$ under hydrostatic pressure. The results clarify that the 4$f$\nelectrons in this compound transform from delocalized at ambient pressure to\nlocalized at high pressures with a crossover pressure of approximately 0.7 GPa.\nThis drastic change in the 4$f$ electrons under pressure is apparently related\nto the non-Fermi liquid state, which appears in an intermediate-pressure range\nof 0.5-1.5 GPa. The results or our analysis strongly suggest that the\nferro-octupolar interaction becomes dominant at high pressure. Moreover, we\nreport the pressure dependence of the ultrasonic dispersion, which is due to\nrattling, over a wide range of ultrasonic frequencies up to 323 MHz. The\ndrastic change in the ultrasonic dispersions and the frequency dependent\nelastic anomaly in the $C_{11}$ mode at lower temperatures imply a possible\ncoupling between rattling phonons and 4$f$ electrons.\n", "  We present our observations of the low-mass eclipsing binary GJ~3236. We have\nanalyzed a phased $R_C$ light-curve and confirmed previously determined\nfundamental parameters of the components. We detected evolution of the spot(s)\nand found that there exists a large spot near a polar region of the primary\ncomponent and another spot either on the primary or the secondary component. We\nalso observed 7 flare events and determined a flare rate of about 0.1 flares\nper hour. We observed two high energy, long-term flares with a complex light\ncurve and possibly four weak short-term flaring events. A majority of the\nflares was detected in the $R_C$ filter, which indicate their high energy.\n", "  We identify gravitationally bound structures in the Ursa Major region using\npositions, velocities and photometry from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS\nDR7) and the Third Reference Catalogue of Bright Galaxies (RC3). A\nfriends-of-friends algorithm is extensively tested on mock galaxy lightcones\nand then implemented on the real data to determine galaxy groups whose members\nare likely to be physically and dynamically associated with one another. We\nfind several galaxy groups within the region that are likely bound to one\nanother and in the process of merging. We classify 6 galaxy groups as the Ursa\nMajor `supergroup', which are likely to merge and form a poor cluster with a\nmass of ~8x10^13 Msun. Furthermore, the Ursa Major supergroup as a whole is\nlikely bound to the Virgo cluster, which will eventually form an even larger\nsystem in the context of hierarchical structure formation. [abridged]\n", "  We report the bi-directional moving structures in a coronal bright point\n(CBP) on 2015 July 14. It is observed by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA)\nonboard Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). This CBP has a lifetime of about 10\nminutes, and a curved shape. The observations show that many bright structures\nare moving intermittently outward from the CBP brightness core. Such moving\nstructures are clearly seen at AIA 171, 193, 211, 131, 94, 335 and 304 A,\nslit-jaw (SJI) 1330 and 1400 A. In order to analyze these moving structures,\nthe CBP is cut along the moving direction with a curved slit from the AIA and\nSJI images. Then we can obtain the time-distance slices, including the\nintensity and intensity-derivative diagrams, from which, the moving structures\nare recognized as the oblique streaks, and they are characterized by the\nbi-direction, simultaneity, symmetry, and periodicity. The average speed is\naround 300 km/s, while the typically period is about 90 s. All these features\n(including the bi-directional flows and their periodicity) can be detected\nsimultaneously at all the 9 wavelengths. This CBP takes place at the site\nbetween a small pair of magnetic polarities. High time resolution observations\nshow that they are moving close to each other during its lifetime. These facts\nsupport the magnetic reconnection model of the CBP and the bi-directional\nmoving structures could be the observational outflows after the reconnection.\nTherefore, they can be as the direct observation evidence of the magnetic\nreconnection.\n", "  We study the $\\mu$-$e$ conversion in muonic atoms via an exchange of family\ngauge boson (FGB) $A_{2}^{\\ 1}$ in a $U(3)$ FGB model. Within the class of FGB\nmodel, we consider three types of family-number assignments for quarks. We\nevaluate the $\\mu$-$e$ conversion rate for various target nuclei, and find that\nnext generation $\\mu$-$e$ conversion search experiments can cover entire energy\nscale of the model for all of types of the quark family-number assignments. We\nshow that the conversion rate in the model is so sensitive to up- and\ndown-quark mixing matrices, $U^{u}$ and $U^{d}$, where the CKM matrix is given\nby $V_\\text{CKM} = U^{u\\dagger} U^d$. Precise measurements of conversion rates\nfor various target nuclei can identify not only the types of quark\nfamily-number assignments, but also each quark mixing matrix individually.\n", "  The results of a search for compact clusters in the vicinity of 19 IRAS\nsources based on data from the GPS UKIDSS and Spitzer GLIMPSE surveys are\npresented. Overall, clusters have been identified in 15 regions. Clusters are\nidentified for the first time in 4 regions (IRAS 18151-1208, IRAS 18316-0602,\n18517+0437, 19110+1045). In 5 regions (IRAS 05168+3634, 05358+3543, IRAS\n18507+0121, IRAS 20188+3928, IRAS 20198+3716) the compact groups we have\nidentified are substructures within more extended clusters. The radii of the\nidentified groups and the surface star density are widely scattered with ranges\nof 0.3-2.7 pc and 4-1360 stars/pc^2, respectively. In 11 of the clusters, the\nIRAS sources are associated with a pair or even a group of YSOs. The groups\nidentified in the near IR include representatives of a later evolutionary class\nII among the stellar objects associated with the IRAS sources.\n", "  We develop a Riemann-Hilbert approach to the inverse scattering transform\nmethod for the short pulse (SP) equation $u_{xt}=u+\\frac{1}{6}(u^3)_{xx}$ with\nzero boundary conditions (as $|x|\\to\\infty$). This approach is directly applied\nto the Lax pair for the SP equation. It allows us to give a parametric\nrepresentation of the solution to the Cauchy problem. This representation is\nthen used for studying the long-time behavior of the solution as well as for\nretrieving the soliton solutions. Finally, the analysis of the long-time\nbehavior allows us to formulate, in spectral terms, a sufficient condition for\nthe wave breaking.\n", "  Taking into account recent theoretical and experimental inputs on reactor\nfluxes we reconsider the determination of the weak mixing angle from low energy\nexperiments. We perform a global analysis to all available neutrino-electron\nscattering data from reactor antineutrino experiments, obtaining sin^2(theta_W)\n= 0.252 \\pm 0.030. We discuss the impact of the new theoretical prediction for\nthe neutrino spectrum, the new measurement of the reactor antineutrino spectrum\nby the Daya Bay collaboration, as well as the effect of radiative corrections.\nWe also reanalyze the measurements of the nu_e-e cross section at accelerator\nexperiments including radiative corrections. By combining reactor and\naccelerator data we obtain an improved determination for the weak mixing angle,\nsin^2(theta_W) = 0.254 \\pm 0.024.\n", "  We have studied the atomic and magnetic structure of the dilute ferromagnetic\nsemiconductor system (Ba,K)(Zn,Mn)$_2$As$_2$ through atomic and magnetic pair\ndistribution function analysis of temperature-dependent x-ray and neutron total\nscattering data. We detected a change in curvature of the temperature-dependent\nunit cell volume of the average tetragonal crystallographic structure at a\ntemperature coinciding with the onset of ferromagnetic order. We also observed\nthe existence of a well-defined local orthorhombic structure on a short length\nscale of $\\lesssim 5$ \\AA, resulting in a rather asymmetrical local environment\nof the Mn and As ions. Finally, the magnetic PDF revealed ferromagnetic\nalignment of Mn spins along the crystallographic $c$-axis, with robust\nnearest-neighbor ferromagnetic correlations that exist even above the\nferromagnetic ordering temperature. We discuss these results in the context of\nother experiments and theoretical studies on this system.\n", "  We present the result of the survey of sunspots and auroras in ${\\it\nQ\\bar{\\imath}ngsh\\check{\\imath}ga\\check{o}}$, the draft chronicle of ${\\it\nQ\\bar{\\imath}ng}$ dynasty, for the period of 1559-1912 CE, as a sequel of the\nseries of works surveying historical sunspot and aurora records, and providing\nonline data to the scientific community regarding the attained results. In\ntotal of this ${\\it Q\\bar{\\imath}ngsh\\check{\\imath}ga\\check{o}}$ survey, we\nfound 111 records of night-sky luminous events with the keywords such as vapor\n(${\\it q\\grave{\\imath}}$), cloud (${\\it y\\acute{u}n}$), and light (${\\it\ngu\\bar{a}ng}$), which may indicate auroras as well as some other phenomena.\nSimilarly keyword survey for sunspots were done, but no sunspot record was\nfound. In comparison with the aurora records in the western world, we found 14\nof the 111 records have a corresponding record of simultaneous observation in\nthe western world and hence are very likely to be aurora. In order to\ninvestigate the likeliness of the rest of the record being aurora, we\ncalculated the lunar age and the phase of a solar cycle for each record. After\nthese calculations, notable fraction of these records clustered near the full\nmoon were found statistically doubtful in considerations with atmospheric\noptics, meanwhile a few records near the new moon could be more likely\ninterpreted as auroras including three records during the Maunder minimum.\n", "  We investigate three barred lenticular galaxies (NGC 2681, NGC 3945 and NGC\n4371) which were previously reported to have complex central structures but\nwithout a detailed structural analysis of these galaxies' high-resolution data.\nWe have therefore performed four- to six-component\n(pseudo-)bulge/disk/bar/ring/point source) decompositions of the composite\n(Hubble Space Telescope plus ground-based) surface brightness profiles. We find\nthat NGC 2681 hosts three bars, while NGC 3945 and NGC 4371 are double- and\nsingle-barred galaxies, respectively, in agreement with past isophotal\nanalysis. We find that the bulges in these galaxies are compact, and have\nS\\'ersic indices of $n\\sim 2.2 - 3.6$ and stellar masses of $M_{*}$ $\\sim\n0.28\\times10^{10} - 1.1\\times10^{10} M_{\\sun}$. NGC 3945 and NGC 4371 have\nintermediate-scale `pseudo-bulges' that are well described by a S\\'ersic model\nwith low $n \\la 0.5$ instead of an exponential ($n=1$) profile as done in the\npast. We measure emission line fluxes enclosed within 9 different elliptical\napertures, finding that NGC 2681 has a LINER-type emission inside $R \\sim\n3\\arcsec$, but the emission line due to star formation is significant when\naperture size is increased. In contrast, NGC 3945 and NGC 4371 have composite\n(AGN plus star forming)- and LINER-type emissions inside and outside $R \\sim\n2\\arcsec$, respectively. Our findings suggest that the three galaxies have\nexperienced a complex evolutionary path. The bulges appear to be consequences\nof an earlier violent merging event while subsequent disk formation via gas\naccretion and bar-driven perturbations may account for the build-up of\npseudo-bulges, bars, rings and point sources.\n", "  Highly engineered materials are arousing great interest because of their\nability to manipulate heat, as described by coordinate transformation approach.\nBased on the recently developed analog gravity models, this paper presents how\na simple device based on nematic liquid crystal can achieve in principle either\nthermal concentration or expulsion. These outcomings are shown to stem from\ntopological properties of a disclination-like structure, induced in the nematic\nby anchoring conditions.\n", "  We trace the peripheral magnetic field structure of Bok globule CB130, by\nestimating the linear polarization of its field stars in the R band. The\nmagnetic field orientation sampled by these stars, aligned on average among\nthemselves and the polarization produced within the cloud has a different\ndirection from that of Galactic plane with an offset of 53$^\\circ$. The offset\nbetween minor axis and the mean magnetic field of CB130 is found to be\n80$^\\circ$. The estimated strength of the magnetic field in the\nplane-of-the-sky is $\\sim$ 116$\\pm$19 $\\mu$G. We constructed the visual\nextinction map using Near Infrared Color Excess (NICE) method to see the dust\ndistribution around CB130. Contours of Herschel {Herschel is an ESA space\nobservatory with science instruments provided by European-led Principal\nInvestigator consortia and with important participation from NASA} SPIRE\n500$\\mu$m dust continuum emission maps of this cloud is over-plotted on the\nvisual extinction map which shows the regions having higher optical extinction\ncorresponds to higher densities of dust. Three distinct high dust density cores\n(named as C1, C2, and C3) are identified in the extinction map. It is observed\nthat the cores C1 and C3 located close to two previously known cores CB130-1\nand CB130-2 respectively. Estimate of visual extinction of some moderately\nobscured stars of CB130 are made utilizing near-infra red photometry. Its\nobserved that there is a feeble dependence of polarization on extinction; and\npolarization efficiency (defined as $ \\textit{p}$/A$ {V}$) of the dust grains\ndecreases with the increase in extinction.\n", "  The Andromeda galaxy is observed to have a system of two large dwarf\nellipticals and ~13 smaller satellite galaxies that are currently co-rotating\nin a thin plane, in addition to 2 counter-rotating satellite galaxies. We\nexplored the consistency of those observations with a scenario where the\nmajority of the co-rotating satellite galaxies originated from a subhalo group,\nwhere NGC 205 was the host and the satellite galaxies occupied dark matter\nsub-subhalos. We ran N-body simulations of a close encounter between NGC 205\nand M31. In the simulations, NGC 205 was surrounded by massless particles to\nstatistically sample the distribution of the sub-subhalos expected in a subhalo\nthat has a mass similar to NGC 205. We made Monte Carlo samplings and found\nthat, using a set of reference parameters, the probability of producing a\nthinner distribution of sub-subhalos than the observed NGC 205 + 15 smaller\nsatellites (thus including the 2 counter-rotators, but excluding M32) increased\nfrom <1e-8 for the initial distribution to ~0.01 at pericentre. The probability\nof the simulated sub-subhalos occupying the locations of the observed\nco-rotating satellites in the line of sight velocity versus projected on-sky\ndistance plane is at most 0.002 for 11 out of 13 satellites. Increasing the\nmass of M31 and the extent of the initial distribution of sub-subhalos gives a\nmaximum probability of 0.004 for all 13 co-rotating satellites, but the\nprobability of producing the thinness would drop to ~ 0.001.\n", "  There have been discussions in the recent literature regarding the accuracy\nof the available electron impact excitation rates (equivalently effective\ncollision strengths $\\Upsilon$) for transitions in Be-like ions. In the present\npaper we demonstrate, once again, that earlier results for $\\Upsilon$ are\nindeed overestimated (by up to four orders of magnitude), for over 40\\% of\ntransitions and over a wide range of temperatures. To do this we have performed\ntwo sets of calculations for N~IV, with two different model sizes consisting of\n166 and 238 fine-structure energy levels. As in our previous work, for the\ndetermination of atomic structure the GRASP (General-purpose Relativistic\nAtomic Structure Package) is adopted and for the scattering calculations (the\nstandard and parallelised versions of) the Dirac Atomic R-matrix Code ({\\sc\ndarc}) are employed. Calculations for collision strengths and effective\ncollision strengths have been performed over a wide range of energy (up to\n45~Ryd) and temperature (up to 2.0$\\times$10$^6$~K), useful for applications in\na variety of plasmas. Corresponding results for energy levels, lifetimes and\nA-values for all E1, E2, M1 and M2 transitions among 238 levels of N~IV are\nalso reported.\n", "  We present spectra of the extreme polar AR Ursae Majoris (AR UMa) which\ndisplay a clear Al I absorption doublet, alongside spectra taken less than a\nyear earlier in which that feature is not present. Re-examination of earlier\nSDSS spectra indicates that the Al I absorption doublet was also present\n$\\approx$8 years before our first non-detection. We conclude that this\nabsorbing material is unlikely to be on the surface of either the white dwarf\n(WD) or the donor star. We suggest that this Al I absorption feature arises in\ncircumstellar material, perhaps produced by the evaporation of asteroids as\nthey approach the hot WD. The presence of any remaining reservoir of rocky\nmaterial in AR UMa might help to constrain the prior evolution of this unusual\nbinary system. We also apply spectral decomposition to find the stellar\nparameters of the M dwarf companion, and attempt to dynamically measure the\nmass of the WD in AR UMa by considering both the radial velocity curves of the\nH$_\\beta$ emission line and the Na I absorption line. Thereby we infer a mass\nrange for the WD in AR UMa of 0.91 $M_{\\odot}$ $<$ $M_{\\mathrm{WD}}$ $<$ 1.24\n$M_{\\odot}$.\n", "  Observation of interplanetary scintillation (IPS) beyond Earth-orbit can be\nchallenging due to the necessity to use low radio frequencies at which\nscintillation due to the ionosphere could confuse the interplanetary\ncontribution. A recent paper by Kaplan {\\it et al} (2015) presenting\nobservations using the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) reports evidence of\nnight-side IPS on two radio sources within their field of view. However, the\nlow time cadence of 2\\,s used might be expected to average out the IPS signal,\nresulting in the reasonable assumption that the scintillation is more likely to\nbe ionospheric in origin. To verify or otherwise this assumption, this letter\nuses observations of IPS taken at a high time cadence using the Low Frequency\nArray (LOFAR). Averaging these to the same as the MWA observations, we\ndemonstrate that the MWA result is consistent with IPS, although some\ncontribution from the ionosphere cannot be ruled out. These LOFAR observations\nrepresent the first of night-side IPS using LOFAR, with solar wind speeds\nconsistent with a slow solar wind stream in one observation and a CME expecting\nto be observed in another.\n", "  Fast jets are thought to be a crucial ingredient of star formation because\nthey might extract angular momentum from the disk and thus allow mass accretion\nonto the star. However, it is unclear whether jets are ubiquitous, and\nlikewise, their contribution to mass and angular momentum extraction during\nprotostar formation remains an open question.\n  Our aim is to investigate the ejection process in the low-mass Class 0\nprotostar L1157. This source is associated with a spectacular bipolar outflow,\nand the recent detection of high-velocity SiO suggests the occurrence of a jet.\n  Observations of CO 2-1 and SiO 5-4 at 0.8\" resolution were obtained with the\nIRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer as part of the CALYPSO large program. The\njet and outflow structure were fit with a precession model. We derived the\ncolumn density of CO and SiO, as well as the jet mass-loss rate and mechanical\nluminosity.\n  High-velocity CO and SiO emission resolve for the first time the first 200 au\nof the outflow-driving molecular jet. The jet is strongly asymmetric, with the\nblue lobe 0.65 times slower than the red lobe. This suggests that the\nlarge-scale asymmetry of the outflow is directly linked to the jet velocity and\nthat the asymmetry in the launching mechanism has been at work for the past\n1800 yr. Velocity asymmetries are common in T Tauri stars, which suggests that\nthe jet formation mechanism from Class 0 to Class II stages might be similar.\nOur model simultaneously fits the inner jet and the clumpy 0.2 pc scale outflow\nby assuming that the jet precesses counter-clockwise on a cone inclined by 73\ndegree to the line of sight with an opening angle of 8 degree on a period of\n1640 yr. The estimated jet mass flux and mechanical luminosity are 7.7e-7\nMsun/yr, and 0.9 Lsun, indicating that the jet could extract at least 25% of\nthe gravitational energy released by the forming star.\n", "  The Galactic plane has been mapped from l=34.75d to 45.25d and b=-5.25d to\n5.25d in the CO (J=1-0) emission with the 13.7 m telescope of the Purple\nMountain Observatory. The unbiased survey covers a large area of 100 square\ndegrees sampled every 30\" with a velocity resolution of ~0.2km/s. In this\npaper, we present the result of an unbiased CO survey of this longitude and\nlatitude range in the velocity range from -60km/s to -10km/s. Over 500\nmolecular clouds (MCs) are picked out from the 12CO emission, and 131 of these\nMCs are associated with 13CO emission.The distant MCs, which lie beyond the\nsolar circle and are mostly concentrated in the Galactic plane, trace the\nlarge-scale molecular gas structure over 10 degrees of Galactic azimuth. We\nsuggest that the CO emission of the segment is from the Outer Arm. The physical\nmid-plane traced by the Outer Arm seems to be slightly displaced from the\nIAU-defined plane on a large scale, which could be explained by the warped\nplane at large Galactocentric distances of >~10 kpc and the apparent tilted\nmid-plane to the projected IAU-defined plane caused by the Sun's z-height above\nthe disk for distances near and within the Solar circle. If the inner plane of\nour Galaxy is flat, we can derive an upper limit of the Sun's offset of ~17.1\npc above the physical mid-plane of the Milky Way. We also discuss the\ncorrelations between the physical parameters of the distant MCs, which is quite\nconsistent with the result of other studies of this parameter.\n", "  In this paper, we present a study of an M2.2 class solar flare of 26 November\n2000 from NOAA AR 9236. The flare was well observed by various ground based\nobservatories (ARIES, Learmonths Solar Observatory) and space borne instruments\n(SOHO, HXRS, GOES) in time interval between 02:30 UT to 04:00 UT. The flare\nstarted with long arc-shape outer flare ribbon. Afterwards the main flare\nstarts with two main ribbons. Initially the outer ribbons start to expand with\nan average speed ($\\sim$ 20 km s$^{-1}$) and later it shows contraction. The\nflare was associated with partial halo coronal mass ejection (CMEs) which has\naverage speed of 495 km s$^{-1}$. The SOHO/MDI observations show that the\nactive region was in quadrupolar magnetic configuration. The flux cancellation\nwas observed before the flare onset close to flare site. Our analysis indicate\nthe flare was initiated by the magnetic breakout mechanism.\n", "  In this manuscript, we show how conformal invariance can be incorporated in a\nclassical theory of gravitation, in the context of metric measure space. Metric\nmeasure space involves a geometrical scalar $f$, dubbed as density function,\nwhich here appears as a conformal degree of freedom. In this framework, we\npresent conformally invariant field equations, the relevant identities and\ngeodesic equations. In metric measure space, the volume element and accordingly\nthe operators with integral based definitions are modified. For instance, the\ndivergence operator in this space differs from the Riemannian one. As a result,\na gravitational theory formulated in this space has a generalized second\nBianchi identity and a generalized conservation of energy-momentum tensor. It\nis shown how, by using the generalized identity for conservation of\nenergy-momentum tensor, one can obtain a conformally invariant geodesic\nequation. By comparison of the geodesic equations in metric measure space with\nthe Bohmian trajectories, in both relativistic and non-relativistic regimes, a\nrelation between density function $f$ and the quantum potential is proposed.\nThis suggests metric measure space to be considered as a suitable framework for\ngeometric description of Bohm's quantum mechanics. On the other hand, as it is\nknown, Weyl geometry is one of the main approaches to construct conformally\ninvariant gravitational models. Regarding the fact that the connection in the\nintegrable Weyl space is modified and in metric measure space remains the same\nas it is in the Riemann space, the mathematical analogy between these two\nspaces is also discussed.\n", "  We present a muon spin relaxation study on the Ising pyrochlore\nNd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ which develops an \"all-in-all-out\" magnetic order below\n0.4~K. At 20~mK far below the ordering transition temperature, the zero-field\nmuon spin relaxation spectra show no static features and can be well described\nby a dynamical Gaussian-broadened Gaussian Kubo-Toyabe function indicating\nstrong fluctuations of the ordered state. The spectra of the paramagnetic state\n(below 4.2~K) reveal anomalously slow paramagnetic spin dynamics and show only\nsmall difference with the spectra of the ordered state. We find that the\nfluctuation rate decreases with decreasing temperature and becomes nearly\ntemperature independent below the transition temperature indicating persistent\nslow spin dynamics in the ground state. The field distribution width shows a\nsmall but sudden increase at the transition temperature and then becomes almost\nconstant. The spectra in applied longitudinal fields are well fitted by the\nconventional dynamical Gaussian Kubo-Toyabe function, which further supports\nthe dynamical nature of the ground state. The fluctuation rate shows a peak as\na function of external field which is associated with a field-induced spin-flip\ntransition. The strong dynamics in the ordered state are attributed to the\ntransverse coupling of the Ising spins introduced by the multipole\ninteractions.\n", "  Eta Carinae, the closest, active, massive binary containing a highly unstable\nLBV, exhibits expanding, compressed wind shells, seen in emission, that are\nspatially and spectrally resolved by \\hst/\\stis. Starting in June 2009, these\nstructures were mapped across its 5.54-year, highly elliptical, binary orbit to\nfollow temporal changes in the light of [Fe~III] 4659\\AA\\ and [Fe~II] 4815\\AA.\nThe emissions trace portions of fossil wind-shells, that were formed by\nwind-wind interactions across each cycle. Over the high-ionization state, dense\narcs, photo-ionized by far ultraviolet radiation from the hot secondary, are\nseen in [Fe~III]. Other arcs, ionized by mid-ultraviolet radiation from the\nprimary star, are seen in [Fe II]. The [Fe III] structures tend to be interior\nto [Fe II] structures that trace extensive, less disturbed primary wind. During\nthe brief periastron passage when the secondary plunges deep into the primary's\nextremely dense wind, on the far side of primary star, high-ionization [Fe III]\nstructures fade and reappear in [Fe II]. Multiple fossil wind-structures were\ntraced across the 5.7-year monitoring interval. The strong similarity of the\nexpanding [Fe II] shells suggests that the wind and photo-ionization properties\nof the massive binary have not changed substantially from one orbit to the next\nover the past several orbital cycles. These observations trace structures that\ncan be used to test three-dimensional hydrodynamical and radiative-transfer\nmodels of massive, interacting winds. They also provide a baseline for\nfollowing future changes in Eta Carinae, especially of its winds and\nphotoionization properties.\n", "  We consider the dark energy model with barotropic equation of state, which\ninteracts with dark matter through gravitation and another force, causing the\nenergy-momentum exchange between them. Both components are described in\napproximation of ideal fluids, which are parametrized by density and equation\nof state parameters. Three types of interactions between dark components are\nconsidered: the interaction independent from their densities, the one\nproportional to density of dark energy and the one proportional to density of\ndark matter. The equations which describe the expansion dynamics of homogeneous\nand isotropic Universe and evolution of densities of both components for\ndifferent values of interaction parameter are obtained on the bases of the\ngeneral covariant conservation equations and Einstein's ones. For three kinds\nof interactions we show the existence of the range of values of parameters of\ndark energy for which the densities of dark components and their sum are\nnegative. We find the conditions of positivity of density of dark energy and\ndark matter. The constraints on the value of parameter of interaction are\nderived. The dynamics of expansion of the Universe with these interactions of\ndark energy and dark matter is analysed.\n", "  We present a method designed to efficiently extract optical signals from\nInGaAs avalanche photodiodes (APDs) operated in gated mode. In particular, our\nmethod permits an estimation of the fraction of counts which actually results\nfrom the signal being measured, as opposed to being produced by noise\nmechanisms, specifically by afterpulsing. Our method in principle allows the\nuse of InGaAs APDs at high detection efficiencies, with the full operation\nbandwidth, either with or without resorting to the application of a dead time.\nAs we show below, our method can be used in configurations where afterpulsing\nexceeds the genuine signal by orders of magnitude, even near saturation. The\nalgorithms which we have developed are suitable to be used either in real-time\nprocessing of raw detection probabilities or in post-processing applications,\nafter a calibration step has been performed. The algorithms which we propose\nhere can complement technologies designed for the reduction of afterpulsing.\n", "  We predict the evolution of galaxy scaling relationships from cosmological,\nhydrodynamical simulations, that reproduce the scaling relations of present-day\ngalaxies. Although we do not assume co-evolution between galaxies and black\nholes a priori, we are able to reproduce the black hole mass--velocity\ndispersion relation. This relation does not evolve, and black holes actually\ngrow along the relation from significantly less massive seeds than have\npreviously been used. AGN feedback does not very much affect the chemical\nevolution of our galaxies. In our predictions, the stellar mass--metallicity\nrelation does not change its shape, but the metallicity significantly increases\nfrom $z\\sim2$ to $z\\sim1$, while the gas-phase mass-metallicity relation does\nchange shape, having a steeper slope at higher redshifts ($z\\lesssim3$).\nFurthermore, AGN feedback is required to reproduce observations of the most\nmassive galaxies at $z\\lesssim1$, specifically their positions on the star\nformation main sequence and galaxy mass--size relation.\n", "  Radio polarisation images of the jets of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) can\nprovide a deep insight into the launching and collimation mechanisms of\nrelativistic jets. However, even at VLBI scales, resolution is often a limiting\nfactor in the conclusions that can be drawn from observations. The Maximum\nEntropy Method (MEM) is a deconvolution algorithm that can outperform the more\ncommon CLEAN algorithm in many cases, particularly when investigating\nstructures present on scales comparable to or smaller than the nominal beam\nsize with \"super-resolution\". A new implementation of the MEM suitable for\nsingle- or multiple-wavelength VLBI polarisation observations has been\ndeveloped and is described here. Monte Carlo simulations comparing the\nperformances of CLEAN and MEM at reconstructing the properties of model images\nare presented; these demonstrate the enhanced reliability of MEM over CLEAN\nwhen images of the fractional polarisation and polarisation angle are\nconstructed using convolving beams that are appreciably smaller than the full\nCLEAN beam. The results of using this new MEM software to image VLBA\nobservations of the AGN 0716+714 at six different wavelengths are presented,\nand compared to corresponding maps obtained with CLEAN. MEM and CLEAN maps of\nStokes $I$, the polarised flux, the fractional polarisation and the\npolarisation angle are compared for convolving beams ranging from the full\nCLEAN beam down to a beam one-third of this size. MEM's ability to provide more\ntrustworthy polarisation imaging than a standard CLEAN-based deconvolution when\nconvolving beams appreciably smaller than the full CLEAN beam are used is\ndiscussed.\n", "  We present near-infrared polarimetric observations of the black hole X-ray\nbinaries Swift J1357.2-0933 and A0620-00. In both sources, recent studies have\ndemonstrated the presence of variable infrared synchrotron emission in\nquiescence, most likely from weak compact jets. For Swift J1357.2-0933 we find\nthat the synchrotron emission is polarized at a level of 8.0 +- 2.5 per cent (a\n3.2 sigma detection of intrinsic polarization). The mean magnitude and rms\nvariability of the flux (fractional rms of 19-24 per cent in K_s-band) agree\nwith previous observations. These properties imply a continuously launched\n(stable on long timescales), highly variable (on short timescales) jet in the\nSwift J1357.2-0933 system in quiescence, which has a moderately tangled\nmagnetic field close to the base of the jet. We find that for A0620-00, there\nare likely to be three components to the optical-infrared polarization;\ninterstellar dust along the line of sight, scattering within the system, and an\nadditional source that changes the polarization position angle in the reddest\n(H and K_s) wave-bands. We interpret this as a stronger contribution of\nsynchrotron emission, and by subtracting the line-of-sight polarization, we\nmeasure an excess of ~ 1.25 +- 0.28 per cent polarization and a position angle\nof the magnetic field vector that is consistent with being parallel with the\naxis of the resolved radio jet. These results imply that weak jets in low\nluminosity accreting systems have magnetic fields which possess similarly\ntangled fields compared to the more luminous, hard state jets in X-ray\nbinaries.\n", "  The recent advent of spatially resolved mm- and cm-wavelength polarimetry in\nprotostellar accretion discs could help clarify the role of magnetic fields in\nthe angular momentum transport in these systems. The best case to date is that\nof HL~Tau, where the inability to produce a good fit to the 1.25-mm data with a\ncombination of vertical and azimuthal magnetic field components was interpreted\nas implying that centrifugally driven winds (CDWs) are probably not a\nsignificant transport mechanism on the $\\sim 10^2\\,$au scale probed by the\nobservations. Using synthetic polarization maps of heuristic\nsingle-field-component discs and of a post-processed simulation of a\nwind-driving disc, we demonstrate that a much better fit to the data can be\nobtained if the radial field component, a hallmark of the CDW mechanism,\ndominates in the polarized emission region. A similar inference was previously\nmade in modelling the far-infrared polarization map of the pc-scale dust ring\nin the Galactic centre. To reconcile this interpretation with theoretical\nmodels of protostellar discs, which indicate that the wind is launched from a\ncomparatively high elevation above the mid-plane, we propose that most of the\npolarized emission originates -- with a high ($\\ga 10$\\%) intrinsic degree of\npolarization -- in small ($\\la 0.1\\,$mm) grains that remain suspended above the\nmid-plane, and that the bulk of the mm-wavelength emission is produced -- with\nlow intrinsic polarization -- by larger grains that have settled to the\nmid-plane.\n", "  We investigated the convexity of all type I X-ray bursts with millihertz\nquasi-periodic oscillations (mHz QPOs) in 4U 1636-53 using archival\nobservations with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. We found that, at a 3.5\n$\\sigma$ confidence level, in all 39 cases in which the mHz QPOs disappeared at\nthe time of an X-ray burst, the convexity of the burst is positive. The\nconvexity measures the shape of the rising part of the burst light curve and,\naccording to recent models, it is related to the ignition site of bursts on the\nneutron star surface. This finding suggests that in 4U 1636-53 these 39 bursts\nand the marginally-stable nuclear burning process responsible for the mHz QPOs\ntake place at the neutron-star equator. This scenario could explain the\ninconsistency between the high accretion rate required for triggering mHz QPOs\nin theoretical models and the relatively low accretion rate derived from\nobservations.\n", "  In order to study the nature, origin, and impact of turbulent velocity\nfluctuations in the ionized gas of the Orion Nebula, we apply a variety of\nstatistical techniques to observed velocity cubes. The cubes are derived from\nhigh resolving power ($R \\approx 40,000$) longslit spectroscopy of optical\nemission lines that span a range of ionizations. From Velocity Channel Analysis\n(VCA), we find that the slope of the velocity power spectrum is consistent with\npredictions of Kolmogorov theory between scales of 8 and 22 arcsec (0.02 to\n0.05 pc). The outer scale, which is the dominant scale of density fluctuations\nin the nebula, approximately coincides with the autocorrelation length of the\nvelocity fluctuations that we determine from the second order velocity\nstructure function. We propose that this is the principal driving scale of the\nturbulence, which originates in the autocorrelation length of dense cores in\nthe Orion molecular filament. By combining analysis of the non-thermal line\nwidths with the systematic trends of velocity centroid versus ionization, we\nfind that the global champagne flow and smaller scale turbulence each\ncontribute in equal measure to the total velocity dispersion, with respective\nroot-mean-square widths of 4-5 km/s. The turbulence is subsonic and can account\nfor only one half of the derived variance in ionized density, with the\nremaining variance provided by density gradients in photoevaporation flows from\nglobules and filaments. Intercomparison with results from simulations implies\nthat the ionized gas is confined to a thick shell and does not fill the\ninterior of the nebula.\n", "  Long coherence times and fast gate operations are desirable but often\nconflicting requirements for physical qubits. This conflict can be resolved by\nresorting to fast qubits for operations, and by storing their state in a\n`quantum memory' while idle. The $^{31}$P donor in silicon comes naturally\nequipped with a fast qubit (the electron spin) and a long-lived qubit (the\n$^{31}$P nuclear spin), coexisting in a bound state at cryogenic temperatures.\nHere, we demonstrate storage and retrieval of quantum information from a single\ndonor electron spin to its host phosphorus nucleus in isotopically-enriched\n$^{28}$Si. The fidelity of the memory process is characterised via both state\nand process tomography. We report an overall process fidelity of $F_p\n=$81${\\pm}$7%, a memory fidelity ($F_m$) of over 90%, and memory storage times\nup to 80 ms. These values are limited by a transient shift of the electron spin\nresonance frequency following high-power radiofrequency pulses.\n", "  Molecular oxygen has been confirmed as the fourth most abundant molecule in\ncometary material O$_2$/H$_2$O $\\sim 4$ %) and is thought to have a primordial\nnature, i.e., coming from the interstellar cloud from which our solar system\nwas formed. However, interstellar O$_2$ gas is notoriously difficult to detect\nand has only been observed in one potential precursor of a solar-like system.\nHere, the chemical and physical origin of O$_2$ in comets is investigated using\nsophisticated astrochemical models. Three origins are considered: i) in dark\nclouds, ii) during forming protostellar disks, and iii) during luminosity\noutbursts in disks. The dark cloud models show that reproduction of the\nobserved abundance of O$_2$ and related species in comet 67P/C-G requires a low\nH/O ratio facilitated by a high total density ($\\geq 10^5$ cm$^{-3}$), and a\nmoderate cosmic ray ionisation rate ($\\leq 10^{-16}$ s$^{-1}$) while a\ntemperature of 20 K, slightly higher than the typical temperatures found in\ndark clouds, also enhances the production of O$_2$. Disk models show that O$_2$\ncan only be formed in the gas phase in intermediate disk layers, and cannot\nexplain the strong correlation between O$_2$ and H$_2$O in comet 67P/C-G\ntogether with the weak correlation between other volatiles and H$_2$O. However,\nprimordial O$_2$ ice can survive transport into the comet-forming regions of\ndisks. Taken together, these models favour a dark cloud (or \"primordial\")\norigin for O$_2$ in comets, albeit for dark clouds which are warmer and denser\nthan those usually considered as solar system progenitors.\n", "  The Teff = 20,800 K white dwarf WD 1536+520 is shown to have broadly solar\nabundances of the major rock forming elements O, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, and Fe,\ntogether with a strong relative depletion in the volatile elements C and S. In\naddition to the highest metal abundances observed to date, including log(O/He)\n= -3.4, the helium-dominated atmosphere has an exceptional hydrogen abundance\nat log(H/He) = -1.7. Within the uncertainties, the metal-to-metal ratios are\nconsistent with the accretion of an H2O-rich and rocky parent body, an\ninterpretation supported by the anomalously high trace hydrogen. The mixed\natmosphere yields unusually short diffusion timescales for a helium atmosphere\nwhite dwarf, of no more than a few hundred yr, and equivalent to those in a\nmuch cooler, hydrogen-rich star. The overall heavy element abundances of the\ndisrupted parent body deviate modestly from a bulk Earth pattern, and suggest\nthe deposition of some core-like material. The total inferred accretion rate is\n4.2e9 g/s, and at least 4 times higher than any white dwarf with a comparable\ndiffusion timescale. Notably, when accretion is exhausted in this system, both\nmetals and hydrogen will become undetectable within roughly 300 Myr, thus\nsupporting a scenario where the trace hydrogen is related to the ongoing\naccretion of planetary debris.\n", "  We present optical spectroscopy and near-infrared photometry of 57 faint ($g=\n19-22$) high proper motion white dwarfs identified through repeat imaging of\n$\\approx3100$ square degrees of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey footprint by Munn\net al. (2014). We use $ugriz$ and $JH$ photometry to perform a model atmosphere\nanalysis, and identify ten ultracool white dwarfs with $T_{\\rm eff}<4000$ K,\nincluding the coolest pure H atmosphere white dwarf currently known,\nJ1657+2638, with $T_{\\rm eff}= 3550 \\pm 100$K. The majority of the objects with\ncooling ages larger than 9 Gyr display thick disc kinematics and constrain the\nage of the thick disc to $\\geq11$ Gyr. There are four white dwarfs in our\nsample with large tangential velocities ($v_{tan} > 120$ km $s^{-1}$) and UVW\nvelocities that are more consistent with the halo than the Galactic disc. For\ntypical $0.6 M_{\\odot}$ white dwarfs, the cooling ages for these halo\ncandidates range from 2.3 to 8.5 Gyr. However, the total main-sequence + white\ndwarf cooling ages of these stars would be consistent with the Galactic halo if\nthey are slightly undermassive. Given the magnitude limits of the current large\nscale surveys, many of the coolest and oldest white dwarfs remain undiscovered\nin the solar neighborhood, but upcoming surveys such as GAIA and the Large\nSynoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) should find many of these elusive thick disc\nand halo white dwarfs.\n", "  In this paper, we study the chaotic four-body problem in Newtonian gravity.\nAssuming point particles and total encounter energies $\\le$ 0, the problem has\nthree possible outcomes. We describe each outcome as a series of discrete\ntransformations in energy space, using the diagrams first presented in Leigh \\&\nGeller (2012; see the Appendix). Furthermore, we develop a formalism for\ncalculating probabilities for these outcomes to occur, expressed using the\ndensity of escape configurations per unit energy, and based on the Monaghan\ndescription originally developed for the three-body problem. We compare this\nanalytic formalism to results from a series of binary-binary encounters with\nidentical point particles, simulated using the \\texttt{FEWBODY} code. Each of\nour three encounter outcomes produces a unique velocity distribution for the\nescaping star(s). Thus, these distributions can potentially be used to\nconstrain the origins of dynamically-formed populations, via a direct\ncomparison between the predicted and observed velocity distributions. Finally,\nwe show that, for encounters that form stable triples, the simulated single\nstar escape velocity distributions are the same as for the three-body problem.\nThis is also the case for the other two encounter outcomes, but only at low\nvirial ratios. This suggests that single and binary stars processed via\nsingle-binary and binary-binary encounters in dense star clusters should have a\nunique velocity distribution relative to the underlying Maxwellian distribution\n(provided the relaxation time is sufficiently long), which can be calculated\nanalytically.\n", "  EPIC 204278916 has been serendipitously discovered from its K2 light curve\nwhich displays irregular dimmings of up to 65% for ~25 consecutive days out of\n78.8 days of observations. For the remaining duration of the observations, the\nvariability is highly periodic and attributed to stellar rotation. The star is\na young, low-mass (M-type) pre-main-sequence star with clear evidence of a\nresolved tilted disk from ALMA observations. We examine the K2 light curve in\ndetail and hypothesise that the irregular dimmings are caused by either a\nwarped inner-disk edge or transiting cometary-like objects in either circular\nor eccentric orbits. The explanations discussed here are particularly relevant\nfor other recently discovered young objects with similar absorption dips.\n", "  A number of recent observational studies of Galactic globular clusters have\nmeasured the variation in the slope of a cluster's stellar mass function\n$\\alpha$ with clustercentric distance $r$. In order to gather a deeper\nunderstanding of the information contained in such observations, we have\nexplored the evolution of $\\alpha(r)$ for star clusters with a variety of\ninitial conditions using a large suite of $N$-body simulations. We have\nspecifically studied how the time evolution of $\\alpha(r)$ is affected by\ninitial size, mass, binary fraction, primordial mass segregation, black hole\nretention, an external tidal field, and the initial mass function itself.\nPrevious studies have shown that the evolution of $\\alpha_G$ is closely related\nto the amount of mass loss suffered by a cluster. Hence for each simulation we\nhave also followed the evolution of the slope of the cluster's global stellar\nmass function, $\\alpha_G$, and have shown that clusters follow a well-defined\ntrack in the $\\alpha_G$-$d\\alpha(r)/d(ln(r/r_m))$ plane. The location of a\ncluster on the $\\alpha_G-d\\alpha(r)/d(ln(r/r_m))$ plane can therefore constrain\nits dynamical history and, in particular, constrain possible variations in the\nstellar initial mass function. The $\\alpha_G$-$d\\alpha(r)/d(ln(r/r_m))$ plane\nthus serves as a key tool for fully exploiting the information contained in\nwide field studies of cluster stellar mass functions.\n", "  The potential existence of a distant planet (\"Planet Nine\") in the Solar\nsystem has prompted a re-think about the evolution of planetary systems. As the\nSun transitions from a main sequence star into a white dwarf, Jupiter, Saturn,\nUranus and Neptune are currently assumed to survive in expanded but otherwise\nunchanged orbits. However, a sufficiently-distant and sufficiently-massive\nextra planet would alter this quiescent end scenario through the combined\neffects of Solar giant branch mass loss and Galactic tides. Here, I estimate\nbounds for the mass and orbit of a distant extra planet that would incite\nfuture instability in systems with a Sun-like star and giant planets with\nmasses and orbits equivalent to those of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. I\nfind that this boundary is diffuse and strongly dependent on each of the\ndistant planet's orbital parameters. Nevertheless, I claim that instability\noccurs more often than not when the planet is as massive as Jupiter and\nharbours a semimajor axis exceeding about 300 au, or has a mass of a\nsuper-Earth and a semimajor axis exceeding about 3000 au. These results hold\nfor orbital pericentres ranging from 100 to at least 400 au. This instability\nscenario might represent a common occurrence, as potentially evidenced by the\nubiquity of metal pollution in white dwarf atmospheres throughout the Galaxy.\n", "  In this contribution, we present the unquenched quark model as an extension\nof the constituent quark model that includes the effects of sea quarks via a\n$^{3}P_{0}$ quark-antiquark pair-creation mechanism. Particular attention is\npaid to the spin and flavor content of the proton, magnetic moments and $\\beta$\ndecays of octet baryons.\n", "  We study the phase behaviour and the collective dynamics of interacting\nparamagnetic colloids assembled above a honeycomb lattice of triangular shaped\nmagnetic minima. A frustrated colloidal molecular crystal is realized when\nfilling these potential minima with exactly two particles per pinning site.\nExternal in-plane rotating fields are used to anneal the system into different\nphases, including long range ordered stripes, random fully packed loops,\nlabyrinth and disordered states. At higher amplitude of the annealing field,\nthe dimer lattice displays a two step melting transition where the initially\nimmobile dimers perform first localized rotations and later break up by\nexchanging particles across consecutive lattice minima.\n", "  A model has been developed that illustrates the emergence of C60 from the\ncondensing carbon vapor. It is shown to depend upon the decreasing heats of\nformation for larger cages, exponentially increasing number of isomers for\nfullerenes that are larger than C60, large cages buckling induced by the\npentagon-related protrusions that initiate fragmentation, the structural\ninstability induces fragmentation that shrinks large cages and an evolving gas\nof C2 that is crucial to the whole process. The model describes a mechanism for\nthe provision and presence of plenty of C2 during the formation and\nfragmentation processes. The bottom-up formations of large cages followed by\nthe top-down cage shrinkage are shown to be stable, dynamical processes that\nlead to the C60 dominated fullerene ensemble.\n", "  We present OSIRIS/NAC observations of decimetre-sized, likely ice-containing\naggregates ejected from a confined region on the surface of comet\n67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The images were obtained in January 2016 when the\ncomet was at 2 AU from the Sun out-bound from perihelion. We measure the\nacceleration of individual aggregates through a two-hour image series.\nApproximately 50% of the aggregates are accelerated away from the nucleus, and\n50% towards it, and likewise towards either horizontal direction. The\naccelerations are up to one order of magnitude stronger than local gravity, and\nare most simply explained by the combined effect of gas drag accelerating all\naggregates upwards, and the recoil force from asymmetric outgassing, either\nfrom rotating aggregates with randomly oriented spin axes and sufficient\nthermal inertia to shift the temperature maximum away from an aggregate's\nsubsolar region, or from aggregates with variable ice content. At least 10% of\nthe aggregates will escape the gravity field of the nucleus and feed the\ncomet's debris trail, while others may fall back to the surface and contribute\nto the deposits covering parts of the northern hemisphere. The rocket force\nplays a crucial role in pushing these aggregates back towards the surface. Our\nobservations show the future back fall material in the process of ejection, and\nprovide the first direct measurement of the acceleration of aggregates in the\ninnermost coma (<2km) of a comet, where gas drag is still significant.\n", "  The suppression of friction between sliding objects, modulated or enhanced by\nmechanical vibrations, is well established. However, the precise conditions of\noccurrence of these phenomena is not well understood. Here we address these\nquestions focusing on a simple spring--block model, which is relevant to\ninvestigate friction both at the atomistic as well as the macroscopic scale.\nThis allows to investigate the influence on friction of the properties of the\nexternal drive, of the geometry of the surfaces over which the block moves, and\nof the confining force. Via numerical simulations and a theoretical study of\nthe equations of motion we identify the conditions under which friction is\nsuppressed and/or recovered, and evidence the critical role played by surface\nmodulations and by the properties of the confining force.\n", "  Dimension-five photon $(\\gamma )$ scalar $(\\phi)$ interaction terms usually\nappear in the bosonic sector of unified theories of electromagnetism and\ngravity. In these theories the three propagation eigenstates are different from\nthe three field eigenstates. The dispersion relation in an external magnetic\nfield shows that, for a non- zero energy $(\\omega)$, out of the three\npropagating eigenstates one has superluminal phase velocity $v_p$. During\npropagation, another eigenstate undergoes amplification or attenuation, showing\nsigns of an unstable system. The remaining one maintains causality. In this\npaper, using techniques from optics as well as gravity, we identify the energy\n$(\\omega)$ interval outside which $v_p \\le c$ for the field eigenstates\n$|\\gamma_{\\parallel} > $ and $ |\\phi > $, and stability of the system is\nrestored. The behavior of group velocity $v_g$ is also explored in the same\ncontext. We conclude by pointing out its possible astrophysical implications.\n", "  We model the behaviour of dust grains entrained by photoevaporation-driven\nwinds from protoplanetary discs assuming a non-rotating, plane-parallel disc.\nWe obtain an analytic expression for the maximum entrainable grain size in\nextreme-UV radiation-driven winds, which we demonstrate to be proportional to\nthe mass loss rate of the disc. When compared with our hydrodynamic\nsimulations, the model reproduces almost all of the wind properties for the gas\nand dust. In typical turbulent discs, the entrained grain sizes in the wind are\nsmaller than the theoretical maximum everywhere but the inner disc due to dust\nsettling.\n", "  We report on the discovery of two Fast X-ray Transients (FXTs) from analysis\nof archival INTEGRAL data. Both are characterized by a remarkable hard X-ray\nactivity above 20 keV, in term of duration (about 15 and 30 minutes,\nrespectively), peak-flux (about 10^-9 erg cm^-2 s^-1) and dynamic range (about\n2400 and 1360, respectively). Swift/XRT follow-up observations failed to detect\nany quiescent or low level soft X-ray emission from either of the two FXTs,\nproviding an upper limit of the order of a few times 10^-12 erg cm^-2 s^-1. The\nmain spectral and temporal IBIS/ISGRI characteristics are presented and\ndiscussed with the aim of infering possible hints on their nature.\n", "  We study the effects of heat blanketing envelopes of neutron stars on their\ncooling. To this aim, we perform cooling simulations using newly constructed\nmodels of the envelopes composed of binary ion mixtures (H--He, He--C, C--Fe)\nvarying the mass of lighter ions (H, He or C) in the envelope. The results are\ncompared with those calculated using the standard models of the envelopes which\ncontain the layers of lighter (accreted) elements (H, He and C) on top of the\nFe layer, varying the mass of accreted elements. The main effect is that the\nchemical composition of the envelopes influences their thermal conductivity\nand, hence, thermal insulation of the star. For illustration, we apply these\nresults to estimate the internal temperature of the Vela pulsar and to study\nthe cooling of neutron stars of ages of 0.1 - 1 Myr at the photon cooling\nstage. The uncertainties of the cooling models associated with our poor\nknowledge of chemical composition of the heat insulating envelopes strongly\ncomplicate theoretical reconstruction of the internal structure of cooling\nneutron stars from observations of their thermal surface emission.\n", "  We construct a suite of discrete chemo-dynamical models of the giant\nelliptical galaxy NGC 5846. These models are a powerful tool to constrain both\nthe mass distribution and internal dynamics of multiple tracer populations. We\nuse Jeans models to simultaneously fit stellar kinematics within the effective\nradius $R_{\\rm e}$, planetary nebula (PN) radial velocities out to $3\\, R_{\\rm\ne}$, and globular cluster (GC) radial velocities and colours out to $6\\,R_{\\rm\ne}$. The best-fitting model is a cored DM halo which contributes $\\sim 10\\%$ of\nthe total mass within $1\\,R_{\\rm e}$, and $67\\% \\pm 10\\%$ within $6\\,R_{\\rm\ne}$, although a cusped DM halo is also acceptable. The red GCs exhibit mild\nrotation with $v_{\\rm max}/\\sigma_0 \\sim 0.3$ in the region $R > \\,R_{\\rm e}$,\naligned with but counter-rotating to the stars in the inner parts, while the\nblue GCs and PNe kinematics are consistent with no rotation. The red GCs are\ntangentially anisotropic, the blue GCs are mildly radially anisotropic, and the\nPNe vary from radially to tangentially anisotropic from the inner to the outer\nregion. This is confirmed by general made-to-measure models. The tangential\nanisotropy of the red GCs in the inner regions could stem from the preferential\ndestruction of red GCs on more radial orbits, while their outer tangential\nanisotropy -- similar to the PNe in this region -- has no good explanation. The\nmild radial anisotropy of the blue GCs is consistent with an accretion\nscenario.\n", "  We present a new discrete chemo-dynamical axisymmetric modeling technique,\nwhich we apply to the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Sculptor. The major improvement\nover previous Jeans models is that realistic chemical distributions are\nincluded directly in the dynamical modelling of the discrete data. This avoids\nloss of information due to spatial binning and eliminates the need for hard\ncuts to remove contaminants and to separate stars based on their chemical\nproperties. Using a combined likelihood in position, metallicity and\nkinematics, we find that our models naturally separate Sculptor stars into a\nmetal-rich and a metal-poor population. Allowing for non-spherical symmetry,\nour approach provides a central slope of the dark matter density of $\\gamma =\n0.5 \\pm 0.3$. The metal-rich population is nearly isotropic (with\n$\\beta_r^{red} = 0.0\\pm0.1$) while the metal-poor population is tangentially\nanisotropic (with $\\beta_r^{blue} = -0.2\\pm0.1$) around the half light radius\nof $0.26$ kpc. A weak internal rotation of the metal-rich population is\nrevealed with $v_{max}/\\sigma_0 = 0.15 \\pm 0.15$. We run tests using mock data\nto show that a discrete dataset with $\\sim 6000$ stars is required to\ndistinguish between a core ($\\gamma = 0$) and cusp ($\\gamma = 1$), and to\nconstrain the possible internal rotation to better than $1\\,\\sigma$ confidence\nwith our model. We conclude that our discrete chemo-dynamical modelling\ntechnique provides a flexible and powerful tool to robustly constrain the\ninternal dynamics of multiple populations, and the total mass distribution in a\nstellar system.\n", "  We present a disc-halo N-body model of the low surface brightness galaxy UGC\n628, one of the few systems that harbours a \"slow\" bar with a ratio of\ncorotation radius to bar length of $\\mathcal{R} \\equiv R_c/a_b \\sim 2$. We\nselect our initial conditions using SDSS DR10 photometry, a physically\nmotivated radially variable mass-to-light ratio profile, and rotation curve\ndata from the literature. A global bar instability grows in our submaximal disc\nmodel, and the disc morphology and dynamics agree broadly with the photometry\nand kinematics of UGC 628 at times between peak bar strength and the onset of\nbuckling. Prior to bar formation, the disc and halo contribute roughly equally\nto the potential in the galaxy's inner region, giving the disc enough self\ngravity for bar modes to grow. After bar formation there is significant mass\nredistribution, creating a baryon dominated inner and dark matter dominated\nouter disc. This implies that, unlike most other low surface brightness\ngalaxies, UGC 628 is not dark matter dominated everywhere. Our model\nnonetheless implies that UGC 628 falls on same the relationship between dark\nmatter fraction and rotation velocity found for high surface brightness\ngalaxies, and lends credence to the argument that the disc mass fraction\nmeasured at the location where its contribution to the potential peaks is not a\nreliable indicator of its dynamical importance at all radii.\n", "  The thermal radio and sub-mm emission from the winds of massive stars is\ninvestigated and the contribution to the emission due to the stellar wind\nacceleration region and clumping of the wind is quantified. Building upon\nestablished theory, a method for calculating the thermal radio and sub-mm\nemission using results for a line-driven stellar outflow according to Castor,\nAbbott & Klein (1975) is presented. The results show strong variation of the\nspectral index for 10 2 GHz < {\\nu} < 10 4 GHz. This corresponds both to the\nwind acceleration region and clumping of the wind, leading to a strong\ndependence on the wind velocity law and clumping parameters. The Atacama Large\nMillimeter/sub-mm Array (ALMA) is the first observatory to have both the\nspectral window and sensitivity to observe at the high frequencies required to\nprobe the acceleration regions of massive stars. The deviations in the\npredicted flux levels as a result of the inclusion of the wind acceleration\nregion and clumping are sufficient to be detected by ALMA, through deviations\nin the spectral index in different portions of the radio/sub-mm spectra of\nmassive stars, for a range of reasonable mass-loss rates and distances.\nConsequently both mechanisms need to be included to fully understand the\nmass-loss rates of massive stars.\n", "  Often it is desirable to stabilize a system around an optimal state. This can\nbe effectively accomplished using feedback control, where the system deviation\nfrom the desired state is measured in order to determine the magnitude of the\nrestoring force to be applied. Contrary to conventional wisdom, i.e. that a\nmore precise measurement is expected to improve the system stability, here we\ndemonstrate that a certain degree of measurement error can improve the system\nstability. We exemplify the implications of this finding with numerical\nexamples drawn from various fields, such as the operation of a temperature\ncontroller, the confinement of a microscopic particle, the localization of a\ntarget by a microswimmer, and the control of a population.\n", "  In the third paper of this series we continue the exploitation of Kepler/K2\ndata in dense stellar fields using our PSF-based method. This work is focused\non a ~720-arcmin^2 region centred on the Solar-metallicity and Solar-age open\ncluster M 67. We extracted light curves for all detectable sources in the\nKepler channels 13 and 14, adopting our technique based on the usage of a\nhigh-angular-resolution input catalogue and target-neighbour subtraction. We\ndetrended light curves for systematic errors, and searched for variables and\nexoplanets using several tools. We found 451 variables, of which 299 are new\ndetection. Three planetary candidates were detected by our pipeline in this\nfield. Raw and detrended light curves, catalogues, and K2 stacked images used\nin this work will be released to the community.\n", "  A continuum elastic model of fullerenes is presented by utilizing the analogy\nbetween the closed carbon cages and elastic shells. We derive expressions for\nthe curvature related strain energies Ep of the pentagonal protrusions. We\npropose to explain the observed sphericity of the carbon onions shells as\nopposed to the predicted protrusions around the pentagonal defects on the basis\nof our continuum elastic model of fullerenes. In our model the energy inherent\nin the pentagonal protrusions Ep is due to the stretching and bending of the\nshell and shown to be a function of the structural parameters. It also defines\nthe upper limit on the size of the free-standing fullerenes. Using Ep and the\ntopological arguments, we show that the pentagonal protrusions will be smoothed\nout, resulting in spherical shells of the carbon onions denoted as\nC60@C240@C540@C960@C1500 ,... .\n", "  Jets, from the protostellar to the AGN context, have been extensively studied\nbut their connection to the turbulent dynamics of the underlying accretion disc\nis poorly understood. Following a similar approach to Lesur et al. (2013), we\nexamine the role of the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in the production\nand acceleration of outflows from discs. Via a suite of one-dimensional\nshearing-box simulations of stratified discs we show that magneto-centrifugal\nwinds exhibit cyclic activity with a period of 10-20 Omega^{-1}, a few times\nthe orbital period. The cycle seems to be more vigorous for strong vertical\nfield; it is robust to the variation of relevant parameters and independent of\nnumerical details. The convergence of these solutions (in particular the mass\nloss rate) with vertical box size is also studied. By considering a sequence of\nmagnetohydrostatic equilibria and their stability, the periodic activity may be\nunderstood as the succession of the following phases: (a) a dominant MRI\nchannel mode, (b) strong magnetic field generation, (c) consequent wind\nlaunching, and ultimately (d) vertical expulsion of the excess magnetic field\nby the expanding and accelerating gas associated with the wind. We discuss\npotential connections between this behaviour and observed time-variability in\ndisk-jet systems.\n", "  We review recent theoretical results, obtained for the equivalence between\ngravitational mass and energy of a composite quantum body as well as for its\nbreakdown at macroscopic and microscopic levels. In particular, we discuss that\nthe expectation values of passive and active gravitational masses operators are\nequivalent to the expectation value of energy for electron stationary quantum\nstates in a hydrogen atom. On the other hand, for superpositions of the\nstationary quantum states, inequivalence between the gravitational masses and\nenergy appears at a macroscopic level. It reveals itself as time-dependent\noscillations of the expectation values of passive and active gravitational\nmasses, which can be, in principle, experimentally measured. Inequivalence\nbetween passive gravitational mass and energy at a microscopic level can be\nexperimentally observed as unusual electromagnetic radiation, emitted by a\nmacroscopic ensemble of the atoms. We propose the corresponding experiment,\nwhich can be done on the Earth's orbit, using small spacecraft. If such\nexperiment is done it would be the first direct observation of quantum effects\nin general relativity.\n", "  We present survey data of the NH3 (J, K) = (1, 1)--(6, 6) lines,\nsimultaneously observed with the Tsukuba 32-m telescope, in the main part of\nthe central molecular zone of the Galaxy. The total number of on-source\npositions was 2655. The lowest three transitions were detected with S/N > 3 at\n2323 positions (93% of all the on-source positions). Among 2323, the S/N of (J,\nK ) = (4, 4), (5, 5), and (6, 6) exceeded 3.0 at 1426 (54%), 1150 (43%), and\n1359 (51%) positions, respectively. Simultaneous observations of the lines\nenabled us to accurately derive intensity ratios with less systematic errors.\nBoltzmann plots indicate there are two temperature components: cold ($\\sim$ 20\nK) and warm ($\\sim$ 100 K). Typical intensity ratios of Tmb(2,2)/Tmb(1,1),\nTmb(4,4)/Tmb(2,2), Tmb(5,5)/Tmb(4,4), and Tmb(6,6)/Tmb(3,3) were 0.71, 0.45,\n0.65, and 0.17, respectively. These line ratios correspond to diversity of\nrotational temperature, which results from mixing of the two temperature\ncomponents.\n", "  We investigate the evolutionary connection between local IR-bright galaxies\n($\\log L_{\\rm IR}\\ge 11.4\\,L_\\odot$) and quasars. We use high angular\nresolution ($\\sim$ 0.3-0.4 arcsec $\\sim$ few hundred parsecs) $8-13\\,\\mu$m\nground-based spectroscopy to disentangle the AGN mid-IR properties from those\nof star formation. The comparison between the nuclear $11.3\\,\\mu$m PAH feature\nemission and that measured with Spitzer/IRS indicates that the star formation\nis extended over a few kpc in the IR-bright galaxies. The AGN contribution to\nthe total IR luminosity of IR-bright galaxies is lower than in quasars.\nAlthough the dust distribution is predicted to change as IR-bright galaxies\nevolve to IR-bright quasars and then to optical quasars, we show that the AGN\nmid-IR emission of all the quasars in our sample is not significantly\ndifferent. In contrast, the nuclear emission of IR-bright galaxies with low AGN\ncontributions appears more heavily embedded in dust although there is no clear\ntrend with the interaction stage or projected nuclear separation. This suggests\nthat the changes in the distribution of the nuclear obscuring material may be\ntaking place rapidly and at different interaction stages washing out the\nevidence of an evolutionary path. When compared to normal AGN, the nuclear star\nformation activity of quasars appears to be dimming whereas it is enhanced in\nsome IR-bright nuclei, suggesting that the latter are in an earlier\nstar-formation dominated phase.\n", "  We measure the sizes of redshift ~2 star-forming galaxies by stacking data\nfrom the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). We use a\nuv-stacking algorithm in combination with model fitting in the uv-domain and\nshow that this allows for robust measures of the sizes of marginally resolved\nsources. The analysis is primarily based on the 344 GHz ALMA continuum\nobservations centred on 88 sub-millimeter galaxies in the LABOCA ECDFS\nSubmillimeter Survey (ALESS). We study several samples of galaxies at z~2 with\n$M_* \\sim{} 5\\times{}10^{10} $ M$_\\odot$ , selected using near-infrared\nphotometry (distant red galaxies, extremely red objects, sBzK-galaxies, and\ngalaxies selected on photometric redshift).\n  We find that the typical sizes of these galaxies are ~0.6 arcsec which\ncorresponds to ~5 kpc at z~2, this agrees well with the median sizes measured\nin the near-infrared z-band (~0.6 arcsec). We find errors on our size estimates\nof ~0.1-0.2 arcsec, which agree well with the expected errors for model fitting\nat the given signal-to-noise ratio. With the uv-coverage of our observations\n(18-160 m), the size and flux density measurements are sensitive to scales out\nto 2 . We compare this to a simulated ALMA Cycle 3 dataset with intermediate\nlength baseline coverage, and we find that, using only these baselines, the\nmeasured stacked flux density would be an order of magnitude fainter. This\nhighlights the importance of short baselines to recover the full flux density\nof high-redshift galaxies.\n", "  We have measured the transmission spectrum of the extremely inflated hot\nJupiter WASP-52b using simultaneous photometric observations in SDSS u', g' and\na filter centred on the sodium doublet (NaI) with the ULTRACAM instrument\nmounted on the 4.2m William Herschel Telescope. We find that Rayleigh\nscattering is not the dominant source of opacity within the planetary\natmosphere and find a transmission spectrum more consistent with\nwavelength-independent opacity such as from clouds. We detect an in-transit\nanomaly that we attribute to the presence of stellar activity and find that\nthis feature can be more simply modelled as a bright region on the stellar\nsurface akin to Solar faculae rather than spots. A spot model requires a\nsignificantly larger planet/star radius ratio than that found in previous\nstudies. Our results highlight the precision that can be achieved by\nground-based photometry with errors in the scaled planetary radii of less than\none atmospheric scale height, comparable to HST observations.\n", "  We present a population study of the star formation history of 1244 Type 2\nAGN host galaxies, compared to 6107 inactive galaxies. A Bayesian method is\nused to determine individual galaxy star formation histories, which are then\ncollated to visualise the distribution for quenching and quenched galaxies\nwithin each population. We find evidence for some of the Type 2 AGN host\ngalaxies having undergone a rapid drop in their star formation rate within the\nlast 2 Gyr. AGN feedback is therefore important at least for this population of\ngalaxies. This result is not seen for the quenching and quenched inactive\ngalaxies whose star formation histories are dominated by the effects of\ndownsizing at earlier epochs, a secondary effect for the AGN host galaxies. We\nshow that histories of rapid quenching cannot account fully for the quenching\nof all the star formation in a galaxy's lifetime across the population of\nquenched AGN host galaxies, and that histories of slower quenching, attributed\nto secular (non-violent) evolution, are also key in their evolution. This is in\nagreement with recent results showing both merger-driven and non-merger\nprocesses are contributing to the co-evolution of galaxies and supermassive\nblack holes. The availability of gas in the reservoirs of a galaxy, and its\nability to be replenished, appear to be the key drivers behind this\nco-evolution.\n", "  In 1897 Ostwald formulated his step rule for formation of the most stable\ncrystal state for a system with crystal polymorphism. The rule describes the\nirreversible way a system converts to the crystal with lowest free energy. But\nin fact the irreversible way a supercooled gas below the triple point\ntemperature $T_{tr.p.}$ crystallizes via a liquid droplet is an example of\nOstwald's step rule. The homogeneous nucleation in the supersaturated gas is\nnot to a crystal, but to a liquid-like critical nucleus. We have for the first\ntime performed constant energy (NVE) Molecular Dynamics (MD) of homogeneous\nnucleation without the use of a thermostat. The simulations of homogeneous\nnucleation in a Lennard-Jones system from supersaturated vapor at temperatures\nbelow $T_{tr.p.}$ reveals that the nucleation to a liquid-like critical nucleus\nis initiated by a small cold cluster [S. Toxvaerd, J. Chem. Phys. \\textbf{143}\n154705 (2015)]. The release of latent heat at the subsequent droplet growth\nincreases the temperature in the liquid-like droplet, which for not deep\nsupercooling and/or low supersaturation, can exceed $T_{tr.p.}$. The\ntemperature of the liquid-like droplet increases less for a low supersaturation\nand remains below $T_{tr.p.}$, but without a crystallization of the droplet for\nlong times. The dissipation of the latent heat into the surrounding gas is\naffected by a traditional MD thermostat, with the consequence that droplet\ngrowth is different for (NVE) MD and constant temperature (NVT) MD.\n", "  The appearance of the non-homogeneous structures of the indirect exciton\ndensity distribution in the region of the quantum well (in the region of the\ninner ring) is explained. The structure (the fragmentation) occurs due to the\nexciton condensed phase formation because of interaction between excitons. The\nformation of the structure is related with the non-equalibrity of the system,\nwhich is caused by the exciton finite lifetime and the presence of the pumpimg.\nThe structure emerges in the shape of a set of islands or circles of the\ncondensed phase. The structure type depends on the pumping intensity, the size\nof the laser spot and disappears with increasing the temperature. The merging\nof two structures, created by different laser spots, is investigated at\ndecreasing the distance between the centers of the spots.\n", "  We investigate the properties and evolution of star particles in two\nsimulations of isolated spiral galaxies, and two galaxies from cosmological\nsimulations. Unlike previous numerical work, where typically each star particle\nrepresents one `cluster', for the isolated galaxies we are able to model\nfeatures we term `clusters' with groups of particles. We compute the spatial\ndistribution of stars with different ages, and cluster mass distributions,\ncomparing our findings with observations including the recent LEGUS survey. We\nfind that spiral structure tends to be present in older (100s Myrs) stars and\nclusters in the simulations compared to the observations. This likely reflects\ndifferences in the numbers of stars or clusters, the strength of spiral arms,\nand whether the clusters are allowed to evolve. Where we model clusters with\nmultiple particles, we are able to study their evolution. The evolution of\nsimulated clusters tends to follow that of their natal gas clouds. Massive,\ndense, long-lived clouds host massive clusters, whilst short-lived clouds host\nsmaller clusters which readily disperse. Most clusters appear to disperse\nfairly quickly, in basic agreement with observational findings. We note that\nembedded clusters may be less inclined to disperse in simulations in a galactic\nenvironment with continuous accretion of gas onto the clouds than isolated\nclouds and correspondingly, massive young clusters which are no longer\nassociated with gas tend not to occur in the simulations. Caveats of our models\ninclude that the cluster densities are lower than realistic clusters, and the\nsimplistic implementation of stellar feedback.\n", "  The spherical curvature induced by pentagons in corannulenes and hexagonal\nsheets is shown to be the basic constituent that controls the growth of\nfullerenes and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) in soot forming and\ncarbon vapour environments. Formation of the initial ring of five or six atoms\nis the essential step which with the addition of further pentagons and hexagons\ndetermines whether a spinning fullerene is to be formed or the cap that lifts\nup and leads to the formation of an SWNT. A continuum elastic model is\ndeveloped to determine the criteria for the growth of these structures. The\nobserved dominance of the growth of 14 {\\AA} diameter armchair SWNTs in sooting\nand carbonaceous environments is explained by using the nanoelastic model of C\nshells.\n", "  We have investigated the complex multiwavelength evolution of GRO J1655-40\nduring the rise of its 2005 outburst. We detected two hard X-ray flares, the\nfirst one during the transition from the soft state to the ultra-soft state,\nand the second one in the ultra-soft state. The first X-ray flare coincided\nwith an optically thin radio flare. We also observed a hint of increased radio\nemission during the second X-ray flare. To explain the hard flares without\ninvoking a secondary emission component, we fit the entire data set with the\neqpair model. This single, hybrid Comptonization model sufficiently fits the\ndata even during the hard X-ray flares if we allow reflection fractions greater\nthan unity. In this case, the hard X-ray flares correspond to a Comptonizing\ncorona dominated by non-thermal electrons. The fits also require absorption\nfeatures in the soft and ultra-soft state which are likely due to a wind. In\nthis work we show that the wind and the optically thin radio flare co-exist.\nFinally, we have also investigated the radio to optical spectral energy\ndistribution, tracking the radio spectral evolution through the quenching of\nthe compact jet and rise of the optically thin flare, and interpreted all data\nusing state transition models.\n", "  Within the context of a cosmic space whose energy source is modeled with a\nperfect fluid, a uniform model of Universe based on a standard FRW cosmology\ncontaining decoupled mixed matter sources namely stiff matter and cosmic dust\ntogether with a positive cosmological constant, has been studied. Within the\nscenario of a $k=0-$ spatially-flat geometry, we analysed the geometrodynamics\nof the theoretical cosmology. For the model with an added cosmological\nconstant, the main scope was to point out the effects of it on the universe'\ndynamics. In this last case, the thermodynamics of the model was also\nconsidered together with the relation between the cosmological energy density\nand fluid pressure in terms of the inverse function of the equation of state.\n", "  We have studied the dynamics of a particle in a periodically driven\nunderdamped periodic potential. Recent studies have reported the occurrence of\nStochastic Resonance (SR) in such systems in the high frequency regime, using\ninput energy per period of external drive as a quantifier. The particle\ntrajectories in these systems can be in two dynamical states characterised by\ntheir definite energy and phase relation with the external drive. SR is due to\nthe noise assisted transition of the particles between these two states. We\nstudy the role of damping on the occurrence of SR. We show that a driven\nunderdamped periodic system exhibits SR only if the damping is below a\nparticular limit. To explain this we study the syatem in the deterministic\nregime. The existence of the two dynamical states in the deterministic regime\nis dependent on the amount of damping and the amplitude od external drive. We\nalso study the input energy distributions and phase difference of the response\namplitude with the external drive as afunction of the friction parameter.\n", "  We consider the problem, where a camera is tasked with determining one of two\nhypotheses: first with an incoherently-radiating quasi-monochromatic point\nsource and the second with two identical closely spaced point sources. We are\ngiven that the total number of photons collected over an integration time is\nassumed to be the same under either hypothesis. For the one-source hypothesis,\nthe source is taken to be on-axis along the line of sight and for the\ntwo-source hypothesis, we give ourselves the prior knowledge of the angular\nseparation of the sources, and they are assumed to be identical and located\nsymmetrically off-axis. This problem was studied by Helstrom in 1973, who\nevaluated the probability of error achievable using a sub-optimal optical\nmeasurement, with an unspecified structured realization. In this paper, we\nevaluate the quantum Chernoff bound, a lower bound on the minimum probability\nof error achievable by any physically-realizable receiver, which is\nexponentially tight in the regime that the integration time is high. We give an\nexplicit structured receiver that separates three orthogonal spatial modes of\nthe aperture field followed by quantum-noise-limited time-resolved photon\nmeasurement and show that this achieves the quantum Chernoff bound. In other\nwords, the classical Chernoff bound of our mode-resolved detector exactly\nmatches the quantum Chernoff bound for this problem. Finally, we evaluate the\nclassical Chernoff bound on the error probability achievable using an ideal\nfocal plane array---a signal shot-noise limited continuum photon-detection\nreceiver with infinitely many infinitesimally-tiny pixels---and quantify its\nperformance gap with the quantum limit.\n", "  Electron ionization of helium droplets doped with cesium or potassium results\nin doubly and, for cesium, triply charged cluster ions. The smallest observable\ndoubly charged clusters are $Cs_{9}^{2+}$ and $K_{11}^{2+}$; they are a factor\ntwo smaller than reported previously. The size of potassium dications\napproaches the Rayleigh limit nRay for which the fission barrier is calculated\nto vanish, i.e. their fissilities are close to 1. Cesium dications are even\nsmaller than nRay, implying that their fissilities have been significantly\noverestimated. Triply charged cesium clusters as small as $Cs_{19}^{3+}$ are\nobserved; they are a factor 2.6 smaller than previously reported. Mechanisms\nthat may be responsible for enhanced formation of clusters with high\nfissilities are discussed.\n", "  High flow rate, water-driven hydraulic fractures are more common now than\never in the oil and gas industry. Although the fractures are small, the high\ninjection rate and low viscosity of the water, lead to high Reynolds numbers\nand potentially turbulence in the fracture. Here we present a semi-analytical\nsolution for a blade-shaped (PKN) geometry hydraulic fracture driven by a\nturbulent fluid in the limit of zero fluid leak-off to the formation. We model\nthe turbulence in the PKN fracture using the Gaukler-Manning-Strickler\nparametrization, which relates the the flow rate of the water to the pressure\ngradient along the fracture. The key parameter in this relation is the\nDarcy-Weisbach friction factor for the roughness of the crack wall. Coupling\nthis turbulence parametrization with conservation of mass allows us to write a\nnonlinear pde for the crack width as a function of space and time. By way of a\nsimilarity ansatz, we obtain a semi-analytical solution using an orthogonal\npolynomial series. Embedding the asymptotic behavior near the fracture tip into\nthe polynomial series, we find very rapid convergence: a suitably accurate\nsolution is obtained with two terms of the series. This closed-form solution\nfacilitates clear comparisons between the results and parameters for laminar\nand turbulent hydraulic fractures. In particular, it resolves one of the well\nknown problems whereby calibration of models to data has difficulty\nsimultaneously matching the hydraulic fracture length and wellbore pressure.\n", "  In this work, we present results from a long-term precipitable water vapor\n(PWV) study in the Chajnantor area, in northern Chile. Data from several\ninstruments located at relevant sites for sub-millimeter and mid-infrared\nastronomy were processed to obtain relations between the atmospheric conditions\namong the sites. The data used for this study can be considered the richest\ndataset to date, because of the geographical sampling of the region, including\nsites at different altitudes, a time span from 2005 to 2014, and the different\ntechniques and instruments used for the measurements. We validate a method to\nconvert atmospheric opacity from 350 $\\mu$m tipper radiometers to PWV. An\naverage of 0.68 PWV ratio between Cerro Chajnantor and Llano of Chajnantor was\nfound.\n", "  The ASACUSA (Atomic Spectroscopy And Collisions Using Slow Antiprotons)\ncollaboration at the Antiproton Decelerator at CERN aims to measure the ground\nstate hyperfine structure of antihydrogen. A Rabi-like spectrometer line has\nbeen built for this purpose. A detector for counting antihydrogen is located at\nthe end of the beam line. This contribution will focus on the tracking\ndetector, whose challenging task it is to discriminate between background\nevents and antiproton annihilations originating from antihydrogen atoms which\nare produced only in small amounts.\n", "  We show that the no-signaling principle can be violated with classical\ninseparable beams in the presence of a parity-time (PT) symmetric subsystem.\nThus, the problems associated to PT-symmetric quantum theories recently\ndiscovered by Lee et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 130404 (2014)] are not\nexclusive to quantum mechanics, but already exist in the classical case. The\npossibility to implement local optical PT-symmetric subsystems via light-matter\ninteractions enables the experimental exploration of local PT symmetry and\nsubtle quantum concepts via classical analogues.\n", "  There are 8000 galaxies, including 1600 at z larger than 1.6, which could be\nsimultaneously observed in an E-ELT field of view of 40 sq. arcmin. A\nconsiderable fraction of astrophysical discoveries require large statistical\nsamples, which can only be obtained with multi-object spectrographs (MOS).\nMOSAIC will provide a vast discovery space, enabled by a multiplex of 200 and\nspectral resolving powers of R=5000 and 20000. MOSAIC will also offer the\nunique capability of more than 10 \"high-definition\" (multi-object adaptive\noptics, MOAO) integral-field units, optimised to investigate the physics of the\nsources of reionization. The combination of these modes will make MOSAIC the\nworld-leading MOS facility, contributing to all fields of contemporary\nastronomy, from extra-solar planets, to the study of the halo of the Milky Way\nand its satellites, and from resolved stellar populations in nearby galaxies\nout to observations of the earliest \"first-light\" structures in the Universe.\nIt will also study the distribution of the dark and ordinary matter at all\nscales and epochs of the Universe. Recent studies of critical technical issues\nsuch as sky-background subtraction and MOAO have demonstrated that such a MOS\nis feasible with state-of-the-art technology and techniques. Current studies of\nthe MOSAIC team include further trade-offs on the wavelength coverage, a\nsolution for compensating for the non-telecentric new design of the telescope,\nand tests of the saturation of skylines especially in the near-IR bands. In the\n2020s the E-ELT will become the world's largest optical/IR telescope, and we\nargue that it has to be equipped as soon as possible with a MOS to provide the\nmost efficient, and likely the best way to follow-up on James Webb Space\nTelescope (JWST) observations.\n", "  Given a real-valued positive semidefinite matrix, Williamson proved that it\ncan be diagonalised using symplectic matrices. The corresponding diagonal\nvalues are known as the symplectic spectrum. This paper is concerned with the\nstability of Williamson's decomposition under perturbations. We provide norm\nbounds for the stability of the symplectic eigenvalues and prove that if $S$\ndiagonalises a given matrix $M$ to Williamson form, then $S$ is stable if the\nsymplectic spectrum is nondegenerate and $S^TS$ is always stable. Finally, we\nsketch a few applications of the results in quantum information theory.\n", "  Small, illuminated aerosol particles embedded in a gas experience a\nphotophoretic force. Most approximations assume the mean particle surface\ntemperature to be effectively the gas temperature. This might not always be the\ncase. If the particle temperature or the thermal radiation field strongly\ndiffers from the gas temperature (optically thin gases), given approximations\nfor the free molecule regime overestimate the photophoretic force by an order\nof magnitude on average and for individual configurations up to three\nmagnitudes. We apply the radiative equilibrium condition from the previous\npaper (Paper 1) -- where photophoresis in the free molecular flow regime was\ntreated -- to the slip flow regime. The slip-flow model accounts for thermal\ncreep, frictional and thermal stress gas slippage and temperature jump at the\ngas-particle interface. In the limiting case for vanishing Knudsen numbers --\nthe continuum limit -- our derived formula has a mean error of only 4 \\%\ncompared to numerical values. Eventually, we propose an equation for\nphotophoretic forces for all Knudsen numbers following the basic idea from\nRohatschek by interpolating between the free molecular flow and the continuum\nlimit.\n", "  We perform quantitative phase imaging using phase retrieval to implement\nsynthetic aperture imaging. Compared to digital holography, the developed\ntechnique is simpler, less expensive, and more stable.\n", "  Many extremely low-mass (ELM) white-dwarf (WD) stars are currently being\nfound in the field of the Milky Way. Some of these stars exhibit long-period\nnonradial $g$-mode pulsations, and constitute the class of ELMV pulsating WDs.\nIn addition, several low-mass pre-WDs, which could be precursors of ELM WDs,\nhave been observed to show short-period photometric variations likely due to\nnonradial $p$ modes and radial modes. They could constitute a new class of\npulsating low-mass pre-WD stars, the pre-ELMV stars. Here, we present the\nrecent results of a thorough theoretical study of the nonadiabatic pulsation\nproperties of low-mass He-core WDs and pre-WDs on the basis of fully\nevolutionary models representative of these stars.\n", "  The present status of the LHC anomalies found in exclusive semileptonic $b\\to\ns\\ell^+\\ell^-$ decays is discussed with special emphasis on the exclusive\n4-body angular distribution $B \\to K^*(\\to K\\pi)\\ell^+\\ell^-$. The treatment of\nhadronic uncertainties in this mode is briefly reviewed, and some of the\nanalyses in the literature are critically reassessed. The global picture\nprovided by the global fit points to a coherent pattern of deviations with a\nsignificance substantially above 4$\\sigma$ for different New Physics scenarios.\nFinally, we propose as the next step in the field to focus on the study of\noptimized observables that compare electron and muon modes, sensitive to\nlepton-flavour universality violations and free from hadronic uncertainties\n(including charm) in the SM, the so called $Q_i$ observables.\n", "  In previous work we developed a model of neutrinos based on a new symmetry,\nLight Cone Reflection (LCR), that interchanges spacelike and timelike\nintervals. In this paper we start with the four-dimensional model, and\nconstruct a two-dimensional avatar that obeys the same equations of motion, and\npreserves both the light-cone reflection symmetry and the chiral symmetry of\nthe original theory. The avatar also contains the interaction that rendered the\nfour-dimensional model gauge invariant. In an addendum, we make some remarks\nabout how to determine the scalar field that enters into the definition of the\nLCR-covariant derivative.\n", "  A commercially available membrane filter paper composed of mixed cellulose\nesters bearing typically an interconnected pore structure was transformed into\na stimuli-responsive bilayer actuator by depositing a thin film of poly(ionic\nliquid)-modified graphene oxide sheets (GO-PIL) onto the filter paper. In\nacetone vapor, the as-synthesized bilayer actuator bent readily into multiple\nloops at a fast speed with the GO-PIL top film inwards. Upon pulling back into\nair the actuator recovered their original shape. The asymmetric swelling of the\ntop GO-PIL film and the bottom porous filter paper towards organic vapor offers\na favorably synergetic function to drive the actuation. The PIL polymer chains\nin the hybrid film were proven crucial to enhance the adhesion strength between\nthe GO sheets and the adjacent filter paper to avoid interfacial delamination\nand thus improve force transfer. The overall construction allows a prolonged\nlifetime of the bilayer actuator under constant operation, especially when\ncompared to that of the GO/filter paper bilayer actuator without PIL.\n", "  We introduced a new concept for fabricating solvent stimulus polymer\nactuators with unprecedented sensitivity and accuracy. This was accomplished by\nintegrating porous architectures and electrostatic complexation gradients in a\npoly(ionic liquid) membrane that bears ionic liquid species for solvent\nsorption. In contact with 1.5 mol% of acetone molecules in water, the actuator\nmembrane (1 mm x 20 mm x 30 um) bent into a closed loop. While the interaction\nbetween solvents and the polymer drives the actuation, the continuous gradient\nin complexation degree combined with the porous architecture optimizes the\nactuation, giving it a high sensitivity and even the ability to discriminate\nbutanol solvent isomers. The membrane is also capable of cooperative actuation.\nThe design concept is easy to implement and applicable to other polyelectrolyte\nsystems, which substantially underpins their potentials in smart and sensitive\nsignaling microrobotics/devices.\n", "  3$\\alpha$-cluster structures and monopole transitions of $0^+$ states in\n$^{12}$C and $^{14}$C were investigated with $3\\alpha$- and\n$^{10}$Be+$\\alpha$-cluster models. A gas-like $3\\alpha$ state and a\nbending-chain $3\\alpha$ state were obtained in the $0^+_2$ and $0^+_3$ states\nof $^{12}$C, respectively. In $^{14}$C, a linear-chain 3$\\alpha$ structure is\nfound in the $0^+_4$ state near the $^{10}$Be+$\\alpha$ threshold, but a cluster\ngas-like state does not appear because valence neutrons attract $\\alpha$\nclusters and suppress spatial development of 3$\\alpha$ clustering. It was found\nthat the linear-chain state in $^{14}$C is stabilized against the bending and\n$\\alpha$ escaping modes by valence neutrons. The monopole transition strengths\nin $^{12}$C are enhanced by $3\\alpha$-cluster developing, whereas, those in\n$^{14}$C are not enhanced so much because of the tight binding of $\\alpha$\nclusters by valence neutrons.\n", "  I calculate the 1-loop vacuum polarization $\\Pi_{\\mu\\nu}(k,B,a)$ for a photon\nof momentum $k=(\\hat k,k_3)$ interacting with the electrons of a thin medium of\nthickness $2a$ simulating graphene, in the presence of a constant and uniform\nexternal magnetic field $B$ orthogonal to it (parallel to $k_3$). Calculations\nare done with the techniques of Schwinger, adapted to the geometry and\nHamiltonian under scrutiny. The situation gets more involved than for the\nelectron self-energy because the photon is now allowed to also propagate\noutside the medium. This makes $\\Pi_{\\mu\\nu}$ factorize into a quantum,\n\"reduced\" $T_{\\mu\\nu}(\\hat k,B)$ and a transmittance function $V(k,a)$, in\nwhich the geometry of the sample and the resulting confinement of the\n$\\gamma\\,e^+\\,e^-$ vertices play major roles. This drags the results away from\nreduced QED$_{3+1}$ on a 2-brane. The finiteness of $V$ at $k^2=0$ is an\nessential ingredient to fulfill suitable renormalization condition for\n$\\Pi_{\\mu\\nu}$ and to fix the corresponding counterterms. Their connection with\nthe transversality of $\\Pi_{\\mu\\nu}$ is investigated. The corrections to the\nCoulomb potential and their dependence on $B$ strongly differ from QED$_{3+1}$.\n", "  In a remarkable experiment, Eichmann et al. attained unprecedented\nacceleration of neutral atoms by strong short-pulse IR laser fields. The\ndriving mechanism was identified as the ponderomotive force on excited\nelectrons bound in Rydberg orbits that survive long enough to enable the atoms\nto reach the detector. However, the observed velocities lie somewhat above the\ntheoretical prediction. The systematic discrepancy was attributed to \"absolute\nlaser intensity uncertainties or a slightly non-Gaussian intensity\ndistribution\". Here, we examine the process by transforming to the\nKramers-Henneberger (KH) reference frame. We find that in addition to the\nponderomotive potential there exists a smaller but significant term that comes\nfrom the binding energy of the KH atom. Including this KH term brings the\ncalculated maximum velocities to a close match with experimental results over\nthe full range of laser pulse durations.\n", "  We perform computer simulations of the quasiliquid layer of ice formed at the\nice-vapor interface close to the ice Ih-liquid-vapor triple point of water. Our\nstudy shows that the two distinct surfaces bounding the film behave at small\nwavelengths as atomically rough and independent ice-water and water-vapor\ninterfaces. For long wavelengths, however, the two surfaces couple, large scale\nparallel fluctuations are inhibited, and the ice-vapor interface becomes\nsmooth. Our results could help explain the complex morphology of ice\ncrystallites.\n", "  In this contribution recent results regarding the NLO electroweak corrections\nfor vector boson production in association with jets are presented. Besides\ndiscussing the phenomenology of the fixed-order results, their corporation in\nexisting NLO QCD parton shower matched and merged calculations, which can\ndirectly be used in experimental analyses, will be shown.\n", "  We attempt to identify the different node hubs of a road network using\nPageRank for preparation for possible random terrorist attacks. The robustness\nof a road network against such attack is crucial to be studied because it may\ncripple its connectivity by simply shutting down these hubs. We show the\nimportant hubs in a road network based on network structure and propose a model\nfor robustness analysis. By identifying important hubs in a road network,\npossible preparation schemes may be done earlier to mitigate random terrorist\nattacks, including defense reinforcement and transportation security. A case\nstudy of the Metro Manila road network is also presented. The case study shows\nthat the most important hubs in the Metro Manila road network are near\nairports, piers, major highways and expressways\n", "  In this paper, an interacting holographic dark energy model with Hubble\nhorizon as an infra-red cut-off is considered in the framework of Brans-Dicke\ntheory. We propose a logarithmic form $\\phi \\propto ln(\\alpha+\\beta a)$ of the\nBrans-Dicke scalar field to alleviate the problems of interacting holographic\ndark energy models in Brans-Dicke theory. We find that the equation of state\nparameter $w_h$ and deceleration parameter $q$ are negative in the early time\nwhich shows the early time inflation. During the evolution the sign of\nparameter $q$ changes from negative to positive which means that the Universe\nexpands with decelerated rate whereas the sign of $w_h$ may change or remain\nnegative throughout the evolution depending on the values of parameters. It is\nalso observed that $w_h$ may cross the phantom divide line in the late time\nevolution. The sign of $q$ changes from positive to negative during late time\nof evolution which explains the late time accelerated expansion of the\nUniverse. Thus, we present a unified model of holographic dark energy which\nexplains the early time acceleration (inflation), medieval time deceleration\nand late time acceleration. We also discuss the cosmic coincidence problem. We\nobtain a time-varying density ratio of holographic dark energy to dark matter\nwhich is a constant of order one ($r\\sim \\mathcal{O}(1)$) during early and late\ntime evolution. Therefore, our model successfully resolves the cosmic\ncoincidence problem.\n", "  We present the short description of the methods for calculation of the\ncoupling coefficients in the Coupling Cavity Model of arbitrary chain of\nresonators. In the first part the procedure that is based on the Mode Matching\nMethod is given. Then we present the new method that used only one eigen\nvector.\n", "  We propose a framework for extracting the bone surface from B-mode images\nemploying the eigenspace minimum variance (ESMV) beamformer and a ridge\ndetection method. We show that an ESMV beamformer with a rank-1 signal subspace\ncan preserve the bone anatomy and enhance the edges, despite an image which is\nless visually appealing due to some speckle pattern distortion. The beamformed\nimages are post-processed using the phase symmetry (PS) technique. We validate\nthis framework by registering the ultrasound images of a vertebra (in a water\nbath) against the corresponding Computed Tomography (CT) dataset. The results\nshow a bone localization error in the same order of magnitude as the standard\ndelay-and-sum (DAS) technique, but with approximately 20% smaller standard\ndeviation (STD) of the image intensity distribution around the bone surface.\nThis indicates a sharper bone surface detection. Further, the noise level\ninside the bone shadow is reduced by 60%. In in-vivo experiments, this\nframework is used for imaging the spinal anatomy. We show that PS images\nobtained from this beamformer setup have sharper bone boundaries in comparison\nwith the standard DAS ones, and they are reasonably well separated from the\nsurrounding soft tissue.\n", "  The interest in poly(ionic liquids) for sensing applications are derived from\ntheir strong interactions to a variety of analytes. By combining the desirable\nmechanical properties of polymers with the physical and chemical properties of\nILs, new materials can be created. The tunable nature of both ionic liquids and\npolymers allows for incredible diversity, which is exemplified in their broad\napplicability. In this article we examine the new field of poly(ionic liquid)\nsensors by providing a detailed look at the current state-of-the-art sensing\ndevices for solvents, gasses, biomolecules, pH, and anions.\n", "  We describe colloidal Janus particles with metallic and dielectric faces that\nswim vigorously when illuminated by defocused optical tweezers without\nconsuming any chemical fuel. Rather than wandering randomly, these\noptically-activated colloidal swimmers circulate back and forth through the\nbeam of light, tracing out sinuous rosette patterns. We propose a model for\nthis mode of light-activated transport that accounts for the observed behavior\nthrough a combination of self-thermophoresis and optically-induced torque. In\nthe deterministic limit, this model yields trajectories that resemble rosette\ncurves known as hypotrochoids.\n", "  In spring 2015, the Leibniz Supercomputing Centre (Leibniz-Rechenzentrum,\nLRZ), installed their new Peta-Scale System SuperMUC Phase2. Selected users\nwere invited for a 28 day extreme scale-out block operation during which they\nwere allowed to use the full system for their applications. The following\nprojects participated in the extreme scale-out workshop: BQCD (Quantum\nPhysics), SeisSol (Geophysics, Seismics), GPI-2/GASPI (Toolkit for HPC),\nSeven-League Hydro (Astrophysics), ILBDC (Lattice Boltzmann CFD), Iphigenie\n(Molecular Dynamic), FLASH (Astrophysics), GADGET (Cosmological Dynamics), PSC\n(Plasma Physics), waLBerla (Lattice Boltzmann CFD), Musubi (Lattice Boltzmann\nCFD), Vertex3D (Stellar Astrophysics), CIAO (Combustion CFD), and LS1-Mardyn\n(Material Science). The projects were allowed to use the machine exclusively\nduring the 28 day period, which corresponds to a total of 63.4 million\ncore-hours, of which 43.8 million core-hours were used by the applications,\nresulting in a utilization of 69%. The top 3 users were using 15.2, 6.4, and\n4.7 million core-hours, respectively.\n", "  Metal-nanoclusters (NC), deposited by magnetron-based nanocluster source\ncoupled with quadrupole mass filter (QMF) assembly having independent control\nover its size and density, are used in fabricating NC-based non-volatile memory\n(NVM) devices. The effect of diameter and density on the NVM charge storage\ncharacteristics are presented where Ag is used as the metal NC. The Ag-NC,\nsandwiched between HfO$_2$ tunnel and control oxides, is deposited by using the\ncombination of the above two instruments. No annealing is performed at any\nstage of the device fabrication. The largest hysteresis loop area in the\ncapacitance-voltage ($C-V$) characteristics of metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS)\ncharacteristics is observed for a cluster density of 1 $\\times$ 10$^{11}$\ncm$^{-2}$. Further, an NC size dependent hysteresis loop area is observed with\nthe MOS devices where the NC diameter is varied from 3 to 1.5 nm keeping the NC\ndensity at 1 $\\times$ 10$^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$. The device performance is found to\nbe improved with a reduction of the NC size and shows its best with the NC\ndiameter of 1.5 nm. The storage time of the NVM devices also increases with the\ndecrease in the NC diameter and exhibits their best performances for the NCs\nwith a diameter of 1.5 nm.\n", "  The determination of particle size by dynamic light scattering uses the\nStokes-Einstein relation, which can break down for nanoscale objects. Here we\nemploy a molecular dynamics simulation of fully solvated 1-5 nm carbon\nnanoparticles for the refinement of the experimental data obtained for\nnanodiamonds in water by using dynamic light scattering. We performed molecular\ndynamics simulations in differently sized boxes and calculated nanoparticles\ndiffusion coefficients using the velocity autocorrelation function and\nmean-square displacement. We found that the predictions of the Stokes-Einstein\nrelation are accurate for nanoparticles larger than 3 nm while for smaller\nnanoparticles the diffusion coefficient should be corrected and different\nboundary conditions should be taken into account.\n", "  In this paper, a new analytic method with a convergence-control parameter $c$\nis first proposed. The parameter $c$ is used to adjust and control the\nconvergence region and rate of the resulting series solution. It turns out that\nthe convergence region and rate can be greatly enlarged by choosing a proper\nvalue of $c$. Furthermore, a numerical approach for finding the optimal value\nof the convergence-control parameter is given. At the same time, it is found\nthat the traditional Adomian decomposition method is only a special case of the\nnew method. The effectiveness and applicability of the new technique are\ndemonstrated by several physical models including nonlinear heat transfer\nproblems, nano-electromechanical systems, diffusion and dissipation phenomena,\nand dispersive waves. Moreover, the ideas proposed in this paper may offer us\npossibilities to greatly improve current analytic and numerical techniques.\n", "  We solve the inverse problem for non-Abelian Coxeter double Bruhat cells in\nterms of the matrix Weyl functions. This result can be used to establish\ncomplete integrability of the non-Abelian version of nonlinear Coxeter-Toda\nlattices in $GL_n$.\n", "  Turbulence is one of the most prototypical phenomena of systems driven out of\nequilibrium. While turbulence has been studied mainly with classical fluids\nlike water, considerable attention is now drawn to quantum turbulence (QT),\nobserved in quantum fluids such as superfluid helium and Bose-Einstein\ncondensates. A distinct feature of QT is that it consists of quantum vortices,\nby which turbulent circulation is quantized. Yet, under strong forcing,\ncharacteristic properties of developed classical turbulence such as\nKolmogorov's law have also been identified in QT. Here, we study the opposite\nlimit of weak forcing, i.e., the onset of QT, numerically, and find another set\nof universal scaling laws known for classical non-equilibrium systems.\nSpecifically, we show that the transition belongs to the directed percolation\nuniversality class, known to arise generically in transitions into an absorbing\nstate, including transitions to classical shear-flow turbulence after very\nrecent studies. We argue that quantum vortices play an important role in our\nfinding.\n", "  Some interesting relations between Pythagorean means (arithmetic, geometric\nand harmonic means) and the coefficients of performance of reversible Carnot\nmachines (heat engine, refrigerator and heat pump) are discussed.\n", "  Final state interactions are considered to formulate the $B$ meson decay\namplitude for the $K\\pi\\pi$ channel. The Faddeev decomposition of the\nBethe-Salpeter equation is used in order to build a relativistic three-body\nmodel within the light-front framework. The S-wave scattering amplitude for the\n$K\\pi$ system is considered in the $1/2$ and $3/2$ isospin channels with the\nset of inhomogeneous integral equations solved perturbatively. In comparison\nwith previous results for the $D$ meson decay in the same channel, one has to\nconsider the different partonic processes, which build the source amplitudes,\nand the larger absorption to other decay channels appears, that are important\nfeatures to be addressed. As in the $D$ decay case, the convergence of the\nrescattering perturbative series is also achieved with two-loop contributions.\n", "  Entanglement between two separate systems is a necessary resource to violate\na Bell inequality in a test of local realism. We demonstrate that to overcome\nthe Bell bound, this correlation must be accompanied by the entanglement\nbetween the constituent particles. This happens whenever a super-selection rule\nimposes a constraint on feasible local operations. As we show in an example,\nthe necessary particle entanglement might solely result from their\nindistinguishability. Our result reveals a fundamental relation between the\nnon-locality and the particle entanglement.\n", "  A classical thermometer typically works by exchanging energy with the system\nbeing measured until it comes to equilibrium, at which point the readout is\nrelated to the final energy state of the thermometer. A recent paper noted that\ndifferent-temperature baths lead not only to different equilibrium states but\nalso to different equilibration rates. In some cases this means that\ntemperature discrimination is better achieved by comparing the rates than the\nasymptotic states -- and should therefore be carried out at finite times rather\nthan once equilibration is essentially complete. The theory work also noted\nthat for a \\emph{quantum} thermometer, the difference between the relaxation\nrates for populations and coherences means that for intermediate time regimes\n(before full equilibration but after some characteristic time that depends on\nthe temperatures of the baths), optimal discrimination is achieved not by\nprobing energy only but by using quantum coherence as well. In this work, we\nstudy these effects experimentally. Implementing a recent proposal for\nefficiently emulating an arbitrary quantum channel, we use the quantum\npolarisation state of individual photons as models of \"single-qubit\nthermometers\" which evolve for a certain time in contact with a thermal bath.\nWe investigate the optimal thermometer states for temperature discrimination,\nand the optimal interaction times, confirming that there is a broad regime\nwhere quantum coherence provides a significant improvement. We also discuss the\nmore practical question of thermometers composed of a finite number of\nspins/qubits (greater than one), and characterize the performance of an\nadaptive protocol for making optimal use of all the qubits.\n", "  We define and study a new type of quantum oracle, the quantum conditional\noracle, which provides oracle access to the conditional probabilities\nassociated with an underlying distribution. Amongst other properties, we (a)\nobtain speed-ups over the best known quantum algorithms for identity testing,\nequivalence testing and uniformity testing of probability distributions; (b)\nstudy the power of these oracles for testing properties of boolean functions,\nand obtain an algorithm for checking whether an $n$-input $m$-output boolean\nfunction is balanced or $\\epsilon$-far from balanced; and (c) give a sub-linear\nalgorithm, requiring $\\tilde{O}(n^{3/4}/\\epsilon)$ queries, for testing whether\nan $n$-dimensional quantum state is maximally mixed or not.\n", "  Over the last century Bohr van Leuween theorem attracted the notice of\nphysicists. The theorem states about the absence of magnetization in classical\nsystems in thermal equilibrium. In this paper, we discuss about fluctuations of\nmagnetic moment in classical systems. In recent years this topic has been\ninvestigated intensively and it is not free from controversy. We a have\nconsidered a system consisting of a single particle moving in a plane. A\nmagnetic field is applied perpendicular to the plane. The system is in contact\nwith a thermal bath. We have considered three cases: (a) particle moving in a\nhomogeneous medium, (b) particle moving in a medium with space dependent\nfriction and (c) particle moving in a medium with space dependent temperature.\nFor all the three cases average magnetic moment and fluctuations in magnetic\nmoment has been calculated. Average magnetic moment saturates to a finite value\nin case of free particle but goes to zero when the particle is confined by a\n2-D harmonic potential. Fluctuations in magnetic moment shows universal\nfeatures in the presence of arbitrary friction inhomogeneity. For this case the\nsystem reaches equilibrium asymptotically. In case of space dependent\ntemperature profile, the stationary distribution is non-Gibbsian and\nfluctuations deviate from universal value for the bounded system only.\n", "  A narrow peak near 1870 MeV is observed in the combined invariant-mass\nspectrum of the systems $\\Lambda K^0_S \\pi^-$, $\\Lambda K^0_S \\pi^+$, $\\Lambda\nK^- \\pi^-$, and $\\Lambda K^- \\pi^+$ formed in $\\nu_\\mu$- and\n$\\bar{\\nu_\\mu}$-induced charged-current collisions with free protons,\ndeuterons, and Neon nuclei. Observed width of the resonance is consistent with\nbeing entirely due to apparatus smearing. A possible interpretation of the peak\nis formation and three-body $\\Lambda K \\pi$ decay of an exotic baryon with $I =\n3/2$ and $S = -2$.\n", "  The current driven motion of skyrmions in MnSi and FeGe thinned single\ncrystals could be initiated at current densities of the order of $10^6$ A/m,\nfive orders of magnitude smaller than for magnetic domain walls. The\ntechnologically crucial step of replicating these results in thin films has not\nbeen successful to date, but the reasons are not clear. Elucidating them\nrequires analyzing system characteristics at scales of few nm where the key\nDzyaloshinskii Moriya (DM) interactions vary, and doing so in near application\nconditions, i.e. oxidation protected systems at room temperature. In this\nwork's magnetic force microscopy (MFM) studies of magnetron sputtered Ir/Co/Pt\nmultilayers we show skyrmions that are smaller than previously observed, are\nnot circularly symmetric, and are pinned to 50 nm wide areas of 75 percent\nhigher than average DM interaction. This finding matches our measurement of Co\nlayer thickness inhomogeneity of the order of $\\pm$1.2 atomic monolayers per\n0.6 nm layer, and indicates that layer flatness must be controlled with greater\nprecision to preclude skyrmion pinning.\n", "  The widely used quantum Cramer-Rao bound (QCRB) sets a lower bound for the\nmean square error of unbiased estimators in quantum parameter estimation,\nhowever, in general QCRB is only tight in the asymptotical limit. With a\nlimited number of measurements biased estimators can have a far better\nperformance for which QCRB cannot calibrate. Here we introduce a valid lower\nbound for all estimators, either biased or unbiased, which can serve as\nstandard of merit for all quantum parameter estimations.\n", "  In the following we present our results on resummation of invariant mass\nthreshold corrections for the $2 \\to 3$ type hadronic production processes in\nthe Mellin moment space formalism. This method is applied to the associated\nHiggs boson production process $pp \\to t \\bar{t} H$ at the LHC. The results for\nthe total cross section, the differential distribution with respect to the\ninvariant mass and their uncertainties are presented.\n", "  Frank-Kasper (F-K) phases form an important set of large-cell crystalline\nstructures describing many inter-metallic alloys. They are usually described in\nterm of their atomic environments, with atoms having $12, 14, 15$ and $16$\nneighbours, coded into the canonical $Z_p$ cells (with $p$ the coordination\nnumber), the case $p=12$ corresponding to a local icosahedral environment. In\naddition, the long range structure is captured by the geometry of a network\n(called either \"major skeleton\" or \"disclination network\") connecting only the\nnon-icosahedral sites (with $p\\ne 12$). Another interesting description, valid\nfor the so-called \"layered F-K phases\", amounts to give simple rules to\ndecorate specific periodic 2d tilings made of triangles and squares and\neventually get the 3d periodic F-K phases. Quasicrystalline phases can sometime\nbe found in the vicinity, in the phase diagram, of the F-K crystalline alloys;\nit is therefore of interest to understand if and how the standard F-K\nconstruction rules can be generalized on top of an underlying quasiperiodic\nstructure. It is in particular natural to investigate how well square-triangle\nquasiperiodic tilings with dodecagonal symmetry, made of square and\n(equilateral) triangles, can be used as building frames to generate some\nF-K-like quasicrystalline structures. We show here how to produce two types of\nsuch structures, which are quasiperiodic in a plane and periodic in the third\ndirection, and containing (or not) $Z_{16}$ sites.\n", "  It is common for people to access multiple social networks, for example,\nusing phone, email, and social media. Together, the multi-layer social\ninteractions form a \"integrated social network.\" How can we extend well\ndeveloped knowledge about single-layer networks, including vertex centrality\nand community structure, to such heterogeneous structures? In this paper, we\napproach these challenges by proposing a principled framework of network\ncomposition based on a unified dynamical process. Mathematically, we consider\nthe following abstract problem: Given multi-layer network data and additional\nparameters for intra and inter-layer dynamics, construct a (single) weighted\nnetwork that best integrates the joint process. We use transformations of\ndynamics to unify heterogeneous layers under a common dynamics. For inter-layer\ncompositions, we will consider several cases as the inter-layer dynamics plays\ndifferent roles in various social or technological networks. Empirically, we\nprovide examples to highlight the usefulness of this framework for network\nanalysis and network design.\n", "  The temperature dependence of the nonlinear current-voltage ($I$-$V$)\ncharacteristics in highly underdoped La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$ ($x=0.07$ and\n0.08) thick films has been studied in both zero and perpendicular magnetic\nfields $H$. Power-law behavior of $V(I)$ is found for both $H=0$ and $H \\neq\n0$. The critical current $I_{c}$ was extracted, and its temperature and\nmagnetic field dependences were studied in detail. The\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless physics dominates the nonlinear $I$-$V$ near\nthe superconducting transition at $H=0$, and it continues to contribute up to a\ncharacteristic temperature $T_x(H)$. Nonlinear $I$-$V$ persists up to an even\nhigher temperature $T_{h}(H)$ due to the depinning of vortices.\n", "  We show that for any $\\varepsilon>0$ there is an XOR game $G=G(\\varepsilon)$\nwith $\\Theta(\\varepsilon^{-1/5})$ inputs for one player and\n$\\Theta(\\varepsilon^{-2/5})$ inputs for the other player such that\n$\\Omega(\\varepsilon^{-1/5})$ ebits are required for any strategy achieving bias\nthat is at least a multiplicative factor $(1-\\varepsilon)$ from optimal. This\ngives an exponential improvement in both the number of inputs or outputs and\nthe noise tolerance of any previously-known self-test for highly entangled\nstates. Up to the exponent $-1/5$ the scaling of our bound with $\\varepsilon$\nis tight: for any XOR game there is an $\\varepsilon$-optimal strategy using\n$\\lceil \\varepsilon^{-1} \\rceil$ ebits, irrespective of the number of questions\nin the game.\n", "  A common issue encountered in photoemission electron sources used in electron\naccelerators is distortion of the laser spot due to non ideal conditions at all\nstages of the amplification. Such a laser spot at the cathode may produce\nasymmetric charged beams that will result in degradation of the beam quality\ndue to space charge at early stages of acceleration and fail to optimally\nutilize the cathode surface. In this note we study the possibility of using\nmicrolens arrays to dramatically improve the transverse uniformity of the drive\nlaser pulse on UV photocathodes at both Fermilab Accelerator Science \\&\nTechnology (FAST) facility and Argonne Wakefield Accelerator (AWA). In\nparticular, we discuss the experimental characterization of the homogeneity and\nperiodic patterned formation at the photocathode. Finally, we compare the\nexperimental results with the paraxial analysis, ray tracing and wavefront\npropagation software.\n", "  We introduce a new Hamiltonian model which interpolates between the\nJaynes-Cummings model and other types of such Hamiltonians. It works with two\ninterpolating parameters, rather than one as traditional. Taking advantage of\nthis greater degree of freedom, we can perform continuous interpolation between\nthe various types of these Hamiltonians. As applications we discuss a paradox\nraised in literature and compare the time evolution of photon statistics\nobtained in the various interpolating models. The role played by the average\nexcitation in these comparisons is also highlighted.\n", "  The ATLAS and CMS experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN have\nsearched for signals of new physics, in particular for supersymmetry. The data\ncollected until 2012 at center-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV and integrated\nluminosities of 5 fb^-1 and 20 fb^-1, respectively, agree with the expectation\nfrom standard model processes. Constraints on supersymmetry have been\ncalculated and interpreted in different models. Limits on supersymmetry\nparticle masses at the TeV scale have been derived and interpreted generally in\nthe context of simplified model spectra. The constrained minimal supersymmetric\nstandard model is disfavored by the experimental results. Natural supersymmetry\nscenarios with low supersymmetry particle masses remain possible in multiple\nregions, for example in those with compressed spectra, that are difficult to\naccess experimentally. The upgraded LHC operating at 13 TeV is gaining\nsensitivity to the remaining unexplored SUSY parameter space.\n", "  Here we report successful growth of mm scale single crystals of\nstoichiometric FeSc2S4. Single crystal X-ray diffraction yields a cubic\nstructure, spacegroup Fd-3m, with a=10.5097(2) angstroms at T=110(2) K\nconsistent with previous literature on polycrystallin samples. Models fit to\nthe data reveal no detectable antisite mixing or deviations from the ideal\nstoichiometry. Heat capacity and dc magnetization measurements on the single\ncrystals match those of high quality powder specimens. The novel traveling\nsolvent growth method presented in this work opens the door to studies\nrequiring sizable single crystals of the candidate spin-orbital liquid FeSc2S4.\n", "  Among the many facets of quantum correlations, bound entanglement has\nremained one the most enigmatic phenomena, despite the fact that it was\ndiscovered in the early days of quantum information. Even its detection has\nproven to be difficult, let alone its precise quantitative characterization. In\nthis work, we present the exact quantification of entanglement for a\ntwo-parameter family of highly symmetric two-qutrit mixed states, which\ncontains a sizable part of bound entangled states. We achieve this by\nexplicitly calculating the convex-roof extensions of the linear entropy as well\nas the concurrence for every state within the family. Our results provide a\nbenchmark for future quantitative studies of bipartite entanglement in\nhigher-dimensional systems.\n", "  The motion of a neutron superfluid condensate in a pulsar is studied. Several\ntheorems of general-relativistic hydrodynamics are proved for a superfluid. The\naverage density distribution of vortex lines in pulsars and their\ngeneral-relativistic curvature are derived.\n", "  One- and two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of neutrino-driven\nsupernova explosions are discussed. The simulations cover the phase between the\nstagnation of the prompt shock and about one second after core bounce.\nSystematic variation of the neutrino fluxes from the neutrino sphere shows that\nthe explosion energy, explosion time scale, initial mass of the protoneutron\nstar, and explosive nucleosynthesis of iron-group elements depend sensitively\non the strength of the neutrino heating during the first few 100 ms after shock\nformation. Convective overturn in the neutrino-heated region behind the shock\nis a crucial help for the explosion only in a narrow window of neutrino\nluminosities. Here powerful explosions can be obtained only in the\nmulti-dimensional case. For higher core-neutrino fluxes also spherically\nsymmetrical models yield energetic explosions, while for lower luminosities\neven with convection no strong explosions occur.\n", "  This study analyzes the sizes, shapes and correlations of $\\lya$ clouds\nproduced by a hydrodynamic simulation of a spatially flat CDM universe with a\nnon-zero cosmological constant ($\\Omega_0=0.4$, $\\Lambda_0=0.6$, $\\sigma_8\n=0.79$), over the redshift range $2\\le z \\le 4$. The $\\lya$ clouds range in\nsize from several kiloparsecs to about a hundred kiloparsecs in proper units,\nand they range in shape from roundish, high column density regions with\n$\\nhi\\ge 10^{15} cm^{-2}$ to low column density sheet-like structures with\n$\\nhi \\le 10^{13} cm^{-2}$ at z=3. The most common shape found in the\nsimulation resembles that of a flattened cigar. The physical size of a typical\ncloud grows with time roughly as $(1+z)^{-3/2}$ while its shape hardly evolves\n(except for the most dense regions $\\rho_{cut}>30$). Our result indicates that\nany simple model with a population of spheres (or other shapes) of a uniform\nsize is oversimplified; if such a model agrees with observational evidence, it\nis probably only by coincidence. We also illustrate why the use of double\nquasar sightlines to set lower limits on cloud sizes is useful only when the\nperpendicular sightline separation is small ($\\Delta r \\le 50h^{-1}$ kpc).\nFinally, we conjecture that high column density $\\lya$ clouds ($\\nhi\\ge 10^{15}\ncm^{-2}$) may be the progenitors of the lower redshift faint blue galaxies.\nThis seems plausible because their correlation length, number density\n(extrapolated to lower redshift) and their masses are in fair agreement with\nthose observed.\n", "  We have carried out model calculations of the photoionized intergalactic\nmedium (IGM) to determine the effects on the predicted ionic column densities\ndue to uncertainties in the published dielectronic recombination (DR) rate\ncoefficients. Based on our previous experimental work and a comparison of\npublished theoretical DR rates, we estimate there is in general a factor of 2\nuncertainty in existing DR rates used for modeling the IGM. We demonstrate that\nthis uncertainty results in factors of ~1.9 uncertainty in the predicted N V\nand Si IV column densities, ~1.6 for O VI, and ~1.7 for C IV. We show that\nthese systematic uncertainties translate into a systematic uncertainty of up to\na factor of ~3.1 in the Si/C abundance ratio inferred from observations. The\ninferred IGM abundance ratio could thus be less than the solar Si/C ratio or\ngreater than 3 times the solar ratio. If the latter is true, then it suggests\nthe metagalactic radiation field is not due purely to active galactic nuclei,\nbut includes a significant stellar component. Lastly, column density ratios of\nSi IV to C IV versus C II to C IV are often used to constrain the decrement in\nthe metagalactic radiation field at the He II absorption edge. We show that the\nvariation in the predicted Si IV to C IV ratio due to a factor of 2 uncertainty\nin the DR rates is almost as large as that due to a factor of 10 change in the\ndecrement. Laboratory measurements of the relevant DR resonance strengths and\nenergies are the only unambiguous method to remove the effects of these atomic\nphysics uncertainties from models of the IGM.\n", "  The main purpose of the paper is to present an overview of the current\nsituation in the development of understanding of the mechanism of high-Tc\nsuperconductivity which arises due to moderately strong, nonlinear\nelectron-phonon interactions and due to magnetic (spin) fluctuations.\n", "  Solving numerically master equation for a recently introduced urn model, we\nshow that the fourth- and sixth-order cumulants remain constant along an\nexactly located line of critical points. Obtained values are in very good\nagreement with values predicted by Brezin and Zinn-Justin for the Ising model\nabove the critical dimension. At the tricritical point cumulants acquire values\nwhich also agree with a suitably extended Brezin and Zinn-Justin approach.\n", "  The heat capacity of solid Kr-CH4 solutions with 30 and 60 mol.% CH4 has been\nstudied at 0.8-20 K. The contribution of the rotational subsystem Crot to the\nheat capacity of the solutions is separated. The results obtained in this study\nand Ref. [4] were used to estimate the difference between the lowest-level\nenergies of the nuclear spin A and T modifications of CH4 and to find the\ncharacteristic conversion times for the solutions with 5-60 mol.% CH4 at low\ntemperatures.\n", "  In this paper we study the steady uniform flows that develop when granular\nmaterial is released from a hopper on top of a static pile in a channel. We\nmore specifically focus on the role of side walls by carrying out experiments\nin setup of different widths, from narrow channels 20 particle diameters wide\nto channels 600 particle diameters wide. Results show that steady flows on pile\nare entirely controlled by side wall effects. A theoretical model, taking into\naccount the wall friction and based on a simple local constitutive law recently\nproposed for other granular flow configurations (GDR MiDi 2004), gives\npredictions in quantitative agreement with the measurements. This result gives\nnew insights in our understanding of free surface granular flows and strongly\nsupports the relevance of the constitutive law proposed.\n", "  We develop a supersymmetric field theoretical description of the Gaussian\nensemble of the almost diagonal Hermitian Random Matrices. The matrices have\nindependent random entries H_{ij} with parametrically small off-diagonal\nelements H_{ij}/H_{ii} ~ B << 1. We derive a regular virial expansion of\ncorrelation functions in the number of ``interacting'' supermatrices associated\nwith different sites in the real space and demonstrate that the perturbation\ntheory constructed in this way is controlled by a small parameter B. General\nform of the integral expression for the m-th virial coefficient governed by the\n``interaction'' of m supermatrices is presented and calculated explicitly in\nthe cases of 2- and 3-matrix ``interaction''. The suggested technique allows us\nto calculate both the spectral correlations and the correlations of the\neigenfunctions taken at different energies and in different space points.\n", "  The relation between atomic momenta fluctuations and density fluctuations is\nobtained in frames of mean-field approximation. Using two-time temperature\nGreen functions within Tyablikov approximation the equations for spin\nexcitation energy and damping are obtained. The asymptotics of energy and\ndamping in the long-wave limit are investigated and the anomalous behaviour of\nspin-wave stiffness constant is discussed.\n", "  By means of self-consistent semi-empirical LCAO calculations we study the\nitinerant magnetism of (Fe_{0.65}Ni_{0.35})_{1-y} Mn_y alloys for y between 0\nand 0.22 at T=0 K, neglecting only the transverse spin components. We find that\nthe magnetic behaviour is quite complicated on a local scale. In addition to\nferromagnetic behaviour, also metastable spin-glass-like configurations are\nfound. In the same approach, using a direct numerical calculation by the\nKubo-Formalism without any fit parameters, we also calculate the electrical\nconductance in the magnetic state and find that the $y$-dependence observed in\nthe experiments is well reproduced by our calculations, except of an overall\nfactor of rougly 5, by which our resistivities are too large.\n", "  We present a mesoscopic approach to analyze the dynamics of a single magnetic\ndipole under the influence of an oscillating magnetic field, based on the\nformulation of a Fokker-Planck equation. The dissipated power and the viscosity\nof a suspension of such magnetic dipoles are calculated from non-equilibrium\nthermodynamics of magnetized systems. By means of this method we have found a\nnon-monotonous behaviour of the viscosity as a function of the frequency of the\nfield which has been referred to as the ``negative'' viscosity effect.\nMoreover, we have shown that the viscosity depends on the vorticity field thus\nexhibiting non-Newtonian behaviour. Our analysis is complemented with numerical\nsimulations which reproduce the behaviour of the viscosity we have found and\nextend the scope of our analytical approach to higher values of the magnetic\nfield.\n", "  The inverse problem of finding the refraction coefficient of a shallow ocean\nfrom the observation of the extra Cauchy data for the acoustic field at the\nsurface of the ocean is studied.

For both cases we show how\nto derive\n  Schlesinger transformations together with their action on tau-function, and\nconstruct classes of solutions in terms of multi-dimensional theta-functions.\n", "  The dispersionless limit of generalized Drinfeld-Sokolov hierarchies\nassociated to primitive regular conjugacy class of Weyl group W(g) is\ndiscussed. The map from these generalized Drinfeld - Sokolov hierarchies to\nalgebraic solutions to WDVV equations has been constructed. Finite dimensional\ngeometry behind hierarchies is studied.\n  Example of g=D_4 and [w]=D_4(a_1) is considered in details and corresponding\nFrobenius structure is found.\n", "  A variety of universal similarity factorization equalities over real Clifford\nalgebras ${\\cal R}_{p,q}$ are established. On the basis of these equalities,\nreal, complex and quaternion matrix representations of elements in ${\\cal\nR}_{p,q}$ can be explicitly determined.\n", "  The concept of partnership of potentials is studied in detail and in\nparticular the non-uniqueness due to the ambiguity in the election of the\nfactorization energy and in the choice of the solution of certain Riccati\nequation. We generate new factorizations from old ones using invariance under\nparameter transformations. The theory is illustrated with some examples.\n", "  A theorem of Muhly-Renault-Williams states that if two locally compact\ngroupoids with Haar system are Morita equivalent, then their associated\nconvolution C*-algebras are strongly Morita equivalent.\n  We give a new proof of this theorem for Lie groupoids. Subsequently, we prove\na counterpart of this theorem in Poisson geometry: If two Morita equivalent Lie\ngroupoids are s-connected and s-simply connected, then their associated Poisson\nmanifolds (viz. the dual bundles to their Lie algebroids) are Morita equivalent\nin the sense of P. Xu.\n", "  We introduce the principle of Occam's Razor in a form which can be used as a\nbasis for economical formulations of physics.\n  This allows us to explain the general structure of the Lagrangian for a\ncomposite physical system, as well as some other artificial postulates behind\nthe variational formulations of physical laws.\n  As an example, we derive Hamilton's principle of stationary action together\nwith the Lagrangians for the cases of Newtonian mechanics, relativistic\nmechanics and a relativistic particle in an external gravitational field.\n", "  We study the stationary problem of a charged Dirac particle in (2+1)\ndimensions in the presence of a uniform magnetic field B and a singular\nmagnetic tube of flux Phi = 2 pi kappa/e. The rotational invariance of this\nconfiguration implies that the subspaces of definite angular momentum l+1/2 are\ninvariant under the action of the Hamiltonian H. We show that, for l different\nfrom the integer part of kappa, the restriction of H to these subspaces,\n  H_l is essentially self-adjoint, while for l equal to the integer part of\nkappa, H_l admits a one-parameter family of self-adjoint extensions (SAE). In\nthe later case, the functions in the domain of H_l are singular (but\nsquare-integrable) at the origin, their behavior being dictated by the value of\nthe parameter gamma that identifies the SAE. We also determine the spectrum of\nthe Hamiltonian as a function of kappa and gamma, as well as its closure.\n", "  The probabilities for gaps in the eigenvalue spectrum of finite $ N\\times N $\nrandom unitary ensembles on the unit circle with a singular weight, and the\nrelated hermitian ensembles on the line with Cauchy weight, are found exactly.\nThe finite cases for exclusion from single and double intervals are given in\nterms of second order second degree ODEs which are related to certain\n\\mbox{Painlev\\'e-VI} transcendents. The scaled cases in the thermodynamic limit\nare again second degree and second order, this time related to\n\\mbox{Painlev\\'e-V} transcendents. Using transformations relating the second\ndegree ODE and transcendent we prove an identity for the scaled bulk limit\nwhich leads to a simple expression for the spacing p.d.f. We also relate all\nthe variables appearing in the Fredholm determinant formalism to particular\n\\mbox{Painlev\\'e} transcendents, in a simple and transparent way, and exhibit\ntheir scaling behaviour.\n", "  An identification of a spherically symmetric potential by its phase shifts is\nan important physical problem. Recent theoretical results assure that such a\npotential is uniquely defined by a sufficiently large subset of its phase\nshifts at any one fixed energy level. However, two different potentials can\nproduce almost identical phase shifts. That is, the inverse problem of the\nidentification of a potential from its phase shifts at one energy level $k^2$\nis ill-posed, and the reconstruction is unstable. In this paper we introduce a\nquantitative measure $D(k)$ of this instability. The diameters of minimizing\nsets\n  $D(k)$ are used to study the change in the stability with the change of $k$,\nand the influence of noise on the identification. They are also used in the\nstopping criterion for the nonlinear minimization method IRRS (Iterative Random\nReduced Search). IRRS combines probabilistic global and deterministic local\nsearch methods and it is used for the numerical recovery of the potential by\nthe set of its phase shifts. The results of the identification for noiseless as\nwell as noise corrupted data are presented.\n", "  A multilayered particle is illuminated by plane acoustic or electromagnetic\nwaves of one or several frequencies. We consider the inverse scattering problem\nfor the identification of the layers and of the refraction coefficients of the\nscatterer in a non-Born region of scattering. Local deterministic and global\nprobabilistic minimization methods are studied. A special Reduction Procedure\nis introduced to reduce the dimensionality of the minimization space. Deep's\nand the Multilevel\n  Single-Linkage methods for global minimization are used for the solution of\nthe inverse problem. Their performance is analyzed for various multilayer\nconfigurations.\n", "  A class of spherical functions is studied which can be viewed as the matrix\ngeneralization of Bessel functions. We derive a recursive structure for these\nfunctions. We show that they are only special cases of more general radial\nfunctions which also have a, properly generalized, recursive structure. Some\nexplicit results are worked out.\n", "  The two main results of the article are concerned with Anderson Localization\nfor one-dimensional lattice Schroedinger operators with quasi-periodic\npotentials with d frequencies. First, in the case d = 1 or 2, it is proved that\nthe spectrum is pure-point with exponentially decaying eigenfunctions for all\npotentials (defined in terms of a trigonometric polynomial on the d-dimensional\ntorus) for which the Lyapounov exponents are strictly positive for all\nfrequencies and all energies. Second, for every non-constant real-analytic\npotential and with a Diophantine set of d frequencies, a lower bound is given\nfor the Lyapounov exponents for the same potential rescaled by a sufficiently\nlarge constant.\n", "  The general construction of quasi-classically concentrated solutions to the\nHartree-type equation, based on the complex WKB-Maslov method, is presented.\nThe formal solutions of the Cauchy problem for this equation, asymptotic in\nsmall parameter \\h (\\h\\to0), are constructed with a power accuracy of\nO(\\h^{N/2}), where N is any natural number. In constructing the\nquasi-classically concentrated solutions, a set of Hamilton-Ehrenfest equations\n(equations for middle or centered moments) is essentially used. The nonlinear\nsuperposition principle has been formulated for the class of quasi-classically\nconcentrated solutions of the Hartree-type equations. The results obtained are\nexemplified by the one-dimensional equation Hartree-type with a Gaussian\npotential.Comments: 6 pages, 4 figures, LaTeX Report no: Subj-class:\nAccelerator Physics\n", "  Continuous wavelet transforms arising from the quasiregular representation of\na semidirect product of a vector group with a matrix group\n  -- the so-called dilation group -- have been studied by various authors.\nRecently the attention has shifted from the irreducible case to include more\ngeneral dilation groups, for instance cyclic (more generally: discrete) or\none-parameter groups. These groups do not give rise to irreducible\nsquare-integrable representations, yet it is possible (and quite simple) to\ngive admissibility conditions for a large class of them.\n  We put these results in a theoretical context by establishing a connection to\nthe Plancherel theory of the semidirect products, and show how the\nadmissibility conditions relate to abstract admissibility conditions which use\nPlancherel theory.\n", "  We consider solutions of a Toda system for SU(N+1) and show that any solution\nwith finite exponential integral cam be obtained from a rational curve in\ncomplex projective space of dimension N\n", "  It's well known that Noether symmetries lead to the conservation laws.\nConserved quantities are constructed out of generator of the symmetry -\ninvariant Hamiltonian vector field. Considering more general class of vector\nfields - non-Hamiltonian ones leads to the notion of non-Noether symmetry and\nconservation laws (Lutzky's integrals of motion) with interesting properties.\n  In the present paper correspondence between non-Noether symmetries and\nconserved quantities in different types of dynamical systems (DS on symplectic,\npresymplectic and Poisson manifolds) is considered.\n", "  We introduce the notion of pseudo-Hermiticity and show that every Hamiltonian\nwith a real spectrum is pseudo-Hermitian. We point out that all the\nPT-symmetric non-Hermitian Hamiltonians studied in the literature belong to the\nclass of pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians, and argue that the basic structure\nresponsible for the particular spectral properties of these Hamiltonians is\ntheir pseudo-Hermiticity. We explore the basic properties of general\npseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians, develop pseudo-supersymmetric quantum mechanics,\nand study some concrete examples, namely the Hamiltonian of the two-component\nWheeler-DeWitt equation for the FRW-models coupled to a real massive scalar\nfield and a class of pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians with a real spectrum.\n", "  A geometrization of the Yang-Mills field, by which an SU(2) gauge theory\nbecomes equivalent to a 3-space geometry - or optical system - is examined. In\na first step, ambient space remains Euclidean and current problems on flat\nspace can be looked at from a new point of view. The Wu-Yang ambiguity, for\nexample, appears related to the multiple possible torsions of distinct\nmetric-preserving connections. In a second step, also the ambient space becomes\ncurved. In general, the strictly Riemannian, metric sector plays the role of an\narbitrary host space, with the gauge field represented by a contorsion. For\nsome field configurations, however, it is possible to obtain a purely metric\nrepresentation. In those cases, if the space is symmetric homogeneous the\nChristoffel connections are automatically solutions of the Yang-Mills\nequations.\n", "  As an outgrowth of our investigation of non-regular spaces within the context\nof quantum gravity and non-commutative geometry, we develop a graph Hilbert\nspace framework on arbitrary (infinite) graphs and use it to study spectral\nproperties of graph-Laplacians and graph-Dirac-operators. We define a spectral\ntriplet sharing most of the properties of what Connes calls a spectral triple.\nWith the help of this scheme we derive an explicit expression for the\nConnes-distance function on general directed or undirected graphs. We derive a\nseries of apriori estimates and calculate it for a variety of examples of\ngraphs. As a possibly interesting aside, we show that the natural setting of\napproaching such problems may be the framework of (non-)linear programming or\noptimization. We compare our results (arrived at within our particular\nframework) with the results of other authors and show that the seeming\ndifferences depend on the use of different graph-geometries and/or Dirac\noperators.\n", "  Ercolani and McLaughlin have recently shown that the zeros of the\nbi-orthogonal polynomials with the weight\n$w(x,y)=\\exp[-(V_1(x)+V_2(y)+2cxy)/2]$, relevant to a model of two coupled\nhermitian matrices, are real and simple. We show that their argument applies to\nthe more general case of the weight $(w_1*w_2*...*w_j)(x,y)$, a convolution of\nseveral weights of the same form. This general case is relevant to a model of\nseveral hermitian matrices coupled in a chain. Their argument also works for\nthe weight $W(x,y)=e^{-x-y}/(x+y)$, $0\\le x,y<\\infty$, and for a convolution of\nseveral such weights.\n", "  We consider nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equations in $\\R^3$. Assume that the\nlinear Hamiltonians have two bound states. For certain finite codimension\nsubset in the space of initial data, we construct solutions converging to the\nexcited states in both non-resonant and resonant cases. In the resonant case,\nthe linearized operators around the excited states are non-self adjoint\nperturbations to some linear Hamiltonians with embedded eigenvalues. Although\nself-adjoint perturbation turns embedded eigenvalues into resonances, this\nclass of non-self adjoint perturbations turn an embedded eigenvalue into two\neigenvalues with the distance to the continuous spectrum given to the leading\norder by the Fermi golden rule.\n", "  We completely classify diffeomorphism covariant local nets of von Neumann\nalgebras on the circle with central charge c less than 1. The irreducible ones\nare in bijective correspondence with the pairs of A-D_{2n}-E_{6,8} Dynkin\ndiagrams such that the difference of their Coxeter numbers is equal to 1. We\nfirst identify the nets generated by irreducible representations of the\nVirasoro algebra for c<1 with certain coset nets. Then, by using the\nclassification of modular invariants for the minimal models by\nCappelli-Itzykson-Zuber and the method of alpha-induction in subfactor theory,\nwe classify all local irreducible extensions of the Virasoro nets for c<1 and\ninfer our main classification result. As an application, we identify in our\nclassification list certain concrete coset nets studied in the literature.\n", "  A multisymplectic setting for classical field theories subjected to\nnon-holonomic constraints is presented. The infinite dimensional setting in the\nspace of Cauchy data is also given.\n", "  This paper presents a method to construct variational integrators for\ntime-dependent lagrangian systems.

For the spatial behaviour we use the\ntime-weighted surface power function method in order to obtain a more precisely\ndetermination of the domain of influence and we establish spatial decay\nestimates of Saint-Venant type with time-independent decay rate for the inside\nof the domain of influence. For the asymptotic temporal behaviour we use the\nCesaro means associated with the kinetic and strain energies and establish the\nasymptotic equipartition of the total energy.\n  A uniqueness theorem is proved for finite and infinite bodies and we note\nthat it is free of any kind of a priori assumptions of the solutions at\ninfinity.\n", "  A new geometrical setting for classical field theories is introduced. This\ndescription is strongly inspired in the one due to Skinner and Rusk for\nsingular lagrangians systems. For a singular field theory a constraint\nalgorithm is developed that gives a final constraint submanifold where a\nwell-defined dynamics exists. The main advantage of this algorithm is that the\nsecond order condition is automatically included.\n", "  In this paper we present the novel qualities of entanglement of formation for\ngeneral (so also infinite dimensional) quantum systems and we introduce the\nnotion of coefficient of quantum correlations. Our presentation stems from\nrigorous description of entanglement of formation.\n", "  In the paper we present the new approach to Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy and its\nquantization. Our presentation stems from an application of the Choquet theory\nto the theory of decompositions of states and therefore, it resembles our\nrigorous description of entanglement of formation\n", "  In [math-ph/0107005] we have proven that the generating function for\nself-avoiding branched polymers in D+2 continuum dimensions is proportional to\nthe pressure of the hard-core continuum gas at negative activity in D\ndimensions. This result explains why the critical behavior of branched polymers\nshould be the same as that of the $i \\phi^3$ (or Yang-Lee edge) field theory in\ntwo fewer dimensions (as proposed by Parisi and Sourlas in 1981).\n  -\n  In this article we review and generalize the results of [math-ph/0107005]. We\nshow that the generating functions for several branched polymers are\nproportional to correlation functions of the hard-core gas. We derive Ward\nidentities for certain branched polymer correlations. We give reduction\nformulae for multi-species branched polymers and the corresponding repulsive\ngases. Finally, we derive the massive scaling limit for the 2-point function of\nthe one-dimensional hard-core gas, and thereby obtain the scaling form of the\n2-point function for branched polymers in three dimensions.\n", "  After investigating by examples the unusual and striking elementary\nproperties of the Penrose tilings and the Arnold cat map, we associate a finite\nsymbolic dynamics with finite grammar rules to each of them. Instead of\nstudying these Markovian systems with the help of set-topology, which would\ngive only pathological results, a noncommutative approximately finite\nC*-algebra is associated to both systems. By calculating the K-groups of these\nalgebras it is demonstrated that this noncommutative point of view gives a much\nmore appropriate description of the phase space structure of these systems than\nthe usual topological approach.\n  With these specific examples it is conjectured that the methods of\nnoncommutative geometry could be successfully applied to a wider class of\ndynamical systems.\n", "  We present a new approach for constructing covariant symplectic structures\nfor geometrical theories, based on the concept of adjoint operators. Such\ngeometric structures emerge by direct exterior derivation of underlying\nsymplectic potentials. Differences and similarities with other approaches and\nfuture applications are discussed.\n", "  Q ball solutions are considered within the theory of a complex scalar field\nwith a gauged\n  U(1) symmetry and a parabolic-type potential. In the thin-walled limit, we\nshow explicitly that there is a maximum size for these objects because of the\nrepulsive Coulomb force. The size of Q ball will increase with the decrease of\nlocal minimum of the potential. And when the two minima degenerate, the energy\nstored within the surface of the Q ball becomes significant.\n  Furthermore, we find an analytic expression for gauged Q ball, which is\nbeyond the conventional thin-walled limit.\n", "  Originally, the SW-equations discovered by Seiberg-Witten are 1st-order PDE,\nwhich solutions (A,\\phi), with \\phi\\ne 0, are known as SW-monopoles. It is\nknown that the solutions of these 1st-order eq correspond to the minimum of\n  SW-functional. However, it is not true, that for all spin^{c} class \\alpha,\nthe minimum is always attained by this sort of solution. In fact, there are\nonly a finite number of \\alpha such that the minimum is a SW-monopole. We show\na necessary condition to be satisfied by the class \\alpha in order to the\nminimum be a SW-monopole.\n", "  This is the second of two papers on the end-to-end distance of a weakly\nself-repelling walk on a four dimensional hierarchical lattice. It completes\nthe proof that the expected value grows as a constant times \\sqrt{T} log^{1/8}T\n(1+O((log log T)/log T)), which is the same law as has been conjectured for\nself-avoiding walks on the simple cubic lattice Z^4.\n  -\n  Apart from completing the program in the first paper, the main result is that\nthe Green's function is almost equal to the Green's function for the Markov\nprocess with no self-repulsion, but at a different value of the killing rate\n\\beta which can be accurately calculated when the interaction is small.\nFurthermore, the Green's function is analytic in \\beta in a sector in the\ncomplex plane with opening angle greater than \\pi.\n", "  We calculate the autocorrelation functions (or shifted moments) of the\ncharacteristic polynomials of matrices drawn uniformly with respect to Haar\nmeasure from the groups U(N), O(2N) and USp(2N). In each case the result can be\nexpressed in three equivalent forms: as a determinant sum (and hence in terms\nof symmetric polynomials), as a combinatorial sum, and as a multiple contour\nintegral. These formulae are analogous to those previously obtained for the\nGaussian ensembles of Random Matrix Theory, but in this case are identities for\nany size of matrix, rather than large-matrix asymptotic approximations. They\nalso mirror exactly autocorrelation formulae conjectured to hold for\nL-functions in a companion paper. This then provides further evidence in\nsupport of the connection between Random Matrix Theory and the theory of\nL-functions.\n", "  We examine crossing probabilities and free energies for conformally invariant\ncritical 2-D systems in rectangular geometries, derived via conformal field\ntheory and Stochastic L\\\"owner Evolution methods. These quantities are shown to\nexhibit interesting modular behavior, although the physical meaning of modular\ntransformations in this context is not clear. We show that in many cases these\nfunctions are completely characterized by very simple transformation\nproperties. In particular, Cardy's function for the percolation crossing\nprobability (including the conformal dimension 1/3), follows from a simple\nmodular argument. A new type of \"higher-order modular form\" arises and its\nproperties are discussed briefly.\n", "  In this paper we show that the homogeneity of the Pfaffian form representing\nthe infinitesimal heat exchanged reversibly $\\delta Q_{rev}$ by a thermodynamic\nsystem allows to find immediately and explicitly an integrating factor. An\ninteresting bridge between Carath\\'eodory's approach to thermodynamics and\nGibbs' approach is established.\n", "  We prove that the evolutionary Navier-Stokes equation in n-D torus with\ninitial data in the class of distributions has an unique solution (local in t)\nthat is analytic by all variables. This solution presents as a series globally.\n", "  A geometric derivation of nonholonomic integrators is developed. It is based\nin the classical technique of generating functions adapted to the special\nfeatures of nonholonomic systems. The theoretical methodology and the\nintegrators obtained are, in general, different from the previously obtained.\n", "  A geometric derivation of numerical integrators for nonholonomic systems and\noptimal control problems is obtained. It is based in the classical technique of\ngenerating functions adapted to the special features of nonholonomic systems\nand optimal control problems.\n", "  We study a class of non-smooth asymptotically flat manifolds on which metrics\nfails to be $C^1$ across a hypersurface $\\Sigma$. We first give an\napproximation scheme to mollify the metric, then we prove that the Positive\nMass Theorem still holds on these manifolds if a geometric boundary condition\nis satisfied by metrics separated by $\\Sigma$.\n", "  Almost all presentations of Dirac theory in first or second quantization in\nPhysics (and Mathematics) textbooks make use of covariant Dirac spinor fields.\nAn exception is the presentation of that theory (first quantization) offered\noriginally by Hestenes and now used by many authors. There, a new concept of\nspinor field (as a sum of non homogeneous even multivectors fields) is used.\nHowever, a carefully analysis (detailed below) shows that the original Hestenes\ndefinition cannot be correct since it conflicts with the meaning of the Fierz\nidentities. In this paper we start a program dedicated to the examination of\nthe mathematical and physical basis for a comprehensive definition of the\nobjects used by Hestenes. In order to do that we give a preliminary definition\nof algebraic spinor fields (ASF) and Dirac-Hestenes spinor fields (DHSF) on\nMinkowski spacetime as some equivalence classes of well defined pairs of\nmathematical objects, one of the members of the pair being an even\nnonhomegeneous differential form.\n  The necessity of our definitions are shown by a carefull analysis of possible\nformulations of Dirac theory and the meaning of the set of Fierz identities.\n  We believe that the present paper clarifies some misunderstandings\n  (past and recent) appearing on the literature of the subject. It will be\nfollowed by a sequel paper where definitive definitions of ASF and DHSF are\ngiven as appropriate sections a vector bundle called the left spin-Clifford\nbundle. The present paper contains also Appendices (A-E) which exhibits a truly\nuseful collection of results concerning the theory of Clifford algebras\n(including many `tricks of the trade') necessary for the intelligibility of the\ntext.\n", "  As R.Feynman has shown to F. Dyson -- who published it then in 1990 under the\nname of \"Feynman's proof of Maxwell's equations\" -- the only interactions\ncompatible with the canonical uncertainty relation (for scalar particles on\nflat $\\R^3$) are the Lorentz covariant electromagnetic interactions. We\ngeneralize Feynman's argument to arbitrary configuration spaces, thereby\nclarifying its hidden assumptions as well as its geometrical significance. In\naddition, our result establishes a correspondence between globally hyperbolic\nspacetimes and solutions to our (algebraically formulated) axioms for\nnonrelativistic quantum mechanics.\n", "  An integral-differential equation is derived for the self-consistent\n(effective) field in the medium consisting of many small bodies randomly\ndistributed in some region. Acoustic and electromagnetic fields are considered\nin such a medium. Each body has a characteristic dimension $a\\ll\\lambda$, where\n$\\lambda$ is the wavelength in the free space.\n  The minimal distance $d$ between any of the two bodies satisfies the\ncondition $d\\gg a$, but it may also satisfy the condition $d\\ll\\lambda$. Using\nRamm's theory of wave scattering by small bodies of arbitrary shapes, the\nauthor derives an integral-differential equation for the self-consistent\nacoustic or electromagnetic fields in the above medium.\n", "  We study the Complex Ginzburg--Landau initial value problem $\\partial_t\nu=(1+i\\alpha) \\partial_x^2 u + u - (1+i\\beta) u |u|^2$, $u(x,0)=u_0(x)$ for a\ncomplex field $u\\in{\\bf C}$, with $\\alpha,\\beta\\in{\\bf R}$. We consider the\nBenjamin--Feir linear instability region $1+\\alpha\\beta=-\\epsilon^2$ with\n$\\epsilon\\ll1$ and $\\alpha^2<1/2$.\n  We show that for all $\\epsilon\\leq{\\cal O}(\\sqrt{1-2\\alpha^2} L_0^{-32/37})$,\nand for all initial data $u_0$ sufficiently close to 1 (up to a global phase\nfactor $\\ed^{i \\phi_0}, \\phi_0\\in{\\bf R}$) in the appropriate space, there\nexists a unique (spatially) periodic solution of space period $L_0$.\n  These solutions are small {\\em even} perturbations of the traveling wave\nsolution, $u=(1+\\alpha^2 s) \\ed^{i \\phi_0-i\\beta t} \\ed^{i\\alpha \\eta}$, and\n$s,\\eta$ have bounded norms in various $\\L^p$ and Sobolev spaces.\n  We prove that $s\\approx-{1/2} \\eta''$ apart from ${\\cal O}(\\epsilon^2)$\ncorrections whenever the initial data satisfy this condition, and that in the\nlinear instability range $L_0^{-1}\\leq\\epsilon\\leq{\\cal O}(L_0^{-32/37})$, the\ndynamics is essentially determined by the motion of the phase alone, and so\nexhibits `phase turbulence'.\n  Indeed, we prove that the phase $\\eta$ satisfies the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky\nequation $\\partial_t\\eta= -\\bigl({\\textstyle\\frac{1+\\alpha^2}{2}}\\bigr)\n\\triangle^2\\eta -\\epsilon^2\\triangle\\eta -{(1+\\alpha^2)} (\\eta')^2$ for times\n$t_0\\leq{\\cal O}(\\epsilon^{-52/5} L_0^{-32/5})$, while the amplitude\n$1+\\alpha^2 s$ is essentially constant.\n", "  In this paper the notion of Tulczyjew's triples in classical mechanics is\nextended to classical field theories, using the so-called multisymplectic\nformalism, and a convenient notion of lagrangian submanifold in multisymplectic\ngeometry. Accordingly, the dynamical equations are interpreted as the local\nequations defining these lagrangian submanifolds.\n", "  We apply the Linear Delta Expansion (LDE) to the Lindstedt-Poincare\n(``distorted time'') method to find improved approximate solutions to nonlinear\nproblems. We find that our method works very well for a wide range of\nparameters in the case of the anharmonic oscillator (Duffing equation) and of\nthe non-linear pendulum. The approximate solutions found with this method are\nbetter behaved and converge more rapidly to the exact ones than in the simple\nLindstedt-Poincar\\'e method.\n", "  We study the discrete spectrum of the Hamiltonian H = -Delta + V(r) for the\nCoulomb plus power-law potential V(r)=-1/r+ beta sgn(q)r^q, where beta > 0, q >\n-2 and q \\ne 0. We show by envelope theory that the discrete eigenvalues\nE_{n\\ell} of H may be approximated by the semiclassical expression\n  E_{n\\ell}(q) \\approx min_{r>0}\\{1/r^2-1/(mu r)+ sgn(q) beta(nu r)^q}.\n  Values of mu and nu are prescribed which yield upper and lower bounds.\nAccurate upper bounds are also obtained by use of a trial function of the form,\npsi(r)= r^{\\ell+1}e^{-(xr)^{q}}. We give detailed results for\n  V(r) = -1/r + beta r^q, q = 0.5, 1, 2 for n=1, \\ell=0,1,2, along with\ncomparison eigenvalues found by direct numerical methods.\n", "  We compute numerically eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the quantum\nHamiltonian that describes the quantum mechanics of a point particle moving\nfreely in a particular three-dimensional hyperbolic space of finite volume and\ninvestigate the distribution of the eigenvalues.\n", "  We extend the theory of decomposable maps by giving a detailed description of\nk-positive maps. A relation between transposition and modular theory is\nestablished. The structure of positive maps in terms of modular theory (the\ngeneralized Tomita-Takesaki scheme) is examined.\n", "  The problem of existence and uniqueness of a state of a joint system with\ngiven restrictions to subsystems is studied for a Fermion system, where a novel\nfeature is non-commutativity between algebras of subsystems.\n  For an arbitrary (finite or infinite) number of given subsystems, a product\nstate extension is shown to exist if and only if all states of subsystems\nexcept at most one are even (with respect to the Fermion number). If the states\nof all subsystems are pure, then the same condition is shown to be necessary\nand sufficient for the existence of any joint extension. If the condition\nholds, the unique product state extension is the only joint extension.\n  For a pair of subsystems, with one of the given subsystem states pure, a\nnecessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a joint extension and\nthe form of all joint extensions\n  (unique for almost all cases) are given.\n  For a pair of subsystems with non-pure subsystem states, some classes of\nexamples of joint extensions are given where non-uniqueness of joint extensions\nprevails.\n", "  The time-domain response of highly conducting targets following a rapidly\nterminated electromagnetic pulse displays three distinct regimes: early,\nintermediate and late time. The intermediate and late times are characterized\nby a superposition of exponentially decaying eigenmodes. At early time an ever\nincreasing number of rapidly decaying modes contribute, with the result that\nthe scattered electric field displays a universal $t^{-1/2}$ power law which\nemerges from the diffusive decay of a pattern of surface currents induced by\nthe pulse. The power law amplitude reflects the surface geometry of the target,\na property that may prove useful in buried target classification in geophysical\nremote sensing applications.\n", "  The group SU(2)*SU(2) acts naturally on SL(2,C) by simultaneous right and\nleft multiplication. We study the Kahler metrics invariant under this action\nusing global Kahler potentials. The volume growth and various curvature\nquantities are then explicitly computable. Examples include metrics of\npositive, negative and zero Ricci curvature, and the 1-lump metric of the\nCP^1-model on a sphere.\n  We then look at the holomorphic quantization of these metrics, where some\nphysically satisfactory results on the dimension of the Hilbert space can be\nobtained. These give rise to an interesting geometrical conjecture, regarding\nthe dimension of this space for general Stein manifolds in the semi-classical\nlimit.\n", "  We study the toy model of interacting open and closed string tachyons which\ndemonstrates some interesting properties of the unstable D-brane decay\nscenario. We compute a stress tensor of the system and study the energy and\npressure dynamics. We show that the total energy of the system is conserved. We\nseparate the stress tensor into two parts corresponding to open and closed\nstrings and study the energy flow from open to closed strings. The two vacua of\nthe system could be interpreted as corresponding to the unstable D-brane\nbackground and the open string tachyon vacuum. We study how for spatially\nhomogenous solution interpolating between these two vacua the total energy of\nthe open string dissipates to the closed string.\n", "  A realization of various algebraic structures in terms of the\n$C_{\\lambda}$-extended oscillator algebras is introduced. In particular, the\n$C_{\\lambda}$-extended oscillator algebras realization of\nFairlie-Fletcher-Zachos (FFZ)algebra is given. This latter lead easily to the\nrealization of the quantum $U_t(sl(2))$ algebra. The new deformed Virasoro\nalgebra is also presented.\n", "  New conjectures are proposed on the numbers of FPL configurations pertaining\nto certain types of link patterns. Making use of the Razumov and Stroganov\nAnsatz, these conjectures are based on the analysis of the ground state of the\nTemperley-Lieb chain, for periodic boundary conditions and so-called\n``identified connectivities'', up to size $2n=22$.\n", "  In Continuum Light Cone Quantization (CLCQ) the treatment of scalar fields as\noperator valued distributions and properties of the accompanying test functions\nare recalled. Due to the paracompactness property of the Euclidean manifold\nthese test functions appear as decomposition of unity. The approach is extended\nto QED\n  Dirac fields in a gauge invariant way. With such test functions the usual\ntriangle anomalies are calculated in a simple and transparent way.\n", "  We investigate the two-dimensional magnetic operator\n  $H_{c_0,B,\\beta} = {(-i\\nabla -A)}^{2}-\\beta\\delta(.-\\Gamma),$ where $\\Gamma$\nis a smooth loop. The vector potential has the form\n$A=c_0\\bigg(\\frac{-y}{{x^2+y^2}}; \\frac{x}{{x^2+y^2}} \\bigg)+\n\\frac{B}{2}\\bigg(-y; x\\bigg) $; $B>0,$ $c_0\\in]0;1[$. The asymptotics of\nnegative eigenvalues of $H_{c_0,B,\\beta}$ for $\\beta \\longrightarrow +\\infty$\nis found. We also prove that for large enough positive value of $\\beta$ the\nsystem exhibits persistent currents.\n", "  In the work it has been shown that there are two types of the conservation\nlaws.\n  1. The conservation laws that can be called exact ones. They point to an\navalability of some conservative quantities or objects. Such objects are the\nphysical structures, which the physical fields and relevant manifolds are\nconstructed of. These are conservation laws for physical fields.\n  2. The conservation laws of energy, linear and angular momentum, and mass.\nThese laws are conservation laws for material systems (material media). They\nestablish a balance between changes of physical quantities and external\nactions. Such conservation laws can be called as balance ones. It has been\nshown that the exact and balance conservation laws execute a relation between\nthe physical structures, which form physical fields, and material systems. The\nphysical structures, to which the exact conservation laws correspond, are\ngenerated by material systems in the evolutionary processes, whose moving force\nis the noncommutativity of the balance conservation laws. These results are\nobtained with the help of the mathematical apparatus of skew-symmetric\ndifferential forms.\n", "  We study the tunnelling trough a potential barrier of the system of two\nquantum correlated particles. The system is considered in one dimension. The\ninteraction with the barrier and between particles is approximated by\n$\\delta$-potentials. Assuming that the particles have the same masses, we\nreduce the problem to the set of independent planar scattering problems\ncorresponding to two-body flux symmetry with respect to the barrier. In order\nto solve the problems we apply the method of Sommerfeld-Maluzhinets integral\ntransformation, which requires the solution of a set of functional equations.\nWe show that the sub-problem which is antisymmetric with respect to the center\nof mass allows the solution in frames of the Bethe ansatz. So we give the exact\nsolution of this problem. For the subproblem which is symmetric we describe the\nclass of solutions for the functional equations and give an approach for\nobtaining the solution.\n", "  This paper is a didactic comment (a transcription with variations) to the\npaper of S.R.

We show that, if the spectrum of\nthe operator is symmetric with respect to the imaginary axis, then the\ndeterminant is real and its sign is determined by the parity of the number of\nthe eigenvalues of the operator, which lie on the positive part of the\nimaginary axis. It follows that, for many geometrically defined operators, the\nphase of the determinant is a topological invariant. In numerous examples,\ncoming from geometry and physics, we calculate the phase of the determinants in\npurely topological terms. Some of those examples were known in physical\nliterature, but no mathematically rigorous proofs and no general theory were\navailable until now.\n", "  These are six papers joined by the same title.

Using this\nnovel scheme we are able to generalize Noether's theorem in such a way that to\nany $n$-parameter continuous symmetry group of the Lagrangian there exist 1)\nthe usual $n$ constants of motion and 2) $n$ extra constants valid in the\nvariational equations. The new constants are related to the infinitesimal\ngenerators of the symmetry transformation by relations similar to the ones that\nstem from the `nonextended' Noether theorem.\n", "  In 1989, R. DiPerna and P.-L. Lions established the existence of global weak\nsolutions to the Vlasov-Maxwell system. In the present notes we give a somewhat\nsimplified proof of this result for the relativistic version of this system,\nthe main purpose being to make this important result of kinetic theory more\neasily accessible to newcomers in the field. We show that the weak solutions\npreserve the total charge.\n", "  The list of properties of Fibonacci numbers F(n) (with multifaceted relevance\nin physics) is complemented by an empirical observation that in combination\nwith the \"next\" family of the \"delayed Fibonacci\" numbers G(n) called, for\nconvenience, \"Gibonacci numbers\" here, both sets exhibit certain remarkable and\nfairly unexpected asymptotic mutual-bracketing properties.\n", "  It is shown that physical fields are formed by physical structures, which in\ntheir properties are differential-geometrical structures.\n  These results have been obtained due to using the mathematical apparatus of\nskew-symmetric differential forms.\n  This apparatus discloses the controlling role of the conservation laws in\nevolutionary processes, which proceed in material media and lead to origination\nof physical structures and forming physical fields and manifolds.\n", "  The presented method of investigating the solutions to differential equations\nis not new. Such an approach was developed by Cartan in his analysis of the\nintegrability of differential equations. Here this approach is outlined to\ndemonstrate the role of skew-symmetric differential forms.\n  The role of skew-symmetric differential forms in a qualitative investigation\nof the solutions to differential equations is conditioned by the fact that the\nmathematical apparatus of these forms enables one to determine the conditions\nof consistency for various elements of differential equations or for the system\nof differential equations. This enables one, for example, to define the\nconsistency of the partial derivatives in the partial differential equations,\nthe consistency of the differential equations in the system of differential\nequations, the conjugacy of the function derivatives and of the initial data\nderivatives in ordinary differential equations and so on. The functional\nproperties of the solutions to differential equations are just depend on\nwhether or not the conjugacy conditions are satisfied.\n", "  We show the existence of fundamental solutions for p-adic pseudo-differential\noperators with polynomial symbols.\n", "  Using the irreducible representations of the group $SO(d+1)$, we discuss the\ndegeneracy symmetry of hydrogen atom in $d$-dimensions and calculate its energy\nspectrum as well as the correspouding degeneracy. We show that $SO(d+1)$ is the\nenergy spectrum generating group\n", "  We construct linear Hamilton systems without usual dichotomy property.\n  The Ljapunov spectra of these systems are unfamiliar and conflicting, the\nbehaviour of trajectories is very complicated.\n  The paper's subject refers to some problems of indefinite inner product\nmethods in the stability theory of abstract dynamical equation solutions.\n", "  We study the representation theory of the superconformal algebra\n$W_k(g,f_{\\theta})$ associated with a minimal gradation of $g$. Here, $g$ is a\nsimple finite-dimensional Lie superalgebra with a non-degenerate, even\nsupersymmetric invariant bilinear form.

The group generated by reflections are\nemployed in the formulation of the required Green functions and the wave\nfunctions.\n", "  We develop some non-perturbative methods for studying the IDS in almost\nMathieu and related models. Assuming positive Lyapunov exponents, and assuming\nthat the potential function is a trigonometric polynomial of degree k, we show\nthat the Holder exponent of the IDS is almost 1/2k. We also show that this is\nstable under small perturbations of the potential (e.g., potentials which are\nclose to that of almost Mathieu again give rise to almost 1/2 Holder continuous\nIDS). Moreover, off a set of Hausdorff dimension zero the IDS is Lipschitz. We\nfurther deduce from these properties that the IDS is absolutely continuous for\nalmost every shift angle. The proof is based on large deviation theorems for\nthe entries of the transfer matrices in combination with the avalanche\nprinciple for non-unimodular matrices. These two are combined to yield a\nmultiscale approach to counting zeros of determinants which fall into small\ndisks. In addition, we develop a new mechanism of eliminating resonant phases,\nand use it to obtain lower bounds on the gap between Dirichlet eigenvalues. The\nlatter also uses the exponential localization of the eigenfunctions.\n", "  In this paper, we study the symmetry of quantum torus with the concept of\ncrossed product algebra. As a classical counterpart, we consider the orbifold\nof classical torus with complex structure and investigate the transformation\nproperty of classical theta function. An invariant function under the group\naction is constructed as a variant of the classical theta function. Then our\nmain issue, the crossed product algebra representation of quantum torus with\ncomplex structure under the symplectic group is analyzed as a quantum version\nof orbifolding.\n  We perform this analysis with Manin's so-called model II quantum theta\nfunction approach. The symplectic group Sp(2n,Z) satisfies the consistency\ncondition of crossed product algebra representation. However, only a subgroup\nof Sp(2n,Z) satisfies the consistency condition for orbifolding of quantum\ntorus.\n", "  For a wide class of two-body energy operators $h(k)$ on the three-dimensional\nlattice $\\bbZ^3$, $k$ being the two-particle quasi-momentum, we prove that if\nthe following two assumptions (i) and (ii) are satisfied, then for all\nnontrivial values $k$, $k\\ne 0$, the discrete spectrum of $h(k)$ below its\nthreshold is non-empty.

Henry Poincare proved in his dictum that due to the\nnature of the instabilities involved in the problem, it could not be solved.\nYet closed form approximations for the problem can be found and it is on these\nlines that we will explore the problem. It will be shown that closed form\napproximations for the associated trajectories can be found.\n", "  A statistical mechanics argument relating partition functions to martingales\nis used to get a condition under which random geometric processes can describe\ninterfaces in 2d statistical mechanics at criticality. Requiring multiple SLEs\nto satisfy this condition leads to some natural processes, which we study in\nthis note. We give examples of such multiple SLEs and discuss how a choice of\nconformal block is related to geometric configuration of the interfaces and\nwhat is the physical meaning of mixed conformal blocks. We illustrate the\ngeneral ideas on concrete computations, with applications to percolation and\nthe Ising model.\n", "  The general approach to chain equations derivation for the function generated\nby a Miura transformation analog is developing to account evolution (second Lax\nequation) and illustrated for\n  Sturm-Liouville differential and difference operators. Polynomial\ndifferential operators case is investigated. Covariant sets of potentials are\nintroduced by a periodic chain closure. The symmetry of the system of equation\nwith respect to permutations of the potentials is used for the direct\nconstruction of solutions of the chain equations.\n  A \"time\" evolution associated with some Lax pair is incorporated in the\napproach via closed t-chains. Both chains are combined in equations of a\nhydrodynamic type.

We argue\nsemi-classically on the basis of a mathematically rigorous version of\nGutzwiller's trace formula which expresses spectral statistics in term of\nclassical orbits. A critical point of the potential with zero momentum is an\nequilibrium of the flow and generates certain singularities in the spectrum.\nVia sharp spectral estimates, this fluctuation indicates the presence of a\ncritical point and allows to reconstruct partially the local shape of the\npotential. Some generalizations of this approach are also proposed.\\medskip\nkeywords : Semi-classical analysis; Schr\\\"odinger operators; Equilibriums in\nclassical mechanics.\n", "  Chessboard estimates are one of the standard tools for proving phase\ncoexistence in spin systems of physical interest. In this note we show that the\nmethod not only produces a point in the phase diagram where more than one Gibbs\nstates coexist, but that it can also be used to rule out the existence of\nshift-ergodic states that differ significantly from those proved to exist.\n  For models depending on a parameter (say, the temperature), this shows that\nthe values of the conjugate thermodynamic quantity (the energy) inside the\n\"transitional gap\" are forbidden in all shift-ergodic Gibbs states.

Therefore a conventional way to present a simple Lie algebra G is by\nsplitting it into the direct sum of a commutative Cartan subalgebra and two\nmaximal nilpotent subalgebras (positive and negative) and together the\ngenerators of both these nilpotent subalgebras together generate G. Though\nthere are many relations between these generators, they are neat (Serre\nrelations).\n  It is possible to determine the relations for generators of different type,\ne.g, with the principal embeddings of sl(2) into G one can associate only TWO\nelements that generate G.

In the present paper, we offer a detailed derivation of the\nabove result by concentrating on the proof of the Pfaffian integration theorem,\nthe key ingredient of our analysis of the statistics of real eigenvalues in the\nGinOE. We also initiate a study of the correlations of complex eigenvalues and\nderive a formula for the joint probability density function of all complex\neigenvalues of a GinOE matrix restricted to have exactly \"k\" real eigenvalues.\nIn the particular case of \"k=0\", all correlation functions of complex\neigenvalues are determined.\n", "  In this work we introduce the Killing-Yano symmetry on the phase space and we\ninvestigate the symplectic structure on the space of Killing-Yano tensors.

Such ensembles play a\ncentral role in mesoscopic physics since they describe the universal ergodic\nlimit of disordered and chaotic single particle systems. The generating\nfunction for the spectral correlations of each ensemble is reduced to an\nintegral over a Riemannian symmetric superspace in the limit of large matrix\ndimension. Such a space is defined as a pair (G/H,M_r) where G/H is a\ncomplex-analytic graded manifold homogeneous with respect to the action of a\ncomplex Lie supergroup G, and M_r is a maximal Riemannian submanifold of the\nsupport of G/H.\n", "  The family F of all potentials V(x) for which the Hamiltonian H in one space\ndimension possesses a high order Lie symmetry is determined.

Simultaneously we derive\nsemiclassical asymptotics for the recursive coefficients of the orthogonal\npolynomials, and we show that these coefficients form a cycle of period two\nwhich drifts slowly with the change of the ratio n/N. The proof of the\nsemiclassical asymptotics is based on the methods of the theory of integrable\nsystems and on the analysis of the appropriate matrix Riemann-Hilbert problem.\nAs an application of the semiclassical asymptotics of the orthogonal\npolynomials, we prove the universality of the local distribution of eigenvalues\nin the matrix model with the double-well quartic interaction in the presence of\ntwo cuts.\n", "  Let U be a multiply-connected region in R^2 with smooth boundary.

It is pointed out that the introduction of\nthe equivalence being consistent with the mathematical definition is possible\nonly in theories constructed on non-standard number spaces by taking the\nexperimental errors as infinitesimal numbers. Following the idea for the\nequivalence, a new description of space-time $\\SL$ in terms of\ninfinitesimal-lattice points on non-standard real number space $\\SR$ is\nproposed. By using infinitesimal neighborhoos ($\\MON$) of real number r on\n$\\SL$ we can make a space $\\SM$ which is isomorphic to $\\RE$ as additive group.\nTherefore, every point on $(\\SM)^N$ automatically has the internal\nconfined-subspace $\\MON$. A field theory on $\\SL$ is proposed. It is shown that\nU(1) and SU(N) symmetries on the space $(\\SM)^N$ are induced from the internal\nsubstructure $(\\MON)^N$.

It carries most fundamental (\"topological\")\ninformation about algebra under consideration. At present, because of the need\nfor very tedious algebraic computation, the explicitly computed cohomology for\ndifferent classes of Lie (super)algebras is known only in a few cases. That is\nwhy application of computer algebra methods is important for this problem. We\ndescribe here an algorithm and its C implementation for computing the\ncohomology of Lie algebras and superalgebras. The program can proceed\nfinite-dimensional algebras and infinite-dimensional graded algebras with\nfinite-dimensional homogeneous components. Among the last algebras Lie algebras\nand superalgebras of formal vector fields are most important. We present some\nresults of computation of cohomology for Lie superalgebras of Buttin vector\nfields and related algebras. These algebras being super-analogs of Poisson and\nHamiltonian algebras have found many applications to modern supersymmetric\nmodels of theoretical and mathematical physics.\n", "  For certain one-dimensional Schroedinger-type difference operators with a\ncomplex potential, a \"complete\" set of exponentially decaying eigenvectors is\nshown to exist. \"Completeness\" entails that the parameters involved are\nobtained through evaluation of analytic functions on a Riemann surface.\n", "  To every elliptic Calabi-Yau threefold with a section $X$ there can be\nassociated a Lie group $G$ and a representation $\\rho$ of that group. The group\nis determined from the Weierstrass model, which has singularities that are\ngenerically rational double points; these double points lead to local factors\nof $G$ which are either the corresponding A-D-E groups or some associated\nnon-simply laced groups.\n  The representation $\\rho$ is a sum of representations coming from the local\nfactors of $G$, and of other representations which can be associated to the\npoints at which the singularities are worse than generic.\n  This construction first arose in physics, and the requirement of anomaly\ncancellation in the associated physical theory makes some surprising\npredictions about the connection between $X$ and $\\rho$. In particular, an\nexplicit formula (in terms of $\\rho$) for the Euler characteristic of $X$ is\npredicted. We give a purely mathematical proof of that formula in this paper,\nintroducing along the way a new invariant of elliptic Calabi-Yau threefolds. We\nalso verify the other geometric predictions which are consequences of anomaly\ncancellation, under some (mild) hypotheses about the types of singularities\nwhich occur.\n  As a byproduct we also discover a novel relation between the Coxeter number\nand the rank in the case of the simply laced groups in the ``exceptional\nseries'' studied by Deligne.\n", "  The \"quantum-event / prime ideal in a category/ noncommutative-point\"\nalternative to \"classical-event / commutative prime ideal/ point\" is suggested.\n  Ideals in additive categories, prime spectra and representation of quivers\nare considered as mathematical tools appropriate to model quantum mechanics.\nThe space-time framework is to be reconstructed from the spectrum of the path\ncategory of a quiver.\n  The interference experiment is considered as an example.\n", "  For a domain $\\Omega$ contained in a hemisphere of the $n$-dimensional sphere\n$\\SS^n$ we prove the optimal result $\\lambda_2/\\lambda_1(\\Omega) \\le\n\\lambda_2/\\lambda_1(\\Omega^{\\star})$ for the ratio of its first two Dirichlet\neigenvalues where $\\Omega^{\\star}$, the symmetric rearrangement of $\\Omega$ in\n$\\SS^n$, is a geodesic ball in $\\SS^n$ having the same $n$-volume as $\\Omega$.\nWe also show that $\\lambda_2/\\lambda_1$ for geodesic balls of geodesic radius\n$\\theta_1$ less than or equal to $\\pi/2$ is an increasing function of\n$\\theta_1$ which runs between the value $(j_{n/2,1}/j_{n/2-1,1})^2$ for\n$\\theta_1=0$ (this is the Euclidean value) and $2(n+1)/n$ for $\\theta_1=\\pi/2$.\nHere $j_{\\nu,k}$ denotes the $k^{th}$ positive zero of the Bessel function\n$J_{\\nu}(t)$. This result generalizes the Payne-P\\'{o}lya-Weinberger\nconjecture, which applies to bounded domains in Euclidean space and which we\nhad proved earlier. Our method makes use of symmetric rearrangement of\nfunctions and various technical properties of special functions. We also prove\nthat among all domains contained in a hemisphere of $\\SS^n$ and having a fixed\nvalue of $\\lambda_1$ the one with the maximal value of $\\lambda_2$ is the\ngeodesic ball of the appropriate radius. This is a stronger, but slightly less\naccessible, isoperimetric result than that for $\\lambda_2/\\lambda_1$. Various\nother results for $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$ of geodesic balls in $\\SS^n$ are\nproved in the course of our work.\n", "  It is well known that for irreducible, square-integrable representations of a\nlocally compact group, there exist so-called admissible vectors which allow the\nconstruction of generalized continuous wavelet transforms.\n  In this paper we discuss when the irreducibility requirement can be dropped,\nusing a connection between generalized wavelet transforms and Plancherel\ntheory. For unimodular groups with type I regular representation, the existence\nof admissible vectors is equivalent to a finite measure condition. The main\nresult of this paper states that this restriction disappears in the\nnonunimodular case: Given a nondiscrete, second countable group $G$ with type I\nregular representation $\\lambda_G$, we show that $\\lambda_G$ itself\n  (and hence every subrepresentation thereof) has an admissible vector in the\nsense of wavelet theory iff $G$ is nonunimodular.\n", "  In this paper, the averaging principle for quasi-geostrophic motions with\nrapidly oscillating forcing is proved, both on finite but large time intervals\nand on the entire time axis. This includes comparison estimate, stability\nestimate, and convergence result between quasi-geostrophic motions and its\naveraged motions. Furthermore, the existence of almost periodic\nquasi-geostrophic motions and attractor convergence are also investigated.\n", "  For For a given PDE system, or an exterior differential system possessing a\nLie group of internal symmetries the orbit reduction procedure is introduced.\nIt is proved that the solutions of the reduced exterior differential system are\nin one-to-one correspondence with the moduli space of regular solutions of the\nprolongation of the original system.\n  The isomorphism between the local characteristic cohomology of the reduced\nunconstrained jet space and the Lie algebra cohomology of the symmetry group is\nestablished.\n  The group-invariant Euler-Lagrange equations of an invariant variational\nproblem are described as a composition of the Euler-Lagrange operators on the\nreduced jet space and certain other differential operators on the reduced jet\nspace. The practical algorithm of computing these operators is given.\n", "  This is a survey article on the recent development of\n  \"stringy geometry and topology of orbifolds\", a new subject of mathematics\nmotivated by orbifold string theory.\n", "  The three-dimensional baroclinic quasigeostrophic flow model has been widely\nused to study basic mechanisms in oceanic flows and climate dynamics. In this\npaper, we consider this flow model under random wind forcing and time-periodic\nfluctuations on fluid boundary (the interface between the oceans and the\natmosphere). The time-periodic fluctuations are due to periodic rotation of the\nearth and thus periodic exposure of the earth to the solar radiation. After\nestablishing the well-posedness of the baroclinic quasigeostrophic flow model\nin the state space, we demonstrate the existence of the random attractors,\nagain in the state space. We also discuss the relevance of our result to\nclimate modeling.\n", "  In this paper we consider dynamical r-matrices over a nonabelian base. There\nare two main results. First, corresponding to a fat reductive decomposition of\na Lie algebra $\\frakg =\\frakh \\oplus \\frakm$, we construct geometrically a\nnon-degenerate triangular dynamical r-matrix using symplectic fibrations.\nSecond, we prove that a triangular dynamical r-matrix $r: \\frakh^* \\lon\n\\wedge^2 \\frakg$ corresponds to a Poisson manifold $\\frakh^* \\times G$. A\nspecial type of quantizations of this Poisson manifold, called compatible star\nproducts in this paper, yields a generalized version of the quantum dynamical\nYang-Baxter equation\n  (or Gervais-Neveu-Felder equation). As a result, the quantization problem of\na general dynamical r-matrix is proposed.\n", "  We investigate the ergodicity of 2D large scale quasigeostrophic flows under\nrandom wind forcing. We show that the quasigeostrophic flows are ergodic under\nsuitable conditions on the random forcing and on the fluid domain, and under no\nrestrictions on viscosity, Ekman constant or Coriolis parameter. When these\nconditions are satisfied, then for any observable of the quasigeostrophic\nflows, its time average approximates the statistical ensemble average, as long\nas the time interval is sufficiently long.\n", "  The two-layer quasigeostrophic flow model is an intermidiate system between\nthe single-layer 2D barotropic flow model and the continuously stratified, 3D\nbaroclinic flow model. This model is widely used to investigate basic\nmechanisms in geophysical flows, such as baroclinic effects, the Gulf Stream\nand subtropical gyres. The wind forcing acts only on the top layer. We consider\nthe two-layer quasigeostrophic model under stochastic wind forcing. We first\ntransformed this system into a coupled system of random partial differential\nequations and then show that the asymptotic probabilistic dynamics of this\nsystem depends only on the top fluid layer. Namely, in the probability sense\nand asymptotically, the dynamics of the two-layer quasigeostrophic fluid system\nis determinied by the top fluid layer, or, the bottom fluid layer is slaved by\nthe top fluid layer.\n  This conclusion is true provided that the Wiener process and the fluid\nparameters satisfy a certain condition. In particular, this latter condition is\nsatisfied when the trace of the covariance operator of the Wiener process is\ncontroled by a certain upper bound, and the Ekman constant $r$ is sufficiently\nlarge. Note that the generalized time derivative of the Wiener process models\nthe fluctuating part of the wind stress forcing on the top fluid layer, and the\nEkman constant $r$ measures the rate for vorticity decay due to the friction in\nthe bottom Ekman layer.\n", "  In this paper we show that all totally real superconformal minimal tori in\n$CP^2$ correspond with doubly-periodic finite gap solutions of the Tzitzeica\nequation\n  $$\\omega_{z{\\overline z}}=e^{-2\\omega}-e^{\\omega}$$\n  Using the results on the Tzitzeica equation in integrable system theory, we\ndescribe explicitly all these tori by Prym-theta functions.\n", "  The ocean thermohaline circulation, also called meridional overturning\ncirculation, is caused by water density contrasts. This circulation has large\ncapacity of carrying heat around the globe and it thus affects the energy\nbudget and further affects the climate. We consider a thermohaline circulation\nmodel in the meridional plane under external wind forcing. We show that, when\nthere is no wind forcing, the stream function and the density fluctuation\n(under appropriate metrics) tend to zero exponentially fast as time goes to\ninfinity. With rapidly oscillating wind forcing, we obtain an averaging\nprinciple for the thermohaline circulation model. This averaging principle\nprovides convergence results and comparison estimates between the original\nthermohaline circulation and the averaged thermohaline circulation, where the\nwind forcing is replaced by its time average. This establishes the validity for\nusing the averaged thermohaline circulation model for numerical simulations at\nlong time scales.\n", "  Enstrophy is an averaged measure of fluid vorticity. This quantity is\nparticularly important in {\\em rotating} geophysical flows. We investigate the\ndynamical evolution of enstrophy for large-scale quasi-geostrophic flows under\nrandom wind forcing. We obtain upper bounds on the enstrophy, as well as\nresults establishing its H\\\"older continuity and describing the small-time\nasymptotics.\n", "  This is the first in a series Of papers in which we initiate the study Of\nvery rough solutions to the initial value problem for the Einstein Vacuum\nequations expressed relative to wave coordinates. By very rough we mean\nsolutions which cannot be constructed by the classical techniques Of energy\nestimates and Sobolev inequalities. Following our previous work on quasilinear\nwave equations we develop new analytic methods based on Strichartz type\ninequalities which results in a gain of half a derivative relative to the\nclassical result. Thus our result requires only $H^{2+\\epsilon}$ regularity for\nthe data.\n  Our methods blend paradifferential techniques with a geometric approach to\nthe derivation of decay estimates. The latter allows us to take full advantage\nof the specific structure of the Einstein equations.\n", "  This is the second in a series of three papers in which we initiate the study\nof very rough solutions to the initial value problem for the Einstein vacuum\nequations expressed relative to wave coordinates. By very rough we mean\nsolutions which cannot be constructed by the classical techniques of energy\nestimates and Sobolev inequalities. In this paper we develop the geometric\nanalysis of the Eikinal equation for microlocalized rough\n  Einstein metrics. This is a crucial step in the derivation of the decay\nestimates needed in our first paper.\n", "  Random walks on general graphs play an important role in the understanding of\nthe general theory of stochastic processes. Beyond their fundamental interest\nin probability theory, they arise also as simple models of physical systems. A\nbrief survey of the physical relevance of the notion of random walk on both\nundirected and directed graphs is given followed by the exposition of some\nrecent results on random walks on randomly oriented lattices.\n  It is worth noticing that general undirected graphs are associated with (not\nnecessarily Abelian) groups while directed graphs are associated with (not\nnecessarily Abelian) $C^*$-algebras. Since quantum mechanics is naturally\nformulated in terms of $C^*$-algebras, the study of random walks on directed\nlattices has been motivated lately by the development of the new field of\nquantum information and communication.\n", "  Various concepts associated with quadratic algebras admit natural\ngeneralizations when the quadratic algebras are replaced by graded algebras\nwhich are finitely generated in degree 1 with homogeneous relations of degree\nN. Such algebras are referred to as {\\sl homogeneous algebras of degree N}. In\nparticular it is shown that the Koszul complexes of quadratic algebras\ngeneralize as N-complexes for homogeneous algebras of degree N.\n", "  We investigate the deformation theory of a class of generalized calibrations\nin Riemannian manifolds for which the tangent bundle has reduced structure\ngroup U(n), SU(n), G_2 and Spin(7). For this we use the property of the\nassociated calibration form to be parallel with respect to a metric connection\nwhich may have non-vanishing torsion. In all these cases, we find that if there\nis a moduli space, then it is finite dimensional.\n  We present various examples of generalized calibrations that include almost\nhermitian manifolds with structure group U(n) or SU(n), nearly parallel G_2\nmanifolds and group manifolds. We find that some Hopf fibrations are\ndeformation families of generalized calibrations. In addition, we give\nsufficient conditions for a hermitian manifold (M,g,J) to admit Chern and\nBismut connections with holonomy contained in SU(n). In particular we show that\nany connected sum of $k \\geq 3$ copies of $S^3 \\times S^3$ admits a hermitian\nstructure for which the restricted holonomy of a Bismut connection is contained\nin SU(3).\n", "  We present an introduction to the geometry of higher order vector and\nco--vector bundles (including higher order generalizations of the Finsler\ngeometry and Kaluza--Klein gravity) and review the basic results on Clifford\nand spinor structures on spaces with generic local anisotropy modeled by higher\norder nonlinear connections. Geometric applications in locally anisotropic\ngravity and matter field interactions are considered. This article contains a\npart of material given by these authors and P. Stavrinos in theirs lectures.\n", "  Some unexpected properties of the cubic algebra generated by the covariant\nderivatives of a generic Yang-Mills connection over the (s+1)-dimensional\npseudo Euclidean space are pointed out. This algebra is Gorenstein and Koszul\nof global dimension 3 but except for s=1 (i.e. in the 2-dimensional case) where\nit is the universal enveloping algebra of the Heisenberg Lie algebra and is a\ncubic Artin-Schelter regular algebra, it fails to be regular in that it has\nexponential growth. We give an explicit formula for the Poincare series of this\nalgebra A and for the dimension in degree n of the graded Lie algebra of which\nA is the universal enveloping algebra.\n  In the 4-dimensional (i.e. s=3) Euclidean case, a quotient of this algebra is\nthe quadratic algebra generated by the covariant derivatives of a generic\n(anti) self-dual connection. This latter algebra is Koszul of global dimension\n2 but is not Gorenstein and has exponential growth. It is the universal\nenveloping algebra of the graded Lie-algebra which is the semi-direct product\nof the free Lie algebra with three generators of degree one by a derivation of\ndegree one.\n", "  We consider the scaling limit of linear statistics for eigenphases of a\nmatrix taken from one of the classical compact groups. We compute their moments\nand find that the first few moments are Gaussian, whereas the limiting\ndistribution is not. The precise number of Gaussian moments depends upon the\nparticular statistic considered.\n", "  We shall give bounds on the spacing of zeros of certain functions belonging\nto the Laguerre-Polya class and satisfying a second order differential\nequation. As a corollary we establish new sharp inequalities on the extreme\nzeros of the Hermite, Laguerre and Jacobi polinomials, which are uniform in all\nthe parameters.\n", "  This is the second in a series of five papers math.DG/0211294,\nmath.DG/0302355, math.DG/0302356, math.DG/0303272 studying special Lagrangian\nsubmanifolds (SL m-folds) X in (almost) Calabi-Yau m-folds M with singularities\nx_1,...,x_n locally modelled on special Lagrangian cones C_1,...,C_n in C^m\nwith isolated singularities at 0. Readers are advised to begin with the final\npaper math.DG/0303272 which surveys the series, gives examples, and proves some\nconjectures.\n  In this paper we study the deformation theory of compact SL m-folds X in M\nwith conical singularities. We define the moduli space M_X of deformations of X\nin M, and construct a natural topology on it. Then we show that M_X is locally\nhomeomorphic to the zeroes of a smooth map \\Phi : I --> O between\nfinite-dimensional vector spaces.\n  Here the infinitesimal deformation space I depends only on the topology of X,\nand the obstruction space O only on the cones C_1,...,C_n at x_1,...,x_n. If\nthe cones C_i are \"stable\" then O is zero and M_X is a smooth manifold. We also\nextend our results to families of almost Calabi-Yau structures on M.\n  The first paper math.DG/0211294 laid the foundations for the series, and\nstudied the regularity of X near its singular points. The third and fourth\npapers math.DG/0302355, math.DG/0302356 construct desingularizations of X,\nrealizing X as the limit of a family N^t of compact, nonsingular SL m-folds in\nM.\n", "  The infinite dimensional Clifford Algebra has a maze of irreducible unitary\nrepresentations. Here we determine their type -real, complex or quaternionic.\nSome, related to the Fermi-Fock representations, have no real or quetrnionic\nstructures. But there are many on L(2) of the circle that do and which seem to\nhave analytic meaning.\n", "  We propose the first algebraic determinantal formula to enumerate tilings of\na centro-symmetric octagon of any size by rhombi. This result uses the\nGessel-Viennot technique and generalizes to any octagon a formula given by\nElnitsky in a special case.\n", "  The relation between differential geometry of surfaces and some Heisenberg\nferromagnet models is considered.\n", "  An independent random cascade measure is specified by a random generator, a\nvector of dimension c with non-negative components. The dimension c is called\nthe branching cascade parameter. It is shown under certain restrictions that,\nif this measure has two generators with a.s. positive components, and the ratio\nln c_1/ln c_2 for their branching parameters is an irrational number, then this\nmeasure is a Lebesgue measure. In other words, when c is a power of an integer\nnumber p and the p is minimal for c, then a cascade measure that has the\nproperty of intermittency specifies p uniquely.\n", "  The multiple gamma function $\\Gamma_n$, defined by a recurrence-functional\nequation as a generalization of the Euler gamma function, was originally\nintroduced by Kinkelin, Glaisher, and Barnes around 1900. Today, due to the\npioneer work of Conrey, Katz and Sarnak, interest in the multiple gamma\nfunction has been revived. This paper discusses some theoretical aspects of the\n$\\Gamma_n$ function and their applications to summation of series and infinite\nproducts.\n", "  One of the central difficulties of settling the $L^2$-bounded curvature\nconjecture for the Einstein -Vacuum equations is to be able to control the\ncausal structure of spacetimes with such limited regularity.\n  In this paper we show how to circumvent this difficulty by showing that the\ngeometry of null hypersurfaces of Enstein-Vacuum spacetimes can be controlled\nin terms of initial data and the total curvature flux through the hypersurface.\n", "  We discuss a functional model for multi--diagonal selfadjoint operators with\nalmost periodic coefficients that generalizes the well known model for finite\nband Jacobi matrices. It give us an opportunity to construct examples of almost\nperiodic operators with different spectral properties.\n  Main result deals with an exact condition for the uniqueness of the model of\nthe given type.\n", "  Some little step forward is made in the analysis of the mathematical\nstructure of Tonal Harmony, a task begun by Galilei, Euler and the Lagrange of\nthe first two volumes of Miscellania Taurinensia\n", "  We find a Hermite-type basis for which the eigenvalue problem associated to\nthe operator $H_{A,B}:=B(-\\partial_x^2)+Ax^2$ acting on $L^2({\\bf R};{\\bf\nC}^2)$ becomes a three-terms recurrence. Here $A$ and $B$ are two constant\npositive definite matrices with no other restriction. Our main result provides\nan explicit characterization of the eigenvectors of $H_{A,B}$ that lie in the\nspan of the first four elements of this basis when $AB\\not= BA$.\n", "  We consider the problem of scattering for the long range critical nonlinear\nKlein-Gordon in one space dimension.\n", "  We survey the geometry of Lagrange and Finsler spaces and discuss the issues\nrelated to the definition of curvature of nonholonomic manifolds enabled with\nnonlinear connection structure. It is proved that any commutative Riemannian\ngeometry (in general, any Riemann--Cartan space) defined by a generic\noff--diagonal metric structure (with an additional affine connection possessing\nnontrivial torsion) is equivalent to a generalized Lagrange, or Finsler,\ngeometry modeled on nonholonomic manifolds. This results in the problem of\nconstructing noncommutative geometries with local anisotropy, in particular,\nrelated to geometrization of classical and quantum mechanical and field\ntheories, even if we restrict our considerations only to commutative and\nnoncommutative Riemannian spaces. We elaborate a geometric approach to the\nClifford modules adapted to nonlinear connections, to the theory of spinors and\nthe Dirac operators on nonholonomic spaces and consider possible\ngeneralizations to noncommutative geometry. We argue that any commutative\n  Riemann--Finsler geometry and generalizations my be derived from\nnoncommutative geometry by applying certain methods elaborated for Riemannian\nspaces but extended to nonholonomic frame transforms and manifolds provided\nwith nonlinear connection structure.\n", "  Given uniform probability on words of length M=Np+k, from an alphabet of size\np, consider the probability that a word\n  (i) contains a subsequence of letters (p, p-1,...,1) in that order and\n  (ii) that the maximal length of the disjoint union of p-1 increasing\nsubsequences of the word is \\leq M-N . A generating function for this\nprobability has the form of an integral over the Grassmannian of p-planes in\ncomplex C^n. The present paper shows that the asymptotics of this probability,\nwhen N tends to infinity, is related to the kth moment of the\nchi^2-distribution of parameter 2p^2. This is related to the behavior of the\nintegral over the Grassmannian Gr(p,C^n) of p-planes in C^n, when the dimension\nof the ambient space C^n becomes very large. A different scaling limit for the\nPoissonized probability is related to a new matrix integral, itself a solution\nof the Painlev\\'e IV equation. This is part of a more general set-up related to\nthe Painlev\\'e V equation.\n", "  The colored Jones function of a knot is a sequence of Laurent polynomials\nthat encodes the Jones polynomial of a knot and its parallels. It has been\nunderstood in terms of representations of quantum groups and Witten gave an\nintrinsic quantum field theory interpretation of the colored Jones function as\nthe expectation value of Wilson loops of a 3-dimensional gauge theory, the\nChern-Simons theory. We present the colored Jones function as an evaluation of\nthe inverse of a non-commutative fermionic partition function. This result is\nin the form familiar in quantum field theory, namely the inverse of a\ngeneralized determinant.\n  Our formula also reveals a direct relation between the Alexander polynomial\nand the colored Jones function of a knot and immediately implies the\nextensively studied Melvin-Morton-Rozansky conjecture, first proved by\nBar-Natan and the first author about ten years ago.\n", "  We compute the ring structure of Floer cohomology groups of Lagrangian torus\nfibers in some toric Fano manifolds continuing the study of \\cite{CO}. Related\n$\\AI$-formulas hold for transversal choice of chains. Two different\ncomputations are provided: a direct calculation using the classification of\nholomorphic discs by Oh and the author in \\cite{CO}, and another method by\nusing an {\\it analogue of divisor equation} in Gromov-Witten invariants to\nthecase of discs.\n  Floer cohomology rings are shown to be isomorphic to Clifford algebras, whose\nquadratic forms are given by the Hessians of functions $W$, which turn out to\nbe the superpotentials of Landau-Ginzburg mirrors. In the case of $\\CP^n$ and $\n\\CP^1 \\times \\CP^1$, this proves the prediction made by Hori, Kapustin and Li\nby B-model calculations via physical arguments. The latter method also provides\ncorrespondence between higher derivatives of the superpotential of LG mirror\nwith the higher products of $\\AI$(or $\\LI$)-algebra of the Lagrangian\nsubmanifold.\n", "  In this paper we are begining to explore the complex counterpart of the\nChern-Simon-Witten theory. We define the complex analogue of the Gauss linking\nnumber for complex curves embedded in a Calabi-Yau threefold using the formal\npath integral that leads to a rigorous mathematical expression. We give an\nanalytic and geometric interpretation of our holomorphic linking following the\nparallel with the real case. We show in particular that the Green kernel that\nappears in the explicit integral for the Gauss linking number is replaced by\nthe Bochner-Martinelli kernel. We also find canonical expressions of the\nholomorphic linking using the Grothendieck-Serre duality in local cohomology,\nthe latter admits a generalization for an arbitrary field.\n", "  This is the second in a series math.AG/0312190, math.AG/0410267,\nmath.AG/0410268 on configurations in an abelian category A. Given a finite\npartially ordered set (I,<), an (I,<)-configuration (\\sigma,\\iota,\\pi) is a\nfinite collection of objects \\sigma(J) and morphisms \\iota(J,K) or \\pi(J,K) :\n\\sigma(J) --> \\sigma(K) in A satisfying some axioms, where J,K are subsets of\nI. Configurations describe how an object X in A decomposes into subobjects.\n  The first paper math.AG/0312190 defined configurations and studied moduli\nspaces of (I,<)-configurations in A, using the theory of Artin stacks. It\nproved well-behaved moduli stacks Obj_A, M(I,<)_A of objects and configurations\nin A exist when A is the abelian category coh(P) of coherent sheaves on a\nprojective K-scheme P, or mod-KQ of representations of a quiver Q.\n  Write CF(Obj_A) for the vector space of constructible functions on Obj_A.\nMotivated by Ringel-Hall algebras, we define an associative multiplication * on\nCF(Obj_A) using pushforwords and pullbacks along 1-morphisms between the\nM(I,<)_A, making CF(Obj_A) into an algebra. We also study representations of\nCF(Obj_A), the Lie subalgebra CF^ind(Obj_A) of functions supported on\nindecomposables, and other algebraic structures on CF(Obj_A).\n  Then we generalize these ideas to stack functions SF(Obj_A), a universal\ngeneralization of constructible functions on stacks introduced in\nmath.AG/0509722, containing more information. Under extra conditions on A we\ncan define (Lie) algebra morphisms from SF(Obj_A) to some explicit (Lie)\nalgebras, which will be important in the sequels on invariants counting\nt-(semi)stable objects in A.\n", "  We consider the Ising model on a general tree under various boundary\nconditions: all plus, free and spin-glass. In each case, we determine when the\nroot is influenced by the boundary values in the limit as the boundary recedes\nto infinity. We obtain exact capacity criteria that govern behavior at critical\ntemperatures. For plus boundary conditions, an $L^3$ capacity arises. In\nparticular, on a spherically symmetric tree that has $n^{\\alpha}b^n$ vertices\nat level $n$ (up to bounded factors), we prove that there is a unique Gibbs\nmeasure for the ferromagnetic Ising model at the relevant critical temperature\nif and only if $\\alpha\\le1/2$. Our proofs are based on a new link between\nnonlinear recursions on trees and $L^p$ capacities.\n", "  We consider a semilinear elliptic system which include the model system of\nthe $W-$strings in the cosmology as a special case. We prove existence of\nmulti-string solutions and obtain precise asymptotic decay estimates near\ninfinity for the solutions.\n  As a special case of this result we solve an open problem posed in\n  \\cite{yan}\n", "  This paper studies the pressureless Euler-Poisson system and its fully\nnon-linear counterpart, the Euler-Monge-Amp\\`ere system, where the fully\nnon-linear Monge-Amp\\`ere equation substitutes for the linear Poisson equation.\nWhile the first is a model of plasma physics, the second is derived as a\ngeometric approximation to the Euler incompressible equations. Using energy\nestimates, convergence of both systems to the Euler incompressible equations is\nproved.\n", "  Proofs of Tsygan's formality conjectures for chains would unlock important\nalgebraic tools which might lead to new generalizations of the\nAtiyah-Patodi-Singer index theorem and the Riemann-Roch-Hirzebruch theorem.\nDespite this pivotal role in the traditional investigations and the efforts of\nvarious people the most general version of Tsygan's formality conjecture has\nnot yet been proven. In my thesis I propose Fedosov resolutions for the\nHochschild cohomological and homological complexes of the algebra of functions\non an arbitrary smooth manifold. Using these resolutions together with\nKontsevich's formality quasi-isomorphism for Hochschild cochains of R[[y_1,\n>..., y_d]] and Shoikhet's formality quasi-isomorphism for Hochschild chains of\nR[[y_1,..., y_d]] I prove Tsygan's formality conjecture for Hochschild chains\nof the algebra of functions on an arbitrary smooth manifold. The construction\nof the formality quasi-isomorphism for Hochschild chains is manifestly\nfunctorial for isomorphisms of the pairs (M,\\nabla), where M is the manifold\nand \\nabla is an affine connection on the tangent bundle. In my thesis I apply\nthese results to equivariant quantization, computation of Hochschild homology\nof quantum algebras and description of traces in deformation quantization.\n", "  We use F. Ferrari's methods relating matrix models to Calabi-Yau spaces in\norder to explain Intriligator and Wecht's ADE classification of $\\N=1$\nsuperconformal theories which arise as RG fixed points of $\\N = 1$ SQCD\ntheories with adjoints. The connection between matrix models and $\\N = 1$ gauge\ntheories can be seen as evidence for the Dijkgraaf--Vafa conjecture. We find\nthat ADE superpotentials in the Intriligator--Wecht classification exactly\nmatch matrix model superpotentials obtained from Calabi-Yau's with\ncorresponding ADE singularities. Moreover, in the additional $\\Hat{O}, \\Hat{A},\n\\Hat{D}$ and $\\Hat{E}$ cases we find new singular geometries. These `hat'\ngeometries are closely related to their ADE counterparts, but feature\nnon-isolated singularities. As a byproduct, we give simple descriptions for\nsmall resolutions of Gorenstein threefold singularities in terms of transition\nfunctions between just two coordinate charts. To obtain these results we\ndevelop techniques for performing small resolutions and small blow-downs,\nincluding an algorithm for blowing down exceptional $\\PP^1$'s. In particular,\nwe conjecture that small resolutions for isolated Gorenstein threefold\nsingularities can be obtained by deforming matrix factorizations for simple\nsurface singularities -- and prove this in the length 1 and length 2 cases.\n", "  We investigate the integrability of the discrete non-linear equation\ngoverning the dependence on geodesic distance of planar graphs with inner\nvertices of even valences. This equation follows from a bijection between\ngraphs and blossom trees and is expressed in terms of generating functions for\nrandom walks. We construct explicitly an infinite set of conserved quantities\nfor this equation, also involving suitable combinations of random walk\ngenerating functions. The proof of their conservation, i.e. their eventual\nindependence on the geodesic distance, relies on the connection between random\nwalks and heaps of dimers. The values of the conserved quantities are\nidentified with generating functions for graphs with fixed numbers of external\nlegs. Alternative equivalent choices for the set of conserved quantities are\nalso discussed and some applications are presented.\n", "  We consider the Schr\\\"odinger operator on the real line with a $N\\ts N$\nmatrix valued periodic potential, N>1. The spectrum of this operator is\nabsolutely continuous and consists of intervals separated by gaps. We define\nthe Lyapunov function, which is analytic on an associated N-sheeted Riemann\nsurface. On each sheet the Lyapunov function has the standard properties of the\nLyapunov function for the scalar case. The Lyapunov function has (real or\ncomplex) branch points, which we call resonances. We determine the asymptotics\nof the periodic, anti-periodic spectrum and of the resonances at high energy\n(in terms of the Fourier coefficients of the potential). We show that there\nexist two types of gaps: i) stable gaps, i.e., the endpoints are periodic and\nanti-periodic eigenvalues, ii) unstable (resonance) gaps, i.e., the endpoints\nare resonances (real branch points). Moreover, the following results are\nobtained: 1) we define the quasimomentum as an analytic function on the Riemann\nsurface of the Lyapunov function; various properties and estimates of the\nquasimomentum are obtained, 2) we construct the conformal mapping with real\npart given by the integrated density of states and imaginary part given by the\n  Lyapunov exponent. We obtain various properties of this conformal mapping,\nwhich are similar to the case N=1, 3) we determine various new trace formulae\nfor potentials, the integrated density of states and the\n  Lyapunov exponent, 4) a priori estimates of gap lengths in terms of\npotentials are obtained.\n", "  We explore Ito stochastic differential equations where the drift term\npossibly depends on the infinite past. Assuming the existence of a Lyapunov\nfunction, we prove the existence of a stationary solution assuming only minimal\ncontinuity of the coefficients. Uniqueness of the stationary solution is proven\nif the dependence on the past decays sufficiently fast. The results of this\npaper are then applied to stochastically forced dissipative partial\ndifferential equations such as the stochastic Navier-Stokes equation and\nstochastic Ginsburg-Landau equation.\n", "  Based on the work of Borcherds we construct on the moduli space of K3\nsurfaces with B-field an automorphic form exp_{4,20} which vanishes on the\ntotally geodesic subspaces orthogonal to -2 vectors of the even, unimodular\nlattice of signature (4,20). We give an explicit formula of the regularized\ndeterminants of the Laplacians of Calabi Yau metrics on K3 Surfaces, following\nsuggestions by R. Borcherds. The holomorphic part of the regularized\ndeterminants will be the higher dimensional analogue of Dedekind Eta function.\nWe give explicit formulas for the number of non singular rational curves with a\nfixed volume with respect to a Hodge metric in the case of K3 surfaces with\nPicard group unimodular even lattice. The counting of rational curves on\nspecial K3 surfaces using the regularized determinants of the Laplacian of CY\nmetrics is related to some results of Bershadsky, Cecotti, Ouguri and Vafa.\n", "  Main ideas of the differential geometry on affine bundles are presented.\nAffine counterparts of Lie algebroid and Poisson structures are introduced and\ndiscussed. The developed concepts are applied in a frame-independent\nformulation of the time-dependent and the Newtonian mechanics.\n", "  We give a presentation of the universal central extension of the three-point\nloop algebra L over sl_2 by generators and relations. Our presentation arises\nfrom the realization of L as the tetrahedron Lie algebra and leads to\nconnections between the universal central extension and the Onsager\n  Lie algebra. Symmetry under the alternating group\n  A_4 features prominently in this work.\n", "  Some properties of the $q$-Fourier-sine transform are studied and\n  $q$-analogues of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle is derived for the\n$q$-Fourier-cosine transform studied in \\cite{FB} and for the $q$-Fourier-sine\ntransform.\n", "  We provide local expressions for Chern-Weil type forms built from\nsuperconnections associated with families of Dirac operators previously\ninvestigated in work by S. Scott and later work by S. Scott and the second\nauthor. When the underlying fibration of manifolds is trivial, the even degree\nforms can be interpreted as renormalised Chern-Weil forms in as far as they\ncoincide with regularised Chern-Weil forms up to residue correction terms.\nSimilarly, a new formula for the curvature of the local fermionic vacuum line\nbundles is derived using a residue correction term added to the naive curvature\nformula.\n  We interpret the odd degree Chern-Weil type forms built from superconnections\nas Wodzicki residues and establish a transgression formula along the lines of\nknown transgression formulae for eta-forms.\n", "  The space $\\Gamma_X$ of all locally finite configurations in a\n  Riemannian manifold $X$ of infinite volume is considered. The deRham complex\nof square-integrable differential forms over $\\Gamma_X$, equipped with the\nPoisson measure, and the corresponding deRham cohomology are studied. The\nlatter is shown to be unitarily isomorphic to a certain Hilbert tensor algebra\ngenerated by the $L^2$-cohomology of the underlying manifold $X$.\n", "  In this paper the well-known Dubrovin-Novikov problem posed as long ago as\n1984 in connection with the Hamiltonian theory of systems of hydrodynamic type,\nnamely, the classification problem for multidimensional Poisson brackets of\nhydrodynamic type, is solved. In contrast to the one-dimensional case, in the\ngeneral case, a nondegenerate multidimensional Poisson bracket of hydrodynamic\ntype cannot be reduced to a constant form by a local change of coordinates.\nGenerally speaking, such a Poisson bracket is generated by a nontrivial special\ninfinite-dimensional Lie algebra. In this paper we obtain a classification of\nall nonsingular nondegenerate multidimensional Poisson brackets of hydrodynamic\ntype for any number N of components and for any dimension n by\ndifferential-geometric methods. A key role in the solution of this problem was\nplayed by the theory of compatible metrics that had been earlier constructed by\nthe present author.\n", "  We consider a cylindrical film of fluid adhering to a rigid cylinder of fixed\nradius. The main result is to give the critical (maximum) length for which such\na film of given thickness can be stable. The problem is considered both when\nthe cylinder remains stationary and when the fluid and the cylinder are\nco-rotating at a fixed angular velocity.\n", "  The physical principles and the mathematical structure involved in deriving\nan analytical representation of the internal structure of the sun are\ndiscussed. For a two-parameter family of a non-linear matter density\ndistribution, the run of mass, pressure, temperature, and luminosity throughout\nthe sun are expressed in terms of Gauss' hypergeometric function. The system of\ndifferential equations governing hydrostatic equilibrium and energy\nconservation for the sun generates another field of application of special\nfunctions.\n", "  The absolutely continuous spectrum of one-dimensional Schr\\\"odinger operators\nis proved to be stable under perturbation by potentials satisfying mild decay\nconditions. In particular, the absolutely continuous spectrum of free and\nperiodic Schr\\\"odinger operators is preserved under all perturbations $V(x)$\nsatisfying $|V(x)|\\leq C(1+x)^{-\\alpha}$, $\\alpha >\\frac{1}{2}.$ This result is\noptimal in the power scale. More general classes of perturbing potentials which\nare not necessarily power decaying are also treated. A general criterion for\nstability of the absolutely continuous spectrum of one-dimensional\nSchr\\\"odinger operators is established. In all cases analyzed, the main term of\nthe asymptotic behavior of the generalized eigenfunctions is shown to have WKB\nform for almost all energies. The proofs rely on new maximal function and norm\nestimates and almost everywhere convergence results for certain multilinear\nintegral operators.\n", "  We present here a possible generalisation of the Poincar\\'e-Cartan form in\nclassical field theory in the most general case: arbitrary dimension, arbitrary\norder of the theory and in the absence of a fibre bundle structure. We use for\nthe kinematical description of the system the $(r,n)$-Grassmann manifold\nassociated to a given manifold $X$, i.e. the manifold of $r$-contact elements\nof $n$-dimensional submanifolds of $X$. The idea is to define globally a $n+1$\nform on this Grassmann manifold, more precisely its class with respect to a\ncertain subspace and to write it locally as the exterior derivative of a $n$\nform which is the Poincar\\'e-Cartan form. As an important application we obtain\na new proof for the most general expression of a variationally trivial\nLagrangian.\n", "  For the class of systems of PDEs, for which infinitesimal translations (with\nrespect to some (in)dependent variables) possess specific finite-dimensional\ninvariant subspaces of the space of generalized symmetries of the system\nconsidered. We establish when there exist generalized symmetries from these\nsubspaces, which depend from the above-mentioned variables.\n", "  Using non-Archimedian integration over spaces of arcs of algebraic varieties,\nwe define stringy Euler numbers associated with arbitrary Kawamata log terminal\npairs. There is a natural Kawamata log terminal pair corresponding to an\nalgebraic variety V having a regular action of a finite group G. In this\nsituation we show that the stringy Euler number of this pair coincides with the\nphysicists' orbifold Euler number defined by the Dixon-Harvey-Vafa-Witten\nformula. As an application, we prove a conjecture of Miles Reid on the Euler\nnumbers of crepant desingularizations of Gorenstein quotient singularities.\n", "  It is shown that the family of deformed algebras ${\\cal\nU}_\\lambda(iso_{\\omega_2... \\omega_N}(N))$ has a different bicrossproduct\nstructure for each $\\omega_a=0$ in analogy to the undeformed case.\n", "  We present an upper bound on the mixing rate of the equilibrium state of a\ndynamical systems defined by the one-sided shift and a non H\\\"{o}lder potential\nof summable variations. The bound follows from an estimation of the relaxation\nspeed of chains with complete connections with summable decay, which is\nobtained via a explicit coupling between pairs of chains with different\nhistories.\n", "  For phase-space manifolds which are compact Kaehler manifolds relations\nbetween the Berezin-Toeplitz quantization and the quantization with the help of\nBerezin's coherent states and symbols are studied. First the results on the\nBerezin-Toeplitz quantization of arbitrary compact Kaehler manifolds due to\nBordemann, Meinrenken and Schlichenmaier are recalled. It is shown that the\ncovariant symbol map is adjoint to the Toeplitz map. The Berezin transform for\ncompact Kaehler manifolds is discussed. (Talk presented at the XVII workshop on\ngeometric methods in physics, Bialowieza, Poland, July 3 --July 9, 1998)\n", "  We give a geometric approach to proving know regularity and existence\ntheorems for the 2D Navier-Stokes Equations. We feel this point of view is\ninstructive in better understanding the dynamics. The technique is inspired by\nconstructions in the Dynamical Systems.\n", "  The aim of this paper is to present a generalization of Lunn-Senior's\nmathematical model of isomerism in organic chemistry. The main idea of Lunn and\nSenior is that if the type of isomerism is fixed, a molecule with a fixed\nskeleton and d univalent substituents has a symmetry group $W\\leq S_d$ which is\ngenerally not the molecule's 3-dimensional symmetry group. The unit character\nof W induces a representation of the symmetric group $S_d$ which governs the\ncombinatorics of the isomers of the given molecule. Lunn-Senior's thesis is\nthat certain non-negative integers established by this representation are upper\nboundaries of the corresponding numbers, yielded by the experiment (and often\ncoincide with them). Moreover, the authors define (in a particular case) a\npartial order among the objects of the model, such that some simple\nsubstitution reactions correspond to inequalities. These two groups of data\ndetermine the group W, and produce so called \"type properties\" of the molecule\n(properties which do not depend on the nature of the univalent substituents).\nOur hypothesis is that if we replace the unit character of $W$ by any\none-dimensional character of $W$ (thus we count only a part of the isomers -\nthose having a maximum property), we also get a type property of the molecule.\nAn instance of that is the inventory of the stereoisomers called chiral pairs.\nThe formalism can be generalized naturally and produces some preliminary\nchemical results. Especially the partial order is defined and studied in the\ngeneral case and indicates the possible genetic relations among the\ncorresponding molecules. An important result of E. Ruch which connects the\ndominance order among partitions and the existence of chiral pairs is obtained\nas a consequence of a more general statement.\n", "  We introduce a mean-field model of lattice trees based on embeddings into\n$\\Z^d$ of abstract trees having a critical Poisson offspring distribution. This\nmodel provides a combinatorial interpretation for the self-consistent\nmean-field model introduced previously by Derbez and Slade, and provides an\nalternate approach to work of Aldous. The scaling limit of the mean-field model\nis integrated super-Brownian excursion (ISE), in all dimensions. We also\nintroduce a model of weakly self-avoiding lattice trees, in which an embedded\ntree receives a penalty $e^{-\\beta}$ for each self-intersection. The weakly\nself-avoiding lattice trees provide a natural interpolation between the\nmean-field model ($\\beta=0$), and the usual model of strictly self-avoiding\nlattice trees ($\\beta=\\infty$) which associates the uniform measure to the set\nof lattice trees of the same size.\n", "  This is a (long) survey about applications of percolation theory in\nequilibrium statistical mechanics. The chapters are as follows:\n  1. Introduction\n  2. Equilibrium phases\n  3. Some models\n  4. Coupling and stochastic domination\n  5. Percolation\n  6. Random-cluster representations\n  7.

Continuum models\n", "  We extend Sklyanin's method of separation of variables to quantum integrable\nmodels associated to elliptic curves. After reviewing the differential case,\nthe elliptic Gaudin model studied by Enriquez, Feigin and Rubtsov, we consider\nthe difference case and find a class of transfer matrices whose eigenvalue\nproblem can be solved by separation of variables. These transfer matrices are\nassociated to representations of the elliptic quantum group\n$E_{\\tau,\\eta}(sl_2)$ by difference operators. One model of statistical\nmechanics to which this method applies is the IRF model with antiperiodic\nboundary conditions. The eigenvalues of the transfer matrix are given as\nsolutions of a system of quadratic equations in a space of higher order theta\nfunctions.\n", "  We introduce a general notion of quantum universal enveloping algebroids (QUE\nalgebroids), or quantum groupoids, as a unification of quantum groups and\nstar-products. Some basic properties are studied including the twist\nconstruction and the classical limits. In particular, we show that a quantum\ngroupoid naturally gives rise to a Lie bialgebroid as a classical limit.\n  Conversely, we formulate a conjecture on the existence of a quantization for\nany Lie bialgebroid, and prove this conjecture for the special case of regular\ntriangular Lie bialgebroids. As an application of this theory, we study the\ndynamical quantum groupoid ${\\cal D}\\otimes_{\\hbar} U_{\\hbar}(\\frakg)$, which\ngives an interpretation of the quantum dynamical Yang-Baxter equation in terms\nof Hopf algebroids.\n", "  We prove the Taylor-Kubo formula for a class of isotropic, non-mixing flows\nwith long-range correlation.\n  For the proof, we develop the method of high order correctors expansion.\n", "  The exceptional holonomy groups are G2 in 7 dimensions, and Spin(7) in 8\ndimensions. In a previous paper (Invent. math. 123 (1996), 507-552) the author\nconstructed the first examples of compact 8-manifolds with holonomy Spin(7), by\nresolving orbifolds T^8/G, where T^8 is the 8-torus and G a finite group of\nautomorphisms of T^8.\n  This paper describes a different construction of compact 8-manifolds with\nholonomy Spin(7). We start with a Calabi-Yau 4-orbifold Y with isolated\nsingularities, and an isometric, antiholomorphic involution \\sigma of Y fixing\nonly the singular points. Let Z=Y/<\\sigma>. Then Z is an orbifold with isolated\nsingularities, and a natural Spin(7)-structure. We resolve the singular points\nof Z to get a compact 8-manifold M, and show that M has holonomy Spin(7).\n  Taking Y to be a hypersurface in a complex weighted projective space, we\nconstruct new examples of compact 8-manifolds with holonomy Spin(7), and\ncalculate their Betti numbers b^k. The fourth Betti number b^4 tends to be\nrather large, as high as 11,662 in one example.\n", "  Bosonized q-vertex operators related to the 4-dimensional evaluation modules\nof the quantum affine superalgebra $U_q[\\hat{sl(2|1)}]$ are constructed for\narbitrary level $k=\\alpha$, where $\\alpha\\neq 0, -1$ is a complex parameter\nappearing in the 4-dimensional evaluation representations. They are\nintertwiners among the level-$\\alpha$ highest weight Fock-Wakimoto modules.\nScreen currents which commute with the action of $U_q[\\hat{sl(2|1)}]$ up to\ntotal differences are presented. Integral formulae for N-point functions of\ntype I and type II q-vertex operators are proposed.\n", "  We suggest a construction that, given a trajectorial diffeomorphism between\ntwo Hamiltonian systems, produces integrals of them.\n  As the main example we treat geodesic equivalence of metrics.\n  We show that the existence of a non-trivially geodesically equivalent metric\nleads to Liouville integrability, and present explicit formulae for integrals.\n", "  We prove that for Diophantine \\om and almost every \\th, the almost Mathieu\noperator, (H_{\\omega,\\lambda,\\theta}\\Psi)(n)=\\Psi(n+1) + \\Psi(n-1) +\n\\lambda\\cos 2\\pi(\\omega n +\\theta)\\Psi(n), exhibits localization for \\lambda >\n2 and purely absolutely continuous spectrum for \\lambda < 2. This completes the\nproof of (a correct version of) the Aubry-Andr\\'e conjecture.\n", "  A new order-N method for calculating the electronic structure of general\n(non-tight-binding) potentials is presented. The method uses a combination of\nthe ``purification''-based approaches used by Li, Nunes and Vanderbilt, and\nDaw, and a representation of the density matrix based on ``travelling basis\norbitals''. The method is applied to several one-dimensional examples,\nincluding the free electron gas, the ``Morse'' bound-state potential, a\ndiscontinuous potential that mimics an interface, and an oscillatory potential\nthat mimics a semiconductor. The method is found to contain Friedel\noscillations, quantization of charge in bound states, and band gap formation.\nQuantitatively accurate agreement with exact results is found in most cases.\nPossible advantages with regard to treating electron-electron interactions and\narbitrary boundary conditions are discussed.\n", "  An energy functional for orbital based $O(N)$ calculations is proposed, which\ndepends on a number of non orthogonal, localized orbitals larger than the\nnumber of occupied states in the system, and on a parameter, the electronic\nchemical potential, determining the number of electrons. We show that the\nminimization of the functional with respect to overlapping localized orbitals\ncan be performed so as to attain directly the ground state energy, without\nbeing trapped at local minima. The present approach overcomes the multiple\nminima problem present within the original formulation of orbital based $O(N)$\nmethods; it therefore makes it possible to perform $O(N)$ calculations for an\narbitrary system, without including any information about the system bonding\nproperties in the construction of the input wavefunctions. Furthermore, while\nretaining the same computational cost as the original approach, our formulation\nallows one to improve the variational estimate of the ground state energy, and\nthe energy conservation during a molecular dynamics run. Several numerical\nexamples for surfaces, bulk systems and clusters are presented and discussed.\n", "  A complete mapping in the Brillouin zone of the structural instability\nassociated with the ferroelectric phase transitions of KNbO$_3$ has been\nobtained by first-principles calculations using an LAPW linear response\napproach. The wavevector dependence of the instability reveals pronounced\ntwo-dimensional character, which corresponds to chains oriented along\n$\\left<100\\right>$\\ directions of displaced Nb atoms. The results are discussed\nin relation to models of the ferroelectric phase transitions.\n", "  We examine two aspects of Stockmayer fluids which consists of point dipoles\nthat additionally interact via an attractive Lennard-Jones potential. We\nperform Monte Carlo simulations to examine the effect of an applied field on\nthe liquid-gas phase coexistence and show that a magnetic fluid phase does\nexist in the absence of an applied field. As part of the search for the\nmagnetic fluid phase, we perform Gibbs ensemble simulations to determine phase\ncoexistence curves at large dipole moments, $\\mu$. The critical temperature is\nfound to depend linearly on $\\mu^2$ for intermediate values of $\\mu$ beyond the\ninitial nonlinear behavior near $\\mu=0$ and less than the $\\mu$ where no\nliquid-gas phase coexistence has been found. For phase coexistence in an\napplied field, the critical temperatures as a function of the applied field for\ntwo different $\\mu$ are mapped onto a single curve. The critical densities\nhardly change as a function of applied field. We also verify that in an applied\nfield the liquid droplets within the two phase coexistence region become\nelongated in the direction of the field.\n", "  Electron-hole excitations in the surface bands of GaAs(110) are analyzed\nusing constrained density-functional theory calculations. The results show that\nFrenkel-type autolocalized excitons are formed. The excitons induce a local\nsurface unrelaxation which results in a strong exciton-exciton attraction and\nmakes complexes of two or three electron-hole pairs more favorable than\nseparate excitons. In such microscopic exciton &quot;droplets&quot; the\nelectron density is mainly concentrated in the dangling orbital of a surface Ga\natom whereas the holes are distributed over the bonds of this atom to its As\nneighbors thus weakening the bonding to the substrate. This finding suggests\nthe microscopic mechanism of a laser-induced emission of neutral Ga atoms from\nGaAs and GaP (110) surfaces.\n", "  Results of recent density functional theory calculations for alkali metal\nadsorbates on close-packed metal surfaces are discussed. Single adatoms on the\n(111) surface of Al and Cu are studied with the self-consistent surface\nGreen-function method by which the pure adsorbate-substrate interaction may be\nanalyzed. Higher coverage ordered adlayers of K on Al(111), Na on Al(111), and\nNa on Al(001) are treated using the <em>ab-initio</em> pseudopotential plane\nwave method which affords the prediction of coverage dependent stable and\nmetastable adsorbate geometries and phase transitions of the adsorbate layers.\nTogether, these studies give insight and understanding into current key issues\nin alkali metal adsorption, namely, the nature of the adsorbate-substrate bond\nat low coverage and the occurrence of hitherto unanticipated adsorbate\ngeometries, and the associated electronic properties.\n", "  We use realistic pseudopotentials and a plane-wave basis to study the\nelectronic structure of non-periodic, three-dimensional, 2000-atom\n(AlAs)_n/(GaAs)_m (001) superlattices, where the individual layer thicknesses\nn,m = {1,2,3} are randomly selected. We find that while the band gap of the\nequivalent (n = m = 2) ordered superlattice is indirect, random fluctuations in\nlayer thicknesses lead to a direct gap in the planar Brillouin zone, strong\nwavefunction localization along the growth direction, short radiative\nlifetimes, and a significant band-gap reduction, in agreement with experiments\non such intentionally grown disordered superlattices.\n", "  An algorithm for first-principles electronic structure calculations having a\ncomputational cost which scales linearly with the system size is presented. Our\nmethod exploits the real-space localization of the density matrix, and in this\nrespect it is related to the technique of Li, Nunes and Vanderbilt. The density\nmatrix is expressed in terms of localized support functions, and a matrix of\nvariational parameters, L, having a finite spatial range. The total energy is\nminimized with respect to both the support functions and the elements of the L\nmatrix. The method is variational, and becomes exact as the ranges of the\nsupport functions and the L matrix are increased. We have tested the method on\ncrystalline silicon systems containing up to 216 atoms, and we discuss some of\nthese results.\n", "  The response of an infinite, periodic, insulating, solid to an\ninfinitesimally small electric field is investigated in the framework of\nDensity Functional Theory. We find that the applied perturbing potential is not\na unique functional of the periodic density change~: it depends also on the\nchange in the macroscopic {\\em polarization}. Moreover, the dependence of the\nexchange-correlation energy on polarization induces an exchange-correlation\nelectric field. These effects are exhibited for a model semiconductor. We also\nshow that the scissor-operator technique is an approximate way of bypassing\nthis polarization dependence.\n", "  We present a first-principles study of excitonic self-trapping in diamond.\nOur calculation provides evidence for self-trapping of the 1s core exciton and\ngives a coherent interpretation of recent experimental X-ray absorption and\nemission data. Self-trapping does not occur in the case of a single valence\nexciton. We predict, however, that self-trapping should occur in the case of a\nvalence biexciton. This process is accompanied by a large local relaxation of\nthe lattice which could be observed experimentally.\n", "  The large interest in the properties of transition metal surfaces has been\nrecently fostered by inelastic helium atom scattering experiments carried out\nby Hulpke and Luedecke. Sharp and giant anomalies in the surface phonon\ndispersion curves along Gamma-H and Gamma-S have been detected on W(110) and\nMo(110) at a coverage of one monolayer of hydrogen. At the same critical wave\nvectors a smaller second indentation is present in the experimental phonon\nbranches. Recently we have proposed a possible interpretation which is able to\nexplain this and other experiments. In this paper we discuss results of our\nrecent ab initio calculations of the atomic and electronic properties of the\nclean and H-covered Mo(110) surface in more details. For the full monolayer\ncoverage the calculated Fermi-surface contours are characterized by strong\nnesting features which originate the observed anomalies.\n", "  We carry out a completely first-principles study of the ferroelectric phase\ntransitions in BaTiO$_3$. Our approach takes advantage of two features of these\ntransitions: the structural changes are small, and only low-energy distortions\nare important. Based on these observations, we make systematically improvable\napproximations which enable the parameterization of the complicated energy\nsurface. The parameters are determined from first-principles total-energy\ncalculations using ultra-soft pseudopotentials and a preconditioned\nconjugate-gradient scheme. The resulting effective Hamiltonian is then solved\nby Monte Carlo simulation. The calculated phase sequence, transition\ntemperatures, latent heats, and spontaneous polarizations are all in good\nagreement with experiment. We find the transitions to be intermediate between\norder-disorder and displacive character. We find all three phase transitions to\nbe of first order. The roles of different interactions are discussed.\n", "  Recent experiments in metallic solid solutions have revealed interesting\ncorrelations between static pair-displacements and the ordering behavior of\nthese alloys. This paper discusses a simple theoretical model which\nsuccessfully explains these observations and which provides a natural framework\nfor analyzing experimental measurements of pair-displacements and chemical\ncorrelations in solid solutions. The utility and scope of this model is\ndemonstrated by analyzing results of experiments on $Ni-Fe$ and $Cr-Fe$ alloys\nand results of simulations of $Cu-Au$ and $Cu-Ag$ alloys.\n", "  First-principles molecular dynamics simulations having a duration of 8 ps\nhave been used to study the static, dynamic and electronic properties of l-Ga\nat the temperatures 702 K and 982 K. The simulations use the density-functional\npseudopotential method and the system is maintained on the Born-Oppenheimer\nsurface by conjugate gradients relaxation. The static structure factor and\nradial distribution function of the simulated system agree very closely with\nexperimental data, but the diffusion coefficient is noticeably lower than\nmeasured values. The long simulations allow us to calculate the dynamical\nstructure factor $S(q,\\omega)$. A sound-wave peak is clearly visible in\n$S(q,\\omega)$ at small wavevectors, and we present results for the dispersion\ncurve and hence the sound velocity, which is close to the experimental value.\nThe electronic density of states is very close to the free-electron form.\nValues of the electrical conductivity calculated from Kubo-Greenwood formula\nare in satisfactory accord with measured data.\n", "  Density-functional simulations are used to calculate structural properties\nand high-symmetry phonons of the hypothetical cubic phase, the stable\northorhombic phase and an intermediate tetragonal phase of magnesium silicate\nperovskite. We show that the structure of the stable phase is well described by\nfreezing in a small number of unstable phonons into the cubic phase. We use the\nfrequencies of these unstable modes to estimate transition temperatures for\ncubic--tetragonal and tetragonal--orthorhombic phase transitions. These are\ninvestigated further to find that the coupling with the strain suggests that\nphonons give a better representation than rigid unit modes. The phonons of an\nintermediate tetragonal phase were found to be stable except for two rotational\nmodes. The eigenvectors of the most unstable mode of each of the cubic and\ntetragonal phases account for all the positional parameters of the orthorhombic\nphase. The phase boundary for the orthorhombic--tetragonal transition\nintersects possible mantle geotherms, suggesting that the tetragonal phase may\nbe present in the lower mantle.\n", "  A new tight-binding total energy method, which has been shown to accurately\npredict ground state properties of transition and noble metals, is applied to\nManganese, the element with the most complex ground state structure among the\n$d$ metals. We show that the tight-binding method correctly predicts the ground\nstate structure of Mn, and offers some insight into the magnetic properties of\nthis state.\n", "  The stability of interfaces and the mechanisms of thin film growth on\nsemiconductors are issues of central importance in electronic devices. These\nissues can only be understood through detailed study of the relevant\nmicroscopic processes. Experimental studies are able to provide detailed,\natomic scale information for model systems. Theoretical analysis of\nexperimental results is essential in explaining certain surprising observations\nand in providing guidance for optimizing conditions and methods of growth. We\nreview recent theoretical work on the diffusion of adatoms, the structure of\nadsorbate monolayers, and their implications for growth on the Si and Ge (111)\nsurfaces. The theoretical analysis consists of first-principles calculations of\nthe total-energy and entropy factors for stable, metastable and saddle-point\nconfigurations. These calculations are supplemented by Monte Carlo simulations\nof simple models that afford direct contact with experimental observations.\n", "  Ab initio molecular dynamics is used to study deformations of sodium clusters\nat temperatures $500\\cdots 1100$ K. Open-shell Na$_{14}$ cluster has two shape\nisomers, prolate and oblate, in the liquid state. The deformation is stabilized\nby opening a gap at the Fermi level. The closed-shell Na$_8$ remains magic also\nat the liquid state.\n", "  Linearized augmented plane wave (LAPW) calculations are performed for\nperiodic (001) and (111) slabs of BaTiO$_3$ to understand the effects of\nsurfaces on ferroelectric BaTiO$_3$. The (111) slab is found to be much less\nstable than the (001) slab. The average surface energies are respectively 3700\nerg/cm$^2$ and 1600 erg/cm$^2$. The depolarization field is sufficiently large\nin the ideal unrelaxated slab to completely inhibit the ferroelectric\ninstability. No mid-gap surface states are evident, but there are surface\nstates in the upper gap in the unrelaxed slab and at the top of the valence\nband. The dangling surface Ti bonds self-heal making the Ti-O surface very\nreactive and an excellent epitaxial substrate. The charge density on atoms only\none unit cell away from the surface are almost identical to the bulk.\n  Keywords: ferroelectric, surface, slab, electronic structure, depolarization,\nBaTiO$_3$, thin film\n", "  The equilibrium shape of strained InAs quantum dots grown epitaxially on a\nGaAs(001) substrate is derived as a function of volume. InAs surface energies\nare calculated within density-functional theory, and a continuum approach is\napplied for the elastic relaxation energies.\n", "  The formation of chemisorbed O-phases on Ru(0001) by exposure to O_2 at low\npressures is apparently limited to coverages Theta <= 0.5. Using low-energy\nelectron diffraction and density functional theory we show that this\nrestriction is caused by kinetic hindering and that a dense O overlayer (Theta\n= 1) can be formed with a (1x1) periodicity. The structural and energetic\nproperties of this new adsorbate phase are analyzed and discussed in view of\nattempts to bridge the so-called \"pressure gap\" in heterogeneous catalysis. It\nis argued that the identified system actuates the unusually high rate of\noxidizing reactions at Ru surfaces under high oxygen pressure conditions.\n", "  The interaction of hydrogen with many transition metal surfaces is\ncharacterized by a coexistence of activated with non-activated paths to\nadsorption with a broad distribution of barrier heights. By performing\nsix-dimensional quantum dynamical and classical molecular dynamics calculations\nusing the same potential energy surface derived from ``ab initio'' calculations\nfor the system H_2/Pd(100) we show that these features of the potential energy\nsurface lead to strong steering effects in the dissociative adsorption\ndynamics. The adsorption dynamics shows only a small isotope effect which is\npurely due to the quantum nature of hydrogen.\n", "  We develop a model to study the thermal expansion of surfaces, wherein phonon\nfrequencies are obtained from ab initio total energy calculations. Anharmonic\neffects are treated exactly in the direction normal to the surface, and within\na quasiharmonic approximation in the plane of the surface. We apply this model\nto the Ag(111) and Al(111) surfaces, and find that our calculations reproduce\nthe experimental observation of a large and anomalous increase in the surface\nthermal expansion of Ag(111) at high temperatures [P. Statiris, H.C. Lu and T.\nGustafsson, Phys. Rev. Lett. 72, 3574 (1994)]. Surprisingly, we find that this\nincrease can be attributed to a rapid softening of the in-plane phonon\nfrequencies, rather than due to the anharmonicity of the out-of-plane surface\nphonon modes. This provides evidence for a new mechanism for the enhancement of\nsurface anharmonicity. A comparison with Al(111) shows that the two surfaces\nbehave quite differently, with no evidence for such anomalous behavior on\nAl(111).\n", "  Stability of cylindrical and spherical crystals growing from a supersaturated\nsolution (in Mullins-Sekerka's approximation) is considered using the maximum\nentropy production principle. The concept of the binodal of the nonequilibrium\n(morphological) phase transition is introduced for interpretation of the\nobtained results. The limits of the metastable regions are determined. The\nmorphological phase diagrams of stable-unstable growth in the plane (surface\nenergy, supersaturation) are given.\n", "  We consider the Allen-Cahn equations with memory (a partial\nintegro-differential convolution equation). The prototype kernels are\nexponentially decreasing functions of time and they reduce the\nintegrodifferential equation to a hyperbolic one, the damped Klein-Gordon\nequation. By means of a formal asymptotic analysis we show that to the leading\norder and under suitable assumptions on the kernels, the integro-differential\nequation behave like a hyperbolic partial differential equation obtained by\nconsidering prototype kernels: the evolution of fronts is governed by the\nextended, damped Born-Infeld equation. We also apply our method to a system of\npartial integro-differential equations which generalize the classical phase\nfield equations with a non-conserved order parameter and describe the process\nof phase transitions where memory effects are present.\n", "  The singularity analysis is carried out for a system of four first-order\nquadratic ODEs with a parameter, which was proposed recently by Golubchik and\nSokolov. A transformation of dependent variables is revealed by the analysis,\nafter which the transformed system possesses the Painlev\\'{e} property and does\nnot contain the parameter.\n", "  We discuss the explicit construction of the Schroedinger equations admitting\na representation through some family of general polynomials. Almost all\nsolvable quantum potentials are shown to be generated by this approach.\n  Some generalization has also been performed in higher-dimensional problems.\n", "  We consider front solutions of the Swift-Hohenberg equation $\\partial_t u=\n-(1+\\partial_x^2)^2 u +\\epsilon ^2 u -u^3$. These are traveling waves which\nleave in their wake a periodic pattern in the laboratory frame. Using\nrenormalization techniques and a decomposition into Bloch waves, we show the\nnon-linear stability of these solutions. It turns out that this problem is\nclosely related to the question of stability of the trivial solution for the\nmodel problem $\\partial_t u(x,t) = \\partial_x^2 u\n(x,t)+(1+\\tanh(x-ct))u(x,t)+u(x,t)^p$ with $p>3$. In particular, we show that\nthe instability of the perturbation ahead of the front is entirely compensated\nby a diffusive stabilization which sets in once the perturbation has hit the\nbulk behind the front.\n", "  The boundary integral method is extended to derive closed\nintegro-differential equations applicable to computation of the shape and\npropagation speed of a steadily moving spot and to the analysis of dynamic\ninstabilities in the sharp boundary limit. Expansion of the boundary integral\nnear the locus of traveling instability in a standard reaction-diffusion model\nproves that the bifurcation is supercritical whenever the spot is stable to\nsplitting, so that propagating spots can be stabilized without introducing\nadditional long-range variables.\n", "  Computer simulations of a compressible fluid, convecting heat in two\ndimensions, suggest that, within a range of Rayleigh numbers, two distinctly\ndifferent, but stable, time-dependent flow morphologies are possible. The\nsimpler of the flows has two characteristic frequencies: the rotation frequency\nof the convecting rolls, and the vertical oscillation frequency of the rolls.\nObservables, such as the heat flux, have a simple-periodic (harmonic) time\ndependence. The more complex flow has at least one additional characteristic\nfrequency -- the horizontal frequency of the cold, downward- and the warm,\nupward-flowing plumes. Observables of this latter flow have a broadband\nfrequency distribution. The two flow morphologies, at the same Rayleigh number,\nhave different rates of entropy production and different Lyapunov exponents.\nThe simpler \"harmonic\" flow transports more heat (produces entropy at a greater\nrate), whereas the more complex \"chaotic\" flow has a larger maximum Lyapunov\nexponent (corresponding to a larger rate of phase-space information loss). A\nlinear combination of these two rates is invariant for the two flow\nmorphologies over the entire range of Rayleigh numbers for which the flows\ncoexist, suggesting a relation between the two rates near the onset of\nconvective turbulence.\n", "  We revisit the globally coupled map lattice (GCML). We show that in the so\ncalled turbulent regime various periodic cluster attractor states are formed\neven though the coupling between the maps are very small relative to the\nnon-linearity in the element maps.\n  Most outstanding is a maximally symmetric three cluster attractor in period\nthree motion (MSCA) due to the foliation of the period three window of the\nelement logistic maps. An analytic approach is proposed which explains\nsuccessfully the systematics of various periodicity manifestations in the\nturbulent regime. The linear stability of the period three cluster attractors\nis investigated.\n", "  It is shown how the complex sine-Gordon equation arises as a symmetry flow of\nthe AKNS hierarchy. The AKNS hierarchy is extended by the ``negative'' symmetry\nflows forming the Borel loop algebra. The complex sine-Gordon and the vector\nNonlinear Schrodinger equations appear as lowest negative and second positive\nflows within the extended hierarchy. This is fully analogous to the well-known\nconnection between the sine-Gordon and mKdV equations within the extended mKdV\nhierarchy.\n  A general formalism for a Toda-like symmetry occupying the ``negative''\nsector of sl(N) constrained KP hierarchy and giving rise to the negative Borel\nsl(N) loop algebra is indicated.\n", "  The dispersion-managed (DM) optical system with step-wise periodical\nvariation of dispersion is studied in the framework of path-averaged\nGabitov-Turitsyn equation. The soliton solution is obtained by iterating the\npath-averaged equation. The dependence of soliton parameters on dispersion map\nstrength is investigated together with the oscillating tails of soliton.\n", "  Classically, a single weight on an interval of the real line leads to\nmoments, orthogonal polynomials and tridiagonal matrices. Appropriately\ndeforming this weight with times t=(t_1,t_2,...), leads to the standard Toda\nlattice and tau-functions, expressed as Hermitian matrix integrals.\n  This paper is concerned with a sequence of t-perturbed weights, rather than\none single weight. This sequence leads to moments, polynomials and a (fuller)\nmatrix evolving according to the discrete KP-hierarchy. The associated\ntau-functions have integral, as well as vertex operator representations.\n  Among the examples considered, we mention: nested Calogero-Moser systems,\nconcatenated solitons and m-periodic sequences of weights. The latter lead to\n2m+1-band matrices and generalized orthogonal polynomials, also arising in the\ncontext of a Riemann-Hilbert problem.\n  We show the Riemann-Hilbert factorization is tantamount to the factorization\nof the moment matrix into the product of a lower- times upper-triangular\nmatrix.\n", "  For relativistic particles with spin 1/2, which are described by the Dirac\nequation, a semiclassical trace formula is introduced that incorporates\nexpectation values of observables in eigenstates of the Dirac-Hamiltonian.\nFurthermore, the semiclassical limit of an average of expectation values is\nexpressed in terms of a classical average of the corresponding classical\nobservable.\n", "  We consider an evolution operator for a discrete Langevin equation with a\nstrongly hyperbolic classical dynamics and Gaussian noise. Using an integral\nrepresentation of the evolution operator we investigate the high order\ncorrections to the trace of arbitary power of the operator.\n  The asymptotic behaviour is found to be controlled by sub-dominant saddle\npoints previously neglected in the perturbative expansion. We show that a trace\nformula can be derived to describe the high order noise corrections.\n", "  In assemblies of globally coupled dynamical units, weak noise perturbing\nindependently the individual units can cause anomalous dispersion in the\nsynchronized cloud of the units in the phase space.\n  When the noise-free dynamics of the synchronized assembly is nonperiodic,\nvarious moments of the linear dimension of the cloud as a function of the noise\nstrength exhibit multiscaling properties with parameter-dependent scaling\nexponents. Some numerical evidence of this peculiar behavior as well as its\ninterpretation in terms of a multiplicative stochastic process with small\nadditive noise is provided.\n  Universality of the phenomenon is also discussed.\n", "  We study limit cycles of nonlinear oscillators described by the equation\n  $\\ddot x + \\nu F(\\dot x) + x =0$. Depending on the nonlinearity this equation\nmay exhibit different number of limit cycles.\n  We show that limit cycles correspond to relative extrema of a certain\nfunctional. Analytical results in the limits $\\nu ->0$ and $\\nu -> \\infty$ are\nin agreement with previously known criteria. For intermediate $\\nu$ numerical\ndetermination of the limit cycles can be obtained.\n", "  We study a class of 1+1 quadratically nonlinear water wave equations that\ncombines the linear dispersion of the Korteweg-deVries (KdV) equation with the\nnonlinear/nonlocal dispersion of the Camassa-Holm (CH) equation, yet still\npreserves integrability via the inverse scattering transform (IST) method.\n  This IST-integrable class of equations contains both the KdV equation and the\nCH equation as limiting cases. It arises as the compatibility condition for a\nsecond order isospectral eigenvalue problem and a first order equation for the\nevolution of its eigenfunctions. This integrable equation is shown to be a\nshallow water wave equation derived by asymptotic expansion at one order higher\napproximation than KdV. We compare its traveling wave solutions to KdV\nsolitons.\n", "  The mechanism of synchronization in the random Zaslavsky map is investigated.\n  From the error dynamics of two particles, the structure of phase space was\nanalyzed, and a transcritical bifurcation between a saddle and a stable fixed\npoint was found. We have verified the structure of on-off intermittency in\nterms of a biased random walk. Furthermore, for the generalized case of the\nensemble of particles, \\emph{a modified definition} of the size of a snapshot\nattractor was exploited to establish the link with a random walk. As a result,\nthe structure of on-off intermittency in the ensemble of particles was\nexplicitly revealed near the transition.\n", "  We study the dynamics of the one-dimensional complex Ginzburg Landau equation\n(CGLE) in the regime where holes and defects organize themselves into composite\nsuperstructures which we call zigzags. Extensive numerical simulations of the\nCGLE reveal a wide range of dynamical zigzag behavior which we summarize in a\n`phase diagram'. We have performed a numerical linear stability and bifurcation\nanalysis of regular zigzag structures which reveals that traveling zigzags\nbifurcate from stationary zigzags via a pitchfork bifurcation. This bifurcation\nchanges from supercritical (forward) to subcritical (backward) as a function of\nthe CGLE coefficients, and we show the relevance of this for the `phase\ndiagram'. Our findings indicate that in the zigzag parameter regime of the\nCGLE, the transition between defect-rich and defect-poor states is governed by\nbifurcations of the zigzag structures.\n"]}
