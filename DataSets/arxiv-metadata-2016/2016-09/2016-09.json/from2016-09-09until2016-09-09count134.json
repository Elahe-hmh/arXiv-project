By use of a reduced\nmodel of dune morphodynamics, dune skeleton model, we elucidate the transition\nmechanism between different shapes of dunes under unidirectional wind. It was\nfound that the decrease in the total amount of sand in the system and/or the\nlateral sand flow shifts the stable state from a straight transverse dune to\nwavy transverse dune through a pitchfork bifurcation. A further decrease causes\nwavy transverse dunes to shift into barchans through a Hopf bifurcation. These\nbifurcation structures reveal the transition mechanism of dune shapes under\nunidirectional wind.\n", "  The dune skeleton model is a reduced model to describe the formation process\nand dynamics of characteristic types of dunes emerging under unidirectional\nsteady wind. Using this model, we study the dependency of the morphodynamics of\ntransverse dunes on the initial random perturbations and the lateral field\nsize. It was found that i) an increase of the lateral field size destabilizes\nthe transverse dune to cause deformation of a barchan, ii) the initial random\nperturbations decay with time by the power function until a certain time;\nthereafter, the dune shapes change into three phases according to the amount of\nsand and sand diffusion coefficient, iii) the duration time, until the\ntransverse dune is broken, increases exponentially with increasing the amount\nof sand and sand diffusion coefficient. Moreover, under the condition without\nthe sand supply from windward ground, the destabilization of transverse dune in\nthis model qualitatively corresponds to the subaqueous dunes in water tank\nexperiments.\n", "  Ultra-cold bosons in zig-zag optical lattices present a rich physics due to\nthe interplay between frustration, induced by lattice geometry, two-body\ninteraction and three-body constraint. Unconstrained bosons may develop chiral\nsuperfluidity and a Mott-insulator even at vanishingly small interactions.\nBosons with a three-body constraint allow for a Haldane-insulator phase in\nnon-polar gases, as well as pair-superfluidity and density wave phases for\nattractive interactions. These phases may be created and detected within the\ncurrent state of the art techniques.\n", "  We study the spatial distribution of clusters associated to the aftershocks\nof the megathrust Maule earthquake MW 8.8 of 27 February 2010. We used a recent\nclustering method which hinges on a nonparametric estimation of the underlying\nprobability density function to detect subsets of points forming clusters\nassociated with high density areas. In addition, we estimate the probability\ndensity function using a nonparametric kernel method for each of these\nclusters. This allows us to identify a set of regions where there is an\nassociation between frequency of events and coseismic slip. Our results suggest\nthat high coseismic slip spatially correlates with high aftershock frequency.\n", "  For inviscid fluid flow in any n-dimensional Riemannian manifold, new\nconserved vorticity integrals generalizing helicity, enstrophy, and entropy\ncirculation are derived for lower-dimensional surfaces that move along fluid\nstreamlines. Conditions are determined for which the integrals yield constants\nof motion for the fluid. In the case when an inviscid fluid is isentropic,\nthese new constants of motion generalize Kelvin's circulation theorem from\nclosed loops to closed surfaces of any dimension.\n", "  We consider thermal conduction across a general nonlinear phononic junction.\nBased on two-time observation protocol and the field theoretical/algebraic\nmethod, the cumulants of the heat transferred in both transient and\nsteady-state regimes are studied on an equal footing, and practical formulae\nfor the calculation of the cumulant generating function of heat transfer are\nobtained. As an application, the developed general formalism is used to study\nanharmonic effects on fluctuation of steady-state heat transfer across a\nsingle-site junction with a quartic nonlinear on-site pinning potential. An\nexplicit nonlinear modification to cumulant generating function exact up to the\nfirst order is given, in which Gallavotti-Cohen fluctuation symmetry is\nverified. Numerically a self-consistent procedure is introduced, which works\nwell for strong nonlinearity.\n", "  Symmetry group methods are applied to obtain all explicit group-invariant\nradial solutions to a class of semilinear Schrodinger equations in dimensions\n$n\\neq 1$. Both focusing and defocusing cases of a power nonlinearity are\nconsidered, including the special case of the conformal power $p=4/n$ relevant\nfor critical dynamics.The methods involve, firstly, reduction of the semilinear\nSchrodinger equations to group-invariant complex 2nd order ODEs with respect to\nan optimal set of one-dimensional point symmetry groups, and secondly, use of\ninherited symmetries, hidden symmetries, and conditional symmetries to solve\neach ODE by quadratures. Through Noether's theorem, all conservation laws\narising from these point symmetry groups are listed.\n", "  Strong existence and pathwise uniqueness of solutions with\n$L^{\\infty}$-vorticity of 2D stochastic Euler equations is proved. The noise is\nmultiplicative and involves first derivatives. A Lagrangian approach is\nimplemented, where a stochastic flow solving a nonlinear flow equation is\nconstructed. Stability under regularization is also proved.\n", "  Removed by arXiv administrators because submission violated the terms of\narXiv's license agreement.\n", "  We show that bosonic spinning strings on the \\eta-deformed AdS_5 x S^5\nbackground are naturally described as periodic solutions of a novel\nfinite-dimensional integrable system which can be viewed as a deformation of\nthe celebrated Neumann model. For this deformed model we find the Lax\nrepresentation and the analogue of the Uhlenbeck integrals.\n", "  Harmonically modulated complex solitary waves which are a generalized type of\nenvelope soliton (herein coined oscillatory solitons) are studied for the two\nU(1)-invariant integrable generalizations of the modified Korteweg-de Vries\nequation, given by the Hirota equation and the Sasa-Satsuma equation. A\nbilinear formulation of these two equations is used to derive the oscillatory\n1-soliton and 2-soliton solutions, which are then written out in a physical\nform parameterized in terms of their speed, modulation frequency, and phase.\nDepending on the modulation frequency, the speeds of oscillatory waves\n(1-solitons) can be positive, negative, or zero, in contrast to the strictly\npositive speed of ordinary solitons. When the speed is zero, an oscillatory\nwave is a time-periodic standing wave. Properties of the amplitude and phase of\noscillatory 1-solitons are derived. Oscillatory 2-solitons are graphically\nillustrated to describe collisions between two oscillatory 1-solitons in the\ncase when the speeds are distinct. In the special case of equal speeds,\noscillatory 2-solitons are shown to reduce to harmonically modulated breather\nwaves.\n", "  The Hirota equation and the Sasa-Satsuma equation are U(1)-invariant\nintegrable generalizations of the modified Korteweg-de Vries equation. These\ntwo generalizations admit oscillatory solitons, which describe harmonically\nmodulated complex solitary waves parameterized by their speed, modulation\nfrequency, and phase. Depending on the modulation frequency, the speeds of\noscillatory waves (1-solitons) can be positive, negative, or zero, in contrast\nto the strictly positive speed of ordinary solitons. When the speed is zero, an\noscillatory wave is a time-periodic standing wave. Oscillatory 2-solitons with\nnon-zero wave speeds are shown to describe overtake collisions of a fast wave\nand a slow wave moving in the same direction, or head-on collisions of two\nwaves moving in opposite directions. When one wave speed is zero, oscillatory\n2-solitons are shown to describe collisions in which a moving wave overtakes a\nstanding wave. An asymptotic analysis using moving coordinates is carried out\nto show that, in all collisions, the speeds and modulation frequencies of the\nindividual waves are preserved, while the phases and positions undergo a shift\nsuch that the center of momentum of the two waves moves at a constant speed.\nThe primary constants of motion as well as some other features of the nonlinear\ninteraction of the colliding waves are discussed.\n", "  Explicit solutions are obtained for a class of semilinear radial Schrodinger\nequations with power nonlinearities in multi-dimensions. These solutions\ninclude new similarity solutions and other new group-invariant solutions, as\nwell as new solutions that are not invariant under any symmetries of this class\nof equations. Many of the solutions have interesting analytical behavior\nconnected with blow-up and dispersion. Several interesting nonlinearity powers\narise in these solutions, including the case of the critical (pseudo-conformal)\npower. In contrast, standard symmetry reduction methods lead to nonlinear ODEs\nfor which few if any explicit solutions can be derived by standard integration\nmethods.\n", "  A moving parallel frame method is applied to geometric non-stretching curve\nflows in the Hermitian symmetric space Sp(n)/U(n) to derive new integrable\nsystems with unitary invariance. These systems consist of a bi-Hamiltonian\nmodified Korteweg-de Vries equation and a Hamiltonian sine-Gordon (SG)\nequation, involving a scalar variable coupled to a complex vector variable. The\nHermitian structure of the symmetric space Sp(n)/U(n) is used in a natural way\nfrom the beginning in formulating a complex matrix representation of the\ntangent space sp(n)/u(n) and its bracket relations within the symmetric Lie\nalgebra (u(n),sp(n)).\n", "  Integrable systems are derived from inelastic flows of timelike, spacelike,\nand null curves in 2- and 3- dimensional Minkowski space. The derivation uses a\nLorentzian version of a geometrical moving frame method which is known to yield\nthe modified Korteveg-de Vries (mKdV) equation and the nonlinear Schrodinger\n(NLS) equation in 2- and 3- dimensional Euclidean space, respectively. In\n2-dimensional Minkowski space, timelike/spacelike inelastic curve flows are\nshown to yield the defocusing mKdV equation and its bi-Hamiltonian\nintegrability structure, while inelastic null curve flows are shown to give\nrise to Burgers' equation and its symmetry integrability structure. In\n3-dimensional Minkowski space, the complex defocusing mKdV equation and the NLS\nequation along with their bi-Hamiltonian integrability structures are obtained\nfrom timelike inelastic curve flows, whereas spacelike inelastic curve flows\nyield an interesting variant of these two integrable equations in which complex\nnumbers are replaced by hyperbolic (split-complex) numbers.\n", "  Presented here, is a technical manuscript that may form the basis of later\npublished work. In it, we develop a statistical mechanical model to describe a\nclosed loop plectoneme, applicable for when the closed loop is sufficiently\nsupercoiled. The model divides the system up into end loops and a braided\nsection; the end loops are assumed to contribute little to the super-coil\nwrithe. Within the braided section, the model incorporates interactions that\ndepend on the structure of the molecule; in particular, we consider those that\ndepend on helical structure. A method for approximating the steric interactions\nis utilized that we had previously used in other publications. We go on to\nconstruct variational approximations for our closed loop plectoneme model in\ntwo cases. The first case is where helix dependent interactions are strong, and\nin the second case they are considered weak. In developing these\napproximations, we approximate the Fuller-White condition by replacing, in all\nexpressions that depend on twist, writhe with average writhe, valid when the\nbraided section is sufficiently long. How this approximation is made and the\nconditions when this approximation is valid are also discussed. The\napproximation allows for a Legendre transformation of the free energy, which\nwith the introduction of moment (or torque), effectively allowing for twist and\naverage writhe to be treated independently in the transformed (Gibbs like) free\nenergy. Next, we then show how one may compute the average writhe of the\nbraided section. Lastly, we discuss how some of the approximations considered\nmay be relaxed, and discuss how the resulting model free energy might be\ncomputed by MC simulation.\n", "  In order to generalize the relativistic notion of boost to the case of non\ninertial particles and to general relativity, we come back to the definition of\nLie group of Lorentz matrices and its Lie algebra and we study how this group\nacts on the Minskowski space. We thus define the notion of tangent boost along\na worldline. This notion very general notion gives a useful tool both in\nspecial relativity (for non inertial particles or/and for non rectilinear\ncoordinates) and in general relativity. We also introduce a matrix of the Lie\nalgebra which, together with the tangent boost, gives the whole dynamical\ndescription of the considered system (acceleration and Thomas rotation). After\nstudying the properties of Lie algebra matrices and of their reduced forms, we\nshow that the Lie group of special Lorentz matrices has four one-parameter\nsubgroups. These tools lead us to introduce the Thomas rotation in a quite\ngeneral way. At the end of the paper, we present some examples using these\ntools and we consider the case of an electron rotating on a circular orbit\naround an atom nucleus. We then discuss the twin paradox and we show that when\nthe one who made a journey into space in a high-speed rocket returns home he is\nnot only younger than the twin who stayed on Earth but he is also disorientated\nbecause his gyroscope has turned with respect to earth referential frame.\n", "  The invariance method of Lie-groups in the theory of turbulence carries the\nhigh expectation of being a first principle method for generating statistical\nscaling laws. The purpose of this comment is to show that this expectation has\nnot been met so far. In particular for wall-bounded turbulent flows, the\nprospects for success are not promising in view of the facts we will present\nherein. Although the invariance method of Lie-groups is able to generate\nstatistical scaling laws for wall-bounded turbulent flows, like the log-law for\nexample, these invariant results yet not only fail to fulfil the basic\nrequirements for a first principle result, but also are strongly misleading.\nThe reason is that not the functional structure of the log-law itself is\nmisleading, but that its invariant Lie-group based derivation yielding this\nfunction is what is misleading. By revisiting the study of Oberlack (2001) we\nwill demonstrate that all Lie-group generated scaling laws derived therein do\nnot convince as first principle solutions. Instead, a rigorous derivation\nreveals complete arbitrariness rather than uniqueness in the construction of\ninvariant turbulent scaling laws. Important to note here is that the key\nresults obtained in Oberlack (2001) are based on several technical errors,\nwhich all will be revealed, discussed and corrected. The reason and motivation\nwhy we put our focus solely on Oberlack (2001) is that it still marks the core\nstudy and central reference point when applying the method of Lie-groups to\nturbulence theory. Hence it is necessary to shed the correct light onto that\nstudy. Nevertheless, even if the method of Lie-groups in its full extent is\napplied and interpreted correctly, strong natural limits of this method within\nthe theory of turbulence exist, which, as will be finally discussed, constitute\ninsurmountable obstacles in the progress of achieving a significant\nbreakthrough.\n", "  In this paper we will consider quantum aspects of a non-local,\ninfinite-derivative scalar field theory - a $\\it toy \\, model$ depiction of a\ncovariant infinite-derivative, non-local extension of Einstein's general\nrelativity which has previously been shown to be free from ghosts around the\nMinkowski background. The graviton propagator in this theory gets an\nexponential suppression making it $\\it asymptotically \\, free$, thus providing\nstrong prospects of resolving various classical and quantum divergences. In\nparticular, we will find that at $1$-loop, the $2$-point function is still\ndivergent, but once this amplitude is renormalized by adding appropriate\ncounter terms, the ultraviolet (UV) behavior of all other $1$-loop diagrams as\nwell as the $2$-loop, $2$-point function remains well under control. We will go\non to discuss how one may be able to generalize our computations and arguments\nto arbitrary loops.\n", "  A 4-parameter polynomial family of equations generalizing the Camassa-Holm\nand Novikov equations that describe breaking waves is introduced. A\nclassification of low-order conservation laws, peaked travelling wave\nsolutions, and Lie symmetries is presented for this family. These\nclassifications pick out a 1-parameter equation that has several interesting\nfeatures: it reduces to the Camassa-Holm and Novikov equations when the\npolynomial has degree two and three; it has a conserved $H^1$ norm and it\npossesses $N$-peakon solutions, when the polynomial has any degree; and it\nexhibits wave-breaking for certain solutions describing collisions between\npeakons and anti-peakons in the case $N=2$.\n", "  Motor-driven cargo transport is a complex phenomenon where multiple motor\nproteins attached on to a cargo engage in pulling activity, often leading to\ntug-of-war, displaying bidirectional motion. However, most mathematical and\ncomputational models ignore the details of the motor-cargo interaction. Here,\nwe study a generic model in which N motors are elastically coupled to a cargo,\nwhich itself is subjected to thermal noise in the cytoplasm and to an\nadditional external applied force. The motor-hopping rates are chosen to\nsatisfy detailed balance with respect to the energy of elastic stretching. With\nthese assumptions, an (N+1)-variable master equation is constructed for\ndynamics of the motor-cargo complex. By expanding the hopping rates to linear\norder in fluctuations in motor positions, we obtain a linear Fokker-Planck\nequation. The deterministic equations governing the average quantities are\nseparated out and explicit analytical expressions are obtained for the mean\nvelocity and diffusion coefficient of the cargo. We also study the statistical\nfeatures of the force experienced by an individual motor and quantitatively\ncharacterize the load-sharing among the cargo-bound motors. The mean cargo\nvelocity and the effective diffusion coefficient are found to be decreasing\nfunctions of the stiffness. While increase in the number of motors N does not\nincrease the velocity substantially, it decreases the effective diffusion\ncoefficient which falls as 1/N asymptotically. We further show that the\ncargo-bound motors share the force exerted on the cargo equally only in the\nlimit of vanishing elastic stiffness; as stiffness is increased, deviations\nfrom equal load sharing are observed. Numerical simulations agree with our\nanalytical results where expected. Interestingly, we find in simulations that\nthe stall force of a cargo elastically coupled to motors is independent of the\nstiffness.\n", "  We study the circularization of tidally disrupted stars on bound orbits\naround spinning supermassive black holes by performing three-dimensional\nsmoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations with Post-Newtonian corrections. Our\nsimulations reveal that debris circularization depends sensitively on the\nefficiency of radiative cooling. There are two stages in debris circularization\nif radiative cooling is inefficient: first, the stellar debris streams\nself-intersect due to relativistic apsidal precession; shocks at the\nintersection points thermalize orbital energy and the debris forms a\ngeometrically thick, ring-like structure around the black hole. The ring\nrapidly spreads via viscous diffusion, leading to the formation of a\ngeometrically thick accretion disk. In contrast, if radiative cooling is\nefficient, the stellar debris circularizes due to self-intersection shocks and\nforms a geometrically thin ring-like structure. In this case, the dissipated\nenergy can be emitted during debris circularization as a precursor to the\nsubsequent tidal disruption flare. The possible radiated energy is up to\n~2*10^{52} erg for a 1 Msun star orbiting a 10^6 Msun black hole. We also find\nthat a retrograde (prograde) black hole spin causes the shock-induced\ncircularization timescale to be shorter (longer) than that of a non-spinning\nblack hole in both cooling cases. The circularization timescale is remarkably\nlong in the radiatively efficient cooling case, and is also sensitive to black\nhole spin. Specifically, Lense-Thirring torques cause dynamically important\nnodal precession, which significantly delays debris circularization. On the\nother hand, nodal precession is too slow to produce observable signatures in\nthe radiatively inefficient case. We also discuss the relationship between our\nsimulations and the parabolic TDEs that are characteristic of most stellar\ntidal disruptions.\n", "  We analyse in this paper the data collected in a set of experiments performed\non human subjects on the combination of natural concepts. We investigate the\nmutual influence of conceptual conjunction and negation by measuring the\nmembership weights of a list of exemplars with respect to two concepts, e.g.,\n'Fruits' and 'Vegetables', and their conjunction 'Fruits And Vegetables', but\nalso their conjunction when one or both concepts are negated, namely, 'Fruits\nAnd Not Vegetables', 'Not Fruits And Vegetables' and 'Not Fruits And Not\nVegetables'. Our findings sharpen existing analysis on conceptual combinations,\nrevealing systematic and remarkable deviations from classical (fuzzy set) logic\nand probability theory. And, more important, our results give further\nconsiderable evidence to the validity of our quantum-theoretic framework for\nthe combination of two concepts. Indeed, the representation of conceptual\nnegation naturally arises from the general assumptions of our two-sector Fock\nspace model, and this representation faithfully agrees with the collected data.\nIn addition, we find a further significant deviation and a priori unexpected\nfrom classicality, which can exactly be explained by assuming that human\nreasoning is the superposition of an 'emergent reasoning' and a 'logical\nreasoning', and that these two processes can be successfully represented in a\nFock space algebraic structure.\n", "  We recently performed cognitive experiments on conjunctions and negations of\ntwo concepts with the aim of investigating the combination problem of concepts.\nOur experiments confirmed the deviations (conceptual vagueness, underextension,\noverextension, etc.) from the rules of classical (fuzzy) logic and probability\ntheory observed by several scholars in concept theory, while our data were\nsuccessfully modeled in a quantum-theoretic framework developed by ourselves.\nIn this paper, we isolate a new, very stable and systematic pattern of\nviolation of classicality that occurs in concept combinations. In addition, the\nstrength and regularity of this non-classical effect leads us to believe that\nit occurs at a more fundamental level than the deviations observed up to now.\nIt is our opinion that we have identified a deep non-classical mechanism\ndetermining not only how concepts are combined but, rather, how they are\nformed. We show that this effect can be faithfully modeled in a two-sector Fock\nspace structure, and that it can be exactly explained by assuming that human\nthought is the supersposition of two processes, a 'logical reasoning', guided\nby 'logic', and a 'conceptual reasoning' guided by 'emergence', and that the\nlatter generally prevails over the former. All these findings provide a new\nfundamental support to our quantum-theoretic approach to human cognition.\n", "  We propose a simple diatomic system trapped inside an optical cavity to\ncontrol the energy flow between two thermal baths. Through the action of the\nbaths the system is driven to a non- equilibrium steady state. Using the Large\nDeviation theory we show that the number of photons flowing between the two\nbaths is dramatically different depending on the symmetry of the atomic states.\nHere we present a deterministic scheme to prepare symmetric and antisymmetric\natomic states with the use of external driving fields, thus implementing an\natomic control switch for the energy flow.\n", "  For the general central force equations of motion in $n>1$ dimensions, a\ncomplete set of $2n$ first integrals is derived in an explicit algorithmic way\nwithout the use of dynamical symmetries or Noether's theorem. The derivation\nuses the polar formulation of the equations of motion and yields energy,\nangular momentum, a generalized Laplace-Rugge-Lenz vector, and a temporal\nquantity involving the time variable explicitly. A variant of the general\nLaplace-Rugge-Lenz vector, which generalizes Hamilton's eccentricity vector, is\nalso obtained. The physical meaning of the general Laplace-Rugge-Lenz vector,\nits variant, and the temporal quantity are discussed for general central\nforces. Their properties are compared for precessing bounded trajectories\nversus non-precessing bounded trajectories, as well as unbounded trajectories,\nby considering an inverse-square force (Kepler problem) and a cubically\nperturbed inverse-square force (Newtonian revolving orbit problem).\n", "  Imposing twisted boundary conditions on the fermionic fields is a procedure\nextensively used when evaluating, for example, form factors on the lattice.\nTwisting is usually performed for one flavour and only in the valence, and this\ncauses a breaking of unitarity. In this work we explore the possibility of\nrestoring unitarity through the reweighting method. We first study some\nproperties of the approach at tree level and then we stochastically evaluate\nratios of fermionic determinants for different boundary conditions in order to\ninclude them in the gauge averages, avoiding in this way the expensive\ngeneration of new configurations for each choice of the twisting angle,\n$\\theta$. As expected the effect of reweighting is negligible in the case of\nlarge volumes but it is important when the volumes are small and the twisting\nangles are large. In particular we find a measurable effect for the plaquette\nand the pion correlation function in the case of $\\theta=\\pi/2$ in a volume\n$16\\times 8^3$, and we observe a systematic upward shift in the pion dispersion\nrelation.\n", "  Social interaction increases significantly the performance of a wide range of\ncooperative systems. However, evidence that natural swarms limit the number of\nsocial connections suggests potentially detrimental consequences of excessive\nsocial activity. Using a canonical model of collective motion, we find that the\nresponsiveness of a swarm to local perturbations is reduced when the social\ninteraction exceeds a certain threshold. We uncover a similar effect for two\ndistinct collective decision-making models of distributed consensus operating\nover a range of static networks. While increasing the amount of interaction\nalways increases the capacity of these systems to adapt to slow changes, an\nexcess of social behavior can hinder the swiftness of their response to fast\nperturbations. These results have far-reaching implications for the design of\nartificial swarms or interaction networks.\n", "  Optomechanical cooling is a prerequisite for many exotic applications\npromised by modern quantum technology and it is crucial to achieve it in short\ntimes, in order to minimize the undesirable effects of the environment. We\nformulate cavity optomechanical cooling as a minimum-time optimal control\nproblem on anti-de Sitter space of appropriate dimension and use the Legendre\npseudospectral optimization method to find the minimum time and the\ncorresponding optimal control, for various values of the maximum coupling rate\nbetween the cavity field and the mechanical resonator. The present framework\ncan also be applied to create optomechanical entanglement in minimum time and\nto improve the efficiency of an optomechanical quantum heat engine.\n", "  Numerical weather prediction (NWP) has proven to be computationally\nchallenging due to its inherent multiscale nature. Currently, the highest\nresolution NWP models use a horizontal resolution of about 10km. In order to\nincrease the resolution of NWP models highly scalable atmospheric models are\nneeded.\n  The Non-hydrostatic Unified Model of the Atmosphere (NUMA), developed by the\nauthors at the Naval Postgraduate School, was designed to achieve this purpose.\nNUMA is used by the Naval Research Laboratory, Monterey as the engine inside\nits next generation weather prediction system NEPTUNE. NUMA solves the fully\ncompressible Navier-Stokes equations by means of high-order Galerkin methods\n(both spectral element as well as discontinuous Galerkin methods can be used).\nMesh generation is done using the p4est library. NUMA is capable of running\nmiddle and upper atmosphere simulations since it does not make use of the\nshallow-atmosphere approximation.\n  This paper presents the performance analysis and optimization of the spectral\nelement version of NUMA. The performance at different optimization stages is\nanalyzed using a theoretical performance model as well as measurements via\nhardware counters. Machine independent optimization is compared to machine\nspecific optimization using BG/Q vector intrinsics. By using vector intrinsics\nthe main computations reach 1.2 PFlops on the entire machine Mira (12% of the\ntheoretical peak performance). The paper also presents scalability studies for\ntwo idealized test cases that are relevant for NWP applications. The\natmospheric model NUMA delivers an excellent strong scaling efficiency of 99%\non the entire supercomputer Mira using a mesh with 1.8 billion grid points.\nThis allows to run a global forecast of a baroclinic wave test case at 3km\nuniform horizontal resolution and double precision within the time frame\nrequired for operational weather prediction.\n", "  The relaxion scenario presents an intriguing extension of the standard model\nin which the particle introduced to solve to the strong CP problem, the axion,\nalso achieves the dynamical relaxation of the Higgs boson mass term. In this\nwork we complete this framework by proposing a scenario of inflationary\ncosmology that is consistent with all the observational constraints: the\nrelaxion hybrid inflation with an asymmetric waterfall. In our scheme, the\nvacuum energy of the inflaton drives inflation in a natural way while the\nrelaxion slow-rolls. The constraints on the present inflationary observables\nare then matched through a subsequent inflationary epoch driven by the\ninflaton. We quantify the amount of fine-tuning of the proposed inflation\nscenario, concluding that the inflaton sector severely decreases the\nnaturalness of the theory.\n", "  A key component of characterizing multi-planet exosystems is testing the\norbital stability based on the observed properties. Such characterization not\nonly tests the validity of how observations are interpreted but can also place\nadditional constraints upon the properties of the detected planets. The Kepler\nmission has identified hundreds of multi-planet systems but there are a few\nthat have additional non-transiting planets and also have well characterized\nhost stars. Kepler-68 is one such system for which we are able to provide a\ndetailed study of the orbital dynamics. We use the stellar parameters to\ncalculate the extent of the Habitable Zone for this system, showing that the\nouter planet lies within that region. We use N-body integrations to study the\norbital stability of the system, in particular placing an orbital inclination\nconstraint on the outer planet of i > 5 degrees. Finally, we present the\nresults of an exhaustive stability simulation that investigates possible\nlocations of stable orbits for an Earth-mass planet. We show that there are\nseveral islands of stability within the Habitable Zone that could harbor such a\nplanet, most particularly at the 2:3 mean motion resonance with the outer\nplanet.\n", "  Over the past decades, the role of torsion in gravity has been extensively\ninvestigated along the main direction of bringing gravity closer to its gauge\nformulation and incorporating spin in a geometric description. Here we review\nvarious torsional constructions, from teleparallel, to Einstein-Cartan, and\nmetric-affine gauge theories, resulting in extending torsional gravity in the\nparadigm of f(T) gravity, where f(T) is an arbitrary function of the torsion\nscalar. Based on this theory, we further review the corresponding cosmological\nand astrophysical applications. In particular, we study cosmological solutions\narising from f(T) gravity, both at the background and perturbation levels, in\ndifferent eras along the cosmic expansion. The f(T) gravity construction can\nprovide a theoretical interpretation of the late-time universe acceleration,\nand it can easily accommodate with the regular thermal expanding history\nincluding the radiation and cold dark matter dominated phases. Furthermore, if\none traces back to very early times, a sufficiently long period of inflation\ncan be achieved and hence can be investigated by cosmic microwave background\nobservations, or alternatively, the Big Bang singularity can be avoided due to\nthe appearance of non-singular bounces. Various observational constraints,\nespecially the bounds coming from the large-scale structure data in the case of\nf(T) cosmology, as well as the behavior of gravitational waves, are described\nin detail. Moreover, the spherically symmetric and black hole solutions of the\ntheory are reviewed. Additionally, we discuss various extensions of the f(T)\nparadigm. Finally, we consider the relation with other modified gravitational\ntheories, such as those based on curvature, like f(R) gravity, trying to\nenlighten the subject of which formulation might be more suitable for\nquantization ventures and cosmological applications.\n", "  We consider the bound states of a system consisting of a light particle and\ntwo heavy bosonic ones, which are restricted in their quantum mechanical motion\nto two space dimensions. A $p$-wave resonance in the heavy-light short-range\npotential establishes the interaction between the two heavy particles. Due to\nthe large ratio of the atomic masses this planar three-body system is perfectly\nsuited for the Born-Oppenheimer approximation which predicts a Coulomb energy\nspectrum with a Gaussian cut-off.\n", "  In this article, we present results from a series of Virtual CRASH-based\npedestrian impact simulations. We compare the results of these Virtual CRASH\npedestrian impact simulations to data from pedestrian impact collisions staged\nat the Institute of Police Technology and Management.\n", "  A fundamental requirement in the circuit model of quantum information\nprocessing is the realization of fault-tolerant multi-qubit quantum gates with\nentangling capabilities. A key step towards this end is to achieve control of\nqubit states through geometric phases at very small spatial scales in an\neffective and feasible way. A spin-electric coupling present in\nantiferromagnetic triangular single-molecule magnets (SMMs) allows for\nmanipulation of the spin (qubit) states with a great flexibility. Here, we\nestablish an all-electrical two-qubit geometric phase shift gate acting on the\nfour-fold ground state manifold of a triangular SMM, which represents an\neffective two-qubit state space. We show that a two-qubit quantum gate with\narbitrary entangling power can be achieved through the Berry phase effect,\ninduced by adiabatically varying an external electric field in the plane of the\nmolecule.\n", "  There are still debates on whether the observed zero energy peak in the\nexperiment by Stevan {\\it et al.} [Science 346, 602(2014)] reveals the\nexistence of the long pursuing Majorana bound states (MBS). we propose that, by\nmounting two scanning tunneling microscopic tips on top of the topological\nsuperconducting chain and measure the transmission spectrum between these two\nmetallic tips, there are two kinds of characteristics on the spectrum that are\ncaused by MBS uniquely. One is symmetric peaks with respect to zero energy and\nthe other is $4\\pi$ period caused by a nearby Josephson junction. The former\nrefers to the fact that MBS are composited by Majorana fermions which\ndistributed in the particle and hole subspaces equally. The latter is based on\nthe well known $4\\pi$ period of Josephson effect in topological superconductor.\nWe think such two characteristics can be used as criteria to distinguish MBS\nfrom other candidates, such as impurities, Kondo effect and traditional Andreev\nbound states.\n", "  This paper generalizes the Stefan-Boltzmann law to include massive photons. A\ncrucial ingredient to obtain the correct formula for the radiance is to realize\nthat a massive photon does not travel at the speed of (massless) light. It\nfollows that, contrary to what could be expected, the radiance is not\nproportional to the energy density times the speed of light.\n", "  We demonstrate that the gauge-fixed Lagrangian of the Christ-Lee model\nrespects four fermionic symmetries, namely; (anti-)BRST symmetries,\n(anti-)co-BRST symmetries within the framework of BRST formalism. The\nappropriate anticommutators amongst the fermionic symmetries lead to a unique\nbosonic symmetry. It turns out that the algebra obeyed by the symmetry\ntransformations (and their corresponding conserved charges) is reminiscent of\nthe algebra satisfied by the de Rham cohomological operators of differential\ngeometry. We also provide the physical realizations of the cohomological\noperators in terms of the symmetry properties. Thus, the present model provides\na simple model for the Hodge theory.\n", "  The scientific community is becoming more and more interested in the research\nthat applies the mathematical formalism of quantum theory to model human\ndecision-making. In this paper, we provide the theoretical foundations of the\nquantum approach to cognition that we developed in Brussels. These foundations\nrest on the results of two decade studies on the axiomatic and\noperational-realistic approaches to the foundations of quantum physics. The\ndeep analogies between the foundations of physics and cognition lead us to\ninvestigate the validity of quantum theory as a general and unitary framework\nfor cognitive processes, and the empirical success of the Hilbert space models\nderived by such investigation provides a strong theoretical confirmation of\nthis validity. However, two situations in the cognitive realm, 'question order\neffects' and 'response replicability', indicate that even the Hilbert space\nframework could be insufficient to reproduce the collected data. This does not\nmean that the mentioned operational-realistic approach would be incorrect, but\nsimply that a larger class of measurements would be in force in human\ncognition, so that an extended quantum formalism may be needed to deal with all\nof them. As we will explain, the recently derived 'extended Bloch\nrepresentation' of quantum theory (and the associated 'general\ntension-reduction' model) precisely provides such extended formalism, while\nremaining within the same unitary interpretative framework.\n", "  The chiral phase transition of the strongly interacting matter is\ninvestigated at nonzero temperature and baryon chemical potential mu_B within\nan extended (2+1) flavor Polyakov constituent quark-meson model which\nincorporates the effect of the vector and axial vector mesons. The effect of\nthe fermionic vacuum and thermal fluctuations computed from the grand potential\nof the model is taken into account in the curvature masses of the scalar and\npseudoscalar mesons. The parameters of the model are determined by comparing\nmasses and tree-level decay widths with experimental values in a\nchi^2-minimization procedure which selects between various possible assignments\nof scalar nonet states to physical particles. We examine the restoration of the\nchiral symmetry by monitoring the temperature evolution of condensates and the\nchiral partners' masses and of the mixing angles for the pseudoscalar eta-eta'\nand the corresponding scalar complex. We calculate the pressure and various\nthermodynamical observables derived from it and compare them to the continuum\nextrapolated lattice results of the Wuppertal-Budapest collaboration. We study\nthe T-mu_B phase diagram of the model and find that a critical end point exists\nfor parameters of the model, which give acceptable values of chi^2.\n", "  Theories of natural language and concepts have been unable to model the\nflexibility, creativity, context-dependence, and emergence, exhibited by words,\nconcepts and their combinations. The mathematical formalism of quantum theory\nhas instead been successful in capturing these phenomena such as graded\nmembership, situational meaning, composition of categories, and also more\ncomplex decision making situations, which cannot be modeled in traditional\nprobabilistic approaches. We show how a formal quantum approach to concepts and\ntheir combinations can provide a powerful extension of prototype theory. We\nexplain how prototypes can interfere in conceptual combinations as a\nconsequence of their contextual interactions, and provide an illustration of\nthis using an intuitive wave-like diagram. This quantum-conceptual approach\ngives new life to original prototype theory, without however making it a\nprivileged concept theory, as we explain at the end of our paper.\n", "  The decorrelation in the azimuthal angle between the most forward and the\nmost backward jets (Mueller-Navelet jets) is measured in data collected in pp\ncollisions with the CMS detector at the LHC at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV. The measurement\nis presented in the form of distributions of azimuthal-angle differences,\nDelta(phi), between the Mueller-Navelet jets, the average cosines of (pi -\nDelta(phi)), 2(pi - Delta(phi)), and 3(pi - Delta(phi)), and ratios of these\ncosines. The jets are required to have transverse momenta, pT, in excess of 35\nGeV and rapidities, |y|, of less than 4.7. The results are presented as a\nfunction of the rapidity separation, Delta(y), between the Mueller-Navelet\njets, reaching Delta(y) up to 9.4 for the first time. The results are compared\nto predictions of various Monte Carlo event generators and to analytical\npredictions based on the DGLAP and BFKL parton evolution schemes.\n", "  Non-local games are an important part of quantum information processing.\nRecently there has been an increased interest in generalizing non-local games\nbeyond the basic setup by considering games with multiple parties and/or with\nlarge alphabet inputs and outputs. In this paper we consider another\ninteresting generalization -- games with non-uniform inputs. Here we derive a\ntight upper bound for the classical winning probability for a specific family\nof non-local games with non-uniform input distribution, known as\n$\\mathrm{CHSH}_q(p)$ which was introduced recently in the context of\nrelativistic bit-commitment protocols by [Chakraborty et. al., PRL 115, 250501,\n2015].\n", "  We present the results of ALMA band 7 observations of dust and CO gas in the\ndisks around 7 objects with spectral types ranging between M5.5 and M7.5 in\nUpper Scorpius OB1, and one M3 star in Ophiuchus. We detect unresolved\ncontinuum emission in all but one source, and the $^{12}$CO J=3-2 line in two\nsources. We constrain the dust and gas content of these systems using a grid of\nmodels calculated with the radiative transfer code MCFOST, and find disk dust\nmasses between 0.1 and 1 M$_\\oplus$, suggesting that the stellar mass / disk\nmass correlation can be extrapolated for brown dwarfs with masses as low as\n0.05 M$_\\odot$. The one disk in Upper Sco in which we detect CO emission, 2MASS\nJ15555600, is also the disk with warmest inner disk as traced by its H - [4.5]\nphotometric color. Using our radiative transfer grid, we extend the correlation\nbetween stellar luminosity and mass-averaged disk dust temperature originally\nderived for stellar mass objects to the brown dwarf regime to $\\langle T_{dust}\n\\rangle \\approx 22 (L_{*} /L_{\\odot})^{0.16} K$, applicable to spectral types\nof M5 and later. This is slightly shallower than the relation for earlier\nspectral type objects and yields warmer low-mass disks. The two prescriptions\ncross at 0.27 L$_\\odot$, corresponding to masses between 0.1 and 0.2 M$_\\odot$\ndepending on age.\n", "  We present a general diagrammatic theory for determining consistent\nelectromagnetic response functions in strongly correlated fermionic\nsuperfluids. The general treatment of correlations beyond BCS theory requires a\nnew theoretical formalism not contained in the current literature. Among\nconcrete examples are a rather extensive class of theoretical models which\nincorporate BCS-BEC crossover as applied to the ultra cold Fermi gases, along\nwith theories specifically associated with the high-$T_c$ cuprates. The\nchallenge is to maintain gauge invariance, while simultaneously incorporating\nadditional self-energy terms arising from strong correlation effects. Central\nto our approach is the application of the Ward-Takahashi identity, which\nintroduces collective mode contributions in the response functions and\nguarantees that the $f$-sum rule is satisfied. We outline a powerful and very\ngeneral method to determine these collective modes in a manner compatible with\ngauge invariance. Finally, as an alternative approach, we contrast with the\npath integral formalism. Here, the calculation of gauge invariant response\nappears more straightforward. However, the collective modes introduced are\nessentially those of strict BCS theory, with no modification from correlation\neffects. Since the path integral scheme simultaneously addresses\nelectrodynamics and thermodynamics, we emphasize that it should be subjected to\na consistency test beyond gauge invariance, namely that of the compressibility\nsum-rule. We show how this sum-rule fails in the conventional path integral\napproach.\n", "  We present a laser system with a linewidth and long-term frequency stability\nat the 50 kHz level. It is based on a Ti:Sapphire laser emitting radiation at\n882 nm which is referenced to an atomic transition. For this, the length of an\nevacuated transfer cavity is stabilized to a reference laser at 780 nm locked\nto the $^{85}$Rb D$_2$-line via modulation transfer spectroscopy. Gapless\nfrequency tuning of the spectroscopy laser is realized using the sideband\nlocking technique to the transfer cavity. In this configuration, the linewidth\nof the spectroscopy laser is derived from the transfer cavity, while the\nlong-term stability is derived from the atomic resonance. Using an optical\nfrequency comb, the frequency stability and linewidth of both lasers are\ncharacterized by comparison against an active hydrogen maser frequency standard\nand an ultra-narrow linewidth laser, respectively. The laser system presented\nhere will be used for spectroscopy of the $1s^{2}2s^{2}2p\\ ^{2}P_{1/2} -\\\n^{2}P_{3/2}$ transition in sympathetically cooled Ar$^{13+}$ ions at 441nm\nafter frequency doubling.\n", "  Recently, several anomalies in flavor physics have been observed, and it was\nnoticed that leptoquarks might account for the deviations from the Standard\nModel. In this work, we examine the effects of new physics originating from a\nscalar leptoquark model on the kaon sector. The leptoquark we consider is a\nTeV-scale particle and within the reach of the LHC. We use the existing\nexperimental data on the several kaon processes including $K^{0}-\\bar{K}^{0}$\nmixing, rare decays $K^{+} \\rightarrow \\pi^{+} \\nu \\bar{\\nu}$, $ K_L\n\\rightarrow \\pi^0 \\nu \\bar{\\nu}$, short-distance part of $K_L\\rightarrow\n\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$, and lepton-flavor-violating decay $K_L\\rightarrow \\mu^{\\pm}\ne^{\\mp}$ to obtain useful constraints on the model.\n", "  In this paper, we will consider scattering diagrams in the context of\ninfinite-derivative theories. First, we examine a finite-order\nhigher-derivative scalar field theory and find that we cannot eliminate the\nexternal momentum divergences of scattering diagrams in the regime of large\nexternal momenta. Then, we employ an infinite-derivative scalar toy model and\nobtain that the external momentum dependence of scattering diagrams is\nconvergent as the external momenta become very large. In order to eliminate the\nexternal momentum divergences, one has to dress the bare vertices of the\nscattering diagrams by considering renormalised propagator and vertex loop\ncorrections to the bare vertices. Finally, we investigate scattering diagrams\nin the context of a scalar toy model which is inspired by a\n$\\mathit{ghost-free}$ and $\\mathit{singularity-free}$ infinite-derivative\ntheory of gravity, where we conclude that infinite derivatives can eliminate\nthe external momentum divergences of scattering diagrams and make the\nscattering diagrams convergent in the ultraviolet.\n", "  Single crystal tungsten ditelluride (WTe2) has recently been discovered to\nexhibit non-saturating extreme magnetoresistance in bulk; it has also emerged\nas a new layered material from which atomic layer crystals can be extracted.\nWhile atomically thin WTe2 is attractive for its unique properties, little\nstudy has been conducted on single- and few-layer WTe2. Here we report the\nisolation of single- and few-layer WTe2, as well as fabrication and\ncharacterization of the first WTe2 suspended nanostructures. We have observed\nnew Raman signatures of few-layer WTe2 that have been theoretically predicted\nbut not yet reported to date, in both on-substrate and suspended WTe2 flakes.\nWe have further probed the nanomechanical properties of suspended WTe2\nstructures by measuring their flexural resonances, and obtain a Young's modulus\nof E_Y~80GPa for the suspended WTe2 flakes. This study paves the way for future\ninvestigations and utilization of the multiple new Raman fingerprints of\nsingle- and few-layer WTe2, and for exploring mechanical control of WTe2 atomic\nlayers.\n", "  A search for exclusive or quasi-exclusive gamma gamma to W+W- production, via\npp to p(*) W+W- p(*) to p(*) mu+/- e-/+ at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV, is reported using\ndata corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 inverse femtobarns.\nEvents are selected by requiring the presence of an electron-muon pair with\nlarge transverse momentum pt(mu+/- e-/+) > 30 GeV, and no associated charged\nparticles detected from the same vertex. The 8 TeV results are combined with\nthe previous 7 TeV results (obtained for 5.05 inverse femtobarns of data). In\nthe signal region, 13 (2) events are observed over an expected background of\n3.9 +/- 0.6 (0.84 +/-0.15) events for 8 (7) TeV, resulting in a combined excess\nof 3.4 standard deviations over the background-only hypothesis. The observed\nyields and kinematic distributions are compatible with the standard model\nprediction for exclusive and quasi-exclusive gamma gamma to W+W- production.\nUpper limits on the anomalous quartic gauge coupling operators a[W;0,C]\n(dimension-6) and f[M0,1,2,3] (dimension-8), the most stringent to date, are\nderived from the measured dilepton transverse momentum spectrum.\n", "  This paper reports a study on the truncated Israel-Stewart formalism for bulk\nviscosity using the extended holographic Ricci dark energy (EHRDE), where the\ndensity of dark energy is given as a combination of the Hubble parameter and\nits derivative. The equations of motion are integrated and the resulting model\nis analysed under many aspects, including the state finder parameters and the\ngeneralised thermodynamics second law. Under the consideration that the\nuniverse is dominated by EHRDE the evolution equation for the bulk viscous\npressure $\\Pi$ in the framework of the truncated Israel-Stewart theory has been\ntaken as $\\tau \\dot{\\Pi}+\\Pi=-3\\xi H$, where $\\tau$ is the relaxation time and\n$\\xi$ is the bulk viscosity coefficient. Considering effective pressure as a\nsum of thermodynamic pressure of EHRDE and bulk viscous pressure it has been\nobserved that under the influence of bulk viscosity the EoS parameter $w_{DE}$\nis behaving like phantom i.e. $w_{DE}\\leq -1$. It has been observed that the\nmagnitude of the effective pressure $p_{eff}=p+\\Pi$ is decaying with time. We\nalso investigated the case for a specific choice of scale factor namely\n$a(t)=(t-t_0)^{\\frac{\\beta}{1-\\alpha}}$. For this choice we have observed that\na transition from quintessence to phantom is possible for the equation of state\nparameter. However, the $\\Lambda$CDM phase is not attainable by the statefinder\ntrajectories for this choice. Finally it has been observed that in both of the\ncases the generalized second law of thermodynamics is valid for the viscous\nEHRDE dominated universe enveloped by the apparent horizon.\n", "  Aerosol particles experience significant photophoretic forces at low\npressure. Previous work assumed the average particle temperature to be very\nclose to the gas temperature. This might not always be the case. If the\nparticle temperature or the thermal radiation field differs significantly from\nthe gas temperature (optically thin gases), given approximations overestimate\nthe photophoretic force by an order of magnitude on average with maximum errors\nup to more than three magnitudes. We therefore developed a new general\napproximation which on average only differs by 1 % from the true value.\n", "  We study a trapped two-dimensional spin-imbalanced Fermi gas over a range of\ntemperatures. In the moderate temperature regime, associated with current\nexperiments, we find reasonable semi-quantitative agreement with the measured\ndensity profiles as functions of varying spin imbalance and interaction\nstrength. Our calculations show that, in contrast to the three-dimensional\ncase, the phase separation which appears as a spin balanced core, can be\nassociated with non-condensed fermion pairs. We present predictions at lower\ntemperatures where a quasi-condensate will first appear, based on the pair\nmomentum distribution and following the protocols of Jochim and collaborators.\nWhile these profiles also indicate phase separation, they exhibit distinctive\nfeatures which may aid in identifying the condensation regime.\n", "  Non-thermal atmospheric plasma (NTAP) can be applied to living tissues and\ncells as a novel technology for cancer therapy. Even though studies report on\nthe successful use of NTAP to directly irradiate cancer cells, this technology\ncan cause cell death only in the upper 3-5 cell layers. We report on a NTAP\nargon solution generated in DI water for treating human gastric cancer cells\n(NCl-N87). Our findings showed that the plasma generated in DI water during a\n30-minute treatment had the strongest affect in inducing apoptosis in cultured\nhuman gastric cancer cells. This result can be attributed to presence of\nreactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) produced in\nwater during treatment. Furthermore, the data showed that elevated levels of\nRNS may play an even more significant role than ROS in the rate of apoptosis in\ngastric cancer cells.\n", "  Topological insulators are attracting considerable interest due to their\npotential for technological applications and as platforms for exploring\nwide-ranging fundamental science questions. In order to exploit, fine-tune,\ncontrol and manipulate the topological surface states, spectroscopic tools\nwhich can effectively probe their properties are of key importance. Here, we\ndemonstrate that positrons provide a sensitive probe for topological states,\nand that the associated annihilation spectrum provides a new technique for\ncharacterizing these states. Firm experimental evidence for the existence of a\npositron surface state near Bi$_2$Te$_2$Se with a binding energy of $E_b = 2.7\n\\pm 0.2 \\, \\text{eV}$ is presented, and is confirmed by first-principles\ncalculations. Additionally, the simulations predict a significant signal\noriginating from annihilation with the topological surface states and shows the\nfeasibility to detect their spin-texture through the use of spin-polarized\npositron beams.\n", "  Eigenstates of Bose particles with repulsive contact interactions in\none-dimensional space with periodic boundary conditions can be found with the\nhelp of the Bethe ansatz. The type~II excitation spectrum identified by E. H.\nLieb, reproduces the dispersion relation of dark solitons in the mean-field\napproach. The corresponding eigenstates possess translational symmetry which\ncan be broken in measurements of positions of particles. We analyze emergence\nof single and double solitons in the course of the measurements and investigate\ndynamics of the system. In the weak interaction limit, the system follows the\nmean-field prediction for a short period of time. Long time evolution reveals\nmany-body effects that are related to an increasing uncertainty of soliton\npositions. In the strong interaction regime particles behave like impenetrable\nbosons. Then, the probability densities in the configuration space become\nidentical to the probabilities of non-interacting fermions but the\nwave-functions themselves remember the original Bose statistics. Especially,\nthe phase flips that are key signatures of the solitons in the weak interaction\nlimit, can be observed in the time evolution of the strongly interacting\nbosons.\n", "  We have developed a position response calibration method for a micro-channel\nplate (MCP) detector with a delay-line anode position readout scheme. Using an\n{\\em in situ} calibration mask, an accuracy of 8~$\\mu$m and a resolution of\n85~$\\mu$m (FWHM) have been achieved for MeV-scale $\\alpha$ particles and ions\nwith energies of $\\sim$10~keV. At this level of accuracy, the difference\nbetween the MCP position responses to high-energy $\\alpha$ particles and\nlow-energy ions is significant. The improved performance of the MCP detector\ncan find applications in many fields of AMO and nuclear physics. In our case,\nit helps reducing systematic uncertainties in a high-precision nuclear\n$\\beta$-decay experiment.\n", "  We consider the physics of an optomechanical cavity subject to coherent\ntwo-phonon driving, i.e. degenerate parametric amplification of the mechanical\nmode. We show that in such a system, the cavity mode can effectively \"inherit\"\nparametric driving from the mechanics, yielding phase-sensitive amplification\nand squeezing of optical signals reflected from the cavity. We also demonstrate\nhow such a system can be used to perform single-quadrature detection of a\nnear-resonant narrow-band force applied to the mechanics with extremely low\nadded noise from the optics. The system also exhibits strong differences from a\nconventional degenerate parametric amplifier: in particular, the cavity\nspectral function can become negative, indicating a negative effective photon\ntemperature.\n", "  The WASP-98 planetary system represents a rare case of a hot Jupiter hosted\nby a metal-poor main-sequence star. We present a follow-up study of this system\nbased on multi-band photometry and high-resolution spectroscopy. Two new\ntransit events of WASP-98b were simultaneously observed in four passbands\n(g,r,i,z), using the telescope-defocussing technique, yielding eight\nhigh-precision light curves with point-to-point scatters of less than 1 mmag.\nWe also collected three spectra of the parent star with a high-resolution\nspectrograph, which we used to remeasure its spectral characteristics, in\nparticular its metallicity. We found this to be very low, Fe/H]=-0.49, but\nlarger than was previously reported, [Fe/H]=-0.60. We used these new\nphotometric and spectroscopic data to refine the orbital and physical\nproperties of this planetary system, finding that the stellar and planetary\nmass measurements are significantly larger than those in the discovery paper.\nIn addition, the multi-band light curves were used to construct an optical\ntransmission spectrum of WASP-98b and probe the characteristics of its\natmosphere at the terminator. We measured a lower radius at z compared with the\nother three passbands. The maximum variation is between the r and z bands, has\na confidence level of roughly 6 sigma and equates to 5.5 pressure scale\nheights. We compared this spectrum to theoretical models, investigating several\npossible types of atmospheres, including hazy, cloudy, cloud-free, and clear\natmospheres with titanium and vanadium oxide opacities. We could not find a\ngood fit to the observations, except in the extreme case of a clear atmosphere\nwith TiO and VO opacities, in which the condensation of Ti and V was\nsuppressed. As this case is unrealistic, our results suggest the presence of an\nadditional optical-absorbing species in the atmosphere of WASP-98b, of unknown\nchemical nature.\n", "  We present a dynamical mechanism leading to dissipationless conductance,\nwhose quantized value is controllable, in a (3+1)-dimensional electronic\nsystem. The mechanism is exemplified by a theory of Weyl fermions coupled to a\nHiggs field--also known as an axion insulator. We show that the insertion of an\naxial gauge flux can induce vortex lines in the Higgs field, similarly to the\ndevelopment of vortices in a superconductor upon the insertion of magnetic\nflux. We further show that the necessary axial gauge flux can be generated\nusing Rashba spin-orbit coupling or a magnetic field. Vortex lines in the Higgs\nfield are known to bind chiral fermionic modes, each of which serves as a\none-way channel for electric charge with conductance $e^2/h$. Combining these\nelements, we present a physical picture, the \"topological coaxial cable,\"\nillustrating how the value of the quantized conductance could be controlled in\nsuch an axion insulator.\n", "  Quantum secure communication brings a new direction for information security.\nAs an important component of quantum secure communication, deterministic joint\nremote state preparation (DJRSP) could securely transmit a quantum state with\n100\\% success probability. In this paper, we study how the efficiency of DJRSP\nis affected when qubits involved in the protocol are subjected to noise or\ndecoherence. Taking a GHZ based DJRSP scheme as an example, we study all types\nof noise usually encountered in real-world implementations of quantum\ncommunication protocols, i.e., the bit-flip, phase-flip (phase-damping),\ndepolarizing, and amplitude-damping noise. Our study shows that the fidelity of\nthe output state depends on the phase factor, the amplitude factor and the\nnoise parameter in the bit-flip noise, while the fidelity only depends on the\namplitude factor and the noise parameter in the other three types of noise. And\nthe receiver will get different output states depending on the first preparer's\nmeasurement result in the amplitude-damping noise. Our results will be helpful\nfor improving quantum secure communication in real implementation.\n", "  Recently, a Dirac (particle-hole symmetric) description of composite fermions\nin the half-filled quantum Hall system was proposed [D. T. Son, Phys. Rev. X 5,\n031027 (2015)], and we study its possible consequences on BCS (Cooper) pairing\nof composite fermions (CF's). One of the main consequences is the existence of\nanisotropic states in single and bilayer systems, which was previously\nsuggested in Ref. [J. S. Jeong and K. Park, Phys. Rev. B 91, 195119 (2015)]. We\nargue that in the half-filled single layer the gapped states may sustain\nanisotropy, because isotropic pairings may coexist with anisotropic ones.\nFurthermore, anisotropic pairings with addition of a particle-hole (PH)\nsymmetry breaking mass term may evolve into rotationally symmetric states, i.e.\nPfaffian states of Halperin-Lee-Read (HLR) ordinary CF's. On the basis of the\nDirac formalism, we argue that in the quantum Hall bilayer at total filling\none, with decreasing distance between layers weak pairing of p-wave paired CF's\nis gradually transformed from Dirac to ordinary, HLR-like, with concomitant\ndecrease in the CF number. Global characterization of low-energy spectrum based\non the Dirac CF's agrees well with previous calculations performed by exact\ndiagonalization on a torus. Finally, we discuss features of Dirac formalism\nwhen applied in this context.\n", "  We study a recently proposed quantum dimer model for the pseudogap metal\nstate of the cuprates. The model contains bosonic dimers, representing a\nspin-singlet valence bond between a pair of electrons, and fermionic dimers,\nrepresenting a quasiparticle with spin-$1/2$ and charge $+e$. By density matrix\nrenormalization group calculations on a long but finite cylinder, we obtain the\nground-state density distribution of the fermionic dimers for a number of\ndifferent total densities. From the Friedel oscillations at open boundaries, we\ndeduce that the Fermi surface consists of small hole pockets near $(\\pi/2,\n\\pi/2)$, and this feature persists up to a doping density of $1/16$. We also\ncompute the entanglement entropy and find that it closely matches the sum of\nthe entanglement entropies of a critical boson and a low density of free\nfermions. Our results support the existence of a fractionalized Fermi liquid in\nthis model.\n", "  We report the results of a Dark Energy Camera (DECam) optical follow-up of\nthe gravitational wave (GW) event GW151226, discovered by the Advanced LIGO\ndetectors. Our observations cover 28.8 deg$^2$ of the localization region in\nthe $i$ and $z$ bands (containing 3% of the BAYESTAR localization probability),\nstarting 10 hours after the event was announced and spanning four epochs at\n$2-24$ days after the GW detection. We achieve $5\\sigma$ point-source limiting\nmagnitudes of $i\\approx21.7$ and $z\\approx21.5$, with a scatter of $0.4$ mag,\nin our difference images. Given the two day delay, we search this area for a\nrapidly declining optical counterpart with $\\gtrsim 3\\sigma$ significance\nsteady decline between the first and final observations. We recover four\nsources that pass our selection criteria, of which three are cataloged AGN. The\nfourth source is offset by $5.8$ arcsec from the center of a galaxy at a\ndistance of 187 Mpc, exhibits a rapid decline by $0.5$ mag over $4$ days, and\nhas a red color of $i-z\\approx 0.3$ mag. These properties roughly match the\nexpectations for a kilonova. However, this source was detected several times,\nstarting $94$ days prior to GW151226, in the Pan-STARRS Survey for Transients\n(dubbed as PS15cdi) and is therefore unrelated to the GW event. Given its\nlong-term behavior, PS15cdi is likely a Type IIP supernova that transitioned\nout of its plateau phase during our observations, mimicking a kilonova-like\nbehavior. We comment on the implications of this detection for contamination in\nfuture optical follow-up observations.\n", "  It is shown that, an entire class of off-diagonally disordered linear\nlattices composed of two basic building blocks and described within a tight\nbinding model can be tailored to generate absolutely continuous energy bands.\nIt can be achieved if linear atomic clusters of an appropriate size are side\ncoupled to a suitable subset of sites in the backbone, and if the nearest\nneighbor hopping integrals, in the backbone and in the side coupled cluster\nbear a certain ratio. We work out the precise relationship between the number\nof atoms in one of the building blocks in the backbone, and that in the side\nattachment. In addition, we also evaluate the definite correlation between the\nnumerical values of the hopping integrals at different subsections of the\nchain, that can convert an otherwise point spectrum (or, a singular continuous\none for deterministically disordered lattices) with exponentially (or power law\n) localized eigenfunctions to an absolutely continuous spectrum comprising one\nor more bands (subbands) populated by extended, totally transparent\neigenstates. The results, which are analytically exact, put forward a\nnon-trivial variation of the Anderson localization [P. W. Anderson, Phys. Rev.\n109, 1492 (1958)], pointing towards its unusual sensitivity to the numerical\nvalues of the system parameters and, go well beyond the other related models\nsuch as the Random Dimer Model (RDM) [Dunlap et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 65, 88\n(1990)].\n", "  We use semiconductor quantum dots, \"artificial atoms,\" to implement a scheme\nfor deterministic generation of long strings of entangled photons in a cluster\nstate, an important resource for quantum information processing. We demonstrate\na prototype device which produces strings of a few hundred photons in which the\nentanglement persists over 5 sequential photons. The implementation follows a\nproposal by Lindner and Rudolph (Phys. Rev. Lett. 2009) which suggested\nperiodic timed excitation of a precessing electron spin as a mechanism for\nentangling the electron spin with the polarization of the sequentially emitted\nphotons. In our realization, the entangling qubit is a quantum dot confined\ndark exciton. By performing full quantum process tomography, we obtain the\nprocess map which fully characterizes the evolution of the system, containing\nthe dark exciton and n photons after n applications of the periodic\nexcitations. Our implementation may greatly reduce the resources needed for\nquantum information processing.\n", "  This paper studies the intermediate time behaviour of a small random\nperturbation of a periodic cellular flow. Our main result shows that on time\nscales shorter than the diffusive time scale, the limiting behaviour of\ntrajectories that start close enough to cell boundaries is a fractional kinetic\nprocess: A Brownian motion time changed by the local time of an independent\nBrownian motion. Our proof uses the Freidlin-Wentzell framework, and the key\nstep is to establish an analogous averaging principle on shorter time scales.\nAs a consequence of our main theorem, we obtain a homogenization result for the\nassociated advection-diffusion equation. We show that on intermediate time\nscales the effective equation is a fractional time PDE that arises in modelling\nanomalous diffusion.\n", "  We develope a computationally efficient extension of the Dyson Brownian\nMotion (DBM) algorithm to generate random function in C2 locally. We further\nexplain that random functions generated via DBM show an unstable growth as the\ntraversed distance increases. This feature restricts the use of such functions\nconsiderably if they are to be used to model globally defined ones. The latter\nis the case if one uses random functions to model landscapes in string theory.\nWe provide a concrete example, based on a simple axionic potential often used\nin cosmology, to highlight this problem and also offer an ad hoc modification\nof DBM that suppresses this growth to some degree.\n", "  We present systematic calculations on the spectroscopy and transition\nproperties of even-even Te isotopes by using the large-scale configuration\ninteraction shell model approach with a realistic interaction. These nuclei are\nof particular interest since their yrast spectra show a vibrational-like\nequally-spaced pattern but the few known E2 transitions show anomalous\nrotational-like behavior, which cannot be reproduced by collective models. Our\ncalculations reproduce well the equally-spaced spectra of those isotopes as\nwell as the constant behavior of the $B(E2)$ values in $^{114}$Te. The\ncalculated $B(E2)$ values for neutron-deficient and heavier Te isotopes show\ncontrasting different behaviors along the yrast line. The $B(E2)$ of light\nisotopes can exhibit a nearly constant bevavior upto high spins. We show that\nthis is related to the enhanced neutron-proton correlation when approaching\n$N=50$.\n", "  We compare the thermal conductance $G_{\\rm thermal}$ (at temperature $T$) and\nthe electrical shot noise power $P_{\\rm shot}$ (at bias voltage $V\\gg k_{\\rm\nB}T/e$) of Majorana fermions on the two-dimensional surface of a\nthree-dimensional topological superconductor. We present analytical and\nnumerical calculations to demonstrate that, for a local coupling between the\nsuperconductor and metal contacts, $G_{\\rm thermal}/P_{\\rm shot}= {\\cal L}T/eV$\n(with ${\\cal L}$ the Lorenz number). This relation is ensured by the\ncombination of electron-hole and time-reversal symmetries, irrespective of the\nmicroscopics of the surface Hamiltonian, and provides for a purely electrical\nway to detect the charge-neutral Majorana surface states. A surface of aspect\nratio $W/L\\gg 1$ has the universal shot-noise power $P_{\\rm shot}=(W/L)\\times\n(e^2/h)\\times (eV/2\\pi)$\n", "  There exists an analogy between Maxwell equations in a rotating frame and\nSchr\\\"odinger equation for a charged particle in the presence of a magnetic\nfield. We exploit this analogy to point out that electromagnetic phenomena in\nthe rotating frame, under appropriate conditions, can exhibit periodicity with\nrespect to the angular velocity of rotation. In particular, in disordered ring\ncavities one finds the optical analog of the Al'tshuler-Aronov-Spivak effect\nwell known in mesoscopic physics of disordered metals.\n", "  Fractional occupation numbers can be used in density functional theory to\ncreate a symmetric Kohn-Sham potential, resulting in orbitals with degenerate\neigenvalues. We develop the corresponding perturbation theory and apply it to a\nsystem of $N_d$ degenerate electrons in a harmonic oscillator potential. The\norder-by-order expansions of both the fractional occupation numbers and unitary\ntransformations within the degenerate subspace are determined by the\nrequirement that a differentiable map exists connecting the initial and\nperturbed states. Using the X$\\alpha$ exchange-correlation (XC) functional, we\nfind an analytic solution for the first-order density and first through\nthird-order energies as a function of $\\alpha$, with and without a\nself-interaction correction. The fact that the XC Hessian is not positive\ndefinite plays an important role in the behavior of the occupation numbers.\n", "  Instability-induced random branching of deterministic dynamics is discussed\nas a possible mechanism of random wave function collapse. In the case of two\nlevel systems, the Born probability rule emerges as the simplest linear\nsolution to the equation for measurement probabilities.\n", "  We study the resonant excitation of sound modes from Josephson oscillations\nin Bose-Einstein condensates. From the simulations for various setups using the\nGross-Pitaevskii mean-field equations and Josephson equations we observe\nadditional tunneling currents induced by resonant phonons. The proposed\nexperiment may be used for spectroscopy of phonons as well as other low-energy\ncollective excitations in Bose-Einstein condensates. We also argue that the\nobserved effect may mask the observation of Shapiro resonances if not carefully\ncontrolled.\n", "  The two-photon-annihilation contribution to the true muonium hyperfine\nsplitting arising from $e$ and $\\tau$ loops is obtained analytically at order\n$m_\\mu\\alpha^6$. The contribution to the hyperfine splitting is $-2.031092873\nm_\\mu\\alpha^6/n^3\\pi^2=-793.926988/n^3$ MHz. The contribution to the triplet\ntrue muonium decay rate has also been obtained and was found to be $9.825708266\nm_\\mu\\alpha^6/n^3\\pi^2=3840.737698/n^3$ MHz. Additional results have been\ncomputed for other purely leptonic bound states.\n", "  The Coulomb interaction among massless Dirac fermions in graphene is\nunscreened around the isotropic Dirac points, causing a logarithmic velocity\nrenormalization and a cone reshaping. In less symmetric Dirac materials\npossessing anisotropic cones with tilted axes, the Coulomb interaction can\nprovide still more exotic phenomena which have not been experimentally unveiled\nyet. Here, using site-selective nuclear magnetic resonance, we find a\nnon-uniform cone reshaping accompanied by a bandwidth reduction and an emergent\nferrimagnetism in tilted Dirac cones that appear on the verge of charge\nordering in an organic compound. Our theoretical analyses based on the\nrenormalization-group approach and the Hubbard model show that these\nobservations are the direct consequences of the long-range and short-range\nparts of the Coulomb interaction, respectively. The cone reshaping and the\nbandwidth renormalization, as well as the novel magnetism revealed here, can be\nubiquitous and vital for many Dirac materials.\n", "  Since the discovery of large, non-saturating magnetoresistance in bulk WTe2\nwhich allows microexfoliation, single- and few-layer WTe2 crystals have\nattracted increasing interests. However, as it mentioned in existing studies,\nWTe2 flakes appear to degrade in ambient conditions. Here we report\nexperimental observations of saturating degradation in few-layer WTe2 through\nRaman spectroscopy characterization and careful monitoring of the degradation\nof single-, bi- and tri-layer (1L, 2L & 3L) WTe2 over long time. Raman peak\nintensity decreases during WTe2 degradation and 1L flakes degrade faster than\n2L and 3L flakes. The relatively faster degradation in 1L WTe2 could be\nattributed to low energy barrier of oxygen reaction with WTe2. We further\ninvestigate the degradation mechanisms of WTe2 using XPS and AES and find that\noxidation of Te and W atoms is the main reason of WTe2 degradation. In\naddition, we observe oxidation occurs only in the depth of 0.5nm near the\nsurface, and the oxidized WTe2 surface could help prevent inner layers from\nfurther degradation.\n", "  We propose a new peridynamic formulation with shear deformation for linear\nelastic solid. The key idea lies in subtracting the rigid body rotation part\nfrom the total deformation. Based on the strain energy equivalence between\nclassic local model and non-local model, the bond force vector is derived. A\nnew damage rule of maximal deviatoric bond strain for elastic brittle fracture\nis proposed in order to account for both the tensile damage and shear damage.\n2D and 3D numerical examples are tested to verify the accuracy of the current\nperidynamics. The new damage rule is applied to simulate the propagation of\nMode I, II and III cracks.\n", "  We present experiments on RBCs that flow through microcapillaries under\nphysiological conditions. We show that the RBC clusters form as a subtle\nimbrication between hydrodynamics interaction and adhesion forces because of\nplasma proteins. Clusters form along the capillaries and macromolecule-induced\nadhesion contribute to their stability. However, at high yet physiological flow\nvelocities, shear stresses overcome part of the adhesion forces, and cluster\nstabilization due to hydrodynamics becomes stronger. For the case of pure\nhydrodynamic interaction, cell-to-cell distances have a pronounced bimodal\ndistribution. Our 2D-numerical simulations on vesicles captures the transition\nbetween adhesive and non-adhesive clusters at different flow velocities.\n", "  Prompted by the recent discovery of pulsed emission from an ultra-luminous\nX-ray source, M82 X-2 (\"ULX-pulsar\"), we perform a two-dimensional\nradiation-hydrodynamic simulation of a super-critical accretion flow onto a\nneutron star through a narrow accretion column. We set an accretion column with\na cone shape filled with tenuous gas with density of $10^{-4} {\\rm g}~ {\\rm\ncm}^{-3}$ above a neutron star and solve the two dimensional gas motion and\nradiative transfer within the column. The side boundaries are set such that\nradiation can freely escape, while gas cannot. Since the initial gas layer is\nnot in a hydrostatic balance, the column gas falls onto the neutron-star\nsurface, thereby a shock being generated. As a result, the accretion column is\ncomposed of two regions: an upper, nearly free-fall region and a lower settling\nregion, as was noted by Basko \\& Sunyaev (1976). The average accretion rate is\nvery high; ${\\dot M}\\sim 10^{2-3} L_{\\rm E}/c^2$ (with $L_{\\rm E}$ being the\nEddington luminosity), and so radiation energy dominates over gas internal\nenergy entirely within the column. Despite the high accretion rate, the\nradiation flux in the laboratory frame is kept barely below $L_{\\rm E}/(4\\pi\nr^2)$ at a distance $r$ in the settling region so that matter can slowly\naccrete. This adjustment is made possible, since large amount of photons\nproduced via dissipation of kinetic energy of matter can escape through the\nside boundaries. The total luminosity can greatly exceed $L_{\\rm E}$ by several\norders of magnitude, whereas the apparent luminosity observed from the top of\nthe column is much less. Due to such highly anisotropic radiation fields,\nobserved flux should exhibit periodic variations with the rotation period,\nprovided that the rotation and magnetic axes are misaligned.\n", "  A significant part of the optical metamaterial phenomena has the plasmonic\nnature and their investigation requires very accurate knowledge of the\nfabricated structures shape with a focus on the periodical features. We\ndescribe a consistent approach to the shape reconstruction of the plasmonic\nnanostructures. This includes vertical and tilted spike AFM probes fabrication,\nAFM imaging and specific post-processing. We studied a complex-shaped chiral\nmetamaterial and conclude that the described post-processing routine extends\npossibilities of the existing deconvolution algorithms in the case of\nperiodical structures with known rotational symmetry, by providing valuable\ninformation about periodical features.\n", "  We consider electrovacuum black hole spacetimes in classical extensions of\nEddington-inspired Born-Infeld gravity. By rewriting Born-Infeld action as the\nsquare root of the determinant of a matrix $\\hat{\\Omega}$, we consider the\nfamily of models $f (|\\hat{\\Omega}|)$, and study black hole solutions for a\npower-law family of models labelled by a simple parameter. We show how the\ninnermost structure of the corresponding black holes is modified as compared to\ntheir General Relativity counterparts, discussing in which cases a wormhole\nstructure replaces the point-like singularity. We go forward to argue that in\nsuch cases a geodesically complete and thus non-singular spacetime is present,\ndespite the existence of curvature divergences at the wormhole throat.\n", "  We propose and discuss a theoretical scheme to speed up Zeno dynamic passage\nby an external acceleration Hamiltonian. This scheme is a flexible and\nexperimentally feasible acceleration because the acceleration Hamiltonian does\nnot adhere rigidly to an invariant relationship, whereas it can be a more\ngeneral form $\\sum u_{j}(t)H_{cj}$. Here $H_{cj}$ can be arbitrarily selected\nwithout any limitation, and therefore one can always construct an acceleration\nHamiltonian by only using realizable $H_{cj}$. Applying our scheme, we finally\ndesign an experimentally feasible Hamiltonian as an example to speed up an\nentanglement preparation passage.\n", "  We study the neutrino mass generation in the $SU(4)_L \\otimes U(1)_X$\nelectroweak extension of the standard model by considering non-renormalizable\ndimension five effective operators. It is shown that there exist two topologies\nfor the realizations of such an operator at the tree-level and for one of the\nthree-family models is explore the neutrino phenomenology after extending its\nparticle content with an $SU(4)_L$ fermion singlet and a scalar decuplet.\nConstraints in the available parameters space of the model are partially\ndiscussed.\n", "  We investigate the optical properties of sub-wavelength layered\nmetal/dielectric structures, also known as hyperbolic metamaterials (HMMs),\nusing exact analytical Kronig Penney (KP) model. We show that hyperbolic\nisofrequency surfaces exist for all combinations of layer permittivities and\nthicknesses, and the largest Purcell enhancements (PE) of spontaneous radiation\nare achieved away from the nominally hyperbolic region. Detailed comparison of\nfield distributions, dispersion curves, and Purcell factors (PF) between the\nHMMs and Surface Plasmon Polaritons (SPPs) guided modes in metal/dielectric\nwaveguides demonstrates that HMMs are nothing but weakly coupled gap or slab\nSPPs modes. Broadband PE is not specific to the HMMs and can be easily attained\nin single thin metallic layers. Furthermore, large wavevectors and PE are\nalways combined with high loss, short propagation distances and large\nimpedances; hence PE in HMMs is essentially a direct coupling of the energy\ninto the free electron motion in the metal, or quenching of radiative lifetime.\nPE in HMMs is not related to the hyperbolicity per se but is simply the\nconsequence of the strong dispersion of permittivity in the metals or polar\ndielectrics, as our conclusions are relevant also for the infrared HMMs\noccurring in nature. When it comes to enhancement of radiating processes and\nfield concentrations, HMMs are not superior to far simpler plasmonic\nstructures.\n", "  By patterning a freestanding dielectric membrane into a photonic crystal\nreflector (PCR), it is possible to resonantly enhance its normal-incidence\nreflectivity, thereby realizing a thin, single-material mirror. In many PCR\napplications, the operating wavelength (e.g. that of a low-noise laser or\nemitter) is not tunable, imposing tolerances on crystal geometry that are not\nreliably achieved with standard nanolithography. Here we present a gentle\ntechnique to finely tune the resonant wavelength of a SiN PCR using iterative\nhydrofluoric acid etches. With little optimization, we achieve a 57-nm-thin\nphotonic crystal having an operating wavelength within 0.15 nm (0.04 resonance\nlinewidths) of our target (1550 nm). Our thin structure exhibits a broader and\nless pronounced transmission dip than is predicted by plane wave simulations,\nand we identify two effects leading to these discrepancies, both related to the\ndivergence angle of a collimated laser beam. To overcome this limitation in\nfuture devices, we distill a series of simulations into a set of general design\nconsiderations for realizing robust, high-reflectivity resonances.\n", "  I will talk on my recent works related to the flavor grand unification, weak\nCP violation, and the phases in the CKM and PMNS matrices.\n", "  Motivated by the recent experimental data of the values of the Heavy Quark\nExpansion parameters, in particular the spin-orbit and Darwin terms, we argue\nthat nature actually may be close to a limit of QCD which has been suggested by\nUraltsev more than ten years ago. Assuming that this limit is not accidental,\nwe derive the relations among the Heavy Quark Expansion parameters that occur\nup to the order 1/mb^5.\n", "  Youngs modulus of soft solids composed of crosslinked synthetic polypeptides\nhas been determined under different conditions. Co-poly-(L-glutamic acid$_4$,\nL-tyrosine$_1$) [PLEY (4:1)] was crosslinked with poly-L-lysine (PLK) and\n1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC). Elasticity\nwas assessed by subjecting samples to a compressive strain. Cross-linked\nmaterial at high relative humidity, RH 75-85%, exhibited non-linear elasticity.\nStress-strain response was approximately linear at low strain but nonlinear\nabove a threshold strain. Analysis of the secant modulus revealed apparent\nsoftening of samples at low strain and hardening at high strain, as in\nbiological soft tissues. Fitting stress-strain data with a neo-Hookean model\nyielded approximately 40 $\\le E \\le$ 300 kPa at high RH. Viscoelasticity was\nnonlinear at low RH. The average viscosity-driven relaxation time was 13 min at\nhigh strain and 6 min at low strain. Analysis of the derivative of the secant\nmodulus for non-linear elastic materials revealed a transient response up to a\nstrain of $\\varepsilon \\approx$ 0.18-0.20. Above this range, oscillations\ntended to zero. Non-linear viscoelastic materials showed lower-amplitude\noscillations than samples at high RH up to $\\varepsilon \\approx$ 0.06 and\nstrong damping thereafter. The data suggest that it will be possible to\nengineer mechanical properties of polypeptide materials.\n", "  The dynamics of Fisher information for an accelerated system initially\nprepared in the $X$-state is discussed. An analytical solution, which consists\nof three parts: classical, the average over all pure states and a mixture of\npure states is derived for the general state and for Werner state. It is shown\nthat, the Unruh acceleration has a depleting effect on the Fisher information.\nThis depletion depends on the degree of entanglement of the initial state\nsettings. For the $X$-state, for some intervals of Unruh acceleration, the\nFisher information remains constant, irrespective to the Unruh acceleration. In\ngeneral, the possibility of estimating the state's parameters decreases as the\nacceleration increases. However, the precision of estimation can be maximized\nfor certain values of the Unruh acceleration. We also investigate the\ncontribution of the different parts of the Fisher information on the dynamics\nof the total Fisher information.\n", "  We present a density based topology optimization approach for the design of\nmetallic microwave insert filters. A two-phase optimization procedure is\nproposed in which we, starting from a uniform design, first optimize to obtain\na set of spectral varying resonators followed by a band gap optimization for\nthe desired filter characteristics. This is illustrated through numerical\nexperiments and comparison to a standard band pass filter design. It is seen\nthat the carefully optimized topologies can sharpen the filter characteristics\nand improve performance. Furthermore, the obtained designs share little\nresemblance to standard filter layouts and hence the proposed design method\noffers a new design tool in microwave engineering.\n", "  Observations of exoplanetary spectra are leading to unprecedented constraints\non their atmospheric elemental abundances, particularly O/H, C/H, and C/O\nratios. Recent studies suggest that elemental ratios could provide important\nconstraints on formation and migration mechanisms of giant exoplanets. A\nfundamental assumption in such studies is that the chemical composition of the\nplanetary envelope represents the sum-total of compositions of the accreted gas\nand solids during the formation history of the planet. We investigate the\nefficiency with which accreted planetesimals ablate in a giant planetary\nenvelope thereby contributing to its composition rather than sinking to the\ncore. From considerations of aerodynamic drag causing `frictional ablation' and\nthe envelope temperature structure causing `thermal ablation', we compute mass\nablations for impacting planetesimals of radii 30 m to 1 km for different\ncompositions (ice to iron) and a wide range of velocities and impact angles,\nassuming spherical symmetry. Icy impactors are fully ablated in the outer\nenvelope for a wide range of parameters. Even for Fe impactors substantial\nablation occurs in the envelope for a wide range of sizes and velocities. For\nexample, iron impactors of sizes below ~0.5 km and velocities above ~30 km/s\nare found to ablate by ~60-80% within the outer envelope at pressures below\n10^3 bar due to frictional ablation alone. For deeper pressures (~10^7 bar),\nsubstantial ablation happens over a wider range of parameters. Therefore, our\nexploratory study suggests that atmospheric abundances of volatile elements in\ngiant planets reflect their accretion history during formation.\n", "  We present a table-top realization of a non-equilibrium quantum system\ndescribed by a dynamical gauge field propagating on an effectively curved space\nand time manifold. The system is formed by neutral atoms interacting with both\na conservative disordered optical field and a dissipative pumping field. In the\npresence of a sufficiently dark state, we demonstrate non-equilibrium behavior\nreminiscent of the information paradox in black hole physics. At a well-defined\ntransition point, the analog of gauge-boson mass is seen to vanish, inducing\nscale-invariant behavior as a Higgs-like mechanism is removed. The subsequent\nscaling behavior can be understood using the holographic principle with a\ntunable analog of the Planck length derived from the scaling of disorder. These\neffects suggest a range of new phenomena in weakly dissipative quantum systems,\nincluding the presence of analog forms of emergent gravitation.\n", "  Non-classical correlations denote the ways in which quantum systems can be\ncorrelated beyond what is possible in classical physics. They include but are\nnot limited to entanglement: non-entangled states can also exhibit forms of\nnon-classical correlations. We here review the literature on metrological\nmeasures of non-classical correlations and show how they relate to increased\nprobe sensitivity in quantum metrology protocols such as interferometric\nparameter estimation and state discrimination.\n", "  This paper is concerned with Dirichlet problem $u(0,t)=0$,\n$\\theta(0,t)=\\theta_-$ for one-dimensional full compressible Navier-Stokes\nequations in the half space $\\R_+=(0,+\\infty)$. Because the boundary decay rate\nis hard to control, stability of contact discontinuity result is very\ndifficult. In this paper, we raise the decay rate and establish that for a\ncertain class of large perturbation, the asymptotic stability result is contact\ndiscontinuity. Also, we ask the strength of contact discontinuity not small.\nThe proofs are given by the elementary energy method.\n", "  This work studies the correlation among environmental density and radio AGN\npresence up to $z = 2$. Using data from the photometric COSMOS survey and its\nradio 1.4 GHz follow-up (VLA-COSMOS), a sample of radio AGNs has been defined.\nThe environment was studied using the richness distributions inside a\nparallelepiped with base side of 1 Mpc and height proportional to the\nphotometric redshift precision. Radio AGNs are found to be always located in\nenvironments significantly richer than those around galaxies with no radio\nemission. Moreover, a distinction based on radio AGN power shows that the\nsignificance of the environmental effect is only maintained for low-power radio\nsources. The results of this work show that denser environments play a\nsignificant role in enhancing the probability that a galaxy hosts a radio AGN\nand, in particular, low-power ones.\n", "  We outline a new method to compute the Bayes Factor for model selection which\nbypasses the Bayesian Evidence. Our method combines multiple models into a\nsingle, nested, Supermodel using one or more hyperparameters. Since the models\nare now nested the Bayes Factors between the models can be efficiently computed\nusing the Savage-Dickey Density Ratio (SDDR). In this way model selection\nbecomes a problem of parameter estimation. We consider two ways of constructing\nthe supermodel in detail: one based on combined models, and a second based on\ncombined likelihoods. We report on these two approaches for a Gaussian linear\nmodel for which the Bayesian evidence can be calculated analytically and a toy\nnonlinear problem. Unlike the combined model approach, where a standard Monte\nCarlo Markov Chain (MCMC) struggles, the combined-likelihood approach fares\nmuch better in providing a reliable estimate of the log-Bayes Factor. This\nscheme potentially opens the way to computationally efficient ways to compute\nBayes Factors in high dimensions that exploit the good scaling properties of\nMCMC, as compared to methods such as nested sampling that fail for high\ndimensions.\n", "  We study the dynamics of an online algorithm for learning a sparse leading\neigenvector from samples generated from a spiked covariance model. This\nalgorithm combines the classical Oja's method for online PCA with an\nelement-wise nonlinearity at each iteration to promote sparsity. In the\nhigh-dimensional limit, the joint empirical measure of the underlying sparse\neigenvector and its estimate provided by the algorithm is shown to converge\nweakly to a deterministic, measure-valued process. This scaling limit is\ncharacterized as the unique solution of a nonlinear PDE, and it provides exact\ninformation regarding the asymptotic performance of the algorithm. For example,\nperformance metrics such as the cosine similarity and the misclassification\nrate in sparse support recovery can be obtained by examining the limiting\ndynamics. A steady-state analysis of the nonlinear PDE also reveals an\ninteresting phase transition phenomenon. Although our analysis is asymptotic in\nnature, numerical simulations show that the theoretical predictions are\naccurate for moderate signal dimensions.\n", "  With Einstein's inertial motion (free-falling and non-rotating relative to\ngyroscopes), geodesics for non-relativistic particles can intersect repeatedly,\nallowing one to compute the space-time curvature $R^{\\hat{0} \\hat{0}}$ exactly.\nEinstein's $R^{\\hat{0} \\hat{0}}$ for strong gravitational fields and for\nrelativistic source-matter is identical with the Newtonian expression for the\nrelative radial acceleration of neighboring free-falling test-particles,\nspherically averaged.--- Einstein's field equations follow from Newtonian\nexperiments, local Lorentz-covariance, and energy-momentum conservation\ncombined with the Bianchi identity.\n", "  We describe the phase diagram and thermodynamic properties of a chain of\naxially-tunnel-coupled fractional quantum Hall systems realized by rotating a\nseries of optical dipole traps about their center. We demonstrate not only a\nexperimentally feasible pathway to a state describable as a Mott-insulator of\ncomposite bosons, but also describe the nature of the coherent states at higher\ntunnel coupling strength, and identify a series of new superfluid phases with\nrich behavior. The phase diagram directly reveals not only characteristic\nfeatures of the few-body systems, including the effective mass of composite\nparticle- and hole-like excitations and their interactions, but emergent\nproperties of the chain also reveal a fundamental mapping between the adiabatic\ndynamics of two dimensional systems governed by particle braiding and the\nhydrostatic response of the gas in the conducting phases.\n", "  We present the stellar parameters and elemental abundances of a set of\nA--F-type supergiant stars HD\\,45674, HD\\,180028, HD\\,194951 and HD\\,224893\nusing high resolution ($R$\\,$\\sim$\\,42,000) spectra taken from ELODIE library.\nWe present the first results of the abundance analysis for HD\\,45674 and\nHD\\,224893. We reaffirm the abundances for HD\\,180028 and HD\\,194951 studied\npreviously by Luck (2014) respectively. Alpha-elements indicates that objects\nbelong to the thin disc population. From their abundances and its location on\nthe Hertzsprung-Russell diagram seems point out that HD\\,45675, HD\\,194951 and\nHD\\,224893 are in the post-first dredge-up (post-1DUP) phase and they are\nmoving in the red-blue loop region. HD~180028, on the contary, shows typical\nabundances of the population I but its evolutionary status could not be\nsatisfactorily defined.\n", "  We prove a general theorem that the action of arbitrary classical noise or\nrandom unitary channels can not increase the maximum population of any\neigenstate of an open quantum system, assuming initial system-environment\nfactorization. Such factorization is the conventional starting point for\ndescriptions of open system dynamics. In particular, our theorem implies that a\nsystem can not be ideally cooled down unless it is initially prepared as a pure\nstate. The resultant inequality rigorously constrains the possibility of\ncooling the system solely through temporal manipulation, i.e., dynamical\ncontrol over the system Hamiltonian without resorting to measurement based\ncooling methods.\n", "  The first step to understanding brain function is to determine the brain's\nnetwork structure. We report a three-dimensional analysis of the brain network\nof the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster by synchrotron-radiation tomographic\nmicroscopy. A skeletonized wire model of the left half of the brain network was\nbuilt by tracing the three-dimensional distribution of X-ray absorption\ncoefficients. The obtained models of neuronal processes were classified into\ngroups on the basis of their three-dimensional structures. These classified\ngroups correspond to neuronal tracts that send long-range projections or\nrepeated structures of the optic lobe. The skeletonized model is also composed\nof neuronal processes that could not be classified into the groups. The\ndistribution of these unclassified structures correlates with the distribution\nof contacts between neuronal processes. This suggests that neurons that cannot\nbe classified into typical structures should play important roles in brain\nfunctions. The quantitative description of the brain network provides a basis\nfor structural and statistical analyses of the Drosophila brain. The challenge\nis to establish a methodology for reconstructing the brain network in a\nhigher-resolution image, leading to a comprehensive understanding of the brain\nstructure.\n", "  Progress in high-resolution x-ray microtomography has provided us with a\npractical approach to determining three-dimensional (3D) structures of opaque\nsamples at micrometer to submicrometer resolution. In this review, we give an\nintroduction to hard x-ray microtomography and its application to the\nvisualization of 3D structures of biological soft tissues. Practical aspects of\nsample preparation, handling, data collection, 3D reconstruction, and structure\nanalysis are described. Furthermore, different sample contrasting methods are\napproached in detail. Examples of microtomographic studies are overviewed to\npresent an outline of biological applications of x-ray microtomography. We also\nprovide perspectives of biological microtomography as the convergence of\nsciences in x-ray optics, biology, and structural analysis.\n", "  Spatial resolution is a fundamental parameter in structural sciences. In\ncrystallography, the resolution is determined from the detection limit of\nhigh-angle diffraction in reciprocal space. In electron microscopy, correlation\nin the Fourier domain is used for estimating the resolution. In this paper, we\nreport a method for estimating the spatial resolution of real images from a\nlogarithmic intensity plot in the Fourier domain. The logarithmic intensity\nplots of test images indicated that the full width at half maximum of a\nGaussian point-spread function can be estimated from the images. The spatial\nresolution of imaging X-ray microtomography using Fresnel zone-plate optics was\nalso estimated with this method. A cross section of a test object visualized\nwith the imaging microtomography indicated that square-wave patterns up to\n120-nm pitch were resolved. The logarithmic intensity plot was calculated from\na tomographic cross section of brain tissue. The full width at half maximum of\nthe point spread function estimated from the plot coincided with the resolution\ndetermined from the test object. These results indicated that the logarithmic\nintensity plot in the Fourier domain provides an alternative measure of the\nspatial resolution without explicitly defining a noise criterion.\n", "  The spatial resolution achieved by recent synchrotron radiation\nmicrotomographs should be estimated from the modulation transfer function (MTF)\non the micrometer scale. Step response functions of a synchrotron radiation\nmicrotomograph were determined by the slanted edge method by using\nhigh-precision surfaces of diamond crystal and ion-milled aluminum wire. Tilted\nreconstruction was introduced to enable any edge to be used as the slanted edge\nby defining the reconstruction pixel matrix in an arbitrary orientation. MTFs\nwere estimated from the step response functions of the slanted edges. The\nobtained MTFs coincided with MTF values estimated from square-wave patterns\nmilled on the aluminum surface. Although x-ray refraction influences should be\ntaken into account to evaluate MTFs, any flat surfaces with nanometer roughness\ncan be used to determine the spatial resolutions of microtomographs.\n", "  To estimate the spatial resolution of microtomographs, a test object on the\nsubmicrometer scale was prepared by focused ion beam milling and subjected to\nmicrotomographic analysis. Since human tissues are composed of cells and\nextracellular matrices with micrometer and submicrometer structures, it is\nimportant to investigate the three-dimensional spatial resolution of\nmicrotomographs used to visualize microstructures of human tissues. The\nresolutions along the direction within the tomographic slice plane (in-plane\nresolution) and perpendicular to it (through-plane resolution) were determined\nfrom the modulation transfer function of square-wave patterns. The in-plane\nresolution was estimated to be 1.2 um from the modulation transfer function of\nthe non-zoom image. In contrast, the zoom image gave the in-plane resolution of\n0.8 um. This in-plane resolution is comparable to the through-plane resolution,\nwhich was estimated to be 0.8 um. Although the two-dimensional radiographs were\ntaken with the pixel width of half the x-ray optics resolution, these\nthree-dimensional resolution analyses indicated that the zoom reconstruction\nshould be performed to achieve the in-plane resolution comparable to the x-ray\noptics resolution. The submicrometer three-dimensional analysis was applied in\nthe structural study of human cerebral tissue stained with high-Z elements and\nthe obtained tomograms revealed that the microtomographic analysis allows\nvisualization of the subcellular structures of the cerebral tissue.\n", "  The early strength evolution of self-consolidating concrete (SCC) is studied\nby a set of non-standard mechanical tests for compressive, tensile, shear and\nbending failure. The results are applicable in an industrial environment for\nprocess control, e.g. of slip casting with adaptive molds in robotic\nfabrication. A procedure for collapsing data to a master evolution curve is\npresented that allows to distinguish two regimes in the evolution. In the\nfirst, the material is capable of undergoing large localized plastic\ndeformation, as expected from thixotropic yield stress fluids. This is followed\nby a transition to cohesive frictional material behavior dominated by crack\ngrowth. The typical differences in tensile and compressive strength of hardened\nconcrete are observed to originate at the transition. Finally, the evolution of\na limit surface in principal stress space is constructed and discussed.\n", "  Braun-Le Chatelier principle is a fundamental result of equilibrium\nthermodynamics, showing how stable equilibrium states shift when external\nconditions are varied. The principle follows from convexity of thermodynamic\npotential. Analogously, from convexity of dissipation potential it follows how\nsteady non-equilibrium states shift when thermodynamic forces are varied, which\nis the extension of the principle to dissipative thermodynamics.\n", "  Irradiating a semiconductor with circularly polarized light creates\nspin-polarized charge carriers. If the material contains atoms with non-zero\nnuclear spin, they interact with the electron spins via the hyperfine coupling.\nHere, we consider GaAs/AlGaAs quantum wells, where the conduction-band electron\nspins interact with three different types of nuclear spins. The hyperfine\ninteraction drives a transfer of spin polarization to the nuclear spins, which\ntherefore acquire a polarization that is comparable to that of the electron\nspins. In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of the optical pumping process in\nthe presence of an external magnetic field while irradiating a single quantum\nwell with a circularly polarized laser. We measure the time dependence of the\nphotoluminescence polarization to monitor the buildup of the nuclear spin\npolarization and thus the average hyperfine interaction acting on the electron\nspins. We present a simple model that adequately describes the dynamics of this\nprocess and is in good agreement with the experimental data.\n", "  We emphasize the usefulness of the Lie brackets in the context of classical\nand quantum mechanics. By way of examples we show that many dynamical systems,\nespecially the ones with (gauge) constraints, can equally be treated in their\ntime development with non-canonical variables and Hamiltonians. After a short\npresentation of the Lie bracket algebra and treating some easier standard\nproblems with the Lie bracket techniques, we concentrate mainly on charged\nparticles with gauge constraint in a constant external magnetic field. Since\nmost of our quantum field theories are meanwhile considered effective, we have\npurposely treated our final problems with $c$-number instead of field -operator\nLagrangians. The van Vleck determinant, which is exact for our problems, is\nemployed to calculate the $c$-number Feynman-Schwinger propagation function.\nThere is no need for operators or renormalization. In particular, the\nnon-relativistic propagator in $2+1$ dimensions and the more complicated one in\n$3+1$ dimensions are presented in all their glorious detail. On the more\neditorial side: we have dispensed with numerating the various problems. They\nare not so much disjoint that they needed an extra title. Also, the article is\nwritten in a self-consistent way, meaning one should be able to read it without\ntime-consuming research in textbooks and journals - with a few exceptions, in\nparticular Schwinger's paper [J. Schwinger, Phys. Rev. 82, 664 (1951)], which\nis the most-cited paper in modern quantum-field-theory physics. Most of the\nprerequisites for reading the present article can be found in extenso in [W.\nDittrich and M. Reuter, Classical and quantum dynamics (Springer, Berlin,\nGermany, 2016)].\n", "  Isomeric studies in neutron-rich nuclei present a powerful tool to explore\nthe structure at the nuclear extremes. We recently used the shell model\ncalculations with Renormalized Charge Depen- dent Bonn (RCDB) effective\ninteraction to calculate the properties of the $6^+$ seniority isomers in\n$^{134-138}$Sn in an attempt to resolve the anomalous B(E2) behavior of the\n$6^+$ isomer in $^{136}$Sn [Phys. Rev. C 91, 024321 (2015)]. We further explore\nthese isomers by using the generalized seniority scheme for multi-j orbitals\nrecently presented by us [Phys. Lett. B 753, 122 (2016)]; the B(E2) values so\ncalculated reproduce the experimental data quite well, including the anomaly at\n$^{136}$Sn confirming the generalized seniority nature of the $6^+$ isomers. We\nthen use the generalized seniority guided Large Scale Shell Model (LSSM)\ncalculations, along with the latest single particle energies from Jones et al :\n[Nature (London) 465, 454 (2010)] and Allmond et al : [Phys. Rev. Lett. 112,\n172701 (2014)] to estimate more accurate location of i$_{13/2}$ neutron orbital\nin the extreme neutron rich N = 82-126 region. This entails a new sub-shell\nclosure at N = 112 due to the higher location of i$_{13/2}$ neutron orbital,\nalso consistent with the choice of orbitals in the generalized seniority\nscheme. However, a small reduction in the f$_{7/2}$ two-body matrix elements is\nstill required in the LSSM calculations to reproduce the experimental level\nenergies as well as the transition probabilities in $^{134-138}$Sn isotopes in\na consistent way.\n", "  The Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) formalism is a powerful generalization of the\nBRST approach of gauge theories and allows to treat more general field\ntheories. We will see how, starting from the case of a finite dimensional\nconfiguration space, we can see this formalism as a theory of integration for\npolyvectors over the shifted cotangent bundle of the configuration space, and\narrive at a formula that admits a generalization to the infinite dimensional\ncase. The process of gauge fixing and the observables of the theory will be\npresented.\n", "  Quantum multi-hop teleportation is important in the field of quantum\ncommunication. In this study, we propose a quantum multi-hop communication\nmodel and a quantum routing protocol with multi-hop teleportation for wireless\nmesh backbone networks. Based on an analysis of quantum multi-hop protocols, a\npartially entangled Greenberger--Horne--Zeilinger (GHZ) state is selected as\nthe quantum channel for the proposed protocol. Both quantum and classical\nwireless channels exist between two neighboring nodes along the route. With the\nproposed routing protocol, quantum information can be transmitted hop by hop\nfrom the source node to the destination node. Based on multi-hop teleportation\nbased on the partially entangled GHZ state, a quantum route established with\nthe minimum number of hops. The difference between our routing protocol and the\nclassical one is that in the former, the processes used to find a quantum route\nand establish quantum channel entanglement occur simultaneously. The Bell state\nmeasurement results of each hop are piggybacked to quantum route finding\ninformation. This method reduces the total number of packets and the magnitude\nof air interface delay. The deduction of the establishment of a quantum channel\nbetween source and destination is also presented here. The final success\nprobability of quantum multi-hop teleportation in wireless mesh backbone\nnetworks was simulated and analyzed. Our research shows that quantum multi-hop\nteleportation in wireless mesh backbone networks through a partially entangled\nGHZ state is feasible.\n", "  For frequency $\\alpha$ of bounded type and coupling $\\lambda>20$, we show\nthat the density of states measure $\\NN_{\\alpha,\\lambda}$ of the related Sturm\nHamiltonian is exact upper and lower dimensional, however, in general it is not\nexact-dimensional.\n", "  We define generalizations of the multiple elliptic gamma functions and the\nmultiple sine functions, associated to good rational cones. We explain how good\ncones are related to collections of $SL_r(\\mathbb{Z})$-elements and prove that\nthe generalized multiple sine and multiple elliptic gamma functions enjoy\ninfinite product representations and modular properties determined by the cone.\nThis generalizes the modular properties of the elliptic gamma function studied\nby Felder and Varchenko, and the results about the usual multiple sine and\nelliptic gamma functions found by Narukawa.\n", "  In the current paper, electrical transport properties of 25 nm thick Nb films\nsputtered on the photosensitive semiconductor BiOCl were investigated in the\ntemperature range 7.5 K $\\leq T \\leq$ 8.5 K. The influence of green (532 nm)\nand red (640 nm) laser excitations on resistive superconducting transitions of\nthe niobium thin films on a silicon glass and BiOCl single crystal substrates\nwere studied. The temperature dependences of the resistivity for Nb are in good\nagreement with the McMillan model which indicates the strong influence of the\ninverse proximity effect induced by the interface. The increased influence of\nthe BiOCl/Nb interface under laser excitation corresponds to the raising the\nratio of the density of normal to superconductivity carriers in the\n$T\\rightarrow 0$ limit and this observation is in agreement with the\nphotoconductivity study of BiOCl single crystals.\n", "  In the present review we discuss the past and present status of the\ninteracting OB-type binary frequency. We critically examine the popular idea\nthat Be-stars and supergiant sgB[e] stars are binary evolutionary products. The\neffects of rotation on stellar evolution in general, stellar population studies\nin particular, and the link with binaries will be evaluated. Finally a\ndiscussion is presented of massive double compact star binary mergers as\npossible major sites of chemical enrichment of r-process elements and as the\norigin of recent aLIGO GW events.\n", "  The construction of low mass vertex detectors with a high level of system\nintegration is of great interest for next generation collider experiments.\nRadiation length images with a sufficient spatial resolution can be used to\nmeasure and disentangle complex radiation length $X$/$X_0$ profiles and\ncontribute to the understanding of vertex detector systems. Test beam\nexperiments with multi GeV particle beams and high-resolution tracking\ntelescopes provide an opportunity to obtain precise 2D images of the radiation\nlength of thin planar objects. At the heart of the $X$/$X_0$ imaging is a\nspatially resolved measurement of the scattering angles of particles traversing\nthe object under study. The main challenges are the alignment of the reference\ntelescope and the calibration of its angular resolution. In order to\ndemonstrate the capabilities of $X$/$X_0$ imaging, a test beam experiment has\nbeen conducted. The devices under test were two mechanical prototype modules of\nthe Belle II vertex detector. A data sample of 100 million tracks at $4\\,\n\\mathrm{GeV}$ has been collected, which is sufficient to resolve complex\nmaterial profiles on the $30\\,\\mu$m scale.\n", "  Zonal flows in rapidly-rotating celestial objects such as the Sun, gas or ice\ngiants form in a variety of surface patterns and amplitudes. Whereas the\ndifferential rotation on the Sun, Jupiter and Saturn features a super-rotating\nequatorial region, the ice giants, Neptune and Uranus harbour an equatorial jet\nslower than the planetary rotation. Global numerical models covering the\noptically thick, deep-reaching and rapidly rotating convective envelopes of gas\ngiants reproduce successfully the prograde jet at the equator. In such models,\nconvective columns shaped by the dominant Coriolis force typically exhibit a\nconsistent prograde tilt. Hence angular momentum is pumped away from the\nrotation axis via Reynolds stresses. Those models are found to be strongly\ngeostrophic, hence a modulation of the zonal flow structure along the axis of\nrotation, e.g. introduced by persistent latitudinal temperature gradients,\nseems of minor importance. Within our study we stimulate these thermal\ngradients and the resulting ageostrophic flows by applying an axisymmetric and\nequatorially symmetric outer boundary heat flux anomaly ($Y_{20}$) with\nvariable amplitude and sign. Such a forcing pattern mimics the thermal effect\nof intense solar or stellar irradiation. Our results suggest that the\nageostrophic flows are linearly amplified with the forcing amplitude $q^\\star$\nleading to a more pronounced dimple of the equatorial jet (alike Jupiter). The\ngeostrophic flow contributions, however, are suppressed for weak $q^\\star$, but\ninverted and re-amplified once $q^\\star$ exceeds a critical value. The inverse\ngeostrophic differential rotation is consistently maintained by now also\ninversely tilted columns and reminiscent of zonal flow profiles observed for\nthe ice giants. Analysis of the main force balance and parameter studies\nfurther foster these results.\n", "  We consider simple dark matter extensions of the standard model in $Z^\\prime$\nportal scenarios inspired by grand unification theory constructions and we\nstudy the phenomenology of such models by considering Spin Dependent and Spin\nIndependent direct detection constraints, confronting the canonical thermally\nproduced dark matter scenario and we show that in this simple framework the\ncombination and the complementary of these constraints is a powerful tool to\nderive stringent bounds and to reduce the viable parameter space of the model.\n", "  In this thesis we have analysed the time evolution of the photometric\nprecision achieved by the space-based exoplanet-hunting mission CoRoT during\nits flight phase (2007-2012). This study of the noise level of CoRoT light\ncurves has been based on a previous paper by Aigrain et al. 2009, where they\nfound a gradual degradation of the photometric performance over time for the\nfirst 14 months of data. Here we have analysed the anti-center runs IRa01\n(2007), LRa01 (2008), LRa03 (2010) and LRa06 (2012). The two first runs were\nstudied by Aigrain as well, so we are able to compare our results. The two last\nruns allowed us to evaluate the trend of photometric degradation over more than\n5 years. We obtain low observational point-to-point noise, although a factor 3\nbigger than the source photon noise. We find effects showing the ageing of the\nCoRoT CCDs. On 2h time scales we notice a receding photometric performance,\nwith a noise increase of about 2.1 times across the four analysed runs,\ncorresponding to a 15% increase per year. Correlated noise becomes more\nimportant than white uncorrelated noise for the two last studied runs, LRa03\nand LRa06. The strongest degradation, however, occurs during the first year of\noperations, with a 30% noise increase, opening up a two-ageing-timescales\nscenario.\n", "  In order to meet the theoretically achievable imaging performance,\ncalibration of modern radio interferometers is a mandatory challenge,\nespecially at low frequencies. In this perspective, we propose a novel parallel\niterative multi-wavelength calibration algorithm. The proposed algorithm\nestimates the apparent directions of the calibration sources, the directional\nand undirectional complex gains of the array elements and their noise powers,\nwith a reasonable computational complexity. Furthermore, the algorithm takes\ninto account the specific variation of the aforementioned parameter values\nacross wavelength. Realistic numerical simulations reveal that the proposed\nscheme outperforms the mono-wavelength calibration scheme and approaches the\nderived constrained Cram\\'er-Rao bound even with the presence of\nnon-calibration sources at unknown directions, in a computationally efficient\nmanner.\n", "  I study the interplay between language competition and ideology struggle in a\ncountry where there is a native high-status language and a low-status language\nspoken by immigrants. Language transition is governed by a three-state model\nsimilar to the Minett-Wang (2008) and the Heinsalu et al. (2014) models. I\nintroduce the novelty that, among natives, an ideological struggle exists\nbetween a group of nationalists and a group of pro-immigrants, thus a two-state\nmodel as in Abrams-Strogatz (2003). When bilingualism emerges as an\nequilibrium, there might be a completely segregated society with monolingual\nimmigrants and monolingual nationalistic natives, thus an undesired outcome\ncontrasting with the widespread literature. Removing ideology struggle,\nbilingualism is never stable, thus results in Heinsalu et al. (2014) are solely\ndue to the way conversion rate constants are defined in their model. If\nlanguage status is explicitly defined in the model, bilingualism becomes doomed\nin the long run.\n", "  In this paper, for the CPT-even and CPT-odd extensions of the QED, we\nexplicitly obtain the aether-like corrections for the electromagnetic field in\nthe case when the space-time involves an extra compact spatial dimension\nbesides of usual four dimensions. Our methodology is based on an explicit\nsummation over the Kaluza-Klein tower of fields which is no more difficult than\nthe finite-temperature calculations. The quantum corrections turn out to be\nlarge as the extra dimension is small. We demonstrate that in the CPT-even\ncase, the extra dimension manifests itself through a new scalar particle.\n", "  Spacetime quantization predicts the existence of minimal length and\ntime-interval. Within 5-dimensional Schwarzschild-like black string background,\nthe tunneling of scalar particles, fermions and massive bosons are first\nstudied together in the same generalized uncertainty principle framework. It is\nfound that, the minimal length and time-interval effect weakens the original\nHawking radiation. To $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{M_f^2})$, the corrected\ntemperatures depend on not only the mass of black string, but also the mass and\nangular momentum of emitted particles. The temperature correction for massive\nbosons is four times as big as that for scalar particles and fermions. As a\nresult, the bosons cease to tunnel from the black string before the scalar\nparticles and fermions do. The evaporation remnant is expected in our analysis,\nhowever it should be verified by full quantum gravity theory.\n", "  We present an approach for the calculation of odd-nuclei with exact\nself-consistent blocking and particle number and angular momentum projection\nwith the finite range density dependent Gogny force. As an application we\ncalculate the nucleus $^{31}$Mg at the border of the $N=20$ inversion island.\nWe evaluate the ground state properties, the excited states and the transition\nprobabilities. In general we obtain a good description of the measured\nobservables.\n", "  A nonlinearly generalized Camassa-Holm equation, depending an arbitrary\nnonlinearity power $p \\neq 0$, is considered. This equation reduces to the\nCamassa-Holm equation when $p=1$ and shares one of the Hamiltonian structures\nof the Camassa-Holm equation. Two main results are obtained. A classification\nof point symmetries is presented and a peakon solution is derived, for all\npowers $p \\neq 0$.\n", "  The modern semilocal exchange potential is an accurate and efficient\napproximation to the exact exchange potential of density functional theory. We\ntried to combine it with the dynamical mean-field theory to derive a new\nfirst-principles many-body approach for studying correlated electronic\nmaterials. As a paradigm, this approach was employed to investigate the\nelectronic structures and optical properties of strongly correlated ionic\ninsulator YbS. Compared to the standard density functional theory plus\ndynamical mean-field theory which surprisingly failed to give an insulating\nsolution, the new approach correctly captured all of the important\ncharacteristics of YbS. Not only an energy gap between a fully occupied Yb-4$f$\nstate and an unoccupied conduction band, but also an absence of Drude peak in\nthe optical conductivity $\\sigma(\\omega)$ were successfully reproduced.\n", "  One-photon or two photon absorption by dye molecules in photopolymers enable\ndirect 2D & 3D lithography of micro/nano structures with high spatial\nresolution and can be used effectively in fabricating artificially structured\nnanomaterials. However, the major bottleneck in unleashing the potential of\nthis useful technique is the indispensable usage of dyes that are extremely\nexpensive, highly toxic and usually insoluble in commercially available\nphotopolymers. Here we report a simple, inexpensive and one-step technique for\ndirect-writing of micro/nanostructures, with sub-wavelength resolution at\nextremely high speeds without using any one photon or two photon absorbing dye.\nWe incorporated large amount (20 weight %) of inexpensive photoinitiator into\nthe photopolymer and utilized its two-photon absorbing property for\nsub-wavelength patterning. Complex 2D and 3D patterns were fabricated with\nsub-micron resolution, in commercially available liquid photopolymer to show\nthe impact/versatility of this technique.\n", "  Localized polymerization in subwavelength volumes using two photon dyes has\nnow become a well-established method for fabrication of subwavelength\nstructures. Unfortunately, the two photon absorption dyes used in such process\nare not only expensive but also proprietary. LTPO-L is an inexpensive, easily\navailable single photon photoinitiator and has been used extensively for single\nphoton absorption of UV light for polymerization. These polymerization volumes\nhowever are not localized and extend to micron size resolution having limited\napplications. We have exploited high quantum yield of radicals of LTPO-Lfor\nabsorption of two photons to achieve localized polymerization in subwavelength\nvolumes, much below the diffraction limit. Critical concentration (10wt%) of\nLTPO-Lin acrylate (Sartomer) was found optimal to achieve subwavelength\nlocalized polymerization and has been demonstrated by fabricating 2D/3D complex\nnanostructures and functional devices such as variable polymeric gratings with\nnanoscaled subwavelength resolution. Systematic studies on influence of LTPO-L\nconcentration on two photon polymerization of commercially available\nphotopolymer (Sartomer) show that resolution of the fabricated structures\ncritically depend on loading of LPTO-L. This is expected to unleash the true\npotential of two photon polymerization for fabrication of complex polymeric\nnanodevices at a larger scale.\n", "  Almost all processes -- highly correlated, weakly correlated, or correlated\nnot at all---exhibit statistical fluctuations. Often physical laws, such as the\nSecond Law of Thermodynamics, address only typical realizations -- as\nhighlighted by Shannon's asymptotic equipartition property and as entailed by\ntaking the thermodynamic limit of an infinite number of degrees of freedom.\nIndeed, our interpretations of the functioning of macroscopic thermodynamic\ncycles are so focused. Using a recently derived Second Law for information\nprocessing, we show that different subsets of fluctuations lead to distinct\nthermodynamic functioning in Maxwellian Demons. For example, while typical\nrealizations may operate as an engine -- converting thermal fluctuations to\nuseful work -- even \"nearby\" fluctuations (nontypical, but probable\nrealizations) behave differently, as Landauer erasers -- converting available\nstored energy to dissipate stored information. One concludes that ascribing a\nsingle, unique functional modality to a thermodynamic system, especially one on\nthe nanoscale, is at best misleading, likely masking an array of simultaneous,\nparallel thermodynamic transformations. This alters how we conceive of cellular\nprocesses, engineering design, and evolutionary adaptation.\n", "  Neuromorphic chip refers to an unconventional computing architecture that is\nmodelled on biological brains. It is ideally suited for processing sensory data\nfor intelligence computing, decision-making or context cognition. Despite rapid\ndevelopment, conventional artificial synapses exhibit poor connection\nflexibility and require separate data acquisition circuitry, resulting in\nlimited functionalities and significant hardware redundancy. Here we report a\nnovel light-stimulated artificial synapse based on a graphene-nanotube hybrid\nphototransistor that can directly convert optical stimuli into a \"neural image\"\nfor further neuronal analysis. Our optically-driven synapses involve multiple\nsteps of plasticity mechanisms and importantly exhibit flexible tuning of both\nshort- and long-term plasticity. Furthermore, our neuromorphic phototransistor\ncan take multiple pre-synaptic light stimuli via wavelength-division\nmultiplexing and allows advanced optical processing through\ncharge-trap-mediated optical coupling. The capability of complex neuromorphic\nfunctionalities in a simple silicon-compatible device paves the way for novel\nneuromorphic computing architectures involving photonics.\n"]}
