In such a framework we introduce the notion of\nF-manifold with compatible connection generalizing a structure introduced by\nManin.\n", "  The CMS Collaboration has released the results of its search for\nsupersymmetry, by applying an alphaT method to 1.1/fb of data at 7 TeV. The\nnull result excludes (at 95% CL) a low-mass region of the Constrained MSSM's\nparameter space that was previously favored by other experiments. Additionally,\nthe negative result of the XENON100 dark matter search has excluded (at 90% CL)\nvalues of the spin-independent scattering cross sections sigma^SI_p as low as\n10^-8 pb. We incorporate these improved experimental constraints into a global\nBayesian fit of the Constrained MSSM by constructing approximate likelihood\nfunctions. In the case of the alphaT limit, we simulate detector efficiency for\nthe CMS alphaT 1.1/fb and validate our method against the official 95% CL\ncontour. We identify the 68% and 95% credible posterior regions of the CMSSM\nparameters, and also find the best-fit point. We find that the credible regions\nchange considerably once a likelihood from alphaT is included, in particular\nthe narrow light Higgs resonance region becomes excluded, but the focus\npoint/horizontal branch region remains allowed at the 1sigma level. Adding the\nlimit from XENON100 has a weaker additional effect, in part due to large\nuncertainties in evaluating sigma^SI_p, which we include in a conservative way,\nalthough we find that it reduces the posterior probability of the focus point\nregion to the 2sigma level. The new regions of high posterior favor squarks\nlighter than the gluino and all but one Higgs bosons heavy. The dark matter\nneutralino mass is found in the range 250 GeV <~ m_Chi1 <~ 343 GeV (at 1sigma)\nwhile, as the result of improved limits from the LHC, the favored range of\nsigma^SI_p is pushed down to values below 10^{-9} pb. We highlight tension\nbetween (g-2)_mu and BR(b->sg), which is exacerbated by including the alphaT\nlimit; each constraint favors a different region of the CMSSM's mass\nparameters.\n", "  We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of correlations in quantum lattice\nmodels in the presence of long-range interactions decaying asymptotically as a\npower law. For exponents larger than the lattice dimensionality, a\nLieb-Robinson-type bound effectively restricts the spreading of correlations to\na causal region, but allows supersonic propagation. We show that this decay is\nnot only sufficient but also necessary. Using tools of quantum metrology, for\nany exponents smaller than the lattice dimension, we construct Hamiltonians\ngiving rise to quantum channels with capacities not restricted to a causal\nregion. An analytical analysis of long-range Ising models illustrates the\ndisappearance of the causal region and the creation of correlations becoming\ndistance-independent. Numerical results obtained using matrix product state\nmethods for the XXZ spin chain reveal the presence of a sound cone for large\nexponents, and supersonic propagation for small ones. In all models we analyzed\nthe fast spreading of correlations follows a power law, but not the exponential\nincrease of the long-range Lieb-Robinson bound.\n", "  Domain wall theory (DWT) has proved to be a powerful tool for the analysis of\none-dimensional transport processes. A simple version of it was found very\naccurate for the Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (TASEP) with\nrandom sequential update. However, a general implementation of DWT is still\nmissing in the case of updates with less fluctuations, which are often more\nrelevant for applications. Here we develop an exact DWT for TASEP with parallel\nupdate and deterministic (p=1) bulk motion. Remarkably, the dynamics of this\nsystem can be described by the motion of a domain wall not only on the\ncoarse-grained level but also exactly on the microscopic scale for arbitrary\nsystem size. All properties of this TASEP, time-dependent and stationary, are\nshown to follow from the solution of a bivariate master equation whose\nvariables are not only the position but also the velocity of the domain wall.\nIn the continuum limit this exactly soluble model then allows us to perform a\nfirst principle derivation of a Fokker-Planck equation for the position of the\nwall. The diffusion constant appearing in this equation differs from the one\nobtained with the traditional `simple' DWT.\n", "  The Higgs data analyzed by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations suggest that the\nscalar state discovered in 2012 is a Standard Model (SM)--like Higgs boson.\nNevertheless, there is still significant room for Higgs physics beyond the\nStandard Model. Many approaches to electroweak symmetry breaking possess a\ndecoupling limit in which the properties of the lightest CP-even Higgs scalar\napproach those of the SM Higgs boson. In some cases, an apparent SM-like Higgs\nsignal can also arise in a regime that may not be governed by the decoupling\nlimit. One such scenario can be realized if the observed Higgs signal is a\nresult of two unresolved nearly-mass-degenerate scalar states. The general\ntwo-Higgs doublet model provides a useful framework for studying the decoupling\nlimit and possible departures from SM-like Higgs behavior. The implications for\ncurrent and future Higgs data are briefly considered.\n", "  Discussions are underway for a high-energy proton-proton collider. Two\npreliminary ideas are the $\\sqrt{s}=33$ TeV HE-LHC and the $\\sqrt{s}=100$ TeV\nVLHC. With Bayesian statistics, we calculate the probabilities that the LHC,\nHE-LHC and VLHC discover SUSY in the future, assuming that nature is described\nby the CMSSM and given the experimental data from the LHC, LUX and Planck. We\nfind that the LHC with $300$/fb at $\\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV has a $15$-$75%$\nprobability of discovering SUSY. Should that run fail to discover SUSY, the\nprobability of discovering SUSY with $3000$/fb is merely $1$-$10%$. Were SUSY\nto remain undetected at the LHC, the HE-LHC would have a $35$-$85%$ probability\nof discovering SUSY with $3000$/fb. The VLHC, on the other hand, ought to be\ndefinitive; the probability of it discovering SUSY, assuming that the CMSSM is\nthe correct model, is $100%$.\n", "  Magnetocrystalline anisotropy at Heusler alloy$|$MgO interfaces have been\nstudied using first principles calculations. It is found that Co terminated\nCo$_{2}$FeAl$|$MgO interfaces show perpendicular magnetic anisotropy up to 1.31\nmJ/m$^2$, while those with FeAl termination exhibit in-plane magnetic\nanisotropy. Atomic layer resolved analysis indicates that the origin of\nperpendicular magnetic anisotropy in Co$_{2}$FeAl$|$MgO interfaces can be\nattributed to the out-of-plane orbital contributions of interfacial Co atoms.\nAt the same time, Co$_{2}$MnGe and Co$_{2}$MnSi interfaced with MgO tend to\nfavor in-plane magnetic anisotropy for all terminations.\n", "  At the intersection of two unidirectional traffic flows a stripe formation\ninstability is known to occur. In this paper we consider coupled time evolution\nequations for the densities of the two flows in their intersection area. We\nshow analytically how the instability arises from the randomness of the traffic\nentering the area. The Green function of the linearized equations is shown to\nform a Gaussian wave packet whose oscillations correspond to the stripes.\nExplicit formulas are obtained for various characteristic quantities in terms\nof the traffic density and comparison is made with the much simpler calculation\non a torus and with numerical solution of the evolution equations.\n", "  With Bayesian statistics, we investigate the full parameter space of the\nconstrained \"next-to-minimal\" supersymmetric Standard Model (CNMSSM) with\nnaturalness priors, which were derived in a previous work. In the past, most\nBayesian analyses of the CNMSSM ignored naturalness of the electroweak (EW)\nscale by making prejudicial assumptions for parameters defined at the EW scale.\nWe test the CNMSSM against the CMSSM with Bayesian evidence, which, with\nnaturalness priors, incorporates a penalty for fine-tuning of the EW scale.\nWith the evidence, we measure credibility with respect to all measurements,\nincluding the EW scale and LHC direct searches. We find that the evidence in\nfavor of the CNMSSM versus the CMSSM is \"positive\" to \"strong\" but that if one\nignores the $\\mu$-problem, the evidence is \"barely worth mentioning\" to\n\"positive.\" The $\\mu$-problem significantly influences our findings. Unless one\nconsiders the $\\mu$-problem, the evidence in favor of the CNMSSM versus the\nCMSSM is at best \"positive,\" which is two grades below \"very strong.\" We,\nfurthermore, identify the most probable regions of the CMSSM and CNMSSM\nparameter spaces and examine prospects for future discovery at hadron\ncolliders.\n", "  Motivated by a hint in a CMS search for right-handed $W$-bosons in $eejj$\nfinal states, we propose an experimental test of quark-mixing matrices in a\ngeneral left-right symmetric model, based on counting the numbers of $b$-tags\nfrom right-handed $W$-boson hadronic decays. We find that, with our test,\ndifferences between left- and right-handed quark-mixing matrices could be\ndetected at the LHC with $\\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV. With an integrated luminosity of\nabout $20/\\textrm{fb}$, our test is sensitive to right-handed quark-mixing\nangles as small as about $30^\\circ$ and with $3000/\\textrm{fb}$, our test's\nsensitivity improves to right-handed mixing angles as small as about\n$7.5^\\circ$. Our test's sensitivity might be further enhanced by tuning\n$b$-tagging efficiency against purity.\n", "  An arbitrary Lagrangian--Eulerian (ALE) finite element scheme for\ncomputations of soluble surfactant droplet impingement on a horizontal surface\nis presented. The numerical scheme solves the time-dependent Navier--Stokes\nequations for the fluid flow, scalar convection-diffusion equation for the\nsurfactant transport in the bulk phase, and simultaneously, surface evolution\nequations for the surfactants on the free surface and on the liquid-solid\ninterface. The effects of surfactants on the flow dynamics are included into\nthe model through the surfactant-dependent surface tension and dynamic contact\nangle. In particular, the dynamic contact angle $(\\theta_d)$ of the droplet is\ndefined in terms of the surfactant concentration at the contact line and the\nequilibrium contact angle $(\\theta_e^0)$ of the clean surface using the\nnonlinear equation of state for surface tension. Further, the surface forces\nare included in the model as the surface divergence of the surface stress\ntensor that allows to incorporate the Marangoni effects without calculating the\nsurface gradient of the surfactant concentration on the free surface. In\naddition to a mesh convergence study and validation of the numerical results\nwith experiments, the effects of adsorption and desorption surfactant\ncoefficients on the flow dynamics in wetting, partially wetting and non-wetting\ndroplets are studied in detail. It is observed that the effect of surfactants\nare more in wetting droplets than in the non-wetting droplets. Further, the\npresence of surfactants at the contact line reduces the equilibrium contact\nangle further when $ \\theta_e^0 $ is less than $90^\\circ$, and increases it\nfurther when $ \\theta_e^0 $ is greater than $90^\\circ$. The presence of\nsurfactants has no effect on the contact angle, when $\\theta_e^0 =90^\\circ$.\nThe numerical study clearly demonstrates that the surfactant-dependent contact\nangle ...\n", "  Preparing topological states of quantum matter, such as edge states, is one\nof the most important directions in condensed matter physics. In this work, we\npresent a proposal to prepare edge states in\nAubry-Andr$\\acute{\\textrm{e}}$-Harper (AAH) model with open boundaries, which\ntakes advantage of Lyapunov control to design operations. We show that edge\nstates can be obtained with almost arbitrary initial states. A numerical\noptimalization for the control is performed and the dependence of control\nprocess on the system size is discussed. The merit of this proposal is that the\nshaking exerts only on the boundaries of the model. As a by-product, a\ntopological entangled state is achieved by elaborately designing the shaking\nscheme.\n", "  Encouraged by a hint in a search for right-handed $W$ bosons at the LHC, we\ninvestigate whether the unitarity of a right-handed quark mixing matrix and the\nequality of the left- and right-handed quark mixing matrices could be tested at\nthe LHC. We propose a particular test, involving counting the numbers of\n$b$-tags in the final state, and simulate the test at the event level with\nMonte-Carlo tools for the forthcoming $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV LHC run. We find that\ntesting unitarity with 20/fb will be challenging; our test successfully rejects\nunitarity if the right-handed quark mixing matrix is non-unitary, but only in\nparticular cases. On the other hand, our test may provide the first opportunity\nto test the unitarity of a right-handed quark mixing matrix and with 3000/fb\nseverely constrains possible departures from unitarity in the latter. We refine\nour previous work, testing the equality of quark mixing matrices, with full\ncollider simulation. With 20/fb, we are sensitive to mixing angles as small as\n$30^\\circ$, and with 3000/fb, angles as small as $7.5^\\circ$, confirming our\npreliminary analysis. We briefly investigate testing the unitarity of the SM\nCKM matrix with a similar method by studying semileptonic $t\\bar t$ production,\nconcluding that systematics make it particularly difficult.\n", "  In this note, we consider the implications of the Heisenberg uncertainty\nprinciple (HUP) when computing uncertainties that affect the main dynamical\nquantities, from the perspective of special relativity. Using the well-known\nformula for propagating statistical errors, we prove that the uncertainty\nrelations between the moduli of conjugate observables are not relativistically\ninvariant. The new relationships show that, in experiments involving\nrelativistic particles, limitations of the precision of a quantity obtained by\nindirect calculations may affect the final result.\n", "  We find a method to rewrite the equations of motion of scalar fields,\ngeneralized DBI field and quintessence, in the autonomous form\nfor\\emph{arbitrary} scalar potentials. With the aid of this method, we explore\nthe cosmic evolution of generalized DBI field and quintessence with the\npotential of multiple vacua. Then we find that the scalars are always frozen in\nthe false or true vacuum in the end. Compared to the evolution of quintessence,\nthe generalized DBI field has more times of oscillations around the vacuum of\nthe potential. The reason for this point is that, with the increasing of speed\n$\\dot{\\phi}$, the friction term of generalized DBI field is greatly decreased.\nThus the generalized DBI field acquires more times of oscillations.\n", "  A mesh-dependent relation for the slip number in the Navier-slip with\nfriction boundary condition for computations of impinging droplets with sharp\ninterface methods is proposed. The relation is obtained as a function of\nReynolds number, Weber number and the mesh size. The proposed relation is\nvalidated for several test cases by comparing the numerically obtained wetting\ndiameter with the experimental results. Further, the computationally obtained\nmaximum wetting diameter using the proposed slip relation is verified with the\ntheoretical predictions. The relative error between the computationally\nobtained maximum wetting diameter and the theoretical predictions is less than\n10 % for impinging droplet on a hydrophilic surface, and the error increases in\nthe case of hydrophobic surface.\n", "  We analyze the properties of a Raman quantum light-atom interface in long\natomic ensemble and its applications as a quantum memory or two-mode squeezed\nstate generator. We consider the weak-coupling regime and include both Stokes\nand anti-Stokes scattering and the effects of Doppler broadening in buffer gas\nassuming frequent velocity-averaging collisions. We find the Green functions\ndescribing multimode transformation from input to output fields of photons and\natomic excitations. Proper mode basis is found via singular value decomposition\nfor short interaction times. It reveals that triples of modes are coupled by a\ntransformation equivalent to a combination of two beamsplitters and a two-mode\nsqueezing operation. We analyze the possible transformations on an example of\nwarm rubidium-87 vapor. The model we present bridges the gap between the Stokes\nonly and anti-Stokes only interactions providing simple, universal description\nin a temporally and longitudinally multimode situation. Our results also\nprovide an easy way to find an evolution of the states in a Schr\\\"odinger\npicture thus facilitating understanding and design.\n", "  Topological quantum computation has been extensively studied due to its\nrobustness against decoherence. A conventional way to realize it is by\nadiabatic operations---it requires relatively long time to accomplish so that\nthe speed of quantum computation slows down. In this work, we present a method\nto realize topological quantum computation by periodic driving. Compared to the\nadiabatic evolution, the total operation time can be regulated arbitrarily by\nthe amplitude and frequency of the periodic driving. For the sinusoidal\ndriving, we give an expression for the total operation time in the\nhigh-frequency limit. For the square wave driving, we derive an exact\nanalytical expression for the evolution operator without any approximations,\nand show that the amplitude and frequency of driving field depend on its period\nand total operation time. This could provide a new direction in regulations of\nthe operation time in topological quantum computation.\n", "  Secure communication based on message encryption might be performed by\ncombining the message with controlled noise (called pseudo-noise) as performed\nin Spread-Spectrum communication used presently in Wi-Fi and Smartphone\nTelecommunication systems. Quantum communication based on entanglement is\nanother route for securing communications as demonstrated by several important\nexperiments described in this work. The central role played by the photon in\nunifying the description of Classical and Quantum noise as major ingredients of\nsecure communication systems is highlighted and described on the basis of the\nclassical and quantum fluctuation dissipation theorems.\n", "  We consider solid state phase transformations that are caused by free energy\ndensities with domains of non-convexity in strain-composition space; we refer\nto the non-convex domains as mechano-chemical spinodals. The non-convexity with\nrespect to composition and strain causes segregation into phases with different\ncrystal structures. We work on an existing model that couples the classical\nCahn-Hilliard model with Toupin's theory of gradient elasticity at finite\nstrains. Both systems are represented by fourth-order, nonlinear, partial\ndifferential equations. The goal of this work is to develop unconditionally\nstable, second-order accurate time-integration schemes, motivated by the need\nto carry out large scale computations of dynamically evolving microstructures\nin three dimensions. We also introduce reduced formulations naturally derived\nfrom these proposed schemes for faster computations that are still second-order\naccurate. Although our method is developed and analyzed here for a specific\nclass of mechano-chemical problems, one can readily apply the same method to\ndevelop unconditionally stable, second-order accurate schemes for any problems\nfor which free energy density functions are multivariate polynomials of\nsolution components and component gradients. Apart from an analysis and\nconstruction of methods, we present a suite of numerical results that\ndemonstrate the schemes in action.\n", "  General relativity (GR) is the current description of gravity in modern\nphysics. One of the cornerstones of GR, as well as Newton's theory of gravity,\nis the weak equivalence principle (WEP), stating that the trajectory of a\nfreely falling test body is independent of its internal structure and\ncomposition. WEP is known to be valid for the normal matter with a high\nprecision. However, due to the rarity of antimatter and weakness of the\ngravitational forces, the WEP has never been confirmed for antimatter. The\ncurrent direct bounds on the ratio between the gravitational and inertial\nmasses of the antihydrogen do not rule out a repulsive nature for the\nantimatter gravity. Here we establish an indirect bound of 0.13% on the\ndifference between the gravitational and inertial masses of the positron\n(antielectron) from the analysis of synchrotron losses at the Large\nElectron-Positron collider (LEP). This serves as a confirmation of the\nconventional gravitational properties of antimatter without common assumptions\nsuch as, e.g., coupling of gravity to virtual particles, dynamics of distant\nastrophysical sources and the nature of absolute gravitational potentials.\n", "  Plasmon-enhanced Raman scattering can push single-molecule vibrational\nspectroscopy beyond a regime addressable by classical electrodynamics. We\nemploy a quantum electrodynamics (QED) description of the coherent interaction\nof plasmons and molecular vibrations that reveal the emergence of\nnonlinearities in the inelastic response of the system. For realistic\nsituations, we predict the onset of \\textit{phonon-stimulated Raman scattering}\nand an counter-intuitive dependence of the anti-Stokes emission on the\nfrequency of excitation. We further show that this novel QED framework opens a\nvenue to analyze the correlations of photons emitted at a plasmonic cavity\n", "  In this paper, we consider a spherical symmetric metric to extract the\nhydrostatic equilibrium equation of stars in $(3+1)-$dimensional gravity's\nrainbow in the presence of cosmological constant. Then, we generalize the\nhydrostatic equilibrium equation to $d$-dimensions and obtain the hydrostatic\nequilibrium equation for this gravity. Also, we obtain the maximum mass of\nneutron star using the modern equations of state of neutron star matter derived\nfrom the microscopic calculations. It is notable that, in this paper, we\nconsider the effects of rainbow functions on the diagrams related to the\nmass-central mass density ($M$-$\\rho _{c}$) relation and also the mass-radius\n($M$-$R$) relation of neutron star. We also study the effects of rainbow\nfunctions on the other properties of neutron star such as the Schwarzschild\nradius, average density, strength of gravity and gravitational redshift. Then,\nwe apply the cosmological constant to this theory to obtain the diagrams of\n$M$-$\\rho _{c}$ (or $M$-$R$) and other properties of these stars. Next, we\ninvestigate the dynamical stability condition for these stars in gravity's\nrainbow and show that these stars have dynamical stability. We also obtain a\nrelation between mass of neutron stars and Planck mass. In addition, we compare\nobtained results of this theory with the observational data.\n", "  We study the collective excitations in a relativistic fluid with an anomalous\n$U(1)$ current. In $3+1$ dimensions at zero chemical potential, in addition to\nordinary sound modes we find two propagating modes in presence of an external\nmagnetic field. The first one which is a transverse degenerate mode, propagates\nwith a velocity proportional to the coefficient of gravitational anomaly; this\nis in fact the Chiral Alfv\\'en wave recently found in \\cite{Yamamoto:2015ria}.\nAnother one is a wave of density perturbation, namely a chiral magnetic wave\n(CMW). The velocity dependence of CMW on the chiral anomaly coefficient is well\nknown. We compute the dependence of CMW's velocity on the coefficient of\ngravitational anomaly as well. We also show that the dissipation splits the\ndegeneracy of CAW. At finite chiral charge density we show that in general\nthere may exist five chiral hydrodynamic waves. Of these five waves, one is the\nCMW while the other four are mixed Modified Sound-Alfv\\'en waves. It turns out\nthat in propagation transverse to the magnetic field no anomaly effect appear\nwhile in parallel to the magnetic field we find sound waves become dispersive\ndue to anomaly.\n", "  The idea of a collective intelligence behind the complex natural structures\nbuilt by organisms suggests that the organization of social networks is\nselected so as to optimize problem-solving competence at the group-level. Here\nwe study the influence of the social network topology on the performance of a\ngroup of agents whose task is to locate the global maxima of NK fitness\nlandscapes. Agents cooperate by broadcasting messages informing on their\nfitness and use this information to imitate the fittest agent in their\ninfluence networks. In the case those messages convey accurate information on\nthe proximity of the solution (i.e., for smooth fitness landscapes) we find\nthat high connectivity as well as centralization boost the group performance.\nFor rugged landscapes, however, these characteristics are beneficial for small\ngroups only. For large groups, it is advantageous to slow down the information\ntransmission through the network to avoid local maximum traps. Long-range links\nand modularity have marginal effects on the performance of the group, except\nfor a very narrow region of the model parameters.\n", "  A cylindrical elastomer tube can stay in an everted state without any applied\nexternal forces. If the thickness of the tube is small, the everted tube,\nexcept for the regions close to the two ends of the tube, is cylindrical, if\nthe thickness is larger than a critical value, the cross-section of the everted\ntube becomes noncircular, which is due to mechanical instability. Although the\neversion-induced mechanical instability in an elastomer tube has been reported\nseveral decades ago, a satisfying explanation of the phenomenon is still\nunavailable. In all previous studies, linear stability analyses have been\ncommonly adopted to predict the critical thickness of the tube for the\neversion-induced instability. The discrepancy between the prediction and\nexperiment is significant and well known. In this letter, based on the\nexperiments and theoretical analyses, we show that crease formation on the\ninner surface of an everted tube is the mechanical instability mode, which\ncannot be captured by linear stability analyses. Instead, a combination of\nenergetic analyses and numerical simulation of highly nonlinear deformation\nenables us to correctly predict both the critical thickness of the tube for the\nonset of creases and the profile of the cross-section of an everted tube with\nmultiple creases on its inner surface.\n", "  We explain the measure problem (cf. origin of the Born probability rule) in\nno-collapse quantum mechanics. Everett defined maverick branches of the state\nvector as those on which the usual Born probability rule fails to hold -- these\nbranches exhibit highly improbable behaviors, including possibly the breakdown\nof decoherence or even the absence of an emergent semi-classical reality.\nDerivations of the Born rule which originate in decision theory or subjective\nprobability (i.e., the reasoning of individual observers) do not resolve this\nproblem, because they are circular: they assume, a priori, that the observer\noccupies a non-maverick branch. An ab initio probability measure is sometimes\nassumed to explain why we do not occupy a maverick branch. This measure is\nconstrained by, e.g., Gleason's Theorem or envariance to be the usual Hilbert\nmeasure. However, this ab initio measure ultimately governs the allocation of a\nself or a consciousness to a particular branch of the wavefunction, and hence\ninvokes primitives which lie beyond the Everett wavefunction and beyond what we\nusually think of as physics. The significance of this leap has been largely\noverlooked, but requires serious scrutiny.\n", "  We study the zero-temperature phase diagram of a spin-orbit-coupled\nBose-Einstein condensate of spin $1$, with equally weighted Rashba and\nDresselhaus couplings. Depending on the antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic\nnature of the interactions, we find three kinds of striped phases with\nqualitatively different behaviors in the modulations of the density profiles.\nPhase transitions to the zero-momentum and the plane-wave phases can be induced\nin experiments by independently varying the Raman coupling strength and the\nquadratic Zeeman field. The properties of these transitions are investigated in\ndetail, and the emergence of tricritical points, which are the direct\nconsequence of the spin-dependent interactions, is explicitly discussed.\n", "  We are considering the class of heterotic $\\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ Landau-Ginzburg\norbifolds with 9 fields corresponding to $A_1^9$ Gepner models. We classify all\nof its Abelian discrete quotients and obtain 152 inequivalent models closed\nunder mirror symmetry with $\\mathcal{N}=1,2$ and $4$ supersymmetry in 4D. We\ncompute the full massless matter spectrum at the Fermat locus and find a\nuniversal relation satisfied by all models. In addition we give prescriptions\nof how to compute all quantum numbers of the 4D states including their discrete\nR-symmetries. Using mirror symmetry of rigid geometries we describe orbifold\nand smooth Calabi-Yau phases as deformations away from the Landau-Ginzburg\nFermat locus in two explicit examples. We match the non-Fermat deformations to\nthe 4D Higgs mechanism and study the conservation of R-symmetries. The first\nexample is a $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ orbifold on an E$_6$ lattice where the R-symmetry\nis preserved. Due to a permutation symmetry of blow-up and torus K\\\"{a}hler\nparameters the R-symmetry stays conserved also smooth Calabi-Yau phase. In the\nsecond example the R-symmetry gets broken once we deform to the geometric\n$\\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{3,\\text{free}}$ orbifold regime.\n", "  Surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) in nanoscale hotspots has been\nplaced great hopes upon for identification of minimum chemical traces and\nin-situ investigation of single molecule structures and dynamics. However,\nprevious work consists of either irreproducible enhancement factors (EF) from\nrandom aggregates, or moderate EFs despite better reproducibility.\nConsequently, systematic study of SERS at the single and few molecules level is\nstill very limited, and the promised applications are far from being realized.\nHere we report EFs as high as the most intense hotspots in previous work yet\nachieved in a reproducible and well controlled manner, that is, electromagnetic\nEFs (EMEF) of 10^9~10 with an error down to 10^+/-0.08 from gold nanospheres on\natomically flat gold planes under radially polarized (RP) laser excitation. In\naddition, our experiment reveals the EF's unexpected nonlinearity under as low\nas hundreds of nanowatts of laser power.\n", "  We consider generic linear perturbations of a nonbidiagonal class of static\nblack-hole solutions in massive (bi)gravity. We show that the quasinormal\nspectrum of these solutions coincides with that of a Schwarzschild black hole\nin general relativity, thus proving that these solutions are mode stable. This\nis in contrast to the case of bidiagonal black-hole solutions which are\naffected by a radial instability. On the other hand, the full set of\nperturbation equations is generically richer than that of a Schwarzschild black\nhole in general relativity, and this affects the linear response of the black\nhole to external perturbations. Finally, we argue that the generalization of\nthese solutions to the spinning case does not suffer from the superradiant\ninstability, despite the fact that the theory describes a massive graviton.\n", "  Systems that exhibit complex behaviours are often found in a particular\ndynamical condition, poised between order and disorder. This observation is at\nthe core of the so-called criticality hypothesis, which states that systems in\na dynamical regime between order and disorder attain the highest level of\ncomputational capabilities and achieve an optimal trade-off between robustness\nand flexibility. Recent results in cellular and evolutionary biology,\nneuroscience and computer science have revitalised the interest in the\ncriticality hypothesis, emphasising its role as a viable candidate general law\nin adaptive complex systems. In this paper we provide an overview of the works\non dynamical criticality that are -to the best of our knowledge- particularly\nrelevant for the criticality hypothesis. We review the main contributions\nconcerning dynamics and information processing at the edge of chaos, and we\nillustrate the main achievements in the study of critical dynamics in\nbiological systems. Finally, we discuss open questions and propose an agenda\nfor future work.\n", "  We propose a three-dimensional micromagnetic model that dynamically solves\nthe Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation coupled to the full spin-diffusion\nequation. In contrast to previous methods, we solve for the magnetization\ndynamics and the electric potential in a self-consistent fashion. This\ntreatment allows for an accurate description of magnetization dependent\nresistance changes. Moreover, the presented algorithm describes both spin\naccumulation due to smooth magnetization transitions and due to material\ninterfaces as in multilayer structures. The model and its finite-element\nimplementation are validated by current driven motion of a magnetic vortex\nstructure. In a second experiment, the resistivity of a magnetic multilayer\nstructure in dependence of the tilting angle of the magnetization in the\ndifferent layers is investigated. Both examples show good agreement with\nreference simulations and experiments respectively.\n", "  It is shown that a generic form of an antiferromagnetic wave function opens\nstrong electron-phonon coupling channels in the iron-based superconductors. In\nthe nonmagnetic state these channels exist locally on a single iron atom, but\nare canceled out between the two iron atoms in the primitive unit cell. Our\nfindings are based on symmetry and the presence of an xz/yz Fermi surface near\nthe M point and thus should be relevant for the known iron-based pnictide or\nchalcogenide superconductors.\n", "  We study the boundary conditions in the topologically twisted Chern-Simons\nmatter theories with the Lie 3-algebraic structure. We find that the\nsupersymmetric boundary conditions and the gauge invariant boundary conditions\ncan be unified as the complexified gauge invariant boundary conditions which\nlead to the supergroup WZW models. We propose that the low-energy effective\nfield theories on the two-dimensional intersection of multiple M2-branes on a\nholomorphic curve inside K3 with two non-parallel M5-branes on the K3 are\nsupergroup WZW models from the topologically twisted BLG-model and the\nABJM-model.\n", "  By means of low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, we report on the\nelectronic structures of BiO and SrO planes of Bi2Sr2CuO6+{\\delta} (Bi-2201)\nsuperconductor prepared by argon-ion bombardment and annealing. Depending on\npost annealing conditions, the BiO planes exhibit either pseudogap (PG) with\nsharp coherence peaks and an anomalously large gap of 49 meV or van Hove\nsingularity (VHS) near the Fermi level, while the SrO is always characteristic\nof a PG-like feature. This contrasts with Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\\delta} (Bi-2212)\nsuperconductor where VHS occurs solely on the SrO plane. We disclose the\ninterstitial oxygen dopants ({\\delta} in the formulas) as a primary cause for\nthe occurrence of VHS, which are located dominantly around the BiO and SrO\nplanes, respectively, in Bi-2201 and Bi-2212. This is supported by the\ncontrasting structural buckling amplitude of BiO and SrO planes in the two\nsuperconductors. Our findings provide solid evidence for the irrelevance of PG\nto the superconductivity in the two superconductors, as well as insights into\nwhy Bi-2212 can achieve a higher superconducting transition temperature than\nBi-2201, and by implication, the mechanism of cuprate superconductivity.\n", "  We present a conceptual approach to quantum tomography based on first\nexpanding a quantum state across extra degrees of freedom and then exploiting\nthe introduced sparsity to perform reconstruction. We formulate its application\nto photonic circuits, and show that measured spatial photon correlations at the\noutput of a specially tailored discrete-continuous quantum-walk can enable full\nreconstruction of any two-photon spatially entangled and mixed state at the\ninput. This approach does not require any tunable elements, so is well suited\nfor integration with on-chip superconducting photon detectors.\n", "  We develop a general theoretical framework of integrated paired\nphoton-plasmon generation through spontaneous wave mixing in nonlinear\nplasmonic and metamaterial nanostructures, rigorously accounting for material\ndispersion and losses in quantum regime through the electromagnetic Green\nfunction. We identify photon-plasmon correlations in layered metal-dielectric\nstructures with 70% internal heralding quantum efficiency, and reveal novel\nmechanism of broadband generation enhancement due to topological transition in\nhyperbolic metamaterials.\n", "  The Schr\\\"odinger equation of the spherical symmetry quantum models such as\nthe hydrogen atom problem seems to be analytically non-solvable in higher\ndimensions. When we try to compactifying one or several dimensions this\nquestion can maybe solved. This paper stands for the study of the spherical\nsymmetry quantum models on noncommutative spacetime with compactified extra\ndimensions. We provide analytically the resulting spectrum of the hydrogen atom\nand Yukawa problem in $4+1$ dimensional noncommutative spacetime in the first\norder approximation of noncommutative parameter. The case of higher dimensions\n$D\\geq 4$ is also discussed.\n", "  An effective potential is created for the dynamics of a test particle, which\npreserves dilatation symmetry for nonlinear static dilaton-Maxwell background.\nIt is found that the central interaction in this theory is regular everywhere,\nand that the theory is asymptotically free at short distances and that it has a\nCoulomb properties at great distances from the source. It is shown that static\nand spherically symmetric source, behaves like a soliton: it has the finite\nenergy characteristics that are inversely proportional to the dilaton-Maxwell\ncoupling constant.\n", "  Zero temperature non-plateau magnetization is a peculiar property of a\nquantum spin chain and it sometimes appears due to different gyromagnetic\nfactors. In this study, we illustrate a quite unusual nonplateau magnetization\nproperty driven by XY-anisotropy in an Ising-XYZ diamond chain. Two particles\nwith spin-1/2 are bonded by XYZ coupling and they are responsible for the\nemergence of non-plateau magnetization. These two quantum operator spins are\nbonded to two nodal Ising spins and this process is repeated infinitely to\nyield a diamond chain structure. Due to the non-plateau magnetization property,\nwe focus our discussion on the magnetocaloric effect of this model by\npresenting the isentropic curves and the Gruneisen parameters, as well as\nshowing the regions where the model exhibits an efficient magnetocaloric\neffect. Due to the existence of two phases located very close to each other,\nthe strong XY-anisotropy exhibits a particular behavior with a magnetocaloric\neffect, with a wider interval in the magnetic field, where the magnetocaloric\neffect is efficient.\n", "  A classical spin which is antiferromagnetically coupled to a system of\nstrongly correlated conduction electrons is shown to exhibit unconventional\nreal-time dynamics which cannot be described by Gilbert damping. Depending on\nthe strength of the local Coulomb interaction, the two main electronic\ndissipation channels, transport of excitations via correlated hopping and via\nexcitations of correlation-induced magnetic moments, become active on largely\ndifferent time scales. We demonstrate that this can lead to a prethermalization\nscenario which so far has been observed in purely electronic systems only and\nwhich is governed here by proximity to the divergent magnetic time scale in the\ninfinite-U limit.\n", "  In the magnetosphere of a rotating black hole, an inner Alfven critical\nsurface (IACS) must be crossed by inflowing plasma. Inside the IACS, Alfven\nwaves are inward directed toward the black hole. The majority of the proper\nvolume of the active region of spacetime (the ergosphere) is inside of the\nIACS. The charge and the totally transverse momentum flux (the momentum flux\ntransverse to both the wave normal and the unperturbed magnetic field) are both\ndetermined exclusively by the Alfven polarization. Thus, it is important for\nnumerical simulations of black hole magnetospheres to minimize the dissipation\nof Alfven waves. Elements of the dissipated wave emerge in adjacent cells\nregardless of the IACS, there is no mechanism to prevent Alfvenic information\nfrom crossing outward. Thus, numerical dissipation can affect how simulated\nmagnetospheres attain the substantial Goldreich-Julian charge density\nassociated with the rotating magnetic field. In order to help minimize\ndissipation of Alfven waves in relativistic numerical simulations we have\nformulated a one-dimensional Riemann solver, called HLLI, which incorporates\nthe Alfven discontinuity and the contact discontinuity. We have also formulated\na multidimensional Riemann solver, called MuSIC, that enables low dissipation\npropagation of Alfven waves in multiple dimensions. The importance of higher\norder schemes in lowering the numerical dissipation of Alfven waves is also\ncatalogued.\n", "  Anderson localisation is an important phenomenon arising in many areas of\nphysics, and here we explore it in the context of quantum information devices.\nFinite dimensional spin chains have been demonstrated to be important devices\nfor quantum information transport, and in particular can be engineered to allow\nfor \"perfect state transfer\" (PST). Here we present extensive investigations of\ndisordered PST spin chains, demonstrating spatial localisation and transport\nretardation effects, and relate these effects to conventional Anderson\nlocalisation. We provide thresholds for Anderson localisation in these finite\nquantum information systems for both the spatial and the transport domains.\nFinally, we consider the effect of disorder on the eigenstate and energy\nspectrum of our Hamiltonian, where results support our conclusions on the\npresence of Anderson localisation.\n", "  We are concerned with how regular initial data have to be to ensure local\nexistence for Einstein's equations in wave coordinates. Klainerman-Rodnianski\nand Smith-Tataru showed that there in general is local existence for data in\nSobolev spaces H^s with regularity s>2. We give an example of data in Sobolev\nspaces with regularity s=2 for which there is no local solution in this space.\n", "  Visualizing individual charges confined to molecules and observing their\ndynamics with high spatial resolution is a challenge for advancing various\nfields in science, ranging from mesoscopic physics to electron transfer events\nin biological molecules. We show here, that the high sensitivity of low-energy\nelectrons to local electric fields can be employed to directly visualize\nindividual charged adsorbates and to study their behaviour in a quantitative\nway. This makes electron holography a unique probing tool for directly\nvisualising charge distributions with a sensitivity of a fraction of an\nelementary charge. Moreover, spatial resolution in the nanometer range and fast\ndata acquisition inherent to lens-less low-energy electron holography allows\nfor direct visual inspection of charge transfer processes.\n", "  For a two-level system, it is believed that a far-off-resonant driving can\nnot help coherent population transfer between the states. In this work, we\npropose a scheme to implement the coherent transfer with far-off-resonant\ndriving. The scheme works well with both constant driving and Gaussian driving.\nThe total time to finish population transfer is also minimized by optimizing\nthe detuning and coupling constants. We find that the scheme is sensitive to\nspontaneous emission much more than dephasing. It might find potential\napplications in X-ray quantum optics and population transfer in Rydberg atoms\nas well.\n", "  Several micro-organisms, such as bacteria, algae, or spermatozoa, use\nflagella or cilia to swim in a fluid, while many other micro-organisms instead\nuse ample shape deformation, described as amoeboid, to propel themselves by\neither crawling on a substrate or swimming. Many eukaryotic cells were believed\nto require an underlying substratum to migrate (crawl) by using membrane\ndeformation (like blebbing or generation of lamellipodia) but there is now\nincreasing evidence that a large variety of cells (including those of the\nimmune system) can migrate without the assistance of focal adhesion, allowing\nthem to swim as efficiently as they can crawl. This paper details the analysis\nof amoeboid swimming in a confined fluid by modeling the swimmer as an\ninextensible membrane deploying local active forces. The swimmer displays a\nrich behavior: it may settle into a straight trajectory in the channel or\nnavigate from one wall to the other depending on its confinement. The nature of\nthe swimmer is also found to be affected by confinement: the swimmer can\nbehave, on the average over one swimming cycle, as a pusher at low confinement,\nand becomes a puller at higher confinement. The swimmer's nature is thus not an\nintrinsic property. The scaling of the swimmer velocity V with the force\namplitude A is analyzed in detail showing that at small enough A, $V\\sim\nA^2/\\eta^2$, whereas at large enough A, V is independent of the force and is\ndetermined solely by the stroke frequency and swimmer size. This finding\nstarkly contrasts with currently known results found from swimming models where\nmotion is based on flagellar or ciliary activity, where $V\\sim A/\\eta$. To\nconclude, two definitions of efficiency as put forward in the literature are\nanalyzed with distinct outcomes. We find that one type of efficiency has an\noptimum as a function of confinement while the other does not. Future\nperspectives are outlined.\n", "  Rashba spin-orbit coupling and a magnetic field perpendicular to the Rashba\naxis have been predicted to open a partial gap (\"helical gap\") in the energy\nspectrum of noninteracting or weakly interacting one-dimensional quantum wires.\nBy comparing kinetic energy and Coulomb energy we show that this gap opening\ntypically occurs at low electron densities where the Coulomb energy dominates.\nTo address this strongly correlated limit, we investigate Rashba wires using\nWigner crystal theory. We find that the helical gap exists even in the limit of\nstrong interactions but its dependence on electron density differs\nsignificantly from the weakly interacting case. In particular, we find that the\ncritical magnetic field for opening the gap becomes an oscillatory function of\nelectron density. This changes strongly the expected signature of the helical\ngap in conductance measurements.\n", "  Cosmology plays a fundamental role to determine the neutrino mass, therefore\nalso to determine its mass hierarchy, since the massive neutrino contributes to\nthe total matter density in the Universe at the background and perturbation\nlevels, once it becomes non-relativistic. After the non-relativistic transition\nthe fluctuations are smashed out at the scales $k\\gg k_{fs}$. Therefore, the\nmissing fluctuation in the total matter is imprinted on the large scale\nstructure, say the suppression of the matter power spectrum $\\Delta P/P\\approx\n-8f_{\\nu}$ at the scales $k\\gg k_{fs}$. In this paper, instead of considering\nthe linear perturbation theory, which is well understood in the presence of\nneutrino, we propose to use the cross correlation between the Rees-Sciama\neffect and weak lensing to probe the neutrino mass. At the small scales, the\ndensity contrast grows faster than the background scale factor $\\delta\\sim a$,\nthat makes a sign flipping on $\\Phi' \\propto \\mathcal{H}\\delta d\\ln\n(\\delta/a)/d\\ln a$, which happens only in the non-linear regime. We show that\nthe flipping scale in the cross power spectrum between the Rees-Sciama effect\nand weak lensing depends on the neutrino mass by assuming the shallow and deep\nweak lensing surveys. Our analysis shows that the Deep survey has larger\nsignal-to-noise ratio $S/N\\sim 160$. Finally, we use the Fisher information\nmatrix to forecast constraint on the neutrino mass.\n", "  We derive an analytic expression for the geometric Hall viscosity of\nnon-interacting electrons in a single graphene layer in the presence of a\nperpendicular magnetic field. We show that a recently-derived formula in [C.\nHoyos and D. T. Son, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 108}, 066805 (2012)], which connects\nthe coefficient of $q^2$ in the wave vector expansion of the Hall conductivity\n$\\sigma_{xy}(q)$ of the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) to the Hall\nviscosity and the orbital diamagnetic susceptibility of that system, continues\nto hold for graphene -- in spite of the lack of Galilean invariance -- with a\nsuitable definition of the effective mass. We also show that, for a\nsufficiently large number of occupied Landau levels in the positive energy\nsector, the Hall conductivity of electrons in graphene reduces to that of a\nGalilean-invariant 2DEG with an effective mass given by $\\hbar k_F/v_F$\n(cyclotron mass). Even in the most demanding case, i.e. when the chemical\npotential falls between the zero-th and the first Landau level, the cyclotron\nmass formula gives results accurate to better than 1$\\%$. The connection\nbetween the Hall conductivity and the viscosity provides a possible avenue to\nmeasure the Hall viscosity in graphene.\n", "  We study entanglement in states of holographic CFTs defined by Euclidean path\nintegrals over geometries with slowly varying metrics. In particular, our CFT\nspacetimes have $S^1$ fibers whose size $b$ varies along one direction ($x$) of\nan ${\\mathbb R}^{d-1}$ base. Such examples respect an ${\\mathbb R}^{d-2}$\nEuclidean symmetry. Treating the $S^1$ direction as time leads to a thermofield\ndouble state on a spacetime with adiabatically varying redshift, while treating\nanother direction as time leads to a confining ground state with slowly varying\nconfinement scale. In both contexts the entropy of slab-shaped regions defined\nby $|x - x_0| \\le L$ exhibits well-known phase transitions at length scales $L=\nL_{crit}$ characterizing the CFT entanglements. For the thermofield double, the\nnumerical coefficients governing the effect of variations in $b(x)$ on the\ntransition are surprisingly small and exhibit an interesting change of sign:\ngradients reduce $L_{crit}$ for $d \\le 3$ but increase $L_{crit}$ for $d\\ge4$.\nThis means that, while for general $L > L_{crit}$ they significantly increase\nthe mutual information of opposing slabs as one would expect, for $d\\ge 4$\ngradients cause a small decrease near the phase transition. In contrast, for\nthe confining ground states gradients always decrease $L_{crit}$, with the\neffect becoming more pronounced in higher dimensions.\n", "  The latest trend in studies of modern electronically and/or optically active\nmaterials is to provoke phase transformations induced by high electric fields\nor by short (femtosecond) powerful optical pulses. The systems of choice are\ncooperative electronic states whose broken symmetries give rise to topological\ndefects. For typical quasi-one-dimensional architectures, those are the\nmicroscopic solitons taking from electrons the major roles as carriers of\ncharge or spin. Because of the long-range ordering, the solitons experience\nunusual super-long-range forces leading to a sequence of phase transitions in\ntheir ensembles: the higher-temperature transition of the confinement and the\nlower one of aggregation into macroscopic walls. Here we present results of an\nextensive numerical modeling for ensembles of both neutral and charged solitons\nin both two- and three-dimensional systems. We suggest a specific Monte Carlo\nalgorithm preserving the number of solitons, which substantially facilitates\nthe calculations, allows to extend them to the three-dimensional case and to\ninclude the important long-range Coulomb interactions. The results confirm the\nfirst confinement transition, except for a very strong Coulomb repulsion, and\ndemonstrate a pattern formation at the second transition of aggregation.\n", "  We consider the ground state properties of a trapped dipolar condensate under\nthe influence of quantum fluctuations. We show that this system can undergo a\nphase transition from a low density condensate state to a high density droplet\nstate, which is stabilized by quantum fluctuations. The energetically favored\nstate depends on the geometry of the confining potential, the number of atoms\nand the two-body interactions. We develop a simple variational ansatz and\nvalidate it against full numerical solutions. We produce a phase diagram for\nthe system and present results relevant to current experiments with dysprosium\nand erbium condensates.\n", "  The radii of young (<100 Myr) star clusters correlate only weakly with their\nmasses. This shallow relation has been used to argue that impulsive tidal\nperturbations, or `shocks', by passing giant molecular clouds (GMCs)\npreferentially disrupt low-mass clusters. We show that this mass-radius\nrelation is in fact the result of the combined effect of two-body relaxation\nand repeated tidal shocks. Clusters in a broad range of environments including\nthose like the solar neighbourhood evolve towards a typical radius of a few\nparsecs, as observed, independent of the initial radius. This equilibrium\nmass-radius relation is the result of a competition between expansion by\nrelaxation and shrinking due to shocks. Interactions with GMCs are more\ndisruptive for low-mass clusters, which helps to evolve the globular cluster\nmass function (GCMF). However, the properties of the interstellar medium in\nhigh-redshift galaxies required to establish a universal GCMF shape are more\nextreme than previously derived, challenging the idea that all GCs formed with\nthe same power-law mass function.\n", "  We present a theory for the acoustic force density acting on inhomogeneous\nfluids in acoustic fields on time scales that are slow compared to the acoustic\noscillation period. The acoustic force density depends on gradients in the\ndensity and compressibility of the fluid. For microfluidic systems, the theory\npredicts a relocation of the inhomogeneities into stable field-dependent\nconfigurations, which are qualitatively different from the horizontally layered\nconfigurations due to gravity. Experimental validation is obtained by confocal\nimaging of aqueous solutions in a glass-silicon microchip.\n", "  The HD 61005 debris disk (\"The Moth\") stands out from the growing collection\nof spatially resolved circumstellar disks by virtue of its unusual swept-back\nmorphology, brightness asymmetries, and dust ring offset. Despite several\nsuggestions for the physical mechanisms creating these features, no definitive\nanswer has been found. In this work, we demonstrate the plausibility of a\nscenario in which the disk material is shaped dynamically by an eccentric,\ninclined planet. We present new Keck NIRC2 scattered-light angular differential\nimaging of the disk at 1.2-2.3 microns that further constrains its outer\nmorphology (projected separations of 27-135 AU). We also present complementary\nGemini Planet Imager 1.6 micron total intensity and polarized light detections\nthat probe down to projected separations less than 10 AU. To test our\nplanet-sculpting hypothesis, we employed secular perturbation theory to\nconstruct parent body and dust distributions that informed scattered-light\nmodels. We found that this method produced models with morphological and\nphotometric features similar to those seen in the data, supporting the premise\nof a planet-perturbed disk. Briefly, our results indicate a disk parent body\npopulation with a semimajor axis of 40-52 AU and an interior planet with an\neccentricity of at least 0.2. Many permutations of planet mass and semimajor\naxis are allowed, ranging from an Earth mass at 35 AU to a Jupiter mass at 5\nAU.\n", "  Motivated by the numerous examples of 1/3 magnetization plateaux in the\ntriangular lattice Heisenberg an- tiferromagnet with spins ranging from 1/2 to\n5/2, we revisit the semiclassical calculation of the magnetization curve of\nthat model, with the aim of coming up with a simple method that allows one to\ncalculate the full mag- netization curve, and not just the critical fields of\nthe 1/3 plateau. We show that it is actually possible to calculate the\nmagnetization curve including the first quantum corrections and the appearance\nof the 1/3 plateau entirely within linear spin-wave theory, with predictions\nfor the critical fields that agree to order 1/S with those derived a long-time\nago on the basis of arguments that required to go beyond linear spin-wave\ntheory. This calculation relies on the central observation that there is a kink\nin the semiclassical energy at the field where the classical ground state is\nthe collinear up-up-down structure, and that this kink gives rise to a locally\nlinear behavior of the energy with the field when all semiclassical ground\nstates are compared to each other for all fields. The magnetization curves\ncalculated in this way for spin 1/2, 1 and 5/2 are shown to be in good\nagreement with available experimental data.\n", "  Electric-field control of magnetism provides a promising route towards\nultralow power information storage and sensor technologies. The effects of\nmagneto-ionic motion have so far been prominently featured in the direct\nmodification of interface chemical and physical characteristics. Here we\ndemonstrate magnetoelectric coupling moderated by voltage-driven oxygen\nmigration beyond the interface limit in relatively thick AlOx/GdOx/Co (15 nm)\nfilms. Oxygen migration and its ramifications on the Co magnetization are\nquantitatively mapped with polarized neutron reflectometry under thermal and\nelectro-thermal conditionings. The depth-resolved profiles uniquely identify\ninterfacial and bulk behaviors and a semi-reversible suppression and recovery\nof the magnetization. Magnetometry measurements show that the conditioning\nchanges the microstructure so as to disrupt long-range ferromagnetic ordering,\nresulting in an additional magnetically soft phase. X-ray spectroscopy confirms\nelectric field induced changes in the Co oxidation state but not in the Gd,\nsuggesting that the GdOx transmits oxygen but does not source or sink it. These\nresults together provide crucial insight into controlling magnetic\nheterostructures via magneto-ionic motion, not only at the interface, but also\nthroughout the bulk of the films.\n", "  We determine the effect of a CPT-even and Lorentz violating non-minimal\ncoupling on the differential cross sections for some of the most important\ntree-level processes in QED, namely, Compton and Bhabha scatterings, as well as\nelectron-positron annihilation. Experimental limits constraining the allowed\ndeviation of the differential cross sections relative to pure QED allow us to\nplace upper bounds on the Lorentz violating parameters. A constraint based on\nthe decay rate of para-positronium is also obtained.\n", "  Relativistic Bose-Einstein condensates (rBECs) have recently become a\nwell-established system for analogue gravity. Indeed, while such relativistic\nsystems cannot be yet realized experimentally, they provide an interesting\nframework for mimicking metrics for which no analogue is yet available, so\npaving the way for further theoretical and numerical explorations. In this\nvein, we here discuss black holes in rBECs and explore how their features\nrelate to the bulk properties of the system. We then propose the coupling of\nexternal fields to the rBEC as a way to mimic non-metric features. In\nparticular, we use a Proca field to simulate an aether field, as found in\nEinstein-Aether or Horava-Lifshitz gravity. This allows us to mimic a universal\nhorizon, the causal barrier relevant for superluminal modes in these modified\ngravitational theories.\n", "  We discuss two-dimensional diffusion of a Brownian particle confined to a\nperiodic asymmetric channel with soft walls modeled by a parabolic potential.\nIn the channel, the particle experiences different noise intensities, or\ntemperatures, in the transversal and longitudinal directions. The model is\ninspired by the famous Feynman's ratchet and pawl. Using ideas of the\nFick-Jacobs approximation we derive the mean velocity of the particle, the\neffective diffusion coefficient, and the stationary probability density in the\npotential unit cell. The derived results are exact for small channel width.\nYet, we check by exact numerical calculation that they qualitatively describe\nthe ratchet effect observed for an arbitrary width of the channel.\n", "  We discuss the impact of EW corrections on differential distributions in\ntop-quark pair production at the LHC and future hadron colliders, focusing on\nthe effects of initial-state photons. Performing a calculation at\nNext-to-Leading Order QCD+EW accuracy, we investigate in detail the impact of\nphoton-initiated channels on central values as well as PDF and scale\nuncertainties, both at order $\\alpha_s\\alpha$ and $\\alpha_s^2\\alpha$. We\npresent predictions at 13 and 100 TeV, and provide results for the 8 TeV\ndifferential measurements performed by ATLAS and CMS. A thorough comparison of\nresults obtained with the NNPDF2.3QED and CT14QED PDF sets is performed. While\ncontributions due to the photon PDF are negligible with CT14QED, this is not\nthe case for NNPDF2.3QED, where such contributions are sizeable and show large\nPDF uncertainties. On the one hand, we show that differential observables in\ntop-pair production, in particular top-quark and $t\\bar t$ rapidities, can be\nused to improve the determination of the photon PDF within the NNPDF approach.\nOn the other hand, with current PDF sets, we demonstrate the necessity of\nincluding EW corrections and photon-induced contributions for a correct\ndetermination of both the central value and the uncertainties of theoretical\npredictions.\n", "  In quantum field theory in curved backgrounds, one typically distinguishes\nbetween objective, tensorial, quantities such as the Renormalized Stress-Energy\nTensor (RSET) and subjective, non-tensorial, quantities such as Bogoliubov\ncoefficients which encode perception effects associated with the specific\ntrajectory of a detector. In this work we propose a way to treat both objective\nand subjective notions on an equal tensorial footing. For that purpose, we\ndefine a new tensor which we will call the Perception Renormalized\nStress-Energy Tensor (PeRSET). The PeRSET is defined as the subtraction of the\nRSET corresponding to two different vacuum states. Based on this tensor we can\ndefine perceived energy densities and fluxes. The PeRSET helps to have a more\norganized and systematic understanding of various results in the literature\nregarding quantum field theory in black hole spacetimes. We illustrate the\nphysics encoded in this tensor by working out various examples of special\nrelevance.\n", "  We describe the program HERWIRI2.1, which implements order alpha-squared\nphotonic radiative corrections exponentiated at the amplitude level (initial\nstate, final state, and initial-final interference) and electroweak corrections\nto the matrix element by generating events using the KK Monte Carlo to generate\nthe hard process, with quark initial states generated according to PDFs via an\nLHAPDF interface. The events can be showered internally using HERWIG6.5 or\nexported and showered using any desired external showering program. Some early\nresults are shown, including comparisons to HERWIG6.5 and HORACE 3.1.\n", "  Using the superlattice (SL) eigenvalues $E_{\\mu ,\\nu }^{c,v}$ and\neigenfunctions $\\varphi_{\\mu\\nu}^{c,v}(z) $, obtained within the theory of\nfinite periodic systems, where $\\mu$ indicates the subbands and $\\nu$ the\nintra-subband levels, we calculate optical transitions in SLs and periodic\nsystems. Based on the eigenfunction parity symmetries, studied in the previous\npaper, new symmetry selection rules (SSR) are derived and photoluminescence and\ninfrared spectra for different types of SLs are calculated. The narrow peaks\nclustered in groups that couldn't be explained before in Nakamura's et al. for\nblue emitting devices, are now fully understood. Among the various properties\nand differences that we discuss in the paper, we notice that many transitions\nthat were experimentally observed but theoretically forbidden, are now\nperfectly possible. Since the number of matrix-elements allowed by the SSR is\ngenerally too large, we devote the second part of this paper to show that one\ncan obtain the same spectra when, besides the SSR, other leading order\nselection rules closely related to intra-subband symmetries are introduced.\nThese rules reduce the number of matrix evaluations from $\\sim n^2$$n_cn_v/2$\nto $\\sim n$$n_cn_v/2$, i.e., depending on the SL, from about 1000 to 100. We\ncomment also on a third rule, that picks up the contributions of the surface\nand edge states, and show that it reduces further the number of transitions to\n$N_s\\leq n_cn_v$. With these rules, the main peaks are conserved and their\nnumber practically matches with that of the actual spectrum. Excellent\nagreements with experimental results are found.\n", "  Motivated by UV completion of general relativity with a modification of a\ngeometry at high energy scale, it is expected to have an energy dependent\ngeometry. In this paper, we introduce charged black hole solutions with power\nMaxwell invariant source in the context of gravity's rainbow. In addition, we\ninvestigate two classes of $F(R)$ gravity's rainbow solutions. At first, we\nstudy energy dependent $F(R)$ gravity without energy momentum tensor, and then\nwe obtain $F(R)$ gravity's rainbow in the presence of conformally invariant\nMaxwell source. We study geometrical properties of the mentioned solutions and\ncompare their results. We also give some related comments regarding to\nthermodynamical behavior of the obtained solutions and discuss thermal\nstability of the solutions.\n", "  We present a detailed analysis of the pre-main-sequence (PMS) population of\nthe young star cluster Westerlund~2 (Wd2), the central ionizing cluster of the\nHII region RCW 49, using data from a high resolution multi-band survey with the\nHubble Space Telescope. The data were acquired with the Advanced Camera for\nSurveys in the F555W, F814W, and F658N filters and with the Wide Field Camera 3\nin the F125W, F160W, and F128N filters. We find a mean age of the region of\n1.04+-0.72 Myr. The combination of dereddened F555W and F814W photometry in\ncombination with F658N photometry allows us to study and identify stars with\nH_alpha excess emission. With a careful selection of 240 bona-fide PMS H_alpha\nexcess emitters we were able to determine their H_alpha luminosity, which has a\nmean value L(H_alpha)=1.67 x 10^{-31} erg s^{-1}. Using the PARSEC 1.2S\nisochrones to obtain the stellar parameters of the PMS stars we determined a\nmean mass accretion rate \\dot M_acc=4.43 x 10^{-8} M_sun yr^{-1} per star. A\ncareful analysis of the spatial dependence of the mass-accretion rate suggests\nthat this rate is ~25% lower in center of the two density peaks of Wd2 in close\nproximity to the luminous OB stars, compared to the Wd2 average. This rate is\nhigher with increasing distance from the OB stars, indicating that the PMS\naccretion disks are being rapidly destroyed by the far-ultra-violet radiation\nemitted by the OB population.\n", "  A gas of interacting ultracold fermions can be tuned into a strongly\ninteracting regime using a Feshbach resonance. Here we theoretically study\nquasiparticle transport in a system of two reservoirs of interacting ultracold\nfermions on the BCS side of the BCS-BEC crossover coupled weakly via a tunnel\njunction. Using the generalized BCS theory we calculate the time evolution of\nthe system that is assumed to be initially prepared in a non-equilibrium state\ncharacterized by a particle number imbalance or a temperature imbalance. A\nnumber of characteristic features like sharp peaks in quasiparticle currents,\nor transitions between the normal and superconducting states are found. We\ndiscuss signatures of the Seebeck and the Peltier effect and the resulting\ntemperature difference of the two reservoirs as a function of the interaction\nparameter $(k_Fa)^{-1}$. The Peltier effect may lead to an additional cooling\nmechanism for ultracold fermionic atoms.\n", "  We perform an experiment to test between two theories of the electrodynamics\nof superconductors: the standard London theory and an alternative proposed by\nJ. E. Hirsch [Phys. Rev. B 69, 214515 (2004)]. The two alternatives give\ndifferent predictions with respect to the screening of an electric field by a\nsuperconductor, and we try to detect this effect using atomic force microscopy\non a niobium sample. We also perform the reverse experiment, where we\ndemonstrate a superconductive tip mounted on a qPlus force sensor. Due to\nlimited accuracy, we are able neither to prove nor to disprove Hirsch's\nhypothesis. Within our accuracy of 0.17 N/m, the superconductive transition\ndoes not alter the atomic-scale interaction between tip and sample.\n", "  Nonlinear light-matter interactions and their applications are constrained by\nproperties of available materials. The use of metamaterials opens the way to\nachieve precise control over electromagnetic properties at a microscopic level,\nproviding new tools for experimental studies of complex nonlinear phenomena in\nphotonics. Here a doubly resonant nonlinear meta-atom is proposed, analyzed and\ncharacterized in the GHz spectral range. The underlying structure is composed\nof a pair of split rings, resonant at both fundamental and nonlinear\nfrequencies. The rings share a varactor diode, which serves as a microscopic\nsource of nonlinearity. Flexible control over the coupling and near- and\nfar-field patterns are reported, favoring the doubly resonant structure over\nother realizations. Relative efficiencies of the second and third harmonics,\ngenerated by the diode, are tailored by dint of the double-ring geometry,\nproviding a guideline for selecting one frequency against another, using the\ndesign of the auxiliary structures. The on-demand control over the microscopic\nnonlinear properties enables developing a toolbox for experimental emulation of\ncomplex nonlinear phenomena.\n", "  We study a resistive tearing instability developing in a system evolving\nthrough the combined effect of Hall drift in the Electron-MHD limit and Ohmic\ndissipation. We explore first the exponential growth of the instability in the\nlinear case and we find the fastest growing mode, the corresponding eigenvalues\nand dispersion relation. The instability growth rate scales as $\\gamma \\propto\nB^{2/3} \\sigma^{-1/3}$ where $B$ is the magnetic field and $\\sigma$ the\nelectrical conductivity. We confirm the development of the tearing resistive\ninstability in the fully non-linear case, in a plane parallel configuration\nwhere the magnetic field polarity reverses, through simulations of systems\ninitiating in Hall equilibrium with some superimposed perturbation. Following a\ntransient phase, during which there is some minor rearrangement of the magnetic\nfield, the perturbation grows exponentially. Once the instability is fully\ndeveloped the magnetic field forms the characteristic islands and X-type\nreconnection points, where Ohmic decay is enhanced. We discuss the implications\nof this instability for the local magnetic field evolution in neutron stars'\ncrusts, proposing that it can contribute to heating near the surface of the\nstar, as suggested by models of magnetar post-burst cooling. In particular, we\nfind that a current sheet a few meters thick, covering as little as $1\\%$ of\nthe total surface can provide $10^{42}~$erg in thermal energy within a few\ndays. We briefly discuss applications of this instability in other systems\nwhere the Hall effect operates such as protoplanetary discs and space plasmas.\n", "  We devise a scheme for converting an existing exchange functional into its\nrange-separated hybrid variant. The underlying exchange hole of the\nBecke-Roussel type has the exact second-order expansion in the interelectron\ndistance. The short-range part of the resulting range-separated exchange energy\ndepends on the kinetic energy density and the Laplacian even if the base\nfunctional lacks the dependence on these variables. The most successful\npractical realization of the scheme, named LC-PBETPSS, combines the\nrange-separated PBE exchange lifted to the hybrid meta-GGA rung and the TPSS\ncorrelation. The value of the range-separation parameter is estimated\ntheoretically and confirmed by empirical optimization. The D3 dispersion\ncorrection is recommended for all energy computations employing the presented\nfunctional. Numerical tests show remarkably robust performance of the method\nfor noncovalent interaction energies, barrier heights, main-group\nthermochemistry, and excitation energies.\n", "  We use renormalization group (RG) analysis and dimensional regularization\ntechniques to study potential superconductivity-inducing four-fermion\ninteractions in systems with critical Fermi surfaces of general dimensions\n($m$) and co-dimensions ($d-m$), arising as a result of quasiparticle\ninteraction with a gapless Ising-nematic order parameter. These are examples of\nnon-Fermi liquid states in $d$ spatial dimensions. Our formalism allows us to\ntreat the corresponding zero-temperature low-energy effective theory in a\ncontrolled approximation close to the upper critical dimension $d=d_c(m)$. The\nfixed points are identified from the RG flow equations, as functions of $d$ and\n$m$. We find that the flow towards the non-Fermi liquid fixed point is\npreempted by Cooper pair formation for both the physical cases of $(d=3, m=2)$\nand $(d=2, m=1)$. In fact, there is a strong enhancement of superconductivity\nby the order parameter fluctuations at the quantum critical point.\n", "  In this work, we present the investigation of temperature dependent hall\nmeasurement of the ultra thin VO$_2$ films grown on Si/SiO$_2$ substrate.\nExperimental results suggest that electrons are the predominant carrier both in\nthe semiconducting and metallic phases. The decrease of the resistivity with\nincreasing temperature is mainly caused by the increase in the number density\nof charge carriers. The temperature dependence of the carrier concentration\nindicates the VO$_2$ films has a band gap of 0.40$\\pm$0.09 $ev$ in the\nsemiconducting phase. Analysis of hall effect data based on a composite cube\nmodel suggests that the sample has some untransitional phase with a length that\nis 1/4 of the grains.\n", "  The superconductor-to-insulator transition (SIT) induced by means such as\nexternal magnetic fields, disorder or spatial confinement is a vivid\nillustration of a quantum phase transition dramatically affecting the\nsuperconducting order parameter. In pursuit of a new realization of the SIT by\ninterfacial charge transfer, we developed extremely thin superlattices composed\nof high $T_c$ superconductor YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ (YBCO) and colossal\nmagnetoresistance ferromagnet La$_{0.67}$Ca$_{0.33}$MnO$_3$ (LCMO). By using\nlinearly polarized resonant X-ray absorption spectroscopy and magnetic circular\ndichroism, combined with hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, we derived a\ncomplete picture of the interfacial carrier doping in cuprate and manganite\natomic layers, leading to the transition from superconducting to an unusual\nMott insulating state emerging with the increase of LCMO layer thickness. In\naddition, contrary to the common perception that only transition metal ions may\nresponse to the charge transfer process, we found that charge is also actively\ncompensated by rare-earth and alkaline-earth metal ions of the interface. Such\ndeterministic control of $T_c$ by pure electronic doping without any hindering\neffects of chemical substitution is another promising route to disentangle the\nrole of disorder on the pseudo-gap and charge density wave phases of underdoped\ncuprates.\n", "  Assessing and controlling magnetic interactions in magnetic nanostructures\nare critical to nanomagnetic and spintronic explorations, such as magnetic\nrecording media, permanent magnets, magnetic memory and logic devices, etc.\nHere we demonstrate an extremely sensitive magnetic yoking effect and tunable\ninteractions in FePt based hard/soft bilayers mediated by the soft layer. Below\nthe exchange length, a thin soft layer strongly exchange couples to the\nperpendicular moments of the hard layer; above the exchange length, just a few\nnanometers thicker, the soft layer moments turn in-plane and act to yoke the\ndipolar fields from the adjacent hard layer perpendicular domains. The\nevolution from exchange to dipolar-dominated interactions is experimentally\ncaptured by first-order reversal curves, the delta-M method, and polarized\nneutron reflectometry, and confirmed by micromagnetic simulations. These\nfindings demonstrate an effective yoking approach to design and control\nmagnetic interactions in wide varieties of magnetic nanostructures and devices.\n", "  Significant efficiency droop is a major concern for light-emitting diodes and\nlaser diodes operating at high current density. Recent study has suggested that\nheavily Bi-alloyed GaAs can decrease the non-radiative Auger recombination and\ntherefore alleviate the efficiency droop. Using density functional theory, we\nstudied a newly fabricated quaternary alloy, GaAs1-x-yPyBix, which can host\nsignificant amounts of Bi, through calculations of its band gap, spin-orbit\nsplitting, and band offsets with GaAs. We found that the band gap changes of\nGaAs1-x-yPyBix relative to GaAs are determined mainly by the local structural\nchanges around P and Bi atoms rather than their electronic structure\ndifferences. To obtain alloy with lower Auger recombination than GaAs bulk, we\nidentified the necessary constraints on the compositions of P and Bi. Finally,\nwe demonstrated that GaAs/GaAs1-x-yPyBix heterojunctions with potentially low\nAuger recombination can exhibit small lattice mismatch and large enough band\noffsets for strong carrier confinement. This work shows that the electronic\nproperties of GaAs1-x-yPyBix are potentially suitable for high-energy infrared\nlight-emitting diodes and laser diodes with improved efficiency.\n", "  We consider a proper propositional quantum logic and show that it has\nmultiple disjoint lattice models, only one of which is an orthomodular lattice\n(algebra) underlying Hilbert (quantum) space. We give an equivalent proof for\nthe classical logic which turns out to have disjoint distributive and\nnon-distributive ortholattices as its models. In particular, we prove that both\nclassical and quantum logics are sound and complete with respect to each of\nthese lattices. We also show that there is one common non-orthomodular lattice\nthat is a model of both quantum and classical logics. In technical terms, that\nenables us to run the same classical logic on both a digital (standard, two\nsubset, 0-1 bit) computer and on a non-digital (say, a six subset) computer\n(with appropriate chips and circuits). With quantum logic, the same six element\ncommon lattice can serve us as a benchmark for an efficient evaluation of\nequations of bigger lattice models or theorems of the logic.\n", "  Inverse methods of statistical mechanics have facilitated the discovery of\npair potentials that stabilize a wide variety of targeted lattices at zero\ntemperature. However, such methods are complicated by the need to compare,\nwithin the optimization framework, the energy of the desired lattice to all\npossibly relevant competing structures, which are not generally known in\nadvance. Furthermore, ground-state stability does not guarantee that the target\nwill readily assemble from the fluid upon cooling from higher temperature.\nHere, we introduce a molecular dynamics simulation-based, optimization design\nstrategy that iteratively and systematically refines the pair interaction\naccording to the fluid and crystalline structural ensembles encountered during\nthe assembly process. We successfully apply this probabilistic,\nmachine-learning approach to the design of repulsive, isotropic pair potentials\nthat assemble into honeycomb, kagome, square, rectangular, truncated square and\ntruncated hexagonal lattices.\n", "  We report a comprehensive specific heat and inelastic neutron scattering\nstudy to explore the possible origin of multiferroicity in HoCrO$_3$. We have\nperformed specific heat measurements in the temperature range 100 mK - 290 K\nand inelastic neutron scattering measurements were performed in the temperature\nrange 1.5 - 200 K. From the specific heat data we determined hyperfine\nsplitting at 22.5(2) $\\mu$eV and crystal field transitions at 1.379(5) meV,\n10.37(4) meV, 15.49(9) meV and 23.44(9) meV, indicating the existence of strong\nhyperfine and crystal field interactions in HoCrO$_3$. Further, an effective\nhyperfine field is determined to be 600(3) T. The quasielastic scattering\nobserved in the inelastic scattering data and a large linear term\n$\\gamma=6.3(8)$ mJmol$^{-1}$K$^{-2}$ in the specific heat is attributed to the\npresence of short range exchange interactions, which is understood to be\ncontributing to the observed ferroelectricity. Further the nuclear and magnetic\nentropies were computed to be, $\\sim$$17.2$ Jmol$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ and $\\sim$34\nJmol$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$, respectively. The entropy values are in excellent\nagreement with the limiting theoretical values. An anomaly is observed in peak\nposition of the temperature dependent crystal field spectra around 60 K, at the\nsame temperature an anomaly in the pyroelectric current is reported. From this\nwe could elucidate a direct correlation between the crystal electric field\nexcitations of Ho$^{3+}$ and ferroelectricity in HoCrO$_3$. Our present study\nalong with recent reports confirm that HoCrO$_3$, and $R$CrO$_3$ ($R=$ Rare\nearth) in general, possess more than one driving force for the ferroelectricity\nand multiferroicity.\n", "  This paper reports on the thermal properties of reduced graphite oxide (RGO)\nflakes, studied by means of scanning thermal microscopy (SThM). This technique\nwas demonstrated to allow thermal characterization of the flakes with a spatial\nresolution of the order of a few tens of nanometers, while recording nanoscale\ntopography at the same time. Several individual RGO flakes were analyzed by\nSThM, both as obtained after conventional thermal reduction and after a\nsubsequent annealing at 1700{\\deg}C. Significant differences in the thermal\nmaps were observed between pristine and annealed flakes, reflecting higher heat\ndissipation on annealed RGO flakes compared with pristine ones. This result was\ncorrelated with the reduction of RGO structure defectiveness. In particular, a\nsubstantial reduction of oxidized groups and sp3 carbons upon annealing was\nproven by X-ray photoelectron and Raman spectroscopies, while the increase of\ncrystalline order was demonstrated by X-ray diffraction, in terms of higher\ncorrelation lengths both along and perpendicular to the graphene planes.\nResults presented in this paper provide experimental evidence for the\nqualitative correlation between the defectiveness of graphene-related materials\nand their thermal conductivity, which is clearly crucial for the exploitation\nof these materials into thermally conductive nanocomposites.\n", "  Classical stochastic processes can be generated by quantum simulators instead\nof the more standard classical ones, such as hidden Markov models. One reason\nfor using quantum simulators is that they generally require less memory than\ntheir classical counterparts. Here, we examine this quantum advantage for\nstrongly coupled spin systems---the Dyson-like one-dimensional Ising spin chain\nwith variable interaction length. We find that the advantage scales with both\ninteraction range and temperature, growing without bound as interaction\nincreases. Thus, quantum systems can very efficiently simulate strongly coupled\nclassical systems.\n", "  Nontrivial properties of electronic states in topological insulators are\ninherent not only to the surface and boundary states, but to bound states\nlocalized at structure defects as well. We clarify how the unusual properties\nof the defect-induced bound states are manifested in optical absorption spectra\nin two-dimensional topological insulators. The calculations are carried out for\ndefects with short-range potential. We find that the defects give rise to the\nappearance of specific features in the absorption spectrum, which are an\ninherent property of topological insulators. They have the form of two or three\nabsorption peaks that are due to intracenter transitions between electron-like\nand hole-like bound states.\n", "  The full solution of the optimization problem giving the Gaussian capacity of\nthe single-mode fiducial Gaussian quantum channel is provided. Since it was\nshown that the Gaussian capacity of an arbitrary (phase-sensitive or\ninsensitive) single-mode Gaussian quantum channel is equal to the Gaussian\ncapacity of this fiducial channel, the solution presented in this work can be\nregarded as universal. The analytical study of this solution, below and above\nthe energy threshold, shows that the dependence of the Gaussian capacity on the\nenvironment noise squeezing is not monotonic. In particular, the capacity may\nhave a saddle point, one or two extrema at finite squeezing, or be a\nmonotonically increasing function of the squeezing parameter. The exact\ndependence is defined by the determinant of the noise covariance matrix and by\nthe transmissivity (or gain) of the fiducial Gaussian channel.\n", "  The Sun has a steady 11-year cycle in magnetic activity most well-known by\nthe rising and falling in the occurrence of dark sunspots on the solar disk in\nvisible bandpasses. The 11-year cycle is also manifest in the variations of\nemission in the Ca II H & K line cores, due to non-thermal (i.e. magnetic)\nheating in the lower chromosphere. The large variation in Ca II H & K emission\nallows for study of the patterns of long-term variability in other stars thanks\nto synoptic monitoring with the Mount Wilson Observatory HK photometers\n(1966-2003) and Lowell Observatory Solar-Stellar Spectrograph (1994-present).\nOverlapping measurements for a set of 27 nearby solar-analog (spectral types\nG0-G5) stars were used to calibrate the two instruments and construct time\nseries of magnetic activity up to 50 years in length. Precise properties of\nfundamental importance to the dynamo are available from Hipparcos, the\nGeneva-Copenhagen Survey, and CHARA interferometry. Using these long time\nseries and measurements of fundamental properties, we do a comparative study of\nstellar \"twins\" to explore the sensitivity of the stellar dynamo to small\nchanges to structure, rotation, and composition. We also compare this sample to\nthe Sun and find hints that the regular periodic variability of the solar cycle\nmay be rare among its nearest neighbors in parameter space.\n", "  The extragalactic $\\gamma$-ray sky is dominated by emission from blazars, a\npeculiar class of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Many of the $\\gamma$-ray\nsources included in Fermi -Large Area Telescope Third Source catalog (3FGL) are\nclassified as a blazar candidate of uncertain type (BCU) because there is no\noptical spectra available in the literature to confirm their nature. In 2013 we\nstarted a spectroscopic campaign to look for the optical counterparts of the\nBCUs and of the Unidentified $\\gamma$-ray Sources. The main goal of our\ninvestigation is to confirm the blazar nature of these sources having peculiar\nproperties as compact radio emission and/or selected on the basis of their\ninfrared (IR) colors. Whenever possible we also determine their redshifts. Here\nwe present the results of the observations carried out in the Northern\nhemisphere in 2013 and 2014 at Telescopio Nazionale Galilleo (TNG), Kitt Peak\nNational Observatory (KPNO) and Observatorio Astron\\'omico Nacional (OAN) in\nSan Pedro M\\'artir. In this paper we describe the optical spectra of 25\nsources. We confirmed that all the 15 BCUs observed in our campaign and\nincluded in our sample are blazars and we estimated the redshift for 3 of them.\nIn addition, we present the spectra for 3 sources classified as BL Lacs in the\nliterature but with no optical spectra available to date. We found that one of\nthem is a quasar (QSO) at a redshift $z$ = 0.208 and the other 2 are BL Lacs.\nMoreover, we also present 7 new spectra for known blazars listed in the\nRoma-BZCAT having an uncertain redshift or being classified as BL Lac\ncandidates. We found that one of them, 5BZB J0724+2621 is a `changing look'\nblazar. According to the spectrum available in the literature it was classified\nas a BL Lac but in our observation we clearly detected a broad emission line\nthat lead to classify this source as a QSO at $z$=1.17.\n", "  Numerical optimization was performed via COMSOL Multiphysics to maximize the\npolarization contrast of superconducting nanowire single photon detectors\n(SNSPDs). SNSPDs were integrated with four different types of one-dimensional\nperiodic plasmonic structures capable of mediating p-polarized photon\nselectivity to the niobium-nitride superconducting nanowire pattern.\nOptimization with two different criteria regarding the maximal tilting resulted\nin wavelength-scaled periodic integrated structures, which have different\ngeometrical parameters, and exhibit different polar angle dependent optical\nresponse and dispersion characteristics, as well as accompanying near-field\nphenomena at the extrema. Polarization contrast of 6.37*10^2 and 3.28*10^2 -\n6.86*10^11 and 1.42*10^11 - 1.81*10^13 and 7.87*10^12 - 1.90*10^3 and 1.15*10^5\ncan be achieved in nanocavity-, nanocavity-deflector-,\nnanocavity-double-deflector-, nanocavity-trench-array-integrated P-SNSPDs\noptimized with 85 degree and 80 degree criterion regarding the maximal tilting.\n", "  Graphs are powerful abstractions for capturing complex relationships in\ndiverse application settings. An active area of research focuses on theoretical\nmodels that define the generative mechanism of a graph. Yet given the\ncomplexity and inherent noise in real datasets, it is still very challenging to\nidentify the best model for a given observed graph. We discuss a framework for\ngraph model selection that leverages a long list of graph topological\nproperties and a random forest classifier to learn and classify different graph\ninstances. We fully characterize the discriminative power of our approach as we\nsweep through the parameter space of two generative models, the Erdos-Renyi and\nthe stochastic block model. We show that our approach gets very close to known\ntheoretical bounds and we provide insight on which topological features play a\ncritical discriminating role.\n", "  In this paper we examine more deeply about the bending mechanism of\nrod-shaped fireworks which burned from the free end. We derived new analytic\nequations. Surprisingly, we obtained the bending patterns are similar to the\ncornu spiral. With a few simple steps we proved that positions of points\nthroughout the fireworks are given by Fresnel integrals, C(x) and S(x), which\nare generally found in phenomena of electromagnetic wave diffraction. Although\nwe deeply discussed bending of fireworks rods, however the proposed method is\nlikely to explain any phenomena in nature related to an evolving length scale\nassociated with some material that becomes progressively stiff or dry, such as\nthe growth of resin exuded from trees.\n", "  We describe a revised collection of the number of sunspot groups from 1610 to\nthe present. This new collection is based on the work of Hoyt and Schatten\n(Solar Phys. 179, 189, 1998). The main changes are the elimination of a\nconsiderable number of observations during the Maunder Minimum (hereafter, MM)\nand the inclusion of several long series of observations. Numerous minor\nchanges are also described. Moreover, we have calculated the active-day\npercentage during the MM from this new collection as a reliable index of the\nsolar activity. Thus, the level of solar activity obtained in this work is\ngreater than the level obtained using the original Hoyt and Schatten data,\nalthough it remains compatible with a grand minimum of solar activity. The new\ncollection is available in digital format.\n", "  Given a set ${\\cal AL}$ of community detection algorithms and a graph $G$ as\ninputs, we propose two ensemble methods $\\mathtt{EnDisCO}$ and $\\mathtt{MeDOC}$\nthat (respectively) identify disjoint and overlapping communities in $G$.\n$\\mathtt{EnDisCO}$ transforms a graph into a latent feature space by leveraging\nmultiple base solutions and discovers disjoint community structure.\n$\\mathtt{MeDOC}$ groups similar base communities into a meta-community and\ndetects both disjoint and overlapping community structures. Experiments are\nconducted at different scales on both synthetically generated networks as well\nas on several real-world networks for which the underlying ground-truth\ncommunity structure is available. Our extensive experiments show that both\nalgorithms outperform state-of-the-art non-ensemble algorithms by a significant\nmargin. Moreover, we compare $\\mathtt{EnDisCO}$ and $\\mathtt{MeDOC}$ with a\nrecent ensemble method for disjoint community detection and show that our\napproaches achieve superior performance. To the best of our knowledge,\n$\\mathtt{MeDOC}$ is the first ensemble approach for overlapping community\ndetection.\n", "  Using one archival high dispersion high quality spectrum of HR8844 (A0V)\nobtained with the echelle spectrograph SOPHIE at Observatoire de Haute\nProvence, we show that this star is not a superficially normal A0V star as\nhitherto thought. The model atmosphere and spectrum synthesis modeling of the\nspectrum of HR8844 reveals large departures of its abundances from the solar\ncomposition. We report here on our first determinations of the elemental\nabundances of 41 elements in the atmosphere of HR8844. Most of the light\nelements are underabundant whereas the very heavy elements are overabundant in\nHR8844.This interesting new chemically peculiar star could be a hybrid object\nbetween the HgMn stars and the Am stars.\n", "  This paper makes use of a one-dimensional kinetic model to investigate the\nnonlinear longitudinal dynamics of electron beams generated in the plasma under\nthe influence of a self-generated electric field. It is expressed as where is a\nwave potential, , and charge particle distribution functions satisfy the Vlasov\nequation. It is proved that its correct solution is characterized by sudden\nchange in the resonant part of the distribution function. Hence, in particular,\nthe incorrectness of the established in the literature point of view follows\nthat the fast, with velocities over V, and slow, with velocities under V,\ntrapped particles are described by the same distribution function. Also for the\nfirst time it is shown that the self-generated strong electric field always\nproduces antitropic electron beams with the velocities much larger than the\nvalue V, including the cold plasma limit. The possibility of implementing a new\nclass of self-consistent wave structures with a nonzero average potential is\nshown. Maximum possible amplitude of a self-generated electric field in a\nstationary collisionless plasma is determined.\n", "  We demonstrate engineering of the spectral content and polarization of\nphotoluminescence (PL) from arrayed gold nanoparticles atop a\nsubwavelength-thin dielectric spacer and optically-thick gold film, a\nconfiguration that supports gap-surface plasmon resonances (GSPRs). Choice of\nshapes and dimensions of gold nanoparticles influences the GSPR wavelength and\npolarization characteristics, thereby allowing us to enhance and spectrally\nmold the plasmon-assisted PL while simultaneously controlling its polarization.\nIn order to understand the underlying physics behind the plasmon-enhanced PL,\nwe develop a simple model that faithfully reproduces all features observed in\nour experiments showing also good quantitative agreement for the PL enhancement\n", "  CO2 conversion into value-added products has gained significant interest over\nthe few last years, as the greenhouse gas concentrations constantly increase\ndue to anthropogenic activities. Here we report on experiments for CO2\nconversion by means of a cold atmospheric plasma using a cylindrical flowing\ndielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactor. A detailed comparison of this DBD\nignited in a so-called burst mode (i.e. where an AC voltage is applied during a\nlimited amount of time) and pure AC mode is carried out to evaluate their\neffect on the conversion of CO2 as well as on the energy efficiency. Decreasing\nthe duty cycle in the burst mode from 100% (i.e. corresponding to pure AC mode)\nto 40% leads to a rise in the conversion from 16--26% and to a rise in the\nenergy efficiency from 15 to 23%. Based on a detailed electrical analysis, we\nshow that the conversion correlates with the features of the microfilaments.\nMoreover, the root-mean-square voltage in the burst mode remains constant as a\nfunction of the process time for the duty cycles \\textless{}70%, while a higher\nduty cycle or the usual pure AC mode leads to a clear voltage decay by more\nthan 500 V, over approximately 90 s, before reaching a steady state regime. The\nhigher plasma voltage in the burst mode yields a higher electric field. This\ncauses the increasing the electron energy, and therefore their involvement in\nthe CO2 dissociation process, which is an additional explanation for the higher\nCO2 conversion and energy efficiency in the burst mode.\n", "  Dielectric barrier discharges (DBDs) are commonly used to generate cold\nplasmas at atmospheric pressure. Whatever their configuration (tubular or\nplanar), the presence of a dielectric barrier is mandatory to prevent too much\ncharge build up in the plasma and the formation of a thermal arc. In this\narticle, the role of the barrier thickness (2.0, 2.4 and 2.8 mm) and of the\nkind of dielectric material (alumina, mullite, pyrex, quartz) is investigated\non the filamentary behavior in the plasma and on the CO2 conversion in a\ntubular flowing DBD, by means of mass spectrometry measurements correlated with\nelectrical characterization and IR imaging. Increasing the barrier thickness\ndecreases the capacitance, while preserving the electrical charge. As a result,\nthe voltage over the dielectric increases and a larger number of\nmicrodischarges is generated, which enhances the CO2 conversion. Furthermore,\nchanging the dielectric material of the barrier, while keeping the same\ngeometry and dimensions, also affects the CO2 conversion. The highest CO2\nconversion and energy efficiency are obtained for quartz and alumina, thus not\nfollowing the trend of the relative permittivity. From the electrical\ncharacterization, we clearly demonstrate that the most important parameters are\nthe somewhat higher effective plasma voltage (yielding a somewhat higher\nelectric field and electron energy in the plasma) for quartz, as well as the\nhigher plasma current (and thus larger electron density) and the larger number\nof microdischarge filaments (mainly for alumina, but also for quartz). The\nlatter could be correlated to the higher surface roughness for alumina and to\nthe higher voltage over the dielectric for quartz.\n", "  The reactivity of water vapor introduced in the flowing post-discharge of an\nRF atmospheric plasma torch is investigated through electrical\ncharacterization, optical emission spectroscopy and mass spectrometry\nmeasurements. Due to the technical features of the plasma torch, the\npost-discharge can be considered as divided into two regions: an inner region\n(inside the plasma torch device) where the water vapor is injected and an outer\nregion which directly interacts with the ambient air. The main reactions\ninduced by the injection of water vapor are identified as well as those\nindicative of the influence of the ambient air. Plausible pathways allowing the\nproduction of H, OH, O radicals and H2O2 are discussed as well as reactions\npotentially responsible for inhomogeneities and for a low DC current measured\nin the flowing post-discharge. Keywords: atmospheric post-discharge, H2O plasma\nreactivity, RF plasma torch\n", "  In a previous article published in Phys. Rev. C 94 (2016) 014309 we have\nshown for the first time that the best dynamical trajectory during the\ndeformation toward fission of the superheavy nucleus $^{286}$Fl is a linearly\nincreasing radius of the light fragment, $R_2$. This macroscopic-microscopic\nresult reminds us about the $\\alpha $ or cluster preformation at the nuclear\nsurface, assumed already in 1928, and proved microscopically many times. This\ntime we give more detailed arguments for the neighboring nucleus $^{282}$Cn.\nAlso similar figures are presented for heavy nuclei $^{240}$Pu and $^{252}$Cf.\nThe deep minimum of total deformation energy near the surface is shown for the\nfirst time as a strong argument for cluster preformation.\n", "  We investigate the photon polarization tensor at finite temperature in the\npresence of a static and homogeneous external magnetic field. In our scheme,\nthe Matsubara frequency summation is performed after Poisson summation, which\nwill be taken easily and convergent quickly in the frame of proper time\nrepresentation. Moreover, the dependence of Landau levels is expressed\nexplicitly. It demonstrates the convergence of summing Landau levels as it has\nto be. Consequently, there is no necessary to truncate the Landau level in a\nnumerical estimation. At zero temperature, the Lowest Landau Level (LLL)\napproximation is analytically satisfied for the imaginary parts of the vacuum\nphoton polarization tensor. Our results examine that, the LLL approximation is\nnot enough for the thermal photon polarization tensor, it gains the\ncontribution not only from the lowest Landau level but also up to the\nfinite-$n$ levels. Such large imaginary ones only show up at finite\ntemperatures, which is the so called Landau damping. It originates from the\nabsorption of soft fields by hard plasma constituents, which is a universal\nfeature of plasma systems. Finally, it was argued that the summation of\nMatsubara frequency is not commuted with Landau level ones, such conjecture is\nexcluded in our calculations.\n", "  We study the force between two circular electrodes in different\nconfigurations. A formula analogous to Kelvin's formula for the spheres is\ngiven in the case of equal disks held at the same potential and when one plate\nis earthed. An expression for the force at short distance between two\narbitrarily charged disks is found: the generic case shows a logarithmic\nrepulsive force, also for disks carrying charges of opposite sign. Some\nnumerical computations support the results. A classification for the possible\nbehaviors of the force is proposed on the basis of a decomposition of the\ncapacitance matrix. It is shown that the forces depend strongly on the\ndimensionality of the contact zone between the conductors. The analysis is\nsupported by a numerical computation carried for the case of two disks of\ndifferent radii.\n", "  Interface engineering is an extremely useful tool for systematically\ninvestigating materials and the various ways materials interact with each\nother. We describe different interface engineering strategies designed to\nreveal the origin of the electric and magnetic dead-layer at La0.67Sr0.33MnO3\ninterfaces. La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 is a key example of a strongly correlated\nperoskite oxide material in which a subtle balance of competing interactions\ngives rise to a ferromagnetic metallic groundstate. This balance, however, is\neasily disrupted at interfaces. We systematically vary the dopant profile, the\ndisorder and the oxygen octahedra rotations at the interface to investigate\nwhich mechanism is responsible for the dead layer. We find that the magnetic\ndead layer can be completely eliminated by compositional interface engineering\nsuch that the polar discontinuity at the interface is removed. This, however,\nleaves the electrical dead-layer largely intact. We find that deformations in\nthe oxygen octahedra network at the interface are the dominant cause for the\nelectrical dead layer.\n", "  The structure of the recently identified metastable ice XVII, obtained by\nrelease of hydrogen from the C$_0$ D$_2$O-H$_2$ compound (filled ice), has been\naccurately measured by neutron powder diffraction. The diffraction pattern is\nindexed with a hexagonal cell and can be refined with space group $P6_122$ so\nto obtain accurate values of the oxygen and deuterium positions. The values of\nthe lattice constants at three temperatures between 25 to 100 K are reported,\nand their behavior is compared with that of ice Ih. Ice XVII is a porous solid\nthat, if exposed to H$_2$ gas, may adsorb a substantial amount of it.\nMonitoring this effect at a constant temperature of 50 K, we have observed that\nthe two lattice constants show opposite behavior, $a$ increases and $c$\ndecreases, with the volume showing a linear increase. At temperatures higher\nthan 130 K the metastability of this form of porous ice is lost and the sample\ntransforms into ice Ih.\n", "  The dark matter relic density being a powerful observable to constrain models\nof new physics, the recent experimental progress calls for more precise\ntheoretical predictions. On the particle physics side, improvements are to be\nmade in the calculation of the (co)annihilation cross-section of the dark\nmatter particle. We present the project DM@NLO which aims at calculating the\nneutralino (co)annihilation cross-section in the MSSM including radiative\ncorrections in QCD. In the present document, we briefly review selected results\nfor different (co)annihilation processes. We then discuss the estimation of the\nassociated theory uncertainty obtained by varying the renormalization scale.\nFinally, perspectives are discussed.\n", "  The structural and compositional stabilities of two dimensional 2D Bi2Te3 and\nBi2Se3 nanocrystals, produced by both colloidal synthesis and by liquid phase\nexfoliation, were studied by in situ transmission electron microscopy TEM\nduring annealing at temperatures between 350 and 500 C. The sublimation process\ninduced by annealing is structurally and chemically anisotropic and takes place\nthrough the preferential dismantling of the prismatic 011-0 type planes, and\nthrough the preferential sublimation of Te or Se.\n", "  This paper presents an initial exploration of high frequency records of\nextreme wind speed in two steps. The first consists in finding the suitable\nextreme distribution for $120$ measuring stations in Switzerland, by comparing\nthree known distributions: Weibull, Gamma, and Generalized extreme value. This\ncomparison serves as a basis for the second step which applies a spatial\nmodelling by using Extreme Learning Machine. The aim is to model distribution\nparameters by employing a high dimensional input space of topographical\ninformation. The knowledge of probability distribution gives a comprehensive\ninformation and a global overview of wind phenomena. Through this study, a\nflexible and a simple modelling approach is presented, which can be generalized\nto almost extreme environmental data for risk assessment and to model renewable\nenergy.\n", "  In this paper we introduce an intermediate field representation for random\nmatrices and random tensors with positive (stable) interactions of degree\nhigher than 4. This representation respects the symmetry axis responsible for\npositivity. It is non-perturbative and allows to prove that such models are\nBorel-Le Roy summable of the appropriate order in their coupling constant.\nHowever we have not been able yet to associate a convergent Loop Vertex\nExpansion to this representation, hence our Borel summability result is not of\nthe optimal expected form when the size N of the matrix or of the tensor tends\nto infinity.\n", "  While a significant body of investigations have been focused on the process\nof protein self-assembly, much less is understood about the reverse process of\na filament breaking due to thermal motion into smaller fragments, or\ndepolymerization of subunits from the filament ends. Indirect evidence for\nactin and amyloid filament fragmentation has been reported, although the\nphenomenon has never been directly observed either experimentally or in\nsimulations. Here we report the direct observation of filament depolymerization\nand breakup in a minimal, calibrated model of coarse-grained molecular\nsimulation. We quantify the orders of magnitude by which the depolymerization\nrate from the filament ends $k_\\mathrm{off}$ is larger than fragmentation rate\n$k_{-}$ and establish the law $k_\\mathrm{off}/k_- = \\exp [( \\varepsilon_\\| -\n\\varepsilon_\\bot) / k_\\mathrm{B}T ] = \\exp [0.5 \\varepsilon / k_\\mathrm{B}T ]$,\nwhich accounts for the topology and energy of bonds holding the filament\ntogether. This mechanism and the order-of-magnitude predictions are well\nsupported by direct experimental measurements of depolymerization of insulin\namyloid filaments.\n", "  We raise fundamental questions about the very meaning of conservation laws in\nquantum mechanics and we argue that the standard way of defining conservation\nlaws, while perfectly valid as far as it goes, misses essential features of\nnature and has to be revisited and extended.\n", "  Strongly confined surface plasmon-polariton modes can be used for efficiently\ndelivering the electromagnetic energy to nano-sized volumes by reducing the\ncross sections of propagating modes far beyond the diffraction limit, i.e., by\nnanofocusing. This process results in significant local-field enhancement that\ncan advantageously be exploited in modern optical nanotechnologies, including\nsignal processing, biochemical sensing, imaging and spectroscopy. Here, we\npropose, analyze, and experimentally demonstrate on-chip nanofocusing followed\nby impedance-matched nanowire antenna excitation in the end-fire geometry at\ntelecom wavelengths. Numerical and experimental evidences of the efficient\nexcitation of dipole and quadrupole (dark) antenna modes are provided,\nrevealing underlying physical mechanisms and analogies with the operation of\nplane-wave Fabry-P\\'erot interferometers. The unique combination of efficient\nnanofocusing and nanoantenna resonant excitation realized in our experiments\noffers a major boost to the field intensity enhancement up to $\\sim 12000$,\nwith the enhanced field being evenly distributed over the gap volume of\n$30\\times 30\\times 10\\ {\\rm nm}^3$, and promises thereby a variety of useful\non-chip functionalities within sensing, nonlinear spectroscopy and signal\nprocessing.\n", "  We examine the classical dynamics of multifield inflation models with\nquadratic potentials. Such models are shown to have inflationary attractors in\nphase space, consistent with the stretching of phase space trajectories along\nthe volume factor of the universe during inflation. Using the symplectic\nstructure associated with Hamiltonian systems we form a measure on the phase\nspace, as initially proposed by Gibbons, Hawking and Stewart. This is used to\ncalculate lower bounds on the probabilities of observational agreement (i.e.\nthe probability the model gives a value for the spectral index within the\nregion $n_{s}=0.968\\pm{0.006}$) for equal mass two and three field models with\nquadratic potentials, giving values of 0.982 and 0.997 respectively. We derive\nthe measure for a general $N$-field model and argue that as the number of\nfields approaches infinity, the probability of observational agreement\napproaches one.\n", "  We present the results of our recent study (arXiv:1510.08850) of the\ntheoretical uncertainties that affect the predictions for the Higgs-boson\ntransverse-momentum in gluon fusion when fixed- and all-order results are\nmatched. Our investigation consists of a twofold analysis: first we present a\ndetailed comparison of two recently introduced prescriptions for the\ndetermination of the matching scale (arXiv:1409.0531, arXiv:1505.00735), then\nwe apply the results of these methods to three widely used matching frameworks,\nnamely the aMC@NLO and POWHEG Monte Carlo approaches and analytic resummation.\nThe results of our study are applied to the production of the SM Higgs boson\nand of the neutral Higgs bosons of the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model in a variety of\nscenarios.\n", "  Accurate knowledge of the rovibronic near-infrared and visible spectra of\nvanadium monoxide (VO) is very important for studies of cool stellar and hot\nplanetary atmospheres. Here, the required ab initio dipole moment and\nspin-orbit coupling curves for VO are produced. This data forms the basis of a\nnew VO line list considering 13 different electronic states and containing over\n277 million transitions. Open shell transition, metal diatomics are challenging\nspecies to model through ab initio quantum mechanics due to the large number of\nlow-lying electronic states, significant spin-orbit coupling and strong static\nand dynamic electron correlation. Multi-reference configuration interaction\nmethodologies using orbitals from a complete active space self-consistent-field\n(CASSCF) calculation are the standard technique for these systems. We use\ndifferent state-specific or minimal-state CASSCF orbitals for each electronic\nstate to maximise the calculation accuracy. The off-diagonal dipole moment\ncontrols the intensity of electronic transitions. We test finite-field\noff-diagonal dipole moments, but found that (1) the accuracy of the excitation\nenergies were not sufficient to allow accurate dipole moments to be evaluated\nand (2) computer time requirements for perpendicular transitions were\nprohibitive. The best off-diagonal dipole moments are calculated using\nwavefunctions with different CASSCF orbitals.\n", "  We describe the colloidal hot-injection synthesis of phase-pure nanocrystals\n(NCs) of a highly abundant mineral, chalcopyrite (CuFeS2). Absorption bands\ncentered at around 480 and 950 nm, spanning almost the entire visible and near\ninfrared regions, encompass their optical extinction characteristics. These\npeaks are ascribable to electronic transitions from the valence band (VB) to\nthe empty intermediate band (IB), located in the fundamental gap and mainly\ncomposed of Fe 3d orbitals. Laser-irradiation (at 808 nm) of an aqueous\nsuspension of CuFeS2 NCs exhibited significant heating, with a photothermal\nconversion efficiency of 49%. Such efficient heating is ascribable to the\ncarrier relaxation within the broad IB band (owing to the indirect VB-IB gap),\nas corroborated by transient absorption measurements. The intense absorption\nand high photothermal transduction efficiency (PTE) of these NCs in the\nso-called biological window (650-900 nm) makes them suitable for photothermal\ntherapy as demonstrated by tumor cell annihilation upon laser irradiation. The\notherwise harmless nature of these NCs in dark conditions was confirmed by in\nvitro toxicity tests on two different cell lines. The presence of the deep Fe\nlevels constituting the IB is the origin of such enhanced PTE, which can be\nused to design other high performing NC photothermal agents.\n", "  Using in a simple way the theory of non linear dynamical systems, we show\nthat increasing climatic instabilities may be a qualitative warning sign for\nthe occurrence of a nearby bifurcation, yielding a discontinuous and sudden\nclimate tipping towards an unknown and unpredictable state. The possibility of\nan accurate prediction of the occurrence time of such a transition is also\ndiscussed in terms of the approach of a critical point.\n", "  Semi-Lagrangian schemes have proven to be very efficient to model advection\nproblems. However most semi-Lagrangian schemes are not conservative. Here, a\nsystematic method is introduced in order to enforce the conservative property\non a semi-Lagrangian advection scheme. This method is shown to generate\nconservative schemes with the same linear stability range and the same order of\naccuracy as the initial advection scheme from which they are derived. We used a\ncriterion based on the column-balance property of the schemes to assess their\nconservativity property. We show that this approach can be used with large CFL\nnumbers and third order schemes.\n", "  The Schmidt number is a fundamental parameter characterizing the properties\nof quantum states, and the local projections are a fundamental operation in\nquantum physics. We investigate the relation between the Schmidt numbers of\nbipartite states and their projected states. We show that there exist bipartite\npositive-partial-transpose (PPT) entangled states of any given Schmidt number.\nWe further construct the notion of joint Schmidt number for multipartite\nstates, and its relation with the Schmidt number of bipartite reduced density\noperators.\n", "  The STAR Collaboration and the CBM Collaboration institutions: Heidelberg,\nDarmstadt, CCNU, Tsinghua, and USTC propose to install an end-cap\ntime-of-flight upgrade (eTOF) to the STAR detector for the RHIC beam energy\nscan phase II (BES-II) program in 2019 and 2020. BES-II will cover the\ncollision energy range 3.0 to 19.6 GeV. This is the region of interest in the\nsearch for a critical point and first-order phase transition, identified by the\nresults from BES-I and by model calculations. For the collider-mode portion of\nthe energy scan, 7.7 to 19.6 GeV, eTOF will extend particle identification\n(PID) for pions, kaons, and protons to a rapidity of 1.2, complementing the\ninner Time Projection Chamber (iTPC) upgrade to the forward tracking. The\nrapidity coverage for PID would extend to only 0.8 without the eTOF upgrade.\nThe eTOF upgrade will enable precision studies of the key bulk property\nobservables, essential to the BES-II search. An internal fixed-target program\nwill allow the energy scan to cover 3.0 to 7.7 GeV. The eTOF upgrade will\nprovide essential mid-rapidity PID for the 4.5 to 7.7 GeV portion of the scan\nin fixed-target mode. Otherwise there would be a large energy gap in the middle\nof the BES-II program. A full description of the physics provided by the eTOF\nupgrade to STAR is presented in this note.\n", "  We discuss an improved detection scheme for a light-shining-through-wall\n(LSW) experiment for axion-like particle searches. We propose to use: gyrotrons\nor klystrons, which can provide extremely intense photon fluxes at frequencies\naround 30 GHz; transition-edge-sensors (TES) single photon detectors in this\nfrequency domain, with efficiency $\\approx1$; high quality factor Fabry-Perot\ncavities in the microwave domain, both on the photon-axion conversion and\nphoton regeneration sides. We compute that present laboratory exclusion limits\non axion-like particles might be improved by at least four orders of magnitude\nfor axion masses $\\lesssim 0.02$ meV.\n", "  We present a theoretical and numerical study on the motion of isotropic\nhelicoids in complex flows. These are particles whose motion is invariant under\nrotations but not under mirror reflections of the particle. This is the\nsimplest, yet unexplored, extension of the much studied case of small spherical\nparticles. We show that heavy isotropic helicoids, due to the coupling between\ntranslational and rotational degrees of freedom, preferentially sample\ndifferent helical regions in laminar or chaotic advecting flows. This opens the\nway to control and engineer particles able to track complex flow structures\nwith potential applications to microfluidics and turbulence.\n", "  The collinear factorization framework allows to describe the exclusive\nphotoproduction of a $\\gamma\\,\\rho$ pair in the generalized Bjorken regime in\nterms of a perturbatively calculable coefficient function and universal\ngeneralized parton distributions. The kinematics are defined by a large\ninvariant mass of the $\\gamma \\rho$ pair and a small transverse momentum of the\nfinal nucleon. We calculate the scattering amplitude at leading order in\n$\\alpha_s$ and the differential cross sections for the process where the\n$\\rho-$meson is either longitudinally or transversely polarized, in the\nkinematics of the near future Jlab experiments. Our estimate of the cross\nsection demonstrates that this process is measurable at JLab 12-GeV.\n", "  We propose a novel method of determination of the dust particle spatial\ndistribution in dust clouds that form in three-dimensional (3D) complex plasmas\nunder microgravity conditions. The method utilizes the data obtained during the\n3D scanning of a cloud and provides a reasonably good accuracy. Based on this\nmethod, we investigate the particle density in a dust cloud realized in gas\ndischarge plasma in the PK-3 Plus setup onboard the International Space\nStation. We find that the treated dust clouds are both anisotropic and\ninhomogeneous. One can isolate two regimes, in which a stationary dust cloud\ncan be observed. At low pressures, the particle density decreases monotonically\nwith the increase of the distance from the discharge center; at higher\npressures, the density distribution has a shallow minimum. Regardless of the\nregime, we detect a cusp of the distribution at the void boundary and a slowly\nvarying density at larger distances (in the foot region). A theoretical\ninterpretation of obtained results is developed that leads to reasonable\nestimates of the densities for both the cusp and foot. The modified ionization\nequation of state, which allows for violation of the local quasineutrality in\nthe cusp region, predicts the spatial distributions of ion and electron\ndensities to be measured in future experiments.\n", "  Coherent nanoscale photon sources are of paramount importance to achieving\nall-optical communication. Several nanolasers smaller than the diffraction\nlimit have been theoretically proposed and experimentally demonstrated using\nplasmonic cavities to confine optical fields. Such compact cavities exhibit\nlarge Purcell factors, thereby enhancing spontaneous emission, which feeds into\nthe lasing mode. However, most plasmonic nanolasers reported so far have\nemployed resonant nanostructures and therefore had the lasing restricted to the\nproximity of the resonance wavelength. Here, we report on an approach based on\ngold nanorod hyperbolic metamaterials for lasing. Hyperbolic metamaterials\nprovide broadband Purcell enhancement due to large photonic density of optical\nstates, while also supporting surface plasmon modes to deliver optical feedback\nfor lasing due to nonlocal effects in nanorod media. We experimentally\ndemonstrate the advantage of hyperbolic metamaterials in achieving lasing\naction by its comparison with that obtained in a metamaterial with elliptic\ndispersion. The conclusions from the experimental results are supported with\nnumerical simulations comparing the Purcell factors and surface plasmon modes\nfor the metamaterials with different dispersions. We show that although the\nmetamaterials of both types support lasing, emission with hyperbolic samples is\nabout twice as strong with 35% lower threshold vs. the elliptic ones. Hence,\nhyperbolic metamaterials can serve as a convenient platform of choice for\nnanoscale coherent photon sources in a broad wavelength range.\n", "  Virtually all clinical applications of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) require\nthe formulation of biocompatible, water-based magnetic colloids. For magnetic\nhyperthermia, the requirements also include a high colloidal stability against\nprecipitation and agglomeration of the constituent MNPs, in order to keep the\nheating efficiency of the ferrofluid in the long term. The specific power\nabsorption (SPA) of single-domain MNPs depends critically on the average\nparticle size and size distribution width, therefore first-rate reproducibility\namong different batches regarding these parameters are also needed. We have\nstudied the evolution of the SPA of highly reproducible and stable water-based\ncolloid composed of polymer coated $Fe_{3}O_{4}$ magnetic nanoparticles. By\nmeasuring the specific power absorption (SPA) values along one year as a\nfunction of field amplitude and frequencies ($H \\leq 24 kA/m$; $260 \\leq f \\leq\n830 kHz$), we demonstrated that SPA in these samples can be made reproducible\nbetween successive synthesis, and stable along several months, due to the in\nsitu polymer coating that provides colloidal stability and keeps dipolar\ninteractions negligible.\n", "  An analysis of null geodesics in Schwarzschild de Sitter space is presented\nwith special attention to their global `bending angles', local measurable\nangles, and the involvement of the cosmological constant. We make use of a\ngeneral technique which allows for finding observable intersection angles of\nnull trajectories analytically. A general relativistic aberration relationship\nis established as one of its applications. The question of whether or not the\ncosmological constant, $\\Lambda$, contributes to orbits of light and to related\nobservable quantities is addressed in detail. We also discuss the ongoing\ndebate on this issue and respond to some recent papers on the topic. The\ndependence of measurable quantities on the motion of observers is stressed\nthroughout. Exact formulas for measurable intersection angles, as well as\ngravitational lens equations for observers in the Schwarzschild de Sitter\nbackground are provided.\n", "  The enhancement of thermoelectric figure of merit ZT requires to either\nincrease the power factor or reduce the phonon conductance, or even both. In\ngraphene, the high phonon thermal conductivity is the main factor limiting the\nthermoelectric conversion. The common strategy to enhance ZT is therefore to\nintroduce phonon scatterers to suppress the phonon conductance while retaining\nhigh electrical conductance and Seebeck coefficient. Although thermoelectric\nperformance is eventually enhanced, all studies based on this strategy show a\nsignificant reduction of the electrical conductance, most often leading to a\nlower electronic performance. In this study we show that appropriate sources of\ndisorder, including isotopes and vacancies at lowest electron density\npositions, can be used as phonon scatterers to reduce the phonon conductance in\ngraphene ribbons without degrading the electrical conductance, particularly in\nthe low-energy region which is the most important range for device operation.\nBy means of atomistic calculations using semi-empirical Tight-Binding and Force\nConstant models in combination with Non-Equilibrium Green function formalism,\nwe show that the natural electronic properties of graphene ribbons can be fully\npreserved while their thermoelectric efficiency is strongly enhanced. For\nribbons of width M = 5 dimer lines, room-temperature ZT is enhanced from less\nthan 0.26 for defect-free ribbons to more than 2.5. This study is likely to set\nthe milestones of a new generation of nano-devices with dual electronic,\nthermoelectric functionalities.\n", "  I review new developments in Higgs physics, with a focus on Yukawa couplings\nin and beyond the standard model. In particular, I discuss different methods of\nmeasuring the light Yukawas, new sources of CP violation in the Higgs sector,\nand lepton flavor violation.\n"]}
