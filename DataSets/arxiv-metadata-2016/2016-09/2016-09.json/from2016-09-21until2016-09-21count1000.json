This study is\nrelevant for cold atomic systems, condensed matter physics and quark matter. In\nthis paper we consider this problem in the case the fermionic quasi-particles\ncan transmute into one another and only their total number is conserved. We use\na BCS approximation to study superconductivity in two-band metallic systems\nwith inter and intra-band interactions. Tuning the hybridization between the\nbands varies the mismatch of the Fermi surfaces and produces different\ninstabilities. For inter-band attractive interactions we find a first order\nnormal-superconductor and a homogeneous metastable phase with gapless\nexcitations. In the case of intra-band interactions, the transition from the\nsuperconductor to the normal state as hybridization increases is continuous and\nassociated with a quantum critical point. The case when both interactions are\npresent is also considered.\n", "  We discuss Stark deflectometry of micro-modulated molecular beams for the\nenrichment of biomolecular isomers as well as single-wall carbon nanotubes and\nwe demonstrate the working principle of this idea with fullerenes. The sorting\nis based on the species-dependent polarizability-to-mass ratio $\\alpha/m$. The\ndevice is compatible with a high molecular throughput, and the spatial\nmicro-modulation of the beam permits to obtain a fine spatial resolution and a\nhigh sorting sensitivity.\n", "  {The determination of cluster masses is a complex problem that would be aided\nby information about the cluster shape and orientation (along the\nline-of-sight).} {It is in this context, that we have developed a scheme for\nidentifying the intrinsic morphology and inclination of a cluster, by looking\nfor the signature of the true cluster characteristics in the inter-comparison\nof the different deprojected emissivity profiles (that all project to the same\nX-ray brightness distribution) and by using SZe data when available.} {We\ndeproject the cluster X-ray surface brightness profile under the assumptions of\nfour different geometry and inclination configurations for the observed system;\nthese 4 configurations correspond to four extreme geometry+inclination\nscenarios. The deprojection in question is performed by the non-parametric\nalgorithm DOPING. The formalism is tested with model systems and then is\napplied to a sample of 24 clusters. While the shape determination is possible\nby implementing the X-ray brightness alone, the estimation of the inclination\nis usually markedly improved by the usage of SZe data that is available for the\nconsidered sample.}{We spot 8 prolate systems, 1 oblate and 15 of the clusters\nin our sample as triaxial. In fact, for systems identified as triaxial, we are\nable to discern how the three semi-axes lengths compare with each other. This,\nwhen compounded by the information about the line-of-sight extent, allows us to\nconstrain the inclination quite tightly and offers the two intrinsic axial\nratios of the triaxial systems.}{}\n", "  Nanopores spanning synthetic membranes have been used as key components in\nproof-of-principle nanofluidic applications, particularly those involving\nmanipulation of biomolecules or sequencing of DNA. The only practical way of\nmanipulating charged macromolecules near nanopores is through a voltage\ndifference applied across the nanopore-spanning membrane. However, recent\nexperiments have shown that salt concentration gradients applied across\nnanopores can also dramatically enhance charged particle capture from a low\nconcentration reservoir of charged molecules at one end of the nanopore. This\npuzzling effect has hitherto eluded a physically consistent theoretical\nexplanation. Here, we propose an electrokinetic mechanism of this enhanced\ncapture that relies on the electrostatic potential near the pore mouth. For\nlong pores with diameter much greater than the local screening length, we\nobtain accurate analytic expressions showing how salt gradients control the\nlocal conductivity which can lead to increased local electrostatic potentials\nand charged analyte capture rates. We also find that the attractive\nelectrostatic potential may be balanced by an outward, repulsive electroosmotic\nflow (EOF) that can in certain cases conspire with the salt gradient to further\nenhance the analyte capture rate.\n", "  Successful exploitations of strongly confined surface plasmon-polaritons\ncritically rely on their efficient and rapid conversion to lossless channels.\nWe demonstrate a simple, robust, and broad-band butt-coupling technique for\nconnecting a metallic nanowire and a dielectric nanofiber. Conversion\nefficiencies above 95% in the visible and close to 100% in the near infrared\ncan be achieved with realistic parameters. Moreover, by combining butt-coupling\nwith nanofocusing, we propose a broad-band high-throughput near-field optical\nmicroscope.\n", "  Using a recently-proposed mathematical model for intercalation dynamics in\nphase-separating materials [Singh, Ceder, Bazant, Electrochimica Acta 53, 7599\n(2008)], we show that the spinodal and miscibility gaps generally shrink as the\nhost particle size decreases to the nano-scale. Our work is motivated by recent\nexperiments on the high-rate Li-ion battery material LiFePO4; this serves as\nthe basis for our examples, but our analysis and conclusions apply to any\nintercalation material. We describe two general mechanisms for the suppression\nof phase separation in nano-particles: (i) a classical bulk effect, predicted\nby the Cahn-Hilliard equation, in which the diffuse phase boundary becomes\nconfined by the particle geometry; and (ii) a novel surface effect, predicted\nby chemical-potential-dependent reaction kinetics, in which\ninsertion/extraction reactions stabilize composition gradients near surfaces in\nequilibrium with the local environment. Composition-dependent surface energy\nand (especially) elastic strain can contribute to these effects but are not\nrequired to predict decreased spinodal and miscibility gaps at the nano-scale.\n", "  Local electrical imaging using microwave impedance microscope is performed on\ngraphene in different modalities, yielding a rich hierarchy of the local\nconductivity. The low-conductivity graphite oxide and its derivatives show\nsignificant electronic inhomogeneity. For the conductive chemical graphene, the\nresidual defects lead to a systematic reduction of the microwave signals. In\ncontrast, the signals on pristine graphene agree well with a lumped-element\ncircuit model. The local impedance information can also be used to verify the\nelectrical contact between overlapped graphene pieces.\n", "  We study the transport properties of a quantum dot driven by either a\nrotating magnetic field or an ac gate voltage using the Floquet master-equation\napproach. Both types of ac driving lead to photon-assisted tunneling where\nquantized amounts of energy are exchanged with the driving field. It is found\nthat the differential-conductance peak due to photon-assisted tunneling does\nnot survive in the Coulomb-blockade regime when the dot is driven by a rotating\nmagnetic field. Furthermore, we generalize the MacDonald formula to calculate\nthe time-averaged noise spectra of ac-driven quantum dots. Besides the peak at\nzero frequency, the noise spectra show additional peaks or dips in the presence\nof an ac field. For the case of an applied ac gate voltage, the peak or dip\nposition is fixed at the driving frequency, whereas the position changes with\nincreasing amplitude for the case of a rotating magnetic field. Additional\nfeatures appear in the noise spectra if a dc magnetic field is applied in\naddition to a rotating field. In all cases, the peak or dip positions can be\nunderstood from the energy differences of two available Floquet channels.\n", "  The unique property of bilayer graphene to show a band gap tunable by\nexternal electrical fields enables a variety of different device concepts with\nnovel functionalities for electronic, optoelectronic and sensor applications.\nSo far the operation of bilayer graphene based field effect transistors\nrequires two individual gates to vary the channel's conductance and to create a\nband gap. In this paper we report on a method to increase the on/off ratio in\nsingle gated bilayer graphene field effect transistors by adsorbate doping. The\nadsorbate dopants on the upper side of the graphene establish a displacement\nfield perpendicular to the graphene surface breaking the inversion symmetry of\nthe two graphene layers. Low temperature measurements indicate, that the\nincreased on/off ratio is caused by the opening of a mobility gap. Beside field\neffect transistors the presented approach can also be employed for other\nbilayer graphene based devices like photodetectors for THz to infrared\nradiation, chemical sensors and in more sophisticated structures such as\nantidot- or superlattices where an artificial potential landscape has to be\ncreated.\n", "  Graphene plasmons provide a suitable alternative to noble-metal plasmons\nbecause they exhibit much larger confinement and relatively long propagation\ndistances, with the advantage of being highly tunable via electrostatic gating.\nWe report strong light- matter interaction assisted by graphene plasmons, and\nin particular, we predict unprecedented high decay rates of quantum emitters in\nthe proximity of a carbon sheet, large vacuum Rabi splitting and Purcell\nfactors, and extinction cross sections exceeding the geometrical area in\ngraphene ribbons and nanometer-sized disks. Our results provide the basis for\nthe emerging and potentially far-reaching field of graphene plasmonics,\noffering an ideal platform for cavity quantum electrodynamics and supporting\nthe possibility of single-molecule, single-plasmon devices.\n", "  We report an invisibility carpet cloak device, which is capable of making an\nobject undetectable by visible light. The cloak is designed using quasi\nconformal mapping and is fabricated in a silicon nitride waveguide on a\nspecially developed nano-porous silicon oxide substrate with a very low\nrefractive index. The spatial index variation is realized by etching holes of\nvarious sizes in the nitride layer at deep subwavelength scale creating a local\neffective medium index. The fabricated device demonstrates wideband\ninvisibility throughout the visible spectrum with low loss. This silicon\nnitride on low index substrate can also be a general scheme for implementation\nof transformation optical devices at visible frequency.\n", "  We present a Raman study of Ar(+)-bombarded graphene samples with increasing\nion doses. This allows us to have a controlled, increasing, amount of defects.\nWe find that the ratio between the D and G peak intensities for a given defect\ndensity strongly depends on the laser excitation energy. We quantify this\neffect and present a simple equation for the determination of the point defect\ndensity in graphene via Raman spectroscopy for any visible excitation energy.\nWe note that, for all excitations, the D to G intensity ratio reaches a maximum\nfor an inter-defect distance ~3nm. Thus, a given ratio could correspond to two\ndifferent defect densities, above or below the maximum. The analysis of the G\npeak width and its dispersion with excitation energy solves this ambiguity.\n", "  For a boundary CFT to give a good approximation to the bulk flat-space\nS-matrix, a number of conditions need to be satisfied: some of those are\ninvestigated here. In particular, one would like to identify an appropriate set\nof approximate asymptotic scattering states, constructed purely via boundary\ndata. We overview, elaborate, and simplify obstacles encountered with existing\nproposals for these. Those corresponding to normalizable wavefunctions undergo\nmultiple interactions; we contrast this situation with that needed for a\nflat-space LSZ treatment. Non-normalizable wavefunctions can have spurious\ninteractions, due either to power-law tails of wavepackets or to their\nnon-normalizable behavior, which obscure S-matrix amplitudes we wish to\nextract; although in the latter case we show that such gravitational\ninteractions can be finite, as a result of gravitational red shift. We outline\nan illustrative construction of arbitrary normalizable wavepackets from\nboundary data, that also yields such spurious interactions. Another set of\nnon-trivial questions regard the form of unitarity relations for the bulk\nS-matrix, and in particular its normalization and multi-particle cuts. These\ncombined constraints, together with those found earlier on boundary singularity\nstructure needed for bulk momentum conservation and other physical/analytic\nproperties, are a non-trivial collection of obstacles to surmount if a\nfine-grained S-matrix, as opposed to a coarse-grained construction, is to be\ndefined purely from boundary data.\n", "  We report the synthesis of a graphene-sulfur composite material by wrapping\npolyethyleneglycol (PEG) coated submicron sulfur particles with mildly oxidized\ngraphene oxide sheets decorated by carbon black nanoparticles. The PEG and\ngraphene coating layers are important to accommodating volume expansion of the\ncoated sulfur particles during discharge, trapping soluble polysulfide\nintermediates and rendering the sulfur particles electrically conducting. The\nresulting graphene-sulfur composite showed high and stable specific capacities\nup to ~600mAh/g over more than 100 cycles, representing a promising cathode\nmaterial for rechargeable lithium batteries with high energy density.\n", "  We examine the multiple exciton population dynamics in PbS quantum dots by\nultrafast spectrally-resolved supercontinuum transient absorption (SC-TA). We\nsimultaneously probe the first three excitonic transitions over a broad\nspectral range. Transient spectra show the presence of first order bleach of\nabsorption for the 1S_h-1S_e transition and second order bleach along with\nphotoinduced absorption band for 1P_h-1P_e transition. We also report evidence\nof the one-photon forbidden 1S_{h,e}-1P_{h,e} transition. We examine signatures\nof carrier multiplication (multiexcitons for the single absorbed photon) from\nanalysis of the first and second order bleaches, in the limit of low absorbed\nphoton numbers (<N_{abs}>~ 10^-2), at pump energies from two to four times the\nsemiconductor band gap. The multiexciton generation efficiency is discussed\nboth in terms of a broadband global fit and the ratio between early- to\nlong-time transient absorption signals.. Analysis of population dynamics shows\nthat the bleach peak due to the biexciton population is red-shifted respect the\nsingle exciton one, indicating a positive binding energy.\n", "  We investigated the thermal conductivity K of graphene ribbons and graphite\nslabs as the function of their lateral dimensions. Our theoretical model\nconsidered the anharmonic three-phonon processes to the second-order and\nincluded the angle-dependent phonon scattering from the ribbon edges. It was\nfound that the long mean free path of the long-wavelength acoustic phonons in\ngraphene can lead to an unusual non-monotonic dependence of the thermal\nconductivity on the length L of a ribbon. The effect is pronounced for the\nribbons with the smooth edges (specularity parameter p>0.5). Our results also\nsuggest that - contrary to what was previously thought - the bulk-like 3D\nphonons in graphite can make a rather substantial contribution to its in-plane\nthermal conductivity. The Umklapp-limited thermal conductivity of graphite\nslabs scales, for L below ~ 10 micrometers, as log(L) while for larger L, the\nthermal conductivity approaches a finite value following the dependence K_0 -\nA\\timesL^-1/2, where K_0 and A are parameters independent of the length. Our\ntheoretical results clarify the scaling of the phonon thermal conductivity with\nthe lateral sizes in graphene and graphite. The revealed anomalous dependence\nK(L) for the micrometer-size graphene ribbons can account for some of the\ndiscrepancy in reported experimental data for graphene.\n", "  By using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrated that\nthermal conductivity of Germanium nanowires can be reduced more than 25% at\nroom temperature by atomistic coating. There is a critical coating thickness\nbeyond which thermal conductivity of the coated nanowire is larger than that of\nthe host nanowire. The diameter dependent critical coating thickness and\nminimum thermal conductivity are explored. Moreover, we found that interface\nroughness can induce further reduction of thermal conductivity in coated\nnanowires. From the vibrational eigen-mode analysis, it is found that coating\ninduces localization for low frequency phonons, while interface roughness\nlocalizes the high frequency phonons. Our results provide an available approach\nto tune thermal conductivity of nanowires by atomic layer coating.\n", "  A homomorphism from a graph $X$ to a graph $Y$ is an adjacency preserving\nmapping $f:V(X) \\rightarrow V(Y)$. We consider a nonlocal game in which Alice\nand Bob are trying to convince a verifier with certainty that a graph $X$\nadmits a homomorphism to $Y$. This is a generalization of the well-studied\ngraph coloring game. Via systematic study of quantum homomorphisms we prove new\nresults for graph coloring. Most importantly, we show that the Lov\\'{a}sz theta\nnumber of the complement lower bounds the quantum chromatic number, which\nitself is not known to be computable. We also show that some of our newly\nintroduced graph parameters, namely quantum independence and clique numbers,\ncan differ from their classical counterparts while others, namely quantum odd\ngirth, cannot. Finally, we show that quantum homomorphisms closely relate to\nzero-error channel capacity. In particular, we use quantum homomorphisms to\nconstruct graphs for which entanglement-assistance increases their one-shot\nzero-error capacity.\n", "  We consider full counting statistics of spin in matrix product states. In\nparticular, we study the approach to gaussian distribution for magnetization.\nWe derive the asymptotic corrections to the central limit theorem for\nmagnetization distribution for finite but large blocks in analogy to the\nEdgeworth series. We also show how central limit theorem like behavior is\nmodified for certain states with topological characteristics such as the AKLT\nstate.\n", "  The existence of galaxy intrinsic clustering severely hampers the weak\nlensing reconstruction from cosmic magnification. In paper I \\citep{Yang2011},\nwe proposed a minimal variance estimator to overcome this problem. By utilizing\nthe different dependences of cosmic magnification and galaxy intrinsic\nclustering on galaxy flux, we demonstrated that the otherwise overwhelming\ngalaxy intrinsic clustering can be significantly suppressed such that lensing\nmaps can be reconstructed with promising accuracy. This procedure relies\nheavily on the accuracy of determining the galaxy bias from the same data.\nPaper I adopts an iterative approach, which degrades toward high redshift. The\ncurrent paper presents an alternative method, improving over paper I. We prove\nthat the measured galaxy clustering between flux bins allows for simultaneous\ndetermination of the lensing power spectrum and the flux dependence of galaxy\nbias, at this redshift bin. Comparing to paper I, the new approach is not only\nmore straightforward, but also more robust. It identifies an ambiguity in\ndetermining the galaxy bias and further discovers a mathematically robust way\nto suppress this ambiguity to non-negligible level ($\\sim 0.1%$). The\naccurately determined galaxy bias can then be applied to the minimal variance\nestimator proposed in paper I to improve the lensing map-making. The gain at\nhigh redshift is significant. These maps can be used to measure other\nstatistics, such as cluster finding and peak statistics. Furthermore, by\nincluding galaxy clustering measurement between different redshift bins, we can\nalso determine the lensing cross power spectrum between these bins, up to a\nsmall and correctable multiplicative factor.\n", "  We construct an integrable hierarchy in the form of Hirota quadratic\nequations (HQE) that governs the Gromov--Witten (GW) invariants of the Fano\norbifold projective curve $\\mathbb{P}^1_{a_1,a_2,a_3}$. The vertex operators in\nour construction are given in terms of the $K$-theory of\n$\\mathbb{P}^1_{a_1,a_2,a_3}$ via Iritani's $\\Gamma$-class modification of the\nChern character map. We also identify our HQEs with an appropriate\nKac--Wakimoto hierarchy of ADE type. In particular, we obtain a generalization\nof the famous Toda conjecture about the GW invariants of $\\mathbb{P}^1$ .\n", "  Radio emission in atmospheric showers is currently interpreted in terms of\nradiation due to the deviation of the charged particles in the magnetic field\nof the Earth and to the charge excess (Askaryan effect). Each of these\nmechanisms has a distinctive polarization. The complex signal patterns can be\nqualitatively explained as the interference (superposition) of the fields\ninduced by each mechanism. In this work we explicitly and quantitatively test a\nsimple phenomenological model based on this idea. The model is constructed by\nisolating each of the two components at the simulation level and by making use\nof approximate symmetries for each of the contributions separately. The results\nof the model are then checked against full ZHAireS Monte Carlo simulations of\nthe electric field calculated from first principles. We show that the simple\nmodel describes radio emission at a few percent level in a wide range of\nshower-observer geometries and on a shower-by-shower basis. As a consequence,\nthis approach provides a simple method to reduce the computing time needed to\naccurately predict the electric field of radio pulses emitted from air showers,\nwith many practical applications in experimental situations of interest.\n", "  We investigate the organized formation of strain, ripples and suspended\nfeatures in macroscopic CVD-prepared graphene sheets transferred onto a\ncorrugated substrate made of an ordered arrays of silica pillars of variable\ngeometries. Depending on the aspect ratio and sharpness of the corrugated\narray, graphene can conformally coat the surface, partially collapse, or lay,\nfakir-like, fully suspended between pillars over tens of micrometers. Upon\nincrease of pillar density, ripples in collapsed films display a transition\nfrom random oriented pleats emerging from pillars to ripples linking nearest\nneighboring pillars organized in domains of given orientation.\nSpatially-resolved Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy and electronic\nmicroscopy reveal uniaxial strain domains in the transferred graphene, which\nare induced and controlled by the geometry. We propose a simple theoretical\nmodel to explain the transition between suspended and collapsed graphene. For\nthe arrays with high aspect ratio pillars, graphene membranes stays suspended\nover macroscopic distances with minimal interaction with pillars tip apex. It\noffers a platform to tailor stress in graphene layers and open perspectives for\nelectron transport and nanomechanical applications.\n", "  We realized one dimensional disordered photonic structures by grouping high\nrefractive index layers in clusters, randomly distributed in such structure. We\nhave control on the maximum size of the cluster and on the ratio high-low\nrefractive index layers. By studying the average transmission as a function of\nthe maximum cluster size, we observe a trend with a minimum and very\ninteresting oscillations. Our results provide new insight in the physics of\nrandom systems.\n", "  The power spectrum of galaxy clusters is an important probe of the\ncosmological model. In this paper we determine the optimal weighting scheme for\nmaximizing the signal-to-noise ratio for such measurements. We find a closed\nform analytic expression for the optimal weights. Our expression takes into\naccount: cluster mass, finite survey volume effects, survey masking, and a flux\nlimit. The implementation of this weighting scheme requires knowledge of the\nmeasured cluster masses, and analytic models for the bias and space-density of\nclusters as a function of mass and redshift. Recent studies have suggested that\nthe optimal method for reconstruction of the matter density field from a set of\nclusters is mass-weighting (Seljak et al 2009, Hamaus et al 2010, Cai et al\n2011). We compare our optimal weighting scheme with this approach and also with\nthe original power spectrum scheme of Feldman et al (1994). We show that our\noptimal weighting scheme outperforms these approaches for both volume- and\nflux-limited cluster surveys. Finally, we present a new expression for the\nFisher information matrix for cluster power spectrum analysis. Our expression\nshows that for an optimally weighted cluster survey the cosmological\ninformation content is boosted, relative to the standard approach of Tegmark\n(1997).\n", "  We study the entanglement evolution of a quantum optical vortex state\npropagating through coupled lossless waveguides. We consider states generated\nby coupling two squeezed modes using a sequence of beam splitters and also by\nsubtracting photons from the signal in spontaneous parametric down conversion.\nWe reconstruct the Wigner function at a later time to study the correlation and\nquantify the entanglement after propagation using \\emph{logarithmic\nnegativity}.\n", "  A computational classification of contact symmetries and higher-order local\nsymmetries that do not commute with $t,x$, as well as local conserved densities\nthat are not invariant under $t,x$ is carried out for a generalized version of\nthe Krichever-Novikov equation. Several new results are obtained. First, the\nKrichever-Novikov equation is explicitly shown to have a local conserved\ndensity that contains $t,x$. Second, apart from the dilational point symmetries\nknown for special cases of the Krichever-Novikov equation and its generalized\nversion, no other local symmetries with low differential order are found to\ncontain $t,x$. Third, the basic Hamiltonian structure of the Krichever-Novikov\nequation is used to map the local conserved density containing $t,x$ into a\nnonlocal symmetry that contains $t,x$. Fourth, a recursion operator is applied\nto this nonlocal symmetry to produce a hierarchy of nonlocal symmetries that\nhave explicit dependence on $t,x$. When the inverse of the Hamiltonian map is\napplied to this hierarchy, only trivial conserved densities are obtained.\n", "  We study a class of quantized enveloping algebras, called twisted Yangians,\nassociated with the symmetric pairs of types B, C, D in Cartan's\nclassification. These algebras can be regarded as coideal subalgebras of the\nextended Yangian for orthogonal or symplectic Lie algebras. They can also be\npresented as quotients of a reflection algebra by additional symmetry\nrelations. We prove an analogue of the Poincare-Birkoff-Witt Theorem, determine\ntheir centres and study also extended reflection algebras.\n", "  The dynamics of heavy particles suspended in turbulent flows is of\nfundamental importance for a wide range of questions in astrophysics,\natmospheric physics, oceanography, and technology. Laboratory experiments and\nnumerical simulations have demonstrated that heavy particles respond in\nintricate ways to turbulent fluctuations of the carrying fluid: non-interacting\nparticles may cluster together and form spatial patterns even though the fluid\nis incompressible, and the relative speeds of nearby particles can fluctuate\nstrongly. Both phenomena depend sensitively on the parameters of the system.\nThis parameter dependence is difficult to model from first principles since\nturbulence plays an essential role. Laboratory experiments are also very\ndifficult, precisely since they must refer to a turbulent environment. But in\nrecent years it has become clear that important aspects of the dynamics of\nheavy particles in turbulence can be understood in terms of statistical models\nwhere the turbulent fluctuations are approximated by Gaussian random functions\nwith appropriate correlation functions. In this review we summarise how such\nstatistical-model calculations have led to a detailed understanding of the\nfactors that determine heavy-particle dynamics in turbulence. We concentrate on\nspatial clustering of heavy particles in turbulence. This is an important\nquestion because spatial clustering affects the collision rate between the\nparticles and thus the long-term fate of the system.\n", "  The leading hadronic contributions to the anomalous magnetic moments of the\nelectron and the $\\tau$-lepton are determined by a four-flavour lattice QCD\ncomputation with twisted mass fermions. The continuum limit is taken and\nsystematic uncertainties are quantified. Full agreement with results obtained\nby phenomenological analyses is found.\n", "  Field reversals are the most spectacular changes in the geomagnetic field but\nremain little understood. Paleomagnetic data primarily constrain the reversal\nrate and provide few additional clues. Reversals and excursions are\ncharacterized by a low in dipole moment that can last for some 10kyr. Some\npaleomagnetic records also suggest that the field decreases much slower before\nan reversals than it recovers afterwards and that the recovery phase may show\nan overshoot in field intensity. Here we study the dipole moment variations in\nseveral extremely long dynamo simulation to statistically explored the reversal\nand excursion properties. The numerical reversals are characterized by a switch\nfrom a high axial dipole moment state to a low axial dipole moment state. When\nanalysing the respective transitions we find that decay and growth have very\nsimilar time scales and that there is no overshoot. Other properties are\ngenerally similar to paleomagnetic findings. The dipole moment has to decrease\nto about 30% of its mean to allow for reversals. Grand excursions during which\nthe field intensity drops by a comparable margin are very similar to reversals\nand likely have the same internal origin. The simulations suggest that both are\nsimply triggered by particularly large axial dipole fluctuations while other\nfield components remain largely unaffected. A model at a particularly large\nEkman number shows a second but little Earth-like type of reversals where the\ntotal field decays and recovers after some time.\n", "  We consider the many-body localization-delocalization transition for strongly\ninteracting one- dimensional disordered bosons and construct the full picture\nof finite temperature behavior of this system. This picture shows two\ninsulator-fluid transitions at any finite temperature when varying the\ninteraction strength. At weak interactions an increase in the interaction\nstrength leads to insulator->fluid transition, and for large interactions one\nhas a reentrance to the insulator regime.\n", "  We present an updated description of the Planck Low Frequency Instrument\n(LFI) data processing pipeline, associated with the 2015 data release. We point\nout the places where our results and methods have remained unchanged since the\n2013 paper and we highlight the changes made for the 2015 release, describing\nthe products (especially timelines) and the ways in which they were obtained.\nWe demonstrate that the pipeline is self-consistent (principally based on\nsimulations) and report all null tests. For the first time, we present LFI maps\nin Stokes Q and U polarization. We refer to other related papers where more\ndetailed descriptions of the LFI data processing pipeline may be found if\nneeded.\n", "  This paper presents the characterization of the in-flight beams, the beam\nwindow functions, and the associated uncertainties for the Planck Low Frequency\nInstrument (LFI). The structure of the paper is similar to that presented in\nthe 2013 Planck release; the main differences concern the beam normalization\nand the delivery of the window functions to be used for polarization analysis.\nThe in-flight assessment of the LFI main beams relies on measurements performed\nduring observations of Jupiter. By stacking data from seven Jupiter transits,\nthe main beam profiles are measured down to -25 dB at 30 and 44 GHz, and down\nto -30 dB at 70 GHz. It has been confirmed that the agreement between the\nsimulated beams and the measured beams is better than 1% at each LFI frequency\nband (within the 20 dB contour from the peak, the rms values are 0.1% at 30 and\n70 GHz; 0.2% at 44 GHz). Simulated polarized beams are used for the computation\nof the effective beam window functions. The error budget for the window\nfunctions is estimated from both main beam and sidelobe contributions, and\naccounts for the radiometer band shapes. The total uncertainties in the\neffective beam window functions are 0.7% and 1% at 30 and 44 GHz, respectively\n(at $\\ell \\approx 600$); and 0.5% at 70 GHz (at $\\ell \\approx 1000$).\n", "  The Planck High Frequency Instrument (HFI) has observed the full sky at six\nfrequencies (100, 143, 217, 353, 545, and 857 GHz) in intensity and at four\nfrequencies in linear polarization (100, 143, 217, and 353 GHz). In order to\nobtain sky maps, the time-ordered information (TOI) containing the detector and\npointing samples must be processed and the angular response must be assessed.\nThe full mission TOI is included in the Planck 2015 release. This paper\ndescribes the HFI TOI and beam processing for the 2015 release. HFI calibration\nand map-making are described in a companion paper. The main pipeline has been\nmodified since the last release (2013 nominal mission in intensity only), by\nincluding a correction for the non-linearity of the warm readout and by\nimproving the model of the bolometer time response. The beam processing is an\nessential tool that derives the angular response used in all the Planck science\npapers and we report an improvement in the effective beam window function\nuncertainty of more than a factor 10 relative to the 2013 release. Noise\ncorrelations introduced by pipeline filtering function are assessed using\ndedicated simulations. Angular cross-power spectra using datasets that are\ndecorrelated in time are immune to the main systematic effects.\n", "  This paper describes the processing applied to the Planck High Frequency\nInstrument (HFI) cleaned, time-ordered information to produce photometrically\ncalibrated maps in temperature and (for the first time) in polarization. The\ndata from the entire 2.5 year HFI mission include almost five independent\nfull-sky surveys. HFI observes the sky over a broad range of frequencies, from\n100 to 857 GHz. To obtain the best accuracy on the calibration over such a\nlarge range, two different photometric calibration schemes have been used. The\n545 and 857 GHz data are calibrated using models of planetary atmospheric\nemission. The lower frequencies (from 100 to 353 GHz) are calibrated using the\ntime-variable cosmological microwave background dipole, which we call the\n\"orbital dipole\". This source of calibration only depends on the satellite\nvelocity with respect to the solar system. Using a CMB temperature of 2.7255\n+/- 0.0006 K, it permits an independent measurement of the amplitude of the CMB\nsolar dipole (3364.3 +/- 1.5 \\mu K) which is approximatively 1\\sigma\\ higher\nthan the WMAP measurement with a direction that is consistent between both\nexperiments. We describe the pipeline used to produce the maps of intensity and\nlinear polarization from the HFI timelines, and the scheme used to set the zero\nlevel of the maps a posteriori. We also summarize the noise characteristics of\nthe HFI maps in the 2015 Planck data release and present some null tests to\nassess their quality. Finally, we discuss the major systematic effects and in\nparticular the leakage induced by flux mismatch between the detectors that\nleads to spurious polarization signal.\n", "  We present results based on full-mission Planck observations of temperature\nand polarization anisotropies of the CMB. These data are consistent with the\nsix-parameter inflationary LCDM cosmology. From the Planck temperature and\nlensing data, for this cosmology we find a Hubble constant, H0= (67.8 +/- 0.9)\nkm/s/Mpc, a matter density parameter Omega_m = 0.308 +/- 0.012 and a scalar\nspectral index with n_s = 0.968 +/- 0.006. (We quote 68% errors on measured\nparameters and 95% limits on other parameters.) Combined with Planck\ntemperature and lensing data, Planck LFI polarization measurements lead to a\nreionization optical depth of tau = 0.066 +/- 0.016. Combining Planck with\nother astrophysical data we find N_ eff = 3.15 +/- 0.23 for the effective\nnumber of relativistic degrees of freedom and the sum of neutrino masses is\nconstrained to < 0.23 eV. Spatial curvature is found to be |Omega_K| < 0.005.\nFor LCDM we find a limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r <0.11 consistent\nwith the B-mode constraints from an analysis of BICEP2, Keck Array, and Planck\n(BKP) data. Adding the BKP data leads to a tighter constraint of r < 0.09. We\nfind no evidence for isocurvature perturbations or cosmic defects. The equation\nof state of dark energy is constrained to w = -1.006 +/- 0.045. Standard big\nbang nucleosynthesis predictions for the Planck LCDM cosmology are in excellent\nagreement with observations. We investigate annihilating dark matter and\ndeviations from standard recombination, finding no evidence for new physics.\nThe Planck results for base LCDM are in agreement with BAO data and with the\nJLA SNe sample. However the amplitude of the fluctuations is found to be higher\nthan inferred from rich cluster counts and weak gravitational lensing. Apart\nfrom these tensions, the base LCDM cosmology provides an excellent description\nof the Planck CMB observations and many other astrophysical data sets.\n", "  Full-sky CMB maps from the 2015 Planck release allow us to detect departures\nfrom global isotropy on the largest scales. We present the first searches using\nCMB polarization for correlations induced by a non-trivial topology with a\nfundamental domain intersecting, or nearly intersecting, the last scattering\nsurface (at comoving distance $\\chi_{rec}$). We specialize to flat spaces with\ntoroidal and slab topologies, finding that explicit searches for the latter are\nsensitive to other topologies with antipodal symmetry. These searches yield no\ndetection of a compact topology at a scale below the diameter of the last\nscattering surface. The limits on the radius $R_i$ of the largest sphere\ninscribed in the topological domain (at log-likelihood-ratio $\\Delta\\ln{L}>-5$\nrelative to a simply-connected flat Planck best-fit model) are\n$R_i>0.97\\chi_{rec}$ for the cubic torus and $R_i>0.56\\chi_{rec}$ for the slab.\nThe limit for the cubic torus from the matched-circles search is numerically\nequivalent, $R_i>0.97\\chi_{rec}$ (99% CL) from polarisation data alone. We also\nperform a Bayesian search for a Bianchi VII$_h$ geometry. In the non-physical\nsetting where the Bianchi cosmology is decoupled from the standard cosmology,\nPlanck temperature data favour the inclusion of a Bianchi component. However,\nthe cosmological parameters generating this pattern are in strong disagreement\nwith those found from CMB anisotropy data alone. Fitting the induced\npolarization pattern for this model to Planck data requires an amplitude of\n$-0.1\\pm0.04$ compared to +1 if the model were to be correct. In the physical\nsetting where the Bianchi parameters are fit simultaneously with the standard\ncosmological parameters, we find no evidence for a Bianchi VII$_h$ cosmology\nand constrain the vorticity of such models to $(\\omega/H)_0<7.6\\times10^{-10}$\n(95% CL). [Abridged]\n", "  We have constructed all-sky y-maps of the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ)\neffect by applying specifically tailored component separation algorithms to the\n30 to 857 GHz frequency channel maps from the Planck satellite survey. These\nreconstructed y-maps are delivered as part of the Planck 2015 release. The\ny-maps are characterised in terms of noise properties and residual foreground\ncontamination, mainly thermal dust emission at large angular scales and CIB and\nextragalactic point sources at small angular scales. Specific masks are defined\nto minimize foreground residuals and systematics. Using these masks we compute\nthe y-map angular power spectrum and higher order statistics. From these we\nconclude that the y-map is dominated by tSZ signal in the multipole range,\n20-600. We compare the measured tSZ power spectrum and higher order statistics\nto various physically motivated models and discuss the implications of our\nresults in terms of cluster physics and cosmology.\n", "  We prove chaos in temperature for even $p$-spin models which include\nsufficiently many $p$-spin interaction terms. Our approach is based on a new\ninvariance property for coupled asymptotic Gibbs measures, similar in spirit to\nthe invariance property that appeared in the proof of ultrametricity in\narXiv:1112.1003, used in combination with Talagrand's analogue of Guerra's\nreplica symmetry breaking bound for coupled systems.\n", "  We report a theoretical study of a quantum optical model consisting of an\narray of strongly nonlinear cavities incoherently pumped by an ensemble of\npopulation-inverted two-level atoms. Projective methods are used to eliminate\nthe atomic dynamics and write a generalized master equation for the photonic\ndegrees of freedom only, where the frequency-dependence of gain introduces\nnon-Markovian features. In the simplest single cavity configuration, this\npumping scheme gives novel optical bistability effects and allows for the\nselective generation of Fock states with a well-defined photon number. For many\ncavities in a weakly non-Markovian limit, the non-equilibrium steady state\nrecovers a Grand-Canonical statistical ensemble at a temperature determined by\nthe effective atomic linewidth. For a two-cavity system in the strongly\nnonlinear regime, signatures of a Mott state with one photon per cavity are\nfound.\n", "  An inhomogeneous random recursive lattice was constructed from the\nmulti-branched Husimi square lattice. The number of repeating units connected\non one vertex was randomly set to be 2 or 3 with a quenched ratio $P_2$ or\n$P_3$ with $P_2+P_3=1$. The model was designed to describe complex\nthermodynamic systems with variable coordinating neighbors, e.g. the\ncross-dimensional range around the surface of a bulk materials. Classical\nferromagnetic spin-1 Ising model was solved on the lattice to achieve an\nannealed solution via the local exact calculation technique. The model exhibits\ndistinct spontaneous magnetization similar to the deterministic system, with\nhowever rigorous thermal fluctuations and significant singularities on the\nentropy behavior around the critical temperature, indicating a complex\nsuperheating and supercooling frustration in the cross-dimensional range\ninduced by the stochasticity. The critical temperature was found to be\nexponentially correlated to the structural ratio $P$ with the coefficient\nfitted as 0.53187, while the ground state energy presents linear relation to\n$P$, implying a well-defined average property according to the structural\nratio.\n", "  We conjecture a sharp bound on the rate of growth of chaos in thermal quantum\nsystems with a large number of degrees of freedom. Chaos can be diagnosed using\nan out-of-time-order correlation function closely related to the commutator of\noperators separated in time. We conjecture that the influence of chaos on this\ncorrelator can develop no faster than exponentially, with Lyapunov exponent\n$\\lambda_L \\le 2 \\pi k_B T/\\hbar$. We give a precise mathematical argument,\nbased on plausible physical assumptions, establishing this conjecture.\n", "  In this paper we shall focus on the effects of concrete models such as SM and\nModel III of 2HDM on the polarized and unpolarized forward-backward asymmetries\nof $\\overline{B}\\rightarrow \\overline{K}_0^{*}(1430) \\ell^+\\ell^-$ and\n$\\overline{B}\\rightarrow \\overline{K} \\ell^+\\ell^-$ decays. The obtained\nresults of these decay modes are compared to each other. Also, we obtain the\nminimum required number of events for detecting each asymmetry and compare them\nwith the number of produced $B\\bar{B}$ pairs at the LHC or supposed to be\nproduced at the Super-LHC. At the end, we conclude that the study of these\nasymmetries for $\\overline{B}\\rightarrow \\overline{K}_0^*(1430) \\ell^+\\ell^-$\nand $\\overline{B}\\rightarrow \\overline{K} \\ell^+\\ell^-$ processes are very\neffective tools for establishing new physics in the future B-physics\nexperiments.\n", "  A detection at the Large Hadron Collider of a light Higgs pseudoscalar would,\nif interpreted in a supersymmetric framework, be a smoking gun signature of\nnon-minimal supersymmetry. In this work in the framework of the Next-to-Minimal\nSupersymmetric Standard Model we focus on vector boson fusion and\nHiggs-strahlung production of heavier scalars that subsequently decay into\npairs of light pseudoscalars. We demonstrate that although these channels have\nin general very limited reach, they are viable for the detection of light\npseudoscalars in some parts of parameter space and can serve as an important\ncomplementary probe to the dominant gluon-fusion production mode. We also\ndemonstrate that in a Higgsfactory these channels may reach sensitivities\ncomparable to or even exceeding the gluon fusion channels at the LHC, thus\npossibly rendering this our best option to discover a light pseudoscalar. It is\nalso worth mentioning that for the singlet dominated scalar this may be the\nonly way to measure its couplings to gauge bosons. Especially promising are\nchannels where the initial scalar is radiated off a W as these events have\nrelatively high rates and provide substantial background suppression due to\nleptons from the W. We identify three benchmark points that well represent the\nabove scenarios. Assuming that the masses of the scalars and pseudoscalars are\nalready measured in the gluon-fusion channel, the event kinematics can be\nfurther constrained, hence significantly improving detection prospects. This is\nespecially important in the Higgs-strahlung channels with rather heavy scalars,\nand results in possible detection at 200/fb for the most favoured parts of the\nparameter space.\n", "  Chiral magnetic interactions induce complex spin textures including helical\nand conical spin waves, as well as particle-like objects such as magnetic\nskyrmions and merons. These spin textures are the basis for innovative device\nparadigms and give rise to exotic topological phenomena, thus being of interest\nfor both applied and fundamental sciences. Present key questions address the\ndynamics of the spin system and emergent topological defects. Here we analyze\nthe micromagnetic dynamics in the helimagnetic phase of FeGe. By combining\nmagnetic force microscopy, single-spin magnetometry, and\nLandau-Lifschitz-Gilbert simulations we show that the nanoscale dynamics are\ngoverned by the depinning and subsequent motion of magnetic edge dislocations.\nThe motion of these topologically stable objects triggers perturbations that\ncan propagate over mesoscopic length scales. The observation of stochastic\ninstabilities in the micromagnetic structure provides new insight to the\nspatio-temporal dynamics of itinerant helimagnets and topological defects, and\ndiscloses novel challenges regarding their technological usage.\n", "  In this paper, we try to understand the geometry for a nonlocal nonlinear\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation (nonlocal NLS) and its discrete version introduced by\nAblowitz and Musslimani. We show that, under the gauge transformations, the\nnonlocal focusing NLS and the nonlocal defocusing NLS are, respectively, gauge\nequivalent to a Heisenberg-like equation and a modified Heisenberg-like\nequation, and their discrete versions are, respectively, gauge equivalent to a\ndiscrete Heisenberg-like equation and a discrete modified Heisenberg-like\nequation. From the gauge equivalence, although the geometry related to the\nnonlocal NLS is not very clear, we can see that the properties between the\nnonlocal NLS and its discrete version and NLS and discrete NLS have big\ndifference. By constructing the Darboux transformation for discrete nonlocal\nNLS equations including the cases of focusing and defocusing, we derive their\ndiscrete soliton solutions, which differ from the ones obtained by using the\nscattering transformation.\n", "  Five-dimensional (5D) space-time symmetry greatly facilitates how a 4D\nobserver perceives the propagation of a single spinless particle in a 5D\nspace-time. In particular, if the 5D geometry is independent of the fifth\ncoordinate then the 5D physics may be interpreted as 4D quantum mechanics. In\nthis work we address the case where symmetry is approximate, focusing on the\ncase where the 5D geometry depends weakly on the fifth coordinate. We show that\nconcepts developed for the case of exact symmetry approximately hold when other\nconcepts such as decaying quantum states, resonant quantum scattering and\nStokes drag are adopted, as well. We briefly comment on the optical model of\nthe nuclear interactions and Millikan's oil drop experiment.\n", "  We present a reconstructions of galaxy-cluster-scale mass distributions from\nsimulated gravitational lensing data sets including strong lensing, weak\nlensing shear, and measurements of quadratic image distortions -- flexion. The\nlensing data is constructed to make a direct comparison between mass\nreconstructions with and without flexion. We show that in the absence of\nflexion measurements, significant galaxy-group scale substructure can remain\nundetected in the reconstructed mass profiles, and that the resulting profiles\nunderestimate the aperture mass in the substructure regions by $\\sim25-40\\%$.\nWhen flexion is included, subhaloes down to a mass of $\\sim3\\times10^{12}$\nM$_\\odot$ can be detected at an angular resolution smaller than 10\\arcsec.\nAperture masses from profiles reconstructed with flexion match the input\ndistribution values to within an error of $\\sim13\\%$, including both\nstatistical error and scatter. This demonstrates the important constraint that\nflexion measurements place on substructure in galaxy clusters and its utility\nfor producing high-fidelity mass reconstructions.\n", "  We study the conjecture made by Chang, Minwalla, Sharma, and Yin on the\nduality between the N=6 Vasiliev higher spin theory on AdS_4 and the N=6\nChern-Simons-matter theory, so-called ABJ theory, with gauge group U(N) x\nU(N+M). Building on our earlier results on the ABJ partition function, we\ndevelop the systematic 1/M expansion, corresponding to the weak coupling\nexpansion in the higher spin theory, and compare the leading 1/M correction,\nwith our proposed prescription, to the one-loop free energy of the N=6 Vasiliev\ntheory. We find an agreement between the two sides up to an ambiguity that\nappears in the bulk one-loop calculation.\n", "  Studies on symmetric extendibility of quantum states become especially\nimportant in a context of analysis of one-way quantum measures of entanglement,\ndistilabillity and security of quantum protocols. In this paper we analyse\ncomposite systems containing a symmetric extendible part with a particular\nattention devoted to one-way security of such systems. Further, we introduce a\nnew one-way monotone based on the best symmetric approximation of quantum\nstate. We underpin those results with geometric observations on structures of\nmulti-party settings which posses in sub-spaces substantial symmetric\nextendible components. Finally, we state a very important conjecture linking\nsymmetric-extendibility with one-way distillability and security of all quantum\nstates analyzing behavior of private key in neighborhood of symmetric\nextendible states.\n", "  In this article, the third of three, we analyse how the Weyl quantisation for\ncompact Lie groups presented in the second article of this series fits with the\nprojective-phase space structure of loop quantum gravity-type models. Thus, the\nproposed Weyl quantisation may serve as the main mathematical tool to implement\nthe program of space adiabatic perturbation theory in such models. As we\nalready argued in our first article, space adiabatic perturbation theory offers\nan ideal framework to overcome the obstacles that hinder the direct\nimplementation of the conventional Born-Oppenheimer approach in the canonical\nformulation of loop quantum gravity.\n", "  We use the combinatorics of toric networks and the double affine geometric\n$R$-matrix to define a three-parameter family of generalizations of the\ndiscrete Toda lattice. We construct the integrals of motion and a spectral map\nfor this system. The family of commuting time evolutions arising from the\naction of the $R$-matrix is explicitly linearized on the Jacobian of the\nspectral curve. The solution to the initial value problem is constructed using\nRiemann theta functions.\n", "  Context. Recent observations of solar prominences show the presence of\nturbulent flows that may be caused by Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilites (KHI).\nHowever, the observed flow velocities are below the classical threshold for the\nonset of KHI in fully ionized plasmas.\n  Aims. We investigate the effect of partial ionization on the onset of KHI in\ndense and cool cylindrical magnetic flux tubes surrounded by a hotter and\nlighter environment.\n  Methods. The linearized governing equations of a partially ionized two-fluid\nplasma are used to describe the behavior of small-amplitude perturbations\nsuperimposed on a magnetic tube with longitudinal mass flow. A normal mode\nanalysis is performed to obtain the dispersion relation for linear\nincompressible waves. We focus on the appearance of unstable solutions and\nstudy the dependence of their growth rates on various physical parameters. An\nanalytical approximation of the KHI linear growth rate for slow flows and\nstrong ion-neutral coupling is obtained. An application to solar prominence\nthreads is given.\n  Results. The presence of a neutral component in a plasma may contribute to\nthe onset of the KHI even for sub-Alfv\\'enic longitudinal shear flows.\nCollisions between ions and neutrals reduce the growth rates of the unstable\nperturbations but cannot completely suppress the instability.\n  Conclusions. Turbulent flows in solar prominences with sub-Alfv\\'enic flow\nvelocities may be interpreted as consequences of KHI in partially ionized\nplasmas.\n", "  I review the effective field theory approach to LHC Higgs data.\n", "  Relic abundance of asymmetric Dark Matter particles in brane world\ncosmological scenario is investigated in this article. Hubble expansion rate is\nenhanced in brane world cosmology and it affects the relic abundance of\nasymmetric Dark Matter particles. We analyze how the relic abundance of\nasymmetric Dark Matter is changed in this model. We show that in such kind of\nnonstandard cosmological scenario, indirect detection of asymmetric Dark Matter\nis possible if the cross section is small enough which let the anti--particle\nabundance kept in the same amount with the particle. We show the indirect\ndetection signal constraints can be used to such model only when the cross\nsection and the 5 dimensional Planck mass scale are in appropriate values.\n", "  The paper contains description of the main properties of the galactic dark\nmatter (DM) particles, available approaches for detection of DM, main features\nof direct DM detection, ways to estimate prospects for the DM detection, the\nfirst collider search for a DM candidate within an Effective Field Theory,\ncomplete review of ATLAS results of the DM candidate search with LHC RUN I, and\nless complete review of \"exotic\" dark particle searches with other accelerators\nand not only. From these considerations it follows that one is unable to prove,\nespecially model-independently,a discovery of a DM particle with an\naccelerator, or collider. One can only obtain evidence on existence of a weakly\ninteracting neutral particle, which could be, or could not be the DM candidate.\nThe current LHC DM search program uses only the missing transverse energy\nsignature. Non-observation of any excess above Standard Model expectations\nforces the LHC experiments to enter into the same fighting for the best\nexclusion curve, in which (almost) all direct and indirect DM search\nexperiments permanently take place. But this fighting has very little (almost\nnothing) to do with a real possibility of discovering a DM particle. The true\nDM particles possess an exclusive galactic signature --- annual modulation of a\nsignal, which is accessible today only for direct DM detection experiments.\nThere is no way for it with a collider, or accelerator. Therefore to prove the\nDM nature of a collider-discovered candidate one must find the candidate in a\ndirect DM experiment and demonstrate the galactic signature for the candidate.\nFurthermore, being observed, the DM particle must be implemented into a modern\ntheoretical framework. The best candidate is the supersymmetry, which looks\ntoday inevitable for coherent interpretation of all available DM data.\n", "  We use the Arepo moving mesh code to simulate the evolution of molecular\nclouds exposed to a harsh environment similar to that found in the galactic\ncenter (GC), in an effort to understand why the star formation efficiency (SFE)\nof clouds in this environment is so small. Our simulations include a simplified\ntreatment of time-dependent chemistry and account for the highly non-isothermal\nnature of the gas and the dust. We model clouds with a total mass of 1.3x10^5\nM_{sun} and explore the effects of varying the mean cloud density and the\nvirial parameter, alpha = E_{kin}/|E_{pot}|. We vary the latter from alpha =\n0.5 to alpha = 8.0, and so many of the clouds that we simulate are\ngravitationally unbound. We expose our model clouds to an interstellar\nradiation field (ISRF) and cosmic ray flux (CRF) that are both a factor of 1000\nhigher than the values found in the solar neighbourhood. As a reference, we\nalso run simulations with local solar neighbourhood values of the ISRF and the\nCRF in order to better constrain the effects of the extreme conditions in the\nGC on the SFE. Despite the harsh environment and the large turbulent velocity\ndispersions adopted, we find that all of the simulated clouds form stars within\nless than a gravitational free-fall time. Increasing the virial parameter from\nalpha = 0.5 to alpha = 8.0 decreases the SFE by a factor ~4-10, while\nincreasing the ISRF/CRF by a factor of 1000 decreases the SFE again by a factor\n~2-6. However, even in our most unbound clouds, the SFE remains higher than\nthat inferred for real GC clouds. We therefore conclude that high levels of\nturbulence and strong external heating are not enough by themselves to lead to\na persistently low SFE at the center of the Galaxy.\n", "  Diamonds are very promising candidates for the neutron diagnostics in harsh\nenvironments such as fusion reactor. In the first place this is because of\ntheir radiation hardness, exceeding that of Silicon by an order of magnitude.\nAlso, in comparison to the standard on-line neutron diagnostics (fission\nchambers, silicon based detectors, scintillators), diamonds are less sensitive\nto $\\gamma$ rays, which represent a huge background in fusion devices. Finally,\ntheir low leakage current at high temperature suppresses the detector intrinsic\nnoise. In this talk a CVD diamond based detector has been proposed for the\nmeasurement of the 14 MeV neutrons from D-T fusion reaction. The detector was\narranged in a proton recoil telescope configuration, featuring a plastic\nconverter in front of the sensitive volume in order to induce the (n,p)\nreaction. The segmentation of the sensitive volume, achieved by using two\ncrystals, allowed to perform measurements in coincidence, which suppressed the\nneutron elastic scattering background. A preliminary prototype was assembled\nand tested at FNG (Frascati Neutron Generator, ENEA), showing promising results\nregarding efficiency and energy resolution.\n", "  We study the Ginzburg-Landau equations in the presence of large electric\ncurrents, that are smaller than the critical current where the normal state\nlosses its stability. For steady-state solutions in the large $\\kappa$ limit,\nwe prove that the superconductivity order parameter is exponentially small in a\nsignificant part of the domain, and small in the rest of it. Similar results\nare obtained for the time-dependent problem, in continuation of the paper by\nthe two first authors [3]. We conclude by obtaining some weaker results, albeit\nsimilar, for steady-state solutions in the large domain limit.\n", "  The spherical Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model is a spherical mean field model\nfor spin glass. We consider the fluctuations of the free energy at arbitrary\nnon-critical temperature for the 2-spin model with no magnetic field. We show\nthat in the high temperature regime the law of the fluctuations converges to\nthe Gaussian distribution just like in the Sherrington-Kirtkpatrick model. We\nshow, on the other hand, that the law of the fluctuations is given by the GOE\nTracy-Widom distribution in the low temperature regime. The orders of the\nfluctuations are markedly different in these two regimes. A universality of the\nlimit law is also proved.\n", "  We present a description of the pipeline used to calibrate the Planck Low\nFrequency Instrument (LFI) timelines into thermodynamic temperatures for the\nPlanck 2015 data release, covering four years of uninterrupted operations. As\nin the 2013 data release, our calibrator is provided by the spin-synchronous\nmodulation of the cosmic microwave background dipole, but we now use the\norbital component, rather than adopting the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy\nProbe (WMAP) solar dipole. This allows our 2015 LFI analysis to provide an\nindependent Solar dipole estimate, which is in excellent agreement with that of\nHFI and within $1\\sigma$ (0.3% in amplitude) of the WMAP value. This 0.3% shift\nin the peak-to-peak dipole temperature from WMAP and a global overhaul of the\niterative calibration code increases the overall level of the LFI maps by 0.45%\n(30 GHz), 0.64% (44 GHz), and 0.82% (70 GHz) in temperature with respect to the\n2013 Planck data release, thus reducing the discrepancy with the power spectrum\nmeasured by WMAP. We estimate that the LFI calibration uncertainty is now at\nthe level of 0.20% for the 70 GHz map, 0.26% for the 44 GHz map, and 0.35% for\nthe 30 GHz map. We provide a detailed description of the impact of all the\nchanges implemented in the calibration since the previous data release.\n", "  We explore the implications of monojet searches at hadron colliders in the\nminimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM). To quantify the\nimpact of monojet searches, we consider simplified MSSM scenarios with\nneutralino dark matter. The monojet results of the LHC Run 1 are reinterpreted\nin the context of several MSSM simplified scenarios, and the complementarity\nwith direct supersymmetry search results is highlighted. We also investigate\nthe reach of monojet searches for the Run 2, as well as for future higher\nenergy hadron colliders.\n", "  In the present work, we conduct large-scale orbital-free DFT calculations to\nstudy the energetics of vacancy clustering in aluminum from electronic\nstructure calculations. The simulation domains considered in this study are as\nlarge as those containing a million atoms to accurately account for both the\nelectronic structure and long-ranged elastic fields. Our results indicate that\nvacancy clustering is an energetically favorable mechanisms with positive\nbinding energies for a range of vacancy clusters considered in the present\nstudy. In particular, the $19$ vacancy hexagonal cluster lying in $\\{111\\}$\nplane has a very large binding energy with the relaxed atomic structure\nrepresentative of a prismatic dislocation loop. This suggests that vacancy\nprismatic loops as small as those formed from 19 vacancies are stable, thus\nproviding insights into the nucleation sizes of these defects in aluminum.\n", "  We propose a model of the Earth's torqueless precession, the \"Chandler\nwobble\", as a self-oscillation driven by positive feedback between the wobble\nand the centrifugal deformation of the portion of the Earth's mass contained in\ncirculating fluids. The wobble may thus run like a heat engine, extracting\nenergy from heat-powered geophysical circulations whose natural periods would\notherwise be unrelated to the wobble's observed period of about fourteen\nmonths. This can explain, more plausibly than previous models based on\nstochastic perturbations or forced resonance, how the wobble is maintained\nagainst viscous dissipation. The self-oscillation is a deterministic process,\nbut stochastic variations in the magnitude and distribution of the circulations\nmay turn off the positive feedback (a Hopf bifurcation), accounting for the\noccasional extinctions, followed by random phase jumps, seen in the data. This\nmodel may have implications for broader questions about the relation between\nstochastic and deterministic dynamics in complex systems, and the statistical\nanalysis thereof.\n", "  We propose field equations for the conformal higher spin system in three\ndimensions coupled to a conformal scalar field with a sixth order potential.\nBoth the higher spin equation and the unfolded equation for the scalar field\nhave source terms and are based on a conformal higher spin algebra which we\ntreat as an expansion in multi-commutators. Explicit expressions for the source\nterms are suggested and subjected to some simple tests. We also discuss a\ncascading relation between the Chern-Simons action for the higher spin gauge\ntheory and an action containing a term for each spin that generalizes the spin\n2 Chern-Simons action in terms of the spin connection expressed in terms of the\nframe field. This cascading property is demonstrated in the free theory for\nspin 3 but should work also in the complete higher spin theory.\n", "  We consider a classical fermion and a classical scalar, propagating on two\ndifferent kinds of 4-dimensional diffeomorphism breaking gravity backgrounds,\nand we derive the one-loop effective dispersion relation for matter, after\nintegrating out gravitons. One gravity model involves quadratic divergences at\none-loop, as in Einstein gravity, and the other model is the $z=3$\nnon-projectable Horava-Lifshitz gravity, which involves logarithmic divergences\nonly. Although these two models behave differently in the UV, the IR\nphenomenology for matter fields is comparable: {\\it(i)} for generic values for\nthe parameters, both models identify $10^{10}$ GeV as the typical\ncharacteristic scale above which they are not consistent with current upper\nbounds on Lorentz symmetry violation; {\\it(ii)} on the other hand there is\nalways, for both models, a fine-tuning of parameters which allows the\ncancellation of the indicator for Lorentz symmetry violation.\n", "  We quantitatively analyze a familiar classroom demonstration, Van\nWaltenhofen's eddy current pendulum, to predict the damping effect for a\nvariety of plate geometries from first principles. Results from conformal\nmapping, finite element simulations and a simplified model suitable for\nintroductory classes are compared with experiments.\n", "  (abridged) We discuss the Galactic foreground emission between 20 and 100GHz\nbased on observations by Planck/WMAP. The Commander component-separation tool\nhas been used to separate the various astrophysical processes in total\nintensity. Comparison with RRL templates verifies the recovery of the free-free\nemission along the Galactic plane. Comparison of the high-latitude Halpha\nemission with our free-free map shows residuals that correlate with dust\noptical depth, consistent with a fraction (~30%) of Halpha having been\nscattered by high-latitude dust. We highlight a number of diffuse spinning dust\nmorphological features at high latitude. There is substantial spatial variation\nin the spinning dust spectrum, with the emission peak ranging from below 20GHz\nto more than 50GHz. There is a strong tendency for the spinning dust component\nnear many prominent HII regions to have a higher peak frequency, suggesting\nthat this increase in peak frequency is associated with dust in the\nphotodissociation regions around the nebulae. The emissivity of spinning dust\nin these diffuse regions is of the same order as previous detections in the\nliterature. Over the entire sky, the commander solution finds more anomalous\nmicrowave emission than the WMAP component maps, at the expense of synchrotron\nand free-free emission. This can be explained by the difficulty in separating\nmultiple broadband components with a limited number of frequency maps. Future\nsurveys (5-20GHz), will greatly improve the separation by constraining the\nsynchrotron spectrum. We combine Planck/WMAP data to make the highest S/N ratio\nmaps yet of the intensity of the all-sky polarized synchrotron emission at\nfrequencies above a few GHz. Most of the high-latitude polarized emission is\nassociated with distinct large-scale loops and spurs, and we re-discuss their\nstructure...\n", "  We test the statistical isotropy and Gaussianity of the cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB) anisotropies using observations made by the Planck satellite.\nOur results are based mainly on the full Planck mission for temperature, but\nalso include some polarization measurements.\n  In particular, we consider the CMB anisotropy maps derived from the\nmulti-frequency Planck data by several component-separation methods. For the\ntemperature anisotropies, we find excellent agreement between results based on\nthese sky maps over both a very large fraction of the sky and a broad range of\nangular scales, establishing that potential foreground residuals do not affect\nour studies.\n  Tests of skewness, kurtosis, multi-normality, N-point functions, and\nMinkowski functionals indicate consistency with Gaussianity, while a power\ndeficit at large angular scales is manifested in several ways, for example low\nmap variance. The results of a peak statistics analysis are consistent with the\nexpectations of a Gaussian random field. The \"Cold Spot\" is detected with\nseveral methods, including map kurtosis, peak statistics, and mean temperature\nprofile. We thoroughly probe the large-scale dipolar power asymmetry, detecting\nit with several independent tests, and address the subject of a posteriori\ncorrection. Tests of directionality suggest the presence of angular clustering\nfrom large to small scales, but at a significance that is dependent on the\ndetails of the approach. We perform the first examination of polarization data,\nfinding the morphology of stacked peaks to be consistent with the expectations\nof statistically isotropic simulations. Where they overlap, these results are\nconsistent with the Planck 2013 analysis based on the nominal mission data and\nprovide our most thorough view of the statistics of the CMB fluctuations to\ndate.\n", "  We investigate elementary topological properties of sets of completely\npositive (CP) maps that arise in quantum Perron-Frobenius theory. We prove that\nthe set of primitive CP maps of fixed Kraus rank is path-connected and we\nprovide a complete classification of the connected components of irreducible CP\nmaps at given Kraus rank and fixed peripheral spectrum in terms of a\nmultiplicity index. These findings are then applied to analyse 1D quantum\nphases by studying equivalence classes of translational invariant Matrix\nProduct States that correspond to the connected components of the respective CP\nmaps. Our results extend the previously obtained picture in that they do not\nrequire blocking of physical sites, they lead to analytic paths and they allow\nto decompose into ergodic components and to study the breaking of translational\nsymmetry.\n", "  The ${\\cal N} =1$ supersymmetric mKdV-B system is transformed to a system of\ncoupled bosonic equations by using the bosonization approach. The bosonized\nsupersymmetric mKdV-B (BSmKdV-B) equation can be solved by the usual mKdV\nequation together with a linear differential equations without fermionic\nvariables. The bosonization approach can thus effectively avoid difficulties\ncaused by anticommutative fermionic fields of the supersymmetric systems. The\nconsistent tanh expansion (CTE) method is applied to the BSmKdV-B equation. An\nauto-B\\\"{a}cklund (BT) theorem is obtained by using CTE method. The interaction\nsolutions among solitons and other complicated waves including Painlev\\'{e}\nwaves and periodic cnoidal waves are given through an auto-BT theorem. For the\nsoliton-cnoidal interaction solution, two concrete cases are investigated both\nin analytical and graphical ways by combining the mapping and deformation\nmethod.\n", "  In this review, we discuss recent experiments that investigate how the\nquantum sate of a superconducting qubit evolves during measurement. We provide\na pedagogical overview of the measurement process, when the qubit is\ndispersively coupled to a microwave frequency cavity, and the qubit state is\nencoded in the phase of a microwave tone that probes the cavity. A continuous\nmeasurement record is used to reconstruct the individual quantum trajectories\nof the qubit state, and quantum state tomography is performed to verify that\nthe state has been tracked accurately. Furthermore, we discuss ensembles of\ntrajectories, time-symmetric evolution, two-qubit trajectories, and potential\napplications in measurement-based quantum error correction.\n", "  We report on the measurement of ground state atomic polarization relaxation\ntile of Rb vapor confined in five different hypocycloidal core shape Kagome\nhollow core photonic crystal fibers made with uncoated silica glass. We are\nable to distinguish between wall-collision and transit-time effects in optical\nwaveguide and deduce the contribution of the atom's dwell time at the core wall\nsurface. In contrast with convetional macroscopic atomic cell configuration,\nand in agreement with Monte Carlo simulations, the measured relaxation times\nwere found to be at least one order of magnitude longer than the limit set by\nthe atom-wall collisional relaxation from thermal atoms. This extended\nrelaxation time is explained by the combination of a stronger contribution of\nthe slow atoms in the atomic polarization build-up, and of the relatively\nsignificant contribution of dwell time to the relaxation process of the ground\nstate polarization.\n", "  The aim of this paper is to explore warm inflation in the background of\n$f(\\mathcal{G})$ theory of gravity using scalar fields for the FRW universe\nmodel. We construct the field equations under slow-roll approximations and\nevaluate the slow-roll parameters, scalar and tensor power spectra and their\ncorresponding spectral indices using viable power-law model. These parameters\nare evaluated for a constant as well as variable dissipation factor during\nintermediate and logamediate inflationary epochs. We also find the number of\ne-folds and tensor-scalar ratio for each case. The graphical behavior of these\nparameters proves that the isotropic model in $f(\\mathcal{G})$ gravity is\ncompatible with observational Planck data.\n", "  ATP-driven microtubule-kinesin bundles can self-assemble into two-dimensional\nactive liquid crystals (ALCs) that exhibit a rich creation and annihilation\ndynamics of topological defects, reminiscent of particle-pair production\nprocesses in quantum systems. This recent discovery has sparked considerable\ninterest but a quantitative theoretical description is still lacking. We\npresent and validate a minimal continuum theory for this new class of active\nmatter systems by generalizing the classical Landau-de Gennes free-energy to\naccount for the experimentally observed spontaneous buckling of motor-driven\nextensile microtubule bundles. The resulting model agrees with recently\npublished data and predicts a regime of antipolar order. Our analysis implies\nthat ALCs are governed by the same generic ordering principles that determine\nthe non-equilibrium dynamics of dense bacterial suspensions and elastic bilayer\nmaterials. Moreover, the theory manifests an energetic analogy with strongly\ninteracting quantum gases. Generally, our results suggest that complex\nnon-equilibrium pattern-formation phenomena might be predictable from a few\nfundamental symmetry-breaking and scale-selection principles.\n", "  In this article, we review Electroweak Phase transition and some related\nphenomena.\n", "  Since its introduction in 2001, natural time analysis has been applied to\ndiverse fields with remarkable results. Its validity has not been doubted by\nany publication to date. Here, we indicate that frequently asked questions on\nthe motivation and the foundation of natural time analysis are directly\nanswered if one takes into account the following two key points that we have\nconsidered as widely accepted when natural time analysis was proposed: First,\nthe aspects on the energy of a system forwarded by Max Planck in his Treatise\non Thermodynamics. Second, the theorem on the characteristic functions of\nprobability distributions which Gauss called Ein Sch\\\"ones Theorem der\nWahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung (beautiful theorem of probability calculus). The\ncase of the time series of earthquakes and of the precursory Seismic Electric\nSignals are discussed as typical examples.\n", "  This paper presents the Planck 2015 likelihoods, statistical descriptions of\nthe 2-point correlations of CMB data, using the hybrid approach employed\npreviously: pixel-based at $\\ell<30$ and a Gaussian approximation to the\ndistribution of spectra at higher $\\ell$. The main improvements are the use of\nmore and better processed data and of Planck polarization data, and more\ndetailed foreground and instrumental models, allowing further checks and\nenhanced immunity to systematics. Progress in foreground modelling enables a\nlarger sky fraction. Improvements in processing and instrumental models further\nreduce uncertainties. For temperature, we perform an analysis of end-to-end\ninstrumental simulations fed into the data processing pipeline; this does not\nreveal biases from residual instrumental systematics. The $\\Lambda$CDM\ncosmological model continues to offer a very good fit to Planck data. The slope\nof primordial scalar fluctuations, $n_s$, is confirmed smaller than unity at\nmore than 5{\\sigma} from Planck alone. We further validate robustness against\nspecific extensions to the baseline cosmology. E.g., the effective number of\nneutrino species remains compatible with the canonical value of 3.046. This\nfirst detailed analysis of Planck polarization concentrates on E modes. At low\n$\\ell$ we use temperature at all frequencies and a subset of polarization. The\nfrequency range improves CMB-foreground separation. Within the baseline model\nthis requires a reionization optical depth $\\tau=0.078\\pm0.019$, significantly\nlower than without high-frequency data for explicit dust monitoring. At high\n$\\ell$ we detect residual errors in E, typically O($\\mu$K$^2$); we recommend\ntemperature alone as the high-$\\ell$ baseline. Nevertheless, Planck high-$\\ell$\npolarization allows a separate determination of $\\Lambda$CDM parameters\nconsistent with those from temperature alone.\n", "  We are developing monolithic pixel detectors based on SOI technology for high\nenergy physics, X-ray applications and so on.To employ SOI pixel detector on\nsuch radiation environments, we have to solve effects of total ionizing dose\n(TID) for transistors which are enclosed in oxide layer.The holes which are\ngenerated and trapped in the oxide layers after irradiation affect\ncharacteristics of near-by transistors due to its positive electric\nfield.Annealing and radiation of ultraviolet are not realistic to remove\ntrapped holes for a fabricated detector due to thermal resistance of components\nand difficulty of handling. We studied compensation of TID effects by tunneling\nusing a high-voltage. For decrease of trapped holes, applied high-voltage to\nburied p-well which is under oxide layer to inject the electrons into the oxide\nlayer.In this report, recent progress of this study is shown.\n", "  We introduce a new project to understand helium reionization using fully\ncoupled $N$-body, hydrodynamics, and radiative transfer simulations. This\nproject aims to capture correctly the thermal history of the intergalactic\nmedium (IGM) as a result of reionization and make predictions about the\nLyman-$\\alpha$ forest and baryon temperature-density relation. The dominant\nsources of radiation for this transition are quasars, so modeling the source\npopulation accurately is very important for making reliable predictions. In\nthis first paper, we present a new method for populating dark matter halos with\nquasars. Our set of quasar models include two different light curves, a\nlightbulb (simple on/off) and symmetric exponential model, and\nluminosity-dependent quasar lifetimes. Our method self-consistently reproduces\nan input quasar luminosity function (QLF) given a halo catalog from an $N$-body\nsimulation, and propagates quasars through the merger history of halo hosts.\nAfter calibrating quasar clustering using measurements from BOSS, we find that\nthe characteristic mass of quasar hosts is $M_h \\sim 2.5 \\times 10^{12}\nM_\\odot$ $h^{-1}$ for the lightbulb model, and $M_h \\sim 2.3 \\times 10^{12}\nM_\\odot$ $h^{-1}$ for the exponential model. In the exponential model, the peak\nquasar luminosity for a given halo mass is larger than that in the lightbulb\nmodel, typically by a factor of 1.5-2. The effective lifetime for quasars in\nthe lightbulb model is 59 Myr, and in the exponential case, the effective time\nconstant is about 15 Myr. We include semi-analytic calculations of helium\nreionization, and discuss how to include these quasars as sources of ionizing\nradiation for full hydrodynamics with radiative transfer simulations in order\nto study helium reionization.\n", "  It has been observed that the composite fermion (CF) approach tends to\novercount the number of linearly independent candidate states for fixed sets of\nquantum numbers [number of particles, total angular momentum, and (pseudo)spin\nif applicable]. That is, CF Slater determinants that are orthogonal before\nprojection, may lead to wave functions that are identical, or possess linear\ndependencies, after projection. This has been pointed out both in the context\nof rotating bosons in the lowest Landau level, and for excited bands of the\n(fermionic) fractional quantum Hall effect. We present a systematic approach\nthat enables us to reveal all linear dependencies between bosonic compact\nstates in the lowest CF \"cyclotron energy\" sub-band, and almost all\ndependencies in higher sub-bands, at the level of the CF Slater determinants,\ni.e. before projection, which implies a major computational simplification. Our\napproach is introduced for so-called simple states of two-species rotating\nbosons, and then generalised to generic compact bosonic states, both one- and\ntwo-species. Some perspectives also apply to fermionic systems. The identities\nand linear dependencies we find, are analytically exact for \"brute force\"\nprojection in the disk geometry.\n", "  We show how to find the coefficient by the leading term of the resonance\nasymptotics using the method of pseudo orbit expansion for quantum graphs which\ndo not obey the Weyl asymptotics. For a non-Weyl graph we develop a method how\nto reduce the number of edges of a corresponding directed graph. Through this\nmethod we prove bounds on the above coefficient depending on the structure of\nthe graph for graphs with the same lengths of internal edges. We explicitly\nfind the positions of the resolvent resonances.\n", "  Maximum entropy models provide the least constrained probability\ndistributions that reproduce statistical properties of experimental datasets.\nIn this work we characterize the learning dynamics that maximizes the\nlog-likelihood in the case of large but finite datasets. We first show how the\nsteepest descent dynamics is not optimal as it is slowed down by the\ninhomogeneous curvature of the model parameters space. We then provide a way\nfor rectifying this space which relies only on dataset properties and does not\nrequire large computational efforts. We conclude by solving the long-time limit\nof the parameters dynamics including the randomness generated by the systematic\nuse of Gibbs sampling. In this stochastic framework, rather than converging to\na fixed point, the dynamics reaches a stationary distribution, which for the\nrectified dynamics reproduces the posterior distribution of the parameters.\n  We sum up all these insights in a \"rectified\" Data-Driven algorithm that is\nfast and by sampling from the parameters posterior avoids both under- and\nover-fitting along all the directions of the parameters space. Through the\nlearning of pairwise Ising models from the recording of a large population of\nretina neurons, we show how our algorithm outperforms the steepest descent\nmethod.\n", "  We are developing monolithic pixel sensors based on a 0.2 $\\mu$m\nfully-depleted Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) technology for HEP experiment\napplications. The total ionizing dose (TID) effect is the major issue in the\napplications for hard radiation environments in HEP experiments. To compensate\nfor TID damage, we have introduced a Double SOI structure which has a Middle\nSilicon layer (SOI2 layer) in addition. We studied the recovery from TID damage\ninduced by $\\mathrm{^{60}Co}~\\gamma$'s and other characteristics of an\nIntegration-type Double SOI sensor. The Double SOI sensor irradiated to 100 kGy\nshowed a response for IR laser similar to of a non-irradiated sensor when we\napplied a negative voltage to the SOI2 layer. We conclude that the Double SOI\nsensor is radiation hard enough to be used in HEP experiments in harsh\nradiation environments such as at Bell II or ILC.\n", "  More than a decade ago Edwin Taylor issued a \"call to action\" that presented\nthe case for basing introductory university mechanics teaching around the\nprinciple of stationary action. We report on our response to that call in the\nform of an investigation of the teaching and learning of the stationary action\nformulation of physics in a first-year university course. Our action physics\ninstruction proceeded from the many-paths approach to quantum physics through\nto ray optics, classical mechanics, and relativity. Despite the challenges\npresented by action physics, students reported it to be accessible,\ninteresting, motivational and valuable.\n", "  Some of the most arduous and error-prone aspects of precision resummed\ncalculations are related to the partonic hard process, having nothing to do\nwith the resummation. In particular, interfacing to parton-distribution\nfunctions, combining various channels, and performing the phase space\nintegration can be limiting factors in completing calculations. Conveniently,\nhowever, most of these tasks are already automated in many Monte Carlo\nprograms, such as MadGraph, Alpgen or Sherpa. In this paper, we show how such\nprograms can be used to produce distributions of partonic kinematics with\nassociated color structures representing the hard factor in a resummed\ndistribution. These distributions can then be used to weight convolutions of\njet, soft and beam functions producing a complete resummed calculation. In\nfact, only around 1000 unweighted events are necessary to produce precise\ndistributions. A number of examples and checks are provided, including $e^+e^-$\ntwo- and four-jet event shapes, $n$-jettiness and jet-mass related observables\nat hadron colliders. Attached code can be used to modify MadGraph to export the\nrelevant leading-order hard functions and color structures for arbitrary\nprocesses.\n", "  We are developing further our earlier suggestion to use hyperbolic Anosov\nC-systems for the Monte-Carlo simulations in high energy particle physics. The\nhyperbolic dynamical systems have homogeneous instability of all trajectories\nand as such they have mixing of all orders, countable Lebesgue spectrum and\npositive Kolmogorov entropy. These extraordinary ergodic properties follow from\nthe C-condition introduced by Anosov. The C-condition defines a rich class of\ndynamical systems which span an open set in the space of all dynamical systems.\nThe important property of C-systems is that they have a countable set of\neverywhere dense periodic trajectories and that their density exponentially\nincreases with entropy. Of special interest are C-systems that are defined on a\nhigh dimensional torus. The C-systems on a torus are perfect candidates to be\nused for Monte-Carlo simulations. Recently an efficient algorithm was found,\nwhich allows very fast generation of long trajectories of the C-systems. These\ntrajectories have high quality statistical properties and we are suggesting to\nuse them for the QCD lattice simulations and at high energy particle physics.\n", "  A vast literature on the theory and phenomenology of Two-Higgs-Doublet models\n(2HDM) exists since long. However, the present situation demands a revisit of\nsome 2HDM properties. Now that a 125 GeV scalar resonance has been discovered\nat the LHC, with its couplings to other particles showing increasing affinity\nto the Standard Model Higgs-like behavior, the 2HDM parameter space is more\nsqueezed than ever. We briefly review the different parametrizations of the\n2HDM potential and discuss the constraints on the parameter space arising from\nthe unitarity and stability of the potential together with constraints from the\noblique electroweak $T$-parameter. We also differentiate the consequences of\nimposing a global continuous U(1) symmetry on the potential from a discrete\n$Z_2$ symmetry.\n", "  Electrons in materials with linear dispersion behave as massless Weyl- or\nDirac-quasiparticles, and continue to intrigue physicists due to their close\nresemblance to elusive ultra-relativistic particles as well as their potential\nfor future electronics. Yet the experimental signatures of Weyl-fermions are\noften subtle and indirect, in particular if they coexist with conventional,\nmassive quasiparticles. Here we report a large anomaly in the magnetic torque\nof the Weyl semi-metal NbAs upon entering the \"quantum limit\" state in high\nmagnetic fields, where topological corrections to the energy spectrum become\ndominant. The quantum limit torque displays a striking change in sign,\nsignaling a reversal of the magnetic anisotropy that can be directly attributed\nto the topological properties of the Weyl semi-metal. Our results establish\nthat anomalous quantum limit torque measurements provide a simple experimental\nmethod to identify Weyl- and Dirac- semi-metals.\n", "  We present the extended source catalogue for the UKIRT Widefield Infrared\nSurvey for H2 (UWISH2). The survey is unbiased along the inner Galactic Plane\nfrom l \\approx 357deg to l \\approx 65deg and |b| < 1.5deg and covers 209 square\ndegrees. A further 42.0 and 35.5 square degrees of high dust column density\nregions have been targeted in Cygnus and Auriga. We have identified 33200\nindividual extended H2 features. They have been classified to be associated\nwith about 700 groups of jets and outflows, 284 individual (candidate)\nPlanetary Nebulae, 30 Supernova Remnants and about 1300 Photo-Dissociation\nRegions. We find a clear decline of star formation activity (traced by H2\nemission from jets and photo-dissociation regions) with increasing distance\nfrom the Galactic Centre. About 60% of the detected candidate Planetary Nebulae\nhave no known counterpart and 25% of all Supernova Remnants have detectable H2\nemission associated with them.\n", "  We briefly discuss the soft behavior of scattering amplitudes both in string\nand quantum field theory. In particular we show a general argument about the\nvalidity of soft theorems for open superstring amplitudes and list some of our\nrecent results.\n", "  An analytical benchmark is proposed for graphene and carbon nanotubes, that\nmay serve to test whatsoever molecular dynamics code implemented with REBO\npotentials. By exploiting the benchmark, we checked results produced by LAMMPS\n(Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator) when adopting the\nsecond generation Brenner potential, we made evident that the code in its\ncurrent implementation produces results which are offset from those of the\nbenchmark by a significant amount, and provide evidence of the reason.\n", "  The planetary exospheres are poorly known in their outer parts, since the\nneutral densities are low compared with the instruments detection capabilities.\nThe exospheric models are thus often the main source of information at such\nhigh altitudes. We present a new way to take into account analytically the\nadditional effect of the stellar radiation pressure on planetary exospheres. In\na series of papers, we present with an Hamiltonian approach the effect of the\nradiation pressure on dynamical trajectories, density profiles and escaping\nthermal flux. Our work is a generalization of the study by Bishop and\nChamberlain (1989). In this third paper, we investigate the effect of the\nstellar radiation pressure on the Circular Restricted Three Body Problem\n(CR3BP), called also the photogravitational CR3BP, and its implication on the\nescape and the stability of planetary exospheres, especially for Hot Jupiters.\nIn particular, we describe the transformation of the equipotentials and the\nlocation of the Lagrange points, and we provide a modified equation for the\nHill sphere radius that includes the influence of the radiation pressure.\nFinally, an application to the hot Jupiter HD 209458b reveals the existence of\na blow-off escape regime induced by the stellar radiation pressure.\n", "  The origin of the Finite Grid Instability (FGI) is studied by resolving the\ndynamics in the 1D electrostatic Particle-In-Cell (PIC) model in spectral\ndomain at the single particle level and at the collective motion level. The\nspectral fidelity of the PIC model is contrasted with the underlying physical\nsystem or the gridless model. The systematic spectral phase and amplitude\nerrors from the charge deposition and field interpolation are quantified for\ncommon particle shapes used in the PIC models. It is shown through such\nanalysis and in simulations that the lack of spectral fidelity relative to the\nphysical system due to the existence of aliased spatial modes is the major\ncause of the FGI in the PIC model.\n", "  The observation of many unexpected states decaying into heavy quarkonia has\nchallenged the usual Q-Qbar interpretation. We will discuss the nature of some\nof the charmonium-like resonances recently observed by BES III and LHCb, and\ntheir identication according to the compact tetraquark model. We also commment\nthe production of light nuclei in hadron collisions and the relevance for the\nphysics of the X(3872).\n", "  A weak spring is connected at one end to a rotor turning at constant angular\nvelocity. The spring extends to a stretched length as determined by the spring\nmass, rest length, spring constant, rotor radius and rotor angular velocity.\nWhen released from the rotor, the inner end of the spring pulls away as\nexpected, causing a wave to travel down the spring as it collapses. During this\ntime interval, the outer end of the spring continues to move along its original\ncircular path in uniform circular motion, as if the spring were still connected\nto the rotor. This is analogous to the effect of a hanging Slinky released from\nrest whose bottom end remains at a fixed position above the ground until a wave\nfrom the top of the Slinky reaches the bottom of the Slinky. Values from a\nnumerical model and measurements from video analysis show that upon release the\ninner end travels along a circle of similar radius as the outer end. The effect\nappears as a series of alternating semi-circles. In addition, the simulation\nand data agree that (1) the spring extension and drag angle increase with the\nangular velocity of the rotor; (2) the droop angle decreases with angular\nvelocity of the rotor; (3) the collapse time and bend angle of the collapsing\nspring are independent of the angular velocity.\n", "  We investigate the following questions: Given a measure $\\mu_\\Lambda$ on\nconfigurations on a subset $\\Lambda$ of a lattice $\\mathbb{L}$, where a\nconfiguration is an element of $\\Omega^\\Lambda$ for some fixed set $\\Omega$,\ndoes there exist a measure $\\mu$ on configurations on all of $\\mathbb{L}$,\ninvariant under some specified symmetry group of $\\mathbb{L}$, such that\n$\\mu_\\Lambda$ is its marginal on configurations on $\\Lambda$? When the answer\nis yes, what are the properties, e.g., the entropies, of such measures? Our\nprimary focus is the case in which $\\mathbb{L}=\\mathbb{Z}^d$ and the symmetries\nare the translations. For the case in which $\\Lambda$ is an interval in\n$\\mathbb{Z}$ we give a simple necessary and sufficient condition, local\ntranslation invariance (LTI), for extendibility. For LTI measures we construct\nextensions having maximal entropy, which we show are Gibbs measures; this\nconstruction extends to the case in which $\\mathbb{L}$ is the Bethe lattice. On\n$\\mathbb{Z}$ we also consider extensions supported on periodic configurations,\nwhich are analyzed using de~Bruijn graphs and which include the extensions with\nminimal entropy. When $\\Lambda\\subset\\mathbb{Z}$ is not an interval, or when\n$\\Lambda\\subset\\mathbb{Z}^d$ with $d>1$, the LTI condition is necessary but not\nsufficient for extendibility. For $\\mathbb{Z}^d$ with $d>1$, extendibility is\nin some sense undecidable.\n", "  The techniques of microwave quantum optics are applied to collective spin\nexcitations in a macroscopic sphere of ferromagnetic insulator. We demonstrate,\nin the single-magnon limit, strong coupling between a magnetostatic mode in the\nsphere and a microwave cavity mode. Moreover, we introduce a superconducting\nqubit in the cavity and couple the qubit with the magnon excitation via the\nvirtual photon excitation. We observe the magnon-vacuum-induced Rabi splitting.\nThe hybrid quantum system enables generation and characterization of\nnon-classical quantum states of magnons.\n", "  A reflection of our ultimate understanding of a complex system is our ability\nto control its behavior. Typically, control has multiple prerequisites: It\nrequires an accurate map of the network that governs the interactions between\nthe system's components, a quantitative description of the dynamical laws that\ngovern the temporal behavior of each component, and an ability to influence the\nstate and temporal behavior of a selected subset of the components. With deep\nroots in nonlinear dynamics and control theory, notions of control and\ncontrollability have taken a new life recently in the study of complex\nnetworks, inspiring several fundamental questions: What are the control\nprinciples of complex systems? How do networks organize themselves to balance\ncontrol with functionality? To address these here we review recent advances on\nthe controllability and the control of complex networks, exploring the\nintricate interplay between a system's structure, captured by its network\ntopology, and the dynamical laws that govern the interactions between the\ncomponents. We match the pertinent mathematical results with empirical findings\nand applications. We show that uncovering the control principles of complex\nsystems can help us explore and ultimately understand the fundamental laws that\ngovern their behavior.\n", "  Advances in single photon creation, transmission, and detection suggest that\nsending quantum information over optical fibers may have losses low enough to\nbe correctable using a quantum error correcting code. Such error-corrected\ncommunication is equivalent to a novel quantum repeater scheme, but crucial\nquestions regarding implementation and system requirements remain open. Here we\nshow that long range entangled bit generation with rates approaching $10^8$\nebits/s may be possible using a completely serialized protocol, in which\nphotons are generated, entangled, and error corrected via sequential, one-way\ninteractions with a minimal number of matter qubits. Provided loss and error\nrates of the required elements are below the threshold for quantum error\ncorrection, this scheme demonstrates improved performance over transmission of\nsingle photons. We find improvement in ebit rates at large distances using this\nserial protocol and various quantum error correcting codes.\n", "  We consider the thawing model in the framework of coupled quintessence model.\nThe effective potential has $Z_2$ symmetry which is broken spontaneously when\nthe dark matter density becomes less than a critical value leading the\nquintessence equation of state parameter to deviate from -1. Conditions\nrequired for this procedure are obtained and analytical solution for the\nequation of state parameter is derived.\n", "  When laser intensity exceeds 10^22W/cm^2, photons with energy above MeV can\nbe generated from high-order harmonics process in the laser-plasma interaction.\nWe find that under such laser intensity, QED effect plays a dominating role in\nthe radiation pattern. Contrast to the gas and relativistic HHG processes, both\nthe occurrence and energy of gamma-ray emission produced by QED harmonics are\nrandom and QED harmonics are usually not coherent, while the property of high\nintensity and ultra-short duration is conserved. Our simulation shows that the\nperiod of gamma-ray train is half of the laser period and the peak intensity is\n1.4e22W/cm^2. This new harmonic production with QED effects are crucial to\nlight-matter interaction in strong field and can be verified in experiments by\n10PW laser facilities in the near future.\n", "  Models and methods that are able to accurately and efficiently predict the\nflows of low-speed rarefied gases are in high demand, due to the increasing\nability to manufacture devices at micro and nano scales. One such model and\nmethod is a Fokker-Planck approximation to the Boltzmann equation, which can be\nsolved numerically by a stochastic particle method. The stochastic nature of\nthis method leads to noisy estimates of the thermodynamic quantities one wishes\nto sample when the signal is small in comparison to the thermal velocity of the\ngas. Recently, Gorji et al have proposed a method which is able to greatly\nreduce the variance of the estimators, by creating a correlated stochastic\nprocess which acts as a control variate for the noisy estimates. However, there\nare potential difficulties involved when the geometry of the problem is\ncomplex, as the method requires the density to be solved for independently.\n  Importance sampling is a variance reduction technique that has already been\nshown to successfully reduce the noise in direct simulation Monte Carlo\ncalculations. In this paper we propose an importance sampling method for the\nFokker-Planck stochastic particle scheme. The method requires minimal change to\nthe original algorithm, and dramatically reduces the variance of the estimates.\nWe test the importance sampling scheme on a homogeneous relaxation, planar\nCouette flow and a lid-driven-cavity flow, and find that our method is able to\ngreatly reduce the noise of estimated quantities. Significantly, we find that\nas the characteristic speed of the flow decreases, the variance of the noisy\nestimators becomes independent of the characteristic speed.\n", "  We consider star networks of chaotic oscillators, with all end-nodes\nconnected only to the central hub node, under diffusive coupling, conjugate\ncoupling and mean-field type coupling. We observe the existence of chimeras in\nthe end-nodes, which are identical in terms of the coupling environment and\ndynamical equations. Namely, the symmetry of the end-nodes is broken and\nco-existing groups with different synchronization features and attractor\ngeometries emerge. Surprisingly, such chimera states are very wide-spread in\nthis network topology, and large parameter regimes of moderate coupling\nstrengths evolve to chimera states from generic random initial conditions.\nFurther, we verify the robustness of these chimera states in analog circuit\nexperiments. Thus it is evident that star networks provide a promising class of\ncoupled systems, in natural or human-engineered contexts, where chimeras are\nprevalent.\n", "  This work explores a simple model of a slender, flexible structure in a\nuniform flow, providing analytical solutions for the translating, axially\nflowing equilibria of strings subjected to a uniform body force and drag forces\nlinear in the velocities. The classical catenaries are extended to a\nfive-parameter family of curves. A sixth parameter affects the tension in the\ncurves. Generic configurations are planar, represented by a single first order\nequation for the tangential angle. The effects of varying parameters on\nrepresentative shapes, orbits in angle-curvature space, and stress\ndistributions are shown. As limiting cases, the solutions include\nconfigurations corresponding to \"lariat chains\" and the towing, reeling, and\nsedimentation of flexible cables in a highly viscous fluid. Regions of\nparameter space corresponding to infinitely long, semi-infinite, and finite\nlength curves are delineated. Almost all curves subtend an angle less than\n$\\pi$ radians, but curious special cases with doubled or infinite range occur\non the borders between regions. Separate transitions in the tension behavior,\nand counterintuitive results regarding finite towing tensions for infinitely\nlong cables, are presented. Several physically inspired boundary value problems\nare solved and discussed.\n", "  We examine gravitational wave memory in the case where sources and detector\nare in an expanding cosmology. For simplicity, we treat the case where the\ncosmology is de Sitter spacetime, and discuss the possibility of generalizing\nour results to the case of a more realistic cosmology. We find results very\nsimilar to those of gravitational wave memory in an asymptotically flat\nspacetime, but with the magnitude of the effect multiplied by a redshift\nfactor.\n", "  In this paper, we consider two regularized transformation-optics cloaking\nschemes for electromagnetic (EM) waves. Both schemes are based on the blowup\nconstruction with the generating sets being, respectively, a generic curve and\na planar subset. We derive sharp asymptotic estimates in assessing the cloaking\nperformances of the two constructions in terms of the regularization parameters\nand the geometries of the cloaking devices. The first construction yields an\napproximate full-cloak, whereas the second construction yields an approximate\npartial-cloak. Moreover, by incorporating properly chosen conducting layers,\nboth cloaking constructions are capable of nearly cloaking arbitrary EM\ncontents. This work complements the existing results in [5--7] on approximate\nEM cloaks with the generating set being a singular point, and it also extends\n[9,25] on regularized full and partial cloaks for acoustic waves governed by\nthe Helmholtz system to the more challenging EM case governed by the full\nMaxwell system.\n", "  In order for sources of coherent high brightness and intensity THz and X-Ray\nradiation to be accepted by university or industrial R&D laboratories, truly\ncompact, high current and efficient particle accelerators are required. The\ndemand for compactness and efficiency can be satisfied by superconducting RF\nenergy recovery linear accelerators (SRF ERL) allowing effectively minimising\nthe footprint and maximising the efficiency of the system. However such set-ups\nare affected by regenerative beam-break up (BBU) instabilities which limit the\nbeam current and may terminate the beam transport as well as energy\nrecuperation. In this paper we suggest and discuss a SRF ERL with asymmetric\nconfiguration of resonantly coupled accelerating and decelerating cavities. In\nthis type of SRF ERL an electron bunch is passing through accelerating and\ndecelerating cavities once and, as we show in this case, the regenerative BBU\ninstability can be minimised allowing high currents to be achieved. We study\nthe BBU start current in such an asymmetric ERL via analytical and numerical\nmodels and discuss the properties of such a system.\n", "  In this paper, we explore the possibilities and limitations of recovering\nsparse signals in an online fashion. Employing a mean field approximation to\nthe Bayes recursion formula yields an online signal recovery algorithm that can\nbe performed with a computational cost that is linearly proportional to the\nsignal length per update. Analysis of the resulting algorithm indicates that\nthe online algorithm asymptotically saturates the optimal performance limit\nachieved by the offline method in the presence of Gaussian measurement noise,\nwhile differences in the allowable computational costs may result in\nfundamental gaps of the achievable performance in the absence of noise.\n", "  Grazing incidence fast atom diffraction (GIFAD, or FAD) has developed as a\nsurface sensitive technique. GIFAD is less sensitive to thermal decoherence but\nmore demanding in terms of surface coherence, the mean distance between\ndefects. Such high quality surfaces can be obtained from freshly cleaved\ncrystals or in a molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) chamber where a GIFAD setup has\nbeen installed allowing in situ operation. Based on recent publications by\nAtkinson et al. and Debiossac et al, the paper describes in detail the basic\nsteps needed to measure the relative intensities of the diffraction spots. Care\nis taken to outline the underlying physical assumptions.\n", "  Almost all superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) whose peak magnitudes are\n$\\lesssim -21$ mag can be explained by the $^{56}$Ni-powered model,\nmagnetar-powered (highly magnetized pulsar) model or ejecta-circumstellar\nmedium (CSM) interaction model. Recently, iPTF13ehe challenges these\nenergy-source models, because the spectral analysis shows that $\\sim\n2.5M_\\odot$ of $^{56}$Ni have been synthesized but are inadequate to power the\npeak bolometric emission of iPTF13ehe, while the rebrightening of the late-time\nlight-curve (LC) and the H$\\alpha$ emission lines indicate that the ejecta-CSM\ninteraction must play a key role in powering the late-time LC. Here we propose\na triple-energy-source model, in which a magnetar together with some amount\n($\\lesssim 2.5M_\\odot$) of $^{56}$Ni may power the early LC of iPTF13ehe while\nthe late-time rebrightening can be quantitatively explained by an ejecta-CSM\ninteraction. Furthermore, we suggest that iPTF13ehe is a genuine core-collapse\nsupernova rather than a pulsational pair-instability supernova candidate.\nFurther studies on similar SLSNe in the future would eventually shed light on\ntheir explosion and energy-source mechanisms.\n", "  Plasticity is governed by the evolution of, in general anisotropic, systems\nof dislocations. We seek to faithfully represent this evolution in terms of\ndensity-like variables which average over the discrete dislocation\nmicrostructure. Starting from T. Hochrainer's continuum theory of dislocations\n(CDD), we introduce a methodology based on the 'Maximum Information Entropy\nPrinciple' (MIEP) for deriving closed-form evolution equations for dislocation\ndensity measures of different order. These equations provide an optimum\nrepresentation of the kinematic properties of systems of curved and connected\ndislocation lines with the information contained in a given set of density\nmeasures. The performance of the derived equations is benchmarked against other\nmodels proposed in the literature, using discrete dislocation dynamics\nsimulations as a reference. As a benchmark problem we study dislocations moving\nin a highly heterogeneous, persistent slip-band-like geometry. We demonstrate\nthat excellent agreement with discrete simulations can be obtained in terms of\na very small number of averaged dislocation fields containing information about\nthe edge and screw components of the total and excess (geometrically necessary)\ndislocation densities. From these the full dislocation orientation distribution\nwhich emerges as dislocations move through a channel-wall structure can be\nfaithfully reconstructed.\n", "  Pentagon Operator Product Expansion provides a non-perturbative framework for\nanalysis of scattering amplitudes in planar maximally supersymmetric gauge\ntheory building up on their duality to null polygonal super Wilson loop and\nintegrability. In this paper, we construct a systematic expansion for the main\ningredients of the formalism, i.e., pentagons, at large 't Hooft coupling as a\npower series in its inverse value. The calculations are tested against\nrelations provided by the so-called Descent Equation which mixes transitions at\ndifferent perturbative orders. We use leading order results to have a first\nglimpse into the structure of scattering amplitude at NMHV level at strong\ncoupling.\n", "  The $\\Sigma$--$\\Lambda$ mixing angle is calculated in framework of the QCD\nsum rules. We find that our prediction for the mixing angle is $(1.00\\pm\n0.15)^0$ which is in good agreement with the quark model prediction, and\napproximately two times larger than the recent lattice QCD calculations.\n", "  We present the 8th Full Focal Plane simulation set (FFP8), deployed in\nsupport of the Planck 2015 results. FFP8 consists of 10 fiducial mission\nrealizations reduced to 18144 maps, together with the most massive suite of\nMonte Carlo realizations of instrument noise and CMB ever generated, comprising\n$10^4$ mission realizations reduced to about $10^6$ maps. The resulting maps\nincorporate the dominant instrumental, scanning, and data analysis effects;\nremaining subdominant effects will be included in future updates. Generated at\na cost of some 25 million CPU-hours spread across multiple\nhigh-performance-computing (HPC) platforms, FFP8 is used for the validation and\nverification of analysis algorithms, as well as their implementations, and for\nremoving biases from and quantifying uncertainties in the results of analyses\nof the real data.\n", "  Small-amplitude weakly coupled oscillators of the Klein-Gordon lattices are\napproximated by equations of the discrete nonlinear Schrodinger type. We show\nhow to justify this approximation by two methods, which have been very popular\nin the recent literature. The first method relies on a priori energy estimates\nand multi-scale decompositions. The second method is based on a resonant normal\nform theorem. We show that although the two methods are different in the\nimplementation, they produce equivalent results as the end product. We also\ndiscuss applications of the discrete nonlinear Schrodinger equation in the\ncontext of existence and stability of breathers of the Klein--Gordon lattice.\n", "  We use Planck data to detect the cross-correlation between the thermal\nSunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) effect and the infrared emission from the galaxies that\nmake up the the cosmic infrared background (CIB). We first perform a stacking\nanalysis towards Planck-confirmed galaxy clusters. We detect infrared emission\nproduced by dusty galaxies inside these clusters and demonstrate that the\ninfrared emission is about 50% more extended than the tSZ effect. Modelling the\nemission with a Navarro--Frenk--White profile, we find that the radial profile\nconcentration parameter is $c_{500} = 1.00^{+0.18}_{-0.15}$. This indicates\nthat infrared galaxies in the outskirts of clusters have higher infrared flux\nthan cluster-core galaxies. We also study the cross-correlation between tSZ and\nCIB anisotropies, following three alternative approaches based on power\nspectrum analyses: (i) using a catalogue of confirmed clusters detected in\nPlanck data; (ii) using an all-sky tSZ map built from Planck frequency maps;\nand (iii) using cross-spectra between Planck frequency maps. With the three\ndifferent methods, we detect the tSZ-CIB cross-power spectrum at significance\nlevels of (i) 6 $\\sigma$, (ii) 3 $\\sigma$, and (iii) 4 $\\sigma$. We model the\ntSZ-CIB cross-correlation signature and compare predictions with the\nmeasurements. The amplitude of the cross-correlation relative to the fiducial\nmodel is $A_{\\rm tSZ-CIB}= 1.2\\pm0.3$. This result is consistent with\npredictions for the tSZ-CIB cross-correlation assuming the best-fit\ncosmological model from Planck 2015 results along with the tSZ and CIB scaling\nrelations.\n", "  Predictions on fluctuations of hadron production properties in central heavy\nion collisions are presented. They are based on the Statistical Model of the\nEarly Stage and extend previously published results by considering the strongly\nintensive measures of fluctuations. In several of the considered cases a\nsignificant change in collision energy dependence of calculated quantities as a\nresult of the phase transition is predicted. This provides an opportunity to\nobserve new signals of the onset of deconfinement in heavy ion collisions\nexperiments.\n", "  We run numerical simulations of molecular clouds (MCs), adopting properties\nsimilar to those found in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way.\nFor this, we employ the moving mesh code Arepo and perform simulations which\naccount for a simplified treatment of time-dependent chemistry and the\nnon-isothermal nature of gas and dust. We perform simulations using an initial\ndensity of n_0 = 10^3 cm^{-3} and a mass of 1.3x10^5 M_sun. Furthermore, we\nvary the virial parameter, defined as the ratio of kinetic and potential\nenergy, alpha = E_{kin} / |E_{pot}|, by adjusting the velocity dispersion. We\nset it to alpha = 0.5, 2.0 and 8.0, in order to analyze the impact of the\nkinetic energy on our results. We account for the extreme conditions in the CMZ\nand increase both the interstellar radiation field (ISRF) and the cosmic-ray\nflux (CRF) by a factor of 1000 compared to the values found in the solar\nneighbourhood. We use the radiative transfer code RADMC-3D to compute synthetic\nimages in various diagnostic lines. These are [CII] at 158 micron, [OI] (145\nmicron), [OI] (63 micron), 12CO (J = 1 -> 0) and 13CO (J = 1 -> 0) at 2600\nmicron and 2720 micron, respectively. When alpha is large, the turbulence\ndisperses much of the gas in the cloud, reducing its mean density and allowing\nthe ISRF to penetrate more deeply into the cloud's interior. This significantly\nalters the chemical composition of the cloud, leading to the dissociation of a\nsignificant amount of the molecular gas. On the other hand, when alpha is\nsmall, the cloud remains compact, allowing more of the molecular gas to\nsurvive. We show that in each case the atomic tracers accurately reflect most\nof the physical properties of both the H2 and the total gas of the cloud and\nthat they provide a useful alternative to molecular lines when studying the ISM\nin the CMZ.\n", "  Spectral methods are an efficient way to solve partial differential equations\non domains possessing certain symmetries. The utility of a method depends\nstrongly on the choice of spectral basis. In this paper we describe a set of\nbases built out of Jacobi polynomials, and associated operators for solving\nscalar, vector, and tensor partial differential equations in polar coordinates\non a unit disk. By construction, the bases satisfy regularity conditions at r=0\nfor any tensorial field. The coordinate singularity in a disk is a prototypical\ncase for many coordinate singularities. The work presented here extends to\nother geometries. The operators represent covariant derivatives, multiplication\nby azimuthally symmetric functions, and the tensorial relationship between\nfields. These arise naturally from relations between classical orthogonal\npolynomials, and form a Heisenberg algebra. Other past work uses more specific\npolynomial bases for solving equations in polar coordinates. The main\ninnovation in this paper is to use a larger set of possible bases to achieve\nmaximum bandedness of linear operations. We provide a series of applications of\nthe methods, illustrating their ease-of-use and accuracy.\n", "  Emerging processor architectures such as GPUs and Intel MICs provide a huge\nperformance potential for high performance computing. However developing\nsoftware using these hardware accelerators introduces additional challenges for\nthe developer such as exposing additional parallelism, dealing with different\nhardware designs and using multiple development frameworks in order to use\ndevices from different vendors. The Dynamic Kernel Scheduler (DKS) is being\ndeveloped in order to provide a software layer between host application and\ndifferent hardware accelerators. DKS handles the communication between the host\nand device, schedules task execution, and provides a library of built-in\nalgorithms. Algorithms available in the DKS library will be written in CUDA,\nOpenCL and OpenMP. Depending on the available hardware, the DKS can select the\nappropriate implementation of the algorithm. The first DKS version was created\nusing CUDA for the Nvidia GPUs and OpenMP for Intel MIC. DKS was further\nintegrated in OPAL (Object-oriented Parallel Accelerator Library) to speed up a\nparallel FFT based Poisson solver and Monte Carlo simulations for particle\nmatter interaction used for proton therapy degrader modeling. DKS was also used\ntogether with Minuit2 for parameter fitting, where $\\chi^2$ and\n$max-log-likelihood$ functions were offloaded to the hardwareaccelerator. The\nconcepts of the DKS, first results together with plans for the future will be\nshown in this paper.\n", "  We propose a method to controllably suppress the effect of the four-wave\nmixing caused by the coupling of the strong control optical field to both\noptical transitions in the $\\Lambda$ system under the conditions of\nelectromagnetically induced transparency. At sufficiently high atomic density,\nthis process leads to amplification of a weak optical signal field, that is\ndetrimental for the fidelity of any EIT-based quantum information applications.\nHere we show that an additional absorption resonance centered around the idler\nfield frequency, generated in such a four-wave mixing process, may efficiently\nsuppress the unwanted signal amplification without affecting properties of the\nEIT interaction. We discuss the possibility of creating such tunable absorption\nusing two-photon Raman absorption resonances in the other Rb isotope, and\npresent some preliminary experimental results.\n", "  We present an MHD shell model suitable for computation of various energy\nfluxes of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence for very small and very large magnetic\nPrandtl numbers $\\mathrm{Pm}$; such computations are inaccessible to direct\nnumerical simulations. For small $\\mathrm{Pm}$, we observe that both kinetic\nand magnetic energy spectra scale as $k^{-5/3}$ in the inertial range, but the\ndissipative magnetic energy scales as $k^{-11/3}\\exp(-k/k_\\eta)$. Here, the\nkinetic energy at large length scale feeds the large-scale magnetic field that\ncascades to small-scale magnetic field, which gets dissipated by Joule heating.\nThe large-$\\mathrm{Pm}$ dynamo has a similar behaviour except that the\ndissipative kinetic energy scales as $k^{-13/3}$. For this case, the\nlarge-scale velocity field transfers energy to the large-scale magnetic field,\nwhich gets transferred to small-scale velocity and magnetic fields; the energy\nof the small-scale magnetic field also gets transferred to the small-scale\nvelocity field, and the energy thus accumulated is dissipated by the viscous\nforce.\n", "  A model reduction technique based on an optimization principle is employed to\ncoarse-grain inviscid, incompressible fluid dynamics in two dimensions. In this\nreduction the spectrally-truncated vorticity equation defines the\nmicrodynamics, while the macroscopic state space consists of quasi-equilibrium\ntrial probability densities on the microscopic phase space, which are\nparameterized by the means and variances of the low modes of the vorticity. A\nmacroscopic path therefore represents a coarse-grained approximation to the\nevolution of a nonequilibrium ensemble of microscopic solutions. Closure in\nterms of the vector of resolved variables, namely, the means and variances of\nthe low modes, is achieved by minimizing over all feasible paths the time\nintegral of their mean-squared residual with respect to the Liouville equation.\nThe equations governing the optimal path are deduced from Hamilton-Jacobi\ntheory. The coarse-grained dynamics derived by this optimization technique\ncontains a scale-dependent eddy viscosity, modified nonlinear interactions\nbetween the low mode means, and a nonlinear coupling between the mean and\nvariance of each low mode. The predictive skill of this optimal closure is\nvalidated quantitatively by comparing it against direct numerical simulations.\nThese tests show that good agreement is achieved without adjusting any closure\nparameters.\n", "  Numerical evidence suggests that the superradiant instability of Kerr-AdS\nblack holes and \"black resonators\" evolves to smaller and smaller scales\ntowards a \"limiting\" black resonator. Using $AdS_4$ supergravity, we argue that\nthis putative endpoint to the superradiant instability does not exist.\n", "  A number of Type I (hydrogenless) superluminous supernova (SLSN) events have\nbeen discovered recently. However, their nature remains debatable. One of the\nmost promising ideas is the shock-interaction mechanism, but only simplified\nsemi-analytical models have been applied so far. We simulate light curves for\nseveral Type I SLSN (SLSN-I) models enshrouded by dense, non-hydrogen\ncircumstellar envelopes, using a multi-group radiation hydrodynamics code that\npredicts not only bolometric, but also multicolor light curves. We demonstrate\nthat the bulk of SLSNe-I including those with relatively narrow light curves\nlike SN 2010gx or broad ones like PTF09cnd can be explained by the interaction\nof the SN ejecta with he CS envelope, though the range of parameters for these\nmodels is rather wide. Moderate explosion energy ($\\sim (2 - 4)\\cdot 10^{51}$\nergs) is sufficient to explain both narrow and broad SLSN-I light curves, but\nejected mass and envelope mass differ for those two cases. Only 5 to 10\n$M_\\odot$ of non-hydrogen material is needed to reproduce the light curve of SN\n2010gx, while the best model for PTF09cnd is very massive: it contains almost $\n50 M_\\odot $ in the CS envelope and only $ 5 M_\\odot $ in the ejecta. The CS\nenvelope for each case extends from 10 $R_\\odot$ to $\\sim 10^5R_\\odot$ ($7\\cdot\n10^{15} $ cm), which is about an order of magnitude larger than typical\nphotospheric radii of standard SNe near the maximum light. We briefly discuss\npossible ways to form such unusual envelopes.\n", "  We describe an approach for the efficient calculation of a large number of\nfour-point correlation functions for various baryon-baryon (BB) channels, which\nare the primary quantities for studying the nuclear and hyperonic nuclear\nforces from lattice quantum chromodynamics. Using the four-point correlation\nfunction of a proton-$\\Lambda$ system as a specific example, we discuss how an\neffective block algorithm significantly reduces the number of iterations. The\neffective block algorithm is applied to calculate 52 channels of the four-point\ncorrelation functions from nucleon$-$nucleon to $\\Xi-\\Xi$, in order to study\nthe complete set of isospin symmetric BB interactions. The elapsed times\nmeasured for hybrid parallel computation on BlueGene/Q demonstrate that the\nperformance of the present algorithm is reasonable for various combinations of\nthe number of OpenMP threads and the number of MPI nodes. The numerical results\nare compared with the results obtained using the unified contraction algorithm\nfor all computed sites of the 52 four-point correlators.\n", "  We explicitly establish a unitary correspondence between spherical\nirreducible tensor operators and cartesian tensor operators of any rank. That\nunitary relation is implemented by means of a basis of integer-spin wave\nfunctions that constitute simultaneously a basis of the spaces of cartesian and\nspherical irreducible tensors. As a consequence, we extend the Wigner--Eckart\ntheorem to cartesian irreducible tensor operators of any rank, and to totally\nsymmetric reducible ones. We also discuss the tensorial structure of several\nstandard spherical irreducible tensors such as ordinary, bipolar and tensor\nspherical harmonics, spin-polarization operators and multipole operators. As an\napplication, we obtain an explicit expression for the derivatives of any order\nof spherical harmonics in terms of tensor spherical harmonics.\n", "  The generalized spin stiffness constant for a doped quantum antiferromagnet\nhas been investigated both analytically and numerically as a function of doping\nconcentration at zero temperature, based on the strongly correlated t-J model\non two-dimensional square lattice. The nature of the theoretical dependence of\nthe stiffness constant on doping shows a striking similarity with that of the\neffective exchange constant, obtained from the combination of other theoretical\nand experimental techniques in the low doping region. This correspondence once\nagain establishes that spin stiffness can very well play the role of an\neffective exchange constant even in the strongly correlated semi-itinerant\nsystems. Our theoretical plot of the stiffness constant against doping\nconcentration in the whole doping region exhibits the various characteristic\nfeatures like a possible crossover in the higher doping regions and persistence\nof short range ordering even for very high doping with the complete vanishing\nof spin stiffness occurring only close to 100% doping. Our results receive very\ngood support from various other theoretical approaches and also brings out a\nfew limitations of some of them. Our detailed analysis highlights the crucial\nimportance of the study of spin stiffness for the proper understanding of\nmagnetic correlations in a semi-itinerant magnetic system described by the\nstrongly correlated t-J model. Moreover, our basic formalism can also be\nutilized for determination of the effective exchange constant and magnetic\ncorrelations for itinerant magnetic systems, in general in a novel way.\n", "  We report on optical properties of various polymorphs of hafnia predicted\nwithin the framework of density functional theory. The full potential\nlinearised augmented plane wave method was employed together with the\nTran-Blaha modified Becke-Johnson potential for exchange and local density\napproximation for correlation. Unit cells of monoclinic, cubic, and tetragonal\ncrystalline, and a simulated annealing-based model of amorphous hafnia were\nfully relaxed with respect to internal positions and lattice parameters. The\nthus obtained band gaps of 5.76 eV, 5.88 eV, 6.54 eV, and 5.5 eV for\nmonoclinic, cubic, tetragonal, and amorphous hafnia, respectively, are in\nexcellent agreement with available experimental data. Dielectric functions were\ncalculated and a shift of spectral weights to higher energies with respect to\nexperimental data was predicted. This was attributed to the random phase\napproximation used to calculate the dielectric function, rather than\ninaccuracies in the band structure.\n", "  Cross correlation of the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe signal (ISW) with the galaxy\ndistribution in late time is a promising tool for constraining the dark energy\nproperties. Here, we study the effect of dark energy clustering on the\nISW-galaxy cross correlation and demonstrate the fact that the bias parameter\nbetween the distribution of the galaxies and the underlying dark matter\nintroduces a degeneracy and complications. We argue that as the galaxy's host\nhalo formation time is different from the observation time, we have to consider\nthe evolution of the halo bias parameter. It will be shown that any deviation\nfrom $\\Lambda$CDM model will change the evolution of the bias as well.\nTherefore, it is deduced that the halo bias depends strongly on the sub-sample\nof galaxies which is chosen for cross correlation and that the joint kernel of\nISW effect and the galaxy distribution has a dominant effect on the observed\nsignal. In this work, comparison is made specifically between the clustered\ndark energy models using two samples of galaxies. The first one is a sub-sample\nof galaxies from Sloan Digital Sky Survey, chosen with the r-band magnitude $18\n< r < 21$ and the dark matter halo host of mass $M \\sim10^{12}M_{\\odot}$ and\nformation redshift of $z_{f}\\sim 2.5$. The second one is the sub-sample of\nLuminous Red galaxies with the dark matter halo hosts of mass $M \\sim\n10^{13}M_{\\odot}$ and formation redshift of $z_{f}\\sim 2.0$. Using the evolved\nbias we improve the $\\chi^2$ for the $\\Lambda$CDM which reconciles the\n$\\sim$1$\\sigma$-2$\\sigma$ tension of the ISW-galaxy signal with $\\Lambda$CDM\nprediction.[abridged]\n", "  We derive a large deviations principle for the two-dimensional two-component\nplasma in a box. As a consequence, we obtain a variational representation for\nthe free energy, and also show that the macroscopic empirical measure of either\npositive or negative charges converges to the uniform measure. An appendix,\nwritten by Wei Wu, discusses applications to the supercritical complex Gaussian\nmultiplicative chaos.\n", "  Exoplanet science often involves using the system parameters of real\nexoplanets for tasks such as simulations, fitting routines, and target\nselection for proposals. Several exoplanet catalogues are already well\nestablished but often lack a version history and code friendly interfaces.\nSoftware that bridges the barrier between the catalogues and code enables users\nto improve the specific repeatability of results by facilitating the retrieval\nof exact system parameters used in an articles results along with unifying the\nequations and software used. As exoplanet science moves towards large data,\ngone are the days where researchers can recall the current population from\nmemory. An interface able to query the population now becomes invaluable for\ntarget selection and population analysis. ExoData is a Python interface and\nexploratory analysis tool for the Open Exoplanet Catalogue. It allows the\nloading of exoplanet systems into Python as objects (Planet, Star, Binary etc)\nfrom which common orbital and system equations can be calculated and measured\nparameters retrieved. This allows researchers to use tested code of the common\nequations they require (with units) and provides a large science input\ncatalogue of planets for easy plotting and use in research. Advanced querying\nof targets are possible using the database and Python programming language.\nExoData is also able to parse spectral types and fill in missing parameters\naccording to programmable specifications and equations. Examples of use cases\nare integration of equations into data reduction pipelines, selecting planets\nfor observing proposals and as an input catalogue to large scale simulation and\nanalysis of planets.\n", "  Here we present several remarkable irregularities at chemical freeze-out\nwhich are found using an advanced version of the hadron resonance gas model.\nThe most prominent of them are the sharp peak of the trace anomaly existing at\nchemical freeze-out at the center of mass energy 4.9 GeV and two sets of highly\ncorrelated quasi-plateaus in the collision energy dependence of the entropy per\nbaryon, total pion number per baryon, and thermal pion number per baryon which\nwe found at the center of mass energies 3.8-4.9 GeV and 7.6-10 GeV. The low\nenergy set of quasi-plateaus was predicted a long time ago. On the basis of the\ngeneralized shock-adiabat model we demonstrate that the low energy correlated\nquasi-plateaus give evidence for the anomalous thermodynamic properties inside\nthe quark-gluon-hadron mixed phase. It is also shown that the trace anomaly\nsharp peak at chemical freeze-out corresponds to the trace anomaly peak at the\nboundary between the mixed phase and quark gluon plasma. We argue that the high\nenergy correlated quasi-plateaus may correspond to a second phase transition\nand discuss its possible origin and location. Besides we suggest two new\nobservables which may serve as clear signals of these phase transformations.\n", "  Materials that crystalize in diamond-related lattices, with Si and GaAs as\ntheir prime examples, are at the foundation of modern electronics.\nSimultaneoulsy, the two atomic sites in the unit cell of these crystals form\ninversion partners which gives rise to relativistic non-equilibrium spin\nphenomena highly relevant for magnetic memories and other spintronic devices.\nWhen the inversion-partner sites are occupied by the same atomic species,\nelectrical current can generate local spin polarization with the same magnitude\nand opposite sign on the two inversion-partner sites. In CuMnAs, which shares\nthis specific crystal symmetry of the Si lattice, the effect led to the\ndemonstration of electrical switching in an antiferromagnetic memory at room\ntemperature. When the inversion-partner sites are occupied by different atoms,\na non-zero global spin-polarization is generated by the applied current which\ncan switch a ferromagnet, as reported at low temperatures in the diluted\nmagnetic semiconductor (Ga,Mn)As. Here we demonstrate the effect of the global\ncurrent-induced spin polarization in a counterpart crystal-symmetry material\nNiMnSb which is a member of the broad family of magnetic Heusler compounds. It\nis an ordered high-temperature ferromagnetic metal whose other favorable\ncharacteristics include high spin-polarization and low damping of magnetization\ndynamics. Our experiments are performed on strained single-crystal epilayers of\nNiMnSb grown on InGaAs. By performing all-electrical ferromagnetic resonance\nmeasurements in microbars patterned along different crystal axes we detect\nroom-temperature spin-orbit torques generated by effective fields of the\nDresselhaus symmetry. The measured magnitude and symmetry of the\ncurrent-induced torques are consistent with our relativistic density-functional\ntheory calculations.\n", "  Magnons in ferrimagnetic insulators such as yttrium iron garnet (YIG) have\nrecently emerged as promising candidates for coherent information processing in\nmicrowave circuits. Here we demonstrate optical whispering gallery modes of a\nYIG sphere interrogated by a silicon nitride photonic waveguide, with quality\nfactors approaching $10^6$ in the telecom c-band after surface treatments.\nMoreover, in contrast to conventional Faraday setup, this implementation allows\ninput photon polarized colinearly to the magnetization to be scattered to a\nsideband mode of orthogonal polarization. This Brillouin scattering process is\nenhanced through triply resonant magnon, pump and signal photon modes - all of\nwhispering gallery nature - within an \"optomagnonic cavity\". Our results show\nthe potential use of magnons for mediating microwave-to-optical carrier\nconversion.\n", "  We consider a conformal complex singlet extension of the Standard Model with\na Higgs portal interaction. The global $U(1)$ symmetry of the complex singlet\ncan be either broken or unbroken and we study each scenario. In the unbroken\ncase, the global $U(1)$ symmetry protects the complex singlet from decaying,\nleading to an ideal cold dark matter candidate with approximately 100 GeV mass\nalong with a significant proportion of thermal relic dark matter abundance. In\nthe broken case, we have developed a renormalization-scale optimization\ntechnique to significantly narrow the parameter space and in some situations,\nprovide unique predictions for all the model's couplings and masses. We have\nfound there exists a second Higgs boson with a mass of approximately\n$550\\,\\rm{GeV}$ that mixes with the known $125\\,\\rm{GeV}$ Higgs with a large\nmixing angle $\\sin\\theta\\approx 0.47$ consistent with current experimental\nlimits. The imaginary part of the complex singlet in the broken case could\nprovide axion dark matter for a wide range of models. Upon including\ninteractions of the complex scalar with an additional vector-like fermion, we\nexplore the possibility of a diphoton excess in both the unbroken and the\nbroken cases. In the unbroken case, the model can provide a natural explanation\nfor diphoton excess if extra terms are introduced providing extra contributions\nto the singlet mass. In the broken case, we find a set of coupling solutions\nthat yield a second Higgs boson of mass $720\\,\\rm{GeV}$ and an $830\\,\\rm{GeV}$\nextra vector-like fermion $F$, which is able to address the $750\\,\\rm{GeV}$ LHC\ndiphoton excess. We also provide criteria to determine the symmetry breaking\npattern in both the Higgs and hidden sectors.\n", "  We discuss strangeness production in heavy-ion collisions within and around\nthe energy range of the planned NICA facility. We describe the minimal\nstatistical model, in which the total strangeness yield is fixed by the\nobserved or calculated $K^+$ multiplicity. We show how the exact strangeness\nconservation can be taken into account on the event-by-event basis in such a\nmodel. We argue that from strange particle yields one can reveal information\nabout the collision dynamics and about possible modifications of particle\nproperties in medium. This can be best achieved if the complete strangeness\nmeasurement is performed, i.e. kaons, anti-kaons, hyperons and multistrange\nhyperons are registered in the same experimental setup. In particular the\nproduction of hadrons containing two and more strange quarks, like $\\Xi$ and\n$\\Omega$ baryons could be of interest.\n", "  We argue that there should exist the large combined fluctuations of chiral\nand diquark condensates along the phase boundary of QCD at moderately high\ndensity and relatively low temperature. Such fluctuations might lead to\nanomalous production of nucleons and its parity partner, which we propose to\ndetect at NICA.\n", "  Dual three-dimensional networks of structural and transport elements were\ncombined to model the effect of fracture on mass transport in quasi-brittle\ngeomaterials. Element connectivity of the structural network, representing\nelasticity and fracture, was defined by the Delaunay tessellation of a random\nset of points. The connectivity of transport elements within the transport\nnetwork was defined by the Voronoi tessellation of the same set of points. A\nnew discretisation strategy for domain boundaries was developed to apply\nboundary conditions for the coupled analyses. The properties of transport\nelements were chosen to evolve with the crack opening values of neighbouring\nstructural elements. Through benchmark comparisons involving non-stationary\ntransport and fracture, the proposed dual network approach was shown to be\nobjective with respect to element size and orientation.\n", "  An adiabatic mode Helmholtz equation for 3D underwater sound propagation is\ndeveloped. The Gaussian beam tracing in this case is constructed. The test\ncalculations are carried out for the crosswedge benchmark and proved an\nexcellent agreement with the source images method.\n", "  We provide explicit formulas for asymptotic densities of the 2- and\n3-dimensional ballistic L\\'evy walks. It turns out that in the 3D case the\ndensities are given by elementary functions. The densities of the 2D L\\'evy\nwalks are expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions and the right-side\nRiemann-Liouville fractional derivative which allows to efficiently evaluate\nthem numerically. The theoretical results agree with Monte-Carlo simulations.\nThe obtained functions solve certain differential equations with the fractional\nmaterial derivative.\n", "  We investigate the Kondo effect in a structure which is constructed by\nembedding one quantum dot between a normal metal and a \\emph{DIII}-class\ntopological superconductor supporting Majorana doublets at its ends. It is\nobserved that Kondo correlation occurs between the localized state in the dot\nand two continuum states simultaneously, i.e., the continuum state in the metal\nand the continuum Andreev reflection state between the metal and topological\nsuperconductor. As a result, the Kondo model Hamiltonian is topologically\nprotected by the $SU(2)_s\\rtimes Z_2^T$ symmetry. Besides, the Kondo\ntemperature has an opportunity to present three forms in turn, following the\nenhancement of the coupling between the dot and Majorana doublet. This\nphenomenon exactly reflects the special role of Majorana doublet in tuning the\nKondo effect.\n", "  We present results obtained by applying our BAyesian HierArchical Modeling\nfor the Analysis of Supernova cosmology (BAHAMAS) software package to the 740\nspectroscopically confirmed supernovae type Ia (SNIa) from the \"Joint\nLight-curve Analysis\" (JLA) dataset. We simultaneously determine cosmological\nparameters and standardization parameters, including host galaxy mass\ncorrections, residual scatter and object-by-object intrinsic magnitudes.\nCombining JLA and Planck Cosmic Microwave Background data, we find significant\ndiscrepancies in cosmological parameter constraints with respect to the\nstandard analysis: we find Omega_M = 0.399+/-0.027, 2.8\\sigma\\ higher than\npreviously reported and w = -0.910+/-0.045, 1.6\\sigma\\ higher than the standard\nanalysis. We determine the residual scatter to be sigma_res = 0.104+/-0.005.\n  We confirm (at the 95% probability level) the existence of two\nsub-populations segregated by host galaxy mass, separated at\nlog_{10}(M/M_solar) = 10, differing in mean intrinsic magnitude by\n0.055+/-0.022 mag, lower than previously reported. Cosmological parameter\nconstraints are however unaffected by inclusion of host galaxy mass\ncorrections. We find ~4\\sigma\\ evidence for a sharp drop in the value of the\ncolor correction parameter, beta(z), at a redshift z_trans = 0.662+/-0.055. We\nrule out some possible explanations for this behaviour, which remains\nunexplained.\n", "  We use cosmological simulations from the Feedback In Realistic Environments\n(FIRE) project, which implement a comprehensive set of stellar feedback\nprocesses, to study ultra-violet (UV) metal line emission from the\ncircum-galactic medium of high-redshift (z=2-4) galaxies. Our simulations cover\nthe halo mass range Mh ~ 2x10^11 - 8.5x10^12 Msun at z=2, representative of\nLyman break galaxies. Of the transitions we analyze, the low-ionization C III\n(977 A) and Si III (1207 A) emission lines are the most luminous, with C IV\n(1548 A) and Si IV (1394 A) also showing interesting spatially-extended\nstructures. The more massive halos are on average more UV-luminous. The UV\nmetal line emission from galactic halos in our simulations arises primarily\nfrom collisionally ionized gas and is strongly time variable, with\npeak-to-trough variations of up to ~2 dex. The peaks of UV metal line\nluminosity correspond closely to massive and energetic mass outflow events,\nwhich follow bursts of star formation and inject sufficient energy into\ngalactic halos to power the metal line emission. The strong time variability\nimplies that even some relatively low-mass halos may be detectable. Conversely,\nflux-limited samples will be biased toward halos whose central galaxy has\nrecently experienced a strong burst of star formation. Spatially-extended UV\nmetal line emission around high-redshift galaxies should be detectable by\ncurrent and upcoming integral field spectrographs such as the Multi Unit\nSpectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the Very Large Telescope and Keck Cosmic Web\nImager (KCWI).\n", "  This article reviews efforts to build a new type of quantum device, which\ncombines an ensemble of electronic spins with long coherence times, and a\nsmall-scale superconducting quantum processor. The goal is to store over long\ntimes arbitrary qubit states in orthogonal collective modes of the\nspin-ensemble, and to retrieve them on-demand. We first present the protocol\ndevised for such a multi-mode quantum memory. We then describe a series of\nexperimental results using NV center spins in diamond, which demonstrate its\nmain building blocks: the transfer of arbitrary quantum states from a qubit\ninto the spin ensemble, and the multi-mode retrieval of classical microwave\npulses down to the single-photon level with a Hahn-echo like sequence. A reset\nof the spin memory is implemented in-between two successive sequences using\noptical repumping of the spins.\n", "  The one-dimensional $t_1$-$t_2$-$J_1$-$J_2$ model is examined in the one-hole\ncase, in which the total number of electrons is one less than the number of the\nlattice sites. The ground-state phase diagram includes a series of partial\nferromagnetic phases, which are stacked in a regime of positive and small\n$J_1$. We find that the ground state in each of these partial ferromagnetic\nphases includes a ferromagnetic cloud, which is a multiple-spin bound state\ntogether with the hole. The ferromagnetic cloud is a large magnetic polaron\nwith a heavy mass in a single-band electronic system and is supposedly formed\nas a result of Nagaoka ferromagnetism which locally works around the hole.\n", "  To reveal the relative importance of charge doping and defect scattering in\nsubstitutionally modified 122 iron pnictides, we perform a systematic first\nprinciples study on selected bands at the Fermi level. Disorder effects are\ninduced by various substitutions using an orbital based coherent potential\napproximation (CPA). Pronounced level shifts of individual bands suggest that\ntransition metal substitutions introduce mobile charge carriers into the\nsystem. However, important deviations from such a rigid band scenario as well\nas spectral broadenings due to impurity scattering correlate with the band\ncharacter. Finally a $T$-matrix analysis exhibits a larger intraband than\ninterband scattering consistent with an $s^{+-}$ pairing state. Comparing\ndifferent substitutions reveals an increase of pair-breaking along the\ntransition metal series.\n", "  The functional renormalisation group (fRG) has evolved into a versatile tool\nin condensed matter theory for studying important aspects of correlated\nelectron systems. Practical applications of the method often involve a high\nnumerical effort, motivating the question in how far High Performance Computing\n(HPC) can leverage the approach. In this work we report on a multi-level\nparallelisation of the underlying computational machinery and show that this\ncan speed up the code by several orders of magnitude. This in turn can extend\nthe applicability of the method to otherwise inaccessible cases. We exploit\nthree levels of parallelisation: Distributed computing by means of Message\nPassing (MPI), shared-memory computing using OpenMP, and vectorisation by means\nof SIMD units (single-instruction-multiple-data). Results are provided for two\ndistinct High Performance Computing (HPC) platforms, namely the IBM-based\nBlueGene/Q system JUQUEEN and an Intel Sandy-Bridge-based development cluster.\nWe discuss how certain issues and obstacles were overcome in the course of\nadapting the code. Most importantly, we conclude that this vast improvement can\nactually be accomplished by introducing only moderate changes to the code, such\nthat this strategy may serve as a guideline for other researcher to likewise\nimprove the efficiency of their codes.\n", "  The concordance model of cosmology favours a universe with a tiny positive\ncosmological constant. A tiniest positive constant curvature, profoundly alters\nthe asymptotic structure, forcing a re-look at a theory of gravitational\nradiation. Even for compact astrophysical sources, the intuition from Minkowski\nbackground is challenged at every step. Nevertheless, at least for candidate\nsources such as compact binaries, it is possible to quantify influence of the\ncosmological constant, as small corrections to the leading order Minkowski\nbackground results. Employing suitably chosen Fermi normal coordinates in the\nstatic patch of the de Sitter background, we compute the field due to a compact\nsource to first order in $\\Lambda$. For contrast, we also present the field in\nthe Poincare patch where the leading correction is in $\\sqrt{\\Lambda}$. We\nintroduce a gauge invariant quantity, {\\em deviation scalar}, containing\npolarization information and compute it in both charts for a comparison.\n", "  The dispersion relation of ultracold atoms in variably shaped optical\nlattices can be tuned to resemble that of a relativistic particle, i.e. be\nlinear instead of the usual nonrelativistic quadratic dispersion relation of a\nfree atom. Cold atoms in such a lattice can be used to carry out quantum\nsimulations of relativistic wave equation predictions. We begin this article by\ndescribing a Raman technique that allows to selectively load atoms into a\ndesired Bloch band of the lattice near a band crossing. Subsequently, we review\ntwo recent experiments with quasirelativistic rubidium atoms in a bichromatic\nlattice, demonstrating the analogs of Klein tunneling and Veselago lensing with\nultracold atoms respectively.\n", "  A rapidly expanding fireball which undergoes first-order phase transition\nwill supercool and proceed via spinodal decomposition. Hadrons are produced\nfrom the individual fragments as well as the left-over matter filling the space\nbetween them. Emission from fragments should be visible in rapidity\ncorrelations, particularly of protons. In addition to that, even within narrow\ncentrality classes, rapidity distributions will be fluctuating from one event\nto another in case of fragmentation. This can be identified with the help of\nKolmogorov-Smirnov test. Finally, we present a method which allows to sort\nevents with varying rapidity distributions in such a way, that events with\nsimilar rapidity histograms are grouped together.\n", "  We implement the Lanczos algorithm on an Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor and\ncompare its performance to a multi-core Intel Xeon CPU and an NVIDIA graphics\nprocessor. The Xeon and the Xeon Phi are parallelized with OpenMP and the\ngraphics processor is programmed with CUDA. The performance is evaluated by\nmeasuring the execution time of a single step in the Lanczos algorithm. We\nstudy two quantum lattice models with different particle numbers, and conclude\nthat for small systems, the multi-core CPU is the fastest platform, while for\nlarge systems, the graphics processor is the clear winner, reaching speedups of\nup to 7.6 compared to the CPU. The Xeon Phi outperforms the CPU with\nsufficiently large particle number, reaching a speedup of 2.5.\n", "  In a series of papers (see \\cite{CDT02} and the pertinent references therein)\nthe 3D Navier-Stokes-$\\alpha$ model were shown to be a useful complement to the\n3D Navier-Stokes equations; and in particular, to be a good Reynolds version of\nthe latter equations. In this work, we introduce a simple Reynolds averaging\nwhich, due to the wall roughness, transforms the Navier-Stokes equations into\nthe Navier-Stokes-$\\alpha$ model.\n", "  A survey of some results in the modern microscopic theory of properties of\nnuclear reactions with gamma-rays is given. First of all, we discuss the impact\nof phonon coupling (PC) on the photon strength function (PSF) because it\nrepresents the most natural physical source of additional strength found for Sn\nisotopes in recent experiments that could not be explained within the stan-\ndard HFB+QRPA approach. The self-consistent version of the Extended Theory of\nFinite Fermi Systems in the Quasiparticle Time Blocking Approximation, or\nsimply QTBA, is applied. It uses the HFB mean field and includes both the QRPA\nand PC effects on the basis of the SLy4 Skyrme force. With our microscopic E1\nPSFs, the following properties have been calculated for many stable and\nunstable even-even semi-magic Sn and Ni isotopes as well as for double-magic\n132Sn and 208Pb using the reaction codes EMPIRE and TALYS with several nuclear\nlevel density (NLD) models: 1) the neutron capture cross sections, 2) the\ncorresponding neutron capture gamma spectra, 3) the av- erage radiative widths\nof neutron resonances. In all the properties considered, the PC contribution\nturned out to be significant, as compared with the standard QRPA one, and\nnecessary to explain the available experimental data. The results with the\nphenomenological so-called generalized super- fluid NLD model turned out to be\nworse, on the whole, than those obtained with the microscopic HFB+combinatorial\nNLD model. Finally, we also discuss the modern microscopic NLD models based on\nthe self-consistent HFB method and show their relevance to explain experimental\ndata as compared with the phenomeno- logical models. The use of these\nself-consistent microscopic approaches is of particular relevance for nuclear\nastrophysics, but also for the study of double-magic nuclei.\n", "  We study the local response to long wavelength fluctuations in cosmological\n$N$-body simulations, focusing on the matter and halo power spectra, halo\nabundance and non-linear transformations of the density field. The long\nwavelength mode is implemented using an effective curved cosmology and a\nmapping of time and distances. The method provides an alternative, most\nprobably more precise, way to measure the isotropic halo biases. Limiting\nourselves to the linear case, we find generally good agreement between the\nbiases obtained from the curvature method and the traditional power spectrum\nmethod at the level of a few percent. We also study the response of halo counts\nto changes in the variance of the field and find that the slope of the relation\nbetween the responses to density and variance differs from the naive derivation\nassuming a universal mass function by 18%. This has implications for\nmeasurements of the amplitude of local non-Gaussianity using scale dependent\nbias. We also analyze the halo power spectrum and halo-dark matter\ncross-spectrum response to long wavelength fluctuations and derive second order\nhalo bias from it, as well as the super-sample variance contribution to the\ngalaxy power spectrum covariance matrix.\n", "  The eikonal approximation for moderately small scattering amplitudes is\nconsidered. With the purpose of using for their numerical estimations, the\nformulas are derived which contain no Bessel functions, and, hence, no rapidly\noscillating integrands. To obtain these formulas, the improper integrals of the\nfirst kind which contain products of the Bessel functions J_0(z) are studied.\nThe expression with four functions J_0(z) is generalized. The expressions for\nthe integrals with the product of five and six Bessel functions J_0(z) are also\nfound. The known formula for the improper integral with two functions J_nu(z)\nis generalized for non-integer nu.\n", "  We discuss an approach to accurate numerical computations of slowly\nconvergent properties in two-electron atoms/ions which include the negatively\ncharged Ps$^{-}$ ($e^{-} e^{+} e^{-}$) and H$^{-}$ ions, He atom and positively\ncharged, helium-like ions from Li$^{+}$ to Ni$^{26+}$. All these ions are\nconsidered in their ground $1^{1}S-$state(s). The slowly convergent properties\nselected in this study include the electron-nulceus $\\langle r^{2 k}_{eN}\n\\rangle$ and electron-electron $\\langle r^{2 k}_{ee} \\rangle$ expectation\nvalues for $k$ = 2, 3, 4 and 5.\n", "  Realization and design of topological insulators emerging from electron\ncorrelations, called topological Mott insulators (TMIs), is pursued by using\nmean-field approximations as well as multi-variable variational Monte Carlo\n(MVMC) methods for Dirac electrons on honeycomb lattices. The topological\ninsulator phases predicted in the previous studies by the mean-field\napproximation for an extended Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice turn out\nto disappear, when we consider the possibility of a long-period\ncharge-density-wave (CDW) order taking over the TMI phase. Nevertheless, we\nfurther show that the TMI phase is still stabilized when we are able to tune\nthe Fermi velocity of the Dirac point of the electron band. Beyond the\nlimitation of the mean-field calculation, we apply the newly developed MVMC to\nmake accurate predictions after including the many-body and quantum\nfluctuations. By taking the extrapolation to the thermodynamic and weak\nexternal field limit, we present realistic criteria for the emergence of the\ntopological insulator caused by the electron correlations. By suppressing the\nFermi velocity to a tenth of that of the original honeycomb lattice, the\ntopological insulator emerges in an extended region as a spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking surviving competitions with other orders. We discuss experimental ways\nto realize it in a bilayer graphenesystem.\n", "  In this paper we address the use of rare event computation techniques to\nestimate small over-threshold probabilities of observables in determin-istic\ndynamical systems. We demonstrate that the genealogical particle analysis\nalgorithms can be successfully applied to a toy model of atmospheric dynamics,\nthe Lorenz '96 model. We furthermore use the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck system to\nillustrate a number of implementation issues. We also show how a time-dependent\nobjective function based on the fluctuation path to a high threshold can\ngreatly improve the performance of the estimator compared to a fixed-in-time\nobjective function.\n", "  We establish the full list of flavour symmetry groups which may be enforced,\nwithout producing any further accidental symmetry, on the Yukawa-coupling\nmatrices of an SO(10) Grand Unified Theory with arbitrary numbers of scalar\nmultiplets in the 10, $\\overline{126}$, and 120 representations of SO(10). For\neach of the possible discrete non-Abelian symmetry groups, we present examples\nof minimal models which do not run into obvious contradiction with the\nphenomenological fermion masses and mixings.\n", "  The orbital period evolution of X-ray binaries provides fundamental clues to\nunderstanding mechanisms of angular momentum loss from these systems. We\npresent an X-ray eclipse timing analysis of the transient low mass X-ray binary\nAX J1745.6-2901. This system shows full eclipses and thus is one of the few\nobjects for which accurate orbital evolution studies using this method can be\ncarried out. We report on XMM-Newton and ASCA observations covering 30 complete\nX-ray eclipses spanning an interval of more than 20 years. We improve the\ndetermination of the orbital period to a relative precision of\n$2\\times10^{-8}$, two orders of magnitudes better than previous estimates. We\ndetermine, for the first time, a highly significant rate of decrease of the\norbital period $\\dot{P}_{orb}=-4.03\\pm0.32\\times10^{-11}$~s/s. This is at least\none order of magnitude larger than expected from conservative mass transfer and\nangular momentum losses due to gravitational waves and magnetic breaking, and\nmight result from non-conservative mass transfer. Imprinted on the long term\nevolution of the orbit, we observe highly significant eclipse leads-delays of\n~10-20 s, characterised by a clear state dependence in which, on average,\neclipses occur earlier during the hard state.\n", "  We show that when a dark abelian gauge sector and SU$(2)_{L}$ kinetically mix\nit necessarily generates a relation between the kinetic mixing strength and the\nmass of the mediating particle. Remarkably, this correspondence maps the weak\nscale directly to the kinetic mixing strengths being probed by modern\nfixed-target experiments and next generation flavor factories. This illuminates\nthe exciting possibility of correlated discoveries of a new particle at the LHC\nand a dark photon at intensity frontier experiments. To motivate the scenario,\nwe construct a simple model and explore its phenomenology and constraints.\n", "  We report the discovery, tracking and detection circumstances for 85\ntrans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) from the first 42 deg$^{2}$ of the Outer Solar\nSystem Origins Survey (OSSOS). This ongoing $r$-band Solar System survey uses\nthe 0.9 deg$^{2}$ field-of-view MegaPrime camera on the 3.6 m\nCanada-France-Hawaii Telescope. Our orbital elements for these TNOs are precise\nto a fractional semi-major axis uncertainty $<0.1\\%$. We achieve this precision\nin just two oppositions, as compared to the normal 3-5 oppositions, via a dense\nobserving cadence and innovative astrometric technique. These discoveries are\nfree of ephemeris bias, a first for large trans-Neptunian surveys. We also\nprovide the necessary information to enable models of TNO orbital distributions\nto be tested against our TNO sample. We confirm the existence of a cold\n\"kernel\" of objects within the main cold classical Kuiper belt, and infer the\nexistence of an extension of the \"stirred\" cold classical Kuiper belt to at\nleast several AU beyond the 2:1 mean motion resonance with Neptune. We find\nthat the population model of Petit et al. (2011) remains a plausible\nrepresentation of the Kuiper belt. The full survey, to be completed in 2017,\nwill provide an exquisitely characterized sample of important resonant TNO\npopulations, ideal for testing models of giant planet migration during the\nearly history of the Solar System.\n", "  The main objective of this paper is to introduce the STABLE (Surface flux\nTransport And Babcock-LEighton) solar dynamo model. STABLE is a 3D\nBabcock-Leighton/Flux Transport dynamo model in which the source of poloidal\nfield is the explicit emergence, distortion, and dispersal of bipolar magnetic\nregions (BMRs). Here we describe the STABLE model in more detail than we have\npreviously and we verify it by reproducing a 2D mean-field benchmark. We also\npresent some representative dynamo simulations, focusing on the special case of\nkinematic magnetic induction and axisymmetric flow fields. Not all solutions\nare supercritical; it can be a challenge for the BL mechanism to sustain the\ndynamo when the turbulent diffusion near the surface is $\\geq 10^{12}$ cm$^2$\ns$^{-1}$. However, if BMRs are sufficiently large, deep, and numerous, then\nsustained, cyclic, dynamo solutions can be found that exhibit solar-like\nfeatures. Furthermore, we find that the shearing of radial magnetic flux by the\nsurface differential rotation can account for most of the net toroidal flux\ngeneration in each hemisphere, as has been recently argued for the Sun by\nCameron & Schussler (2015).\n", "  One important ingredient of flux transport dynamo models is the rise of the\ntoroidal magnetic field through the convection zone due to magnetic buoyancy to\nproduce bipolar sunspots and then the generation of the poloidal magnetic field\nfrom these bipolar sunspots due to the Babcock-Leighton mechanism. Over the\nyears, two methods of treating magnetic buoyancy, a local method and a\nnon-local method have been used widely by different groups in constructing 2D\nkinematic models of the flux transport dynamo. We review both these methods and\nconclude that neither of them is fully satisfactory, presumably because\nmagnetic buoyancy is an inherently 3D process. We also point out so far we do\nnot have proper understanding of why sunspot emergence is restricted to rather\nlow latitudes.\n", "  Recent measurements of top-quark production at hadron colliders are reviewed.\nThe inclusive top-quark pair production is determined at four centre-of-mass\nenergies at Tevatron and LHC with experimental uncertainties that are close to\nthe uncertainties in theoretical calculations at next-to-next-to-leading order\nin QCD. Several differential measurements are performed and compared to\nsimulation. Production of single top quarks is studied in the three different\nproduction channels. Top-quark pair production with neutral and charged vector\nbosons has been observed by the LHC experiments. Finally, production of\nadditional heavy flavour quark pairs ($b\\bar{b}$, $t\\bar{t}$) is studied or\nsearched for.\n", "  We study the problem of remote control of quantum correlations (discord) in a\nsub-system of two qubits (receiver) via the parameters of the initial state of\nanother sub-system of three qubits (sender) connected with the receiver by the\ninhomogeneous spin-1/2 chain. We propose two parameters characterizing the\ncreatable correlations. The first one is the discord between the receiver and\nthe rest of spin-1/2 chain, it concerns the mutual correlations between these\ntwo subsystems. The second parameter is the discord between the two nodes of\nthe receiver and describes the correlations inside of the receiver. We study\nthe dependence of these two discords on the inhomogeneity degree of spin chain.\n", "  It is shown that homogeneous line-broadening in a diffuse cold atom cloud is\nproportional to the resonant optical depth of the cloud. Further, it is\ndemonstrated how the strong directionality of the coherent interactions causes\nthe cloud's spectra to depend strongly on its shape, even when the cloud is\nheld at constant densities. These two numerical observations can be predicted\nanalytically by extending the single photon wave-function model. Lastly,\nelongating a cloud along the line of laser propagation causes the excitation\nprobability distribution to deviate from the exponential decay predicted by the\nBeer-Lambert law to the extent where the atoms in the back of the cloud are\nmore excited than the atoms in the front. These calculations are conducted at\nlow densities relevant to recent experiments.\n", "  The in-plane resistivity anisotropy is studied in strain-detwinned single\ncrystals of FeSe. In contrast to other iron-based superconductors, FeSe does\nnot develop long-range magnetic order below the nematic/structural transition\nat $T_{s}\\approx$90~K. This allows for the disentanglement of the contributions\nto the resistivity anisotropy due to nematic and magnetic orders. Comparing\ndirect transport and elastoresistivity measurements, we extract the intrinsic\nresistivity anisotropy of strain-free samples. The anisotropy peaks slightly\nbelow $T_{s}$ and decreases to nearly zero on cooling down to the\nsuperconducting transition. This behavior is consistent with a scenario in\nwhich the in-plane resistivity anisotropy in FeSe is dominated by inelastic\nscattering by anisotropic spin fluctuations.\n", "  We investigate certain families $X^\\hbar$, $0<\\hbar \\ll 1$, of Gaussian\nrandom smooth functions on the $m$-dimensional torus\n$\\mathbb{T}^m_\\hbar:=\\mathbb{R}^m/(\\hbar^{-1}\\mathbb{Z} )^m$. We show tha,t for\nany cube $B\\subset \\mathbb{R}^m$ of size $<1/2$ and centered at the origin, the\nnumber of critical points of $X^\\hbar$ in the region\n$\\hbar^{-1}B/(\\hbar^{-1}\\mathbb{Z} )^m\\subset\\mathbb{T}^m_\\hbar$ has mean $\\sim\nc_1\\hbar^{-m}$, variance $\\sim c_2\\hbar^{-m/2}$, $c_1,c_2>0$, and satisfies a\ncentral limit theorem as $\\hbar\\searrow 0$.\n", "  The effect of the minimal length on the thermal properties of a Dirac\noscillator is considered. The canonical partition function is well determined\nby using the method based on Zeta Epstein function. Through this function, all\nthermodynamics properties, such as the free energy, the total energy, the\nentropy, and the specific heat, have been determined. Moreover, this study\nallows us to calculate the values of minimal length \\triangle\nx=\\hbar\\sqrt{\\beta} for some fermionic particles.\n", "  Updating various theoretical and experimental constraints on the four\ndifferent types of two-Higgs-doublet models (2HDMs), we find that only the\n``lepton-specific\" (or ``type X\") 2HDM can explain the present muon g$-$2\nanomaly in the parameter region of large $\\tan\\beta$, a light CP-odd boson, and\nheavier CP-even and charged bosons which are almost degenerate. The severe\nconstraints on the models come mainly from the consideration of vacuum\nstability and perturbativity, the electroweak precision data, the $b$-quark\nobservables like $B_S \\to \\mu\\mu$, the precision measurements of the lepton\nuniversality as well as the 125 GeV boson property observed at the LHC.\n", "  We study particle and spin transport in a single mode quantum point contact\nusing a charge neutral, quantum degenerate Fermi gas with tunable, attractive\ninteractions. This yields the spin and particle conductance of the point\ncontact as a function of chemical potential or confinement. The measurements\ncover a regime from weak attraction, where quantized conductance is observed,\nto the resonantly interacting superfluid. Spin conductance exhibits a broad\nmaximum when varying the chemical potential at moderate interactions, which\nsignals the emergence of Cooper pairing. In contrast, the particle conductance\nis unexpectedly enhanced even before the gas is expected to turn into a\nsuperfluid, continuously rising from the plateau at 1/h for weak interactions\nto plateaux-like features at non-universal values as high as 4/h for\nintermediate interactions. For strong interactions, the particle conductance\nplateaux disappear and the spin conductance gets suppressed, confirming the\nspin-insulating character of a superfluid. Our observations document the\nbreakdown of universal conductance quantization as many-body correlations\nappear. The observed anomalous quantization challenges a Fermi liquid\ndescription of the normal phase, shedding new light on the nature of the\nstrongly attractive Fermi gases.\n", "  We present multi-wavelength detections of nine candidate\ngravitationally-lensed dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) selected at 218GHz\n(1.4mm) from the ACT equatorial survey. Among the brightest ACT sources, these\nrepresent the subset of the total ACT sample lying in Herschel SPIRE fields,\nand all nine of the 218GHz detections were found to have bright Herschel\ncounterparts. By fitting their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with a\nmodified blackbody model with power-law temperature distribution, we find the\nsample has a median redshift of $z=4.1^{+1.1}_{-1.0}$ (68 per cent confidence\ninterval), as expected for 218GHz selection, and an apparent total infrared\nluminosity of $\\log_{10}(\\mu L_{\\rm IR}/{\\rm L}_\\odot) =\n13.86^{+0.33}_{-0.30}$, which suggests that they are either strongly lensed\nsources or unresolved collections of unlensed DSFGs. The effective apparent\ndiameter of the sample is $\\sqrt{\\mu}d= 4.2^{+1.7}_{-1.0}$kpc, further evidence\nof strong lensing or multiplicity, since the typical diameter of dusty\nstar-forming galaxies is $1.0$--$2.5$ kpc. We emphasize that the effective\napparent diameter derives from SED modelling without the assumption of\noptically thin dust (as opposed to image morphology). We find that the sources\nhave substantial optical depth ($\\tau = 4.2^{+3.7}_{-1.9}$) to dust around the\npeak in the modified blackbody spectrum ($\\lambda_{\\rm obs} \\le 500$ $\\mu$m), a\nresult that is robust to model choice.\n", "  This paper reports the last technological development on the Low Gain\nAvalanche Detector (LGAD) and introduces a new architecture of these detectors\ncalled inverse-LGAD (iLGAD). Both approaches are based on the standard\nAvalanche Photo Diodes (APD) concept, commonly used in optical and X-ray\ndetection applications, including an internal multiplication of the charge\ngenerated by radiation. The multiplication is inherent to the basic n++-p+-p\nstructure, where the doping profile of the p+ layer is optimized to achieve\nhigh field and high impact ionization at the junction. The LGAD structures are\noptimized for applications such as tracking or timing detectors for high energy\nphysics experiments or medical applications where time resolution lower than 30\nps is required. Detailed TCAD device simulations together with the electrical\nand charge collection measurements are presented through this work.\n", "  We compute the leading contribution to the mutual information (MI) of two\ndisjoint spheres in the large distance regime for arbitrary conformal field\ntheories (CFT) in any dimension. This is achieved by refining the operator\nproduct expansion method introduced by Cardy \\cite{Cardy:2013nua}. For CFTs\nwith holographic duals the leading contribution to the MI at long distances\ncomes from bulk quantum corrections to the Ryu-Takayanagi area formula.\nAccording to the FLM proposal\\cite{Faulkner:2013ana} this equals the bulk MI\nbetween the two disjoint regions spanned by the boundary spheres and their\ncorresponding minimal area surfaces. We compute this quantum correction and\nprovide in this way a non-trivial check of the FLM proposal.\n", "  Simulation within the grand canonical ensemble is the method of choice for\naccurate studies of first order vapour-liquid phase transitions in model\nfluids. Such simulations typically employ sampling that is biased with respect\nto the overall number density in order to overcome the free energy barrier\nassociated with mixed phase states. However, at low temperature and for large\nsystem size, this approach suffers a drastic slowing down in sampling\nefficiency. The culprits are geometrically induced transitions (stemming from\nthe periodic boundary conditions) which involve changes in droplet shape from\nsphere to cylinder and cylinder to slab. Since the overall number density\ndoesn't discriminate sufficiently between these shapes, it fails as an order\nparameter for biasing through the transitions. Here we report two approaches to\nameliorating these difficulties. The first introduces a droplet shape based\norder parameter that generates a transition path from vapour to slab states for\nwhich spherical and cylindrical droplet are suppressed. The second simply\nbiases with respect to the number density in a tetragonal subvolume of the\nsystem. Compared to the standard approach, both methods offer improved\nsampling, allowing estimates of coexistence parameters and vapor-liquid surface\ntension for larger system sizes and lower temperatures.\n", "  In this paper, we study freeze-in production of fermionic dark matter with a\npseudo scalar as the mediator between dark sector and Standard Model (SM).\nWhile the fermionic DM is non-thermal, we will explain two scenarios in which\nproduction of pseudo-scalar particles are either thermal or non thermal. We'll\npresent elaborate discussion to derive yield quantity and relic density and\nillustrate these values for the different range of model parameters. We'll\ninvestigate constraints on parameters space coming from invisible Higgs decay\nat LHC. For the case of extremely small couplings and zero mixing between SM\nHiggs field with pseudo scalar field which pseudo scalar boson can play role of\nDM, we will justify recent observation of merging galaxies with a case of\nself-interacting DM. We'll show that influence of DM annihilation in this case,\nwould provide a better fit to the AMS-02 data of positron flux.\n", "  We present SOLARPROP, a tool to compute the influence of charge-sign\ndependent solar modulation for cosmic ray spectra. SOLARPROP is able to use the\noutput of popular tools like GALPROP or DRAGON and offers the possibility to\nembed new models for solar modulation. We present some examples for proton,\nantiproton and positron fluxes in the light of the recent PAMELA and AMS-02\ndata.\n", "  Developments in photonic chips have spurred photon based classical and\nquantum information processing, attributing to the high stability and\nscalability of integrated photonic devices [1, 2]. Optical nonlinearity [3] is\nindispensable in these complex photonic circuits, because it allows for\nclassical and quantum light sources, all-optical switch, modulation, and\nnon-reciprocity in ambient environments. It is commonly known that nonlinear\ninteractions are often greatly enhanced in the microcavities [4]. However, the\nmanifestations of coherent photon-photon interaction in a cavity, analogous to\nthe electromagnetically induced transparency [5], have never been reported on\nan integrated platform. Here, we present an experimental demonstration of the\ncoherent photon-photon interaction induced by second order optical nonlinearity\n(\\chi^{(2)} ) on an aluminum nitride photonic chip. The non-reciprocal\nnonlinear optic induced transparency is demonstrated as a result of the\ncoherent interference between photons with different colors: ones in the\nvisible wavelength band and ones in the telecom wavelength band. Furthermore, a\nwide-band frequency conversion with an almost unit internal (0.14 external)\nefficiency and a bandwidth up to 0.76\\,\\mathrm{GHz} is demonstrated.\n", "  We measured the power spectrum and two-point correlation function for the\nrandomly fluctuating free surface on the downstream side of a stationary flow\nwith a maximum Froude number $F_{\\rm max} \\approx 0.85$ reached above a\nlocalised obstacle. On such a flow the scattering of incident long wavelength\nmodes is analogous to that responsible for black hole radiation (the Hawking\neffect). Our measurements of the noise show a clear correlation between pairs\nof modes of opposite energies. We also measure the scattering coefficients by\napplying the same analysis of correlations to waves produced by a wave maker.\n", "  We present an application of Large Deviation Theory to the problem of\nstructure growth on large-scale structure cosmology. Starting from gaussian\ndistributed overdensities on concentric spherical shells, we show that a Large\nDeviation Principle holds for the densities on the corresponding shells after\ngravitational evolution if no shell-crossing happens. As consequences of the\nLarge Deviation Principle we obtain the cumulant generating function for the\nnon-linear densities, and present formulae to compute the cumulant generating\nfunction for general window functions.\n", "  The modified Korteweg-de Vries hierarchy (mKdV) is derived by imposing\nisometry and isoenergy conditions on a moduli space of plane loops. The\nconditions are compared to the constraints that define Euler's elastica.\nMoreover, the conditions are shown to be constraints on the curvature and other\ninvariants of the loops which appear as coefficients of the generating function\nfor the Faber polynomials.\n", "  The accreted component of stellar halos is composed of the contributions of\nseveral satellites, falling onto their host with their different masses, at\ndifferent times, on different orbits. This work uses a suite of idealised,\ncollisionless N-body simulations of minor mergers and a particle tagging\ntechnique to understand how these different ingredients shape each contribution\nto the accreted halo, in both density and kinematics. I find that more massive\nsatellites deposit their stars deeper into the gravitational potential of the\nhost, with a clear segregation enforced by dynamical friction. Earlier\naccretion events contribute more to the inner regions of the halo; more\nconcentrated subhaloes sink deeper through increased dynamical friction. The\norbital circularity of the progenitor at infall is only important for low-mass\nsatellites: dynamical friction efficiently radialises the most massive minor\nmergers erasing the imprint of the infall orbit for satellite-to-host virial\nmass ratios $\\gtrsim1/20$. The kinematics of the stars contributed by each\nsatellite is also ordered with satellite mass: low-mass satellites contribute\nfast-moving populations, in both ordered rotation and radial velocity\ndispersion. In turn, contributions by massive satellites have lower velocity\ndispersion and lose their angular momentum to dynamical friction, resulting in\na strong radial anisotropy.\n", "  Motivated by the recent CMS excess in a flavor violating Higgs decay $h\n\\rightarrow \\mu \\tau$ as well as the anomaly of muon anomalous magnetic moment\n(muon g-2), we consider a scenario where both the excess in $h \\rightarrow \\mu\n\\tau$ and the anomaly of muon g-2 are explained by the $\\mu-\\tau$ flavor\nviolation in a general two Higgs doublet model. We study various processes\ninvolving $\\mu$ and $\\tau$, and then discuss the typical predictions and\nconstraints in this scenario. Especially, we find that the prediction of $\\tau\n\\rightarrow \\mu \\gamma$ can be within the reach of the Belle II experiment. We\nalso show that the lepton non-universality between $\\tau \\rightarrow \\mu \\nu\n\\bar{\\nu}$ and $\\tau \\rightarrow e \\nu \\bar{\\nu}$ can be sizable, and hence the\nanalysis of the current Belle data and the future experimental improvement\nwould have an impact on this model. Besides, processes such as $\\tau\n\\rightarrow \\mu l^+ l^-~(l=e,~\\mu)$, $\\tau \\rightarrow \\mu \\eta$, $\\mu\n\\rightarrow e \\gamma$, $\\mu \\rightarrow 3e$, and muon EDM can be accessible,\ndepending on the unknown Yukawa couplings. On the other hand, the processes\nlike $\\tau \\rightarrow e \\gamma$ and $\\tau \\rightarrow e l^+ l^-~ (l=e,~\\mu)$\ncould not be sizable to observe because of the current strong constraints on\nthe $e-\\mu$ and $e-\\tau$ flavor violations. Then we also conclude that contrary\nto $h \\rightarrow \\mu \\tau$ decay mode, the lepton flavor violating Higgs boson\ndecay modes $h\\rightarrow e \\mu$ and $h\\rightarrow e\\tau$ are strongly\nsuppressed, and hence it will be difficult to observe these modes at the LHC\nexperiment.\n", "  Plasmonic nanostructures, which are used to generate surface plasmon\npolaritions (SPPs), always involve sharp corners where the charges can\naccumulate. This can result in strong localized electromagnetic fields at the\nmetallic corners, forming hot spots. The influence of the hot spots on the\npropagating SPPs are investigated theoretically and experimentally in a\nmetallic slit structure. It is found that the electromagnetic fields radiated\nfrom the hot spots, termed as the hot spot cylindrical wave (HSCW), can greatly\nmanipulate the SPP launching in the slit structure. The physical mechanism\nbehind the manipulation of the SPP launching with the HSCW is explicated by a\nsemi-analytic model. By using the HSCW, unidirectional SPP launching is\nexperimentally realized in an ultra-small metallic step-slit structure. The\nHSCW bridges the localized surface plasmons and the propagating surface\nplasmons in an integrated platform and thus may pave a new route to the design\nof plasmonic devices and circuits.\n", "  Kinematics and dynamics of a particle moving on a torus knot poses an\ninteresting problem as a constrained system. In the first part of the paper we\nhave derived the modified symplectic structure or Dirac brackets of the above\nmodel in Dirac's Hamiltonian framework, both in toroidal and Cartesian\ncoordinate systems. This algebra has been used to study the dynamics, in\nparticular small fluctuations in motion around a specific torus. The spatial\nsymmetries of the system have also been studied.\n  In the second part of the paper we have considered the quantum theory of a\ncharge moving in a torus knot in the presence of a uniform magnetic field along\nthe axis of the torus in a semiclassical quantization framework. We exploit the\nEinstein - Brillouin - Keller (EBK) scheme of quantization that is appropriate\nfor multidimensional systems. Embedding of the knot on a specific torus is\ninherently two dimensional that gives rise to two quantization conditions. This\nshows that although the system, after imposing the knot condition reduces to a\none dimensional system, even then it has manifest non-planar features which\nshows up again in the study of fractional angular momentum. Finally we compare\nthe results obtained from EBK (multi-dimensional) and Bohr-Sommerfeld (single\ndimensional) schemes. The energy levels and fractional spin depend on the torus\nknot parameters that specifies its non-planar features. Interestingly, we show\nthat there can be non-planar corrections to the planar anyon-like fractional\nspin.\n", "  In this paper, we use the exact renormalisation in the context of tensor\nmodels and tensorial group field theories. As a byproduct, we rederive Gaussian\nuniversality for random tensors and provide a general power counting for\nAbelian tensorial field theories with a closure constraint, leading us to a\nonly five renormalizable theories.\n", "  Recent years have seen an increased interest in the question of whether the\ngravitational action of planets could have an influence on the solar dynamo.\nWithout discussing the observational validity of the claimed correlations, we\nask for a possible physical mechanism that might link the weak planetary forces\nwith solar dynamo action. We focus on the helicity oscillations that were\nrecently found in simulations of the current-driven, kink-type Tayler\ninstability, which is characterized by an m=1 azimuthal dependence. We show how\nthese helicity oscillations can be resonantly excited by some m=2 perturbation\nthat reflects a tidal oscillation. Specifically, we speculate that the 11.07\nyears tidal oscillation induced by the Venus--Earth--Jupiter system may lead to\na 1:1 resonant excitation of the oscillation of the alpha-effect. Finally, in\nthe framework of a reduced, zero-dimensional alpha--Omega dynamo model we\nrecover a 22.14-year cycle of the solar dynamo.\n", "  Architected materials that control elastic wave propagation are essential in\nvibration mitigation and sound attenuation. Phononic crystals and acoustic\nmetamaterials use band gap engineering to forbid certain frequencies from\npropagating through a material. However, existing solutions are limited in the\nlow frequency regimes and in their bandwidth of operation because they require\nimpractical sizes and masses. Here, we present a class of materials (labeled\nelastic meta-structures) that supports the formation of wide and low frequency\nband gaps, while simultaneously reducing their global mass. To achieve these\nproperties, the meta-structures combine local resonances with structural modes\nof a periodic architected lattice. While the band gaps in these meta-structures\nare induced by Bragg scattering mechanisms, their key feature is that the band\ngap size and frequency range can be controlled and broadened through local\nresonances, which is linked to changes in the lattice geometry. We demonstrate\nthese principles experimentally, using novel additive manufacturing methods,\nand inform our designs using finite element simulations. This design strategy\nhas a broad range of applications, including control of structural vibrations,\nnoise and shock mitigation.\n", "  Vortices and vortex arrays have been used as a hallmark of superfluidity in\nrotated, ultracold Fermi gases. These superfluids can be described in terms of\nan effective field theory for a macroscopic wave function representing the\nfield of condensed pairs, analogous to the Ginzburg-Landau theory for\nsuperconductors. Here, we have established how rotation modifies this effective\nfield theory, by rederiving it starting from the action of Fermi gas in the\nrotating frame of reference. The rotation leads to the appearance of an\neffective vector potential, and the coupling strength of this vector potential\nto the macroscopic wave function depends on the interaction strength between\nthe fermions, due to a renormalization of the pair effective mass in the\neffective field theory. The mass renormalization derived here is in agreement\nwith results of functional renormalization group theory. In the extreme BEC\nregime, the pair effective mass tends to twice the fermion mass, in agreement\nwith the physical picture of a weakly interacting Bose gas of molecular pairs.\nThen, we use our macroscopic wave function description to study vortices and\nthe critical rotation frequencies to form them. Equilibrium vortex state\ndiagrams are derived, and they are in good agreement with available results of\nthe Bogoliubov - De Gennes theory and with experimental data.\n", "  Left-Right (LR) models are extensions of the Standard Model where left-right\nsymmetry is restored at high energies, and which are strongly constrained by\nkaon mixing described in the framework of the $|\\Delta S|=2$ effective\nHamiltonian. We consider the short-distance QCD corrections to this Hamiltonian\nboth in the Standard Model (SM) and in LR models. The leading logarithms\noccurring in these short-distance corrections can be resummed within a\nrigourous Effective Field Theory (EFT) approach integrating out heavy degrees\nof freedom progressively, or using an approximate simpler method of regions\nidentifying the ranges of loop momentum generating large logarithms in the\nrelevant two-loop diagrams. We compare the two approaches in the SM at\nnext-to-leading order, finding a very good agreement when one scale dominates\nthe problem, but only a fair agreement in the presence of a large logarithm at\nleading order. We compute the short-distance QCD corrections for LR models at\nnext-to-leading order using the method of regions, and we compare the results\nwith the EFT approach for the $WW'$ box with two charm quarks (together with\nadditional diagrams forming a gauge-invariant combination), where a large\nlogarithm occurs already at leading order. We conclude by providing\nnext-to-leading-order estimates for $cc$, $ct$ and $tt$ boxes in LR models.\n", "  We address the near-collinear expansion of NMHV six-particle scattering\namplitudes at strong value of 't Hooft coupling in planar maximally\nsupersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. We complement recent studies of this\nobservable within the context of the Pentagon Operator Product Expansion, via\nthe dual superWilson loop description, by studying effects of multiple scalar\nexchanges that accompany (or not) massive flux-tube excitations. Due to the\nfact that holes have a very small, nonperturbatively generated mass which is\nexponentially suppressed in 't Hooft coupling, their exchanges must be resummed\nin the ultraviolet limit. This procedure yields a contribution to the\nexpectation value of the superloop which enters on equal footing with the\nclassical area, --- a phenomenon which was earlier observed for MHV amplitudes.\nIn all components, the near-massless scalar exchanges factorize from the ones\nof massive particles, at leading order in strong coupling.\n", "  We develop a theory of energy relaxation in semiconductors and insulators\nhighly excited by the long-acting external irradiation. We derive the equation\nfor the non-equilibrium distribution function of excited electrons. The\nsolution for this function breaks up into the sum of two contributions. The\nlow-energy contribution is concentrated in a narrow range near the bottom of\nthe conduction band. It has the typical form of a Fermi distribution with an\neffective temperature and chemical potential. The effective temperature and\nchemical potential in this low-energy term are determined by the intensity of\ncarriers' generation, the speed of electron-phonon relaxation, rates of\ninter-band recombination and electron capture on the defects. In addition,\nthere is a substantial high-energy correction. This high-energy 'tail' covers\nlargely the conduction band. The shape of the high-energy 'tail' strongly\ndepends on the rate of electron-phonon relaxation but does not depend on the\nrates of recombination and trapping. We apply the theory to the calculation of\na non-equilibrium distribution of electrons in irradiated GaN. Probabilities of\noptical excitations from the valence to conduction band and electron-phonon\ncoupling probabilities in GaN were calculated by the density functional\nperturbation theory. Our calculation of both parts of distribution function in\ngallium nitride shows that when the speed of electron-phonon scattering is\ncomparable with the rate of recombination and trapping then the contribution of\nthe non-Fermi 'tail' is comparable with that of the low-energy Fermi-like\ncomponent. So the high-energy contribution can affect essentially the charge\ntransport in the irradiated and highly doped semiconductors.\n", "  We present a detailed analysis and phenomenological consequences of neutrino\nmass matrix, $M_{\\nu}$, with one-zero texture in the flavor basis where the\nactive neutrino sector is extended by one sterile neutrino (3+1 case). In\nparticular, our aim is to explore behaviour of the sterile mixing parameters in\ndetail when one of the elements of the neutrino mass matrix goes to zero. To\nstudy this, we consider two distinct mass spectrum of the active neutrinos: (i)\ncompletely hierarchical mass spectrum with a vanishing neutrino mass and (ii)\ncompletely quasidegenerate mass spectrum. In 3+1 scenario, the low energy\nneutrino mass matrix, $M_{\\nu}$, is a $4 \\times 4$ matrix and has 10\nindependent elements. Thus it can have 10 possible one-zero textures. From the\nearlier studies it can be inferred that, if one assumes one vanishing neutrino\nmass, then only seven of these $M_{\\nu}$ are phenomenologically allowed by the\ncurrent neutrino oscillation data. On the other hand, if the neutrinos are\nquasidegenerate then there are eight phenomenologically viable one-zero\ntextures. In this present work, we study the correlations between the sterile\nmixing parameters for each of these allowed textures for both mass spectrum and\nalso their implications on the effective Majorana mass.\n", "  We consider a model of electroconvection motivated by studies of the motion\nof a two dimensional annular suspended smectic film under the influence of an\nelectric potential maintained at the boundary by two cylindrical electrodes. We\nprove that this electroconvection model has global in time unique smooth\nsolutions.\n", "  We explore a scheme for engineering a one-dimensional spinless p-wave\nsuperconductor hosting unpaired Majorana zero-energy modes, using an\nall-electric setup with a spin-orbit coupled quantum wire in proximity to an\ns-wave superconductor. The required crossing of the Fermi level by a single\nspin-split energy band is ensured by employing a periodically modulated Rashba\ninteraction, which, assisted by electron-electron interactions and a uniform\nDresselhaus interaction, opens a gap at two of the spin-orbit shifted Fermi\npoints. While an implementation in a hybrid superconductor-semiconductor device\nrequires improvements upon present-day capabilities, a variant of our scheme\nwhere spin-orbit-coupled cold fermions are effectively proximity-coupled to a\nBEC reservoir of Feshbach molecules may provide a ready-to-use platform.\n", "  We investigate the hovering dynamics of rigid bodies with up-down asymmetry\nplaced in oscillating background flows. Recent experiments on inanimate\npyramid-shaped objects in oscillating flows with zero mean component\ndemonstrate that the resulting aerodynamic forces are sufficient to keep the\nobject aloft. The mechanisms responsible for this lift production are\nfundamentally unsteady and depend on the shed vorticity. Here, we consider a\nmodel system of a two-dimensional flyer and compute the unsteady, two-way\ncoupling between the flyer and the surrounding fluid in the context of the\nvortex sheet model. We examine in detail the flow properties (frequency and\nspeed) required for hovering and their dependence on the flyer's\ncharacteristics (mass and geometry). We find that the aerodynamic effort\nrequired to hover is an intrinsic property of the flyer itself: a given flyer\nrequires a constant amount of effort to hover, irrespective of the frequency\nand speed of the oscillating flow. This physical insight will potentially have\nsignificant implications on the design of unmanned air vehicles as well as on\nunderstanding active hovering of live organisms that can manipulate their\nflapping motion to favor a larger oscillation amplitude or frequency.\n", "  A new class of multi-scale structures, referred to as `parabolic\nmetamaterials' is introduced and studied in this paper. For an elastic\ntwo-dimensional triangular lattice, we identify dynamic regimes, which\ncorresponds to so-called `Dirac Bridges' on the dispersion surfaces. Such\nregimes lead to a highly localised and focussed unidirectional beam when the\nlattice is excited. We also show that the flexural rigidities of elastic\nligaments are essential in establishing the `parabolic metamaterial' regimes.\n", "  Beyond the conventional quantum regression theorem, a general formula for\nnon-Markovian correlation functions of arbitrary system operators both in the\ntime- and frequency-domain is given. We approach the problem by transforming\nthe conventional time-nonlocal master equation into dispersed time-local\nequations-of-motion. The validity of our approximations is discussed and we\nfind that the non-Markovian terms have to be included for short times. While\ncalculations of the density matrix at short times suffer from the initial value\nproblem, a correlation function has a well defined initial state. The resulting\nformula for the non-Markovian correlation function has a simple structure and\nis as convenient in its application as the conventional quantum regression\ntheorem for the Markovian case. For illustrations, we apply our method to\ninvestigate the spectrum of the current fluctuations of interacting quantum\ndots contacted with two electrodes. The corresponding non-Markovian\ncharacteristics are demonstrated.\n", "  It is well known that superconductivity in Fe-based materials is favoured\nunder tetragonal symmetry, whereas competing orders such as spin-density-wave\n(SDW) and nematic orders emerge or are reinforced upon breaking the fourfold\n(C4) symmetry. Accordingly, suppression of orthorhombicity below the\nsuperconducting transition temperature (Tc) is found in underdoped compounds.\nEpitaxial film growth on selected substrates allows the design of crystal\nspecific lattice distortions. Here we show that despite the breakdown of the C4\nsymmetry induced by a 5% difference in the lattice parameters, monolayers of\nFeSe grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on the (110) surface of SrTiO3 (STO)\nsubstrates [FeSe/STO(110)] exhibit a large nearly isotropic superconducting\n(SC) gap of 16 meV closing around 60 K. Our results on this new interfacial\nmaterial, similar to those obtained previously on FeSe/STO(001), contradict the\ncommon belief that the C4 symmetry is essential for reaching high Tc's in\nFe-based superconductors.\n", "  We consider the impact of several flavour-changing observables in the $B$-\nand the Kaon sectors on the parameter space of the NMSSM, in a minimal flavour\nviolating version of this model. Our purpose consists in updating our previous\nresults in arXiv:0710.3714 and designing an up-to-date flavour test for the\npublic package NMSSMTools. We provide details concerning our implementation of\nthe constraints in a series of brief reviews of the current status of the\nconsidered channels. Finally, we present a few consequences of these flavour\nconstraints for the NMSSM, turning to two specific scenarios: one is\ncharacteristic of the MSSM-limit and illustrates the workings of charged-Higgs\nand genuinely supersymmetric contributions to flavour-changing processes; the\nsecond focus is a region where a light CP-odd Higgs is present. Strong limits\nare found whenever an enhancement factor - large $\\tan\\beta$, light $H^{\\pm}$,\nresonant pseudoscalar - comes into play.\n", "  We present FabSim, a toolkit developed to simplify a range of computational\ntasks for researchers in diverse disciplines. FabSim is flexible, adaptable,\nand allows users to perform a wide range of tasks with ease. It also provides a\nsystematic way to automate the use of resourcess, including HPC and distributed\nresources, and to make tasks easier to repeat by recording contextual\ninformation. To demonstrate this, we present three use cases where FabSim has\nenhanced our research productivity. These include simulating cerebrovascular\nbloodflow, modelling clay-polymer nanocomposites across multiple scales, and\ncalculating ligand-protein binding affinities.\n", "  The Feynman rules assign to every graph an integral which can be written as a\nfunction of a scaling parameter L. Assuming L for the process under\nconsideration is very small, so that contributions to the renormalizaton group\nare small, we can expand the integral and only consider the lowest orders in\nthe scaling. The aim of this article is to determine specific combinations of\ngraphs in a scalar quantum field theory that lead to a remarkable\nsimplification of the first non-trivial term in the perturbation series. It\nwill be seen that the result is independent of the renormalization scheme and\nthe scattering angles. To achieve that goal we will utilize the parametric\nrepresentation of scalar Feynman integrals as well as the Hopf algebraic\nstructure of the Feynman graphs under consideration. Moreover, we will present\na formula which reduces the effort of determining the first-order term in the\nperturbation series for the specific combination of graphs to a minimum.\n", "  Recent field experiments conducted in the near-wake (up to 0.5 rotor\ndiameters downwind of the rotor) of a 2.5 MW wind turbine using snow-based\nsuper-large-scale particle image velocimetery (SLPIV) (Hong et al., Nature\nComm., vol. 5, 2014, no. 4216) were successful in visualizing tip vortex cores\nas areas devoid of snowflakes. The so-visualized snow voids, however, suggested\ntip vortex cores of complex shape consisting of circular cores with distinct\nelongated comet-like tails. We employ large-eddy simulation (LES) to elucidate\nthe structure and dynamics of the complex tip vortices identified\nexperimentally. The LES is shown to reproduce vortex cores in good qualitative\nagreement with the SLPIV results, essentially capturing all vortex core\npatterns observed in the field in the tip shear layer. We show that the\nvisualized vortex patterns are the result of energetic coherent dynamics in the\nrotor tip shear layer driven by interactions between the tip vortices and a\nsecond set of counter-rotating spiral vortices intertwined with the tip\nvortices. We further show that the mean flow within the region where such rich\ncoherent dynamics occur satisfies the instability criterion proposed by\nLeibovich and Stewartson (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 126, 1983, pp. 335--356),\nindicating that the instability uncovered by the SLPIV and the LES is of\ncentrifugal type. This study highlights the feasibility of employing snow voids\nto visualize tip vortices and demonstrates the enormous potential of\nintegrating SLPIV with LES as a powerful tool for gaining novel insights into\nthe wakes of utility scale wind turbines.\n", "  We study the holographic entanglement entropy under small deformations of\nAdS, including time-dependence. It is found through perturbative analysis that\nthe divergent terms are not affected and the change appears only in the finite\nterms. We also consider the entanglement thermodynamic first law, and calculate\nthe entanglement temperature and confirm that it is inversely proportional to\nthe size of the entangling region.\n", "  The SUSY-GUT paradigm is the most promising scenario for the physics beyond\nthe Standard Model. After the LHC run I, it is of interest to reanalyze the\nroom still remaining for SUSY-GUT inspired models and to study the limits on\nthe SUSY mass spectrum. Assuming one step unification of gauge couplings, under\nsome natural requirements we have obtained the energy upper bound for the\nobservation of SUSY phenomenology. We found that in the SUSY-GUT framework the\nmass of lightest gluino or Higgsino cannot be larger than about 20 TeV.\n", "  In this paper, we propose some efficient and robust numerical methods to\ncompute the ground states and dynamics of Fractional Schr\\\"{o}dinger Equation\n(FSE) with a rotation term and nonlocal nonlinear interactions. In particular,\na newly developed Gaussian-sum (GauSum) solver is used for the nonlocal\ninteraction evaluation \\cite{EMZ2015}. To compute the ground states, we\nintegrate the preconditioned Krylov subspace pseudo-spectral method \\cite{AD1}\nand the GauSum solver. For the dynamics simulation, using the rotating\nLagrangian coordinates transform \\cite{BMTZ2013}, we first reformulate the FSE\ninto a new equation without rotation. Then, a time-splitting pseudo-spectral\nscheme incorporated with the GauSum solver is proposed to simulate the new FSE.\n", "  We present a scheme for generating robust and persistent entanglement between\nqubits that do not interact and that are separated by a long and lossy\ntransmission channel, using Markovian reservoir engineering. The proposal uses\nonly the correlated decay into the common channel of remotely separated, driven\nsingle-photon qubit transitions. This simple scheme is generic and applicable\nto various experimental implementations, including circuit and cavity QED, with\nlittle experimental overhead compared with methods requiring dynamic control,\ninitialization, measurement, or feedback. In addition to avoiding these\ninefficiencies, the simple protocol is highly robust against noise,\nmiscalibration, and loss in the channel. We find high quality solutions over a\nwide range of parameters and show that the optimal strategy reflects a\ntransition from ballistic to diffusive photon transmission, going from\nsymmetrically and coherently driving a common steady state to asymmetrically\nabsorbing photons that are emitted from one qubit by the second. Detailed\nanalysis of the role of the transmission channel shows that allowing\nbi-directional decay drastically increases indistinguishability and thereby\nquadratically suppresses infidelity.\n", "  Nonlinear and nonlocal effects are discussed in the interaction of laser\nfields with thermal Rydberg atoms in electromagnetically induced transparency\nconfiguration. We show that under the crucial approximation that the time\nvariation in the dipole-dipole interactions due to atomic motions can be\nneglected in an ensemble average, an analytical form can be obtained for the\nnonlocal nonlinear atomic response of the thermal medium, and study it for\ndifferent parameter cases. We further propose a generalized model to describe\nthe modulational instability (MI) in absorptive nonlinear media, in order to\nunderstand the propagation dynamics in the thermal Rydberg medium.\nInterestingly, this model predicts that at short propagation distances, each\nwave component exhibits the MI effect in absorptive nonlinear media, unlike in\nthe purely dispersive case.\n", "  The phenomenology of magnetic damping is of critical importance for devices\nthat seek to exploit the electronic spin degree of freedom since damping\nstrongly affects the energy required and speed at which a device can operate.\nHowever, theory has struggled to quantitatively predict the damping, even in\ncommon ferromagnetic materials. This presents a challenge for a broad range of\napplications in spintronics and spin-orbitronics that depend on materials and\nstructures with ultra-low damping. Such systems enable many experimental\ninvestigations that further our theoretical understanding of numerous magnetic\nphenomena such as damping and spin-transport mediated by chirality and the\nRashba effect. Despite this requirement, it is believed that achieving\nultra-low damping in metallic ferromagnets is limited due to the scattering of\nmagnons by the conduction electrons. However, we report on a binary alloy of Co\nand Fe that overcomes this obstacle and exhibits a damping parameter\napproaching 0.0001, which is comparable to values reported only for\nferrimagnetic insulators. We explain this phenomenon by a unique feature of the\nbandstructure in this system: The density of states exhibits a sharp minimum at\nthe Fermi level at the same alloy concentration at which the minimum in the\nmagnetic damping is found. This discovery provides both a significant\nfundamental understanding of damping mechanisms as well as a test of\ntheoretical predictions.\n", "  I suggest an effective model between the GUT and the electroweak scale. It\nonly introduces the two symmetries of $U(1)_{B-L}$ and $U(1)_{D}$ besides the\nSM groups. The two symmetries are individually broken at the reheating\ntemperature of the universe of $10^{12}$ GeV and the scale of $3\\sim 4$ TeV.\nThe model can simultaneously accommodate the tiny neutrino masses, the\nmatter-antimatter asymmetry and the cold dark matter (CDM). In particular, the\nmodel gives some interesting results and predictions, for instance, the\nneutrinos are Dirac nature and their masses are related to the $U(1)_{D}$\nbreaking, the size of the matter-antimatter asymmetry is closely related to the\nmass hierarchy of the quarks and charged leptons, the CDM mass is probably in\nthe range of $250\\sim 350$ GeV. Finally, it is feasible to test the model in\nfuture collider experiments.\n", "  Dynamics of non-interacting ultracold atoms with artificial spin-orbit\ncoupling is considered. Spin-orbit coupling is created using two moving optical\nlattices with orthogonal polarizations. Our main goal is to study influence of\nlattice noise on Rabi oscillations. Special attention is paid to the phenomenon\nof the Zitterbewegung being trembling motion caused by Rabi transitions between\nstates with different velocities. Phase and amplitude fluctuations of lattices\nare modelled by means of the two-dimensional stochastic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck\nprocess, also known as harmonic noise. In the the noiseless case the problem is\nsolved analytically in terms of the momentum representation. It is shown that\nlattice noise significantly extends duration of the Zitterbewegung as compared\nto the noiseless case. This effect originates from noise-induced decoherence of\nRabi oscillations.\n", "  Light trapping in planar ultrathin-film solar cells is limited due to a small\nnumber of optical modes available in the thin-film slab. A nanostructured\nthin-film design could surpass this limit by providing broadband increase in\nthe local density of states in a subwavelength volume and maintaining efficient\ncoupling of light. Here we report a broadband metasurface design, enabling\nefficient and broadband absorption enhancement by direct coupling of incoming\nlight to resonant modes of subwavelength-scale Mie nanoresonators defined in\nthe thin-film active layer. Absorption was investigated both theoretically and\nexperimentally in prototypes consisting of lithographically patterned,\ntwo-dimensional periodic arrays of silicon nanoresonators on silica substrates.\nA crossed trapezoid resonator shape of rectangular cross section is used to\nexcite broadband Mie resonances across the visible and near-IR spectra. Our\nnumerical simulations, optical absorption measurements and photocurrent\nspectral response measurements demonstrate that crossed trapezoidal Mie\nresonant structures enable angle-insensitive, broadband absorption. A short\ncircuit current density of 12.0 mA/cm2 is achieved in 210 nm thick patterned Si\nfilms, yielding a 4-fold increase compared to planar films of the same\nthickness. It is suggested that silicon metasurfaces with Mie resonator arrays\ncan provide useful insights to guide future ultrathin-film solar cell designs\nincorporating nanostructured thin active layers.\n", "  We propose a simple yet efficient mechanism for passive error correction in\ntopological quantum memories. Our scheme relies on driven-dissipative ancilla\nsystems which couple to local excitations (anyons) and make them \"sink\" in\nenergy, with no required interaction among ancillae or anyons. Through this\nprocess, anyons created by some thermal environment end up trapped in potential\n\"trenches\" that they themselves generate, which can be interpreted as a \"memory\nfoam\" for anyons. This self-trapping mechanism provides an energy barrier for\nanyon propagation, and removes entropy from the memory by favoring anyon\nrecombination over anyon separation (responsible for memory errors). We\ndemonstrate that our scheme leads to an exponential increase of the\nmemory-coherence time with system size $L$, up to an upper bound\n$L_\\mathrm{max}$ which can increase exponentially with $\\Delta/T$, where $T$ is\nthe temperature and $\\Delta$ is some energy scale defined by potential\ntrenches. This results in a double exponential increase of the memory time with\n$\\Delta/T$, which greatly improves over the Arrhenius (single-exponential)\nscaling found in typical quantum memories.\n", "  For high-redshift submillimetre or millimetre sources detected with single\ndish telescopes, interferometric follow-up has shown that many are multiple\nsubmm galaxies blended together. Confusion-limited Herschel observations of\nsuch targets are also available, and these sample the peak of their spectral\nenergy distribution in the far-infrared. Many methods for analysing these data\nhave been adopted, but most follow the traditional approach of extracting\nfluxes before model spectral energy distributions are fit, which has the\npotential to erase important information on degeneracies among fitting\nparameters and glosses over the intricacies of confusion noise. Here, we adapt\nthe forward-modelling method that we originally developed to disentangle a\nhigh-redshift strongly-lensed galaxy group, in order to tackle this problem in\na more statistically rigorous way, by combining source deblending and SED\nfitting into the same procedure. We call this method \"SEDeblend.\" As an\napplication, we derive constraints on far-infrared luminosities and dust\ntemperatures for sources within the ALMA follow-up of the LABOCA Extended\nChandra Deep Field South Submillimetre Survey. We find an average dust\ntemperature for an 870 micron-selected sample of (33.9+-2.4) K for the full\nsurvey. When selection effects of the sample are considered, we find no\nevidence that the average dust temperature evolves with redshift.\n", "  The common interpretation of elliptic flow $v_2$ in heavy ion collisions is\nthat it is produced by hydrodynamic flow at low transverse momentum and by\nparton energy loss at high transverse momentum. Here, we discuss this\ninterpretation in view of the dependence of $v_2$ with energy, rapidity and\nsystem size, and show that it is far from clear how the relevant properties\nnecessary for this interpretation, low viscosity and high opacity, turn on. A\nlow energy collider such as NICA is essential for this interpretation to be\nverified, understood and related to the fundamental properties of hadronic\nmatter\n", "  Fault-tolerant quantum computing in systems composed of both Majorana\nfermions and topologically unprotected quantum systems, e.g. superconducting\ncircuits or quantum dots, is studied in this paper. Errors caused by\ntopologically unprotected quantum systems need to be corrected with error\ncorrection schemes, for instance, the surface code. We find that the\nerror-correction performance of such a hybrid topological quantum computer is\nnot superior to a normal quantum computer unless the topological charge of\nMajorana fermions is insusceptible to noise. If errors changing the topological\ncharge are rare, the fault-tolerance threshold is much higher than the\nthreshold of a normal quantum computer, and a surface-code logical qubit could\nbe encoded in only tens of topological qubits instead of about a thousand\nnormal qubits.\n", "  In this paper, we show that there exists a class of dilaton models with\nnon-trivial scalar-Ricci and scalar-matter couplings that strongly reduces\nobservational deviations from general relativity in the dust limit.\nEssentially, depending on the coupling between the dilaton and the fundamental\nmatter fields, various strengths of decoupling can appear. They range from no\ndecoupling at all to a total decoupling state. In this latter case, the theory\nbecomes indistinguishable from general relativity (in the dust limit), as all\ndilatonic effects can be re-absorbed through a simple change of unit.\n  Furthermore, for particular decouplings, we show that the phenomenology used\nto constrain theories from universality of free fall observations is\nsignificantly different from what is commonly used. Finally, from a fundamental\nperspective, the class of non-dynamical decouplings proposed in this paper\nmight play a role in the current non-observation of any deviation from general\nrelativity (in both tests of the equivalence principle and of the parametrized\npost-Newtonian formalism).\n", "  ATLAS and CMS observe deviations from the expected background in the diphoton\ninvariant mass searches of new resonances around 750 GeV. We show that a simple\nrealization in terms of a new pseudoscalar state can accommodate the\nobservations. The model leads to further footprints that can be soon observed.\nThe new state can be interpreted both as an axion or as a {highly natural}\ncomposite state arising from minimal models of dynamical electroweak symmetry\nbreaking. We further show how to disentangle the two scenarios. Beyond the\npossible explanation of the diphoton excess the results show that it is\npossible to directly test and constrain composite dynamics via processes\nstemming from its distinctive topological sector.\n", "  We derive a gyrokinetic formalism which is very generally valid: the ordering\nallows both large inhomogeneities in plasma flow and magnetic field at long\nwavelength, like typical drift-kinetic theories, as well as fluctuations at the\ngyro-scale. The underlying approach is to order the vorticity to be small, and\nto assert that the timescales in the local plasma frame are long compared to\nthe gyrofrequency. Unlike most other derivations, we do not treat the long and\nshort wavelength components of the fluctuating fields separately; the\nsingle-field description defines the particle motion and their interaction with\nthe electromagnetic field at small-scale, the system-scale, and intermediate\nlength scales in a unified fashion. As in earlier literature, the work consists\nof identifying a coordinate system where the gyroangle-dependent terms are\nsmall, and using a near-unity transform to systematically find a set of\ncoordinates where the gyroangle dependence vanishes.\n", "  The rapid generation of non-classical light serves as the foundation for\nexploring quantum optics and developing applications such as secure\ncommunication or generation of NOON-states. While strongly coupled quantum\ndot-photonic crystal resonator systems have great potential as non-classical\nlight sources due to their promise of tailored output statistics, the\ngeneration of indistinguishable photons has been obscured due to the strongly\ndissipative nature of such systems. Here, we demonstrate that the recently\ndiscovered self-homodyne suppression technique can be used to overcome this\nlimitation and tune the quantum statistics of transmitted light, achieving\nindistinguishable photon emission competitive with state-of-the-art metrics.\nFurthermore, our nanocavity-based platform directly lends itself to scalable\non-chip architectures for quantum information.\n", "  Considering the mass splitting between three active neutrinos, we represent\nthe new constraints on the sum of neutrino mass $\\sum m_\\nu$ by updating the\nanisotropic analysis of Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) scale in the CMASS\nand LOWZ galaxy samples from Data Release 12 of the SDSS-III Baryon Oscillation\nSpectroscopic Survey (BOSS DR12). Combining the BAO data of 6dFGS, MGS, LOWZ\nand CMASS with $\\textit{Planck}$~2015 data of temperature anisotropy and\npolarizations of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), we find that the $95\\%$\nC.L. upper bounds on $\\sum m_\\nu$ refer to $\\sum m_{\\nu,\\rm NH}<0.18$ eV for\nnormal hierarchy (NH), $\\sum m_{\\nu,\\rm IH}<0.20$ eV for inverted hierarchy\n(IH) and $\\sum m_{\\nu,\\rm DH}<0.15$ eV for degenerate hierarchy (DH)\nrespectively, and the normal hierarchy is slightly preferred than the inverted\none ($\\Delta \\chi^2\\equiv \\chi^2_{\\rm NH}-\\chi^2_{\\rm IH} \\simeq -3.4$). In\naddition, the additional relativistic degrees of freedom and massive sterile\nneutrinos are neither favored at present.\n", "  Largely motivated by a number of applications, the dispersion ($C_3$)\ncoefficients for the interaction of a Cs atom with different material media\nsuch as Au (metal), Si (semiconductor) and various dielectric surfaces like\nSiO$_2$, SiN$_{\\rm{x}}$, sapphire and YAG are determined using accurate values\nof the dynamic polarizabilities of the Cs atom obtained employing the\nrelativistic coupled-cluster approach and the dynamic dielectric constants of\nthe walls. Moreover, we also give the retardation coefficients in the graphical\nrepresentation as functions of separation distances to describe the interaction\npotentials between the Cs atom with the above considered material media. For\nthe easy access to the interaction potentials at a given distance of\nseparation, we devise a simple working functional fitting form for the retarded\ncoefficients in terms of two parameters that are quoted for each medium.\n", "  We demonstrate an all-optical Raman spin echo technique, using\nElectromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) to create the different pulses\nof the spin echo sequence: initialization, pi-rotation, and readout. The first\npulse of the sequence induces coherence directly from a mixed state, and the\ntechnique is used to measure the nuclear spin coherence of an inhomogeneously\nbroadened ensemble of rare-earth ions (Pr$^{3+}$). In contrast to previous\nexperiments it does not require any preparatory hole burning pulse sequences,\nwhich greatly shortens the total duration of the sequence. The effect of the\ndifferent pulses is characterized by quantum state tomography and is compared\nwith simulations. We demonstrate two applications of the technique by using the\nspin echo sequence to accurately compensate a magnetic field across our sample,\nand to measure the coherence time at high temperatures up to 11 K, where\nstandard preparation techniques are difficult to implement. We explore the\npotential of the technique and possible applications.\n", "  We consider the existence of non-synchronized fixed points to the Kuramoto\nmodel defined on sparse networks: specifically, networks where each vertex has\ndegree exactly three. We show that \"most\" such networks support multiple\nattracting phase-locked solutions that are not synchronized, and study the\ndepth and width of the basins of attraction of these phase-locked solutions. We\nalso show that it is common in \"large enough\" graphs to find phase-locked\nsolutions where one or more of the links has angle difference greater than\n$\\pi/2$.\n", "  We report the optical imaging of a single atom with nanometer resolution\nusing an adaptive optical alignment technique that is applicable to general\noptical microscopy. By decomposing the image of a single laser-cooled atom, we\nidentify and correct optical aberrations in the system and realize an atomic\nposition sensitivity of $\\approx$ 0.5 nm/$\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$ with a minimum\nuncertainty of 1.7 nm, allowing the direct imaging of atomic motion. This is\nthe highest position sensitivity ever measured for an isolated atom, and opens\nup the possibility of performing out-of-focus 3D particle tracking, imaging of\natoms in 3D optical lattices or sensing forces at the yoctonewton (10$^{-24}$\nN) scale.\n", "  We prove the existence of the dynamics automorphism group for Hamiltonian QCD\non an infinite lattice in R^3, and this is done in a C*-algebraic context. The\nexistence of ground states is also obtained. Starting with the finite lattice\nmodel for Hamiltonian QCD developed by Kijowski & Rudolph, we state its field\nalgebra and a natural representation. We then generalize this representation to\nthe infinite lattice, and construct a Hilbert space which has represented on it\nall the local algebras (i.e. kinematics algebras associated with finite\nconnected sublattices) equipped with the correct graded commutation relations.\nOn a suitably large C*-algebra acting on this Hilbert space, and containing all\nthe local algebras, we prove that there is a one parameter automorphism group,\nwhich is the pointwise norm limit of the local time evolutions along a sequence\nof finite sublattices, increasing to the full lattice. This is our global time\nevolution. We then take as our field algebra the C*-algebra generated by all\nthe orbits of the local algebras w.r.t. the global time evolution. Thus the\ntime evolution creates the field algebra. The time evolution is strongly\ncontinuous on this choice of field algebra, though not on the original larger\nC*-algebra. We define the gauge transformations, explain how to enforce the\nGauss law constraint, show that the dynamics automorphism group descends to the\nalgebra of physical observables and prove that gauge invariant ground states\nexist.\n", "  Typically, in the dynamical theory of extremal events, the function that\ngauges the intensity of a phenomenon is assumed to be convex and maximal, or\nsingular, at a single, or at most a finite collection of points in\nphase--space. In this paper we generalize this situation to fractal landscapes,\ni.e. intensity functions characterized by an uncountable set of singularities,\nlocated on a Cantor set. This reveals the dynamical r\\^ole of classical\nquantities like the Minkowski dimension and content, whose definition we extend\nto account for singular continuous invariant measures. We also introduce the\nconcept of extremely rare event, quantified by non--standard Minkowski\nconstants and we study its consequences to extreme value statistics. Limit laws\nare derived from formal calculations and are verified by numerical experiments.\n", "  Diffraction patterns produced by fast He atoms grazingly impinging on a\nLiF(001) surface are investigated focusing on the influence of the beam\ncollimation. Single- and double- slit collimating devices situated in front of\nthe beam source are considered. To describe the scattering process we use the\nSurface Initial Value Representation (SIVR) approximation, which is a\nsemi-quantum approach that incorporates a realistic description of the initial\nwave packet in terms of the collimating parameters. Our initial wave-packet\nmodel is based on the Van Cittert-Zernike theorem. For a single-slit\ncollimation the width of the collimating aperture controls the shape of the\nazimuthal angle distribution, making different interference mechanisms visible,\nwhile the length of the slit affects the polar angle distribution.\nAdditionally, we found that by means of a double-slit collimation it might be\npossible to obtain a wide polar angle distribution, which is associated with a\nlarge spread of the initial momentum perpendicular to the surface, derived from\nthe uncertainty principle. It might be used as a simple way to probe the\nsurface potential for different normal distances.\n", "  We demonstrate that Kerr-CFT duality can be extended to super-entropic black\nholes, which have non-compact horizons with finite area. We demonstrate that\nthis duality is robust insofar as the ultra-spinning limit of a Kerr-AdS black\nhole (which yields the super-entropic class)commutes with the near-horizon\nlimit (which yields the Kerr-CFT duality). Consequently the Bekeinstein-Hawking\nand the CFT entropies are equivalent. We show that the duality holds for both\nsingly-spinning super-entropic black holes in 4 dimensions and for\ndoubly-spinning super-entropic black holes of gauged supergravity in 5\ndimensions. In both cases we obtain not only the expected left/right\ntemperatures, but also temperatures associated with electric charge and with a\nnew thermodynamic parameter specific to super-entropic black holes.\n", "  Like clustering analysis, community detection aims at assigning nodes in a\nnetwork into different communities. Fdp is a recently proposed density-based\nclustering algorithm which does not need the number of clusters as prior input\nand the result is insensitive to its parameter. However, Fdp cannot be directly\napplied to community detection due to its inability to recognize the community\ncenters in the network. To solve the problem, a new community detection method\n(named IsoFdp) is proposed in this paper. First, we use Isomap technique to map\nthe network data into a low dimensional manifold which can reveal diverse\npair-wised similarity. Then Fdp is applied to detect the communities in\nnetworks. An improved partition density function is proposed to select the\nproper number of communities automatically. We test our method on both\nsynthetic and real-world networks, and the results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our algorithm over the state-of-the-art methods.\n", "  A hologram is an optical element storing phase and possibly amplitude\ninformation enabling the reconstruction of a three dimensional image of an\nobject by illumination and scattering of a coherent beam of light, and the\nimage is generated at the same wavelength as the input laser beam. In recent\nyears it was shown that information can be stored in nanometric antennas giving\nrise to ultrathin components. Here we demonstrate nonlinear multi-layer\nmetamaterial holograms where by the nonlinear process of Third Harmonic\nGeneration, a background free image is formed at a new frequency which is the\nthird harmonic of the illuminating beam. Using e-beam lithography of multilayer\nplasmonic nanoantennas, we fabricate polarization-sensitive nonlinear elements\nsuch as blazed gratings, lenses and other computer-generated holograms. These\nholograms are analyzed and prospects for future device applications are\ndiscussed.\n", "  The hidden charm pentaquark state $P_c(4450)$ observed recently by the LHCb\ncollaboration may be of molecular nature, as advocated by some unitary\napproaches that also predict pentaquark partners in the strangeness $S=-1$\nsector. In this work we argue that a hidden-charm strange pentaquark could be\nseen from the decay of the $\\Lambda_b$, just as in the case of the non-strange\n$P_c(4450)$, but looking into the $J/\\psi \\eta \\Lambda$ decay mode and forming\nthe invariant mass spectrum of $J/\\psi\\Lambda$ pairs. In the model presented\nhere, which assumes a standard weak decay topology and incorporates the\nhadronization process and final state interaction effects, we find the $J/\\psi\n\\eta \\Lambda$ final states to be populated with similar strength as the $J/\\psi\nK^- p$ states employed for the observation of the non-strange pentaquark. This\nmakes the $\\Lambda_ b \\to J/\\psi \\eta \\Lambda$ decay to be an interesting\nprocess to observe a possible strange partner of the $P_c(4450)$ . We study the\ndependence of the $J/\\psi \\Lambda$ mass spectra on various model ingredients\nand on the unknown properties of the strange pentaquark.\n", "  We have developed a theory for inhomogeneous systems that allows for\nincorporation of effects of mesoscopic fluctuations. A hierarchy of equations\nrelating the correlation and direct correlation functions for the local excess\n$\\phi({\\bf r})$ of the volume fraction of particles $\\zeta$ has been obtained,\nand an approximation leading to a closed set of equations for the two-point\nfunctions has been introduced. We have solved numerically the self-consistent\nequations for one (1D) and three (3D) dimensional models with short-range\nattraction and long-rannge repulsion (SALR). Predictions for all the\nqualitative properties of the 1D model agree with the exact results, but only\nsemi-quantitative agreement is obtained in the simplest version of the theory.\nThe effects of fluctuations in the two considered 3D models are significantly\ndifferent, despite very similar properties of these models in the mean-field\napproximation. In both cases we obtain the sequence of large - small - large\ncompressibility for increasing $\\zeta$. The very small compressibility is\naccompanied by the oscillatory decay of correlations with the correlation\nlength orders of magnitude larger than the size of particles. Only in one of\nthe two considered models for decreasing temperature the small compressibility\nbecomes very small and the large compressibility becomes very large, and\neventually van der Waals loops appear. Further studies are necessary to\ndetermine the nature of the strongly inhomogeneous phase present for\nintermediate volume fractions in 3D.\n", "  We propose to interpret the 750 GeV diphoton excess in a typical topflavor\nseesaw model. The new resonance X can be identified as a CP-even scalar\nemerging from a certain bi-doublet Higgs field. Such a scalar can couple to\ncharged scalars, fermions as well as heavy gauge bosons predicted by the model,\nand consequently all of the particles contribute to the diphoton decay mode of\nthe X. Numerical analysis indicates that the model can predict the central\nvalue of the diphoton excess without contradicting any constraints from 8 TeV\nLHC, and among the constraints, the tightest one comes from the Z \\gamma\nchannel, \\sigma_{8 {\\rm TeV}}^{Z \\gamma} \\lesssim 3.6 {\\rm fb}, which requires\n\\sigma_{13 {\\rm TeV}}^{\\gamma \\gamma} \\lesssim 6 {\\rm fb} in most of the\nfavored parameter space.\n", "  In this paper we explain the 750 GeV diphoton resonance observed at the run-2\nLHC as a scalar singlet $S$, that plays a key rule in generating tiny but\nnonzero Majorana neutrino masses. The model contains four electroweak singlets:\ntwo leptoquarks, a singly charged scalar and a neutral scalar $S$. Majorana\nneutrino masses might be generated at the two-loop level as $S$ get nonzero\nvacuum expectation value. $S$ can be produced at the LHC through the gluon\nfusion and decays into diphoton at the one-loop level with charged scalars\nrunning in the loop. The model fits perfectly with a wide width of the\nresonance. Constraints on the model are investigated, which shows a negligible\nmixing between the resonance and the standard model Higgs boson.\n", "  We study the evolution of giant clumps in high-z disc galaxies using AMR\ncosmological simulations at redshifts z=6-1. Our sample consists of 34\ngalaxies, of halo masses 10^{11}-10^{12}M_s at z=2, run with and without\nradiation pressure (RP) feedback from young stars. While RP has little effect\non the sizes and global stability of discs, it reduces the amount of\nstar-forming gas by a factor of ~2, leading to a decrease in stellar mass by a\nsimilar factor by z~2. Both samples undergo violent disc instability (VDI) and\nform giant clumps of masses 10^7-10^9M_s at a similar rate, though RP\nsignificantly reduces the number of long-lived clumps. When RP is (not)\nincluded, clumps with circular velocity <40(20)km/s, baryonic surface density\n<200(100)M_s/pc^2 and baryonic mass <10^{8.2}(10^{7.3})M_s are short-lived,\ndisrupted in a few free-fall times. The more massive and dense clumps survive\nand migrate toward the disc centre over a few disc orbital times. In the RP\nsimulations, the distribution of clump masses and star-formation rates (SFRs)\nnormalized to their host disc is very similar at all redshifts. They exhibit a\ntruncated power-law with a slope slightly shallower than -2. Short-lived clumps\npreferentially have young stellar ages, low masses, high gas fractions and\nspecific SFRs (sSFR), and they tend to populate the outer disc. The sSFR of\nmassive, long-lived clumps declines with age as they migrate towards the disc\ncentre, producing gradients in mass, stellar age, gas fraction, sSFR and\nmetallicity that distinguish them from short-lived clumps. Ex situ mergers make\nup ~37% of the mass in clumps and ~29% of the SFR. They are more massive and\nwith older stellar ages than the in situ clumps, especially near the disc edge.\nRoughly half the galaxies at redshifts z=4-1 are clumpy over a wide range of\nstellar mass, with clumps accounting for ~3-30% of the SFR but ~0.1-3% of the\nstellar mass.\n", "  We define a nonabelian version of particle-vortex duality, by dimensionally\nextending usual (1+1)-dimensional nonabelian T-duality to (2+1) dimensions.\nWhile we will explicitly describe a global $SU(2)$ symmetry, our methods can\nalso be applied to a larger group $G$, by gauging an appropriate subgroup. We\nwill exemplify our duality with matter in both adjoint and fundamental\nrepresentations by considering a modification of ${\\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric\nYang-Mills theory (Seiberg-Witten theory reduced to (2+1) dimensions), and an\n$SU(2)\\times U(1)$ color-flavor locked theory that exhibits nonabelian vortex\nsolutions.\n", "  We systematically investigate ways to twist a real spectral triple via an\nalgebra automorphism and in particular, we naturally define a twisted partner\nfor any real graded spectral triple. Among other things we investigate\nconsequences of the twisting on the fluctuations of the metric and possible\napplications to the spectral approach to the standard model of particle\nphysics.\n", "  The holographic quantum entanglement entropy for an infinite strip region of\nthe boundary for the field theory dual to charged black holes in ${\\cal\nA}dS_{3+1}$ is investigated. In this framework we elucidate the low and high\ntemperature behavior of the entanglement entropy pertaining to various limits\nof the black hole charge. In the low temperature regime we establish a first\nlaw of entanglement thermodynamics for the boundary field theory.\n", "  The highly unidirectional excitation of graphene plasmons (GPs) through\nnear-field interference of orthogonally polarized dipoles is investigated. The\npreferred excitation direction of GPs by a single circularly polarized dipole\ncan be simply understood with the angular momentum conservation law. Moreover,\nthe propagation direction of GPs can be switched not only by changing the phase\ndifference between dipoles, but also by placing the z-polarized dipole to its\nimage position, whereas the handedness of the background field remains the\nsame. The unidirectional excitation of GPs can be extended directly into arc\ngraphene surface as well. Furthermore, our proposal on directional generation\nof GPs can be realized in a semiconductor nanowire/graphene system, where a\nsemiconductor nanowire can mimic the circularly polarized dipole when\nilluminated by two orthogonally polarized plane waves.\n", "  Matrix product states (MPS) illustrate the suitability of tensor networks for\nthe description of interacting many-body systems: ground states of gapped $1$-D\nsystems are approximable by MPS as shown by Hastings [J. Stat. Mech. Theor.\nExp., P08024 (2007)]. In contrast, whether MPS and more general tensor networks\ncan accurately reproduce correlations in critical quantum systems, respectively\nquantum field theories, has not been established rigorously. Ample evidence\nexists: entropic considerations provide restrictions on the form of suitable\nAnsatz states, and numerical studies show that certain tensor networks can\nindeed approximate the associated correlation functions. Here we provide a\ncomplete positive answer to this question in the case of MPS and $2D$ conformal\nfield theory: we give quantitative estimates for the approximation error when\napproximating correlation functions by MPS. Our work is constructive and yields\nan explicit MPS, thus providing both suitable initial values as well as a\nrigorous justification of variational methods.\n", "  We review the mathematical tools required to cull and filter representations\nof the Coxeter Group $BC_4$ into providing bases for the construction of\nminimal off-shell representations of the 4D, $ {\\cal N}$ = 1 spacetime\nsupersymmetry algebra. Of necessity this includes a description of the\nmathematical mechanism by which four dimensional Lorentz symmetry appears as an\nemergent symmetry in the context of one dimensional adinkras with four colors\ndescribed by the Coxeter Group $BC_4$.\n", "  ZrW2O8 exhibits isotropic negative thermal expansions over its entire\ntemperature range of stability, yet so far its physical properties and\nmechanism have not been fully addressed. In this article, the electronic\nstructure, elastic, thermal, optical and phonon properties of {\\alpha}-ZrW2O8\nare systematically investigated from first principles. The agreements between\nthe generalized gradient approximation (GGA) calculation and experiments are\nfound to be quite satisfactory. The calculation results can be useful in\nrelevant material designs, e.g., when ZrW2O8 is employed to adjust the thermal\nexpansion coefficient of ceramic matrix composites.\n", "  Recently, a new type of Weyl semimetal called type-II Weyl semimetal has been\nproposed. Unlike the usual (type-I) Weyl semimetal, which has a point-like\nFermi surface, this new type of Weyl semimetal has a tilted conical spectrum\naround the Weyl point. Here we calculate the anomalous Hall conductivity of a\nWeyl semimetal with a tilted conical spectrum for a pair of Weyl points, using\nthe Kubo formula. We find that the Hall conductivity is not universal and can\nchange sign as a function of the parameters quantifying the tilts. Our results\nsuggest that even for the case where the separation between the Weyl points\nvanishes, tilting of the conical spectrum could give rise to a finite anomalous\nHall effect, if the tilts of the two cones are not identical.\n", "  A lock-in amplifier is a versatile instrument frequently used in physics\nresearch. However, many students struggle with the basic operating principles\nof a lock-in amplifier which can lead to a variety of difficulties. To improve\nstudents' understanding, we have been developing and evaluating a\nresearch-based tutorial which makes use of a computer simulation of a lock-in\namplifier. The tutorial is based on a field-tested approach in which students\nrealize their difficulties after predicting the outcome of simulated\nexperiments involving a lock-in amplifier and check their predictions using the\nsimulated lock-in amplifier. Then, the tutorial provides guidance and strives\nto help students develop a coherent understanding of the basics of a lock-in\namplifier. The tutorial development involved interviews with physics faculty\nmembers and graduate students and iteration of many versions of the tutorial\nwith professors and graduate students. The student difficulties with lock-in\namplifiers and the development and assessment of the research-based tutorial to\nhelp students develop a functional understanding of this device are discussed.\n", "  This paper presents a nonequilibrium thermodynamic model for the relaxation\nof a local, isolated system in nonequilibrium using the principle of steepest\nentropy ascent (SEA), which can be expressed as a variational principle in\nthermodynamic state space. The model is able to arrive at the Onsager relations\nfor such a system. Since no assumption of local equilibrium is made, the\nconjugate fluxes and forces, which result, are intrinsic to the subspaces of\nthe system's state space and are defined using the concepts of hypoequilibrium\nstate and nonequilibrium intensive properties, which describe the non-mutual\nequilibrium status between subspaces of the thermodynamic state space. The\nOnsager relations are shown to be a thermodynamic kinematic feature of the\nsystem independent of the specific details of the micro-mechanical dynamics.\nTwo kinds of relaxation processes are studied with different constraints (i.e.,\nconservation laws) corresponding to heat and mass diffusion. Linear behavior in\nthe near-equilibrium region as well as nonlinear behavior in the\nfar-from-equilibrium region are discussed. Thermodynamic relations in the\nequilibrium and near-equilibrium realm, including the Gibbs relation, the\nClausius inequality, and the Onsager relations, are generalized to the\nfar-from-equilibrium realm. The variational principle in the space spanned by\nthe intrinsic conjugate fluxes and forces is expressed via the quadratic\ndissipation potential. As an application, the model is applied to the heat and\nmass diffusion of a system represented by a single particle ensemble, which can\nalso be applied to a simple system of many particles. Phenomenological\ntransport coefficients are also derived in near-equilibrium realm.\n", "  Social structures emerge as a result of individuals managing a variety of\ndifferent of social relationships. Societies can be represented as highly\nstructured dynamic multiplex networks. Here we study the dynamical origins of\nthe specific community structures of a large-scale social multiplex network of\na human society that interacts in a virtual world of a massive multiplayer\nonline game. There we find substantial differences in the community structures\nof different social actions, represented by the various network layers in the\nmultiplex. Community size distributions are either similar to a power-law or\nappear to be centered around a size of 50 individuals. To understand these\nobservations we propose a voter model that is built around the principle of\ntriadic closure. It explicitly models the co-evolution of node- and\nlink-dynamics across different layers of the multiplex. Depending on link- and\nnode fluctuation rates, the model exhibits an anomalous shattered fragmentation\ntransition, where one layer fragments from one large component into many small\ncomponents. The observed community size distributions are in good agreement\nwith the predicted fragmentation in the model. We show that the empirical\npairwise similarities of network layers, in terms of link overlap and degree\ncorrelations, practically coincide with the model. This suggests that several\ndetailed features of the fragmentation in societies can be traced back to the\ntriadic closure processes.\n", "  The \"trousers\" spacetime is a pair of flat 2D cylinders (\"legs\") merging into\ninto a single one (\"trunk\"). In spite of its simplicity this spacetime has a\nfew features (including, in particular, a naked singularity in the \"crotch\")\neach of which is presumably unphysical, but for none of which a mechanism is\nknown able to prevent its occurrence. Therefore it is interesting and important\nto study the behavior of the quantum fields in such a space. Anderson and\nDeWitt were the first to consider the free scalar field in the trousers\nspacetime. They argued that the crotch singularity produces an infinitely\nbright flash, which was interpreted as evidence that the topology of space is\ndynamically preserved. Similar divergencies were later discovered by Manogue,\nCopeland and Dray who used a more exotic quantization scheme. Later yet the\nsame result obtained within a somewhat different approach led Sorkin to the\nconclusion that the topological transition in question is suppressed in quantum\ngravity.\n  In this paper I show that the Anderson--DeWitt divergence is an artifact of\ntheir choice of the Fock space. By choosing a different one-particle Hilbert\nspace one gets a quantum state in which the components of the stress-energy\ntensor (SET) are bounded in the frame of a free-falling observer.\n", "  The Legendre transformation method, applied in 1987 to deal with purely\nmetric gravitational Lagrangians with nonlinear dependence on the Ricci tensor,\nis extended to metric-affine models and is shown to provide a concise and\ninsightful comparison of the dynamical content of the two variational\nframeworks.\n", "  We shall review conformal gravity as a gauge natural theory and discuss the\nconsequences of Weyl covariance on the definition of physical states.\n", "  The aggressive scaling of silicon-based nanoelectronics has reached the\nregime where device function is affected not only by the presence of individual\ndopants, but more critically their position in the structure. The quantitative\ndetermination of the positions of subsurface dopant atoms is an important issue\nin a range of applications from channel doping in ultra-scaled transistors to\nquantum information processing, and hence poses a significant challenge. Here,\nwe establish a metrology combining low-temperature scanning tunnelling\nmicroscopy (STM) imaging and a comprehensive quantum treatment of the\ndopant-STM system to pin-point the exact lattice-site location of sub-surface\ndopants in silicon. The technique is underpinned by the observation that STM\nimages of sub surface dopants typically contain many atomic-sized features in\nordered patterns, which are highly sensitive to the details of the STM tip\norbital and the absolute lattice-site position of the dopant atom itself. We\ndemonstrate the technique on two types of dopant samples in silicon -- the\nfirst where phosphorus dopants are placed with high precision, and a second\ncontaining randomly placed arsenic dopants. Based on the quantitative agreement\nbetween STM measurements and multi-million-atom calculations, the precise\nlattice site of these dopants is determined, demonstrating that the metrology\nworks to depths of about 36 lattice planes. The ability to uniquely determine\nthe exact positions of sub-surface dopants down to depths of 5 nm will provide\ncritical knowledge in the design and optimisation of nanoscale devices for both\nclassical and quantum computing applications.\n", "  The largest observed supermassive black holes (SMBHs) have a mass of M_BH ~\n10^{10} M_sun, nearly independent of redshift, from the local (z~0) to the\nearly (z>6) Universe. We suggest that the growth of SMBHs above a few 10^{10}\nM_sun is prevented by small-scale accretion physics, independent of the\nproperties of their host galaxies or of cosmology. Growing more massive BHs\nrequires a gas supply rate from galactic scales onto a nuclear region as high\nas >10^3 M_sun/yr. At such a high accretion rate, most of the gas converts to\nstars at large radii (~10-100 pc), well before reaching the BH. We adopt a\nsimple model (Thompson et al. 2005) for a star-forming accretion disk, and find\nthat the accretion rate in the sub-pc nuclear region is reduced to the smaller\nvalue of at most a few M_sun/yr. This prevents SMBHs from growing above\n~10^{11} M_sun in the age of the Universe. Furthermore, once a SMBH reaches a\nsufficiently high mass, this rate falls below the critical value at which the\naccretion flow becomes advection dominated. Once this transition occurs, BH\nfeeding can be suppressed by strong outflows and jets from hot gas near the BH.\nWe find that the maximum SMBH mass, given by this transition, is between\nM_{BH,max} ~ (1-6) * 10^{10} M_sun, depending primarily on the efficiency of\nangular momentum transfer inside the galactic disk, and not on other properties\nof the host galaxy.\n", "  We present a simple, frequency domain, preprocessing step to Kirchhoff\nmigration that allows the method to image scatterers when the wave field phase\ninformation is lost at the receivers, and only intensities are measured. The\nresulting imaging method does not require knowing the phases of the probing\nfield or manipulating the phase of the wave field at the receivers. In a regime\nwhere the scattered field is small compared to the probing field, the problem\nof recovering the full-waveform scattered field from intensity data can be\nformulated as an embarrassingly simple least-squares problem. Although this\nonly recovers the projection (on a known subspace) of the full-waveform\nscattered field, we show that, for high frequencies, this projection gives\nKirchhoff images asymptotically identical to the images obtained with full\nwaveform data. Our method can also be used when the source is modulated by a\nGaussian process and autocorrelations are measured at an array of receivers.\n", "  Mechanical stress plays an intricate role in gene expression in individual\ncells and sculpting of developing tissues. However, systematic methods of\nstudying how mechanical stress and feedback help to harmonize cellular\nactivities within a tissue have yet to be developed. Motivated by our\nobservation of the cellular constriction chains (CCCs) during the initial phase\nof ventral furrow formation in the Drosophila melanogaster embryo, we propose\nan active granular fluid (AGF) model that provides valuable insights into\ncellular coordination in the apical constriction process. In our model, cells\nare treated as circular particles connected by a predefined force network, and\nthey undergo a random constriction process in which the particle constriction\nprobability P is a function of the stress exerted on the particle by its\nneighbors. We find that when P favors tensile stress, constricted particles\ntend to form chain-like structures. In contrast, constricted particles tend to\nform compact clusters when P favors compression. A remarkable similarity of\nconstricted-particle chains and CCCs observed in vivo provides indirect\nevidence that tensile-stress feedback coordinates the apical constriction\nactivity. We expect that our particle-based AGF model will be useful in\nanalyzing mechanical feedback effects in a wide variety of morphogenesis and\norganogenesis phenomena.\n", "  The liquid scintillator (LS) has been widely utilized in the past, running\nand future neutrino experiments, and requirement to the LS radio-purity is\nhigher and higher. The water extraction is a powerful method to remove soluble\nradioactive nuclei, and a mini-extraction station has been constructed. To\nevaluate the extraction efficiency and optimize the operation parameters, a\nsetup to load radioactivity to LS and a laboratory scale setup to measure\nradioactivity which use Bi^{212}-Po^{212}-Pb^{208} cascade decay are developed.\nExperiences from laboratory study will be useful to large scale water\nextraction plants design and the optimization of working in future.\n", "  The case-study teaching method has a long history (starting at least with\nSocrates), and wide current use in business schools, medical schools, law\nschools, and a variety of other disciplines. However, relatively little use is\nmade of it in the physical sciences, specifically in physics or astronomy. The\ncase-study method should be considered by physics faculty as part of the effort\nto transition the teaching of college physics from the traditional\nfrontal-lecture format to other formats that enhance active student\nparticipation. In this paper we endeavor to interest physics instructors in the\ncase-study method, and hope that it would also serve as a call for more\ninstructors to produce cases that they use in their own classes and that can\nalso be adopted by other instructors.\n", "  Here we present a catalogue of known Fast Radio Burst (FRB) sources in the\nform of an online catalogue, FRBCAT. The catalogue includes information about\nthe instrumentation used for the observations for each detected burst, the\nmeasured quantities from each observation, and model-dependent quantities\nderived from observed quantities. To aid in consistent comparisons of burst\nproperties such as width and signal-to-noise ratios we have reprocessed all the\nbursts for which we have access to the raw data, with software which we make\navailable. The originally derived properties are also listed for comparison.\nThe catalogue is hosted online as a MySQL database which can also be downloaded\nin tabular or plain text format for off-line use. This database will be\nmaintained for use by the community for studies of the FRB population as it\ngrows.\n", "  A procedure to measure the residual tilt angle $\\tau$ between a flat surface\nand the azimuthal rotation axis of the sample holder is described. When the\nincidence angle $\\theta$ and readout of the azimuthal angle $\\phi$ are\ncontrolled by motors, an active compensation mechanism can be implemented to\nreduce the effect of the tilt angle during azimuthal motion. After this\ncorrection, the effective angle of incidence is kept fixed, and only the small\nresidual oscillation of the scattering plane remains.\n", "  Using the \"Liouville space\" (the space of operators) of the massive Dirac\ntheory, we define mixed-state form factors of $U(1)$ twist fields. We consider\nmixed states with density matrices diagonal in the asymptotic particle basis.\nThis includes the thermal Gibbs state as well as all generalized Gibbs\nensembles of the Dirac theory. When the mixed state is specialized to a thermal\nGibbs state, using a Riemann-Hilbert problem and low-temperature expansion, we\nobtain finite-temperature form factors of $U(1)$ twist fields. We then propose\nthe expression for form factors of $U(1)$ twist fields in general diagonal\nmixed states. We verify that these form factors satisfy a system of nonlinear\nfunctional differential equations, which is derived from the trace definition\nof mixed-state form factors. At last, under weak analytic conditions on the\neigenvalues of the density matrix, we write down the large distance form factor\nexpansions of two-point correlation functions of these twist fields. Using the\nrelation between the Dirac and Ising models, this provides the large-distance\nexpansion of the R$\\acute{\\text{e}}$nyi entropy (for integer\nR$\\acute{\\text{e}}$nyi parameter) in the Ising model in diagonal mixed states.\n", "  High energy (CERN SPS and LHC) inelastic $pp$ ($p\\bar p$) scattering is\ntreated in the framework of additive quark model together with Pomeron exchange\ntheory. We extract the midrapidity inclusive density of the charged secondaries\nproduced in a single quark-quark collision and investigate its energy\ndependence. Predictions for the $\\pi p$ collisions are presented.\n", "  We propose a simple method to evaluate $\\alpha$-transition rates to low-lying\nexcited states in even-even nuclei. For this a realistic $\\alpha$-daughter\ndouble folding interaction is approximated by a parabola in the region where\nthe decay process takes place. This allows us to evaluate the penetration\nprobability analytically. The main experimental features of branching ratios to\nexcited states are reproduced by this simple approach.\n", "  Detailed numerical simulations of intrinsic Josephson junctions of high\ntemperature superconductors under external electromagnetic radiation are\nperformed taking into account a charge imbalance effect. We demonstrate that\nthe charge imbalance is responsible for a slope in the Shapiro step the value\nof which increases with a nonequilibrium parameter. Coupling between junctions\nleads to the distribution of the slope's values along the stack. The\nnonperiodic boundary conditions shift the Shapiro step in IV-characteristics\nfrom the canonical position determined by $V_{ss}=\\hbar f /(2e)$, where $f$ is\na frequency of external radiation. This fact makes ambiguous the interpretation\nof the experimentally found Shapiro step shift by the charge imbalance effect.\n", "  We give a simple iterative procedure to compute the classical conformal\nblocks on the sphere to all order in the modulus.\n", "  Using mean-field hydrodynamic models of the solar angular momentum balance we\nshow that the non-monotonic latitudinal dependence of the radial angular\nmomentum fluxes caused by Lambda-effect can affect the number of the meridional\ncirculation cells stacking in radial direction in the solar convection zone. In\nparticular, our results show the possibility of a complicated triple-cell\nmeridional circulation structure. This pattern consists of two large\ncounterclockwise circulation cells (the N-hemisphere) and a smaller clockwise\ncell located at low latitudes at the bottom of the convection zone.\n", "  The dimensional scaling of the differential cross sections of binary\nreactions $d\\sigma/d t\\sim s^{-(n-2)}$, where $n$ is given by constituent quark\ncounting rules, was predicted for asymptotically high energies $\\sqrt{s}\\gg\nm_i$ and transferred momenta $-t\\gg m_i^2$ at $t/s=const$ (here $s$ and $t$ are\nthe Mandelstam variables and $m_i$ denotes a hadron mass), but manifested\nitself at surprisingly moderate energies of few GeV at large fixed cms angles\n$\\theta_{cm}\\sim 90^\\circ$. This behaviour is observed not only in reactions\nwith free hadrons, but with the deuteron and $^3He$ too both for\nelectromagnetic and pure hadronic interactions. One may suppose that observed\nscaling points out to effective restoration of near-conformal and, probably,\nchiral symmetry in these processes. A systematical experimental study of the\nscaling behaviour of the reactions with the deuteron, $^3H$, $^3He$, and $^4He$\nnuclei is still absent. We consider a possibility to carry out this study in\n$dd$ collisions at the JINR Nuclotron.\n", "  Two interconnected fields of interest are suggested for NICA. Firstly,\nexistence of glueballs is predicted by the theory of strong interaction but --\neven after decades of research -- glueball identification in the physical\nspectrum is still unclear. NICA can help to ascertain experimental glueball\ncandidates via J/Psi decays whose yield is expected to be large. Importance of\nglueballs is not limited to vacuum: since they couple to other meson states,\nglueballs can also be expected to influence signatures of chiral-symmetry\nrestoration in the high-energy phase of strong dynamics. Mass shifting or\nin-medium broadening of vector and axial-vector mesons may occur there but the\nextent of such phenomena is still uncertain. Additionally, glueball properties\ncould also be modified in medium. Exploration of these issues is the second\nsuggested field of interest that can be pursued at NICA.\n", "  Recently neutrino oscillation experiments have shown that it is very likely\nthat there are one or two sterile neutrinos. In this review neutrino\noscillations with one, two, three sterile and three active neutrinos, and\nparameters that are consistent with experiments, are reviewed.\n", "  We develop the representation of infalling observers and bulk fields in the\nCFT as a way to understand the black hole interior in AdS. We first discuss\nproperties of CFT states which are dual to black holes. We then show that in\nthe presence of a Killing horizon bulk fields can be decomposed into pieces we\ncall ingoing and outgoing. The ingoing field admits a simple operator\nrepresentation in the CFT, even inside a small black hole at late times, which\nleads to a simple CFT description of infalling geodesics. This means classical\ninfalling observers will experience the classical geometry in the interior. The\noutgoing piece of the field is more subtle. In an eternal two-sided geometry it\ncan be represented as an operator on the left CFT. In a stable one-sided\ngeometry it can be described using entanglement via the PR construction. But in\nan evaporating black hole trans-horizon entanglement breaks down at the Page\ntime, which means that for old black holes the PR construction fails and the\noutgoing field does not see local geometry. This picture of the interior allows\nthe CFT to reconcile unitary Hawking evaporation with the classical experience\nof infalling observers.\n", "  We study a two-dimensional system of dipolar hard disks in the presence of a\nuniform external electric field $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{E}} $ by Monte Carlo\nsimulations in a square with periodic boundary conditions. The study is\nperformed in both the fluid at high temperature and the phase of living\npolymers at low temperature. In the considered geometry the macroscopic Maxwell\nfield $ \\mathbf{E}$ is computed and found to be equal to the external field\n$\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{E}} $ in both phases. The dielectric properties of the\nsystem in the liquid phase as well as in the polymeric phase are investigated.\n", "  We discuss the isospin effect on the possible phase transition from hadronic\nto quark matter at high baryon density and finite temperatures. The\ntwo-Equation of State (Two-EoS) model is adopted to describe the hadron-quark\nphase transition in dense matter formed in heavy-ion collisions. For the hadron\nsector we use Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) effective models, already tested on\nheavy ion collision (HIC). For the quark phase we consider various effective\nmodels, the MIT-Bag static picture, the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) approach with\nchiral dynamics and finally the NJL coupled to the Polyakov-loop field (PNJL),\nwhich includes both chiral and (de)confinement dynamics. The idea is to extract\nmixed phase properties which appear robust with respect to the model\ndifferences. In particular we focus on the phase transitions of isospin\nasymmetric matter, with two main results: i) an earlier transition to a mixed\nhadron-quark phase, at lower baryon density/chemical potential with respect to\nsymmetric matter; ii) an \"Isospin Distillation\" to the quark component of the\nmixed phase, with predicted effects on the final hadron production. Possible\nobservation signals are suggested to probe in heavy-ion collision experiments\nat intermediate energies, in the range of the NICA program.\n", "  Accurate control of a quantum system is a fundamental requirement in many\nareas of modern science ranging from quantum information processing to\nhigh-precision measurements. A significantly important goal in quantum control\nis to prepare a desired state as fast as possible with sufficiently high\nfidelity allowed by available resources and experimental constraints.\nStimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) is a robust way to realize\nhigh-fidelity state transfer but it requires a sufficiently long operation time\nto satisfy the adiabatic criteria. We here theoretically propose and then\nexperimentally demonstrate a shortcut-to-adiabatic protocol to speed up the\nSTIRAP. By modifying the shapes of the Raman pulses, we experimentally realize\na fast and high-fidelity stimulated Raman shortcut-to-adiabatic passage that is\nrobust against control parameter variations. The all-optical, robust, and fast\nprotocol demonstrated here provides an efficient and practical way to control\nquantum systems.\n", "  We consider a class of generalized Galileon theories within General\nRelativity in space-times of more than two spatial dimensions. We show that\nthese theories do not admit stable, static, spherically symmetric,\nasymptotically flat and traversable Lorentzian wormholes.\n", "  The recently developed framework for quantum theory with no global causal\norder allows for quantum processes in which operations in local laboratories\nare neither causally ordered nor in a probabilistic mixture of definite causal\norders. The causal relation between the laboratories is described by the\nprocess matrix. We show that, if the inputs of the laboratories are measured in\na fixed basis, one can introduce an effective process matrix which is\noperationally indistinguishable from the original one. This effective process\nmatrix can be obtained by applying the von Neumann- Lu\\\"ders update rule for\nnonselective measurements to the original process matrix and in the bipartite\ncase it is compatible with a definite causal order. The latter extends the\noriginal Oreshkov et al. proof where one considers that both the measurement of\nthe input and the re-preparation of the output are performed in a fixed basis.\n", "  We present the characterization of commercial tunnel diode low-level\nmicrowave power detectors at room and cryogenic temperatures. The sensitivity\nas well as the output voltage noise of the tunnel diodes are measured as\nfunctions of the applied microwave power, the signal frequency being 10 GHz. We\nhighlight strong variations of the diode characteristics when the applied\nmicrowave power is higher than few microwatt. For a diode operating at ${4}$ K,\nthe differential gain increases from ${1,000}$ V/W to about ${4,500}$ V/W when\nthe power passes from ${-30}$ dBm to ${-20}$ dBm. The diode present a white\nnoise floor equivalent to a NEP of ${0.8}$ pW/ ${\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}}$ and ${8}$\npW/${ \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}}$ at 4 K and 300 K respectively. Its flicker noise is\nequivalent to a relative amplitude noise power spectral density\n${S_{\\alpha}(1~\\mathrm{Hz})=-120}$~dB/Hz at ${4}$ K. Flicker noise is 10 dB\nhigher at room temperature.\n", "  The prediction of material-specific properties of superconducting systems\nsuch as the electronic structure and the transition temperature is one of the\nmajor challenge in modern solid-state physics. In this paper we present the\nfirst material specific calculations of realistic superconductor -- normal\nmetal heterostructures using density functional theory. In particular, we\ncalculate the quasiparticle spectrum of different normal metal overlayers on a\nNb(100) host. We find that the Andreev reflection leads to the formation of\nmomentum dependent quasiparticle bands in the normal metal. As a consequence,\nthe spectrum has a strongly momentum dependent induced gap. From the thickness\ndependence of the gap size we calculate the superconducting critical\ntemperature of Au/Nb(100) heterostructures where we find very good agreement\nwith experiments. Moreover, predictions are made for similar heterostructures\nof other compounds.\n", "  PSR J1509-5850 is a middle-aged pulsar with the period P ~ 89 ms, spin-down\npower Edot = 5.1 x 10^35 erg/s, at a distance of about 3.8 kpc. We report on\ndeep Chandra X-ray Observatory observations of this pulsar and its pulsar wind\nnebula (PWN). In addition to the previously detected tail extending up to 7'\nsouthwest from the pulsar (the southern outflow), the deep images reveal a\nsimilarly long, faint diffuse emission stretched toward the north (the northern\noutflow) and the fine structure of the compact nebula (CN) in the pulsar\nvicinity. The CN is resolved into two lateral tails and one axial tail pointing\nsouthwest (a morphology remarkably similar to that of the Geminga PWN), which\nsupports the assumption that the pulsar moves towards the northeast. The\nluminosities of the southern and northern outflows are about 1 x 10^33 and 4 x\n10^32 erg/s, respectively. The spectra extracted from four regions of the\nsouthern outflow do not show any softening with increasing distance from the\npulsar. The lack of synchrotron cooling suggests a high flow speed or in-situ\nacceleration of particles. The spectra extracted from two regions of the\nnorthern outflow show a hint of softening with distance from the pulsar, which\nmay indicate slower particle propagation. We speculate that the northern\noutflow is associated with particle leakage from the bow shock apex into the\nISM, while the southern outflow represents the tail of the shocked pulsar wind\nbehind the moving pulsar. We estimate the physical parameters of the observed\noutflows and compare the J1509-5850 PWN with PWNe of other supersonically\nmoving pulsars.\n", "  We give a survey of basic facts of $q$-holonomic functions of one or several\nvariables, following Zeilberger and Sabbah. We provide detailed proofs and\nexamples.\n", "  This paper has studied the minimum traffic delay at a two-phase intersection,\ntaking into account the dynamical evolution process of queues. The feature of\ndelay function has been studied, which indicates that the minimum traffic delay\nmust be achieved when equality holds in at least one of the two constraints. We\nhave derived the minimum delay as well as the corresponding traffic signal\nperiod, which shows that two situations are classified. Under certain\ncircumstance, extra green time is needed for one phase while otherwise no extra\ngreen time should be assigned in both phases. Our work indicates that although\nthe clearing policies were shown in many experiments to be optimal at isolated\nintersections, it is sometimes not the case.\n", "  We study the false vacuum decay of a single scalar field $\\phi$ coupled to\ngravity described by the Coleman-de Luccia (CdL) instanton. We show that it is\npossible to numerically calculate the bounce factor, which is related to the\nCdL tunneling rate, without using the thin-wall approximation. In this paper,\nwe consider $1/\\cosh(\\phi)$- and $\\cos(\\phi)$-type potential as examples, which\nhave cosmological and phenomenological applications. Especially, in the\n$\\cos(\\phi)$-type potential we show that the range of values in which axion\ndecay constant can take is restricted by the form of the periodic potential if\nthe CdL tunneling occurs.\n", "  We discuss the potential of the advanced ground-based gravitational-wave\ndetectors such as LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA to detect generic deviations of\ngravitational waveforms from the predictions of general relativity. We use the\nparameterized post-Einsteinian formalism to characterize the deviations, and\nassess what magnitude of deviations are detectable by using an approximate\ndecision scheme based on Bayesian statistics. We find that there exist\ndetectable regions of the parameterized post-Einsteinian parameters for\ndifferent binary masses from the observation of a single gravitational wave\nevent. The regions are not excluded by currently existing binary pulsar\nobservations for the parameterized post-Einsteinian parameters at higher\npost-Newtonian order. We also find that neglect of orbital eccentricity or\ntidal deformation effects do not cause a significant bias on the detectable\nregion of generic deviations from general relativity.\n", "  The evolution of galaxy cluster counts is a powerful probe of several\nfundamental cosmological parameters. A number of recent studies using this\nprobe have claimed tension with the cosmology preferred by the analysis of the\nPlanck primary CMB data, in the sense that there are fewer clusters observed\nthan predicted based on the primary CMB cosmology. One possible resolution to\nthis problem is systematic errors in the absolute halo mass calibration in\ncluster studies, which is required to convert the standard theoretical\nprediction (the halo mass function) into counts as a function of the observable\n(e.g., X-ray luminosity, Sunyaev-Zel'dovich flux, optical richness). Here we\npropose an alternative strategy, which is to directly compare predicted and\nobserved cluster counts as a function of the one-dimensional velocity\ndispersion of the cluster galaxies. We argue that the velocity dispersion of\ngroups/clusters can be theoretically predicted as robustly as mass but, unlike\nmass, it can also be directly observed, thus circumventing the main systematic\nbias in traditional cluster counts studies. With the aid of the BAHAMAS suite\nof cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, we demonstrate the potential of the\nvelocity dispersion counts for discriminating even similar $\\Lambda$CDM models.\nThese predictions can be compared with the results from existing redshift\nsurveys such as the highly-complete Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey, and\nupcoming wide-field spectroscopic surveys such as the Wide Area Vista\nExtragalactic Survey (WAVES) and the Dark Energy Survey Instrument (DESI).\n", "  The discovery of the Higgs boson marks a key ingredient to establish the\nelectroweak structure of the Standard Model. Its non-abelian gauge structure\ngives rise to, yet unobserved, non-perturbative baryon and lepton number\nviolating processes. We propose to use cosmic ray air showers, as measured at\nthe Pierre Auger Observatory, to set a limit on the hadronic production cross\nsection of sphalerons. We identify several observables to discriminate between\nsphaleron and QCD induced air showers.\n", "  Much of George Dracoulis's research career was devoted to utilizing gamma-ray\nspectroscopy in fundamental studies in nuclear physics. This same technology is\nuseful in a wide range of applications in the area of nuclear forensics. Over\nthe past several years, our research group has made use of both high- and low-\nresolution gamma ray spectrometers to: identify the first sample of plutonium\nlarge enough to be weighed; determine the yield of the Trinity nuclear\nexplosion; measure fission fragment yields as a function of target nucleus and\nneutron energy; and observe fallout in the U. S. from the Fukushima nuclear\nreactor accident.\n", "  QED with a large number $N$ of massless fermionic degrees of freedom has a\nconformal phase in a range of space-time dimensions. We use a large $N$\ndiagrammatic approach to calculate the leading corrections to $C_T$, the\ncoefficient of the two-point function of the stress-energy tensor, and $C_J$,\nthe coefficient of the two-point function of the global symmetry current. We\npresent explicit formulae as a function of $d$ and check them versus the\nexpectations in 2 and $4-\\epsilon$ dimensions. Using our results in higher even\ndimensions we find a concise formula for $C_T$ of the conformal Maxwell theory\nwith higher derivative action $F_{\\mu \\nu} (-\\nabla^2)^{\\frac{d}{2}-2} F^{\\mu\n\\nu}$. In $d=3$, QED has a topological symmetry current, and we calculate the\ncorrection to its two-point function coefficient, $C^{\\textrm{top}}_{J}$. We\nalso show that some RG flows involving QED in $d=3$ obey $C_T^{\\rm UV} >\nC_T^{\\rm IR}$ and discuss possible implications of this inequality for the\nsymmetry breaking at small values of $N$.\n", "  Planning the appropriate renewable energy installation rate should balance\ntwo partially contradictory objectives: substituting fossil fuels fast enough\nto stave-off the worst consequences of climate change while maintaining a\nsufficient net energy flow to support the world's economy. The upfront energy\ninvested in constructing a renewable energy infrastructure subtracts from the\nnet energy available for societal energy needs, a fact typically neglected in\nenergy projections. Modeling feasible energy transition pathways to provide\ndifferent net energy levels we find that they are critically dependent on the\nfossil fuel emissions cap and phase-out profile and on the characteristic\nenergy return on energy invested of the renewable energy technologies. The\neasiest pathway requires installation of renewable energy plants to accelerate\nfrom 0.12TWp/year in 2013 to peak between 6.6 and 10.4 TWp/year, for an early\nor a late fossil-fuel phase-out respectively in order for emissions to stay\nwithin the recommended CO2 budget.\n", "  As new facilities come online, the astronomical community will be provided\nwith extremely large datasets of well-sampled light curves (LCs) of transient\nobjects. This motivates systematic studies of the light curves of supernovae\n(SNe) of all types, including the early rising phase. We performed unsupervised\nk-means clustering on a sample of 59 R-band Type II SN light curves and find\nthat our sample can be divided into three classes: slowly-rising (II-S),\nfast-rise/slow-decline (II-FS), and fast-rise/fast-decline (II-FF). We also\nidentify three outliers based on the algorithm. We find that performing\nclustering on the first two components of a principal component analysis gives\nequivalent results to the analysis using the full LC morphologies. This may\nindicate that Type II LCs could possibly be reduced to two parameters. We\npresent several important caveats to the technique, and find that the division\ninto these classes is not fully robust and is sensitive to the uncertainty on\nthe time of first light. Moreover these classes have some overlap, and are\ndefined in the R-band only. It is currently unclear if they represent distinct\nphysical classes, and more data is needed to study these issues. However, our\nanalysis shows that the outliers are actually composed of slowly-evolving SN\nIIb, demonstrating the potential use of such methods. The slowly-evolving SNe\nIIb may arise from single massive progenitors.\n", "  We measured the magnetoresistvity (MR) properties of the 1T`-MoTe2 single\ncrystal under the magnetic field up to 33 T.By analyzing the Shubnikov de Haas\noscillations of MR at the low temperature, single Fermi surface is\nrevealed.From the strong oscillatory component of the longitudinal resistance\n{\\Delta}Rxx,a linear dependence of the Landau index n on 1/B is obtained.The\nintercept of the Landau index plot is between 3/8 and 1/2.This clearly reveals\na nontrivial {\\pi} Berry`s phase, which is a distinguished feature of Dirac\nfermions. Accompanied by the superconductivity observed at TC=0.1 K, 1T`-MoTe2\nmay be a promising candidate of the topological superconductor.\n", "  The incessant activity of swimming microorganisms has a direct physical\neffect on surrounding microscopic objects, leading to enhanced diffusion far\nbeyond the level of Brownian motion with possible influences on the spatial\ndistribution of non-motile planktonic species and particulate drifters. Here we\nstudy in detail the effect of eukaryotic flagellates, represented by the green\nmicroalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, on microparticles. Macro- and micro-scopic\nexperiments reveal that microorganism-colloid interactions are dominated by\nrare close encounters leading to large displacements through direct\nentrainment. Simulations and theoretical modelling show that the ensuing\nparticle dynamics can be understood in terms of a simple jump-diffusion\nprocess, combining standard diffusion with Poisson-distributed jumps. This\nheterogeneous dynamics is likely to depend on generic features of the\nnear-field of swimming microorganisms with front-mounted flagella.\n", "  MIMAC (MIcro-TPC MAtrix of Chambers) is a directional WIMP Dark Matter\ndetector project. Direct dark matter experiments need a high level of\nelectron/recoil discrimination to search for nuclear recoils produced by\nWIMP-nucleus elastic scattering. In this paper, we proposed an original method\nfor electron event rejection based on a multivariate analysis applied to\nexperimental data acquired using monochromatic neutron fields. This analysis\nshows that a $10^5$ rejection power is reachable for electron/recoil\ndiscrimination. Moreover, the efficiency was estimated by a Monte-Carlo\nsimulation showing that a 105 electron rejection power is reached with a\n$86.49\\pm 0.17$\\% nuclear recoil efficiency considering the full energy range\nand $94.67\\pm0.19$\\% considering a 5~keV lower threshold.\n", "  A new tuner control system of spoke superconducting radio frequency (SRF)\ncavity has been developed and applied to cryomodule I (CM1) of C-ADS injector I\nat IHEP. We have successfully implemented the tuner controllerfor the first\ntime and achieved a cavity tuning phase error of 0.7degrees (about 4 Hz peak to\npeak) in the presence of electromechanical coupled resonance. This paper will\npresent the preliminary experimental results based on the new tuner controller\nunder proton beam commissioning.\n", "  The Be/X-ray transients V0332+53 and 4U 0115+63 exhibited giant, type-II\noutbursts in 2015. Here we present Swift/XRT follow-up observations at the end\nof those outbursts. Surprisingly, the sources did not decay back to their known\nquiescent levels but stalled at a (slowly decaying) meta-stable state with\nluminosities ~10 times that observed in quiescence. The spectra in these states\nare considerably softer than the outburst spectra and appear to soften in time\nwhen the luminosity decreases. The physical mechanism behind these meta-stable\nstates is unclear and they could be due to low-level accretion (either directly\nonto the neutron stars or onto their magnetospheres) or due to cooling of the\naccretion-heated neutron star crusts. Based on the spectra, the slowly\ndecreasing luminosities, and the spectral softening, we favour the crust\ncooling hypothesis but we cannot exclude the accretion scenarios. On top of\nthis meta-stable state, weak accretion events were observed that occurred at\nperiastron passage and may thus be related to regular type-I outbursts.\n", "  We derive an Ising Hamiltonian for kinetic simulations involving interstitial\nand vacancy defects in binary alloys. Our model, which we term `ABVI',\nincorporates solute transport by both interstitial defects and vacancies into a\nmathematically-consistent framework , and thus represents a generalization to\nthe widely-used ABV model for alloy evolution simulations. The Hamiltonian\ncaptures the three possible interstitial configurations in a binary alloy: A-A,\nA-B, and B-B, which makes it particularly useful for irradiation damage\nsimulations. All the constants of the Hamiltonian are expressed in terms of\nbond energies that can be computed using first-principles calculations. We\nimplement our ABVI model in kinetic Monte Carlo simulations and perform a\nverification exercise by comparing our results to published irradiation damage\nsimulations in simple binary systems with Frenkel pair defect production and\nseveral microstructural scenarios, with matching agreement found.\n", "  Motivated by recent nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments, we present\na microscopic sp3 tight-binding model calculation of the NMR shifts in bulk\nBi2Se3, and Bi2Te3. We compute the contact, dipolar, orbital and core\npolarization contributions to the carrier-density-dependent part of the NMR\nshifts in Bi209, Te125 and Se77. The spin-orbit coupling and the layered\ncrystal structure result in a contact Knight shift with strong uniaxial\nanisotropy. Likewise, because of spin-orbit coupling, dipolar interactions make\na significant contribution to the isotropic part of the NMR shift. The contact\ninteraction dominates the isotropic Knight shift in Bi209 NMR, even though the\nelectronic states at the Fermi level have a rather weak s-orbital character. In\ncontrast, the contribution from the contact hyperfine interaction to the NMR\nshift of Se77 and Te125 is weak compared to the dipolar and orbital shifts\ntherein. In all cases, the orbital shift is at least comparable to the contact\nand dipolar shifts, while the shift due to core polarization is subdominant\n(except for Te nuclei located at the inversion centers). By artificially\nvarying the strength of spin-orbit coupling, we evaluate the evolution of the\nNMR shift across a band inversion but find no clear signature of the\ntopological transition.\n", "  The codes HFgradZ.py and HFgradT.py find axially symmetric minima of a\nHartree-Fock energy functional for a Hamiltonian supplied in a shell-model\nbasis. The functional to be minimized is the Hartree-Fock energy for\nzero-temperature properties or the Hartree-Fock grand potential for\nfinite-temperature properties. Various constraints may be imposed on the\nminima.\n", "  A symmetry preserving framework for the study of continuum Quantum\nChromodynamics (QCD) is obtained from a truncated solution of the QCD equations\nof motion or QCD's Dyson-Schwinger equations (DSEs). A nonperturbative solution\nof the DSEs enables the study of, e.g., hadrons as composites of dressed-quarks\nand dressed-gluons, the phenomena of confinement and dynamical chiral symmetry\nbreaking (DCSB), and therefrom an articulation of any connection between them.\nIt is within this context that we present a unified study of Nucleon, Delta and\nRoper elastic and transition electromagnetic form factors, and compare\npredictions made using a framework built upon a Faddeev equation kernel and\ninteraction vertices that possess QCD-like momentum dependence with results\nobtained using a symmetry-preserving treatment of a vector$\\,\\otimes\\,$vector\ncontact-interaction. The comparison emphasises that experiment is sensitive to\nthe momentum dependence of the running coupling and masses in QCD and\nhighlights that the key to describing hadron properties is a veracious\nexpression of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in the bound-state problem.\n", "  Deep sub micron HV-CMOS processes offer the opportunity for sensors built by\nindustry standard techniques while being HV tolerant, making them good\ncandidates for drift-based, fast collecting, thus radiation-hard pixel\ndetectors. For the upgrade of the ATLAS Pixel Detector towards the HL-LHC\nrequirements, active pixel sensors in HV-CMOS technology were investigated.\nThese implement amplifier and discriminator stages directly in insulating deep\nn-wells, which also act as collecting electrodes. The deep n-wells allow for\nbias voltages up to 150V leading to a depletion depth of several 10um.\nPrototype sensors in the ams H18 180nm and H35 350nm HV-CMOS processes have\nbeen manufactured, acting as a potential drop-in replacement for the current\nATLAS Pixel sensors, thus leaving higher level processing such as trigger\nhandling to dedicated read-out chips.\n  Sensors were thoroughly tested in lab measurements as well as in testbeam\nexperiments. Irradiation with X-rays and protons revealed a tolerance to\nionizing doses of 1Grad. An enlarged depletion zone of up to 100um thickness\nafter irradiation due to the acceptor removal effect was deduced from Edge-TCT\nstudies. The sensors showed high detection efficiencies after neutron\nirradiation to 1e15 n_eq cm-2 in testbeam experiments.\n  A full reticle size demonstrator chip, implemented in the H35 process is\nbeing submitted to prove the large scale feasibility of the HV-CMOS concept.\n", "  Applying the Fermi-Bose equivalence and the boundary state formulation, we\nstudy the hetero-junction of two quantum wires. Two quantum wires are described\nby Tomonaga-Luttinger (TL) liquids with different TL parameters and electrons\ntransport between two wires is depicted by a simple hopping interaction. We\ncalculate the radiative corrections to the hopping interaction and obtain the\nrenormalization (RG) exponent, making use of the perturbation theory based on\nthe boundary state formulation. The model exhibits a phase transition at zero\ntemperature. We discuss the critical line which defines the phase boundary on\nthe two dimensional parameter space. The model also exhibits the particle-kink\nduality, which maps the strong coupling regime of the model onto the weak\ncoupling regime of the dual model. The strong coupling regime of the model is\nfound to match exactly the weak coupling regime of the dual model. This model\nis also important to study the critical behaviors of the two dimensional\ndissipative system with anisotropic friction coefficients.\n", "  We report on the computational characteristics of ab initio nuclear structure\ncalculations in a symmetry-adapted no-core shell model (SA-NCSM) framework. We\nexamine the computational complexity of the current implementation of the\nSA-NCSM approach, dubbed LSU3shell, by analyzing ab initio results for 6Li and\n12C in large harmonic oscillator model spaces and SU(3)-selected subspaces. We\ndemonstrate LSU3shell's strong-scaling properties achieved with highly-parallel\nmethods for computing the many-body matrix elements. Results compare favorably\nwith complete model space calculations and significant memory savings are\nachieved in physically important applications. In particular, a well-chosen\nsymmetry-adapted basis affords memory savings in calculations of states with a\nfixed total angular momentum in large model spaces while exactly preserving\ntranslational invariance.\n", "  We axiomatize the defining properties of chiral WZW models. We show that such\nmodels are in almost bijective correspondence with pairs $(G,k)$, where $G$ is\na connected Lie group and $k \\in H^4_+(BG,\\mathbb Z)$ is a degree four\ncohomology class subject to a certain positivity condition. We find a couple\nextra models which satisfy all the defining properties of chiral WZW models,\nbut which don't come from pairs $(G,k)$ as above. The simplest such model is\nthe simple current extension of the affine VOA $E_8 \\times E_8$ at level\n$(2,2)$ by the group $\\mathbb Z_2$.\n", "  In Physics and in Mathematics $\\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-gradings, $n>1$, appear in\nvarious fields. The corresponding sign rule is determined by the `scalar\nproduct' of the involved $\\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-degrees. The\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-Supergeometry exhibits challenging differences with the\nclassical one: nonzero degree even coordinates are not nilpotent, and even\n(resp., odd) coordinates do not necessarily commute (resp., anticommute)\npairwise. In this article we develop the foundations of the theory: we define\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-supermanifolds and provide examples in the ringed space and\ncoordinate settings. We thus show that formal series are the appropriate\nsubstitute for nilpotency. Moreover, the class of\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2^\\bullet$-supermanifolds is closed with respect to the tangent and\ncotangent functors. We explain that any $n$-fold vector bundle has a canonical\n`superization' to a $\\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-supermanifold and prove that the\nfundamental theorem describing supermorphisms in terms of coordinates can be\nextended to the $\\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-context.\n", "  Recent experimental studies of the multiplicity dependence of heavy quark\n(HQ) production in proton-proton collisions at 7 TeV showed a strong non-linear\nincrease of the HQ multiplicity as a function of the charged particle\nmultiplicity. We try to understand this behavior using the EPOS3 approach. Two\nissues play an important role: multiple scattering, in particular its impact on\nmultiplicity fluctuations, and the collective hydrodynamic expansion. The\nresults are very robust with respect to many details of the modeling, which\nmeans that these data contain valuable information about very basic features of\nthe reaction mechanism in proton-proton collisions.\n", "  In this talk it is reported on an analysis of hard exclusive leptoproduction\nof pions within the handbag approach. It is argued that recent measurements of\nthis process performed by HERMES and CLAS clearly indicate the occurrence of\nstrong contributions from transversely polarized photons. Within the handbag\napproach such gamma*_T -> pi transitions are described by the transversity GPDs\naccompanied by twist-3 pion wave functions. It is shown that the handbag\napproach leads to results on cross sections and single-spin asymmetries in fair\nagreement with experiment. Predictions for other pseudoscalar meson channels\nare also briefly discussed.8 pages\n", "  We study scattering theory for a quantum-mechanical system consisting of a\nparticle scattered off a dynamical target that occupies a compact region in\nposition space. After taking a trace over the degrees of freedom of the target,\nthe dynamics of the particle is generated by a Lindbladian acting on the space\nof trace-class operators. We study scattering theory for a general class of\nLindbladians with bounded interaction terms. First, we consider models where a\nparticle approaching the target is always re-emitted by the target. Then we\nstudy models where the particle may be captured by the target. An important\ningredient of our analysis is a scattering theory for dissipative operators on\nHilbert space.\n", "  We searched for an optical counterpart to the first gravitational wave source\ndiscovered by LIGO (GW150914), using a combination of the Pan-STARRS1\nwide-field telescope and the PESSTO spectroscopic follow-up programme. As the\nfinal LIGO sky maps changed during analysis, the total probability of the\nsource being spatially coincident with our fields was finally only 4.2 per\ncent. Therefore we discuss our results primarily as a demonstration of the\nsurvey capability of Pan-STARRS and spectroscopic capability of PESSTO. We\nmapped out 442 square degrees of the northern sky region of the initial map. We\ndiscovered 56 astrophysical transients over a period of 41 days from the\ndiscovery of the source. Of these, 19 were spectroscopically classified and a\nfurther 13 have host galaxy redshifts. All transients appear to be fairly\nnormal supernovae and AGN variability and none is obviously linked with\nGW150914. We illustrate the sensitivity of our survey by defining parameterised\nlightcurves with timescales of 4, 20 and 40 days and use the sensitivity of the\nPan-STARRS1 images to set limits on the luminosities of possible sources. The\nPan-STARRS1 images reach limiting magnitudes of i = 19.2, 20.0 and 20.8\nrespectively for the three timescales. For long timescale parameterised\nlightcurves (with FWHM=~40d) we set upper limits of M_i <= -17.2 -0.9/+1.4 if\nthe distance to GW150914 is D = 400 +/- 200Mpc. The number of type Ia SN we\nfind in the survey is similar to that expected from the cosmic SN rate,\nindicating a reasonably complete efficiency in recovering supernova like\ntransients out to D = 400 +/- 200 Mpc.\n", "  We have studied experimentally and theoretically the optical orientation and\nspin-dependent Shockley-Read-Hall recombination in a semiconductor in a\nmagnetic field at an arbitrary angle between the field and circularly polarized\nexciting beam. The experiments are performed at room temperature in GaAsN\nalloys where deep paramagnetic centers are responsible for the spin-dependent\nrecombination. The observed magnetic-field dependences of the circular\npolarization r(B) and intensity J(B) of photoluminescence can be approximately\ndescribed as a superposition of two Lorentzian contours, normal and inverted,\nwith their half-widths differing by an order of magnitude. The normal (narrow)\nLorentzian contour is associated with depolarization of the transverse (to the\nfield) component of spin polarization of the localized electrons, whereas the\ninverted (broad) Lorentzian is due to suppression of the hyperfine interaction\nof the localized electron with the defect nucleus. The ratio between the height\nof one Lorentzian and depth of the other is governed by the field tilt angle.\nIn contrast to the hyperfine interaction of a shallow-donor-bound electron with\na large number of nuclei of the crystal lattice, in the optical orientation of\nthe electron-nuclear system under study no additional narrow peak appears in\nthe oblique field. This result demonstrates that in the GaAsN alloys the\nhyperfine interaction of the localized electron with the single nucleus of the\nparamagnetic center remains strong even at room temperature. For a theoretical\ndescription of the experiment, we have extended the theory of spin-dependent\nrecombination via deep paramagnetic centers with the nuclear angular momentum I\n= 1/2 developed previously for the particular case of the longitudinal field.\nThe calculated curves r(B), J(B) agree with the approximate description of the\nexperimental dependences as a sum of two Lorentzians.\n", "  A quantum scattering theory is developed for Fock states scattered by\ntwo-level systems in the free space. Compared to existing scattering theories\nthat treat incident light semi-classically, the theory fully quantizes the\nincident light as Fock states. This non-perturbative method provides exact\nscattering matrix.\n", "  How do protons and neutrons bind to form nuclei? This is the central question\nof ab initio nuclear structure theory. While the answer may seem as simple as\nthe fact that nuclear forces are attractive, the full story is more complex and\ninteresting. In this work we present numerical evidence from ab initio lattice\nsimulations showing that nature is near a quantum phase transition, a\nzero-temperature transition driven by quantum fluctuations. Using lattice\neffective field theory, we perform Monte Carlo simulations for systems with up\nto twenty nucleons. For even and equal numbers of protons and neutrons, we\ndiscover a first-order transition at zero temperature from a Bose-condensed gas\nof alpha particles (4He nuclei) to a nuclear liquid. Whether one has an\nalpha-particle gas or nuclear liquid is determined by the strength of the\nalpha-alpha interactions, and we show that the alpha-alpha interactions depend\non the strength and locality of the nucleon-nucleon interactions. This insight\nshould be useful in improving calculations of nuclear structure and important\nastrophysical reactions involving alpha capture on nuclei. Our findings also\nprovide a tool to probe the structure of alpha cluster states such as the Hoyle\nstate responsible for the production of carbon in red giant stars and point to\na connection between nuclear states and the universal physics of bosons at\nlarge scattering length.\n", "  In this letter, we investigate the traversable wormholes in the holographic\ndark energy (HDE) model constrained by the modern astronomical observations.\nFirst of all, we constrain the HDE model by adopting different data-sets,\nexplore the cosmological background evolution of the HDE model, and find that\nthe HDE model will be fitting better than the Ricci dark energy (RDE) model for\nthe same SNe Ia data-sets by using the the so-called Akaike Information\nCriterions (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterions (BIC) . Furthermore, we\ndiscover that if taking the SNe Ia data-sets, the wormholes will appear (open)\nwhen the redshift $z<0.027$. Subsequently, several specific traversable\nwormhole solutions are obtained, including the constant redshift function,\ntraceless stress energy tensor, a special choice for the shape function as well\nas the case of isotropic pressure. Except for the first case, it is very\nnecessary to theoretically construct the traversable wormholes by matching the\nexterior geometries to the interior geometries. Naturally, one can easily find\nthat the dimensions of the wormholes for the left cases are substantially\nfinite.\n", "  We reinvestigate gravitational ellipsoidal collapse with special focus on its\nimpact on primordial black-hole formation. For a generic model we demonstrate\nthat the abundance and energy density of the produced primordial black holes\nwill be significantly decreased when the non-sphericity of the overdensities is\ntaken into account.\n", "  We used a one-zone chemical evolution model to address the question of how\nmany masses and metallicities are required in grids of massive stellar models\nin order to ensure reliable galactic chemical evolution predictions. We used a\nset of yields that includes seven masses between 13 and 30 Msun, 15\nmetallicities between 0 and 0.03 in mass fraction, and two different remnant\nmass prescriptions. We ran several simulations where we sampled subsets of\nstellar models to explore the impact of different grid resolutions. Stellar\nyields from low- and intermediate-mass stars and from Type Ia supernovae have\nbeen included in our simulations, but with a fixed grid resolution. We compared\nour results with the stellar abundances observed in the Milky Way for O, Na,\nMg, Si, Ca, Ti, and Mn. Our results suggest that the range of metallicity\nconsidered is more important than the number of metallicities within that\nrange, which only affects our numerical predictions by about 0.1 dex. We found\nthat our predictions at [Fe/H] < -2 are very sensitive to the metallicity range\nand the mass sampling used for the lowest metallicity included in the set of\nyields. Variations between results can be as high as 0.8 dex, for any remnant\nmass prescription. At higher [Fe/H], we found that the required number of\nmasses depends on the element of interest and on the remnant mass prescription.\nWith a monotonic remnant mass prescription where every model explodes as a\ncore-collapse supernova, the mass resolution induces variations of 0.2 dex on\naverage. But with a remnant mass prescription that includes islands of\nnon-explodability, the mass resolution can cause variations of about 0.2 to 0.7\ndex depending on the choice of metallicity range. With such a prescription,\nexplosive or non-explosive models can be missed if not enough masses are\nselected, resulting in over- or under-estimations of the mass ejected by\nmassive stars.\n", "  We explore holographic entanglement entropy in ten-dimensional supergravity\nsolutions. It has been proposed that entanglement entropy can be computed in\nsuch top-down models using minimal surfaces which asymptotically wrap the\ncompact part of the geometry. We show explicitly in a wide range of examples\nthat the holographic entanglement entropy thus computed agrees with the\nentanglement entropy computed using the Ryu-Takayanagi formula from the\nlower-dimensional Einstein metric obtained from reduction over the compact\nspace. Our examples include not only consistent truncations but also cases in\nwhich no consistent truncation exists and Kaluza-Klein holography is used to\nidentify the lower-dimensional Einstein metric. We then give a general proof,\nbased on the Lewkowycz-Maldacena approach, of the top-down entanglement entropy\nformula.\n", "  Thermal effects on the perpendicular convection of seeded pressure blobs in\nthe scrape-off layer of magnetised fusion plasmas are investigated. Our\nnumerical study is based on a four field full-F gyrofluid model, which entails\nthe consistent description of high fluctuation amplitudes and dynamic finite\nLarmor radius effects. We find that the maximal radial blob velocity increases\nwith the square root of the initial pressure perturbation and that a finite\nLarmor radius contributes to highly compact blob structures that propagate in\nthe poloidal direction. An extensive parameter study reveals that a smooth\ntransition to this compact blob regime occurs when the finite Larmor radius\neffect strength, defined by the ratio of the magnetic field aligned component\nof the ion diamagnetic to the $\\vec{E}\\times\\vec{B}$ vorticity, exceeds unity.\nThe maximal radial blob velocities agree excellently with the inertial velocity\nscaling law over more than an order of magnitude. We show that the finite\nLarmor radius effect strength affects the poloidal and total particle transport\nand present an empirical scaling law for the poloidal and total blob\nvelocities. Distinctions to the blob behaviour in the isothermal limit with\nconstant finite Larmor radius effects are highlighted.\n", "  Inspired by the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP), which adds\ngravitational effects to the standard description of quantum uncertainty, we\nextend the exact uncertainty principle (EUP) approach by Hall and Reginatto [J.\nPhys. A: Math. Gen. (2002) 35 3289], and obtain a (quasi)nonlinear\nSchr\\\"odinger equation. This quantum evolution equation of unusual form, enjoys\nseveral desired properties like separation of non-interacting subsystems or\nplanewave solutions for free particles. Starting with the harmonic oscillator\nexample, we show that every solution of this equation respects the\ngravitationally-induced minimal position uncertainty proportional to the Planck\nlength. Quite surprisingly, our result successfully merges the core of\nclassical physics with non-relativistic quantum mechanics in its extremal form.\nWe predict that the commonly accepted phenomenon, namely a modification of a\nfree-particle dispersion relation due to quantum gravity might not occur in\nreality.\n", "  We give a \"holographic\" explanation of Poisson-Lie T-duality in terms of\nChern-Simons theory (or, more generally, in terms of Courant sigma-models) with\nappropriate boundary conditions.\n", "  The Kerr metric models the final classical black hole state after\ngravitational collapse of matter and radiation. Any stationary metric which is\nclose to the Kerr metric has been proven to be diffeomorphic to it. Now, finite\nsupertranslation diffeomorphisms are symmetries which map solutions to\ninequivalent solutions as such diffeomorphisms generate conserved superrotation\ncharges. The final state of gravitational collapse is therefore parameterized\nby its mass, angular momentum and supertranslation field, signaled by its\nconserved superrotation charges.\n  In this paper, we first derive the angle-dependent energy conservation law\nrelating the asymptotic value of the supertranslation field of the final state\nto the details of the collapse and subsequent evolution of the system. We then\ngenerate the static solution with an asymptotic supertranslation field and we\nstudy some of its properties. Up to a caveat, the deviation from the\nSchwarzschild metric could therefore be predicted on a case-by-case basis from\naccurate modeling of the angular dependence of the ingoing and outgoing energy\nfluxes leading to the final state.\n", "  We consider the planar local patch approximation of $d=2$ fermions at finite\ndensity coupled to a critical boson. In the quenched or Bloch-Nordsieck\napproximation, where one takes the limit of fermion flavors $N_f\\rightarrow 0$,\nthe fermion spectral function can be determined {exactly}. We show that one can\nobtain this non-perturbative answer thanks to a specific identity of fermionic\ntwo-point functions in the planar local patch approximation. The resulting\nspectrum is that of a non-Fermi liquid: quasiparticles are not part of the\nexact fermionic excitation spectrum of the theory. Instead one finds continuous\nspectral weight with power law scaling excitations as in a $d=1$ dimensional\ncritical state. Moreover, at low energies there are three such excitations at\nthree different Fermi surfaces, two with a low energy Green's function $G \\sim\n(\\omega-v_*k)^{-1/2}$ and one with $G \\sim |\\omega+k|^{-1/3}$.\n", "  In this work we study the correlation energy of the quantized electron gas of\nuniform density at temperature $T=0$. To do so we utilize methods from\nclassical statistical mechanics. The basis for this is the Feynman path\nintegral for the partition function of quantized systems. With this\nrepresentation the quantum mechanical problem can be interpreted as, and is\nequivalent to, a classical polymer problem in four dimensions where the fourth\ndimension is imaginary time. Thus methods, results, and properties obtained in\nthe statistical mechanics of classical fluids can be utilized. From this\nviewpoint we recover the well known RPA (random phase approximation). Then to\nimprove it we in this work modify the RPA by requiring the corresponding\ncorrelation function to be such that electrons with equal spins can not be on\nthe same position. Numerical evaluations are compared with well known results\nof a standard parameterization of Monte Carlo correlation energies.\n", "  We discuss the potential of the experimental programme at NICA to investigate\nthe QCD phase diagram and particularly the position of the critical line at\nlarge baryon-chemical potential with accurate measurements of particle\nmultiplicities. We briefly review the present status and we outline the tasks\nto be accomplished both theoretically and the experimentally to make hadronic\nabundances a sensitive probe.\n", "  The quality of PMT signal is one of the key items for a large and high\nprecision neutrino experiment, like Daya Bay, JUNO, while most of the\nexperiments are affected by the PMT signal overshoot from its positive\nHV-single cable scheme. For JUNO prototype detector, we have a detailed study\non the PMT overshoot and successfully reduced the ratio of overshoot amplitude\nto signal to ~1% from previous typical ~10%, with no affection to PMT other\nparameters. Furthermore, we calculated that the overshoot is a result of\ndischarging of capacitors in the HV-signal splitter and the PMT voltage\ndivider. The study result is extremely important for JUNO and other similar\nexperiments.\n", "  We study bounds from perturbative unitarity in a Composite 2-Higgs Doublet\nModel (C2HDM) based on the spontaneous breakdown of a global symmetry $SO(6)\\to\nSO(4)\\times SO(2)$ at the compositeness scale $f$. The eight pseudo\nNambu-Goldstone Bosons (pNGBs) emerging from such a dynamics are identified as\ntwo isospin doublet Higgs fields. We calculate the $S$-wave amplitude for all\npossible 2-to-2-body elastic (pseudo)scalar boson scatterings at energy scales\n$\\sqrt{s}$ reachable at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and beyond it,\nincluding the longitudinal components of weak gauge boson states as the\ncorresponding pNGB states. In our calculation, the Higgs potential is assumed\nto have the same form as that in the Elementary 2-Higgs Doublet Model (E2HDM)\nwith a discrete $Z_2$ symmetry, which is expected to be generated at the\none-loop level via the Coleman-Weinberg (CW) mechanism. We find that the\n$S$-wave amplitude matrix can be block-diagonalized with maximally $2\\times 2$\nsubmatrices in a way similar to the E2HDM case as long as we only keep the\ncontributions from ${\\cal O }(\\xi s)$ and ${\\cal O }(\\xi^0 s^0)$ in the\namplitudes, where $\\xi=v_{\\text{SM}}^2/f^2$ and $v_{\\text{SM}}^{}\\simeq 246$\nGeV, which is an appropriate approximation for our analysis. By requiring the\nC2HDM to satisfy perturbative unitarity at energies reachable by the LHC, we\nderive bounds on its parameters such as $\\xi$ and the masses of extra Higgs\nbosons present in the scenario alongside the Standard Model (SM)-like Higgs\nstate discovered in 2012.\n", "  We study the turbulent transport of an ion cyclotron resonance heated (ICRH),\nMeV range minority ion species in tokamak plasmas. Such highly energetic\nminorities, which can be produced in the three ion minority heating scheme [Ye.\nO. Kazakov et al. (2015) Nucl. Fusion 55, 032001], have been proposed to be\nused to experimentally study the confinement properties of fast ions without\nthe generation of fusion alphas. We compare the turbulent transport properties\nof ICRH ions with that of fusion born alpha particles. Our theoretical\npredictions indicate that care must be taken when conclusions are drawn from\nexperimental results: While the effect of turbulence on these particles is\nsimilar in terms of transport coefficients, differences in their distribution\nfunctions - ultimately their generation processes - make the resulting\nturbulent fluxes different.\n", "  The DArk Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) is a space experiment designed to\nsearch for dark matter indirectly by measuring the spectra of photons,\nelectrons, and positrons up to 10 TeV. The BGO electromagnetic calorimeter\n(ECAL) is its main sub-detector for energy measurement. In this paper, the\ninstrumentation and development of the BGO ECAL is briefly described. The\ncalibration on the ground, including the pedestal, minimum ionizing particle\n(MIP) peak, dynode ratio, and attenuation length with the cosmic rays and beam\nparticles is discussed in detail. Also, the energy reconstruction results of\nthe electrons from the beam test are presented.\n", "  Cascading stages of seeded free electron laser (FEL) is a promising way to\nproduce fully coherent X-ray radiations. We study a new approach to produce\ncoherent hard X-rays by cascading the recently proposed phase-merging enhanced\nharmonic generation (PEHG). The scheme consists of one dogleg and two PEHG\nconfigurations, which may be one of the leading candidates for the extracted\nundulator branch in future X-ray FEL facilities. FEL physics studies show that\nsuch a scheme is feasible within the present technology and can provide high\nbrightness X-ray radiation pulses with narrow bandwidth and fully coherence,\nand the radiated peak power at 1 angstrom wavelength converted from an initial\n200 nm seed laser is over 2 GW.\n", "  The aim of this model study of the electron-phonon coupling in graphene was\nto find out about the relative importance of the inter- and intraband\nscattering and which phonon modes are the most active. This was achieved by\nanalyzing the electron-phonon matrix element of the carbon dimer in the unit\ncell. We found that for the intra molecular orbital matrix elements the\nlongitudinal optical phonon mode is the active phonon mode. The matrix element\ncorresponding to sigma to sigma is greater than the matrix element for pi to pi\n. The inter molecular orbital scattering pi to sigma is driven by the\nout-of-plane acoustic phonon mode, while the out-of-plane optical mode does not\ncontribute for symmetry reasons. We found the unexpected result that the\nmagnitude of matrix element of the inter molecular orbital scattering pi to\nsigmat exceeds the intra molecular orbital scattering pi to pi . These results\nindicate that the in general not considered inter-band scattering has to be\ntaken into account when analyzing e.g. photo-hole lifetimes and the\nelectron-phonon coupling constant ?from photoemission data of graphene.\n", "  We demonstrate that the dynamics of kicked spin chains possess a remarkable\nduality property. The trace of the unitary evolution operator for $N$ spins at\ntime $T$ is related to one of a non-unitary evolution operator for $T$ spins at\ntime $N$. We investigate the spectrum of this dual operator with a focus on the\ndifferent parameter regimes (chaotic, regular) of the spin chain. We present\napplications of this duality relation to spectral statistics in an accompanying\npaper.\n", "  Using an experimental setup designed to scan a submicron sized light spot and\ncollect the photogenerated current through larger electrodes, we map the\nphotovoltaic response in ferroelectric BiFeO3 single crystals. We study the\neffect produced by a unique 180{\\textdegree} ferroelectric domain wall (DW) and\nshow that the photocurrent maps are significantly affected by its presence and\nshape. The effect is large in its vicinity and in the Schottky barriers at the\ninterface with the Au electrodes, but no extra photocurrent is observed when\nthe illuminating spot touches the DW, indicating that this particular entity is\nnot the heart of specific photo-electric properties. Using 3D modelling, we\nargue that the measured effect is due to the spatial distribution of internal\nfields which are significantly affected by the charge of the DW due to its\ndistortion.\n", "  Heavy-ion collisions performed in the beam energy range accessible by the\nNICA collider facility are expected to produce systems of extreme net-baryon\ndensities and can thus reach yet unexplored regions of the QCD phase diagram.\nHere, one expects the phase transition between the plasma of deconfined quarks\nand gluons and the hadronic matter to be of first order. A discovery of the\nfirst-order phase transition would as well prove the existence of the QCD\ncritical point, a landmark in the phase diagram. In order to understand\npossible signals of the first-order phase transition in heavy-ion collision\nexperiments it is very important to develop dynamical models of the phase\ntransition. Here, we discuss the opportunities of studying dynamical effects at\nthe QCD first-order phase transition within our model of nonequilibrium chiral\nfluid dynamics.\n", "  The problem of the motion of a particle in an asymmetric double well is\nsolved explicitly in terms of the Weierstrass and Jacobi elliptic functions.\nWhile the solution of the orbital motion is expressed simply in terms of the\nWeierstrass elliptic function, the period of oscillation is more directly\nexpressed in terms of periods of the Jacobi elliptic functions.\n", "  The firewall paradox for black holes is often viewed as indicating a conflict\nbetween unitarity and the equivalence principle. We elucidate how the paradox\nmanifests as a limitation of semiclassical theory, rather than presents a\nconflict between fundamental principles. Two principal features of the\nfundamental and semiclassical theories address two versions of the paradox: the\nentanglement and typicality arguments. First, the physical Hilbert space\ndescribing excitations on a fixed black hole background in the semiclassical\ntheory is exponentially smaller than the number of physical states in the\nfundamental theory of quantum gravity. Second, in addition to the Hilbert space\nfor physical excitations, the semiclassical theory possesses an unphysically\nlarge Fock space built by creation and annihilation operators on the fixed\nblack hole background. Understanding these features not only eliminates the\nnecessity of firewalls but also leads to a new picture of Hawking emission\ncontrasting pair creation at the horizon.\n", "  A temperature dependent coherent magnetization reversal model is proposed for\nsize-distributed assemblies of ferromagnetic nanoparticles and\nferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic core-shell nanoparticles. The nanoparticles are\nassumed to be of uniaxial anisotropy and all aligned along their easy axis. The\nthermal dependence is included by considering thermal fluctuations, implemented\nvia the N\\'eel-Arrhenius theory. Thermal and angular dependence of\nmagnetization reversal loops, coercive field and exchange-bias field are\nobtained, showing that F-AF size-distributed exchange-coupled nanoparticles\nexhibit temperature-dependent asymmetric magnetization reversal. Also,\nnon-monotonic evolutions of He and Hc with T are demonstrated. The angular\ndependence of Hc with T exhibits a complex behavior, with the presence of an\napex, whose position and amplitude are strongly T dependent. The angular\ndependence of He with T exhibits complex behaviors, which depends on the AF\nanisotropy and exchange coupling. The resulting angular behavior demonstrates\nthe key role of the size distribution and temperature in the magnetic response\nof nanoparticles.\n", "  An interferometer system and an imaging system using visible synchrotron\nradiation (SR) have been installed in HLS II storage ring. Simulations of these\ntwo systems are given using Synchrotron Radiation Workshop(SRW) code. With\nthese two systems, the beam energy spread and the beam emittance can be\nmeasured. A detailed description of these two systems and the measurement\nmethod is given in this paper. The measurement results of beam size, emittance\nand energy spread are given at the end.\n", "  Geometry of hypersurfaces defined by the relation which generalizes classical\nformula for free energy in terms of microstates is studied. Induced metric,\nRiemann curvature tensor, Gauss-Kronecker curvature and associated entropy are\ncalculated. Special class of ideal statistical hypersurfaces is analyzed in\ndetails. Non-ideal hypersurfaces and their singularities similar to those of\nthe phase transitions are considered. Tropical limit of statistical\nhypersurfaces and double scaling tropical limit are discussed too.\n", "  The open-shell reference relativistic equation-of-motion coupled-cluster\nmethod within its four-component description is successfully implemented with\nthe consideration of single- and double- excitation approximation. The one-body\nand two-body matrix elements required for the correlation calculation are\ngenerated using Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian. As a first attempt, the implemented\nmethod is employed to calculate a few of the low-lying ionized states of heavy\natomic (Ag, Cs, Au, Fr, Lr) and valence ionization potential of molecular (HgH,\nPbF) systems, where the effect of relativity does really matter to obtain\nhighly accurate results. Not only the relativistic effect, but also the effect\nof electron correlation is crucial in these heavy atomic and molecular systems.\nTo justify the fact, we have taken two further approximations in the\nfour-component relativistic equation-of-motion framework to quantify how the\neffect of electron correlation plays a role in the calculated values at\ndifferent level of the approximation. All these calculated results are compared\nwith the available experimental data as well as with other theoretically\ncalculated values to judge the extent of accuracy obtained in our calculations.\nA nice agreement is achieved for all the considered systems which validates the\nperformance of the open-shell reference relativistic equation-of-motion\ncoupled-cluster method.\n", "  Semimetallic tungsten ditelluride (WTe2) displays an extremely large\nnon-saturating magnetoresistance (XMR), which is the subject of intense\ninterest. This phenomenon is thought to arise from the combination of perfect\nn-p charge compensation with low carrier densities in WTe2 and presumably\ndetails of its band structure. Recently, \"spin texture\" induced by strong\nspin-orbital coupling (SOC) has been observed in WTe2 by angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). This provides a mechanism for protecting\nbackscattering for the states involved and thus was proposed to play an\nimportant role in the XMR of WTe2. Here, based on our density functional\ncalculations for bulk WTe2, we found a strong Rashba spin-orbit effect in the\ncalculated band structure due to its non-centrosymmetric structure. This splits\nbands and two-fold spin degeneracy of bands is lifted. A prominent Umklapp\ninterference pattern (a spectroscopic feature with involving reciprocal lattice\nvectors) can be observed by scanning tunneling microscopic (STM) measurements\non WTe2 surface at 4.2 K. This differs distinctly from the surface atomic\nstructure demonstrated at 77 K. The energy dependence of Umklapp interference\nshows a strong correspondence with densities of states integrated from ARPES\nmeasurement, manifesting a fact that the bands are spin-split on the opposites\nside of Gamma point. Spectroscopic survey reveals the ratio of electron/hole\nasymmetry changes alternately with lateral locations along b axis, providing a\nmicroscopic picture for double-carrier transport of semimetallic WTe2. The\ncalculated band structure and Fermi surface is further supported by our ARPES\nresults and Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations measurements.\n", "  Recently reported diboson and diphoton excesses at LHC are interpreted to be\nconnected with heavy $WW$ zero spin resonances. The resonances appears due to\nthe wouldbe anomalous triple interaction of the weak bosons, which is defined\nby well-known coupling constant $\\lambda$. The $2\\, TeV$ anomaly tentatively\ncorresponds to weak isotopic spin 2 scalar state and the $\\gamma\\gamma\\,\\,750\\,\nGeV$ anomaly corresponds to weak isotopic spin 0 pseudoscalar state. We obtain\nestimates for the effect, which qualitatively agree with ATLAS data. Effects\nare predicted in a production of $W^+ W^-, (Z,\\gamma) (Z,\\gamma)$ via resonance\n$X_{PS}$ with $M_{PS} \\simeq 750\\,GeV$, which could be reliably checked at the\nupgraded LHC at $\\sqrt{s}\\,=\\,13\\, TeV$. In the framework of an approach to the\nspontaneous generation of the triple anomalous interaction its coupling\nconstant is estimated to be $\\lambda = -\\,0.02\\pm 0.005$ in an agreement with\nexisting restrictions. Specific predictions of the hypothesis are significant\neffects in decay channels $X_{PS} \\to \\gamma\\,l^+\\,l^-\\,, X_{PS} \\to\nl^+\\,l^-\\,\\,l^+\\,l^-\\,(l = e,\\,\\mu)$.\n", "  Cells measure concentrations of external ligands by capturing ligand\nmolecules with cell surface receptors. The numbers of molecules captured by\ndifferent receptors co-vary because they depend on the same extrinsic ligand\nfluctuations. However, these numbers also counter-vary due to the intrinsic\nstochasticity of chemical processes because a single molecule randomly captured\nby a receptor cannot be captured by another. Such structure of receptor\ncorrelations is generally believed to lead to an increase in information about\nthe external signal compared to the case of independent receptors. We analyze a\nsolvable model of two molecular receptors and show that, contrary to this\nwidespread expectation, the correlations have a small and negative effect on\nthe information about the ligand concentration. Further, we show that\nmeasurements that average over multiple receptors are almost as informative as\nthose that track the states of every individual one.\n", "  The steady incompressible viscous flow in the wide gap between spheres\nrotating about a common axis at slightly different rates (small Ekman number E)\nhas a long and celebrated history. The problem is relevant to the dynamics of\ngeophysical and planetary core flows, for which, in the case of electrically\nconducting fluids, the possible operation of a dynamo is of considerable\ninterest. A comprehensive asymptotic study, in the limit E<<1, was undertaken\nby Stewartson (J. Fluid Mech. 1966, vol. 26, pp. 131-144). The mainstream flow,\nexterior to the E^{1/2} Ekman layers on the inner/outer boundaries and the\nshear layer on the inner sphere tangent cylinder C, is geostrophic. Stewartson\nidentified a complicated nested layer structure on C, which comprises\nrelatively thick quasi-geostrophic E^{2/7} (inside C) and E^{1/4} (outside C)\nlayers. They embed a thinner E^{1/3} ageostrophic shear layer (on C), which\nmerges with the inner sphere Ekman layer to form the E^{2/5} Equatorial Ekman\nlayer of axial length E^{1/5}. Under appropriate scaling, this $E^{2/5}$--layer\nproblem may be formulated, correct to leading order, independent of E.\nAccordingly, the Ekman boundary layer and ageostrophic shear layer become\nfeatures of the far-field (as identified by the large value of the scaled axial\nco-ordinate z) solution. We present a numerical solution, which uses a\nnon-local integral boundary condition at finite $z$ to account for the\nfar-field behaviour. Adopting z^{-1} as a small parameter we extend\nStewartson's similarity solution for the ageostrophic shear layer to higher\norders. This far-field solution agrees well with that obtained from our\nnumerical model.\n", "  A theoretical model is presented to reveal the mechanism of B doping into\ngraphene in the microwave plasma experiment choosing trimethylboron as the\ndoping source (ACS NANO 6 (2012) 1970). The results show that the reason for B\ndoping comes from the combinational interaction of B and other groups (C, H,\nCH, CH2 or CH3) decomposing from trimethylboron and the doping undergoes two\ncrucial steps. The minimal energy path for the first step are determined. The\nobtained energy barrier of considered cases fall into the range of 0.02-0.43\neV, supporting the fact that the substituting B for C can easily realized even\nat room temperature. As the second step, after removing irrelevant groups in\nvertical direction through H saturation, the perfect B doping is realized at\nlast. This work successfully explain the above experimental phenomenon and\npropose a novel and feasible method aiming at B doping of graphene.\n", "  In this article, we take the $X(5568)$ as the diquark-antidiquark type\ntetraquark state with the spin-parity $J^P=0^+$, construct the\nscalar-diquark-scalar-antidiquark type current, carry out the operator product\nexpansion up to the vacuum condensates of dimension-10, and study the mass and\npole residue in details with the QCD sum rules. We obtain the value\n$M_X=\\left(5.57\\pm0.12 \\right) \\,\\rm{GeV}$, which is consistent with the\nexperimental data. The present prediction favors assigning the $X(5568)$ to be\nthe scalar tetraquark state.\n", "  We evaluate the cosmogenic production rates in some materials that are\ncommonly used as targets and shielding/supporting components for detecting rare\nevents. The results from Geant4 simulations are compared with the calculations\nof ACTIVIA and the available experimental data. We demonstrate that the\nproduction rates from the Geant4-based simulations agree with the available\ndata reasonably well. As a result, we report that the cosmogenic production of\nseveral isotopes in various materials can generate potential backgrounds for\ndirect detection of dark matter and neutrinoless double-beta decay.\n", "  If the technology for muon storage rings one day permits sensitivity to\nprecession at the order of $10^{-8}$ Hz, the local gravitational field of Earth\ncan be a dominant contribution to the precession of the muon, which, if\nignored, can fake the signal for a nonzero muon electric dipole moment (EDM).\nSpecifically, the effects of Earth's gravity on the motion of a muon's spin is\nindistinguishable from it having a nonzero EDM of magnitude $d_\\mu \\sim\n10^{-29}$ e cm in a storage ring with vertical magnetic field of $\\sim$ 1 T,\nwhich is significantly larger than the expected upper limit in the Standard\nModel, $d_\\mu \\lesssim 10^{-36}$ e cm. As a corollary, measurements of Earth's\nlocal gravitational field using stored muons would be a unique test to\ndistinguish classical gravity from general relativity with a bonafide quantum\nmechanical entity, i.e., an elementary particle's spin.\n", "  In this paper conceptual points regarding electrons elastic (Kapitza-Dirac\neffect) and inelastic diffraction effect on the different type slowed\nelectromagnetic wave structures/light gratings are considered. From the unified\npoint of view it is analyzed the main works on this subject for last four\ndecades in chronological order, pointing out the essential peculiarity inherent\nin induced Cherenkov, Compton, and undulator/wiggler processes too. This review\narticle has also a goal to resolve confusion in scientific literature connected\nwith the recently appeared paper [6] relating the electrons diffraction on a\ntraveling wave in a dielectric medium.\n", "  We study the merger of binary neutron stars with different mass ratios\nadopting three different realistic, microphysical nuclear equations of state,\nas well as incorporating neutrino cooling effects. In particular, we\nconcentrate on the influence of the equation of state on the gravitational wave\nsignature and also on its role, in combination with neutrino cooling, in\ndetermining the properties of the resulting hypermassive neutron star, of the\nneutrinos produced, and of the ejected material. The ejecta we find are\nconsistent with other recent studies that find that small mass ratios produce\nmore ejecta than equal mass cases (up to some limit) and this ejecta is more\nneutron rich. This trend indicates the importance with future kilonovae\nobservations of measuring the individual masses of an associated binary neutron\nstar system, presumably from concurrent gravitational wave observations, in\norder to be able to extract information about the nuclear equation of state\n", "  We consider a two-dimensional system initialized in a topologically trivial\nstate before its Hamiltonian is ramped through a phase transition into a Chern\ninsulator regime. This scenario is motivated by current experiments with\nultracold atomic gases aimed at realizing time-dependent dynamics in\ntopological insulators. Our main findings are twofold. First, considering\ncoherent dynamics, the non-equilibrium Hall response is found to approach a\ntopologically quantized time averaged value in the limit of slow but\nnon-adiabatic parameter ramps, even though the Chern number of the state\nremains trivial. Second, adding dephasing, the destruction of quantum coherence\nis found to stabilize this Hall response, while the Chern number generically\nbecomes undefined. We provide a geometric picture of this phenomenology in\nterms of the time-dependent Berry curvature.\n", "  The environment of a quantum dot, which is connected to two leads, is modeled\nby telegraph noise, i.e. random Markovian jumps of the (spinless) electron\nenergy on the dot between two levels. The temporal evolutions of the charge on\nthe dot and of the currents in the leads are studied using a recently developed\nsingle-particle basis approach, which is particularly convenient for the\naveraging over the histories of the noise. In the steady state limit we recover\nthe Landauer formula. At a very fast jump rate between the two levels, the\nnoise does not affect the transport. As the jump rate decreases, the effective\naverage transmission crosses over from the transmission through a single\n(average) level to an incoherent sum of the transmissions through the two\nlevels. 13 pages, 6 figuresThe transient temporal evolution towards the steady\nstate is dominated by the displacement current at short times, and by the\nLandauer current at long times. It contains oscillating terms, which decay to\nzero faster than for the case without noise. When the average chemical\npotential on the leads equals the dot's \"original\" energy, without the noise,\nthe oscillations disappear completely and the transient evolution becomes\nindependent of the noise.\n", "  We present the first ab initio cosmological simulations of a CR7-like object\nwhich approximately reproduce the observed line widths and strengths. In our\nmodel, CR7 is powered by a massive ($3.23 \\times 10^7$ $M_\\odot$) black hole\n(BH) the accretion rate of which varies between $\\simeq$ 0.25 and $\\simeq$ 0.9\ntimes the Eddington rate on timescales as short as 10$^3$ yr. Our model takes\ninto account multi-dimensional effects, X-ray feedback, secondary ionizations\nand primordial chemistry. We estimate Ly-$\\alpha$ line widths by\npost-processing simulation output with Monte Carlo radiative transfer and\ncalculate emissivity contributions from radiative recombination and collisional\nexcitation. We find the luminosities in the Lyman-$\\alpha$ and He II 1640\nangstrom lines to be $5.0\\times10^{44}$ and $2.4\\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$,\nrespectively, in agreement with the observed values of $>$ $8.3\\times10^{43}$\nand $2.0\\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We also find that the black hole heats the\nhalo and renders it unable to produce stars as required to keep the halo metal\nfree. These results demonstrate the viability of the BH hypothesis for CR7 in a\ncosmological context. Assuming the BH mass and accretion rate that we find, we\nestimate the synchrotron luminosity of CR7 to be $P \\simeq 10^{40} - 10^{41}$\nerg s$^{-1}$, which is sufficiently luminous to be observed in $\\mu$Jy\nobservations and would discriminate this scenario from one where the luminosity\nis driven by Population III stars.\n", "  We study the response of classical impurities in quantum Ising chains. The Z2\ndegeneracy they entail renders the existence of two decoupled Majorana modes at\nzero energy an exact property of a finite system at arbitrary values of its\nbulk parameters. We trace the evolution of these modes across the transition\nfrom the disordered phase to the ordered one and analyze the concomitant\nqualitative changes of local magnetic properties of an isolated impurity. In\nthe disordered phase, the two ground states differ only close to the impurity,\nand they are related by the action of an explicitly constructed quasi-local\noperator. In this phase the local transverse spin susceptibility follows a\nCurie law. The critical response of a boundary impurity is logarithmically\ndivergent and maps to the two-channel Kondo problem, while it saturates for\ncritical bulk impurities, as well as in the ordered phase. The results for the\nIsing chain translate to the related problem of a resonant level coupled to a\n1d p-wave superconductor or a Peierls chain, whereby the magnetic order is\nmapped to topological order. We find that the topological phase always exhibits\na continuous impurity response to local fields as a result of the level\nrepulsion of local levels from the boundary Majorana zero mode. In contrast,\nthe disordered phase generically features a discontinuous magnetization or\ncharging response. This difference constitutes a general thermodynamic\nfingerprint of topological order in phases with a bulk gap.\n", "  We model the inspiral of a compact object into a more massive black hole\nrotating very near the theoretical maximum. We find that once the body enters\nthe near-horizon regime the gravitational radiation is characterized by a\nconstant frequency, equal to (twice) the horizon frequency, with an\nexponentially damped profile. This contrasts with the usual \"chirping\" behavior\nand, if detected, would constitute a \"smoking gun\" for a near-extremal black\nhole in nature.\n", "  The power law distribution is usually used to fit data in the upper tail of\nthe distribution. However, commonly it is not valid to model data in all the\nrange. In this paper, we present a new family of distributions, the so-called\nGeneralized Power Law (GPL), which can be useful for modeling data in all the\nrange and possess power law tails. To do that, we model the exponent of the\npower law using a nonlinear function which depends on data and two parameters.\nThen, we provide some basic properties and some specific models of that new\nfamily of distributions. After that, we study a relevant model of the family,\nwith special emphasis on the quantile and hazard functions, and the\ncorresponding estimation and testing methods. Finally, as an empirical\nevidence, we study how the debt is distributed across municipalities in Spain.\nWe check that power law model is only valid in the upper tail; we show\nanalytically and graphically the competence of the new model with municipal\ndebt data in the whole range; and we compare the new distribution with other\nwell-known distributions including the Lognormal, the Generalized Pareto, the\nFisk, the Burr type XII and the Dagum models.\n", "  It is widely believed that the large discrepancy between the observed number\nof satellite galaxies and the predicted number of dark subhalos can be resolved\nvia a variety of baryonic effects which suppress star formation in low mass\nhalos.Supporting this hypothesis, numerous high resolution simulations with\nstar formation, and associated feedback have been shown to reproduce the\nsatellite luminosity function around Milky Way-mass simulated galaxies at\nredshift zero. However, a more stringent test of these models is their ability\nto simultaneously match the satellite luminosity functions of a range of host\nhalo masses and redshifts. In this work we measure the luminosity function of\nfaint (sub-Small Magellanic Cloud luminosity) satellites around hosts with\nstellar masses 10.5$<\\log_{10}$M$_*$/M$_\\odot<11.5$ to an unprecedented\nredshift of 1.5. This new measurement of the satellite luminosity function\nprovides powerful new constraining power; we compare these results with\npredictions from four different simulations and show that although the models\nperform similarly over-all, no one model reproduces the satellite luminosity\nfunction reliably at all redshifts and host stellar masses. This result\nhighlights the continued need for improvement in understanding the fundamental\nphysics that governs satellite galaxy evolution.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate quantum correlation of an interacting Fermi\nsystem, which is a nodal superconductor (d-wave superconductor) at zero\ntemperature, via quantum entanglement of two electron spins forming Cooper\npairs (Werner state), tripartite and quantum discord. After calculating\nsingle-electron Green functions, the two-electron space-spin density matrix,\nwhich has X-state form, is obtained. The dependence of quantum correlation to\nthe relative distance of electrons spins of Cooper pair and energy gap is\ninvestigated. One of the results is, for d-wave case, concurrence (as a measure\nof entanglement), quantum discord and tripartite are sensitive to the change of\nmagnitude of gap. Another result is both concurrence and discord oscillate.\nThen, we consider three-dimensional rectangular nano-superconducting grain in\nthe weak coupling frame. The nano-size effect is entered via gap fluctuation.\nThe dependence of quantum correlation to length of superconductor and lower\nbound of robustness of tripartite entanglement are determined. Moreover, we\nshow that quantum correlation of d-wave nano-size superconducting grain\nstrongly depends on length of grain (in contrast to s-wave case). In general,\nit is found that the length of grain lower, the effect of nano-size on quantum\ncorrelation higher. Quantum tripartite for nano-scale d-wave superconductor is\nbetter than for bulk d-wave superconductor. However, we find out both bulk and\nnano-size s-wave superconductors have the same tripartite. Furthermore,\nentanglement length and quantum correlation length are investigated and it is\nshown that there is a length of superconductor in which discord becomes zero.\nAlso, for a given fixed length of superconductor, both a peak in discord and a\npeak in concurrence occur simultaneously.\n", "  The structure of an interior dipole magnetic field of neutron stars in $f(R)$\ngravity is considered. For this purpose, the perturbative approaches are used\nwhen both the deviations from general relativity and the deformations of\nspherically symmetric configurations associated with the presence of the\nmagnetic field are assumed to be small. Solutions are constructed which\ndescribe relativistic, spherically symmetric configurations consisting of a\ngravitating magnetized perfect fluid modeled by a realistic equation of state.\nComparing configurations from general relativity and modified gravity, we\nreveal possible differences in the structure of the magnetic field which occur\nin considering neutron stars in modified gravity.\n", "  We investigate the prospect of constraining scalar field dark energy models\nusing HI 21-cm intensity mapping surveys. We consider a wide class of coupled\nscalar field dark energy models whose predictions about the background\ncosmological evolution are different from the $\\Lambda$CDM predictions by a few\npercent. We find that these models can be statistically distinguished from\n$\\Lambda$CDM through their imprint on the 21-cm angular power spectrum. At the\nfiducial $z= 1.5$, corresponding to a radio interferometric observation of the\npost-reionization HI 21 cm observation at frequency $568 \\rm MHz$, these models\ncan infact be distinguished from the $\\Lambda$CDM model at $ {\\rm SNR }> 3\n\\sigma$ level using a 10,000 hr radio observation distributed over 40 pointings\nof a SKA1-mid like radio-telescope. We also show that tracker models are more\nlikely to be ruled out in comparison with $\\Lambda$CDM than the thawer models.\nFuture radio observations can be instrumental in obtaining tighter constraints\non the parameter space of dark energy models and supplement the bounds obtained\nfrom background studies.\n", "  Sunspot positions from various historical sets of solar drawings are analysed\nwith respect to the tilt angles of bipolar sunspot groups. Data by Scheiner,\nHevelius, Staudacher, Zucconi, Schwabe, and Spoerer deliver a series of average\ntilt angles spanning a period of 270 years, additional to previously found\nvalues for 20th-century data obtained by other authors. We find that the\naverage tilt angles before the Maunder minimum were not significantly different\nfrom the modern values. However, the average tilt angles of a period 50 years\nafter the Maunder minimum, namely for cycles 0 and 1, were much lower and near\nzero. The normal tilt angles before the Maunder minimum suggest that it was not\nabnormally low tilt angles which drove the solar cycle into a grand minimum.\n", "  The kernels in the tangible matter of our everyday experience are composed of\nlight quarks. At least, they are light classically; but they don't remain\nlight. Dynamical effects within the Standard Model of Particle Physics change\nthem in remarkable ways, so that in some configurations they appear nearly\nmassless, but in others possess masses on the scale of light nuclei. Modern\nexperiment and theory are exposing the mechanisms responsible for these\nremarkable transformations. The rewards are great if we can combine the\nemerging sketches into an accurate picture of confinement, which is such a\nsingular feature of the Standard Model; and looming larger amongst the emerging\nideas is a perspective that leads to a Borromean picture of the proton and its\nexcited states.\n", "  We consider the most general, classically-conformal, three-dimensional\n$\\mathcal{N}=1$ Chern-Simons-matter theory with global symmetry $Sp(2)$ and\ngauge group $U(N)\\times U(N)$. We show that the Lagrangian in the on-shell\nformulation of the theory admits one more free parameter as compared to the\ntheory formulated in off-shell $\\mathcal{N}=1$ superspace. The theory on $T^3$\ncan be formally localized. We partially carry out the localization procedure\nfor the theory on $T^3$ with periodic boundary conditions. In particular we\nshow that restricting to the saddle points with vanishing gauge connection\ngives a trivial contribution to the partition function, i.e. the bosonic and\nfermionic contributions exactly cancel each other.\n", "  Beauty tetraquark states $X(\\bar b q'q'' \\bar q )$ composed of $ \\bar b s u\n\\bar d$, $\\bar b d s \\bar u$, and $\\bar b u d \\bar s$, are unique that all the\nfour valence quarks are different. Although the claim of existence of the first\ntwo states by D0 was not confirmed by data from LHCb, the possibility of such\nstates still generated a lot of interests and should be pursued further.\nNon-observation of $X(\\bar b q'q'' \\bar q )$ states by LHCb may be just due to\na still lower production rate than the limit of LHCb or at some different mass\nranges. In this work we use light quark $SU(3)$ flavor symmetry as guideline to\nclassify symmetry properties of beauty tetraquark states. The multiplets which\ncontain states with three different light quarks must be one of ${\\bf \\bar 6}$\nor ${\\bf 15}$ of $SU(3)$ representations. We study possible decays of such a\ntetraquark state into a $B$ meson and a light pesudoscalar octet meson by\nconstructing a leading order chiral Lagrangian, and also provide search\nstrategies to determine whether a given tetraquark state of this type belongs\nto ${\\bf \\bar 6}$ or ${\\bf 15}$. If $X(\\bar b q'q''\\bar q )$ belongs to ${\\bf\n15}$, there are new doubly charged tetraquark states $\\bar b u u \\bar d$ and\n$\\bar b u u \\bar s$.\n", "  The statistics of the velocity gradient tensor in turbulent flows are of both\ntheoretical and practical importance. The Lagrangian view provides a privileged\nperspective for studying the dynamics of turbulence in general, and of the\nvelocity gradient tensor in particular. Stochastic models for the Lagrangian\nevolution of velocity gradients in isotropic turbulence, with closure models\nfor the pressure Hesssian and viscous Laplacian, have been shown to reproduce\nimportant features such as non-Gaussian probability distributions, skewness and\nvorticity strain-rate alignments. The Recent Fluid Deformation (RFD) closure\nintroduced the idea of mapping an isotropic Lagrangian pressure Hessian as\nupstream initial condition using the fluid deformation tensor. Recent work on a\nGaussian fields closure, however, has shown that even Gaussian isotropic\nvelocity fields contain significant anisotropy for the conditional pressure\nHessian tensor due to the inherent velocity-pressure couplings, and that\nassuming an isotropic pressure Hessian as upstream condition may not be\nrealistic. In this paper, Gaussian isotropic field statistics are used to\ngenerate more physical upstream conditions for the recent fluid deformation\nmapping. In this new framework, known isotropy relations can be satisfied {\\it\na priori} and no DNS-tuned coefficients are necessary. A detailed comparison of\nresults from the new model, referred to as the recent deformation of Gaussian\nfields (RDGF) closure, with existing models and DNS shows the improvements\ngained, especially in various single-time statistics of the velocity gradient\ntensor at moderate Reynolds numbers. Application to arbitrarily high Reynolds\nnumbers remains an open challenge for this type of model, however.\n", "  Symmetry-breaking quantum phase transitions play a key role in several\ncondensed matter, cosmology and nuclear physics theoretical models. Its\nobservation in real systems is often hampered by finite temperatures and\nlimited control of the system parameters. In this work we report for the first\ntime the experimental observation of the full quantum phase diagram across a\ntransition where the spatial parity symmetry is broken. Our system is made of\nan ultra-cold gas with tunable attractive interactions trapped in a spatially\nsymmetric double-well potential. At a critical value of the interaction\nstrength, we observe a continuous quantum phase transition where the gas\nspontaneously localizes in one well or the other, thus breaking the underlying\nsymmetry of the system. Furthermore, we show the robustness of the asymmetric\nstate against controlled energy mismatch between the two wells. This is the\nresult of hysteresis associated with an additional discontinuous quantum phase\ntransition that we fully characterize. Our results pave the way to the study of\nquantum critical phenomena at finite temperature, the investigation of\nmacroscopic quantum tunneling of the order parameter in the hysteretic regime\nand the production of strongly quantum entangled states at critical points.\n", "  In a class of two-component Ginzburg-Landau models (TCGL) with a\nU(1)$\\times$U(1) symmetric potential, vortices with a condensate at their core\nmay have significantly lower energies than the Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen (ANO)\nones. On the example of liquid metallic hydrogen (LMH) above the critical\ntemperature for protons we show that the ANO vortices become unstable against\ncore-condensation, while condensate-core (CC) vortices are stable. For LMH the\nratio of the masses of the two types of condensates, $M=m_2/m_1$ is large, and\nthen as a consequence the energy per flux quantum of the vortices, $E_n/n$\nbecomes a non-monotonous function of the number of flux quanta, $n$. This leads\nto yet another manifestation of neither type 1 nor type 2, (type 1.5)\nsuperconductivity: superconducting and normal domains coexist while various\n\"giant\" vortices form. We note that LMH provides a particularly clean example\nof type 1.5 state as the interband coupling between electronic and protonic\nCooper-pairs is forbidden.\n", "  In [1, 2, 3] the Corolla Polynomial $ \\mathcal C (\\Gamma) \\in \\mathbb C\n[a_{h_1}, \\ldots, a_{h_{\\left \\vert \\Gamma^{[1/2]} \\right \\vert}}] $ was\nintroduced as a graph polynomial in half-edge variables $ \\left \\{ a_h \\right\n\\} _{h \\in \\Gamma^{[1/2]}} $ over a 3-regular scalar quantum field theory (QFT)\nFeynman graph $ \\Gamma $. It allows for a covariant quantization of pure\nYang-Mills theory without the need for introducing ghost fields, clarifies the\nrelation between quantum gauge theory and scalar QFT with cubic interaction and\ntranslates back the problem of renormalizing quantum gauge theory to the\nproblem of renormalizing scalar QFT with cubic interaction (which is super\nrenormalizable in 4 dimensions of spacetime). Furthermore, it is, as we\nbelieve, useful for computer calculations. In [4] on which this paper is based\nthe formulation of [1, 2, 3] gets slightly altered in a fashion specialized in\nthe case of the Feynman gauge. It is then formulated as a graph polynomial $\n\\mathcal C ( \\Gamma ) \\in \\mathbb C [a_{h_{1 \\pm}}, \\ldots, a_{h_{\\left \\vert\n\\Gamma^{[1/2]} \\right \\vert} \\vphantom{h}_\\pm}, b_{h_1}, \\ldots, b_{h_{\\left\n\\vert \\Gamma^{[1/2]} \\right \\vert}}] $ in three different types of half-edge\nvariables $ \\left \\{ a_{h_+} , a_{h_-} , b_h \\right \\} _{h \\in \\Gamma^{[1/2]}}\n$. This formulation is also suitable for the generalization to the case of\nspontaneously broken gauge theories (in particular all bosons from the Standard\nModel), as was first worked out in [4] and gets reviewed here.\n", "  Taking the cue from experiments on actin growth on spherical beads, we\nformulate and solve a model problem describing the accretion of an\nincompressible elastic solid on a rigid sphere due to attachment of diffusing\nfree particles. One of the peculiar characteristics of this problem is that\naccretion takes place on the interior surface that separates the body from its\nsupport rather than on its exterior surface, and hence is responsible for\nstress accumulation. Simultaneously, ablation takes place at the outer surface\nwhere material is removed from the body. As the body grows, mechanical effects\nassociated with the build-up of stress and strain energy slow down accretion\nand promote ablation. Eventually, the system reaches a point where internal\naccretion is balanced by external ablation. The present study is concerned with\nthis stationary regime called \"treadmilling\".\n  The principal ingredients of our model are: a nonstandard choice of the\nreference configuration, which allows us to cope with the continually evolving\nmaterial structure; and a driving force and a kinetic law for\naccretion/ablation that involves the difference in chemical potential, strain\nenergy and the radial stress. By combining these ingredients we arrive at an\nalgebraic system which governs the stationary treadmilling state. We establish\nthe conditions under which this system has a solution and we show that this\nsolution is unique. Moreover, by an asymptotic analysis we show that for small\nbeads the thickness of the solid is proportional to the radius of the support\nand is strongly affected by the stiffness of the solid, whereas for large beads\nthe stiffness of the solid is essentially irrelevant, the thickness being\nproportional to a characteristic length that depends on the parameters that\ngovern diffusion and accretion kinetics.\n", "  Separating the influence of hyperfine from spin-orbit interactions in\nspin-dependent carrier recombination and dissociation processes necessitates\nmagnetic resonance spectroscopy over a wide range of frequencies. We have\ndesigned compact and versatile coplanar waveguide resonators for\ncontinuous-wave electrically detected magnetic resonance, and tested these on\norganic light-emitting diodes. By exploiting both the fundamental and\nhigher-harmonic modes of the resonators we cover almost five octaves in\nresonance frequency within a single setup. The measurements with a common\npi-conjugated polymer as the active material reveal small but non-negligible\neffects of spin-orbit interactions, which give rise to a broadening of the\nmagnetic resonance spectrum with increasing frequency.\n", "  Phase transitions are commonly held to occur only in the thermodynamical\nlimit of large number of system components. Here we exemplify at the hand of\nthe exactly solvable Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model and its generalization to\nfinite JC-lattices that finite component systems of coupled spins and bosons\nmay exhibit quantum phase transitions (QPT). For the JC-model we find a\ncontinuous symmetry-breaking QPT, a photonic condensate with a macroscopic\noccupation as the ground state and a Goldstone mode as a low-energy excitation.\nFor the two site JC-lattice we show analytically that it undergoes a\nMott-insulator to superfluid QPT. We identify as the underlying principle of\nthe emergence of finite size QPT the combination of increasing atomic energy\nand increasing interaction strength between the atom and the bosonic mode which\nallows for the exploration of an increasingly large portion of the infinite\ndimensional Hilbert space of the bosonic mode. This suggests that finite system\nphase transitions will be present in a broad range of physical systems.\n", "  We present results of a set of three-dimensional, general relativistic\nradiation magnetohydrodynamics simulations of thin accretion discs around a\nnon-rotating black hole to test their thermal stability. We consider two cases,\none that is initially radiation pressure dominated and expected to be thermally\nunstable and another that is initially gas-pressure dominated and expected to\nremain stable. Indeed, we find that cooling dominates over heating in the\nradiation pressure dominated model, causing the disc to collapse vertically on\nroughly the local cooling timescale. We also find that heating and cooling\nwithin the disc have a different dependence on the mid-plane pressure, a\nprerequisite of thermal instability. Comparison of our data with the relevant\nthin-disc thermal equilibrium curve suggests that our disc may be headed for\nthe thermally stable, gas-pressure-dominated branch. However, because the disc\ncollapses to the point that we are no longer able to resolve it, we had to\nterminate the simulation. On the other hand, the gas pressure dominated model,\nwhich was run for twice as long as the radiation pressure dominated one,\nremains stable, with heating and cooling roughly in balance. Finally, the\nradiation pressure dominated simulation shows some evidence of viscous\ninstability. The strongest evidence is in plots of surface density, which show\nthe disc breaking up into rings.\n", "  A hallmark of the iron-based superconductors is the strong coupling between\nmagnetic, structural and electronic degrees of freedom. However, a universal\npicture of the normal state properties of these compounds has been confounded\nby recent investigations of FeSe where the nematic (structural) and magnetic\ntransitions appear to be decoupled. Here, using synchrotron-based high-energy\nx-ray diffraction and time-domain Moessbauer spectroscopy, we show that\nnematicity and magnetism in FeSe under applied pressure are indeed strongly\ncoupled. Distinct structural and magnetic transitions are observed for\npressures, 1.0 GPa <= p <= 1.7 GPa, which merge into a single first-order phase\nline for p >= 1.7 GPa, reminiscent of what has been observed, both\nexperimentally and theoretically, for the evolution of these transitions in the\nprototypical doped system, Ba(Fe[1-x]Co[x])2As2. Our results support a\nspin-driven mechanism for nematic order in FeSe and provide an important step\ntowards a universal description of the normal state properties of the\niron-based superconductors.\n", "  When charge current passes through a normal metal that exhibits spin Hall\neffect, spin accumulates at the edge of the sample in the transverse direction.\nWe predict that this spin accumulation, or spin voltage, enables quantum\ntunneling of spin through an insulator or vacuum to reach a ferromagnet without\ntransferring charge. In a normal metal/insulator/ferromagnetic insulator\ntrilayer (such as Pt/oxide/YIG), the quantum tunneling explains the\nspin-transfer torque and spin pumping that exponentially decay with the\nthickness of the insulator. In a normal metal/insulator/ferromagnetic metal\ntrilayer (such as Pt/oxide/Co), the spin transfer in general does not decay\nmonotonically with the thickness of the insulator. Combining with the spin Hall\nmagnetoresistance, this tunneling mechanism points to the possibility of a new\ntype of tunneling spectroscopy that can probe the magnon density of states of a\nferromagnetic insulator in an all-electrical and noninvasive manner.\n", "  \\ni We develop a simple method to study the zero-point and thermally\nrenormalized electron energy $\\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k}n}(T)$ for $\\mathbf{k}n$\nthe conduction band minimum or valence maximum in polar semiconductors. We use\nthe adiabatic approximation, including an imaginary broadening parameter\n$i\\delta$ to supress noise in the density-functional integrations. Fr\\\"{o}hlich\npolaron methods provide analytic expressions for the contribution of the\nproblematic optical phonon mode. We use this to correct the renormalization\nobtained from the adiabatic approximation. Test calculations are done for\nzincblende GaN for an 18x18x18 integration grid. The Fr\\\"ohlich correction is\nof order -0.02 eV for the zero-point energy shift of the conduction band\nminimum, and +0.03 eV for the valence band maximum; the correction to\nrenormalization of the 3.28 eV gap is -0.05 eV, a significant fraction of the\ntotal zero point renormalization of -0.15 eV.\n", "  We analyze the transverse stability for a configuration of multiple gaussian\nbunches subject to the self-generated plasma wakefield. Through a\nsemi-analytical approach we first study the equilibrium configuration for the\nmodulated beam and then we investigate the evolution of the equilibrium\nconfiguration due to the emittance-driven expansion of the beam front that\nresults in a rigid backward shift. The rear-directed shift brings the modulated\nbeam out of the equilibrium, with the possibility for some of the bunch\nparticles to be lost with a consequent deterioration of the driver. We look\ntherefore for the proper position of the single bunches that maximize the\nstability without severely affecting the accelerating field behind the driver.\nWe then compare the results with 3D PIC simulations.\n", "  We present a detailed study of the electric and magnetic fields, which are\ncreated on plasma vacuum interfaces as a result of highly intense\nlaser-matter-interactions. For the field generation ultra-thin polymer foils\nwere irradiated with high intensity femtosecond and picosecond laser pulses\nwith ultra-high contrast. To determine the temporal evolution and the spatial\ndistribution of these fields the proton streak deflectometry method has been\ndeveloped further and applied in two different imaging configurations. It\nenabled us to gather complementary information about the investigated field\nstructure, in particular about the influence of different field components\n(parallel and normal to the target surface) and the impact of a moving ion\nfront. The applied ultra-high laser contrast significantly increased the\nreproducibility of the experiment and improved the accuracy of the imaging\nmethod. In order to explain the experimental observations, which were obtained\nby applying ultra-short laser pulses, two different analytical models have been\nstudied in detail. Their ability to reproduce the streak deflectometry\nmeasurements was tested on the basis of three-dimensional particle simulations.\nA modification and combination of the two models allowed for an extensive and\naccurate reproduction of the experimental results in both imaging\nconfigurations. The controlled change of the laser pulse duration from 50\nfemtoseconds to 2.7 picoseconds led to a transition of the dominating force\nacting on the probing proton beam at the rear side of the polymer foil. The\napplied proton deflectometry method allowed for an unambiguous determination of\nthe magnetic field polarity at the rear side of the ultra-thin foil.\n", "  In this paper we study the construction of holomorphic gauge invariant\noperators for general quiver gauge theories with flavour symmetries. Using a\ncharacterisation of the gauge invariants in terms of equivalence classes\ngenerated by permutation actions, along with representation theory results in\nsymmetric groups and unitary groups, we give a diagonal basis for the 2-point\nfunctions of holomorphic and anti-holomorphic operators. This involves a\ngeneralisation of the previously constructed Quiver Restricted Schur operators\nto the flavoured case. The 3-point functions are derived and shown to be given\nin terms of networks of symmetric group branching coefficients. The networks\nare constructed through cutting and gluing operations on the quivers.\n", "  We explore the response of many-body localized (MBL) systems to periodic\ndriving of arbitrary amplitude, focusing on the rate at which they exchange\nenergy with the drive. To this end, we introduce an infinite-temperature\ngeneralization of the effective \"heating rate\" in terms of the spread of a\nrandom walk in energy space. We compute this heating rate numerically and\nestimate it analytically in various regimes. When the drive amplitude is much\nsmaller than the frequency, this effective heating rate is given by linear\nresponse theory with a coefficient that is proportional to the optical\nconductivity; in the opposite limit, the response is nonlinear and the heating\nrate is a nontrivial power-law of time. We discuss the mechanisms underlying\nthis crossover in the MBL phase, and comment on its implications for the\nsubdiffusive thermal phase near the MBL transition.\n", "  The data collected by the LHC collaborations at an energy of 13 TeV indicates\nthe presence of an excess in the diphoton spectrum that would correspond to a\nresonance of a 750 GeV mass. The apparently large production cross section is\nnevertheless very difficult to explain in minimal models. We consider the\npossibility that the resonance is a pseudoscalar boson $A$ with a two--photon\ndecay mediated by a charged and uncolored fermion having a mass at the $\\frac12\nM_A$ threshold and a very small decay width, $\\ll 1$ MeV; one can then generate\na large enhancement of the $A\\gamma\\gamma$ amplitude which explains the excess\nwithout invoking a large multiplicity of particles propagating in the loop,\nlarge electric charges and/or very strong Yukawa couplings. The implications of\nsuch a threshold enhancement are discussed in two explicit scenarios: i) the\nMinimal Supersymmetric Standard Model in which the $A$ state is produced via\nthe top quark mediated gluon fusion process and decays into photons\npredominantly through loops of charginos with masses close to $\\frac12 M_A$ and\nii) a two Higgs doublet model in which $A$ is again produced by gluon fusion\nbut decays into photons through loops of vector--like charged heavy leptons. We\nalso comment on a minimal scenario in which the $A$ state couples only to\nphotons through a heavy lepton loop and is both produced and decays through\nthis coupling. In all these scenarios, while the mass of the charged fermion\nhas to be adjusted to be extremely close to half of the $A$ resonance mass, the\nsmall total widths are naturally obtained if only suppressed three-body decay\nchannels occur. Finally, the implications of some of these scenarios for dark\nmatter are discussed.\n", "  Umbrella sampling efficiently yields equilibrium averages that depend on\nexploring rare states of a model by biasing simulations to windows of\ncoordinate values and then combining the resulting data with physical\nweighting. Here, we introduce a mathematical framework that casts the step of\ncombining the data as an eigenproblem. The advantage to this approach is that\nit facilitates error analysis. We discuss how the error scales with the number\nof windows. Then, we derive a central limit theorem for averages that are\nobtained from umbrella sampling. The central limit theorem suggests an\nestimator of the error contributions from individual windows, and we develop a\nsimple and computationally inexpensive procedure for implementing it. We\ndemonstrate this estimator for simulations of the alanine dipeptide and show\nthat it emphasizes low free energy pathways between stable states in comparison\nto existing approaches for assessing error contributions. We discuss the\npossibility of using the estimator and, more generally, the eigenvector method\nfor umbrella sampling to guide adaptation of the simulation parameters to\naccelerate convergence.\n", "  We study the Stoke's efficiency and its fluctuating properties in the case of\na spatial asymmetric ratchet potential with a temporal asymmetric driving force\nfrom adiabatic to nonadiabatic regime. Our numerical investigations show that\nthe average Stoke's efficiency and the average current decrease with the\nfrequency of driving. For low frequency of driving, i.e., in the case of an\nadiabatic regime, we reproduced the analytical results supporting our numerical\nsimulations. By evaluating the probability distribution, $p(\\eta_{s})$ for\nStoke's efficiency, $\\eta_{s}$ we focus on the stochastic properties of Stokes\nefficiency. We find that in most of the parameter space, fluctuations in\n$\\eta_{s}$ are comparable to or larger than the mean values. In such a\nsituation one has to study the full probability distribution of $\\eta_{s}$.\nWith increase in frequency of driving, the distribution becomes multipeaked. At\nthe same time the average Stoke's efficiency decreases with increase in\nfrequency of drive. For high frequency of driving, the distribution develops a\npeak across zero. Further increase in frequency this peak gets sharper. And\nfinally at sufficiently high frequency we get a strong peak across zero\nindicating that there is no effective transport in this regime.\n", "  Higgs portal dark matter (DM) models are simple interesting and viable DM\nmodels. There are three types of the models depending on the DM spin: scalar,\nfermion and vector DM models. In this paper, we consider renormalizable,\nunitary and gauge invariant Higgs portal DM models, and study how large\nparameter regions can be surveyed at the International Linear Collider (ILC)\nexperiment at $\\sqrt{s}=500$ GeV. For the Higgs portal singlet fermion and\nvector DM cases, the force mediator involves two scalar propagators, the\nSM-like Higgs boson and the dark Higgs boson. We show that their interference\ngenerates interesting and important patterns in the mono-$Z$ plus missing $E_T$\nsignatures at the ILC, and the results are completely different from those\nobtained from the Higgs portal DM models within the effective field theories.\nIn addition, we show that it would be possible to distinguish the spin of DM in\nthe Higgs portal scenarios, if the shape of the recoil-mass distribution is\nobserved. We emphasize that the interplay between these collider observations\nand those in the direct detection experiments has to be performed in the model\nwith renomalizability and unitarity to combine the model analyses in different\nscales.\n", "  Any tripartite state which saturates the strong subadditivity relation for\nthe quantum entropy is defined as the Markov state.A tripartite pure state\ndescribing an open system, its environment and their purifying system isa pure\nMarkov state iff the bipartite marginal state of purifying system and\nenvironment is a product state. It has been shown that as long as the\npurification of the input system-environment state is a pure Markov state the\nreduced dynamics of the open system can be described, on the support of initial\nsystem state, by a quantum channel for every joint unitary evolution of the\nsystem-environment composite even in the presence of initial correlations.\nEntanglement, discord and classical correlations of the initial\nsystem-environment states implied by the pure Markov state are analyzed and it\nhas been shown that all these correlations are entirely specified by the\nentropy of the environment. Some implications concerning perfect quantum error\ncorrection procedure and quantum Markovian dynamics are presented.\n", "  We review the recent developments of the polariton physics in microcavities\nfeaturing the exciton-photon strong coupling at room-temperature, and leading\nto the achievement of room-temperature polariton condensates. Such cavities\nembed active layers with robust excitons that present a large binding energy\nand a large oscillator strength, i.e. wide bandgap inorganic or organic\nsemiconductors, or organic molecules. These various systems are compared, in\nterms of figures of merit and of common features related to their strong\noscillator strength. The various demonstrations of polariton laser are\ncompared, as well as their condensation phase diagrams. The room-temperature\noperation indeed allows a detailed investigation of the thermodynamic and\nout-of-equilibrium regimes of the condensation process. The crucial role of the\nspatial dynamics of the condensate formation is discussed, as well as the\ndebated issue of the mechanism of stimulated relaxation from the reservoir to\nthe condensate under non-resonant excitation. Finally the prospects of\npolariton devices are presented.\n", "  Thermal decoherence is a major obstacle to the realization of quantum\ncoherence for massive mechanical oscillators. Although optical trapping has\nbeen used to reduce the thermal decoherence rate for such oscillators, it also\nincreases the rate by subjecting the oscillator to stochastic forces resulting\nfrom the frequency fluctuations of the optical field, thereby setting a\nfundamental limit on the reduction. This is analogous to the noise penalty in\nan active feedback system. Here, we directly measure the rethermalizaton\nprocess for an initially cooled and optically trapped suspended mirror, and\nidentify the current limiting decoherence rate as due to the optical trap. Our\nexperimental study of the trap-induced decoherence rate will enable future\nadvances in the probing of fundamental quantum mechanics in the bad cavity\nregime, such as testing of deformed commutators.\n", "  We summarize the impact of sterile neutrino dark matter on core-collapse\nsupernova explosions. We explore various oscillations between electron\nneutrinos or mixed $\\mu-\\tau$ neutrinos and right-handed sterile neutrinos that\nmay occur within a core-collapse supernova. In particular, we consider sterile\nneutrino masses and mixing angles that are consistent with sterile neutrino\ndark matter candidates as indicated by recent X-ray flux measurements. We find\nthat the interpretation of the observed 3.5 keV X-ray excess as due to a\ndecaying 7 keV sterile neutrino that comprises 100\\% of the dark matter would\nhave almost no observable effect on supernova explosions. However, in the more\nrealistic case in which the decaying sterile neutrino comprises only a small\nfraction of the total dark matter density due to the presence of other sterile\nneutrino flavors, WIMPs, etc., a larger mixing angle is allowed. In this case a\n7 keV sterile neutrino could have a significant impact on core-collapse\nsupernovae. We also consider mixing between $\\mu-\\tau$ neutrinos and sterile\nneutrinos. We find, however, that this mixing does not significantly alter the\nexplosion and has no observable effect on the neutrino luminosities at early\ntimes.\n", "  Novel ground states might be realized in honeycomb lattices with strong\nspin-orbit coupling. Here we study the electronic structure of\n${\\alpha}$-RuCl$_3$, in which the Ru ions are in a d5 configuration and form a\nhoneycomb lattice, by angle-resolved photoemission, x-ray photoemission and\nelectron energy loss spectroscopy supported by density functional theory and\nmultiplet calculations. We find that ${\\alpha}$-RuCl$_3$ is a Mott insulator\nwith significant spin-orbit coupling, whose low energy electronic structure is\nnaturally mapped onto Jeff states. This makes ${\\alpha}$-RuCl$_3$ a promising\ncandidate for the realization of Kitaev physics. Relevant electronic parameters\nsuch as the Hubbard energy U, the crystal field splitting 10Dq and the charge\ntransfer energy are evaluated. Furthermore, we observe significant Cl\nphotodesorption with time, which must be taken into account when interpreting\nphotoemission and other surface sensitive experiments.\n", "  Observational biases distort our view of nature, such that the patterns we\nsee within a surveyed population of interest are often unrepresentative of the\ntruth we seek. Transiting planets currently represent the most informative data\nset on the ensemble properties of exoplanets within 1 AU of their star.\nHowever, the transit method is inherently biased due to both geometric and\ndetection-driven effects. In this work, we derive the overall observational\nbiases affecting the most basic transit parameters from first principles. By\nassuming a trapezoidal transit and using conditional probability, we infer the\nexpected distribution of these terms both as a joint distribution and in a\nmarginalized form. These general analytic results provide a baseline against\nwhich to compare trends predicted by mission-tailored injection/recovery\nsimulations and offer a simple way to correct for observational bias. Our\nresults explain why the observed population of transiting planets displays a\nnon-uniform impact parameter distribution, with a bias towards near-equatorial\ngeometries. We also find that the geometric bias towards observed planets\ntransiting near periastron is attenuated by the longer durations which occur\nnear apoastron. Finally, we predict that the observational bias with respect to\nratio-of-radii is super-quadratic, scaling as $(R_P/R_{\\star})^{5/2}$, driven\nby an enhanced geometric transit probability and modestly longer durations.\n", "  We study the renormalization flow of the Higgs potential as a function of\nboth field amplitude and energy scale. This overcomes limitations of\nconventional techniques that rely, e.g., on an identification of field\namplitude and RG scale, or on local field expansions. Using a Higgs-Yukawa\nmodel with discrete chiral symmetry as an example, our global flows in field\nspace clarify the origin of possible meta-stabilities, the fate of the\npseudo-stable phase, and provide new information about the renormalization of\nthe tunnel barrier. Our results confirm the relaxation of the lower bound for\nthe Higgs mass in the presence of more general microscopic interactions\n(higher-dimensional operators) to a high quantitative accuracy.\n", "  In this paper we present a new mathematical rigorous technique for computing\nthe average free energy of a disordered system with quenched randomness, using\nthe replicas. The basic tool of this technique is a distributional\nzeta-function, a complex function whose derivative at the origin yields the\naverage free energy of the system as the sum of two contributions: the first\none is a series in which all the integer moments of the partition function of\nthe model contribute; the second one, which can not be written as a series of\nthe integer moments, can be made as small as desired. This result supports the\nuse of integer moments of the partition function, computed via replicas, for\nexpressing the average free energy of the system. One advantage of the proposed\nformalism is that it does not require the understanding of the properties of\nthe permutation group when the number of replicas goes to zero. Moreover, the\nsymmetry is broken using the saddle-point equations of the model. As an\napplication for the distributional zeta-function technique, we obtain the\naverage free energy of the disordered $\\lambda\\varphi^{4}$ model defined in a\n$d$-dimensional Euclidean space.\n", "  In this article, we assign the $D_{s3}^*(2860)$ to be a D-wave $c\\bar{s}$\nmeson, and study the mass and decay constant of the $D_{s3}^*(2860)$ with the\nQCD sum rules by calculating the contributions of the vacuum condensates up to\ndimension-6 in the operator product expansion. The predicted mass\n$M_{D_{s3}^*}=(2.86\\pm0.10)\\,\\rm{GeV}$ is in excellent agreement with the\nexperimental value $M_{D_{s3}^*}=(2860.5\\pm 2.6 \\pm 2.5\\pm 6.0)\\,\\rm{ MeV}$\nfrom the LHCb collaboration. The present prediction supports assigning the\n$D_{s3}^*(2860)$ to be the D-wave $c\\bar{s}$ meson.\n", "  Current mm/submm interferometers, like the Atacama Large mm/submm Array\n(ALMA), use receivers that register the sky signal in a linear polarization\nbasis. In the case of observations performed in full-polarization mode (where\nthe cross-correlations are computed among all the polarization channels) it is\npossible to reconstruct the full-polarization brightness distribution of the\nobserved sources, as long as a proper calibration of delay offsets and leakage\namong polarization channels can be performed. Observations of calibrators,\npreferably with some linear polarization, with a good parallactic angle\ncoverage are usually needed for such a calibration. In principle,\ndual-polarization observations only allow us to recover the Stokes $I$\nintensity distribution of the sources, regardless of the parallactic angle\ncoverage of the observations. In this paper, we present a novel technique of\ndual differential polarimetry that makes it possible to obtain information\nrelated to the full-polarization brightness distribution of the observed\nsources from dual-polarization observations. This technique is inspired in the\nEarth-rotation polarization synthesis and can be applied even to sources with\ncomplex structures.\n", "  Several lines of evidence suggest that the velocity amplitude in global\nsimulations of solar convection, U, may be systematically over-estimated.\nMotivated by these recent results, we explore the factors that determine U and\nwe consider how these might scale to solar parameter regimes. To this end, we\ndecrease the thermal diffusivity $\\kappa$ along two paths in parameter space.\nIf the kinematic viscosity $\\nu$ is decreased proportionally with $\\kappa$\n(fixing the Prandtl number $P_r = \\nu/\\kappa$), we find that U increases but\nasymptotes toward a constant value, as found by Featherstone & Hindman (2016).\nHowever, if $\\nu$ is held fixed while decreasing $\\kappa$ (increasing $P_r$),\nwe find that U systematically decreases. We attribute this to an enhancement of\nthe thermal content of downflow plumes, which allows them to carry the solar\nluminosity with slower flow speeds. We contrast this with the case of\nRayleigh-Benard convection which is not subject to this luminosity constraint.\nThis dramatic difference in behavior for the two paths in parameter space\n(fixed $P_r$ or fixed $\\nu$) persists whether the heat transport by unresolved,\nnear-surface convection is modeled as a thermal conduction or as a fixed flux.\nThe results suggest that if solar convection can operate in a high-$P_r$\nregime, then this might effectively limit the velocity amplitude. Small-scale\nmagnetism is a possible source of enhanced viscosity that may serve to achieve\nthis high-$P_r$ regime.\n", "  We present a simple, robust and black-box approach to the implementation and\nuse of local, periodic, atom-centered Gaussian basis functions within a plane\nwave code, in a computationally efficient manner. The procedure outlined is\nbased on the representation of the Gaussians within a finite bandwidth by their\nunderlying plane wave coefficients. The core region is handled within the\nprojected augment wave framework, by pseudizing the Gaussian functions within a\ncut-off radius around each nucleus, smoothing the functions so that they are\nfaithfully represented by a plane wave basis with only moderate kinetic energy\ncutoff. To mitigate the effects of the basis set superposition error and\nincompleteness at the mean-field level introduced by the Gaussian basis, we\nalso propose a hybrid approach, whereby the complete occupied space is first\nconverged within a large plane wave basis, and the Gaussian basis used to\nconstruct a complementary virtual space for the application of correlated\nmethods. We demonstrate that these pseudized Gaussians yield compact and\nsystematically improvable spaces with an accuracy comparable to their\nnon-pseudized Gaussian counterparts. A key advantage of the described method is\nits ability to efficiently capture and describe electronic correlation effects\nof weakly bound and low-dimensional systems, where plane waves are not\nsufficiently compact or able to be truncated without unphysical artefacts. We\ninvestigate the accuracy of the pseudized Gaussians for the water dimer\ninteraction, neon solid and water adsorption on a LiH surface, at the level of\nsecond-order M\\{o}ller--Plesset perturbation theory.\n", "  We present the first lattice-QCD calculation of the isovector polarized\nparton distribution functions (both helicity and transversity) using the\nlarge-momentum effective field theory (LaMET) approach for direct Bjorken-$x$\ndependence. We first review the detailed steps of the procedure in the\nunpolarized case, then generalize to the helicity and transversity cases. We\nalso derive a new mass-correction formulation for all three cases. We then\ncompare the effects of each finite-momentum correction using lattice data\ncalculated at $M_\\pi\\approx 310$ MeV. Finally, we discuss the implications of\nthese results for the poorly known antiquark structure and predict the\nsea-flavor asymmetry in the transversely polarized nucleon.\n", "  The recent discovery of the unprecedentedly superluminous transient\nASASSN-15lh (or SN 2015L) with its UV-bright secondary peak challenges all the\npower-input models that have been proposed for superluminous supernovae. Here\nwe examine some of the few viable interpretations of ASASSN-15lh in the context\nof a stellar explosion, involving combinations of one or more power inputs. We\nmodel the lightcurve of ASASSN-15lh with a hybrid model that includes\ncontributions from magnetar spin-down energy and hydrogen-poor circumstellar\ninteraction. We also investigate models of pure circumstellar interaction with\na massive hydrogen-deficient shell and discuss the lack of interaction features\nin the observed spectra. We find that, as a supernova ASASSN-15lh can be best\nmodeled by the energetic core-collapse of a ~40 Msun star interacting with a\nhydrogen-poor shell of ~20 Msun. The circumstellar shell and progenitor mass\nare consistent with a rapidly rotating pulsational pair-instability supernova\nprogenitor as required for strong interaction following the final supernova\nexplosion. Additional energy injection by a magnetar with initial period of 1-2\nms and magnetic field of 0.1-1 x 10^14 G may supply the excess luminosity\nrequired to overcome the deficit in single-component models, but this requires\nmore fine-tuning and extreme parameters for the magnetar, as well as the\nassumption of efficient conversion of magnetar energy into radiation. We thus\nfavor a single-input model where the reverse shock formed in a strong SN\nejecta-CSM interaction following a very powerful core-collapse SN explosion can\nsupply the luminosity needed to reproduce the late-time UV-bright plateau.\n", "  The next generation of experiments in particle physics will for the first\ntime systematically test flavor physics models based on flavon fields. Starting\nfrom the current quark-flavor constrains on such models we show how the new\ngeneration of lepton flavor experiments will dominate indirect searches in the\ncoming decades. A future 100 TeV hadron collider will then be the first\nexperiment to probe flavons as propagating degrees of freedom. Our estimate of\nthe collider reach relies on a proper treatment of backgrounds and detector\neffects. Complementary searches for indirect effects in lepton flavor\nexperiments and propagating degrees of freedom at colliders are very limited at\nthe LHC, but will be a new feature at a 100 TeV hadron collider.\n", "  Metal-to-insulator transitions (MITs) are a dramatic manifestation of strong\nelectron correlations in solids1. The insulating phase can often be suppressed\nby quantum tuning, i.e. varying a nonthermal parameter such as chemical\ncomposi- tion or pressure, resulting in a zero-temperature quantum phase\ntransition (QPT) to a metallic state driven by quantum fluctuations, in\ncontrast to conventional phase transitions driven by thermal fluctuations.\nTheories of exotic phenomena known to occur near the Mott QPT such as quantum\ncriticality and high-temperature superconductivity often assume a second-order\nQPT, but direct experimental evidence for either first- or second-order\nbehavior at the magnetic QPT associated with the Mott transition has been\nscarce and further masked by the superconducting phase in unconventional\nsuperconductors. Most measurements of QPTs have been performed by\nvolume-integrated probes, such as neutron scattering, magnetization, and\ntransport, in which discontinuous behavior, phase separation, and spatially\ninhomogeneous responses are averaged and smeared out, leading at times to\nmisidentification as continuous second-order transitions. Here, we demonstrate\nthrough muon spin relaxation/rotation (MuSR) experiments on two archetypal Mott\ninsulating systems, composition-tuned RENiO3 (RE=rare earth element) and\npressured-tuned V2O3, that the QPT from antiferromagnetic insulator to\nparamagnetic metal is first-order: the magnetically ordered volume fraction\ndecreases to zero at the QPT, resulting in a broad region of intrinsic phase\nseparation, while the ordered magnetic moment retains its full value across the\nphase diagram until it is suddenly destroyed at the QPT. These findings call\nfor further investigation into the role of inelastic soft modes and the nature\nof dynamic spin and charge fluctuations underlying the transition.\n", "  We present a simple prescription for computing conformal blocks and\ncorrelation functions holographically in AdS$_3$ in terms of Wilson lines\nmerging at a bulk vertex. This is shown to reproduce global conformal blocks\nand heavy-light Virasoro blocks. In the case of higher spin theories the space\nof vertices is in one-to-one correspondence with the space of ${\\cal W}_N$\nconformal blocks, and we show how the latter are obtained by explicit\ncomputations.\n", "  The recent maturation of hybrid quantum devices has led to significant\nenhancements in the functionality of a wide variety of quantum systems. In\nparticular, harnessing mechanical resonators for manipulation and control has\nexpanded the use of two-level systems in quantum information science and\nquantum sensing. In this letter, we report on a monolithic hybrid quantum\ndevice in which strain fields associated with resonant vibrations of a diamond\ncantilever dynamically control the optical transitions of a single\nnitrogen-vacancy (NV) defect center in diamond. We quantitatively characterize\nthe strain coupling to the orbital states of the NV center, and with mechanical\ndriving, we observe NV-strain couplings exceeding 10 GHz. Furthermore, we use\nthis strain-mediated coupling to match the frequency and polarization\ndependence of the zero-phonon lines of two spatially separated and initially\ndistinguishable NV centers. The experiments demonstrated here mark an important\nstep toward engineering a quantum device capable of realizing and probing the\ndynamics of non-classical states of mechanical resonators, spin-systems, and\nphotons.\n", "  We present fully dynamical solutions to Einstein-scalar theory in\nasymptotically Anti-de-Sitter spacetime with a scalar potential containing\nparticularly rich physics. Depending on one parameter in the potential we find\nan especially interesting regime, which exhibits a thermodynamically stable,\nbut dynamically unstable black brane, even at zero momentum. We show this using\nthe non-linear dynamics, and give a clear interpretation in terms of the\nspectrum of linearized perturbations. Our results translate directly to their\ndual strongly coupled non-conformal field theories.\n", "  Based on the gauge/gravity correspondence, the hydrodynamic response\ncoefficients, shear and Hall viscosities, have been studied. The holographic\nmodel of Einstein-Maxwell- AdS $(3+1)$-dimensional system additionally coupled\nwith the another gauge field mimicking the {\\it dark matter} sector, as well\nas, gravitational Chern-Simons term bounded with a dynamical scalar field, were\ntaken into account. Condensation of the scalar field provides the parity\nviolating term. Both shear and Hall viscosities have been calculated and their\ndependence on $\\alpha$ - the coupling constant between matter and {\\it dark\nmatter} sectors has been studied. To the lowest order in the derivative\nexpansion and perturbation in $\\alpha$, the shear viscosity is not influenced\nby the {\\it dark matter}, while the Hall component linearly depends on\n$\\alpha$.\n", "  We study the decay of heavy sterile Majorana neutrinos according to the\ninteractions obtained from an effective general theory. We describe the two and\nthree-body decays for a wide range of neutrino masses. The results obtained and\npresented in this work could be useful for the study of the production and\ndetection of this particles in a variety of high energy physics experiments and\nastrophysical observations. We show in different figures the dominant branching\nratios and the total decay width.\n", "  We compute the effective action of the Polyakov loop in SU(2) and SU(3)\nYang-Mills theory using a previously developed covariant variational approach.\nThe formalism is extended to background gauge and it is shown how to relate the\nlow order Green's functions to the ones in Landau gauge studied earlier. The\nrenormalization procedure is discussed. The self-consistent effective action is\nderived and evaluated using the numerical solution of the gap equation. We find\na clear signal for a deconfinement phase transition at finite temperatures,\nwhich is second order for SU(2) and first order for SU(3). The critical\ntemperatures obtained are in reasonable agreement with high precision lattice\ndata.\n", "  This article reports the study of SnO by using the first-principles\npseudopotential plane-wave method within the generalized gradient approximation\n(GGA). We have calculated the structural, elastic, electronic and optical of\nSnO under high pressure. The elastic properties such as the elastic constants\nCij bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young modulus, anisotropic factor, Pugh ratio,\nPoisson ratio are calculated and analyzed. Mechanical stability of SnO at all\npressure are confirmed by using Born stability criteria in terms of elastic\nconstants and are associated with ductile behaviour based on G/B ratios. It is\nalso found that SnO exhibits very high anisotropy. The energy band structure\nand density of states are also calculated and analyzed. The results show the\nsemiconducting and metallic properties at 0 (zero) and high pressure,\nrespectively. Furthermore, the optical properties such as dielectric function,\nrefractive index, photoconductivity, absorption coefficients, loss function and\nreflectivity are also calculated. All the results are compared with those of\nthe SnO where available but most of the results at high pressure are not\ncompared due to unavailability of the results.\n", "  Strong magnetic fields are commonly generated in off-central relativistic\nheavy-ion collisions in the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at\nBrookhaven National Lab and in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN and have been\nused to probe the topological configurations of the QCD vacua. A strong\nmagnetic field can affect the character and location of the QCD critical point,\ninfluence the QCD phases, and lead to anomalous transport of charge. To take\nadvantage of the magnetic field as a probe of QCD at higher baryon densities,\nwe are going to need experiments capable to scan the lower energy region. In\nthis context, the nuclotron-based ion collider facility (NICA) at JINR offers a\nunique opportunity to explore such a region and complement alternative programs\nat RHIC and other facilities. In this paper we discuss some relevant problems\nof the interplay between QCD and magnetic fields and the important role the\nexperiments at NICA can play in tackling them.\n", "  The three axis magnetic field measurement based on the interaction of a\nsingle elliptically polarized light beam with an atomic system is described.\nThe magnetic field direction dependent atomic responses are extracted by the\npolarimetric detection in combination with laser frequency modulation and\nmagnetic field modulation techniques. The magnetometer offers additional\ncritical requirements like compact size and large dynamic range for space\napplication. Further, the three axis magnetic field is measured using only\nreflected signal from the polarimeter, thus can be easily expanded to make\nspatial array of detectors or / and high sensitivity field gradient measurement\nas required for biomedical application.\n", "  We study the vapour-liquid phase behaviour of an ionic fluid confined in a\nrandom porous matrix formed by uncharged hard sphere particles. The ionic fluid\nis modelled as an equimolar binary mixture of oppositely charged equisized hard\nspheres, the so-called restricted primitive model (RPM). Considering the\nmatrix-fluid system as a partly-quenched model, we develop a theoretical\napproach which combines the method of collective variables with the extension\nof the scaled-particle theory (SPT) for a hard-sphere fluid confined in a\ndisordered hard-sphere matrix. The approach allows us to formulate the\nperturbation theory using the SPT for the description of the thermodynamics of\nthe reference system. The phase diagrams of the RPM in matrices of different\nporosities and for different size ratios of matrix and fluid particles are\ncalculated in the random-phase approximation and also when the effects of\nhigher-order correlations between ions are taken into account. Both\napproximations correctly reproduce the basic effects of porous media on the\nvapour-liquid phase diagram, i.e., with a decrease of porosity the critical\npoint shifts toward lower fluid densities and lower temperatures and the\ncoexistence region is getting narrower. For the fixed matrix porosity, both the\ncritical temperature and the critical density increase with an increase of size\nof matrix particles and tend to the critical values of the bulk RPM.\n", "  Reducing the number of contacts between passengers on an airplane can\npotentially curb the spread of infectious diseases. In this paper, a social\nforce based pedestrian movement model is formulated and applied to evaluate the\nmovement and contacts among passengers during boarding and deplaning of an\nairplane. Within the social force modeling framework, we introduce location\ndependence on the self-propelling momentum of pedestrian particles. The model\nparameters are varied over a large design space and the results are compared\nwith experimental observations to validate the model. This model is then used\nto assess the different approaches to minimize passenger contacts during\nboarding and deplaning of airplanes. We find that smaller aircrafts are\neffective in reducing the contacts between passengers. Column wise deplaning\nand random boarding are found to be two strategies that reduced the number of\ncontacts during passenger movement, and can potentially lower the likelihood of\ninfection spread.\n", "  We extend the quantization \\`a la Faddeev-Jackiw for non-autonomous singular\nsystems. This leads to a generalization of the Schr\\\"odinger equation for those\nsystems. The method is exemplified by the quantization of the damped harmonic\noscillator and the relativistic particle in an external electromagnetic field.\n", "  Spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat solutions of Shape Dynamics were\npreviously studied assuming standard falloff conditions for the metric and the\nmomenta. These ensure that the spacetime is asymptotically Minkowski, and that\nthe falloff conditions are Poincar\\'e-invariant. These requirements however are\nnot legitimate in Shape Dynamics, which does not make assumptions on the\nstructure or regularity of spacetime. Analyzing the same problem in full\ngenerality, I find that the system is underdetermined, as there is one function\nof time that is not fixed by any condition and appears to have physical\nrelevance. This quantity can be fixed only by studying more realistic models\ncoupled with matter, and it turns out to be related to the dilatational\nmomentum of the matter surrounding the region under study.\n", "  We measured the properties of a novel combination of two Gas Electron\nMultipliers with a Micromegas for use as amplification devices in high-rate\ngaseous time projection chambers. The goal of this design is to minimize the\nbuildup of space charge in the drift volume of such detectors in order to\neliminate the standard gating grid and its resultant dead time, while\npreserving good tracking and particle identification performance. We measured\nthe positive ion back-flow and energy resolution at various element gains and\nelectric fields, using a variety of gases, and additionally studied crosstalk\neffects and discharge rates. At a gain of 2000, this configuration achieves an\nion back-flow below 0.4% and an energy resolution better than\n$\\sigma/\\text{E}=12\\%$ for $^{55}$Fe X-rays.\n", "  We construct a three dimensional deconfinement method which enables us to\nfind new three-dimensional dualities and we apply various techniques developed\nin four dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories, such as the product gauge\ngroups and Seiberg-Witten curves to the three dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=2$\nsupersymmetric gauge theories. Dual descriptions of three dimensional\n$\\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories which involve two-index matters,\nfor example, adjoint, symmetric, and anti-symmetric matters without\nsuperpotentials can be obtained. These matters are described in terms of\ns-confining phases of the supersymmetric gauge theories.\n", "  We review the present status of the determination of parton distribution\nfunctions (PDFs) in the light of the precision requirements for the LHC in Run\n2 and other future hadron colliders. We provide brief reviews of all currently\navailable PDF sets and use them to compute cross sections for a number of\nbenchmark processes, including Higgs boson production in gluon-gluon fusion at\nthe LHC. We show that the differences in the predictions obtained with the\nvarious PDFs are due to particular theory assumptions made in the fits of those\nPDFs. We discuss PDF uncertainties in the kinematic region covered by the LHC\nand on averaging procedures for PDFs, such as advocated by the PDF4LHC15 sets,\nand provide recommendations for the usage of PDF sets for theory predictions at\nthe LHC.\n", "  We consider hadronic top quark pair production and pair production in\nassociation with a photon or a $Z$ boson to probe electroweak dipole couplings\nin $t\\bar{b}W$, $t\\bar{t}\\gamma$ and $t\\bar{t}Z$ interactions. We demonstrate\nhow measurements of these processes at the 13 TeV LHC can be combined to\ndisentangle and constrain anomalous dipole operators. The construction of cross\nsection ratios allows us to significantly reduce various uncertainties and\nexploit orthogonal sensitivity between the $t\\bar{t}\\gamma$ and $t\\bar{t}Z$\ncouplings. In addition, we show that angular correlations in $t\\bar{t}$\nproduction can be used to constrain the remaining $t\\bar{b}W$ dipole operator.\nOur approach yields excellent sensitivity to the anomalous couplings and can be\na further step towards precise and direct measurements of the top quark\nelectroweak interactions.\n", "  We use astrometry of Pluto and other TNOs to constrain the sky location,\ndistance, and mass of the possible additional planet (Planet Nine) hypothesized\nby Batygin and Brown (2016). We find that over broad regions of the sky, the\ninclusion of a massive, distant planet degrades the fits to the observations.\nHowever, in other regions, the fits are significantly improved by the addition\nof such a planet. Our best fits suggest a planet that is either more massive or\ncloser than argued for by Batygin and Brown (2016) based on the orbital\ndistribution of distant trans-neptunian objects (or by Fienga et al. (2016)\nbased on range measured to the Cassini spacecraft). The trend to favor larger\nand closer perturbing planets is driven by the residuals to the astrometry of\nPluto, remeasured from photographic plates using modern stellar catalogs (Buie\nand Folkner 2015), which show a clear trend in declination, over the course of\ntwo decades, that drive a preference for large perturbations. Although this\ntrend may be the result of systematic errors of unknown origin in the\nobservations, a possible resolution is that the declination trend may be due to\nperturbations from a body, additional to Planet Nine , that is closer to Pluto,\nbut less massive than, Planet Nine .\n", "  In this paper we investigate the coherence properties of a quantum dot under\ntwo-photon resonant excitation in combination with an additional\nphoto-neutralization laser. The photo-neutralization increases the efficiency\nof the excitation process and thus, the brightness of the source, by a factor\nof approximately 1.5 for biexciton-exciton pairs. This enhancement does not\ndegrade the relevant coherences in the system; neither the single photon\ncoherence time, nor the coherence of the excitation process.\n", "  We study the $(1,0)$ six-dimensional SCFTs living on defects of non-geometric\nheterotic backgrounds (T-fects) preserving a $E_7\\times E_8$ subgroup of\n$E_8\\times E_8$. These configurations can be dualized explicitly to F-theory on\nelliptic K3-fibered non-compact Calabi-Yau threefolds. We find that the\nmajority of the resulting dual threefolds contain non-resolvable singularities.\nIn those cases in which we can resolve the singularities we explicitly\ndetermine the SCFTs living on the defect. We find a form of duality in which\ndistinct defects are described by the same IR fixed point. For instance, we\nfind that a subclass of non-geometric defects are described by the SCFT arising\nfrom small heterotic instantons on ADE singularities.\n", "  We propose an efficient Monte Carlo method for the computation of the volumes\nof high-dimensional bodies with arbitrary shape. We start with a region of\nknown volume within the interior of the manifold and then use the multistate\nBennett acceptance-ratio method to compute the dimensionless free-energy\ndifference between a series of equilibrium simulations performed within this\nobject. The method produces results that are in excellent agreement with\nthermodynamic integration, as well as a direct estimate of the associated\nstatistical uncertainties. The histogram method also allows us to directly\nobtain an estimate of the interior radial probability density profile, thus\nyielding useful insight into the structural properties of such a\nhigh-dimensional body. We illustrate the method by analyzing the effect of\nstructural disorder on the basins of attraction of mechanically stable packings\nof soft repulsive spheres.\n", "  Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are ubiquitous in galaxies with a sizable\nmass. It is expected that a pair of SMBHs originally in the nuclei of two\nmerging galaxies would form a binary and eventually coalesce via a burst of\ngravitational waves. So far theoretical models and simulations have been unable\nto predict directly the SMBH merger timescale from ab-initio galaxy formation\ntheory, focusing only on limited phases of the orbital decay of SMBHs under\nidealized conditions of the galaxy hosts. The predicted SMBH merger timescales\nare long, of order Gyrs, which could be problematic for future gravitational\nwave searches. Here we present the first multi-scale $\\Lambda$CDM cosmological\nsimulation that follows the orbital decay of a pair of SMBHs in a merger of two\ntypical massive galaxies at $z\\sim3$, all the way to the final coalescence\ndriven by gravitational wave emission. The two SMBHs, with masses $\\sim10^{8}$\nM$_{\\odot}$, settle quickly in the nucleus of the merger remnant. The remnant\nis triaxial and extremely dense due to the dissipative nature of the merger and\nthe intrinsic compactness of galaxies at high redshift. Such properties\nnaturally allow a very efficient hardening of the SMBH binary. The SMBH merger\noccurs in only $\\sim10$ Myr after the galactic cores have merged, which is two\norders of magnitude smaller than the Hubble time.\n", "  The AdS/CFT correspondence relates Wilson loops in N=4 SYM to minimal area\nsurfaces in $AdS_5\\times S^5$ space. Recently, a new approach to study minimal\narea surfaces in $AdS_3 \\subset AdS_5$ was discussed based on a Schroedinger\nequation with a periodic potential determined by the Schwarzian derivative of\nthe shape of the Wilson loop. Here we use the Mathieu equation, a standard\nexample of a periodic potential, to obtain a class of Wilson loops such that\nthe area of the dual minimal area surface can be computed analytically in terms\nof eigenvalues of such equation. As opposed to previous examples, these minimal\nsurfaces have an umbilical point (where the principal curvatures are equal) and\nare invariant under $\\lambda$-deformations. In various limits they reduce to\nthe single and multiple wound circular Wilson loop and to the regular\nlight-like polygons studied by Alday and Maldacena. In this last limit, the\nperiodic potential becomes a series of deep wells each related to a light-like\nsegment. Small corrections are described by a tight--binding approximation. In\nthe circular limit they are well approximated by an expansion developed by\nA.Dekel. In the particular case of no umbilical points they reduce to a\nprevious solution proposed by J. Toledo. The construction works both in\nEuclidean and Minkowski signature of $AdS_3$.\n", "  A first-order percolation transition, called explosive percolation, was\nrecently discovered in evolution networks with random edge selection under a\ncertain restriction. However, the network percolation with more realistic\nevolution mechanisms such as preferential attachment has not yet been\nconcerned. We propose a tunable network percolation model by introducing a\nhybrid mechanism of edge selection into the Bohman-Frieze-Wormald model, in\nwhich a parameter adjusts the relative weights between random and preferential\nselections. A large number of simulations indicate that there exist crossover\nphenomena of percolation transition by adjusting the parameter in the evolution\nprocesses. When the strategy of selecting a candidate edge is dominated by\nrandom selection, a single discontinuous percolation transition occurs. When a\ncandidate edge is selected more preferentially based on node's degree, the size\nof the largest component undergoes multiple discontinuous jumps, which exhibits\na peculiar difference from the network percolation of random selection with a\ncertain restriction. Besides, the percolation transition becomes continuous\nwhen the candidate edge is selected completely preferentially.\n", "  In \\cite{b-i-t}, F. Bagarello, A. Inoue and C. Trapani investigated some\noperators defined by Riesz bases. These operators connect with ${\\it\nquasi}$-${\\it hermitian \\; quantum \\; mechanics}$, and its relatives. In this\npaper, we change the frameworks of these operators, and then almost results\nobtained in \\cite{b-i-t} become trivial. Furthermore, we introduce a notion of\ngeneralized Riesz bases which is a generalization of Riesz bases and\ninvestigate some operators defined by generalized Riesz bases.\n", "  An error field (EF) detection technique using the amplitude modulation of a\nnaturally rotating tearing mode (TM) is developed and validated in the EXTRAP\nT2R reversed field pinch. The technique was used to identify intrinsic EFs of\n$m/n = 1/-12$, where $m$ and $n$ are the poloidal and toroidal mode numbers.\nThe effect of the EF and of a resonant magnetic perturbation (RMP) on the TM,\nin particular on amplitude modulation, is modeled with a first-order solution\nof the Modified Rutherford Equation. In the experiment, the TM amplitude is\nmeasured as a function of the toroidal angle as the TM rotates rapidly in the\npresence of an unknown EF and a known, deliberately applied RMP. The RMP\namplitude is fixed while the toroidal phase is varied from one discharge to the\nother, completing a full toroidal scan. Using three such scans with different\nRMP amplitudes, the EF amplitude and phase are inferred from the phases at\nwhich the TM amplitude maximizes. The estimated EF amplitude is consistent with\nother estimates (e.g. based on the best EF-cancelling RMP, resulting in the\nfastest TM rotation). A passive variant of this technique is also presented,\nwhere no RMPs are applied, and the EF phase is deduced.\n", "  It is not fully understood how electromagnetic waves propagate through plasma\ndensity fluctuations when the size of the fluctuations is comparable with the\nwavelength of the incident radiation. In this paper, the perturbing effect of a\nturbulent plasma density layer on a traversing microwave beam is simulated with\nfull-wave simulations. The deterioration of the microwave beam is calculated as\na function of the characteristic turbulence structure size, the turbulence\namplitude, the depth of the interaction zone and the size of the waist of the\nincident beam. The maximum scattering is observed for a structure size on the\norder of half the vacuum wavelength. The scattering and beam broadening was\nfound to increase linearly with the depth of the turbulence layer and\nquadratically with the fluctuation strength. Consequences for experiments and\n3D effects are considered.\n", "  We study the evolution of the universal area law of entanglement entropy when\nthe Hamiltonian of the system undergoes a time dependent perturbation. In\nparticular, we derive a general formula for the time dependent first order\ncorrection to the area law under the assumption that the field theory resides\nin a vacuum state when a small time-dependent perturbation of a relevant\ncoupling constant is turned on. Using this formula, we carry out explicit\ncalculations in free field theories deformed by a time dependent mass, whereas\nfor a generic QFT we show that the time dependent first order correction is\ngoverned by the spectral function defining the two-point correlation function\nof the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. We also carry out holographic\ncalculations based on the HRT proposal and find qualitative and, in certain\ncases, quantitative agreement with the field theory calculations.\n", "  Co/BaTiO$_3$(001) is one of the most interesting multiferroic\nheterostructures as it combines different ferroic phases, setting this way the\nfundamentals for innovative technical applications. Various theoretical\napproaches have been applied to investigate the electronic and magnetic\nproperties of Co/BaTiO$_3$(001). Here we determine the magnetic properties of 3\nML Co/BaTiO$_3$ by calculating spin-polarized electron diffraction as well as\nangle-resolved photoemission spectra, with both methods being well established\nas surface sensitive techniques. Furthermore, we discuss the impact of altering\nthe BaTiO$_3$ polarization on the spectra and ascribe the observed changes to\ncharacteristic details of the electronic structure.\n", "  Electromagnetic (EM) wave detection over a large spectrum has recently\nattracted significant amount of attention. Traditional electronic EM wave\nsensors use large metallic probes which distort the field to be measured and\nalso have strict limitations on the detectable RF bandwidth. To address these\nproblems, integrated photonic EM wave sensors have been developed to provide\nhigh sensitivity and broad bandwidth. Previously we demonstrated a compact,\nbroadband, and sensitive integrated photonic EM wave sensor, consisting of an\norganic electro-optic (EO) polymer refilled silicon slot photonic crystal\nwaveguide (PCW) modulator integrated with a gold bowtie antenna, to detect the\nX band of the electromagnetic spectrum. However, due to the relative large RC\nconstant of the silicon PCW, such EM wave sensors can only work up to tens of\nGHz. In this work, we present a detailed design and discussion of a new\ngeneration of EM wave sensors based on EO polymer refilled plasmonic slot\nwaveguides in conjunction with bowtie antennas to cover a wider electromagnetic\nspectrum from 1 GHz up to 10THz, including the range of microwave, millimeter\nwave and even terahertz waves. This antenna-coupled plasmonic-organic hybrid\n(POH) structure is designed to provide an ultra-small RC constant, a large\noverlap between plasmonic mode and RF field, and strong electric field\nenhancement, as well as negligible field perturbation. A taper is designed to\nbridge silicon strip waveguide to plasmonic slot waveguide. Simulation results\nshow that our device can have an EM wave sensing ability up to 10 THz. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this is the first POH device for photonic terahertz wave\ndetection.\n", "  We report linearly polarized continuum emission properties of Sgr A* at\n$\\sim$492 GHz, based on the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations.\nWe used the observations of the likely unpolarized continuum emission of Titan,\nand the observations of C\\textsc{i} line emission, to gauge the degree of\nspurious polarization. The Stokes I flux of 3.6$\\pm$0.72 Jy during our run is\nconsistent with extrapolations from the previous, lower frequency observations.\nWe found that the continuum emission of Sgr A* at $\\sim$492 GHz shows large\namplitude differences between the XX and the YY correlations. The observed\nintensity ratio between the XX and YY correlations as a function of parallactic\nangle may be explained by a constant polarization position angle of\n$\\sim$158$^{\\circ}$$\\pm$3$^{\\circ}$. The fitted polarization percentage of Sgr\nA* during our observational period is 14\\%$\\pm$1.2\\%. The calibrator quasar\nJ1744-3116 we observed at the same night can be fitted to Stokes I = 252 mJy,\nwith 7.9\\%$\\pm$0.9\\% polarization in position angle P.A. =\n4.1$^{\\circ}$$\\pm$4.2$^{\\circ}$. The observed polarization percentage and\npolarization position angle in the present work appear consistent with those\nexpected from longer wavelength observations in the period of 1999-2005. In\nparticular, the polarization position angle at 492 GHz, expected from the\npreviously fitted 167$^{\\circ}$$\\pm$7$^{\\circ}$ intrinsic polarization position\nangle and (-5.6$\\pm$0.7)$\\times$10$^{5}$ rotation measure, is 155$^{+9}_{-8}$,\nwhich is consistent with our new measurement of polarization position angle\nwithin 1$\\sigma$. The polarization percentage and the polarization position\nangle may be varying over the period of our ALMA 12m Array observations, which\ndemands further investigation with future polarization observations.\n", "  An accurate and fast fiber transfer delay measurement method is demonstrated.\nAs a key technique, a simple ambiguity resolving process based on phase\ndiscrimination and frequency measurement is used to overcome the contradiction\nbetween measurement accuracy and system complexity. The optimized system\nachieves a high accuracy of 0.3 ps with a 0.1 ps resolution, and a large\ndynamic range up to 50 km as well as no dead zone.\n", "  In this paper, we study the recent 750 GeV diphoton excess in the Hill Model\nwith vector-like fermions, in which the singlet-like Higgs boson is chosen as\n750 GeV resonance and is mainly produced by the gluon fusion through\nvector-like top and bottom quarks. Meanwhile its diphoton decay rate is greatly\nenhanced by the vector-like lepton. Under the current experimental and\ntheoretical constraints, we present the viable parameter space that fits the\n750 GeV diphoton signal strength at 13 TeV LHC. We find that the heavier\nvector-like fermion masses are, the smaller mixing angle $\\theta$ is required.\nThe mixing angle of singlet and doublet Higgs bosons is constrained within\n$|\\sin\\theta| \\lesssim 0.15$ in the condition of the perturbative Yukawa\ncouplings. In the allowed parameter space, the 750 GeV diphoton cross section\ncan be maximally enhanced to about 6 fb at 13 TeV LHC.\n", "  The recently discovered object Triangulum II appears to be an ultra faint\ndwarf spheroidal galaxy which may be one of the most dark matter dominated\nobjects yet known. In this work we try to estimate the potential of this object\nfor studies of the indirect detection of self-annihilating dark matter by\nobtaining its astrophysical J-factor. We perform a basic estimate of the\nvelocity gradient to look for signs of the halo being tidally disrupted but\nshow that the observed value is statistically compatible with zero velocity\ngradient. We solve the spherical Jeans equation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo\n(MCMC) engine GreAT and the Jeans analysis part of the CLUMPY package. We find\nthe results point towards a very large J-factor, appearing to make Triangulum\nII one of the best targets in the search for dark matter. However we stress\nthat the very small number of line of sight velocities currently available for\nthis object make follow up studies essential.\n", "  We present two pulse schemes for actively depleting measurement photons from\na readout resonator in the nonlinear dispersive regime of circuit QED. One\nmethod uses digital feedback conditioned on the measurement outcome while the\nother is unconditional. In the absence of analytic forms and symmetries to\nexploit in this nonlinear regime, the depletion pulses are numerically\noptimized using the Powell method. We shorten the photon depletion time by more\nthan six inverse resonator linewidths compared to passive depletion by waiting.\nWe quantify the benefit by emulating an ancilla qubit performing repeated\nquantum parity checks in a repetition code. Fast depletion increases the mean\nnumber of cycles to a spurious error detection event from order 1 to 75 at a 1\nmicrosecond cycle time.\n", "  Characterizing inhomogeneous temporal patterns in natural and social\nphenomena is important to understand underlying mechanisms behind such complex\nsystems, hence even to predict and control them. Temporal inhomogeneities in\nevent sequences have been described in terms of bursts that are rapidly\noccurring events in short time periods alternating with long inactive periods.\nThe bursts can be quantified by a simple measure, called burstiness parameter,\nwhich was introduced by Goh and Barab\\'asi [EPL \\textbf{81}, 48002 (2008)]. The\nburstiness parameter has been widely used due to its simplicity, which however\nturns out to be strongly affected by the finite number of events in the time\nseries. As the finite-size effects on burstiness parameter have been largely\nignored, we analytically investigate the finite-size effects of the burstiness\nparameter. Then we suggest an alternative definition of burstiness that is free\nfrom finite-size effects and yet simple. Using our alternative burstiness\nmeasure, one can distinguish the finite-size effects from the intrinsic bursty\nproperties in the time series. We also demonstrate the advantages of our\nburstiness measure by analyzing empirical datasets.\n", "  We study the fundamental physics of cascades and spectra in 2D\nCahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) turbulence, and compare and contrast this\nsystem with 2D MagnetoHydroDynamic (MHD) turbulence. The important similarities\ninclude basic equations, ideal quadratic invariants, cascades and the role of\nlinear elastic waves. Surface tension induces elasticity, and the balance\nbetween surface tension energy and turbulent kinetic energy determines a length\nscale (Hinze scale) of the system. The Hinze scale may be thought of as the\nscale of emergent critical balance between fluid straining and elastic\nrestoring forces. The scales between the Hinze scale and dissipation scale\nconstitute the elastic range of the 2D CHNS system. By direct numerical\nsimulation, we find that in the elastic range, the mean square concentration\nspectrum $H^\\psi_k$ of the 2D CHNS system exhibits the same power law ($-7/3$)\nas the mean square magnetic potential spectrum $H^A_k$ in the inverse cascade\nregime of 2D MHD. This power law is consistent with an inverse cascade of\n$H^\\psi$, which is observed. The kinetic energy spectrum of the 2D CHNS system\nis $E^K_k\\sim k^{-3}$ if forced at large scale, suggestive of the direct\nenstrophy cascade power law of 2D Navier-Stokes (NS) turbulence. The difference\nfrom the energy spectra of 2D MHD turbulence implies that the back reaction of\nthe concentration field to fluid motion is limited. We suggest this is because\nthe surface tension back reaction is significant only in the interfacial\nregions. The interfacial regions fill only a small portion of the 2D CHNS\nsystem, and their interface packing fraction is much smaller than that for 2D\nMHD.\n", "  We consider the 2D Navier-Stokes equation on $\\mathbb T \\times \\mathbb R$,\nwith initial datum that is $\\varepsilon$-close in $H^N$ to a shear flow\n$(U(y),0)$, where $\\| U(y) - y\\|_{H^{N+4}} \\ll 1$ and $N>1$. We prove that if\n$\\varepsilon \\ll \\nu^{1/2}$, where $\\nu$ denotes the inverse Reynolds number,\nthen the solution of the Navier-Stokes equation remains $\\varepsilon$-close in\n$H^1$ to $(e^{t \\nu \\partial_{yy}}U(y),0)$ for all $t>0$. Moreover, the\nsolution converges to a decaying shear flow for times $t \\gg \\nu^{-1/3}$ by a\nmixing-enhanced dissipation effect, and experiences a transient growth of\ngradients. In particular, this shows that the stability threshold in finite\nregularity scales no worse than $\\nu^{1/2}$ for 2D shear flows close to the\nCouette flow.\n", "  In this paper we introduce a general theory of regular biorthogonal sequences\nand its physical applications. Biorthogonal sequences $\\{ \\phi_{n} \\}$ and $\\{\n\\psi_{n} \\}$ in a Hilbert space ${\\cal H}$ are said to be regular if $Span\\; \\{\n\\phi_{n} \\}$ and $Span\\; \\{ \\psi_{n} \\}$ are dense in ${\\cal H}$. The first\npurpose is to show that there exists a non-singular positive self-adjoint\noperator $T_{\\mbox{$f$}}$ in ${\\cal H}$ defined by an ONB $\\mbox{$f$} \\equiv \\{\nf_{n} \\}$ in ${\\cal H}$ such that $\\phi_{n}=T_{\\mbox{$f$}} f_{n}$ and\n$\\psi_{n}= T_{\\mbox{$f$}}^{-1} f_{n}$, $n=0,1, \\cdots$, and such an ONB\n$\\mbox{$f$}$ is unique. The second purpose is to define and study the lowering\noperators $A_{\\mbox{$f$}}$ and $B_{\\mbox{$f$}}^{\\dagger}$, the raising\noperators $B_{\\mbox{$f$}}$ and $A_{\\mbox{$f$}}^{\\dagger}$, the number operators\n$N_{\\mbox{$f$}}$ and $N_{\\mbox{$f$}}^{\\dagger}$ determined by the non-singular\npositive self-adjoint operator $T_{\\mbox{$f$}}$. These operators connect with\n${\\it quasi}$-${\\it hermitian \\; quantum \\; mechanics}$ and its relatives. This\npaper clarifies and simplifies the mathematical structure of this framework\nminimized the required assumptions.\n", "  Uncertain recognition success, unfavorable scaling of connection complexity\nor dependence on complex external input impair the usefulness of current\noscillatory neural networks for pattern recognition or restrict technical\nrealizations to small networks. We propose a new network architecture of\ncoupled oscillators for pattern recognition which shows none of the mentioned\naws. Furthermore we illustrate the recognition process with simulation results\nand analyze the new dynamics analytically: Possible output patterns are\nisolated attractors of the system. Additionally, simple criteria for\nrecognition success are derived from a lower bound on the basins of attraction.\n", "  Drawing upon the bursting mechanism in slow-fast systems, we propose\nindicators for the prediction of such rare extreme events which do not require\na priori known slow and fast coordinates. The indicators are associated with\nfunctionals defined in terms of Optimally Time Dependent (OTD) modes. One such\nfunctional has the form of the largest eigenvalue of the symmetric part of the\nlinearized dynamics reduced to these modes. In contrast to other choices of\nsubspaces, the proposed modes are flow invariant and therefore a projection\nonto them is dynamically meaningful. We illustrate the application of these\nindicators on three examples: a prototype low-dimensional model, a body forced\nturbulent fluid flow, and a unidirectional model of nonlinear water waves. We\nuse Bayesian statistics to quantify the predictive power of the proposed\nindicators.\n", "  Motivated by the recently improved lattice QCD results on the hadronic matrix\nelements entering $\\Delta M_{s,d}$ in $B_{s,d}^0-\\bar B_{s,d}^0$ mixings and\nthe resulting increased tensions between $\\Delta M_{s,d}$ and $\\varepsilon_K$\nin the Standard Model and CMFV models, we demonstrate that these tensions can\nbe removed in 331 models based on the gauge group $SU(3)_C\\times SU(3)_L\\times\nU(1)_X$ both for $M_{Z^\\prime}$ in the LHC reach and well beyond it. But the\nimplied new physics (NP) patterns in $\\Delta F=1$ observables depend\nsensitively on the value of $|V_{cb}|$. Concentrating the analysis on three 331\nmodels that have been selected by us previously on the basis of their\nperformance in electroweak precision tests and $\\varepsilon^\\prime/\\varepsilon$\nwe illustrate this for $|V_{cb}|=0.042$ and $|V_{cb}|=0.040$. We find that\nthese new lattice data still allow for positive shifts in\n$\\varepsilon^\\prime/\\varepsilon$ up to $6\\times 10^{-4}$ for\n  $M_{Z^\\prime}=3~TeV$ for both values of $$|V_{cb}|$ but for\n$M_{Z^\\prime}=10~TeV$ only for $|V_{cb}|=0.040$ such shifts can be obtained. NP\neffects in $B_s\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-$ and in the Wilson coefficient $C_9$ are\nsignificantly larger in all three models for the case of $|V_{cb}|=0.040$. In\nparticular in two models the rate for $B_s\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-$ can be reduced by NP\nby $20\\%$ for $M_{Z^\\prime}=3~TeV$ resulting in values in the ballpark of\ncentral values from CMS and LHCb. In the third model a shift in $C_9$ up to\n$C_9^\\text{NP}=-0.5$ is possible. We also consider the simplest 331 model,\nanalyzed recently in the literature, in which $X=Y$, the usual hypercharge. We\nfind that in this model NP effects in flavour observables are much smaller than\nin the three models with $X\\not=Y$, in particular NP contributions to the ratio\n  $\\varepsilon^\\prime/\\varepsilon$ are very strongly suppressed.\n", "  In this paper, we solved numerically the Quantum Spectral Curve (QSC)\nequations corresponding to some twist-2 single trace operators with even spin\nfrom the $sl(2)$ sector of $AdS_5/CFT_4$ correspondence. We describe all\ntechnical details of the numerical method which are necessary to implement it\nin C++ language.\n  In the $S=2,4,6,8$ cases, our numerical results confirm the analytical\nresults, known in the literature for the first 4 coefficients of the strong\ncoupling expansion for the anomalous dimensions of twist-2 operators. In the\ncase of the Konishi operator, due to the high precision of the numerical data\nwe could give numerical predictions to the values of two further coefficients,\nas well.\n  The strong coupling behaviour of the coefficients $c_{a,n}$ in the power\nseries representation of the ${\\bf P}_{\\!a}$-functions is also investigated.\nBased on our numerical data, in the regime, where the index of the coefficients\nis much smaller than $\\lambda^{1/4}$, we conjecture that the coefficients have\npolynomial index dependence at strong coupling. This allows one to propose a\nstrong coupling series representation for the ${\\bf P}$-functions being valid\nfar enough from the real short cut. In the paper the qualitative strong\ncoupling behaviour of the ${\\bf P}$-functions at the branch points is also\ndiscussed.\n", "  By using a physically-relevant and theory independent definition of\nmeasurement-based equilibration, we show quantitatively that equilibration is\neasier for quantum systems than for classical systems, in the situation where\nthe initial state of the system is completely known (pure state). This shows\nthat quantum equilibration is a fundamental, nigh unavoidable, aspect of\nphysical systems, while classical equilibration relies on experimental\nignorance. When the state is not completely known, a mixed state, this\nframework also shows quantum equilibration requires weaker conditions.\n", "  We report angle-resolved photoemission experiments resolving the distinct\nelectronic structure of the inequivalent top and bottom (001) surfaces of WTe2.\nOn both surfaces, we identify a surface state that forms a large Fermi-arc\nemerging out of the bulk electron pocket. Using surface electronic structure\ncalculations, we show that these Fermi arcs are topologically trivial and that\ntheir existence is independent of the presence of type-II Weyl points in the\nbulk band structure. This implies that the observation of surface Fermi arcs\nalone does not allow the identification of WTe2 as a topological Weyl\nsemimetal. We further use the identification of the two different surfaces to\nclarify the number of Fermi surface sheets in WTe2.\n", "  Recently, a general result for evaluating the path integral at one loop was\nobtained in the form of the Universal One-Loop Effective Action. It may be used\nto derive effective field theory operators of dimensions up to six, by\nevaluating the traces of matrices in this expression, with the mass-dependence\nencapsulated in the universal coefficients. Here we show that it can account\nfor loops of mixed heavy-light particles in the matching procedure. Our\nprescription for computing these mixed contributions to the Wilson coefficients\nis conceptually simple. Moreover it has the advantage of maintaining the\nuniversal structure of the effective action, which we illustrate using the\nexample of integrating out a heavy electroweak triplet scalar coupling to a\nlight Higgs doublet. Finally we also identify new structures that were\npreviously neglected in the universal results.\n", "  In epidemiological modelling, dynamics on networks, and in particular\nadaptive and heterogeneous networks have recently received much interest. Here\nwe present a detailed analysis of a previously proposed model that combines\nheterogeneity in the individuals with adaptive rewiring of the network\nstructure in response to a disease. We show that in this model qualitative\nchanges in the dynamics occur in two phase transitions. In a macroscopic\ndescription one of these corresponds to a local bifurcation whereas the other\none corresponds to a non-local heteroclinic bifurcation. This model thus\nprovides a rare example of a system where a phase transition is caused by a\nnon-local bifurcation, while both micro- and macro-level dynamics are\naccessible to mathematical analysis. The bifurcation points mark the onset of a\nbehaviour that we call network inoculation. In the respective parameter region\nexposure of the system to a pathogen will lead to an outbreak that collapses,\nbut leaves the network in a configuration where the disease cannot reinvade,\ndespite every agent returning to the susceptible class. We argue that this\nbehaviour and the associated phase transitions can be expected to occur in a\nwide class of models of sufficient complexity.\n", "  The Beijing Spectrometer III (BESIII) endcap Time-Of-Filght (ETOF) was\nproposed to upgrade with Multigap Resistive Plate Chamber (MRPC) technology to\nsubstitute the current ETOF of scintillator+PMT for extending time resolutin\nbetter than 80 ps and enhance the particle identification capability to satisfy\nthe higher precision requirement of physics. The ETOF system including MRPC\nmodules, front end electronics (FEE), CLOCK module, fast control boards and\ntime to digital modules (TDIG), has been designed, constructed and done some\nexperimental tests seperately. Aiming at examining the quality of entire ETOF\nsystem and training the operation of all participated parts, a cosmic ray test\nsystem was built at the laboratory and underwent about three months to\nguarantee performance. In this paper the results will be presented indicating\nthat the entire ETOF system works well and satisfies the requirements of the\nupgrade.\n", "  We employ \\textit{ab initio} calculations to investigate energetics of point\ndefects in metastable rocksalt cubic Ta-N and Mo-N. Our results reveal a strong\ntendency to off-stoichiometry, i.e. defected structures are predicted to be\nmore stable than perfect ones with 1:1 metal-to-nitrogen stoichiometry, in\nagreement with previous literature reports. While Ta-N significantly favours\nmetal vacancies, Mo-N exhibits similar energies of formation regardless of the\nvacancy type ($V_\\text{Mo}$, $V_\\text{N}$) as long as their concentration is\nbelow $\\approx15\\,\\text{at.\\%}$. The overall lowest energy of formation were\nobtained for $\\text{Ta}_{0.78}\\text{N}$ and $\\text{Mo}_{0.91}\\text{N}$, which\nare hence predicted to be the most stable compositions. To account for various\nexperimental condition during synthesis, we further evaluated the phase\nstability as a function of chemical potential of individual species. The\nproposed phase diagrams reveal four stable compositions,\n$\\text{Mo}_{0.84}\\text{N}$, $\\text{Mo}_{0.91}\\text{N}$, $\\text{MoN}_{0.69}$ and\n$\\text{MoN}_{0.44}$, in the case of Mo-N and nine stable compositions in the\ncase of Ta-N indicating the crucial role of metal under-stoichiometry, since\n$\\text{Ta}_{0.75}\\text{N}$ and $\\text{Ta}_{0.78}\\text{N}$ significantly\ndominate the diagram. These results are important for understanding and\ndesigning experiments using non-equilibrium deposition techniques. Finally, we\ndiscuss a role of defects ordering and estimate a cubic lattice parameter as a\nfunction of a defect contents.\n", "  The dipolar interaction is known to substantially affect the properties of\nmagnetic nanoparticles. This is particularly important when the particles are\nkept in a fluid suspension or packed inside nano-carriers. In addition to its\nusual long-range nature, in these cases the dipolar interaction may also induce\nthe formation of clusters of particles, thereby strongly modifying their\nmagnetic anisotropies. In this paper we show how AC susceptibility may be used\nto obtain important information regarding the influence of the dipolar\ninteraction in a sample. We develop a model which includes both aspects of the\ndipolar interaction and may be fitted directly to the susceptibility data. The\nusual long-range nature of the interaction is implemented using a mean-field\nsolution, whereas the particle-particle aggregation is modeled using a\ndistribution of anisotropy constants. The model is then applied to two samples\nstudied at different concentrations. One consists of spherical magnetite\nnanoparticles dispersed in oil and the other of cubic magnetite nanoparticles\nembedded on PLGA nanospheres. We also introduce a simple technique to access\nthe importance of the dipolar interaction in a given sample, based on the\nheight of the AC susceptibility peaks for different driving frequencies. Our\nresults help illustrate the important effect that the dipolar interaction has\nin most nanoparticle samples.\n", "  We study the effect of disorder on the particle density evolution in a\nclassical Hamiltonian driven lattice setup. If the disorder is localized within\na finite sub-domain of the lattice, the emergence of strong tails in the\ndensity distribution which even increases towards larger positions is shown,\nthus yielding a highly non Gaussian particle density evolution. As the key\nunderlying mechanism we identify the conversion between different components of\nthe unperturbed systems mixed phase space which is induced by the disorder.\nBased on the introduction of individual conversion rates between chaotic and\nregular components, a theoretical model is developed which correctly predicts\nthe scaling of the particle density. The effect of disorder on the transport\nproperties is studied where a significant enhancement of the transport for\ncases of localized disorder is shown, thereby contrasting strongly the merely\nweak modification of transport for global disorder.\n", "  We demonstrate that current-current correlations (in particular the shot\nnoise), can be used to study the intrinsic superconductivity in a slightly\ndoped Weyl semi-metal. The systems studied is an N-WS tunneling junction where\nthe left electrode is a normal metal while the right electrode is a Weyl\nsuperconductor (WS).\n  The superconductivity supports surface state with crossed flat bands thereby\nimpact the low energy spectrum.\n  This spectrum displays a modified density of states in the gap region that\nstrongly affects transport characteristics of the N-WS junction. The Fano\nfactor is calculated as function of the applied bias, and shown to be dependent\nessentially on the orientation of the surface of WS relative to the tunneling\ndirection. If this orientation supports the occurrence of low energy state,\nthen the shot noise power decreases with decreasing voltage, a property similar\nto that prevailing in a junction with Majorana bound state.\n", "  Many powerful and variable gamma-ray sources, including pulsar wind nebulae,\nactive galactic nuclei and gamma-ray bursts, seem capable of accelerating\nparticles to gamma-ray emitting energies efficiently over very short time\nscales. These are likely due to rapid dissipation of electromagnetic energy in\na highly magnetized, relativistic plasma. In order to understand the generic\nfeatures of such processes, we have investigated simple models based on\nrelaxation of unstable force-free magnetostatic equilibria. In this work, we\nmake the connection between the corresponding plasma dynamics and the expected\nradiation signal, using 2D particle-in-cell simulations that self-consistently\ninclude synchrotron radiation reaction. We focus on the lowest order unstable\nforce-free equilibrium in a 2D periodic box. We find that rapid variability,\nwith modest apparent radiation efficiency as perceived by a fixed observer, can\nbe produced during the evolution of the instability. The \"flares\" are\naccompanied by an increased polarization degree in the high energy band, with\nrapid variation in the polarization angle. Furthermore, the separation between\nthe acceleration sites and the synchrotron radiation sites for the highest\nenergy particles facilitates acceleration beyond the synchrotron radiation\nreaction limit. We also discuss the dynamical consequences of radiation\nreaction, and some astrophysical applications of this model. Our current\nsimulations with numerically tractable parameters are not yet able to reproduce\nthe most dramatic gamma-ray flares, e.g., from Crab Nebula. Higher\nmagnetization studies are promising and will be carried out in the future.\n", "  Using the China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS) linac as the injector, a 500\nMeV proton synchrotron is proposed for multidisciplinary application, such as\nbiology, material and proton therapy. The synchrotron will deliver proton beam\nwith energy from 80 MeV to 500 MeV. A compact lattice design was worked out,\nand all the important beam dynamics issues were investigated. The 80 MeV H-\nbeam is stripped and injected into the synchrotron by using multi-turn\ninjection. In order to continuously extraction the proton with small beam loss,\nthe achromatic structure is proposed and slow extraction method with RF\nknock-out is adopted and optimized.\n", "  Bremsstrahlung radiation emission is an important energy loss mechanism for\nenergetic electrons in plasmas. In this paper we investigate the effect of\nspontaneous bremsstrahlung emission on the momentum-space structure of the\nelectron distribution, fully accounting for the emission of finite-energy\nphotons. We find that electrons accelerated by electric fields can reach\nsignificantly higher energies than what is expected from energy-loss\nconsiderations. Furthermore, we show that the emission of soft photons can\ncontribute significantly to the dynamics of electrons with an anisotropic\ndistribution.\n", "  Mrk 231 is a nearby quasar with an unusually red near-UV-to-optical\ncontinuum, generally explained as heavy reddening by dust (e.g., Leighly et al.\n2014). Yan et al. 2015 proposed that Mrk~231 is a milli-parsec black-hole\nbinary with little intrinsic reddening. We show that if the observed FUV\ncontinuum is intrinsic, as assumed by Yan et al. 2015, it fails by a factor of\nabout 100 in powering the observed strength of the near-infrared emission\nlines, and the thermal near and mid-infrared continuum. In contrast, the line\nand continuum strengths are typical for a reddened AGN spectral energy\ndistribution. We find that the HeI*/Pbeta ratio is sensitive to the spectral\nenergy distribution for a one-zone model. If this sensitivity is maintained in\ngeneral broad-line region models, then this ratio may prove a useful diagnostic\nfor heavily reddened quasars. Analysis of archival HST STIS and FOC data\nrevealed evidence that the far-UV continuum emission is resolved on size scales\nof ~40 parsecs. The lack of broad absorption lines in the far-UV continuum\nmight be explained if it were not coincident with the central engine. One\npossibility is that it is the central engine continuum reflected from the\nreceding wind on the far side of the quasar.\n", "  If cosmic inflation suffered tiny time-dependent deviations from the\nslow-roll regime, these would induce the existence of small scale-dependent\nfeatures imprinted in the primordial spectra, with their shapes and sizes\nrevealing information about the physics that produced them. Small sharp\nfeatures could be suppressed at the level of the two-point correlation\nfunction, making them undetectable in the power spectrum, but could be\namplified at the level of the three-point correlation function, offering us a\nwindow of opportunity to uncover them in the non-Gaussian bispectrum. In this\narticle, we show that sharp features may be analyzed using only data coming\nfrom the three point correlation function parametrizing primordial\nnon-Gaussianity. More precisely, we show that if features appear in a\nparticular non-Gaussian triangle configuration (e.g. equilateral, folded,\nsqueezed), these must reappear in every other configuration according to a\nspecific relation allowing us to correlate features across the non-Gaussian\nbispectrum. As a result, we offer a method to study scale-dependent features\ngenerated during inflation that depends only on data coming from measurements\nof non-Gaussianity, allowing us to omit data from the power spectrum.\n", "  Using the F-theory realization, we identify a subclass of 6d (1,0) SCFTs\nwhose compactification on a Riemann surface leads to N = 1 4d SCFTs where the\nmoduli space of the Riemann surface is part of the moduli space of the theory.\nIn particular we argue that for a special case of these theories (dual to M5\nbranes probing ADE singularities), we obtain 4d N = 1 theories whose space of\nmarginal deformations is given by the moduli space of flat ADE connections on a\nRiemann surface.\n", "  We present a classical, mesoscopic derivation of the Fokker-Planck equation\nfor diffusion in an expanding medium. To this end, we take a conveniently\ngeneralized Chapman-Kolmogorov equation as the starting point. We obtain an\nanalytical expression for the Green's function (propagator) and investigate\nboth analytically and numerically how this function and the associated moments\nbehave. We also study first-passage properties in expanding hyperspherical\ngeometries. We show that in all cases the behavior is determined to a great\nextent by the so-called Brownian conformal time $\\tau(t)$, which we define via\nthe relation $\\dot \\tau=1/a^2$, where $a(t)$ is the expansion scale factor. If\nthe medium expansion is driven by a power law [$a(t) \\propto t^\\gamma$ with\n$\\gamma>0$], we find interesting crossover effects in the mixing effectiveness\nof the diffusion process when the characteristic exponent $\\gamma$ is varied.\nCrossover effects are also found at the level of the survival probability and\nof the moments of the first passage-time distribution with two different\nregimes separated by the critical value $\\gamma=1/2$. The case of an\nexponential scale factor is analyzed separately both for expanding and\ncontracting media. In the latter situation, a stationary probability\ndistribution arises in the long time limit.\n", "  In peripheral heavy ion collisions, the Quark-Gluon Plasma that may be formed\noften has a large angular momentum per unit energy. This angular momentum may\ntake the form of (local) rotation. In many physical systems, rotation can have\neffects analogous to those produced by a magnetic field; thus, there is a risk\nthat the effects of local rotation in the QGP might be mistaken for those of\nthe large genuine magnetic fields which are also known to arise in these\nsystems. Here we use the gauge-gravity duality to investigate this, and we find\nindeed that, with realistic parameter values, local rotation has effects on the\nQGP (at high values of the baryonic chemical potential) which are not only of\nthe same kind as those produced by magnetic fields, but which can in fact be\nsubstantially larger. Furthermore, the combined effect of rotation and\nmagnetism is to change the shape of the main quark matter phase transition line\nin an interesting way, reducing the magnitude of its curvature; again, local\nrotation contributes to this phenomenon at least as strongly as magnetism.\n", "  We study a quantum quench of an integrable quantum field theory in the planar\ninfinite-$N$ limit. Unlike isovector-valued $O(N)$ models, matrix-valued field\ntheories in the infinite-$N$ limit are not solvable by the Hartre-Fock\napproximation, and are nontrivial interacting theories. We study quenches with\ninitial states that are color-charge neutral, correspond to\nintegrability-preserving boundary conditions, and that lead to nontrivial\ncorrelation functions of operators. We compute exactly at infinite $N$, the\ntime-dependent one- and two-point correlation functions of the energy-momentum\ntensor and renormalized field operator after this quench using known exact form\nfactors. This computation can be done fully analytically, due the simplicity of\nthe initial state and the form factors in the planar limit. We also show that\nthis type of quench preserves factorizability at all times, allows for particle\ntransmission from the pre-quench state, while still having nontrivial\ninteracting post-quench dynamics.\n", "  We formulate a bulk spectroscopic method for direct measurement of the\ntopological invariant of nondegenerate band crossings in Weyl semimetals. We\ndemonstrate how polarization-resolved resonant x-ray scattering captures the\nwinding of the Berry flux around Weyl nodes. The spectra obtained by the\nproposed strategy feature an integer number of zero-crossings that is directly\nrelated to the topological charge of the measured nodes. We benchmark the\nproposed protocol on TaAs, using realistic low-energy models derived from\ndensity-functional theory to accurately represent the states close to the Fermi\nlevel, including sizable deviations from the idealized linear dispersion. We\nconclude that the proposed measurement, which is within the reach of current\nexperimental setups, yields direct signatures of nontrivial band topology in\nspectroscopy of three-dimensional bulk matter.\n", "  We present a model of power law inflation generated by variation of the\nstrong coupling constant. We then extend the model to two varying coupling\nconstants which leads to a potential consisting of a linear combination of\nexponential terms. Some variants of the latter may be self-consistent and can\naccommodate the experimental data of the Planck 2015 and other recent\nexperiments.\n", "  Topological insulator is a new state of matter which exhibits exotic surface\nelectronic properties. Determining the spin texture of this class of material\nis of paramount importance for understanding its topological order and can lead\nto potential applications in spintronics. Here, we have investigated the nature\nof the surface state of the topological insulator with hexagonal warping\nsubjected to an off-resonant circularly polarized light. The resulting\nelectronic ground state exhibits a novel feature of spin texture breaking the\nconventional spin-momentum locking present on a topological insulator surface.\nThe observed spin texture is shown to be a consequence of the symmetry group of\nthe underlying crystal. The generalisation of our method to the other 2D\ngraphene-like systems are straightforward. Our calculation charts a simple\nexperimental route for a realisation of the non-trivial spin-textures.\n", "  Multilevel autonomous quantum thermal machines are discussed. In particular,\nwe explore the relation between the size of the machine (captured by Hilbert\nspace dimension), and the performance of the machine. Using the concepts of\nvirtual qubits and virtual temperatures, we show that higher dimensional\nmachines can outperform smaller ones. For instance, by considering\nrefrigerators with more levels, lower temperatures can be achieved, as well as\nhigher power. We discuss the optimal design for refrigerators of a given\ndimension. As a consequence we obtain a statement of the third law in terms of\nHilbert space dimension: reaching absolute zero temperature requires infinite\ndimension. These results demonstrate that Hilbert space dimension should be\nconsidered a thermodynamic resource.\n", "  Projective (Von Neumann) Measurement of an operator (i.e. a dynamical\nvariable) selected from a prescribed set of operators is termed unrecorded\nmeasurement (URM) when both the selected operator and the measurement outcome\nare unknown, i.e. \"lost\". Within classical physics a URM is completely\ninconsequential: the state is unaffected by measurement. Within quantum physics\na measurement leaves a mark. The present study provides protocols that allow\nretrieval of some of the data lost in a URM.\n", "  The modulation of band gap in the two-dimensional carbon materials is of\nimpor- tance for their applications as electronic devices. By first-principles\ncalculations, we propose a model to control the band gap size of\n{\\gamma}-graphyne. The model is named as p-n codoping, i. e., using B and N\natoms to codope into {\\gamma}-graphyne. After codoping, B atom plays a role of\np doping and N atom acts as n doping. The Fermi energy level returns around the\nforbidden zone and the band gap of {\\gamma}-graphyne vary bigger or smaller.\nMoreover, the gaps exhibit an oscillated behaviour in different codoping\nconfigurations. The proposed model serves as new insights for better modulation\nof the electronic properties of 2D carbon materials.\n", "  Leakage of diffuse polarized emission into Stokes I caused by the polarized\nprimary beam of the instrument might mimic the spectral structure of the 21-cm\nsignal coming from the epoch of reionization (EoR) making their separation\ndifficult. Therefore, understanding polarimetric performance of the antenna is\ncrucial for a successful detection of the EoR signal. Here, we have calculated\nthe accuracy of the nominal model beam of LOFAR in predicting the leakage from\nStokes I to Q, U by comparing them with the corresponding leakage of compact\nsources actually observed in the 3C295 field. We have found that the model beam\nhas errors of less than or equal to 10% on the predicted levels of leakage of\n~1% within the field of view, i. e. if the leakage is taken out perfectly using\nthis model the leakage will reduce to $10^{-3}$ of the Stokes I flux. If\nsimilar levels of accuracy can be obtained in removing leakage from Stokes Q, U\nto I, we can say, based on the results of our previous paper, that the removal\nof this leakage using this beam model would ensure that the leakage is well\nbelow the expected EoR signal in almost the whole instrumental k-space of the\ncylindrical power spectrum. We have also shown here that direction dependent\ncalibration can remove instrumentally polarized compact sources, given an\nunpolarized sky model, very close to the local noise level.\n", "  A major achievement of the past decade has been the realization of\nmacroscopic quantum systems by exploiting interactions between optical cavities\nand mechanical resonators. In these systems, phonons are coherently annihilated\nor created in exchange for photons. Similar phenomena have recently been\nobserved through \"phonon cavity\" coupling -- energy exchange between modes of a\nsingle system as mediated by intrinsic material nonlinearity. To date, this has\nbeen demonstrated primarily for bulk crystalline, high-quality-factor\n(Q>100,000) mechanical systems operated at cryogenic temperatures. Here we\npropose graphene as an ideal candidate for the study of such nonlinear\nmechanics. The large elastic modulus of this material and capability for\nspatial symmetry breaking via electrostatic forces is expected to generate a\nwealth of nonlinear phenomena, including tunable inter-modal coupling. We have\nfabricated circular graphene membranes and report strong phonon cavity effects\nat room temperature, despite the modest Q (~100) of this system. We observe\nboth amplification into parametric instability (\"mechanical lasing\") and\ncooling of Brownian motion in the fundamental mode through excitation of cavity\nsidebands. Furthermore, we characterize quenching of these parametric effects\nat large vibrational amplitudes, offering a window on the all-mechanical\nanalogue of cavity optomechanics, where observation of such effects has proven\nelusive.\n", "  The confinement provided by a glass box is proving ideal for the formation of\nvertically aligned structures and a convenient method for controlling the\nnumber of dust particles comprising these dust structures, as well as their\nsize and shape. In this paper, the electronic confinement of the glass box is\nmapped and the particle interactions between the particle pairs inside the\nglass box are measured. The ion-wake field is shown to exist within the glass\nbox and its vertical and horizontal extent is measured.\n", "  An unconventional type of the Mott's insulators where the gap in the spectrum\nof single-particle excitations is associated with repulsive effective\ninteractions between quasiparticles is shown to exist in strongly correlated\nelectron systems of solids that possess flat bands. The occurrence of this gap\nis demonstrated to be the consequence of violation of particle-hole symmetry,\ninherent in such systems. The results obtained are applied to elucidate the\nFermi arc structure observed at temperatures up to $100\\,$ K in angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectra of the compound Sr$_2$IrO$_4$, not showing\nsuperconductivity down to low $T$.\n", "  We study the instability, for the supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theories,\ncaused by the external electric field through the imaginary part of the action\nof the D7 probe brane, which is embedded in the background of type IIB theory.\nThis instability is related to the Schwinger effect, namely to the quark pair\nproduction due to the external electric field, for the $SU(N_c)$ SYM theories.\nIn this holographic approach, it is possible to calculate the Schwinger effect\nfor various phases of the theories. Here we give the calculation for ${\\cal\nN}=2$ SYM theory and the analysis is extended to the finite temperature\ndeconfinement and the zero temperature confinement phases of the Yang-Mills\n(YM) theory. By comparing the obtained production rates with the one of the\nsupersymmetric case, the dynamical quark mass is estimated and we find how it\nvaries with the chiral condensate. Based on this analysis, we give a\nspeculation on the extension of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model to the finite\ntemperature YM theory, and four fermi coupling is evaluated in the confinement\ntheory.\n", "  We show that generalizations of general relativity theory, which consist in\nreplacing the Hilbert Lagrangian $L_{Hilbert} = \\frac 1{16\\pi} \\sqrt{|g|} R$ by\na generic scalar density $L=L(g_{\\mu\\nu}, R^\\lambda_{\\mu\\nu\\kappa})$ depending\nupon the metric $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ and the curvature tensor\n$R^\\lambda_{\\mu\\nu\\kappa}$, are equivalent to the conventional Einstein theory\nfor a (possibly) different metric tensor $\\tilde{g}_{\\mu\\nu}$ and (possibly) a\ndifferent set of matter fields. The simple proof of this theorem relies on a\nnew approach to variational problems containing metric and connection.\n", "  Gamma-ray experiments seeking to detect evidence of dark matter annihilation\nin dwarf spheroidal galaxies require knowledge of the distribution of dark\nmatter within these systems. We analyze the effects of flattening on the\nannihilation (J) and decay (D) factors of dwarf spheroidal galaxies with both\nanalytic and numerical methods. Flattening has two consequences: first, there\nis a geometric effect as the squeezing (or stretching) of the dark matter\ndistribution enhances (or diminishes) the J-factor; second, the line of sight\nvelocity dispersion of stars must hold up the flattened baryonic component in\nthe flattened dark matter halo. We provide analytic formulae and a simple\nnumerical approach to estimate the correction to the J- and D-factors required\nover simple spherical modeling. The formulae are validated with a series of\nequilibrium models of flattened stellar distributions embedded in flattened\ndark-matter distributions. We compute corrections to the J- and D-factors for\nthe Milky Way dwarf spheroidal galaxies under the assumption that they are all\nprolate or all oblate and find that the hierarchy of J-factors for the dwarf\nspheroidals is slightly altered (typical correction factors for an ellipticity\nof $0.4$ are $0.75$ for the oblate case and $1.6$ for the prolate case). We\ndemonstrate that spherical estimates of the D-factors are very insensitive to\nthe flattening and introduce uncertainties significantly less than the\nuncertainties in the D-factors from the other observables for all the dwarf\nspheroidals (for example, ${}^{+10\\mathrm{\\,percent}}_{-3\\mathrm{\\,percent}}$\nfor a typical ellipticity of $0.4$). We conclude by investigating the spread in\ncorrection factors produced by triaxial figures and provide uncertainties in\nthe J-factors for the dwarf spheroidals using different physically-motivated\nassumptions for their intrinsic shape and axis alignments. (abridged)\n", "  We show by means of ab initio calculations and tight-binding modeling that an\noxide system based on a honeycomb lattice can sustain topologically non-trivial\nstates if a single orbital dominates the spectrum close to the Fermi level. In\nsuch situation, the low energy spectra is described by two Dirac equations that\nbecome non-trivially gapped when spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is switched on. We\nprovide one specific example for this but the recipe is general. We discuss a\nrealization of this starting from a conventional spin-a-half honeycomb\nantiferromagnet whose states close to the Fermi energy are d$_{z^2}$ orbitals.\nSwitching off magnetism by atomic substitution and ensuring that the electronic\nstructure becomes two-dimensional is sufficient for topologicality to arise in\nsuch a system. We show that the gap in such model scales linearly with SOC,\nopposed to other oxide-based topological insulators, where smaller gaps tend to\nappear by construction of the lattice. We also provide a study of the quantum\nHall effect in such system, showing the close connections with the physics of\ngraphene but in a d-electron system.\n", "  We discuss aspects of the theory of non-invertible transformations which\nenter in the problem of classification of diffe\\-ren\\-tial-difference equations\nand, in particular, the notion of Miura type transformation. We introduce the\nconcept of non--Miura type linearizable transformation and we present\ntechniques which allow one to construct simple linearizable transformations and\nhelp us to solve the classification problem. This theory is illustrated by the\nexample of a new integrable differential--difference equation depending on 5\nlattice points, interesting from the viewpoint of the non-invertible\ntransformation which relate it to an Itoh--Narita--Bogoyavlensky equation.\n", "  The CH$^+$ ion is a key species in the initial steps of interstellar carbon\nchemistry. Its formation in diverse environments where it is observed is not\nwell understood, however, because the main production pathway is so endothermic\n(4280 K) that it is unlikely to proceed at the typical temperatures of\nmolecular clouds. We investigation CH$^+$ formation with the first\nvelocity-resolved spectral mapping of the CH$^+$ $J=1-0, 2-1$ rotational\ntransitions, three sets of CH $\\Lambda$-doubled triplet lines, $^{12}$C$^+$ and\n$^{13}$C$^+$, and CH$_3$OH 835~GHz E-symmetry Q branch transitions, obtained\nwith Herschel/HIFI over $\\approx$12 arcmin$^2$ centered on the Orion BN/KL\nsource. We present the spatial morphologies and kinematics, cloud boundary\nconditions, excitation temperatures, column densities, and $^{12}$C$^+$ optical\ndepths. Emission from C$^+$, CH$^+$, and CH is indicated to arise in the\ndiluted gas, outside of the explosive, dense BN/KL outflow. Our models show\nthat UV-irradiation provides favorable conditions for steady-state production\nof CH$^+$ in this environment. Surprisingly, no spatial or kinematic\ncorrespondences of these species are found with H$_2$ S(1) emission tracing\nshocked gas in the outflow. We propose that C$^+$ is being consumed by rapid\nproduction of CO to explain the lack of C$^+$ and CH$^+$ in the outflow, and\nthat fluorescence provides the reservoir of H$_2$ excited to higher\nro-vibrational and rotational levels. Hence, in star-forming environments\ncontaining sources of shocks and strong UV radiation, a description of CH$^+$\nformation and excitation conditions is incomplete without including the\nimportant --- possibly dominant --- role of UV irradiation.\n", "  The leading-order spin-orbit coupling is included in a post-Newtonian\nLagrangian formulation of spinning compact binaries, which consists of the\nNewtonian term, first post-Newtonian (1PN) and 2PN non-spin terms and 2PN\nspin-spin coupling. This makes a 3PN spin-spin coupling occur in the derived\nHamiltonian. The spin-spin couplings are mainly responsible for chaos in the\nHamiltonians. However, the 3PN spin-spin Hamiltonian is small and has different\nsigns, compared with the 2PN spin-spin Hamiltonian equivalent to the 2PN\nspin-spin Lagrangian. As a result, the probability of the occurrence of chaos\nin the Lagrangian formulation without the spin-orbit coupling is larger than\nthat in the Lagrangian formulation with the spin-orbit coupling. Numerical\nevidences support the claim.\n", "  We construct a list of minimal scale-invariant models at the TeV scale that\ngenerate one-loop neutrino mass and give viable dark matter candidates. The\nmodels generically contain a singlet scalar and a $Z_2$-odd sector comprised of\nsinglet, doublet and/or triplet SU(2) multiplets. The dark matter may reside in\na single multiplet or arise as an admixture of several multiplets. We find\nfifteen independent models, for which the dark matter is a viable candidate and\nneutrino mass results from a diagram with just one of the irreducible\nscale-invariant one-loop topologies. Further \"non-pure\" cases give hybrid\none-/two-loop masses. All models predict new TeV scale physics, including a\nsinglet scalar that generically mixes with the Higgs boson.\n", "  High frequency mechanical resonators subjected to low thermal phonon\noccupancy are easier to be prepared to the ground state by direct cryogenic\ncooling. Their extreme stiffness, however, poses a significant challenge for\nexternal interrogations. Here we demonstrate a superconducting cavity\npiezo-electromechanical system in which multiple modes of a bulk acoustic\nresonator oscillating at $10\\,\\textrm{GHz}$ are coupled to a planar microwave\nsuperconducting resonator with a cooperativity exceeding $2\\times10^{3}$, deep\nin the strong coupling regime. By implementation of the non-contact coupling\nscheme to reduce mechanical dissipation, the system exhibits excellent\ncoherence characterized by a frequency-quality factor product of\n$7.5\\times10^{15}\\,\\textrm{Hz}$. Interesting dynamics of temporal oscillations\nof the microwave energy is observed, implying the coherent conversion between\nphonons and photons. The demonstrated high frequency cavity\npiezo-electromechanics is compatible with superconducting qubits, representing\nan important step towards hybrid quantum systems.\n", "  The aim of this short paper is to discuss the recently observed excess at 750\nGeV by both CMS and ATLAS in the light of the dual standard model. Within this\nframework it is natural to introduce neutral spin 0 and/or spin 2 $SU(2)$ glue\nmesons which could easily account for this observation if it is confirmed. The\nmodel predicts that these glue mesons would be part of $SU(2)$ triplets and\nthat there must thus be charged counterparts of these glue mesons carrying a\nQED charge of $\\pm 1$ with a spin 0 and/or 2 as well.\n", "  It is proposed to identify a strong electric field created during\nrelativistic collisions of asymmetric nuclei via observation of pseudorapidity\nand transverse momentum distributions of hadrons with the same mass but\nopposite charges. The detailed calculation results for the directed flow within\nthe Parton-Hadron String Dynamics model are given for Cu-Au interactions at the\nNICA collision energies of $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=9$ and $5$ GeV. The separation effect\nis observable at 9 GeV as clearly as at 200 GeV\n", "  We evaluate the second--order (beyond--mean--field) contribution to the\nequation of state of nuclear matter with the effective Skyrme force and use\ncutoff and dimensional regularizations to treat the ultraviolet divergence\nproduced by the zero--range character of this interaction. An adjustment of the\nforce parameters is then performed in both cases to remove any double counting\ngenerated by the explicit computation of beyond--mean--field corrections with\nthe Skyrme force. In addition, we include at second order the rearrangement\nterms associated to the density--dependent part of the Skyrme force and discuss\ntheir effect. Sets of parameters are proposed to define new effective forces\nwhich are specially designed for second--order calculations in nuclear matter.\n", "  We present a plausible counterexample to cosmic censorship in four\ndimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory with asymptotically anti-de Sitter boundary\nconditions. Smooth initial data evolves to a region of arbitrarily large\ncurvature that is visible to distant observers. Our example is based on a\nholographic model of an electrically charged, localised defect which was\npreviously studied at zero temperature. We partially extend those results to\nnonzero temperatures.\n", "  This paper presents the boundary conditions needed for drift-diffusion models\nto treat interfaces with spin-orbit coupling. Using these boundary conditions\nfor heavy metal/ferromagnet bilayers, solutions of the drift-diffusion\nequations agree with solutions of the spin-dependent Boltzmann equation and\nallow for a much simpler interpretation of the results. A key feature of these\nboundary conditions is their ability to capture the role that in-plane electric\nfields have on the generation of spin currents that flow perpendicularly to the\ninterface. The generation of these spin currents is a direct consequence of the\neffect of interfacial spin-orbit coupling on interfacial scattering. In heavy\nmetal/ferromagnet bilayers, these spin currents provide an important mechanism\nfor the creation of damping-like and field-like torques; they also lead to\npossible reinterpretations of experiments in which interfacial contributions to\nspin torques are thought to be suppressed.\n", "  We address the characterization of molecular nanomagnets at the quantum level\nand analyze the performance of local measurements in estimating the physical\nparameters in their spin Hamiltonians. To this aim, we compute key quantities\nin quantum estimation theory, such as the classical and the quantum Fisher\ninformation, in the prototypical case of an heterometallic antiferromagnetic\nring. We show that local measurements, performed only on a portion of the\nmolecule, allow a precise estimate of the parameters related to both magnetic\ndefects and avoided level crossings.\n", "  Due to the large value of the scattering length in nuclear systems, standard\ndensity--functional theories based on effective interactions usually fail to\nreproduce the nuclear Fermi liquid behavior both at very low densities and\nclose to equilibrium. Guided on one side by the success of the Skyrme density\nfunctional and, on the other side, by resummation techniques used in Effective\nField Theories for systems with large scattering lengths, a new energy--density\nfunctional is proposed. This functional, adjusted on microscopic calculations,\nreproduces the nuclear equations of state of neutron and symmetric matter at\nvarious densities. Furthermore, it provides reasonable saturation properties as\nwell as an appropriate density dependence for the symmetry energy.\n", "  Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have been shown to possess properties beneficial\nfor the treatment of cancerous tumors by acting as radiosensitizers for both\nphoton and ion radiation. Blood circulation time is usually increased by\ncoating the AuNPs with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) ligands. The effectiveness\nof the PEG coating, however, depends on both the ligand surface density and\nlength of the PEG molecules, making it important to understand the structure of\nthe coating. In this paper the thickness, ligand surface density, and density\nof the PEG coating is studied with classical molecular dynamics using the\nsoftware package MBN Explorer. AuNPs consisting of 135 atoms (approximately 1.4\nnm diameter) in a water medium have been studied with the number of PEG ligands\nvarying between 32 and 60. We find that the thickness of the coating is only\nweakly dependent on the surface ligand density and that the degree of water\npenetration increased when there is a smaller number of attached ligands.\n", "  We develop a renormalization method for holographic entanglement entropy\nbased on area renormalization of entangling surfaces. The renormalized\nentanglement entropy is derived for entangling surfaces in asymptotically\nlocally anti-de Sitter spacetimes in general dimensions and for entangling\nsurfaces in four dimensional holographic renormalization group flows. The\nrenormalized entanglement entropy for disk regions in $AdS_4$ spacetimes agrees\nprecisely with the holographically renormalized action for $AdS_4$ with\nspherical slicing and hence with the F quantity, in accordance with the\nCasini-Huerta-Myers map. We present a generic class of holographic RG flows\nassociated with deformations by operators of dimension $3/2 < \\Delta < 5/2$ for\nwhich the F quantity increases along the RG flow, hence violating the strong\nversion of the F theorem. We conclude by explaining how the renormalized\nentanglement entropy can be derived directly from the renormalized partition\nfunction using the replica trick i.e. our renormalization method for the\nentanglement entropy is inherited directly from that of the partition function.\nWe show explicitly how the entanglement entropy counterterms can be derived\nfrom the standard holographic renormalization counterterms for asymptotically\nlocally anti-de Sitter spacetimes.\n", "  In this work we explore the structure of the branching graph of the unitary\ngroup using Schur transitions. We find that these transitions suggest a new\ncombinatorial expression for counting paths in the branching graph. This\nformula, which is valid for any rank of the unitary group, reproduces known\nasymptotic results. We proceed to establish the general validity of this\nexpression by a formal proof. The form of this equation strongly hints towards\na quantum generalization. Thus, we introduce a notion of quantum relative\ndimension and subject it to the appropriate consistency tests. This new\nquantity finds its natural environment in the context of RCFTs and fractional\nstatistics; where the already established notion of quantum dimension has\nproven to be of great physical importance.\n", "  Quasiprobability representations, such as the Wigner function, play an\nimportant role in various research areas. The inevitable appearance of\nnegativity in such representations is often regarded as a signature of\nnonclassicality, which has profound implications for quantum computation.\nHowever, little is known about the minimal negativity that is necessary in\ngeneral quasiprobability representations. Here we focus on a natural class of\nquasiprobability representations that is distinguished by simplicity and\neconomy. We introduce three measures of negativity concerning the\nrepresentations of quantum states, unitary transformations, and quantum\nchannels, respectively. Quite surprisingly, all three measures lead to the same\nrepresentations with minimal negativity, which are in one-to-one correspondence\nwith the elusive symmetric informationally complete measurements. In addition,\nmost representations with minimal negativity are automatically covariant with\nrespect to the Heisenberg-Weyl groups. Furthermore, our study reveals an\ninteresting tradeoff between negativity and symmetry in quasiprobability\nrepresentations.\n", "  Experiments during the past two years have shown strong resonant\nphoton-magnon coupling in microwave cavities, while coupling in the optical\nregime was demonstrated very recently for the first time. Unlike with\nmicrowaves, the coupling in optical cavities is parametric, akin to\noptomechanical systems. This line of research promises to evolve into a new\nfield of optomagnonics, aimed at the coherent manipulation of elementary\nmagnetic excitations by optical means. In this work we derive the microscopic\noptomagnonic Hamiltonian. In the linear regime the system reduces to the\nwell-known optomechanical case, with remarkably large coupling. Going beyond\nthat, we study the optically induced nonlinear classical dynamics of a\nmacrospin. In the fast cavity regime we obtain an effective equation of motion\nfor the spin and show that the light field induces a dissipative term\nreminiscent of Gilbert damping. The induced dissipation coefficient however can\nchange sign on the Bloch sphere, giving rise to self-sustained oscillations.\nWhen the full dynamics of the system is considered, the system can enter a\nchaotic regime by successive period doubling of the oscillations.\n", "  We show how the thermodynamic properties of large many-body localized systems\ncan be studied using quantum Monte Carlo simulations. To this end we devise a\nheuristic way of constructing local integrals of motion of very high quality,\nwhich are added to the Hamiltonian in conjunction with Lagrange multipliers.\nThe ground state simulation of the shifted Hamiltonian corresponds to a\nhigh-energy state of the original Hamiltonian in case of exactly known local\nintegrals of motion. We can show that the inevitable mixing between eigenstates\nas a consequence of non-perfect integrals of motion is weak enough such that\nthe characteristics of many-body localized systems are not averaged out in our\napproach, unlike the standard ensembles of statistical mechanics. Our method\npaves the way to study higher dimensions and indicates that a full many-body\nlocalized phase in 2d, where (nearly) all eigenstates are localized, is likely\nto exist.\n", "  An exhaustive list of four-dimensional $\\Lambda$-vacuum spacetimes admitting\na Killing vector whose self-dual Killing two-form ${\\cal F}$ is null is\nobtained assuming that the self-dual Weyl tensor is proportional to the tensor\nproduct of ${\\cal F}$ by itself. Our analysis complements previous results\nconcerning the case with non-null ${\\cal F}$. We analyze both cases with\n$\\Lambda$ vanishing or not. In the latter case we prove that $\\Lambda< 0$ must\nhold necessarily, and we find a characterization of the Einstein spacetimes\nconformal to pp-waves. In the former case we obtain spacetime characterizations\nof vacuum plane waves and of the stationary vacuum Brinkmann spacetimes. At the\nlight of the full set of results, old and new, we reformulate the case with\nnon-null ${\\cal F}$ and $\\Lambda= 0$. We finally present a table collecting the\nresults for both null, and non-null, ${\\cal F}$.\n", "  This paper is dedicated to scrutinizing the cosmology in massive gravity. A\nmatter field of the dark sector is coupled to an effective composite metric\nwhile a standard matter field couples to the dynamical metric in the usual way.\nFor this purpose, we study the dynamical system of cosmological solutions by\nusing phase analysis, which provides an overview of the class of cosmological\nsolutions in this setup. This also permits us to study the critical points of\nthe cosmological equations together with their stability. We show the presence\nof stable attractor de Sitter critical points relevant to the late-time cosmic\nacceleration. Furthermore, we study the tensor, vector and scalar perturbations\nin the presence of standard matter fields and obtain the conditions for the\nabsence of ghost and gradient instabilities. Hence, massive gravity in the\npresence of the effective composite metric can accommodate interesting dark\nenergy phenomenology, that can be observationally distinguished from the\nstandard model according to the expansion history and cosmic growth.\n", "  We introduce the conformal field theories that describe the shadows of the\nlowest dimension composites made out of massless free scalars and fermions in\n$d$ dimensions. We argue that these theories can be consistently defined as\nfree CFTs for even $d\\geq 4$. We use OPE techniques to study their spectrum and\nshow that for $d\\rightarrow\\infty$ it matches that of free bosonic CFTs in\n$d=6$ and $d=4$ dimensions. For these $\\sigma$CFTs we calculate $c_T$ in\n$d=6,8,10$ and $12$ dimensions using the OPE and also a direct construction of\ntheir higher-derivative energy momentum tensors. Our results agree with the\ngeneral proposal of arXiv:1601.07198.\n", "  We present multi-wavelength photometric monitoring of WD 1145+017, a white\ndwarf exhibiting periodic dimming events interpreted to be the transits of\norbiting, disintegrating planetesimals. Our observations include the first set\nof near-infrared light curves for the object, obtained on multiple nights over\nthe span of one month, and recorded multiple transit events with depths varying\nbetween ~20 to 50 per cent. Simultaneous near-infrared and optical observations\nof the deepest and longest duration transit event were obtained on two epochs\nwith the Anglo-Australian Telescope and three optical facilities, over the\nwavelength range of 0.5 to 1.2 microns. These observations revealed no\nmeasurable difference in transit depths for multiple photometric pass bands,\nallowing us to place a 2 sigma lower limit of 0.8 microns on the grain size in\nthe putative transiting debris cloud. This conclusion is consistent with the\nspectral energy distribution of the system, which can be fit with an optically\nthin debris disc with minimum particle sizes of 10 +5/-3 microns.\n", "  Using idealised N-body simulations of a Milky Way-sized disc galaxy, we\nqualitatively study how the metallicity distributions of the thin disc star\nparticles are modified by the formation of the bar and spiral arm structures.\nThe thin disc in our numerical experiments initially has a tight negative\nradial metallicity gradient and a constant vertical scale-height. We show that\nthe radial mixing of stars drives a positive vertical metallicity gradient in\nthe thin disc. On the other hand, if the initial thin disc is flared, with\nvertical scale-height increasing with galactocentric radius, the metal poor\nstars originally in the outer disc become dominant in regions above the disc\nplane at every radii. This process can drive a negative vertical metallicity\ngradient, which is consistent with the current observed trend. This model\nmimics a scenario where the star-forming thin disc was flared in the outer\nregion at earlier epochs. Our numerical experiment with an initial flared disc\npredicts that the negative vertical metallicity gradient of the mono-age\nrelatively young thin disc population should be steeper in the inner disc, and\nthe radial metallicity gradient of the mono-age population should be shallower\nat greater heights above the disc plane. We also predict that the metallicity\ndistribution function of mono-age young thin disc populations above the disc\nplane would be more positively skewed in the inner disc compared to the outer\ndisc.\n", "  The LHC potential for discovering doubly-charged vector bileptons is\ninvestigated considering the measurable process $p p$ $\\rightarrow$\n$\\mu^{\\mp}\\mu^{\\mp}\\mu^{\\pm}\\mu^{\\pm} X$. The study is performed assuming\ndifferent bilepton and leptoquark masses. The process cross-section is\ncalculated at leading-order using the \\textsc{Calchep} package. Combining the\ncalculation with the latest ATLAS experiment results at a center-of-mass energy\nof 7 TeV, bounds on bilepton masses based on LHC data are derived for the first\ntime. The results exclude bileptons masses in the range of 200 GeV to 500 GeV\nat 95\\% C.L., depending on the leptoquark mass. Moreover, minimal LHC\nintegrated luminosities needed for discovering and for setting limits on\nbilepton masses are obtained for 13 TeV center-of-mass energy. Simulated events\nare passed through a fast parametric detector simulation using the Delphes\npackage.\n", "  Liquid metal walls in fusion reactors will be subject to instabilities,\nturbulence, induced currents, error fields and temperature gradients that will\nmake them locally bulge, thus entering in contact with the plasma, or deplete,\nhence exposing the underlying solid substrate. To prevent this, research has\nbegun to actively stabilize static or flowing liquid metal layers by locally\napplying forces in feedback with thickness measurements. Here we present\nresistive sensors of liquid metal thickness and demonstrate jxB actuators, to\nlocally control it.\n", "  In a short review-article we first discuss the results, which are mainly\ndevoted to the generalizations of the famous Kohn-Luttinger mechanism of\nsuperconductivity in purely repulsive fermion systems at low electron\ndensities. In the context of repulsive-U Hubbard model and Shubin-Vonsovsky\nmodel we consider briefly the superconducting phase diagrams and the symmetries\nof the order parameter in novel strongly correlated electron systems including\nidealized monolayer and bilayer graphene. We stress that purely repulsive\nfermion systems are mainly the subject of unconventional low-temperature\nsuperconductivity. To get the high temperature superconductivity in cuprates\n(with T_C of the order of 100 K) we should proceed to the t-J model with the\nVan der Waals interaction potential and the competition between short-range\nrepulsion and long-range attraction. Finally we stress that to describe\nsuperconductivity in metallic hydrogen alloys under pressure (with T_C of the\norder of 200 K) it is reasonable to reexamine more conventional mechanisms\nconnected with electron-phonon interaction. These mechanisms arise in the\nattractive-U Hubbard model with static onsite or intersite attractive potential\nor in more realistic theories (which include retardation effects) such as\nMigdal-Eliashberg strong coupling theory or even Fermi-Bose mixture theory of\nRanninger et al., and its generalizations.\n", "  Light confinement induced by resonant states in aperiodic photonic structures\nare interesting for many applications. A particular case of these resonances\ncan be found in 2D quasi-crystalline arrangements of dielectric cylinders.\nThese systems present a rather isotropic band gap as well as isolated in-gap\nphotonic states (as a result of spatially localized resonances). These states\nare built by high symmetry polygonal clusters that can be regarded as photonic\nmolecules. In this paper we study the transmission properties of a slab of\nglass cylinders arranged in approximants of decagonal quasi-crystalline\nstructure. In particular, we investigate the influence of the slab width in the\ntransmission contrast between the states and the gap. The study is both\nexperimental and numerical in the microwave regime. We find that the best\ntransmission contrast is found for a width of around 3 times the radiation\nwavelength. The transmission at the band gap region is mediated by the\nresonances of the photonic molecules. If the samples are thin enough they\nbecome transparent except around a resonance of the photonic molecule which\nreflects the incoming light. In this case the behavior is reminiscent of an\nabsorbing molecule.\n", "  Massive gravity in the presence of doubly coupled matter field via en\neffective composite metric yields an accelerated expansion of the universe. It\nhas been recently shown that the model admits stable de Sitter attractor\nsolutions and could be used as a dark energy model. In this work, we perform a\nfirst analysis of the constraints imposed by the SNIa, BAO and CMB data on the\nmassive gravity model with the effective composite metric and show that all the\nbackground observations are mutually compatible at the one sigma level with the\nmodel.\n", "  Following the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism we study the thermal\ntransport in a composite chain subject to a time-dependent perturbation. The\nsystem is formed by two finite linear asymmetric harmonic chains subject to an\non-site potential connected together by a time-modulated coupling. The ends of\nthe chains are coupled to two phononic reservoirs at different temperatures. We\npresent the relevant equations used to calculate the heat current along each\nsegment. We find that the system presents different transport regimes according\nthe driving frequency and temperature gradients. One of the regimes corresponds\nto a heat pump against thermal gradient, thus a characterization of the cooling\nperformance of the device is presented.\n", "  There are known obstructions to a full quantization in the spirit of Dirac's\napproach, the most known being the Groenewold-van Hove no-go result. We show,\nfollowing a suggestion of S. K. Kauffmann, that it is possible to construct a\nwell-defined quantization procedure by weakening the usual requirement that\ncommutators should correspond to Poisson brackets. The weaker requirement\nconsists in demanding that this correspondence should only hold for Hamiltonian\nfunctions of the type T(p)+V(q). This reformulation leads to a non-injective\nquantization of all observables which, when restricted to polynomials, is the\nrule proposed by Born and Jordan in the early days of quantum mechanics.\n", "  We study the effect of the chemical potential on the results of the BCS\ntheory of superconductivity. We assume that the pairing interaction is\nmanifested between electrons of single-particle energies in an interval $[\\mu -\n\\hbar\\omega_c, \\mu + \\hbar\\omega_c]$, where $\\mu$ and $\\omega_c$ are parameters\nof the model--$\\mu$ needs not be equal to the chemical potential of the system,\ndenoted here by $\\mu_R$. The BCS results are recovered if $\\mu = \\mu_R$. If\n$\\mu \\ne \\mu_R$ the physical properties change significantly: the energy gap\n$\\Delta$ is smaller than the BCS gap, a population imbalance appears, and the\nsuperconductor-normal metal phase transition is of the first order. The\nquasiparticle imbalance is an equilibrium property that appears due to the\nasymmetry with respect to $\\mu_R$ of the single-particle energy interval in\nwhich the pairing potential is manifested.\n  For $\\mu_R - \\mu$ taking values in some ranges, the equation for $\\Delta$ may\nhave more than one solution at the same temperature, forming branches of\nsolutions when $\\Delta$ is plotted vs $\\mu_R-\\mu$ at fixed $T$. The solution\nwith the highest energy gap, which corresponds to the BCS solution when $\\mu =\n\\mu_R$, cease to exist if $|\\mu-\\mu_R| \\ge 2\\Delta_0$ ($\\Delta_0$ is the BCS\ngap at zero temperature). Therefore the superconductivity is conditioned by the\nexistence of the pairing interaction and also by the value of $\\mu_R - \\mu$.\n", "  We calculate the gravitational waves (GW) spectrum produced in various Early\nUniverse scenarios from gauge field sources, thus generalizing earlier\ninflationary calculations to bouncing cosmologies. We consider generic\ncouplings between the gauge fields and the scalar field dominating the energy\ndensity of the Universe. We analyze the requirements needed to avoid a\nbackreaction that will spoil the background evolution. When the scalar is\ncoupled only to $F \\tilde F$ term, the sourced GW spectrum is exponentially\nenhanced and parametrically the square of the vacuum fluctuations spectrum,\n${\\cal P}^s_T\\sim ({\\cal P}^v_T)^2$, giving an even bluer spectrum than the\nstandard vacuum one. When the scalar field is also coupled to $F^2$ term, the\namplitude is still exponentially enhanced, but the spectrum can be arbitrarily\nclose to scale invariant (still slightly blue), $n_T\\gtrsim 0$, that is\ndistinguishable form the slightly red inflationary one. Hence, we have a proof\nof concept of observable GW on CMB scales in a bouncing cosmology.\n", "  We present our investigation of 319 Class II objects in Orion A observed by\n$Spitzer$/IRS. We also present the follow-up observation of 120 of these Class\nII objects in Orion A from IRTF/SpeX. We measure continuum spectral indices,\nequivalent widths, and integrated fluxes that pertain to disk structure and\ndust composition from IRS spectra of Class II objects in Orion A. We estimate\nmass accretion rates using hydrogen recombination lines in the SpeX spectra of\nour targets. Utilizing these properties, we compare the distributions of the\ndisk and dust properties of Orion A disks to those of Taurus disks with respect\nto position within Orion A (ONC and L1641) and to the sub-groups by the\ninferred radial structures, such as transitional disks vs. radially continuous\nfull disks. Our main findings are as follows. (1) Inner disks evolve faster\nthan the outer disks. (2) Mass accretion rate of transitional disks and that of\nradially continuous full disks are statistically significantly displaced from\neach other. The median mass accretion rate of radially continuous disks in ONC\nand L1641 is not very different from that in Taurus. (3) Less grain processing\nhas occurred in the disks in ONC compared to those in Taurus, based on analysis\nof the shape index of the 10 $\\mu$m silicate feature ($F_{11.3}/F_{9.8}$). (4)\nThe 20-31 $\\mu$m continuum spectral index tracks the projected distance from\nthe most luminous Trapezium star, $\\theta^{1}$ Ori C. A possible explanation is\nthe effect of UV ablation of the outer part of the disks.\n", "  Solar dynamo models require some mechanism for magnetic field concentration\nnear the base of the convection zone in order to generate super-kilogauss\ntoroidal fields with sufficiently large (~10^{24} Mx) magnetic flux. We\nconsider the downward diamagnetic pumping near the base of the convection zone\nas a possible concentration mechanism and derive the pumping velocities with\nallowance for the effect of rotation. Transport velocities for poloidal and\ntoroidal fields differ in rotating fluid. The toroidal field is transported\ndownward along the radius only but the pumping velocity for the poloidal field\nhas an equatorward meridional component also. Previous results for cases of\nslow and rapid rotation are reproduced and the diamagnetic pumping expressions\nadapted for use in dynamo models are presented.\n", "  Magneto-acoustic investigations of the frustrated triangular-lattice\nantiferromagnet Cs2CuCl4 were performed for the longitudinal modes c11 and c33\nin magnetic fields along the a-axis. The temperature dependence of the sound\nvelocity at zero field shows a mild softening at low temperature and displays a\nsmall kink-like anomaly at TN. Isothermal measurements at T < TN of the sound\nattenuation reveal two closely-spaced features of different character on\napproaching the materials quantum-critical point (QCP) around Bs = 8.5 T for B\n// a. The peak at slightly lower fields remains sharp down to the lowest\ntemperature and can be attributed to the ordering temperature TN(B). The second\nanomaly which is rounded and which becomes reduced in size upon cooling is\nassigned to the materials spin-liquid properties preceding the long-range\nantiferromagnetic ordering. These two features merge upon cooling suggesting a\ncoincidence at the QCP. The elastic constant at lowest temperatures of our\nexperiment at 32 mK can be well described by a Landau free energy model with a\nvery small magnetoelastic coupling constant G/kB = 2.8 K. The applicability of\nthis classical model indicates the existence of a small gap in the magnetic\nexcitation spectrum which drives the system away from quantum criticality.\n", "  The near horizon geometries are usually constructed by implementing a\nspecific limit to a given extreme black hole configuration. Their salient\nfeature is that the isometry group includes the conformal subgroup SO(2,1). In\nthis work, we turn the logic around and use the conformal invariants for\nconstructing Ricci-flat metrics in d=4 and d=5 where the vacuum Einstein\nequations reduce to a coupled set of ordinary differential equations. In four\ndimensions the analysis can be carried out in full generality and the resulting\nmetric describes the d=4 near horizon Kerr-NUT black hole. In five dimensions\nwe choose a specific ansatz whose structure is similar to the d=5 near horizon\nMyers-Perry black hole. A Ricci-flat metric involving five arbitrary parameters\nis constructed. A particular member of this family, which is characterized by\nthree parameters, seems to be a natural candidate to describe the d=5 near\nhorizon Myers-Perry black hole with a NUT charge.\n", "  We study the effect of strong electron-phonon interactions on the damping of\nthe Higgs amplitude mode in superconductors by means of non-equilibrium\ndynamical mean-field simulations of the Holstein model. In contrast to the BCS\ndynamics, we find that the damping of the Higgs mode strongly depends on the\ntemperature, becoming faster as the systen approaches the transition\ntemperature. The damping at low temperatures is well described by a power-law,\nwhile near the transition temperature the damping shows exponential-like\nbehavior. We explain this crossover by a temperature-dependent quasiparticle\nlifetime caused by the strong electron- phonon coupling, which smears the\nsuperconducting gap edge and makes the relaxation of the Higgs mode into\nquasiparticles more efficient at elevated temperatures. We also reveal that the\nphonon dynamics can soften the Higgs mode, which results in a slower damping.\n", "  Slow MHD waves are important tools for understanding the coronal structures\nand dynamics. In this paper, we report a number of observations, from X-Ray\nTelescope (XRT) on board HINODE and SDO/AIA of reflecting longitudinal waves in\nhot coronal loops. To our knowledge, this is the first report of this kind as\nseen from the XRT and simultaneously with the AIA. The wave appears after a\nmicro-flare occurs at one of the footpoints. We estimate the density and the\ntemperature of the loop plasma by performing DEM analysis on the AIA image\nsequence. The estimated speed of propagation is comparable or lower than the\nlocal sound speed suggesting it to be a propagating slow wave. The intensity\nperturbation amplitudes, in every case, falls very rapidly as the perturbation\nmoves along the loop and eventually vanishes after one or more reflections. To\ncheck the consistency of such reflection signatures with the obtained loop\nparameters, we perform a 2.5D MHD simulation, which uses the parameters\nobtained from our observation as inputs and performed forward modelling to\nsynthesize AIA 94~\\r{A} images. Analyzing the synthesized images, we obtain the\nsame properties of the observables as for the real observation. From the\nanalysis we conclude that a footpoint heating can generate slow wave which then\nreflects back and forth in the coronal loop before fading out. Our analysis on\nthe simulated data shows that the main agent for this damping is the\nanisotropic thermal conduction.\n", "  We show that a two-excitation process in superfluid helium, combined with\nsensitivity to meV energy depositions, can probe dark matter down to the ~keV\nwarm dark matter mass limit. This mass reach is three orders of magnitude below\nwhat can be probed with ordinary nuclear recoils in helium at the same energy\nresolution. For dark matter lighter than $\\sim 100$ keV, the kinematics of the\nprocess requires the two athermal excitations to have nearly equal and opposite\nmomentum, potentially providing a built-in coincidence mechanism for\ncontrolling backgrounds.\n", "  The escape of ionizing Lyman Continuum (LyC) photons requires the existence\nof low-N_HI sightlines, which also promote escape of Lyman-Alpha (Lya). We use\na suite of 2500 Lya Monte-Carlo radiative transfer simulations through models\nof dusty, clumpy interstellar (`multiphase') media from Gronke & Dijkstra\n(2016), and compare the escape fractions of Lya [f_esc(Lya)] and LyC radiation\n[f_esc(LyC)]. We find that f_esc(LyC) and f_esc(Lya) are correlated: galaxies\nwith a low f_esc(Lya) consistently have a low f_esc(LyC), while galaxies with a\nhigh f_esc(Lya) exhibit a large dispersion in f_esc(LyC). We argue that there\nis increasing observational evidence that Lya escapes more easily from UV-faint\ngalaxies. The correlation between f_esc(LyC) and f_esc(Lya) then implies that\nUV-faint galaxies contribute more to the ionizing background than implied by\nthe faint-end slope of the UV-luminosity function. In multiphase gases, the\nionizing escape fraction is most strongly affected by the cloud covering\nfactor, f_cl, which implies that f_esc(LyC) is closely connected to the\nobserved Lya spectral line shape. Specifically, LyC emitting galaxies typically\nhaving narrower, more symmetric line profiles. This prediction is qualitatively\nsimilar to that for `shell models'.\n", "  Deep X-ray surveys have provided a comprehensive and largely unbiased view of\nactive galactic nuclei (AGN) evolution stretching back to $z \\sim 5$. However,\nit has been challenging to use the survey results to connect this evolution to\nthe cosmological environment that AGNs inhabit. Exploring this connection will\nbe crucial to understanding the triggering mechanisms of AGNs and how these\nprocesses manifest in observations at all wavelengths. In anticipation of\nupcoming wide-field X-ray surveys that will allow quantitative analysis of AGN\nenvironments, this paper presents a method to observationally constrain the\nConditional Luminosity Function (CLF) of AGNs at a specific $z$. Once measured,\nthe CLF allows the calculation of the AGN bias, mean dark matter halo mass, AGN\nlifetime, halo occupation number, and AGN correlation function -- all as a\nfunction of luminosity. The CLF can be constrained using a measurement of the\nX-ray luminosity function and the correlation length at different luminosities.\nThe method is illustrated at $z \\approx 0$ and $0.9$ using the limited data\nthat is currently available, and a clear luminosity dependence in the AGN bias\nand mean halo mass is predicted at both $z$, supporting the idea that there are\nat least two different modes of AGN triggering. In addition, the CLF predicts\nthat $z\\approx 0.9$ quasars may be commonly hosted by haloes with\n$M_{\\mathrm{h}} \\sim 10^{14}$ M$_{\\odot}$. These `young cluster' environments\nmay provide the necessary interactions between gas-rich galaxies to fuel\nluminous accretion. The results derived from this method will be useful to\npopulate AGNs of different luminosities in cosmological simulations.\n", "  The orientation-based unification model of active galactic nuclei (AGNs)\nposits that the principle difference between obscured (Type 2) and unobscured\n(Type 1) AGNs is the line-of-sight into the central engine. If this model is\ncorrect than there should be no difference in many of the properties of AGN\nhost galaxies (e.g., the mass of the surrounding dark matter haloes). However,\nrecent clustering analyses of Type 1 and Type 2 AGNs have provided some\nevidence for a difference in the halo mass, in conflict with the\norientation-based unified model. In this work, a method to compute the\nConditional Luminosity Function (CLF) of Type 2 and Type 1 AGNs is presented.\nThe CLF allows many fundamental halo properties to be computed as a function of\nAGN luminosity, which we apply to the question of the host halo masses of Type\n1 and 2 AGNs. By making use of the total AGN CLF, the Type 1 X-ray luminosity\nfunction, and the luminosity-dependent Type 2 AGN fraction, the CLFs of Type 1\nand 2 AGNs are calculated at $z\\approx 0$ and $0.9$. At both $z$, there is no\nstatistically significant difference in the mean halo mass of Type 2 and 1 AGNs\nat any luminosity. There is marginal evidence that Type 1 AGNs may have larger\nhalo masses than Type 2s, which would be consistent with an evolutionary\npicture where quasars are initially obscured and then subsequently reveal\nthemselves as Type 1s. As the Type 1 lifetime is longer, the host halo will\nincrease somewhat in mass during the Type 1 phase. The CLF technique will be a\npowerful way to study the properties of many AGNs subsets (e.g., radio-loud,\nCompton-thick) as future wide-area X-ray and optical surveys substantially\nincrease our ability to place AGNs in their cosmological context.\n", "  We show the presence of Floquet-Weyl and Floquet-topological-insulator phases\nin a stacked two-dimensional ring-network lattice. The Weyl points in the\nthree-dimensional Brillouin zone and Fermi-arc surface states are clearly\ndemonstrated in the quasienergy spectrum of the system in the Weyl phase. In\naddition, chiral surface states coexist in this phase. The\nFloquet-topological-insulator phase is characterized by the winding number of\ntwo in the reflection matrices of the semi-infinite system and resulting two\ngapless surface states in the quasienergy g ap of the bulk. The phase diagram\nof the system is derived in the two-parameter space of hopping S-matrices among\nthe rings. We also discuss a possible optical realization of the system\ntogether with the introduction of synthetic gauge fields.\n", "  Azimuthal angular correlations between produced hadrons/jets in high energy\ncollisions are a sensitive probe of the dynamics of QCD at small x. Here we\nderive the triple differential cross section for inclusive production of 3\npolarized partons in DIS at small x using the spinor helicity formalism. The\ntarget proton or nucleus is described using the Color Glass Condensate (CGC)\nformalism. The resulting expressions are used to study azimuthal angular\ncorrelations between produced partons in order to probe the gluon structure of\nthe target hadron or nucleus. Our analytic expressions can also be used to\ncalculate the real part of the Next to Leading Order (NLO) corrections to\ndi-hadron production in DIS by integrating out one of the three final state\npartons.\n", "  Magnetic and magneto-functional behavior of a Fe-doped MnNiGe alloy with\nnominal composition Mn$_{0.85}$Fe$_{0.15}$NiGe have been investigated in\nambient as well as in high pressure condition. The alloy undergoes first order\nmartensitic phase transition (MPT) around 200 K and also shows large\nconventional magnetocaloric effect (MCE) ($\\Delta S$ $\\sim$ -21 J/kg-K for\nmagnetic field ($H$) changing from 0-50 kOe) around the transition in ambient\ncondition. Application of external hydrostatic pressure ($P$) results a shift\nin MPT towards the lower temperature and a clear decrease in the saturation\nmoment of the alloy at 5 K. The peak value of MCE is also found to decrease\nwith increasing external $P$ ($\\sim$ 18 J/kg-K decrease in $\\Delta S$ has been\nobserved for $P$ = 12.5 kbar). The most interesting observation is the\noccurance of exchange bias effect (EBE) on application of external $P$. The\ncompeting ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interaction in presence of\nexternal $P$ plays the pivotal role towards the observation of $P$ induced EBE.\n", "  We consider the dimensional reduction of a CFT, breaking multiplets of the\nd-dimensional conformal group SO(d+1,1) up into multiplets of SO(d,1). This\nleads to an expansion of d-dimensional conformal blocks in terms of blocks in\nd-1 dimensions. In particular, we obtain a formula for 3d conformal blocks as\nan infinite sum over 2F1 hypergeometric functions with closed-form\ncoefficients.\n", "  A simple and yet powerful approach for modeling the structure of endohedrally\nconfined diatomic molecules is introduced. The theory, based on a u(4)+u(3)\ndynamical algebra, combines u(4), the vibron model dynamical algebra, with a\nu(3) dynamical algebra that models a spherically symmetric three dimensional\npotential. The first algebra encompasses the internal roto-vibrations degrees\nof freedom of the molecule, while the second takes into account the confined\nmolecule center-of-mass degrees of freedom. A resulting subalgebra chain is\nconnected to the underlying physics and the model is applied to the\nprototypical case of H2 caged in a fullerene molecule. The spectrum of the\nsupramolecular complex H2@C60 is described with a few parameters and\npredictions for not yet detected levels are made. Our fits suggest that the\nquantum numbers of a few lines should be reassigned to obtain better agreement\nwith data.\n", "  We have studied the growth of Fe3O4 (111) epitaxial films on Al2O3 (001)\nsubstrates using a pulsed laser deposition / thermal reduction cycle using an\n{\\alpha}-Fe2O3 target. While direct deposition onto the Al2O3 (001) substrates\nresults in an {\\alpha}-Fe2O3 epilayer, deposition on the Fe3O4 (111) surface\nresults in a {\\gamma}-Fe2O3 epilayer. The kinetics of the transitions between\nFe2O3 and Fe3O4 were studied by measuring the time constants of the\ntransitions. The transition from {\\alpha}-Fe2O3 to Fe3O4 via thermal reduction\nturns out to be very slow, due to the high activation energy. Despite the\nsignificant grain boundaries due to the mismatch between the unit cells of the\nfilm and the substrate, the Fe3O4 (111) films grown from deposition/thermal\nreduction show high crystallinity.\n", "  The coherent dipole-dipole interactions of atoms in an atomic array are\nstudied. It is found that the excitation probability of an atom in an array\nparallel to the direction of laser propagation ($\\boldsymbol{\\hat{k}}$) will\neither grow or decay logarithmically along $\\boldsymbol{\\hat{k}}$, depending on\nthe detuning of the laser. The symmetry of the system for atomic separations of\n$\\delta r = j\\lambda/2$, where $j$ is an integer, causes the excitation\ndistribution and scattered radiation to abruptly become symmetric about the\ncenter of the array. For atomic separations of $\\delta r < \\lambda/2$, the\nappearance of a collection of extremely subradiant states ($\\Gamma\\sim 0$),\ndisrupts the described trend. In order to interpret the results from a finite\narray of atoms, a band structure calculation in the $N\\rightarrow \\infty$ limit\nis conducted where the decay rates and the Collective Lamb Shifts of the\neigenmodes along the Brillouin zone are shown. Finally, the band structure of\nan array strongly affects its scattered radiation, allowing one to manipulate\nthe Collective Lamb Shift as well as the decay rate (from superradiant to\nsubradiant) by changing the angle of the driving laser.\n", "  We numerically study optical conductivity $\\sigma (\\omega )$ near the\n\"antiferromagnetic\" phase transition in the square-lattice Hubbard model at\nhalf filling. We use a cluster dynamical mean field theory and calculate\nconductivity including vertex corrections, and to this end, we have\nreformulated the vertex corrections in the antiferromagnetic phase. We find\nthat the vertex corrections change various important details in temperature-\nand $\\omega$-dependencies of conductivity in the square lattice, and this\ncontrasts sharply the case of the Mott transition in the frustrated triangular\nlattice. Generally, the vertex corrections enhance variations in the\n$\\omega$-dependence, and sharpen the Drude peak and a high-$\\omega$ incoherent\npeak in the paramagnetic phase. They also enhance the dip in $\\sigma (\\omega )$\nat $\\omega$=0 in the antiferromagnetic phase. Therefore, the dc conductivity is\nenhanced in the paramagnetic phase and suppressed in the antiferromagnetic\nphase, but this change occurs slightly below the transition temperature. We\nalso find a temperature region above the transition temperature in which the dc\nconductivity shows an insulating behavior but $\\sigma (\\omega )$ retains the\nDrude peak, and this region is stabilized by the vertex corrections. We also\ninvestigate which fluctuations are important in the vertex corrections and\nanalyze momentum dependence of the vertex function in detail.\n", "  Extensions of nuclear physics to the strange sector are reviewed, covering\ndata and models of Lambda and other hypernuclei, multi-strange matter, and\nanti-kaon bound states and condensation. Past achievements are highlighted,\npresent unresolved problems discussed, and future directions outlined.\n", "  We develop an exceptional generalised geometry formalism for massive type IIA\nsupergravity. In particular, we construct a deformation of the generalised Lie\nderivative, which generates the type IIA gauge transformations as modified by\nthe Romans mass. We apply this new framework to consistent Kaluza-Klein\nreductions preserving maximal supersymmetry. We find a generalised\nparallelisation of the exceptional tangent bundle on S^6, and from this\nreproduce the consistent truncation ansatz and embedding tensor leading to\ndyonically gauged ISO(7) supergravity in four dimensions. We also discuss\nclosely related hyperboloid reductions, yielding a dyonic ISO(p,7-p) gauging.\nFinally, while for vanishing Romans mass we find a generalised parallelisation\non S^d, d=4,3,2, leading to a maximally supersymmetric reduction with gauge\ngroup SO(d+1) (or larger), we provide evidence that an analogous reduction does\nnot exist in the massive theory.\n", "  Polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) and polyethylene teraphthalate (PET) are cheap\nand common polyester plastics used throughout the world in the manufacturing of\nbottled drinks, containers for foodstuffs, and fibers used in clothing. These\nplastics are also known organic scintillators with very good scintillation\nproperties. As particle physics experiments increase in energy and particle\nflux density, so does radiation exposure to detector materials. It is therefore\nimportant that scintillators be tested for radiation tolerance at these\ngenerally unheard of doses. We tested samples of PEN and PET using laser\nstimulated emission on separate tiles exposed to 1 MRad and 10 MRad gamma rays\nwith a 137Cs source. PEN exposed to 1 MRad and 10 MRad emit 71.4% and 46.7% of\nthe light of an undamaged tile, respectively, and maximally recover to 85.9%\nand 79.5% after 5 and 9 days, respectively. PET exposed to 1 MRad and 10 MRad\nemit 35.0% and 12.2% light, respectively, and maximally recover to 93.5% and\n80.0% after 22 and 60 days, respectively.\n", "  We study longitudinal and transverse wave propagation in beams with elastic\nproperties that are periodically varying in space and time. Spatiotemporal\nmodulation of the elastic properties breaks mechanical reciprocity and induces\none-way propagation. We follow an analytic approach to characterize the\nnon-reciprocal behavior of the structures by analyzing the symmetry breaking of\nthe dispersion spectrum, which results in the formation of directional band\ngaps and produces shifts of the First Brilloin Zone limits. This approach\nallows us to relate position and width of the directional band gaps to the\nmodulation parameters. Moreover, we identify the critical values of the\nmodulation speed to maximize the non-reciprocal effect. We numerically verify\nthe theoretical predictions by using a finite element model of the modulated\nbeams to compute the transient response of the structure. We compute the\ntwo-dimensional Fourier transform of the collected displacement fields to\ncalculate numerical band diagrams, showing excellent agreement between\ntheoretical and numerical dispersion diagrams.\n", "  Thin films of VO$_2$ on different substrates, Al$_2$O$_3$ and SiO$_2$/Si,\nhave been prepared and characterized from room temperature up to 360 K. From\nthe band structure in the rutile metallic phase and in the monoclinic\ninsulating phase the optical properties are calculated and compared with\nreflection measurements as a function of temperatures. Various interband\ntransitions can be assigned and compared with previous speculations. We extract\nthe parameters of the metallic charge carriers that evolve upon crossing the\ninsulator-to-metal phase transition and find effects by the substrate. The\neffect of electronic correlations becomes obvious at the phase transition.\n", "  We have carefully examined, in both analytical and numerical ways, how small\nthe terrestrial matter effects can be in a given medium-baseline reactor\nantineutrino oscillation experiment like JUNO or RENO-50. Taking the ongoing\nJUNO experiment for example, we show that the inclusion of terrestrial matter\neffects may reduce the sensitivity of the neutrino mass ordering measurement by\n\\Delta \\chi^2_{\\rm MO} \\simeq 0.6, and a neglect of such effects may shift the\nbest-fit values of the flavor mixing angle \\theta_{12} and the neutrino\nmass-squared difference \\Delta_{21} by about 1\\sigma to 2\\sigma in the future\ndata analysis. In addition, a preliminary estimate indicates that a 2\\sigma\nsensitivity of establishing the terrestrial matter effects can be achieved for\nabout 10 years of data taking at JUNO with the help of a proper near detector\nimplementation.\n", "  A theory with a mass scale and yet Weyl invariant is presented. The theory is\nnot invariant under all diffeomorphisms but only under transverse ones. This is\nthe reason why Weyl invariance does not imply scale invariance in a free\nfalling frame. Physical implications of this framework are discussed.\n", "  We propose an extension of the standard model of quarks and leptons to\ninclude gauge $B-L$ symmetry with an exotic array of neutral fermion singlets\nfor anomaly cancellation. With the addition of suitable scalars also\ntransforming under $U(1)_{B-L}$, this becomes a model of radiative seesaw\nneutrino mass with possible multipartite dark matter. If leptoquark fermions\nare added, necessarily also transforming under $B-L$, the diphoton excess at\n750 GeV, recently observed at the Large Hadron Collider, may also be explained.\n", "  Weak gravitational lensing (WL) is one of the most powerful techniques to\nlearn about the dark sector of the universe. To extract the WL signal from\nastronomical observations, galaxy shapes must be measured and corrected for the\npoint spread function (PSF) of the imaging system with extreme accuracy. Future\nWL missions (such as the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope, WFIRST) will use\na family of hybrid nearinfrared CMOS detectors (HAWAII-4RG) that are untested\nfor accurate WL measurements. Like all image sensors, these devices are subject\nto conversion gain nonlinearities (voltage response to collected photo-charge)\nthat bias the shape and size of bright objects such as reference stars that are\nused in PSF determination. We study this type of detector nonlinearity (NL) and\nshow how to derive requirements on it from WFIRST PSF size and ellipticity\nrequirements. We simulate the PSF optical profiles expected for WFIRST and\nmeasure the fractional error in the PSF size and the absolute error in the PSF\nellipticity as a function of star magnitude and the NL model. For our nominal\nNL model (a quadratic correction), we find that, uncalibrated, NL can induce an\nerror of 0.01 (fractional size) and 0.00175 (absolute ellipticity error) in the\nH158 bandpass for the brightest unsaturated stars in WFIRST. In addition, our\nsimulations show that to limit the bias of the size and ellipticity errors in\nthe H158 band to approximately 10% of the estimated WFIRST error budget, the\nparameter of our quadratic NL model must be calibrated to about 1% and 2.4%,\nrespectively. We present a fitting formula that can be used to estimate WFIRST\ndetector NL requirements once a true PSF error budget is established.\n", "  Many observed giant planets lie on eccentric orbits. Such orbits could be the\nresult of strong scatterings with other giant planets. The same dynamical\ninstability that produces these scatterings may also cause habitable planets in\ninterior orbits to become ejected, destroyed, or be transported out of the\nhabitable zone. We say that a habitable planet has resilient habitability if it\nis able to avoid ejections and collisions and its orbit remains inside the\nhabitable zone. Here we model the orbital evolution of rocky planets in\nplanetary systems where giant planets become dynamically unstable. We measure\nthe resilience of habitable planets as a function of the observed, present-day\nmasses and orbits of the giant planets. We find that the survival rate of\nhabitable planets depends strongly on the giant planet architecture. Equal-mass\nplanetary systems are far more destructive than systems with giant planets of\nunequal masses. We also establish a link with observation; we find that giant\nplanets with present-day eccentricities higher than 0.4 almost never have a\nhabitable interior planet. For a giant planet with an present-day eccentricity\nof 0.2 and semimajor axis of 5 AU orbiting a Sun-like star, 50% of the orbits\nin the habitable zone are resilient to the instability. As semimajor axis\nincreases and eccentricity decreases, a higher fraction of habitable planets\nsurvive and remain habitable. However, if the habitable planet has rocky\nsiblings, there is a significant risk of rocky planet collisions that would\nsterilize the planet.\n", "  We study properties of a non equilibrium steady state generated when two heat\nbaths are initially in contact with one another. The dynamics of the system we\nstudy are governed by holographic duality in a large number of dimensions. We\ndiscuss the \"phase diagram\" associated with the steady state; the dual,\ndynamical, black hole description of this problem; and its relation to the\nfluid/gravity correspondence.\n", "  DNA oligomers with properly designed sequences self-assemble into well\ndefined constructs. Here, we exploit this methodology to produce bulk\nquantities of tetravalent DNA nanostars (each one composed by 196 nucleotides)\nand to explore the structural signatures of their aggregation process. We\nreport small-angle neutron scattering experiments focused on the evaluation of\nboth the form factor and the temperature evolution of the scattered intensity\nat a nano star concentration where the system forms a tetravalent equilibrium\ngel. We also perform molecular dynamics simulations of one isolated tetramer to\nevaluate the form factor theoretically, without resorting to any approximate\nshape. The numerical form factor is found to be in very good agreement with the\nexperimental one. Simulations predict an essentially temperature independent\nform factor, offering the possibility to extract the effective structure factor\nand its evolution during the equilibrium gelation.\n", "  In this work we introduce a geometric integrator for molecular dynamics\nsimulations of physical systems in the canonical ensemble. In particular, we\nconsider the equations arising from the so-called density dynamics algorithm\nwith any possible type of thermostat and provide an integrator that preserves\nthe invariant distribution. Our integrator thus constitutes a unified framework\nthat allows the study and comparison of different thermostats and of their\ninfluence on the equilibrium and non-equilibrium (thermo-)dynamic properties of\nthe system. To show the validity and the generality of the integrator, we\nimplement it with a second-order, time-reversible method and apply it to the\nsimulation of a Lennard-Jones system with three different thermostats,\nobtaining good conservation of the geometrical properties and recovering the\nexpected thermodynamic results.\n", "  Due to the recent restrictions deriving from the application of the Kyoto\nprotocol, the main components of the gas mixtures presently used in the\nResistive Plate Chambers systems of the LHC experiments will be most probably\nphased out of production in the coming years. Identifying possible replacements\nwith the adequate characteristics requires an intense R&D, which was recently\nstarted, also in collaborations across the various experiments. Possible\ncandidates have been proposed and are thoroughly investigated. Some tests on\none of the most promising candidate - HFO-1234ze, an allotropic form of\ntetrafluoropropane- have already been reported. Here an innovative approach,\nbased on the use of Helium, to solve the problems related to the too elevate\noperating voltage of HFO-1234ze based gas mixtures, is discussed and the\nrelative first results are shown.\n", "  We present observations towards a high-mass ($\\rm >40\\,M_{\\odot}$), low\nluminosity ($\\rm <10\\,L_{\\odot}$) $\\rm 70\\,\\mu$m dark molecular core G 28.34\nS-A at 3.4 mm, using the IRAM 30 m telescope and the NOEMA interferometer. We\nreport the detection of $\\rm SiO$ $J=\\rm 2\\rightarrow1$ line emission, which is\nspatially resolved in this source at a linear resolution of $\\sim$0.1 pc, while\nthe 3.4 mm continuum image does not resolve any internal sub-structures. The\nSiO emission exhibits two W-E oriented lobes centring on the continuum peak.\nCorresponding to the red-shifted and blue-shifted gas with velocities up to\n$\\rm 40\\,km\\,s^{-1}$ relative to the quiescent cloud, these lobes clearly\nindicate the presence of a strong bipolar outflow from this $\\rm 70\\,\\mu$m dark\ncore, a source previously considered as one of the best candidates of\n\"starless\" core. Our SiO detection is consistent with ALMA archival data of\n$\\rm SiO$ $J=\\rm 5\\rightarrow4$, whose high-velocity blue-shifted gas reveals a\nmore compact lobe spatially closer to the dust center. This outflow indicates\nthat the central source may be in an early evolutionary stage of forming a\nhigh-mass protostar. We also find that the low-velocity components (in the\nrange of $\\rm V_{lsr}$$\\rm_{-5}^{+3}\\,km\\,s^{-1}$) have an extended, NW-SE\noriented distribution. Discussing the possible accretion scenarios of the\noutflow-powering young stellar object, we argue that the molecular line\nemission and the molecular outflows may provide a better indication of the\naccretion history when forming young stellar object, than that from a snapshot\nobservations of the present bolometric luminosity. This is particularly\nsignificant for the cases of episodic accretion, which may occur during the\ncollapse of the parent molecular core.\n", "  The one-bit compressed sensing framework aims to reconstruct a sparse signal\nby only using the sign information of its linear measurements. To compensate\nfor the loss of scale information, past studies in the area have proposed\nrecovering the signal by imposing an additional constraint on the L2-norm of\nthe signal. Recently, an alternative strategy that captures scale information\nby introducing a threshold parameter to the quantization process was advanced.\nIn this paper, we analyze the typical behavior of the thresholding 1-bit\ncompressed sensing utilizing the replica method of statistical mechanics, so as\nto gain an insight for properly setting the threshold value. Our result shows\nthat, fixing the threshold at a constant value yields better performance than\nvarying it randomly when the constant is optimally tuned, statistically.\nUnfortunately, the optimal threshold value depends on the statistical\nproperties of the target signal, which may not be known in advance. In order to\nhandle this inconvenience, we develop a heuristic that adaptively tunes the\nthreshold parameter based on the frequency of positive (or negative) values in\nthe binary outputs. Numerical experiments show that the heuristic exhibits\nsatisfactory performance while incurring low computational cost.\n", "  We report on the linear optical properties of the chiral magnet Cu2OSeO3,\nspecifically associated with the absence of inversion symmetry, the chiral\ncrystallographic structure, and magnetic order. Through spectroscopic\nellipsometry, we observe local crystal-field excitations below the\ncharge-transfer gap. These crystal-field excitations are optically allowed due\nto the lack of inversion symmetry at the Cu sites. Optical polarization\nrotation measurements were used to study the structural chirality and magnetic\norder. The temperature dependence of the natural optical rotation, originating\nin the chiral crystal structure, provides evidence for a finite\nmagneto-electric effect in the helimagnetic phase. We find a large\nmagneto-optical susceptibility on the order of V(540nm)~10^4 rad/(T*m) in the\nhelimagnetic phase and a maximum Faraday rotation of ~165deg/mm in the\nferrimagnetic phase. The large value of V can be explained by considering spin\ncluster formation and the relative ease of domain reorientation in this\nmetamagnetic material. The magneto-optical activity allows us to map the\nmagnetic phase diagram, including the skyrmion lattice phase. In addition to\nthis, we probe and discuss the nature of the various magnetic phase transitions\nin Cu2OSeO3.\n", "  We prove, by a direct dimensional reduction and an explicit construction of\nthe group manifold, that the nonlinear sigma model of the dimensionally reduced\nthree-dimensional A = R magical supergravity is F4(+4)/(USp(6)xSU(2)). This\nserves as a basis for the solution generating technique in this supergravity as\nwell as allows to give the Lie algebraic characterizations to some of the\nparameters and functions in the original D = 5 Lagrangian. Generalizations to\nother magical supergravities are also discussed.\n", "  Certain dissipative systems, such as Caldirola and Kannai's damped simple\nharmonic oscillator, may be modelled by time-dependent Lagrangian and hence\ntime dependent Hamiltonian systems with $n$ degrees of freedom. In this paper\nwe treat these systems, their projective and conformal symmetries as well as\ntheir quantisation from the point of view of the Eisenhart lift to a Bargmann\nspacetime in $n+2$ dimensions, equipped with its covariantly constant null\nKilling vector field. Reparametrization of the time variable corresponds to\nconformal rescalings of the Bargmann metric. We show how the Arnold map lifts\nto Bargmann spacetime. We contrast the greater generality of the\nCaldirola-Kannai approach with that of Arnold and Bateman. At the level of\nquantum mechanics, we are able to show how the relevant Schr\\\"odinger equation\nemerges naturally using the techniques of quantum field theory in curved\nspacetimes, since a covariantly constant null Killing vector field gives rise\nto well defined one particle Hilbert space. Time-dependent Lagrangians arise\nnaturally also in cosmology and give rise to the phenomenon of Hubble friction.\nWe provide an account of this for Friedmann-Lemaitre and Bianchi cosmologies\nand how it fits in with our previous discussion in the non-relativistic limit.\n", "  We report molecular beam epitaxial growth of a SnTe (111) layer on a CdTe\ntemplate, fabricated by depositing it on a GaAs (111)A substrate, instead of\nBaF$_2$ which has been conventionally used as a substrate. By optimizing\ntemperatures for the growth of both SnTe and CdTe layers, we could obtain SnTe\nlayers of the single phase grown only in the (111) orientation and of much\nimproved surface morphology from the viewpoint of the extension and the\nflatness of flat regions, compared to the layers grown on BaF$_2$. In this\noptimal growth condition, we have also achieved a low hole density of the order\nof 10$^{17}$cm$^{-3}$ at 4K, the lowest value ever reported for SnTe thin films\nwithout additional doping. In the magnetoresistance measurement on this\noptimized SnTe layer, we observe characteristic negative magneto-conductance\nwhich is attributed to the weak antilocalization effect of the two-dimensional\ntransport in the topological surface state.\n", "  What effect do particle-emitting resonances have on the scattering cross\nsection? What physical considerations are necessary when modelling these\nresonances? These questions are important when theoretically describing\nscattering experiments with radioactive ion beams which investigate the\nfrontiers of the table of nuclides, far from stability. Herein, a novel method\nis developed that describes resonant nuclear scattering from which centroids\nand widths in the compound nucleus are obtained when one of the interacting\nbodies has particle unstable resonances. The method gives cross sections\nwithout unphysical behavior that is found if simple Lorentzian forms are used\nto describe resonant target states. The resultant cross sections differ\nsignificantly from those obtained when the states in the coupled channel\ncalculations are taken to have zero width, and compound-system resonances are\nbetter matched to observed values.\n", "  We study a radiative neutrino model with a SU(2) septet scalar with\nhypercharge $Y=2$ where active neutrino mass is induced at a one-loop level.\nCalculating a one-loop diagram, mass matrices for active neutrino is derived.\nWe also analyze lepton flavor violations, anomalous magnetic moment of muon and\nthe flavor violating Higgs decay $h \\to \\mu \\tau$. Then sizable muon $g-2$ and\n$\\sim 1 \\%$ of $BR(h \\to \\mu \\tau)$ could be obtained in our set up.\nFurthermore, the collider signature of the septet is discussed where we focus\non quadratically charged scalar at the LHC 14 TeV. We find that it could be\ndiscovered up to $1.5$ TeV mass by searching multi charged lepton signal\nevents.\n", "  D3 branes stretching between webs of (p,q) 5branes provide an interesting\nclass of 3d N=2 theories. For generic pq-webs however the low energy field\ntheory is not known. We use 3d mirror symmetry and Type IIB S-duality to\nconstruct Abelian gauge theories corresponding to D3 branes ending on both\nsides of a pq-web made of many coincident NS5's intersecting one D5. These\ntheories contain chiral monopole operators in the superpotential and enjoy a\nnon trivial pattern of global symmetry enhancements. In the special case of the\npq-web with one D5 and one NS5, the 3d low energy SCFT admits three dual\nformulations. This triality can be applied locally inside bigger quiver gauge\ntheories. We prove our statements using partial mirror symmetry `a la\nKapustin-Strassler, showing the equality of the S^3_b partition functions and\nstudying the quantum chiral rings.\n", "  We consider QCD radiative corrections to $W^+W^-$ production at the LHC and\npresent the first fully differential predictions for this process at\nnext-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in perturbation theory. Our computation\nconsistently includes the leptonic decays of the $W$ bosons, taking into\naccount spin correlations, off-shell effects and non-resonant contributions.\nDetailed predictions are presented for the different-flavour channel\n$pp\\to\\mu^+e^-\\nu_\\mu {\\bar \\nu}_e+X$ at $\\sqrt{s}=8$ and $13$ TeV. In\nparticular, we discuss fiducial cross sections and distributions in the\npresence of standard selection cuts used in experimental $W^+W^-$ and $H\\to\nW^+W^-$ analyses at the LHC. The inclusive $W^+W^-$ cross section receives\nlarge NNLO corrections, and, due to the presence of a jet veto, typical\nfiducial cuts have a sizeable influence on the behaviour of the perturbative\nexpansion. The availability of differential NNLO predictions, both for\ninclusive and fiducial observables, will play an important role in the rich\nphysics programme that is based on precision studies of $W^+W^-$ signatures at\nthe LHC.\n", "  We study quantum mechanical tunneling using complex solutions of the\nclassical field equations. Simple visualization techniques allow us to unify\nand generalize previous treatments, and straightforwardly show the connection\nto the standard approach using Euclidean instanton solutions. We demonstrate\nthat the negative modes of solutions along various contours in the complex time\nplane reveal which paths give the leading contribution to tunneling and which\ndo not, and we provide a criterion for identifying the negative modes. Central\nto our approach is the solution of the background and perturbation equations\nnot only along a single path, but over an extended region of the complex time\nplane. Our approach allows for a fully continuous and coherent treatment of\nclassical evolution interspersed by quantum tunneling events, and is applicable\nin situations where singularities are present and also where Euclidean\nsolutions might not exist.\n", "  We theoretically demonstrate a simple way to significantly enhance the\nspin/valley polarizations and tunnel- ing magnetoresistnace (TMR) in a\nferromagnetic-normal-ferromagnetic (FNF) silicene junction by applying a\ncircularly polarized light in off-resonant regime to the second ferromagnetic\n(FM) region. We show that the fully spin-polarized current can be realized in\ncertain ranges of light intensity. Increasing the incident energy in the\npresence of light will induce a transition of perfect spin polarization from\npositive to negative or vice versa depending on magnetic configuration\n(parallel or anti-parallel) of FNF junction. Additionally, under a circularly\npolarized light, valley polarization is very sensitive to electric field and\nthe perfect valley polarization can be achieved even when staggered electric\nfield is much smaller than exchange field. The most important result we would\nlike to emphasize in this paper is that the perfect spin polarization and 100%\nTMR induced by a circularly polarized light are completely independent of\nbarrier height in normal region. Furthermore, the sign reversal of TMR can be\nobserved when the polarized direction of light is changed. A condition for\nobserving the 100% TMR is also reported. Our results are expected to be\ninformative for real applications of FNF silicene junction, especially in\nspintronics.\n", "  To overcome the signal disturbance from the transmission process, recently, a\nnew type of protocol named round-robin differential-phase-shift(RRDPS) quantum\nkey distribution[Nature 509, 475(2014)] is proposed. It can estimate how much\ninformation has leaked to eavesdropper without monitoring bit error rates. In\nthis paper, we compare the performance of RRDPS using different sources without\nand with decoy-state method, such as weak coherent pulses(WCPs) and heralded\nsingle photon source(HSPS). For practical implementations, we propose finite\ndecoy-state method for RRDPS, the performance of which is close to the infinite\none. Taking WCPs as an example, the three-intensity decoystate protocol can\ndistribute secret keys over a distance of 128 km when the length of pulses\npacket is 32, which confirms the great practical interest of our method.\n", "  The equilibrium properties of hard rod monolayers are investigated in a\nlattice model (where position and orientation of a rod are restricted to\ndiscrete values) as well as in an off--lattice model featuring spherocylinders\nwith continuous positional and orientational degrees of freedom. Both models\nare treated using density functional theory and Monte Carlo simulations. Upon\nincreasing the density of rods in the monolayer, there is a continuous ordering\nof the rods along the monolayer normal (\"standing up\" transition). The\ncontinuous transition also persists in the case of an external potential which\nfavors flat--lying rods in the monolayer. This behavior is found in both the\nlattice and the continuum model. For the lattice model, we find very good\nagreement between the results from the specific DFT used (lattice fundamental\nmeasure theory) and simulations. The properties of lattice fundamental measure\ntheory are further illustrated by the phase diagrams of bulk hard rods in two\nand three dimensions.\n", "  We introduce and study twelve multivariable theta functions defined by\npfaffians with elliptic function entries. We show that, when the crossing\nparameter is a cubic root of unity, the domain wall partition function for the\neight-vertex-solid-on-solid model can be written as a sum of two of these\npfaffians. As a limit case, we express the domain wall partition function for\nthe three-colour model as a sum of two Hankel determinants. We also show that\ncertain solutions of the TQ-equation for the supersymmetric eight-vertex model\ncan be expressed in terms of elliptic pfaffians.\n", "  We construct several dynamical supersymmetry breaking (DSB) models within a\nsingle ten-dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theory, compactified on\nmagnetized tori with or without orbifolding. We study the case that the\nsupersymmetry breaking is triggered by a strong dynamics of $SU(N_C)$ SYM\ntheory with $N_F$ flavors contained in the four-dimensional effective theory.\nWe show several configurations of magnetic fluxes and orbifolds, those\npotentially yield, below the compactification scale, the field contents and\ncouplings required for triggering DSB. We especially find a class of\nself-complete DSB models on orbifolds, where all the extra fields are\neliminated by the orbifold projection and DSB successfully occurs within the\ngiven framework. Comments on some perspectives for associating the obtained DSB\nmodels with the other sectors, such as the visible sector and another hidden\nsector for, e.g., stabilizing moduli, are also given.\n", "  We present the integrand decomposition of multiloop scattering amplitudes in\nparallel and orthogonal space-time dimensions, $d=d_\\parallel+d_\\perp$, being\n$d_\\parallel$ the dimension of the parallel space spanned by the legs of the\ndiagrams. When the number $n$ of external legs is $n\\le 4$, the corresponding\nrepresentation of the multiloop integrals exposes a subset of integration\nvariables which can be easily integrated away by means of Gegenbauer\npolynomials orthogonality condition. By decomposing the integration momenta\nalong parallel and orthogonal directions, the polynomial division algorithm is\ndrastically simplified. Moreover, the orthogonality conditions of Gegenbauer\npolynomials can be suitably applied to integrate the decomposed integrand,\nyielding the systematic annihilation of spurious terms. Consequently, multiloop\namplitudes are expressed in terms of integrals corresponding to irreducible\nscalar products of loop momenta and external momenta. We revisit the one-loop\ndecomposition, which turns out to be controlled by the maximum-cut theorem in\ndifferent dimensions, and we discuss the integrand reduction of two-loop planar\nand non-planar integrals up to $n=8$ legs, for arbitrary external and internal\nkinematics. The proposed algorithm extends to all orders in perturbation\ntheory.\n", "  We investigate the process of reionisation in a model in which the dark\nmatter is a warm elementary particle such as a sterile neutrino. We focus on\nmodels that are consistent with the dark matter decay interpretation of the\nrecently detected line at 3.5 keV in the X-ray spectra of galaxies and\nclusters. In warm dark matter models the primordial spectrum of density\nperturbations has a cut-off on the scale of dwarf galaxies. Structure formation\ntherefore begins later than in the standard cold dark matter (CDM) model and\nvery few objects form below the cut-off mass scale. To calculate the number of\nionising photons, we use the Durham semi-analytic model of galaxy formation,\nGALFORM. We find that even the most extreme 7 keV sterile neutrino we consider\nis able to reionise the Universe early enough to be compatible with the bounds\non the epoch of reionisation from Planck. This, perhaps surprising, result\narises from the rapid build-up of high redshift galaxies in the sterile\nneutrino models which is also reflected in a faster evolution of their far-UV\nluminosity function between $10>z>7$ than in CDM. The dominant sources of\nionising photons are systematically more massive in the sterile neutrino models\nthan in CDM. As a consistency check on the models, we calculate the present-day\nluminosity function of satellites of Milky Way-like galaxies. When the\nsatellites recently discovered in the DES survey are taken into account, strong\nconstraints are placed on viable sterile neutrino models.\n", "  Graphene/carbon-nanotube (CNT) hybrid material can be useful in energy\nstorage and nanoelectronic technologies. Here we address the CNT-oscillator\nencapsulated in a graphene-nanoribbon (GNR) trench as a novel design, and\ninvestigate its properties via classical molecular dynamics simulations. Since\nthe energy barrier was very low while the CNT was encapsulated in the GNR\ntrench, the CNT absorbed on the GNR surface could easily be encapsulated in the\nGNR trench. MD simulations showed that the CNT oscillator encapsulated in a GNR\ntrench is compatible with simple CNT oscillators, so we anticipate that the CNT\nin GNR trench could work as an oscillator. So we can anticipate that the CNT\nencapsulated in a GNR trench can be applied to ultra-sensitive\nnanoelectromechanical oscillators, and this system has the possibility to be\napplied to relay-switching devices, and to shuttle memory.\n", "  Magnetic reconnection, the rearrangement of magnetic field topology, is a\nfundamental physical process in magnetized plasma systems all over the\nuniverse1,2. Its process is difficult to be directly observed. Coronal\nstructures, such as coronal loops and filament spines, often sketch the\nmagnetic field geometry and its changes in the solar corona3. Here we show a\nhighly suggestive observation of magnetic reconnection between an erupting\nsolar filament and its nearby coronal loops, resulting in changes in connection\nof the filament. X-type structures form when the erupting filament encounters\nthe loops. The filament becomes straight, and bright current sheets form at the\ninterfaces with the loops. Many plasmoids appear in these current sheets and\npropagate bi-directionally. The filament disconnects from the current sheets,\nwhich gradually disperse and disappear, reconnects to the loops, and becomes\nredirected to the loop footpoints. This evolution of the filament and the loops\nsuggests successive magnetic reconnection predicted by theories1 but rarely\ndetected with such clarity in observations. Our results on the formation,\nevolution, and disappearance of current sheets, confirm three-dimensional\nmagnetic reconnection theory and have implications for the evolution of\ndissipation regions and the release of magnetic energy for reconnection in many\nmagnetized plasma systems.\n", "  The near field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) is not only a tool for\nimaging of sub-diffraction limited objects but also a prominent characteristic\ntool for understanding the intrinsic properties of the nanostructures. In order\nto understand the light-matter interactions in the near field regime using NSOM\ntechnique with an excitation of 532 nm (2.33 eV), we selected an isolated\nsingle semiconducting AlGaN nanowire (NW) of diameter ~120 nm grown via vapor\nliquid solid (VLS) mechanism along with metallic Au nanoparticle (NP) catalyst.\nThe role of electronic transitions from different native defect related energy\nstates of AlGaN are discussed in understanding the NSOM images for the\nsemiconducting NW. The effect of strong surface plasmon resonance absorption of\nexcitation laser in the NSOM images for Au NP, involved in the VLS growth\nmechanism of NWs, is also observed. Keywo\n", "  This work presents the publicly available moving-mesh magnetohydrodynamics\ncode DISCO. DISCO is efficient and accurate at evolving orbital fluid motion in\ntwo and three dimensions, especially at high Mach number. DISCO employs a\nmoving-mesh approach utilizing a dynamic cylindrical mesh that can shear\nazimuthally to follow the orbital motion of the gas. The moving mesh removes\ndiffusive advection errors and allows for longer timesteps than a static grid.\nMagnetohydrodynamics is implemented in DISCO using an HLLD Riemann solver and a\nnovel constrained transport scheme which is compatible with the mesh motion.\nDISCO is tested against a wide variety of problems, which are designed to test\nits stability, accuracy and scalability. In addition, several\nmagnetohydrodynamics tests are performed which demonstrate the accuracy and\nstability of the new constrained transport approach, including two tests of the\nmagneto-rotational instability (MRI); one testing the linear growth rate and\nthe other following the instability into the fully turbulent regime.\n", "  The $S$-matrix of a quantum field theory is unchanged by field redefinitions,\nand so only depends on geometric quantities such as the curvature of field\nspace. Whether the Higgs multiplet transforms linearly or non-linearly under\nelectroweak symmetry is a subtle question since one can make a coordinate\nchange to convert a field that transforms linearly into one that transforms\nnon-linearly. Renormalizability of the Standard Model (SM) does not depend on\nthe choice of scalar fields or whether the scalar fields transform linearly or\nnon-linearly under the gauge group, but only on the geometric requirement that\nthe scalar field manifold ${\\mathcal M}$ is flat. We explicitly compute the\none-loop correction to scalar scattering in the SM written in non-linear\nCallan-Coleman-Wess-Zumino (CCWZ) form, where it has an infinite series of\nhigher dimensional operators, and show that the $S$-matrix is finite. Standard\nModel Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and Higgs Effective Field Theory (HEFT)\nhave curved ${\\mathcal M}$, since they parametrize deviations from the flat SM\ncase. We show that the HEFT Lagrangian can be written in SMEFT form if and only\nif ${\\cal M}$ has a $SU(2)_L \\times U(1)_Y$ invariant fixed point. Experimental\nobservables in HEFT depend on local geometric invariants of ${\\mathcal M}$ such\nas sectional curvatures, which are of order $1/\\Lambda^2$, where $\\Lambda$ is\nthe EFT scale. We give explicit expressions for these quantities in terms of\nthe structure constants for a general $\\mathcal G \\to \\mathcal H$ symmetry\nbreaking pattern. (Full abstract in pdf)\n", "  The strain effect on electronic structure and thermoelectric properties of\nHigher Manganese Silicides (HMSs) Mn4Si7 was studied using Density Functional\nTheory (DFT) and through solving Boltzman Transport Equation (BTE). We found\nthat the tensile strain attempts to reduce the band gap while the compressive\nstrain not much affect to band gap. The Seebeck coeficient was found to be\nincreased with increasing temperature, which is very consistent to experiments.\nThe electrical conductivity and power factor show highly degree of anisotropy,\nwhere in-plane direction is more dominant. The different behavior of electrical\nconductivity along in-plane and outof plane direction was explained due to the\nchange of band dispersion in the valence band maximum (VBM).\n", "  We study the impact of the valence and the geometry on the electronic\nstructure and transport properties of different transition metal-benzene\nsandwich molecules bridging the tips of a Cu nanocontact. Our\ndensity-functional calculations show that the electronic transport properties\nof the molecules depend strongly on the molecular geometry which can be\ncontrolled by the nanocontact tips. Depending on the valence of the transition\nmetal center certain molecules can be tuned in and out of half-metallic\nbehaviour facilitating potential spintronics applications. We also discuss our\nresults in the framework of an Anderson impurity model, indicating cases where\nthe inclusion of local correlations alters the ground state qualitatively. For\nCo and V centered molecules we find indications of an orbital Kondo effect.\n", "  We investigate the driven polymer translocation through a nanometer-scale\npore in the presence and absence of hydrodynamics both in good and bad solvent.\nWe present our results on tension propagating along the polymer segment on the\ncis-side that is measured for the first time using our method that works also\nin the presence of hydrodynamics. For simulations we use stochastic rotation\ndynamics, also called multi-particle collision dynamics. We find that in the\ngood solvent the tension propagates very similarly whether hydrodynamics is\nincluded or not. Only the tensed segment is by a constant factor shorter in the\npresence of hydrodynamics. The shorter tensed segment and the hydrodynamic\ninteractions contribute to a smaller friction for the translocating polymer\nwhen hydrodynamics is included, which shows as smaller waiting times and a\nsmaller exponent in the scaling of the translocation time with the polymer\nlength. In the bad solvent hydrodynamics has a minimal effect on polymer\ntranslocation in contrast to the good solvent where it speeds up translocation.\nWe find that under bad-solvent conditions tension does not spread appreciably\nalong the polymer. Consequently, translocation time does not scale with the\npolymer length. By measuring the effective friction in a setup where a polymer\nin free solvent is pulled by a constant force at the end, we find that\nhydrodynamics does speed up collective polymer motion in the bad solvent even\nmore effectively than in the good solvent. However, hydrodynamics has a\nnegligible effect on the motion of individual monomers within the highly\ncorrelated globular conformation on the cis-side and hence on the entire driven\ntranslocation under bad-solvent conditions.\n", "  We fit the $\\sim$0.1-500 MeV/nucleon H-Fe spectra in 46 large SEP events\nsurveyed by Desai et al. (2016) with the double power-law Band function to\nobtain a normalization constant, low- and high-energy parameters $\\gamma_a$ and\n$\\gamma_b$; and break energy $E_B$. We also calculate the low-energy power-law\nspectral slope $\\gamma_1$. We find that: 1) $\\gamma_a$, $\\gamma_1$, and\n$\\gamma_b$ are species-independent within a given SEP event, and the spectra\nsteepen with increasing energy; 2) $E_B$'s are well ordered by Q/M ratio, and\ndecrease systematically with decreasing Q/M, scaling as (Q/M)$^\\alpha$ with\n$\\alpha$ varying between $\\sim$0.2-3; 3) $\\alpha$ is well correlated with Fe/O\nat $\\sim$0.16-0.23 MeV/nucleon and CME speed; 4) In most events: $\\alpha<$1.4,\nthe spectra steepen significantly at higher energy with $\\gamma_b$-$\\gamma_a\n>$3; and 5) Seven out of 9 extreme SEP events (associated with faster CMEs and\nGLEs) are Fe-rich, have $\\alpha >$1.4, have flatter spectra at low and high\nenergies with $\\gamma_b$-$\\gamma_a <$3. The species-independence of $\\gamma_a$,\n$\\gamma_1$, and $\\gamma_b$ and the systematic Q/M dependence of $E_B$ within an\nevent, as well as the range of values for $\\alpha$ suggest that the formation\nof double power-laws in SEP events occurs primarily due to diffusive\nacceleration at near-Sun CME shocks and not due to scattering in the\ninterplanetary turbulence. In most events, the Q/M-dependence of $E_B$ is\nconsistent with the equal diffusion coefficient condition while the\nevent-to-event variations in $\\alpha$ are probably driven by differences in the\nnear-shock wave intensity spectra, which are flatter than the Kolmogorov\nturbulence spectrum but still weaker compared to that inferred for the extreme\nevents.\n", "  This paper reports the occurrence of several chimera patterns and the\nassociated transitions among them in a network of coupled oscillators, which\nare connected by a long range interaction that obeys a distance-dependent power\nlaw. This type of interaction is common in physics and biology and constitutes\na general form of coupling scheme, where by tuning the power-law exponent of\nthe long range interaction the coupling topology can be varied from local via\nnonlocal to global coupling. To explore the effect of the power-law coupling on\ncollective dynamics, we consider a network consisting of a realistic ecological\nmodel of oscillating populations, namely the Rosenzweig--MacArthur model, and\nshow that the variation of the power-law exponent mediates transitions between\nspatial synchrony and various chimera patterns. We map the possible\nspatiotemporal states and their scenarios that arise due to the interplay\nbetween the coupling strength and the power-law exponent.\n", "  We present a simple general proof that Casimir force cannot originate from\nthe vacuum energy of electromagnetic (EM) field. The full QED Hamiltonian\nconsists of 3 terms: the pure electromagnetic term $H_{\\rm em}$, the pure\nmatter term $H_{\\rm matt}$ and the interaction term $H_{\\rm int}$. The $H_{\\rm\nem}$-term commutes with all matter fields because it does not have any explicit\ndependence on matter fields. As a consequence, $H_{\\rm em}$ cannot generate any\nforces on matter. Since it is precisely this term that generates the vacuum\nenergy of EM field, it follows that the vacuum energy does not generate the\nforces. The misleading statements in the literature that vacuum energy\ngenerates Casimir force can be boiled down to the fact that $H_{\\rm em}$\nattains an implicit dependence on matter fields by the use of the equations of\nmotion and the illegitimate treatment of the implicit dependence as if it was\nexplicit. The true origin of the Casimir force is van der Waals force generated\nby $H_{\\rm int}$.\n", "  The recrossing correction to the transition state theory estimate of a\nthermal rate can be difficult to calculate when the energy barrier is flat.\nThis problem arises, for example, in polymer escape if the polymer is long\nenough to stretch between the initial and final state energy wells while the\npolymer beads undergo diffusive motion back and forth over the barrier. We\npresent an efficient method for evaluating the correction factor by\nconstructing a sequence of hyperplanes starting at the transition state and\ncalculating the probability that the system advances from one hyperplane to\nanother towards the product. This is analogous to what is done in forward flux\nsampling except that there the hyperplane sequence starts at the initial state.\nThe method is applied to the escape of polymers with up to 64 beads from a\npotential well. For high temperature, the results are compared with direct\nLangevin dynamics simulations as well as forward flux sampling and excellent\nagreement between the three rate estimates is found. The use of a sequence of\nhyperplanes in the evaluation of the recrossing correction speeds up the\ncalculation by an order of magnitude as compared with the traditional approach.\nAs the temperature is lowered, the direct Langevin dynamics simulations as well\nas the forward flux simulations become computationally too demanding, while the\nharmonic transition state theory estimate corrected for recrossings can be\ncalculated without significant increase in the computational effort.\n", "  Electron beam induced current (EBIC) is a powerful characterization technique\nwhich offers the high spatial resolution needed to study polycrystalline solar\ncells. Current models of EBIC assume that excitations in the $p$-$n$ junction\ndepletion region result in perfect charge collection efficiency. However we\nfind that in CdTe and Si samples prepared by focused ion beam (FIB) milling,\nthere is a reduced and nonuniform EBIC lineshape for excitations in the\ndepletion region. Motivated by this, we present a model of the EBIC response\nfor excitations in the depletion region which includes the effects of surface\nrecombination from both charge-neutral and charged surfaces. For neutral\nsurfaces we present a simple analytical formula which describes the numerical\ndata well, while the charged surface response depends qualitatively on the\nlocation of the surface Fermi level relative to the bulk Fermi level. We find\nthe experimental data on FIB-prepared Si solar cells is most consistent with a\ncharged surface, and discuss the implications for EBIC experiments on\npolycrystalline materials.\n", "  We use effective kinetic theory, accurate at weak coupling, to simulate the\npre-equilibrium evolution of transverse energy and flow perturbations in\nheavy-ion collisions. We provide a Green function which propagates the initial\nperturbations to the energy-momentum tensor at a time when hydrodynamics\nbecomes applicable. With this map, the complete pre-thermal evolution from\nsaturated nuclei to hydrodynamics can be modelled in a perturbatively\ncontrolled way.\n", "  Stars that pass within the Roche radius of a supermassive black hole will be\ntidally disrupted, yielding a sudden injection of gas close to the black hole\nhorizon which produces an electromagnetic flare. A few dozen of these flares\nhave been discovered in recent years, but current observations provide poor\nconstraints on the bolometric luminosity and total accreted mass of these\nevents. Using images from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), we\nhave discovered transient 3.4 micron emission from several previously known\ntidal disruption flares. The observations can be explained by dust heated to\nits sublimation temperature due to the intense radiation of the tidal flare.\nFrom the break in the infrared light curve we infer that this hot dust is\nlocated ~0.1 pc from the supermassive black hole. Since the dust has been\nheated by absorbing UV and (potentially) soft X-ray photons of the flare, the\nreprocessing light curve yields an estimate of the bolometric flare luminosity.\nFor the flare PTF-09ge, we infer that the most likely value of the luminosity\nintegrated over frequencies at which dust can absorb photons is $8\\times\n10^{44}$ erg/s, with a factor of 3 uncertainty due to the unknown temperature\nof the dust. This bolometric luminosity is a factor ~10 larger than the\nobserved black body luminosity. Our work is the first to probe dust in the\nnuclei of non-active galaxies on sub-parsec scales. The observed infrared\nluminosity implies a covering factor ~1% for the nuclear dust in the host\ngalaxies.\n", "  We report the discovery and classification of SDSS~J053341.43+001434.1\n(SDSS0533), an early-L dwarf first discovered during a powerful $\\Delta V <\n-11$ magnitude flare observed as part of the ASAS-SN survey. Optical and\ninfrared spectroscopy indicate a spectral type of L0 with strong H$\\alpha$\nemission and a blue NIR spectral slope. Combining the photometric distance,\nproper motion, and radial velocity of SDSS0533 yields three-dimensional\nvelocities of $(U,V,W)=(14\\pm13,-35\\pm14,-94\\pm22)$~km~s$^{-1}$, indicating\nthat it is most likely part of the thick disk population and probably old. The\nthree detections of SDSS0533 obtained during the flare are consistent with a\ntotal $V$-band flare energy of at least $4.9\\times10^{33}$~ergs (corresponding\nto a total thermal energy of at least $E_{\\rm tot}>3.7\\times10^{34}$~erg),\nplacing it among the strongest detected M dwarf flares. The presence of this\npowerful flare on an old L0 dwarf may indicate that stellar-type magnetic\nactivity persists down to the end of the main sequence and on older ML\ntransition dwarfs.\n", "  Abdus Salam was a true master of 20th Century Theoretical Physics. Not only\nwas he a pioneer of the Standard Model (for which he shared the Nobel Prize\nwith S. Glashow and S.Weinberg), but he also (co)authored many other\noutstanding contributions to the field of Fundamental Interactions and their\nunification. In particular, he was a major contributor to the development of\nsupersymmetric theories, where he also coined the word \"Supersymmetry\"\n(replacing the earlier \"Supergauges\" drawn from String Theory). He also\nintroduced the basic concept of \"Superspace\" and the notion of \"Goldstone\nFermion\"(Goldstino). These concepts proved instrumental for the exploration of\nthe ultraviolet properties and for the study of spontaneously broken phases of\nsuper Yang-Mills theories and Supergravity. They continue to play a key role in\ncurrent developments in Early-Universe Cosmology. In this contribution we\nreview models of inflation based on Supergravity with spontaneously broken\nlocal supersymmetry, with emphasis on the role of nilpotent superfields to\ndescribe a de Sitter phase of our Universe.\n", "  We introduce via perturbation a class of random walks in reversible dynamic\nenvironments having a spectral gap. In this setting one can apply the\nmathematical results derived in http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06322. As first\nresults, we show that the asymptotic velocity is antisymmetric in the\nperturbative parameter and, for a subclass of random walks, we characterize the\nvelocity and a stationary distribution of the environment seen from the walker\nas suitable series in the perturbative parameter. We then consider as a special\ncase a random walk on the East model that tends to follow dynamical interfaces\nbetween empty and occupied regions. We study the asymptotic velocity and\ndensity profile for the environment seen from the walker. In particular, we\ndetermine the sign of the velocity when the density of the underlying East\nprocess is not 1/2, and we discuss the appearance of a drift in the balanced\nsetting given by density 1/2.\n", "  The $\\rho (770)$ meson is the most extensively studied resonance in lattice\nQCD simulations in two ($N_f=2$) and three ($N_f=2+1$) flavor formulations. We\nanalyze $N_f=2$ lattice scattering data using unitarized Chiral Perturbation\nTheory, allowing not only for the extrapolation in mass but also in flavor,\n$N_f=2\\to N_f=2+1$. The flavor extrapolation requires information from a global\nfit to $\\pi\\pi$ and $\\pi K$ phase shifts from experiment. While the chiral\nextrapolation of $N_f=2$ lattice data leads to masses of the $\\rho(770)$ meson\nfar below the experimental one, we find that the missing $K\\bar{K}$ channel is\nable to explain this discrepancy.\n", "  We present NIR synthetic spectra based on PHOENIX stellar atmosphere models\nof typical early and mid M dwarfs with varied C and O abundances. We apply\nmultiple recently published methods for determining M dwarf metallicity to our\nmodels to determine the effect of C and O abundances on metallicity indicators.\nWe find that the pseudo-continuum level is very sensitive to C/O and that all\nmetallicity indicators show a dependence on C and O abundances, especially in\nlower Teff models. In some cases the inferred metallicity ranges over a full\norder of magnitude (>1 dex) when [C/Fe] and [O/Fe] are varied independently by\n+/-0.2. We also find that [(O-C)/Fe], the difference in O and C abundances, is\na better tracer of the pseudo-continuum level than C/O. Models of mid-M dwarfs\nwith [C/Fe], [O/Fe], and [M/H] that are realistic in the context of galactic\nchemical evolution suggest that variation in [(O-C)/Fe] is the primary physical\nmechanism behind the M dwarf metallicity tracers investigated here. Empirically\ncalibrated metallicity indicators are still valid for most nearby M dwarfs due\nto the tight correlation between [(O-C)/Fe] and [Fe/H] evident in spectroscopic\nsurveys of solar neighborhood FGK stars. Variations in C and O abundances also\naffect the spectral energy distribution of M dwarfs. Allowing [O/Fe] to be a\nfree parameter provides better agreement between synthetic spectra and observed\nspectra of metal-rich M dwarfs. We suggest that flux-calibrated,\nlow-resolution, NIR spectra can provide a path toward measuring C and O\nabundances in M dwarfs and breaking the degeneracy between C/O and [Fe/H]\npresent in M dwarf metallicity indicators.\n", "  We consider the effect of the Sudakov factor in photon-initiated processes,\ncorresponding to the no branching probability for the initial-state photon. We\ndemonstrate how such a factor follows simply from the solution of the DGLAP\nequation for the photon PDF, and is therefore included automatically by this.\nWe use this result to argue that the appropriate scale for the QED coupling\n$\\alpha$ associated with an initial-state photon is not the virtuality of the\nphoton, but rather the factorization scale at which the photon PDF is\nevaluated, and therefore that the use of the on-shell renormalization scheme is\nnot appropriate for such processes. We also discuss exclusive photon-initiated\nprocesses, and demonstrate that no explicit Sudakov factor is required in this\ncase.\n", "  We study the frequency-dependent structure of electronic self-energy in the\npseudogap and superconducting states of the two-dimensional Hubbard model. We\npresent the self-energy calculated with the cellular dynamical mean-field\ntheory systematically in the space of temperature, electron density, and\ninteraction strength. We show that the low-frequency part of the self-energy is\nwell represented by a simple equation, which describes the transitions of an\nelectron to and from a hidden fermionic state. By fitting the numerical data\nwith this simple equation, we determine the parameters characterizing the\nhidden fermion and discuss its identity. The simple expression of the\nself-energy offers a way to organize numerical data of this uncomprehended\nsuperconducting and pseudogap states, as well as a useful tool to analyze\nspectroscopic experimental results. The successful description by the simple\ntwo-component fermion model supports the idea of \"dark\" and \"bright\" fermions\nemerging from a bare electron as bistable excitations in doped Mott insulators.\n", "  This study examines the increasing complexity in the magnetic properties of\nsmall $n$ = 3, 4, 5, 6 spin-1/2 quantum rings. Using an exact diagonalization\nof the isotropic Heisenberg Hamiltonian with nearest and next-nearest neighbor\ninteractions, the energy eigenstates, magnetic specific heat capacity, magnetic\nsusceptibility, and inelastic neutron scattering structure factors are\ndetermined for variable next-nearest neighbor interactions. Here, it is shown\nthat the presence of a complex spin-mixing, multiple ground states, and\nnon-zero ground states greatly complicate the spin Hamiltonian. Overall, the\nenergy eigenstates and structure factor intensities are presented in closed\nform, while the thermodynamic properties detail the effect of a crossing\ninteraction in the rings. The goal of this work is to provide insight into the\nevolution of the magnetic properties and spin excitations within these systems.\n", "  We report on a flow sensing approach based on deflection monitoring of micro\nbeams buckled by the compressive thermal stress due to electrothermal Joules\nheating. The air stream convectively cooling the device affects both the\ncritical buckling values of the electric current and the postbuckling\ndeflections of the structure. After calibration, the flow velocity was obtained\nfrom the deflections measurements. The quasi-static responses of 2000 microns\nlong, 10 microns wide and 30 microns high single crystal silicon beam\ntransduced using image processing were consistent with the prediction of the\nreduced order model, which couples thermoelectric, thermofluidic and structural\ndomains. The deflection sensitivity of 1.5 microns/(m/s) and the critical\ncurrent sensitivity of 0.4 mA/(m/s) were registered in the experiments. Our\nmodel and experimental results collectively demonstrate feasibility of the\nsensing approach and further suggest that simple, robust and potentially\ndownscalable beam-type devices may have use in flow velocity and wall shear\nstress sensors.\n", "  We show that a 750 GeV di-photon excess as reported by the ATLAS and CMS\nexperiments can be reproduced by the Minimal Dirac Gaugino Supersymmetric\nStandard Model (MDGSSM) without the need of any ad-hoc addition of new states.\nThe scalar resonance is identified with the spin-0 partner of the Dirac bino.\nWe perform a thorough analysis of constraints coming from the mixing of the\nscalar with the Higgs boson, the stability of the vacuum and the requirement of\nperturbativity of the couplings up to very high energy scales. We exhibit\nexamples of regions of the parameter space that respect all the constraints\nwhile reproducing the excess. We point out how trilinear couplings that are\nexpected to arise in supersymmetry-breaking mediation scenarios, but were\nignored in the previous literature on the subject, play an important role.\n", "  Among the physics goals of LHC experiments, precision tests of the Standard\nModel in the Strong and Electroweak sectors play an important role. Because of\nnature of the proton-proton processes, observables based on the measurement of\nthe direction and energy of leptons provide the most precise signatures. In the\npresent paper, we concentrate on the angular distribution of Drell-Yan process\nleptons, in the lepton-pair rest-frame. The vector nature of the intermediate\nstate imposes that distributions are to a good precision described by spherical\npolynomials of at most second order.\n  We show that with the proper choice of the coordinate frames, only one\ncoefficient in this polynomial decomposition remains sizable, even in the\npresence of one or two high $p_T$ jets. The necessary stochastic choice of the\nframes relies on probabilities independent from any coupling constants.\n  This remains true when one or two partons accompany the lepton pairs. In this\nway electroweak effects can be better separated from strong interaction ones\nfor the benefit of the interpretation of the measurements.\n  Our study exploits properties of single gluon emission matrix elements which\nare clearly visible if a conveniently chosen form of their representation is\nused. We rely also on distributions obtained from matrix element based Monte\nCarlo generated samples of events with two leptons and up to two additional\npartons in test samples. Incoming colliding protons' partons are distributed\naccordingly to PDFs and are strictly collinear to the corresponding beams.\n", "  We review and investigate different aspects of scalar fields in supergravity\ntheories both when they parametrize symmetric spaces and when they parametrize\nspaces of special holonomy which are not necessarily symmetric (Kahler and\nQuaternionic-Kahler spaces): their role in the definition of derivatives of the\nfermions covariant under the R-symmetry group and (in gauged supergravities)\nunder some gauge group, their dualization into (d-2)-forms, their role in the\nsupersymmetry transformation rules (via fermion shifts, for instance) etc. We\nfind a general definition of momentum map that applies to any manifold\nadmitting a Killing vector and coincides with those of the holomorphic and\ntri-holomorphic momentum maps in Kahler and Quaternionic-Kahler spaces and with\nan independent definition that can be given in symmetric spaces. We show how\nthe momentum map occurs ubiquitously: in gauge-covariant derivatives of\nfermions, in fermion shifts, in the supersymmetry transformation rules of\n(d-2)-forms etc. We also give the general structure of the\nNoether-Gaillard-Zumino conserved currents in theories with fields of different\nranks in any dimension.\n", "  The muon capture on 3H leading to muonic neutrino and three neutrons in the\nfinal state is studied under full inclusion of final state interactions.\nPredictions for the three-body break-up of 3H are calculated with the AV18\npotential, augmented by the Urbana IX three-nucleon force. Our results are\nbased on the single nucleon weak current operator comprising the dominant\nrelativistic corrections. This work is a natural extension of our\ninvestigations of the muon capture on 3He leading to 3H or n+d or n+n+p and\nmuonic neutrino in the final state, presented in Phys. Rev. C90, 024001 (2014).\n", "  We show that the axial component of the magnetic permeability tensor is\nresonant for a wire medium consisting of high-index epsilon-positive nanowires,\nand its real part changes the sign at a certain frequency. At this frequency\nthe medium experiences the topological transition from the hyperbolic to the\nelliptic type of dispersion. We show that the transition regime is\ncharacterized by extremely strong dependence of the permeability on the wave\nvector. This implies very high density of electromagnetic states that results\nin the filamentary pattern and noticeable Purcell factor for a transversely\noriented magnetic dipole.\n", "  With each new version of the Kepler pipeline and resulting planet candidate\ncatalogue, an updated measurement of the underlying planet population can only\nbe recovered with an corresponding measurement of the Kepler pipeline detection\nefficiency. Here, we present measurements of the sensitivity of the pipeline\n(version 9.2) used to generate the Q1-Q17 DR24 planet candidate catalog\n(Coughlin et al. 2016). We measure this by injecting simulated transiting\nplanets into the pixel-level data of 159,013 targets across the entire Kepler\nfocal plane, and examining the recovery rate. Unlike previous versions of the\nKepler pipeline, we find a strong period dependence in the measured detection\nefficiency, with longer (>40 day) periods having a significantly lower\ndetectability than shorter periods, introduced in part by an incorrectly\nimplemented veto. Consequently, the sensitivity of the 9.2 pipeline cannot be\ncast as a simple one-dimensional function of the signal strength of the\ncandidate planet signal as was possible for previous versions of the pipeline.\nWe report on the implications for occurrence rate calculations based on the\nQ1-Q17 DR24 planet candidate catalog and offer important caveats and\nrecommendations for performing such calculations. As before, we make available\nthe entire table of injected planet parameters and whether they were recovered\nby the pipeline, enabling readers to derive the pipeline detection sensitivity\nin the planet and/or stellar parameter space of their choice.\n", "  Intensity mapping (IM) is sensitive to the cumulative line emission of\ngalaxies. As such it represents a promising technique for statistical studies\nof galaxies fainter than the limiting magnitude of traditional galaxy surveys.\nThe strong hydrogen Ly-alpha line is the primary target for such an experiment,\nas its intensity is linked to star formation activity and the physical state of\nthe interstellar (ISM) and intergalactic (IGM) medium. However, to extract the\nmeaningful information one has to solve the confusion problems caused by\ninterloping lines from foreground galaxies. We discuss here the challenges for\na Ly-alpha IM experiment targeting z > 4 sources. We find that the Ly-alpha\npower spectrum can be in principle easily (marginally) obtained with a 40 cm\nspace telescope in a few days of observing time up to z < 8 (z = 10) assuming\nthat the interloping lines (e.g. H-alpha, [O II], [O III] lines) can be\nefficiently removed. We show that interlopers can be removed by using an\nancillary photometric galaxy survey with limiting AB mag 26 in the NIR bands\n(Y, J, H, or K). This would enable detection of the Ly-alpha signal from 5 < z\n< 9 faint sources. However, if a [C II] IM experiment is feasible, by\ncross-correlating the Ly-alpha with the [C II] signal the required depth of the\ngalaxy survey can be decreased to AB mag 24. This would bring the detection at\nreach of future facilities working in close synergy.\n", "  We study linear nonradial perturbations and stability of a marginal stable\ncircular orbit (MSCO) such as the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of a\ntest particle in stationary axisymmetric spacetimes which possess a reflection\nsymmetry with respect to the equatorial plane. The proposed approach is applied\nto Kerr solution and Majumdar-Papapetrou solution to Einstein equation.\nFinally, we reexamine MSCOs for a modified metric of a rapidly spinning black\nhole that has been recently proposed by Johannsen and Psaltis [PRD, 83, 124015\n(2011)]. We show that, for the Johannsen and Psaltis's model, circular orbits\nthat are stable against radial perturbations for some parameter region become\nunstable against vertical perturbations. This suggests that the last circular\norbit for this model may be larger than the ISCO.\n", "  Debris discs are a consequence of the planet formation process and constitute\nthe fingerprints of planetesimal systems. Their solar system's counterparts are\nthe asteroid and Edgeworth-Kuiper belts. The aim of this paper is to provide\nrobust numbers for the incidence of debris discs around FGK stars in the solar\nneighbourhood. The full sample of 177 FGK stars with d<20 pc proposed for the\nDUNES survey is presented. Herschel/PACS observations at 100 and 160 micron\ncomplemented with data at 70 micron, and at 250, 350 and 500 micron SPIRE\nphotometry, were obtained. The 123 objects observed by the DUNES collaboration\nwere presented in a previous paper. The remaining 54 stars, shared with the\nDEBRIS consortium and observed by them, and the combined full sample are\nstudied in this paper. The incidence of debris discs per spectral type is\nanalysed and put into context together with other parameters of the sample,\nlike metallicity, rotation and activity, and age.\n  The subsample of 105 stars with d<15 pc containing 23 F, 33 G and 49 K stars,\nis complete for F stars, almost complete for G stars and contains a substantial\nnumber of K stars to draw solid conclusions on objects of this spectral type.\nThe incidence rates of debris discs per spectral type 0.26 (6 objects with\nexcesses out of 23 F stars), 0.21 (7 out of 33 G stars) and 0.20 (10 out of 49\nK stars), the fraction for all three spectral types together being 0.22 (23 out\nof 105 stars). Uncertainties corresponding to a 95% confidence level are given\nin the text for all these numbers. The medians of the upper limits of\nL_dust/L_* for each spectral type are 7.8E-7 (F), 1.4E-6 (G) and 2.2E-6 (K);\nthe lowest values being around 4.0E-7. The incidence of debris discs is similar\nfor active (young) and inactive (old) stars. The fractional luminosity tends to\ndrop with increasing age, as expected from collisional erosion of the debris\nbelts.\n", "  Cu-based chalcogenides are promising materials for thin-film solar cells with\nmore than 20% measured cell efficiency. Using first-principles calculations\nbased on density functional theory, the optoelectronic properties of a group of\nCu-based chalcogenides Cu$_2$-II-IV-VI$_4$ is studied. They are then screened\nwith the aim of identifying potential absorber materials for photovoltaic\napplications. The spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency (SLME) introduced by\nYu and Zunger is used as a metric for the screening. After constructing the\ncurrent-voltage curve, the maximum spectroscopy dependent power conversion\nefficiency is calculated from the maximum power output. The role of the nature\nof the band gap, direct or indirect, and also of the absorptivity of the\nstudied materials on the maximum theoretical power conversion efficiency is\nstudied. Our results show that Cu$_2$-II-GeSe$_4$ with II=Cd and Hg, and\nCu$_2$-II-SnS$_4$ with II=Cd and Zn have a higher theoretical efficiency\ncompared to the materials currently used as absorber layer.\n", "  We discuss the energy distribution of free-electron Fermi-gas, a problem with\na textbook solution of Gaussian energy fluctuations in the limit of a large\nsystem. We find that for a small system, characterized solely by its heat\ncapacity $C$, the distribution can be solved analytically, and it is both\nskewed and it vanishes at low energies, exhibiting a sharp drop to zero at the\nenergy corresponding to the filled Fermi sea. The results are relevant from the\nexperimental point of view, since the predicted non-Gaussian effects become\npronounced when $C/k_B \\lesssim 10^3$ ($k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant), a\nregime that can be easily achieved for instance in mesoscopic metallic\nconductors at sub-kelvin temperatures.\n", "  We study the time evolution of single interval Renyi and entanglement\nentropies following local quantum quenches in two dimensional conformal field\ntheories at finite temperature for which the locally excited states have a\nfinite temporal width, \\epsilon. We show that, for local quenches produced by\nthe action of a conformal primary field, the time dependence of Renyi and\nentanglement entropies at order \\epsilon^2 is universal. It is determined by\nthe expectation value of the stress tensor in the replica geometry and\nproportional to the conformal dimension of the primary field generating the\nlocal excitation. We also show that in CFTs with a gravity dual, the \\epsilon^2\ncorrection to the holographic entanglement entropy following a local quench\nprecisely agrees with the CFT prediction. We then consider CFTs admitting a\nhigher spin symmetry and turn on a higher spin chemical potential \\mu. We\ncalculate the time dependence of the order \\epsilon^2 correction to the\nentanglement entropy for small \\mu, and show that the contribution at order\n\\mu^2 is universal. We verify our arguments against exact results for minimal\nmodels and the free fermion theory.\n", "  Dynamic properties of NiFe thin films on PMN-PT piezoelectric substrate are\ninvestigated using the spin-diode method. Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectra\nof microstrips with varying width are measured as a function of magnetic field\nand frequency. The FMR frequency is shown to depend on the electric field\napplied across the substrate, which induces strain in the NiFe layer. Electric\nfield tunability of up to 100 MHz per 1 kV/cm is achieved. An analytical model\nbased on total energy minimization and the LLG equation, with magnetostriction\neffect taken into account, is developed to explain the measured dynamics. Based\non this model, conditions for strong electric-field tunable spin diode FMR in\npatterned NiFe/PMN-PT structures are derived.\n", "  An inclusive search for a new-physics signature of lepton-jet resonances has\nbeen performed by the ATLAS experiment. Scalar leptoquarks, pair-produced in\n$pp$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV at the Large Hadron Collider, have been\nconsidered. An integrated luminosity of 3.2 fb$^{-1}$, corresponding to the\nfull 2015 dataset was used. First (second) generation leptoquarks were sought\nin events with two electrons (muons) and two or more jets. The observed event\nyield in each channel is consistent with Standard Model background\nexpectations. The observed (expected) lower limits on the leptoquark mass at\n95% confidence level are 1100 GeV and 1050 GeV (1160 GeV and 1040 GeV) for\nfirst and second generation leptoquarks, respectively, assuming a branching\nratio into a charged lepton and a quark of 100%. Upper limits on the\naforementioned branching ratio are also given as a function of leptoquark mass.\nCompared with the results of earlier ATLAS searches, the sensitivity is\nincreased for leptoquark masses above 860 GeV, and the observed exclusion\nlimits confirm and extend the published results.\n", "  Line intensity mapping is a superb tool to study the collective radiation\nfrom early galaxies. However, the method is hampered by the presence of strong\nforegrounds, mostly produced by low-redshift interloping lines. We present here\na general method to overcome this problem which is robust against foreground\nresidual noise and based on the cross-correlation function $\\psi_{\\alpha L}(r)$\nbetween diffuse line emission and Ly$\\alpha$ emitters (LAE). We compute the\ndiffuse line (Ly$\\alpha$ is used as an example) emission from galaxies in a\n$(800{\\rm Mpc})^3$ box at $z = 5.7$ and $6.6$. We divide the box in slices and\npopulate them with $14000(5500)$ LAEs at $z = 5.7(6.6)$, considering duty\ncycles from $10^{-3}$ to $1$. Both the LAE number density and slice volume are\nconsistent with the expected outcome of the Subaru HSC survey. We add gaussian\nrandom noise with variance $\\sigma_{\\rm N}$ up to 100 times the variance of the\nLy$\\alpha$ emission, $\\sigma_\\alpha$, to simulate foregrounds and compute\n$\\psi_{\\alpha L}(r)$. We find that the signal-to-noise of the observed\n$\\psi_{\\alpha L}(r)$ does not change significantly if $\\sigma_{\\rm N} \\le 10\n\\sigma_\\alpha$ and show that in these conditions the mean line intensity,\n$I_{Ly\\alpha}$, can be precisely recovered independently of the LAE duty cycle.\nEven if $\\sigma_{\\rm N} = 100 \\sigma_\\alpha$, $I_\\alpha$ can be constrained\nwithin a factor $2$. The method works equally well for any other line (e.g. HI\n21 cm, [CII], HeII) used for the intensity mapping experiment.\n", "  Images of the linear polarization of synchrotron radiation around Active\nGalactic Nuclei (AGN) identify their projected magnetic field lines and provide\nkey data for understanding the physics of accretion and outflow from\nsupermassive black holes. The highest resolution polarimetric images of AGN are\nproduced with Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI). Because VLBI\nincompletely samples the Fourier transform of the source image, any image\nreconstruction that fills in unmeasured spatial frequencies will not be unique\nand reconstruction algorithms are required. In this paper, we explore\nextensions of the Maximum Entropy Method (MEM) to linear polarimetric VLBI\nimaging. In contrast to previous work, our polarimetric MEM algorithm combines\na Stokes I imager that uses only bispectrum measurements that are immune to\natmospheric phase corruption with a joint Stokes Q and U imager that operates\non robust polarimetric ratios. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our\ntechnique on 7- and 3-mm wavelength quasar observations from the VLBA and\nsimulated 1.3-mm Event Horizon Telescope observations of Sgr A* and M87.\nConsistent with past studies, we find that polarimetric MEM can produce\nsuperior resolution compared to the standard CLEAN algorithm when imaging\nsmooth and compact source distributions. As an imaging framework, MEM is highly\nadaptable, allowing a range of constraints on polarization structure.\nPolarimetric MEM is thus an attractive choice for image reconstruction with the\nEHT.\n", "  We investigated high-frequency behavior of FeN thin films prepared by\nreactive sputtering through ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) and its relationship\nwith the static magnetic properties. The FMR was observed in the frequency\nrange from 2 to 18 GHz in the FeN films fabricated at proper nitrogen flow rate\n(NFR). In those FeN thin films, a decrease of the saturation magnetization and\nthe corresponding decrease of the FMR frequency were observed as NFR was\nincreased during the deposition. The external field dependences of the FMR\nfrequencies were well fit to the Kittel formula and the Land\\'e g-factors\ndetermined from the fit were found to be very close to the free electron value.\nThe high-field damping parameters were almost insensitive to the growth\ncondition of NFR. However, the low-field damping parameters exhibited high\nsensitivity to NFR very similar to the dependence of the hard-axis coercivity\non NFR, suggesting that extrinsic material properties such as impurities and\ndefect structures could be important in deciding the low-field damping\nbehavior.\n", "  ZnS nanorods and Cr2O3 nanoparticle decorated ZnS nanorods were synthesized\nusing facile hydrothermal techniques and their ethanol sensing properties were\nexamined. X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy revealed the good\ncrystallinity and size uniformity of the ZnS nanorods. The Cr2O3 nanoparticle\ndecorated ZnS nanorod sensor showed stronger response to ethanol than the\npristine ZnS nanorod sensor. The responses of the pristine and decorated\nnanorod sensors to 200 ppm of ethanol at 300oC were 2.9 and 13.8, respectively.\nFurthermore, under these conditions, the decorated nanorod sensor showed longer\nresponse time (23 s) and shorter recovery time (20 s) than those of the\npristine one (19 and 35 s, respectively). Consequently, the total sensing time\nof the decorated nanorod sensor (42 s) was shorter than that of the pristine\none (55 s). The decorated nanorod sensor showed excellent selectivity to\nethanol over other volatile organic compound gases including acetone, methanol,\nbenzene, toluene, whereas the pristine one failed to show selectivity to\nethanol over acetone. The improved sensing performance of the decorated nanorod\nsensor is attributed to the modulation of the conduction channel width and the\npotential barrier height at the ZnS Cr2O3 interface accompanying the adsorption\nand desorption of ethanol gas as well as the greater surface to volume ratio of\nthe decorated nanorods than the pristine one due to the existence of the ZnS\nCr2O3 interface.\n", "  A scheme is proposed for the fast generation of three-dimensional\nentanglement between two atoms trapped in two cavities connected by a fiber via\ninvariant-based shortcut to adiabatic passage. With the help of quantum Zeno\ndynamics, the technique of invariant-based shortcut to adiabatic passage is\napplied for the generation of two-atom three-dimensional entanglement. The\nnumerical simulation results show that, within a short time, the scheme has a\nhigh fidelity and is robust against the decoherence caused by the atomic\nspontaneous emission, photon leakage, and the variations in the parameters\nselected. Moreover, the scheme may be possible to be implemented with the\ncurrent experimental technology.\n", "  We investigate compactifications of type II and M-theory down to $AdS_5$ with\ngeneric fluxes that preserve eight supercharges, in the framework of\nExceptional Generalized Geometry. The geometric data and gauge fields on the\ninternal manifold are encoded in a pair of generalized structures corresponding\nto the vector and hyper-multiplets of the reduced five-dimensional\nsupergravity. Supersymmetry translates into integrability conditions for these\nstructures, generalizing, in the case of type IIB, the Sasaki-Einstein\nconditions. We show that the ten and eleven-dimensional type IIB and M-theory\nKilling-spinor equations specialized to a warped $AdS_5$ background imply the\ngeneralized integrability conditions.\n", "  Novel thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) material with diphenyl\nsulfone (DPS) as an electron acceptor and 3,6-dimethoxycarbazole (DMOC) and\n1,3,6,8-Tetramethyl-9H-carbazole (TMC) as electron donors were investigated\ntheoretically for a blue organic light emitting diode (OLED) emitter. We\ncalculate the energies of the first singlet (S1) and first triplet (T1)-excited\nstates of TADF materials by performing density functional theory (DFT) and\ntime-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations on the ground state using a dependence\non charge transfer amounts for the optimal Hartree-Fock percentage in the\nexchange-correlation of TD-DFT. The calculated {\\Delta}EST values of TMC-DPS\n(0.094 eV) was smaller than DMOC-DPS (0.386 eV) because of the large dihedral\nangles between the donor and accepter moieties. We show that TMC-DPS would have\na suitable blue OLED emitter, because it has a large dihedral angle that\ncreates a small spatial overlap between the HOMO and the LUMO and,\nconsequently, the small {\\Delta}EST and the emission wavelength of 2.82 eV\n(439.9 nm).\n", "  An asymmetric A-{\\pi}-D-{\\pi}-D-{\\pi}-A' tribranched organic dye (dye1) with\na cyanoacrylic acid and an indolinum carboxyl acid as electron acceptors and a\ntriphenylamine as an electron donor was designed and theoretically investigated\nfor dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Dye1 was compared to reference\nwell-known dyes with single electron acceptors (D5 and JYL-SQ6). Density\nfunctional theory and time-dependent density functional theory calculations\nwere used to estimate the photovoltaic properties of the dyes. Due to the\ndifferent lowest unoccupied molecular orbital levels of each acceptor and the\nenergy antenna of the dual electron donor (D-{\\pi}-D), the absorption spectrum\nof each branch displayed different shapes. Considering the overall properties,\nthe asymmetric A-{\\pi}-D-{\\pi}-D-{\\pi}-A' tribranched organic dye exhibited\nhigh conversion efficiency performance for DSSCs. The findings of this work\nsuggest that optimizing the branch of electron donors and acceptors in dye\nsensitizers based on asymmetric A-{\\pi}-D-{\\pi}-D-{\\pi}-A' tribranched organic\ndye produces good photovoltaic properties for DSSCs.\n", "  We present an argument that radio galaxies (active galaxies with mis-aligned\njets) are likely to be the primary sources of the high-energy astrophysical\nneutrinos observed by IceCube. In particular, if the gamma-ray emission\nobserved from radio galaxies is generated through the interactions of\ncosmic-ray protons with gas, these interactions can also produce a population\nof neutrinos with a flux and spectral shape similar to that measured by\nIceCube. We present a simple physical model in which high-energy cosmic rays\nare confined within the volumes of radio galaxies, where they interact with gas\nto generate the observed diffuse fluxes of neutrinos and gamma rays. In\naddition to simultaneously accounting for the observations of Fermi and\nIceCube, radio galaxies in this model also represent an attractive class of\nsources for the highest energy cosmic rays.\n", "  A mixture of solvent particles with short-range, directional interactions and\nsolute particles with short-range, isotropic interactions that can bond\nmultiple times is of fundamental interest in understanding liquids and\ncolloidal mixtures. Because of multi-body correlations predicting the structure\nand thermodynamics of such systems remains a challenge. Earlier Marshall and\nChapman developed a theory wherein association effects due to interactions\nmultiply the partition function for clustering of particles in a reference\nhard-sphere system. The multi-body effects are incorporated in the clustering\nprocess, which in their work was obtained in the absence of the bulk medium.\nThe bulk solvent effects were then modeled approximately within a second order\nperturbation approach. However, their approach is inadequate at high densities\nand for large association strengths. Based on the idea that the clustering of\nsolvent in a defined coordination volume around the solute is related to\noccupancy statistics in that defined coordination volume, we develop an\napproach to incorporate the complete information about hard-sphere clustering\nin a bulk solvent at the density of interest. The occupancy probabilities are\nobtained from enhanced sampling simulations but we also develop a concise\nparametric form to model these probabilities using the quasichemical theory of\nsolutions. We show that incorporating the complete reference information\nresults in an approach that can predict the bonding state and thermodynamics of\nthe colloidal solute for a wide range of system conditions.\n", "  We study three-dimensional ${\\mathcal N}=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories on\n${\\Sigma_g \\times S^1}$ with a topological twist along $\\Sigma_g$, a genus-$g$\nRiemann surface. The twisted supersymmetric index at genus $g$ and the\ncorrelation functions of half-BPS loop operators on $S^1$ can be computed\nexactly by supersymmetric localization. For $g=1$, this gives a simple UV\ncomputation of the 3d Witten index. Twisted indices provide us with a clean\nderivation of the quantum algebra of supersymmetric Wilson loops, for any\nYang-Mills-Chern-Simons-matter theory, in terms of the associated Bethe\nequations for the theory on ${\\mathbb R}^2 \\times S^1$. This also provides a\npowerful and simple tool to study 3d ${\\mathcal N}=2$ Seiberg dualities.\nFinally, we study A- and B-twisted indices for ${\\mathcal N}=4$ supersymmetric\ngauge theories, which turns out to be very useful for quantitative studies of\nthree-dimensional mirror symmetry. We also briefly comment on a relation\nbetween the $S^2 \\times S^1$ twisted indices and the Hilbert series of\n${\\mathcal N}=4$ moduli spaces.\n", "  An x-ray scattering approach to determine the two-dimensional (2D) pair\ndistribution function (PDF) in partially ordered 2D systems is proposed. We\nderive relations between the structure factor and PDF that enable quantitative\nstudies of positional and bond-orientational (BO) order in real space. We apply\nthis approach in the x-ray study of a liquid crystal (LC) film undergoing the\nsmectic-hexatic phase transition, to analyze the interplay between the\npositional and BO order during the temperature evolution of the LC film. We\nanalyze the positional correlation length in different directions in real\nspace.\n", "  WISE J085510.83-071442.5 (hereafter WISE 0855-0714) is the coldest known\nbrown dwarf (~250 K) and the fourth closest known system to the Sun (2.2 pc).\nIt has been previously detected only in the J band and two mid-IR bands. To\nbetter measure its spectral energy distribution (SED), we have performed deep\nimaging of WISE 0855-0714 in six optical and near-IR bands with Gemini\nObservatory, the Very Large Telescope, and the Hubble Space Telescope. Five of\nthe bands show detections, although one detection is marginal (S/N~3). We also\nhave obtained two epochs of images with the Spitzer Space Telescope for use in\nrefining the parallax of the brown dwarf. By combining astrometry from this\nwork and previous studies, we have derived a parallax of 0.449+/-0.008\"\n(2.23+/-0.04 pc). We have compared our photometry for WISE 0855-0714 to data\nfor known Y dwarfs and to the predictions of three suites of models by Saumon\net al. (2012) and Morley et al. (2012, 2014) that are defined by the presence\nor absence of clouds and non-equilibrium chemistry. Our estimates of Y-J and\nJ-H for WISE 0855-0714 are redder than colors of other Y dwarfs, confirming a\npredicted reversal of near-IR colors to redder values at temperatures below\n300-400 K. In color-magnitude diagrams, no single suite of models provides a\nclearly superior match to the sequence formed by WISE 0855-0714 and other Y\ndwarfs. Instead, the best fitting model changes from one diagram to the next.\nSimilarly, all of the models have substantial differences from the SED of WISE\n0855-0714. As a result, we are currently unable to constrain the presence of\nclouds or non-equilibrium chemistry in its atmosphere.\n", "  In this paper, we study the entanglement entropy in a large class of states\nof two-dimensional conformal field theory in the the large central charge\nlimit. This class of states includes the states created by the insertion of a\nfinite number of local heavy operators. By using the monodromy analysis, we\nobtain the leading order entanglement entropy for the general state. We show\nthat it is exactly captured by the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, by using the\nWilsonian line prescription in the Chern-Simons formulation of the AdS$_3$\ngravity.\n", "  Thin highly textured Fe$_{\\mathrm{1+x}}$Co$_{\\mathrm{2-x}}$Si ($0 \\leq$ x\n$\\leq 1$) films were prepared on MgO (001) substrates by magnetron\nco-sputtering. The magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE) and ferromagnetic resonance\n(FMR) measurements were used to investigate the composition dependence of the\nmagnetization, the magnetic anisotropy, the gyromagnetic ratio and the\nrelaxation of the films. The effective magnetization for the thin\nFe$_{\\mathrm{1+x}}$Co$_{\\mathrm{2-x}}$Si films, determined by FMR measurements,\nare consistent with the Slater Pauling prediction. Both MOKE and FMR\nmeasurements reveal a pronounced fourfold anisotropy distribution for all\nfilms. In addition we found a strong influence of the stoichiometry on the\nanisotropy as the cubic anisotropy strongly increases with increasing Fe\nconcentration. The gyromagnetic ratio is only weakly dependent on the\ncomposition. We find low Gilbert damping parameters for all films with values\ndown to $0.0012\\pm0.00012$ for Fe$_{1.75}$Co$_{1.25}$Si. The effective damping\nparameter for Co$_2$FeSi is found to be $0.0018\\pm 0.0004$. We also find a\npronounced anisotropic relaxation, which indicates significant contributions of\ntwo-magnon scattering processes that is strongest along the easy axes of the\nfilms. This makes thin Fe$_{\\mathrm{1+x}}$Co$_{\\mathrm{2-x}}$Si films ideal\nmaterials for the application in STT-MRAM devices.\n", "  Quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect in the films with nontrivial band\nstructure accompanies the ferromagnetic transition in the system of magnetic\ndopants. Experimentally, the QAH transition manifests itself as a jump in the\ndependence of longitudinal resistivity on a weak external magnetic field.\nMicroscopically, this jump originates from the emergence of a chiral edge mode\non one side of the ferromagnetic transition. We study analytically the effect\nof an extended confinement on the structure of the edge modes. We employ the\nsimplest model of the extended confinement in the form of potential step next\nto the hard wall. It is shown that, unlike the conventional quantum Hall\neffect, where all edge channels are chiral, in QAH effect, a complex structure\nof the boundary leads to nonchiral edge modes which are present on both sides\nof the ferromagnetic transition. Wave functions of nonchiral modes are\ndifferent above and below the transition: on the \"topological\" side, where the\nchiral edge mode is supported, nonchiral modes are \"repelled\" from the\nboundary, i.e. they are much less localized than on the \"trivial\" side. Thus,\nthe disorder-induced scattering into these modes will boost the extension of\nthe chiral edge mode. The prime experimental manifestation of nonchiral modes\nis that, by contributing to longitudinal resistance, they smear the QAH\ntransition.\n", "  The electronic structures of multiferroic oxides of\nBa(1-x)Bi(x)Ti(0.9)Fe(0.1)O(3) (0 < x < 0.12) have been investigated by\nemploying photoemission spectroscopy and soft x-ray absorption spectroscopy\n(XAS). The measured Fe and Ti 2p XAS spectra show that Ti ions are in the Ti4+\nstates for all x and that Fe ions are Fe2+-Fe3+ mixed-valent for x > 0. The\nvalence states of Fe ions are found to be nearly trivalent for x=0, and\ndecreases with increasing x from being nearly trivalent (v(Fe)~ 3) for x=0 to\nv(Fe)~ 2.6 for x=0.12. The valence states of both Ti and Ba ions do not change\nfor all x < 0.12. Based on the obtained valence states of Fe ions, the\nelectronic and magnetic properties of Ba(1-x)Bi(x)Ti(0.9)Fe(0.1)O(3) are\nexplored.\n", "  We have investigated the H2 pressure-dependent (from vacuum to 20 bar)\ncurrent-voltage characteristics of ZnO thin films prepared by spin coating\nmethod. The gas pressure effect on conductance (G) was subtracted using He gas.\nThe G increased as applying 2 bar of H2 pressure, and then it monotonously\ndecreased with the further increment of H2 pressure. Using X-ray diffraction\npatterns and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy before and after H2 exposure, we\nfound that the H2 spillover effect plays an important role in the variation of\nG of ZnO film.\n", "  In this study, we fabricated hybrid white organic light-emitting diodes\n(WOLEDs) based on triplet harvesting with simple structure. All the hole\ntransporting material and host in emitting layer (EML) of devices were utilized\nwith same material by using\nN,N'-di-1-naphthalenyl-N,N'-diphenyl-[1,1':4',1\":4\",1\"'-quaterphenyl]-4,4\"'-diamine\n(4P-NPD) which were known to be blue fluorescent material. Simple hybrid WOLEDs\nwere fabricated three color with blue fluorescent and green, red phosphorescent\nmaterials. We was investigated the effect of triplet harvesting (TH) by exciton\ngeneration zone on simple hybrid WOLEDs. Characteristic of simple hybrid WOLEDs\nwere dominant hole mobility, therefore exciton generation zone was expected in\nEML. Additionally, we was optimization thickness of hole transporting layer and\nelectron transporting layer was fabricated a simple hybrid WOLEDs. Simple\nhybrid WOLED exhibits maximum luminous efficiency of 29.3 cd/A and maximum\nexternal quantum efficiency of 11.2%. Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage\n(International Commission on Illumination) coordinates of (0.45, 0.43) at about\n10,000 cd/m^2.\n", "  Recent studies reports that an epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) thin slab between a\nspecimen and a substrate contributes in enhancing the spatial resolution of the\noptical system. Here, we investigate the ENZ thickness dependence of the\nresolution enhancement. By employing the edge response function, the resolution\nof the optical system is directly measured when imaging a sharp edge of a metal\nfilm. We found that the optimum ENZ slab thickness was 700 nm and the achieved\nresolution was 11 {\\mu}m at the wavelength of 8 {\\mu}m. Owing to the enhanced\nresolution by ENZ slab, we successfully imaged the subwavelength slit arrays.\n", "  The potential utilization of two-stage sintering for the production of highly\ndense and pure nickel diniobate (Ni4Nb2O9) ceramics with low firing temperature\nwas demonstrated. Effects of designed sintering conditions on phase formation,\ndensification and microstructure of the ceramics were characterized by X-ray\ndiffraction (XRD), Archimedes method and scanning electron microscopy (SEM),\nrespectively. It has been found that minor phase of columbite NiNb2O6 tended to\nform together with the desired Ni4Nb2O9 phase, depending on sintering\nconditions. The optimization of sintering conditions could lead to a\nsingle-phase Ni4Nb2O9 ceramics with orthorhombic structure. The ceramics doubly\nsintered at 950/1250 {\\deg}C for 4 h exhibited maximum density value of 92%.\nMicrostructures with denser angular grain-packing were generally found in both\nsets of the sintered Ni4Nb2O9 ceramics. However, the grains were irregular in\nshape when the samples are sintered at 1050/1250 {\\deg}C. Two-stage sintering\nwas also found to enhance ferroelectric behavior of Ni4Nb2O9 ceramic.\n", "  One of the greatest questions for modern physics to address is how elements\nheavier than iron are created in extreme, astrophysical environments. A\nparticularly challenging part of that question is the creation of the so-called\np-nuclei, which are believed to be mainly produced in some types of supernovae.\nThe lack of needed nuclear data presents an obstacle in nailing down the\nprecise site and astrophysical conditions. In this work, we present for the\nfirst time measurements on the nuclear level density and average strength\nfunction of $^{92}$Mo. State-of-the-art p-process calculations systematically\nunderestimate the observed solar abundance of this isotope. Our data provide\nstringent constraints on the $^{91}$Nb$(p,{\\gamma})^{92}$Mo reaction rate,\nwhich is the last unmeasured reaction in the nucleosynthesis puzzle of\n$^{92}$Mo. Based on our results, we conclude that the $^{92}$Mo abundance\nanomaly is not due to the nuclear physics input to astrophysical model\ncalculations.\n", "  The lattice thermal expansion and conductivity in bulk Mo and W-based\ntransition metal dichalcogenides are investigated by means of density\nfunctional and Boltzmann transport theory calculations. To this end, a recent\nvan der Waals density functional (vdW-DF-CX) is employed, which is shown to\nyield excellent agreement with reference data for the structural parameters.\nThe calculated in-plane thermal conductivity compares well with experimental\nroom temperature values, when phonon-phonon and isotopic scattering are\nincluded. To explain the behavior over the entire available temperature range\none must, however, include additional (temperature independent) scattering\nmechanisms that limit the mean free path. Generally, the primary heat carrying\nmodes have mean free paths of $1\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ or more, which makes these\nmaterials very susceptible to structural defects. The conductivity of Mo and\nW-based TMDs is primarily determined by the chalcogenide species and increases\nin the order Te-Se-S. While for the tellurides and selenides the transition\nmetal element has a negligible effect, the conductivity of WS$_2$ is notably\nhigher than for MoS$_2$, which can be traced to the much larger phonon band gap\nof the former. Overall the present study provides a consistent set of thermal\nconductivities that reveal chemical trends and constitute the basis for future\ninvestigations of van der Waals solids.\n", "  We have studied performance of ZnTe-based heterojunction diodes grown on\np-GaAs substrates by pulsed laser deposition (PLD).\n", "  In this study Fe2O3/Co3O4 nanocomposites were synthesized by using a simple\nhydrothermal route. The X-ray diffraction analysis results showed that\nsynthesized powders were pure, and nanocrystalline in nature. Moreover,\nScanning electron microscopy revealed that Fe2O3 nanoparticles had spherical\nshapes while Co3O4 particles had a rod-like morphology. Ethanol sensing\nproperties of Fe2O3/Co3O4 nanocomposites were examined and compared with those\nof pristine Fe2O3 nanoparticles. It was shown that the gas sensing properties\nof Fe2O3/Co3O4 nanocomposites were superior to those of pristine Fe2O3\nnanoparticles and for all concentrations of ethanol, the response of the\nnanocomposite sensor was higher than the pristine Fe2O3 nanoparticle sensor. In\ndetail, the response of Fe2O3/Co3O4 nanocomposite sensor to 200 ppm of ethanol\nat 300{\\deg}C was about 3 times higher than pristine one. Also in general, the\nresponse and recovery times of Fe2O3/Co3O4 nanocomposite sensor were shorter\nthan those of the pristine one. The improved sensing characteristics of the\nFe2O3/Co3O4 sensor were attributed to a combination of several effects: the\nformation of a potential barrier at the Fe2O3-Co3O4 interface, the enhanced\nmodulation of the conduction channel width accompanying the adsorption and\ndesorption of ethanol gas, the catalytic activity of Co3O4 for the oxidation of\nethanol, the stronger oxygen adsorption of p-type Co3O4, and the formation of\npreferential adsorption sites.\n", "  We consider scenarios where Dark Matter (DM) particles carry baryon and/or\nlepton numbers, which can be defined if there exist operators connecting the\ndark to the visible sector. As a result, the DM fields become intimately linked\nto the Standard Model (SM) ones and can be maximally asymmetric just like the\nordinary matter. In particular, we discuss minimal scenarios where the DM is a\ncomplex scalar or a Dirac fermion coupled to operators with nonzero baryon\nand/or lepton numbers, and that consist of only SM fields. We consider an\ninitial asymmetry stored in either the SM or the DM sector; the main role of\nthese operators is to properly $share$ the asymmetry between the two sectors,\nin accordance with observations. After the chemical decoupling, the DM and SM\nsectors do $not$ $care$ about each other as there is only an ineffective\ncommunication between them. Once the DM mass is specified, the Wilson\ncoefficients of these operators are fixed by the requirement of the correct\ntransfer of the asymmetry. We study the phenomenology of this framework at\ncolliders, direct detection and indirect detection experiments. In particular,\nthe LHC phenomenology is very rich and can be tested in different channels such\nas the two same-sign leptons with two jets, monojet and monojet with a\nmonolepton.\n", "  Recent developments in the three-dimensional (3D) spectral synthesis code\nLinfor3D have meant that, for the first time, large spectral wavelength\nregions, such as molecular bands, can be synthesised with it in a short amount\nof time. A detailed spectral analysis of the synthetic G-band for several dwarf\nturn-off-type 3D atmospheres (5850 <= T_eff [K] <= 6550, 4.0 <= log g <= 4.5,\n-3.0 <= [Fe/H] <= -1.0) was conducted, under the assumption of local\nthermodynamic equilibrium. We also examine carbon and oxygen molecule formation\nat various metallicity regimes and discuss the impact it has on the G-band.\nUsing a qualitative approach, we describe the different behaviours between the\n3D atmospheres and the traditional one-dimensional (1D) atmospheres and how the\ndifferent physics involved inevitably leads to abundance corrections, which\ndiffer over varying metallicities. Spectra computed in 1D were fit to every 3D\nspectrum to determine the 3D abundance correction. Early analysis revealed that\nthe CH molecules that make up the G-band exhibited an oxygen abundance\ndependency; a higher oxygen abundance leads to weaker CH features. Nitrogen\nabundances showed zero impact to CH formation. The 3D corrections are also\nstronger at lower metallicity. Analysis of the 3D corrections to the G-band\nallows us to assign estimations of the 3D abundance correction to most dwarf\nstars presented in the literature. The 3D corrections suggest that A(C) in CEMP\nstars with high A(C) would remain unchanged, but would decrease in CEMP stars\nwith lower A(C). It was found that the C/O ratio is an important parameter to\nthe G-band in 3D. Additional testing confirmed that the C/O ratio is an equally\nimportant parameter for OH transitions under 3D. This presents a clear\ninterrelation between the carbon and oxygen abundances in 3D atmospheres\nthrough their molecular species, which is not seen in 1D.\n", "  Extremely metal poor stars have been the focus of much recent attention owing\nto the expectation that their chemical abundances can shed light on the metal\nand dust yields of the earliest supernovae. We present our most realistic\nsimulation to date of the astrophysical pathway to the first metal enriched\nstars. We simulate the radiative and supernova hydrodynamic feedback of a\n$60\\,M_\\odot$ Population III star starting from cosmological initial conditions\nrealizing Gaussian density fluctuations. We follow the gravitational\nhydrodynamics of the supernova remnant at high spatial resolution through its\nfreely-expanding, adiabatic, and radiative phases, until gas, now\nmetal-enriched, has resumed runaway gravitational collapse. Our findings are\nsurprising: while the Population III progenitor exploded with a low energy of\n$10^{51}\\,\\text{erg}$ and injected an ample metal mass of $6\\,M_\\odot$, the\nfirst cloud to collapse after the supernova explosion is a dense surviving\nprimordial cloud on which the supernova blastwave deposited metals only\nsuperficially, in a thin, unresolved layer. The first metal-enriched stars can\nform at a very low metallicity, of only $2-5\\times10^{-4}\\,Z_\\odot$, and can\ninherit the parent cloud's highly elliptical, radially extended orbit in the\ndark matter gravitational potential.\n", "  Recent measurements have revealed a significant suppression of multipion\nBose-Einstein correlations in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC. The suppression\nmay be explained by postulating coherent pion emission. Typically, the\nsuppression of Bose-Einstein correlations due to coherence is taken into\naccount with the coherent state formalism in quantum optics. However, since\ncharged pion correlations are most often measured, the additional constraint of\nisospin conservation, which is absent in quantum optics, needs to be taken into\naccount. As a consequence, correlations emerge between pions of opposite\ncharge. A calculation of the correlations induced by isospin conservation of\ncoherent emission is made for two, three- and four-pion correlation functions\nand compared to the data from the LHC.\n", "  Context. Observations of flux emergence indicate that rotational velocities\nmay develop within sunspots. However, the dependence of this rotation on\nsub-photospheric field strength and twist remains largely unknown.\n  Aims. We investigate the effects of varying the initial field strength and\ntwist of an emerging sub-photospheric magnetic flux tube on the rotation of the\nsunspots at the photosphere.\n  Methods. We consider a simple model of a stratified domain with a\nsub-photospheric interior layer and three overlying atmospheric layers. A\ntwisted arched flux tube is inserted in the interior and is allowed to rise\ninto the atmosphere. To achieve this, the MHD equations are solved using the\nLagrangian-remap code, Lare3d. We perform a parameter study by independently\nvarying the sub-photospheric magnetic field strength and twist.\n  Results. Altering the initial field strength and twist significantly affects\nthe tube's evolution and the rotational motions that develop at the\nphotosphere. The rotation angle, vorticity, and current show a direct\ndependence on the initial field strength. We find that an increase in field\nstrength increases the angle through which the fieldlines rotate, the length of\nfieldlines extending into the atmosphere, and the magnetic energy transported\nto the atmosphere. This also affects the amount of residual twist in the\ninterior. The length of the fieldlines is crucial as we predict the twist per\nunit length equilibrates to a lower value on longer fieldlines. No such direct\ndependence is found when we modify the twist owing to the complex effect this\nhas on the tension force acting on the tube. However, there is still a clear\nordering in quantities such as the rotation angle, helicity, and free energy\nwith higher initial twist cases being related to sunspots that rotate more\nrapidly, transporting more helicity and magnetic energy to the atmosphere.\n", "  Multiferroic materials attract considerable interest because of the wide\nrange of potential applications such as spintronic devices, data storage and\nsensors. As a strong candidate for the applications among the limited list of\nsingle-phase multiferroic materials, BiFeO3 (BFO) is a quite attractive\nmaterial due to its multiferroic properties at room temperature (RT). However,\nBFO is widely known to have large leakage current and small spontaneous\npolarization due to the existence of crystalline defects such as oxygen\nvacancies. Furthermore, the magnetic moment of pure BFO is very weak owing to\nits antiferromagnetic nature. In this paper, the effects of Ni2+ substitution\non the magnetic properties of bulk BFO have been investigated. BFO, and\nBiFe0.99Ni0.01O3, BiFe0.98Ni0.02O3 and BiFe0.97Ni0.03O3 (BFNO: Ni-doped BFO)\nceramics were prepared by solid-state reaction and rapid sintering, and\nanalyzed by structural and magnetic-property measurements. The leakage current\ndensity was measured at RT by using a standard ferroelectric tester. All the\nNi-doped BFO exhibit the similar rhombohedral perovskite structure (R3c) to\nthat of BFO. The magnetic properties of Ni-doped BFO are much enhanced with\nrespect to BFO prepared at the same conditions, since the enhanced\nferromagnetic interaction is caused by the Fe/Ni coupling.\n", "  We fabricated compact low-pass stainless-steel powder filters for use in\nlow-noise measurements at cryogenic temperatures and investigated their\nattenuation characteristics for different wire lengths, shapes, and preparation\nmethods up to 20 GHz. We used nominally 30-micrometer-sized SUS 304L powder and\nmixed with Stycast 2850FT by Emerson and Cumming with catalyst 23LV. A 0.1 mm\ninsulated copper wire was wound on preformed powder-mixture spools in the shape\nof a right-circular cylinder, a flattened elliptic cylinder and a toroid, and\nthe coils were encapsulated in metal tubes or boxes filled with the powder\nmixture. All the fabricated powder filters showed a large attenuation at high\nfrequencies with a cut-off frequency near 1 GHz. However, the toroidal filter\nshowed prominent ripples corresponding to resonance modes in the 0.5-m-long\ncoil wire. A filter with a 2:1 powder/epoxy mixture mass rate and a wire length\nof 1.53 m showed an attenuation of -93 dB at 4 GHz and the attenuation was\nlinearly proportional to the wire length. As the powder-to-epoxy ratio\nincreased, the high-frequency attenuation increased. An equally-spaced\nsingle-layer coil structure was found to be more efficient in attenuation than\na double-layer coil. Geometry of the metal filter-case affected noise ripples\nwith the least noise in a circular-tube case.\n", "  The redshifted 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen is a promising probe of the\nEpoch of Reionization (EoR). However, its detection requires a thorough\nunderstanding and control of the systematic errors. We study two systematic\nbiases observed in the LOFAR EoR residual data after calibration and\nsubtraction of bright discrete foreground sources. The first effect is a\nsuppression in the diffuse foregrounds, which could potentially mean a\nsuppression of the 21 cm signal. The second effect is an excess of noise beyond\nthe thermal noise. The excess noise shows fluctuations on small frequency\nscales, and hence it can not be easily removed by foreground removal or\navoidance methods. Our analysis suggests that sidelobes of residual sources due\nto the chromatic point spread function and ionospheric scintillation can not be\nthe dominant causes of the excess noise. Rather, both the suppression of\ndiffuse foregrounds and the excess noise can occur due to calibration with an\nincomplete sky model containing predominantly bright discrete sources. We show\nthat calibrating only on bright sources can cause suppression of other signals\nand introduce an excess noise in the data. The levels of the suppression and\nexcess noise depend on the relative flux of sources which are not included in\nthe model with respect to the flux of modeled sources. We discuss possible\nsolutions such as using only long baselines to calibrate the interferometric\ngain solutions as well as simultaneous multi-frequency calibration along with\ntheir benefits and shortcomings.\n", "  An improved phase retrieval method based Hilbert transform is introduced to\nquantitatively calculate the phase distribution from distorted fringe pattern.\nAlso phase measurement deflectomety are widely used in specular type samples.\nThe background noise or bias should be suppressed prior to apply Hilbert\ntransform. A method for suppression background noise double Hilbert transform\nis presented, which requires only one image. The method is easy to implement,\nand it is able to conducting automated fast measurements. We have demonstrated\nthe double Hilbert transform method to retrieve the phase and background\nsuppression by computer simulation and experiment in phase measuring\ndeflectometry method.\n", "  The Microscopic Otical Model Potential is evaluated within a relativistic\nscheme which provides a natural and consistent relation between the spin-orbit\npart and the central part of the potential. The Dirac-Brueckner-Hartree-Fock\n(DBHF) approach provides such a microscopic relativistic scheme, which is based\non a realistic nucleon-nucleon interaction and reproduce the saturation\nproperties of symmetric nuclear matter without any adjustable parameter. Its\nsolution using the projection technique within the subtracted T-matrix (STM)\nrepresentation provides a reliable extension to asymmetric nuclear matter,\nwhich is important to describe the features of the isospin asymmetric nuclei.\nTherefore, the present work aims to perform a global analysis of the\nisospin-dependent nucleon-nucleus MOP based on the DBHF calculation in\nsymmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter. The DBHF is used to evaluate the\nrelativistic structure of the nucleon self-energies in nuclear matter at\nvarious densities and asymmetries. The Schr\\\"odinger equivalent potentials of\nfinite nuclei are derived from these Dirac components by a local density\napproximation (LDA). The nucleon-nucleus scattering calculations are carried\nout for a broad spectrum $n$ and $p$ scattering experiments below 200 MeV with\ntargets ranging from $^{12}$C to $^{208}$Pb.\n", "  The phase structure and the infrared behaviour of the Euclidean 3-dimensional\n$O(2)$ symmetric ghost scalar field model with higher-order derivative term has\nbeen investigated in Wegner and Houghton's renormalization group framework. The\nsymmetric phase in which no ghost condensation occurs and the phase with\nrestored symmetry but with a transient presence of a ghost condensate have been\nidentified. Finiteness of the correlation length at the phase boundary hints to\na phase transition of first order. The results are compared with those for the\nordinary $O(2)$ symmetric scalar field model.\n", "  We discuss 76 large amplitude transients (Delta-m>1.5) occurring in the\nnuclei of galaxies, nearly all with no previously known Active Galactic Nucleus\n(AGN). They have been discovered as part of the Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) 3pi survey,\nby comparison with SDSS photometry a decade earlier, and then monitored with\nthe Liverpool Telescope, and studied spectroscopically with the William\nHerschel Telescope (WHT). Based on colours, light curve shape, and spectra,\nthese transients fall into four groups. A few are misclassified stars or\nobjects of unknown type. Some are red/fast transients and are known or likely\nnuclear supernovae. A few are either radio sources or erratic variables and so\nlikely blazars. However the majority (~66%) are blue and evolve slowly, on a\ntimescale of years. Spectroscopy shows them to be AGN at z~ 0.3 - 1.4, which\nmust have brightened since the SDSS photometry by around an order of magnitude.\nIt is likely that these objects were in fact AGN a decade ago, but too weak to\nbe recognised by SDSS; they could then be classed as \"hypervariable\" AGN. By\nsearching the SDSS Stripe 82 quasar database, we find 15 similar objects. We\ndiscuss several possible explanations for these slow blue hypervariables - (i)\nunusually luminous tidal disruption events; (ii) extinction events; (iii)\nchanges in accretion state; and (iv) large amplitude microlensing by stars in\nforeground galaxies. A mixture of explanations (iii) and (iv) seems most\nlikely. Both hold promise of considerable new insight into the AGN phenomenon.\n", "  In this research, we report the experimental evidence of the directional Fano\nresonances at the scattering of a plane, linearly polarized electromagnetic\nwave by a homogeneous dielectric sphere with high refractive index and low\nlosses. We observe a typical asymmetric Fano profile for the intensity\nscattered in, practically, any given direction, while the overall extinction\ncross section remains Lorentzian. The phenomenon is originated in the\ninterference of the selectively excited electric dipolar and quadrupolar modes.\nThe selectivity of the excitation is achieved by the proper choice of the\nfrequency of the incident wave. Thanks to the scaling invariance of the Maxwell\nequations, in these experiments we mimic the scattering of the visible and near\nIR radiation by a nanoparticle made of common superconductor materials (Si, Ge,\nGaAs, GaP) by the equivalent scattering of a spherical particle of 18 mm in\ndiameter in the microwave range. The theory developed to explain the\nexperiments extends the conventional Fano approach to the case when both\ninterfering partitions are resonant. The perfect agreement between the\nexperiment and the theory is demonstrated.\n", "  Photodiodes are widely used to convert lights into electrical signals. The\nconventional silicon (Si) based photodiodes boast high photoelectric conversion\nefficiency and detectivity. However, in general, inorganic-based photodiodes\nhave low visible wavelength sensitivity due to their infrared wavelength\nabsorption. Recently, electrical conducting polymer-based photodiodes have\nreceived significant attention due to their flexibility, low cost of production\nand high sensitivity of visible wavelength ranges. In the present work, we\nfabricated an organic photodiode (OPD) consisting of ITO/ NiOx/ P3HT:PC60BM/\nYbF3/ Al. In the OPD, a yitterbium fluoride (YbF3) buffer layer was used as the\nelectron transport layer. The OPD was analyzed for its optical-electrical\nmeasurements, including J-V characteristics, detectivity and dynamic\ncharacteristics. We have investigated the physical effects of the YbF3 buffer\nlayer on the performance of OPD such as its carrier extraction, leakage current\nand ohmic characteristics.\n", "  Anonymous voting is a voting method of hiding the link between a vote and a\nvoter, the context of which ranges from governmental elections to decision\nmaking in small groups like councils or companies. In this paper, we propose a\nquantum anonymous voting protocol assisted by two kinds of entangled quantum\nstates. Particularly, we provide a mechanism of opening and permuting the\nordered votes of all the voters in an anonymous manner; any party, who is\ninterested in the voting results, can acquire a permutation copy, and then\nobtains the voting result through simple calculation. Unlike all previous\nquantum works on anonymous voting, our quantum anonymous protocol firstly\npossesses the properties of privacy, self-tallying, non-reusability,\nverifiability and fairness at the same time. Besides, we demonstrate that the\nentanglement of the novel quantum states used in our protocol makes the attack\nfrom outside eavesdropper and inside dishonest voters impossible. We also\ngeneralize our protocol to execute tasks of anonymous multi-party computation,\nsuch as anonymous broadcast and anonymous ranking.\n", "  We study the fractionalization of space group symmetries in two-dimensional\ntopologically ordered phases. Specifically, we focus on Z2-fractionalized\nphases in two dimensions whose deconfined topological excitations transform\ntrivially under translational symmetries, but projectively under glide\nreflections, whose quantum numbers are hence fractionalized. We accomplish this\nby generalizing the dichotomy between even and odd gauge theories to\nincorporate additional symmetries inherent to non-symmorphic crystals. We show\nthat the resulting fractionalization of point group quantum numbers can be\ndetected in numerical studies of ground state wave functions. We illustrate\nthese ideas using a microscopic model of a system of bosons at integer unit\ncell filling on a lattice with space group p4g, that can be mapped to a\nhalf-magnetization plateau for an S =1/2 spin system on the Shastry-Sutherland\nlattice.\n", "  From 2013 April to 2014 April, we performed an X-ray and optical simultaneous\nmonitoring of the type 1.5 Seyfert galaxy NGC 3516. It employed Suzaku, and 5\nJapanese ground-based telescopes, the Pirka, Kiso Schmidt, Nayuta, MITSuME, and\nthe Kanata telescopes. The Suzaku observations were conducted seven times with\nvarious intervals ranging from days, weeks, to months, with an exposure of\n$\\sim50$ ksec each. The optical $B$-band observations not only covered those of\nSuzaku almost simultaneously, but also followed the source as frequently as\npossible. As a result, NGC 3516 was found in its faint phase with the 2-10 keV\nflux of $0.21-2.70 \\times 10^{-11}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$. The 2-45 keV X-ray\nspectra were composed of a dominant variable hard power-law continuum with a\nphoton index of $\\sim1.7$, and a non-relativistic reflection component with a\nprominent Fe-K$\\alpha$ emission line. Producing the $B$-band light curve by\ndifferential image photometry, we found that the $B$-band flux changed by\n$\\sim2.7 \\times 10^{-11}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$, which is comparable to the\nX-ray variation, and detected a significant flux correlation between the hard\npower-law component in X-rays and the $B$-band radiation, for the first time in\nNGC 3516. By examining their correlation, we found that the X-ray flux preceded\nthat of $B$ band by $2.0^{+0.7}_{-0.6}$ days ($1\\sigma$ error). Although this\nresult supports the X-ray reprocessing model, the derived lag is too large to\nbe explained by the standard view which assumes a \"lamppost\"-type X-ray\nilluminator located near a standard accretion disk. Our results are better\nexplained by assuming a hot accretion flow and a truncated disk.\n", "  Accurate standardisation of Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) is instrumental to the\nusage of SNIa as distance indicators. We analyse a homogeneous sample of 22\nlow-z SNIa, observed by the Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP) in the optical and\nnear infra-red (NIR). We study the time of the second peak in the NIR band due\nto re-brightening, t2, as an alternative standardisation parameter of SNIa peak\nbrightness. We use BAHAMAS, a Bayesian hierarchical model for SNIa cosmology,\nto determine the residual scatter in the Hubble diagram. We find that in the\nabsence of a colour correction, t2 is a better standardisation parameter\ncompared to stretch: t2 has a 1 sigma posterior interval for the Hubble\nresidual scatter of [0.250, 0.257] , compared to [0.280, 0.287] when stretch\n(x1) alone is used. We demonstrate that when employed together with a colour\ncorrection, t2 and stretch lead to similar residual scatter. Using colour,\nstretch and t2 jointly as standardisation parameters does not result in any\nfurther reduction in scatter, suggesting that t2 carries redundant information\nwith respect to stretch and colour. With a much larger SNIa NIR sample at\nhigher redshift in the future, t2 could be a useful quantity to perform\nrobustness checks of the standardisation procedure.\n", "  For general N=5 and N=6 superconformal field theories in three dimensions, we\ncompute the three-point correlation functions of the supercurrent multiplets.\nIn each case, N=5 and N=6, the functional form of this correlator is uniquely\nfixed modulo an overall coefficient which is related, by superconformal Ward\nidentities, to the parameter in the two-point function of the supercurrent. The\nstructure of the correlation functions obtained is consistent with the property\nthat every N=5 superconformal field theory, considered as a special N=4 theory,\nis invariant under the mirror map.\n", "  We use the linear threshold model to study the diffusion of information on a\nnetwork generated by the stochastic block model. We focus our analysis on a two\ncommunity structure where the initial set of informed nodes lies only in one of\nthe two communities and we look for optimal network structures, i.e. those\nmaximizing the asymptotic extent of the diffusion. We find that, constraining\nthe mean degree and the fraction of initially informed nodes, the optimal\nstructure can be assortative (modular), core-periphery, or even disassortative.\nWe then look for minimal cost structures, i.e. those such that a minimal\nfraction of initially informed nodes is needed to trigger a global cascade. We\nfind that the optimal networks are assortative but with a structure very close\nto a core-periphery graph, i.e. a very dense community linked to a much more\nsparsely connected periphery.\n", "  Imposing infrared boundary conditions on the BFKL equation with running\ncoupling transforms the complex momentum w-plane cut present in the gluon Green\nfunction into an infinite series of positive Regge poles. In addition, a cut on\nthe negative w line remains. We consider a Hermitian kernel at leading order\nwith running coupling and construct the gluon Green function performing the w\nintegration away from the real axis. We find a strong dependence of the\nasymptotic intercepts and collinear behaviour on the non-perturbative choice of\nthe boundary conditions, in the form of an infrared phase. This is particularly\nmanifest in the asymmetric infrared/ultraviolet structure of the associated\ndiffusion in transverse momentum. We find that random walks into the infrared\nregion are largely reduced in this approach.\n", "  We propose a simple model for Dirac neutrinos where the smallness of neutrino\nmass follows from a parameter $\\kappa$ whose absence enhances the symmetry of\nthe theory. The symmetry breaking is performed by a two-doublet Higgs sector\nsupplemented by an extra gauge singlet scalar, realizing an accidental global\n$U(1)$ symmetry. Its spontaneous breaking at the few TeV scale leads to a\nphysical Nambu-Goldstone boson - the $Diracon$, denoted $\\mathcal{D}$ - which\nis restricted by astrophysics and induces invisible Higgs decays $h\\to\n\\mathcal{D} \\mathcal {D}$. The scheme provides a rich, yet very simple\nreference scenario for symmetry breaking studies at colliders such as the LHC.\n", "  We discuss the behavior of solitary wave solutions of the nonlinear\nSchr{\\\"o}dinger equation (NLSE) as they interact with complex potentials, using\na four parameter variational approximation based on a dissipation functional\nformulation of the dynamics. We concentrate on spatially periodic potentials\nwith the periods of the real and imaginary part being either the same or\ndifferent. Our results for the time evolution of the collective coordinates of\nour variational ansatz are in good agreement with direct numerical simulation\nof the NLSE. We compare our method with a collective coordinate approach of\nKominis and give examples where the two methods give qualitatively different\nanswers. In our variational approach, we are able to give analytic results for\nthe small oscillation frequency of the solitary wave oscillating parameters\nwhich agree with the numerical solution of the collective coordinate equations.\nWe also verify that instabilities set in when the slope of $dp(t)/dv(t)$\nbecomes negative when plotted parametrically as a function of time, where\n$p(t)$ is the momentum of the solitary wave and $v(t)$ the velocity.\n", "  Microfocused Brillouin light scattering (BLS) and microwave absorption (MA)\nare used to study magnon-photon coupling in a system consisting of a split-ring\nmicrowave resonator and a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film. The split-ring\nresonantor is defined by optical lithography and loaded with a 1 $\\mu$m-thick\nYIG film grown by liquid phase epitaxy. BLS and MA spectra of the hybrid system\nare simultaneously recorded as a function of the applied magnetic field\nmagnitude and microwave excitation frequency. Strong coupling of the magnon and\nphoton modes is found with a coupling strength of $g_\\text{eff}/2 \\pi = 63$\nMHz. The combined BLS and MA data allows to study the continuous transition of\nthe hybridized modes from a purely magnonic to a purely photonic mode by\nvarying the applied magnetic field and microwave frequency. Furthermore, the\nBLS data represent an up-conversion of the microwave frequency coupling to\noptical frequencies.\n", "  A theoretical frame for two-photon photoemission is derived from the general\ntheory of pump-probe photoemission, assuming that not only the probe but also\nthe pump pulse is sufficiently weak. This allows us to use a perturbative\napproach to compute the lesser Green function within the Keldysh formalism.\nTwo-photon photoemission spectroscopy is a widely used analytical tool to study\nnon-equilibrium phenomena in solid materials. Our theoretical approach aims at\na material-specific, realistic and quantitative description of the\ntime-dependent spectrum based on a picture of effectively independent electrons\nas described by the local-density approximation in band-structure theory. To\nthis end we follow Pendry's one-step theory of the photoemission process as\nclose as possible and heavily make use of concepts of multiple-scattering\ntheory, such as the representation of the final state by a time-reversed\nlow-energy electron diffraction state. The formalism is fully relativistic and\nallows for a quantitative calculation of the time-dependent photocurrent for\nmoderately correlated systems like simple metals or more complex compounds like\ntopological insulators. An application to the Ag(100) surface is discussed in\ndetail.\n", "  The impressive development of global numerical simulations of turbulent\nstellar interiors unveiled a variety of possible differential rotation (solar\nor anti-solar), meridional circulation (single or multi-cellular), and dynamo\nstates (stable large scale toroidal field or periodically reversing magnetic\nfields). Various numerical schemes, based on the so-called anelastic set of\nequations, were used to obtain these results. It appears today mandatory to\nassess their robustness with respect to the details of the numerics, and in\nparticular to the treatment of turbulent sub-grid scales. We report on an\nongoing comparison between two global models, the ASH and EULAG codes. In EULAG\nthe sub-grid scales are treated implicitly by the numerical scheme, while in\nASH their effect is generally modelled by using enhanced dissipation\ncoefficients. We characterize the sub-grid scales effect in a turbulent\nconvection simulation with EULAG. We assess their effect at each resolved scale\nwith a detailed energy budget. We derive equivalent eddy-diffusion coefficients\nand use the derived diffusivities in twin ASH numerical simulations. We find a\ngood agreement between the large-scale flows developing in the two codes in the\nhydrodynamic regime, which encourages further investigation in the\nmagnetohydrodynamic regime for various dynamo solutions.\n", "  Future dark matter detectors plan to have sensitivities such that solar\nneutrinos will start to become a problematic background. In this work we show\nthat a polarised helium-3 detector would in principle be able to eliminate 98%\nof these events when the orientation of the polarisation axis is antiparallel\nto the direction of the Sun. We comment on the possible improvement in\nsensitivity of dark matter direct detection experiments due to this effect and\nthe feasibility of building such a detector.\n", "  We report on fabricating high-fill-factor plano-convex spherical and square\nmicro-lens arrays on fused silica glass surface using CO2 laser assisted\nreshaping technique. Initially, periodic micro-pillars have been encoded on the\nglass surface by means of a femtosecond laser beam. Afterwards, the\nmicro-pillars are polished several times by irradiating a CO2 laser beam on top\nof the micro-pillars. Consequently, spherical micro-lens array with micro-lens\nsize of 50 um x 50 um and square micro-lens array with micro-lens size of 100\num x 100 um are formed on fused silica glass surface. We also study the\nintensity distribution of light passed through the spherical micro-lens array\nengraved glass sample. The simulation result shows that, the focal length of\nthe spherical micro-lens array is 35 um. Furthermore, we investigate the\noptical properties of the micro-lens array engraved glass samples. The proposed\nCO2 laser based reshaping technique is simple and fast that shows promises in\nfabrication arrays of smooth micro-lenses in various transparent materials.\n", "  For the past ten years $R_{AA}(p_T)$, the nuclear modification factor that\nencodes the suppression of high $p_T$ particles due to energy loss within the\nmedium was fairly well described by many theoretical models. However, the same\nmodels systematically under-predicted the high $p_T$ elliptic flow, $v_2$,\nwhich is experimentally measured as the correlation between soft and hard\nhadrons. All previous calculations neglected the effect of event-by-event\nfluctuations of an expanding viscous hydrodynamical background as well as the\nsoft-hard flow harmonic correlations in the experimentally measured $v_2$. In\nthis talk I show how event-by-event viscous hydrodynamics (computed using the\nv-USPhydro code) coupled to an energy loss model (BBMG) is able to\nsimultaneously describe soft physics observables as well as the high-$p_T$\n$R_{AA}$ and $v_2$. Suggestions for future more differential calculations at\nthe LHC run2 are made to explore soft-hard flow correlations.\n", "  The Brydges-Imbrie dimensional reduction formula relates the pressure of a\n$d$-dimensional gas of hard spheres to a model of $(d+2)$-dimensional branched\npolymers. Brydges and Imbrie's proof was non-constructive and relied on a\nsupersymmetric localization lemma. The main result of this article is a\nconstructive proof of a more general dimensional reduction formula that\ncontains the Brydges--Imbrie formula as a special case. Central to the proof\nare invariance lemmas, which were first introduced by Kenyon and Winkler for\nbranched polymers. The new dimensional reduction formulas rely on invariance\nlemmas for central hyperplane arrangements that are due to M\\'esz\\'aros and\nPostnikov.\n  Several applications are presented, notably dimensional reduction formulas\nfor (i) non-spherical bodies and (ii) for corrections to the pressure due to\nsymmetry effects.\n", "  We investigate the replicator dynamics with \"sparse\" symmetric interactions\nwhich represent specialist-specialist interactions in ecological communities.\nBy considering a large self interaction $u$, we conduct a perturbative\nexpansion which manifests that the nature of the interactions has a direct\nimpact on the species abundance distribution. The central results are all\nspecies coexistence in a realistic range of the model parameters and that a\ncertain discrete nature of the interactions induces multiple peaks in the\nspecies abundance distribution, providing the possibility of theoretically\nexplaining multiple peaks observed in various field studies. To get more\nquantitative information, we also construct a non-perturbative theory which\nbecomes exact on tree-like networks if all the species coexist, providing exact\ncritical values of $u$ below which extinct species emerge. Numerical\nsimulations in various different situations are conducted and they clarify the\nrobustness of the presented mechanism of all species coexistence and multiple\npeaks in the species abundance distributions.\n", "  The addition of supersymmetric Chern-Simons terms to ${\\cal N}=8$\nsuper-Yang-Mills theory in three-dimensions is expected to make the latter flow\ninto infrared superconformal phases. We address this problem holographically by\nstudying the effect of the Romans mass on the D2-brane near-horizon geometry.\nWorking in a consistent, effective four-dimensional setting provided by $D=4$\n${\\cal N}=8$ supergravity with a dyonic $\\textrm{ISO(7)}$ gauging, we verify\nthe existence of a rich web of supersymmetric domain walls triggered by the\nRomans mass that interpolate between the (four-dimensional description of the)\nD2-brane and various superconformal phases. We also construct domain walls for\nwhich both endpoints are superconformal. While most of our results are\nnumerical, we provide analytic results for the $\\textrm{SU}(3)\\times\n\\textrm{U}(1)$-invariant flow into an ${\\cal N}=2$ conformal phase recently\ndiscovered.\n", "  It has been shown recently that the anomalies observed in $\\bar B\\to\nD^{(\\ast)}\\tau\\bar\\nu_\\tau$ and $\\bar B\\to \\bar K\\ell^+\\ell^-$ decays could be\nresolved with just one scalar leptoquark. Fitting to the current data on\n$R(D^{(\\ast)})$ along with acceptable $q^2$ distributions in $\\bar B\\to\nD^{(\\ast)}\\tau\\bar\\nu_\\tau$ decays, four best-fit solutions for the operator\ncoefficients have been found. In this paper, we explore the possibilities of\nhow to discriminate these four solutions. Firstly, we find that two of them are\nalready excluded by the decay $B_c^-\\to \\tau^-\\bar\\nu_\\tau$, because the\npredicted decay widths have already overshot the total width $\\Gamma_{B_c}$. It\nis then found that the remaining two solutions result in two effective\nHamiltonians governing $b\\to c \\tau \\bar\\nu_{\\tau}$ transition, which differ by\na sign and enhance the absolute value of the coefficient of $\\bar c_L\\gamma_\\mu\nb_L\\,\\bar \\tau_L\\gamma^\\mu{\\nu_\\tau}_L$ operator by about $12\\%$. However, they\ngive nearly the same predictions as in the SM for the $D^\\ast$ and $\\tau$\nlongitudinal polarizations as well as the lepton forward-backward asymmetries\nin $\\bar B\\to D^{(\\ast)}\\tau\\bar\\nu_\\tau$ decays. For the other observables\nlike $\\mathcal B(B_c^-\\to \\tau^-\\bar\\nu_\\tau)$, $\\mathcal B(B_c^- \\to\n\\gamma\\tau^-\\bar\\nu_\\tau)$, $R_{D^{(\\ast)}}(q^2)$, ${\\rm d}\\mathcal B(\\bar B\\to\nD^{(\\ast)}\\tau\\bar\\nu_\\tau)/{\\rm d}q^2$ and $\\mathcal B(\\bar B\\to\nX_c\\tau\\bar\\nu_\\tau)$, on the other hand, the two solutions give sizable\nenhancements relative to the SM predictions. With measurement of $B_c^-\\to\n\\tau^-\\bar\\nu_\\tau$ at LHCb and refined measurements of observables in $\\bar\nB\\to D^{(\\ast)}\\tau\\bar\\nu_\\tau$ at both LHCb and Belle-II, such a specific NP\nscenario could be further deciphered.\n", "  Motivated by advances in observational searches for sub-parsec supermassive\nblack hole binaries (SBHBs) made in the past few years we develop a\nsemi-analytic model to describe spectral emission line signatures of these\nsystems. The goal of this study is to aid the interpretation of spectroscopic\nsearches for binaries and help test one of the leading models of binary\naccretion flows in the literature: SBHB in a circumbinary disk. In this work we\npresent the methodology and a comparison of the preliminary model with the\ndata. We model SBHB accretion flows as a set of three accretion disks: two\nmini-disks that are gravitationally bound to the individual black holes and a\ncircumbinary disk. Given a physically motivated parameter space occupied by\nsub-parsec SBHBs, we calculate a synthetic database of nearly 15 million broad\noptical emission line profiles and explore the dependence of the profile shapes\non characteristic properties of SBHBs. We find that the modeled profiles show\ndistinct statistical properties as a function of the semi-major axis, mass\nratio, eccentricity of the binary, and the degree of alignment of the triple\ndisk system. This suggests that the broad emission line profiles from SBHB\nsystems can in principle be used to infer the distribution of these parameters\nand as such merit further investigation. Calculated profiles are more\nmorphologically heterogeneous than the broad emission lines in observed SBHB\ncandidates and we discuss improved treatment of radiative transfer effects\nwhich will allow direct statistical comparison of the two groups.\n", "  The angular diameter distance of lens, $D_{Aol}$, of strong gravitational\nlensing systems has been claimed as a cosmic standard ruler. The first\nmeasurements for this distance were recently obtained to two well-known\nsystems: B1608+656 and RXJ1131-1231. However, there is a range of possible\nsystematic uncertainties which must be addressed in order to turn these systems\ninto useful cosmic probes. In this paper, we confront $D_{Aol}$ with luminosity\ndistances of type Ia supernovae and angular diameter distances of galaxy\nclusters to search for tensions between these cosmological measurements using\nthe cosmic distance duality relation. No tension was verified with the present\ndata, showing the robustness of the assumptions used to describe the lens\nsystems.\n", "  In high energy collisions involving small nuclei (p+p or x+Au collisions\nwhere x=p, d, or $^3$He) the fluctuating size, shape and internal gluonic\nstructure of the nucleon is shown to have a strong effect on the initial size\nand shape of the fireball of new matter created in the collision. A systematic\nstudy of the eccentricity coefficients describing this initial fireball state\nfor several semi-realistic models of nucleon substructure and for several\npractically relevant collision systems involving small nuclei is presented. The\nkey importance of multiplicity fluctuations in such systems is pointed out. Our\nresults show large differences from expectations based on conventional Glauber\nmodel simulations of the initial state created in such collisions.\n", "  We present a new method for modeling electronically excited states that\novercomes a key failing of linear response theory by allowing the underlying\nground state ansatz to relax in the presence of an excitation. The method is\nvariational, has a cost similar to ground state variational Monte Carlo, and\nadmits both open and periodic boundary conditions. We present preliminary\nnumerical results showing that, when paired with the Jastrow antisymmetric\ngeminal power ansatz, the variation-after-response formalism delivers\naccuracies for valence and charge transfer single excitations on par with\nequation of motion coupled cluster, while surpassing even this very high-level\nmethod's accuracy for excitations with significant doubly excited character.\n", "  Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (SQUID) microscopy has excellent\nmagnetic field sensitivity, but suffers from modest spatial resolution when\ncompared with other scanning probes. This spatial resolution is determined by\nboth the size of the field sensitive area and the spacing between this area and\nthe sample surface. In this paper we describe scanning SQUID susceptometers\nthat achieve sub-micron spatial resolution while retaining a white noise floor\nflux sensitivity of $\\approx 2\\mu\\Phi_0/Hz^{1/2}$. This high spatial resolution\nis accomplished by deep sub-micron feature sizes, well shielded pickup loops\nfabricated using a planarized process, and a deep etch step that minimizes the\nspacing between the sample surface and the SQUID pickup loop. We describe the\ndesign, modeling, fabrication, and testing of these sensors. Although\nsub-micron spatial resolution has been achieved previously in scanning SQUID\nsensors, our sensors not only achieve high spatial resolution, but also have\nintegrated modulation coils for flux feedback, integrated field coils for\nsusceptibility measurements, and batch processing. They are therefore a\ngenerally applicable tool for imaging sample magnetization, currents, and\nsusceptibilities with higher spatial resolution than previous susceptometers.\n", "  We study 50 cosmic ray Forbush decreases (FDs) from the Oulu neutron monitor\ndata during 1997-2005 that were associated with Earth-directed interplanetary\ncoronal mass ejections (ICMEs). Such events are generally thought to arise due\nto the shielding of cosmic rays by a propagating diffusive barrier. The main\nprocesses at work are the diffusion of cosmic rays across the large-scale\nmagnetic fields carried by the ICME and their advection by the solar wind. In\nan attempt to better understand the relative importance of these effects, we\nanalyse the relationship between the FD profiles and those of the\ninterplanetary magnetic field (B) and the solar wind speed (Vsw). Over the\nentire duration of a given FD, we find that the FD profile is generally well\n(anti)correlated with the B and Vsw profiles. This trend holds separately for\nthe FD main and recovery phases too. For the recovery phases, however, the FD\nprofile is highly anti-correlated with the Vsw profile, but not with the B\nprofile. While the total duration of the FD profile is similar to that of the\nVsw profile, it is significantly longer than that of the B profile.\n", "  Boron nitride single layer belongs to the family of 2D materials whose\noptical properties are currently receiving considerable attention. Strong\nexcitonic effects have already been observed in the bulk and still stronger\neffects are predicted for single layers. We present here a detailed study of\nthese properties by combining \\textit{ab initio} calculations and a\ntight-binding-Wannier analysis in both real and reciprocal space. Due to the\nsimplicity of the band structure with single valence ($\\pi$) and conduction\n($\\pi^*$) bands the tight-binding analysis becomes quasi quantitative with only\ntwo adjustable parameters and provides tools for a detailed analysis of the\nexciton properties. Strong deviations from the usual hydrogenic model are\nevidenced. The ground state exciton is not a genuine Frenkel exciton, but a\nvery localized \"tightly-bound\" one. The other ones are similar to those found\nin transition metal dichalcogenides and, although more localized, can be\ndescribed within a Wannier-Mott scheme.\n", "  Digital quantum simulation of fermionic systems is important in the context\nof chemistry and physics. Simulating fermionic models on general purpose\nquantum computers requires imposing a fermionic algebra on spins. The\npreviously studied Jordan-Wigner and Bravyi-Kitaev transformations are two\ntechniques for accomplishing this task. Here we re-examine an auxiliary fermion\nconstruction which maps fermionic operators to local operators on spins. The\nlocal simulation is performed by relaxing the requirement that the number of\nspins should match the number of fermionic modes. Instead, auxiliary modes are\nintroduced to enable non-consecutive fermionic couplings to be simulated with\nconstant low-rank tensor products on spins. We connect the auxiliary fermion\nconstruction to other topological models and give examples of the construction.\n", "  The immediate vicinity of T Tauri was observed with the new high-contrast\nimaging instrument SPHERE at the VLT to resolve remaining mysteries of the\nsystem, such as the putative small edge-on disk around T Tauri Sa, and the\nassignment of the complex outflow patterns to the individual stars. We used\nSPHERE IRDIS narrow-band classical imaging in Pa$\\beta$, Br$\\gamma$, and the\n$\\nu$ = 1-0 S(1) line of H$_2$, as well as in the nearby continua to obtain\nhigh spatial resolution and high contrast images over the NIR spectral range.\nLine maps were created by subtracting the nearby continuum. We also\nre--analyzed coronagraphic data taken with SPHERE's integral field spectrograph\nin $J$- and $H$-band with the goal to obtain a precise extinction estimate to T\nTauri Sb, and to verify the recently reported claim of another stellar or\nsubstellar object in the system. A previously unknown coiling structure is\nobserved southwest of the stars in reflected light, which points to the\nvicinity of T Tauri N. We map the circumbinary emission from T Tauri S in $J$-\nand $H$-band scattered light for the first time, showing a morphology which\ndiffers significantly from that observed in $K$-band. H$_2$ emission is found\nsouthwest of the stars, near the coiling structure. We also detect the H$_2$\nemitting region T Tauri NW. The motion of T Tauri NW with respect to T Tauri N\nand S between previous images and our 2014 data, provides strong evidence that\nthe Southeast-Northwest outflow triggering T Tauri NW is likely to be\nassociated with T Tauri S. We further present accurate relative photometry of\nthe stars, confirming that T Tauri Sa is brightening again. Our analysis rules\nout the presence of the recently proposed companion to T Tauri N with high\nconfidence.\n", "  We discuss a simple model of thermal relic dark matter whose mass can be much\nlarger than the so-called unitarity limit on the mass of point-like particle\ndark matter. The model consists of new strong dynamics with one flavor of\nfermions in the fundamental representation which is much heavier than the\ndynamical scale of the new strong dynamics. Dark matter is identified with the\nlightest baryonic hadron of the new dynamics. The baryonic hadrons annihilate\ninto the mesonic hadrons of the new strong dynamics when they have large radii.\nResultantly, thermal relic dark matter with a mass in the PeV range is\npossible.\n", "  We report a theory deriving bulk flow scaling for canonical wall-bounded\nflows. The theory accounts for the symmetries of boundary geometry (flat plate\nchannel versus circular pipe) by a variational calculation for a large-scale\nenergy length, which characterizes its bulk flow scaling by a simple exponent,\ni.e. $m=4$ for channel and 5 for pipe. The predicted mean velocity shows\nexcellent agreement with several dozen sets of quality empirical data for a\nwide range of the Reynolds number (Re), with a universal bulk flow constant\n$\\kappa\\approx0.45$. Predictions for dissipation and turbulent transport in the\nbulk flow are also given, awaiting data verification.\n", "  By using the Zubarev nonequilibrium statistical operator method, and the\nLiouville equation with fractional derivatives, a generalized diffusion\nequation with fractional derivatives is obtained within the Renyi statistics.\nAveraging in generalized diffusion coefficient is performed with a power\ndistribution with the Renyi parameter $q$.\n", "  A dynamic electrical model is introduced to investigate the hysteretic\neffects in the I-V characteristics of perovskite based solar cells. By making a\nsimple ansatz for the polarization relaxation, our model is able to reproduce\nqualitatively and quantitatively detailed features of measured I-V\ncharacteristics. Pre-poling effects are discussed, pointing out the differences\nbetween initially over- and under-polarized samples. In particular, the\npresence of the current over-shoot observed in the reverse characteristics is\ncorrelated with the solar cell pre-conditioning. Furthermore, the dynamic\nhysteresis is analyzed with respect to changing the bias scan rate, the\nobtained results being consistent with experimentally reported data: the\nhysteresis amplitude is maximum at intermediate scan rates, while at very slow\nand very fast ones it becomes negligible. The effects induced by different\nrelaxation time scales are assessed. The proposed dynamic electrical model\noffers a comprehensive view of the solar cell operation, being a practical tool\nfor future calibration of tentative microscopic descriptions.\n", "  Here we describe the observation and calibration procedure for a new G140L\nobserving mode for the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) aboard the Hubble\nSpace Telescope (HST). This mode, CENWAV = 800, is designed to move the far-UV\nband fully onto the Segment A detector, allowing for more e cient ob- servation\nand analysis by simplifying calibration management between the two channels,\nand reducing the astigmatism in this wavelength region. We also de- scribe some\nof the areas of scientific interest for which this new mode will be especially\nsuited.\n", "  We present the first measurements of the shape of the far-ultraviolet\n(far-UV; lambda=950-1500 A) dust attenuation curve at high redshift (z~3). Our\nanalysis employs rest-frame UV spectra of 933 galaxies at z~3, 121 of which\nhave very deep spectroscopic observations (>7 hrs) at lambda=850-1300 A, with\nthe Low Resolution Imaging Spectrograph on the Keck Telescope. By using an\niterative approach in which we calculate the ratios of composite spectra in\ndifferent bins of continuum color excess, E(B-V), we derive a dust curve that\nimplies a lower attenuation in the far-UV for a given E(B-V) than those\nobtained with standard attenuation curves. We demonstrate that the UV composite\nspectra of z~3 galaxies can be modeled well by assuming our new attenuation\ncurve, a high covering fraction of HI, and absorption from the Lyman-Werner\nbands of H2 with a small (<20%) covering fraction. The low covering fraction of\nH2 relative to that of the HI and dust suggests that most of the dust in the\nISM of typical galaxies at z~3 is unrelated to the catalysis of H2, and is\nassociated with other phases of the ISM (i.e., the ionized and neutral gas).\nThe far-UV dust curve implies a factor of ~2 lower dust attenuation of Lyman\ncontinuum (ionizing) photons relative to those inferred from the most commonly\nassumed attenuation curves for L* galaxies at z~3. Our results may be utilized\nto assess the degree to which ionizing photons are attenuated in HII regions\nor, more generally, in the ionized or low column density (N(HI)<10^17.2 cm^-2)\nneutral ISM of high-redshift galaxies.\n", "  The motion of a pseudo-scalar field $X$ during inflation naturally induces a\nsignificant amplification of the gauge fields to which it is coupled. The\namplified gauge fields can source characteristic scalar and tensor primordial\nperturbations. Several phenomenological implications have been discussed in the\ncases in which (i) $X$ is the inflation, and (ii) $X$ is a field different from\nthe inflation, that experiences a temporary speed up during inflation. In this\nsecond case, visible sourced gravitational waves (GW) can be produced at the\nCMB scales without affecting the scalar perturbations, even if the scale of\ninflation is several orders of magnitude below what is required to produce a\nvisible vacuum GW signal. Perturbativity considerations can be used to limit\nthe regime in which these results are under perturbative control. We revised\nlimits recently claimed for the case (i), and we extend these considerations to\nthe case (ii). We show that, in both cases, these limits are satisfied by the\napplications that generate signals at CMB scales. Applications that generate\ngravitational waves and primordial black holes at much smaller scales are at\nthe limit of the validity of this perturbativity analysis, so we expect those\nresults to be valid up to possibly order one corrections.\n", "  We study the effects of a parity-odd \"odderon\" correlation in JIMWLK\nrenormalization group evolution at high energy. Firstly we show that in the\neikonal picture where the scattering is described by Wilson lines, one obtains\na strict mathematical upper limit for the magnitude of the odderon amplitude\ncompared to the parity even pomeron one. This limit increases with N_c,\napproaching infinity in the infinite N_c limit. We use a systematic extension\nof the Gaussian approximation including both 2- and 3-point correlations which\nenables us to close the system of equations even at finite N_c. In the\nlarge-N_c limit we recover an evolution equation derived earlier. By solving\nthis equation numerically we confirm that the odderon amplitude decreases\nfaster in the nonlinear case than in the linear BFKL limit. We also point out\nthat, in the 3-point truncation at finite N_c, the presence of an odderon\ncomponent introduces azimuthal angular correlations ~ cos(n phi) at all n.\n", "  We present an exhaustive mathematical analysis of the recently proposed\nNon-Poissonian Ac- tivity Driven (NoPAD) model [Moinet et al. Phys. Rev. Lett.,\n114 (2015)], a temporal network model incorporating the empirically observed\nbursty nature of social interactions. We focus on the aging effects emerging\nfrom the Non-Poissonian dynamics of link activation, and on their effects on\nthe topological properties of time-integrated networks, such as the degree\ndistribution. Analytic expressions for the degree distribution of integrated\nnetworks as a function of time are derived, ex- ploring both limits of\nvanishing and strong aging. We also address the percolation process occurring\non these temporal networks, by computing the threshold for the emergence of a\ngiant connected component, highlighting the aging dependence. Our analytic\npredictions are checked by means of extensive numerical simulations of the\nNoPAD model.\n", "  We present an effective and simple multiscale method for equilibrating Kremer\nGrest model polymer melts of varying stiffness. In our approach, we\nprogressively equilibrate the melt structure above the tube scale, inside the\ntube and finally at the monomeric scale. We make use of models designed to be\ncomputationally effective at each scale. Density fluctuations in the melt\nstructure above the tube scale are minimized through a Monte Carlo simulated\nannealing of a lattice polymer model. Subsequently the melt structure below the\ntube scale is equilibrated via the Rouse dynamics of a force-capped\nKremer-Grest model that allows chains to partially interpenetrate. Finally the\nKremer-Grest force field is introduced to freeze the topological state and\nenforce correct monomer packing. We generate $15$ melts of $500$ chains of\n$10.000$ beads for varying chain stiffness as well as a number of melts with\n$1.000$ chains of $15.000$ monomers. To validate the equilibration process we\nstudy the time evolution of bulk, collective and single-chain observables at\nthe monomeric, mesoscopic and macroscopic length scales. Extension of the\npresent method to longer, branched or polydisperse chains and/or larger system\nsizes is straight forward.\n", "  In this paper we study the recently proposed tensor networks/AdS\ncorrespondence. We found that the Coxeter group is a useful tool to describe\ntensor networks in a negatively curved space. Studying generic tensor network\npopulated by perfect tensors, we find that the physical wave function\ngenerically do not admit any connected correlation functions of local\noperators. To remedy the problem, we assume that wavefunctions admitting such\nsemi-classical gravitational interpretation are composed of tensors close to,\nbut not exactly perfect tensors. Computing corrections to the connected two\npoint correlation functions, we find that the leading contribution is given by\nstructures related to geodesics connecting the operators inserted at the\nboundary physical dofs. Such considerations admit generalizations at least to\nthree point functions. This is highly suggestive of the emergence of the\nanalogues of Witten diagrams in the tensor network. The perturbations alone\nhowever do not give the right entanglement spectrum. Using the Coxeter\nconstruction, we also constructed the tensor network counterpart of the BTZ\nblack hole, by orbifolding the discrete lattice on which the network resides.\nWe found that the construction naturally reproduces some of the salient\nfeatures of the BTZ black hole, such as the appearance of RT surfaces that\ncould wrap the horizon, depending on the size of the entanglement region A.\n", "  There are five maximally supersymmetric backgrounds in four-dimensional\noff-shell N=1 supergravity, two of which are well known: Minkowski superspace\nM^{4|4} and anti-de Sitter superspace AdS^{4|4}. The three remaining\nsupermanifolds support spacetimes of different topology, which are: R x S^3,\nAdS_3 x R, and a supersymmetric plane wave isometric to the Nappi-Witten group.\nAs is well known, the Minkowski and anti-de Sitter superspaces are solutions of\nthe Poincar\\'e and anti-de Sitter supergravity theories, respectively. Here we\ndemonstrate that the other three superspaces are solutions of no-scale $R^2$\nsupergravity. We also present a new (probably the simplest) derivation of the\nmaximally supersymmetric backgrounds of off-shell N=1 supergravity.\n", "  The hybrid graphene - hexagonal boron nitride (G-hBN) systems offer new\nroutes in the design of nanoscale electronic devices. Using {\\it ab initio}\ndensity functional theory calculations we investigate the dynamics of zig-zag\nnanoribbons a few interatomic distances wide. Several structures are analyzed,\nnamely pristine graphene, hBN and G-hBN systems. By passivating the nanoribbon\nedges with hydrogen and different halogen atoms, one may tune the electronic\nand mechanical properties, like the band gap energies and the natural\nfrequencies of vibration.\n", "  Based on current CERN infrastructure, an electron--proton collider is\nproposed at a centre-of-mass energy of about 9 TeV. A 7 TeV LHC bunch is used\nas the proton driver to create a plasma wakefield which then accelerates\nelectrons to 3\\,TeV, these then colliding with the other 7 TeV LHC proton beam.\nAlthough of very high energy, the collider has a modest projected integrated\nluminosity of $10-100$ pb$^{-1}$. For such a collider, with a centre-of-mass\nenergy 30 times greater than HERA, parton momentum fractions, $x$, down to\nabout $10^{-8}$ are accessible for photon virtualities, $Q^2$, of 1 GeV$^2$.\nThe energy dependence of hadronic cross sections at high energies, such as the\nthe total photon--proton cross section, which has synergy with cosmic-ray\nphysics, can be measured and QCD and the structure of matter better understood\nin a region where the effects are completely unknown. Searches at high $Q^2$\nfor physics beyond the Standard Model will be possible, in particular the\nsignificantly increased sensitivity to the production of leptoquarks. These and\nother physics highlights of a very high energy electron--proton collider are\noutlined.\n", "  There are two general requirements to harness the computational power of\nquantum mechanics: the ability to manipulate the evolution of an isolated\nsystem and the ability to faithfully extract information from it. Quantum error\ncorrection and simulation often make a more exacting demand: the ability to\nperform non-destructive measurements of specific correlations within that\nsystem. We realize such measurements by employing a protocol adapted from [S.\nNigg and S. M. Girvin, Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 243604 (2013)], enabling real-time\nselection of arbitrary register-wide Pauli operators. Our implementation\nconsists of a simple circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) module of four\nhighly-coherent 3D transmon qubits, collectively coupled to a high-Q\nsuperconducting microwave cavity. As a demonstration, we enact all seven\nnontrivial subset-parity measurements on our three-qubit register. For each we\nfully characterize the realized measurement by analyzing the detector\n(observable operators) via quantum detector tomography and by analyzing the\nquantum back-action via conditioned process tomography. No single quantity\ncompletely encapsulates the performance of a measurement, and standard figures\nof merit have not yet emerged. Accordingly, we consider several new fidelity\nmeasures for both the detector and the complete measurement process. We measure\nall of these quantities and report high fidelities, indicating that we are\nmeasuring the desired quantities precisely and that the measurements are highly\nnon-demolition. We further show that both results are improved significantly by\nan additional error-heralding measurement. The analyses presented here form a\nuseful basis for the future characterization and validation of quantum\nmeasurements, anticipating the demands of emerging quantum technologies.\n", "  A statistical study of finite Larmor radius (FLR) effects on transport driven\nby electrostatic drift-waves is presented. The study is based on a reduced\ndiscrete Hamiltonian dynamical system known as the gyro-averaged standard map\n(GSM). In this system, FLR effects are incorporated through the gyro-averaging\nof a simplified weak-turbulence model of electrostatic fluctuations. Formally,\nthe GSM is a modified version of the standard map in which the perturbation\namplitude, $K_0$, becomes $K_0 J_0(\\hat{\\rho})$, where $J_0$ is the\nzeroth-order Bessel function and $\\hat{\\rho}$ is the Larmor radius. Assuming a\nMaxwellian probability density function (pdf) for $\\hat{\\rho}$, we compute\nanalytically and numerically the pdf and the cumulative distribution function\nof the effective drift-wave perturbation amplitude $K_0 J_0(\\hat{\\rho})$. Using\nthese results we compute the probability of loss of confinement (i.e., global\nchaos), $P_{c}$, and the probability of trapping in the main drift-wave\nresonance, $P_{t}$. It is shown that $P_{c}$ provides an upper bound for the\nescape rate, and that $P_{t}$ provides a good estimate of the particle trapping\nrate. The analytical results are compared with direct numerical Monte-Carlo\nsimulations of particle transport.\n", "  Motivated by gauge coupling unification and dark matter, we present an\nextension to the Standard Model where both are achieved by adding an extra new\nmatter multiplet. Such considerations lead to a Grand Unified Theory with very\nheavy WIMPzilla dark matter, which has mass greater than ~10^7 GeV and must be\nproduced before reheating ends. Naturally, we refer to this scenario as\nGUTzilla dark matter. Here we present a minimal GUTzilla model, adding a\nvector-like quark multiplet to the Standard Model. Proton decay constraints\nrequire the new multiplet to be both color and electroweak charged, which\nprompts us to include a new confining SU(3) gauge group that binds the\nmultiplet into a neutral composite dark matter candidate. Current direct\ndetection constraints are evaded due to the large dark matter mass; meanwhile,\nnext-generation direct detection and proton decay experiments will probe much\nof the parameter space. The relic abundance is strongly dependent on the\ndynamics of the hidden confining sector, and we show that dark matter\nproduction during the epoch of reheating can give the right abundance.\n", "  Motivated by recent developments in the experimental study of superconducting\ngraphene and transition metal dichalcogenides, we investigate superconductivity\nof the Kane-Mele (KM) model with short-range attractive interactions on the\ntwo-dimensional honeycomb lattice. We show that intra-valley spin-triplet\npairing arises from nearest-neighbor (NN) attractive interaction and the\nintrinsic spin-orbit coupling. We demonstrate this in two independent\napproaches: We study superconducting instability driven by condensation of\nCooperons, which are in-gap bound states of two conduction electrons, within\nthe $T$-matrix approximation and also study the superconducting ground state\nwithin the mean-field theory. We find that Cooperons with antiparallel spins\ncondense at the $K$ and $K'$ points. This leads to the emergence of an\nintra-valley spin-triplet pairing state belonging to the irreducible\nrepresentation A$_1$ of the point group $C_{6v}$. The fact that this pairing\nstate has opposite chirality for $K$ and $K'$ identifies this state as a\n\"helical\" valley-triplet state, the valley-analog to the $^3$He-B phase in two\ndimension. Because of the finite center of mass momentum of Cooper pairs, the\npair amplitude in NN bonds exhibits spatial modulation on the length scale of\nlattice constant, such that this pairing state may be viewed as a pair-density\nwave state. We find that the pair amplitude spontaneously breaks the\ntranslational symmetry and exhibits a $p$-Kekul\\'e pattern. We also discuss the\nselection rule for pairing states focusing the characteristic band structure of\nthe KM model and the Berry phase effects to the emergence of the intra-valley\npairing state.\n", "  We calculate charmonium correlators on the lattice with 2+1-flavors of sea\nquarks and charm valence quark both described by the M\\\"obius domain-wall\nfermion. Temporal moments of the correlators are calculated and matched to\nperturbative QCD formulae to extract the charm quark mass $m_c(\\mu)$ and strong\ncoupling constant $\\alpha_s(\\mu)$. Lattice data at three lattice spacings,\n0.044, 0.055, and 0.080~fm, are extrapolated to the continuum limit. The\ncorrelators in the vector channel are confirmed to be consistent with the\nexperimental data for $e^+e^-\\to c\\bar{c}$, while the pseudo-scalar channel is\nused to extract $m_c(\\mu)$ and $\\alpha_s(\\mu)$. We obtain $m_\\mathrm{c}(3\n\\mathrm{\\ GeV})$ = 1.003(10)~GeV and\n$\\alpha_s^{\\bar{\\mathrm{MS}}(4)}(3\\mathrm{\\ GeV})$ = 0.253(13). Dominant source\nof the error is the truncation of perturbative expansion at $\\alpha_s^3$.\n", "  Building on work of Meixner [J. Meixner, Z. Naturforschung 3a, 506 (1948)],\nwe show how to compute the exact scattering amplitude (or $T$-matrix) for\nelectromagnetic scattering from a perfectly conducting disk. This calculation\nis a rare example of a non-diagonal $T$-matrix that can nonetheless be obtained\nin a semi-analytic form. We then use this result to compute the electromagnetic\nCasimir interaction energy for a disk opposite a plane, for arbitrary\norientation angle of the disk, for separations greater than the disk radius. We\nfind that the proximity force approximation (PFA) significantly overestimates\nthe Casimir energy, both in the case of the ordinary PFA, which applies when\nthe disk is parallel to the plane, and the \"edge PFA,\" which applies when the\ndisk is perpendicular to the plane.\n", "  The decoy-state high-dimensional quantum key distribution provides a\npractical secure way to share more private information with high\nphoton-information efficiency. In this paper, based on detector-decoy method,\nwe propose a detector-decoy high-dimensional quantum key distribution protocol.\nEmploying threshold detectors and a variable attenuator, we can estimate\nsingle-photon fraction of postselected events and Eves Holevo information under\nthe Gaussian collective attack with much simpler operations in practical\nimplementation. By numerical evaluation, we show that without varying source\nintensity and optimizing decoy-state intensity, our protocol could perform much\nbetter than one-decoy-state protocol and as well as the two-decoy-state\nprotocol. Specially, when the detector efficiency is lower, the advantage of\nthe detector-decoy method becomes more prominent.\n", "  We compare GW150914 directly to simulations of coalescing binary black holes\nin full general relativity, accounting for all the spin-weighted quadrupolar\nmodes, and separately accounting for all the quadrupolar and octopolar modes.\nConsistent with the posterior distributions reported in LVC_PE[1] (at 90%\nconfidence), we find the data are compatible with a wide range of nonprecessing\nand precessing simulations. Followup simulations performed using\npreviously-estimated binary parameters most resemble the data. Comparisons\nincluding only the quadrupolar modes constrain the total redshifted mass Mz \\in\n[64 - 82M_\\odot], mass ratio q = m2/m1 \\in [0.6,1], and effective aligned spin\n\\chi_eff \\in [-0.3, 0.2], where \\chi_{eff} = (S1/m1 + S2/m2) \\cdot\\hat{L} /M.\nIncluding both quadrupolar and octopolar modes, we find the mass ratio is even\nmore tightly constrained. Simulations with extreme mass ratios and effective\nspins are highly inconsistent with the data, at any mass. Several nonprecessing\nand precessing simulations with similar mass ratio and \\chi_{eff} are\nconsistent with the data. Though correlated, the components' spins (both in\nmagnitude and directions) are not significantly constrained by the data. For\nnonprecessing binaries, interpolating between simulations, we reconstruct a\nposterior distribution consistent with previous results. The final black hole's\nredshifted mass is consistent with Mf,z between 64.0 - 73.5M_\\odot and the\nfinal black hole's dimensionless spin parameter is consistent with af = 0.62 -\n0.73. As our approach invokes no intermediate approximations to general\nrelativity and can strongly reject binaries whose radiation is inconsistent\nwith the data, our analysis provides a valuable complement to LVC_PE[1].\n", "  We discuss new Keck/MOSFIRE spectroscopic observations of four luminous\ngalaxies at z~7-9 selected to have intense optical line emission by\nRoberts-Borsani et al. (2016). Previous follow-up has revealed Lyman-alpha in\ntwo of the four galaxies. Our new MOSFIRE observations confirm that Lyman-alpha\nis present in the entire sample. We detect Lyman-alpha emission in COS-zs7-1,\nconfirming its redshift as z=7.154, and we detect Lyman-alpha in EGS-zs8-2 at\nz=7.477, verifying a tentative detection presented in an earlier study. The\nubiquity of Lyman-alpha in this sample is puzzling given that the IGM is likely\nsignificantly neutral over 7<z<9. To investigate this result in more detail, we\nhave initiated a campaign to target UV metal emission in the four Lyman-alpha\nemitters as a probe of both the radiation field and the velocity offset of\nLyman-alpha. Here we present the detection of intense CIII] emission in\nEGS-zs8-1, a galaxy from this sample previously shown to have Lyman-alpha at\nz=7.73. Photoionization models indicate that an intense radiation field and low\nmetallicity are required to reproduce the intense CIII] and optical line\nemission. We argue that this extreme radiation field is likely to affect the\nlocal environment, increasing the transmission of Lyman-alpha through the\ngalaxy. Moreover, the centroid of CIII] indicates that Lyman-alpha is\nredshifted from the systemic value by 340 km/s. This velocity offset is larger\nthan that seen in less luminous systems, providing an additional explanation\nfor the transmission of Lyman-alpha emission through the IGM. Since the\ntransmission is further enhanced by the likelihood that such systems are also\nsituated in the densest regions with the largest ionized bubbles, the\nvisibility of Lyman-alpha at z>7 is expected to be strongly\nluminosity-dependent, with the most effective transmission occurring in systems\nwith intense star formation.\n", "  We calculate the cross section of diffractive dijet photoproduction in $ep$\nscattering at next-to-leading order (NLO) of perturbative QCD (pQCD), which we\nsupplement by a model of factorization breaking for the resolved-photon\ncontribution. In this model, the suppression depends on the flavor and momentum\nfraction of the partons in the photon. We show that within experimental and\ntheoretical uncertainties, the resulting approach provides a good description\nof the available HERA data in most of the bins. Hence, taken together with the\nobservation that NLO pQCD explains well the data on diffractive photoproduction\nof open charm in $ep$ scattering, our model of factorization breaking presents\na viable alternative to the scheme based on the global suppression factor.\n", "  The HL-LHC phase is designed to increase by an order of magnitude the amount\nof data to be collected by the LHC experiments. To achieve this goal in a\nreasonable time scale the instantaneous luminosity would also increase by an\norder of magnitude up to $6.10^{34} cm^{-2} s^{-1}$ . The region of the forward\nmuon spectrometer ($|{\\eta}| > 1.6$) is not equipped with RPC stations. The\nincrease of the expected particles rate up to $2 kHz/cm^{2}$ (including a\nsafety factor 3) motivates the installation of RPC chambers to guarantee\nredundancy with the CSC chambers already present. The actual RPC technology of\nCMS cannot sustain the expected background level. The new technology that will\nbe chosen should have a high rate capability and provides a good spatial and\ntiming resolution. A new generation of Glass-RPC (GRPC) using low-resistivity\n(LR) glass is proposed to equip at least the two most far away of the four high\n${\\eta}$ muon stations of CMS. First the design of small size prototypes and\nstudies of their performance in high-rate particles flux is presented. Then the\nproposed designs for large size chambers and their fast-timing electronic\nreadout are examined and preliminary results are provided.\n", "  Manipulation of radiation is required for enabling a span of electromagnetic\napplications. Since properties of antennas and scatterers are very sensitive to\na surrounding environment, macroscopic artificially created materials are good\ncandidates for shaping their characteristics. In particular, metamaterials\nenable controlling both dispersion and density of electromagnetic states,\navailable for scattering from an object. As the result, properly designed\nelectromagnetic environment could govern waves' phenomena. Here electromagnetic\nproperties of scattering dipoles, situated inside a wire medium (metamaterial)\nare analyzed both numerically and experimentally. Impact of the metamaterial\ngeometry, dipole arrangement inside the medium, and frequency of the incident\nradiation on scattering phenomena was studied. It was shown that the resonance\nof the dipole hybridizes with Fabry-Perot modes of the metamaterial, giving\nrise to a complete reshaping of electromagnetic properties. Regimes of\ncontrolled scattering suppression and super-scattering were observed. Numerical\nanalysis is in an agreement with experiments, performed at the GHz spectral\nrange. The reported approach to scattering control with metamaterials could be\ndirectly mapped into optical and infrared spectral ranges by employing\nscalability properties of Maxwell's equations.\n", "  The single-photon avalanche photodiode(SPAD) has been widely used in research\non quantum optics. The afterpulsing effect, which is an intrinsic character of\nSPAD, affects the system performance in most experiments and needs to be\ncarefully handled. For a long time, afterpulsing has been presumed to be\ndetermined by the pre-ignition avalanche. We studied the afterpulsing effect of\na commercial InGaAs/InP SPAD (The avalanche photodiode model is: Princeton\nLightwave PGA-300) and demonstrated that its afterpulsing is non-Markovian,\nwith a memory effect in the avalanching history. Theoretical analysis and\nexperimental results clearly indicate that the embodiment of this memory effect\nis the afterpulsing probability, which increases as the number of\nignition-avalanche pulses increase. This conclusion makes the principle of the\nafterpulsing effect clearer and is instructive to the manufacturing processes\nand afterpulsing evaluation of high-count-rate SPADs. It can also be regarded\nas a fundamental premise to handle the afterpulsing signals in many\napplications, such as quantum communication and quantum random number\ngeneration.\n", "  We present the first dedicated radio continuum survey of a Kepler K2 mission\nfield, Field 1 covering the North Galactic Cap. The survey is wide field,\ncontemporaneous, multi-epoch, and multi-resolution in nature and was conducted\nat low radio frequencies between 140 and 200 MHz. The multi-epoch and ultra\nwide field (but relatively low resolution) part of the survey was provided by\n15 nights of observation with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) over a period\nof approximately a month, contemporaneous with K2 observations of the field.\nThe multi-resolution aspect of the survey was provided by the low resolution\n(4') MWA imaging, complemented by non-contemporaneous but much higher\nresolution (20\") observations using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT).\nThe survey is therefore sensitive to the details of radio structures across a\nwide range of angular scales. Consistent with other recent low radio frequency\nsurveys, no significant radio transients or variables were detected in the\nsurvey. The resulting source catalogs consist of 1,085 and 1,468 detections in\nthe two MWA observation bands (centered at 154 and 185 MHz, respectively) and\n7,445 detections in the GMRT observation band (centered at 148 MHz), over 314\nsquare degrees. The survey is presented as a significant resource for\nmulti-wavelength investigations of the more than 21,000 target objects in the\nK2 field. We briefly examine our survey data against K2 target lists for dwarf\nstar types (stellar types M and L) that have been known to produce radio\nflares.\n", "  The concept of weak invariant is introduced. Then, the weak invariants\nassociated with time-dependent quantum dissipative systems are discussed in the\ncontext of master equations of the Lindblad type. In particular, with the help\nof the su(1,1) Lie-algebraic structure, the weak invariant is explicitly\nconstructed for the quantum damped harmonic oscillator with the time-dependent\nfrequency and friction coefficient. This generalizes the Lewis-Riesenfeld\ninvariant to the case of nonunitary dynamics in the Markovian approximation.\n", "  This work deals with right handed sneutrino as thermal cold dark matter\ncandidate. This scalar emerges in a supersymmetric version of $SU(3)_c \\otimes\nSU(3)_L \\otimes U(1)_X$ gauge model where right handed neutrinos are a natural\ncomponent of leptonic chiral scalar supermultiplets. We first consider the\nissue of a $125$~GeV Higgs boson mass in this model, showing that constraints\non stop mass and trilinear soft coupling are considerably alleviated compared\nto MSSM. Then we investigate the region of parameter space that is consistent\nwith right handed sneutrino as thermal cold dark matter, under the light of\nPlanck results on the relic abundance and direct detection from LUX experiment.\nThis sneutrino mainly annihilates through an extra neutral gauge boson,\n$Z^\\prime$, and Higgs exchange, so that the physics of dark matter is somewhat\nrelated to the parameters determining Higgs and $Z^\\prime$ masses. We then\nobtain that right handed sneutrino in this model must be heavier than $400$~GeV\nto conform with Planck and LUX, simultaneously constraining the $Z^\\prime$ mass\nto be above 2400~GeV, which is in perfect agreement with LHC searches in a\nnon-supersymmetric version of this model.\n", "  We explore the band structure and ballistic electron transport in twisted\nbilayer $\\textrm{MoS}_2$ using Density Functional Theory (DFT). The sphagetti\nlike bands are unfolded to generate band structures in the primitive unit cell\nof the original un-twisted $\\textrm{MoS}_2$ bilayer and projected onto an\nindividual layer. The corresponding twist angle dependent indirect bandedges\nare extracted from the unfolded band structures. Based on a comparison within\nthe same primitive unit cell, an efficient two band effective mass model for\nindirect conduction and valence valleys is created and parameterized by fitting\nthe unfolded band structures. With the two band effective mass model, transport\nproperties - specifically, we calculate the ballistic transmission in\narbitrarily twisted bilayer $\\textrm{MoS}_2$.\n", "  I review the advancements of atomic scale nanoelectronics towards quantum\nneuromorphics. First, I summarize the key properties of elementary combinations\nof few neurons, namely long-- and short--term plasticity, spike-timing\ndependent plasticity (associative plasticity), quantumness and stochastic\neffects, and their potential computational employment. Next, I review several\natomic scale device technologies developed to control electron transport at the\natomic level, including single atom implantation for atomic arrays and CMOS\nquantum dots, single atom memories, Ag$_2$S and Cu$_2$S atomic switches,\nhafnium based RRAMs, organic material based transistors, Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$\nsynapses. Each material/method proved successful in achieving some of the\nproperties observed in real neurons. I compare the different methods towards\nthe creation of a new generation of naturally inspired and biophysically\nmeaningful artificial neurons, in order to replace the rigid CMOS based\nneuromorphic hardware. The most challenging aspect to address appears to obtain\nboth the stochastic/quantum behavior and the associative plasticity, which are\ncurrently observed only below and above 20 nm length scale respectively, by\nemploying the same material.\n", "  In this paper we wish to find the corresponding Gibbons-Hawking-York term for\nthe most general quadratic in curvature gravity by using Coframe slicing within\nthe Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) decomposition of spacetime in four dimensions.\nIn order to make sure that the higher derivative gravity is ghost and tachyon\nfree at a perturbative level, one requires infinite covariant derivatives,\nwhich yields a generalised covariant infinite derivative theory of gravity. We\nwill be exploring the boundary term for such a covariant infinite derivative\ntheory of gravity.\n", "  The Mori's projection method, known as memory function method is an important\ntheoretical formalism to study various transport coefficients. In the present\nwork, we calculate the dynamical thermal conductivity in the case of metals\nusing the memory function formalism. We introduce thermal memory functions for\nthe first time and discuss the behavior of thermal conductivity in both zero\nfrequency limit and in the case of non-zero frequencies. We compare our results\nfor the zero frequency case with the results obtained by the Bloch-Boltzmann\nkinetic approach and find that both approaches agree with each other. Motivated\nby some recent experimental advancements, we obtain several new results for the\nac or the dynamical thermal conductivity.\n", "  There exist four pion nucleon coupling constants, $f_{\\pi^0, pp}$,\n$-f_{\\pi^0, nn}$, $f_{\\pi^+, pn} /\\sqrt{2}$ and $ f_{\\pi^-, np} /\\sqrt{2}$\nwhich coincide when up and down quark masses are identical and the electron\ncharge is zero. While there is no reason why the pion-nucleon-nucleon coupling\nconstants should be identical in the real world, one expects that the small\ndifferences might be pinned down from a sufficiently large number of\nindependent and mutually consistent data. Our discussion provides a rationale\nfor our recent determination $$f_p^2 = 0.0759(4) \\, , \\quad f_{0}^2 = 0.079(1)\n\\,, \\quad f_{c}^2 = 0.0763(6) \\, , $$ based on a partial wave analysis of the\n$3\\sigma$ self-consistent nucleon-nucleon Granada-2013 database comprising 6713\npublished data in the period 1950-2013.\n", "  We express the planar five- and six-gluon two-loop Yang-Mills amplitudes with\nall positive helicities in compact analytic form using D-dimensional local\nintegrands that are free of spurious singularities. The integrand is fixed from\non-shell tree amplitudes in six dimensions using D-dimensional generalised\nunitarity cuts. The resulting expressions are shown to have manifest infrared\nbehaviour at the integrand level. We also find simple representations of the\nrational terms obtained after integration in 4-2epsilon dimensions.\n", "  The direct photon spectrum is computed to the highest currently available\nprecision and compared to ATLAS data from 8 TeV collisions at the LHC. The\nprediction includes threshold resummation at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading\nlogarithmic order through the program PeTeR, matched to next-to-leading fixed\norder with fragmentation effects using JetPhox and includes the resummation of\nleading-logarithmic electroweak Sudakov effects. Remarkably, improved agreement\nwith data can be seen when each component of the calculation is added\nsuccessively. This comparison demonstrates the importance of both threshold\nlogs and electroweak Sudakov effects. Numerical values for the predictions are\nincluded.\n", "  We show how to correctly treat threshold singularities in fixed-order\nperturbative calculations of the electron anomalous magnetic moment and\nhadronic pair production processes such as top pair production. With respect to\nthe former, we demonstrate the equivalence of the \"non-perturbative\", resummed\ntreatment of the vacuum polarization contribution, whose spectral function\nexhibits bound state poles, with the fixed-order calculation by identifying a\nthreshold localized term in the four-loop spectral function. In general, we\nfind that a modification of the dispersion relation by threshold subtractions\nis required to make fixed-order calculations well-defined and provide the\nsubtraction term. We then solve the apparent problem of a divergent convolution\nof the partonic cross section with the parton luminosity in the computation of\nthe top pair production cross section starting from the fourth-order\ncorrection. We find that when the computation is performed in the usual way as\nan integral of real and virtual corrections over phase space at a given order\nin the expansion in the strong coupling, an additional contribution has to be\nadded at N3LO.\n", "  In this work we investigate some features of the fermionic sector of the\nsupersymmetric version of the baby Skyrme model. We find that, in the\nbackground of BPS compact Skyrmions, fermionic zero modes are confined to the\ndefect core. Further, we show that, while three SUSY generators are broken in\nthe defect core, SUSY is completely restored outside. We study also the effect\nof a D-term deformation of the model. Such a deformation allows for the\nexistence of fermionic zero modes and broken SUSY outside the compact defect.\n", "  GJ3470b is a hot Neptune exoplanet orbiting an M dwarf and the first\nsub-Jovian planet to exhibit Rayleigh scattering. We present transit timing\nvariation (TTV) and transmission spectroscopy analyses of multi-wavelength\noptical photometry from 2.4-m and 0.5-m telescopes at the Thai National\nObservatory, and the 0.6-m PROMPT-8 telescope in Chile. Our TTV analysis allows\nus to place an upper mass limit for a second planet in the system. The presence\nof a hot Jupiter with a period of less than 10 days or a planet with an orbital\nperiod between 2.5 and 4.0 days are excluded. Combined optical and\nnear-infrared transmission spectroscopy favour an H/He dominated haze (mean\nmolecular weight 1.08$\\pm$0.20) with high particle abundance at high altitude.\nWe also argue that previous near-infrared data favour the presence of methane\nin the atmosphere of GJ3470b.\n", "  In this paper, we revisit a scale-invariant extension of the standard model\n(SM) with a strongly interacting hidden sector within AdS/QCD approach. Using\nthe AdS/QCD, we reduce the number of input parameters to three, {\\it i.e.}\nhidden pion decay constant, hidden pion mass and $\\tan\\beta$ that is defined as\nthe ratio of the vacuum expectation values (VEV) of the singlet scalar field\nand the SM Higgs boson. As a result, our model has sharp predictability. We\nperform the phenomenological analysis of the hidden pions which is one of the\ndark matter (DM) candidates in this model. With various theoretical and\nexperimental constraints we search for the allowed parameter space and find\nthat both resonance and non-resonance solutions are possible. Some typical\ncorrelations among various observables such as thermal relic density of hidden\npions, Higgs boson signal strengths and DM-nucleon cross section are\ninvestigated. We provide some benchmark points for experimental tests.\n", "  The past two decades have seen a significant advancement in the detection,\nclassification and understanding of exoplanets and binaries. This is due, in\nlarge part, to the increase in use of small-aperture telescopes (< 20 cm) to\nsurvey large areas of the sky to milli-mag precision with rapid cadence. The\nvast majority of the planetary and binary systems studied to date consist of\nmain-sequence or evolved objects, leading to a dearth of knowledge of\nproperties at early times (< 50 Myr). Only a dozen binaries and one candidate\ntransiting Hot Jupiter are known among pre-main sequence objects, yet these are\nthe systems that can provide the best constraints on stellar formation and\nplanetary migration models. The deficiency in the number of well-characterized\nsystems is driven by the inherent and aperiodic variability found in\npre-main-sequence objects, which can mask and mimic eclipse signals. Hence, a\ndramatic increase in the number of young systems with high-quality observations\nis highly desirable to guide further theoretical developments. We have recently\ncompleted a photometric survey of 3 nearby (< 150 pc) and young (< 50 Myr)\nmoving groups with a small aperture telescope. While our survey reached the\nrequisite photometric precision, the temporal coverage was insufficient to\ndetect Hot Jupiters. Nevertheless, we discovered 346 pre-main-sequence binary\ncandidates, including 74 high-priority objects for further study.\n", "  Recently it has been proposed that the zombie vortex instability (ZVI) could\nprecipitate hydrodynamical activity and angular momentum transport in\nunmagnetised regions of protoplanetary discs, also known as \"dead zones\". In\nthis letter we scrutinise, with high resolution 3D spectral simulations, the\nonset and survival of this instability in the presence of viscous and thermal\nphysics. First, we find that the ZVI is strongly dependent on the nature of the\nviscous operator. Although the ZVI is easily obtained with hyper-diffusion, it\nis difficult to sustain with physical (second order) diffusion operators up to\nReynolds numbers as high as 10^7. This sensitivity is probably due to the ZVI's\nreliance on critical layers, whose characteristic lengthscale, structure, and\ndynamics are controlled by viscous diffusion. Second, we observe that the ZVI\nis sensitive to radiative processes, and indeed only operates when the Peclet\nnumber is greater than a critical value ~10^4, or when the cooling time is\nlonger than ~10 Omega^{-1}. As a consequence, the ZVI struggles to appear at\nR>0.3 AU in standard 0.01 M_sun T Tauri disc models, though younger more\nmassive disks provide a more hospitable environment. Together these results\nquestion the prevalence of the ZVI in protoplanetary discs.\n", "  The flow equation method was proposed by Wegner as a technique for studying\ninteracting systems in one dimension. Here, we apply this method to a\ndisordered one dimensional model with power-law decaying hoppings. This model\npresents a transition as function of the decaying exponent $\\alpha$. We derive\nthe flow equations, and the evolution of single-particle operators. The flow\nequation reveals the delocalized nature of the states for $\\alpha<1/2$.\nAdditionally, in the regime, $\\alpha>1/2$, we present a strong-bond\nrenormalization group structure based on iterating the three-site clusters,\nwhere we solve the flow equations perturbatively. This renormalization group\napproach allows us to probe the critical point $\\left(\\alpha=1\\right)$. This\nmethod correctly reproduces the critical level-spacing statistics, and the\nfractal dimensionality of the eigenfunctions.\n", "  We study the LHC phenomenology of the next-to-minimal model of gauge-mediated\nsupersymmetry breaking (NMGMSB), both for Run I and Run II. The Higgs\nphenomenology of the model is consistent with observations: a 125 GeV Standard\nModel-like Higgs which mixes with singlet-like state of mass around 90 GeV that\nprovides a 2$\\sigma$ excess at LEP II. The model possesses regions of parameter\nspace where a longer-lived lightest neutralino decays in the detector into a\ngravitino and a $b-$jet pair or a tau pair. We investigate current lower bounds\non sparticle masses and the discovery potential of the model, both via\nconventional sparticle searches and via searches for displaced vertices. The\nstrongest bound from searches for promptly decaying sparticles yields a lower\nlimit on the gluino mass of 1080 GeV. An analysis of 100 fb$^{-1}$ from Run II,\non the other hand, is expected to be sensitive up to 1900 GeV. The displaced\nvertex searches from Run I suffer from a very low signal efficiency, mainly due\nto the presence of $b-$quarks in the final state. We show how the displaced\nvertex cuts might be relaxed in order to improve signal efficiency, while\nsimultaneous prompt objects can be used to cut down background. We find that a\ncombined search strategy with both prompt and displaced cuts potentially has a\nfar better sensitivity to this model than either set alone, motivating a fully\nfledged experimental study.\n", "  For a test particle approaching a rapidly rotating black hole we find a range\nof values of the particle's energy and angular momentum, on the order of 1\\% or\nmore of the corresponding values of the hole, such that three conditions are\nsatisfied. 1) The particle can reach the horizon. 2) After absorption the new\nhole still has a horizon. 3) The area of the new hole is less than the area of\nthe original one, in apparent violation of a theorem of Hawking. We offer\nsupport for the claim that the test particle approximation is the cause of the\nviolation.\n", "  The structural and magnetic properties of spinel compounds $CoB_2O_4$\n(B=Cr,Mn and Fe) are studied using the DFT+U method and generalized gradient\napproximation (GGA). We concentrate on understanding the trends in the\nproperties of these materials as the B cation changes, in terms of relative\nstrengths of crystal fields and exchange fields through an analysis of their\nelectronic densities of states. We find that the electron-electron correlation\nplays a significant role in obtaining the correct structural and electronic\nground states. Significant structural distortion in CoMn$_{2}$O$_{4}$ and\n\"inverted\" sublattice occupancy in CoFe$_{2}$O$_{4}$ affects the magnetic\nexchange interactions substantially. The trends in the magnetic exchange\ninteractions are analysed in terms of the structural parameters and the\nfeatures in their electronic structures. We find that the Fe states in\nCoFe$_{2}$O$_{4}$ are extremely localised, irrespective of the symmetry of the\nsite, which makes it very different from the features of the states of the B\ncations in other two compounds. These results provide useful insights into the\ntrends in the properties of CoB$_{2}$O$_{4}$ compounds with variation of B\ncation which would help in understanding the results of recent experiments on\ndoping of Mn and Cr in multiferroic CoCr$_{2}$O$_{4}$.\n", "  The high-energy evolution of Wilson line operators, which at leading order is\ndescribed by the Balitsky-JIMWLK equations, receives large radiative\ncorrections enhanced by single and double collinear logarithms at\nnext-to-leading order and beyond. We propose a method for resumming such\nlogarithmic corrections to all orders, at the level of the Langevin formulation\nof the JIMWLK equation. The ensuing, collinearly-improved Langevin equation\nfeatures generalized Wilson line operators, which depend not only upon rapidity\n(the logarithm of the longitudinal momentum), but also upon the transverse size\nof the color neutral projectile to which the Wilson lines belong. This\nadditional scale dependence is built up during the evolution, via the condition\nthat the successive emissions of soft gluons be ordered in time. The presence\nof this transverse scale in the Langevin equation furthermore allows for the\nresummation of the one-loop running coupling corrections.\n", "  We study microscopic processes responsible for chirality flips in the thermal\nbath of Quantum Chromodynamics at finite temperature and zero baryon chemical\npotential. We focus on the temperature range where the crossover from chirally\nbroken phase to quark-gluon plasma takes place, namely $T \\simeq (150, 200)$\nMeV. The processes we consider are quark-quark scatterings mediated by\ncollective excitations with the quantum number of pions and $\\sigma$-meson,\nhence we refer to these processes simply as \\sugg{to} one-pion (one-$\\sigma$)\nexchange\\sugg{s}. We use a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model to compute equilibrium\nproperties of the thermal bath, as well as the relevant scattering kernel to be\nused in the collision integral to estimate the chiral relaxation time $\\tau$.\nWe find $\\tau\\simeq 0.1 \\div 1$ fm/c around the chiral crossover.\n", "  The optical modes of photonic structures are the so-called TE and TM modes\nwhich bring intrinsic spin-orbit coupling and chirality to these systems. This,\ncombined with the unique flexibility of design of the photonic potential, and\nthe possibility to mix photon states with excitonic resonances, sensitive to\nmagnetic field and interactions, allows to achieve many phenomena, often\nanalogous to other solid state systems. In this contribution, we review in a\nqualitative and comprehensive way several of these realizations, namely the\noptical spin Hall effect, the creation of spin currents protected by a\nnon-trivial geometry, Berry curvature for photons, and the photonic/polaritonic\ntopological insulator.\n", "  Donor electron spins in semiconductors make exceptional quantum bits because\nof their long coherence times and compatibility with industrial fabrication\ntechniques. Despite many advances in donor-based qubit technology, it remains\ndifficult to selectively manipulate single donor electron spins. Here, we show\nthat by replacing the prevailing semiconductor host material (silicon) with\ngermanium, donor electron spin qubits can be electrically tuned by more than an\nensemble linewidth, making them compatible with gate addressable quantum\ncomputing architectures. Using X-band pulsed electron spin resonance, we\nmeasured the Stark effect for donor electron spins in germanium. We resolved\nboth spin-orbit and hyperfine Stark shifts and found that at 0.4 T, the\nspin-orbit Stark shift dominates. The spin-orbit Stark shift is highly\nanisotropic, depending on the electric field orientation relative to the\ncrystal axes and external magnetic field. When the Stark shift is maximized,\nthe spin-orbit Stark parameter is four orders of magnitude larger than in\nsilicon. At select orientations a hyperfine Stark effect was also resolved and\nis an order of magnitude larger than in silicon. We report the Stark parameters\nfor $^{75}$As and $^{31}$P donor electrons and compare them to the available\ntheory. Our data reveal that $^{31}$P donors in germanium can be tuned by at\nleast four times the ensemble linewidth making germanium an appealing new host\nmaterial for spin qubits that offers major advantages over silicon.\n", "  We address a problem of Casimir apparatus in dense medium and weak\ngravitational field. The falling of the apparatus has to be governed by the\nequivalence principle, with proper account for contributions to the weight of\nthe apparatus from its material part and from distorted quantum fields. We\ndiscuss general expression for the corresponding force in metric with\ncylindrical symmetry. By way of example we compute explicit expression for\nArchimedes force, acting on the Casimir apparatus of finite size, immersed into\nthermal bath of free scalar field. It is shown that besides universal term,\nproportional to the volume of the apparatus, there are non-universal quantum\ncorrections, depending on the boundary conditions.\n", "  We derive analytical expressions for the coherence in the onset of modulation\ninstability, in excellent agreement with thorough numerical simulations. As\nusual, we start by a linear perturbation analysis, where broadband noise is\nadded to a continuous wave (CW) pump; then, we investigate the effect of adding\na deterministic seed to the CW pump, a case of singular interest as it is\ncommonly encountered in parametric amplification schemes. Results for the\ndependence of coherence on parameters such as fiber type, pump power,\npropagated distance, seed signal-to-noise ratio are presented. Finally, we show\nthe importance of including higher-order linear and nonlinear dispersion when\ndealing with generation in longer wavelength regions (mid IR). We believe these\nresults to be of relevance when applied to the analysis of the coherence\nproperties of supercontinua generated from CW pumps.\n", "  The dead cone is a well-known effect in gauge theories, where radiation from\na charged particle of mass m and energy E is suppressed within an angular size\nof m/E. This effect is universal as it does not depend on the spin of the\nparticle nor on the nature of the gauge interaction. It is challenging to\ndirectly measure the dead cone at colliders, however, since the region of\nsuppressed radiation either is too small to be resolved or is filled by the\ndecay products of the massive particle. In this paper, we propose to use jet\nsubstructure techniques to expose the dead cone effect in the strong-force\nradiation pattern around boosted top quarks at the Large Hadron Collider. Our\nstudy shows that with 300/fb of 13-14 TeV collision data, ATLAS and CMS could\nobtain the first direct evidence of the dead cone effect and test its basic\nfeatures.\n", "  We use a large sample of galaxies at z~3 to establish a relationship between\nreddening, neutral gas covering fraction (fcov(HI)), and the escape of ionizing\nphotons at high redshift. Our sample includes 933 galaxies at z~3, 121 of which\nhave very deep spectroscopic observations (>7 hrs) in the rest-UV\n(lambda=850-1300 A) with Keck/LRIS. Based on the high covering fraction of\noutflowing optically-thick HI indicated by the composite spectra of these\ngalaxies, we conclude that photoelectric absorption, rather than dust\nattenuation, dominates the depletion of ionizing photons. By modeling the\ncomposite spectra as the combination of an unattenuated stellar spectrum\nincluding nebular continuum emission with one that is absorbed by HI and\nreddened by a line-of-sight extinction, we derive an empirical relationship\nbetween E(B-V) and fcov(HI). Galaxies with redder UV continua have larger\ncovering fractions of HI characterized by higher line-of-sight extinctions. Our\nresults are consistent with the escape of Lya through gas-free lines-of-sight.\nCovering fractions based on low-ionization interstellar absorption lines\nsystematically underpredict those deduced from the HI lines, suggesting that\nmuch of the outflowing gas may be metal-poor. We develop a model which connects\nthe ionizing escape fraction with E(B-V), and which may be used to estimate the\nescape fraction for an ensemble of high-redshift galaxies. Alternatively,\ndirect measurements of the escape fraction for our data allow us to constrain\nthe intrinsic 900-to-1500 A flux density ratio to be >0.20, a value that favors\nstellar population models that include weaker stellar winds, a flatter initial\nmass function, and/or binary evolution. Lastly, we demonstrate how the\nframework discussed here may be used to assess the pathways by which ionizing\nradiation escapes from high-redshift galaxies. [Abridged]\n", "  In the past few years, the number of confirmed planets has grown above 2000.\nIt is clear that they represent a diversity of structures not seen in our own\nsolar system. In addition to very detailed interior modeling, it is valuable to\nhave a simple analytical framework for describing planetary structures.\nVariational principle is a fundamental principle in physics, entailing that a\nphysical system follows the trajectory which minimizes its action. It is\nalternative to the differential equation formulation of a physical system.\nApplying this principle to planetary interior can beautifully summarize the set\nof differential equations into one, which provides us some insight into the\nproblem. From it, a universal mass-radius relation, an estimate of error\npropagation from equation of state to mass-radius relation, and a form of\nvirial theorem applicable to planetary interiors are derived.\n", "  We consider a RG flow in a general su(2) coset model induced by the least\nrelevant field. This is done using two different approaches. We first compute\nthe mixing coefficients of certain fields in the UV and IR theories using a\nconformal perturbation theory. The necessary structure constants are computed.\nThe same coefficients can be calculated using the RG domain wall construction\nof Gaiotto. We compute the corresponding one-point functions and show that the\ntwo approaches give the same result in the leading order.\n", "  We extend the Loop Quantum Cosmology matter bounce scenario in order to\ninclude a dark energy era, which ends abruptly at a Rip singularity where the\nscale factor and the Hubble rate diverge. In the \"deformed matter bounce\nscenario\", the Universe is contracting from an initial non-causal matter\ndominated era until it reaches a minimal radius. After that it expands in a\ndecelerating way, until at late times, where it expands in an accelerating way,\nthus the model is described by a dark energy era that follows the matter\ndominated era. Depending on the choice of the free parameters of the model, the\ndark energy era is quintessential like which follows the matter domination era,\nand eventually it crosses the phantom divide line and becomes phantom. At the\nend of the dark energy era, a Rip singularity exists, where the scale factor\nand Hubble rate diverge, however the physical system cannot reach the\nsingularity, since the effective energy density and pressure become complex.\nThis indicates two things, firstly that the ordinary Loop Quantum Cosmology\nmatter bounce evolution stops, thus ending the infinite repetition of the\nordinary matter bounce scenario. Secondly, the fact that both the pressure and\nthe density become complex indicates probably that the description of the\ncosmic evolution within the theoretical context of Loop Quantum Cosmology,\nceases to describe the physics of the system and possibly a more fundamental\ntheory of quantum gravity is needed near the would be Rip singularity. We\ndescribe the qualitative features of the model and we also investigate how this\ncosmology could be realized by a viscous fluid and scalar field in the context\nof LQC.\n", "  We report optical characterization of PtSi films for thermoelectric device\napplications by nondestructive spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE). Pt monolayer\nand Pt-Si multilayer which consists of 3 pairs of Pt and Si layers were\ndeposited on p-doped-silicon substrates by sputtering method and then rapid\nannealing process was done to form PtSi films through intermixing of Pt and Si\natoms at the interface. Pseudodielectric function data <{\\epsilon}> =\n<{\\epsilon}1> + i<{\\epsilon}2> of the PtSi/Si samples were obtained from 1.12\nto 6.52 eV by using spectroscopic ellipsometry. Employing Tauc-Lorentz and\nDrude models, the dielectric function ({\\epsilon}) of PtSi films were\ndetermined. We found that the composition ratio of Pt:Si is nearly 1:1 for PtSi\nmonolayer and we observed transitions between occupied and unoccupied states in\nPt 5d states. We also observed formation of PtSi layers in Pt-Si multilayer\nsample. The SE results were confirmed by the transmission electron microscopy\nand energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy.\n", "  We theoretically address grazing incidence fast atom diffraction (GIFAD) for\nH atoms impinging on a LiF(001) surface. Our model combines a description of\nthe H-LiF(001) interaction obtained from Density Functional Theory calculations\nwith a semi-quantum treatment of the dynamics. We analyze simulated diffraction\npatterns in terms of the incidence channel, the impact energy associated with\nthe motion normal to the surface, and the relevance of Van der Waals (VdW)\ninteractions. We then contrast our simulations with experimental patterns for\ndifferent incidence conditions. Our most important finding is that, for normal\nenergies lower than 0.5 eV and incidence along the <100> channel, the inclusion\nof Van der Waals interactions in our potential energy surface yields a greatly\nimproved accord between simulations and experiments. This agreement strongly\nsuggests a non-negligible role of Van der Waals interactions in H/LiF(001)\nGIFAD in the low-to-intermediate normal energy regime.\n", "  Context. ALMA observations of the high-mass star-forming region G35.20-0.74N\nhave revealed the presence of a Keplerian disk in core B rotating about a\nmassive object of 18 Msun, as computed from the velocity field. The luminosity\nof such a massive star would be comparable to (or higher than) the luminosity\nof the whole star-forming region. To solve this problem it has been proposed\nthat core B could harbor a binary system. This could also explain the possible\nprecession of the radio jet associated with this core, which has been suggested\nby its S-shaped morphology. Aims. To establish the origin of the free-free\nemission from core B and investigate the existence of a binary system at the\ncenter of this massive core and the possible precession of the radio jet.\nMethods. We carried out VLA continuum observations of G35.20-0.74N at 2 cm in\nthe B configuration and at 1.3 cm and 7 mm in the A and B configurations. The\nbandwidth at 7 mm covers the CH3OH maser line at 44.069 GHz. Continuum images\nat 6 and 3.6 cm in the A configuration were obtained from the VLA archive. We\nalso carried out VERA observations of the H2O maser line at 22.235 GHz.\nResults. The observations have revealed the presence of a binary system of\nUC/HC HII regions at the geometrical center of the radio jet in G35.20-0.74N.\nThis binary system, which is associated with a Keplerian rotating disk,\nconsists of two B-type stars of 11 and 6 Msun. The S-shaped morphology of the\nradio jet has been successfully explained as due to precession produced by the\nbinary system. The analysis of the precession of the radio jet has allowed us\nto better interpret the IR emission in the region, which would be not tracing a\nwide-angle cavity open by a single outflow with a position angle of ~55 deg but\ntwo different flows: a precessing one in the NE-SW direction associated with\nthe radio jet, and a second one in an almost E--W direction ...\n", "  In a fusion reactor internally coated with liquid metal, it will be important\nto diagnose the thickness of the liquid at various locations in the vessel, as\na function of time, and possibly respond to counteract undesired bulging or\ndepletion. The electrical conductance between electrodes immersed in the liquid\nmetal can be used as a simple proxy for the local thickness. Here a matrix of\nelectrodes is shown to provide spatially resolved measurements of liquid metal\nthickness in the absence of plasma. First a theory is developed for mxn\nelectrodes, and then it is experimentally demonstrated for 3x1 electrodes. The\nexperiments were carried out with Galinstan, but are easily extended to Lithium\nor other liquid metals.\n", "  The perceived randomness in the time evolution of \"chaotic\" dynamical systems\ncan be characterized by universal probabilistic limit laws, which do not depend\non the fine features of the individual system. One important example is the\nPoisson law for the times at which a particle with random initial data hits a\nsmall set. This was proved in various settings for dynamical systems with\nstrong mixing properties. The key result of the present study is that, despite\nthe absence of mixing, the hitting times of integrable flows also satisfy\nuniversal limit laws which are, however, not Poisson. We describe the limit\ndistributions for \"generic\" integrable flows and a natural class of target\nsets, and illustrate our findings with two examples: the dynamics in central\nforce fields and ellipse billiards. The convergence of the hitting time process\nfollows from a new equidistribution theorem in the space of lattices, which is\nof independent interest. Its proof exploits Ratner's measure classification\ntheorem for unipotent flows, and extends earlier work of Elkies and McMullen.\n", "  The core accretion model for giant planet formation suggests a two layer\npicture for the initial structure of Jovian planets, with heavy elements in a\ndense core and a thick H-He envelope. Late planetesimal accretion and core\nerosion could potentially enrich the H-He envelope in heavy elements, which is\nsupported by the three-fold solar metallicity that was measured in Jupiter's\natmosphere by the Galileo entry probe. In order to reproduce the observed\ngravitational moments of Jupiter and Saturn, models for their interiors include\nheavy elements, $Z$, in various proportions. However, their effect on the\nequation of state of the hydrogen-helium mixtures has not been investigated\nbeyond the ideal mixing approximation. In this article, we report results from\n\\textit{ab initio} simulations of fully interacting H-He-$Z$ mixtures in order\nto characterize their equation of state and to analyze possible consequences\nfor the interior structure and evolution of giant planets. Considering C, N, O,\nSi, Fe, MgO and SiO$_2$, we show that the behavior of heavy elements in H-He\nmixtures may still be represented by an ideal mixture if the effective volumes\nand internal energies are chosen appropriately. In the case of oxygen, we also\ncompute the effect on the entropy. We find the resulting changes in the\ntemperature-pressure profile to be small. A homogeneous distribution of 2\\%\noxygen by mass changes the temperature in Jupiter's interior by only 80 K.\n", "  An innovative millimeter wave diagnostic is proposed to measure the local\nmagnetic field and edge current as a function of the minor radius in the\ntokamak pedestal region. The idea is to identify the direction of minimum\nreflectivity at the O-mode cutoff layer. Correspondingly, the transmissivity\ndue to O-X mode conversion is maximum. That direction, and the angular map of\nreflectivity around it, contain information on the magnetic field vector B at\nthe cutoff layer. Probing the plasma with different wave frequencies provides\nthe radial profile of B. Full-wave finite-element simulations are presented\nhere in 2D slab geometry. Modeling confirms the existence of a minimum in\nreflectivity that depends on the magnetic field at the cutoff, as expected from\nmode conversion physics, giving confidence in the feasibility of the\ndiagnostic. The proposed reflectometric approach is expected to yield superior\nsignal-to-noise ratio and to access wider ranges of density and magnetic field,\ncompared with related radiometric techniques that require the plasma to emit\nElectron Bernstein Waves. Due to computational limitations, frequencies of\n10-20 GHz were considered in this initial study. Frequencies above the edge\nelectron-cyclotron frequency (f>28 GHz here) would be preferable for the\nexperiment, because the upper hybrid resonance and right cutoff would lie in\nthe plasma, and would help separate the O-mode of interest from spurious\nX-waves.\n", "  In any neutron scattering experiment the measurement of the position of the\nscattered neutrons and their respective velocities is necessary. In order to do\nso, a position sensitive detector as well as a way to determine the velocities\nis needed. Measuring the velocities can either be done by using only a single\nwavelength and therefore velocity or by creating pulses, where the start and\nend time of each pulse is known and registering the time of arrival at the\ndetector, which is the case we want to consider here. This pulse shaping\nprocess in neutron scattering instruments is usually done by using a\nconfiguration of several choppers. This set of choppers is then used to define\nboth the beginning and the end of the pulse. Additionally there is of course\nalso a selection in phase space determining the final resolution that can be\nachieved by the instrument. Taking into account the special requirements of a\nspecific instrument, here a small-angle neutron scattering instrument, creates\nan additional set of restrictions that have to be taken into account. In this\nmanuscript a chopper configuration for two possible settings, namely a maximum\nflux and a high-resolution mode will be presented.\n", "  Using first-principles density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, we\ninvestigate the 4/3-monolayer structure of Pb on the Si(111) or Ge(111) surface\nwithin the two competing structural models termed the H$_3$ and T$_4$\nstructures. We find that the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) influences the relative\nstability of the two structures in both the Pb/Si(111) and Pb/Ge(111) systems:\ni.e., our DFT calculation without including the SOC predicts that the T$_4$\nstructure is energetically favored over the H$_3$ structure by ${\\Delta}E$ = 25\nmeV for Pb/Si(111) and 22 meV for Pb/Ge(111), but the inclusion of SOC reverses\ntheir relative stability as ${\\Delta}E$ = $-$12 and $-$7 meV, respectively. Our\nanalysis shows that the SOC-induced switching of the ground state is attributed\nto a more asymmetric surface charge distribution in the H$_3$ structure, which\ngives rise to a relatively larger Rashba spin splitting of surface states as\nwell as a relatively larger pseudo-gap opening compared to the T$_4$ structure.\nBy the nudged elastic band calculation, we obtain a sizable energy barrier from\nthe H$_3$ to the T$_4$ structure as ${\\sim}$0.59 and ${\\sim}$0.27 eV for\nPb/Si(111) and Pb/Ge(111), respectively. It is thus likely that the two\nenergetically competing structures can coexist at low temperatures.\n", "  Ab initio total energy calculations show that the antiferromagnetic (111)\norder is not the ground state for the ideal CuMnSb Heusler alloy in contrast to\nthe results of neutron diffraction experiments. It is known, that Heusler\nalloys usually contain various defects depending on the sample preparation. We\nhave therefore investigated magnetic phases of CuMnSb assuming the most common\ndefects which exist in real experimental conditions. The full-potential\nsupercell approach and a Heisenberg model approach using the coherent potential\napproximation are adopted. The results of the total energy supercell\ncalculations indicate that defects that bring Mn atoms close together promote\nthe antiferromagnetic (111) structure already for a low critical defect\nconcentrations ($\\approx$ 3%). A detailed study of exchange interactions\nbetween Mn-moments further supports the above stabilization mechanism. Finally,\nthe stability of the antiferromagnetic (111) order is enhanced by inclusion of\nelectron correlations in narrow Mn-bands. The present refinement structure\nanalysis of neutron scattering experiment supports theoretical conclusions.\n", "  Using bibliometric data artificially generated through a model of citation\ndynamics calibrated on empirical data, we compare several indicators for the\nscientific impact of individual researchers. The use of such a controlled setup\nhas the advantage of avoiding the biases present in real databases, and allows\nus to assess which aspects of the model dynamics and which traits of individual\nresearchers a particular indicator actually reflects. We find that the simple\ncitation average performs well in capturing the intrinsic scientific ability of\nresearchers, whatever the length of their career. On the other hand, when\nproductivity complements ability in the evaluation process, the notorious $h$\nand $g$ indices reveal their potential, yet their normalized variants do not\nalways yield a fair comparison between researchers at different career stages.\nNotably, the use of logarithmic units for citation counts allows us to build\nsimple indicators with performance equal to that of $h$ and $g$. Our analysis\nmay provide useful hints for a proper use of bibliometric indicators.\nAdditionally, our framework can be extended by including other aspects of the\nscientific production process and citation dynamics, with the potential to\nbecome a standard tool for the assessment of impact metrics.\n", "  We present a joint optical/X-ray analysis of the massive galaxy cluster Abell\n2744 (z=0.308). Our strong- and weak-lensing analysis within the central region\nof the cluster, i.e., at R<1Mpc from the brightest cluster galaxy, reveals\neight substructures, including the main core. All of these dark-matter halos\nare detected with a significance of at least 5sigma and feature masses ranging\nfrom 0.5 to 1.4x10^{14}Msun within R<150kpc. Merten et al. (2011) and\nMedezinski et al. (2016) substructures are also detected by us. We measure a\nslightly higher mass for the main core component than reported previously and\nattribute the discrepancy to the inclusion of our tightly constrained\nstrong-lensing mass model built on Hubble Frontier Fields data. X-ray data\nobtained by XMM-Newton reveal four remnant cores, one of them a new detection,\nand three shocks. Unlike Merten et al. (2011), we find all cores to have both\ndark and luminous counterparts. A comparison with clusters of similar mass in\nthe MXXL simulations yields no objects with as many massive substructures as\nobserved in Abell 2744, confirming that Abell 2744 is an extreme system. We\nstress that these properties still do not constitute a challenge to\n$\\Lambda$CDM, as caveats apply to both the simulation and the observations: for\ninstance, the projected mass measurements from gravitational lensing and the\nlimited resolution of the sub-haloes finders. We discuss implications of Abell\n2744 for the plausibility of different dark-matter candidates and, finally,\nmeasure a new upper limit on the self-interaction cross-section of dark matter\nof sigma_{DM}<1.28cm2/g(68\\% CL), in good agreement with previous results from\nHarvey et al. (2015).\n", "  InGaAs/GaAsBi/InGaAs quantum wells (QWs) were grown on GaAs substrates by gas\nsource molecular beam epitaxy for realizing the type II band-edge line-up. Both\ntype I and type II transitions were observed in the Bi containing W QWs and the\nphotoluminescence intensity was enhanced in the sample with a high Bi content,\nwhich is mainly due to the improvement of carrier confinement. Blue-shift of\ntype II transitions at high excitation power density was observed and ascribed\nto the band-bending effect. The calculated transition energies based on 8 band\nk.p model fit well with the experiment results. The experimental and\ntheoretical results show that the type-II QW design is a new promising\ncandidate for realizing long wavelength GaAs-based light emitting devices near\n1.3 um.\n", "  A novel method to estimate unsteady aerodynamic force coefficients from\npointwise velocity measurements is presented. The methodology is based on a\nresolvent-based reduced-order model which requires the mean flow to obtain\nphysical flow structures and pointwise measurement to calibrate their\namplitudes. A computationally-affordable time-stepping methodology to obtain\nresolvent modes in non-trivial flow domains is introduced and compared to\nprevious existing matrix-free and matrix-forming strategies. The technique is\napplied to the unsteady flow around an inclined square cylinder at low Reynolds\nnumber. The potential of the methodology is demonstrated through good agreement\nbetween the fluctuating pressure distribution on the cylinder and the temporal\nevolution of the unsteady lift and drag coefficients predicted by the model and\nthose computed by direct numerical simulation.\n", "  Discrepancies between the measured and simulated gain in Thick Micropatterned\ngaseous detectors (MPGD), namely THGEM, have been observed by several groups.\nIn order to simulate the electron avalanches and the gain the community relies\non the calculations performed in Garfield++, known to produce differences of 2\norders of magnitude in comparison to the experimental data for thick MPGDs.\n  In this work, simulations performed for Ne/5%CH4, Ar/5%CH4 and Ar/30%CO2\nmixtures shows that Garfield++ is able to perfectly describe the experimental\ndata if Penning effect is included in the simulation. The comparison between\nthe number of excitations which may lead to a Penning transfer, is shown for\nTHGEM and GEM, explaining the less pronounced gain discrepancies observed in\nGEM.\n", "  We present a geometric approach to D-brane model building on the\nnon-factorisable torus backgrounds of $T^6/\\mathbb{Z}_4$, which are $A_3 \\times\nA_3$ and $A_3 \\times A_1 \\times B_2$. Based on the counting of `short'\nsupersymmetric three-cycles per complex structure {\\it vev}, the number of\nphysically inequivalent lattice orientations with respect to the\nanti-holomorphic involution ${\\cal R}$ of the Type IIA/$\\Omega\\cal{R}$\norientifold can be reduced to three for the $A_3 \\times A_3$ lattice and four\nfor the $A_3 \\times A_1 \\times B_2$ lattice. While four independent\nthree-cycles on $A_3 \\times A_3$ cannot accommodate phenomenologically\ninteresting global models with a chiral spectrum, the eight-dimensional space\nof three-cycles on $A_3 \\times A_1 \\times B_2$ is rich enough to provide for\nparticle physics models, with several globally consistent two- and\nfour-generation Pati-Salam models presented here.\n  We further show that for fractional {\\it sLag} three-cycles, the compact\ngeometry can be rewritten in a $(T^2)^3$ factorised form, paving the way for a\ngeneralisation of known CFT methods to determine the vector-like spectrum and\nto derive the low-energy effective action for open string states.\n", "  [abridged] We quantify the evolution of the stellar mass functions of\nstar-forming and quiescent galaxies as a function of morphology from $z\\sim 3$\nto the present. Our sample consists of ~50,000 galaxies in the CANDELS fields\n($\\sim880$ $arcmin^2$), which we divide into four main morphological types,\ni.e. pure bulge dominated systems, pure spiral disk dominated, intermediate\n2-component bulge+disk systems and irregular disturbed galaxies. Our main\nresults are:\n  Star-formation: At $z\\sim 2$, 80\\% of the stellar mass density of\nstar-forming galaxies is in irregular systems. However, by $z\\sim 0.5$,\nirregular objects only dominate at stellar masses below $10^9M\\odot$. A\nmajority of the star-forming irregulars present at $z\\sim 2$ undergo a gradual\ntransformation from disturbed to normal spiral disk morphologies by $z\\sim 1$\nwithout significant interruption to their star-formation. Rejuvenation after a\nquenching event does not seem to be common except perhaps for the most massive\nobjects.\n  Quenching: We confirm that galaxies reaching a stellar mass of\n$M_*\\sim10^{10.8}M_\\odot$ ($M^*$) tend to quench. Also, quenching implies the\npresence of a bulge: the abundance of massive red disks is negligible at all\nredshifts over 2~dex in stellar mass. However the dominant quenching mechanism\nevolves. At $z>2$, the SMF of quiescent galaxies above $M^*$ is dominated by\ncompact spheroids. Quenching at this early epoch destroys the disk and produces\na compact remnant unless the star-forming progenitors at even higher redshifts\nare significantly more dense. At $1<z<2$, the majority of newly quenched\ngalaxies are disks with a significant central bulge. This suggests that\nmass-quenching at this epoch starts from the inner parts and preserves the\ndisk. At $z<1$, the high mass end of the passive SMF is globally in place and\nthe evolution mostly happens at stellar masses below $10^{10}M_\\odot$.\n", "  High temperature atomic configurations of fcc Fe-Cr-Ni alloys with alloy\ncomposition close to austenitic steel are studied in statistical thermodynamic\nsimulations with effective interactions obtained in ab initio calculations. The\nlatter are done taking longitudinal spin fluctuations (LSF) into consideration\nwithin a quasiclassical phenomenological model. It is demonstrated that\nmagnetic state affects greatly the alloy properties and in particular, it is\nshown that the LSF substantially modify the bonding and interatomic\ninteractions of fcc Fe-Cr-Ni alloys even at ambient conditions. The calculated\natomic short-range order (SRO) is in reasonable agreement with existing\nexperimental data for Fe0.56}Cr0.21Ni0.23, which has strong preference for the\n(001) type ordering between Ni and Cr atoms. A similar ordering tendency is\nfound for the Fe0.75Cr0.17Ni0.08 alloy composition, which approximately\ncorresponds to the widely used 304 and 316 austenitic steel grades.\n", "  Thin planar pixel modules are promising candidates to instrument the inner\nlayers of the new ATLAS pixel detector for HL-LHC, thanks to the reduced\ncontribution to the material budget and their high charge collection efficiency\nafter irradiation. 100-200 $\\mu$m thick sensors, interconnected to FE-I4\nread-out chips, have been characterized with radioactive sources and beam tests\nat the CERN-SPS and DESY. The results of these measurements are reported for\ndevices before and after irradiation up to a fluence of $14\\times10^{15}$\nn$_{eq}$/cm$^2$. The charge collection and tracking efficiency of the different\nsensor thicknesses are compared. The outlook for future planar pixel sensor\nproduction is discussed, with a focus on sensor design with the pixel pitches\n(50x50 and 25x100 $\\mu$m$^2$) foreseen for the RD53 Collaboration read-out chip\nin 65 nm CMOS technology. An optimization of the biasing structures in the\npixel cells is required to avoid the hit efficiency loss presently observed in\nthe punch-through region after irradiation. For this purpose the performance of\ndifferent layouts have been compared in FE-I4 compatible sensors at various\nfluence levels by using beam test data. Highly segmented sensors will represent\na challenge for the tracking in the forward region of the pixel system at\nHL-LHC. In order to reproduce the performance of 50x50 $\\mu$m$^2$ pixels at\nhigh pseudo-rapidity values, FE-I4 compatible planar pixel sensors have been\nstudied before and after irradiation in beam tests at high incidence angle\n(80$^\\circ$) with respect to the short pixel direction. Results on cluster\nshapes, charge collection and hit efficiency will be shown.\n", "  Context. Classical novae are thermonuclear explosions that take place in the\nenvelopes of accreting white dwarfs in stellar binary systems. The material\ntransferred onto the white dwarf piles up under degenerate conditions, driving\na thermonuclear runaway. In those outbursts, about 10-7 - 10-3 Msun, enriched\nin CNO and, sometimes, other intermediate-mass elements (e.g., Ne, Na, Mg, or\nAl, for ONe novae) are ejected into the interstellar medium. The large\nconcentrations of metals spectroscopically inferred in the nova ejecta reveal\nthat the (solar-like) material transferred from the secondary mixes with the\noutermost layers of the underlying white dwarf.\n  Aims. Most theoretical models of nova outbursts reported to date yield, on\naverage, outflows characterized by O > C, from which only oxidized condensates\n(e.g, O-rich grains) would be expected, in principle.\n  Methods. To specifically address whether CO novae can actually produce C-rich\ndust, six different hydrodynamic nova models have been evolved, from accretion\nto the expansion and ejection stages, with different choices for the\ncomposition of the substrate with which the solar-like accreted material mixes.\nUpdated chemical profiles inside the H-exhausted core have been used, based on\nstellar evolution calculations for a progenitor of 8 Msun through H and\nHe-burning phases.\n  Results. We show that these profiles lead to C-rich ejecta after the nova\noutburst. This extends the possible contribution of novae to the inventory of\npresolar grains identified in meteorites, particularly in a number of\ncarbonaceous phases (i.e., nanodiamonds, silicon carbides and graphites).\n", "  The standard theoretical framework to deal with weak decays of heavy mesons\nis the so-called weak effective Hamiltonian. It involves the short-distance\nWilson coefficients, which depend on the renormalisation scale $\\mu$. For\nspecific calculations one has to evolve the Wilson coefficients down from the\nelectroweak scale $\\mu=M_W$ to the typical mass scale of the decay under\nconsideration. This is done by solving a renormalisation group equation for the\neffective operator basis. In this paper the results of a consistent two-step\nrunning of the $c \\to u \\,\\ell^+\\ell^-$ Wilson coefficients for dimension-6\noperators are presented. This running involves the intermediate scale $\\mu=m_b$\n(with $M_W > m_b > m_c$) where the bottom quark is integrated out. The matching\ncoefficients and anomalous dimensions are taken to the required order by\ngeneralizing and extending results from $b \\to s$ or $s \\to d$ transitions\navailable in the literature.\n", "  We compare lattice scales determined from the vector meson mass and the\nWilson flow scale w_0 in QCD with two-flavours of rooted naive staggered\nfermions over a wide range of lattice spacing and quark mass. We find that the\ndistributions of meson correlation functions are non-Gaussian. We modify the\nstatistical analysis to take care of the non-Gaussianity. Current day\nimprovements in the statistical quality of data on hadron correlations further\nallow us to simplify certain aspects of the analysis of masses. We examine\nthese changes through the analysis of pions and apply them to the vector meson.\nWe compare the flow scale determined using the rho mass with that using\nLambda_{MSbar}.\n", "  We investigate percolation in binary and ternary mixtures of patchy colloidal\nparticles theoretically and using Monte Carlo simulations. Each particle has\nthree identical patches, with distinct species having different types of patch.\nTheoretically we assume tree-like clusters and calculate the bonding\nprobabilities using Wertheim's first-order perturbation theory for association.\nFor ternary mixtures we find up to eight fundamentally different percolated\nstates. The states differ in terms of the species and pairs of species that\nhave percolated. The strongest gel is a trigel or tricontinuous gel, in which\neach of the three species has percolated. The weakest gel is a mixed gel in\nwhich all of the particles have percolated, but none of the species percolates\nby itself. The competition between entropy of mixing and internal energy of\nbonding determines the stability of each state. Theoretical and simulation\nresults are in very good agreement. The only significant difference is the\ntemperature at the percolation threshold, which is overestimated by the theory\ndue to the absence of closed loops in the theoretical description.\n", "  We demonstrate that the coherence of a single mobile atomic qubit can be well\npreserved during a transfer process among different optical dipole traps\n(ODTs). This is a prerequisite step in realizing a large-scale neutral atom\nquantum information processing platform. A qubit encoded in the hyperfine\nmanifold of $^{87}$Rb atom is dynamically extracted from the static quantum\nregister by an auxiliary moving ODT and reinserted into the static ODT.\nPrevious experiments were limited by decoherences induced by the differential\nlight shifts of qubit states. Here we apply a magic-intensity trapping\ntechnique which mitigates the detrimental effects of light shifts and\nsubstantially enhances the coherence time to $225 \\pm 21\\,\\mathrm{ms}$. The\nexperimentally demonstrated magic trapping technique relies on the previously\nneglected hyperpolarizability contribution to the light shifts, which makes the\nlight shift dependence on the trapping laser intensity to be parabolic. Because\nof the parabolic dependence, at a certain \"magic\" intensity, the first order\nsensitivity to trapping light intensity variations over ODT volume is\neliminated. We experimentally demonstrate the utility of this approach and\nmeasure hyperpolarizability for the first time. Our results pave the way for\nconstructing a scalable quantum-computing architectures with single atoms\ntrapped in an array of magic ODTs.\n", "  In this paper we study the zero energy solutions of the Dirac equation in the\nbackground of a $Z_2$ vortex of a non-Abelian gauge model with three charged\nscalar fields. We determine the number of the fermionic zero modes giving their\nexplicit form for two specific Ansatze.\n", "  We generalize magnetoelectronic circuit theory to account for spin transfer\nto and from the atomic lattice via interfacial spin-orbit coupling. This\nenables a proper treatment of spin transport at interfaces between a\nferromagnet and a heavy-metal non-magnet. This generalized approach describes\nspin transport in terms of drops in spin and charge accumulations across the\ninterface (as in the standard approach), but additionally includes the\nresponses from in-plane electric fields and offsets in spin accumulations. A\nkey finding is that in-plane electric fields give rise to spin accumulations\nand spin currents that can be polarized in any direction, generalizing the\nRashba-Edelstein and spin Hall effects. The spin accumulations exert torques on\nthe magnetization at the interface when they are misaligned from the\nmagnetization. The additional out-of-plane spin currents exert torques via the\nspin-transfer mechanism on the ferromagnetic layer. To account for these\nphenomena we also describe spin torques within the generalized circuit theory.\nThe additional effects included in this generalized circuit theory suggest\nmodifications in the interpretations of experiments involving spin orbit\ntorques, spin pumping, spin memory loss, the Rashba-Edelstein effect, and the\nspin Hall magnetoresistance.\n", "  We study the effects of laser pulse focussing on the spectral properties of\nThomson scattered radiation. Modelling the laser as a paraxial beam we find\nthat, in all but the most extreme cases of focussing, the temporal envelope has\na much bigger effect on the spectrum than the focussing itself. For the case of\nultra-short pulses, where the paraxial model is no longer valid, we adopt a\nsub-cycle vector beam description of the field. It is found that the emission\nharmonics are blue shifted and broaden out in frequency space as the pulse\nbecomes shorter. Additionally the carrier envelope phase becomes important,\nresulting in an angular asymmetry in the spectrum. We then use the same model\nto study the effects of focussing beyond the limit where the paraxial expansion\nis valid. It is found that fields focussed to sub-wavelength spot sizes produce\nspectra that are qualitatively similar to those from sub-cycle pulses due to\nthe shortening of the pulse with focussing. Finally, we study high-intensity\nfields and find that, in general, the focussing makes negligible difference to\nthe spectra in the regime of radiation reaction.\n", "  One loop contributions to the CP even-CP odd Higgs boson mixings arising from\ncontributions due to exchange of a vectorlike multiplet are computed under the\nHiggs boson mass constraint. The vectorlike multiplet consists of a fourth\ngeneration of quarks and a mirror generation. This sector brings in new CP\nphases which can be large consistent with EDM constraints. In this work we\ncompute the contributions from the exchange of quarks and mirror quarks\n$t_{4L}, t_{4R}, T_{L}, T_{R}$, and their scalar partners, the squarks and the\nmirror squarks. The effect of their contributions to the Higgs boson masses and\nmixings are computed and analyzed. The possibility of measuring the effects of\nmixing of CP even and CP odd Higgs in experiment is discussed. It is shown that\nthe branching ratios of the Higgs bosons into fermion pairs are sensitive to\nnew physics and specifically to CP phases.\n", "  We describe a \"super-Earth\"-size ($2.30\\pm0.15R_{\\oplus}$) planet transiting\nan early K-type dwarf star in the Campaign 4 field observed by the K2 mission.\nThe host star, EPIC 210363145, was identified as a member of the approximately\n120-Myr-old Pleiades cluster based on its kinematics and photometric distance.\nIt is rotationally variable and exhibits near-ultraviolet emission consistent\nwith a Pleiades age, but its rotational period is ~20 d and its spectrum\ncontains no H$\\alpha$ emission nor the Li I absorption expected of Pleiades K\ndwarfs. Instead, the star is probably an interloper that is unaffiliated with\nthe cluster, but younger (< 1 Gyr) than the typical field dwarf. We ruled out a\nfalse positive transit signal produced by confusion with a background eclipsing\nbinary by adaptive optics imaging and a statistical calculation. Doppler radial\nvelocity measurements limit the companion mass to <2 times that of Jupiter.\nScreening of the lightcurves of 1014 potential Pleiades candidate stars\nuncovered no additional planets. An injection-and-recovery experiment using the\nK2 Pleiades lightcurves with simulated planets, assuming a planet population\nlike that in the Kepler prime field, predicts only 0.8-1.8 detections (vs. ~20\nin an equivalent Kepler sample). The absence of Pleiades planet detections can\nbe attributed to the much shorter monitoring time of K2 (80 days vs. 4 years),\nincreased measurement noise due to spacecraft motion, and the intrinsic\nnoisiness of the stars.\n", "  We review the reasons why one might choose to seriously re-examine the\ntraditional approach to nuclear theory where nucleons are treated as immutable.\nThis examination leads us to argue that the modification of the structure of\nthe nucleon when immersed in a nuclear medium is fundamental to how atomic\nnuclei are built. Consistent with this approach we suggest key experiments\nwhich should tell us unambiguously whether there is such a change in the\nstructure of a bound nucleon. We also briefly report on extremely promising\nrecent calculations of the structure of nuclei across the periodic table based\nupon this idea.\n", "  The upcoming operation of the Extra Low ENergy Antiprotons (ELENA) ring at\nCERN, the upgrade of the anti-proton decelerator (AD), and the installation in\nthe AD hall of an intense slow positron beam with an expected flux of $10^{8}$\ne$^+$/s will open the possibility for new experiments with anti-hydrogen\n($\\bar{\\text{H}}$). Here we propose a scheme to measure the Lamb shift of\n$\\bar{\\text{H}}$. For a month of data taking, we anticipate an uncertainty of\n100 ppm. This will provide a test of CPT and the first determination of the\nanti-proton charge radius at the level of 10%.\n", "  We compute the perturbative corrections to the HQET sum rules for the matrix\nelement of the \\Delta B=2 operator that determines the mass shift of $B^0$,\n$\\bar{B}^0$ states. Technically, we obtain analytically the non-factorizable\ncontributions at order $\\alpha_s$ to the bag parameter that first appear at the\nthree-loop level. Together with the known non-perturbative corrections due to\nvacuum condensates and $1/m_b$ corrections, the full next-to-leading order\nresult is now available. We present a numerical value for the renormalization\ngroup invariant bag parameter that is phenomenologically relevant and discuss\ncomparison with recent lattice determinations.\n", "  Models in which the 750 GeV resonance ($S$) decays to two light axion-like\nparticles (ALPs $a$), which in turn decay to collimated photons mimicking the\nobserved signal, are motivated by Hidden Valley scenarios and could also\nprovide a mechanism by which a $S \\to \\gamma \\gamma$ signal persists while $S\n\\to Z \\gamma,\\; ZZ$ and $WW$ remain subdued in the near future. We point out\nthat these Hidden Valley like models invoking $S \\to aa \\to 4 \\gamma$ must also\ncontend with $Z \\to a (\\to \\gamma \\gamma) \\gamma$ constraints coming from CDF\nand ATLAS. Within an effective field theory framework, we work out the\nconstraints on the couplings of $S$ to $a$ and gauge bosons coming from\nphotonic $Z$ decays and ensuring that the ALPs decay inside the electromagnetic\ncalorimeter, in two regimes - where $a$ decays primarily to photons, and where\n$a$ also has hadronic branchings. The analysis is done for both when $S$ has a\nlarge as well as a narrow width, and for different relative contributions to\nthe signal coming from $S \\to \\gamma \\gamma$ and $a \\to \\gamma \\gamma$. Results\nfor the particular case where $S$ and $a$ belong to the same complex field are\nalso presented. A $\\gamma\\gamma$ resonance at the $Z$-pole coming from $Z \\to a\n\\gamma$ is expected in this class of models. Taking benchmark ALP masses below\naround 0.4 GeV and, assuming reasonable values for the fake jet rate and the\nidentification efficiency of the photon-jet, we find the prospects for the\ndiscovery of diphotons at the $Z$-pole.\n", "  We demonstrate a high-power narrow-linewidth ultraviolet (UV) laser system at\n318.6 nm for direct 6S1/2-nP (n = 70 to 100) Rydberg excitation of cesium\natoms. Based on commercial fiber lasers and efficient nonlinear frequency\nconversion technology, 2.26 W of tunable UV laser power is obtained from\ncavity-enhanced second harmonic generation following sum-frequency generation\nof two infrared lasers at 1560.5 nm and 1076.9 nm to 637.2 nm. The maximum\ndoubling efficiency is 57.3%. The typical UV laser power root-mean-square\nfluctuation is less than 0.87% over 30 minutes, and the continuously tunable\nrange of the UV laser frequency is more than 6 GHz. Its beam quality factors M2\nX and M2 Y are 1.16 and 1.48, respectively. This high-performance UV laser has\nsignificant potential use in quantum optics and cold atom physics.\n", "  Efficient structure search is a major challenge in computational materials\nscience. We present a modification of the basin hopping global geometry\noptimization approach that uses a curvilinear coordinate system to describe\nglobal trial moves. This approach has recently been shown to be efficient in\nstructure determination of clusters [Nano Letters 15, 8044-8048 (2015)] and is\nhere extended for its application to covalent, complex molecules and large\nadsorbates on surfaces. The employed, automatically constructed delocalized\ninternal coordinates are similar to molecular vibrations, which enhances the\ngeneration of chemically meaningful trial structures. By introducing flexible\nconstraints and local translation and rotation of independent geometrical\nsubunits we enable the use of this method for molecules adsorbed on surfaces\nand interfaces. For two test systems, trans-$\\beta$-ionylideneacetic acid\nadsorbed on a Au(111) surface and methane adsorbed on a Ag(111) surface, we\nobtain superior performance of the method compared to standard optimization\nmoves based on Cartesian coordinates.\n", "  The D0 Collaboration has recently reported a narrow peak structure in the\n$B_s^0\\pi^\\pm$ invariant-mass spectrum, that is called $X(5568)$. Its proposed\nquantum numbers $J^P=0^+/1^+$ are not determined unambiguously, and we show\nthat one can fit the data assuming $J^P=1^-$ with the same mass and width for\nthe resonance signal. The corresponding isovector $P$-wave coupled-channel\nscattering involving the states $B_s\\pi$, $B_s^*\\pi$, $B \\overline{K}$ and\n$B^*\\overline K$ is studied employing leading-order Heavy Meson Chiral\nPerturbation Theory, which is then unitarized making use of standard techniques\nfrom Unitary Chiral Perturbation Theory. The subtraction constants that appear\nin the unitarization process are determined by a $u$-channel crossing symmetry\nconstraint or by naturalness arguments, being the numerical values obtained in\nboth cases quite closed, and no further freedom is left in the model. A crucial\npoint is that if the $X(5568)$ is $1^-$ and decaying into $B_s^0\\pi^\\pm$ then\nit should appear as a pole in the $T$-matrix elements. It finally turns out\nthat no $X(5568)$ pole is found that can be qualified as dynamically generated\nfrom the isovector $P$-wave coupled-channel dynamics. This result disfavors the\ninterpretation of the $X(5568)$ within a \"molecular\" picture.\n", "  The purpose of these lectures is to describe the basic theoretical structures\nunderlying the rich and beautiful physics of the quantum Hall effect. The focus\nis on the interplay between microscopic wavefunctions, long-distance effective\nChern-Simons theories, and the modes which live on the boundary. The notes are\naimed at graduate students in any discipline where $\\hbar=1$. A working\nknowledge of quantum field theory is assumed. Contents:\n  1. The Basics (Landau levels and Berry phase).\n  2. The Integer Quantum Hall Effect.\n  3. The Fractional Quantum Hall Effect.\n  4. Non-Abelian Quantum Hall States.\n  5. Chern-Simons Theories.\n  6. Edge Modes.\n", "  We revisit the production of baryon asymmetries in the minimal type I seesaw\nmodel with heavy Majorana singlets in the GeV range. In particular we include\n\"washout\" effects from scattering processes with gauge bosons, Higgs decays and\ninverse decays, besides the dominant top scatterings. We show that in the\nminimal model with two singlets, and for an inverted light neutrino ordering,\nfuture measurements from SHiP and neutrinoless double beta decay could in\nprinciple provide sufficient information to predict the matter-antimatter\nasymmetry in the universe. We also show that SHiP measurements could provide\nvery valuable information on the PMNS CP phases.\n", "  We provide estimates of atmospheric pressure and surface composition on\nshort-period rocky exoplanets with dayside magma pools and silicate vapor\natmospheres. Atmospheric pressure tends toward vapor-pressure equilibrium with\nsurface magma, and magma-surface composition is set by the competing effects of\nfractional vaporization and surface-interior exchange. We use basic models to\nshow how surface-interior exchange is controlled by the planet's temperature,\nmass, and initial composition. We assume that mantle rock undergoes bulk\nmelting to form the magma pool, and that winds flow radially away from the\nsubstellar point. With these assumptions, we find that: (1) atmosphere-interior\nexchange is fast when the planet's bulk-silicate FeO concentration is low, and\nslow when FeO concentration is high; (2) magma pools are compositionally\nwell-mixed for substellar temperatures $\\lesssim$ 2400 K, but compositionally\nvariegated and rapidly variable for substellar temperatures $\\gtrsim$ 2400 K;\n(3) currents within the magma pool tend to cool the top of the solid mantle\n(\"tectonic refrigeration\"); (4) contrary to earlier work, many magma planets\nhave time-variable surface compositions.\n", "  In the present work we study production of $J/\\psi + \\chi_c$ and $J/\\psi +\nJ/\\psi$ in LHC. The first process is forbidden at the leading order in gluon\nfusion due to the $C$-parity conservation, and the first non-vanishing\ncontribution is given by the process with additional emission of real gluon.\nConsidering the direct production of $J/\\psi + J/\\psi$, where the leading order\nis allowed, we have found that the contribution from the higher order process\nwith real gluon emission is comparable and even more significant than the\nleading order. Moreover, account of this higher order effect dramatically\nchanges kinematical distributions. Through the present paper we study in\ndetails different channels of paired $J/\\psi + J/\\psi$ production: direct\n$J/\\psi + J/\\psi$ production, feed-down from $J/\\psi + \\chi_c$ channel, double\nparton scattering. We also try to find kinematical distributions that are most\nsuitable to separate these different channels.\n", "  We use the random phase approximation (RPA) method with the singles\ncorrelation energy contributions to calculate lattice energies of ten molecular\nsolids. While RPA gives too weak binding, underestimating the reference data by\n$13.7$\\% on average, much improved results are obtained when the singles are\nincluded at the GW singles excitations (GWSE) level, with average absolute\ndifference to the reference data of only $3.7$\\%. Consistently with previous\nresults, we find a very good agreement with the reference data for hydrogen\nbonded systems, while the binding is too weak for systems where dispersion\nforces dominate. In fact, the overall accuracy of the RPA+GWSE method is\nsimilar to an estimated accuracy of the reference data.\n", "  The consistency of the embedding of four-dimensional SO(8) gauged N=8\nsupergravity into eleven-dimensional supergravity, where the internal\ndirections are compactified on a seven-sphere, was established by de Wit and\nNicolai in the 1980s. The reduction ansatz for the eleven-dimensional metric,\nand for some of the components of the 4-form field strength, were found at that\ntime, and recently the complete expression for the 4-form reduction has been\nobtained. The expressions are quite complicated, and in many practical\napplications it would be sufficient to know the ansatz for a subset of the\nfour-dimensional fields. In this paper, we obtain explicit expressions for the\nembedding of the truncation of the full N=8 gauged theory to the N=2 gauged STU\nsupergravity. This corresponds, in the bosonic sector, to a consistent\ntruncation of the N=8 supergravity fields to those that are singlets under the\nU(1)^4 Cartan subalgebra of SO(8). This truncation to STU supergravity, which\ncomprises N=2 supergravity coupled to three vector multiplets, suffices, for\nexample, for lifting the general 8-charge asymptotically-AdS rotating black\nholes to eleven dimensions. We also give two distinct further truncations to\nN=2 supergravities coupled to single vector multiplets.\n", "  In three dimensional ${\\cal N}=4$ Chern-Simons-matter theories two\nindependent fermionic Wilson loop operators can be defined, which preserve half\nof the supersymmetry charges and are cohomologically equivalent at classical\nlevel. We compute their three-loop expectation value in a convenient color\nsector and prove that the degeneracy is uplifted by quantum corrections. We\nexpand the matrix model prediction in the same regime and by comparison we\nconclude that the quantum 1/2 BPS Wilson loop is the average of the two\noperators. We provide an all-loop argument to support this claim at any order.\nAs a by-product, we identify the localization result at three loops as a\ncorrection to the framing factor induced by matter interactions. Finally, we\ncomment on the quantum properties of the non-1/2 BPS Wilson loop operator\ndefined as the difference of the two fermionic ones.\n", "  QCD topological susceptibility at high temperature, $\\chi_t(T)$, provides an\nimportant input for the estimate of the axion abundance in the present\nUniverse. While the model independent determination of $\\chi_t(T)$ should be\npossible from the first principles using lattice QCD, existing methods fail at\nhigh temperature, since not only the probability that non-trivial topological\nsectors appear in the configuration generation process but also the local\ntopological fluctuations get strongly suppressed. We propose a novel method to\ncalculate the temperature dependence of topological susceptibility at high\ntemperature. A feasibility test is performed on a small lattice in the quenched\napproximation, and the results are compared with the prediction of the dilute\ninstanton gas approximation. It is found that the method works well especially\nat very high temperature and the result is consistent with the instanton\ncalculus down to $T\\sim 2\\, T_c$ within the statistical uncertainty.\n", "  To sustain a neutron star with about two times the solar mass, multi baryons\nincluding hyperons are expected to produce repulsive effects in the interior of\nits high baryon-density region. To examine possible quark-Pauli repulsion among\nthe baryons, we solve the eigenvalue problem of the quark antisymmetrizer for\nthree octet-baryons that are described by most compact spatial configurations.\nWe find that the Pauli blocking effect is weak in the $\\Lambda nn$ system,\nwhile it is strong in the $\\Sigma^-nn$ system. The appearance of the $\\Sigma^-$\nhyperon is suppressed in the neutron star interior but no quark-Pauli repulsion\neffectively works for the $\\Lambda$ hyperon.\n", "  An experimental study of the in-plane azimuthal behaviour and frequency\ndependence of the ferromagnetic resonance field and the resonance linewidth as\na function of BiFeO$_3$ thickness is carried out in a polycrystalline\nexchange-biased BiFeO$_3$/Ni$_{81}$Fe$_{19}$ system. The magnetization decrease\nof the Pt/BiFeO$_3$/Ni$_{81}$Fe$_{19}$/Pt heterostructures with BiFeO$_3$\nthickness deduced from static measurements has been confirmed by dynamic\ninvestigations. Ferromagnetic resonance measurements have shown lower\ngyromagnetic ratio in a perpendicular geometry compared with that of a parallel\ngeometry. The monotonous decrease of gyromagnetic ratio in a perpendicular\ngeometry as a function of the BiFeO$_3$ film thickness seems to be related to\nthe spin-orbit interactions due to the neighbouring Pt film at its interface\nwith Ni$_{81}$Fe$_{19}$ film. The in-plane azimuthal shape of the total\nlinewidth of the uniform mode shows isotropic behaviour that increases with\nBiFeO$_3$ thickness. The study of the frequency dependence of the resonance\nlinewidth in a broad band of 3 to 35 GHz has allowed the determination of\nintrinsic and extrinsic contributions to the relaxation as function of\nBiFeO$_3$ thickness in perpendicular geometries. In our system the magnetic\nrelaxation is dominated by the spin-pumping mechanism due to the presence of\nPt. The insertion of BiFeO$_3$ between Pt and Ni$_{81}$Fe$_{19}$ attenuates the\nspin-pumping damping at one interface.\n", "  We present a suite of codes (NLAT for nonlocal adiabatic transfer) to\ncalculate the transfer cross section for single-nucleon transfer reactions,\n$(d,N)$ or $(N,d)$, including nonlocal nucleon-target interactions, within the\nadiabatic distorted wave approximation. For this purpose, we implement an\niterative method for solving the second order nonlocal differential equation,\nfor both scattering and bound states. The final observables that can be\nobtained with NLAT are differential angular distributions for the cross\nsections of $A(d,N)B$ or $B(N,d)A$. Details on the implementation of the\nT-matrix to obtain the final cross sections within the adiabatic distorted wave\napproximation method are also provided. This code is suitable to be applied for\ndeuteron induced reactions in the range of $E_d=10-70$ MeV, and provides cross\nsections with $4\\%$ accuracy.\n", "  Fourier transform scanning tunneling spectroscopy (FT-STS), or quasiparticle\ninterference (QPI), has become an influential tool for the study of a wide\nrange of important materials in condensed matter physics. However, FT-STS in\ncomplex materials is often challenging to interpret, requiring significant\ntheoretical input in many cases, making it crucial to understand potential\nartifacts of the measurement. Here, we compare the most common modes of\nacquiring FT-STS data and show through both experiment and simulations that\nartifact features can arise that depend on how the tip height is stabilized\nthroughout the course of the measurement. The most dramatic effect occurs when\na series of dI/dV maps at different energies are acquired with simultaneous\nconstant current feedback; here a feature that disperses in energy appears that\nis not observed in other measurement modes. Such artifact features are similar\nto those arising from real physical processes in the sample and are susceptible\nto misinterpretation.\n", "  The cryogenic WISE mission in 2010 was extremely sensitive to asteroids and\nnot biased against detecting dark objects. The albedos of 428 Near Earth\nAsteroids (NEAs) observed by WISE during its fully cryogenic mission can be fit\nquite well by a 3 parameter function that is the sum of two Rayleigh\ndistributions. The Rayleigh distribution is zero for negative values, and\nfollows $f(x) = x \\exp[-x^2/(2\\sigma^2)]/\\sigma^2$ for positive x. The peak\nvalue is at x=\\sigma, so the position and width are tied together. The three\nparameters are the fraction of the objects in the dark population, the position\nof the dark peak, and the position of the brighter peak. We find that 25.3% of\nthe NEAs observed by WISE are in a very dark population peaking at $p_V =\n0.03$, while the other 74.7% of the NEAs seen by WISE are in a moderately dark\npopulation peaking at $p_V = 0.168$. A consequence of this bimodal distribution\nis that the Congressional mandate to find 90% of all NEAs larger than 140 m\ndiameter cannot be satisfied by surveying to H=22 mag, since a 140 m diameter\nasteroid at the very dark peak has H=23.7 mag, and more than 10% of NEAs are\ndarker than p_V = 0.03.\n", "  We present an overview of the \"KIFF\" project, which provides ultra-deep\nKs-band imaging of all six of the Hubble Frontier Fields clusters Abell 2744,\nMACS-0416, Abell S1063, Abell 370, MACS-0717 and MACS-1149. All of these fields\nhave recently been observed with large allocations of Directors' Discretionary\nTime with the HST and Spitzer telescopes covering 0.4 < lambda < 1.6 microns\nand 3.6--4.5 microns, respectively. VLT/HAWK-I integrations of the first four\nfields reach 5-sigma limiting depths of Ks~26.0 (AB, point sources) and have\nexcellent image quality (FWHM ~ 0.\"4). Shorter Keck/MOSFIRE integrations of the\nMACS-0717 (MACS-1149) field better observable in the north reach limiting\ndepths Ks=25.5 (25.1) with seeing FWHM ~0.\"4 (0.\"5). In all cases the Ks-band\nmosaics cover the primary cluster and parallel HST/ACS+WFC3 fields. The total\narea of the Ks-band coverage is 490 arcmin^2. The Ks-band at 2.2 microns\ncrucially fills the gap between the reddest HST filter (1.6 micron ~ H-band)\nand the IRAC 3.6 micron passband. While reaching the full depths of the\nspace-based imaging is not currently feasible from the ground, the deep Ks-band\nimages provide important constraints on both the redshifts and the stellar\npopulation properties of galaxies extending well below the characteristic\nstellar mass across most of the age of the universe, down to, and including,\nthe redshifts of the targeted galaxy clusters (z < 0.5).\n", "  We study the dissipative dynamics of an atom in a V-level configuration\ndriven by lasers and coupled to a semi-infinite waveguide. The coupling to the\nwaveguide is chiral, in that each transition interacts only with the modes\npropagating in a given direction, and this direction is opposite for the two\ntransitions. The waveguide is terminated by a mirror which coherently feeds the\nphoton stream emitted by one transition back to the atom. First, we are\ninterested in the dynamics of the atom in the Markovian limit where the\ntime-delay in the feedback is negligible. Specifically, we study the conditions\nunder which the atom evolves towards a pure \"dark\" stationary state, where the\nphotons emitted by both transitions interfere destructively thanks to the\ncoherent feedback, and the overall emission vanishes. This is a single-atom\nanalog of the quantum dimer, where a pair of laser-driven two-level atoms is\ncoupled to a unidirectional waveguide and dissipates towards a pure entangled\ndark state. Our setup should be feasible with current state-of-the-art\nexperiments. Second, we extend our study to non-Markovian regimes and\ninvestigate the effect of the feedback retardation on the steady-state.\n", "  Noise measurement is a powerful tool to investigate many phenomena from laser\ncharacterization to quantum behavior of light. In this paper, we report on\nintensity noise measurements obtained when a laser beam is transmitted through\na large cloud of cold atoms. While this measurement could possibly investigate\ncomplex processes such as the influence of atomic motion, one is first limited\nby the conversion of the intrinsic laser frequency noise to intensity noise via\nthe atomic resonance. This conversion is studied here in details. We show that,\nwhile experimental intensity noise spectra collapse onto the same curve at low\nFourier frequencies, some differences appear at higher frequencies when the\nprobe beam is detuned from the center of the resonance line. A simple model,\nbased on a mean-field approach, which corresponds to describing the atomic\ncloud by a dielectric susceptibility, is sufficient to understand the main\nfeatures. Using this model, the noise spectra allow extracting some\nquantitative informations on the laser noise as well as on the atomic sample.\n", "  We consider the Higgs-radion mixing in the context of warped space extra\ndimensional models with custodial symmetry and investigate the prospects of\ndetecting the mixed radion. Custodial symmetries allow the Kaluza-Klein\nexcitations to be lighter, and protect Zbb to be in agreement with experimental\nconstraints. We perform a complementary study of discovery reaches of the\nHiggs-radion mixed state at the 13 and 14 TeV LHC and at the 500 and 1000 GeV\nILC. We carry out a comprehensive analysis of the most significant production\nand decay modes of the mixed radion in the 80 GeV - 1 TeV mass range, and\nindicate the parameter space that can be probed at the LHC and the ILC. There\nexists a region of the parameter space which can be probed, at the LHC, through\nthe diphoton channel even for a relatively low luminosity of 50 fb^{-1}. The\nreach of the 4-lepton final state, in probing the parameter space is also\nstudied in the context of 14 TeV LHC, for a luminosity of 1000 fb^{-1}. At the\nILC, with an integrated luminosity of 500 fb^{-1}, we analyze the Z-radion\nassociated production and the WW fusion production, followed by the radion\ndecay into bb and W+W-. The WW fusion production is favored over the Z-radion\nassociated channel in probing regions of the parameter space beyond the LHC\nreach. The complementary study at the LHC and the ILC is useful both for the\ndiscovery of the radion and the understanding of its mixing sector.\n", "  Above the top of the solar corona, the young slow solar wind transitions from\nlow-beta, magnetically structured flow dominated by radial structures, to\nhigh-beta, less structured flow dominated by hydrodynamics. This transition,\nlong inferred via theory, is readily apparent in the sky region close to 10\ndegrees from the Sun, in processed, background-subtracted solar wind images. We\npresent image sequences collected by the STEREO/HI1 instrument in 2008 Dec,\ncovering apparent distances from approximately 4 to 24 degrees from the center\nof the Sun and spanning this transition in large-scale morphology of the wind.\nWe describe the observation and novel techniques to extract evolving image\nstructure from the images, and we use those data and techniques to present and\nquantify the clear textural shift in the apparent structure of the corona and\nsolar wind in this altitude range. We demonstrate that the change in apparent\ntexture is due both to anomalous fading of the radial striae that characterize\nthe corona, and to anomalous relative brightening of locally dense puffs of\nsolar wind that we term \"flocculae;\" and show that these phenomena are\ninconsistent with smooth radial flow, but consistent with onset of hydrodynamic\nor MHD instabilities leading to a turbulent cascade in the young solar wind.\n", "  For the first time, a cadmium tungstate crystal scintillator enriched in\n$^{116}$Cd has been succesfully tested as a scintillating bolometer. The\nmeasurement was performed above ground at a temperature of 18 mK. The crystal\nmass was 34.5 g and the enrichment level ~82 %. Despite a substantial pile-up\neffect due to above-ground operation, the detector demonstrated a high energy\nresolution (2-7 keV FWHM in 0.2-2.6 MeV $\\gamma$ energy range), a powerful\nparticle identification capability and a high level of internal radiopurity.\nThese results prove that cadmium tungstate is an extremely promising detector\nmaterial for a next-generation neutrinoless double-beta decay bolometric\nexperiment, like that proposed in the CUPID project (CUORE Upgrade with\nParticle IDentification).\n", "  Recent discovery of bulk insulating topological insulator (TI)\nBi2-xSbxTe3-ySey paved a pathway toward practical device application of TIs.\nFor realizing TI-based devices, it is necessary to contact TIs with a metal.\nSince the band-bending at the interface dominates the character of devices,\nknowledge of TIs' work function is of essential importance. We have determined\nthe compositional dependence of work function in Bi2-xSbxTe3-ySey by\nhigh-resolution photoemission spectroscopy. The obtained work-function values\n(4.95-5.20 eV) show a systematic variation with the composition, well tracking\nthe energy shift of the surface chemical potential seen by angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy. The present result serves as a useful guide for\ndeveloping TI-based electronic devices.\n", "  The study presented in this paper has shown that the generation of hard x\nrays and high-energy ions, which are detected in pinch implosion experiments,\nmay be associated with the Coulomb explosion of the hot spot that is formed due\nto the outflow of the material from the pinch cross point. During the process\nof material outflow, the temperature of the hot spot plasma increases, and\nconditions arise for the plasma electrons to become continuously accelerated.\nThe runaway of electrons from the hot spot region results in the buildup of\npositive space charge in this region followed by a Coulomb explosion. The\nconditions for the hot spot plasma electrons to become continuously accelerated\nhave been revealed and estimates have been obtained for the kinetic energy of\nthe ions generated by the Coulomb explosion.\n", "  We have performed angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy on HfSiS, which\nhas been predicted to be a topological line-node semimetal with square Si\nlattice. We found a quasi-two-dimensional Fermi surface hosting bulk nodal\nlines, alongside the surface states at the Brillouin-zone corner exhibiting a\nsizable Rashba splitting and band-mass renormalization due to many-body\ninteractions. Most notably, we discovered an unexpected Dirac-like dispersion\nextending one-dimensionally in k space - the Dirac-node arc - near the bulk\nnode at the zone diagonal. These novel Dirac states reside on the surface and\ncould be related to hybridizations of bulk states, but currently we have no\nexplanation for its origin. This discovery poses an intriguing challenge to the\ntheoretical understanding of topological line-node semimetals.\n", "  Event-Shape Engineering (ESE) is a tool that enables some control of the\ninitial geometry in heavy-ion collisions in a similar way as the centrality\nenables some control of the number of participants. Utilizing ESE, the path\nlength in and out-of plane can be varied while keeping the medium properties\n(centrality) fixed. In this proceeding it is argued that this provides\nadditional experimental information about jet quenching. Finally, it is\nsuggested that if ESE studies are done in parallel for light and heavy quarks\none can determine, in a model independent way, if the path-length dependence of\ntheir quenching differs.\n", "  In this article we investigate a conformal extension of the standard model in\nwhich the scalar sector consists of a standard model Higgs doublet, a real\ngauge singlet and a real $SU(2)_{L}$ triplet. Focusing on the scenario where\nthe Higgs boson found at the LHC is identified as the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone\nboson of broken scale invariance, various theoretical and phenomenological\nfeatures of the model are discussed. In particular, we analyze the decay\npattern of the new scalar resonance. We also show that when the mass of this\nnew scalar resonance is far below the $WW$ threshold, the natural regions of\nthe parameter space are reduced by a constraint associated with the symmetry\nenhancement due to the decoupling of the singlet scalar from the rest of the\nsystem.\n", "  The group theoretic construction is applied to construct a novel dynamical\nrealization of the $l$--conformal Galilei group in terms of geodesic equations\non the coset space. A peculiar feature of the geodesics is that all their\nintegrals of motion, including the accelerations, are functionally independent.\nThe analysis in the recent work [Phys. Lett. B 754 (2016) 249] is extended to\nconstruct the Einstein metrics with the $l$--conformal Galilei isometry group.\n", "  $ $The critical current of a Josephson junction is an oscillatory function of\nthe enclosed magnetic flux $\\Phi$, because of quantum interference modulated\nwith periodicity $h/2e$. We calculate these Fraunhofer oscillations in a\ntwo-dimensional (2D) ballistic superconductor--normal-metal--superconductor\n(SNS) junction. For a Fermi circle the amplitude of the oscillations decays as\n$1/\\Phi$ or faster. If the Fermi circle is strongly warped, as it is on a\nsquare lattice near the band center, we find that the amplitude decays slower\n$\\propto 1/\\sqrt\\Phi$ when the magnetic length $l_m=\\sqrt{\\hbar/eB}$ drops\nbelow the separation $L$ of the NS interfaces. The crossover to the slow decay\nof the critical current is accompanied by the appearance of a 2D array of\ncurrent vortices and antivortices in the normal region, which form a bipartite\nrectangular lattice with lattice constant $\\simeq l_m^2/L$. The 2D lattice\nvanishes for a circular Fermi surface, when only the usual single row of\nJosephson vortices remains.\n", "  Properties of distributed chaos in superfluid (quantum) turbulence have been\nstudied using the data of recent direct numerical simulations (HVBK two-fluid\nmodel for He II, and a moving grid in the frames of Gross-Pitaevskii model of\nthe Bose-Einstein condensates at low temperatures). It is found that for the\nviscous (normal) component of the velocity field in He II the viscosity\ndominates the distributed chaos with the stretched exponential spectrum\n$\\exp(-k/k_{\\beta})^{\\beta}$ and $\\beta = 2/3$. For the superfluid component\nthe distributed chaos is dominated by the vorticity correlation integral with\n$\\beta =1/2$ (the soft spontaneous breaking of the space translational symmetry\n- homogeneity). For very low temperature the distributed chaos is tuned to the\nlarge-scale coherent motions: the viscous (normal) component is tuned to the\nfundamental mode, whereas the superfluid component is subharmonically tuned.\nFor the Gross-Pitaevskii superfluid turbulence incompressible part of the\nenergy spectrum (containing the vortices contribution) also indicates the\ndistributed chaos dominated by the vorticity correlation integral ($\\beta\n=1/2$) and the subharmonic tuning to the large-scale coherent motions.\n", "  A previous study of correlations between element abundance ratios, [X/Fe],\nand ages of solar twin stars is extended to include Sc, Mn, Cu, and Ba. HARPS\nspectra with S/N > 600 are used to derive very precise (+/- 0.01 dex)\ndifferential abundances, and stellar ages with internal errors less than 1 Gyr\nare obtained by interpolation in the logg - Teff diagram between isochrones\ncalculated with the Aarhus Stellar Evolution Code. For stars younger than 6\nGyr, [X/Fe] is tightly correlated with stellar age for all elements. For ages\nbetween 6 and 9 Gyr, the [X/Fe] - age correlations break down and the stars\nsplit up into two groups having respectively high and low [X/Fe] for the odd-Z\nelements. It is concluded that while stars in the solar neighborhood younger\nthan about 6 Gyr were formed from interstellar gas with a smooth chemical\nevolution, older stars have originated from regions enriched by supernovae with\ndifferent neutron excesses. Furthermore, the correlations between abundance\nratios and stellar age suggest that: i) Sc is made in Type II supernovae along\nwith the alpha-capture elements, ii) the Type II to Ia SNe yield ratio is about\nthe same for Mn and Fe, iii) Cu is mainly made by the weak s-process in massive\nstars, iv) the Ba/Y yield ratio for AGB stars increases with decreasing stellar\nmass, v) [Y/Mg] and [Y/Al] can be used as \"chemical clocks\" when determining\nages of solar metallicity stars.\n", "  Hubble Space Telescope observations of active asteroid 324P/La Sagra near\nperihelion show continued mass loss consistent with the sublimation of\nnear-surface ice. Isophotes of the coma measured from a vantage point below the\norbital plane are best matched by steady emission of particles having a nominal\nsize $a \\sim$ 100 $\\mu$m. The inferred rate of mass loss, $dM_d/dt \\sim$0.2 kg\ns$^{-1}$, can be supplied by sublimation of water ice in thermal equilibrium\nwith sunlight from an area as small as 930 m$^2$, corresponding to about 0.2\\%\nof the nucleus surface. Observations taken from a vantage point only\n0.6\\degr~from the orbital plane of 324P set a limit to the velocity of ejection\nof dust in the direction perpendicular to the plane, $V_{\\perp} <$ 1 m\ns$^{-1}$. Short-term photometric variations of the near-nucleus region, if\nrelated to rotation of the underlying nucleus, rule out periods $\\le$ 3.8 hr\nand suggest that rotation probably does not play a central role in driving the\nobserved mass loss. We estimate that, in the previous orbit, 324P lost about\n4$\\times$10$^7$ kg in dust particles, corresponding to 6$\\times$10$^{-5}$ of\nthe mass of a 550 m spherical nucleus of assumed density $\\rho$ = 1000 kg\nm$^{-3}$. If continued, mass loss at this rate would limit the lifetime of 324P\nto $\\sim$1.6$\\times$10$^4$ orbits (about 10$^5$ yr). To survive for the 100 Myr\nto 400 Myr timescales corresponding, respectively, to dynamical and collisional\nstability requires a duty cycle $2\\times 10^{-4} \\le f_d \\le 8\\times 10^{-4}$.\nUnless its time in orbit is over-estimated by many orders of magnitude, 324P is\nrevealed as a briefly-active member of a vast population of otherwise dormant\nice-containing asteroids.\n", "  The fractionalization of elementary excitations in quantum spin systems is a\ncentral theme in current condensed matter physics. The Kitaev honeycomb spin\nmodel provides a prominent example of exotic fractionalized quasiparticles,\ncomposed of itinerant Majorana fermions and gapped gauge fluxes. However,\nidentification of the Majorana fermions in a three-dimensional honeycomb\nlattice remains elusive. Here we report spectroscopic signatures of fractional\nexcitations in the harmonic-honeycomb iridates $\\beta$- and\n$\\gamma$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$. Using polarization resolved Raman spectroscopy, we find\nthat the dynamical Raman response of $\\beta$- and $\\gamma$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$\nfeatures a broad scattering continuum with distinct polarization and\ncomposition dependence. The temperature dependence of the Raman spectral weight\nis dominated by the thermal damping of fermionic excitations. These results\nsuggest the emergence of Majorana fermions from spin fractionalization in a\nthree-dimensional Kitaev-Heisenberg system.\n", "  We compute the transverse single spin asymmetry in light hadron production\n$p^\\uparrow p\\to hX$ and $p^\\uparrow A\\to hX$ including the gluon saturation\neffect in the unpolarized nucleon/nucleus. In the forward (large-$x_F$) region,\nthe dominant contribution comes from the so-called derivative term associated\nwith the soft gluonic pole. This leads to the cancellation of nuclear effects\nin $A_N$ which can be tested at RHIC. We also show that the soft fermionic pole\ndisappears in the saturation environment.\n", "  We study the dynamics of superposed nonlinear waves in coherently coupled\nGross-Pitaevskii (CCGP) equations with constant (autonomous system) and time\nvarying (non-autonomous system) nonlinearity co-efficients. By employing a\nlinear transformation, the autonomous CCGP system is converted into two\nseparate scalar nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equations and we show that linear\nsuperposition of different nonlinear wave solutions of these scalar equations\nresults into several kinds of nonlinear coherent structures namely, coexisting\nrogue wave-Ma breather, Akhmediev-Ma breathers, collision and bound states of\nMa breathers and solitons. Next, the non-autonomous CCGP system is converted\ninto an autonomous CCGP system with a similarity transformation. We show an\ninteresting possibility of soliton compression and appearance of creeping\nsolitons for kink-like and periodically modulated nonlinearity coefficient.\n", "  We discuss different $\\rm SU(5)$ low-energy realizations and illustrate their\nuse with the diphoton excess and Higgs flavor violation, which require new\nphysics at the TeV scale. In particular, we study two scenarios for a $750$ GeV\nresonance: in the first one the resonance belongs to the adjoint of $\\rm\nSU(5)$, being either an $\\rm SU(2)_L$ singlet or a triplet, while in the second\ncase the signal is due to the CP-even and CP-odd states of a new $\\rm SU(2)_L$\nHiggs doublet belonging to a ${\\bf 45}_H$ or a ${\\bf 70}_H$ representations,\ngiving rise to a two-Higgs doublet model at low energies. We study the\nfine-tuning needed for the desired members of the multiplets to be light\nenough, while having the rest at the GUT scale. In these scenarios, the\nproduction and decay into photons of the new resonance are mediated by the\nleptoquarks (LQ) present in these large $\\rm SU(5)$ representations. We analyse\nthe phenomenology of such scenarios, focusing on the most relevant predictions\nthat can help to disentangle the different models, like decays into gauge\nbosons, Standard Model (SM) fermions and LQs pair production. In the case of\nthe ${\\bf 45}_H$ (the Georgi-Jarlskog model), we also study the possibility to\nhave Higgs flavor violation. We find that $B_s$ mixing limits (in addition to\n$\\tau\\rightarrow \\mu \\gamma$) always imply that $\\rm{BR}(h\\rightarrow\n\\tau\\mu,\\,bs)\\lesssim 10^{-5}$.\n", "  Particle number fluctuations, no matter how small, are present in\nexperimental set-ups. One should rigorously take these fluctuations into\naccount, especially, for entanglement detection. In this context, we generalize\nthe spin squeezing inequalities introduced by T\\'oth et al. in Phys. Rev. Lett.\n99, 250405 (2007). These new inequalities are fulfilled by all separable states\neven when the number of particle is not constant, and may present quantum\nfluctuations. These inequalities are useful for detecting entanglement in\nmany-body systems when the super-selection rule does not apply, or when only a\nsubspace of the total systems Hilbert space is considered. We also define\ngeneral dichotomic observables for which we obtain a coordinate independent\nform of the generalized spin squeezing inequalities. We give an example where\nour generalized coordinate independent spin squeezing inequalities present a\nclear advantage over the original ones.\n", "  We show that scattering amplitudes in planar N = 4 Super Yang-Mills in\nmulti-Regge kinematics can naturally be expressed in terms of single-valued\niterated integrals on the moduli space of Riemann spheres with marked points.\nAs a consequence, scattering amplitudes in this limit can be expressed as\nconvolutions that can easily be computed using Stokes' theorem. We apply this\nframework to MHV amplitudes to leading-logarithmic accuracy (LLA), and we prove\nthat at L loops all MHV amplitudes are determined by amplitudes with up to L +\n4 external legs. We also investigate non-MHV amplitudes, and we show that they\ncan be obtained by convoluting the MHV results with a certain helicity flip\nkernel. We classify all leading singularities that appear at LLA in the Regge\nlimit for arbitrary helicity configurations and any number of external legs.\nFinally, we use our new framework to obtain explicit analytic results at LLA\nfor all MHV amplitudes up to five loops and all non-MHV amplitudes with up to\neight external legs and four loops.\n", "  We study the properties of the avoided or hidden quantum critical point\n(AQCP) in three dimensional Dirac and Weyl semi-metals in the presence of short\nrange potential disorder. By computing the averaged density of states (along\nwith its second and fourth derivative at zero energy) with the kernel\npolynomial method (KPM) we systematically tune the effective length scale that\neventually rounds out the transition and leads to an AQCP. We show how to\ndetermine the strength of the avoidance, establishing that it is not controlled\nby the long wavelength component of the disorder. Instead, the amount of\navoidance can be adjusted via the tails of the probability distribution of the\nlocal random potentials. A binary distribution with no tails produces much less\navoidance than a Gaussian distribution. We introduce a double Gaussian\ndistribution to interpolate between these two limits. As a result we are able\nto make the length scale of the avoidance sufficiently large so that we can\naccurately study the properties of the underlying transition (that is\neventually rounded out), unambiguously identify its location, and provide\naccurate estimates of the critical exponents $\\nu=1.01\\pm0.06$ and\n$z=1.50\\pm0.04$. We also show that the KPM expansion order introduces an\neffective length scale that can also round out the transition in the scaling\nregime near the AQCP.\n", "  A stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) will affect the CMB\nanisotropies via weak lensing. Unlike weak lensing due to large scale structure\nwhich only deflects photon trajectories, a SGWB has an additional effect of\nrotating the polarization vector along the trajectory. We study the relative\nimportance of these two effects, deflection \\& rotation, specifically in the\ncontext of E-mode to B-mode power transfer caused by weak lensing due to SGWB.\nUsing weak lensing distortion of the CMB as a probe, we derive constraints on\nthe spectral energy density ($\\Omega_{GW}$) of the SGWB, sourced at different\nredshifts, without assuming any particular model for its origin. We present\nthese bounds on $\\Omega_{GW}$ for different power-law models characterizing the\nSGWB, indicating the threshold above which observable imprints of SGWB must be\npresent in CMB.\n", "  We propose a general theory to describe the distribution of protein-folding\ntransition paths. We show that transition paths follow a predictable sequence\nof high-free-energy transient states that are separated by free-energy\nbarriers. Each transient state corresponds to the assembly of one or more\ndiscrete, cooperative units, which are determined directly from the native\nstructure. We show that the transition state on a folding pathway is reached\nwhen a small number of critical contacts are formed between a specific set of\nsubstructures, after which folding proceeds downhill in free energy. This\napproach suggests a natural resolution for distinguishing parallel folding\npathways and provides a simple means to predict the rate-limiting step in a\nfolding reaction. Our theory identifies a common folding mechanism for proteins\nwith diverse native structures and establishes general principles for the\nself-assembly of polymers with specific interactions.\n", "  One of the fundamental questions of theoretical cosmology is whether the\nuniverse can undergo a non-singular bounce, i.e., smoothly transit from a\nperiod of contraction to a period of expansion through violation of the null\nenergy condition (NEC) at energies well below the Planck scale and at finite\nvalues of the scale factor such that the entire evolution remains classical. A\ncommon claim has been that a non-singular bounce either leads to ghost or\ngradient instabilities or a cosmological singularity. In this letter, we\nexamine cubic Galileon theories and present a procedure for explicitly\nconstructing examples of a non-singular cosmological bounce without\nencountering any pathologies and maintaining a sub-luminal sound speed for\nco-moving curvature modes throughout the NEC violating phase. We also discuss\nthe relation between our procedure and earlier work.\n", "  In this paper, we study a physical system that is composed of massive charged\nscalar field linearly coupled to a charged rotating Kerr-Newman black hole.\nGiven the parameters of black hole and a specific set of \"quantum\" numbers, the\nparameter space of the scalar field, which is a plane spanned by its mass and\ncharge, is divided into five partitions by three simple constraint lines and\nthe existence line of scalar clouds. The physical properties of the system in\nthese partitions are presented. It is found that superradiant instability may\nbe possibly caused only in two of the partitions. In particular, it is shown\nthat both the mass and charge of the scalar clouds are bounded in a limited\nregion. Our results may be used to rapidly judge the possible occurrence of\nsuperradiant instability and the existence of scalar clouds around a given\nblack hole.\n", "  In this work, we present the new catalog of carbon stars from the LAMOST DR2\ncatalog. In total, 894 carbon stars are identified from multiple line indices\nmeasured from the stellar spectra. Combining the CN bands in the red end with\n\\ctwo\\ and other lines, we are able to identify the carbon stars. Moreover, we\nalso classify the carbon stars into spectral sub-types of \\ch, \\CR, and \\cn.\nThese sub-types approximately show distinct features in the multi-dimensional\nline indices, implying that in the future we can use them to identify carbon\nstars from larger spectroscopic datasets. Meanwhile, from the line indices\nspace, while the \\cn\\ stars are clearly separated from the others, we find no\nclear separation between \\CR\\ and \\ch\\ sub-types. The \\CR\\ and \\ch\\ stars seem\nto smoothly transition from one to another. This may hint that the \\CR\\ and\n\\ch\\ stars may not be different in their origins but look different in their\nspectra because of different metallicity. Due to the relatively low spectral\nresolution and lower signal-to-noise ratio, the ratio of $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C is\nnot measured and thus the \\cj\\ stars are not identified.\n", "  Supernova (SN) 2015bh (or SNhunt275) was discovered in NGC 2770 on 2015\nFebruary with an absolute magnitude of Mr ~ -13.4 mag, and was initially\nclassified as a SN impostor. Here we present the photometric and spectroscopic\nevolution of SN 2015bh from discovery to late phases (~ 1 yr after). In\naddition, we inspect archival images of the host galaxy up to ~ 21 yr before\ndiscovery, finding a burst ~ 1 yr before discovery, and further signatures of\nstellar instability until late 2014. Later on, the luminosity of the transient\nslowly increases, and a broad light curve peak is reached after about three\nmonths. We propose that the transient discovered in early 2015 could be a\ncore-collapse SN explosion. The pre-SN luminosity variability history, the\nlong-lasting rise and faintness first light curve peak suggests that the\nprogenitor was a very massive, unstable and blue star, which exploded as a\nfaint SN because of severe fallback of material. Later on, the object\nexperiences a sudden brightening of 3 mag, which results from the interaction\nof the SN ejecta with circumstellar material formed through repeated past\nmass-loss events. Spectroscopic signatures of interaction are however visible\nat all epochs. A similar chain of events was previously proposed for the\nsimilar interacting SN 2009ip.\n", "  We present an apparatus that converts every pulse of a pulsed light source to\na pulse train in which the intensities of the different pulses are samples of\nthe spatial or temporal frequency spectrum of the original pulse. In this way,\nthe spectrum of the incident light can be measured by following the temporal\nresponse of a single detector. The apparatus is based on multiple round-trips\ninside a 2f- cavity-like mirror arrangement in which the spectrum is spread on\nthe back focal plane, where after each round-trip a small section of the\nspectrum is allowed to escape. The apparatus is fibre-free, offers easy\nwavelength range tunability, and a prototype built achieves over 10% average\nefficiency in the near infra red. We demonstrate the application of the\nprototype for the efficient measurement of the joint spectrum of a\nnon-degenerate bi-photon source in which one of the photons is in the near\ninfra red.\n", "  Approximations to the many-fermion free energy density functional that\ninclude the Thomas-Fermi (TF) form for the non-interacting part lead to\nsingular densities for singular external potentials (e.g. attractive Coulomb).\nThis limitation of the TF approximation is addressed here by a formal map of\nthe exact Euler equation for the density onto an equivalent TF form\ncharacterized by a modified Kohn-Sham potential. It is shown to be a\n\"regularized\" version of the Kohn-Sham potential, tempered by convolution with\na finite-temperature response function. The resulting density is non-singular,\nwith the equilibrium properties obtained from the total free energy functional\nevaluated at this density. This new representation is formally exact.\nApproximate expressions for the regularized potential are given to leading\norder in a non-locality parameter and the limiting behavior at high and low\ntemperatures is described. The non-interacting part of the free energy in this\napproximation is the usual Thomas-Fermi functional. These results generalize\nand extend to finite temperatures the ground-state regularization by Parr and\nGhosh (Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 83, 3577 (1986)) and by Pratt, Hoffman, and Harris\n(J. Chem. Phys. 92, 1818 (1988)) and formally systematize the\nfinite-temperature regularization given by the latter authors.\n", "  Super Earths are the largest population of exoplanets and are seen to exhibit\na rich diversity of compositions as inferred through their mean densities. Here\nwe present a model that combines equilibrium chemistry in evolving disks with\ncore accretion that tracks materials accreted onto planets during their\nformation. In doing so, we aim to explain why super Earths form so frequently\nand how they acquire such a diverse range of compositions. A key feature of our\nmodel is disk inhomogeneities, or planet traps, that act as barriers to rapid\ntype-I migration. The traps we include are the dead zone, which can be caused\nby either cosmic ray or X-ray ionization, the ice line, and the heat\ntransition. We find that in disks with sufficiently long lifetimes ($\\gtrsim$ 4\nMyr), all traps produce Jovian planets. In these disks, planet formation in the\nheat transition and X-ray dead zone produces hot Jupiters while the ice line\nand cosmic ray dead zones produce Jupiters at roughly 1 AU. Super Earth\nformation takes place within short-lived disks ($\\lesssim$ 2 Myr), whereby the\ndisks are photoevaporated while planets are in a slow phase of gas accretion.\nWe find that super Earth compositions range from dry and rocky ($<$ 6 % ice by\nmass) to those with substantial water contents ($>$ 30 % ice by mass). The\ntraps play a crucial role in our results, as they dictate where in the disk\nparticular planets can accrete from, and what compositions they are able to\nacquire.\n", "  Superparamagnetic tunnel junctions are nanostructures that auto-oscillate\nstochastically under the effect of thermal noise. Recent works showed that\ndespite their stochasticity, such junctions possess a capability to synchronize\nto subthreshold voltage drives, in a way that can be enhanced or controlled by\nadding noise. In this work, we investigate a system composed of two\nelectrically coupled junctions, connected in series to a periodic voltage\nsource. We make use of numerical simulations and of an analytical model to\ndemonstrate that both junctions can be phase-locked to the drive, in phase or\nin anti-phase. This synchronization phenomenon can be controlled by both\nthermal and electrical noises, although the two types of noises induce\nqualitatively different behaviors. Namely, thermal noise can stabilize a regime\nwhere one junction is phase-locked to the drive voltage while the other is\nblocked in one state. On the contrary, electrical noise causes the junctions to\nhave highly correlated behaviors and thus cannot induce the latter. These\nresults open the way for the design of superparamagnetic tunnel junctions that\ncan perform computation through synchronization, and which harvest the largest\npart of their energy consumption from thermal noise.\n", "  We report the first measurement of the odd-isotope fractions for barium,\n\\fodd\\, in two extremely metal-poor stars: a CEMP-r/s star \\he\\\n(\\feh\\,$=-2.42\\pm0.11$) and an r-II star \\cs\\ (\\feh\\,$=-2.90\\pm0.13$). The\nmeasured \\fodd\\ values are $0.23\\pm0.12$ corresponding to $34.3\\pm34.3$\\% of\nthe r-process contributions for \\he\\ and $0.43\\pm0.09$ corresponding to\n$91.4\\pm25.7$\\% of the r-process contribution to Ba production for \\cs. The\nhigh r-process signature of barium in \\cs\\ ($91.4\\pm25.7\\%$) suggests that the\nmajority of the heavy elements in this star were synthesised via an r-process\npath, while the lower r-process value ($34.3\\pm34.3\\%$) found in \\he\\ indicates\nthat the heavy elements in this star formed through a mix of s-process and\nr-process synthesis. These conclusions are consistent with studies based on AGB\nmodel calculations to fit their abundance distributions.\n", "  We investigate the influence of dissipation and decoherence on quantum\nDarwinism by generalizing Zurek's original qubit model of decoherence and the\nestablishment of pointer states (Zurek, Nature Physics 5, 181 - 188 (2009)).\nOur model allows for repeated multiple qubit-qubit couplings between system and\nenvironment which are described by randomly applied two-qubit quantum\noperations inducing entanglement, dissipation and dephasing. The resulting\nstationary qubit states of system and environment are investigated. They\nexhibit the intricate influence of entanglement generation, dissipation and\ndephasing on this characteristic quantum phenomenon.\n", "  We employ leading order covariant chiral perturbation theory to compute the\nnucleon-pion-state contribution to the 3-point correlation functions one\ntypically measures in lattice QCD to extract the isovector nucleon charges\n$g_A,g_T$ and $g_S$. We estimate the impact of the nucleon-pion-state\ncontribution on both the plateau and the summation method for lattice\nsimulations with physical pion masses. The nucleon-pion-state contribution\nresults in an overestimation of all charges with both methods. The\noverestimation is roughly equal for the axial and the tensor charge, and about\nfifty percent larger for the scalar charge.\n", "  Measurements of the jet activity in $t\\bar{t}$ events produced in\nproton--proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV are presented, using\n$20.3\\,$fb$^{-1}$ of data collected by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron\nCollider. The events were selected in the dilepton $e\\mu$ decay channel with\ntwo identified $b$-jets. The numbers of additional jets for various jet\ntransverse momentum ($p_T$) thresholds, and the normalised differential\ncross-sections as a function of $p_T$ for the five highest-$p_T$ additional\njets, were measured in the jet pseudorapidity range $|\\eta|<4.5$. The gap\nfraction, the fraction of events which do not contain an additional jet in a\ncentral rapidity region, was measured for several rapidity intervals as a\nfunction of the minimum $p_T$ of a single jet or the scalar sum of $p_T$ of all\nadditional jets. These fractions were also measured in different regions of the\ninvariant mass of the $e\\mu b\\bar{b}$ system. All measurements were corrected\nfor detector effects, and found to be mostly well-described by predictions from\nnext-to-leading-order and leading-order $t\\bar{t}$ event generators with\nappropriate parameter choices. The results can be used to further optimise the\nparameters used in such generators.\n", "  We report a femtosecond optical parametric oscillator (OPO) based on the new\nsemiconductor gain material orientation patterned gallium phosphide (OP-GaP),\nwhich enables the production of high-repetition-rate femtosecond pulses\nspanning 5-12 \\mu m with average powers in the few to tens of milliwatts range.\nThis is the first example of a broadband OPO operating across the molecular\nfingerprint region, and we demonstrate its potential by conducting broadband\nFourier-transform spectroscopy using water vapor and a polystyrene reference\nstandard.\n", "  Recently, two-photon six-qubit hyperentangled states were produced in\nexperiment and they can improve the channel capacity of quantum communication\nlargely. Here we present a scheme for the hyperentanglement purification of\nnonlocal two-photon systems in three degrees of freedom (DOFs), including the\npolarization, the first-longitudinal-momentum, and the second longitudinal\nmomentum DOFs. Our hyperentanglement purification protocol (hyper-EPP) is\nconstructed with two steps resorting to parity-check quantum nondemolition\nmeasurement on the three DOFs and SWAP gates, respectively. With these two\nsteps, the bit-flip errors in the three DOFs can be corrected efficiently.\nAlso, we show that using SWAP gates is a universal method for hyper-EPP in the\npolarization DOF and multiple longitudinal momentum DOFs. The implementation of\nour hyper-EPP is assisted by nitrogen-vacancy centers in optical microcavities,\nwhich could be achieved with current techniques. It is useful for long-distance\nhigh-capacity quantum communication with two-photon six-qubit\nhyperentanglement.\n", "  In recent experiments, the relaxation dynamics of highly oblate, turbulent\nBose-Einstein condensates (BECs) was investigated by measuring the vortex decay\nrates in various sample conditions [Phys. Rev. A $\\bf 90$, 063627 (2014)] and,\nseparately, the thermal friction coefficient $\\alpha$ for vortex motion was\nmeasured from the long-time evolution of a corotating vortex pair in a BEC\n[Phys. Rev. A $\\bf 92$, 051601(R) (2015)]. We present a comparative analysis of\nthe experimental results, and find that the vortex decay rate $\\Gamma$ is\nalmost linearly proportional to $\\alpha$. We perform numerical simulations of\nthe time evolution of a turbulent BEC using a point-vortex model equipped with\nlongitudinal friction and vortex-antivortex pair annihilation, and observe that\nthe linear dependence of $\\Gamma$ on $\\alpha$ is quantitatively accounted for\nin the dissipative point-vortex model. The numerical simulations reveal that\nthermal friction in the experiment was too strong to allow for the emergence of\na vortex-clustered state out of decaying turbulence.\n", "  The Lamb shift (self-energy) of an elliptic dielectric microcavity is\nstudied. We show that the size of the Lamb shift, which is a small energy shift\ndue to the system-environment coupling in the quantum regime, is dependent on\nthe geometry of the boundary conditions. It shows a global transition depending\non the eccentricity of the ellipsis. These transitions can be classified into\nthree types of decay channels known as whispering-gallery modes,\nstable-bouncing-ball modes, and unstable-bouncing-ball modes. These modes are\nmanifested through the Poincar\\'{e} surface of section with the Husimi\ndistribution function in classical phase space. It is found that the similarity\n(measured in Bhattacharyya distance) between the Husimi distributions below\ncritical lines of two different modes increases as the difference of their\nself-energies decreases when the quality factors of the modes are on the same\norder of magnitude.\n", "  A theoretical study on how synchronization and resonance-like phenomena in\nsuperparamagnetic tunnel junctions can be driven by spin-transfer torques is\npresented. We examine the magnetization of a superparamagnetic free layer that\nreverses randomly between two well-defined orientations due to thermal\nfluctuations, acting as a stochastic oscillator. When subject to an external ac\nforcing this system can present stochastic resonance and noise-enhanced\nsynchronization. We focus on the roles of the mutually perpendicular\ndamping-like and field-like torques, showing that the response of the system is\nvery different at low and high-frequencies. We also demonstrate that the\nfield-like torque can increase the efficiency of the current-driven forcing,\nspecially at sub-threshold electric currents. These results can be useful for\npossible low-power, more energy efficient, applications.\n", "  Motivated by the structure of certain modules over the loop Virasoro Lie\nconformal algebra and the Lie structures of Schrodinger-Virasoro algebras, we\nconstruct a class of infinite rank Lie conformal algebras CSV (a, b), where a,\nb are complex numbers. The conformal derivations of CSV (a, b) are uniformly\ndetermined. The rank one conformal modules and Z-graded free intermediate\nseries modules over CSV (a, b) are classified. Corresponding results of the\nconformal subalgebra CHV (a, b) of CSV (a, b) are also presented.\n", "  Translationally diffusive behavior arising from the combination of\norientational diffusion and powered motion at microscopic scales is a known\nphenomenon, but the peculiarities of the evolution of expected position\nconditioned on initial position and orientation have been neglected. A theory\nis given of the spiral motion of the mean trajectory depending upon propulsion\nspeed, angular velocity, orientational diffusion and rate of random chirality\nreversal. We demonstrate the experimental accessibility of this effect using\nboth tadpole-like and Janus sphere dimer rotating motors. Sensitivity of the\nmean trajectory to the kinematic parameters suggest that it may be a useful way\nto determine those parameters.\n", "  We use the SDSS/SEGUE spectroscopic sample of stars in the leading and\ntrailing streams of the Sagittarius (Sgr) to demonstrate the existence of two\nsub-populations with distinct chemistry and kinematics. The metallicity\ndistribution function (MDF) of the trailing stream is decomposed into two\nGaussians describing a metal-rich sub-population with means and dispersions\n(-0.74, 0.18) dex and a metal-poor with (-1.33, 0.27) dex. The metal-rich\nsub-population has a velocity dispersion ~ 8 km/s, whilst the metal-poor is\nnearly twice as hot ~13 km/s. For the leading stream, the MDF is again\nwell-described by a superposition of two Gaussians, though somewhat shifted as\ncompared to the trailing stream. The metal-rich has mean and dispersion (-1.00,\n0.34) dex, the metal-poor (-1.39, 0.22) dex. The velocity dispersions are\ninflated by projection effects to give 15 - 30 km/s for the metal-poor, and 6 -\n20 km/s for the metal-rich, depending on longitude. We infer that, like many\ndwarf spheroidals, the Sgr progenitor possessed a more extended, metal-poor\nstellar component and less extended, metal-rich one. We study the implications\nof this result for the progenitor mass by simulating the disruption of the Sgr,\nrepresented as King light profiles in dark halos of masses between $10^{10}$\nand $10^{11} M_\\odot$, in a three-component Milky Way whose halo is a live\nTruncated Flat potential in the first phase of accretion and a triaxial Law \\&\nMajewski model in the second phase. We show that that the dark halo of the Sgr\nmust have been $\\gtrsim 6 \\times 10^{10} M_\\odot$ to reproduce the run of\nvelocity dispersion with longitude for the metal-rich and metal-poor\nsub-populations in the tails.\n", "  Key properties of the cuprates, such as the pseudogap observed above the\ncritical temperature $T_c$, remain highly debated. Given their importance, we\nrecently proposed a novel mechanism based on the Bose-like condensation of\nmutually interacting Cooper pairs [W. Sacks, A. Mauger, Y. Noat, Superconduct.\nSci. Technol. 28 105014, (2015)]. In this work, we calculate the temperature\ndependent DOS using this model for different doping levels from underdoped to\noverdoped. In all situations, due to the presence of excited pairs, a pseudogap\nis found above $T_c$ while the normal DOS is recovered at $T^*$, the pair\nformation temperature. A similar behavior is found as a function of magnetic\nfield, crossing a vortex, where a pseudogap exists in the vortex core. We show\nthat the precise DOS shape depends on combined pair (boson) and quasiparticle\n(fermion) excitations, allowing for a deeper understanding of the SC to the PG\ntransition.\n", "  Motivated by the recent realization of the three-dimensional hyperhoneycomb\nand stripyhoneycomb lattices in lithium iridate (Li$_2$IrO$_3$), we study the\npossible spin-singlet superconducting states on the whole series of harmonic\nhoneycomb lattices. Beginning with an isolated out-of-plane twist making the\nhoneycomb lattice three-dimensional, we find that the chiral d$\\pm$id state,\nwell-known from the honeycomb lattice, is realized in the largest members of\nthe series at low to intermediate doping. Along the twist, four chiral edge\nstates form a two-dimensional dispersive band. Reducing the distance between\nthe twists to form the smaller members of the harmonic honeycomb lattices, the\ndegeneracy between the d-wave states is lifted, which finally destroys the\nchiral state. By analyzing the hyper- and stripyhoneycomb lattices and\ngeneralizing using the $D_{2h}$ point group of all the harmonic honeycomb\nlattices, we show that the superconducting state often belongs to the trivial\nirreducible representation. This state has nodal lines at low to intermediate\ndoping, which is possible because the full lattice symmetry allows sign changes\nbetween different sets of bonds. We also find time-reversal symmetry broken\nstates, which are either fully gapped or feature nodal points, in certain parts\nof the phase diagram. Finally, we draw a comparison between the states\nclassified in terms of the $D_{2h}$ symmetries and those observed on the\n$D_{6h}$ honeycomb lattice.\n", "  We present a parallel derivation of the Thouless-Anderson-Palmer (TAP)\nequations and of an effective potential for the negative perceptron and soft\nsphere models in high dimension. Both models are continuous constrained\nsatisfaction problems with a critical jamming transition characterized by the\nsame exponents. Our analysis reveals that a power expansion of the potential up\nto the second order represents a successful framework to approach the jamming\nline from the SAT phase (the region of the phase diagram where at least one\nconfiguration verifies all the constraints), where the ground-state energy is\nzero. An interesting outcome is that close to jamming the effective\nthermodynamic potential has a logarithmic contribution, which turns out to be\ndominant in a proper scaling regime. Our approach is quite general and can be\ndirectly applied to other interesting models. Finally, we study the spectrum of\nsmall harmonic fluctuations in the SAT phase recovering the typical scaling\n$D(\\omega) \\sim \\omega^2$ below the cutoff frequency but a different behavior\ncharacterized by a non-trivial exponent above it.\n", "  We present the optical and mechanical design of a mechanically compliant\nquasi-two-dimensional photonic crystal cavity formed from thin-film silicon in\nwhich a pair of linear nanoscale slots are used to create two coupled high-$Q$\noptical resonances. The optical cavity supermodes, whose frequencies are\ndesigned to lie in the $1500$~nm wavelength band, are shown to interact\nstrongly with mechanical resonances of the structure whose frequencies range\nfrom a few MHz to a few GHz. Depending upon the symmetry of the mechanical\nmodes and the symmetry of the slot sizes, we show that the optomechanical\ncoupling between the optical supermodes can be either linear or quadratic in\nthe mechanical displacement amplitude. Tuning of the nanoscale slot size is\nalso shown to adjust the magnitude and sign of the cavity supermode splitting\n$2J$, enabling near-resonant motional scattering between the two optical\nsupermodes and greatly enhancing the $x^2$-coupling strength. Specifically, for\nthe fundamental flexural mode of the central nanobeam of the structure at\n$10$~MHz the per-phonon linear cross-mode coupling rate is calculated to be\n$\\tilde{g}_{+-}/2\\pi = 1$~MHz, corresponding to a per-phonon $x^2$-coupling\nrate of $\\tilde{g}'/2\\pi=1$~kHz for a mode splitting $2J/2\\pi = 1$~GHz which is\ngreater than the radiation-limited supermode linewidths.\n", "  We used 87 high resolution hydrodynamical cosmological simulations from the\nNIHAO suite to investigate the relation between the maximum circular velocity\n(Vmax) of a dark matter halo in a collisionless simulation and the velocity\nwidth of the HI gas in the same halo in the hydrodynamical simulation. These\ntwo quantities are normally used to compare theoretical and observational\nvelocity functions and have led to a possible discrepancy between observations\nand predictions based on the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model. We show that below\n100 km/s, there is clear bias between HI based velocities and Vmax, that leads\nto an underestimation of the actual circular velocity of the halo. When this\nbias is taken into account the CDM model has no trouble in reproducing the\nobserved velocity function and no lack of low velocity galaxies is actually\npresent. Our simulations also reproduce the linewidth - stellar mass\n(Tully-Fisher) relation and HI sizes, indicating that the HI gas in our\nsimulations is as extended as observed. The physical reason for the lower than\nexpected linewidths is that, in contrast to high mass galaxies, low mass\ngalaxies no longer have extended thin HI rotating disks, as is commonly\nassumed.\n", "  The Seyfert 1 galaxy, Ark 120, is a prototype example of the so-called class\nof bare nucleus AGN, whereby there is no known evidence for the presence of\nionized gas along the direct line of sight. Here deep ($>400$ ks exposure),\nhigh resolution X-ray spectroscopy of Ark 120 is presented, from XMM-Newton\nobservations which were carried out in March 2014, together with simultaneous\nChandra/HETG exposures. The high resolution spectra confirmed the lack of\nintrinsic absorbing gas associated with Ark 120, with the only X-ray absorption\npresent originating from the ISM of our own Galaxy, with a possible slight\nenhancement of the Oxygen abundance required with respect to the expected ISM\nvalues in the Solar neighbourhood. However, the presence of several soft X-ray\nemission lines are revealed for the first time in the XMM-Newton RGS spectrum,\nassociated to the AGN and arising from the He and H-like ions of N, O, Ne and\nMg. The He-like line profiles of N, O and Ne appear velocity broadened, with\ntypical FWHM widths of $\\sim5000$ km s$^{-1}$, whereas the H-like profiles are\nunresolved. From the clean measurement of the He-like triplets, we deduce that\nthe broad lines arise from gas of density $n_{\\rm e}\\sim10^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$,\nwhile the photoionization calculations infer that the emitting gas covers at\nleast 10 percent of $4\\pi$ steradian. Thus the broad soft X-ray profiles appear\ncoincident with an X-ray component of the optical-UV Broad Line Region on\nsub-pc scales, whereas the narrow profiles originate on larger pc scales,\nperhaps coincident with the AGN Narrow Line Region. The observations show that\nArk 120 is not intrinsically bare and substantial X-ray emitting gas exists out\nof our direct line of sight towards this AGN.\n", "  We numerically solve the underdamped Langevin equation to obtain the\ntrajectories of a particle in a sinusoidal potential driven by a temporally\nsinusoidal force in a medium with coefficient of friction periodic in space as\nthe potential but with a phase difference. With the appropriate choice of\nsystem parameters, like the mean friction coefficient and the period of the\napplied field, only two kinds of periodic trajectories are obtained for all\npossible initial conditions at low noise strengths: one with a large amplitude\nand a large phase lag with respect to the applied field and the other with a\nsmall amplitude and a small phase lag. Thus, the periodic potential system is\neffectively mapped dynamically into a bistable system. Though the directional\nasymmetry, brought about only by the frictional inhomogeneity, is weak we find\nboth the phenomena of stochastic resonance, with ready explanation in terms of\nthe two dynamical states of trajectories, and ratchet effect simultaneously in\nthe same parameter space. We analyse the results in detail attempting to find\nplausible explanations for each.\n", "  Real networks exhibit heterogeneous nature with nodes playing far different\nroles in structure and function. To identify vital nodes is thus very\nsignificant, allowing us to control the outbreak of epidemics, to conduct\nadvertisements for e-commercial products, to predict popular scientific\npublications, and so on. The vital nodes identification attracts increasing\nattentions from both computer science and physical societies, with algorithms\nranging from simply counting the immediate neighbors to complicated machine\nlearning and message passing approaches. In this review, we clarify the\nconcepts and metrics, classify the problems and methods, as well as review the\nimportant progresses and describe the state of the art. Furthermore, we provide\nextensive empirical analyses to compare well-known methods on disparate real\nnetworks, and highlight the future directions. In despite of the emphasis on\nphysics-rooted approaches, the unification of the language and comparison with\ncross-domain methods would trigger interdisciplinary solutions in the near\nfuture.\n", "  Sulphur trioxide (SO$_3$) is a trace species in the atmospheres of the Earth\nand Venus, as well as well as being an industrial product and an environmental\npollutant. A variational line list for $^{32}$S$^{16}$O$_{3}$, named UYT2, is\npresented containing 21 billion vibration-rotation transitions. UYT2 can be\nused to model infrared spectra of SO$_3$ at wavelengths longwards of 2 $\\mu$m\n($\\nu < 5000$ cm$^{-1}$) for temperatures up to 800 K. Infrared absorption\ncross sections are also recorded at 300 and 500 C are used to validate the UYT2\nline list. The intensities in UYT2 are scaled to match the measured cross\nsections. The line list is made available in electronic form as supplementary\ndata to this article and at \\url{www.exomol.com}.\n", "  We discuss the density shift and broadening of Rydberg spectra measured in\ncold, dense atom clouds in the context of Rydberg atom spectroscopy done at\nroom temperature, dating back to the experiments of Amaldi and Segr\\`e in 1934.\nWe discuss the theory first developed in 1934 by Fermi to model the mean-field\ndensity shift and subsequent developments of the theoretical understanding\nsince then. In particular, we present a model whereby the density shift is\ncalculated using a microscopic model in which the configurations of the\nperturber atoms within the Rydberg orbit are considered. We present\nspectroscopic measurements of a Rydberg atom, taken in a Bose-Einstein\ncondensate (BEC) and thermal clouds with densities varying from\n$5\\times10^{14}\\textrm{cm}^{-3}$ to $9\\times10^{12}\\textrm{cm}^{-3}$. The\ndensity shift measured via the spectrum's center of gravity is compared with\nthe mean-field energy shift expected for the effective atom cloud density\ndetermined via a time of flight image. Lastly, we present calculations and data\ndemonstrating the ability of localizing the Rydberg excitation via the density\nshift within a particular density shell for high principal quantum numbers.\n", "  Both Nb$_3$Pd$_x$Se$_7$ and Ta$_4$Pd$_3$Te$_{16}$ crystallize in a monoclinic\npoint group while exhibiting superconducting transition temperatures as high as\n$T_c\\sim 3.5$ and $\\sim 4.7 $ K, respectively. Disorder was claimed to lead to\nthe extremely large upper critical fields ($H_{c2}$) observed in related\ncompounds. Despite the presence of disorder and heavier elements, $H_{c2}$s in\nTa$_4$Pd$_3$Te$_{16}$ are found to be considerably smaller than those of\nNb$_3$Pd$_x$Se$_7$ while displaying an anomalous, non-saturating linear\ndependence on temperature $T$ for fields along all three crystallographic axes.\nIn contrast, crystals of the latter compound displaying the highest $T_c$s\ndisplay $H_{c2}\\propto (1-T/T_c)^{1/2}$, which in monolayers of transition\nmetal dichalcogenides is claimed to be evidence for an Ising paired\nsuperconducting state resulting from strong spin-orbit coupling. This anomalous\n$T$-dependence indicates that the superconducting state of Nb$_3$Pd$_x$Se$_7$\nis quasi-two-dimensional in nature. This is further supported by a nearly\ndivergent anisotropy in upper-critical fields, i.e. $\\gamma=\nH_{c2}^{b}/H_{c2}^{a^{\\prime}}$, upon approaching $T_c$. Hence, in\nNb$_3$Pd$_x$Se$_7$ the increase of $T_c$ correlates with a marked reduction in\nelectronic dimensionality as observed, for example, in intercalated FeSe. For\nthe Nb compound, Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that an\nincrease in the external field produces an anisotropic orbital response, with\nespecially strong polarization at the Pd sites when the field is perpendicular\nto their square planar environment. Therefore, DFT suggests the field-induced\npinning of the spin to the lattice as a possible mechanism for decoupling the\nsuperconducting planes. Overall, our observations represent further evidence\nfor unconventional superconductivity in the Pd chalcogenides.\n", "  Spider silk is a remarkable example of bio-material with superior mechanical\ncharacteristics. Its multilevel structural organization of dragline and viscid\nsilk leads to unusual and tunable properties, extensively studied from a\nquasi-static point of view. In this study, inspired by the Nephila spider orb\nweb architecture, we propose a novel design for mechanical metamaterials based\non its periodic repetition. We demonstrate that spider-web metamaterial\nstructure plays an important role in the dynamic response and wave attenuation\nmechanisms. The capability of the resulting structure to inhibit elastic wave\npropagation in sub-wavelength frequency ranges is assessed and parametric\nstudies are performed to derive optimal configurations and constituent\nmechanical properties. The results show promise for the design of innovative\nlightweight structures for tunable vibration damping and impact protection, or\nthe protection of large scale infrastructure such as suspended bridges.\n", "  While the existence of quantum superpositions of massive particles over\nmicroscopic separations has been established since the birth of quantum\nmechanics, the maintenance of superposition states over macroscopic separations\nis a subject of modern experimental tests. In Ref. [1], T. Kovachy et al.\nreport on applying optical pulses to place a freely falling Bose-Einstein\ncondensate into a superposition of two trajectories that separate by an\nimpressive distance of 54 cm before being redirected toward one another. When\nthe trajectories overlap, a final optical pulse produces interference with high\ncontrast, but with random phase, between the two wave packets. Contrary to\nclaims made in Ref. [1], we argue that the observed interference is consistent\nwith, but does not prove, that the spatially separated atomic ensembles were in\na quantum superposition state. Therefore, the persistence of such superposition\nstates remains experimentally unestablished.\n", "  The organic-inorganic hybrid lead trihalide perovskites have been emerging as\nthe most attractive photovoltaic material. As regulated by Shockley-Queisser\ntheory, a formidable materials science challenge for the next level improvement\nrequires further band gap narrowing for broader absorption in solar spectrum,\nwhile retaining or even synergistically prolonging the carrier lifetime, a\ncritical factor responsible for attaining the near-band gap photovoltage.\nHerein, by applying controllable hydrostatic pressure we have achieved\nunprecedented simultaneous enhancement in both band gap narrowing and carrier\nlifetime prolongation (up to 70~100% increase) under mild pressures at ~0.3\nGPa. The pressure-induced modulation on pure hybrid perovskites without\nintroducing any adverse chemical or thermal effect clearly demonstrates the\nimportance of band edges on the photon-electron interaction and maps a\npioneering route towards a further boost in their photovoltaic performance.\n", "  The Lippmann-Schwinger equation for the nucleon-nucleon $t$-matrix as well as\nthe corresponding Bethe-Goldstone equation to determine the Brueckner reaction\nmatrix in nuclear matter are reformulated in terms of the resolvents for the\ntotal two-nucleon Hamiltonians defined in free space and in medium\ncorrespondingly. This allows to find solutions at many energies simultaneously\nby using the respective Hamiltonian matrix diagonalization in the stationary\nwave packet basis. Among other important advantages, this approach simplifies\ngreatly the whole computation procedures both for coupled-channel $t$-matrix\nand the Brueckner reaction matrix. Therefore this principally novel scheme is\nexpected to be especially useful for self-consistent nuclear matter\ncalculations because it allows to accelerate in a high degree single-particle\npotential iterations. Furthermore the method provides direct access to the\nproperties of possible two-nucleon bound states in the nuclear medium. The\ncomparison between reaction matrices found via the numerical solution of the\nBethe-Goldstone integral equation and the straightforward Hamiltonian\ndiagonalization shows a high accuracy of the method suggested. The proposed\nfully discrete approach opens a new way to an accurate treatment of two- and\nthree-particle correlations in nuclear matter on the basis of three-particle\nBethe-Faddeev equation by an effective Hamiltonian diagonalization procedure.\n", "  Hadronic spectral functions measured by the ALEPH collaboration in the vector\nand axial-vector channels are used to study potential quark-hadron duality\nviolations (DV). This is done entirely in the framework of pinched kernel\nfinite energy sum rules (FESR), i.e. in a model independent fashion. The\nkinematical range of the ALEPH data is effectively extended up to $s = 10\\;\n{\\mbox{GeV}^2}$ by using an appropriate kernel, and assuming that in this\nregion the spectral functions are given by perturbative QCD. Support for this\nassumption is obtained by using $e^+ e^-$ annihilation data in the vector\nchannel. Results in both channels show a good saturation of the pinched FESR,\nwithout further need of explicit models of DV.\n", "  We present results from a suite of three-dimensional global hydrodynamic\nsimulations which show that spiral density waves propagating in circumstellar\ndisks are unstable to the growth of a parametric instability that leads to\nbreak-down of the flow into turbulence. This spiral wave instability (SWI)\narises from a resonant interaction between pairs of inertial waves, or\ninertial-gravity waves, and the background spiral wave. The development of the\ninstability in the linear regime involves the growth of a broad spectrum of\ninertial modes, with growth rates on the order of the orbital time, and results\nin a nonlinear saturated state in which turbulent velocity perturbations are of\na similar magnitude to those induced by the spiral wave. The turbulence induces\nangular momentum transport, and vertical mixing, at a rate that depends locally\non the amplitude of the spiral wave (we obtain a stress parameter $\\alpha \\sim\n5 \\times 10^{-4}$ in our reference model). The instability is found to operate\nin a wide-range of disk models, including those with isothermal or adiabatic\nequations of state, and in viscous disks where the dimensionless kinematic\nviscosity $\\nu\\le 10^{-5}$. This robustness suggests that the instability will\nhave applications to a broad range of astrophysical disk-related phenomena,\nincluding those in close binary systems, planets embedded in protoplanetary\ndisks (including Jupiter in our own Solar System) and FU Orionis outburst\nmodels. Further work is required to determine the nature of the instability,\nand to evaluate its observational consequences, in physically more complete\ndisk models than we have considered in this paper.\n", "  Inelastic neutron scattering at high momentum transfers (i.e. $Q\\ge20$ {\\AA})\nor DINS provides direct observation of the momentum distribution of light\natoms, making it a powerful probe for studying single-particle motions in\nliquids and solids. The quantitative analysis of DINS data requires an accurate\nknowledge of the instrument resolution function $R_{i}({Q},E)$ at each $Q$ and\nenergy transfer $E$, where the label $i$ indicates whether the resolution was\nexperimentally observed $i={obs}$ or simulated $i=sim$. Here, we describe two\nindependent methods for determining the total resolution function\n$R_{i}({Q},E)$ of the ARCS neutron instrument at the Spallation Neutron Source,\nOak Ridge National Laboratory. The first method uses experimental data from an\narchetypical system (liquid $^4$He) studied with DINS, which are then\nnumerically deconvoluted using its previously determined intrinsic scattering\nfunction to yield $R_{obs}({Q},E)$. The second approach uses accurate Monte\nCarlo simulations of the ARCS spectrometer, which account for all instrument\ncontributions, coupled to a representative scattering kernel to reproduce the\nexperimentally observed response $S({Q},E)$. Using a delta function as\nscattering kernel, the simulation yields a resolution function $R_{sim}({Q},E)$\nwith comparable lineshape and features as $R_{obs}({Q},E)$, but somewhat\nnarrower due to the ideal nature of the model. Using each of these two\n$R_{i}({Q},E)$ separately, we extract characteristic parameters of liquid\n$^4$He such as the intrinsic linewidth $\\alpha_2$ (which sets the atomic\nkinetic energy $\\langle K\\rangle\\sim\\alpha_2$) in the normal liquid and the\nBose-Einstein condensate parameter $n_0$ in the superfluid phase. The extracted\n$\\alpha_2$ values agree well with previous measurements, independently of which\n$R_i(Q,y)$ is used to analyze the data.\n", "  Using density functional tight-binding method, we studied the elastic\nproperties, deformation and failure of armchair (AC) and zigzag (ZZ)\nphosphorene nano tubes (PNTs) under uniaxial tensile strain. We found that the\ndeformation and failure of PNTs are very anisotropic. For ZZ PNTs, three\ndeformation phases are recognized: The primary linear elastic phase, which is\nassociated with the interactions between the neighboring puckers, succeeded by\nthe bond rotation phase, where the puckered configuration of phosphorene is\nsmoothed via bond rotation, and lastly the bond elongation phase, where the P-P\nbonds are directly stretched up to the maximally allowed limit and the failure\nis initiated by the rupture of the most stretched bonds.\n", "  We describe a physics derivation of theorems due to Dai and Freed about the\nAtiyah-Patodi-Singer eta-invariant which is important for anomalies and\ntopological phases of matter. This is done by studying a massive fermion. The\nkey role is played by the wave function of the ground state in the Hilbert\nspace of the fermion in the large mass limit. The ground state takes values in\nthe determinant line bundle and has nontrivial Berry phases which characterize\nthe low energy topological phases.\n", "  Among the many ways of investigating coronal heating, the time lag method of\nViall & Klimchuk (2012) is becoming increasingly prevalent as an analysis\ntechnique complementary to those traditionally used. The time lag method cross\ncorrelates light curves at a given spatial location obtained in spectral bands\nthat sample different temperature plasmas. It has been used most extensively\nwith data from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on the Solar Dynamics\nObservatory. We have previously applied the time lag method to entire active\nregions and surrounding quiet Sun and create maps of the results (Viall &\nKlimchuk 2012; Viall & Klimchuk 2015). We find that the majority of time lags\nare consistent with the cooling of coronal plasma that has been impulsively\nheated. Additionally, a significant fraction of the map area has a time lag of\nzero. This does not indicate a lack of variability. Rather, strong variability\nmust be present, and it must occur in phase in the different channels. We have\nshown previously that these zero time lags are consistent with the transition\nregion response to coronal nanoflares (Viall & Klimchuk 2015; Bradshaw & Viall\n2016), but other explanations are possible. A common misconception is that the\nzero time lag indicates steady emission resulting from steady heating. Using\nsimulated and observed light curves, we demonstrate here that highly correlated\nlight curves at zero time lag are not compatible with equilibrium solutions.\nSuch light curves can only be created by evolution.\n", "  The electron momentum density obtained from the Schwinger-like mechanism is\nevaluated for a graphene sample immersed in a homogeneous time-dependent\nelectric field. Based on the analogy between graphene low-energy electrons and\nquantum electrodynamics (QED), numerical techniques borrowed from strong field\nQED are employed and compared to approximate analytical approaches. It is\ndemonstrated that for some range of experimentally accessible parameters, the\npair production proceeds by sequences of adiabatic evolutions followed by\nnon-adiabatic Landau-Zener transitions, reminiscent of the Kibble-Zurek\nmechanism describing topological defect density in second order phase\ntransitions. For some field configurations, this yields interference patterns\nin momentum space which are explained in terms of the adiabatic-impulse model\nand the Landau-Zener-St\\\"{u}ckelberg interferometry.\n", "  Recent $\\gamma$-ray observations suggest that the particle acceleration\noccurs at the outer region of the pulsar magnetosphere. The magnetic field\nlines in the outer acceleration region (OAR) are connected to the neutron star\nsurface (NSS). If copious electron--positron pairs are produced near the NSS,\nsuch pairs flow into the OAR and screen the electric field there. To activate\nthe OAR, the electromagnetic cascade due to the electric field near the NSS\nshould be suppressed. However, since a return current is expected along the\nfield lines through the OAR, the outflow extracted from the NSS alone cannot\nscreen the electric field just above the NSS. In this paper, we analytically\nand numerically study the electric-field screening at the NSS taking into\naccount the effects of the back-flowing particles from the OAR. In certain\nlimited cases, the electric field is screened without significant pair cascade\nif only ultrarelativistic particles ($\\gamma\\gg1$) flow back to the NSS. On the\nother hand, if electron--positron pairs with a significant number density and\nmildly relativistic temperature, expected to distribute in a wide region of the\nmagnetosphere, flow back to the NSS, these particles adjust the current and\ncharge densities, so that the electric field can be screened without pair\ncascade. We obtain the condition for the number density of particles to screen\nthe electric field at the NSS. We also find that in ion-extracted case from the\nNSS, bunches of particles are ejected to the outer region quasi-periodically,\nwhich is a possible mechanism of observed radio emission.\n", "  We present observations of the 85.69 GHz continuum emission and H42alpha line\nemission from the central 30 arcsec within NGC 4945. Both sources of emission\noriginate from nearly identical structures that can be modelled as exponential\ndiscs with a scale length of ~2.1 arcsec (or ~40 pc). An analysis of the\nspectral energy distribution based on combining these data with archival data\nimply that 84% +/- 10% of the 85.69 GHz continuum emission originates from\nfree-free emission. The electron temperature is 5400 +/- 600 K, which is\ncomparable to what has been measured near the centre of the Milky Way Galaxy.\nThe star formation rate (SFR) based on the H42alpha and 85.69 GHz free-free\nemission (and using a distance of 3.8 Mpc) is 4.35 +/- 0.25 M/yr. This is\nconsistent with the SFR from the total infrared flux and with previous\nmeasurements based on recombination line emission, and it is within a factor of\n~2 of SFRs derived from radio data. The Spitzer Space Telescope 24 micron data\nand Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer 22 micron data yield SFRs ~10x lower\nthan the ALMA measurements, most likely because the mid-infrared data are\nstrongly affected by dust attenuation equivalent to A_V=150. These results\nindicate that SFRs based on mid-infrared emission may be highly inaccurate for\ndusty, compact circumnuclear starbursts.\n", "  The origin of Phobos and Deimos is still an open question. Currently, none of\nthe three proposed scenarios for their origin (intact capture of two distinct\nouter solar system small bodies, co-accretion with Mars, and accretion within\nan impact-generated disk) is able to reconcile their orbital and physical\nproperties. Here, we investigate the expected mineralogical composition and\nsize of the grains from which the moons once accreted assuming they formed\nwithin an impact-generated accretion disk. A comparison of our results with the\npresent day spectral properties of the moons allows us to conclude that their\nbuilding blocks cannot originate from a magma phase, thus preventing their\nformation in the innermost part of the disk. Instead, gas-to-solid condensation\nof the building blocks in the outer part of an extended gaseous disk is found\nas a possible formation mechanism as it does allow reproducing both the\nspectral and physical properties of the moons. Such a scenario may finally\nreconcile their orbital and physical properties alleviating the need to invoke\nan unlikely capture scenario to explain their physical properties.\n", "  Aims. This paper reports accurate laboratory frequencies of the rotational\nground state transitions of two astronomically relevant molecular ions, NH3D+\nand CF+. Methods. Spectra in the millimeter-wave band were recorded by the\nmethod of rotational state-selective attachment of He-atoms to the molecular\nions stored and cooled in a cryogenic ion trap held at 4 K. The lowest\nrotational transition in the A state (ortho state) of NH$_3$D$^+$ ($J_K = 1_0 -\n0_0$), and the two hyperfine components of the ground state transition of\nCF$^+$($J = 1 - 0$) were measured with a relative precision better than\n$10^{-7}$. Results. For both target ions the experimental transition\nfrequencies agree with recent observations of the same lines in different\nastronomical environments. In the case of NH$_3$D$^+$ the high-accuracy\nlaboratory measurements lend support to its tentative identification in the\ninterstellar medium. For CF$^+$ the experimentally determined hyperfine\nsplitting confirms previous quantum-chemical calculations and the intrinsic\nspectroscopic nature of a double-peaked line profile observed in the $J = 1 -\n0$ transition towards the Horsehead PDR.\n", "  We present 1.3 mm observations of the Sun-like star $\\tau$ Ceti with the\nAtacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) that probe angular scales\nof $\\sim1$'' (4 AU). This first interferometric image of the $\\tau$ Ceti\nsystem, which hosts both a debris disk and possible multiplanet system, shows\nemission from a nearly face-on belt of cold dust with a position angle of\n$90^\\circ$ surrounding an unresolved central source at the stellar position. To\ncharacterize this emission structure, we fit parametric models to the\nmillimeter visibilities. The resulting best-fit model yields an inner belt edge\nof $6.2^{+9.8}_{-4.6}$ AU, consistent with inferences from lower resolution,\nfar-infrared Herschel observations. While the limited data at sufficiently\nshort baselines preclude us from placing stronger constraints on the belt\nproperties and its relation to the proposed five planet system, the\nobservations do provide a strong lower limit on the fractional width of the\nbelt, $\\Delta R/R > 0.75$ with $99\\%$ confidence. This fractional width is more\nsimilar to broad disks such as HD 107146 than narrow belts such as the Kuiper\nBelt and Fomalhaut. The unresolved central source has a higher flux density\nthan the predicted flux of the stellar photosphere at 1.3 mm. Given previous\nmeasurements of an excess by a factor of $\\sim2$ at 8.7 mm, this emission is\nlikely due to a hot stellar chromosphere.\n", "  We study three-point functions of single-trace operators in the su(1|1)\nsector of planar N = 4 SYM borrowing several tools based on Integrability. In\nthe most general configuration of operators in this sector, we have found a\ndeterminant expression for the tree-level structure constants. We then compare\nthe predictions of the recently proposed hexagon program against all available\ndata. We have obtained a match once additional sign factors are included when\nthe two hexagon form-factors are assembled together to form the structure\nconstants. In the particular case of one BPS and two non-BPS operators we\nmanaged to identify the relevant form-factors with a domain wall partition\nfunction of a certain six-vertex model. This partition function can be\nexplicitly evaluated and factorizes at all loops. In addition, we use this\nresult to compute the structure constants and show that at strong coupling in\nthe so-called BMN regime, its leading order contribution has a determinant\nexpression.\n", "  Most investigations of the X-ray variability of active galactic nuclei (AGN)\nhave been concentrated on the detailed analyses of individual, nearby sources.\nA relatively small number of studies have treated the ensemble behaviour of the\nmore general AGN population in wider regions of the luminosity-redshift plane.\nWe want to determine the ensemble variability properties of a rich AGN sample,\ncalled Multi-Epoch XMM Serendipitous AGN Sample (MEXSAS), extracted from the\nfifth release of the XMM-Newton Serendipitous Source Catalogue (XMMSSC-DR5),\nwith redshift between 0.1 and 5, and X-ray luminosities in the 0.5-4.5 keV band\nbetween 10^42 and 10^47 erg/s. We urge caution on the use of the normalised\nexcess variance (NXS), noting that it may lead to underestimate variability if\nused improperly. We use the structure function (SF), updating our previous\nanalysis for a smaller sample. We propose a correction to the NXS variability\nestimator, accounting for the light curve duration in the rest frame on the\nbasis of the knowledge of the variability behaviour gained by SF studies. We\nfind an ensemble increase of the X-ray variability with the rest-frame time lag\ntau, given by tau^0.12. We confirm an inverse dependence on the X-ray\nluminosity, approximately as L_X^-0.19. We analyse the SF in different X-ray\nbands, finding a dependence of the variability on the frequency as nu^-0.15,\ncorresponding to a softer when brighter trend. In turn, this dependence allows\nus to parametrically correct the variability estimated in observer-frame bands\nto that in the rest frame, resulting in a moderate shift upwards\n(V-correction). Ensemble X-ray variability of AGNs is best described by the\nstructure function. An improper use of the normalised excess variance may lead\nto an underestimate of the intrinsic variability, so that appropriate\ncorrections to the data or the models must be applied to prevent these effects.\n", "  We relate the information entropy and the mass variance of any distribution\nin the regime of small fluctuations. We use a set of Monte Carlo simulations of\ndifferent homogeneous and inhomogeneous distributions to verify the relation\nand also test it in a set of cosmological N-body simulations. We find that the\nrelation is in excellent agreement with the simulations and is independent of\nnumber density and the nature of the distributions. We show that the relation\nbetween information entropy and mass variance can be used to determine the\nlinear bias on large scales and detect the signatures of non-Gaussianity on\nsmall scales in galaxy distributions.\n", "  Four exotic charmonium-like states, i.e. $X(4140)$, $X(4274)$, $X(4500)$, and\n$X(4700)$, have been observed very recently by LHCb Collaboration in the decay\nprocess $B^+\\to J/\\psi \\phi K^+$ using the 3${\\rm fb}^{-1}$ data of $p\\bar p$\ncollision at $\\sqrt s= 7$ and $8$ TeV. In this paper, we investigate\nsystematically the properties of hidden charm tetraquark states. The hidden\ncharm tetraquarks form an octet configuration and a singlet configuration\naccording to flavor $SU(3)$ symmetry. Based on a diquark-antidiquark model, the\nhidden charm tetraquarks spectra are given. The previous XYZ exotic states\naltogether with the newly ones $X(4140)$, $X(4274)$, $X(4500)$, and $X(4700)$,\ncan be well classified into certain representations. The spin-parities and\nmasses of the XYZ are predicted, most of which are in agreement with the data.\nWe particularly find that $Z_c(4430)$ may be treated as the first radial\nexcitation of $Z_c(3900)$, while the $Y(1^{--})$ states can be obtained by the\nfirst orbital excitation of the $X/Z$ states. Besides, we calculate the decay\nwidths of the hidden charm tetraquarks into two charmed mesons. This work gives\na general tetraquark description for the XYZ states, which is helpful to\nuncover their inner structures.\n", "  Effective field theories have often been applied to systems with deeply\ninelastic reactions that produce particles with large momenta outside the\ndomain of validity of the effective theory. The effects of the deeply inelastic\nreactions have been taken into account in previous work by adding local\nanti-Hermitian terms to the effective Hamiltonian. Here we show that when\nmulti-particle systems are considered, an additional modification is required\nin equations governing the density matrix. We define an effective density\nmatrix by tracing over the states containing high-momentum particles, and show\nthat it satisfies a Lindblad equation, with local Lindblad operators determined\nby the anti-Hermitian terms in the effective Hamiltonian density.\n", "  We experimentally demonstrate high quality factor spin wave resonances in an\nencapsulated thin film of the organic-based ferrimagnet vanadium\ntetracyanoethylene (V[TCNE]$_\\textit{x~2}$) coated on an a-plane sapphire\nsubstrate by low temperature chemical vapor deposition. The thickness standing\nwave modes are observed in a broad frequency range (1 GHz ~ 5 GHz) with high\nquality factor exceeding 3,200 in ambient air at room temperature, rivaling\nthose of inorganic magnetic materials. The exchange constant of\nV[TCNE]$_\\textit{x~2}$, a crucial material parameter for future study and\ndevice design of the V[TCNE]$_\\textit{x~2}$, is extracted from the measurement\nwith a value of $(4.61\\pm 0.35)\\times 10^{-16} \\mathrm{\\: m^{2}}$. Our result\nestablishes the feasibility of using organic-based materials for building\nhybrid magnonic devices and circuits.\n", "  Stellar elemental abundances are important for understanding the fundamental\nproperties of a star or stellar group, such as age and evolutionary history, as\nwell as the composition of an orbiting planet. However, as abundance\nmeasurement techniques have progressed, there has been little standardization\nbetween individual methods and their comparisons. As a result, different\nstellar abundance procedures determine measurements that vary beyond quoted\nerror for the same elements within the same stars (Hinkel et al. 2014). The\npurpose of this paper is to better understand the systematic variations between\nmethods and offer recommendations for producing more accurate results in the\nfuture. We have invited a number of participants from around the world\n(Australia, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland, and USA) to calculate ten element\nabundances (C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Fe, Ni, Ba, and Eu) using the same stellar\nspectra for four stars (HD361, HD10700, HD121504, HD202206). Each group\nproduced measurements for each of the stars using: 1) their own autonomous\ntechniques, 2) standardized stellar parameters, 3) standardized line list, and\n4) both standardized parameters and line list. We present the resulting stellar\nparameters, absolute abundances, and a metric of data similarity that\nquantifies homogeneity of the data. We conclude that standardization of some\nkind, particularly stellar parameters, improves the consistency between\nmethods. However, because results did not converge as more free parameters were\nstandardized, it is clear there are inherent issues within the techniques that\nneed to be reconciled. Therefore, we encourage more conversation and\ntransparency within the community such that stellar abundance determinations\ncan be reproducible as well as accurate and precise.\n", "  We analyze an event in front of the bow shock observed by Cluster spacecraft\non 22.02.2006. This event has many attributes of Hot Flow Anomaly at early\nstage of development including strong upstream beam and disturbed magnetic\nprofile with increased magnetic field at one or two sides as observed by 4\nCluster spacecraft. The angle between the magnetic field vectors at two sides\nof the current sheet was ~ 10{\\deg}. The minimum magnetic field magnitude\nwithin HFA was ~ 1 nT. The shock at two sides of the HFA was\nquasi-perpendicular. Upstream beam was observed on the leading side of the HFA.\nParameters and velocity distributions of solar wind ions and of upstream ions\nobserved on C1 and C3 spacecraft are analyzed separately in order to trace\ntheir changes across the event. The goal of this analysis was to get more\ninformation about the source of upstream beam. The beam evolved from the start\nof its observation till the HFA encounter being initially energetic and nearly\nmono-energetic. Its mean energy continuously decreased and energy spectrum\nwidened as HFA approached spacecraft. First observation of particular energy\nthat diminished with approaching the HFA varied linearly with gyro-radius of\nions. The energy spectra of integrated beam (for all observation) and the\nenergy spectrum of the beam observed just in front of HFA are very similar to\nthe magnetosheath ion energy spectrum observed after bow shock crossing at ~ 1\nhour after observation of the HFA. Lowest energies in the beam were observed\nwithin HFA only. Highest density and pressure of upstream beam are found in the\ncurrent sheet itself. We suggest that the upstream beam is the result of the\nmagnetosheath ions leakage through the region of HFA crossing with the bow\nshock front.\n", "  We study a universe filled with dust-like matter in the form of discrete\ninhomogeneities (e.g., galaxies and their groups and clusters) and two sets of\nperfect fluids with linear and nonlinear equations of state, respectively. The\nbackground spacetime geometry is defined by the FLRW metric. In the weak\ngravitational field limit, we develop the first-order scalar and vector\ncosmological perturbation theory. Our approach works at all cosmological scales\n(i.e. sub-horizon and super-horizon ones) and incorporates linear and nonlinear\neffects with respect to energy density fluctuations. We demonstrate that the\nscalar perturbation (i.e. the gravitational potential) as well as the vector\nperturbation can be split into individual contributions from each matter\nsource. Each of these contributions satisfies its own equation. The\nvelocity-independent parts of the individual gravitational potentials are\ncharacterized by a finite time-dependent Yukawa interaction range being the\nsame for each individual contribution. We also obtain the exact form of the\ngravitational potential and vector perturbation related to the discrete matter\nsources. The self-consistency of our approach is thoroughly checked. The\nderived equations can form the theoretical basis for numerical simulations for\na wide class of cosmological models.\n", "  Stellar streams have become central to studies of the interaction histories\nof nearby galaxies. To characterize the most prominent parts of the stellar\nstream around the well-known nearby (d = 17 Mpc) edge-on disk galaxy NGC 5907,\nwe have obtained and analyzed new, deep gri Subaru/Suprime-Cam and 3.6 micron\nSpitzer/Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) observations. Combining the near-infrared\n3.6 micron data with visible-light images allows us to use a long wavelength\nbaseline to estimate the metallicity and age of the stellar population along a\n~60 kpc long segment of the stream. We have fitted the stellar spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) with a single-burst stellar population synthesis model and\nwe use it to distinguish between the proposed satellite accretion and\nminor/major merger formation models of the stellar stream around this galaxy.\nWe conclude that a massive minor merger (stellar mass ratio of at least 1:8)\ncan best account for the metallicity of -0.3 inferred along the brightest parts\nof the stream.\n", "  Fast saturable absorbers (FSAs) play a critical role in stabilizing many\npassively modelocked lasers. The most commonly used averaged model to study\nthese lasers is the Haus modelocking equation (HME) that includes a third-order\nnonlinear FSA. However, it predicts a narrow region of stability that is\ninconsistent with experiments. To better replicate the laser physics, averaged\nlaser models that include FSAs with higher-than-third-order nonlinearities have\nbeen introduced. Here, we compare three common FSA models to each other and to\nthe HME using the recently-developed boundary tracking algorithms. The three\nFSA models are the cubic-quintic model, the sinusoidal model, and the algebraic\nmodel. We find that all three models predict the existence of a stable\nhigh-energy solution that is not present in the HME and have a much larger\nstable operating region. We also find that all three models predict\nqualitatively similar stability diagrams. We conclude that averaged laser\nmodels that include FSAs with higher-than-third-order nonlinearity should be\nused when studying the stability of passively modelocked lasers.\n", "  In this paper, we use the restricted three body problem in the binary stellar\nsystems, taking photogravitational effects of both the stars. The aim of this\nstudy is to investigate the motion of the infinitesimal mass in the vicinity of\nthe Lagrangian points. We have computed semi-analytical expressions for the\nlocations of the collinear points with the help of the perturbation technique.\nThe stability of the triangular points is studied in stellar binary systems\nKepler-34, Kepler-35, Kepler-413 and Kepler-16. To investigate the stability of\nthe triangular points, we have obtained the expressions for critical mass which\ndepends on the radiation of both primaries. Fourier-series method is applied to\nobtain periodic orbits of the infinitesimal mass around triangular points in\nbinary stellar systems. We have obtained Fourier expansions of the periodic\norbits around triangular points upto third order terms. A comparison is made\nbetween periodic orbits obtained by Fourier-series method and with Runge-Kutta\nintegration of fourth order.\n", "  We consider the application of twistor theory to five-dimensional anti-de\nSitter space. The twistor space of AdS$_5$ is the same as the ambitwistor space\nof the four-dimensional conformal boundary; the geometry of this correspondence\nis reviewed for both the bulk and boundary. A Penrose transform allows us to\ndescribe free bulk fields, with or without mass, in terms of data on twistor\nspace. Explicit representatives for the bulk-to-boundary propagators of scalars\nand spinors are constructed, along with twistor action functionals for the free\ntheories. Evaluating these twistor actions on bulk-to-boundary propagators is\nshown to produce the correct two-point functions.\n", "  We use the cellular automaton model described in L\\'opez Fuentes \\& Klimchuk\n(2015, ApJ, 799, 128) to study the evolution of coronal loop plasmas. The\nmodel, based on the idea of a critical misalignment angle in tangled magnetic\nfields, produces nanoflares of varying frequency with respect to the plasma\ncooling time. We compare the results of the model with active region (AR)\nobservations obtained with the Hinode/XRT and SDO/AIA instruments. The\ncomparison is based on the statistical properties of synthetic and observed\nloop lightcurves. Our results show that the model reproduces the main\nobservational characteristics of the evolution of the plasma in AR coronal\nloops. The typical intensity fluctuations have an amplitude of 10 to 15\\% both\nfor the model and the observations. The sign of the skewness of the intensity\ndistributions indicates the presence of cooling plasma in the loops. We also\nstudy the emission measure (EM) distribution predicted by the model and obtain\nslopes in log(EM) versus log(T) between 2.7 and 4.3, in agreement with\npublished observational values.\n", "  We propose a \"scotogenic\" mechanism relating small neutrino mass and\ncosmological dark matter. Neutrinos are Dirac fermions with masses arising only\nin two--loop order through the sector responsible for dark matter. Two triality\nsymmetries ensure both dark matter stability and strict lepton number\nconservation at higher orders. A global spontaneously broken U(1) symmetry\nleads to a physical $Diracon$ that induces invisible Higgs decays which add up\nto the Higgs to dark matter mode. This enhances sensitivities to\nspin-independent WIMP dark matter search below $m_h/2$.\n", "  An example of strange nonchaotic attractor (SNA) is discussed in a\ndissipative system of mechanical nature driven by constant torque applied to\none of the elements of the construction. So the external force is not\noscillatory, and the system is autonomous. Components of the motion with\nincommensurable frequencies emerge due to the irrational ratio of sizes of the\ninvolved rotating elements. We regard the phenomenon as strange nonchaotic\nself-oscillations, and its existence sheds new light on the question of\nfeasibility of SNA in autonomous systems.\n", "  A general consensus now is that there are two physically inequivalent\ncomplete decompositions of the nucleon spin, i.e. the decomposition of the\ncanonical type and that of mechanical type. The well-known Jaffe-Manohar\ndecomposition is of the former type. Unfortunately, there is a wide-spread\nmisbelief that this decomposition matches the partonic picture, which states\nthat motion of quarks in the nucleon is approximately free. In the present\nmonograph, we reveal that this understanding is not necessarily correct and\nthat the Jaffe-Manohar decomposition is not such a decomposition, which\nnatively reflects the intrinsic (or static) orbital angular momentum structure\nof the nucleon.\n", "  Photoevaporation is probably the main agent for gas dispersal during the last\nstages of protoplanetary disk evolution. However, the overall mass loss rate in\nthe photoevaporative wind and its driving mechanism are still not well\nunderstood. Here we report multi-configuration Very Large Array observations at\n0.7, 3, and 5 cm towards the transitional disk of GM Aur. Our radio continuum\nobservations allow us to image and spatially resolve, for the first time, the\nthree main components at work in this stage of the disk evolution: the disk of\ndust, the ionized radio jet perpendicular to it, and the photoevaporative wind\narising from the disk. The mass loss rate inferred from the flux density of the\nradio jet is consistent with the ratio between ejection and accretion rates\nfound in younger objects, suggesting that transitional disks can power\ncollimated ejections of material apparently following the same physical\nmechanisms as much younger protostars. Our results indicate that extreme-UV\n(EUV) radiation is the main ionizing mechanism of the photoevaporative wind\ntraced by the free-free emission. The required low EUV photon luminosity of\n$\\sim6\\times10^{40}$ s$^{-1}$ would produce a photoevaporation rate of only\n$\\dot{M}_{\\rm w,EUV}\\simeq1.3\\times10^{-10}~M_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. Therefore,\nother mechanisms are required to disperse the disk in the timescale imposed by\nobservations.\n", "  We study spinon excitations of the integrable spin-1 (Fateev-Zamolodchikov;\nFZ) chain and their relation to the hidden supersymmetry. Using the notion of\nthe supercharges earlier introduced to the spin chains, which change the system\nlength by one, we found that they nontrivially act on one of two kinds of the\ndegrees of freedom for the FZ chain. Their actions were obtained to be the same\nas those of the supercharges defined on the supersymmetric sine-Gordon model,\nthe low-energy effective field theory of the FZ chain. Moreover, we construct\nthe eigenstates which are invariant under the supersymmetric Hamiltonian given\nas the anti-commutator of the supercharges.\n", "  Supersymmetric lattice Ward-Takahashi identities are investigated\nperturbatively up to two-loop corrections for super doubler approach of $N=2$\nlattice Wess-Zumino models in 1- and 2-dimensions. In this approach notorious\nchiral fermion doublers are treated as physical particles and momentum\nconservation is modified in such a way that lattice Leibniz rule is satisfied.\nThe two major difficulties to keep exact lattice supersymmetry are overcome.\nThis formulation defines, however, nonlocal field theory. Nevertheless we\nconfirm that exact supersymmetry on the lattice is realized for all\nsupercharges at the quantum level. Delicate issues of associativity are also\ndiscussed.\n", "  The EM field pattern created by spectators in relativistic heavy-ion\ncollisions plants a seed of positive (negative) magnetic helicity in the\nhemisphere above (below) the reaction plane. Owing to the chiral anomaly, the\nmagnetic helicity interacts with the fermionic helicity of the collision\nsystem, and causes photons emitted in upper- and lower-hemispheres to have\ndifferent preferences in the circular polarization. In this paper, we lay down\na procedure to measure the variation of the circular polarization w.r.t the\nreaction plane in relativistic heavy-ion collisions for massless photons, as\nwell as similar polarization patterns for vector mesons decaying into two\ndaughters. We propose to study the yield differentially and compare the yield\nbetween upper- and lower-hemispheres in order to identify and quantify such\neffects.\n", "  Two observations of V959 Mon, done using the Chandra X-ray gratings during\nthe late outburst phases (2012 September and December), offer extraordinary\ninsight into the physics and chemistry of this Galactic ONe nova. the X-ray\nflux was 1.7 x 10(-11) erg/cm(2)/s and 8.6 x 10(-12) erg/cm(2)/s, respectively\nat the two epochs. The first result, coupled with electron density diagnostics\nand compared with published optical and ultraviolet observations, indicates\nthat most likely in 2012 September the X-rays originate from a very small\nfraction of the ejecta, concentrated in very dense clumps. We obtained a fairly\ngood fit to the September spectrum with a model of plasma in collisional\nionization equilibrium (CIE) with two components; one at a temperature of 0.78\nkeV, blueshifted by 710-930 km/s, the other at a temperature of 4.5 keV, mostly\ncontributing to the high-energy continuum. However, we cannot rule out a range\nof plasma temperatures between these two extremes. In December, the central\nwhite dwarf (WD) became visible in X-rays. We estimate an effective temperature\nof about 680,000 K, consistent with a WD mass ~1.1 M(sol). The WD flux is\nmodulated with the orbital period, indicating high inclination, and two\nquasi-periodic modulations with hour timescales were also observed. No hot\nplasma component with temperature above 0.5 keV was observed in December, and\nthe blue-shifted component cooled to kT~0.45 keV. Additionally, new emission\nlines due to a much cooler plasma appeared, which were not observed two months\nearlier. We estimate abundances and yields of elements in the nova wind that\ncannot be measured in the optical spectra and confirm the high Ne abundance\npreviously derived for this nova. We also find high abundance of Al, 230 times\nthe solar value, consistently with the prediction that ONe novae contribute to\nat least 1/3rd of the Galactic yield of Al(26).\n", "  Motivated by trapping and cooling experiments with non-spherical\nnanoparticles, we discuss how their combined rotational and translational\nquantum state is affected by the interaction with a gaseous environment. Based\non the quantum master equation in terms of orientation-dependent scattering\namplitudes, we evaluate the localization rate for gas collisions off an\nanisotropic van der Waals-type potential and for photon scattering off an\nanisotropic dielectric. We also show how pure angular momentum diffusion arises\nfrom these open quantum dynamics in the limit of weak anisotropies.\n", "  Dual-comb interferometry is a measurement technique that uses two laser\nfrequency combs to retrieve complex spectra in a line-by-line basis. This\ntechnique can be implemented with electro-optic frequency combs, offering\nintrinsic mutual coherence, high acquisition speed and flexible repetition-rate\noperation. A challenge with the operation of this kind of frequency comb in\ndual-comb interferometry is its limited optical bandwidth. Here, we use\ncoherent spectral broadening and demonstrate electro-optic dual-comb\ninterferometry over the entire telecommunications C band (200 lines covering ~\n40 nm, measured within 10 microseconds at 100 signal-to-noise ratio per\nspectral line). These results offer new prospects for electro-optic dual-comb\ninterferometry as a suitable technology for high-speed broadband metrology, for\nexample in optical coherence tomography or coherent Raman microscopy.\n", "  Strange hadrons, especially multi-strange hadrons are good probes for the\nearly partonic stage of heavy ion collisions due to their small hadronic cross\nsections. In this paper, I give a brief review on the elliptic flow\nmeasurements of strange and multi-strange hadrons in relativistic heavy ion\ncollisions at Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and Large Hadron Collider\n(LHC).\n", "  The Fermi bubbles are two lobes filled with non-thermal particles that emit\ngamma rays, extend $\\approx$10 kpc vertically from the Galactic center, and\nformed from either nuclear star formation or accretion activity on Sgr A*.\nSimulations predict a range of shock strengths as the bubbles expand into the\nsurrounding hot gas halo distribution ($T_{halo} \\approx 2 \\times 10^6$ K), but\nwith significant uncertainties in the energetics, age, and thermal gas\nstructure. The bubbles should contain thermal gas with temperatures between\n$10^6$ and $10^8$ K, with potential X-ray signatures. In this work, we\nconstrain the bubbles' thermal gas structure by modeling the OVII and OVIII\nemission line strengths from archival XMM-Newton and Suzaku data. Our emission\nmodel includes a hot thermal volume-filled bubble component cospatial with the\ngamma-ray region, and a shell of compressed material. We find that a\nbubble/shell model with $n \\approx 1 \\times 10^{-3}$ cm$^{-3}$ and with\nlog($T$) $\\approx$ 6.60-6.70 is consistent with the observed line intensities.\nIn the framework of a continuous Galactic outflow, we infer a bubble expansion\nrate, age, and energy injection rate of $490_{-77}^{+230}$ km s$^{-1}$,\n$4.3_{-1.4}^{+0.8}$ Myr, and $2.3_{-0.9}^{+5.1} \\times 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$.\nThese estimates are consistent with the bubbles forming from a Sgr A* accretion\nevent rather than from nuclear star formation.\n", "  We present a polarization catalog of 533 extragalactic radio sources with 2.3\nGHz total intensity above 420 mJy from the S-band Polarization All Sky Survey,\nS-PASS, with corresponding 1.4 GHz polarization information from the NRAO VLA\nSky Survey, NVSS. We studied selection effects and found that fractional\npolarization, $\\pi$, of radio objects at both wavelengths depends on the\nspectral index, source magnetic field disorder, source size and depolarization.\nThe relationship between depolarization, spectrum and size shows that\ndepolarization occurs primarily in the source vicinity. The median $\\pi_{2.3}$\nof resolved objects in NVSS is approximately two times larger than that of\nunresolved sources. Sources with little depolarization are $\\sim2$ times more\npolarized than both highly depolarized and re-polarized sources. This indicates\nthat intrinsic magnetic field disorder is the dominant mechanism responsible\nfor the observed low fractional polarization of radio sources at high\nfrequencies. We predict that number counts from polarization surveys will be\nsimilar at 1.4 GHz and at 2.3 GHz, for fixed sensitivity, although $\\sim$10% of\nall sources may be currently missing because of strong depolarization. Objects\nwith $\\pi_{1.4}\\approx \\pi_{2.3} \\ge 4\\%$ typically have simple Faraday\nstructures, so are most useful for background samples. Almost half of flat\nspectrum ($\\alpha \\ge -0.5$) and $\\sim$25% of steep spectrum objects are\nre-polarized. Steep spectrum, depolarized sources show a weak negative\ncorrelation of depolarization with redshift in the range 0 $<$ z $<$ 2.3.\nPrevious non-detections of redshift evolution are likely due the inclusion of\nre-polarized sources as well.\n", "  Experimental era of rare $B$-decays started with the measurement of $B \\to\nK^* \\gamma$ by CLEO in 1993, followed two years later by the measurement of the\ninclusive decay $B \\to X_s \\gamma$, which serves as the standard candle in this\nfield. The frontier has moved in the meanwhile to the experiments at the LHC,\nin particular, LHCb, with the decay $B^0 \\to \\mu^+ \\mu^-$ at about 1 part in\n$10^{10}$ being the smallest branching fraction measured so far. Experimental\nprecision achieved in this area has put the standard model to unprecedented\nstringent tests and more are in the offing in the near future. I review some\nkey measurements in radiative, semileptonic and leptonic rare $B$-decays,\ncontrast them with their estimates in the SM, and focus on several mismatches\nreported recently. They are too numerous to be ignored, yet , standing alone,\nnone of them is significant enough to warrant the breakdown of the SM. Rare\n$B$-decays find themselves at the crossroads, possibly pointing to new\nhorizons, but quite likely requiring an improved theoretical description in the\ncontext of the SM. An independent precision experiment such as Belle II may\nhelp greatly in clearing some of the current experimental issues.\n", "  We report on the first deep optical observations of two $\\gamma$-ray pulsars,\nboth among the very first discovered by the {\\em Fermi} Gamma-ray Space\nTelescope. The two pulsars are the radio-loud PSR\\, J1907+0602 in the TeV\npulsar wind nebula (PWN) MGRO\\, J1908+06 and the radio-quiet PSR\\, J1809$-$2332\nin the \"Taz\" radio/X-ray PWN. These pulsars are relatively young and energetic\nand have been both detected in the X-rays by \\xmm, which makes them viable\ntargets for optical observations. We observed the pulsar fields in the B and V\nbands with the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in June/July 2015 to search for their\noptical counterparts. Neither of the two pulsars has been detected down to\n$3\\sigma$ limiting magnitudes of $m_{\\rm v} \\sim 26.9$ and $m_{\\rm v} \\sim\n27.6$ for PSR\\, J1907+0602 and PSR\\, J1809$-$2332, respectively. We discuss\nthese results in the framework of the multi-wavelength emission properties of\npulsars.\n", "  We investigate the photon emission properties of the driven-dissipative Rabi\nmodel in the so-called ultrastrong and deep strong coupling regimes, where the\natom-cavity coupling rate $g$ becomes comparable or larger than the cavity\nfrequency $\\omega_c$. By solving numerically the master equation in the\ndressed-state basis, we compute the output field correlation functions in the\nsteady-state for a wide range of coupling rates. We find that, as the\natom-cavity coupling strength increases, the system undergoes multiple\ntransitions in the photon statistics. In particular, a first sharp\nanti-bunching to bunching transition, occurring at $g\\sim0.45\\omega_c$, leading\nto the breakdown of the photon blockade due to the counter-rotating terms, is\nshown to be the consequence of a parity shift in the energy spectrum. A\nsubsequent revival of the photon blockade and the emergence of the\nquasi-coherent statistics, for even larger coupling rates, are attributed to an\ninterplay between the nonlinearity in the energy spectrum and the transition\nrates between the dressed states.\n", "  We present a numerical study of the emergence of Majorana and Andreev bound\nstates in a system composed by two quantum dots, in which one of then is\ncoupled to a conventional superconductor, SC1, and the other connects to a\ntopological superconductor, SC2. By controlling the interdot coupling we can\ndrive the system from a two single (uncoupled) quantum dots to a double\n(coupled) dot system configurations. We employ a recursive Green's function\ntechnique that provides us with numerically exact results for the local density\nof states of the system. We first show that in the uncoupled dot configuration\n(single dot behavior) the Majorana and the Andreev bound states appear in an\nindividual dot in two completely distinct regimes. Therefore, they cannot\ncoexist in the single quantum dot system. We then study the coexistence of\nthese states in the coupled double-dot configuration. In this situation we show\nthat in the trivial phase of the SC2, the Andreev states are bound to an\nindividual quantum dot in the atomic regime (weak interdot coupling) or\nextended over the entire molecule in the molecular regime (strong interdot\ncoupling). More interesting features is actually seen in the topological phase\nof the SC2. In this case, in the atomic limit, the Andreev states appear bound\nto one of the quantum dots while a Majorana zero mode appears in the other one.\nIn the molecular regime, on the other hand, the Andreev bound states take over\nthe entire molecule while the Majorana state remains always bound to one of the\nquantum dots.\n", "  The adsorption of pentacene on Cu(221), Cu(511) and Cu(911) is investigated\nusing density functional theory (DFT) with the self-consistent inclusion of van\nder Waals (vdW) interactions. Cu(211) is a vicinal of Cu(111) while Cu(511) and\n(911) are vicinals of Cu(100). For all the three surfaces, we found pentacene\nto prefer to adsorb parallel to the surface and near the steps. The addition of\nvdW interactions resulted in an enhancement in adsorption energies, with\nreference to the PBE functional, of around 2 eV. With vdWs inclusion, the\nadsorption energies were found to be 2.98 eV, 3.20 eV and 3.49 eV for Cu(211),\nCu(511) and Cu(911) respectively. These values reflect that pentacene adsorbs\nstronger on (100) terraces with a preference for larger terraces. The molecule\ntilts upon adsorption with a small tilt angle on the (100) vicinals (about a\nfew degrees) as compared to a large one on Cu(221) where the tilt angle is\nfound to be about 20o. We find that the adsorption results in a net charge\ntransfer to the molecule of ~1 electron, for all surfaces.\n", "  We report the discovery of two super-Earth-sized planets transiting the\nbright (V = 8.94, K = 7.07) nearby late G-dwarf HD 3167, using data collected\nby the K2 mission. The inner planet, HD 3167 b, has a radius of 1.6 R_e and an\nultra-short orbital period of only 0.96 days. The outer planet, HD 3167 c, has\na radius of 2.9 R_e and orbits its host star every 29.85 days. At a distance of\njust 45.8 +/- 2.2 pc, HD 3167 is one of the closest and brightest stars hosting\nmultiple transiting planets, making HD 3167 b and c well suited for follow-up\nobservations. The star is chromospherically inactive with low rotational\nline-broadening, ideal for radial velocity observations to measure the planets'\nmasses. The outer planet is large enough that it likely has a thick gaseous\nenvelope which could be studied via transmission spectroscopy. Planets\ntransiting bright, nearby stars like HD 3167 are valuable objects to study\nleading up to the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope.\n", "  We present 197 planet candidates discovered using data from the first year of\nthe NASA K2 mission (Campaigns 0-4), along with the results of an intensive\nprogram of photometric analyses, stellar spectroscopy, high-resolution imaging,\nand statistical validation. We distill these candidates into sets of 104\nvalidated planets (57 in multi-planet systems), 30 false positives, and 63\nremaining candidates. Our validated systems span a range of properties, with\nmedian values of R_P = 2.3 R_E, P=8.6 d, Tef = 5300 K, and Kp=12.7 mag. Stellar\nspectroscopy provides precise stellar and planetary parameters for most of\nthese systems. We show that K2 has increased by 30% the number of small planets\nknown to orbit moderately bright stars (1-4 R_E, Kp=9-13 mag). Of particular\ninterest are 37 planets smaller than 2 R_E, 15 orbiting stars brighter than\nKp=11.5, five receiving Earth-like irradiation levels, and several multi-planet\nsystems -- including four planets orbiting the M dwarf K2-72 near mean-motion\nresonances. By quantifying the likelihood that each candidate is a planet we\ndemonstrate that our candidate sample has an overall false positive rate of\n15-30%, with rates substantially lower for small candidates (< 2 R_E) and\nlarger for candidates with radii > 8 R_E and/or with P < 3 d. Extrapolation of\nthe current planetary yield suggests that K2 will discover between 500-1000\nplanets in its planned four-year mission -- assuming sufficient follow-up\nresources are available. Efficient observing and analysis, together with an\norganized and coherent follow-up strategy, is essential to maximize the\nefficacy of planet-validation efforts for K2, TESS, and future large-scale\nsurveys.\n", "  We show how a minimal (littlest) seesaw model involving two right-handed\nneutrinos and a very constrained Dirac mass matrix, with one texture zero and\ntwo independent Dirac masses, may arise from $S_4\\times U(1)$ symmetry in a\nsemi-direct supersymmetric model. The resulting CSD3 form of neutrino mass\nmatrix only depends on two real mass parameters plus one undetermined phase. We\nshow how the phase may be fixed to be one of the cube roots of unity by\nextending the $S_4\\times U(1)$ symmetry to include a product of $Z_3$ factors\ntogether with a CP symmetry, which is spontaneously broken leaving a single\nresidual $Z_3$ in the charged lepton sector and a residual $Z_2$ in the\nneutrino sector, with suppressed higher order corrections. With the phase\nchosen from the cube roots of unity to be $-2\\pi/3$, the model predicts a\nnormal neutrino mass hierarchy with $m_1=0$, reactor angle\n$\\theta_{13}=8.7^\\circ$, solar angle $\\theta_{12}=34^\\circ$, atmospheric angle\n$\\theta_{23}=44^\\circ$, and CP violating oscillation phase $\\delta_{\\rm\nCP}=-93^\\circ$, depending on the fit of the model to the neutrino masses.\n", "  We propose an experimentally feasible scheme for dissipative preparation of\ntripartite entangled state with atoms separately trapped in an array of three\ncoupled cavities. The combination of coherent driving fields and\nquantum-jump-based feedback control will drive the system into a\nnon-equilibrium steady state, which has a nearly perfect overlap with the\ngenuine three-atom singlet state. Different control strategies are investigated\nand the corresponding optimal parameters are confirmed. Moreover, the fidelity\nof target state is insensitive to detection inefficiencies, and it oversteps\n90\\% for a wide range of decoherence parameters as long as the single-atom\ncooperativity parameter $C\\equiv g^2/(\\gamma\\kappa)>350$.\n", "  Molecular cloud structure is regulated by stellar feedback in various forms.\nTwo of the most important feedback processes are UV photoionisation and\nsupernovae from massive stars. However, the precise response of the cloud to\nthese processes, and the interaction between them, remains an open question. In\nparticular, we wish to know under which conditions the cloud can be dispersed\nby feedback, which in turn can give us hints as to how feedback regulates the\nstar formation inside the cloud. We perform a suite of radiative\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulations of a 10^5 solar mass cloud with embedded\nsources of ionising radiation and supernovae, including multiple supernovae and\na hypernova model. A UV source corresponding to 10% of the mass of the cloud is\nrequired to disperse the cloud, suggesting that the star formation efficiency\nshould be on the order of 10%. A single supernova is unable to significantly\naffect the evolution of the cloud. However, energetic hypernovae and multiple\nsupernovae are able to add significant quantities of momentum to the cloud,\napproximately 10^{43} g cm/s of momentum per 10^{51} ergs of supernova energy.\nThis is on the lower range of estimates in other works, since dense gas clumps\nthat remain embedded inside the HII region cause rapid cooling in the supernova\nblast. We argue that supernovae alone are unable to regulate star formation in\nmolecular clouds, and that strong pre-supernova feedback is required to allow\nsupernova blastwaves to propagate efficiently into the interstellar medium\n", "  These notes offer an introduction to the functorial and algebraic description\nof 2-dimensional topological quantum field theories `with defects', assuming\nonly superficial familiarity with closed TQFTs in terms of commutative\nFrobenius algebras. The generalisation of this relation is a construction of\npivotal 2-categories from defect TQFTs. We review this construction in detail,\nflanked by a range of examples. Furthermore we explain how open/closed TQFTs\nare equivalent to Calabi-Yau categories and the Cardy condition, and how to\nextract such data from pivotal 2-categories.\n", "  Over the years many He-He interaction potentials have been developed, some\nvery sophisticated, including various corrections beyond Born-Oppenheimer\napproximation. Most of them were used to predict properties of helium dimers\nand trimers, examples of exotic quantum states, whose experimental study proved\nto be very challenging. Recently, detailed structural properties of helium\ntrimers were measured for the first time, allowing a comparison with\ntheoretical predictions and possibly enabling the evaluation of different\ninteraction potentials. The comparisons already made included adjusting the\nmaxima of both theoretical and experimental correlation functions to one, so\nthe overall agreement between theory and experiment appeared satisfactory.\nHowever, no attempt was made to evaluate the quality of the interaction\npotentials used in the calculations. In this work, we calculate the\nexperimentally measured correlation functions using both new and old\npotentials, compare them with experimental data and rank the potentials. We use\ndiffusion Monte Carlo simulations at $T=0\\ \\mathrm{K}$, which give within\nstatistical noise exact results of the ground state properties. All models\npredict both trimers $^4\\mathrm{He}_{3}$ and $^4\\mathrm{He}_2{}^3\\mathrm{He}$\nto be in a quantum halo state.\n", "  The superconductivity and intercalation statein the lithium-and\nhexamethylenediamine (HMDA)-intercalated superconductor\nLi$_x$(C$_6$H$_{16}$N$_2$)$_y$Fe$_{2-z}$Se$_2$ have been investigated from\npowder x-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric and magnetic susceptibility\nmeasurements, changing the intercalation temperature, $T_i$, and the Li\ncontent, $x$. Both Li and HMDA have been co-intercalated stably up to $x$ = 2\nroughly in the molar ratio of $x : y = 2 : 1$. In the case of $T_i$ =\n45$^\\circ$C, it has been found that both Li and HMDA are co-intercalated\nlocally at the edge of FeSe crystals, indicating that both Li and HMDA are hard\nto diffuse into the inside of FeSe crystals at 45$^\\circ$C. In the case of\n$T_i$ = 100$^\\circ$C, on the other hand, it has been found that both Li and\nHMDA diffuse into the inside of FeSe crystals, so that $T_c$ tends to increase\nwith increasing $x$ from ~30 K at $x$ = 1 up to 38 K at $x$ = 2 owing to the\nincrease of electron carriers doped from Li into the FeSe layers.\n", "  Gravitational lensing has long been considered as a valuable tool to\ndetermine the total mass of galaxy clusters. The shear profile as inferred from\nthe statistics of ellipticity of background galaxies allows to probe the\ncluster intermediate and outer regions thus determining the virial mass\nestimate. However, the mass sheet degeneracy and the need for a large number of\nbackground galaxies motivate the search for alternative tracers which can break\nthe degeneracy among model parameters and hence improve the accuracy of the\nmass estimate. Lensing flexion, i.e. the third derivative of the lensing\npotential, has been suggested as a good answer to the above quest since it\nprobes the details of the mass profile. We investigate here whether this is\nindeed the case considering jointly using weak lensing, magnification and\nflexion. We use a Fisher matrix analysis to forecast the relative improvement\nin the mass accuracy for different assumptions on the shear and flexion signal\n- to - noise (S/N) ratio also varying the cluster mass, redshift, and\nellipticity. It turns out that the error on the cluster mass may be reduced up\nto a factor 2 for reasonable values of the flexion S/N ratio. As a general\nresult, we get that the improvement in mass accuracy is larger for more\nflattened haloes, but extracting general trends is a difficult because of the\nmany parameters at play. We nevertheless find that flexion is as efficient as\nmagnification to increase the accuracy in both mass and concentration\ndetermination.\n", "  We determine the asymptotic conditions under which the Boussinesq\napproximation is valid for oscillatory convection in a rapidly rotating fluid.\nIn the astrophysically relevant parameter regime of small Prandtl number, we\nshow that the Boussinesq prediction for the onset of convection is valid only\nunder much more restrictive conditions than those that are usually assumed. In\nthe case of an ideal gas, we recover the Boussinesq results only if the ratio\nof the domain height to a typical scale height is much smaller than the Prandtl\nnumber. This requires an extremely shallow domain in the astrophysical\nparameter regime. Other commonly-used \"sound-proof\" approximations generally\nperform no better than the Boussinesq approximation. The exception is a\nparticular implementation of the pseudo-incompressible approximation, which\npredicts the correct instability threshold beyond the range of validity of the\nBoussinesq approximation.\n", "  We show how two electrically coupled semiconductor lasers having optical\nfeedback can present simultaneous anti-phase correlated fast power\nfluctuations, and strong in-phase synchronized spikes of chaotic power drops.\nThis quite counter intuitive phenomenon is demonstrated experimentally and\nconfirmed by numerical solutions of a deterministic dynamical system of rate\nequations. The occurrence of negative and positive cross correlation between\nparts of a complex system according to time scales, as proved in our simple\narrangement, is relevant for the understanding and characterization of\ncollective properties in complex networks.\n", "  The CO+ reactive ion is thought to be a tracer of the boundary between a HII\nregion and the hot molecular gas. In this study, we present the spatial\ndistribution of the CO+ rotational emission toward the Mon R2 star-forming\nregion. The CO+ emission presents a clumpy ring-like morphology, arising from a\nnarrow dense layer around the HII region. We compare the CO+ distribution with\nother species present in photon-dominated regions (PDR), such as [CII] 158 mm,\nH2 S(3) rotational line at 9.3 mm, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and\nHCO+. We find that the CO+ emission is spatially coincident with the PAHs and\n[CII] emission. This confirms that the CO+ emission arises from a narrow dense\nlayer of the HI/H2 interface. We have determined the CO+ fractional abundance,\nrelative to C+ toward three positions. The abundances range from 0.1 to\n1.9x10^(-10) and are in good agreement with previous chemical model, which\npredicts that the production of CO+ in PDRs only occurs in dense regions with\nhigh UV fields. The CO+ linewidth is larger than those found in molecular gas\ntracers, and their central velocity are blue-shifted with respect to the\nmolecular gas velocity. We interpret this as a hint that the CO+ is probing\nphoto-evaporating clump surfaces.\n", "  Large-scale gaseous filaments with length up to the order of 100 pc are on\nthe upper end of the filamentary hierarchy of the Galactic interstellar medium.\nTheir association with respect to the Galactic structure and their role in\nGalactic star formation are of great interest from both observational and\ntheoretical point of view. Previous \"by-eye\" searches, combined together, have\nstarted to uncover the Galactic distribution of large filaments, yet inherent\nbias and small sample size limit conclusive statistical results to be drawn.\nHere, we present (1) a new, automated method to identify large-scale\nvelocity-coherent dense filaments, and (2) the first statistics and the\nGalactic distribution of these filaments. We use a customized minimum spanning\ntree algorithm to identify filaments by connecting voxels in the\nposition-position-velocity space, using the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey\nspectroscopic catalog. In the range of $7.^{\\circ}5 \\le l \\le 194^{\\circ}$, we\nhave identified 54 large-scale filaments and derived mass ($\\sim 10^3 - 10^5 \\,\nM_\\odot$), length (10-276 pc), linear mass density (54-8625 $M_\\odot \\,\n\\rm{pc}^{-1}$), aspect ratio, linearity, velocity gradient, temperature,\nfragmentation, Galactic location and orientation angle. The filaments\nconcentrate along major spiral arms. They are widely distributed across the\nGalactic disk, with 50% located within $\\pm$20 pc from the Galactic mid-plane\nand 27% run in the center of spiral arms (aka \"bones\"). An order of 1% of the\nmolecular ISM is confined in large filaments. Massive star formation is more\nfavorable in large filaments compared to elsewhere. This is the first\ncomprehensive catalog of large filaments useful for a quantitative comparison\nwith spiral structures and numerical simulations.\n", "  We explore the relationship between active galactic nuclei and star formation\nin a sample of 513 optically luminous type 1 quasars up to redshifts of $\\sim$4\nhosting extremely high star formation rates (SFRs). The quasars are selected to\nbe individually detected by the \\textit{Herschel} SPIRE instrument at $>\n$3$\\sigma$ at 250 $\\mu$m, leading to typical SFRs of order of 1000\nM$_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$. We find the average SFRs to increase by almost a factor\n10 from $z\\sim0.5$ to $z\\sim3$, mirroring the rise in the comoving SFR density\nover the same epoch. However, we find that the SFRs remain approximately\nconstant with increasing accretion luminosity for accretion luminosities above\n10$^{12}$ L$_{\\odot}$. We also find that the SFRs do not correlate with black\nhole mass. Both of these results are most plausibly explained by the existence\nof a self-regulation process by the starburst at high SFRs, which controls SFRs\non time-scales comparable to or shorter than the AGN or starburst duty cycles.\nWe additionally find that SFRs do not depend on Eddington ratio at any\nredshift, consistent with no relation between SFR and black hole growth rate\nper unit black hole mass. Finally, we find that high-ionisation broad\nabsorption line (HiBAL) quasars have indistinguishable far-infrared properties\nto those of classical quasars, consistent with HiBAL quasars being normal\nquasars observed along a particular line of sight, with the outflows in HiBAL\nquasars not having any measurable effect on the star formation in their hosts.\n", "  We present medium-resolution, near-ultraviolet VLT/FLAMES observations of the\nstar USNO-A0600-15865535. We adapt a standard method of stellar typing to our\nmeasurement of the shape of the Balmer epsilon absorption line to demonstrates\nthat USNO-A0600-15865535 is a blue horizontal branch star, residing in the\nlower stellar halo at a distance of 4.4 kpc from the Sun. We measure the H & K\nlines of singly-ionized calcium and find two isolated velocity components, one\noriginating in the disk, and one associated with high-velocity cloud complex\nWD. This detection demonstrated that complex WD is closer than ~4.4 kpc and is\nthe first distance constraint on the +100 km/s Galactic complex of clouds. We\nfind that Complex WD is not in corotation with the Galactic disk as has been\nassumed for decades. We examine a number of scenarios, and find that the most\nlikely is that Complex WD was ejected from the solar neighborhood and is only a\nfew kpc from the Sun.\n", "  It is pointed out that the ground state of n neutrons and n protons in a\nsingle-j shell, interacting through an isoscalar (T=0) pairing force, is not\npaired, J=0, but rather spin-aligned, J=n. This observation is explained in the\ncontext of a model of isoscalar P (J=1) pairs, which is mapped onto a system of\np bosons, leading to an approximate analytic solution of the isoscalar-pairing\nlimit in jj coupling.\n", "  R-matrix with time-dependence theory is applied to electron-impact ionisation\nprocesses for He in the S-wave model. Cross sections for electron-impact\nexcitation, ionisation and ionisation with excitation for impact energies\nbetween 25 and 225 eV are in excellent agreement with benchmark cross sections.\nUltra-fast dynamics induced by a scattering event is observed through\ntime-dependent signatures associated with autoionisation from doubly excited\nstates. Further insight into dynamics can be obtained through examination of\nthe spin components of the time-dependent wavefunction.\n", "  A new approach for fabricating open and closed porous structures based on\nlaser processing is presented. Liquid polyimide (PI) was mixed with\nazodicarbonamide (ADC, ADA) which is a chemical blowing agent (CBA) and mixture\nwas pre-cured in order to fabricate solid PI film. Porous PI was prepared by\nirradiating PI film mixed with azodicarbonamide. The PI film with\nazodicarbonamide was etched by laser ablation, and the CBA was decomposed by\nheat induced by the absorbed laser energy. The higher the laser beam\nirradiation, the more pores were fabricated due to the resulting increase in\nCBA decomposition from 27 mJ/cm2 to 40 mJ/cm2 per single pulse. Higher fluence\nat about 50 mJ/cm2 resulted in fewer and larger open pores, which were formed\nby the coalescence of small pores. In contrast, a closed porous structure was\nfabricated at a fluence of less than 1 mJ/cm2 because PI was barely etched. The\nproposed method can be sued to create open and closed micro porous structures\nselectively, and is not limited to thermosetting polymers, but is also\neffective with thermoplastic polymers.\n", "  The pentaquark $P_c^+(4450)$ recently discovered by LHCb has been interpreted\nas a bound state of $\\Psi(2S)$ and nucleon. The charmonium-nucleon interaction\nwhich provides the binding mechanism is given, in the heavy quark limit, in\nterms of charmonium chromoelectric polarizabilities and densities of the\nnucleon energy-momentum tensor (EMT). In this work we show in model-independent\nway, by exploring general properties of the effective interaction, that\n$\\Psi(2S)$ can form bound states with nucleon and $\\Delta$. Using the Skyrme\nmodel to evaluate the effective interaction in the large-$N_c$ limit and\nestimate $1/N_c$ corrections, we confirm the results from prior work which were\nbased on a different effective model (chiral quark soliton model). This shows\nthat the interpretation of $P_c^+(4450)$ is remarkably robust and weakly\ndependent on the details of the effective theories for the nucleon EMT. We\nexplore the formalism further and present robust predictions of isospin\n$\\frac32$ bound states of $\\Psi(2S)$ and $\\Delta$ with masses around $4.5\\,{\\rm\nGeV}$ and widths around $70\\,{\\rm MeV}$. The approach also predicts broader\nresonances in the $\\Psi(2S)$-$\\Delta$ channel at $4.9\\,{\\rm GeV}$ with widths\nof the order of $150\\,{\\rm MeV}$. We discuss in which reactions these new\nisospin $\\frac 32$ pentaquarks with hidden charm can be observed.\n", "  High-speed solar wind streams emanating from coronal holes are frequently\nimpinging on the Earth's magnetosphere causing recurrent, medium-level\ngeomagnetic storm activity. Modeling high-speed solar wind streams is thus an\nessential element of successful space weather forecasting. Here we evaluate\nhigh-speed stream forecasts made by the empirical solar wind forecast (ESWF)\nand the semiempirical Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA) model based on the in situ plasma\nmeasurements from the ACE spacecraft for the years 2011 to 2014. While the ESWF\nmakes use of an empirical relation between the coronal hole area observed in\nSolar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) images and\nsolar wind properties at the near-Earth environment, the WSA model establishes\na link between properties of the open magnetic field lines extending from the\nphotosphere to the corona and the background solar wind conditions. We found\nthat both solar wind models are capable of predicting the large-scale features\nof the observed solar wind speed (root-mean-square error, RMSE $\\approx$ 100\nkm/s) but tend to either overestimate (ESWF) or underestimate (WSA) the number\nof high-speed solar wind streams (threat score, TS $\\approx$ 0.37). The\npredicted high-speed streams show typical uncertainties in the arrival time of\nabout 1 day and uncertainties in the speed of about 100 km/s. General\nadvantages and disadvantages of the investigated solar wind models are\ndiagnosed and outlined.\n", "  Fairall 9 is one of several type 1 active galactic nuclei for which it has\nbeen claimed that the angular momentum (or spin) of the supermassive black hole\ncan be robustly measured, using the Fe K$\\alpha$ emission line and\nCompton-reflection continuum in the X-ray spectrum. The method rests upon the\ninterpretation of the Fe K$\\alpha$ line profile and associated\nCompton-reflection continuum in terms of relativistic broadening in the strong\ngravity regime in the innermost regions of an accretion disc, within a few\ngravitational radii of the black hole. Here, we re-examine a Suzaku X-ray\nspectrum of Fairall 9 and show that a face-on toroidal X-ray reprocessor model\ninvolving only nonrelativistic and mundane physics provides an excellent fit to\nthe data. The Fe K$\\alpha$ line emission and Compton reflection continuum are\ncalculated self-consistently, the iron abundance is solar, and an equatorial\ncolumn density of $\\sim 10^{24} \\ \\rm cm^{-2}$ is inferred. In this scenario,\nneither the Fe K$\\alpha$ line, nor the Compton-reflection continuum provide any\ninformation on the black-hole spin. Whereas previous analyses have assumed an\ninfinite column density for the distant-matter reprocessor, the shape of the\nreflection spectrum from matter with a finite column density eliminates the\nneed for a relativistically broadened Fe K$\\alpha$ line. We find a 90 per cent\nconfidence range in the Fe K$\\alpha$ line FWHM of $1895$-$6205 \\ \\rm km \\\ns^{-1}$, corresponding to a distance of $\\sim 3100$ to $33,380$ gravitational\nradii from the black hole, or $0.015$-$0.49$ pc for a black-hole mass of $\\sim\n1-3 \\times 10^{8} \\ M_{\\odot}$.\n", "  The excitation function and momentum distribution of {\\eta}' mesons have been\nmeasured in photoproduction off 93^Nb in the energy range of 1.2-2.9 GeV. The\nexperiment has been performed with the combined Crystal Barrel and MiniTAPS\ndetector system, using tagged photon beams from the ELSA electron accelerator.\nInformation on the sign and magnitude of the real part of the {\\eta}'-Nb\npotential has been extracted from a comparison of the data with model\ncalculations. An attractive potential of -(41 \\pm 10(stat) \\pm 15(syst)) MeV\ndepth at normal nuclear matter density is deduced within model uncertainties.\nThis value is consistent with the potential depth of -(37 \\pm 10(stat) \\pm\n10(syst)) MeV obtained in an earlier measurement for a light nucleus (carbon).\nThis relatively shallow {\\eta}'-nucleus potential will make the search for\n{\\eta}'-nucleus bound states more difficult.\n", "  Observations of massive outflows with detectable central AGN typically find\nthem within radii $\\lesssim 10$ kpc. We show that this apparent size\nrestriction is a natural result of AGN driving if this process injects total\nenergy only of order the gas binding energy to the outflow, and the AGN varies\nover time (`flickers') as suggested in recent work. After the end of all AGN\nactivity the outflow continues to expand to larger radii, powered by the\nthermal expansion of the remnant shocked AGN wind. We suggest that on average,\noutflows should be detected further from the nucleus in more massive galaxies.\nIn massive gas--rich galaxies these could be several tens of kpc in radius. We\nalso consider the effect that pressure of such outflows has on a galaxy disc.\nIn moderately gas--rich discs, with gas-to-baryon fraction $< 0.2$, the outflow\nmay induce star formation significant enough to be distinguished from quiescent\nby an apparently different normalisation of the Kennicutt-Schmidt law. The star\nformation enhancement is probably stronger in the outskirts of galaxy discs, so\ncoasting outflows might be detected by their effects upon the disc even after\nthe driving AGN has shut off. We compare our results to the recent inference of\ninside--out quenching of star formation in galaxy discs.\n", "  We report the WIMP dark matter search results using the first physics-run\ndata of the PandaX-II 500 kg liquid xenon dual-phase time-projection chamber,\noperating at the China JinPing Underground Laboratory. No dark matter candidate\nis identified above background. In combination with the data set during the\ncommissioning run, with a total exposure of 3.3$\\times10^4$ kg-day,the most\nstringent limit to the spin-independent interaction between the ordinary and\nWIMP dark matter is set for a range of dark matter mass between 3.5 and 1000\nGeV/c$^2$. The best upper limit on the scattering cross section is found\n$2.5\\times 10^{-46}$ cm$^2$ for the WIMP mass 40 GeV/c$^2$ at 90% confidence\nlevel.\n", "  We report measurements of energy-dependent attosecond photoionization delays\nbetween the two outer-most valence shells of N$_2$O and H$_2$O. The combination\nof single-shot signal referencing with the use of different metal foils to\nfilter the attosecond pulse train enables us to extract delays from congested\nspectra. Remarkably large delays up to 160 as are observed in N$_2$O, whereas\nthe delays in H$_2$O are all smaller than 50 as in the photon-energy range of\n20-40 eV. These results are interpreted by developing a theory of molecular\nphotoionization delays. The long delays measured in N$_2$O are shown to reflect\nthe population of molecular shape resonances that trap the photoelectron for a\nduration of up to $\\sim$110 as. The unstructured continua of H$_2$O result in\nmuch smaller delays at the same photon energies. Our experimental and\ntheoretical methods make the study of molecular attosecond photoionization\ndynamics accessible.\n", "  The photometric sky quality of Mt. Shatdzhatmaz, the site of Sternberg\nAstronomical Institute Caucasian Observatory 2.5 m telescope, is characterized\nhere by the statistics of the night-time sky brightness and extinction. The\ndata were obtained as a by-product of atmospheric optical turbulence\nmeasurements with the MASS (Multi-Aperture Scintillation Sensor) device\nconducted in 2007--2013. The factors biasing night-sky brightness measurements\nare considered and a technique to reduce their impact on the statistics is\nproposed.\n  The single-band photometric estimations provided by MASS are easy to\ntransform to the standard photometric bands. The median moonless night-sky\nbrightness is 22.1, 21.1, 20.3, and 19.0 mag per square arcsec for the $B$,\n$V$, $R$, and $I$ spectral bands, respectively. The median extinction\ncoefficients for the same photometric bands are 0.28, 0.17, 0.13, and 0.09 mag.\nThe best atmospheric transparency is observed in winter.\n", "  We present the results of the optical follow-up conducted by the TOROS\ncollaboration of the first gravitational-wave event GW150914. We conducted\nunfiltered CCD observations (0.35-1 micron) with the 1.5-m telescope at Bosque\nAlegre starting ~2.5 days after the alarm. Given our limited field of view\n(~100 square arcmin), we targeted 14 nearby galaxies that were observable from\nthe site and were located within the area of higher localization probability.\n  We analyzed the observations using two independent implementations of\ndifference-imaging algorithms, followed by a Random-Forest-based algorithm to\ndiscriminate between real and bogus transients. We did not find any bona fide\ntransient event in the surveyed area down to a 5-sigma limiting magnitude of\nr=21.7 mag (AB). Our result is consistent with the LIGO detection of a binary\nblack hole merger, for which no electromagnetic counterparts are expected, and\nwith the expected rates of other astrophysical transients.\n", "  We used Planck data to study the M33 galaxy and find a substantial\ntemperature asymmetry with respect to its minor axis projected onto the sky\nplane. This temperature asymmetry correlates well with the HI velocity field at\n21 cm, at least within a galactocentric distance of 0.5 degree, and it is found\nto extend up to about 3 degrees from the galaxy center. We conclude that the\nrevealed effect, that is, the temperature asymmetry and its extension, implies\nthat we detected the differential rotation of the M33 galaxy and of its\nextended baryonic halo.\n", "  Gaseous and dust debris disks around white dwarfs (WDs) are formed from\ntidally disrupted planetary bodies. This offers an opportunity to determine the\ncomposition of exoplanetary material by measuring element abundances in the\naccreting WD's atmosphere. A more direct way to do this is through spectral\nanalysis of the disks themselves. Currently, the number of chemical elements\ndetected through disk emission-lines is smaller than that of species detected\nthrough lines in the WD atmospheres.\n  We assess the far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectrum of one well-studied object (SDSS\nJ122859.93+104032.9) to search for disk signatures at wavelengths <1050\nangstrom, where the broad absorption lines of the Lyman series effectively\nblock the WD photospheric flux. We performed FUV observations (950-1240\nangstrom) with the Hubble Space Telescope/Cosmic Origins Spectrograph and used\narchival optical spectra. We compared them with non-local thermodynamic\nequilibrium model spectra. In addition, we investigate the Ca II infrared\ntriplet (IRT) line profiles to constrain disk geometry and composition.\n  No disk emission-lines were detected in the FUV spectrum, indicating that the\ndisk effective temperature is about 5000K. The long-time variability of the Ca\nII IRT was reproduced with a precessing disk model of bulk Earth-like\ncomposition, having a surface mass density of 0.3g/cm2 and an extension from 55\nto 90 WD radii. The disk has a spiral shape that precesses with a period of\napproximately 37 years, confirming previous results.\n", "  The power spectrum of the X-ray fluctuations of accreting black holes often\nconsists of two broad humps. We quantitatively investigate the hypothesis that\nthe lower frequency hump orig- inates from variability in a truncated thin\naccretion disc, propagating into a large scale-height inner hot flow which, in\nturn, itself is the origin of the higher frequency hump. We extend the\npropagating mass accretion rate fluctuations model PROPFLUC to accommodate\ndouble hump power spectra in this way. Furthermore, we extend the model to\npredict the cross-spectrum between two energy bands in addition to their power\nspectra, allowing us to constrain the model using the observed time lags, which\nin the model result from both propagation of fluc- tuations from the disc to\nthe hot flow, and inside the hot flow. We jointly fit soft and hard power\nspectrum, and the cross-spectrum between the two bands using this model for 5\nSwift X-ray Telescope observations of MAXI J1659-152. The new double hump model\nprovides a better fit to the data than the old single hump model for most of\nour observations. The data show only a small phase lag associated with the low\nfrequency hump. We demonstrate quan- titatively that this is consistent with\nthe model. We compare the truncation radius measured from our fits with that\nmeasured purely by spectral fitting and find agreement within a factor of two.\nThis analysis encompasses the first joint fits of stellar-mass black hole\ncross-spectra and power spectra with a single self-consistent physical model.\n", "  Quantum position verification (QPV) is the art of verifying the geographical\nlocation of an untrusted party. Recently, it has been shown that the widely\nstudied Bennett & Brassard 1984 (BB84) QPV protocol is insecure after the 3 dB\nloss point assuming local operations and classical communication (LOCC)\nadversaries. Here, we propose a time-reversed entanglement swapping QPV\nprotocol (based on measurement-device-independent quantum cryptography) that is\nhighly robust against quantum channel loss. First, assuming ideal qubit\nsources, we show that the protocol is secure against LOCC adversaries for any\nquantum channel loss, thereby overcoming the 3 dB loss limit. Then, we analyze\nthe security of the protocol in a more practical setting involving weak laser\nsources and linear optics. In this setting, we find that the security only\ndegrades by an additive constant and the protocol is able to verify positions\nup to 47 dB channel loss.\n", "  Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) is an optical\nfiber-bundle integral-field unit (IFU) spectroscopic survey that is one of\nthree core programs in the fourth-generation Sloan Digital Sky Survey\n(SDSS-IV). With a spectral coverage of 3622 - 10,354 Angstroms and an average\nfootprint of ~ 500 arcsec^2 per IFU the scientific data products derived from\nMaNGA will permit exploration of the internal structure of a statistically\nlarge sample of 10,000 low redshift galaxies in unprecedented detail.\nComprising 174 individually pluggable science and calibration IFUs with a\nnear-constant data stream, MaNGA is expected to obtain ~ 100 million raw-frame\nspectra and ~ 10 million reduced galaxy spectra over the six-year lifetime of\nthe survey. In this contribution, we describe the MaNGA Data Reduction Pipeline\n(DRP) algorithms and centralized metadata framework that produces\nsky-subtracted, spectrophotometrically calibrated spectra and rectified 3-D\ndata cubes that combine individual dithered observations. For the 1390 galaxy\ndata cubes released in Summer 2016 as part of SDSS-IV Data Release 13 (DR13),\nwe demonstrate that the MaNGA data have nearly Poisson-limited sky subtraction\nshortward of ~ 8500 Angstroms and reach a typical 10-sigma limiting continuum\nsurface brightness mu = 23.5 AB/arcsec^2 in a five arcsec diameter aperture in\nthe g band. The wavelength calibration of the MaNGA data is accurate to 5 km/s\nrms, with a median spatial resolution of 2.54 arcsec FWHM (1.8 kpc at the\nmedian redshift of 0.037) and a median spectral resolution of sigma = 72 km/s.\n", "  We report measurements of the magnetic susceptibility of twinned single\ncrystals of YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{6+x}$ from just above their superconducting\ntransition temperatures to 300 K with magnetic fields of up to 5 T applied\nparallel and perpendicular to the CuO$_2$ planes at 7 values of $x$.\nAppropriate analysis allows the relatively small, but still important, Curie\nterms to be separated from other contributions to the susceptibility. Our data\nsupport a picture in which the Curie terms arise from oxygen disorder in the\nCu-O chains. This agrees with published work on polycrystalline samples where\nthe sample cooling rate was varied, but here we show that the Curie plots\nflatten out above 200 K. We identify small effects of charge density wave (CDW)\ninstabilities in the temperature ($T$) derivative of the in-plane\nsusceptibility $d\\chi_{ab}(T)/dT$ and discuss their $x$-dependence. For\n$x=$0.67 we make a detailed comparison with published high energy X-ray\ndiffraction data using a minimal model involving Fermi arcs, thereby obtaining\nvalues for the CDW energy gap and the Helmholtz free energy in a coherence\nvolume. At 80 and 100 K the latter is comparable with, or smaller than $k_BT$\nrespectively, highlighting the probable importance of thermal fluctuations. We\nnote that the effect of the Lorentz force on charge carriers in the Fermi arcs\ncould provide a simple mechanism for enhancing the CDWs in high magnetic\nfields, as suggested by recent experiments.\n", "  Based on ab initio calculations we determine the features and relative\nstability of different models proposed to describe the $(2 \\times 2)$-FeO(111)\nreconstruction. Our results suggest that both wurtzite and spinel-like\nenvironments are possible, and their coexistence explains phenomena of biphase\nordering. The surface phase diagram reflects a competition of charge and\nmagnetic compensation effects, and reveals the important influence of the\nsubstrate on the final surface structure. Though antiferromagnetic couplings\nare dominant, frustration and the delicate balance of surface and bulk exchange\ninteractions lead to a net surface magnetization that accounts for the large\nmeasured values.\n", "  We report on the discovery of 41 new pulsating sources in the data of the\nChandra Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer, which is sensitive to X-ray photons\nin the 0.3-10 keV band. The archival data of the first 15 years of Chandra\nobservations were retrieved and analysed by means of fast Fourier transforms,\nemploying a peak-detection algorithm able to screen candidate signals in an\nautomatic fashion. We carried out the search for new X-ray pulsators in light\ncurves with more than 50 photons, for a total of about 190,000 lightcurves out\nof about 430,000 extracted. With these numbers, the ChAndra Timing Survey at\nBrera And Roma astronomical observatories (CATS@BAR) - as we called the project\n- represents the largest ever systematic search for coherent signals in the\nclassic X-ray band. More than 50 per cent of the signals were confirmed by\nfurther Chandra (for those sources with two or more pointings), XMM-Newton or\nROSAT data. The period distribution of the new X-ray pulsators above about\n2,000s resembles that of cataclysmic variables, while there is a paucity of\nsources with shorter period and low fluxes. Since there is not an obvious bias\nagainst these detections, a possible interpretation is in terms of a magnetic\ngating mechanism in accreting neutron stars. Finally, we note that CATS@BAR is\na living project and the detection algorithm will continue to be routinely\napplied to the new Chandra data as they become public. Based on the results\nobtained so far, we expect to discover about three new pulsators every year.\n", "  We present analytical and numerical results on the joint dynamics of two\ncoupled Duffing oscillators with nonlinearity of opposite signs (hardening and\nsoftening). In particular, we focus on the existence and stability of\nsynchronized oscillations where the frequency is independent of the amplitude.\nIn this regime, the amplitude--frequency interdependence (a--f effect) ---a\nnoxious consequence of nonlinearity, which jeopardizes the use of\nmicromechanical oscillators in the design of time--keeping devices--- is\nsuppressed. By means of a multiple time scale formulation, we find approximate\nconditions under which frequency stabilization is achieved, characterize the\nstability of the resulting oscillations, and compare with numerical solutions\nto the equations of motion.\n", "  When quantum fluctuations destroy underlying long-range ordered states, novel\nquantum states emerge. Spin-liquid (SL) states of frustrated quantum\nantiferromagnets, in which highly-correlated spins keep to fluctuate down to\nvery low temperatures, are prominent examples of such quantum states. SL states\noften exhibit exotic physical properties, but the precise nature of the\nelementary excitations behind such phenomena remains entirely elusive. Here we\nutilize thermal Hall measurements that can capture the unexplored property of\nthe elementary excitations in SL states, and report on the observation of\nanomalous excitations that may unveil the unique features of the SL state. Our\nprincipal finding is a negative thermal Hall conductivity (k_xy) which the\ncharge-neutral spin excitations in a gapless SL state of the two-dimensional\nkagome insulator volborthite Cu_3V_2O_7(OH)_2 \\cdot 2H_2O exhibit, in much the\nsame way in which charged electrons give rise to the conventional electric Hall\neffect. We find that k_xy is absent in the high-temperature paramagnetic state\nand develops upon entering the SL state in accordance with the growth of the\nshort-range spin correlations, demonstrating that k_xy is a key signature of\nthe elementary excitation formed in the SL state. These results suggest the\nemergence of nontrivial elementary excitations in the gapless SL state which\nfeel the presence of fictitious magnetic flux, whose effective Lorentz force is\nfound to be less than 1/100 of that experienced by free electrons.\n", "  An early-type, massive, short-period ($P_{\\rm orb}=2^{\\rm d}.310951$)\neclipsing spectroscopic binary DN Cas has been re-visited with new spectral and\nphotometric data. The masses and radii of the components have been obtained as\n$M_1=19.04\\pm0.07 M_\\odot$, $M_2=13.73\\pm 0.05M_\\odot$ and $R_1=7.22\\pm0.06\nR_\\odot$, $R_2=5.79\\pm0.06R_\\odot$, respectively. Both components present\nsynchronous rotation ($V_{\\rm rot1}=160\\,$km s$^{-1}$, $V_{\\rm rot2}=130\\,$km\ns$^{-1}$) with their orbit. Orbital period analysis yielded a physically bound\nadditional component in the system with a minimum mass of $M_3=0.88 M_\\odot$\norbiting in an eccentric orbit ($e=0.37\\pm0.2$) with an orbital period of\n$P_{12}=42\\pm9$ yrs. High precision absolute parameters of the system allowed\nus to derive a distance to DN Cas as 1.7$\\pm$0.2 kpc which locates the system\nwithin the borders of the Cas OB6 association (d=1.8 kpc; Mel'nik & Dambis,\n2009). The space velocities and the age of DN Cas are in agreement with those\nof Cas OB6. The age of DN Cas ($\\tau=$3-5 Myr) is found to be 1-2 Myr older\nthan the embedded clusters (IC 1795, IC 1805 and IC 1848) in the Cas OB6\nassociation, which implies a sequential star formation in the association.\n", "  A proper treatment of electrostatic interactions is crucial for the accurate\ncalculation of forces in computer simulations. Electrostatic interactions are\ntypically modeled using Ewald based methods, which have become one of the\ncornerstones upon which many other methods for the numerical computation of\nelectrostatic interactions are based. However, their use with charge\ndistributions rather than point charges requires the inclusion of ansatz for\nthe solutions of the Poisson equation, since there is no exact solution known\nfor smeared out charges. The interest for incorporating electrostatic\ninteractions at the scales of length and time that are relevant for the study\nthe physics of soft condensed matter has increased considerably. Using\nmesoscale simulation techniques, such as dissipative particle dynamics (DPD),\nallows us to reach longer time scales in numerical simulations, without\nabandoning the particulate description of the problem. The main problem with\nincorporating electrostatics into DPD simulations is that DPD particles are\nsoft and those particles with opposite charge can form artificial clusters of\nions. Here we show that one can incorporate the electrostatic interactions\nthrough Ewald sums with point charges in DPD if larger values of coarse\ngraining degree are used, where DPD is truly mesoscopic. Using point charges\nwith larger excluded volume interactions the artificial formation of ionic\npairs with point charges can be avoided, and one obtains correct predictions.\nWe establish ranges of parameters useful for detecting boundaries where\nartificial formation of ionic pairs occurs. Lastly, using point charges we\npredict the scaling properties of polyelectrolytes in solvents of varying\nquality and obtain predictions that are in agreement with calculations that use\nother methods, and with recent experimental results.\n", "  Present-day Venus is an inhospitable place with surface temperatures\napproaching 750K and an atmosphere over 90 times as thick as present day\nEarth's. Billions of years ago the picture may have been very different. We\nhave created a suite of 3D climate simulations using topographic data from the\nMagellan mission, solar spectral irradiance estimates for 2.9 and 0.715 billion\nyears ago, present day Venus orbital parameters, an ocean volume consistent\nwith current theory and measurements, and an atmospheric composition estimated\nfor early Venus. Using these parameters we find that such a world could have\nhad moderate temperatures if Venus had a rotation period slower than about 16\nEarth days, despite an incident solar flux 46-70% higher than modern Earth\nreceives. At its current rotation period of 243 days, Venus's climate could\nhave remained habitable until at least 715 million years ago if it hosted a\nshallow primordial ocean. These results demonstrate the vital role that\nrotation and topography play in understanding the climatic history of\nexoplanetary Venus-like worlds being discovered in the present epoch.\n", "  We describe the performance of the Boolardy Engineering Test Array (BETA),\nthe prototype for the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder telescope\nASKAP. BETA is the first aperture synthesis radio telescope to use phased array\nfeed technology, giving it the ability to electronically form up to nine\ndual-polarization beams. We report the methods developed for forming and\nmeasuring the beams, and the adaptations that have been made to the traditional\ncalibration and imaging procedures in order to allow BETA to function as a\nmulti-beam aperture synthesis telescope. We describe the commissioning of the\ninstrument and present details of BETA's performance: sensitivity, beam\ncharacteristics, polarimetric properties and image quality. We summarise the\nastronomical science that it has produced and draw lessons from operating BETA\nthat will be relevant to the commissioning and operation of the final ASKAP\ntelescope.\n", "  In this paper, we introduce Nicil: Non-Ideal magnetohydrodynamics\nCoefficients and Ionisation Library. Nicil is a stand-alone Fortran90 module\nthat calculates the ionisation values and the coefficients of the non-ideal\nmagnetohydrodynamics terms of Ohmic resistivity, the Hall effect, and ambipolar\ndiffusion. The module is fully parameterised such that the user can decide\nwhich processes to include and decide upon the values of the free parameters,\nmaking this a versatile and customisable code. The module includes both cosmic\nray and thermal ionisation; the former includes two ion species and three\nspecies of dust grains (positively charged, negatively charged and neutral),\nand the latter includes five elements which can be doubly ionised. We\ndemonstrate tests of the module, and then describe how to implement it into an\nexisting numerical code.\n", "  The exponential parameterization of Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata mixing\nmatrix for neutrino is discussed. The exponential form allows easy\nfactorization and separate analysis of the CP-violating and Majorana terms.\nBased upon the recent experimental data on the neutrino mixing, the values for\nthe exponential parameterization matrix for neutrinos are determined. The\nmatrix entries for the pure rotational part in charge of the mixing without\nCP-violation are derived. The complementarity hypothesis for quarks and\nneutrinos is demonstrated. The comparison of the results, based on most recent\nand on old data is held. The CP-violating parameter value is estimated, based\non the so far imprecise experimental indications, regarding CP-violation for\nneutrinos. The unitarity of the exponential parameterisation and the\nCP-violating term transform is confirmed. The transform of the neutrino mass\nstate vector by the exponential matrix with account for CP-violation is shown.\n", "  We present upper limits on the 21 cm power spectrum at $z = 5.9$ calculated\nfrom the model-independent limit on the neutral fraction of the intergalactic\nmedium of $x_{\\rm H{\\small I }} < 0.06 + 0.05\\ (1\\sigma)$ derived from dark\npixel statistics of quasar absorption spectra. Using 21CMMC, a Markov chain\nMonte Carlo Epoch of Reionization analysis code, we explore the probability\ndistribution of 21 cm power spectra consistent with this constraint on the\nneutral fraction. We present 99 per cent confidence upper limits of\n$\\Delta^2(k) < 10$ to $20\\ {\\rm mK}^2$ over a range of $k$ from 0.5 to $2.0\\\nh{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, with the exact limit dependent on the sampled $k$ mode. This\nlimit can be used as a null test for 21 cm experiments: a detection of power at\n$z=5.9$ in excess of this value is highly suggestive of residual foreground\ncontamination or other systematic errors affecting the analysis.\n", "  In the framework of the signal processing approach to single-atom resonance\nfluorescence with spectral resolution, we diagrammatically derive an analytical\nformula for arbitrary-order spectral correlation functions of the scattered\nfields that pass through Fabry-Perot interferometers. Our general expression is\nthen applied to study correlation signals in the limit of well separated\nspectral lines of the resonance fluorescence spectrum. In particular, we study\nthe normalized second-order temporal intensity correlation functions in the\ncase of the interferometers tuned to the components of the spectrum and obtain\ninterferential corrections to the approximate results derived in the secular\nlimit. In addition, we explore purely spectral correlations and show that they\ncan fully be understood in terms of the two-photon cascades down the dressed\nstate ladder.\n", "  We present the results of $Suzaku$ and $XMM-Newton$ X-ray observations of the\ncluster pair 1E2216.0-0401 and 1E2215.7-0404. We discover an X-ray bridge\nbetween the clusters. $Suzaku$ and $XMM-Newton$ observations revealed that each\ncluster hosts gas with moderate temperature of $kT_{1E2216.0-0401}=$4.8$\\pm$0.1\nkeV and $kT_{1E2215.7-0404}=$5.8$\\pm$0.2 keV, respectively. On the other hand,\nthe bridge region shows a remarkably high temperature ({\\it kT}=6.6$\\pm$0.5\nkeV). Furthermore, at the position of the bridge, we detected an enhancement in\nthe wavelet-decomposed soft-band (0.5-4.0 keV) $XMM-Newton$ image at 3 sigma\nsignificance, this is most likely due to a compression of the intracluster\nmedium (ICM) as a consequence of the merging activity. This X-ray intensity and\ntemperature enhancement are not consistent with those expected from a late\nphase, but are in agreement with the predictions by numerical simulations of an\nearly phase merger. From the temperature jump at the location of the bridge,\nthe Mach number is estimated to be ${\\cal M}=1.4\\pm0.1$, which corresponds to a\nshock propagation velocity of about 1570 km/s. From the shock properties, we\nestimate that core-passage will occur in 0.3-0.6 Gyr and that the age of the\nshock structure is 50--100 Myr. Based on the measured properties of the ICM at\nthe bridge and estimation of timescales, we find indications for\nnon-equilibrium ionization. We also discover possible diffuse radio emission\nlocated between the merging clusters. Combining the radio, X-ray, and optical\nimage data, we speculate that the detected radio sources are most likely\nrelated to the merger event. Thus, 1E2216.0-0401 and 1E2215.7-0404 is a new\nexample of an early phase cluster merger with remarkable characteristics.\n", "  The Coronal Multi-channel Polarimeter (CoMP) has previously demonstrated the\npresence of Doppler velocity fluctuations in the solar corona. The observed\nfluctuations are thought to be transverse waves, i.e. highly incompressible\nmotions whose restoring force is dominated by the magnetic tension, some of\nwhich demonstrate clear periodicity. We aim to exploit CoMP's ability to\nprovide high cadence observations of the off-limb corona to investigate the\nproperties of velocity fluctuations in a range of coronal features, providing\ninsight into how(if) the properties of the waves are influenced by the varying\nmagnetic topology in active regions, quiet Sun and open fields regions. An\nanalysis of Doppler velocity time-series of the solar corona from the\n$10,747$~{\\AA} Iron XIII line is performed, determining the velocity power\nspectra and using it as a tool to probe wave behaviour. Further, the average\nphase speed and density for each region are estimated and used to compute the\nspectra for energy density and energy flux. In addition, we assess the noise\nlevels associated with the CoMP data, deriving analytic formulae for the\nuncertainty on Doppler velocity measurements and providing a comparison by\nestimating the noise from the data. It is found that the entire corona is\nreplete with transverse wave behaviour. The corresponding power spectra\nindicates that the observed velocity fluctuations are predominately generated\nby stochastic processes, with the spectral slope of the power varying between\nthe different magnetic regions. Most strikingly, all power spectra reveal the\npresence of enhanced power occurring at $ \\sim3$~mHz, potentially implying that\nthe excitation of coronal transverse waves by $p$-modes is a global phenomenon.\n", "  We present for the first time a ghost-free higher-derivative chiral model\nwith a propagating auxiliary F-term field (highest component of the chiral\nmultiplet). We obtain this model by removing a ghost in a higher derivative\nchiral model, with Higgsing it in terms of an auxiliary vector superfield.\nDepending on the sign of the quadratic derivative term of the chiral\nsuperfield, the model contains two ghost free branches of the parameter\nregions. We find that supersymmetry is spontaneously broken in one branch while\nit is preserved in the other branch. As a consequence of dynamical F-term\nfield, a conserved U(1) charge corresponding to the number density of $F$\nappears, which can be regarded as a generalization of the R-symmetry.\n", "  Magic wavelengthsfor the $7S_{1/2}-7P_{1/2,3/2}$ transitions in Fr were\nreported by Dammalapati \\textit{et al.} in [Phys. Rev. A 93, 043407 (2016)].\nThese $\\lambda_{\\rm{magic}}$ were determined by plotting dynamic\npolarizabilities ($\\alpha$) of the involved states with the above transitions\nagainst a desired range of wavelength. Electric dipole (E1) matrix elements\nlisted in [J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data 36, 497 (2007)], from the measured\nlifetimes of the $7P_{1/2,3/2}$ states and from the calculations considering\ncore-polarization effects in the relativistic Hartree-Fock (HFR) method, were\nused to determine $\\alpha$. However, contributions from core correlation\neffects and from the E1 matrix elements of the $7P-7S$, $7P-8S$ and $7P-6D$\ntransitions to $\\alpha$ of the $7P$ states were ignored. In this work, we\ndemonstrate importance of these contributions and improve accuracies of\n$\\alpha$ further by replacing the E1 matrix elements taken from the HFR method\nby the values obtained employing relativistic coupled-cluster theory. Our\nstatic $\\alpha$ are found to be in excellent agreement with the other available\ntheoretical results; whereas substituting the E1 matrix elements used by\nDammalapati \\textit{et al.} give very small $\\alpha$ values for the $7P$\nstates. Owing to this, we find disagreement in $\\lambda_{\\rm{magic}}$ reported\nby Dammalapati \\textit{et al.} for linearly polarized light; especially at\nwavelengths close to the D-lines and in the infrared region. As a consequence,\na $\\lambda_{\\rm{magic}}$ reported at 797.75 nm which was seen supporting a blue\ndetuned trap in their work is now estimated at 771.03 nm and is supporting a\nred detuned trap. Also, none of our results match with the earlier results for\ncircularly polarized light. Moreover, our static values of $\\alpha$ will be\nvery useful for guiding experiments to carry out their measurements.\n", "  The fission fragment mass distributions have been measured in the reactions\n16O + 184W and 19F+ 181Ta populating the same compound nucleus 200Pb? at\nsimilar excitation energies. It is found that the widths of the mass\ndistribution increases monotonically with excitation energy, indicating the\nabsence of quasi-fission for both reactions. This is contrary to two recent\nclaims of the presence of quasi-fission in the above mentioned reactions.\n", "  We have detected in ALMA observations CO J = 6 - 5 emission from the nucleus\nof the Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068. The low-velocity (up to +/- 70 km/s relative to\nsystemic) CO emission resolves into a 12x7 pc structure, roughly aligned with\nthe nuclear radio source. Higher-velocity emission (up to +/- 400 km/s) is\nconsistent with a bipolar outflow in a direction nearly perpendicular (roughly\n80 degrees) to the nuclear disk. The position-velocity diagram shows that in\naddition to the outflow, the velocity field may also contain rotation about the\ndisk axis. These observations provide compelling evidence in support of the\ndisk-wind scenario for the AGN obscuring torus.\n", "  Disordered hyperuniform many-body systems are distinguishable states of\nmatter that lie between a crystal and liquid: they are like perfect crystals in\nthe way they suppress large-scale density fluctuations and yet are like liquids\nor glasses in that they are statistically isotropic with no Bragg peaks. These\nsystems play a vital role in a number of fundamental and applied problems:\nglass formation, jamming, rigidity, photonic and electronic band structure,\nlocalization of waves and excitations, self-organization, fluid dynamics,\nquantum systems, and pure mathematics. systems. Here, we derive new rigorous\ncriteria that disordered hyperuniform two-phase heterogeneous materials must\nobey and explore their consequences. Two-phase heterogeneous media are\nubiquitous, examples include composites and porous media, biological media,\nfoams, polymer blends, granular media, cellular solids, and colloids. We\nrigorously establish the requirements for sphere packings to be\n\"multihyperuniform.\" We apply realizability conditions for an autocovariance\nfunction and its associated spectral density of a two-phase medium, and then\nincorporate hyperuniformity as a constraint in order to derive new conditions.\nWe show that some functional forms can immediately be eliminated from\nconsideration and identify other forms that are allowable. Specific examples\nand counterexamples are described. Contact is made with well-known\nmicrostructural models as well as irregular phase-separation and Turing-type\npatterns. We also ascertain a family of spectral densities that are realizable\nby disordered hyperuniform two-phase media in any space dimension, and present\nexplicit constructions. These studies provide insight into the nature of\ndisordered hyperuniformity in the context of heterogeneous materials and have\nimplications for the design of such novel amorphous materials.\n", "  We review recent progress on the calculations on the inclusive forward hadron\nproduction within the saturation formalism. After introducing the concept of\nperturbative parton saturation and nonlinear evolution we discuss the formalism\nfor the forward hadron production at high energy in the leading and\nnext-to-leading order. Numerical results are presented and compared with the\nexperimental data on forward hadron production in $dA$ and $pA$. We discuss the\nproblem of the negativity of the NLO cross section at high transverse momenta,\nstudy its origin in detail and present possible improvements which include the\ncorrected kinematics and the suitable choice of the rapidity cutoff.\n", "  The results of dc and ac magnetization, heat-capacity, 57Fe Moessbauer\nspectroscopy, dielectric, pyroelectric current and isothermal\nmagneto-capacitance measurements on a recently reported lithium-based oxide,\nLi3FeRuO6, related to LiCoO2-type rhombohedral structure (space group, R-3m)\nare presented. The results reveal that the compound undergoes spin-glass\nfreezing below 15 K. There is a peak around 34 K in pyroelectric data, which\ncan not be attributed to ferroelectricity, but to the phenomenon of thermally\nstimulated depolarization current. As revealed by magnetocapacitance data above\nand below magnetic ordering temperature, magnetic and electric dipoles appear\nto be coupled, thereby offering evidence for magnetodielectric coupling.\n", "  Numerical simulations of 3D, rapidly rotating Rayleigh-Benard convection are\nperformed using an asymptotic quasi-geostrophic model that incorporates the\neffects of no-slip boundaries through (i) parameterized Ekman pumping boundary\nconditions, and (ii) a thermal wind boundary layer that regularizes the\nenhanced thermal fluctuations induced by pumping. The fidelity of the model,\nobtained by an asymptotic reduction of the Navier-Stokes equations that\nimplicitly enforces a pointwise geostrophic balance, is explored for the first\ntime by comparisons of simulations against the findings of direct numerical\nsimulations and laboratory experiments. Results from these methods have\nestablished Ekman pumping as the mechanism responsible for significantly\nenhancing the vertical heat transport. This asymptotic model demonstrates\nexcellent agreement over a range of thermal forcing for Pr ~1 when compared\nwith results from experiments and DNS at maximal values of their attainable\nrotation rates, as measured by the Ekman number (E ~ 10^{-7}); good qualitative\nagreement is achieved for Pr > 1. Similar to studies with stress-free\nboundaries, four spatially distinct flow morphologies exists. Despite the\npresence of frictional drag at the upper and/or lower boundaries, a strong\nnon-local inverse cascade of barotropic (i.e., depth-independent) kinetic\nenergy persists in the final regime of geostrophic turbulence and is dominant\nat large scales. For mixed no-slip/stress-free and no-slip/no-slip boundaries,\nEkman friction is found to attenuate the efficiency of the upscale energy\ntransport and, unlike the case of stress-free boundaries, rapidly saturates the\nbarotropic kinetic energy. For no-slip/no-slip boundaries, Ekman friction is\nstrong enough to prevent the development of a coherent dipole vortex\ncondensate. Instead vortex pairs are found to be intermittent, varying in both\ntime and strength.\n", "  Transient diode laser absorption spectroscopy has been used to measure three\nstrong vibronic bands in the near infrared spectrum of the C$_2$H, ethynyl,\nradical not previously observed in the gas phase. The radical was produced by\nultraviolet excimer laser photolysis of either acetylene or\n(1,1,1)-trifluoropropyne in a slowly flowing sample of the precursor diluted in\ninert gas, and the spectral resolution was Doppler-limited. The character of\nthe upper states was determined from the rotational and fine structure in the\nobserved spectra and assigned by measurement of ground state rotational\ncombination differences. The upper states include a $^2\\Sigma ^+$ state at 6696\ncm$^{-1}$, a second $^2\\Sigma ^+$ state at 7088 cm$^{-1}$, and a $^2\\Pi$ state\nat 7110 cm$^{-1}$. By comparison with published calculations (R. Tarroni and S.\nCarter, \\textit{J. Chem. Phys} \\textbf{119}, 12878 (2003) and \\textit{Mol.\nPhys}. \\textbf{102}, 2167 (2004)), the vibronic character of these levels was\nalso assigned. The observed states contain both $X^2\\Sigma^+$ and $A^2\\Pi$\nelectronic character. Several local rotational level perturbations were\nobserved in the excited states. Kinetic measurements of the time-evolution of\nthe ground state populations following collisional relaxation and reactive loss\nof the radicals formed in a hot, non-thermal, population distribution were made\nusing some of the strong rotational lines observed. The case of C$ _{2} $H may\nbe a good place to investigate the behavior at intermediate pressures of inert\ncolliders, where the competition between relaxation and reaction can be tuned\nand observed to compare with master equation models, rather than deliberately\nsuppressed to measure thermal rate constants.\n", "  We present the 2-degree Field Lensing Survey (2dFLenS), a new galaxy redshift\nsurvey performed at the Anglo-Australian Telescope. 2dFLenS is the first\nwide-area spectroscopic survey specifically targeting the area mapped by\ndeep-imaging gravitational lensing fields, in this case the Kilo-Degree Survey.\n2dFLenS obtained 70,079 redshifts in the range z < 0.9 over an area of 731 sq\ndeg, and is designed to extend the datasets available for testing gravitational\nphysics and promote the development of relevant algorithms for joint imaging\nand spectroscopic analysis. The redshift sample consists first of 40,531\nLuminous Red Galaxies (LRGs), which enable analyses of galaxy-galaxy lensing,\nredshift-space distortion, and the overlapping source redshift distribution by\ncross-correlation. An additional 28,269 redshifts form a magnitude-limited (r <\n19.5) nearly-complete sub-sample, allowing direct source classification and\nphotometric-redshift calibration. In this paper, we describe the motivation,\ntarget selection, spectroscopic observations, and clustering analysis of\n2dFLenS. We use power spectrum multipole measurements to fit the redshift-space\ndistortion parameter of the LRG sample in two redshift ranges 0.15 < z < 0.43\nand 0.43 < z < 0.7 as beta = 0.49 +/- 0.15 and beta = 0.26 +/- 0.09,\nrespectively. These values are consistent with those obtained from LRGs in the\nBaryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey. 2dFLenS data products will be released\nvia our website http://2dflens.swin.edu.au.\n", "  The antihydrogen formation by charge exchange between cold antiprotons and\nRydberg positronium Ps is studied by using the Classical Trajectory Monte Carlo\n(CTMC) method.\n", "  Light cluster production at the NICA accelerator complex offers unique\npossibilities to use these states as \"rare probes\" of in-medium characteristics\nsuch as phase space occupation and early flow. In order to explain this\nstatement, in this contribution theoretical considerations from the nuclear\nstatistical equilibrium model and from a quantum statistical model of cluster\nproduction are supplemented with a discussion of a transport model for light\ncluster formation and with results from hydrodynamic simulations combined with\nthe coalescence model.\n", "  The aim of this article is to study how the differential rotation of\nsolar-like stars is influenced by rotation rate and mass in presence of\nmagnetic fields generated by a convective dynamo. We use the ASH code to model\nthe convective dynamo of solar-like stars at various rotation rates and masses,\nhence different effective Rossby numbers. We obtained models with either\nprograde (solar-like) or retrograde (anti-solar-like) differential rotation.\nThe trends of differential rotation versus stellar rotation rate obtained for\nsimulations including the effect of the magnetic field are weaker compared with\nhydro simulations ($\\Delta \\Omega \\propto (\\Omega/\\Omega_{\\odot})^{0.44}$ in\nthe MHD case and $\\Delta \\Omega \\propto (\\Omega/\\Omega_{\\odot})^{0.89}$ in the\nhydro case), hence showing a better agreement with the observations. Analysis\nof angular momentum transport revealed that the simulations with retrograde and\nprograde differential rotation have opposite distribution of the viscous,\nturbulent Reynolds stresses and meridional circulation contributions. The\nthermal wind balance is achieved in the prograde cases. However, in retrograde\ncases Reynolds stresses are dominant for high latitudes and near the top of the\nconvective layer. Baroclinic effects are stronger for faster rotating models.\n", "  The Anderson impurity model is studied by means of the self-consistent\nhybridization expansions in its non-crossing (NCA) and one-crossing (OCA)\napproximations. We have found that for the one-channel spin-$1/2$ particle-hole\nsymmetric Anderson model, the NCA results are qualitatively wrong for any\ntemperature, even when the approximation gives the exact threshold exponents of\nthe ionic states. Actually, the NCA solution describes an overscreened Kondo\neffect, because it is the same as for the two-channel infinite-$U$ single level\nAnderson model. We explicitly show that the NCA is unable to distinguish\nbetween these two very different physical systems, independently of\ntemperature. Using the impurity entropy as an example, we show that the low\ntemperature values of the NCA entropy for the symmetric case yield the limit\n$S_{imp}(T=0)\\rightarrow \\ln\\sqrt{2},$ which corresponds to the zero\ntemperature entropy of the overscreened Kondo model. Similar pathologies are\npredicted for any other thermodynamic property. On the other hand, we have\nfound that the OCA approach lifts the artificial mapping between the models and\nrestores correct properties of the ground-state, for instance, a vanishing\nentropy at low enough temperatures $S_{imp}(T=0)\\rightarrow0$. Our results\nindicate that the very well known NCA should be used with caution close to the\nsymmetric point of the Anderson model.\n", "  The Ernst formulation of the Einstein equations is generalised to accommodate\n$f(R)$ theories of gravity. It is shown that, as in general relativity, the\naxisymmetric $f(R)$ field equations for a vacuum spacetime that is either\nstationary or cylindrically symmetric reduce to a single, non-linear\ndifferential equation for a complex-valued scalar function. As a worked\nexample, we apply the generalised Ernst equations to derive a $f(R)$\ngeneralisation of the Zipoy-Voorhees metric, which may be used to describe the\ngravitational field outside of an ellipsoidal neutron star. We also apply the\ntheory to investigate the phase speed of large-amplitude gravitational waves in\n$f(R)$ gravity in the context of soliton-like solutions that display shock-wave\nbehaviour across the causal boundary.\n", "  The mass of prestellar cores is an essential ingredient to understand the\nonset of star formation in the core. The low level of emission from cold dust\nmay keep parts of it hidden from observation. We aim to determine the fraction\nof core mass in the temperature range < 8 K that can be expected for typical\nlow- and high-mass star formation regions. We calculate the dust temperature\nwithin standard spherically symmetric prestellar cores for a grid of density\npowerlaws in the outer core regions, core masses, and variation in the external\nmulti-component radiation field. The dust is assumed to be composed of\namorphous silicate and carbon, and variations of its optical properties are\ndiscussed. As measure for the distribution of cores and clumps, we use core\nmass functions derived for various environments. In view of the high densities\nin very cold central regions, dust and gas temperatures are assumed to be\nequal. We find that the fraction of mass with temperatures < 8 K in typical\nlow- and high-mass cores is < 20\\%. It is possible to obtain higher fractions\nof very cold gas by placing intermediate- or high-mass cores in a typical\nlow-mass star formation environment. We show that the mass uncertainty arising\nfrom FIR to mm modeling of very cold dust emission is smaller than the mass\nuncertainty due to the unknown dust opacities.\n", "  We use Wang-Landau and replica exchange techniques to study the effect of an\nincreasing stiffness on the formation of secondary structures in protein-like\nsystems. Two possible models are considered. In both models, a polymer chain is\nformed by tethered beads where non-consecutive backbone beads attract each\nother via a square-well potential representing the tendency of the chain to\nfold. In addition, smaller hard spheres are attached to each non-terminal\nbackbone bead along the direction normal to the chain to mimic the steric\nhindrance of side chains in real proteins. The two models, however, differ in\nthe way bending rigidity is enforced. In the first model, partial overlap\nbetween consecutive beads is allowed. This reduces the possible bending angle\nbetween consecutive bonds thus producing an effective entropic stiffness that\ncompetes with a short-range attraction, and leads to a formation of secondary\nstructures characteristic of proteins. We discuss the low-temperature phase\ndiagram as a function of increasing interpenetration, and find a transition\nfrom a planar, beta-like structure, to helical shape. In the second model, an\nenergetic stiffness is explicitly introduced by imposing an infinitely large\nenergy penalty for bending above a critical angle between consecutive bonds,\nand no penalty below it. The low-temperature phase of this model does not show\nany sign of protein-like secondary structures. At intermediate temperatures,\nhowever, where the chain is still in the coil conformation but stiffness is\nsignificant, we find the two models to predict a quite similar dependence of\nthe persistence length as a function of the stiffness. This behaviour is\nrationalized in terms of a simple geometrical mapping between the two models.\nFinally, we discuss the effect of shrinking side chains to zero, and find the\nabove mapping to still hold true.\n", "  Coalescence of voids by internal necking is in most cases the last\nmicroscopic event related to ductile fracture and corresponds to a localized\nplastic flow between adjacent voids. Macroscopic load associated to the onset\nof coalescence is classically estimated based on limit analysis. However, a\nrigorous upper-bound mathematical expression for the limitload required for\nflat voids coalescence that remains finite for penny-shaped voids/cracks is\nstill unavailable. Therefore, based on limit analysis, theoretical upper-bound\nestimates - both integral expression and closed-form formula - are obtained for\nthe limit-load of cylindrical flat voids in cylindrical unit-cell subjected to\nboundary conditions allowing the assessment of coalescence, for axisymmetric\nstress state. These estimates, leading to finite limit-loads for pennyshaped\ncracks, are shown to be in very good agreement with numerical limit analysis,\nfor both cylindrical and spheroidal voids. Approximate formula is also given\nfor coalescence under combined tension and shear loading. These coalescence\ncriteria can thus be used to predict onset of coalescence of voids by internal\nnecking in ductile fracture modelling.\n", "  We report the results of our investigations on the influence of partial\nsubstitution of Er and Gd for Dy on the magnetic and magnetoelectric properties\nof DyFe0.5Cr0.5O3, which is known to be a multiferroic system. Magnetic\nsusceptibility and heat capacity data, apart from confirming the occurrence of\nmagnetic transitions at ~ 121 and 13 K in DyFe0.5Cr0.5O3, bring out that the\nlower transition temperature only is suppressed by rare-earth substitution.\nMultiferroic behavior is found to persist in Dy0.4Ln0.6Fe0.5Cr0.5O3 (Ln= Er and\nGd). There is an evidence for magnetoelectric coupling in all these materials\nwith qualitative differences in its behavior as the temperature is changed\nacross these two transitions. Remnant electric polarization is observed for all\nthe compounds. The most notable observation is that electric polarization is\nseen to get enhanced as a result of rare-earth substitution with respect to\nthat in DyFe0.5Cr0.5O3. Interestingly, similar trend is seen in magnetocaloric\neffect, consistent with the existence of magnetoelectric coupling. The results\nthus provide evidence for the tuning of magnetoelectric coupling by rare-earth\nsubstitution in this family of oxides.\n", "  We report the serendipitous detection with ALMA of the vibrationally-excited\npure-rotational CO transition $v=1, J=3-2$ towards five asymptotic giant branch\n(AGB) stars, $o$ Cet, R Aqr, R Scl, W Aql, and $\\pi^1$ Gru. The observed lines\nare formed in the poorly-understood region located between the stellar surface\nand the region where the wind starts, the so-called warm molecular layer. We\nsuccessfully reproduce the observed lines profiles using a simple model. We\nconstrain the extents, densities, and kinematics of the region where the lines\nare produced. R Aqr and R Scl show inverse P-Cygni line profiles which indicate\ninfall of material onto the stars. The line profiles of $o$ Cet and R Scl show\nvariability. The serendipitous detection towards these five sources shows that\nvibrationally-excited rotational lines can be observed towards a large number\nof nearby AGB stars using ALMA. This opens a new possibility for the study of\nthe innermost regions of AGB circumstellar envelopes.\n", "  A new cumulant-based $GW$ approximation for the retarded one-particle Green's\nfunction is proposed, motivated by an exact relation between the improper Dyson\nself-energy and the cumulant generating function. Qualitative aspects of this\nmethod are explored within a simple one-electron independent phonon model,\nwhere it is seen that the method preserves the energy moment of the spectral\nweight while also reproducing the exact Green's function in the weak coupling\nlimit. For the three-dimensional electron gas, this method predicts multiple\nsatellites at the bottom of the band, albeit with inaccurate peak spacing.\nHowever, its quasiparticle properties and correlation energies are more\naccurate than both previous cumulant methods and standard $G_0W_0$. Our results\npoint to new features that may be exploited within the framework of\ncumulant-based methods and suggest promising directions for future exploration\nand improvement of cumulant-based $GW$ approaches.\n", "  Dynamical signatures are known to precede jamming in hard-particle systems,\nbut static structural signatures have proven more elusive. The observation that\ncompressing hard-particle packings towards jamming causes growing\nhyperuniformity has paved the way for the analysis of jamming as an \"inverted\ncritical point\" in which the direct correlation function $c(r)$ diverges. We\nestablish quantitative relationships between various singularities in $c(r)$\nand the total correlation function $h(r)$ that provide a concrete means of\nidentifying features that must be expressed in $c(r)$ if one hopes to reproduce\ndetails in the pair correlation function accurately. We also analyze systems of\nthree-dimensional monodisperse hard-spheres of diameter $D$ as they approach\nordered and disordered jammed configurations. For the latter, we use the\nLubachevsky-Stillinger (LS) and Torquato-Jiao (TJ) packing algorithms, which\nboth generate disordered packings, but can show perceptible structural\ndifferences. We identify a short-ranged scaling $c(r) \\propto -1/r$ as $r\n\\rightarrow 0$ and show that this, along with the developing delta function at\n$c(D)$, is a consequence of the growing long-rangedness in $c(r)$. Near the\nfreezing density, we identify qualitative differences in the structure factor\n$S(k)$ as well as $c(r)$ between TJ- and LS-generated configurations and link\nthem to differences in the protocols' packing dynamics. Configurations from\nboth algorithms have structure factors that approach zero in the low-wavenumber\nlimit as jamming is approached and are shown to exhibit a corresponding\npower-law decay in $c(r)$ for large $r$ as a consequence. Our work advances the\nnotion that static signatures are exhibited by hard-particle packings as they\napproach jamming and underscores the utility of the direct correlation function\nas a means of monitoring for an incipient rigid network.\n", "  Hysteresis phenomena and multistability play crucial roles in the dynamics of\ncoupled oscillators, which are now interpreted from the point of view of\ncodimension-two bifurcations. On the Ott-Antonsen's manifold, complete\nbifurcation sets of delay-coupled Kuramoto model are derived regarding coupling\nstrength and delay as bifurcation parameters. It is rigorously proved that the\nsystem must undergo Bautin bifurcations for some critical values, thus there\nalways exists saddle-node bifurcation of periodic solutions inducing hysteresis\nloop. With the aid of center manifold reduction method and the Matlab Package\nDDE-Biftool, the location of Bautin and double Hopf points and detailed\ndynamics are theoretically determined. We find that, near these critical\npoints, at most four coherent states (two of which are stable) and a stable\nincoherent state may coexist, and that the system undergoes Neimark-Sacker\nbifurcation of periodic solutions. Finally, the clear scenarios about the\nsynchronous transition in delayed Kuramoto model are depicted.\n", "  Sympathetic cooling of trapped ions through collisions with neutral buffer\ngases is critical to a variety of modern scientific fields, including\nfundamental chemistry, mass spectrometry, nuclear and particle physics, and\natomic and molecular physics. Despite its widespread use over four decades,\nthere remain open questions regarding its fundamental limitations. To probe\nthese limits, here we examine the steady-state evolution of up to ten barium\nions immersed in a gas of three-million laser-cooled calcium atoms. We observe\nand explain the emergence of nonequilibrium behavior as evidenced by\nbifurcations in the ion steady-state temperature, parameterized by ion number.\nWe show that this behavior leads to limitations in creating and maintaining\ntranslationally cold samples of trapped ions using neutral-gas sympathetic\ncooling. These results may provide a route to studying nonequilibrium\nthermodynamics.\n", "  Dynamic cooperativity in monomeric enzymes is characterized in terms of a\nnon-Michaelis-Menten kinetic behaviour. The latter is believed to be associated\nwith mechanisms that include multiple reaction pathways due to enzymatic\nconformational fluctuations. Recent advances in single-molecule fluorescence\nspectroscopy have provided new fundamental insights on the possible mechanisms\nunderlying reactions catalyzed by fluctuating enzymes. Here, we present a\nbottom-up approach to understand enzyme turnover kinetics at physiologically\nrelevant mesoscopic concentrations informed by mechanisms extracted from\nsingle-molecule stochastic trajectories. The stochastic approach, presented\nhere, shows the emergence of dynamic cooperativity in terms of a slowing down\nof the Michaelis-Menten (MM) kinetics resulting in negative cooperativity. For\nfewer enzymes, dynamic cooperativity emerges due to the combined effects of\nenzymatic conformational fluctuations and molecular discreteness. The increase\nin the number of enzymes, however, suppresses the effect of enzymatic\nconformational fluctuations such that dynamic cooperativity emerges solely due\nto the discrete changes in the number of reacting species. These results\nconfirm that the turnover kinetics of fluctuating enzyme based on the\nparallel-pathway MM mechanism switches over to the single-pathway MM mechanism\nwith the increase in the number of enzymes. For large enzyme numbers,\nconvergence to the exact MM equation occurs in the limit of very high substrate\nconcentration as the stochastic kinetics approaches the deterministic\nbehaviour.\n", "  Coherent spaces spanned by a finite number of coherent states, are\nintroduced. Their coherence properties are studied, using the Dirac contour\nrepresentation. It is shown that the corresponding projectors resolve the\nidentity, and that they transform into projectors of the same type, under\ndisplacement transformations, and also under time evolution. The set of these\nspaces, with the logical OR and AND operations is a distributive lattice, and\nwith the logical XOR and AND operations is a Boolean ring (Stone\\rq{}s\nformalism). Applications of this Boolean ring into classical CNOT gates with\n$n$-ary variables, and also quantum CNOT gates with coherent states, are\ndiscussed.\n", "  Buckling is one of the most common phenomena in atomic-thick layered\nstructures like graphene. While the buckling phenomenon usually causes disaster\nfor most nano-devices, we illustrate one positive application of the buckled\ngraphene for energy harvest, storage, and conversion. More specifically, we\nperform molecular dynamical simulations to show that the buckled graphene can\nbe used to collect the wasted mechanical energy and store the energy in the\nform of internal knotting potential. Through strain engineering, the knotting\npotential can be converted into useful kinetic (thermal) energy that is highly\nconcentrated at the free edges of the buckled graphene. The present study\ndemonstrates potential applications of the buckled graphene for converting the\ndispersed wasted mechanical energy into the concentrated useful kinetic\n(thermal) energy.\n", "  We report the Chandra/HRC-S and Swift/XRT observations for the 2015 outburst\nof the high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) pulsar in the Small Magellanic Cloud, SMC\nX-2. While previous studies suggested that either an O star or a Be star in the\nfield is the high-mass companion of SMC X-2, our Chandra/HRC-S image\nunambiguously confirms the O-type star as the true optical counterpart. Using\nthe Swift/XRT observations, we extracted accurate orbital parameters of the\npulsar binary through a time of arrivals (TOAs) analysis. In addition, there\nwere two X-ray dips near the inferior conjunction, which are possibly caused by\neclipses or an ionized high-density shadow wind near the companion's surface.\nFinally, we propose that an outflow driven by the radiation pressure from day\n~10 played an important role in the X-ray/optical evolution of the outburst.\n", "  The dynamical evolution of dislocations in plastically deformed metals is\ncontrolled by both deterministic factors arising out of applied loads and\nstochastic effects appearing due to fluctuations of internal stress. Such type\nof stochastic dislocation processes and the associated spatially inhomogeneous\nmodes lead to randomness in the observed deformation structure. Previous\nstudies have analyzed the role of randomness in such textural evolution but\nnone of these models have considered the impact of a finite decay time (all\nprevious models assumed instantaneous relaxation which is \"unphysical\") of the\nstochastic perturbations in the overall dynamics of the system. The present\narticle bridges this knowledge gap by introducing a colored noise in the form\nof an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise in the analysis of a class of linear and\nnonlinear Wiener and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes that these structural\ndislocation dynamics could be mapped on to. Based on an analysis of the\nrelevant Fokker-Planck model, our results show that linear Wiener processes\nremain unaffected by the second time scale in the problem but all nonlinear\nprocesses, both Wiener type and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type, scale as a function of\nthe noise decay time $\\tau$. The results are expected to ramify existing\nexperimental observations and inspire new numerical and laboratory tests to\ngain further insight into the competition between deterministic and random\neffects in modeling plastically deformed samples.\n", "  Recently Liang et al. found a tentative line signal at about 43 GeV in the\ndirections of sixteen nearby Galaxy Clusters. If arising from dark matter\nannihilation, the mass of the dark matter particles should be $m_{\\chi}\\sim 43$\nGeV and the annihilation cross section $\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle \\sim\n5\\times10^{-28}(\\overline{\\rm BF}/10^{3})^{-1}~{\\rm cm^3~s^{-1}}$ is needed,\nwhere $\\overline{\\rm BF}$ is the averaged boost factor of the annihilation\nsignal of these Galaxy Clusters. In this work we discuss several models which\ncould interpret these features and estimate the model parameters. Usually\nsizeable coupling parameter is needed. The $2\\sigma$ upper limits on the cross\nsection of the dark matter annihilation into various final states such as\n$b\\bar{b}$, $\\mu^+\\mu^-$ and so on are also presented.\n", "  The India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO) collaboration has chosen glass\nResistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) as the active detector elements for the Iron\nCalorimeter (ICAL) experiment. In the present work, we study the electrical\nproperties such as bulk resistivity and relative permittivity of the glasses\nfrom two different manufacturers and compared the performances of RPCs built\nusing these glasses. We conclude that the glass electrodes with larger bulk\nresistivy and permittivity are better suited for manufacturing RPCs for the\nICAL experiment, as these detectors could be operated at lower bias currents\nand voltages, and produce better time resolutions compared to those built with\nglass electrodes of smaller bulk resistivity and permittivity.\n", "  We address the origin of the magnetic-field independent -|A| T^{1/2} term\nobserved in the low-temperature resistivity of several As-based metallic\nsystems of the PbFCl structure type. For the layered compound\nZrAs_{1.58}Se_{0.39}, we show that vacancies in the square nets of As give rise\nto the low-temperature transport anomaly over a wide temperature regime of\nalmost two decades in temperature. This low-temperature behavior is in line\nwith the non-magnetic version of the two-channel Kondo effect, whose origin we\nascribe to a dynamic Jahn-Teller effect operating at the vacancy-carrying As\nlayer with a C_4 symmetry. The pair-breaking nature of the dynamical defects in\nthe square nets of As explains the low superconducting transition temperature\nT_{\\rm{c}}\\approx 0.14 K of ZrAs_{1.58}Se_{0.39}, as compared to the\nfree-of-vacancies homologue ZrP_{1.54}S_{0.46} (T_{\\rm{c}}\\approx 3.7 K). Our\nfindings should be relevant to a wide class of metals with disordered pnictogen\nlayers.\n", "  Background: The astrophysical $r$-process occurs in an explosive\nastrophysical event under extremely neutron-rich conditions, leading to\n(n,$\\gamma$)-($\\gamma$,n) equilibrium along isotopic chains which peaks around\nneutron separation energies of a few MeV. Nuclei with larger $Z$ are usually\nproduced by $\\beta^-$-decay, but under certain conditions also $\\alpha$-induced\nreactions may become relevant for the production of nuclei with $Z+2$.\n  Purpose: The uncertainties of the reaction rates of these $\\alpha$-induced\nreactions are discussed within the statistical model. As an example,\n$\\alpha$-induced ($\\alpha$,n) and $(\\alpha$,$x$n) reaction cross sections for\nthe neutron-rich $^{86}$Se nucleus are studied in detail.\n  Method: In a first step, the relevance of ($\\alpha$,n) and $(\\alpha$,$x$n)\nreactions is analyzed. Next the uncertainties are determined from a variation\nof the $\\alpha$-nucleus potential which is the all-dominant parameter for the\nastrophysical $Z \\rightarrow Z+2$ reaction rate.\n  Results: It is found that the $r$-process flow towards nuclei with larger $Z$\nis essentially influenced only by the $\\alpha$-nucleus potential whereas the\nother ingredients of the statistical model play a very minor role. This finding\nis based on the fact that the flow towards larger $Z$ depends on the sum over\nall ($\\alpha$,$x$n) cross sections which is practically identical to the total\n$\\alpha$-induced reaction cross section.\n  Conclusions: $\\alpha$-nucleus potentials play an important role under certain\n$r$-process conditions because the flow towards larger $Z$ depends sensitively\non the total $\\alpha$-induced reaction cross section. The uncertainty of the\nreaction rate is about a factor of two to three at higher temperatures and\nexceeds one order of magnitude at very low temperatures.\n", "  We demonstrate that Mn-doping in the layered sulfides Bi_4O_4S_3 leads to\nstable Bi_4-x Mn_x O_4 S_3 compounds that exhibit both long-range\nferromagnetism and enhanced superconductivity for 0.075 < = x < = 0.15, with a\npossible record superconducting transition temperature (T_c) = 15 K among all\nBiS_2-based superconductors. We conjecture that the coexistence of\nsuperconductivity and ferromagnetism may be attributed to Mn-doping in the\nspacer Bi2O2 layers away from the superconducting BiS_2 layers, whereas the\nenhancement of T_c may be due to excess electron transfer to BiS_2 from the\nMn4+/Mn3+-substitutions in Bi_2O_2. This notion is empirically corroborated by\nthe increased electron-carrier densities upon Mn doping, and by further studies\nof the Bi_4-x A_x O_4 S_3 compounds (A = Co, Ni; x = 0.1, 0.125), where the T_c\nvalues remain comparable to that of the undoped Bi_4O_4S_3 system (= 4.5 K) due\nto lack of 4+ valences in either Co or Ni ions for excess electron transfer to\nthe BiS_2 layers. These findings therefore shed new light on feasible pathways\nto enhance the T_c values of BiS_2-based superconductors.\n", "  We consider the phase diagram of a ferromagnetic system driven to a quantum\nphase transition with a tuning parameter $p$. Before being suppressed, the\ntransition becomes of the first order at a tricritical point, from which wings\nemerge under application of the magnetic field $H$ in the $T$-$p$-$H$ phase\ndiagram. We show that the edge of the wings merge with tangent slopes at the\ntricritical point.\n", "  A survey of the available single-proton data in $A\\leq17$ nuclei, along with\ncalculations using a Woods-Saxon potential, show that the ordering of the\n$0d_{5/2}$ and $1s_{1/2}$ proton orbitals are determined primarily by the\nproximity of the $s$-state proton energy to the Coulomb barrier. This is\nanalogous to the dependence of the corresponding neutron orbitals in proximity\nto the neutron threshold, that was previously discussed.\n", "  Calculations of the static electric-dipole scalar and tensor polarizabilities\nare presented for two alkali atoms, Rb and Cs, for the $nS$, $nP_{1/2, 3/2}$,\nand $nD_{3/2, 5/2}$ states with large principal quantum numbers up to $n = 50$.\nThe calculations are performed within an effective one-electron approximation,\nbased on the Dirac-Fock Hamiltonian with a semi-empirical core-polarization\npotential. The obtained results are compared with those from a simpler\nsemi-empirical approach and with available experimental data.\n", "  The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) aims to spatially resolve the silhouette\n(or shadow) of the supermassive black holes in the Galactic Centre (Sgr\nA$^\\star$) and M87. The primary scientific objectives are to test general\nrelativity in the strong-field regime and to probe accretion and jet-launch\nphysics at event-horizon scales. This is made possible by the technique of Very\nLong Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) at (sub)millimetre wavelengths, which can\nachieve angular resolutions of order $\\sim10~\\mu$-arcsec. However, this\napproach suffers from unique observational challenges, including scattering in\nthe troposphere and interstellar medium; rapidly time-variable source structure\nin both polarized and total intensity; as well as non-negligible antenna\npointing errors. In this, the first paper in a series, we present the\nMeqSilhouette software package which is specifically designed to accurately\nsimulate EHT observations. It includes realistic descriptions of a number of\nsignal corruptions that can limit the ability to measure the key science\nparameters. This can be used to quantify calibration requirements, test\nparameter estimation and imaging strategies, and investigate systematic\nuncertainties that may be present. In doing so, a stronger link can be made\nbetween observational capabilities and theoretical predictions, with the goal\nof maximising scientific output from the upcoming order of magnitude increase\nin EHT sensitivity.\n", "  We show that mixing transformations for Dirac fields arise as a consequence\nof the non-trivial interplay between rotations and Bogoliubov transformations\nat level of ladder operators. Indeed the non-commutativity between the\nalgebraic generators of such transformations turns out to be responsible of the\nunitary inequivalence of the flavor and mass representations and of the\nassociated vacuum structure. A possible thermodynamic interpretation is also\ninvestigated.\n", "  A simulated annealing (SA) approach is employed in the determination of\ndifferent tight binding (TB) sets of parameters for the nitride semiconductors\nAlN, GaN and InN, as well their limitations and potentialities are also\ndiscussed. Two kinds of atomic basis set are considered: (\\textit{i}) the\northogonal $sp^3s*$ with interaction up to second neighbors and (\\textit{ii}) a\n$spd$ non-orthogonal set, with the Hamiltonian matrix elements calculated\nwithin the Extended H\\\"uckel Theory (EHT) prescriptions. For the non-orthogonal\nmethod, TB parameters are given for both zincblend and wurtzite crystalline\nstructures.\n", "  The electrical conductivity of a CdS thin film, controlled by grain\nstructures is essential to enhance its photoconductivity to be able to be fit\nas a window material in CdS/CdTe heterojunction solar cell. In order to\ncharacterize a thin film, electromagnetically, we employed an open cavity\nresonator with a sub-millimeter VNA (Vector Network Analyzer). Our technique is\ncapable of measuring complex dielectric permittivity, $\\tilde{\\epsilon}$, of a\nphotovoltaic film as thin as 0.1 $\\mu$m. We measured the real part of the\ncomplex dielectric permittivity, $\\epsilon_{re}$, and electrical conductivity,\n$\\sigma_{re}$ (derived from the imaginary part, $\\epsilon_{im}$), of unannealed\nand annealed CdS films with thicknesses $\\sim$ 0.15 $\\mu$m on $\\sim$ 3 mm\nthick-borosillicate glass substrates, at room temperature. We obtain the\n(thermally activated) electrical conductivity between 100 and 312 GHz, which is\nless in annealed samples than in unannealed one by $\\sim$ 2 orders of\nmagnitude. Contrary to our expectations, the carrier concentrations extracted\nfrom these data by fitting a Drude model, are $\\sim$ 10$^{16}$ cm$^{-3}$\n(unannealed) and $\\sim$ 10$^{14}$ cm$^{-3}$ (annealed). We investigate the\nconnection between grain size and carrier concentration.\n", "  We show that truncated rotating square waveguide arrays support new types of\nlocalized modes that exist even in the linear case, in complete contrast to\nlocalized excitations in nonrotating arrays requiring nonlinearity for their\nexistence and forming above the energy flow threshold. These new modes appear\neither around array center, since rotation leads to the emergence of the\neffective attractive potential with a minimum at the rotation axis, or in the\narray corners, in which case localization occurs due to competition between\ncentrifugal force (in terms of quasi-particle analogy) and total internal\nreflection at the interface of the truncated array. The degree of localization\nof the central and corner modes mediated by rotation increases with rotation\nfrequency. Stable rotating soliton families bifurcating from linear modes are\nanalyzed in both focusing and defocusing media.\n", "  We have observed the dust continuum of ten z=3.1 Lyman Break Galaxies with\nthe Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array at ~450 mas resolution in Band\n7. We detect and resolve the 870um emission in one of the targets with an\nintegrated flux density of S(870)=(192+/-57) uJy, and measure a stacked 3-sigma\nsignal of S(870)=(67+/-23) uJy for the remaining nine. The total infrared\nluminosities estimated from full spectral energy distribution fits are\nL(8-1000um)=(8.4+/-2.3)x10^10 Lsun for the detection and\nL(8-1000um)=(2.9+/-0.9)x10^10 Lsun for the stack. With HST ACS I-band imaging\nwe map the rest-frame UV emission on the same scale as the dust, effectively\nresolving the 'infrared excess' (IRX=L_FIR/L_UV) in a normal galaxy at z=3.\nIntegrated over the galaxy we measure IRX=0.56+/-0.15, and the galaxy-averaged\nUV slope is beta=-1.25+/-0.03. This puts the galaxy a factor of ~10 below the\nIRX-beta relation for local starburst nuclei of Meurer et al. (1999). However,\nIRX varies by more than a factor of 3 across the galaxy, and we conclude that\nthe complex relative morphology of the dust relative to UV emission is largely\nresponsible for the scatter in the IRX-beta relation at high-z. A naive\napplication of a Meurer-like dust correction based on the UV slope would\ndramatically over-estimate the total star formation rate, and our results\nsupport growing evidence that when integrated over the galaxy, the typical\nconditions in high-z star-forming galaxies are not analogous to those in the\nlocal starburst nuclei used to establish the Meurer relation.\n", "  We demonstrate the interplay between quantum well states in Pd and the\nmagnetic anisotropy in Pd/Co/Cu(001) by combined scanning tunneling\nspectroscopy (STS) and magneto optical Kerr effect (MOKE) measurements. Low\ntemperature scanning tunneling spectroscopy reveals occupied and unoccupied\nquantum well states (QWS) in atomically flat Pd films on Co/Cu(001). These\nstates give rise to sharp peaks in the differential conductance spectra. A\nquantitative analysis of the spectra reveals the electronic dispersion of the\nPd(001) d-band ($\\Delta$$_5$-type) along the $\\Gamma$-X direction.\n\\textit{In-situ} MOKE experiments on Pd/Co/Cu(1, 1, 13) uncover a periodic\nvariation of the in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy as a function of Pd\nthickness with a period of 6 atomic layers Pd. STS shows that QWS in Pd cross\nthe Fermi level with the same periodicity of 6 atomic layers. Backed by\nprevious theoretical work we ascribe the variation of the magnetic anisotropy\nin Co to QWS in the Pd overlayer. Our results suggest a novel venue towards\ntailoring uniaxial magnetic anisotropy of ferromagnetic films by exploiting QWS\nin an adjacent material with large spin-orbit coupling.\n", "  Recently the first finding of a spin period of an accreting neutron star in\nM31 is reported. The observed spin period is 1.2 s and it shows 1.27 d\nmodulations due to orbital motion. From the orbital information, the mass donor\ncould not be a giant massive star. On the other hand, the observed properties\nare quite odd for typical low mass X-ray binaries. In this study, we compare\nobserved binary parameters with theoretical models given by a stellar evolution\ntrack and make a restriction on the possible mass range of the donor. According\nto the standard stellar evolution model, the donor star should be larger than\n1.5 solar mass, and this suggests that this system is a new member of a rare\ncategory, intermediate mass X-ray binary. The magnetic field strength of the\nneutron star suggested by spin-up/down tendency in this system supports the\npossibility of intermediate mass donor.\n", "  Viscous diffusion can broaden the rapidity dependence of two-particle\ntransverse momentum fluctuations. Surprisingly, measurements at RHIC by the\nSTAR collaboration demonstrate that this broadening is accompanied by the\nappearance of unanticipated structure in the rapidity distribution of these\nfluctuations in the most central collisions. Although a first order classical\nNavier-Stokes theory can roughly explain the rapidity broadening, it cannot\nexplain the additional structure. We propose that the rapidity structure can be\nexplained using the second order causal Israel-Stewart hydrodynamics with\nstochastic noise.\n", "  We compute the dominant, logarithmically enhanced radiative corrections to\nthe electron spectrum in the bound muon decay in the whole experimentally\ninteresting range. The corrected spectrum fits well the TWIST results. The\nremaining theoretical error, dominated by the nuclear charge distribution, can\nbe reduced in the muon-electron conversion searches by measuring the spectrum\nslightly below the New Physics signal window.\n", "  We proposed a scheme to achieve one-way acoustic propagation and even odd\nmode switching in two mutually perpendicular sonic crystal waveguides connected\nby a resonant cavity. The even mode in the entrance waveguide is able to switch\nto odd mode in the exit waveguide through a symmetry match between the cavity\nresonant modes and the waveguide modes. Conversely, the odd mode in the exit\nwaveguide is unable to be converted into the even mode in the entrance\nwaveguide as incident waves and eigenmodes are mismatched in their symmetries\nat the waveguide exit. This one way mechanism can be applied to design an\nacoustic diode for acoustic integration devices and can be used as a convertor\nof the acoustic waveguide modes.\n", "  The underlying physics behind the molecular harmonic emission in relatively\nlong sin$^2$-like laser pulses is investigated. We numerically solved the\nfull-dimensional electronic time-dependent Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation beyond the\nBorn-Oppenheimer approximation for simple molecular ion H$_2^+$. The occurrence\nand the effect of electron localization, non-adiabatic redshift and spatially\nasymmetric emission are evaluated to understand better complex patterns\nappearing in the high-order harmonic generation (HHG) spectrum.\n  Results show that the complex patterns in the HHG spectrum originate mainly\nfrom a non-adiabatic response of the molecule to the rapidly changing laser\nfield and also from a spatially asymmetric emission along the polarization\ndirection. The effect of electron localization on the HHG spectrum was not\nobserved as opposed to what is reported in the literature.\n", "  Metallic coplanar microwave resonators are widely employed at room\ntemperature, but their low-temperature performance has received little\nattention so far. We characterize compact copper coplanar resonators with\nmultiple modes from 2.5 to 20 GHz at temperatures as low as 5 K. We investigate\nthe influence of center conductor width (20 to 100 {\\mu}m) and coupling gap\nsize (10 to 50 {\\mu}m), and we observe a strong increase of quality factor (Q)\nfor wider center conductors, reaching values up to 470. The magnetic-field\ndependence of the resonators is weak, with a maximum change in Q of 3.5% for an\napplied field of 7 T. This makes these metallic resonators well suitable for\nmagnetic resonance studies, as we document with electron spin resonance (ESR)\nmeasurements at multiple resonance frequencies.\n", "  We study the triggering of single filaments due to turbulence in the beam\npath for a laser of power below the filamenting threshold. Turbulence can act\nas a switch between the beam not filamenting and producing single filaments.\nThis 'positive' effect of turbulence on the filament probability, combined with\nour observation of off-axis filaments suggests the underlying mechanism is\nmodulation instability caused by transverse perturbations. We hereby\nexperimentally explore the interaction of modulation instability and\nturbulence, commonly associated with multiple-filaments, in the single-filament\nregime.\n", "  We present the discovery of a brown dwarf companion to the debris disk host\nstar HR 2562. This object, discovered with the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI), has\na projected separation of 20.3$\\pm$0.3 au (0.618$\\pm$0.004\") from the star.\nWith the high astrometric precision afforded by GPI, we have confirmed common\nproper motion of HR 2562B with the star with only a month time baseline between\nobservations to more than $5\\sigma$. Spectral data in $J$, $H$, and $K$ bands\nshow morphological similarity to L/T transition objects. We assign a spectral\ntype of L7$\\pm$3 to HR 2562B, and derive a luminosity of $\\log$(L$_{\\rm\nbol}$/L$_{\\odot}$)=-4.62$\\pm$0.12, corresponding to a mass of 30$\\pm$15 M$_{\\rm\nJup}$ from evolutionary models at an estimated age of the system of 300-900\nMyr. Although the uncertainty in the age of the host star is significant, the\nspectra and photometry exhibit several indications of youth for HR 2562B. The\nsource has a position angle consistent with an orbit in the same plane as the\ndebris disk recently resolved with Herschel. Additionally, it appears to be\ninterior to the debris disk. Though the extent of the inner hole is currently\ntoo uncertain to place limits on the mass of HR 2562B, future observations of\nthe disk with higher spatial resolution may be able to provide mass\nconstraints. This is the first brown dwarf-mass object found to reside in the\ninner hole of a debris disk, offering the opportunity to search for evidence of\nformation above the deuterium burning limit in a circumstellar disk.\n", "  The structures and dynamics of molecular, atomic, and ionized gases are\nstudied around a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN) with a small\n($2\\times 10^6 M_\\odot$) black hole using 3D radiation hydrodynamic\nsimulations. We studied, for the first time, the non-equilibrium chemistry for\nthe X-ray dominated region in the \"radiation-driven fountain\" (Wada 2012) with\nsupernova feedback. A double hollow cone structure is naturally formed without\npostulating a thick \"torus\" around a central source. The cone is occupied with\nan inhomogeneous, diffuse ionized gas and surrounded by a geometrically thick\n($h/r \\gtrsim 1$) atomic gas. Dense molecular gases are distributed near the\nequatorial plane, and energy feedback from supernovae enhances their scale\nheight. Molecular hydrogen exists in a hot phase ( > 1000 K) as well as in a\ncold ( < 100 K), dense ( >$10^3$ cm$^{-3}$) phase. The velocity dispersion of\nH$_2$ in the vertical direction is comparable to the rotational velocity, which\nis consistent with near infrared observations of nearby Seyfert galaxies. Using\n3D radiation transfer calculations for the dust emission, we find polar\nemission in the mid-infrared band (12$\\mu m$), which is associated with bipolar\noutflows, as suggested in recent interferometric observations of nearby AGNs.\nIf the viewing angle for the nucleus is larger than 75 deg, the spectral energy\ndistribution (~ 2 -- 60 $\\mu m$) of this model is consistent with that of the\nCircinus galaxy. The multi-phase interstellar medium observed in\noptical/infrared and X-ray observations is also discussed.\n", "  We study a stochastic model of gene expression, in which protein production\nhas a form of random bursts whose size distribution is arbitrary, whereas\nprotein decay is a first-order reaction. We find exact analytical expressions\nfor the time evolution of the cumulant-generating function for the most general\ncase when both the burst size probability distribution and the model parameters\ndepend on time in an arbitrary (e.g. oscillatory) manner, and for arbitrary\ninitial conditions. We show that in the case of periodic external activation\nand constant protein degradation rate, the response of the gene is analogous to\nthe RC low-pass filter, where slow oscillations of the external driving have a\ngreater effect on gene expression than the fast ones. We also demonstrate that\nthe $n$-th cumulant of the protein number distribution depends on the $n$-th\nmoment of the burst size distribution. We use these results to show that\ndifferent measures of noise (coefficient of variation, Fano factor, fractional\nchange of variance) may vary in time in a different manner. Therefore, any\nbiological hypothesis of evolutionary optimization based on the nonmonotonicity\nof a chosen measure of noise must justify why it assumes that biological\nevolution quantifies noise in that particular way. Finally, we show that not\nonly for exponentially distributed burst sizes but also for a wider class of\nburst size distributions (e.g. Dirac delta and gamma) the control of gene\nexpression level by burst frequency modulation gives rise to proportional\nscaling of variance of the protein number distribution to its mean, whereas the\ncontrol by amplitude modulation implies proportionality of protein number\nvariance to the mean squared.\n", "  In this paper we consider heterogeneous diffusion processes with the\npower-law dependence of the diffusion coefficient on the position and\ninvestigate the influence of external forces on the resulting anomalous\ndiffusion. The heterogeneous diffusion processes can yield subdiffusion as well\nas superdiffusion, depending on the behavior of the diffusion coefficient. We\nassume that not only the diffusion coefficient but also the external force has\na power-law dependence on the position. We obtain analytic expressions for the\ntransition probability in two cases: when the power-law exponent in the\nexternal force is equal to 2eta-1, where 2eta is the power-law exponent in the\ndependence of the diffusion coefficient on the position, and when the external\nforce has a linear dependence on the position. We found that the power-law\nexponent in the dependence of the mean square displacement on time does not\ndepend on the external force, this force changes only the anomalous diffusion\ncoefficient. In addition, the external force having the power-law exponent\ndifferent from 2eta-1 limits the time interval where the anomalous diffusion\noccurs. We expect that the results obtained in this paper may be relevant for a\nmore complete understanding of anomalous diffusion processes.\n", "  We use D1 gray molasses to achieve Bose-Einstein condensation of a large\nnumber of $^{41}$K atoms in an optical dipole trap. By combining a new\nconfiguration of compressed-MOT with D1 gray molasses, we obtain a cold sample\nof $2.4\\times10^9$ atoms with a temperature as low as 42 $\\mu$K. After\nmagnetically transferring the atoms into the final glass cell, we perform a\ntwo-stage evaporative cooling. A condensate with up to $1.2\\times10^6$ atoms in\nthe lowest Zeeman state $|F=1,m_F=1\\rangle$ is achieved in the optical dipole\ntrap. Furthermore, we observe two narrow Feshbach resonances in the lowest\nhyperfine channel, which are in good agreement with theoretical predictions.\n", "  Silicon photonics promises to address the challenges for next-generation\nshort-reach optical interconnects. Growing bandwidth demand in hyper-scale data\ncenters and high-performance computing motivates the development of faster and\nmore-efficient silicon photonics links. While it is challenging to raise the\nserial line rate, further scaling of the data rate can be realized by, for\nexample, increasing the number of parallel fibers, increasing the number of\nwavelengths per fiber, and using multi-level pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM).\nAmong these approaches, PAM has a unique advantage because it does not require\nextra lasers or a costly overhaul of optical fiber cablings within the existing\ninfrastructure. Here, we demonstrate the first fully monolithically integrated\nsilicon photonic four-level PAM (PAM-4) transmitter operating at 56 Gb/s and\ndemonstrate error-free transmission (bit-error-rate < 10$^{-12}$) up to 50 Gb/s\nwithout forward error correction. The superior PAM-4 waveform is enabled by\noptimization of silicon traveling wave modulators and monolithic integration of\nthe CMOS driver circuits. Our results show that monolithic silicon photonics\ntechnology is a promising platform for future ultrahigh data rate optical\ninterconnects.\n", "  The recently observed possible antimagnetic rotation band in $^{101}$Pd is\ninvestigated by the cranked shell model with pairing correlations treated by a\nparticle-number conserving method, in which the blocking effects are taken into\naccount exactly. The experimental moments of inertia and reduced $B(E2)$\ntransition probabilities and their variations with the rotational frequency\n$\\omega$ are well reproduced. By analyzing the $\\omega$-dependence of the\noccupation probability of each cranked Nilsson orbital near the Fermi surface\nand the contributions of valence orbitals in each major shell to the total\nangular momentum alignment, the upbending mechanism of $\\nu h_{11/2}$ in\n$^{101}$Pd is understood clearly. The proton angular momentum alignment and its\ninfluence on the two-shears-like mechanism are also discussed.\n", "  We investigate experimentally the plasma dynamics of a centimeter-scale,\nlaser filamentation-guided spark discharge. Using electrical and optical\ndiagnostics to study monopolar discharges with varying current pulses we show\nthat plasma decay is dominated by free electron recombination if the current\ndecay time is shorter than the recombination characteristic time. In the\nopposite case, the plasma electron density closely follows the current\nevolution. We demonstrate that this criterion holds true in the case of damped\nAC sparks, and that alternative current is the best option to achieve a long\nplasma lifetime for a given peak current.\n", "  In this paper we study two entropic dynamical models from the viewpoint of\ninformation geometry. We study the geometry structures of the associated\nstatistical manifolds. In order to analyse the character of the instability of\nthe systems, we obtain their geodesics and compute their Jacobi vector fields.\nThe results of this work improve and extend a recent advance in this topics\nstudied in [13]\n", "  Three dimensional structure of the Aquila Rift of magnetized neutral gas is\ninvestigated by analyzing HI and CO line data. The projected distance on the\nGalactic plane of the HI arch of the Rift is ~250 pc from the Sun. The HI arch\nemerges at l~ 30 deg, reaches to altitudes as high as ~ 500 pc above the plane\nat l~ 350deg, and returns to the disk at l~270 deg. The extent of arch at\npositive latitudes is ~1 kpc and radius is ~100 pc. The eastern root is\nassociated with the giant molecular cloud complex, which is the main body of\nthe optically defined Aquila Rift. The HI and molecular masses of the Rift are\nestimated to be M_HI~1.4x10^5Msun and M_H2 ~3x10^5 Msun. Gravitational energies\nto lift the gases to their heights are E_grav: HI ~1.4x10^51 and E_grav: H_2\n~0.3x10^51 erg, respectively. Magnetic field is aligned along the HI arch of\nthe Rift, and the strength is measured to be B~10 microG using Faraday rotation\nmeasures of extragalactic radio sources. The magnetic energy is estimated to be\nE_mag~1.2x10^51 erg. A possible mechanism of formation of the Aquila Rift is\nproposed in terms of interstellar magnetic inflation by a sinusoidal Parker\ninstability of wavelength of ~2.5 kpc and amplitude ~500 pc.\n", "  We consider the problem of retrieving the aerosol extinction coefficient from\nRaman lidar measurements. This is an ill--posed inverse problem that needs\nregularization, and we propose to use the Expectation--Maximization (EM)\nalgorithm to provide stable solutions. Indeed, EM is an iterative algorithm\nthat imposes a positivity constraint on the solution, and provides\nregularization if iterations are stopped early enough. We describe the\nalgorithm and propose a stopping criterion inspired by a statistical principle.\nWe then discuss its properties concerning the spatial resolution. Finally, we\nvalidate the proposed approach by using both synthetic data and experimental\nmeasurements; we compare the reconstructions obtained by EM with those obtained\nby the Tikhonov method, by the Levenberg-Marquardt method, as well as those\nobtained by combining data smoothing and numerical derivation.\n", "  Two-dimensional (2D) massless Dirac electrons appear on a surface of\nthree-dimensional topological insulators. The conductivity of such a 2D Dirac\nelectron system is studied for strong topological insulators in the case of the\nFermi level being located at the Dirac point. The average conductivity\n$\\langle\\sigma\\rangle$ is numerically calculated for a system of length $L$ and\nwidth $W$ under the periodic or antiperiodic boundary condition in the\ntransverse direction, and its behavior is analyzed by applying a finite-size\nscaling approach. It is shown that $\\langle\\sigma\\rangle$ is minimized at the\nclean limit, where it becomes scale-invariant and depends only on $L/W$ and the\nboundary condition. It is also shown that once disorder is introduced,\n$\\langle\\sigma\\rangle$ monotonically increases with increasing $L$. Hence, the\nsystem becomes a perfect metal in the limit of $L \\to \\infty$ except at the\nclean limit, which should be identified as an unstable fixed point. Although\nthe scaling curve of $\\langle\\sigma\\rangle$ strongly depends on $L/W$ and the\nboundary condition near the unstable fixed point, it becomes almost independent\nof them with increasing $\\langle\\sigma\\rangle$, implying that it asymptotically\nobeys a universal law.\n", "  Enhancement-mode Si/SiGe electron quantum dots have been pursued extensively\nby many groups for \\revEdit{their} potential in quantum computing. Most of the\nreported dot designs utilize multiple metal-gate layers and use Si/SiGe\nheterostructures with Ge concentration close to 30\\%. Here we report the\nfabrication and low-temperature characterization of quantum dots in\nSi/Si$_{0.8}$Ge$_{0.2}$ heterostructures using only one metal-gate layer. We\nfind that the threshold voltage of a channel narrower than 1 $\\mu$m increases\nas the width decreases. The higher threshold can be attributed to the\ncombination of quantum confinement and disorder. We also find that the lower Ge\nratio used here leads to a narrower operational gate bias range. The higher\nthreshold combined with the limited gate bias range constrains the device\ndesign of lithographic quantum dots. We incorporate such considerations in our\ndevice design and demonstrate a quantum dot that can be tuned from a single dot\nto a double dot. The device uses only a single metal-gate layer, greatly\nsimplifying device design and fabrication.\n", "  We present $\\sim$100 pc resolution Hubble Space Telescope H$\\alpha$ images of\n10 galaxies from the DYnamics of Newly-Assembled Massive Objects (DYNAMO)\nsurvey of low-$z$ turbulent disk galaxies, and use these to undertake the first\ndetailed systematic study of the effects of resolution and clump clustering on\nobservations of clumps in turbulent disks. In the DYNAMO-{\\em HST} sample we\nmeasure clump diameters spanning the range $d_{clump} \\sim 100-800$~pc, and\nindividual clump star formation rates as high as $\\sim5$~M$_{\\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$.\nDYNAMO clumps have very high SFR surface densities, $\\Sigma_{SFR}\\sim\n15$~M$_{\\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$~kpc$^{-2}$, $\\sim100\\times$ higher than in H{\\sc ii}\nregions of nearby spirals. Indeed, SFR surface density provides a simple\ndividing line between massive star forming clumps and local star forming\nregions, where massive star forming clumps have $\\Sigma_{SFR}>\n0.5$~M$_{\\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$~kpc$^{-2}$. When degraded to match the observations\nof galaxies in $z\\sim 1-3$ surveys, DYNAMO galaxies are similar in morphology\nand measured clump properties to clumpy galaxies observed in the high-$z$\nUniverse. Emission peaks in the simulated high-redshift maps typically\ncorrespond to multiple clumps in full resolution images. This clustering of\nclumps systematically increases the apparent size and SFR of clumps in 1~kpc\nresolution maps, and decreases the measured SFR surface density of clumps by as\nmuch as a factor of 20$\\times$. From these results we can infer that clump\nclustering is likely to strongly effect the measured properties of clumps in\nhigh-$z$ galaxies, which commonly have kiloparsec scale resolution.\n", "  We investigate the connections between some simple Maier-Saupe lattice\nmodels, with a discrete choice of orientations of the microscopic directors,\nand a recent proposal of a two-tensor formalism to describe the phase diagrams\nof nematic liquid-crystalline systems. This two-tensor proposal is used to\nformulate the statistical problem in terms of fully-connected lattice\nHamiltonians, with the local nematic directors restricted to the Cartesian\naxes. Depending on the choice of interaction parameters, we regain all of the\nmain features of the original mean-field two-tensor calculations. With a\nstandard choice of parameters, we obtain the well-known sequence of isotropic,\nuniaxial, and biaxial nematic structures, with a Landau multicritical point.\nWith another suitably chosen set of parameters, we obtain two tricritical\npoints, according to some recent predictions of the two-tensor calculations.\nThe simple statistical lattice models are quite easy to work with, for all\nvalues of parameters, and the present calculations can be carried out beyond\nthe mean-field level.\n", "  We present an analysis of high-quality photometry for globular clusters (GCs)\nin the Virgo cluster core region, based on data from the Next Generation Virgo\nCluster Survey (NGVS) pilot field, and in the Milky Way (MW) based on\nVLT/X-Shooter spectrophotometry. We find significant discrepancies in\ncolor-color diagrams between sub-samples from different environments,\nconfirming that the environment has a strong influence on the integrated colors\nof GCs. GC color distributions along a single color are not sufficient to\ncapture the differences we observe in color-color space. While the average\nphotometric colors become bluer with increasing radial distance to the cD\ngalaxy M87, we also find a relation between the environment and the slope and\nintercept of the color-color relations. A denser environment seems to produce a\nlarger dynamic range in certain color indices. We argue that these results are\nnot due solely to differential extinction, IMF variations, calibration\nuncertainties, or overall age/metallicity variations. We therefore suggest that\nthe relation between the environment and GC colors is, at least in part, due to\nchemical abundance variations, which affect stellar spectra and stellar\nevolution tracks. Our results demonstrate that stellar population diagnostics\nderived from model predictions which are calibrated on one particular sample of\nGCs may not be appropriate for all extragalactic GCs. These results advocate a\nmore complex model of the assembly history of GC systems in massive galaxies\nthat goes beyond the simple bimodality found in previous decades.\n", "  LkCa 15 hosts a pre-transitional disk as well as at least one accreting\nprotoplanet orbiting in its gap. Previous disk observations have focused mainly\non the outer disk, which is cleared inward of ~50 au. The planet candidates, on\nthe other hand, reside at orbital radii around 15 au, where disk observations\nhave been unreliable until recently. Here we present new J-band imaging\npolarimetry of LkCa 15 with SPHERE IRDIS, yielding the most accurate and\ndetailed scattered-light images of the disk to date down to the planet-hosting\ninner regions. We find what appear to be persistent asymmetric structures in\nthe scattering material at the location of the planet candidates, which could\nbe responsible at least for parts of the signals measured with sparse-aperture\nmasking. These images further allow us to trace the gap edge in scattered light\nat all position angles and search the inner and outer disks for morphological\nsubstructure. The outer disk appears smooth with slight azimuthal variations in\npolarized surface brightness, which may be due to shadowing from the inner disk\nor a two-peaked polarized phase function. We find that the near-side gap edge\nrevealed by polarimetry matches the sharp crescent seen in previous ADI imaging\nvery well. Finally, the ratio of polarized disk to stellar flux is more than\nsix times larger in J-band than in the RI bands.\n", "  Exotic topological states of matter such as Floquet topological insulator or\nFloquet Weyl semimetal can be induced by periodic driving. This work proposes a\nFloquet semimetal with Floquet-band holonomy. That is, the system is gapless,\nbut as a periodic parameter viewed as quasimomentum of a synthetic dimension\ncompletes an adiabatic cycle, each Floquet band as a whole exchanges with other\nFloquet bands. The dynamical manifestations of such Floquet-band holonomy are\nstudied. Under open boundary conditions, we discover anomalous chiral edge\nmodes localized only at one edge, winding around the entire quasienergy\nBrillouin zone, well separated from bulk states, and possessing holonomy\ndifferent from bulk states. These remarkable properties are further exploited\nto realize quantized or half-quantized edge state pumping.\n", "  We present the results of hydrodynamical simulations of the orbital evolution\nof planets undergoing runaway gas accretion in radiative discs. We consider\naccreting disc models with constant mass flux through the disc, and where\nradiative cooling balances the effect of viscous heating and stellar\nirradiation. We assume that 20-30 $M_\\oplus$ giant planet cores are formed in\nthe region where viscous heating dominates and migrate outward under the action\nof a strong corotation torque. In the case where gas accretion is neglected, we\nfind evidence for strong dynamical torques in accreting discs with accretion\nrates ${\\dot M}\\gtrsim 7\\times 10^{-8} \\;M_\\odot/yr$. Their main effect is to\nincrease outward migration rates by a factor of $\\sim 2$ typically. In the\npresence of gas accretion, however, runaway outward migration is observed with\nthe planet passing through the zero-torque radius and the transition between\nthe viscous heating and stellar heating dominated regimes. The ability for an\naccreting planet to enter a fast migration regime is found to depend strongly\non the planet growth rate, but can occur for values of the mass flux through\nthe disc of ${\\dot M}\\gtrsim 5\\times 10^{-8} \\;M_\\odot/yr$. We find that an\nepisode of runaway outward migration can cause an accreting planet formed in\nthe 5-10 AU region to temporarily orbit at star-planet separations as large as\n$\\sim$60-70 AU. However, increase in the amplitude of the Lindblad torque\nassociated with planet growth plus change in the streamline topology near the\nplanet systematically cause the direction of migration to be reversed. Our\nresults indicate that a planet can reach large orbital distances under the\ncombined effect of dynamical torques and gas accretion, but an alternative\nmechanism is required to explain the presence of massive planets on wide\norbits.\n", "  Cosmological models can be constrained by determining primordial abundances.\nAccurate predictions of the He I spectrum are needed to determine the\nprimordial helium abundance to a precision of $< 1$% in order to constrain Big\nBang Nucleosynthesis models. Theoretical line emissivities at least this\naccurate are needed if this precision is to be achieved. In the first paper of\nthis series, which focused on H I, we showed that differences in $l$-changing\ncollisional rate coefficients predicted by three different theories can\ntranslate into 10% changes in predictions for H I spectra. Here we consider the\nmore complicated case of He atoms, where low-$l$ subshells are not energy\ndegenerate. A criterion for deciding when the energy separation between $l$\nsubshells is small enough to apply energy-degenerate collisional theories is\ngiven. Moreover, for certain conditions, the Bethe approximation originally\nproposed by Pengelly & Seaton (1964) is not sufficiently accurate. We introduce\na simple modification of this theory which leads to rate coefficients which\nagree well with those obtained from pure quantal calculations using the\napproach of Vrinceanu et al. (2012). We show that the $l$-changing rate\ncoefficients from the different theoretical approaches lead to differences of\n$\\sim 10$% in He I emissivities in simulations of H II regions using spectral\ncode Cloudy.\n", "  SPIDERS (The SPectroscopic IDentification of eROSITA Sources) is a program\ndedicated to the homogeneous and complete spectroscopic follow-up of X-ray AGN\nand galaxy clusters over a large area ($\\sim$7500 deg$^2$) of the extragalactic\nsky. SPIDERS is part of the SDSS-IV project, together with the Extended Baryon\nOscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) and the Time-Domain Spectroscopic\nSurvey (TDSS). This paper describes the largest project within SPIDERS before\nthe launch of eROSITA: an optical spectroscopic survey of X-ray selected,\nmassive ($\\sim 10^{14}$ to $10^{15}~M_{\\odot}$) galaxy clusters discovered in\nROSAT and XMM-Newton imaging. The immediate aim is to determine precise\n($\\Delta_z \\sim 0.001$) redshifts for 4,000-5,000 of these systems out to $z\n\\sim 0.6$. The scientific goal of the program is precision cosmology, using\nclusters as probes of large-scale structure in the expanding Universe. We\npresent the cluster samples, target selection algorithms and observation\nstrategies. We demonstrate the efficiency of selecting targets using a\ncombination of SDSS imaging data, a robust red-sequence finder and a dedicated\nprioritization scheme. We describe a set of algorithms and work-flow developed\nto collate spectra and assign cluster membership, and to deliver catalogues of\nspectroscopically confirmed clusters. We discuss the relevance of line-of-sight\nvelocity dispersion estimators for the richer systems. We illustrate our\ntechniques by constructing a catalogue of 230 spectroscopically validated\nclusters ($0.031 < z < 0.658$), found in pilot observations. We discuss two\npotential science applications of the SPIDERS sample: the study of the X-ray\nluminosity-velocity dispersion ($L_X-\\sigma$) relation and the building of\nstacked phase-space diagrams.\n", "  We have investigated the charge dynamics and the nature of many-body\ninteractions in La- and Pr- doped CaFe2As2. From the infrared part of the\noptical conductivity, we discover that the scattering rate of mobile carriers\nabove 200 K exhibits saturation at the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit of metallic\ntransport. However, the dc resistivity continues to increase with temperature\nabove 200 K due to the loss of Drude spectral weight. The loss of Drude\nspectral weight with increasing temperature is seen in a wide temperature range\nin the uncollapsed tetragonal phase, and this spectral weight is recovered at\nenergy scales about one order of magnitude larger than the Fermi energy scale\nin these semimetals. The phenomena noted above have been observed previously in\nother correlated metals in which the dominant interactions are electronic in\norigin. Further evidence of significant electron-electron interactions is\nobtained from the presence of quadratic temperature and frequency-dependent\nterms in the scattering rate at low temperatures and frequencies in the\nuncollapsed tetragonal structures of La-doped and Pr-doped CaFe2As2. For\ntemperatures below the structure collapse transition in Pr-doped CaFe2As2 at 70\nK, the scattering rate decreases due to weakening of electronic correlations,\nand the Drude spectral weight decreases due to modification of the low-energy\nelectronic structure.\n", "  Single pulses preserve information about the pulsar radio emission and\npropagation in the pulsar magnetosphere, and understanding the behaviour of\ntheir variability is essential for estimating the fundamental limit on the\nachievable pulsar timing precision. Here we report the findings of our analysis\nof single pulses from PSR J1713+0747 with data collected by the Large European\nArray for Pulsars (LEAP). We present statistical studies of the pulse\nproperties that include distributions of their energy, phase and width. Two\nmodes of systematic sub-pulse drifting have been detected, with a periodicity\nof 7 and 3 pulse periods. The two modes appear at different ranges of pulse\nlongitude but overlap under the main peak of the integrated profile. No\nevidence for pulse micro-structure is seen with a time resolution down to 140\nns. In addition, we show that the fractional polarisation of single pulses\nincreases with their pulse peak flux density. By mapping the probability\ndensity of linear polarisation position angle with pulse longitude, we reveal\nthe existence of two orthogonal polarisation modes. Finally, we find that the\nresulting phase jitter of integrated profiles caused by single pulse\nvariability can be described by a Gaussian probability distribution only when\nat least 100 pulses are used for integration. Pulses of different flux\ndensities and widths contribute approximately equally to the phase jitter, and\nno improvement on timing precision is achieved by using a sub-set of pulses\nwith a specific range of flux density or width.\n", "  Kernel phase interferometry is an approach to high angular resolution imaging\nwhich enhances the performance of speckle imaging with adaptive optics. Kernel\nphases are self-calibrating observables that generalize the idea of closure\nphases from non-redundant arrays to telescopes with arbitrarily shaped pupils,\nby considering a matrix-based approximation to the diffraction problem. In this\npaper I discuss the recent history of kernel phase, in particular in the\nmatrix-based study of sparse arrays, and propose an analogous generalization of\nthe closure amplitude to kernel amplitudes. This new approach can\nself-calibrate throughput and scintillation errors in optical imaging, which\nextends the power of kernel phase-like methods to symmetric targets where\namplitude and not phase calibration can be a significant limitation, and will\nenable further developments in high angular resolution astronomy.\n", "  A discrete-time Quantum Walk (QW) is essentially an operator driving the\nevolution of a single particle on the lattice, through local unitaries. Some\nQWs admit a continuum limit, leading to familiar PDEs (e.g. the Dirac\nequation). Recently it was discovered that prior grouping and encoding allows\nfor more general continuum limit equations (e.g. the Dirac equation in $(1+1)$\ncurved spacetime). In this paper, we extend these results to arbitrary space\ndimension and internal degree of freedom. We recover an entire class of PDEs\nencompassing the massive Dirac equation in $(3+1)$ curved spacetime. This means\nthat the metric field can be represented by a field of local unitaries over a\nlattice.\n", "  We analyze eight epochs of Hubble Space Telescope H$\\alpha$+[N II] imaging of\nEta Carinae's outer ejecta. Proper motions of nearly 800 knots reveal that the\ndetected ejecta are divided into three apparent age groups, dating to around\n1250 A.D., to around 1550 A.D., and to during or shortly before the Great\nEruption of the 1840s. Ejecta from these groups reside in different locations\nand provide a firm constraint that Eta Car experienced multiple major eruptions\nprior to the 19th century. The 1250 and 1550 events did not share the same\naxisymmetry as the Homunculus; the 1250 event was particularly asymmetric, even\none-sided. In addition, the ejecta in the S ridge, which have been associated\nwith the Great Eruption, appear to predate the ejection of the Homunculus by\nseveral decades. We detect essentially ballistic expansion across multiple\nepochs. We find no evidence for large-scale deceleration of the observed knots\nthat could power the soft X-ray shell by plowing into surrounding material,\nsuggesting that the observed X-rays arise instead from fast, rarefied ejecta\nfrom the 1840s overtaking the older dense knots. Early deceleration and\nsubsequent coasting cannot explain the origin of the older outer\nejecta---significant episodic mass loss prior to the 19th century is required.\nThe timescale and geometry of the past eruptions provide important constraints\nfor any theoretical physical mechanisms driving Eta Car's behavior.\nNon-repeating mechanisms such as the merger of a close binary in a triple\nsystem would require additional complexities to explain the observations.\n", "  We present spatially-resolved two-dimensional stellar kinematics for the 41\nmost massive early-type galaxies (MK <~ -25.7 mag, stellar mass M* >~ 10^11.8\nMsun) of the volume-limited (D < 108 Mpc) MASSIVE survey. For each galaxy, we\nobtain high-quality spectra in the wavelength range of 3650 to 5850 A from the\n246-fiber Mitchell integral-field spectrograph (IFS) at McDonald Observatory,\ncovering a 107\" x 107\" field of view (often reaching 2 to 3 effective radii).\nWe measure the 2-D spatial distribution of each galaxy's angular momentum\n(lambda and fast or slow rotator status), velocity dispersion (sigma), and\nhigher-order non-Gaussian velocity features (Gauss-Hermite moments h3 to h6).\nOur sample contains a high fraction (~80% ) of slow and non-rotators with\nlambda <~ 0.2. When combined with the lower-mass ETGs in the ATLAS3D survey, we\nfind the fraction of slow-rotators to increase dramatically with galaxy mass,\nreaching ~50% at MK ~ -25.5 mag and ~90% at MK <~ -26 mag. All of our fast\nrotators show a clear anti-correlation between h3 and V/sigma, and the slope of\nthe anti-correlation is steeper in more round galaxies. The radial profiles of\nsigma show a clear luminosity and environmental dependence: the 12 most\nluminous galaxies in our sample (MK <~ -26 mag) are all brightest cluster/group\ngalaxies (except NGC 4874) and all have rising or nearly flat sigma profiles,\nwhereas five of the seven \"isolated\" galaxies are all fainter than MK = -25.8\nmag and have falling sigma. All of our galaxies have positive average h4; the\nmost luminous galaxies have average h4 ~ 0.05 while less luminous galaxies have\na range of values between 0 and 0.05. Most of our galaxies show positive radial\ngradients in h4, and those galaxies also tend to have rising sigma profiles. We\ndiscuss the implications for the relationship among dynamical mass, sigma, h4,\nand velocity anisotropy for these massive galaxies.\n", "  We have constructed an equation of state which smoothly interpolates between\nan excluded volume hadron resonance gas at low energy density to a plasma of\nquarks and gluons at high energy density. This crossover equation of state\nagrees very well with lattice calculations at both zero and nonzero baryon\nchemical potential. We use it to compute the variance, skewness, and kurtosis\nof fluctuations of baryon number, and compare to measurements of proton number\nfluctuations in central Au-Au collisions as measured by the STAR collaboration\nin a beam energy scan at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. The crossover\nequation of state can reproduce the data if the fluctuations are frozen out at\ntemperatures well below than the average chemical freeze-out.\n", "  The Lockman Hole is a well-studied extragalactic field with extensive\nmulti-band ancillary data covering a wide range in frequency, essential for\ncharacterising the physical and evolutionary properties of the various source\npopulations detected in deep radio fields (mainly star-forming galaxies and\nAGNs). In this paper we present new 150-MHz observations carried out with the\nLOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR), allowing us to explore a new spectral window for\nthe faint radio source population. This 150-MHz image covers an area of 34.7\nsquare degrees with a resolution of 18.6$\\times$14.7 arcsec and reaches an rms\nof 160 $\\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ at the centre of the field.\n  As expected for a low-frequency selected sample, the vast majority of sources\nexhibit steep spectra, with a median spectral index of\n$\\alpha_{150}^{1400}=-0.78\\pm0.015$. The median spectral index becomes slightly\nflatter (increasing from $\\alpha_{150}^{1400}=-0.84$ to\n$\\alpha_{150}^{1400}=-0.75$) with decreasing flux density down to $S_{150}\n\\sim$10 mJy before flattening out and remaining constant below this flux level.\nFor a bright subset of the 150-MHz selected sample we can trace the spectral\nproperties down to lower frequencies using 60-MHz LOFAR observations, finding\ntentative evidence for sources to become flatter in spectrum between 60 and 150\nMHz. Using the deep, multi-frequency data available in the Lockman Hole, we\nidentify a sample of 100 Ultra-steep spectrum (USS) sources and 13 peaked\nspectrum sources. We estimate that up to 21 percent of these could have $z>4$\nand are candidate high-$z$ radio galaxies, but further follow-up observations\nare required to confirm the physical nature of these objects.\n", "  High-redshift radio-loud quasars are used to, among other things, test the\npredictions of cosmological models, set constraints on black hole growth in the\nearly universe and understand galaxy evolution. Prior to this paper, 20\nextragalactic radio sources at redshifts above 4.5 have been imaged with very\nlong baseline interferometry (VLBI). Here we report on observations of an\nadditional ten z>4.5 sources at 1.7 and 5 GHz with the European VLBI Network\n(EVN), thereby increasing the number of imaged sources by 50%. Combining our\nnewly observed sources with those from the literature, we create a substantial\nsample of 30 z>4.5 VLBI sources, allowing us to study the nature of these\nobjects. Using spectral indices, variability and brightness temperatures, we\nconclude that of the 27 sources with sufficient information to classify, the\nradio emission from one source is from star formation, 13 are flat-spectrum\nradio quasars and 13 are steep-spectrum sources. We also argue that the\nsteep-spectrum sources are off-axis (unbeamed) radio sources with rest-frame\nself-absorption peaks at or below GHz frequencies and that these sources can be\nclassified as gigahertz peaked-spectrum (GPS) and megahertz peaked-spectrum\n(MPS) sources.\n", "  We revisit the photometric variability of stars in the M 67 field using\nKepler/K2-Campaign-5 light curves. In our previous work, we limited the search\narea around M\\,67 to that of a recent ground-based study. In the present work,\nwe expand the search area and apply a more rigorous period-finding algorithm to\ndetermine the rotation periods of 98 main sequence cluster members from the\nsame data. In addition, we derive periods of 40 stars from the K2SC detrended\nlight curves. We determine the mean period of single sun-like main sequence\ncluster members to be $29.6 \\pm 0.6$ d. Assuming the periods correspond to\nstellar rotation, the corresponding mean gyro-age is $5.4 \\pm 0.2$ Gyr.\n", "  We study, using Density Functional theory and Monte Carlo simulations,\naqueous electrolyte solutions between charged infinite planar surfaces, in a\ncontact with a bulk salt reservoir. In agreement with recent experimental\nobservations [Z. Luo et al., Nat. Comm. 6, 6358 (2015)], we find that the\nconfined electrolyte lacks local charge neutrality. We show that a Density\nFunctional Theory (DFT) based on a bulk- HNC expansion properly accounts for\nstrong electrostatic correlations and allows us to accurately calculate the\nionic density profiles between the charged surfaces, even for electrolytes\ncontaining trivalent counterions. The DFT allows us to explore the degree of\nlocal charge neutrality violation, as a function of plate separation and bulk\nelectrolyte concentration, and to accurately calculate the interaction force\nbetween the charged surfaces.\n", "  We present average R-band optopolarimetric data, as well as variability\nparameters, from the first and second RoboPol observing season. We investigate\nwhether gamma- ray--loud and gamma-ray--quiet blazars exhibit systematic\ndifferences in their optical polarization properties. We find that\ngamma-ray--loud blazars have a systematically higher polarization fraction\n(0.092) than gamma-ray--quiet blazars (0.031), with the hypothesis of the two\nsamples being drawn from the same distribution of polarization fractions being\nrejected at the 3{\\sigma} level. We have not found any evidence that this\ndiscrepancy is related to differences in the redshift distribution, rest-frame\nR-band lu- minosity density, or the source classification. The median\npolarization fraction versus synchrotron-peak-frequency plot shows an envelope\nimplying that high synchrotron- peaked sources have a smaller range of median\npolarization fractions concentrated around lower values. Our gamma-ray--quiet\nsources show similar median polarization fractions although they are all low\nsynchrotron-peaked. We also find that the random- ness of the polarization\nangle depends on the synchrotron peak frequency. For high synchrotron-peaked\nsources it tends to concentrate around preferred directions while for low\nsynchrotron-peaked sources it is more variable and less likely to have a pre-\nferred direction. We propose a scenario which mediates efficient particle\nacceleration in shocks and increases the helical B-field component immediately\ndownstream of the shock.\n"]}
