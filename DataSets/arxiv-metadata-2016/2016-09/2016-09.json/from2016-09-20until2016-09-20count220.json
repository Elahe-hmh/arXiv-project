"abstract": ["  We have measured polarized Raman scattering spectra of the\nFe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$Sb$_{2}$ and Fe$_{1-x}$Cr$_{x}$Sb$_{2}$ (0$\\leq x\\leq $0.5)\nsingle crystals in the temperature range between 15 K and 300 K. The highest\nenergy $B_{1g}$ symmetry mode shows significant line asymmetry due to phonon\nmode coupling width electronic background. The coupling constant achieves the\nhighest value at about 40 K and after that it remains temperature independent.\nOrigin of additional mode broadening is pure anharmonic. Below 40 K the\ncoupling is drastically reduced, in agreement with transport properties\nmeasurements. Alloying of FeSb$_2$ with Co and Cr produces the B$_{1g}$ mode\nnarrowing, i.e. weakening of the electron-phonon interaction. In the case of\nA$_{g}$ symmetry modes we have found a significant mode mixing.\n", "  The Q/U Imaging ExperimenT (QUIET) is designed to measure polarization in the\nCosmic Microwave Background, targeting the imprint of inflationary\ngravitational waves at large angular scales (~ 1 degree). Between 2008 October\nand 2010 December, two independent receiver arrays were deployed sequentially\non a 1.4 m side-fed Dragonian telescope. The polarimeters which form the focal\nplanes use a highly compact design based on High Electron Mobility Transistors\n(HEMTs) that provides simultaneous measurements of the Stokes parameters Q, U,\nand I in a single module. The 17-element Q-band polarimeter array, with a\ncentral frequency of 43.1 GHz, has the best sensitivity (69 uK sqrt(s)) and the\nlowest instrumental systematic errors ever achieved in this band, contributing\nto the tensor-to-scalar ratio at r < 0.1. The 84-element W-band polarimeter\narray has a sensitivity of 87 uK sqrt(s) at a central frequency of 94.5 GHz. It\nhas the lowest systematic errors to date, contributing at r < 0.01. The two\narrays together cover multipoles in the range l= 25-975. These are the largest\nHEMT-based arrays deployed to date. This article describes the design,\ncalibration, performance of, and sources of systematic error for the\ninstrument.\n", "  This work's purpose is to understand the dynamics of some social systems\nwhose properties can be captured by certain iterated function systems. To\nachieve this intension, we start from the theory of iterated function systems,\nand then we study two specific economic models on random utility function and\noptimal stochastic growth.\n", "  We present a new test of hypothesis in which we seek the probability of the\nnull conditioned on the data, where the null is a simplification undertaken to\ncounter the intractability of the more complex model, that the simpler null\nmodel is nested within. With the more complex model rendered intractable, the\nnull model uses a simplifying assumption that capacitates the learning of an\nunknown parameter vector given the data. Bayes factors are shown to be known\nonly up to a ratio of unknown data-dependent constants--a problem that cannot\nbe cured using prescriptions similar to those suggested to solve the problem\ncaused to Bayes factor computation, by non-informative priors. Thus, a new test\nis needed in which we can circumvent Bayes factor computation. In this test, we\nundertake generation of data from the model in which the null hypothesis is\ntrue and can achieve support in the measured data for the null by comparing the\nmarginalised posterior of the model parameter given the measured data, to that\ngiven such generated data. However, such a ratio of marginalised posteriors can\nconfound interpretation of comparison of support in one measured data for a\nnull, with that in another data set for a different null. Given an application\nin which such comparison is undertaken, we alternatively define support in a\nmeasured data set for a null by identifying the model parameters that are less\nconsistent with the measured data than is minimally possible given the\ngenerated data, and realising that the higher the number of such parameter\nvalues, less is the support in the measured data for the null. Then, the\nprobability of the null conditional on the data is given within an MCMC-based\nscheme, by marginalising the posterior given the measured data, over parameter\nvalues that are as, or more consistent with the measured data, than with the\ngenerated data.\n", "  In the present paper and the companion paper [8] a probabilistic (statistical\nmechanical) approach to the study of canonical metrics and measures on a\ncomplex algebraic variety X is introduced. On any such variety with positive\nKodaira dimension a canonical (birationally invariant) random point processes\nis defined and shown to converge in probability towards a canonical\ndeterministic measure on X, coinciding with the canonical measure of Song-Tian\nand Tsuji. The proof is based on new large deviation principle for Gibbs\nmeasures with singular Hamiltonians which relies on an asymptotic submean\ninequality in large dimensions, proved in a companion paper. In the case of a\nvariety X of general type we obtain as a corollary that the (possibly singular)\nK\\\"ahler-Einstein metric on X with negative Ricci curvature is the limit of a\ncanonical sequence of quasi-explicit Bergman type metrics. In the opposite\nsetting of a Fano variety X we relate the canonical point processes to a new\nnotion of stability, that we call Gibbs stability, which admits a natural\nalgebro-geometric formulation and which we conjecture is equivalent to the\nexistence of a K\\\"ahler-Einstein metric on X and hence to K-stability as in the\nYau-Tian-Donaldson conjecture.\n", "  We examine the hypothesis that consciousness can be understood as a state of\nmatter, \"perceptronium\", with distinctive information processing abilities. We\nexplore five basic principles that may distinguish conscious matter from other\nphysical systems such as solids, liquids and gases: the information,\nintegration, independence, dynamics and utility principles. If such principles\ncan identify conscious entities, then they can help solve the quantum\nfactorization problem: why do conscious observers like us perceive the\nparticular Hilbert space factorization corresponding to classical space (rather\nthan Fourier space, say), and more generally, why do we perceive the world\naround us as a dynamic hierarchy of objects that are strongly integrated and\nrelatively independent? Tensor factorization of matrices is found to play a\ncentral role, and our technical results include a theorem about Hamiltonian\nseparability (defined using Hilbert-Schmidt superoperators) being maximized in\nthe energy eigenbasis. Our approach generalizes Giulio Tononi's integrated\ninformation framework for neural-network-based consciousness to arbitrary\nquantum systems, and we find interesting links to error-correcting codes,\ncondensed matter criticality, and the Quantum Darwinism program, as well as an\ninteresting connection between the emergence of consciousness and the emergence\nof time.\n", "  Coherence phenomena in four-level atomic system, cyclicly driven by three\ncoherent fields, are investigated thoroughly at zero and weak magnetic fields.\nEach strongly interacting atomic state is converted to a triplet due to a\ndynamical Stark effect. Two dark lines with a Fano-like profile are arising in\nthe triplet absorption spectrum with anomalous dispersions. We provide the\nconditions to control the widths of the transparency windows by means of the\nrelative phase of the driving fields and the intensity of the microwave field,\nthat closes the optical system loop. The effect of the Doppler broadening on\nresults of the triplet absorption spectroscopy is analysed in detail.\n", "  We estimate the rate of convergence, in the so-called large coupling limit,\nfor Schr\\\"odinger type operators on bounded domains. The Schr\\\"odinger we deal\nwith have \"interaction potentials\" supported in a compact inclusion. We show\nthat if the boundary of the inclusion is sufficiently smooth, one essentially\nrecovers the \"free Hamiltonian\" in the exterior domain with Dirichlet boundary\nconditions. In addition, we obtain a convergence rate, in $L^2$, that is\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\lambda^{-\\frac{1}{4}})$ where $\\lambda$ is the coupling\nparameter. Our methods include energy estimates, trace estimates, interpolation\nand duality.\n", "  In this paper we present a detailed critical study of several recently\nproposed non-Markovianity measures. We analyse their properties for single\nqubit and two-qubit systems in both pure-dephasing and dissipative scenarios.\nMore specifically we investigate and compare their computability, their\nphysical meaning, their Markovian to non-Markovian crossover, and their\nadditivity properties with respect to the number of qubits. The bottom-up\napproach that we pursue is aimed at identifying similarities and differences in\nthe behavior of non-Markovianity indicators in several paradigmatic open system\nmodels. This in turn allows us to infer the leading traits of the variegated\nphenomenon known as non-Markovian dynamics and, possibly, to grasp its physical\nessence.\n", "  The Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) is a transit\ninterferometer currently being built at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical\nObservatory (DRAO) in Penticton, BC, Canada. We will use CHIME to map neutral\nhydrogen in the frequency range 400 -- 800\\,MHz over half of the sky, producing\na measurement of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) at redshifts between 0.8 --\n2.5 to probe dark energy. We have deployed a pathfinder version of CHIME that\nwill yield constraints on the BAO power spectrum and provide a test-bed for our\ncalibration scheme. I will discuss the CHIME calibration requirements and\ndescribe instrumentation we are developing to meet these requirements.\n", "  In the bottom-up approach of emergent gravity we attempt to find symplectic\ngauge fields emerging from Euclidean Schwarzschild instanton, which is studied\nas electromagnetism defined on the symplectic space $(M,\\omega)$. Geometrical\nengineering with the emergent metric sets up the Seiberg Witten map between\ncommutative and non-commutative gauge fields, preparing the ground for the\nevaluation of topological invariants in terms of the underlying gauge theory\nquantities.\n", "  $W$-type entangled states can be used as quantum channels for, e.g., quantum\nteleportation, quantum dense coding, and quantum key distribution. In this\nwork, we propose a way to generate a macroscopic $W$-type entangled coherent\nstate using quantum memories in circuit QED. The memories considered here are\nnitrogen-vacancy center ensembles (NVEs), each located in a different cavity.\nThis proposal does not require initially preparing each NVE in a coherent state\ninstead of a ground state, which should significantly reduce its experimental\ndifficulty. For most of the operation time, each cavity remains in a vacuum\nstate, thus decoherence caused by the cavity decay and the unwanted\ninter-cavity crosstalk are greatly suppressed. Moreover, only one\nexternal-cavity coupler qubit is needed. This method is quite general and can\nbe applied to generate the proposed $W$ state with atomic ensembles or other\nspin ensembles distributed in different cavities.\n", "  A predicting model for soft Dielectric Elastomer Generators (DEGs) must\nconsider a realistic model of the electromechanical behaviour of the elastomer\nfilling, the variable capacitor and of the electrical circuit connecting all\nelements of the device. In this paper such an objective is achieved by\nproposing a complete framework for reliable simulations of soft energy\nharvesters. In particular, a simple electrical circuit is realised by\nconnecting the capacitor, stretched periodically by a source of mechanical\nwork, in parallel with a battery through a diode and with an electrical load\nconsuming the energy produced. The electrical model comprises resistances\nsimulating the effect of the electrodes and of the conductivity current\ninvariably present through the dielectric film. As these devices undergo a high\nnumber of electro-mechanical loading cycles at large deformation, the\ntime-dependent response of the material must be taken into account as it\nstrongly affects the generator outcome. To this end, the viscoelastic behaviour\nof the polymer and the possible change of permittivity with strains are\nanalysed carefully by means of a proposed coupled electro-viscoelastic\nconstitutive model, calibrated on experimental data available in the literature\nfor an incompressible polyacrilate elastomer (3M VHB4910). Numerical results\nshowing the importance of time-dependent behaviour on the evaluation of\nperformance of DEGs for different loading conditions, namely equi-biaxial and\nuniaxial, are reported in the final section.\n", "  An affine transport equation was used recently to study properties of angular\nmomentum and gravitational-wave memory effects in general relativity. In this\npaper, we investigate local properties of this transport equation in greater\ndetail. Associated with this transport equation is a map between the tangent\nspaces at two points on a curve. This map consists of a homogeneous (linear)\npart given by the parallel transport map along the curve plus an inhomogeneous\npart, which is related to the development of a curve in a manifold into an\naffine tangent space. For closed curves, the affine transport equation defines\na \"generalized holonomy\" that takes the form of an affine map on the tangent\nspace. We explore the local properties of this generalized holonomy by using\ncovariant bitensor methods to compute the generalized holonomy around geodesic\npolygon loops. We focus on triangles and \"parallelogramoids\" with sides formed\nfrom geodesic segments. For small loops, we recover the well-known result for\nthe leading-order linear holonomy ($\\sim$ Riemann $\\times$ area), and we derive\nthe leading-order inhomogeneous part of the generalized holonomy ($\\sim$\nRiemann $\\times$ area$^{3/2}$). Our bitensor methods let us naturally compute\nhigher-order corrections to these leading results. These corrections reveal the\nform of the finite-size effects that enter into the holonomy for larger loops;\nthey could also provide quantitative errors on the leading-order results for\nfinite loops.\n", "  We report new measurements of the total cross sections for $e^+e^-\\to\n\\Upsilon(n{\\rm S})\\pi^+\\pi^-$ ($n$ = 1, 2, 3) and $e^+e^-\\to b\\bar b$ from a\nhigh-luminosity fine scan of the region $\\sqrt{s} = 10.63$-$11.05$ GeV with the\nBelle detector. We observe that the $\\Upsilon(n{\\rm S})\\pi^+\\pi^-$ spectra have\nlittle or no non-resonant component and extract from them the masses and widths\nof $\\Upsilon(10860)$ and $\\Upsilon(11020)$ and their relative phase. We find\n$M_{10860}=(10891.1\\pm3.2^{+0.6}_{-1.7})$ MeV/$c^2$ and\n$\\Gamma_{10860}=(53.7^{+7.1}_{-5.6}\\,^{+1.3}_{-5.4})$ MeV and report first\nmeasurements $M_{11020}=(10987.5^{+6.4}_{-2.5}\\,^{+9.0}_{-2.1})$ MeV/$c^2$,\n$\\Gamma_{11020}=(61^{+9}_{-19}\\,^{+2}_{-20})$ MeV, and $\\phi_{\\rm\n11020}-\\phi_{\\rm 10860} = (-1.0\\pm0.4\\,^{+1.4}_{-0.1})$ rad.\n", "  Recently it has been recognized that the electromotive force (emf) can be\ninduced just by the spin precession where the generation of the electromotive\nforce has been considered as a real-space topological pumping effect. It has\nbeen shown that the amount of the electromotive force is independent of the\nfunctionality of the localized moments. It was also demonstrated that the rigid\ndomain wall (DW) motion cannot generate electromotive force in the system.\nBased on real-space topological pumping approach in the current study we show\nthat the electromotive force can be induced by rigid motion of a deformed DW.\nWe also demonstrate that the generated electromotive force strongly depends on\nthe DW bulging. Meanwhile results show that the DW bulging leads to generation\nof the electromotive force both along the axis of the DW motion and normal to\nthe direction of motion.\n", "  The edges of graphene and graphene like systems can host localized states\nwith evanescent wave function with properties radically different from those of\nthe Dirac electrons in bulk. This happens in a variety of situations, that are\nreviewed here. First, zigzag edges host a set of localized non dispersive state\nat the Dirac energy. At half filling, it is expected that these states are\nprone to ferromagnetic instability, causing a very interesting type of edge\nferromagnetism. Second, graphene under the influence of external perturbations\ncan host a variety of topological insulating phases, including the conventional\nQuantum Hall effect, the Quantum Anomalous Hall (QAH) and the Quantum Spin Hall\nphase, in all of which phases conduction can only take place through\ntopologically protected edge states. Here we provide an unified vision of the\nproperties of all these edge states, examined under the light of the same one\norbital tight-binding model. We consider the combined action of interactions,\nspin orbit coupling and magnetic field, which produces a wealth of different\nphysical phenomena. We briefly address what has been actually observed\nexperimentally.\n", "  The phase transition from a topological insulator to a trivial band insulator\nis studied by angle-resoled photoemission spectroscopy on\nBi$_{2-x}$In$_{x}$Se$_{3}$ single crystals. We first report the complete\nevolution of the bulk band structures throughout the transition. The robust\nsurface state and the bulk gap size ($\\sim$ 0.50 eV) show no significant change\nupon doping for $x$ = 0.05, 0.10 and 0.175. At $x$ $\\geq$ 0.225, the surface\nstate completely disappears and the bulk gap size increases, suggesting a\nsudden gap-closure and topological phase transition around $x \\sim$\n0.175$-$0.225. We discuss the underlying mechanism of the phase transition,\nproposing that it is governed by the combined effect of spin-orbit coupling and\ninteractions upon band hybridization. Our study provides a new venue to\ninvestigate the mechanism of the topological phase transition induced by\nnon-magnetic impurities.\n", "  We study the renormalization of theories of gravity with an arbitrary\n(torsionful and non-metric) connection. The class of actions we consider is of\nthe Palatini type, including the most general terms with up to two derivatives\nof the metric, but no derivatives of the connection. It contains 19 independent\nparameters. We calculate the one loop beta functions of these parameters and\nfind their fixed points. The Holst subspace is discussed in some detail and\nfound not to be stable under renormalization. Some possible implications for\nultraviolet and infrared gravity are discussed.\n", "  Transparent boundary conditions for the time-dependent Schrodinger equation\nare implemented using the R-matrix method. The employed scattering formalism is\nsuitable for describing open quantum systems and provides the framework for the\ntime-dependent coherent transport. Transmission and reflection of wave\nfunctions at the edges of a finite quantum system are essential for an accurate\nand efficient description of the time-dependent processes on large time scales.\nThe approach is used here to describe time-dependent transport across\nnanostructured interfaces relevant for photovoltaic applications.\n", "  We present a lattice study of the phase transitions at zero and nonzero\ntemperature for the $SU(3)$ gauge theory with a varying number of flavours\n$N_f$ in the fundamental representation of the gauge group. We show that all\nresults are consistent with a lower edge of the conformal window between\n$N_f=8$ and $N_f=6$. A lower edge in this interval is in remarkable agreement\nwith perturbation theory and recent large-$N$ arguments. .\n", "  A previously proposed variational approach for momentum-conserving systems\n[J. Liu et.al., Phys. Rev. E 91, 042910 (2015)] is extended to systematically\ninvestigate general momentum-nonconserving nonlinear lattices. Two intrinsic\nidentities characterizing optimal reference systems are revealed, which enables\nus to derive explicit expressions for optimal variational parameters. The\nresulting optimal harmonic reference systems provide information for the band\ngap as well as the dispersion of renormalized phonons in nonlinear lattices. As\na demonstration, we consider the one-dimensional \\phi^?4 lattice. By combining\nthe transfer integral operator method, we show that the phonon band gap endows\na simple power-law temperature dependence in the weak stochasticity regime\nwhere predicted dispersion is reliable by comparing with numerical results. In\naddition, an exact relation between ensemble averages of the \\phi^?4 lattice in\nthe whole temperature range is found, regardless of the existence of the strong\nstochasticity threshold.\n", "  We demonstrate that a Hermitian matrix model can be derived from level\ntruncated open string field theory with Chan-Paton factors. The Hermitian\nmatrix is coupled with a scalar and a $U(N)$ vector which are responsible for\nthe D-brane at the tachyon vacuum. Effective potential for the scalar is\nevaluated both in finite and large $N$. Increase of potential height is\nobserved in both examples. The large $N$ matrix integral is identified with a\nsystem of $N$ ZZ branes and a ghost FZZT brane.\n", "  The basic idea of a microscopic understanding of Thermodynamics is to derive\nits main features from a microscopic probability distribution. In such a vein,\nwe investigate the thermal statistics of quasi-probabilities's semi-classical\nanalogs in phase space for the important case of quadratic Hamiltonians,\nfocusing attention in the three more important instances, i.e., those of\nWigner, $P$-, and Husimi distributions. Introduction of an effective\ntemperature permits one to obtain a unified thermodynamic description that\nencompasses and unifies the three different quasi-probability distributions.\nThis unified description turns out to be classical.\n", "  We present a family of self-consistent, spherical, lowered isothermal models,\nconsisting of one or more mass components, with parameterised prescriptions for\nthe energy truncation and for the amount of radially biased pressure\nanisotropy. The models are particularly suited to describe the phase-space\ndensity of stars in tidally limited, mass-segregated star clusters in all\nstages of their life-cycle. The models extend a family of isotropic,\nsingle-mass models by Gomez-Leyton and Velazquez, of which the well-known\nWoolley, King and Wilson (in the non-rotating and isotropic limit) models are\nmembers. We derive analytic expressions for the density and velocity dispersion\ncomponents in terms of potential and radius, and introduce a fast model solver\nin PYTHON (LIMEPY), that can be used for data fitting or for generating\ndiscrete samples.\n", "  Tachyon inflationary universe model on the brane in the context of warm\ninflation is studied. In slow-roll approximation and in longitudinal gauge, we\nfind the primoradial perturbation spectrums for this scenario. We also present\nthe general expressions of the tensor-scalar ratio, scalar spectral index and\nits running. We develop our model by using exponential potential, the\ncharacteristics of this model are calculated in great details. We also study\nour model in the context of intermediate (where scale factor expands as:\n$a=a_0\\exp(At^f)$) and logamediate (where the scale factor expands as:\n$a=a_0\\exp(A[\\ln t]^{\\nu})$) models of inflation. In these two sectors,\ndissipative parameter is considered as a constant parameter and a function of\ntachyon field. Our model is compatible with observational data. The parameters\nof the model are restricted by recent observational data from the nine-year\nWilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (WMAP9) and Planck data.\n", "  We propose a simple dynamical model of the formation of production networks\namong monopolistically competitive firms. The model subsumes the standard\ngeneral equilibrium approach \\`a la Arrow-Debreu but displays a wide set of\npotential dynamic behaviors. It robustly reproduces key stylized facts of\nfirms' demographics. Our main result is that competition between intermediate\ngood producers generically leads to the emergence of scale-free production\nnetworks.\n", "  We consider a system composed of two identical light quarks ($qq$) and two\nidentical antiquarks ($\\bar Q\\bar Q$) that can be linked either as two mesons\nor as a tetraquark, incorporating quantum correlations between identical\nparticles and an effective many-body potential between particles. We perform a\n3-D Monte Carlo simulation of the system, considering the configurations\nallowed to form: i) Only two mesons, ii) Only tetraquark and iii) two mesons\nand tetraquark . We characterize each case and determine whether it is\nenergetically more favorable to form a tetraquark or two mesons, as a function\nof the interparticle separation distance which, for a fixed number of\nparticles, can be identified as a particle density. We determine how the two\nmesons, which dominate the low density regime, mixes with a tetraquark state as\nthe density increases. Properties like the mean square radius and the\ntwo-particle correlation function are found to reflect such transition, and we\nprovide a parameterization of the diquark correlation function in the isolated\ncase. We track the dynamical flipping among configurations to determine the\nrecombination probability, exhibiting the importance of the tetraquark state.\nWe analize the four-body potential evolution and show that its linear behavior\nis preserved, although the slope can reflect the presence of a mixed state.\nResults are shown for several light-quarks to heavy-antiquarks mass ratios\nwhenever they are found to be relevant.\n", "  Ultra high performance concretes (UHPCs) are cementitious composite materials\nwith high level of perfor- mance characterized by high compressive strength,\nhigh tensile strength and superior durability, reached by low water-to-binder\nratio, optimized aggregate size distribution, thermal activation, and fiber\nreinforcement. In the past couple of decades, more and more UHPCs have been\ndeveloped and found their ways into practice. Thus, the demand for\ncomputational models capable of describing and predicting relevant aging\nphenomena to assist design and planning is increasing. This paper presents the\nearly age experimental characterization as well as the results of subsequent\nsimulations of a typical UHPC matrix. Performed and simulated tests include\nunconfined compression, splitting (Brazilian), and three-point-bending tests.\nThe computational framework is formulated by coupling a hygro-thermo-chemical\n(HTC) theory and a comprehensive mesoscale discrete model with formulated aging\nfunctions. The HTC component allows taking into account various types of curing\nconditions with varying temperature and relative humidity and predicting the\nlevel of concrete aging. The mechanical component, the Lattice Discrete\nParticle Model (LDPM), permits the simulation of the failure behavior of\nconcrete at the length scale of major heterogeneities. The aging functions\nrelate the mesoscale LDPM mechanical properties in terms of aging degree,\ndefined in this work as the ratio between the quasi-static elastic modulus at a\ncertain age and its asymptotic value. The obtained results provide insights in\nboth UHPC early age mechanisms and a computational model for the analysis of\naging UHPC structures.\n", "  In coherent diffractive imaging (CDI) the resolution of the reconstructed\nobject is limited by the numerical aperture of the experimental setup. We\npresent here a theoretical and numerical study for achieving super-resolution\nby post-extrapolation of coherent diffraction images, such as diffraction\npatterns or holograms. We demonstrate that a diffraction pattern can\nunambiguously be extrapolated from only a fraction of the entire pattern and\nthat the ratio of the extrapolated signal to the originally available signal is\nlinearly proportional to the oversampling ratio. While there could be in\nprinciple other methods to achieve extrapolation, we devote our discussion to\nemploying iterative phase retrieval methods and demonstrate their limits. We\npresent two numerical studies; namely the extrapolation of diffraction patterns\nof non-binary and that of phase objects together with a discussion of the\noptimal extrapolation procedure.\n", "  We present in detail two variants of the lattice Monte Carlo method aimed at\ntackling systems in external trapping potentials: a uniform-lattice approach\nwith hard-wall boundary conditions, and a non-uniform Gauss-Hermite lattice\napproach. Using those two methods, we compute the ground-state energy and\nspatial density profile for systems of N=4 - 8 harmonically trapped fermions in\none dimension. From the favorable comparison of both energies and density\nprofiles (particularly in regions of low density), we conclude that the\ntrapping potential is properly resolved by the hard-wall basis. Our work paves\nthe way to higher dimensions and finite temperature analyses, as calculations\nwith the hard-wall basis can be accelerated via fast Fourier transforms, the\ncost of unaccelerated methods is otherwise prohibitive due to the unfavorable\nscaling with system size.\n", "  Practical quantum communication (QC) protocols are assumed to be secure\nprovided implemented devices are properly characterized and all known side\nchannels are closed. We show that this is not always true. We demonstrate a\nlaser-damage attack capable of modifying device behaviour on-demand. We test it\non two practical QC systems for key distribution and coin-tossing, and show\nthat newly created deviations lead to side channels. This reveals that laser\ndamage is a potential security risk to existing QC systems, and necessitates\ntheir testing to guarantee security.\n", "  We study Chebyshev filter diagonalization as a tool for the computation of\nmany interior eigenvalues of very large sparse symmetric matrices. In this\ntechnique the subspace projection onto the target space of wanted eigenvectors\nis approximated with filter polynomials obtained from Chebyshev expansions of\nwindow functions. After the discussion of the conceptual foundations of\nChebyshev filter diagonalization we analyze the impact of the choice of the\ndamping kernel, search space size, and filter polynomial degree on the\ncomputational accuracy and effort, before we describe the necessary steps\ntowards a parallel high-performance implementation. Because Chebyshev filter\ndiagonalization avoids the need for matrix inversion it can deal with matrices\nand problem sizes that are presently not accessible with rational function\nmethods based on direct or iterative linear solvers. To demonstrate the\npotential of Chebyshev filter diagonalization for large-scale problems of this\nkind we include as an example the computation of the $10^2$ innermost\neigenpairs of a topological insulator matrix with dimension $10^9$ derived from\nquantum physics applications.\n", "  Nowadays, magnetic hyperthermia constitutes a complementary approach to\ncancer treatment. The use of magnetic particles as heating mediators, proposed\nin the 1950s, provides a novel strategy for improving tumor treatment and,\nconsequently, patient quality of life. This review reports a broad overview\nabout several aspects of magnetic hyperthermia addressing new perspectives and\nthe progress on relevant features such as the ad hoc preparation of magnetic\nnanoparticles, physical modeling of magnetic heating, methods to determine the\nheat dissipation power of magnetic colloids including the development of\nexperimental apparatus and the influence of biological matrices on the heating\nefficiency.\n", "  Recent Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature and polarization\nanisotropy measurements from the Planck mission have significantly improved\nprevious constraints on the neutrino masses as well as the bounds on extended\nmodels with massless or massive sterile neutrino states. However, due to\nparameter degeneracies, additional low redshift priors are mandatory in order\nto sharpen the CMB neutrino bounds. We explore here the role of different\npriors on low redshift quantities, such as the Hubble constant, the cluster\nmass bias, and the reionization optical depth $\\tau$. Concerning current priors\non the Hubble constant and the cluster mass bias, the bounds on the neutrino\nparameters may differ appreciably depending on the choices adopted in the\nanalyses. With regard to future improvements in the priors on the reionization\noptical depth, a value of $\\tau=0.05\\pm 0.01$, motivated by astrophysical\nestimates of the reionization redshift, would lead to $\\sum m_\\nu<0.0926$~eV at\n$90\\%$~CL, when combining the full \\textit{Planck} measurements, Baryon\nAcoustic Oscillation and Planck clusters data, thereby opening the window to\nunravel the neutrino mass hierarchy with existing cosmological probes.\n", "  We discover novel topological effects in the one-dimensional Kitaev chain\nmodified by long-range Hamiltonian deformations in the hopping and pairing\nterms. This class of models display symmetry-protected topological order\nmeasured by the Berry/Zak phase of the lower band eigenvector and the winding\nnumber of the Hamiltonians. For exponentially-decaying hopping amplitudes, the\ntopological sector can be significantly augmented as the penetration length\nincreases, something experimentally achievable. For power-law decaying\nsuperconducting pairings, the massless Majorana modes at the edges get paired\ntogether into a massive non-local Dirac fermion localised at both edges of the\nchain: a new topological quasiparticle that we call topological massive Dirac\nfermion. This topological phase has fractional topological numbers as a\nconsequence of the long-range couplings. Possible applications to current\nexperimental setups and topological quantum computation are also discussed.\n", "  We show the three-dimensional electronic structure of the Kondo lattice CeIn3\nusing soft x-ray angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy in the paramagnetic\nstate. For the first time, we have directly observed the three-dimensional\ntopology of the Fermi surface of CeIn3 by photoemission. The Fermi surface has\na complicated hole pocket centred at the {\\Gamma}-Z line and an elliptical\nelectron pocket centred at the R point of the Brillouin zone. Polarization and\nphoton-energy dependent photoemission results both indicate the nearly\nlocalized nature of the 4f electrons in CeIn3, consistent with the theoretical\nprediction by means of the combination of density functional theory and\nsingle-site dynamical meanfield theory. Those results illustrate that the f\nelectrons of CeIn3, which is the parent material of CeMIn5 compounds, are\ncloser to the localized description than the layered CeMIn5 compounds.\n", "  We re-analyze the Olesen arguments on the self-similarity properties of\nfreely evolving, nonhelical magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. We find that a\nnecessary and sufficient condition for the kinetic and magnetic energy spectra\nto evolve self-similarly is that the initial velocity and magnetic field are\nnot homogeneous functions of space of different degree, to wit, the initial\nenergy spectra are not simple powers of the wavenumber with different slopes.\nIf, instead, they are homogeneous functions of the same degree, the evolution\nis self-similar, it proceeds through selective decay, and the order of\nhomogeneity fixes the exponents of the power laws according to which the\nkinetic and magnetic energies and correlation lengths evolve in time. If just\none of them is homogeneous, the evolution is self-similar and such exponents\nare completely determined by the slope of that initial spectrum which is a\npower law. The latter evolves through selective decay, while the other spectrum\nmay eventually experience an inverse transfer of energy. Finally, if the\ninitial velocity and magnetic field are not homogeneous functions, the\nevolution of the energy spectra is still self-similar but, this time, the\npower-law exponents of energies and correlation lengths depend on a single free\nparameter which cannot be determined by scaling arguments. Also in this case,\nan inverse transfer of energy may in principle take place during the evolution\nof the system.\n", "  If the dark matter particles are axions, gravity can cause them to coalesce\ninto axion stars, which are stable gravitationally bound systems of axions. In\nthe previously known solutions for axion stars, gravity and the attractive\nforce between pairs of axions are balanced by the kinetic pressure. The mass of\nthese dilute axion stars cannot exceed a critical mass, which is about\n$10^{-14} M_\\odot$ if the axion mass is $10^{-4}$~eV. We study axion stars\nusing a simple approximation to the effective potential of the nonrelativistic\neffective field theory for axions. We find a new branch of dense axion stars in\nwhich gravity is balanced by the mean-field pressure of the axion Bose-Einstein\ncondensate. The mass on this branch ranges from about $10^{-20} M_\\odot$ to\nabout $M_\\odot$. If a dilute axion star with the critical mass accretes\nadditional axions and collapses, it could produce a bosenova, leaving a dense\naxion star as the remnant.\n", "  We report on spectroscopy study of elementary magnetic excitations in an\nIsing-like antiferromagnetic chain compound SrCo$_2$V$_2$O$_8$ as a function of\ntemperature and applied transverse magnetic field up to 25 T. An optical as\nwell as an acoustic branch of confined spinons, the elementary excitations at\nzero field, are identified in the antiferromagnetic phase below the N\\'{e}el\ntemperature of 5 K and described by a one-dimensional Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation.\nThe confinement can be suppressed by an applied transverse field and a quantum\ndisordered phase is induced at 7 T. In this disordered paramagnetic phase, we\nobserve three emergent fermionic excitations with different transverse-field\ndependencies. The nature of these modes is clarified by studying spin dynamic\nstructure factor of a 1D transverse-field Heisenberg-Ising (XXZ) model using\nthe method of infinite time evolving block decimation. Our work reveals\nemergent quantum phenomena and provides a concrete system for testifying\ntheoretical predications of one-dimension quantum spin models.\n", "  A pseudopotential of $C_{60}^-$ has been constructed from ab-initio\nquantum-mechanical calculations. Since the obtained pseudopotential can be\neasily fitted by rather simple analytical approximation it can be effectively\nused both in classical and quantum molecular dynamics of fullerene-based\ncompounds.\n", "  Micro/Nano Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS/NEMS) provide the engineer with a\npowerful set of solutions to a wide variety of technical challenges. However,\nbecause they are mechanical systems, response times can be a limitation. In\nsome situations, advanced engineered drive techniques can improve response\ntimes by as much as a thousand, significantly opening up the application space\nfor MEMS/NEMS solutions.\n", "  Delivering sub-micrometer particles to an intense x-ray focus is a crucial\naspect of single-particle diffractive-imaging experiments at x-ray\nfree-electron lasers. Enabling direct visualization of sub-micrometer aerosol\nparticle streams without interfering with the operation of the particle\ninjector can greatly improve the overall efficiency of single-particle imaging\nexperiments by reducing the amount of time and sample consumed during\nmeasurements. We have developed in-situ non-destructive imaging diagnostics to\naid real-time particle injector optimization and x-ray/particle-beam alignment,\nbased on laser illumination schemes and fast imaging detectors. Our diagnostics\nare constructed to provide a non-invasive rapid feedback on injector\nperformance during measurements, and have been demonstrated during diffraction\nmeasurements at the FLASH free-electron laser.\n", "  We study topological properties of phase transition points of two\ntopologically non-trivial $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ classes (D and DIII) in one dimension\nby assigning a Berry phase defined on closed circles around the gap closing\npoints in the parameter space of momentum and a transition driving parameter.\nWhile the topological property of the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ system is generally\ncharacterized by a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant, we identify that it\nhas a correspondence to the quantized Berry phase protected by the\nparticle-hole symmetry, and then give a proper definition of Berry phase to the\nphase transition point. By applying our scheme to some specific models of class\nD and DIII, we demonstrate that the topological phase transition can be well\ncharacterized by the Berry phase of the transition point, which reflects the\nchange of Berry phases of topologically different phases across the phase\ntransition point.\n", "  With the emergence of an information society, the idea of protecting\nsensitive data is steadily gaining importance. Conventional encryption methods\nmay not be sufficient to guarantee data protection in the future. Quantum key\ndistribution (QKD) is an emerging technology that exploits fundamental physical\nproperties to guarantee perfect security in theory. However, it is not easy to\nensure in practice that the implementations of QKD systems are exactly in line\nwith the theoretical specifications. Such theory-practice deviations can open\nloopholes and compromise the security. Several of such loopholes have been\ndiscovered and investigated in the last decade. These activities have motivated\nthe proposal and implementation of appropriate countermeasures, thereby\npreventing future attacks and enhancing the practical security of QKD. This\narticle introduces the so-called field of quantum hacking by summarizing a\nvariety of attacks and their prevention mechanisms.\n", "  Undoped bilayer graphene is a two-dimensional semimetal with a low-energy\nexcitation spectrum that is parabolic in the momentum. As a result, the\nscreening of an arbitrary external charge $Ze$ is accompanied by a\nreconstruction of the ground state: valence band electrons (for $Z>0$) are\npromoted to form a space charge around the charge while the holes leave the\nphysical picture. The outcome is flat neutral object resembling the regular\natom except that for $Z \\gg 1$ it is described by a strictly linear\nThomas-Fermi theory. This theory also predicts that the bilayer's static\ndielectric constant is the same as that of a two-dimensional electron gas in\nthe long-wavelength limit.\n", "  The inverse seesaw mechanism provides an attractive approach to generate\nsmall neutrino mass, which origins from a tiny $U(1)_L$ breaking. In this\npaper, we work in the supersymmetric version of this mechanism, where the\nsinglet-like sneutrino could be an asymmetric dark matter (ADM) candidate in\nthe maximally $U(1)_{L}$ symmetric limit. However, even a tiny $\\delta m$, the\nmass splitting between sneutrino and anti-sneutrino as a result of the tiny\n$U(1)_{L}$ breaking effect, could lead to fast oscillation between sneutrino\nand anti-sneutrino and thus spoils the ADM scenario. We study the evolution of\nthis oscillation and find that a weak scale sneutrino, which tolerates a\nrelatively larger $\\delta m\\sim 10^{-5}$ eV, is strongly favored. We also\ninvestigate possible natural ways to realize that small $\\delta m$ in the\nmodel.\n", "  In this work, we calculate the branching ratios for the\n$\\eta(\\eta')\\rightarrow\\bar{\\ell}\\ell$ decays, where $\\ell = e,\\mu$. These\nprocesses have tiny rates in the standard model due to spin flip, loop, and\nelectromagnetic suppression, for what they could be sensitive to New Physics\neffects. In order to provide a reliable input for the Standard Model, we\nexploit the general analytical properties of the amplitude. For that purpose,\nwe invoke the machinery of Canterbury approximants, which provides a systematic\ndescription of the underlying hadronic physics in a data-driven fashion. Given\nthe current experimental discrepancies, we discuss in detail the role of the\nresonant region and comment on the reliability of $\\chi$PT calculations.\nFinally, we discuss the kind of new physics which we think would be relevant to\naccount for them.\n", "  HoTe$_{3}$, a member of the rare-earth tritelluride ($R$Te$_{3}$) family, and\nits Pd-intercalated compounds, Pd$_x$HoTe$_{3}$, where superconductivity (SC)\nsets in as the charge-density wave (CDW) transition is suppressed by the\nintercalation of a small amount of Pd, are investigated using angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and electrical resistivity. Two\nincommensurate CDWs with perpendicular nesting vectors are observed in\nHoTe$_{3}$ at low temperatures. With a slight Pd intercalation ($x$ = 0.01),\nthe large CDW gap decreases and the small one increases. The momentum\ndependence of the gaps along the inner Fermi surface (FS) evolves from\northorhombicity to near tetragonality, manifesting the competition between two\nCDW orders. At $x$ = 0.02, both CDW gaps decreases with the emergence of SC.\nFurther increasing the content of Pd for $x$ = 0.04 will completely suppress\nthe CDW instabilities and give rise to the maximal SC order. The evolution of\nthe electronic structures and electron-phonon couplings (EPCs) of the multiple\nCDWs upon Pd intercalation are carefully scrutinized. We discuss the interplay\nbetween multiple CDW orders, and the competition between CDW and SC in detail.\n", "  The quantification of quantum coherence has attracted a growing attention,\nand based on various physical contexts, several coherence measures have been\nput forward. An interesting question is whether these coherence measures give\nthe same ordering when they are used to quantify the coherence of quantum\nstates. In this paper, we consider the two well-known coherence measures, the\n$l_1$ norm of coherence and the relative entropy of coherence, to show that\nthere are the states for which the two measures give a different ordering. Our\nanalysis can be extended to other coherence measures, and as an illustration of\nthe extension we further consider the formation of coherence to show that the\n$l_1$ norm of coherence and the formation of coherence, as well as the relative\nentropy of coherence and the coherence of formation, do not give the same\nordering too.\n", "  While being extensively studied as an important physical process to alter\nexciton population in nanostructures at fs time scale, carrier multiplication\nhas not been considered seriously as a major mechanism for phase transition.\nReal-time time-dependent density functional theory study of Ge2Sb2Te5 reveals\nthat carrier multiplication can induce ultrafast phase transition in solid\nstate despite that the lattice remains cold. The results also unify the\nexperimental findings in other semiconductors for which the explanation remains\nto be the 30-year old phenomenological plasma annealing model.\n", "  Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) is a fundamental technique for the analysis\nof surfaces. In the present work, the interface statistics of surfaces scanned\nwith a probe tip was analyzed for both \\textit{in silico} and experimental\nsystems that \\textit{do not} belong to the prominent Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ)\nuniversality class. We show that height, local roughness and extremal height\ndistributions of scanned surfaces quantitatively agree with the KPZ class in a\nrange similar or better than recent experimental evidences of the KPZ class\nusing SPM images. The underlying mechanism behind this artificial KPZ class is\nthe finite size of the probe tip, which does not permit a full resolution of\nneither deep valleys or sloping borders of plateaus. The net result is a\nscanned profile laterally thicker and higher than the original one implying an\nexcess growth, the major characteristic of the KPZ universality class. The\nactual universality class of self-affine scanned surfaces are expected at long\ntimes when the characteristic surface lengths become much larger than those of\nthe probe tip but our finds can be of relevance to experiments where\nsufficiently long growth times cannot be easily achieved. We also propose that\nthe KPZ signatures can be also elicited in mounded surfaces with high aspect\nratio due to the interaction with the bulk of the probe tip. Strategies to\nprevent false positives of the KPZ class are discussed.\n", "  We study a coupled array of coherently driven photonic cavities, which maps\nonto a driven-dissipative XY spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ model with ferromagnetic\ncouplings in the limit of strong optical nonlinearities. Using a site-decoupled\nmean-field approximation, we identify steady state phases with canted\nantiferromagnetic order, in addition to limit cycle phases, where oscillatory\ndynamics persist indefinitely. We also identify collective bistable phases,\nwhere the system supports two steady states among spatially uniform,\nantiferromagnetic, and limit cycle phases. We compare these mean-field results\nto exact quantum trajectories simulations for finite one-dimensional arrays.\nThe exact results exhibit short-range antiferromagnetic order for parameters\nthat have significant overlap with the mean-field phase diagram. In the\nmean-field bistable regime, the exact quantum dynamics exhibits real-time\ncollective switching between macroscopically distinguishable states. We present\na clear physical picture for this dynamics, and establish a simple relationship\nbetween the switching times and properties of the quantum Liouvillian.\n", "  By using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy combined with\nfirst-principles calculations, we reveal that the topmost unit cell of ZrSnTe\ncrystal hosts two-dimensional (2D) electronic bands of topological insulator\n(TI) state, though such a TI state is defined with a curved Fermi level instead\nof a global band gap. Furthermore, we find that by modifying the dangling bonds\non the surface through hydrogenation, this 2D band structure can be manipulated\nso that the expected global energy gap is most likely to be realized. This\nfacilitates the practical applications of 2D TI in heterostructural devices and\nthose with surface decoration and coverage. Since ZrSnTe belongs to a large\nfamily of compounds having the similar crystal and band structures, our\nfindings shed light on identifying more 2D TI candidates and superconductor-TI\nheterojunctions supporting topological superconductors.\n", "  We apply the method of nonlinear steepest descent to compute the long-time\nasymptotics of the Korteweg-de Vries equation with steplike initial data\nleading to a rarefaction wave. In addition to the leading asymptotic we also\ncompute the next term in the asymptotic expansion of the rarefaction wave,\nwhich was not known before.\n", "  We develop a concept of the traveling-wave Josephson parametric amplifier\nexploiting quadratic nonlinearity of a serial array of one-junction SQUIDs\nembedded in a superconducting transmission line. The external magnetic flux\napplied to the SQUIDs makes it possible to efficiently control the shape of\ntheir current-phase relation and, hence, the balance between quadratic and\ncubic (Kerr-like) nonlinearities. This property allows us to operate in the\nfavorable three-wave-mixing mode with minimal phase mismatch, an exponential\ndependence of the power gain on number of sections $N$, a large bandwidth, a\nhigh dynamic range, and substantially separated signal ($f_s$) and pump ($f_p$)\nfrequencies obeying relation $f_s+f_i = f_p$, where $f_i$ is the idler\nfrequency. An estimation of the amplifier characteristics with typical\nexperimental parameters, a pump frequency of $12$ GHz, and $N = 300$ yields a\nflat gain of 20 dB in the bandwidth of 5.6 GHz.\n", "  Recently Han et al. have provided an analysis of the observed behavior of\n$\\rm ZnCu_{3}(OH)_6Cl_2$ Herbertsmithite based on a separation of the\ncontributions to its thermodynamic properties due to impurities from those due\nto the kagome lattice. The authors developed an impurity model to account for\nthe experimental data and claimed that it is compatible with the presence of a\nsmall spin gap in the kagome layers. We argue that the model they advocate is\nproblematic, conflicting with the intrinsic properties of $\\rm\nZnCu_{3}(OH)_6Cl_2$ as observed and explained in recent experimental and\ntheoretical investigations. We show that the existence of the gap in the kagome\nlayers is not in itself of a vital importance, for it does not govern the\nthermodynamic and transport properties of $\\rm ZnCu_3(OH)_6Cl_2$. Measurements\nof heat transport in magnetic fields could clarify the quantum-critical\nfeatures of spin-liquid physics of $\\rm ZnCu_{3}(OH)_6Cl_2$.\n", "  A numerical recipe is given for obtaining the density image of an initially\ncompact quantum mechanical wavefunction that has expanded by a large but finite\nfactor under free flight. The recipe given avoids the memory storage problems\nthat plague this type of calculation by reducing the problem to the sum of a\nnumber of fast Fourier transforms carried out on the relatively small initial\nlattice. The final expanded state is given exactly on a coarser magnified grid\nwith the same number of points as the initial state. An important application\nof this technique is the simulation of measured time-of-flight images in\nultracold atom experiments, especially when the initial clouds contain\nsuperfluid defects. It is shown that such a finite-time expansion, rather than\na far-field approximation is essential to correctly predict images of\ndefect-laden clouds, even for long flight times. Examples shown are: an\nexpanding quasicondensate with soliton defects and a matter-wave interferometer\nin 3D.\n", "  Recent studies [J. Steinhauer, Nature Phys., $\\textbf{10}$, 864 (2014); Phys.\nRev. D $\\textbf{92}$, 024043 (2015)] provide compelling evidences that Hawking\nradiation could be experimentally proven by using an analogue black hole. In\nthis paper, taking this situation into account we study the quantum\ngravitational effects on the Hawking radiation of rotating acoustic black\nholes. For this purpose, we consider the generalized uncertainty principle\n(GUP) in the phenomenon of quantum tunneling. We firstly take the modified\ncommutation relations into account to compute the GUP modified Hawking\ntemperature when the massive scalar particles tunnel from this black hole.\nThen, we find a remarkably instructive expression for the GUP entropy to derive\nthe quantum gravity corrected Hawking temperature of the rotating acoustic\nblack hole.\n", "  Cryogenic detectors have a long history of success in the field of rare event\nsearches. In particular scintillating calorimeters are very suitable detectors\nfor this task since they provide particle discrimination: the simultaneous\ndetection of the thermal and the light signal produced by a particle\ninteraction in scintillating crystals allows to identify the nature of\nparticle, as the light yield depends thereon. We investigate the performance of\ntwo large CsI (undoped) crystals ($\\sim$122 g each) operated as scintillating\ncalorimeters at milli-Kelvin temperatures in terms of calorimetric properties\nand background rejection capabilities. Furthermore, we discuss the feasibility\nof this detection approach towards a background-free future dark matter\nexperiment based on alkali halides crystals, with active particle\ndiscrimination via the two-channel detection.\n", "  We evaluate two integrals over $x\\in [0,1]$ involving products of the\nfunction $\\zeta_1(a,x)\\equiv \\zeta(a,x)-x^{-a}$ for $\\Re (a)>1$, where\n$\\zeta(a,x)$ is the Hurwitz zeta function. The evaluation of these integrals\nfor the particular case of integer $a\\geq 2$ is also presented. As an\napplication we calculate the $O(g)$ weak-coupling expansion coefficient\n$c_{1}(\\varepsilon)$ of the Casimir energy for a film with Dirichlet-Dirichlet\nboundary conditions, first stated by Symanzik [Schr\\\"odinger representation and\nCasimir effect in renormalizable quantum field theory, Nucl. Phys. B 190 (1981)\n1-44] in the framework of $g\\phi^4_{4-\\varepsilon}$ theory.\n", "  Three different tensor network optimization algorithms are employed to\naccurately determine the ground state and thermodynamic properties of the\nspin-3/2 kagome Heisenberg antiferromagnet. We found that the $\\sqrt{3} \\times\n\\sqrt{3}$ state, rather than the $q = 0$ state, is the ground state of this\nsystem, and such an ordered state is melted at any finite temperature, thereby\nclarifying the existing experimental controversies. A 1/3-magnetization plateau\nin the magnetic curve is observed, being consistent with the experimental\nobservation. The absence of a zero-magnetization plateau indicates a gapless\nspin excitation that is further supported by the thermodynamic asymptotic\nbehaviors of the susceptibility and specific heat. At low temperatures, the\nspecific heat is shown to exhibit a $\\sqrt{T}$ behavior, and the susceptibility\napproaches a finite constant as $T\\rightarrow 0$. Our TN results of\nthermodynamic properties are compared with those from high temperature series\nexpansion. In addition, we observe a quantum phase transition between $q = 0$\nand $\\sqrt{3}\\times\\sqrt{3}$ states in a spin-3/2 kagome XXZ model at the\ncritical point $\\Delta_c = 0.408$. This study provides reliable and useful\ninformation for further explorations on high spin kagome physics.\n", "  We study the interplay of topological bottlenecks and energetic barriers to\nequilibration in a Coulomb spin liquid where a short-range energetic coupling\nbetween defects charged under an emergent gauge field supplements their\nentropic long-range Coulomb interaction. This work is motivated by the\nprevalence of memory effects observed across a wide range of geometrically\nfrustrated magnetic materials, possibly including the spontaneous Hall effect\nobserved in Pr2Ir2O7. Our model is canonical spin-ice model on the pyrochlore\nlattice, where farther-neighbour spin couplings give rise to a nearest-neighbor\ninteraction between topological defects which can easily be chosen to be\nunnatural or not, i.e. attractive or repulsive between defects of equal gauge\ncharge. Among the novel features of this model are the following. After\napplying a field quench, a rich dynamical approach to equilibrium emerges,\ndominated by multi-scale energy barriers responsible for long-lived\nmagnetization plateaux. These even allow for the metastability of a\n\"fragmented\" spin liquid, an elusive regime where partial order co-exists with\na spin liquid. Perhaps most strikingly, the attraction produces clusters of\ndefects whose stability is due to a combination of energetic barriers for their\nbreak-up and proximity of opposite charges along with an entropic barrier\ngenerated by the topological requirement of annihilating a defect only together\nwith an oppositely charged counterpart. These clusters may take the form of a\n\"jellyfish\" spin texture, comprising an arrangement of same-sign gauge-charges,\ncentered on a hexagonal ring with branches of arbitrary length. The ring\ncarries a clockwise or counterclockwise circular flow of magnetisation. This\nemergent toroidal degrees of freedom provides a possibility for time reversal\nsymmetry breaking with possible relevance to the spontaneous Hall effect\nobserved in Pr2Ir2O7.\n", "  In the present work we calculate the allowed $\\beta^-$-decay half-lives of\nnuclei with $Z = 20 -30$ and N $\\leq$ 50 systematically under the framework of\nthe nuclear shell model. A recent study shows that some nuclei in this region\nbelong to the island of inversion. We perform calculation for $fp$ shell nuclei\nusing KB3G effective interaction. In the case of Ni, Cu, and Zn, we used JUN45\neffective interaction. Theoretical results of $Q$ values, half-lives,\nexcitation energies, log$ft$ values, and branching fractions are discussed and\ncompared with the experimental data. In the Ni region, we also compared our\ncalculated results with recent experimental data [Z. Y. Xu {\\it et al.},\n\\emph{Phys. Rev. Lett.} \\textbf{113}, 032505, 2014]. Present results agree with\nthe experimental data of half-lives in comparison to QRPA.\n", "  It is an oft-cited fact that no quantum code can support a set of\nfault-tolerant logical gates that is both universal and transversal. This no-go\ntheorem is generally responsible for the interest in alternative universality\nconstructions including magic state distillation. Widely overlooked, however,\nis the possibility of non-transversal, yet still fault-tolerant, gates that\nwork directly on small quantum codes. Here we demonstrate precisely the\nexistence of such gates. In particular, we show how the limits of\nnon-transversality can be overcome by performing rounds of intermediate\nerror-correction to create logical gates on stabilizer codes that use no\nancillas other than those required for syndrome measurement. Moreover, the\nlogical gates we construct, the most prominent examples being Toffoli and\ncontrolled-controlled-Z, often complete universal gate sets on their codes. We\ndetail such universal constructions for the smallest quantum codes, the 5-qubit\nand 7-qubit codes, and then proceed to generalize the approach. One remarkable\nresult of this generalization is that any nondegenerate stabilizer code with a\ncomplete set of fault-tolerant single-qubit Clifford gates has a universal set\nof fault-tolerant gates. Another is the interaction of logical qubits across\ndifferent stabilizer codes, which, for instance, implies a broadly applicable\nmethod of code switching.\n", "  In the present work we report a comprehensive analysis of shell model results\nfor high-spin states of $^{87}$Sr and $^{87}$Zr for recently available\nexperimental data within the full $f_{5/2}pg_{9/2}$ model space using JUN45 and\njj44b effective interactions developed for this model space. In this work we\nhave compared the energy levels, electromagnetic transition probabilities,\nquadrupole and magnetic moments with available experimental data. We have\nconfirmed structure of high-spin states of these two nuclei which were\ntentatively assigned in the recent experimental work. In the case of $^{87}$Sr,\nfor positive parity states up to $\\sim$ 7.5 MeV, both interactions predict very\ngood agreement with experimental data, while negative parity states are\nslightly suppressed in jj44b calculation.For the $^{87}$Zr nucleus, the jj44b\ninteraction predicts higher energies for the negative parity states beyond $J\n\\geq 27/2^{-}$. The configuration, which have one hole in $\\nu g_{9/2}$\norbital, is responsible for generating the states in $^{87}$Sr. In the case of\n$^{87}$Zr, low-lying positive parity states come with the configuration having\nthree holes in the $\\nu g_{9/2}$, while the odd-parity states have\nconfiguration $\\nu (f_{5/2}^{-1}g_{9/2}^{-2})$.\n", "  We consider the algebraic setting of classical defects in discrete and\ncontinuous integrable theories. We derive the \"equations of motion\" on the\ndefect point via the space-like and time-like description. We then exploit the\nstructural similarity of these equations with the discrete and continuous\nBacklund transformations. And although these equations are similar they are not\nexactly the same to the Backlund transformations. We also consider specific\nexamples of integrable models to demonstrate our construction, i.e. the Toda\nchain and the sine-Gordon model. The equations of the time (space) evolution of\nthe defect (discontinuity) degrees of freedom for these models are explicitly\nderived.\n", "  The two-dimensional one-component plasma is an ubiquitous model for several\nvortex systems. For special values of the coupling constant $\\beta q^2$ (where\n$q$ is the particles charge and $\\beta$ the inverse temperature), the model\nalso corresponds to the eigenvalues distribution of normal matrix models.\nSeveral features of the system are discussed in the limit of large number $N$\nof particles for generic values of the coupling constant. We show that the\nstatistics of a class of radial observables produces a rich phase diagram, and\ntheir asymptotic behaviour in terms of large deviation functions is calculated\nexplicitly, including next-to-leading terms up to order 1/N. We demonstrate a\nsplit-off phenomenon associated to atypical fluctuations of the edge density\nprofile. We also show explicitly that a failure of the fluid phase assumption\nof the plasma can break a genuine $1/N$-expansion of the free energy. Our\nfindings are corroborated by numerical comparisons with exact finite-N formulae\nvalid for $\\beta q^2=2$.\n", "  Due to local field enhancement and subwavelength confinements,\nnano-plasmonics provide numerous novel applications. Simultaneously, as an\nefficient nanoscale heat generator from inherent absorption, thermo-plasmonics\nis emerging as an important branch. However, although significant temperature\nincrease is involved in applications, detailed characterization of metal\npermittivity at different temperatures and corresponding thermo-derivative are\nlacking. In this work, we extract the permittivity of gold from 300K to the\nannealing temperature of 570K. By comparing annealed and unannealed films, more\nthan one-order difference in thermo-derivative of permittivity is revealed,\nresulting in unexpectedly large variation of plasmonic properties. Our result\nis valuable not only for characterizing extensively used unannealed\nnanoparticles, but also for designing future thermo-nano-plasmonic systems.\n", "  We construct effective field theories for gapped quantum Hall systems coupled\nto background geometries with local Galilean invariance i.e. Bargmann\nspacetimes. Along with an electromagnetic field, these backgrounds include the\neffects of curved Galilean spacetimes, including torsion and a gravitational\nfield, allowing us to study charge, energy, stress and mass currents within a\nunified framework. A shift symmetry specific to single constituent theories\nconstraints the effective action to couple to an effective background gauge\nfield and spin connection that is solved for by a self-consistent equation,\nproviding a manifestly covariant extension of Hoyos and Son's improvement terms\nto arbitrary order in $m$.\n", "  Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we investigate the Schwinger effect in a\nconfining D3-brane background with chemical potential. The potential between a\ntest particle pair on the D3-brane in an external electric field is obtained.\nThe critical field $E_c$ in this case is calculated. Also, we apply numerical\nmethod to evaluate the production rate for various cases. The results imply\nthat the presence of chemical potential tends to suppress the pair production\neffect.\n", "  Deformations in graphene systems are central elements in the novel field of\n{\\it straintronics}. Various strain geometries have been proposed to produce\nspecific properties but their experimental realization has been limited.\nBecause strained folds can be engineered on graphene samples on appropriate\nsubstrates, we study their effects on graphene transport properties. We show\nthe existence of an enhanced local density of states (LDOS) along the direction\nof the strained fold that originates from localization of higher energy states,\nand provides extra conductance channels at lower energies. In addition to\nexhibit sublattice symmetry breaking, these states are valley polarized, with\nquasi-ballistic properties in smooth disorder potentials. We confirmed that\nthese results persist in the presence of strong edge disorder, making these\ngeometries viable electronic waveguides. These findings could be tested in\nproperly engineered experimental settings.\n", "  In this short note, we report a di-quark model calculation for the spin\ndependent odderon and demonstrate that the asymmetrical color source\ndistribution in the transverse plane of a transversely polarized hadron plays\nan essential role in yielding the spin dependent odderon. This calculation\nconfirms the earlier finding that the spin dependent odderon is closely related\nto the parton orbital angular momentum.\n", "  The finite element method (FEM) is applied to obtain numerical solutions to a\nrecently derived nonlinear equation for the shallow water wave problem. A weak\nformulation and the Petrov-Galerkin method are used. It is shown that the FEM\ngives a reasonable description of the wave dynamics of soliton waves governed\nby extended KdV equations. Some new results for several cases of bottom shapes\nare presented. The numerical scheme presented here is suitable for taking into\naccount stochastic effects, which will be discussed in a subsequent paper.\n", "  Two coupled two-level systems placed under external time-dependent magnetic\nfields are modeled by a general Hamiltonian endowed with a symmetry that\nenables us to reduce the total dynamics into two independent two-dimensional\nsub-dynamics. Each of the sub-dynamics is shown to be brought into an exactly\nsolvable form by appropriately engineering the magnetic fields and thus we\nobtain an exact time evolution of the compound system. Several physically\nrelevant and interesting quantities are evaluated exactly to disclose\nintriguing phenomena in such a system.\n", "  Knowledge of the relationships among different features of quantumness, like\nentanglement and state purity, is important from both fundamental and practical\nviewpoints. Yet, this issue remains little explored in dynamical contexts for\nopen quantum systems. We address this problem by studying the dynamics of\nentanglement and purity for two-qubit systems using paradigmatic models of\nradiation-matter interaction, with a qubit being isolated from the environment\n(spectator configuration). We show the effects of the corresponding local\nquantum channels on an initial two-qubit pure entangled state in the\nconcurrence-purity diagram and find the conditions which enable dynamical\nclosed formulas of concurrence, used to quantify entanglement, as a function of\npurity. We finally discuss the usefulness of these relations in assessing\nentanglement and purity thresholds which allow noisy quantum teleportation. Our\nresults provide new insights about how different properties of composite open\nquantum systems behave and relate each other during quantum evolutions.\n", "  We investigate the thermodynamics of the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole\nin the context of the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP). The corrections\nto the Hawking temperature, entropy and the heat capacity are obtained via the\nmodified Hamilton-Jacobi equation. These modifications show that the GUP\nchanges the evolution of the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole. Specially,\nthe GUP effect becomes susceptible when the radius or mass of the black hole\napproaches the order of Planck scale, it stops radiating and leads to black\nhole remnant. Meanwhile, the Planck scale remnant can be confirmed through the\nanalysis of the heat capacity. Those phenomena imply that the GUP may give a\nway to solve the information paradox. Besides, we also investigate the\npossibilities to observe the black hole at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), and\nthe results demonstrate that the black hole cannot be produced in the recent\nLHC.\n", "  In order to understand the rate of merger of stellar-mass black hole binaries\n(BHBs) by gravitational wave (GW) emission it is important to determine the\nmajor pathways to merger. We use numerical simulations to explore the evolution\nof BHBs inside the radius of influence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in\ngalactic centers. In this region the evolution of binaries is dominated by\nperturbations from the central SMBH. In particular, as first pointed out by\nAntonini and Perets, the Kozai-Lidov (KL) mechanism trades relative inclination\nof the BHB to the SMBH for eccentricity of the BHB, and for some orientations\ncan bring the BHB to an eccentricity near unity. At very high eccentricities,\nGW emission from the BHB can become efficient, causing the members of the BHB\nto coalesce. We use a novel combination of two N-body codes to follow this\nevolution. We are forced to simulate small systems to follow the behavior\naccurately. We have completed 400 simulations that range from $\\sim$ 300 stars\naround a $10^{3}$ M$_{\\odot}$ black hole to $\\sim$ 4500 stars around a $10^{4}$\nM$_{\\odot}$ black hole. These simulations are the first to follow the internal\norbit of a binary near a SMBH while also following the changes to its external\norbit self-consistently. We find that this mechanism could produce mergers at a\nmaximum rate per volume of $\\sim 100$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ or considerably less\nif the inclination oscillations of the binary remain constant as the BHB\ninclination to the SMBH changes, or if the binary black hole fraction is small.\n", "  The remarkable rotational symmetry of the photosynthetic antenna complexes of\npurple bacteria has long been thought to enhance their light harvesting and\nexcitation energy transport. We study the role of symmetry by modeling\nhypothetical antennas whose symmetry is broken by altering the orientations of\nthe bacteriochlorophyll pigments. We find that in both LH2 and LH1 complexes,\nsymmetry increases energy transfer rates by enabling the cooperative, coherent\nprocess of supertransfer. The enhancement is particularly pronounced in the LH1\ncomplex, whose natural geometry outperforms the average randomized geometry by\n5.5 standard deviations, the most significant coherence-related enhancement\nfound in a photosynthetic complex.\n", "  The realization of single-electron sources in integer quantum Hall systems\nhas paved the way for exploring electronic quantum optics experiments in\nsolid-state devices. In this work, we characterize a single Kramers pair\nemitter realized by a driven antidot embedded in a two-dimensional topological\ninsulator, where spin-momentum locked edge states can be exploited for\ngenerating entanglement. Contrary to previous proposals, the antidot is coupled\nto both edges of a quantum spin Hall bar, thus enabling this mesoscopic\ncapacitor to emit an entangled two-electron state. We study the concurrence\n$\\mathcal{C}$ of the emitted state and the efficiency $\\mathcal{F}$ of its\nemission as a function of the different spin-preserving and spin-flipping\ntunnel couplings of the antidot with the edges. We show that the efficiency\nremains very high ($\\mathcal{F}\\geq 50\\%$) even for maximally entangled states\n($\\mathcal{C}=1$). We also discuss how the entanglement can be probed by means\nof noise measurements and violation of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt\ninequality.\n", "  In a recent paper [Nuc. Phys. A {\\bf 948}, (2016) 19] we have demonstrated\nthe possible existence of Tsallis' q-Gamow states. Now, accelerators'\nexperimental evidence for Tsallis' distributions has been ascertained only at\nvery high energies. Here, instead, we develop a different set of q-Gamow states\nfor which the associated q-Breit-Wigner distribution could easily be found at\nintermediate energies, for which accelerators are available at many locations.\nIn this context, it should be strongly emphasized [Physica A {\\bf 388} (2009)\n601] that, empirically, one never exactly and unambiguously \"detects\" pure\nGaussians, but rather q-Gaussians. A prediction is made via Eq.(3.30)\n", "  We extend firstly the regular phantom black hole solution to a slowly\nrotating black hole case and find that the phantom field depresses the angular\nvelocity of the event horizon and suppresses the super-radiation of black hole.\nWe also probe the dependence of quasi-periodic oscillations frequencies in\nrelativistic precession model on the phantom parameter. With the observation\ndata of GRO J1655-40, we make a constraint on the parameters of the regular and\nslowly rotating phantom black hole. Our results show that although the best-fit\nvalue of the phantom parameter $b$ is small, the allowed value of $b$ in the\n$1\\sigma$ region is $b<0.619$, which means that the phantom theoretical model\ncan not be excluded by the constraint from quasi-periodic oscillations with the\nobservation data of GRO J1655-40.\n", "  By combining angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and quantum\noscillation measurements, we performed a comprehensive investigation on the\nelectronic structure of LaSb, which exhibits near-quadratic extremely large\nmagnetoresistance (XMR) without any sign of saturation at magnetic fields as\nhigh as 40 T. We clearly resolve one spherical and one intersecting-ellipsoidal\nhole Fermi surfaces (FSs) at the Brillouin zone (BZ) center $\\Gamma$ and one\nellipsoidal electron FS at the BZ boundary $X$. The hole and electron carriers\ncalculated from the enclosed FS volumes are perfectly compensated, and the\ncarrier compensation is unaffected by temperature. We further reveal that LaSb\nis topologically trivial but share many similarities with the Weyl semimetal\nTaAs family in the bulk electronic structure. Based on these results, we have\nexamined the mechanisms that have been proposed so far to explain the\nnear-quadratic XMR in semimetals.\n", "  Enhancing optical nonlinearities so that they become appreciable on the\nsingle photon level and lead to nonclassical light fields has been a central\nobjective in quantum optics for many years. After this has been achieved in\nindividual micro-cavities representing an effectively zero-dimensional volume,\nthis line of research has shifted its focus towards engineering devices where\nsuch strong optical nonlinearities simultaneously occur in extended volumes of\nmultiple nodes of a network. Recent technological progress in several\nexperimental platforms now opens the possibility to employ the systems of\nstrongly interacting photons these give rise to as quantum simulators. Here we\nreview the recent development and current status of this research direction for\ntheory and experiment. Addressing both, optical photons interacting with atoms\nand microwave photons in networks of superconducting circuits, we focus on\nanalogue quantum simulations in scenarios where effective photon-photon\ninteractions exceed dissipative processes in the considered platforms.\n", "  We numerically solve the magnetic induction equation in a spherical shell\ngeometry, with a kinematically prescribed axisymmetric flow that consists of a\nsuperposition of a small-scale helical flow and a large-scale shear flow. The\nsmall-scale flow is chosen to be a local analog of the classical Roberts cells,\nconsisting of strongly helical vortex rolls. The large-scale flow is a shearing\nmotion in either the radial or the latitudinal directions. In the absence of\nlarge-scale shear, the small-scale flow is an efficient dynamo, in agreement\nwith previous results. Adding increasingly large shear flows strongly\nsuppresses the dynamo efficiency, indicating that shear is not always a\nfavourable ingredient in dynamo action.\n", "  We describe the design and characterization of superconducting coplanar\nwaveguide cavities tailored to facilitate strong coupling between\nsuperconducting quantum circuits and single trapped Rydberg atoms. For initial\nsuperconductor-atom experiments at 4.2 K, we show that resonator quality\nfactors above $10^4$ can be readily achieved. Furthermore, we demonstrate that\nthe incorporation of thick-film copper electrodes at a voltage antinode of the\nresonator provides a route to enhance the zero-point electric fields of the\nresonator in a trapping region that is 40 $\\mu$m above the chip surface,\nthereby minimizing chip heating from scattered trap light. The combination of\nhigh resonator quality factor and strong electric dipole coupling between the\nresonator and the atom should make it possible to achieve the strong coupling\nlimit of cavity quantum electrodynamics with this system.\n", "  A search is presented for the Higgs boson off-shell production in gluon\nfusion and vector boson fusion processes with the Higgs boson decaying into a\nW+W- pair and the W bosons decaying leptonically. The data observed in this\nanalysis are used to constrain the Higgs boson total decay width. The analysis\nis based on the data collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC, corresponding\nto integrated luminosities of 4.9 inverse femtobarns at a centre-of-mass energy\nof 7 TeV and 19.4 inverse femtobarns at 8 TeV, respectively. An observed\n(expected) upper limit on the off-shell Higgs boson event yield normalised to\nthe standard model prediction of 2.4 (6.2) is obtained at the 95% CL for the\ngluon fusion process and of 19.3 (34.4) for the vector boson fusion process.\nObserved and expected limits on the total width of 26 and 66 MeV are found,\nrespectively, at the 95% confidence level (CL). These limits are combined with\nthe previous result in the ZZ channel leading to observed and expected 95% CL\nupper limits on the width of 13 and 26 MeV, respectively.\n", "  We study the critical dynamics of matter waves at the 3D Anderson mobility\nedge in cold-atom disorder quench experiments. General scaling arguments are\nsupported by precision numerics for the spectral function, diffusion\ncoefficient, and localization length in isotropic blue-detuned speckle\npotentials. We discuss signatures of critical slowdown in the time-dependent\ncentral column density of a spreading wave packet, and evaluate the prospects\nof observing anomalous diffusion right at criticality.\n", "  We derive accretion flow properties of the transient black hole candidate\n(BHC) MAXI~J1543-564 using the RXTE data. We use Two-Component Advective Flow\n(TCAF) solution to fit the data of the very initial rising phase of outburst\n(from 2011 May 10 to 2011 May 15). $2.5-25$~keV spectra are fitted using the\nTCAF solution {\\it fits} file as a local additive table model in XSPEC. We\nextract physical flow parameters such as the two component (Keplerian disk and\nsub-Keplerian halo) accretion rates and size and the property of the Compton\ncloud (post shock region close to a black hole). Similar to other classical\ntransient BHCs, monotonic evolution of low frequency quasi-periodic\noscillations (QPOs) are observed during the rising phase of the outburst, which\nis fitted with the propagating oscillatory shock (POS) model which describes\nhow the Compton cloud properties change from day to day. From the nature of\nvariations of TCAF model fitted physical flow parameters and QPOs, we only\nfound hard-intermediate and soft-intermediate spectral states during this phase\nof the outburst under study. We also calculate frequency of the dominating QPOs\nfrom the TCAF model fitted shock parameters, and found that they roughly match\nwith the observed and POS model fitted values. From our spectro-temporal study\nof the source with TCAF and POS models, the most probable mass of the BHC is\nfound to be $12.6-14.0$~$M_\\odot$, or $13^{+1.0}_{-0.4}~M_\\odot$.\n", "  Van der Waals assembly of two-dimensional (2D) crystals continue attract\nintense interest due to the prospect of designing novel materials with\non-demand properties. One of the unique features of this technology is the\npossibility of trapping molecules or compounds between 2D crystals. The trapped\nmolecules are predicted to experience pressures as high as 1 GPa. Here we\nreport measurements of this interfacial pressure by capturing\npressure-sensitive molecules and studying their structural and conformational\nchanges. Pressures of 1.2 +/- 0.3 GPa are found using Raman spectrometry for\nmolecular layers of one nanometer in thickness. We further show that this\npressure can induce chemical reactions and several trapped salts or compounds\nare found to react with water at room temperature, leading to 2D crystals of\nthe corresponding oxides. This pressure and its effect should be taken into\naccount in studies of van der Waals heterostructures and can also be exploited\nto modify materials confined at the atomic interfaces.\n", "  We study the existence of hairy black holes in the generalized\nEinstein-Skyrme model. It is proven that in the BPS model limit there are no\nhairy black hole solutions, although the model admits gravitating (and flat\nspace) solitons. Furthermore, we find strong evidence that a necessary\ncondition for the existence of black holes with Skyrmionic hair is the\ninclusion of the Skyrme term $\\mathcal{L}_4$. As an example, we show that there\nare no hairy black holes in the $\\mathcal{L}_2+\\mathcal{L}_6+\\mathcal{L}_0$\nmodel and present a new kind of black hole solutions with compact Skyrmion hair\nin the $\\mathcal{L}_4+\\mathcal{L}_6+\\mathcal{L}_0$ model.\n", "  We summarize previous results on the most general Proca theory in 4\ndimensions containing only first-order derivatives in the vector field\n(second-order at most in the associated St\\\"uckelberg scalar) and having only\nthree propagating degrees of freedom with dynamics controlled by second-order\nequations of motion. Discussing the Hessian condition used in previous works,\nwe conjecture that, as in the scalar galileon case, the most complete action\ncontains only a finite number of terms with second-order derivatives of the\nSt\\\"uckelberg field describing the longitudinal mode, which is in agreement\nwith the results of JCAP 1405, 015 (2014) and Phys. Lett. B 757, 405 (2016) and\ncomplements those of JCAP 1602, 004 (2016). We also correct and complete the\nparity violating sector, obtaining an extra term on top of the arbitrary\nfunction of the field $A_\\mu$, the Faraday tensor $F_{\\mu \\nu}$ and its Hodge\ndual $\\tilde{F}_{\\mu \\nu}$.\n", "  We investigate the weak lensing corrections to the cosmic microwave\nbackground temperature anisotropies considering effects beyond the Born\napproximation. To this aim, we use the small deflection angle approximation, to\nconnect the lensed and unlensed power spectra, via expressions for the\ndeflection angles up to third order in the gravitational potential. While the\nsmall deflection angle approximation has the drawback to be reliable only for\nmultipoles $\\ell\\lesssim 2500$, it allows us to consistently take into account\nthe non-Gaussian nature of cosmological perturbation theory beyond the linear\nlevel. The contribution to the lensed temperature power spectrum coming from\nthe non-Gaussian nature of the deflection angle at higher order is a new effect\nwhich has not been taken into account in the literature so far. It turns out to\nbe the leading contribution among the post-Born lensing corrections. On the\nother hand, the effect is smaller than corrections coming from non-linearities\nin the matter power spectrum, and its imprint on CMB lensing is too small to be\nseen in present experiments.\n", "  Large-angle fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background temperature\ninduced by the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect and Compton-y distortions from the\nthermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) effect are both due to line-of-sight density\nperturbations. Here we calculate the cross-correlation between these two\nsignals. Measurement of this cross-correlation can be used to test the redshift\ndistribution of the tSZ distortion, which has implications for the redshift at\nwhich astrophysical processes in clusters begin to operate. We also evaluate\nthe detectability of a yT cross-correlation from exotic early-Universe sources\nin the presence of this late-time effect.\n", "  The hadroproduction of the radially excited heavy-quarkonium states\n$\\psi(2S)$ and $\\Upsilon(3S)$ at high energies is studied in the parton\nreggeization approach and the factorization formalism of nonrelativistic QCD at\nlowest order in the strong-coupling constant $\\alpha_s$ and the relative\nheavy-quark velocity $v$. A satisfactory description of the $\\psi(2S)$\ntransverse-momentum ($p_T$) distributions measured by ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb at\ncenter-of-mass energy $\\sqrt{S}=7$ TeV is obtained using the color-octet\nlong-distance matrix elements (LDMEs) extracted from CDF data at\n$\\sqrt{S}=1.96$ TeV. The importance of the fragmentation mechanism and the\nscale evolution of the fragmentation functions in the upper $p_T$ range, beyond\n30 GeV, is demonstrated. The $\\Upsilon(3S)$ $p_T$ distributions measured by CDF\nat $\\sqrt{S}=1.8$ TeV and by LHCb at $\\sqrt{S}=7$ TeV and forward rapidities\nare well described using LDMEs fitted to ATLAS data at $\\sqrt{S}=7$ TeV.\nComparisons of polarization measurements by CDF and CMS at large $p_T$ values\nwith our predictions consolidate the familiar problem in the $\\psi(2S)$ case,\nbut yield reasonable agreement in the $\\Upsilon(3S)$ case.\n", "  A simulation study of the energy released by extensive air showers in the\nform of MHz radiation is performed using the CoREAS simulation code. We develop\nan efficient method to extract this radiation energy from air-shower\nsimulations. We determine the longitudinal profile of the radiation energy\nrelease and compare it to the longitudinal profile of the energy deposit by the\nelectromagnetic component of the air shower. We find that the radiation energy\ncorrected for the geometric dependence of the geomagnetic emission scales\nquadratically with the energy in the electromagnetic component of the air\nshower with a second-order dependence on the atmospheric density at the\nposition of the maximum shower development $X_\\mathrm{max}$. In a measurement\nwhere $X_\\mathrm{max}$ is not accessible, this second order dependence can be\napproximated using the zenith angle of the incoming direction of the air shower\nwith only a minor loss in accuracy. Our method results in an intrinsic\nuncertainty of 4% in the determination of the energy in the electromagnetic\nair-shower component, which is well below current experimental uncertainties.\n", "  As a part of the effort to investigate the implications of dark matter\n(DM)-nucleon effective interactions on the solar DM detection, in this paper we\nfocus on the evaporation of the solar DM for a set of the DM-nucleon\nspin-independent (SI) effective operators. In order to put the evaluation of\nthe evaporation rate on a more reliable ground, we calculate the non-thermal\ndistribution of the solar DM using the Monte Carlo methods, rather than\nadopting the Maxwellian approximation. We then specify relevant signal\nparameter spaces for the solar DM detection for various SI effective operators.\nBased on the analysis, we determine the minimum DM masses for which the\nDM-nucleon coupling strengths can be probed from the solar neutrino\nobservations. As an interesting application, our investigation also shows that\nevaporation effect can not be neglectd in a recent proposal aiming to solve the\nsolar abundance problem by invoking the momentum-dependent asymmetric DM in the\nSun.\n", "  In this work, we present our recent results on a new and alternative\ndata-driven determination for the hadronic light-by-light pseudoscalar-pole\ncontribution to the muon $(g-2)$. Our approach is based on Canterbury\napproximants, a rational approach to describe the required transition form\nfactors, which provides a systematic and model-independent framework beyond\ntraditional large-$N_c$ approaches. As a result, we obtain a competitive\ndetermination with errors according to future $(g-2)$ experiments including,\nfor the first time, a well-defined systematic uncertainty.\n", "  We study the loosely bound Skyrme model with the addition of two different\npion mass terms; this is the most general potential of polynomial form up to\nsecond order in the trace of the Skyrme field. The two pion mass terms are\ncalled the standard pion mass term and the modified pion mass term. We find\nthat the binding energies are not reduced by the introduction of the modified\npion mass, but it is analogous to the standard pion mass term with a decrease\nin the value of the mass parameter of the loosely bound potential (for large\nvalues of the latter parameter). We find by increasing the overall pion mass\nthat we can reduce the classical binding energy of the 4-Skyrmion to the 2.7%\nlevel and the total binding energy including the contribution from spin/isospin\nquantization is reduced to the 5.8% level.\n", "  Since the volume accessible to galaxy surveys is fundamentally limited, it is\nextremely important to analyse available data in the most optimal fashion. One\nway of enhancing the cosmological information extracted from the clustering of\ngalaxies is by weighting the galaxy field. The most widely used weighting\nschemes assign weights to galaxies based on the average local density in the\nregion (FKP weights) and their bias with respect to the dark matter field (PVP\nweights). They are designed to minimize the fractional variance of the galaxy\npower-spectrum. We demonstrate that the currently used bias dependent weighting\nscheme can be further optimized for specific cosmological parameters. We\ndevelop a procedure for computing the optimal weights and test them against\nmock catalogues for which the values of all fitting parameters, as well as the\ninput power-spectrum are known. We show that by applying these weights to the\njoint power-spectrum of Emission Line Galaxies and Luminous Red Galaxies from\nthe Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument survey, the variance in the measured\ngrowth rate parameter can be reduced by as much as 36 per cent.\n", "  Real systems are usually composed by units or nodes whose activity can be\ninterrupted and restored intermittently due to complex interactions not only\nwith the environment, but also with the same system. Majdand\\v{z}i\\'c $et\\;al.$\n[Nature Physics 10, 34 (2014)] proposed a model to study systems in which\nactive nodes fail and recover spontaneously in a complex network and found that\nin the steady state the density of active nodes can exhibit an abrupt\ntransition and hysteresis depending on the values of the parameters. Here we\ninvestigate a model of recovery-failure from a dynamical point of view. Using\nan effective degree approach we find that the systems can exhibit a temporal\nsharp decrease in the fraction of active nodes. Moreover we show that,\ndepending on the values of the parameters, the fraction of active nodes has an\noscillatory regime which we explain as a competition between different failure\nprocesses. We also find that in the non-oscillatory regime, the critical\nfraction of active nodes presents a discontinuous drop which can be related to\na \"targeted\" k-core percolation process. Finally, using mean field equations we\nanalyze the space of parameters at which hysteresis and oscillatory regimes can\nbe found.\n", "  Novel braneworld scenarios supported by warp factors driven by a single extra\ndimension are obtained from deformed one-dimensional lump-like solutions known\n{\\em a priori}. Through a novel {\\em ansatz}, the internal energy structure,\nthe braneworld warp factor, and the quantum mechanical analogue problem, as\nwell as the associated zero mode solutions, are straightforwardly derived by\nmeans of an analytical procedure. The results allow one to identify thick brane\nsolutions that support internal structures and that can hold the\n($3+1$)-dimensional gravity.\n", "  We present 3D models of biconical outflows combined with a thin dust plane\nfor investigating the physical properties of the ionized gas outflows and their\neffect on the observed gas kinematics in type 2 active galactic nuclei (AGNs).\nUsing a set of input parameters, we construct a number of models in 3D and\ncalculate the spatially integrated velocity and velocity dispersion for each\nmodel. We find that three primary parameters, i.e., intrinsic velocity, bicone\ninclination, and the amount of dust extinction, mainly determine the simulated\nvelocity and velocity dispersion. Velocity dispersion increases as the\nintrinsic velocity or the bicone inclination increases, while velocity (i.e.,\nvelocity shifts with respect to systemic velocity) increases as the amount of\ndust extinction increases. Simulated emission-line profiles well reproduce the\nobserved [O III] line profiles, e.g., a narrow core and a broad wing\ncomponents. By comparing model grids and Monte Carlo simulations with the\nobserved [O III] velocity-velocity dispersion (VVD) distribution of ~39,000\ntype 2 AGNs, we constrain the intrinsic velocity of gas outflows ranging from\n~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s for the majority of AGNs, and up to ~1500-2000 km/s for\nextreme cases. The Monte Carlo simulations show that the number ratio of AGNs\nwith negative [O III] velocity to AGNs with positive [O III] velocity\ncorrelates with the outflow opening angle, suggesting that outflows with higher\nintrinsic velocity tend to have wider opening angles. These results demonstrate\nthe potential of our 3D models for studying the physical properties of gas\noutflows, applicable to various observations, including spatially integrated\nand resolved gas kinematics.\n", "  Massive galaxies at high redshift are predicted to be fed from the cosmic web\nby narrow, dense, cold streams. These streams penetrate supersonically through\nthe hot medium encompassed by a stable shock near the virial radius of the\ndark-matter halo. Our long-term goal is to explore the heating and dissipation\nrate of the streams and their fragmentation and possible breakup, in order to\nunderstand how galaxies are fed, and how this affects their star-formation rate\nand morphology. We present here the first step, where we analyze the linear\nKelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) of a cold, dense slab or cylinder flowing\nthrough a hot, dilute medium in the transonic regime. The current analysis is\nlimited to the adiabatic case with no gravity and assuming equal pressure in\nthe stream and the medium. By analytically solving the linear dispersion\nrelation, we find a transition from a dominance of the familiar rapidly growing\nsurface modes in the subsonic regime to more slowly growing body modes in the\nsupersonic regime. The system is parameterized by three parameters: the density\ncontrast between the stream and the medium, the Mach number of stream velocity\nwith respect to the medium, and the stream width with respect to the halo\nvirial radius. We find that a realistic choice for these parameters places the\nstreams near the mode transition, with the KHI exponential-growth time in the\nrange 0.01-10 virial crossing times for a perturbation wavelength comparable to\nthe stream width. We confirm our analytic predictions with idealized\nhydrodynamical simulations. Our linear-KHI estimates thus indicate that KHI may\nin principle be effective in the evolution of streams by the time they reach\nthe galaxy. More definite conclusions await the extension of the analysis to\nthe nonlinear regime and the inclusion of cooling, thermal conduction, the halo\npotential well, self-gravity and magnetic fields.\n", "  With new observational facilities becoming available soon, discovering and\ncharacterising supernovae from the first stars will open up alternative\nobservational windows to the end of the cosmic dark ages. Based on a\nsemi-analytical merger tree model of early star formation we constrain\nPopulation III supernova rates. We find that our method reproduces the\nPopulation III supernova rates of large-scale cosmological simulations very\nwell. Our computationally efficient model allows us to survey a large parameter\nspace and to explore a wide range of different scenarios for Population III\nstar formation. Our calculations show that observations of the first supernovae\ncan be used to differentiate between cold and warm dark matter models and to\nconstrain the corresponding particle mass of the latter. Our predictions can\nalso be used to optimize survey strategies with the goal to maximize supernova\ndetection rates.\n", "  We show that, in $U(1)_R$-symmetric supersymmetric models, the bino and its\nDirac partner (the singlino) can play the role of right-handed neutrinos and\ngenerate the neutrino masses and mixing, without the need for traditional\nbilinear or trilinear R-parity violating operators. The two particles form a\npseudo-Dirac pair, the `bi$\\nu$o'. An Inverse Seesaw texture is generated for\nthe neutrino-bi$\\nu$o sector, and the lightest neutrino is predicted to be\nmassless. Unlike in most models with heavy right-handed neutrinos, the bi$\\nu$o\ncan be sizably produced at the LHC through its interactions with colored\nparticles, while respecting low energy constraints from neutrinoless\ndouble-beta decay and charged lepton flavor violation.\n", "  The target-mass number dependence of nucleon-nucleon pairs with short-range\ncorrelations is explored in a physically transparent geometrical model within a\nzero-range approximation. The observed $A$ dependence of 2-nucleon ejection\ncross sections in $(e,e')$ reactions is found to reflect the mass dependence of\nnuclear density distributions. A parametrization of this $A$ dependence is\ngiven. The $A$ dependence of proton-proton vs.\\ proton-neutron pairs relative\nto $^{12}$C is also analyzed in this model. It can be understood using simple\ncombinatorics without any additional isospin dependence.\n", "  This paper presents a stability analysis of simple neuromodules displaying\nfold bifurcations (leading to hysteresis), flip bifurcations (period doubling\nand undoubling to and from chaos) and Neimark-Sacker bifurcations\n(quasiperiodic and periodic bifurcations). For the first time, bifurcation\ndiagrams are plotted using a feedback mechanism. It is shown that the stability\ncurves and bifurcation diagrams must be dealt with simultaneously in order to\nfully understand the dynamics of the systems involved. Synaptic weights, biases\nand gradients of transfer functions are varied and the system is shown to be\nhistory dependent. The work can be applied to artificial neural networks and\ndeveloping brains and gives a very important generalization of previous work in\nthis field.\n", "  We report on vertically-illuminated photodiodes fabricated in the\nGlobalFoundries 45nm 12SOI node and on a packaging concept for\noptically-interconnected chips. The photodiodes are responsive at 1180 nm, a\nwavelength currently used in chip-to-chip communications. They have further a\nwide field-of-view which enables chip-to-board positional feedback in\nchip-board assemblies. Monolithic integration enables on-chip processing of the\npositional data.\n", "  In this work, we use a dynamical system approach to analyse the viability of\n$f(R,\\mathcal{L})$ candidates for dark energy. We compare these with nonminimal\ncoupled $f(R)$ theories and study the solutions for exponential and power-law\nforms in order to constraint the allowed range of model parameters.\n", "  Measurements are reported of the normalized differential cross sections for\ntop quark pair production with respect to four kinematic event variables: the\nmissing transverse energy; the scalar sum of the jet transverse momentum (pT);\nthe scalar sum of the pT of all objects in the event; and the pT of\nleptonically decaying W bosons from top quark decays. The data sample,\ncollected using the CMS detector at the LHC, consists of 5.0 inverse femtobarns\nof proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV and 19.7 inverse femtobarns at\nsqrt(s) = 8 TeV. Top quark pair events containing one electron or muon are\nselected. The results are presented after correcting for detector effects to\nallow direct comparison with theoretical predictions. No significant deviations\nfrom the predictions of several standard model event simulation generators are\nobserved.\n", "  The Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) Pathfinder radio\ntelescope is currently surveying the northern hemisphere between 400 and 800\nMHz. By mapping the large scale structure of neutral hydrogen through its\nredshifted 21 cm line emission between $z \\sim 0.8-2.5$ CHIME will contribute\nto our understanding of Dark Energy. Bright astrophysical foregrounds must be\nseparated from the neutral hydrogen signal, a task which requires precise\ncharacterization of the polarized telescope beams. Using the DRAO John A. Galt\n26 m telescope, we have developed a holography instrument and technique for\nmapping the CHIME Pathfinder beams. We report the status of the instrument and\ninitial results of this effort.\n", "  We examine three versions of non-relativistic electrodynamics, known as the\nelectric and magnetic limit theories of Maxwell's equations and Galilean\nelectrodynamics (GED) which is the off-shell non-relativistic limit of Maxwell\nplus a free scalar field. For each of these three cases we study the couplings\nto non-relativistic dynamical charged matter (point particles and charged\ncomplex scalars). The GED theory contains besides the electric and magnetic\npotentials a so-called mass potential making the mass parameter a local\nfunction. The electric and magnetic limit theories can be coupled to twistless\ntorsional Newton-Cartan geometry while GED can be coupled to an arbitrary\ntorsional Newton-Cartan background. The global symmetries of the electric and\nmagnetic limit theories on flat space consist in any dimension of the infinite\ndimensional Galilean conformal algebra and a $U(1)$ current algebra. For the\non-shell GED theory this symmetry is reduced but still infinite dimensional,\nwhile off-shell only the Galilei algebra plus two dilatations remain. Hence one\ncan scale time and space independently, allowing Lifshitz scale symmetries for\nany value of the critical exponent $z$.\n", "  We analyze the spectrum of the exactly duality and gauge invariant\nhigher-derivative double field theory. While this theory is based on a chiral\nCFT and does not correspond to a standard string theory, our analysis\nilluminates a number of issues central in string theory. The full quadratic\naction is rewritten as a two-derivative theory with additional fields. This\nallows for a simple analysis of the spectrum, which contains two massive spin-2\nghosts and massive scalars, in addition to the massless fields. Moreover, in\nthis formulation, the massless or tensionless limit $\\alpha'\\rightarrow \\infty$\nis non-singular and leads to an enhanced gauge symmetry. We show that the\nmassive modes can be integrated out exactly at the quadratic level, leading to\nan infinite series of higher-derivative corrections. Finally, we present a\nghost-free massive extension of linearized double field theory, which employs a\nnovel mass term for the dilaton and metric.\n", "  The Hydrogen Intensity and Real-time Analysis eXperiment (HIRAX) is a new\n400-800MHz radio interferometer under development for deployment in South\nAfrica. HIRAX will comprise 1024 six meter parabolic dishes on a compact grid\nand will map most of the southern sky over the course of four years. HIRAX has\ntwo primary science goals: to constrain Dark Energy and measure structure at\nhigh redshift, and to study radio transients and pulsars. HIRAX will observe\nunresolved sources of neutral hydrogen via their redshifted 21-cm emission line\n(`hydrogen intensity mapping'). The resulting maps of large-scale structure at\nredshifts 0.8-2.5 will be used to measure Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO).\nHIRAX will improve upon current BAO measurements from galaxy surveys by\nobserving a larger cosmological volume (larger in both survey area and redshift\nrange) and by measuring BAO at higher redshift when the expansion of the\nuniverse transitioned to Dark Energy domination. HIRAX will complement CHIME, a\nhydrogen intensity mapping experiment in the Northern Hemisphere, by completing\nthe sky coverage in the same redshift range. HIRAX's location in the Southern\nHemisphere also allows a variety of cross-correlation measurements with\nlarge-scale structure surveys at many wavelengths. Daily maps of a few thousand\nsquare degrees of the Southern Hemisphere, encompassing much of the Milky Way\ngalaxy, will also open new opportunities for discovering and monitoring radio\ntransients. The HIRAX correlator will have the ability to rapidly and\neXperimentciently detect transient events. This new data will shed light on the\npoorly understood nature of fast radio bursts (FRBs), enable pulsar monitoring\nto enhance long-wavelength gravitational wave searches, and provide a rich data\nset for new radio transient phenomena searches. This paper discusses the HIRAX\ninstrument, science goals, and current status.\n", "  We present a systematic comparison of the results from our non-equilibrium\nGreen's function formalism with a large number of AlGaAs-GaAs terahertz quantum\ncascade lasers previously published in the literature. Employing identical\nmaterial and simulation parameters for all samples, we observe that\ndiscrepancies between measured and calculated peak currents are similar for\nsamples from a given group. This suggests that the differences between\nexperiment and theory are partly due to a lacking reproducibility for devices\nfabricated at different laboratories. Varying the interface roughness height\nfor different devices, we find that the peak current under lasing operation\nhardly changes, so that differences in interface quality appear not to be the\nsole reason for the lacking reproducibility.\n", "  A new family of inflationary models is introduced and analysed. The behaviour\nof the parameters characterising the models suggest preferred values, which\ngenerate the most interesting testable predictions. Results are further\nimproved if late reheating and/or a subsequent period of thermal inflation is\ntaken into account. Specific model realisations consider a sub-Planckian\ninflaton variation or a potential without fine-tuning of mass scales, based on\nthe Planck and grand unified theory scales. A toy model realisation in the\ncontext of global and local supersymmetry is examined and results fitting the\nPlanck observations are determined.\n", "  (Short abstract). In Galilean physics, the universality of free fall implies\nan inertial frame, which in turns implies that the mass m of the falling body\nis omitted. Otherwise, an additional acceleration proportional to m/M would\nrise either for an observer at the centre of mass of the system, or for an\nobserver at a fixed distance from the centre of mass of M. These elementary,\nbut overlooked, considerations fully respect the equivalence principle and the\nidentity of an inertial or a gravitational pull for an observer in the Einstein\ncabin. They value as fore-runners of the self-force and gauge dependency in\ngeneral relativity. The approximate nature of Galilei's law of free fall is\nexplored herein. When stepping into general relativity, we report how the\ngeodesic free fall into a black hole was the subject of an intense debate again\ncentred on coordinate choice. Later, we describe how the infalling mass and the\nemitted gravitational radiation affect the free fall motion of a body. The\ngeneral relativistic self-force might be dealt with to perfectly fit into a\ngeodesic conception of motion. Then, embracing quantum mechanics, real black\nholes are not classical static objects any longer. Free fall has to handle the\nHawking radiation, and leads us to new perspectives on the varying mass of the\nevaporating black hole and on the varying energy of the falling mass. Along the\npaper, we also estimate our findings for ordinary masses being dropped from a\nGalilean or Einsteinian Pisa-like tower with respect to the current state of\nthe art drawn from precise measurements in ground and space laboratories, and\nto the constraints posed by quantum measurements. The appendix describes how\neducation physics and high impact factor journals discuss the free fall.\nFinally, case studies conducted on undergraduate students and teachers are\nreviewed.\n", "  In this work, we study the SM-like Higgs pair productions in the framework of\nthe general CP-violating two-Higgs-doublet model. Several constraints are\nimposed to the model sequentially, including the SM-like Higgs boson signal\nfits, the precise measurements of the electric dipole moments, the perturbative\nunitarity and stability bounds to the Higgs potential, and the most recent LHC\nsearches for the heavy Higgs bosons. We show how are the CP-violating mixing\nangles related to the Higgs cubic self couplings in this setup. Afterwards, we\nestimate the cross sections of the future LHC/SppC searches for the Higgs pair\nproductions, as well as other possible decay modes for the heavy Higgs bosons.\n", "  The production and the subsequent decay of the SM singlet via heavy\nvector--like colour triplets and electroweak doublets in one--loop diagrams can\nshed light on the recent observation of diphoton excess at the LHC. In this\npaper, the $E_6$ GUT is considered in the F-theory setting where the $E_6$ is\nbroken by making use of the spectral cover construction and by turning on the\nhypercharge gauge flux. This paper is based on the results presented in\n\\cite{Athanasopoulos:2014bba, Faraggi:2016xnm, Ashfaque:2016jha} which will be\nreviewed briefly. Here, by following the F-theory approach, akin to\n\\cite{Karozas:2016hcp, Leontaris:2016wsy, Das:2016xuc}, we present a study of\nthe flipped $SO(10)$ model embedded completely in the $E_{6}$ GUT but with a\ndifferent accommodation of the SM representations in the ${\\bf{27}}$ of\n$E_{6}$.\n", "  A search for the decays of the Higgs and $Z$ bosons to a $\\phi$ meson and a\nphoton is performed with a $pp$ collision data sample corresponding to an\nintegrated luminosity of 2.7 fb$^{-1}$ collected at $\\sqrt{s}=$13 TeV with the\nATLAS detector at the LHC. No significant excess of events is observed above\nthe background, and 95% confidence level upper limits on the branching\nfractions of the Higgs and $Z$ boson decays to $\\phi\\,\\gamma$ of\n1.4$\\times$10$^{-3}$ and 8.3$\\times$10$^{-6}$, respectively, are obtained.\n", "  We study the charge and spin density distributions of excitonic insulator\n(EI) states in the tight-binding approximation. We first discuss the charge and\nspin densities of the EI states when the valence and conduction bands are\ncomposed of orthogonal orbitals in a single atom. We show that the anisotropic\ncharge or spin density distribution occurs in a unit cell (or atom) and a\nhigher rank electric or magnetic multipole moment becomes finite, indicating\nthat the EI state corresponds to the multipole order. A full description of the\nmultipole moments for the $s$, $p$, and $d$ orbitals is then given in general.\nWe find that, in contrast to the conventional density-wave states, the\nmodulation of the total charge or net magnetization does not appear in this\ncase. However, when the conduction and valence bands include the component of\nthe same orbital, the modulation of the total charge or net magnetization\nappears, as in the conventional density-wave state. We also discuss the\nelectron density distribution in the EI state when the valence and conduction\nbands are composed of orbitals located in different atoms. We show that the\nexcitonic ordering in this case corresponds to the bond order formation. Based\non the results thus obtained we discuss the EI states of real materials\nrecently reported.\n", "  After revisiting the heterotic string-derived low-energy effective model of\n\\cite{Ashfaque:2016ydg, Athanasopoulos:2014bba, Faraggi:2016xnm,\nAshfaque:2016jha} constructed in the four-dimensional free fermionic\nformulation, we find two axions which are either harmful or massive. As a\ndirect consequence, they can not solve the strong $CP$ problem which is in\ncomplete agreement with \\cite{Lopez:1990iq, Halyo:1993xn}. We also explore the\npossibility of the self-interacting dark matter residing in the non-Abelian\ngauge group present in the hidden sector \\cite{Faraggi:2000pv}. We find that\nthe low-energy string-derived model naturally welcomes the self-interacting\ndark matter as $4$ copies of the non-Abelian, hidden $SU(2)$ gauge group factor\nare present.\n", "  Following recent developments in discrete gravity, we study geometrical\nvariables (angles and forms) of simplices in the discrete geometry point of\nview. Some of our relatively new results include: new ways of writing a set of\nsimplices using vectorial (differential form) and coordinate-free pictures, and\na consistent procedure to couple particles of space, together with a method to\ncalculate the degrees of freedom of the system of 'quanta' of space in the\nclassical framework.\n", "  Spatial correlations of the observed sizes and luminosities of galaxies can\nbe used to estimate the magnification that arises through weak gravitational\nlensing. However, the intrinsic prop- erties of galaxies can be similarly\ncorrelated through local physical effects, and these present a possible\ncontamination to the weak lensing estimation. In an earlier paper (Ciarlariello\net al. 2015) we modelled the intrinsic size correlations using the halo model,\nassuming the galaxy sizes reflect the mass in the associated halo. Here we\nextend this work to consider galaxy magnitudes and show that these may be even\nmore affected by intrinsic correlations than galaxy sizes, making this a bigger\nsystematic for measurements of the weak lensing signal. We also quantify how\nthese intrinsic correlations are affected by sample selection criteria based on\nsizes and magnitudes.\n", "  We examine an Unruh-DeWitt particle detector that is coupled linearly to the\nscalar density of a massless Dirac field in Minkowski spacetimes of dimension\n$d\\ge2$ and on the static Minkowski cylinder in spacetime dimension two,\nallowing the detector's motion to remain arbitrary and working to leading order\nin perturbation theory. In $d$-dimensional Minkowski, with the field in the\nusual Fock vacuum, we show that the detector's response is identical to that of\na detector coupled linearly to a massless scalar field in $2d$-dimensional\nMinkowski. In the special case of uniform linear acceleration, the detector's\nresponse hence exhibits the Unruh effect with a Planckian factor in both even\nand odd dimensions, in contrast to the Rindler power spectrum of the Dirac\nfield, which has a Planckian factor for odd $d$ but a Fermi-Dirac factor for\neven~$d$. On the two-dimensional cylinder, we set the oscillator modes in the\nusual Fock vacuum but allow an arbitrary state for the zero mode of the\nperiodic spinor. We show that the detector's response distinguishes the\nperiodic and antiperiodic spin structures, and the zero mode of the periodic\nspinor contributes to the response by a state-dependent but well defined\namount. Explicit analytic and numerical results on the cylinder are obtained\nfor inertial and uniformly accelerated trajectories, recovering the $d=2$\nMinkowski results in the limit of large circumference. The detector's response\nhas no infrared ambiguity for $d=2$, neither in Minkowski nor on the cylinder.\n", "  Values of the proton analysing power in the\n$pd\\to{}^{3}\\textrm{He}\\,\\pi^0/^{3}\\textrm{H}\\,\\pi^+$ reactions at 350-360~MeV\nper nucleon were obtained by using a polarised proton beam incident on a\ndeuterium cluster-jet target and with a polarised deuteron beam incident on a\ntarget cell filled with polarised hydrogen. These results have a much larger\nangular coverage than existing data. First measurements are also presented of\nthe deuteron vector analysing power and the deuteron-proton spin correlations.\nData were also obtained on the deuteron-proton spin correlation and proton\nanalysing power at small angles at 600~MeV per nucleon, though the angular\ncoverage at this energy was much more restricted even when using a deuteron\nbeam. By combining the extrapolated values of the spin correlations to the\nforward or backward directions with published measurements of the deuteron\ntensor analysing powers, the relative phases between the two non-vanishing\namplitudes were evaluated.\n", "  We present an analysis of two-dimensional (2D) matter-wave solitons, governed\nby the pseudo-spinor system of Gross-Pitaevskii equations with self- and\ncross-attraction, which includes the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in the general\nRashba-Dresselhaus form, and, separately, the Rashba coupling and the Zeeman\nsplitting. Families of semi-vortex (SV) and mixed-mode (MM) solitons are\nconstructed, which exist and are stable in free space, as the SOC terms prevent\nthe onset of the critical collapse and create the otherwise missing ground\nstates in the form of the solitons. The Dresselhaus SOC produces a destructive\neffect on the vortex solitons, while the Zeeman term tends to convert the MM\nstates into the SV ones, which eventually suffer delocalization. Existence\ndomains and stability boundaries are identified for the soliton families. For\nphysically relevant parameters of the SOC system, the number of atoms in the 2D\nsolitons is limited by $\\sim 1.5\\times 10^{4}$. The results are obtained by\nmeans of combined analytical and numerical methods.\n", "  Using Proca equation and WKB approximation, we investigate Hawking radiation\nof vector particles via tunneling from 4-dimensional Kerr-de Sitter black hole\nand 5-dimensional Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole. The results show that\nthe tunneling rates and Hawking temperatures are depended on the properties of\nspacetime (event horizon, mass and angular momentum). Besides, our results are\nthe same as scalars and fermions tunneling from 4-dimensional Kerr-de Sitter\nblack hole and 5-dimensional Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole.\n", "  A new tool for modeling electrochemical kinetics is presented. An extension\nof the Stochastic Simulation Algorithm framework to electrochemical systems is\nproposed. The physical justifications and constraints for the derivation of a\nchemical master equation are provided and discussed. The electrochemical\ndriving forces are included in the mathematical framework, and equations are\nprovided for the associated electric responses. The implementation for\npotentiostatic and galvanostatic systems is presented, with results pointing\nout the stochastic nature of the algorithm. The electric responses presented\nare in line with the expected results from the deterministic theory.\n", "  This perspective will overview an emerging paradigm for self-organized soft\nmaterials, {\\it geometrically-frustrated assemblies}, where interactions\nbetween self-assembling elements (e.g. particles, macromolecules, proteins)\nfavor local packing motifs that are incompatible with uniform global order in\nthe assembly. This classification applies to a broad range of material\nassemblies including self-twisting protein filament bundles, amyloid fibers,\nchiral smectics and membranes, particle-coated droplets, curved protein shells\nand phase-separated lipid vesicles. In assemblies, geometric frustration leads\nto a host of anomalous structural and thermodynamic properties, including\nheterogeneous and internally-stressed equilibrium structures, self-limiting\nassembly and topological defects in the equilibrium assembly structures. The\npurpose of this perspective is to 1) highlight the unifying principles and\nconsequences of geometric frustration in soft matter assemblies, 2) to classify\nthe known distinct \"modes\" of frustration and review corresponding experimental\nexamples, and 3) to describe outstanding questions not yet addressed about the\nunique properties and behaviors of this broad class of systems.\n", "  Quantum-statistical effects occur during the propagation of electromagnetic\n(EM) waves inside the dielectric media or metamaterials, which include a large\nclass of nanophotonic and plasmonic waveguides with dissipation and noise.\nExploiting the formal analogy between the Schrodinger equation and the Maxwell\nequations for dielectric linear media, we rigorously derive the effective\nHamiltonian operator which describes such propagation. This operator turns out\nto be essentially non-Hermitian in general, and pseudo-Hermitian in some\nspecial cases. Using the density operator approach for general non-Hermitian\nHamiltonians, we derive a master equation that describes the statistical\nensembles of EM wave modes. The method also describes the quantum dissipative\nand decoherence processes which happen during the wave's propagation, and,\namong other things, it reveals the conditions that are necessary to control the\nenergy and information loss inside the above-mentioned materials.\n", "  We derive a simple relational expression between the spin polarization ratio\nof resistivity, $P_\\rho$, and the anisotropic magnetoresistance ratio $\\Delta\n\\rho/\\rho$, and that between the spin polarization ratio of the density of\nstates at the Fermi energy, $P_{\\rm DOS}$, and $\\Delta \\rho/\\rho$ for nearly\nhalf-metallic ferromagnets. We find that $P_\\rho$ and $P_{\\rm DOS}$ increase\nwith increasing $|\\Delta \\rho/\\rho|$ from 0 to a maximum value. In addition, we\nroughly estimate $P_\\rho$ and $P_{\\rm DOS}$ for a Co$_2$FeGa$_{0.5}$Ge$_{0.5}$\nHeusler alloy by substituting its experimentally observed $\\Delta \\rho/\\rho$\ninto the respective expressions.\n", "  We study magnetotransport properties of the electron-doped superconductor\nPr$_{2-x}$Ce$_x$CuO$_{4\\pm\\delta}$ with $x$ = 0.14 in magnetic fields up to\n92~T, and observe Shubnikov de-Haas magnetic quantum oscillations. The\noscillations display a single frequency $F$=255$\\pm$10~T, indicating a small\nFermi pocket that is $\\sim$~1\\% of the two-dimensional Brillouin zone and\nconsistent with a Fermi surface reconstructed from the large hole-like cylinder\npredicted for these layered materials. Despite the low nominal doping, all\nelectronic properties including the effective mass and Hall effect are\nconsistent with overdoped compounds. Our study demonstrates that the\nexceptional chemical control afforded by high quality thin films will enable\nFermi surface studies deep into the overdoped cuprate phase diagram.\n", "  By means of the fossil record method implemented through Pipe3D, we\nreconstruct the global and radial stellar mass growth histories (MGHs) of an\nunprecedentedly large sample of galaxies, ranging from dwarf to giant objects,\nfrom the \"Mapping Nearby Galaxies at the Apache Point Observatory\" survey. We\nconfirm that the main driver of the global MGHs is mass, with more massive\ngalaxies assembling their masses earlier (downsizing), though for a given mass,\nthe global MGHs segregate by color, specific star formation rate (sSFR), and\nmorphological type. From the inferred radial mean MGHs, we find that at the\nlate evolutionary stages (or for fractions of assembled mass larger than ~\n80%), the innermost regions formed stars on average earlier than the outermost\nones (inside-out). At earlier epochs, when the age resolution of the method\nbecomes poor, the mass assembly seems to be spatially homogeneous or even in\nthe outside-in mode, specially for the red/quiescent/early-type galaxies. The\ninnermost MGHs are in general more regular (less scatter around the mean) than\nthe outermost ones. For dwarf and low-mass galaxies, we do not find evidence of\nan outside-in formation mode; instead their radial MGHs are very diverse most\nof the time, with periods of outside- in and inside-out modes (or strong radial\nmigration), suggesting this an episodic SF history. Blue/star-forming/late-type\ngalaxies present on average a significantly more pronounced inside-out\nformation mode than red/quiescent/early-type galaxies, independently of mass.\nWe discuss our results in the light of the processes of galaxy formation,\nquenching, and radial migration. We discuss also on the uncertainties and\nbiases of the fossil record method and how they could affect our results.\n", "  We present three dimensional maps in monochromatic extinction $A_{\\rm 0}$ and\nthe extinction parameter $R_0$ within a few degrees of the Galactic plane.\nThese are inferred using photometry from the Pan-STARRS1 and Spitzer Glimpse\nsurveys of nearly $20$ million stars located in the region $l = 0-250^{\\circ}$\nand from $b = -4.5^{\\circ}$ to $b=4.5^{\\circ}$. Given the available stellar\nnumber density, we use an angular resolution of $7' \\times 7'$ and steps of\n$1{\\rm mag}$ in distance modulus. We simultaneously estimate distance modulus\nand effective temperature $T_{\\rm eff}$ alongside the other parameters for\nstars individually using the method of \\citet{Hanson2014} before combining\nthese estimates to a complete map. The full maps are available via the MNRAS\nwebsite.\n", "  An array of ring resonators specifically designed can perform as a\ntopological insulator. We conduct simulations using both Tight-Binding Model\n(TBM) and Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) to analyze the transport properties of\nsuch optical structure, verifying the presence of robust topological edge\nstates which is immune to disorder and defect. We have also made a comparison\nbetween these two methods, of which results suggesting that TBM is only\napplicable under weakly-coupling condition while TMM is more rigorous. Finally\nwe compared the structure with common microring array and coupled resonator\noptical waveguide (CROW) to demonstrate that it has desired transmission\nproperties with wide and flat spectral response.\n", "  I will talk on our new theory on baryogenesis through type-II leptogenesis\nwhich is different from the well-known type-I leptogenesis. I will comment on\nthe Jarlskog phases, $\\delta_{\\rm CKM}$ and $\\delta_{\\rm PMNS}$, in the CKM and\nPMNS matrices. In the type-II leptogenesis, the PMNS phase is used for\nSakharov's condition on the global quantum number generation in the Universe.\nFor this to be effective, the SU(2)$\\times$U(1) gauge symmetry must be broken\nduring the leptogenesis epoch.\n", "  This paper investigates the relationship between subsystems and time in a\nclosed nonrelativistic system of interacting bosons and fermions. It is\npossible to write any state vector in such a system as an unentangled tensor\nproduct of subsystem vectors, and to do so in infinitely many ways. This\nrequires the superposition of different numbers of particles, but the theory\ncan describe in full the equivalence relation that leads to a particle-number\nsuperselection rule in conventionally defined subsystems. Time is defined as a\nfunctional of subsystem changes, thus eliminating the need for any reference to\nan external time variable. The dynamics of the unentangled subsystem\ndecomposition is derived from a variational principle of dynamical stability,\nwhich requires the decomposition to change as little as possible in any given\ninfinitesimal time interval, subject to the constraint that the state of the\ntotal system satisfy the Schroedinger equation. The resulting subsystem\ndynamics is deterministic. This determinism is regarded as a conceptual tool\nthat observers can use to make inferences about the outside world, not as a law\nof nature. The experiences of each observer define some properties of that\nobserver's subsystem during an infinitesimal interval of time (i.e., the\npresent moment); everything else must be inferred from this information. The\noverall structure of the theory has some features in common with quantum\nBayesianism, the Everett interpretation, and dynamical reduction models, but it\ndiffers significantly from all of these. The theory of information described\nhere is largely qualitative, as the most important equations have not yet been\nsolved. The quantitative level of agreement between theory and experiment thus\nremains an open question.\n", "  We derive in a simple manner and from first principles the Inglis\nsemi-classical phenomenological cranking model for nuclear collective rotation.\nThe derivation transforms the nuclear Schrodinger equation (instead of the\nHamiltonian) to a rotating frame using a product wavefunction and imposing no\nconstraints on either the wavefunction or the nucleon motion. The difference\nfrom Inglis model is that the frame rotation is driven by the motions of the\nnucleons and not externally. Consequently, the transformed Schrodinger equation\nis time-reversal invariant, and the total angular momentum is the sum of those\nof the intrinsic system and rotating frame. In this article, we choose the\nrotation of the frame to be given by a combination of rigid and irrotational\nflows. The dynamic angular velocity of the rotating frame is determined by the\nangular momentum of the frame and by a moment of inertia that is determined by\nthe nature of the flow combination. The intrinsic-system and rotating-frame\nangular momenta emerge to have opposite signs. The angular momentum of the\nrotating frame is determined from requiring the expectation of the total\nangular momentum to have a given value. The transformed Schrodinger equation\nhas, in addition to the Coriolis energy term, a rigid-flow type kinetic energy\nterm that is absent from the conventional cranking model Schrodinger equation.\nIgnoring the relatively small effect of the fluctuations in the angular\nvelocity and for a self-consistent deformed harmonic oscillator mean-field\npotential, the resulting Schrodinger equation is solved for the ground-state\nrotational band excitation energy and quadrupole moment in different\nconfigurations of Ne-20 and the results are compared with those of the\nconventional cranking model and empirical data.\n", "  This presentation discusses some recently active topics in the theoretical\ninterpretation of high energy heavy ion collisions at the LHC and at RHIC. We\nargue that the standard paradigm for understanding the spacetime evolution of\nthe bulk of the matter produced in the collision is provided by viscous\nrelativistic hydrodynamics, which can be used to systematically extract\nproperties of the QCD medium from experimental results. The initial conditions\nof this hydrodynamical evolution are increasingly well understood in terms of\ngluon saturation, and can be quantified using Classical Yang-Mills fields and\nQCD effective kinetic theory. Hard and electromagnetic probes of the plasma\nprovide additional constraints. A particularly fascinating subject are high\nmultiplicity proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions, where some of the\ncharacteristics previously attributed to only nucleus-nucleus collisions have\nbeen observed.\n", "  We analyze export data aggregated at world global level of 219 classes of\nproducts over a period of 39 years. Our main goal is to set up a dynamical\nmodel to identify and quantify plausible mechanisms by which the evolutions of\nthe various exports affect each other. This is pursued through a stochastic\ndifferential description, partly inspired by approaches used in population\ndynamics or directed polymers in random media. We outline a complex network of\ntransfer rates which describes how resources are shifted between different\nproduct classes, and determines how casual favorable conditions for one export\ncan spread to the other ones. A calibration procedure allows to fit four free\nmodel-parameters such that the dynamical evolution becomes consistent with the\naverage growth, the fluctuations, and the ranking of the export values observed\nin real data. Growth crucially depends on the balance between maintaining and\nshifting resources to different exports, like in an explore-exploit problem.\nRemarkably, the calibrated parameters warrant a close-to-maximum growth rate\nunder the transient conditions realized in the period covered by data, implying\nan optimal self organization of the global export. According to the model,\nmajor structural changes in the global economy take tens of years.\n", "  BACKGROUND: Some but not all prior studies have shown that women receiving a\nprimary prophylactic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) have a lower\nrisk of death and appropriate shocks than men.\n  PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of gender on the risk of appropriate shock,\nall-cause mortality and inappropriate shock in contemporary studies of patients\nreceiving a primary prophylactic ICD.\n  DATA SOURCE: PubMed, LIVIVO, Cochrane CENTRAL between 2010 and 2016.\n  STUDY SELECTION: Studies providing at least 1 gender-specific risk estimate\nfor the outcomes of interest.\n  DATA EXTRACTION: Abstracts were screened independently for potentially\neligible studies for inclusion. Thereby each abstract was reviewed by at least\ntwo authors.\n  DATA SYNTHESIS: Out of 680 abstracts retained by our search strategy, 20\nstudies including 46'657 patients had gender-specific information on at least\none of the relevant endpoints. Mean age across the individual studies varied\nbetween 58 and 69 years. The proportion of women enrolled ranged from 10% to\n30%. Across 6 available studies, women had a significantly lower risk of first\nappropriate shock compared with men (pooled multivariable adjusted hazard ratio\n0.62 (95% CI [0.44; 0.88]). Across 14 studies reporting multivariable adjusted\ngender-specific hazard ratio estimates for all-cause mortality, women had a\nlower risk of death than men (pooled hazard ratio 0.75 (95% CI [0.66; 0.86]).\nThere was no statistically significant difference for the incidence of first\ninappropriate shocks (3 studies, pooled hazard ratio 0.99 (95% CI [0.56;\n1.73]).\n  CONCLUSION: In this large contemporary meta-analysis, women had a\nsignificantly lower risk of appropriate shocks and death than men, but a\nsimilar risk of inappropriate shocks. These data may help to select patients\nwho benefit from primary prophylactic ICD implantation.\n", "  Blazars, one of the most extreme class of active galaxies, constitute so far\nthe largest known population of $\\gamma$-ray sources and their number is\ncontinuously growing in the Fermi catalogs. However in the latest release of\nthe Fermi catalog there is still a large fraction of sources that are\nclassified as blazar candidate of uncertain type (BCUs) for which optical\nspectroscopic observations are necessary to confirm their nature and their\nassociations. In addition about 1/3 of the $\\gamma$-ray point sources listed in\nthe Third Fermi-LAT Source Catalog (3FGL) are still unassociated and lacking an\nassigned lower energy counterpart. Since 2012 we have been carrying out an\noptical spectroscopic campaign to observe blazar candidates to confirm their\nnature. In this paper, the sixth of the series, we present optical\nspectroscopic observations for 30 $\\gamma$-ray blazar candidates from different\nobserving programs we carried out with the TNG, WHT, OAN, SOAR and Magellan\ntelescopes. We found that 21 out of 30 sources investigated are BL Lac objects\nwhile the remaining targets are classified as flat spectrum radio quasars\nshowing the typical broad emission lines of normal quasi stellar objects. We\nconclude that our selection of $\\gamma$-ray blazars candidates based on their\nmultifrequency properties continues to be a successful way to discover\npotential low-energy counterparts of the FermiUnidentified Gamma-ray Sources\n(UGSs) and to confirm the nature of BCUs.\n", "  Partially gold coated 90 degree glass wedges and a semi - infinite slit in a\nthin film of gold ending in a conducting nano-junction serve as samples to\ninvestigate the transfer of photon spin to electron orbital angular momentum.\nThese structures were specifically designed as samples where an incident beam\nof light is retroreflected. Since in the process of retroreflection the turning\nsense of a circularly polarized beam of light does not change and the direction\nof propagation is inverted, the photon spin is inverted. Due to conservation of\nangular momentum a transfer of photon spin to electron orbital angular momentum\nof conduction electrons occurs. In the structures a circular movement of\nelectrons is blocked and therefore the transfered spin can be detected as a\nphotovoltage due to an electromotive force which is induced by the transfer of\nangular momentum. Depending on the polarization of the incident beam, a maximum\nphotovoltage of about 0,2 micro V was measured for both structures. The results\nare interpreted in terms of a classical electrodynamic model of the\nmonochromatic linearly polarized photon as a propagating solitary\nelectromagnetic wave of finite energy hf which carries an angular momentum\nh/2pi which is elaborated elsewhere where h is Plancks constant and f the\nfrequency of light. The relative values of the measured photovoltages for\ndifferent polarizations can well be explained by the electrodynamic model of a\nphoton and an associated spin angular momentum. The absolute values of the\nmeasured photovoltages are also consistent with the interpretation. The\nobserved effects are closely related to the lateral Fedorov Imbert shift of\nfocused beams in optics and the optical spin Hall effect and to other non\nlinear optical effects such as the inverse faraday effect for which a new\ninterpretation is given here in terms of the electrodynamic model of the photon\nand its spin.\n", "  We construct the hyperbolic plane with its geodesic flow as the scale plus\nsymmetry reduction of a three-body problem in the Euclidean plane. The\npotential is $-I/\\Delta^2$ where $I$ is the triangle's moment of inertia and\n$\\Delta$ its area. The reduction method uses the Jacobi-Maupertuis metric,\nfollowing the author's earlier paper \"Putting Hyperbolic Pants on a Three-body\nProblem\".\n", "  The evaluation of phase stabilities of unstable elemental phases is a\nlong-standing problem in the computational assessment of phase diagrams. Here\nwe tackle this problem by explicitly calculating phase diagrams of\nintermetallic systems where its effect should be most conspicuous, binary\nsystems of titanium with bcc transition metals (Mo, Nb, Ta and V). Two types of\nphase diagrams are constructed: one based on the lattice stabilities extracted\nfrom empirical data, and the other using the lattice stabilities computed from\nfirst principles. It is shown that the phase diagrams obtained using the\nempirical values contain clear contradictions with the experimental phase\ndiagrams at the well known limits of low or high temperatures. Realistic phase\ndiagrams, with a good agreement with the experimental observations, are\nachieved only when the computed lattice stability values are used. At\nintermediate temperatures, the computed phase diagrams resolve the controversy\nregarding the shape of the solvus in these systems, predicting a complex\nstructure with a eutectoid transition and a miscibility gap between two bcc\nphases.\n", "  An ensemble density matrix model that includes one- and two-body losses is\nderived for a trapped-atom clock. A trapped-atom clock is mainly affected by\none- and two-body losses, generally giving nonexponential decays of\npopulations; nevertheless, three-body recombination is also quantitatively\nanalyzed to demonstrate the boundaries of its practical relevance. The\nimportance of one-body losses is highlighted without which population trapping\nbehavior would be observed. The model is written with decay constants expressed\nthrough experimental parameters. It can complement, e.g., the ISRE (identical\nspin rotation effect) model to improve its predictions: ISRE dramatically\nincreases the ensemble coherence time, hence it enables one to observe the\ninfluence of two-body losses on the interferometry contrast envelope. The\npresented model is useful for Ramsey interferometry and is ready for immediate\nexperimental verification in existing systems.\n", "  Since in situ studies and interplanetary dust collections only provide a\nspatially limited amount of information about the interplanetary dust\nproperties, it is of major importance to complete these studies with properties\ninferred from remote observations of light scattered and emitted, with\ninterpretation through simulations. Physical properties of the interplanetary\ndust in the near-ecliptic symmetry surface, such as the local polarization,\ntemperature and composition, together with their heliocentric variations, may\nbe derived from scattered and emitted light observations, giving clues to the\nrespective contribution of the particles sources. A model of light scattering\nby a cloud of solid particles constituted by spheroidal grains and aggregates\nthereof is used to interpret the local light scattering data. Equilibrium\ntemperature of the same particles allows us to interpret the temperature\nheliocentric variations. A good fit of the local polarization phase curve,\n$P_{\\alpha}$, near 1.5~AU from the Sun is obtained for a mixture of silicates\nand more absorbing organics material ($\\approx$40 % in mass) and for a\nrealistic size distribution typical of the interplanetary dust in the 0.2 to\n200 micrometre size range. The contribution of dust particles of cometary\norigin is at least 20% in mass. The same size distribution of particles gives a\nsolar distance, $R$, dependence of the temperature in $R^{-0.45}$ different\nthan the typical black body behavior. The heliocentric dependence of\n$P_{\\alpha=90{\\deg}}$ is interpreted as a progressive disappearance of solid\norganics (such as HCN polymers or amorphous carbon) towards the Sun.\n", "  Understanding the properties of particle aggregation and resulting aggregates\nunder microgravity conditions leads to better insights on the formation of the\nearly Solar System planetesimals. Simulating such conditions is the main\nobjective of Interactions in Cosmic and Atmospheric Particle System (ICAPS), a\nmulti-users facility currently under phase B at ESA for the International Space\nStation. First results of light scattering simulations by core-mantle\naggregates of grains with organics and icy mantles are presented to show the\nevolution of polarization with aggregation. The Light Scattering Unit is both a\npolarization diagnostic tool for ICAPS, and an experiment that will allow the\ninterpretation of the available light scattering dust observations in terms of\nphysical properties of the scattering media. This presentation updates the\ncurrent approach of the calibration procedures and the innovative experimental\nsetup (providing a phase angle exploration from about 2{\\deg} to 175{\\deg}\ntogether with a wavelength exploration from 0.4 to 0.8 micrometer). We also\nassess the possibility for the determination of the entire Stokes vector of the\nlight scattered by the aggregates.\n", "  A cellular automaton collider is a finite state machine build of rings of\none-dimensional cellular automata. We show how a computation can be performed\non the collider by exploiting interactions between gliders (particles,\nlocalisations). The constructions proposed are based on universality of\nelementary cellular automaton rule 110, cyclic tag systems, supercolliders, and\ncomputing on rings.\n", "  Aminosilanes are routinely employed for charge reversal or to create coupling\nlayers on oxide surfaces. We present a chemical vapor deposition method to\npattern mica surfaces with regions of high-quality aminosilane\n(3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, APTES) monolayers. The approach relies on the\nvapor deposition of an aminosilane through a patterned array of through-holes\nin a PDMS (poly(dimethylsiloxane)) membrane that acts as a mask. In aqueous\nsolutions the surfaces have regular patterns of charge heterogeneities with\nminimal topographical variations over large areas. This versatile dry lift-off\ndeposition method alleviates issues with multilayer formation and can be used\nto create charge patterns on curved surfaces. We identify the necessary steps\nto achieve high quality monolayers and charge reversal of the underlying mica\nsurface: 1) hexane extraction to remove unreacted PDMS oligomers from the\nmembrane that would otherwise deposit on and contaminate the substrate, 2)\noxygen plasma treatment of the top of the membrane surfaces to generate a\nbarrier layer that blocks APTES transport through the PDMS, and 3) decrease of\nthe vapor pressure of APTES during deposition to minimize APTES condensation at\nthe mica-membrane-vapor contact lines and to prevent multilayer formation.\nUnder these conditions, AFM imaging shows that the monolayers have a height of\n0.9nm with an increase in height up to 3nm at the mica-membrane-vapor contact\nlines. Fluorescence imaging demonstrates pattern fidelity on both flat and\ncurved surfaces, for feature sizes that vary between 6.5-40 um. We verify\ncharge reversal by measuring the double layer forces between a homogeneous\nAPTES monolayers and a mica surface in aqueous solution and we characterize the\nsurface potential of APTES monolayers by measuring the double layer forces\nbetween identical APTES surfaces. We obtain a surface potential of 110mV at pH\n4.0.\n", "  We report a novel approach for on-chip electrical detection of the radiation\nguided by dielectric-loaded surface plasmon polariton waveguides (DLSPPW) and\nDLSPPW-based components. The detection is realized by fabricating DLSPPW\ncomponents on the surface of a gold (Au) pad supported by a silicon (Si)\nsubstrate supplied with aluminum pads facilitating electrical connections, with\nthe gold pad being perforated in a specific locations below the DLSPPWs in\norder to allow a portion of the DLSPPW-guided radiation to leak into the\nSi-substrate, where it is absorbed and electrically detected. We present\ntwo-dimensional photocurrent maps obtained when the laser beam is scanning\nacross the gold pad containing the fabricated DLSPPW components that are\nexcited via grating couplers located at the DLSPPW tapered terminations. By\ncomparing photocurrent signals obtained when scanning over a DLSPPW straight\nwaveguide with those related to a DLSPPW racetrack resonator, we first\ndetermine the background signal level and then the corrected DLSPPW resonator\nspectral response, which is found consistent with that obtained from full wave\nnumerical simulations. The approach developed can be extended to other\nplasmonic waveguide configurations and advantageously used for rapid\ncharacterization of complicated plasmonic circuits.\n", "  We present results of optical observations of the extremely violently\nvariable blazar S4 0954+65 on intra-night time scales. The object showed flux\nchanges of up to 100% within a few hours. Time delays between optical bands,\ncolor changes and \"rms-flux\" relations are investigated and the results are\ndiscussed in terms of existing models of blazar variability.\n", "  In recent paper of Falkovich and Levitov it was shown, that geometry of\nseparatrixes for viscous electronic flow in graphene is sensitive to boundary\nconditions. Here we discover theis relation in details. Also we propose, how\nboundary conditions could be probed experimentally, using weak magnetic field\nand observed features of separatrixes.\n", "  We applied the method of continuous wavelet-transform to the time-frequency\nanalysis to the sets of observations of relative sunspot numbers, sunspot areas\nand to 6 Mount Wilson HK-project stars with well-defined magnetic cycles.\nWavelet analysis of these data reveals the following pattern: at the same time\nthere are several activity cycles whose periods vary widely from the\nquasi-biennial up to the centennial period for the Sun and vary significant\nduring observations time of the HK-project stars. These relatively\nlow-frequency periodic variations of the solar and stellar activity gradually\nchange the values of periods of different cycles in time. This phenomenon can\nbe observed in every cycles of activity\n", "  The present work investigates the role of grain boundary (GB) on the sources\nof size effects. Up to now, several studies have been conducted to address the\nrole of GBs in size effects from the atomistic point of view. However, a study\nwhich addresses the role of GB on different governing mechanisms of size\neffects as the sample length scale varies has not been presented yet. The\nresults show that the main role of GB at larger length scale is to change the\npattern of dislocation structure in a way that the dislocations are piled up\nnear the GB which increases the hardness.\n", "  Experimental results from mechanical viscoelastic as well as dielectric\nrelaxation times were compared to theoretical expectations utilizing polymer\nscaling theory. Viscoelastic relaxation of a hydrogel at 33% relative humidity\nfabricated from co-poly-L-(glutamic acid$_{4}$, tyrosine$_{1}$) [PLEY(4:1)]\ncrosslinked with poly-L-lysine scaled with concentration according to reptation\ndynamics. High frequency dielectric relaxation of aqueous copolymer PLEY(4:1)\nscaled with concentration as an ideal chain and aqueous Poly-L-glutamic acid\nscaled as an extended chain. The study shows that two seemingly different\nmeasurement methods can yield information about the state of polymer chain\nconformation in situ.\n", "  We discuss the hypothesis that the debate about the interpretation of the\northodox formalism of quantum mechanics (QM) might have been misguided right\nfrom the start by a biased metaphysical interpretation of the formalism and its\ninner mathematical relations. In particular, we focus on the orthodox\ninterpretation of the congruence relation, '=', which relates equivalent\nclasses of different mathematical representations of a vector in Hilbert space,\nin terms of metaphysical identity. We will argue that this seemingly \"common\nsense\" interpretation, at the semantic level, has severe difficulties when\nconsidering the syntactic level of the theory.\n", "  Vacuum nanodevices are devices that the electron transport through them is\nbased on electron field emission from a nano-eimtter to another opposite\nelectrode through a vacuum channel. Geometrically asymmetric metal-vacuum-metal\nstructures were demonstrated to have energy conversion ability for elec-\ntromagnetic waves in the optical range. Combining the ability of these\nstructures to convert optical signals into recti ed current and the ability of\nvacuum nanotriodes to control the eld emission current can allow direct\nprocessing on converted optical signals using a single device. In this paper, a\nthree-dimensional quantum-mechanical method, rather than the approximate\nFowler-Nordheim theory, is used for modeling the eld emission process in\nvertical-type vacuum nanotriodes consisting of an emitter, a collector and a\ngate. The electron transport through the device is computed using a\ntransfer-matrix technique. The potentials of vacuum nanotriodes in the current\nrecti cation and modulation are investigated at low volt- ages. The e ects of\nvarying the structure geometrical parameters on the recti ed current are also\nstudied. The obtained results show that a great enhancement in the recti cation\nproperties is achievable when the gate and the collector are connected through\na DC source. It is also demonstrated that a small variation in the gate voltage\ncan be used either to modulate the recti ed current or to switch the device\ninto a resonant tunneling diode.26\n", "  We report a novel design of a compact wavelength add-drop multiplexer\nutilizing dielectric-loaded surface plasmon-polariton waveguides (DLSPPWs). The\nDLSPPW-based configuration exploits routing properties of directional couplers\nand filtering abilities of Bragg gratings. We present practical realization of\na 20-$\\mu$m-long device operating at telecom wavelengths that can reroute\noptical signals separated by approximately 70 nm in the wavelength band. We\ncharacterize the performance of the fabricated structures using scanning\nnear-field optical microscopy as well as leakage-radiation microscopy and\nsupport our findings with numerical simulations.\n", "  Networks created from real-world data contain some inaccuracies or noise,\nmanifested as small changes in the network structure. An important question is\nwhether these small changes can significantly affect the analysis results. In\nthis paper, we study the effect of noise in changing ranks of the high\ncentrality vertices. We compare, using the Jaccard Index (JI), how many of the\ntop-k high centrality nodes from the original network are also part of the\ntop-k ranked nodes from the noisy network. We deem a network as stable if the\nJI value is high. We observe two features that affect the stability. First, the\nstability is dependent on the number of top-ranked vertices considered. When\nthe vertices are ordered according to their centrality values, they group into\nclusters. Perturbations to the network can change the relative ranking within\nthe cluster, but vertices rarely move from one cluster to another. Second, the\nstability is dependent on the local connections of the high ranking vertices.\nThe network is highly stable if the high ranking vertices are connected to each\nother. Our findings show that the stability of a network is affected by the\nlocal properties of high centrality vertices, rather than the global properties\nof the entire network. Based on these local properties we can identify the\nstability of a network, without explicitly applying a noise model.\n", "  Nanoantenna enhanced ultrafast emission from colloidal quantum dots as\nquantum emitters is required for fast quantum communications. On chip\nintegration of such devices require a scalable and high throughput technology.\nWe report self-assembly lithography technique of preparing hybrid of\ngold-nanorods antenna over a com- pact CdSe quantum dot monolayer. We\ndemonstrate resonant and off resonant gold nanorod antenna enhanced radiative\nand anisotropic decay. Extensive simulations explain the mechanism of the decay\nrates and the role of antenna in both random and a compact monolayer of quantum\ndots. The study could find applications in quantum dots display and quantum\ncommunications devices.\n", "  In-situ powder diffraction was used to study the annealing of dislocations in\nthe archetypal hydrogen absorbers Pd and LaNi5. The relationship between\ndislocations and trapped hydrogen was explored using thermally induced\ndesorption. It was found that the dislocations in Pd caused by hydrogen\nabsorption anneal over a wide range of temperatures and that although they\nstart to anneal below 250 $^\\circ$C, temperatures well above 750 $^\\circ$C are\nrequired to fully anneal the metal. It was shown that allowing further time at\nlower temperatures does not further anneal the metal. It is suggested that this\nis due to dislocation tangling and pinning, causing different temperatures to\nbe required for different pinning defects. It was found that hydrogen trapped\nin LaNi5 is released in a wide range of temperatures and it was therefore\nconcluded that hydrogen is trapped in the dislocation strain field and\ndislocation core as well as vacancies. The direct comparison of deuterium\nrelease and dislocation density showed no correlation, in agreement with\nprevious indirect comparisons. Dislocations in LaNi5 were shown to anneal at\ntemperatures as low as 150 $^\\circ$C, in contrast to previous reports which\nsuggested more than 500 $^\\circ$C was required. This lower annealing\ntemperature for dislocations at least partly explains why low temperature\nageing increases the pressure hysteresis in hydrogen cycled LaNi5.\n", "  Composite hybrid gold crystals are of profound interest in various research\nareas ranging from materials science to biology. Their importance is due to\ntheir unique properties and potential implementation, for example in sensing or\nin bio-nanomedicine. Here we report on the formation of hybrid organic-metal\ncomposites via the incorporation of selected amino acids histidine, aspartic\nacid, serine, glutamine, alanine, cysteine, and selenocystine into the crystal\nlattice of single crystals of gold. We used electron microscopy, chemical\nanalysis and high-resolution synchrotron powder X ray diffraction to examine\nthese composites. Crystal shape, as well as atomic concentrations of occluded\namino acids and their impact on the crystal structure of gold, were determined.\nConcentration of the incorporated amino acid was highest for cysteine, followed\nby serine and aspartic acid. Our results indicate that the incorporation\nprocess probably occurs through a complex interaction of their individual\nfunctional groups with gold atoms. Although various organic gold composites\nhave been prepared, to the best of our knowledge this is the first reported\nfinding of incorporation of organic molecules within the gold lattice. We\npresent a versatile strategy for fabricating crystalline nanohybrid composite\ngold crystals of potential importance for a wide range of applications.\n", "  Classical Cepheids are among the most useful Galactic and nearby\nextragalactic distance tracers because of their well-defined period--luminosity\nrelations (PLRs). Open cluster (OC) Cepheids are important objects to\nindependently calibrate these PLRs. Based on Data Release 1 of the {\\sl VISTA}\nVariables in the V\\'ia L\\'actea survey, we have discovered four new, faint and\nheavily reddened OC Cepheids, including the longest-period OC Cepheid known,\nASAS J180342$-$2211.0 in Teutsch 14a. The other OC--Cepheid pairs include NGC\n6334 and V0470 Sco, Majaess 170 and ASAS J160125$-$5150.3, and Teutsch 77 and\nBB Cen. ASAS J180342$-$2211.0, with a period of $\\log P = 1.623$ [days] is\nimportant to constrain the slope of the PLR. The currently most complete\n$JHK_{\\rm s}$ Galactic Cepheid PLRs are obtained based on a significantly\nincreased sample of 31 OC Cepheids, with associated uncertainties that are\nimproved by 40 per cent compared with previous determinations (in the $J$\nband). The NIR PLRs are in good agreement with previous PLRs determined based\non other methods.\n", "  The jet quenching phenomenon in heavy ion collisions provides a strong\nevidence of the modification of parton shower in the quark-gluon plasma. This\ncontribution focuses on the hard probes of QGP using jets and summarizes the\nnew theoretical progress of jet substructure modification studies using\neffective field theory techniques. We emphasize the important role of jet\nsubstructure observables as they probe various aspects of the jet formation\nmechanism and allow us to study the medium properties in great details. The\nprecise calculations require the systematic resummation and consistently\nincluding medium modifications. Specifically, we discuss the calculations of\njet shapes and cross sections in proton-proton and lead-lead collisions at the\nLHC using soft-collinear effective theory, with Glauber gluon interactions in\nthe medium. In the end we present the comparison between our calculations and\nthe recent measurements at the LHC with very good agreement. We conclude that\nprecise jet modification studies in heavy ion collisions has been initiated.\n", "  In this paper, some known and novel properties of the Cauchy and signaling\nproblems for the one-dimensional time-fractional diffusion-wave equation with\nthe Caputo fractional derivative of order $\\beta,\\ 1 \\le \\beta \\le 2$ are\ninvestigated. In particular, their response to a localized disturbance of the\ninitial data is studied. It is known that whereas the diffusion equation\ndescribes a process where the disturbance spreads infinitely fast, the\npropagation velocity of the disturbance is a constant for the wave equation. We\nshow that the time-fractional diffusion-wave equation interpolates between\nthese two different responses in the sense that the propagation velocities of\nthe maximum points, centers of gravity, and medians of the fundamental\nsolutions to both the Cauchy and the signaling problems are all finite. On the\nother hand, the disturbance spreads infinitely fast and the time-fractional\ndiffusion-wave equation is non-relativistic like the classical diffusion\nequation. In this paper, the maximum locations, the centers of gravity, and the\nmedians of the fundamental solution to the Cauchy and signaling problems and\ntheir propagation velocities are described analytically and calculated\nnumerically. The obtained results for the Cauchy and the signaling problems are\ninterpreted and compared to each other.\n", "  A nanosecond time-resolved APD detector system is implemented for Nuclear\nResonance Scattering (NRS) experiments in High Energy Photon Source-Test\nFacility (HEPS-TF) project of China. The detector system consists of three\nparts: the APD sensors, the fast preamplifiers and the TDC readout electronics.\nTo improve the reception solid angle and the quantum efficiency, the C30703FH\nAPDs (fabricated by Excelitas) are used as the sensors of the detectors. The\nC30703FH has an effective light-sensitive area of 10X10 mm2 and an absorption\nlayer thickness of 110 {\\mu}m. The fast preamplifier with gain of 59 dB and\nbandwidth of 2 GHz is designed to readout the weak signal outputted by the\nC30703FH APD. The detector system can work in single photon measurement mode\nbecause the preamplifier increases the signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, the TDC\nis realized by FPGA multiphase method with a resolution bin of 1ns. The arrival\ntime of all scattering events between two start triggers can be recorded by the\nFPGA TDC. In the X-ray energy of 14.4 keV, the time resolution (FWHM) of the\ndeveloped detector (APD sensor + fast amplifier) is 0.86 ns, and the whole\ndetector system (APD sensors + fast amplifiers + TDC readout electronics)\nachieves a time resolution of 1.4 ns.\n", "  Biominerals formed by animals provide skeletal support, and many other\nfunctions. They were previously shown to grow by aggregation of amorphous\nnanoparticles, but never to grow ion-by-ion from solution, which is a common\ngrowth mechanism for abiotic crystals. We analyze vaterite CaCO3 multi\ncrystalline spicules from the solitary tunicate Herdmania momus, with\nPolarization dependent Imaging Contrast PIC mapping, scanning and aberration\ncorrected transmission electron microscopies. The first fully quantitative PIC\nmapping data, presented here, measured 0{\\deg} 30{\\deg} angle spreads between\nimmediately adjacent crystals. Such narrowly distributed crystal orientations\ndemonstrate that crystallinity does not propagate from one crystal to another\n0{\\deg} angle spreads, nor that new crystals with random orientation 90{\\deg}\nnucleate. There are no organic layers at the interface between crystals, hence\na new, unknown growth mechanism must be invoked, with crystal nucleation\nconstrained within 30{\\deg}. Two observations are consistent with crystal\ngrowth from solution: vaterite microcrystals express crystal faces, and are\nsmooth at the nanoscale after cryo fracture. The observation of 30{\\deg} angle\nspreads, lack of interfacial organic layers, and smooth fracture figures\nbroadens the range of known biomineralization mechanisms and may inspire novel\nsynthetic crystal growth strategies. Spherulitic growth from solution is one\npossible mechanism consistent with all these observations.\n", "  Single crystals in nature often demonstrate fascinating intricate porous\nmorphologies rather than classical faceted surfaces. We attempt to grow such\ncrystals, drawing inspiration from biogenic porous single crystals. Here we\nshow that nanoporous single crystals of gold can be grown with no need for any\nelaborate fabrication steps. These crystals are found to grow following\nsolidification of a eutectic composition melt that forms as a result of the\ndewetting of nanometric thin films. We also present a kinetic model that shows\nhow this nano-porous single-crystalline structure can be obtained, and which\nallows the potential size of the porous single crystal to be predicted.\nRetaining their single crystalline nature is due to the fact that the full\ncrystallization process is faster than the average period between two\nsubsequent nucleation events. Our findings clearly demonstrate that it is\npossible to form singe crystalline nano porous metal crystals in a controlled\nmanner. INTRODUCTION\n", "  It is now established that subcritical mechanisms play a crucial role in the\ntransition to turbulence of non-rotating plane shear flows. The role of these\nmechanisms in rotating channel flow is examined here in the linear and\nnonlinear stages. Distinct patterns of behaviour are found: the transient\ngrowth leading to nonlinearity at low rotation rates $Ro$, a highly chaotic\nintermediate $Ro$ regime, a localised weak chaos at higher $Ro$, and complete\nstabilization of transient disturbances at very high $Ro$. At very low $Ro$,\nthe transient growth amplitudes are close to those for non-rotating flow, but\nCoriolis forces already assert themselves by producing distinct asymmetry about\nthe channel centreline. Nonlinear processes are then triggered, in a\nstreak-breakdown mode of transition. The high $Ro$ regimes do not show these\nsignatures, here the leading eigenmode emerges as dominant in the early stages.\nElongated structures plastered close to one wall are seen at higher rotation\nrates. Rotation is shown to reduce non-normality in the linear operator, in an\nindirect manifestation of Taylor--Proudman effects. Although the critical\nReynolds for exponential growth of instabilities is known to vary a lot with\nrotation rate, we show that the energy critical Reynolds number is insensitive\nto rotation rate. It is hoped that these findings will motivate experimental\nverification, and examination of other rotating flows in this light.\n", "  Crystals in nature often demonstrate curved morphologies rather than\nclassical faceted surfaces. Inspired by biogenic curved single crystals, we\ndemonstrate that gold single crystals exhibiting curved surfaces can be grown\nwith no need of any fabrication steps. These single crystals grow from the\nconfined volume of a droplet of a eutectic composition melt which forms via the\ndewetting of nanometric thin films. We can control their curvature by\ncontrolling the environment in which the process is carried out, including\nseveral parameters, such as the contact angle and the curvature of the drops by\nchanging the surface tension of the liquid drop during crystal growth. Here we\npresent an energetic model that explains this phenomenon and predicts why and\nunder what conditions crystals will be forced to grow with the curvature of the\nmicro droplet even though the energetic state of a curved single crystal is\nvery high.\n", "  Many crystals in nature exhibit fascinating mechanical, optical, magnetic and\nother characteristics. One of the reasons for this phenomenon has to do with\nthe presence of specific organic molecules that are tightly associated with the\nmineral. Over the years, some organic crystals have been found to be located\nwithin the lattices of their singlecrystalline biogenic hosts. A number of\nquestions remain unanswered: for example, how do these molecules become\nincorporated and what is their function? In this review we survey the gradual\nrefinement of the above mentioned finding in biogenic crystals, with the object\nof tracing the acquisition of our fundamental knowledge in this field during\nthe last 50 years. We highlight the progress made in understanding the function\nand significance of this intracrystalline organic matter, from the earliest\nobservations of this phenomenon in a biological system to the highly promising\nrecent achievements in bio-inspired material synthesis, where intracrystalline\nmolecules have been used in many studies to synthesize numerous synthetic\nnanohybrid composites with fascinating new properties.\n", "  We demonstrate the generation of far-field propagating optical beams with a\ndesired orbital angular momentum by using a smooth optical mode transformation\nbetween a plasmonic vortex and free space Laguerre-Gaussian modes. This is\nobtained by means of an adiabatically tapered gold tip surrounded by a spiral\nslit. The proposed physical model, backed up by the numerical study, brings\nabout an optimized structure which is fabricated by using highly reproducible\nsecondary electron lithography technique. Optical measurements of the structure\nexcellently agree with the theoretically predicted far-field distributions.\nThis architecture provides a unique platform for a localized excitation of\nplasmonic vortices followed by its beaming.\n", "  We present the first single-burst stellar population models which covers the\noptical and the infrared wavelength range between 3500 and 50000 Angstrom and\nwhich are exclusively based on empirical stellar spectra. To obtain these joint\nmodels, we combined the extended MILES models in the optical with our new\ninfrared models that are based on the IRTF (Infrared Telescope Facility)\nlibrary. The latter are available only for a limited range in terms of both age\nand metallicity. Our combined single-burst stellar population models were\ncalculated for ages larger than 1 Gyr, for metallicities between [Fe/H] = -0.40\nand 0.26, for initial mass functions of various types and slopes, and on the\nbasis of two different sets of isochrones. They are available to the scientific\ncommunity on the MILES web page. We checked the internal consistency of our\nmodels and compared their colour predictions to those of other models that are\navailable in the literature. Optical and near infrared colours that are\nmeasured from our models are found to reproduce the colours well that were\nobserved for various samples of early-type galaxies. Our models will enable a\ndetailed analysis of the stellar populations of observed galaxies.\n", "  We investigate the ground state of two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates\nwith Rashba spin-orbit coupling in square optical lattices and demonstrate the\nexistence of rich phases with different lattice structures, which is closely\nrelated to the degenerate structure of single particle energy spectrum induced\nby the competition of spin-orbit coupling and optical lattices. We find that\nthe ground state is in the phase with either parity-time-reversal or parity\nsymmetry by direct numerical simulation. We show the phase diagram of ground\nstate in the whole regime of spin-orbit coupling strength, and particularly\nfind that the system supports multi-fold vortex lattices, in which ground state\nholds half-quantum vortex lattices, vortex-antivortex pair lattices and\nfundamental vortex lattices, simultaneously, when single particle energy\nminimums touch the boundary of the first Brillouin zone.\n", "  Distance estimates from Gaia parallax and expected luminosities are compared\nfor KIC 8462852. Gaia DR1 yields a parallax of $2.55\\pm0.31$mas, that is a\ndistance of $391.4\\substack{+53.6 \\\\ -42.0}$pc, or $391.4\\substack{+122.1 \\\\\n-75.2}$pc including systematic uncertainty. The distance estimate based on the\nabsolute magnitude of an F3V star and measured reddening is $\\sim454\\pm35$pc.\nBoth estimates agree within $<1\\sigma$, which only excludes some of the most\nextreme theorized scenarios for KIC 8462852. Future Gaia data releases will\ndetermine the distance to within 1% and thus allow for the determination a\nprecise absolute luminosity.\n", "  Taking the Coulomb and proximity potential model for deformed nuclei (CPPMDN)\nas the interacting potential for the post-scission region, the alpha decay\nproperties of 34 isotopes of the superheavy nuclei with Z = 128 within the\nrange 306 $\\leq$ A $\\leq$ 339 have been studied, considering both the parent\nand daughter nuclei to be deformed. The manuscript also deals with the decay\nproperties of the isotopes of Z = 126 (within 288 $\\leq$ A $\\leq$ 339), Z = 124\n(within 284 $\\leq$A $\\leq$ 339) and Z = 122 (within 280 $\\leq$ A $\\leq$ 339).\nThe alpha decay half lives thus evaluated has been compared with the values\nevaluated using other theoretical models and it was seen that, our theoretical\nalpha decay half lives matches well with these values. Through the present\nstudy, we have underlined and have established the fact that, among the 192\nisotopes considered in the present study, only those isotopes\n$^{321-324,328-335}$128, $^{318-320,323-327}$126, $^{305-308,315-322}$124 and\n$^{298-307,311-314}$122 can be synthesized and detected through alpha decay in\nlaboratory. As the alpha decay half lives of these superheavy isotopes lie\nwithin the experimental limits, we hope these predictions, on the decay modes\nof these unknown nuclei, to pave the way for the future experiments. The proton\nseparation energy calculations on $^{306-339}$128, $^{288-336}$126,\n$^{284-339}$124 and $^{280-339}$122 superheavy nuclei have also been done and\nthe study revealed the probable proton emitters among these nuclei.\n", "  Superconducting hybrid junctions are revealing a variety of novel effects.\nSome of them are due to the special layout of these devices, which often use a\ncoplanar configuration with relatively large barrier channels and the\npossibility of hosting Pearl vortices. A Josephson junction with a quasi ideal\ntwo-dimensional barrier has been realized by growing graphene on SiC with Al\nelectrodes. Chemical Vapor Deposition offers centimeter size monolayer areas\nwhere it is possible to realize a comparative analysis of different devices\nwith nominally the same barrier. In samples with a graphene gap below 400 nm,\nwe have found evidence of Josephson coherence in presence of an incipient\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. When the magnetic field is cycled,\na remarkable hysteretic collapse and revival of the Josephson supercurrent\noccurs. Similar hysteresis are found in granular systems and are usually\njustified within the Bean Critical State model (CSM). We show that the CSM,\nwith appropriate account for the low dimensional geometry, can partly explain\nthe odd features measured in these junctions.\n", "  This is a systematic review of the concept of indistinguishability in both\nclassical and quantum mechanics, with particular attention to Gibbs' paradox.\nSection 1 is on the Gibbs paradox; section 2 is a defense of the concept of\nclassical indistinguishability, that addresses (and refutes) the view that\nclassical particles can always be distinguished by their trajectories so are\ndistinguishable. Section 3 is on the notion of object more generally, and on\nwhether indistinguishables should be thought of as objects at all\n", "  Various novel transport phenomena in chiral systems result from the interplay\nof quantum anomalies with magnetic field and vorticity in high-energy heavy-ion\ncollisions, and could survive the expansion of the fireball and be detected in\nexperiments. Among them are the chiral magnetic effect, the chiral vortical\neffect and the chiral magnetic wave, the experimental searches for which have\naroused extensive interest. The goal of this review is to describe the current\nstatus of experimental studies at Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at BNL and\nthe Large Hadron Collider at CERN, and to outline the future work in experiment\nneeded to eliminate the existing uncertainties in the interpretation of the\ndata.\n", "  We ask, and answer, the question of what's computable by Turing machines\nequipped with time travel into the past: that is, closed timelike curves or\nCTCs (with no bound on their size). We focus on a model for CTCs due to\nDeutsch, which imposes a probabilistic consistency condition to avoid\ngrandfather paradoxes. Our main result is that computers with CTCs can solve\nexactly the problems that are Turing-reducible to the halting problem, and that\nthis is true whether we consider classical or quantum computers. Previous work,\nby Aaronson and Watrous, studied CTC computers with a polynomial size\nrestriction, and showed that they solve exactly the problems in PSPACE, again\nin both the classical and quantum cases.\n  Compared to the complexity setting, the main novelty of the computability\nsetting is that not all CTCs have fixed-points, even probabilistically. Despite\nthis, we show that the CTCs that do have fixed-points suffice to solve the\nhalting problem, by considering fixed-point distributions involving infinite\ngeometric series. The tricky part is to show that even quantum computers with\nCTCs can be simulated using a Halt oracle. For that, we need the Riesz\nrepresentation theorem from functional analysis, among other tools.\n  We also study an alternative model of CTCs, due to Lloyd et al., which uses\npostselection to \"simulate\" a consistency condition, and which yields BPP_path\nin the classical case or PP in the quantum case when subject to a polynomial\nsize restriction. With no size limit, we show that postselected CTCs yield only\nthe computable languages if we impose a certain finiteness condition, or all\nlanguages nonadaptively reducible to the halting problem if we don't.\n", "  We consider the spectrum of the discrete Schr\\\"odinger equation with\none-dimensional perturbation. We obtain the explicit form of scattering matrix\nand find the exact condition of absence of singular part of the spectrum. We\ncalculated also the eigenvalue that appears if this condition is not true. In\nthe last part of our paper we give few remarks on the case of two-dimensional\nperturbations.\n", "  Polarized Raman scattering measurements on IrTe$_2$ single crystals carried\nout over 15~K - 640~K temperature range, and across the structural phase\ntransition, reveal new insights regarding the crystal symmetry.\\ In the high\ntemperature regime three Raman active modes are observed at all studied\ntemperatures above the structural phase transition, rather than two as\npredicted by the factor group analysis for the assumed $P\\bar{3}m1$ symmetry.\nThis indicates that the actual symmetry of the high temperature phase is lower\nthan previously thought.\\ Observation of an additional E$_g$ mode at high\ntemperature can be explained by doubling of the original trigonal unit cell\nalong the $c$-axis and within the $P\\bar{3}c1$ symmetry.\\ In the low\ntemperature regime (below 245 K) the new Raman modes appear as a consequence of\nthe symmetry lowering phase transition and corresponding increase of the\nprimitive cell.\\ All the modes observed below the phase transition temperature\ncan be assigned within the monoclinic crystal symmetry.\\ Temperature dependence\nof the Raman active phonons in both phases are mainly driven by anharmonicity\neffects. The results call for reconsideration of the crystallographic phases of\nIrTe$_2$.\n", "  Polarized Raman scattering spectra of superconducting K$_x$Fe$_{2-y}$Se$_2$\nand nonsuperconducting K$_{0.8}$Fe$_{1.8}$Co$_{0.2}$Se$_2$ single crystals were\nmeasured in a temperature range from 10 K up to 300 K. Two Raman active modes\nfrom the $I4/mmm$ phase and seven from the $I4/m$ phase are observed in\nfrequency range from 150 to 325 cm$^{-1}$ in both compounds, suggesting that\nK$_{0.8}$Fe$_{1.8}$Co$_{0.2}$Se$_2$ single crystal also has two-phase nature.\nTemperature dependence of Raman mode energy is analyzed in terms of lattice\nthermal expansion and phonon-phonon interaction. Temperature dependence of\nRaman mode linewidth is dominated by temperature-induced anharmonic effects. It\nis shown that change of Raman mode energy with temperature is dominantly driven\nby thermal expansion of the crystal lattice. Abrupt change of the A$_{1g}$ mode\nenergy near $T_C$ was observed in K$_x$Fe$_{2-y}$Se$_2$, whereas it is absent\nin non-superconducting K$_{0.8}$Fe$_{1.8}$Co$_{0.2}$Se$_2$. Phonon energy\nhardening at low temperatures in the superconducting sample is a consequence of\nsuperconductivity-induced redistribution of the electronic states below\ncritical temperature.\n", "  We report the first principle calculations of the lattice dynamics of\nKNi$_{2}$Se$_2$ together with the Raman scattering study.\\ We have observed\nthree out of four Raman active modes predicted by the factor group analysis.\nCalculated phonon frequencies are in good agreement with experimental\nfindings.\\ Contrary to its iron counterpart (K$_x$Fe$_{2-y}$Se$_2$),\nK$_{0.95}$Ni$_{1.86}$Se$_2$ does not show vacancy ordering.\n", "  We clarify the relationship between different multiple polylogarithms in\nweight~4 by writing suitable linear combinations of a given type of iterated\nintegral I_{n_1,...,n_d}(z_1,...,z_d), in depth d>1 and weight \\sum_i n_i=4 in\nterms of the classical tetralogarithm Li_4. In the process, we prove a\nstatement conjectured by Goncharov which can be rephrased as writing the sum of\niterated integrals I_{3,1}(V(x,y),z), where V(x,y) denotes a formal version of\nthe five term relation for the dilogarithm, in terms of Li_4-terms (we need 122\nsuch).\n", "  The paper is concerned with interacting particle systems on the simple cubic\nlattice obeying the nearest neighbour exclusion (NNE). This constraint forbids\nany two neighbouring sites of the lattice to be simultaneously occupied, thus\nreducing the set of admissible configurations for the cubic cell and its\nsubclusters such as edges and faces. This reduction extends applicability of\nKikuchi's Cluster Variation Method (CVM) with higher-order clusters to systems\nwith complex site configurations and short-range ordering, which would be\nimpractical beyond the NNE framework because of the \"curse of dimensionality\".\nFor edges of the cubic cell, which are the operational clusters of the\nBethe-Peierls entropy approximation in the CVM hierarchy, the edge-to-site\nreduction of the entropy cumulants was studied previously. In extending the\nearlier results, we develop a face-to-diagonal reduction of the Kramers-Wannier\nentropy approximation of the CVM in the NNE setting. We also outline an\napplication of the resulting approximation to thermodynamic modeling of\ndisordered condensed media, such as liquid silicates, and discuss combinatorial\nand numerical aspects of the implementation of this approach.\n", "  The alkali-adsorbed graphene nanoribbons exhibit the feature-rich electronic\nand magnetic properties. From the first-principles calculations, there are only\nfew adatom-dominated conduction bands, and the other conduction and valence\nbands are caused by carbon atoms. A lot of free electrons are revealed in the\noccupied alkali- and carbon-dependent conduction bands. Energy bands are\nsensitive to the concentration, distribution and kind of adatom and the edge\nstructure, while the total linear free carrier density only relies on the first\none. These mainly arise from a single $s-2p_z$ orbital hybridization in the\nadatom-carbon bond. Specifically, zigzag systems can present the\nanti-ferromagnetic ordering across two edges, ferromagnetic ordering along one\nedge and non-magnetism, being reflected in the edge-localized energy bands with\nor without spin splitting. The diverse energy dispersions contribute many\nspecial peaks in density of states. The critical chemical bonding and the\ndistinct spin configuration could be verified from the experimental\nmeasurements.\n", "  An explicit time-domain finite-difference technique for modelling\nzero-thickness Huygens' metasurfaces based on Generalized Sheet Transition\nConditions (GSTCs), is proposed and demonstrated using full-wave simulations.\nThe Huygens' metasurface is modelled using electric and magnetic surface\nsusceptibilities, which are found to follow a double-Lorentz dispersion\nprofile. To solve zero-thickness Huygens' metasurface problems for general\nbroadband excitations, the double-Lorentz dispersion profile is combined with\nGSTCs, leading to a set of first-order differential fields equations in\ntime-domain. Identifying the exact equivalence between Huygens' metasurfaces\nand coupled RLC oscillator circuits, the field equations are then subsequently\nsolved using standard circuit modelling techniques based on a finite-difference\nformulation. Several examples including generalized refraction are shown to\nillustrate the temporal evolution of scattered fields from the Huygens'\nmetasurface under plane-wave normal incidence, in both harmonic steady-state\nand broadband regimes. In particular, due to its inherent time-domain\nformulation, a significant strength of the methodology is its ability to model\ntime-varying metasurfaces, which is demonstrated with a simple example of a\npumped metasurface leading to new frequency generation and wave amplification.\n", "  We explore the small-time behavior of solutions to the Yang-Mills heat\nequation with rough initial data. We consider solutions $A(t)$ with initial\nvalue $A_0\\in H_{1/2}(M)$, where $M$ is a bounded convex region in\n$\\mathbb{R}^3$ or all of $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The behavior, as $t\\downarrow 0$, of\nthe $L^p(M)$ norms of the time derivatives of $A(t)$ and its curvature $B(t)$\nwill be determined for $p=2$ and $6$, along with the $H_1(M)$ norm of these\nderivatives.\n", "  A comparative study is being reported on the identification of heavy carbon\nclusters using two different techniques namely the Direct Recoil Spectroscopy\n(DRS) and velocity spectrometry using a Wien ExB velocity filter. In both the\ntechniques carbon clusters are formed in situ either under energetic heavy ion\nbombardment of graphite surfaces for which DRS is employed or these are emitted\nfrom the regenerative sooting discharges and analyzed using ExB velocity\nanalysis.\n", "  In this paper, we consider the Cauchy problem for the relativistic Boltzmann\nequation with near vacuum initial data where the distribution function depends\non the time, the position and the impulsion. The collision kernel considered\nhere is for the hard potentials case and the background space-time in which the\nstudy is done is the Robertson-Walker space-time. Unique global (in time) mild\nsolution is obtained in a suitable weighted space.\n", "  Suspended monolayer transition metal-dichalcogenides (TMD) are membranes that\ncombine ultra-low mass and exceptional optical properties, making them\nintriguing materials for opto-mechanical applications. However, the low\nmeasured quality factor of TMD resonators has been a roadblock so far. Here, we\nreport an ultrasensitive optical readout of monolayer TMD resonators that\nallows us to reveal their mechanical properties at cryogenic temperatures. We\nfind that the quality factor of monolayer WSe2 resonators greatly increases\nbelow room temperature, reaching values as high as 1.6E^4 at liquid nitrogen\ntemperature and 4.7E^4 at liquid helium temperature. This surpasses the quality\nfactor of monolayer graphene resonators with similar surface areas. Upon\ncooling the resonator, the resonant frequency increases significantly due to\nthe thermal contraction of the WSe2 lattice. These measurements allow us to\nexperimentally study the thermal expansion coefficient of WSe2 monolayers for\nthe first time. High Q-factors are also found in resonators based on MoS2 and\nMoSe2 monolayers. The high quality-factor found in this work opens new\npossibilities for coupling mechanical vibrational states to two-dimensional\nexcitons, valley pseudospins, and single quantum emitters, and for quantum\nopto-mechanical experiments based on the Casimir interaction.\n", "  Although cooperation is central to the organisation of many social systems,\nrelatively little is known about cooperation in situations of collective\nemergency. When groups of people flee from a danger such as a burning building\nor a terrorist attack, the collective benefit of cooperation is important, but\nthe cost of helping is high and the temptation to defect is strong. To explore\nthe degree of cooperation in emergencies, we develop a new social game, the\nhelp-or-escape social dilemma. Under time and monetary pressure, players decide\nhow much risk they are willing to take in order to help others. Results\nindicated that players took as much risk to help others during emergencies as\nthey did under normal conditions. In both conditions, most players applied an\negalitarian heuristic and helped others until their chance of success equalled\nthat of the group. This strategy is less efficient during emergencies, however,\nbecause the increased time pressure results in fewer people helped.\nFurthermore, emergencies tend to amplify participants initial tendency to\ncooperate, with prosocials becoming even more cooperative and individualists\nbecoming even more selfish. Our framework offers new opportunities to study\nhuman cooperation and could help authorities to better manage crowd behaviours\nduring mass emergencies.\n", "  The photoproduction of $\\pi^0$-mesons from the nucleon and deuteron has been\nstudied for incidents of photon energies up to 1.5 GeV. By using the MAID-2007\nmodel for the process on the nucleon, we predict results for the unpolarized\nand helicity-dependent total cross sections of the semi-exclusive reaction\n$\\gamma d\\rightarrow\\pi^0X$ ($X=np+d$) with the inclusion of rescattering\neffects. We find that rescattering effects yield a substantially large\ncontribution. The extracted results are compared with the available\nexperimental data and a satisfactory agreement is obtained. In addition, the\ncontribution of $\\gamma d\\rightarrow\\pi^0X$ ($X=np+d$) to the finite GDH\nintegral has been evaluated by explicit integration up to 1.5 GeV and a total\nvalue of 256.96 $\\mu$b has been obtained. Convergence of the GDH integral has\nbeen reached.\n", "  The ultrathin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have emerged as\npromising materials for various applications using two dimensional (2D)\nsemiconductors. They have attracted increasing attention due to their unique\noptical properties originate from neutral and charged excitons. Here, we report\nnegatively charged exciton formation in monolayer TMDs, notably tungsten\ndisulfide WS2. Our theory is based on an effective mass model of neutral and\ncharged excitons, parameterized by ab-initio calculations. Taking into the\naccount the strong correlation between the monolayer WS2 and the surrounding\ndielectric environment, our theoretical results are in good agreement with\none-photon photoluminescence (PL) and reflectivity measurements. We also show\nthat the exciton state with p-symmetry, experimentally observed by two-photon\nPL emission, is energetically below the 2s-state. We use the equilibrium mass\naction law, to quantify the relative weight of exciton and trion PL. We show\nthat exciton and trion emission can be tuned and controlled by external\nparameters like temperature, pumping and injection electrons. Finally, in\ncomparison with experimental measurements, we show that exciton emission in\nmonolayer tungsten dichalcogenides is substantially reduced. This feature\nsuggests that free exciton can be trapped in disordered potential wells to form\na localized exciton and therefore offers a route toward novel optical\nproperties.\n", "  Phosphorene, a new two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor, has received much\ninterest due to its robust direct band gap and high charge mobility. Currently,\nhowever, phosphorene can only be produced by mechanical or liquid exfoliation,\nand it is still a significant challenge to directly epitaxially grow\nphosphorene, which greatly hinders its mass production and, thus, applications.\nIn epitaxial growth, the stability of nanoscale cluster or flake on a substrate\nis crucial. Here, we perform ab initio energy optimizations and molecular\ndynamics simulations to explore the critical role of substrate on the stability\nof a representative phosphorene flake. Our calculations show that the stability\nof the phosphorene nanoflake is strongly dependent on the interaction strength\nbetween the nanoflake and substrate. Specifically, the strong interaction (0.75\neV/P atom) with Cu(111) substrate breaks up the phosphorene nanoflake, while\nthe weak interaction (0.063 eV/P atom) with h-BN substrate fails to stabilize\nits 2D structure. Remarkably, we find that a substrate with a moderate\ninteraction (about 0.35 eV/P atom) is able to stabilize the 2D characteristics\nof the nanoflake on a realistic time scale. Our findings here provide useful\nguidelines for searching suitable substrates for the directly epitaxial growth\nof phosphorene.\n", "  We derive the explicit analytical form of the time-dependent coupling\nparameter to an external field for perfect absorption of traveling single\nphoton fields with arbitrary temporal profiles by a tunable single input-output\nopen quantum system, which can be realized as either a single qubit or single\nresonator system. However, the time-dependent coupling parameter for perfect\nabsorption has a singularity at $t=0$ and constraints on real systems prohibit\na faithful physical realization of the perfect absorber. A numerical example is\nincluded to illustrate the absorber's performance under practical limitations\non the coupling strength.\n", "  We report on fabrication of three dimensional (3D) microstructures in glass\nwith isotropic spatial resolutions. To achieve high throughput fabrication, we\nexpand the focal spot size with a low-numerical-aperture lens, which naturally\nresults in a degraded axial resolution. We solve the problem with simultaneous\nspatial temporal focusing which leads to an isotropic laser-affected volume\nwith a spatial resolution of ~100 micron.\n", "  The mini-proceedings of the 18$^{\\mathrm{th}}$ Meeting of the \"Working Group\non Radiative Corrections and MonteCarlo Generators for Low Energies\" held in\nFrascati, 19$^{\\mathrm{th}}$ - 20$^{\\mathrm{st}}$ May, are presented. These\nmeetings, started in 2006, have as aim to bring together experimentalists and\ntheoreticians working in the fields of meson transition form factors, hadronic\ncontributions to the anomalous magnetic moment of the leptons, and the\neffective fine structure constant. The development of MonteCarlo generators and\nRadiative Corrections for precision $e^+e^-$ and $\\tau$-lepton physics are also\ncovered, with emphasis on meson production. At this workshop, a documentary\nentitled {\\it Bruno Touschek with AdA in Orsay} commemorating the first\nobservation of electron-positron collisions in a laboratory was also presented.\nWith this edition, the working group reaches 10 years of continuous activities.\n", "  RW Aur is a young binary star that experienced a deep dimming in 2010-11 in\ncomponent A and a second even deeper dimming from summer 2014 to summer 2016.\nWe present new unresolved multi-band photometry during the 2014-16 eclipse, new\nemission line spectroscopy before and during the dimming, archive infrared\nphotometry between 2014-15, as well as an overview of literature data.\n  Spectral observations were carried out with the Fibre-fed RObotic Dual-beam\nOptical Spectrograph on the Liverpool Telescope. Photometric monitoring was\ndone with the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network and James\nGregory Telescope. Our photometry shows that RW Aur dropped in brightness to R\n= 12.5 in March 2016. In addition to the long-term dimming trend, RW Aur is\nvariable on time scales as short as hours. The short-term variation is most\nlikely due to an unstable accretion flow. This, combined with the presence of\naccretion-related emission lines in the spectra suggest that accretion flows in\nthe binary system are at least partially visible during the eclipse.\n  The equivalent width of [O I] increases by a factor of ten in 2014,\ncoinciding with the dimming event, confirming previous reports. The\nblue-shifted part of the $H\\alpha$ profile is suppressed during the eclipse. In\ncombination with the increase in mid-infrared brightness during the eclipse\nreported in the literature and seen in WISE archival data, and constraints on\nthe geometry of the disk around RW Aur A we arrive at the conclusion that the\nobscuring screen is part of a wind emanating from the inner disk.\n", "  Anderson proposed structural topology in frustrated magnets hosting novel\nquantum spin liquids (QSLs). The QSL state is indeed exactly derived by\nfractionalizing the spin excitation into spinless Majorana fermions in a\nperfect two dimensional (2D) honeycomb lattice, the so-called Kitaev lattice,\nand its experimental realisation is eagerly being pursued. Here we, for the\nfirst time, report the Kitaev lattice stacking with van der Waals (vdW) bonding\nin a high quality {\\alpha}-RuCl$_3$ crystal using x-ray and neutron\ndiffractions. Even in absence of apparent monoclinic distortion, the system\nexhibits antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering below 6.5 K, likely due to minute\nmagnetic interaction from trigonal distortion and/or interlayer coupling\nadditionally to the Kitaev Hamiltonian. We also demonstrate 2D Ising-like\ncritical behaviors near the N\\'eel temperature in the order parameter and\nspecific heat, capturing the characteristics of short-range spin-spin\ncorrelations underlying the Kitaev model. Our findings hold promise for\nunveiling enigmatic physics emerging from the Kitaev QSL.\n", "  Weak emission-line active galactic nuclei (WLAGNs) are radio-quiet active\ngalactic nuclei (AGNs) that have nearly featureless optical spectra. We\ninvestigate the ultraviolet to mid-infrared spectral energy distributions of 73\nWLAGNs (0.4<z<3) and find that most of them are similar to normal AGNs. We also\ncalculate the covering factor of warm dust of these 73 WLAGNs. No significant\ndifference is indicated by a KS test between the covering factor of WLAGNs and\nnormal AGNs in the common range of bolometric luminosity. The implication for\nseveral models of WLAGNs is discussed. The super-Eddington accretion is\nunlikely the dominant reason for the featureless spectrum of a WLAGN. The\npresent results favor the evolution scenario, i.e., WLAGNs are in a special\nstage of AGNs.\n", "  This paper proposes a comparison between rectilinear and radio-concentric\nnetworks. Indeed, those networks are often observed in urban areas, in several\ncities all over the world. One of the interesting properties of such networks\nis described by the \\textit{straightness} measure from graph theory, which\nassesses how much moving from one node to another along the network links\ndeparts from the network-independent straightforward path. We study this\nproperty in both rectilinear and radio-concentric networks, first by analyzing\nmathematically routes from the center to peripheral locations in a theoretical\nframework with perfect topology, then using simulations for multiple\norigin-destination paths. We show that in most of the cases, radio-concentric\nnetworks have a better straightness than rectilinear ones. How may this\nproperty be used in the future for urban networks?\n", "  $G_2$-monopoles are solutions to gauge theoretical equations on\n$G_2$-manifolds. If the $G_2$-manifolds under consideration are compact, then\nany irreducible $G_2$-monopole must have singularities. It is then important to\nunderstand which kind of singularities $G_2$-monopoles can have. We give\nexamples (in the noncompact case) of non-Abelian monopoles with Dirac type\nsingularities, and examples of monopoles whose singularities are not of that\ntype. We also give an existence result for Abelian monopoles with Dirac type\nsingularities on compact manifolds. This should be one of the building blocks\nin a gluing construction aimed at constructing non-Abelian ones.\n", "  By means of extensive simulations, we investigate concentrated solutions of\nglobular single-chain nanoparticles (SCNPs), an emergent class of synthetic\nsoft nano-objects. By increasing the concentration, the SCNPs show a reentrant\nbehaviour in their structural and dynamical correlations, as well as a soft\ncaging regime and weak dynamic heterogeneity. The latter is confirmed by\nvalidation of the Stokes-Einstein relation up to concentrations far beyond the\noverlap density. Therefore SCNPs arise as a new class of soft colloids,\nexhibiting slow dynamics and actualizing in a real system structural and\ndynamical anomalies proposed by models of ultrasoft particles. Quantitative\ndifferences in the dynamical behaviour depend on the SCNP deformability, which\ncan be tuned through the degree of internal cross-linking.\n", "  A new theoretical technique for understanding, analyzing and developing\noptical systems is presented. The approach is statistical in nature, where\ninformation about an object under investigation is discovered, by examining\ndeviations from a known reference statistical distribution. A Fourier optics\nframework and a scalar description of the propagation of monochromatic light is\ninitially assumed. An object (belonging to a known class of objects) is\nilluminated with a speckle field and the intensity of the resulting scattered\noptical field is detected at a series of spatial locations by point square law\ndetectors. A new speckle field is generated (with a new diffuser) and the\nobject is again illuminated and the intensities are again measured and noted.\nBy making a large number of these statistical measurements - an ensemble\naveraging process (which in general can be a temporal or a spatial averaging\nprocess) - it is possible to determine the statistical relationship between the\nintensities detected in different locations with a known statistical certainty.\nIt is shown how this physical property of the optical system can be used to\nidentify different classes of objects (discrete objects or objects that vary\ncontinuously as a function of several physical parameters) with a specific\nstatistical certainty. The derived statistical relationship is a fourth order\nstatistical process and is related to the mutual intensity of scattered light.\nA connection between the integration time of the intensity detectors and\ntemporal coherence and hence temporal bandwidth of a quasi-monochromatic light\nsource is discussed. We extend these results to multiple wavelengths and\npolarizations of light. We briefly discuss how the results may be extended to\nnon-paraxial optical systems.\n", "  Many large, real-world complex networks have rich community structure that a\nnetwork scientist seeks to understand. These communities may overlap or have\nintricate internal structure. Extracting communities with particular\ntopological structure, even when they overlap with other communities, is a\npowerful capability that would provide novel avenues of focusing in on\nstructure of interest. In this work we consider extracting highly-cyclic\nregions of directed graphs (digraphs). We demonstrate that embeddings derived\nfrom complex-valued eigenvectors associated with stochastic propagator\neigenvalues near roots of unity are well-suited for this purpose. We prove\nseveral fundamental theoretic results demonstrating the connection between\nthese eigenpairs and the presence of highly-cyclic structure and we demonstrate\nthe use of these vectors on a few real-world examples.\n", "  QCD at zero baryon density in the limit of infinite quark mass undergoes a\nfirst order deconfinement phase transition at a critical temperature $T_c$\ncorresponding to the breaking of the global centre symmetry. In the presence of\ndynamical quarks this symmetry is explicitly broken. Lowering the quark mass\nthe first order phase transition weakens and terminates in a second order Z(2)\npoint. Beyond this line confined and deconfined regions are analytically\nconnected by a crossover transition. As the continuum limit is approached (i.e.\nthe lattice spacing is decreased) the region of first order transitions expands\ntowards lower masses. We study the deconfinement critical point with standard\nWilson fermions and $N_f=2$ flavours. To this end we simulate several kappa\nvalues on $N_\\tau=8$ and various aspect ratios in order to extrapolate to the\nthermodynamic limit, applying finite size scaling. We estimate if and when a\ncontinuuum extrapolation is possible.\n", "  Student learning in undergraduate physics laboratory courses has garnered\nincreased attention within the PER community. Considerable work has been done\nto develop curricular materials and pedagogical techniques designed to enhance\nstudent learning within laboratory learning environments. Examples of these\ntransformation efforts include the Investigative Science Learning Environment\n(ISLE), Modeling Instruction, and integrated lab/lecture environments (e.g.,\nstudio physics). In addition to improving students' understanding of the\nphysics content, lab courses often have an implicit or explicit goal of\nincreasing students' understanding and appreciation of the nature of\nexperimental physics. We examine students' responses to a laboratory-focused\nepistemological assessment -- the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science\nSurvey for Experimental Physics (E-CLASS) -- to explore whether courses using\ntransformed curricula or pedagogy show more expert-like student epistemologies\nrelative to courses using traditional guided labs, as well as how this trend\nvaries based on student major or gender. Data for this study are drawn from an\nexisting data set of responses to the E-CLASS from multiple courses and\ninstitutions.\n", "  We present a simple yet elegant Mueller matrix approach for controlling the\nFano interference effect and engineering the resulting asymmetric spectral line\nshape in anisotropic optical system. The approach is founded on a generalized\nmodel of anisotropic Fano resonance, which relates the spectral asymmetry to\ntwo physically meaningful and experimentally accessible parameters of\ninterference, namely, the Fano phase shift and the relative amplitudes of the\ninterfering modes. The differences in these parameters between orthogonal\nlinear polarizations in an anisotropic system are exploited to desirably tune\nthe Fano spectral asymmetry using pre- and post-selection of optimized\npolarization states. Experimental control on the Fano phase and the relative\namplitude parameters and resulting tuning of spectral asymmetry is demonstrated\nin waveguided plasmonic crystals using Mueller matrix-based polarization\nanalysis. The approach enabled tailoring of several exotic regimes of Fano\nresonance including the complete reversal of the spectral asymmetry. The\ndemonstrated control and the ensuing large tunability of Fano resonance in\nanisotropic systems shows potential for Fano resonance-based applications\ninvolving control and manipulation of electromagnetic waves at the nano scale.\n", "  Correlation functions in quantum field theory are calculated using Feynman\namplitudes, which are finite dimensional integrals associated to graphs. The\nintegrand is the exponential of the ratio of the first and second Symanzik\npolynomials associated to the Feynman graph, which are described in terms of\nthe spanning trees and spanning 2-forests of the graph, respectively.\n  In a previous paper with Bloch, Burgos and Fres\\'an, we related this ratio to\nthe asymptotic of the Archimedean height pairing between degree zero divisors\non degenerating families of Riemann surfaces. Motivated by this, we consider in\nthis paper the variation of the ratio of the two Symanzik polynomials under\nbounded perturbations of the geometry of the graph. This is a natural problem\nin connection with the theory of nilpotent and SL2 orbits in Hodge theory.\n  Our main result is the boundedness of variation of the ratio. For this we\ndefine the exchange graph of a given graph which encodes the exchange\nproperties between spanning trees and spanning 2-forests in the graph. We\nprovide a description of the connected components of this graph, and use this\nto prove our result on boundedness of the variations.\n", "  We explore a technique for decelerating molecules using a static magnetic\nfield and optical pumping. Molecules travel through a spatially varying\nmagnetic field and are repeatedly pumped into a weak-field seeking state as\nthey move towards each strong field region, and into a strong-field seeking\nstate as they move towards weak field. The method is time-independent and so is\nsuitable for decelerating both pulsed and continuous molecular beams. By using\nguiding magnets at each weak field region, the beam can be simultaneously\nguided and decelerated. By tapering the magnetic field strength in the strong\nfield regions, and exploiting the Doppler shift, the velocity distribution can\nbe compressed during deceleration. We develop the principles of this\ndeceleration technique, provide a realistic design, use numerical simulations\nto evaluate its performance for a beam of CaF, and compare this performance to\nother deceleration methods.\n", "  We combine first-principles calculations and Boltzmann transport theory to\nstudy the electrical transport properties of intermetallic compound YbAl3. To\naccurately predict the electronic relaxation time, we use the density\nfunctional perturbation theory and Wannier interpolation techniques which can\neffectively treat the electron-phonon scattering. Our calculated transport\ncoefficients of YbAl3 are in reasonable agreement with the experimentally\nmeasured results. Strikingly, we discover that in evaluating the Seebeck\ncoefficient of YbAl3, the scattering term has a larger contribution than the\nband term and should be explicitly considered in the calculations, especially\nfor the case with localized bands near the Fermi level. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate that by reducing the sample size to less than ~30 nm, the\nelectronic thermal conductivity of YbAl3 can be sufficiently suppressed so that\nthe thermoelectric figure of merit can be further enhanced.\n", "  We describe both the Hodge - de Rham and the spin manifold Dirac operator on\nthe spheres ${\\rm S}^3$ and ${\\rm S}^2$, following the formalism introduced by\nK\\\"ahler, and exhibit a complete spectral resolution for them in terms of\nsuitably globally defined eigenspinors.\n", "  In computational materials science, predicting the yield strain of\ncrosslinked polymers remains a challenging task. A common approach is to\nidentify yield as the first critical point of stress-strain curves simulated by\nmolecular dynamics (MD). However, in such cases the underlying data can be\nexcessively noisy, making it difficult to extract meaningful results. In this\nwork, we propose an alternate method for identifying yield on the basis of\ndeformation-recovery simulations. Notably, the corresponding raw data (i.e.\nresidual strains) produce a sharper signal for yield via a transition in their\nglobal behavior. We analyze this transition by non- linear regression of\ncomputational data to a hyperbolic model. As part of this analysis, we also\npropose uncertainty quantification techniques for assessing when and to what\nextent the simulated data is informative of yield. Moreover, we show how the\nmethod directly tests for yield via the onset of permanent deformation and\ndiscuss recent experimental results, which compare favorably with our\npredictions.\n", "  The extrema of the probabilities of the transitions $\\nu_{\\mu} (\\nu_e) \\to\n\\nu_e (\\nu_{\\mu;\\tau})$, $\\nu_{2} \\to \\nu_e$, etc. of neutrinos passing through\na medium consisting of i) two layers of different constant densities or ii)\nthree layers of constant density, of which the first and the third are\nidentical but differ in density from the second (e.g., mantle-core-mantle in\nthe Earth), are analyzed. We show that in addition to the MSW and neutrino\noscillation length resonance (NOLR) local maxima previously discussed, there\nexist new resonance-like absolute maxima of interference nature. The latter\ncorrespond to a new effect of total neutrino conversion. The conditions for\nexistence of the new maxima are fulfilled, in particular, for the\nEarth-core-crossing solar and atmospheric neutrinos. We prove that the NOLR and\nthe new resonance-like enhancement are caused by a maximal constructive\ninterference between the amplitudes of the neutrino transitions in the\ndifferent density layers. The strong resonance-like enhancement of the\ntransitions in the Earth of the Earth-core-crossing solar and atmospheric\nneutrinos is due to the new effect of total neutrino conversion.\n", "  Photoionization cross section of the fullerene ion C60+ has been calculated\nwithin a single-electron approximation and also by using a consistent many-body\ntheory accounting for many-electron correlations.\n"]}
