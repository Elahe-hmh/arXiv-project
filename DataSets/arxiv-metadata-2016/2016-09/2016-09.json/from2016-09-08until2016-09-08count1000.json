We study numerically the cascading failure problem by using artificially\ncreated scale-free networks and the real network structure of the power grid.\nThe capacity for a vertex is assigned as a monotonically increasing function of\nthe load (or the betweenness centrality). Through the use of a simple\nfunctional form with two free parameters, revealed is that it is indeed\npossible to make networks more robust while spending less cost. We suggest that\nour method to prevent cascade by protecting less vertices is particularly\nimportant for the design of more robust real-world networks to cascading\nfailures.\n", "  We apply mirror symmetry to the problem of counting holomorphic rational\ncurves in a Calabi-Yau threefold X with Z_3 x Z_3 Wilson lines. As we found in\nPart A [hep-th/0703182], the integral homology group H_2(X,Z)=Z^3 + Z_3 + Z_3\ncontains torsion curves. Using the B-model on the mirror of X as well as its\ncovering spaces, we compute the instanton numbers. We observe that X is\nself-mirror even at the quantum level. Using the self-mirror property, we\nderive the complete prepotential on X, going beyond the results of Part A. In\nparticular, this yields the first example where the instanton number depends on\nthe torsion part of its homology class. Another consequence is that the\nthreefold X provides a non-toric example for the conjectured exchange of\ntorsion subgroups in mirror manifolds.\n", "  Low-order equal-time statistics of a barotropic flow on a rotating sphere are\ninvestigated. The flow is driven by linear relaxation toward an unstable zonal\njet. For relatively short relaxation times, the flow is dominated by\ncritical-layer waves. For sufficiently long relaxation times, the flow is\nturbulent. Statistics obtained from a second-order cumulant expansion are\ncompared to those accumulated in direct numerical simulations, revealing the\nstrengths and limitations of the expansion for different relaxation times.\n", "  We consider exact and quasi-exact solvability of the one-dimensional\nFokker-Planck equation based on the connection between the Fokker-Planck\nequation and the Schr\\\"odinger equation. A unified consideration of these two\ntypes of solvability is given from the viewpoint of prepotential together with\nBethe ansatz equations. Quasi-exactly solvable Fokker-Planck equations related\nto the $sl(2)$-based systems in Turbiner's classification are listed. We also\npresent one $sl(2)$-based example which is not listed in Turbiner's scheme.\n", "  An implicit numerical algorithm general relativistic hydrodynamics This\narticle has been replaced by arXiv:0801.1017\n", "  The resonant state of the open quantum system is studied from the viewpoint\nof the outgoing momentum flux. We show that the number of particles is\nconserved for a resonant state, if we use an expanding volume of integration in\norder to take account of the outgoing momentum flux; the number of particles\nwould decay exponentially in a fixed volume of integration. Moreover, we\nintroduce new numerical methods of treating the resonant state with the use of\nthe effective potential. We first give a numerical method of finding a\nresonance pole in the complex energy plane. The method seeks an energy\neigenvalue iteratively. We found that our method leads to a super-convergence,\nthe convergence exponential with respect to the iteration step. The present\nmethod is completely independent of commonly used complex scaling. We also give\na numerical trick for computing the time evolution of the resonant state in a\nlimited spatial area. Since the wave function of the resonant state is\ndiverging away from the scattering potential, it has been previously difficult\nto follow its time evolution numerically in a finite area.\n", "  We describe in detail the history of Brownian motion, as well as the\ncontributions of Einstein, Sutherland, Smoluchowski, Bachelier, Perrin and\nLangevin to its theory. The always topical importance in physics of the theory\nof Brownian motion is illustrated by recent biophysical experiments, where it\nserves, for instance, for the measurement of the pulling force on a single DNA\nmolecule.\n  In a second part, we stress the mathematical importance of the theory of\nBrownian motion, illustrated by two chosen examples. The by-now classic\nrepresentation of the Newtonian potential by Brownian motion is explained in an\nelementary way. We conclude with the description of recent progress seen in the\ngeometry of the planar Brownian curve. At its heart lie the concepts of\nconformal invariance and multifractality, associated with the potential theory\nof the Brownian curve itself.\n", "  We introduce a rotation invariant short distance cut-off in the theory of an\nideal fluid in three space dimensions, by requiring momenta to take values in a\nsphere. This leads to an algebra of functions in position space is\nnon-commutative. Nevertheless it is possible to find appropriate analogues of\nthe Euler equations of an ideal fluid. The system still has a hamiltonian\nstructure. It is hoped that this will be useful in the study of possible\nsingularities in the evolution of Euler (or Navier-Stokes) equations in three\ndimensions.\n", "  This is the second paper of a series of three investigating, by numerical\nmeans, the geometric and mechanical properties of spherical bead packings under\nisotropic stresses. We study the effects of varying the applied pressure P\n(from 1 or 10 kPa up to 100 MPa in the case of glass beads) on several types of\nconfigurations assembled by different procedures, as reported in the preceding\npaper. As functions of P, we monitor changes in solid fraction \\Phi,\ncoordination number z, proportion of rattlers (grains carrying no force) x0,\nthe distribution of normal forces, the level of friction mobilization, and the\ndistribution of near neighbor distances. Assuming the contact law does not\ninvolve material plasticity or damage, \\Phi is found to vary very nearly\nreversibly with P in an isotropic compression cycle, but all other quantities,\ndue to the frictional hysteresis of contact forces, change irreversibly. In\nparticular, initial low P states with high coordination numbers lose many\ncontacts in a compression cycle, and end up with values of z and x0 close to\nthose of the most poorly coordinated initial configurations. Proportional load\nvariations which do not entail notable configuration changes can therefore\nnevertheless significantly affect contact networks of granular packings in\nquasistatic conditions.\n", "  In this third and final paper of a series, elastic properties of numerically\nsimulated isotropic packings of spherical beads assembled by different\nprocedures and subjected to a varying confining pressure P are investigated. In\naddition P, which determines the stiffness of contacts by Hertz's law, elastic\nmoduli are chiefly sensitive to the coordination number, the possible values of\nwhich are not necessarily correlated with the density. Comparisons of numerical\nand experimental results for glass beads in the 10kPa-10MPa range reveal\nsimilar differences between dry samples compacted by vibrations and lubricated\npackings. The greater stiffness of the latter, in spite of their lower density,\ncan hence be attributed to a larger coordination number. Voigt and Reuss bounds\nbracket bulk modulus B accurately, but simple estimation schemes fail for shear\nmodulus G, especially in poorly coordinated configurations under low P.\nTenuous, fragile networks respond differently to changes in load direction, as\ncompared to load intensity. The shear modulus, in poorly coordinated packings,\ntends to vary proportionally to the degree of force indeterminacy per unit\nvolume. The elastic range extends to small strain intervals, in agreement with\nexperimental observations. The origins of nonelastic response are discussed. We\nconclude that elastic moduli provide access to mechanically important\ninformation about coordination numbers, which escape direct measurement\ntechniques, and indicate further perspectives.\n", "  This paper introduces simple analytical formulas for the grid impedance of\nelectrically dense arrays of square patches and for the surface impedance of\nhigh-impedance surfaces based on the dense arrays of metal strips or square\npatches over ground planes. Emphasis is on the oblique-incidence excitation.\nThe approach is based on the known analytical models for strip grids combined\nwith the approximate Babinet principle for planar grids located at a dielectric\ninterface. Analytical expressions for the surface impedance and reflection\ncoefficient resulting from our analysis are thoroughly verified by full-wave\nsimulations and compared with available data in open literature for particular\ncases. The results can be used in the design of various antennas and microwave\nor millimeter wave devices which use artificial impedance surfaces and\nartificial magnetic conductors (reflect-array antennas, tunable phase shifters,\netc.), as well as for the derivation of accurate higher-order impedance\nboundary conditions for artificial (high-) impedance surfaces. As an example,\nthe propagation properties of surface waves along the high-impedance surfaces\nare studied.\n", "  We investigate the tunnelling zone V0 < E < V0+m for a one-dimensional\npotential within the Dirac equation. We find the appearance of superluminal\ntransit times akin to the Hartman effect.\n", "  Liesegang patterns emerge from precipitation processes and may be used to\nbuild bulk structures at submicron lengthscales. Thus they have significant\npotential for technological applications provided adequate methods of control\ncan be devised. Here we describe a simple, physically realizable\npattern-control based on the notion of driven precipitation, meaning that the\nphase-separation is governed by a guiding field such as, for example, a\ntemperature or a pH field. The phase-separation is modeled through a\nnon-autonomous Cahn-Hilliard equation whose spinodal is determined by the\nevolving guiding field. Control over the dynamics of the spinodal gives control\nover the velocity of the instability front which separates the stable and\nunstable regions of the system. Since the wavelength of the pattern is largely\ndetermined by this velocity, the distance between successive precipitation\nbands becomes controllable. We demonstrate the above ideas by numerical studies\nof a 1D system with diffusive guiding field. We find that the results can be\naccurately described by employing a linear stability analysis (pulled-front\ntheory) for determining the velocity -- local-wavelength relationship. From the\nperspective of the Liesegang theory, our results indicate that the so-called\nrevert patterns may be naturally generated by diffusive guiding fields.\n", "  The pole of the two-particle T-matrix including the influence of the\nsurrounding medium is analyzed for an interacting Bose gas. The phase diagram\nof the Bose -Einstein condensation (BEC) depending on the temperature, density,\nscattering length, and momentum is derived from this pole. The critical\nmomentum for the occurrence of superfluidity is obtained in this way. As a new\nobservation a two- particle binding energy is reported intimately connected\nwith the occurrence of the BEC. It is suggested that this might have\ncosmological consequences on the dark energy problem.\n", "  Nonlinear dynamics and pattern formation in the systems with quadratic\nnonlinearity is computed symbolically by specially developed MATHEMATICA\npackage. A Web interface for the presented methods is developed, which turns\nthe implementations from only locally available software to Web-based services\nthat can be accessed from any computer in the Internet that is equipped with a\nWeb browser. In particular, the results are not bound to the current\nMathematica implementation but can be adapted to any other computer algebra\nsystem (e.g. Maple) or numerical software system (e.g.MATLAB) of similar\nexpressiveness. Barotropic vorticity equation (=Hasegawa-Mima equation) with\nzero boundary conditions on a square is taken as a main example.\n", "  We prove an inequality relating the trace of the extrinsic curvature, the\ntotal angular momentum, the centre of mass, and the Trautman-Bondi mass for a\nclass of gravitational initial data sets with constant mean curvature extending\nto null infinity. As an application we obtain non-existence results for the\nasymptotic Dirichlet problem for CMC hypersurfaces in stationary space-times.\n", "  Some tunneling phenomena are described, in the semiclassical approximation,\nby unstable complex trajectories. We develop a systematic procedure to\nstabilize the trajectories and to calculate the tunneling probability,\nincluding both the suppression exponent and prefactor. We find that the\ninstability of tunneling solutions modifies the power-law dependence of the\nprefactor on h as compared to the case of stable solutions.\n", "  We study long-distance effects in rare exclusive semileptonic decays B ->\nK_{1}ell ^{+}ell ^{-}, K_{1} is the axial vector meson.The form factors,\ndescribing the meson transition amplitudes of the effective Hamiltonian, are\ncalculated using Ward identites which are then used to calculate branching\nratio and forward-backward asymmetry in these decay modes. The zero of\nforward-backward asymmetry is of special interest and provide us the precission\ntest of Standard model.\n", "  We study $B\\to J/\\Psi \\eta^{(\\prime)}$ decays and suggest two methods to\ndetermine the $\\eta-\\eta^{\\prime}$ mixing angle. We calculate not only the\nfactorizable contribution in QCD facorization scheme but also the\nnonfactorizable hard spectator corrections in pQCD approach. We get the\nbranching ratio of $B\\to J/\\Psi \\eta$ which is consistent with recent\nexperimental data and predict the branching ratio of $B\\to J/\\Psi\n\\eta^{\\prime}$ to be $7.59\\times 10^{-6}$. Two methods for determining\n$\\eta-\\eta^{\\prime}$ mixing angle are suggested in this paper. For the first\nmethod, we get the $\\eta-\\eta^{\\prime}$ mixing angle to be about\n$-13.1^{\\circ}$, which is in consistency with others in the literature. The\nsecond method depends on less parameters so can be used to determine the\n$\\eta-\\eta^{\\prime}$ mixing angle with better accuracy but needs, as an input,\nthe branching ratio for $B\\to J/\\Psi \\eta^{\\prime}$which should be measured in\nthe near future.\n", "  The basic aim of the thesis is the study of the propagation of particles and\nquasiparticles in non-trivial backgrounds from the quantum field theory point\nof view. By \"non-trivial background\" we mean either a non-vacuum state in\nMinkowski spacetime or an arbitrary state in a curved spacetime. Starting with\nthe case of a flat spacetime, the basic properties of the particle and\nquasiparticle propagation are analyzed using two different methods other than\nthe conventional mean-field-based techniques: on the one hand, the quantum\nstate corresponding to the quasiparticle excitation is explicitly constructed;\non the other hand, the spectral representation of the two-point propagators is\nanalyzed. Both methods lead to the same results: the energy and decay rate of\nthe quasiparticles are determined by the real and imaginary parts of the\nretarded self-energy respectively. These general results are applied to two\nparticular quantum systems: first, a scalar particle immersed in a thermal\ngraviton bath; second, a simplified atomic model, seizing the opportunity to\nconnect with other statistical and first-quantized approaches. In the second\npart of the thesis the results are extended to curved spacetime. Working with a\nquasilocal quasiparticle concept the flat-spacetime results are recovered. In\ncosmology, within the adiabatic approximation, it is possible to go beyond the\nflat spacetime results and find additional effects due to the universe\nexpansion. The cosmologically-induced effects are analyzed, obtaining that\nthere might be an additional contribution to the particle decay due to the\nuniverse expansion. In the de Sitter case, this additional contribution\ncoincides with the decay rate in a thermal bath in a flat spacetime at the\ncorresponding de Sitter temperature.\n", "  We show how rate-distortion theory provides a mechanism for automated theory\nbuilding by naturally distinguishing between regularity and randomness. We\nstart from the simple principle that model variables should, as much as\npossible, render the future and past conditionally independent. From this, we\nconstruct an objective function for model making whose extrema embody the\ntrade-off between a model's structural complexity and its predictive power. The\nsolutions correspond to a hierarchy of models that, at each level of\ncomplexity, achieve optimal predictive power at minimal cost. In the limit of\nmaximal prediction the resulting optimal model identifies a process's intrinsic\norganization by extracting the underlying causal states. In this limit, the\nmodel's complexity is given by the statistical complexity, which is known to be\nminimal for achieving maximum prediction. Examples show how theory building can\nprofit from analyzing a process's causal compressibility, which is reflected in\nthe optimal models' rate-distortion curve--the process's characteristic for\noptimally balancing structure and noise at different levels of representation.\n", "  We present an imperative quantum programming language LanQ which was designed\nto support combination of quantum and classical programming and basic process\noperations - process creation and interprocess communication. The language can\nthus be used for implementing both classical and quantum algorithms and\nprotocols. Its syntax is similar to that of C language what makes it easy to\nlearn for existing programmers. In this paper, we present operational semantics\nof the language and a proof of type soundness of the noncommunicating part of\nthe language. We provide an example run of a quantum random number generator.\n", "  A matrix Berry phase can be generated and detected by {\\it all electric\nmeans} in II-VI or III-V n-type semiconductor quantum dots by changing the\nshape of the confinement potential. This follows from general symmetry\nconsiderations in the presence of spin-orbit coupling terms. The resulting 2 x\n2 matrix Berry phase can be characterized by two numbers of geometric origin.\nWe investigate how these parameters depend on the shape and area of closed\nadiabatic paths. We suggest how the matrix Berry phase may be detected in\ntransport measurements.\n", "  The deconfinement phase transition from hadronic matter to quark matter can\ncontinuously occur during spins down of neutron stars. It will lead to the\nrelease of latent heat if the transition is the first-order one. We have\ninvestigated the energy release of such deconfinement phase transition for\nrotating hybrid stars model which include mixed phase of hadronic matter and\nquark matter. The release of latent heat per baryon is calculated through\nstudying a randomly process of infinitesimal compressing. Finally, we can\nself-consistently get the heating luminosity of deconfinement phase transition\nby imputing the EOS of mixed phase, and based on the equation of rotation\nstructure of stars.\n", "  We investigate the entanglement entropy between two subsets of particles in\nthe ground state of the Calogero-Sutherland model. By using the duality\nrelations of the Jack symmetric polynomials, we obtain exact expressions for\nboth the reduced density matrix and the entanglement entropy in the limit of an\ninfinite number of particles traced out. From these results, we obtain an upper\nbound value of the entanglement entropy. This upper bound has a clear\ninterpretation in terms of fractional exclusion statistics.\n", "  We use the method of Maximum (relative) Entropy to process information in the\nform of observed data and moment constraints. The generic \"canonical\" form of\nthe posterior distribution for the problem of simultaneous updating with data\nand moments is obtained. We discuss the general problem of non-commuting\nconstraints, when they should be processed sequentially and when\nsimultaneously. As an illustration, the multinomial example of die tosses is\nsolved in detail for two superficially similar but actually very different\nproblems.\n", "  A novel atomistic-continuum method (ACM) based on finite element method (FEM)\nis proposed to numerically simulate the nano-scaled Poisson's ratio and Young's\nmodulus effect of Lithium (Li) body-centered cubic (BCC) structure. The\npotential energy between Li atoms is described by the Morse potential function\n[1]. The pre-force effect will be discussed due to the different Li lattice\nlength between experimental lattice constant and diatom distance from Morse\nfunction. Moreover, the size effect of the nano-scaled Li cluster will be\nintroduced.\n", "  We present an algorithmic framework for a variant of the quantum Monte Carlo\noperator-loop algorithm, where non-local cluster updates are constructed in a\nway that makes each individual loop smaller. The algorithm is designed to\nincrease simulation efficiency in cases where conventional loops become very\nlarge, do not close altogether, or otherwise behave poorly. We demonstrate and\ncharacterize some aspects of the short-loop on a square lattice spin-1/2 XXZ\nmodel where, remarkably, a significant increase in simulation efficiency is\nobserved in some parameter regimes. The simplicity of the model provides a\nprototype for the use of short-loops on more complicated quantum systems.\n", "  The Riemann equation $u_t+uu_x=0$, which describes a one-dimensional\naccelerationless perfect fluid, possesses solutions that typically develop\nshocks in a finite time. This equation is $\\cP\\cT$ symmetric. A one-parameter\n$\\cP\\cT$-invariant complex deformation of this equation,\n$u_t-iu(iu_x)^\\epsilon= 0$ ($\\epsilon$ real), is solved exactly using the\nmethod of characteristic strips, and it is shown that for real initial\nconditions, shocks cannot develop unless $\\epsilon$ is an odd integer.\n", "  We realize experimentally an atom-optics quantum chaotic system, the\nquasiperiodic kicked rotor, which is equivalent to a 3D disordered system, that\nallow us to demonstrate the Anderson metal-insulator transition. Sensitive\nmeasurements of the atomic wavefunction dynamics and the use of finite-size\nscaling techniques make it possible to extract both the critical parameters and\nthe critical exponent of the transition, which is in good agreement with the\nvalue obtained in numerical simulations of the 3D Anderson model.\n", "  Validation is often defined as the process of determining the degree to which\na model is an accurate representation of the real world from the perspective of\nits intended uses. Validation is crucial as industries and governments depend\nincreasingly on predictions by computer models to justify their decisions. In\nthis article, we survey the model validation literature and propose to\nformulate validation as an iterative construction process that mimics the\nprocess occurring implicitly in the minds of scientists. We thus offer a formal\nrepresentation of the progressive build-up of trust in the model, and thereby\nreplace incapacitating claims on the impossibility of validating a given model\nby an adaptive process of constructive approximation. This approach is better\nadapted to the fuzzy, coarse-grained nature of validation. Our procedure\nfactors in the degree of redundancy versus novelty of the experiments used for\nvalidation as well as the degree to which the model predicts the observations.\nWe illustrate the new methodology first with the maturation of Quantum\nMechanics as the arguably best established physics theory and then with several\nconcrete examples drawn from some of our primary scientific interests: a\ncellular automaton model for earthquakes, an anomalous diffusion model for\nsolar radiation transport in the cloudy atmosphere, and a computational fluid\ndynamics code for the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability. This article is an\naugmented version of Sornette et al. [2007] that appeared in Proceedings of the\nNational Academy of Sciences in 2007 (doi: 10.1073/pnas.0611677104), with an\nelectronic supplement at URL\nhttp://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/0611677104/DC1. Sornette et al. [2007] is\nalso available in preprint form at physics/0511219.\n", "  We describe the discovery of HAT-P-4b, a low-density extrasolar planet\ntransiting BD+36 2593, a V = 11.2 mag slightly evolved metal-rich late F star.\nThe planet's orbital period is 3.056536+/-0.000057 d with a mid-transit epoch\nof 2,454,245.8154 +/- 0.0003 (HJD). Based on high-precision photometric and\nspectroscopic data, and by using transit light curve modeling, spectrum\nanalysis and evolutionary models, we derive the following planet parameters:\nMp= 0.68 +/- 0.04 MJ, Rp= 1.27 +/- 0.05 RJ, rho = 0.41 +/- 0.06 g cm-3 and a =\n0.0446 +/- 0.0012 AU. Because of its relatively large radius, together with its\nassumed high metallicity of that of its parent star, this planet adds to the\ntheoretical challenges to explain inflated extrasolar planets.\n", "  What is information? Is it physical? We argue that in a Bayesian theory the\nnotion of information must be defined in terms of its effects on the beliefs of\nrational agents. Information is whatever constrains rational beliefs and\ntherefore it is the force that induces us to change our minds. This problem of\nupdating from a prior to a posterior probability distribution is tackled\nthrough an eliminative induction process that singles out the logarithmic\nrelative entropy as the unique tool for inference. The resulting method of\nMaximum relative Entropy (ME), which is designed for updating from arbitrary\npriors given information in the form of arbitrary constraints, includes as\nspecial cases both MaxEnt (which allows arbitrary constraints) and Bayes' rule\n(which allows arbitrary priors). Thus, ME unifies the two themes of these\nworkshops -- the Maximum Entropy and the Bayesian methods -- into a single\ngeneral inference scheme that allows us to handle problems that lie beyond the\nreach of either of the two methods separately. I conclude with a couple of\nsimple illustrative examples.\n", "  We demonstrate three-dimensional vibrational imaging of director structures\nin liquid crystals using coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) polarized\nmicroscopy. Spatial mapping of the structures is based on sensitivity of a\npolarized CARS signal to orientation of anisotropic molecules in liquid\ncrystals. As an example, we study structures in a smectic material and\ndemonstrate that single-scan CARS and two-photon fluorescence images of\nmolecular orientation patterns are consistent with each other and with the\nstructure model.\n", "  We propose a symmetric version of the multi-scale entanglement\nrenormalization Ansatz (MERA) in two spatial dimensions (2D) and use this\nAnsatz to find an unknown ground state of a 2D quantum system. Results in the\nsimple 2D quantum Ising model on the $8\\times8$ square lattice are found to be\nvery accurate even with the smallest non-trivial truncation parameter.\n", "  AgInSe2 nanorods (NRs) with diameter of 15 nm have been investigated for\ntheir nonlinear optical responses by using Z-scan and transient absorption\ntechniques with femtosecond laser pulses of photon energy greater than the\nbandgap. At excitation irradiance of 20 GW/cm2, AgInSe2 NRs reveal saturation\nin the nonlinear absorption and optical Kerr nonlinearity with a recovery time\ndetermined to be a few ten picoseconds. Such large saturable absorption and\nKerr nonlinearity exhibit a third-order susceptibility of 1.2 x 10-8 esu and a\nfigure of merit of 0.04 esu.cm.s-1, making AgInSe2 NRs a promising candidate\nfor saturable absorption devices.\n", "  We present a family of methods, analytical and numerical, which can describe\nbehaviour in (non) equilibrium ensembles, both classical and quantum,\nespecially in the complex systems, where the standard approaches cannot be\napplied. We demonstrate the creation of nontrivial (meta) stable states\n(patterns), localized, chaotic, entangled or decoherent, from basic localized\nmodes in various collective models arising from the quantum hierarchy of\nWigner-von Neumann-Moyal-Lindblad equations, which are the result of\n``wignerization'' procedure of classical BBGKY hierarchy. We present the\nexplicit description of internal quantum dynamics by means of exact\nanalytical/numerical computations.\n", "  The effects of the finite size of the network on the evolutionary dynamics of\na Boolean network are analyzed. In the model considered, Boolean networks\nevolve via a competition between nodes that punishes those in the majority. It\nis found that finite size networks evolve in a fundamentally different way than\ninfinitely large networks do. The symmetry of the evolutionary dynamics of\ninfinitely large networks that selects for canalizing Boolean functions is\nbroken in the evolutionary dynamics of finite size networks. In finite size\nnetworks there is an additional selection for input inverting Boolean functions\nthat output a value opposite to the majority of input values. These results are\nrevealed through an empirical study of the model that calculates the frequency\nof occurrence of the different possible Boolean functions. Classes of functions\nare found to occur with the same frequency. Those classes depend on the\nsymmetry of the evolutionary dynamics and correspond to orbits of the relevant\nsymmetry group. The empirical results match analytic results, determined by\nutilizing Polya's theorem, for the number of orbits expected in both finite\nsize and infinitely large networks. The reason for the symmetry breaking in the\nevolutionary dynamics is found to be due to the need for nodes in finite size\nnetworks to behave differently in order to cooperate so that the system\ncollectively performs as well as possible. The results suggest that both finite\nsize effects and symmetry are important for understanding the evolution of\nreal-world complex networks, including genetic regulatory networks.\n", "  We present exact results for the spectrum of the Nth power of the Laplacian\nin a bounded domain. We begin with the one dimensional case and show that the\nwhole spectrum can be obtained in the limit of large N. We also show that it is\na useful numerical approach valid for any N. Finally, we discuss implications\nof this work and present its possible extensions for non integer N and for 3D\nLaplacian problems.\n", "  We describe the distribution of the first finite number of eigenvalues in a\nnewly-forming band of the spectrum of the random Hermitean matrix model. The\nmethod is rigorously based on the Riemann-Hilbert analysis of the corresponding\northogonal polynomials. We provide an analysis with an error term of order\nN^(-2 h) where 1/h = 2 nu+2 is the exponent of non-regularity of the effective\npotential, thus improving even in the usual case the analysis of the pertinent\nliterature. The behavior of the first finite number of zeroes (eigenvalues)\nappearing in the new band is analyzed and connected with the location of the\nzeroes of certain Freud polynomials. In general all these newborn zeroes\napproach the point of nonregularity at the rate N^(-h) whereas one (a stray\nzero) lags behind at a slower rate of approach. The kernels for the correlator\nfunctions in the scaling coordinate near the emerging band are provided\ntogether with the subleading term: in particular the transition between K and\nK+1 eigenvalues is analyzed in detail.\n", "  We analyze heartbeat interval recordings from two independent databases: (a)\n19 healthy young (avg. age 25.7 years) and 16 healthy elderly subjects (avg.\nage 73.8 years) during 2h under resting conditions from the Fantasia database;\nand (b) 29 healthy elderly subjects (avg. age 75.9 years) during $\\approx{}8$h\nof sleep from the SHHS database, and the same subjects recorded 5 years later.\nWe quantify: (1) The average heart rate <RR>; (2) the SD $\\sigma_{RR}$ and\n$\\sigma_{\\Delta{}RR}$ of the heartbeat intervals RR and their increments\n$\\Delta{}RR$; (3) the long-range correlations in RR as measured by the scaling\nexponent $\\alpha_{RR}$ using the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis; (4) fractal\nlinear and nonlinear properties as represented by the scaling exponents\n$\\alpha^{sign}$ and $\\alpha^{mag}$ for the time series of the sign and\nmagnitude of $\\Delta{}RR$; (5) the nonlinear fractal dimension $D(k)$ of $RR$\nusing the Fractal Dimension Analysis. We find: (1) No significant difference in\n$\\left<RR\\right>$ (P>0.05); (2) a significant difference in $\\sigma_{RR}$ and\n$\\sigma_{\\Delta{}RR}$ for the Fantasia groups (P<10^{-4}) but no significant\nchange with age between the elderly SHHS groups (P>0.5); (3) no significant\nchange in the fractal measures $\\alpha_{RR}$ (P>0.15), $\\alpha^{sign}$ (P>0.2),\n$\\alpha^{mag}$ (P>0.3), and D(k) with age. Our findings do not support the\nhypothesis that fractal linear and nonlinear characteristics of heartbeat\ndynamics break down with advanced age in healthy subjects. While our results\nindeed show a reduced SD of heartbeat fluctuations with advanced age, the\ninherent temporal fractal and nonlinear organization of these fluctuations\nremains stable.\n", "  Temperature equilibration of hydrogen is studied for conditions relevant to\ninertial confinement fusion. New molecular-dynamics simulations and results\nfrom quantum many-body theory are compared with Landau-Spitzer (LS) predictions\nfor temperatures T from 50 eV to 5000 eV, and densities with Wigner-Seitz radii\nr_s = 1.0 and 0.5. The relaxation is slower than the LS result, even for\ntemperatures in the keV range, but converges to agreement in the high-T limit.\n", "  The dynamical symmetry breaking in a quasi-(1+1)-dimensional relativistic\nmodel is investigated. The motions of particles in intrachain are described as\na relativistic electron-hole gas, while the interchain hopping term is\nintroduced as a 0th-component of vector in (1+1)-dimensions, a kind of chemical\npotential of the system. The gauge symmetry of the model is chosen as U(1)\nsuitable for a possible situation of a real substance in condensed matter\nphysics. We consider the BCS-type contact interactions for the s-wave\nfermion-pair condensates, while employ the nonlocal interactions of the\ngeneralized BCS framework to generate the $p$-, $d$- and $f$-wave condensations\nin the system. Especially we examine the dynamical generation of a Dirac mass\nterm and superconductivity in the model. The phenomenon is interpreted as\nmetal-insulator/metal-superconductor phase transitions.\n", "  It has been shown that one can accommodate data (Bayes) and constraints\n(MaxEnt) in one method, the method of Maximum (relative) Entropy (ME) (Giffin\n2007). In this paper we show a complex agent based example of inference with\ntwo different forms of information; moments and data. In this example, several\nagents each receive partial information about a system in the form of data. In\naddition, each agent agrees or is informed that there are certain global\nconstraints on the system that are always true. The agents are then asked to\nmake inferences about the entire system. The system becomes more complex as we\nadd agents and allow them to share information. This system can have a\ngeometrical form, such as a crystal structure. The shape may dictate how the\nagents are able to share information, such as sharing with nearest neighbors.\nThis method can be used to model many systems where the agents or cells have\nlocal or partial information but must adhere to some global rules. This could\nalso illustrate how the agents evolve and could illuminate emergent behavior of\nthe system.\n", "  The dynamical generation of Dirac mass in the supersymmetric\nNambu$-$Jona-Lasinio (SNJL) model with the seesaw mechanism of neutrino is\ninvestigeted. The right and left handed Majorana mass parameters are introduced\ninto the SNJL model; we regard them as external model parameters. The question\non the origin of these Majorana masses are set aside, and we concentrate on the\nexamination of the effect of the Majorana mass parameters on the dynamical\ngeneration of Dirac mass. The effective potential of the model and the gap\nequation for the self-consistent determination of Dirac mass are derived and\nsolved. We use both the four-dimensional covariant and three-dimensional\nnon-covariant cutoff schemes for the regularizations of the effective\npotential. We find there are cases of the first and second order phase\ntransitions with respect to variation of the coupling constant of the\nNambu$-$Jona-Lasinio-type four-body interaction of the SNJL model. In the case\nof second-order phase transition, the dynamically generated Dirac mass\n$|\\phi_{S}|$ can arbitrarily be small compared with the right-handed Majorana\nmass parameter $|M|$ and thus the seesaw condition $0<|\\phi_{S}|\\ll|M|$ can be\nsatisfied by a fine tuning of the coupling constant, while at the first-order\ncase it seems very difficult and/or \"unnatural\" to satisfy the condition. The\nnumerical results do not depend on the difference of the cutoff schemes\nqualitatively.\n", "  The superfluid phase diagrams of a two-dimensional cold polarized Fermi gas\nin the BCS-BEC crossover are systematically and analytically investigated. In\nthe BCS-Leggett mean field theory, the transition from unpolarized superfluid\nphase to normal phase is always of first order. For a homogeneous system, the\ntwo critical Zeeman fields and the critical population imbalance are\nanalytically determined in the whole coupling parameter region, and the\nsuperfluid-normal mixed phase is shown to be the ground state between the two\ncritical fields. The density profile in the presence of a harmonic trap\ncalculated in the local density approximation exhibits a shell structure, a\nsuperfluid core at the center and a normal shell outside. For weak interaction,\nthe normal shell contains a partially polarized cloud with constant density\ndifference surrounded by a fully polarized state. For strong interaction, the\nnormal shell is totally in fully polarized state with a density profile\ndepending only on the global population imbalance. The di-fermion bound states\ncan survive in the whole highly imbalanced normal phase.\n", "  Circumstellar disks are an integral part of the star formation process and\nthe sites where planets are formed. Understanding the physical processes that\ndrive their evolution, as disks evolve from optically thick to optically thin,\nis crucial for our understanding of planet formation. Disks evolve through\nvarious processes including accretion onto the star, dust settling and\ncoagulation, dynamical interactions with forming planets, and\nphoto-evaporation. However, the relative importance and timescales of these\nprocesses are still poorly understood. In this review, I summarize current\nmodels of the different processes that control the evolution of primordial\ncircumstellar disks around low-mass stars. I also discuss recent observational\ndevelopments on circumstellar disk evolution with a focus on new Spitzer\nresults on transition objects.\n", "  Using the Gaussian-03 for ab initio calculations, we have studied interaction\nof different acid molecules with a single water molecule. The molecular and\nsupermolecular optimized structures were found with the Becke-3-Lee-Yang-Parr\n(B3LYP-hybrid potential) calculations of density-functional theory (DFT)\nmethods as well as the Moeller-Plesset second-order perturbation theory, using\nthe basis set of Aug-cc-pVDZ quality and the CRENBL ECP effective core\npotential for molecules containing heavy iodine atom. Possible isomers of\nstudied acids and supermolecules, consisting of acid molecules coupled with a\nsingle water molecule, are shown. Energies, zero-point energies (ZPEs), thermal\nenthalpies and free energies, as well as the corresponding binding energies for\nthe theoretical methods were calculated. It was found that optimized structures\nof supermolecular isomers with lowest energies corresponding to the global\nminimum on the potential energy surfaces can be different for both theories.\nThe simplest structure acids H2S and H2Se, forming acid-water supermolecules,\ncan give clear evidence of disagreement of the two theoretical methods\nconcerning optimization of lowest energy structures, because the B3LYP-DFT\nmethod gives the lowest-energy structure for the first supermolecular isomer,\nbut the MP2 method for the second possible isomer. A dramatic difference\nbetween potential energy surfaces for both theories applying to the optimized\nstructure finding of the H2SO3-H2O supermolecular isomers was found, because\nMP2 supermolecular geometries cannot exist for the corresponding B3LYP-DFT\nones, for which the frequency characteristics of the supermolecular isomers\nwere also calculated. In general, the binding energies and ZPE ones for the MP2\nmethod are 10-15% larger than those for the B3LYP-DFT method.\n", "  We present a perturbation theory to find the response of an anisotropic DNA\nto the external tension. It is shown that the anisotropy has a nonzero but\nsmall contribution to the force-extension curve of the DNA. Thus an anisotropic\nDNA behaves like an isotropic one with an effective bending constant equal to\nthe harmonic average of its soft and hard bending constants.\n", "  Measurements on helium and argon gas flow through an array of parallel,\nlinear channels of 12 nm diameter and 200 micrometer length in a single\ncrystalline silicon membrane reveal a Knudsen diffusion type transport from\n10^2 to 10^7 in Knudsen number Kn. The classic scaling prediction for the\ntransport diffusion coefficient on temperature and mass of diffusing\nspecies,D_He ~ sqrt(T), is confirmed over a T range from 40 K to 300 K for He\nand for the ratio of D_He/D_Ar ~ sqrt(m_Ar/m_He). Deviations of the channels\nfrom a cylindrical form, resolved with transmission electron microscopy down to\nsubnanometer scales, quantitatively account for a reduced diffusivity as\ncompared to Knudsen diffusion in ideal tubular channels. The membrane\npermeation experiments are described over 10 orders of magnitude in Kn,\nencompassing the transition flow regime, by the unified flow model of Beskok\nand Karniadakis.\n", "  The letter reminds the historical fact that the known \"Lorenz gauge\" (or\n\"Lorenz condition/relation\") is first mentioned in a written form and named\nafter Ludwig Valentin Lorenz and not by/after Hendrik Antoon Lorentz.\n", "  There is a whole range of emergent phenomena in non-equilibrium behaviors can\nbe well described by a set of stochastic differential equations. Inspired by an\ninsight gained during our study of robustness and stability in phage lambda\ngenetic switch in modern biology, we found that there exists a classification\nof generic nonequilibrium processes: In the continuous description in terms of\nstochastic differential equations, there exists four dynamical elements: the\npotential function $\\phi$, the friction matrix $ S$, the anti-symmetric matrix\n$ T $, and the noise. The generic feature of absence of detailed balance is\nthen precisely represented by $T$. For dynamical near a fixed point, whether or\nnot it is stable or not, the stochastic dynamics is linear. A rather complete\nanalysis has been carried out (Kwon, Ao, Thouless, cond-mat/0506280; PNAS, {\\bf\n102} (2005) 13029), referred to as SDS I. One important and persistent question\nis the existence of a potential function with nonlinear force and with\nmultiplicative noise, with both nice local dynamical and global steady state\nproperties. Here we demonstrate that a dynamical structure built into\nstochastic differential equation allows us to construct such a global\noptimization potential function. First, we provide the construction. One of\nmost important ingredient is the generalized Einstein relation. We then present\nan approximation scheme: The gradient expansion which turns every order into\nlinear matrix equations. The consistent of such methodology with other known\nstochastic treatments will be discussed in next paper, SDS III; and the\nexplicitly connection to statistical mechanics and thermodynamics will be\ndiscussed in a forthcoming paper, SDS IV.\n", "  From a logic point of view this is the third in the series to solve the\nproblem of absence of detailed balance. This paper will be denoted as SDS III.\nThe existence of a dynamical potential with both local and global meanings in\ngeneral nonequilibrium processes has been controversial. Following an earlier\nexplicit construction by one of us (Ao, J. Phys. {\\bf A37}, L25 '04,\narXiv:0803.4356, referred to as SDS II), in the present paper we show\nrigorously its existence for a generic class of situations in physical and\nbiological sciences. The local dynamical meaning of this potential function is\ndemonstrated via a special stochastic differential equation and its global\nsteady-state meaning via a novel and explicit form of Fokker-Planck equation,\nthe zero mass limit. We also give a procedure to obtain the special stochastic\ndifferential equation for any given Fokker-Planck equation. No detailed balance\ncondition is required in our demonstration. For the first time we obtain here a\nformula to describe the noise induced shift in drift force comparing to the\nsteady state distribution, a phenomenon extensively observed in numerical\nstudies. The comparison to two well known stochastic integration methods, Ito\nand Stratonovich, are made ready. Such comparison was made elsewhere (Ao, Phys.\nLife Rev. {\\bf 2} (2005) 117. q-bio/0605020).\n", "  We introduce the concept of boundaries of a complex network as the set of\nnodes at distance larger than the mean distance from a given node in the\nnetwork. We study the statistical properties of the boundaries nodes of complex\nnetworks. We find that for both Erd\\\"{o}s-R\\'{e}nyi and scale-free model\nnetworks, as well as for several real networks, the boundaries have fractal\nproperties. In particular, the number of boundaries nodes {\\it B} follows a\npower-law probability density function which scales as $B^{-2}$. The clusters\nformed by the boundary nodes are fractals with a fractal dimension $d_{f}\n\\approx 2$. We present analytical and numerical evidence supporting these\nresults for a broad class of networks. Our findings imply potential\napplications for epidemic spreading.\n", "  We consider ferromagnetic Ising models on graphs that converge locally to\ntrees. Examples include random regular graphs with bounded degree and uniformly\nrandom graphs with bounded average degree. We prove that the \"cavity\"\nprediction for the limiting free energy per spin is correct for any positive\ntemperature and external field. Further, local marginals can be approximated by\niterating a set of mean field (cavity) equations. Both results are achieved by\nproving the local convergence of the Boltzmann distribution on the original\ngraph to the Boltzmann distribution on the appropriate infinite random tree.\n", "  A novel recovery of some important documents related to the Fermi course on\nneutron physics, held at Los Alamos in 1945, is announced. Its relevance for\nthe effective launch of a British nuclear programme in the early postwar\nperiod, independently of the U.S. technical cooperation (precluded by the\nAmerican authorities) and warmly supported by Chadwick, is discussed.\n", "  Recently, scanning tunneling microscopy on Bi-2212 cuprate superconductor has\nrevealed a spatial variation of the energy gap that is directly correlated with\na modulation of the apical oxygen position. We identify two mechanisms by which\nout-of-plane oxygens can modulate the pairing interaction within the CuO_2\nlayer: a covalency between the x^2-y^2 band and apical p-orbital, and a\nscreening of correlation U by apical oxygen polarization. Both effects strongly\ndepend on the apical oxygen position and their cooperative action explains the\nexperiment.\n", "  We extend a result by Ojima on spontaneous symmetry breaking of Lorentz\nboosts in thermal (KMS) states and show that it is in fact a special case in a\nmore general class of examples of spontaneous symmetry breaking of Lorentz\nsymmetry in relativistic many-body systems. Furthermore we analyse the nature\nof the corresponding Goldstone phenomenon and the type of Goldstone excitations\n(provided they have particle character).\n", "  Aims: We investigate the change in the surface abundance of $^{12}$C during\nthe evolution along the AGB, aiming to constrain third dredge-up models.\n  Methods: High-resolution, near-infrared spectra of a sample of AGB stars in\nthe LMC cluster NGC 1846 were obtained. A cluster sample ensures a high level\nof homogeneity with respect to age, metallicity, and distance. The C/O ratio\nand the ratio of $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C were measured and compared with our\nevolutionary models.\n  Results: For the first time, we show the evolution of the C/O and\n$^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios along a cluster AGB. Our findings allow us to check\nthe reliability of the evolutionary models and, in particular, the efficiency\nof the third dredge up. The increase in both C/O and $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C in the\nobserved O-rich stars is reproduced by the models well. However, the low carbon\nisotopic ratios of the two C-stars in our sample indicate the late occurrence\nof moderate extra mixing. The extra mixing affects the most luminous AGB stars\nand is capable of increasing the abundance of $^{13}$C, while leaving unchanged\nthe C/O ratio, which has been fixed by the cumulative action of several third\ndredge-up episodes. We find indications that the F abundance also increases\nalong the AGB, supporting an in situ production of this element.\n", "  Using the SCRPA, we study the intersite interaction effect on the dynamics of\nN electrons system. We have considered an extended Hubbard model including\nintrasite and intersite interactions, and we have applied this model to a\nsystem of two neighbouring atoms containing a free electron. The application of\nSCRPA to this model allows us to study the intersite interaction effect on the\nground state and the excitation energies of system. We show that the repulsive\ninteraction between the electrons of the neighbouring atoms is the origin of an\nsupplementary conductivity of the system.\n", "  A novel method for controlling nanowire magnetic properties and growth from\nfilling time profile is presented.\n  The wires are grown with an electrodeposition method (\"Template synthesis\")\nwith a wide selection of pore diameters. We show that stray-fields presence in\nferromagnetic nanowires are entirely dependent on the nanowire diameter.\nBesides a crossover effect in the reversal mechanism is observed with change in\ndiameter. In this work, theory and experiment agree and confirm that according\nto the variety of hysteresis loop measured, about four ranges of values of pore\ndiameter control the orientation of nanowire magnetization easy axis with\nrespect to the geometrical axis.\n", "  The interplay between disorder and spin polarization in a GaMnAs thin layer\nresults into spin-polarized impurity hole bands. A figure of merit is defined\nto label the hole state as being extended or localized. The calculation leads\nto a phase diagram determining the metallic or non-metallic character of the\nsample. It is shown that samples with the highest figures of merit have a ratio\nbetween the extended hole density and the Mn concentration near 0.2, in\nagreement with the ratio of 0.1-0.25 known to occur among samples produced with\nthe highest Curie temperatures. Both the non-metal-to-metal and the\nmetal-to-non-metal transitions experimentally observed in the ferromagnetic\nregime are obtained, as the Mn concentration increases. An explanation is given\nfor the occurrence of a maximal Curie temperature in ferromagnetic GaMnAs\nsamples.\n", "  We apply coherent anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS) microscopy to\ncharacterize director structures in liquid crystals.\n", "  We study the chaotic behavior of the synchronization phase transition in the\nKuramoto model. We discuss the relationship with analogous features found in\nthe Hamiltonian Mean Field (HMF) model. Our numerical results support the\nconnection between the two models, which can be considered as limiting cases\n(dissipative and conservative, respectively) of a more general dynamical system\nof damped-driven coupled pendula. We also show that, in the Kuramoto model, the\nshape of the phase transition and the largest Lyapunov exponent behavior are\nstrongly dependent on the distribution of the natural frequencies.\n", "  Time series analysis of fossil biodiversity of marine invertebrates in the\nPaleobiology Database (PBDB) shows a significant periodicity at approximately\n63 My, in agreement with previous analyses based on the Sepkoski database. I\ndiscuss how this result did not appear in a previous analysis of the PBDB. The\nexistence of the 63 My periodicity, despite very different treatment of\nsystematic error in both PBDB and Sepkoski databases strongly argues for\nconsideration of its reality in the fossil record. Cross-spectral analysis of\nthe two datasets finds that a 62 My periodicity coincides in phase by 1.6 My,\nequivalent to better than the errors in either measurement. Consequently, the\ntwo data sets not only contain the same strong periodicity, but its peaks and\nvalleys closely correspond in time. Two other spectral peaks appear in the PBDB\nanalysis, but appear to be artifacts associated with detrending and with the\nincreased interval length. Sampling-standardization procedures implemented by\nthe PBDB collaboration suggest that the signal is not an artifact of sampling\nbias. Further work should focus on finding the cause of the 62 My periodicity.\n", "  These lectures deal with the problem of inductive inference, that is, the\nproblem of reasoning under conditions of incomplete information. Is there a\ngeneral method for handling uncertainty? Or, at least, are there rules that\ncould in principle be followed by an ideally rational mind when discussing\nscientific matters? What makes one statement more plausible than another? How\nmuch more plausible? And then, when new information is acquired how do we\nchange our minds? Or, to put it differently, are there rules for learning? Are\nthere rules for processing information that are objective and consistent? Are\nthey unique? And, come to think of it, what, after all, is information? It is\nclear that data contains or conveys information, but what does this precisely\nmean? Can information be conveyed in other ways? Is information physical? Can\nwe measure amounts of information? Do we need to? Our goal is to develop the\nmain tools for inductive inference--probability and entropy--from a thoroughly\nBayesian point of view and to illustrate their use in physics with examples\nborrowed from the foundations of classical statistical physics.\n", "  A general phenomenological theory is presented for the phase behavior of\nferromagnetic superconductors with spin-triplet electron Cooper pairing. The\ntheory accounts in detail for the temperature-pressure phase diagram of\nZrZn$_2$, while the main features of the diagram for UGe$_2$ are also\ndescribed. Quantitative criteria are deduced for the U-type (type I) and\nZr-type (type II) unconventional ferromagnetic superconductors with\nspin-triplet Cooper electron pairing. Some basic properties of quantum phase\ntransitions are also elucidated.\n", "  Entropic dynamics, a program that aims at deriving the laws of physics from\nstandard probabilistic and entropic rules for processing information, is\ndeveloped further. We calculate the probability for an arbitrary path followed\nby a system as it moves from given initial to final states. For an\nappropriately chosen configuration space the path of maximum probability\nreproduces Newtonian dynamics.\n", "  A system of functions (signals) on the finite line, called the oscillator\nsystem, is described and studied. Applications of this system for discrete\nradar and digital communication theory are explained.\n  Keywords: Weil representation, commutative subgroups, eigenfunctions, random\nbehavior, deterministic construction\n", "  In this paper we construct a new variant of the Weil representation,\nassociated with a symplectic vector space V defined over a finite field of\ncharacteristic two. Our variant is a representation of a bigger group than that\nof Weil. In the course, we develop the formalism of canonical vector spaces,\nwhich enables us to realize the bigger symmetry group and the representation in\na transparent manner.\n", "  We study anomalous elasticity in the tubule phases of nematic and smectic\nelastomer membranes, which are flat in one direction and crumpled in another.\nThese phases share the same macroscopic symmetry properties including\nspontaneously-broken in-plane isotropy and hence belong to the same\nuniversality class. Below an upper critical value $D_c =3$ of the membranes'\nintrinsic dimension D, thermal fluctuations renormalize the elasticity with\nrespect to elastic displacements along the tubule axis so that elastic moduli\nfor compression along the tubule axis and for bending the tubule axis become\nlength-scale dependent. This anomalous elasticity belongs to the same\nuniversality class as that of d-dimensional conventional smectics with D taking\non the role of d. For physical tubule, D=2, this anomaly is of power-law type\nand thus might by easier to detect experimentally than the logarithmic anomaly\nin conventional smectics.\n", "  We present observations for three star clusters, Kron 11, Kron 63 and NGC\n121, in the Small Magellanic Cloud. We have studied their structure and derived\ntheir fundamental parameters by means of their luminosity functions, their\ncolor magnitude diagrams and the Padova suite of isochrones. NGC 121 is a well\nstudied object, for which we confirm previous evidence about its old age and\nlow metal content, and have found that it is undergoing mass segregation. Kron\n11 and Kron 63 are poorly populated clusters which had never been studied so\nfar. Kron 11 is several gigayears younger than NGC 121, while Kron 63 is\nbasically a very young star aggregate. Both clusters are immersed in dense\nstellar fields which share the same population properties, suggesting that in\ntheir cases, cluster ages are consistent with typical ages of field stars.\n", "  We evaluate speculation about the possibility of a dangerous release of\nenergy within the liquid Helium of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) cryogenic\nsystem due to the occurrence of a \"Bose-Nova\". Bose-Novae are radial bursts of\nrapidly moving atoms which can occur when a Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC)\nundergoes a collapse due the interatomic potential being deliberately made\nattractive using a magnetic field close to the Feshbach resonance. Liquid 4He\nhas a monatomic structure with s-wave electrons, zero nuclear spin, no\nhyperfine splitting, and as a consequence no Feshbach resonance which would\nallow one to change its normally repulsive interactions to be attractive.\nBecause of this, a Bose-Nova style collapse of 4He is impossible. Additional\nspeculations concerning cold fusion during these events are easily dismissed\nusing the usual arguments about the Coulomb barrier at low temperatures, and\nare not needed to explain the Bose-Einstein condensate Bose-Nova phenomenon. We\nconclude that that there is no physics whatsoever which suggests that Helium\ncould undergo any kind of unforeseen catastrophic explosion.\n", "  The optical birefringence of rod-like nematogens (7CB, 8CB), imbibed in\nparallel silica channels with 10 nm diameter and 300 micrometer length, is\nmeasured and compared to the thermotropic bulk behavior. The orientational\norder of the confined liquid crystals, quantified by the uniaxial nematic\nordering parameter, evolves continuously between paranematic and nematic\nstates, in contrast to the discontinuous isotropic-to-nematic bulk phase\ntransitions. A Landau-de Gennes model reveals that the strength of the\norientational ordering fields, imposed by the silica walls, is beyond a\ncritical threshold, that separates discontinuous from continuous\nparanematic-to-nematic behavior. Quenched disorder effects, attributable to\nwall irregularities, leave the transition temperatures affected only\nmarginally, despite the strong ordering fields in the channels.\n", "  In this thesis the data analysis designed by author for the \"Pi of the Sky\"\nexperiment is presented. The data analysis consists of data reduction and\nspecific algorithms for identification of short time scale astrophysical\nprocesses. The algorithms have been tested and their efficiency has been\ndetermined and described. The \"Pi of the Sky\" prototype is collecting data\nsince June 2004 and algorithms could be intensively studied and improved during\nover 700 nights. A few events of confirmed astrophysical origin and above 100\nevents in 10s time scale of unknown nature have been discovered. During the\ndata collection period 3 Gamma Ray Bursts (out of 231) occurred in the field of\nview of the telescope, but no optical counterpart has been found. The upper\nlimits for brightness of the optical counterpart have been determined. The\ncontinuous monitoring of the sky and own trigger for optical flashes allowed to\ndetermine limits on the number of GRBs without corresponding gamma-ray\ndetection. This allowed determining limits on the ratio of emission collimation\nin optical and gamma bands, which is R >= 4.4. The perspectives of the full \"Pi\nof the Sky\" system has been studied and number of positive detections has been\nestimated on the level of ~ 2.5 events per year.\n", "  This thesis will be focused on the classical capacity of quantum channels,\none of the first areas treated by quantum information theorists. The problem is\nfairly solved since some years. Nevertheless, this work will give me a reason\nto introduce a consistent formalism of the quantum theory, as well as to review\nfundamental facts about quantum non-locality and how it can be used to enhance\ncommunication. Moreover, this reflects my dwelling in the spirit of classical\ninformation theory, and it is intended to be a starting point towards a\nthorough study of how quantum technologies can help to shape the future of\ntelecommunications.\n  Whenever it was possible, heuristic reasonings were introduced instead of\nrigorous mathematical proofs. This finds an explanation in that I am a\nself-taught neophyte in the field, and just about every time I came across a\nnew concept, physical arguments were always more compelling to me than just\nmaths. The technical content of the thesis is twofold. On one hand, a quadratic\nclassification based on optimization programs that I devised for distinguishing\nentangled states is presented in Chapter 4. In second place, a less difficult\nyet I hope equally interesting technical part consists of versions of some\nproofs throughout the text.\n", "  It is one of the most remarkable features of quantum physics that\nmeasurements on spatially separated systems cannot always be described by a\nlocally causal theory. In such a theory, the outcomes of local measurements are\ndetermined in advance solely by some unknown (or hidden) variables and the\nchoice of local measurements. Correlations that are allowed within the\nframework of a locally causal theory are termed classical. Typically, the fact\nthat quantum mechanics does not always result in classical correlations is\nrevealed by the violation of Bell inequalities, which are constraints that have\nto be satisfied by any classical correlations. It has been known for a long\ntime that entanglement is necessary to demonstrate nonclassical correlations,\nand hence a Bell inequality violation. However, since some entangled quantum\nstates are known to admit explicit locally causal models, the exact role of\nentanglement in Bell inequality violation has remained obscure. This thesis\nprovides both a comprehensive review on these issues as well as a report on new\ndiscoveries made to clarify the relationship between entanglement and Bell\ninequality violation.\n", "  We present a general thermodynamic theory that describes phases and phase\ntransitions of ferromagnetic superconductors with spin-triplet electron Cooper\npairing. The theory is based on extended Ginzburg-Landau expansion in powers of\nsuperconducting and ferromagnetic order parameters. We propose a simple form\nfor the dependence of theory parameters on the pressure that allows correct\ntheoretical outline of the temperature-pressure phase diagram for which at low\ntemperatures a stable phase of coexistence of p-wave superconductivity and\nitinerant ferromagnetism appears. We demonstrate that the theory is in an\nagreement with the experimental data for some intermetallic compounds that are\nexperimentally proven to be itinerant ferromagnetic exhibiting spin-triplet\nsuperconductivity. Some basic features of quantum phase transitions in such\nsystems are explained and clarified. We propose to group the spin-triplet\nferromagnetic superconductors in two different types of thermodynamic behavior,\non the basis of quantitative criterion deduced from the present theory and the\nanalysis of experimental data.\n", "  We consider a linear quench from the paramagnetic to ferromagnetic phase in\nthe quantum Ising chain interacting with a static spin environment. Both\ndecoherence from the environment and non-adiabaticity of the evolution near a\ncritical point excite the system from the final ferromagnetic ground state. For\nweak decoherence and relatively fast quenches the excitation energy,\nproportional to the number of kinks in the final state, decays like an inverse\nsquare root of a quench time, but slow transitions or strong decoherence make\nit decay in a much slower logarithmic way. We also find that fidelity between\nthe final ferromagnetic ground state and a final state after a quench decays\nexponentially with a size of a chain, with a decay rate proportional to average\ndensity of excited kinks, and a proportionality factor evolving from 1.3 for\nweak decoherence and fast quenches to approximately 1 for slow transitions or\nstrong decoherence. Simultaneously, correlations between kinks randomly\ndistributed along the chain evolve from a near-crystalline anti-bunching to a\nPoissonian distribution of kinks in a number of isolated Anderson localization\ncenters randomly scattered along the chain.\n", "  Econophysics, is based on the premise that some ideas and methods from\nphysics can be applied to economic situations. We intend to show in this paper\nhow a physics concept such as entropy can be applied to an economic problem. In\nso doing, we demonstrate how information in the form of observable data and\nmoment constraints are introduced into the method of Maximum relative Entropy\n(MrE). A general example of updating with data and moments is shown. Two\nspecific econometric examples are solved in detail which can then be used as\ntemplates for real world problems. A numerical example is compared to a large\ndeviation solution which illustrates some of the advantages of the MrE method.\n", "  An elasto-plasticity model with coupled hardening variables of strain type is\npresented. In the theoretical framework of generalized associativity, the\nformulation of this model is based on the introduction of two hardening\nvariables with a coupled evolution. Even if the corresponding hardening rules\nare linear, the stress-strain hardening evolution is non-linear. The numerical\nimplementation by a standard return mapping algorithm is discussed and some\nnumerical simulations of cyclic behaviour in the univariate case are presented.\n", "  This paper reviews two different uses of the continuous wavelet transform for\nmodal identification purposes. The properties of the wavelet transform, mainly\nenergetic, allow to emphasize or filter the main information within measured\nsignals and thus facilitate the modal parameter identification especially when\nmechanical systems exhibit modal coupling and/or relatively strong damping.\n", "  We investigate the way that the degenerate manifold of midgap edge states in\nquasicircular graphene quantum dots with zig-zag boundaries supports, under\nfree-magnetic-field conditions, strongly correlated many-body behavior\nanalogous to the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE), familiar from the case\nof semiconductor heterostructures in high magnetic fields. Systematic\nexact-diagonalization (EXD) numerical studies are presented for the first time\nfor 5 <= N <= 8 fully spin-polarized electrons and for total angular momenta in\nthe range of N(N-1)/2 <= L <= 150. We present a derivation of a\nrotating-electron-molecule (REM) type wave function based on the methodology\nintroduced earlier [C. Yannouleas and U. Landman, Phys. Rev. B 66, 115315\n(2002)] in the context of the FQHE in two-dimensional semiconductor quantum\ndots. The EXD wave functions are compared with FQHE trial functions of the\nLaughlin and the derived REM types. It is found that a variational extension of\nthe REM offers a better description for all fractional fillings compared with\nthat of the Laughlin functions (including total energies and overlaps), a fact\nthat reflects the strong azimuthal localization of the edge electrons. In\ncontrast with the multiring arrangements of electrons in circular semiconductor\nquantum dots, the graphene REMs exhibit in all instances a single (0,N)\npolygonal-ring molecular (crystalline) structure, with all the electrons\nlocalized on the edge. Disruptions in the zig-zag boundary condition along the\ncircular edge act effectively as impurities that pin the electron molecule,\nyielding single-particle densities with broken rotational symmetry that portray\ndirectly the azimuthal localization of the edge electrons.\n", "  An {\\it ab initio} relativistic band structure calculation of spin Hall\nconductivity (SHC) ($\\sigma_{xy}^z$) in Pd and Au metals has been performed. It\nis found that at low temperatures, intrinsic SHCs for Pd and Au are,\nrespectively, $\\sim 1400 (\\hbar/e)(\\Omega {\\rm cm})^{-1}$ and $\\sim 400\n(\\hbar/e)(\\Omega {\\rm cm})^{-1}$. The large SHC in Pd comes from the resonant\ncontribution from the spin-orbit splitting of the doubly degenerated 4$d$ bands\nnear the Fermi level at symmetry $\\Gamma$ and X points, and the smaller SHC in\nAu is due to the broad free electron like 6$s6p$-bands. However, as the\ntemperature increases, the SHC in Pd decreases monotonically and reduces to\n$\\sim 330 (\\hbar/e)(\\Omega {\\rm cm})^{-1}$ at 300 K, while the SHC in Au\nincreases steadily and reaches $\\sim 750 (\\hbar/e)(\\Omega {\\rm cm})^{-1}$ at\nroom temperature. This indicates that the gigantic spin Hall effect\n[$\\sigma_{xy}^z \\approx 10^5 (\\hbar/e)(\\Omega {\\rm cm})^{-1}$] observed\nrecently in the Au/FePt system [T. Seki, {\\it et al.}, Nature Materials {\\bf\n7}, 125 (2008)] is due to the extrinsic mechanisms such as the skew scattering\nby the impurities in Au.\n", "  We consider an axi-symmetric rotor perturbed by dissipative, conservative,\nand non-conservative positional forces originated at the contact with the\nanisotropic stator. The Campbell diagram of the unperturbed system is a\nmesh-like structure in the frequency-speed plane with double eigenfrequencies\nat the nodes. The diagram is convenient for the analysis of the traveling waves\nin the rotating elastic continuum. Computing sensitivities of the doublets we\nfind that at every particular node the untwisting of the mesh into the branches\nof complex eigenvalues in the first approximation is generically determined by\nonly four 2x2 sub-blocks of the perturbing matrix. Selection of the unstable\nmodes that cause self-excited vibrations in the subcritical speed range, is\ngoverned by the exceptional points at the corners of the singular eigenvalue\nsurfaces--`double coffee filter' and `viaduct'--which are associated with the\ncrossings of the unperturbed Campbell diagram with the definite Krein\nsignature. The singularities connect the problems of wave propagation in the\nrotating continua with that of electromagnetic and acoustic wave propagation in\nnon-rotating anisotropic chiral media. As mechanical examples a model of a\nrotating shaft with two degrees of freedom and a continuous model of a rotating\ncircular string passing through the eyelet are studied in detail.\n", "  We introduce the weighted random graph (WRG) model, which represents the\nweighted counterpart of the Erdos-Renyi random graph and provides fundamental\ninsights into more complicated weighted networks. We find analytically that the\nWRG is characterized by a geometric weight distribution, a binomial degree\ndistribution and a negative binomial strength distribution. We also\ncharacterize exactly the percolation phase transitions associated with edge\nremoval and with the appearance of weighted subgraphs of any order and\nintensity. We find that even this completely null model displays a percolation\nbehavior similar to what observed in real weighted networks, implying that edge\nremoval cannot be used to detect community structure empirically. By contrast,\nthe analysis of clustering successfully reveals different patterns between the\nWRG and real networks.\n", "  We survey some of the concepts, methods, and applications of community\ndetection, which has become an increasingly important area of network science.\nTo help ease newcomers into the field, we provide a guide to available\nmethodology and open problems, and discuss why scientists from diverse\nbackgrounds are interested in these problems. As a running theme, we emphasize\nthe connections of community detection to problems in statistical physics and\ncomputational optimization.\n", "  A new generation of (unpolarized) dynamical parton distribution functions of\nthe nucleon is determined. After introducing basic elements of perturbative\nQCD, the dynamical model is discussed and compared with the approach to parton\ndistributions used by most other groups (\"standard\"). Parton distributions sets\n(with uncertainties) at different orders (LO, NLO, NNLO), using different\nfactorization schemes (\\overline{MS}, DIS) and different treatments of heavy\nquark masses (FFNS, VFNS) are extracted and compared. The astrophysical\nimplications of the dynamical predictions are outlined before focusing on\ncollider phenomenology. There, the relevance and perturbative stability of the\nlongitudinal structure function of the nucleon is studied, and the role of\nheavy quark flavors in high-energy colliders is analyzed. In addition, it is\nshown how isospin violations in the nucleon help to explain the so-called\n\"NuTeV anomaly\".\n", "  Experiments on quasistatic crack propagation in gelatin hydrogels reveal a\nnew branching instability triggered by wetting the tip opening with a drop of\naqueous solvent less viscous than the bulk one. We show that the emergence of\nunstable branches results from a balance between the rate of secondary crack\ngrowth and the rate of advection away from a non-linear elastic region of size\n$\\mathcal G/E$ where $\\mathcal G$ is the fracture energy and $E$ the small\nstrain Young modulus. We build a minimal, predictive model that combines\nmechanical characteristics of this mesoscopic region and physical features of\nthe process zone. It accounts for the details of the stability diagram and\nlends support to the idea that non-linear elasticity plays a critical role in\ncrack front instabilities.\n", "  I discuss the scientific rationale and opportunities in the study of high\nenergy particle accelerators away from the Earth; mostly, those outside the\nSolar System. I also briefly outline the features to be desired in telescopes\nused to probe accelerators studied by remote sensing.\n", "  Only one atom thick and not inclined to lattice defects, graphene represents\nthe ultimate crystalline membrane. However, its structure reveals unique\nfeatures not found in other crystalline membranes, in particular the existence\nof ripples with wavelength of 100-300 Angstroms. Here, I trace the origin of\nthis difference to the free electrons in the membrane. The deformation energy\nof the lattice creates a coupling between charge fluctuations and the\nstructure, resulting in ripples on the membrane, correlated with charge\ninhomogeneities. In graphene this mechanism reproduces the experimental result\nfor both charge puddles and ripples.\n", "  The time domain of the sky has been only sparsely explored. Nevertheless,\nrecent discoveries from limited surveys and serendipitous discoveries indicate\nthat there is much to be found on timescales from nanoseconds to years and at\nwavelengths from meters to millimeters. These observations have revealed\nunexpected phenomena such as rotating radio transients and coherent pulses from\nbrown dwarfs. Additionally, archival studies have found not-yet identified\nradio transients without optical or high-energy hosts. In addition to the known\nclasses of radio transients, possible other classes of objects include\nextrapolations from known classes and exotica such as orphan gamma-ray burst\nafterglows, radio supernovae, tidally-disrupted stars, flare stars, magnetars,\nand transmissions from extraterrestrial civilizations.\n  Over the next decade, meter- and centimeter-wave radio telescopes with\nimproved sensitivity, wider fields of view, and flexible digital signal\nprocessing will be able to explore radio transient parameter space more\ncomprehensively and systematically.\n", "  We propose an easy method of calculating the self-energy of semi-infinite\nleads attached to a mesoscopic system.\n", "  PAMELA is a satellite borne experiment designed to study with great accuracy\ncosmic rays of galactic, solar, and trapped nature in a wide energy range\n(protons: 80 MeV-700 GeV, electrons 50 MeV-400 GeV). Main objective is the\nstudy of the antimatter component: antiprotons (80 MeV-190 GeV), positrons (50\nMeV-270 GeV) and search for antimatter with a precision of the order of\n$10^{-8}$). The experiment, housed on board the Russian Resurs-DK1 satellite,\nwas launched on June,\n  15 2006 in a $350\\times 600 km$ orbit with an inclination of 70 degrees. The\ndetector is composed of a series of scintillator counters arranged at the\nextremities of a permanent magnet spectrometer to provide charge,\nTime-of-Flight and rigidity information. Lepton/hadron identification is\nperformed by a Silicon-Tungsten calorimeter and a Neutron detector placed at\nthe bottom of the device. An Anticounter system is used offline to reject false\ntriggers coming from the satellite. In self-trigger mode the Calorimeter, the\nneutron detector and a shower tail catcher are capable of an independent\nmeasure of the lepton component up to 2 TeV. In this work we describe the\nexperiment, its scientific objectives and the performance in its first two\nyears of operation. Data on protons of trapped, secondary and galactic nature -\nas well as measurements of the December 13 2006 Solar Particle Event - are\nprovided.\n", "  In this thesis we investigate the importance of causality in non-perturbative\napproaches to quantum gravity. Firstly, causal sets are introduced as a simple\nkinematical model for causal geometry. It is shown how causal sets could\naccount for the microscopic origin of the Bekenstein entropy bound. Holography\nand finite entropy emerge naturally from the interplay between causality and\ndiscreteness. Going beyond causal set kinematics is problematic however. It is\na hard problem to find the right amplitude to attach to each causal set that\none needs to define the non-perturbative quantum dynamics of gravity. One\napproach which is ideally suited to define the non-perturbative gravitational\npath integral is dynamical triangulation. Without causality this method leads\nto unappealing features of the quantum geometry though. It is shown how\ncausality is instrumental in regulating this pathological behavior. In two\ndimensions this approach of causal dynamical triangulations has been\nanalytically solved by transfer matrix methods. In this thesis considerable\nprogress has been made in the development of more powerful techniques for this\napproach. The formulation through matrix models and a string field theory allow\nus to study interesting generalizations. Particularly, it has become possible\nto define the topological expansion. A surprising twist of the new matrix model\nis that it partially disentangles the large-N and continuum limit. This makes\nour causal model much closer in spirit to the original idea by 't Hooft than\nthe conventional matrix models of non-critical string theory.\n", "  Neutrons and x-rays are coherent probes, and their coherent properties are\nused in scattering experiments. Only coherent scattering probes can elucidate\ncollective molecular motions. While phonons in crystals were studied for half a\ncentury now, the study of collective molecular motions in soft-matter and\nbiology is a rather new but upcoming field. Collective dynamics often determine\nmaterial properties and interactions, and are crucial to establish\ndynamics-function relations. We review properties of neutrons and x-rays and\nderive the origin of coherent and incoherent scattering. Taking molecular\nmotions in membranes and proteins as example, the difference between coherent\nand incoherent dynamics is discussed, and how local and collective motions can\nbe accessed in x-ray and neutron scattering experiments. Matching of coherent\nproperties of the scattering probe may become important in soft-matter and\nbiology because of (1) the missing long ranged order and (2) the large length\nscales involved. It is likely to be important in systems, where fluctuating\nnanoscale domains strongly determine material properties. Inelastic scattering\ncan provide very local structural information in disordered systems. Inelastic\nneutron scattering experiments point to a coexistence of short-lived nanoscale\ngel and fluid domains in phospholipid bilayers in the range of the gel-fluid\nphase transition, which may be responsible for critical behavior and determine\nelastic properties.\n", "  Orthorhombically distorted perovskite manganites, RMnO3 with R being a\ntrivalent rare-earth ion, exhibit a variety of magnetic and electric phases\nincluding multiferroic (i.e. concurrently magnetic and ferroelectric) phases\nand fascinating magnetoelectric phenomena. We theoretically study the phase\ndiagram of RMnO3 by constructing a microscopic spin model, which includes not\nonly the superexchange interaction but also the single-ion anisotropy (SIA) and\nthe Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction (DMI). Analysis of this model using the\nMonte-Carlo method reproduces the experimental phase diagrams as functions of\nthe R-ion radius, which contain two different multiferroic states, i.e. the\nab-plane spin cycloid with ferroelectric polarization P//a and the bc-plane\nspin cycloid with P//c. The orthorhombic lattice distortion or the\nsecond-neighbor spin exchanges enhanced by this distortion exquisitely controls\nthe keen competition between these two phases through tuning the SIA and DMI\nenergies. This leads to a lattice-distortion-induced reorientation of P from a\nto c in agreement with the experiments. We also discuss spin structures in the\nA-type antiferromagnetic state, those in the cycloidal spin states, origin and\nnature of the sinusoidal collinear spin state, and many other issues.\n", "  The entanglement entropy of a pure quantum state of a bipartite system is\ndefined as the von Neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix obtained by\ntracing over one of the two parts. Critical ground states of local Hamiltonians\nin one dimension have an entanglement entropy that diverges logarithmically in\nthe subsystem size, with a universal coefficient that is is related to the\ncentral charge of the associated conformal field theory. Here I will discuss\nrecent extensions of these ideas to a class of quantum critical points with\ndynamic critical exponent $z=2$ in two space dimensions and to 2D systems in a\ntopological phase. The application of these ideas to quantum dimer models and\nfractional quantum Hall states will be discussed.\n", "  These lecture notes introduce some simple effective Hamiltonians (also known\nas semi-empirical models) that have widespread applications to solid state and\nmolecular systems. They are aimed as an introduction to a beginning graduate\nstudent. I also hope that it may help to break down the divide between the\nphysics and chemistry literatures. After a brief introduction to second\nquantisation notation, which is used extensively, I focus of the \"four H's\":\nthe Huckel (or tight binding), Hubbard, Heisenberg and Holstein models. Some\nother related models, such as the Pariser-Parr-Pople model, the extended\nHubbard model, multi-orbital models and the ionic Hubbard model, are also\ndiscussed. Finally, I discuss the epistemological basis of effective\nHamiltonians and compare and contrast this with that of ab initio methods as\nwell as discussing the problem of parametrising effective Hamiltonians.\n", "  We report Molecular Dynamics simulations for a new model of tetrahedral\nnetwork glass-former, based on short-range, spherical potentials. Despite the\nsimplicity of the forcefield employed, our model reproduces some essential\nphysical properties of silica, an archetypal network-forming material.\nStructural and dynamical properties, including dynamic heterogeneities and the\nnature of local rearrangements, are investigated in detail and a direct\ncomparison with models of close-packed, fragile glass-formers is performed. The\noutcome of this comparison is rationalized in terms of the properties of the\nPotential Energy Surface, focusing on the unstable modes of the stationary\npoints. Our results indicate that the weak degree of dynamic heterogeneity\nobserved in network glass-formers may be attributed to an excess of localized\nunstable modes, associated to elementary dynamical events such as bond breaking\nand reformation. On the contrary, the more fragile Lennard-Jones mixtures are\ncharacterized by a larger fraction of extended unstable modes, which lead to a\nmore cooperative and heterogeneous dynamics.\n", "  An updated version of the dust radiation transfer code Sunrise, including\nmodels for star-forming regions and a self-consistent calculation of the\nspatially dependent dust and PAH emission, is presented. Given a hydrodynamic\nsimulation of a galaxy, this model can calculate a realistic 2-dimensional\nultraviolet--submillimeter spectral energy distribution of the galaxy,\nincluding emission lines from HII regions, from any viewpoint. To model the\nemission from star-forming regions, the MAPPINGSIII photoionization code is\nused. The high wavelength resolution (~ 1000 wavelengths) is made possible by\nthe polychromatic Monte-Carlo algorithm employed by Sunrise. From the 2-D\nspectral energy distributions, images in any filter bands or integrated galaxy\nSEDs can be created. Using a suite of hydrodynamic simulations of disc\ngalaxies, the output broad-band images and spectral energy distributions are\ncompared with observed galaxies from the multiwavelength SINGS and SLUGS galaxy\nsurveys. Overall, the output spectral energy distributions show a good match\nwith observed galaxies in colours ranging from GALEX far-UV to SCUBA\nsubmillimeter wavelengths. The only possible exception is the 160 micron/850\nmicron colour, which the simulations underestimate by a factor \"of order 5\"\ncompared to the SINGS sample. However, the simulations here agree with the\nSLUGS galaxies, which consistently have significantly larger amounts of cold\ndust than the SINGS galaxies. The Sunrise model can be used to generate\nsimulated observations of arbitrary hydrodynamic galaxy simulations. In this\nway, predictions of galaxy formation theories can be directly tested against\nobservations of galaxies.\n", "  We report on the capillary rise of water in three-dimensional networks of\nhydrophilic silica pores with 3.5nm and 5nm mean radii, respectively (porous\nVycor monoliths). We find classical square root of time Lucas-Washburn laws for\nthe imbibition dynamics over the entire capillary rise times of up to 16h\ninvestigated. Provided we assume two preadsorbed strongly bound layers of water\nmolecules resting at the silica walls, which corresponds to a negative velocity\nslip length of -0.5nm for water flow in silica nanopores, we can describe the\nfilling process by a retained fluidity and capillarity of water in the pore\ncenter. This anticipated partitioning in two dynamic components reflects the\nstructural-thermodynamic partitioning in strongly silica bound water layers and\ncapillary condensed water in the pore center which is documented by sorption\nisotherm measurements.\n", "  In this chapter, we discuss experiments that realize the discrete nonlinear\nSchr\\\"odinger (DNLS) equations. The relevance of such descriptions arises from\nthe competition of three common features: nonlinearity, dispersion, and a\nmedium to large level of (periodic, quasiperiodic, or random) discreteness in\nspace. DNLS equations have been especially prevalent in atomic and molecular\nphysics in the study of Bose-Einstein condensates in optical lattices or\nsuperlattices; and in nonlinear optics in the description of pulse propagation\nin waveguide arrays and photorefractive crystals. New experiments in both\nnonlinear optics and Bose-Einstein condensation provide new challenges for DNLS\nmodels, and DNLS and related equations have also recently been used to make\nimportant predictions in novel physical settings such as the study of composite\nmetamaterials and arrays of superconducting devices.\n", "  We have developed a contact-free 2-dimensional laser sensor with which the\nposition of wires can be measured in 3 dimensions with an accuracy of better\nthan 10 micrometer and with which the tension of the wires can be determined\nwith an accuracy of 0.04 N. These measurements can be made from a distance of\n15 cm. The sensor consists of commercially available laser pointers, lenses,\ncolor filters and photodiodes. In our application we have used this laser\nsensor together with an automated 3 dimensional coordinate table. For a single\nposition measurement, the laser sensor is moved by the 3-dimensional coordinate\ntable in a plane and determines the coordinates at which the wires intersect\nwith this plane. The position of the plane itself (the third coordinate) is\ngiven by the third axis of the measurement table which is perpendicular to this\nplane. The control and readout of the table and the readout of the laser sensor\nwere realized with LabVIEW. The precision of the position measurement in the\nplane was determined with wires of 0.2 mm and 0.3 mm diameter. We use the\nsensor for the quality assurance of the wire electrode modules for the KATRIN\nneutrino mass experiment. We expect that the precision is at least comparable\nor better if the wires are thinner. Such a device could be well suited for the\nmeasurement of wire chamber geometries even with more than one wire layer.\n", "  Membrane based nanocalorimeters have been developed for ac calorimetry\nexperiments. It has allowed highly sensitive measurements of heat capacity from\nsolid state physics to complex systems like polymers and proteins. In this\narticle we review what has been developed in ac calorimetry toward the\nmeasurement of very small systems. Firstly, at low temperature ac calorimetry\nusing silicon membrane permits the measurement of superconducting sample having\ngeometry down to the nanometer scale. New phase transitions have been found in\nthese nanosystems illustrated by heat capacity jumps versus the applied\nmagnetic field. Secondly, a sensor based on ultra-thin polymer membrane will be\npresented. It has been devoted to thermal measurements of nanomagnetic systems\nat intermediate temperature (20K to 300K). Thirdly, three specific polyimide\nmembrane based sensors have been designed for room temperature measurements.\nOne is devoted to phase transitions detection in polymer, the second one to\nprotein folding/unfolding studies and the third one will be used for the study\nof heat release in living cells. The possibility of measuring systems out of\nequilibrium will be emphasized.\n", "  We present an in-depth analysis of the electronic and vibrational band\nstructure of uniaxially strained graphene by ab-initio calculations. Depending\non the direction and amount of strain, the Fermi crossing moves away from the\n$K$-point. However, graphene remains semimetallic under small strains. The\ndeformation of the Dirac cone near the $K$-point gives rise to a broadening of\nthe 2D Raman mode. In spite of specific changes in the electronic and\nvibrational band structure the strain-induced frequency shifts of the Raman\nactive E2g and 2D modes are independent of the direction of strain. Thus, the\namount of strain can be directly determined from a single Raman measurement.\n", "  Dimensional reduction along time offers a powerful way to study stationary\nsolutions of 4D symmetric supergravity models via group-theoretical methods. We\napply this approach systematically to extremal, BPS and non-BPS, spherically\nsymmetric black holes, and obtain their \"fake superpotential\" W. The latter\nprovides first order equations for the radial problem, governs the mass and\nentropy formula and gives the semi-classical approximation to the radial wave\nfunction. To achieve this goal, we note that the Noether charge for the radial\nevolution must lie in a certain Lagrangian submanifold of a nilpotent orbit of\nthe 3D continuous duality group, and construct a suitable parametrization of\nthis Lagrangian. For general non-BPS extremal black holes in N=8 supergravity,\nW is obtained by solving a non-standard diagonalization problem, which reduces\nto a sextic polynomial in $W^2$ whose coefficients are SU(8) invariant\nfunctions of the central charges. By consistent truncation we obtain W for\nother supergravity models with a symmetric moduli space. In particular, for the\none-modulus $S^3$ model, $W^2$ is given explicitely as the root of a cubic\npolynomial. The STU model is investigated in detail and the nilpotency of the\nNoether charge is checked on explicit solutions.\n", "  We analyzed the performance of Hall sensors with different Co-C ratios,\ndeposited directly in nano-structured form, using $Co_2(CO)_8$ gas molecules,\nby focused electron or ion beam induced deposition. Due to the enhanced\ninter-grain scattering in these granular wires, the Extraordinary Hall Effect\ncan be increased by two orders of magnitude with respect to pure Co, up to a\ncurrent sensitivity of $1 \\Omega/T$. We show that the best magnetic field\nresolution at room temperature is obtained for Co ratios between 60% and 70%\nand is better than $1 \\mu T/Hz^{1/2}$. For an active area of the sensor of $200\n\\times 200 nm^2$, the room temperature magnetic flux resolution is $\\phi_{min}\n= 2\\times10^{-5}\\phi_0$, in the thermal noise frequency range, i.e. above 100\nkHz.\n", "  We report on early results of a numerical and statistical study of binary\nblack hole inspirals. The two black holes are evolved using post-Newtonian\napproximations starting with initially randomly distributed spin vectors. We\ncharacterize certain aspects of the distribution shortly before merger. In\nparticular we note the uniform distribution of black hole spin vector dot\nproducts shortly before merger and a high correlation between the initial and\nfinal black hole spin vector dot products in the equal-mass, maximally spinning\ncase. These simulations were performed on Graphics Processing Units, and we\ndemonstrate a speed-up of a factor 50 over a more conventional CPU\nimplementation.\n", "  We show that correlations inconsistent with any locally causal description\ncan be a generic feature of measurements on entangled quantum states.\nSpecifically, spatially-separated parties who perform local measurements on a\nmaximally-entangled state using randomly chosen measurement bases can, with\nsignificant probability, generate nonclassical correlations that violate a Bell\ninequality. For n parties using a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state, this\nprobability of violation rapidly tends to unity as the number of parties\nincreases. We also show that, even with both a randomly chosen two-qubit pure\nstate and randomly chosen measurement bases, a violation can be found about 10%\nof the time. Amongst other applications, our work provides a feasible\nalternative for the demonstration of Bell inequality violation without a shared\nreference frame.\n", "  The stellar mass in disk galaxies scales approximately with the fourth power\nof the rotation velocity, and the masses of the central black holes in galactic\nnuclei scale approximately with the fourth power of the bulge velocity\ndispersion. It is shown here that these relations can be accounted for if, in a\nforming galaxy with an isothermal mass distribution, gas with a column density\nabove about 8 Msun/pc^2 goes into stars while gas with a column density above\nabout 2 g/cm^2 (10^4 Msun/pc^2) goes into a central black hole. The lower\ncritical value is close to the column density of about 10 Msun/pc^2 at which\natomic gas becomes molecular, and the upper value agrees approximately with the\ncolumn density of about 1 g/cm^2 at which the gas becomes optically thick to\nits cooling radiation. These results are plausible because molecule formation\nis evidently necessary for star formation, and because the onset of a high\noptical depth in a galactic nucleus may suppress continuing star formation and\nfavour the growth of a central black hole.\n", "  GGR News:\n  New Matters of Gravity Correspondents, by David Garfinkle\n  we hear that..., by David Garfinkle\n  Research Briefs:\n  Numerical Relativity Studies of Black Hole Kicks, by Pablo Laguna\n  Conference Reports:\n  AbhayFest, by Chris Beetle\n  Eastern Gravity Meeting, by Jeff Winicour\n  Benasque Workshop on Gravity, by Roberto Emparan and Veronika Hubeny\n  Workshop on the Fluid-Gravity Correspondence, by Mukund Rangamani\n", "  We have presented a novel technique of detecting intermittencies in a\nfinancial time series of the foreign exchange rate data of U.S.- Euro\ndollar(US/EUR) using a combination of both statistical and spectral techniques.\nThis has been possible due to Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) analysis which\nhas been popularly applied to fluctuating data in various fields science and\nengineering and is also being tried out in finance and economics. We have been\nable to qualitatively identify the presence of nonlinearity and chaos in the\ntime series of the foreign exchange rates for US/EURO (United States dollar to\nEuro Dollar) and US/UK (United States dollar to United Kingdom Pound)\ncurrencies. Interestingly we find that for the US-INDIA(United States dollar to\nIndian Rupee) foreign exchange rates, no such chaotic dynamics is observed.\nThis could be a result of the government control over the foreign exchange\nrates, instead of the market controlling them.\n", "  We present results of the implementation of one MILC lattice QCD\napplication-simulation with dynamical clover fermions using the\nhybrid-molecular dynamics R algorithm-on the Cell Broadband Engine processor.\nFifty-four individual computational kernels responsible for 98.8% of the\noverall execution time were ported to the Cell's Synergistic Processing\nElements (SPEs). The remaining application framework, including MPI-based\ndistributed code execution, was left to the Cell's PowerPC processor. We\nobserve that we only infrequently achieve more than 10 GFLOPS with any of the\nkernels, which is just over 4% of the Cell's peak performance. At the same\ntime, many of the kernels are sustaining a bandwidth close to 20 GB/s, which is\n78% of the Cell's peak. This indicates that the application performance is\nlimited by the bandwidth between the main memory and the SPEs. In spite of this\nlimitation, speedups of 8.7x (for 8x8x16x16 lattice) and 9.6x (for 16x16x16x16\nlattice) were achieved when comparing a 3.2 GHz Cell processor to a single core\nof a 2.33 GHz Intel Xeon processor. When comparing the code scaled up to\nexecute on a dual-Cell blade and a quad-core dual-chip Intel Xeon blade, the\nspeedups are 1.5x (8x8x16x16 lattice) and 4.1x (16x16x16x16 lattice).\n", "  We develop a supersymmetric virial expansion for two point correlation\nfunctions of almost diagonal Gaussian Random Matrix Ensembles (ADRMT) of the\northogonal symmetry. These ensembles have multiple applications in physics and\ncan be used to study universal properties of time-reversal invariant disordered\nsystems which are either insulators or close to the Anderson localization\ntransition. We derive a two-level contribution to the correlation functions of\nthe generic ADRMT and apply these results to the critical (multifractal) power\nlaw banded ADRMT. Analytical results are compared with numerical ones.\n", "  We consider the implications of the bond valence model (BVM) description of\ncharge distribution in reduced ceria phases\n(CeO$_{2-x}$)\\cite{Shoko2009,Shoko2009b} to the models used to describe\nelectronic and ionic conductivity in these phases. We conclude that the BVM is\nconsistent with both the small polaron model (SPM) and the atomistic models\nwhich describe the electronic and ionic conductivities respectively. For\nintermediate phases, i.e., $x \\sim 0.3$, we suggest the possibility of low\ntemperature metallic conductivity. This has not yet been experimentally\nobserved. We contrast the BVM results and the conventional description of\ncharge distribution in reduced ceria phases.\n", "  We introduce a imaging modality that works by transiently masking\nimage-subregions during a single exposure of a CCD frame. By offsetting\nsubregion exposure time, temporal information is embedded within each stored\nframe, allowing simultaneous acquisition of a full high spatial resolution\nimage and a high-speed image sequence without increasing bandwidth. The\ntechnique is demonstrated by imaging calcium transients in heart cells at 250\nHz with a 10 Hz megapixel camera.\n", "  Ultra low frequency-ULF (1 Hz or lower), kHz and MHz electromagnetic (EM)\nanomalies were recorded prior to the L'Aquila catastrophic earthquake (EQ) that\noccurred on April 6, 2009. The detected anomalies followed this temporal\nscheme. (i) The MHZ EM anomalies were detected on March 26, 2009 and April 2,\n2009. The kHz EM anomalies were emerged on April, 4 2009. The ULF EM anomaly\nwas continuously recorded from March 29, 2009 up to April 2, 2009. \"Are EQs\npredictable?\" is a question hotly debated in the science community. Its answer\nbegs for another question: \"Are there credible EQ precursors?\". Despite fairly\nabundant circumstantial evidence pre-seismic EM signals have not been\nadequately accepted as real physical quantities. Therefore, the question\neffortlessly arises as to whether the observed anomalies before the L'Aquila EQ\nwere seismogenic or not. The main goal of this work is to provide some insight\ninto this issue.\n", "  Prevalence of cooperation within groups of selfish individuals is puzzling in\nthat it contradicts with the basic premise of natural selection. Favoring\nplayers with higher fitness, the latter is key for understanding the challenges\nfaced by cooperators when competing with defectors. Evolutionary game theory\nprovides a competent theoretical framework for addressing the subtleties of\ncooperation in such situations, which are known as social dilemmas. Recent\nadvances point towards the fact that the evolution of strategies alone may be\ninsufficient to fully exploit the benefits offered by cooperative behavior.\nIndeed, while spatial structure and heterogeneity, for example, have been\nrecognized as potent promoters of cooperation, coevolutionary rules can extend\nthe potentials of such entities further, and even more importantly, lead to the\nunderstanding of their emergence. The introduction of coevolutionary rules to\nevolutionary games implies, that besides the evolution of strategies, another\nproperty may simultaneously be subject to evolution as well. Coevolutionary\nrules may affect the interaction network, the reproduction capability of\nplayers, their reputation, mobility or age. Here we review recent works on\nevolutionary games incorporating coevolutionary rules, as well as give a\ndidactic description of potential pitfalls and misconceptions associated with\nthe subject. In addition, we briefly outline directions for future research\nthat we feel are promising, thereby particularly focusing on dynamical effects\nof coevolutionary rules on the evolution of cooperation, which are still widely\nopen to research and thus hold promise of exciting new discoveries.\n", "  Transient state of femtosecond laser excited bismuth has been studied by\nvarious groups with time-resolved optical, x-ray, and electron probes at the\ndeposited energy density from below through up to several times the equilibrium\nenthalpy of melting. However, the interpretations of the experimental results\nare controversial: the optical probes reveal the absence of transition to the\nmelting phase while the authors of x-ray and electron diffraction experiments\nclaim the observation of ultrafast non-thermal melting. The presented analysis,\nbased on temperature dependence of bismuth optical properties, unequivocally\nshows a purely thermal nature of all the observed fs-laser induced\ntransformations in bismuth.\n", "  We propose a polarimetric method for measuring the tilt angle of the LC\ndirector at an LC layer interface.The method involves the use of an LC cell\noperating in the mode of the total internal reflection of the ordinary wave.\nThe method is based on measuring the angle of the plane of light incidence on\nthe cell with the polarization vector of the extraordinary wave passed through\nthe cell or with the polarization vector of the ordinary wave reflected from\nthe cell. To calculate the tilt angle, the polarization azimuth of the light\nincident on the cell, which induces only the ordinary wave, can be also\nused.The method is applicable throughout the whole range of the LC director\ntilt angles.\n", "  This is a limited review and update of the status of Heavy Flavor Physics.\nAfter we review the flavor problem we discuss a number of topics: recent\npuzzles in purely leptonic D and B decays and their possible resolutions,\nmixing in neutral B and D mesons, the determination of |Vcb| and |Vub| from\nsemileptonic decays, and we conclude with radiative B decays.\n", "  The amplification and equilibration of three-dimensional salt fingers in\nunbounded uniform vertical gradients of temperature and salinity is modeled\nwith a Direct Numerical Simulation in a triply periodic computational domain. A\nfluid dynamics video of the simulation shows that the secondary instability of\nthe fastest growing square-planform finger mode is a combination of the\nwell-known vertical shear instability of two-dimensional fingers [Holyer, 1984]\nand a new horizontal shear mode.\n", "  We present a Non-Equilibrium Green's Function based model for spin torque\ntransfer (STT) devices which provides quantitative agreement with\nexperimentally measured (1) differential resistances, (2) Magnetoresistance\n(MR), (3) In-plane torque and (4) out-of-plane torque over a range of bias\nvoltages, using a single set of three adjustable parameters. We believe this is\nthe first theoretical model that is able to cover this diverse range of\nexperiments and a key aspect of our model is the inclusion of multiple\ntransverse modes. We also provide a simple explanation for the asymmetric bias\ndependence of the in-plane torque, based on the polarization of the two\ncontacts in energy range of transport.\n", "  The risk of systemic war seems dependant on the level of criticality and\nsensitivity of the International System, and the system's conditions. The level\nof criticality and sensitivity is dependant on the developmental stage of the\nInternational System. Initially, following a systemic war, the increase of the\nlevel of criticality and sensitivity go hand in hand. However, at a certain\nstage the sensitivity of the International System for larger sized wars\ndecreases; as a consequence of a network effect, we argue. This network effect\nresults in increased local stability of the System. During this phase the\ncriticality of the International System steadily increases, resulting in a\nrelease deficit. This release deficit facilitates a necessary build up of\nenergy to push the International System, by means of systemic war, into a new\nstability domain. Systemic war is functional in the periodic rebalancing of an\nanarchistic international system.\n", "  Recently a new experimental program of novel systematic studies of light\nhypernuclei using pionic decay was established at JLab (Study of Light\nHypernuclei by Pionic Decay at JLab, JLab Experiment PR-08-012). The highlights\nof the proposed program include high precision measurements of binding energies\nof hypernuclei by using a high resolution pion spectrometer, HpiS. The average\nvalues of binding energies will be determined within an accuracy of ~10 keV or\nbetter. Therefore, the crucial point of this program is an absolute calibration\nof the HpiS with accuracy 10E-4 or better. The merging of continuous wave\nlaser-based precision optical-frequency metrology with mode-locked ultrafast\nlasers has led to precision control of the visible frequency spectrum produced\nby mode-locked lasers. Such a phase-controlled mode-locked laser forms the\nfoundation of an optical clock or femtosecond optical frequency comb (OFC)\ngenerator, with a regular comb of sharp lines with well defined frequencies.\nCombination of this technique with a recently developed radio frequency (RF)\nphototube results in a new tool for precision time measurement. We are\nproposing a new time-of-flight (TOF) system based on an RF phototube and OFC\ntechnique. The proposed TOF system achieves 10 fs instability level and opens\nnew possibilities for precise measurements in nuclear physics such as an\nabsolute calibration of magnetic spectrometers within accuracy 10E-4 - 10E-5.\n", "  Recent advances in theory and computational experiments have shown the need\nto refine the previous categorisation of magnetic reconnection at\nthree-dimensional null points -- points at which the magnetic field vanishes.\nWe propose here a division into three different types, depending on the nature\nof the flow near the spine and fan of the null. The spine is an isolated field\nline which approaches the null (or recedes from it), while the fan is a surface\nof field lines which recede from it (or approach it).\n  So-called \"torsional spine reconnection\" occurs when field lines in the\nvicinity of the fan rotate, with current becoming concentrated along the spine,\nso that nearby field lines undergo rotational slippage. In \"torsional fan\nreconnection\" field lines near the spine rotate and create a current that is\nconcentrated in the fan with a rotational flux mismatch and rotational\nslippage. In both of these regimes, the spine and fan are perpendicular and\nthere is no flux transfer across spine or fan. The third regime, called\n\"spine-fan reconnection\", is the most common in practice and combines elements\nof the previous spine and fan models. In this case, in response to a generic\nshearing motion, the null point collapses to form a current sheet that is\nfocused at the null itself, in a sheet that locally spans both the spine and\nfan. In this regime the spine and fan are no longer perpendicular and there is\nflux transfer across both of them.\n", "  In this paper we present theoretical studies of spin dependent transport in\nFe/Cr/MgO/Fe tunnel junctions with non-collinear alignment of magnetizations of\nmetallic layers comprising these MTJs. Calculations are performed with use of\nnon-equilibrium Green function technique in the framework of Keldysh formalism.\nWKB approximation is used for wave and Green functions in the trapezoidal\nbarrier region under applied voltage. Electronic structure of ferromagnetic\nelectrodes is modeled with two bands model, i.e. with majority s-electrons and\nminority d-holes. Furthermore, we introduce s-d hybridization by calculating\nthe corresponding perturbation corrections for the wave and Green functions.\n", "  If, in a system of identical particles, the one particle state is defined by\nthe partial trace to one of the component spaces of the total Hilbert space,\nthen all one particle states are identical. The particles are\nindistinguishable. This is often thought to be a typical quantum mechanical\nphenomenon. I will show however that an analogous procedure to define particle\nstates exists in classical mechanics, which results in classical\nindistinguishable identical particles. From this analogy it follows that the\nindistinguishability of identical particles depends on how we define particle\nstates. It is not an inevitable result of the symmetry postulate.\n  Indeed, if particles are defined by partial traces, consistent use of the\nsymmetry postulate leads to the conclusion that all identical particles in the\nuniverse are indistinguishable, so that particles can never be pointed at, not\neven in the classical limit. This does not correspond to the way the term\nparticle is actually used in practice. I will argue that a particle should be\ndefined in such a way that in the classical limit the quantum particle state\nbecomes the state of a classical particle. This will lead us to a definition of\nparticles which is in line with the way the term particle is actually used by\nphysicists.\n", "  Recent discoveries, as well as open questions, in experimentally realized\ncorrelated electron materials are reviewed. In particular, high temperature\nsuperconductivity in the cuprates and in the recently discovered iron\npnictides, possible chiral p-wave superconductivity in strontium ruthenate, the\nsearch for quantum spin liquid behavior in real materials, and new experimental\ndiscoveries in topological insulators are discussed.\n", "  A detailed chemical composition analysis based on a high-resolution\n(R=35,000) CCD spectrum is presented for a newly discovered post-AGB star in\nthe globular cluster M79 for the first time. The elemental abundance results of\nM79 Post-AGB star are found to be [C/Fe]=-0.7, [O/Fe]=+1.4, [alpha-\nprocess/Fe]=0.5, and [s-process/Fe]=-0.1. The surprising result is that the\niron abundance of the star is apparently about 0.6 dex less than that of the\ncluster's red giants as reported by published studies including a recent\nhigh-resolution spectroscopic analysis by Carretta and colleagues.\n", "  Adaptive control technique is adopted to synchronize two identical\nnon-autonomous systems with unknown parameters in finite time. A virtual\nunknown parameter is introduced in order to avoid the unknown parameters from\nappearing in the controllers and parameters update laws. The Duffing equation\nand a gyrostat system are chosen as the numerical examples to show the validity\nof the present method.\n", "  In this second paper of the series on the coherence of wave packets, we study\nneutrinos in high energy experiments where neutrinos are produced by decays of\npions or muons which are described using wave packets. The space time position\nwhere one neutrino is produced is not fixed to one value but is extended in\nmacroscopic area. Hence the amplitude is defined by a superposition of the\namplitudes of different neutrino's production time in the macroscopic region\nand depends on the absolute value of the neutrino mass. We analyze neutrino\ninterference based on operator product expansion near the light cone and find a\nnew universal term in the time dependent neutrino probability. This new term\nhas an origin in higher order quantum effect in a similar manner as axial\nanomaly. Roles of Lorentz invariance and the operator product expansion in the\nlight-cone region are clarified and a possibility of measuring the absolute\nvalue of neutrino mass from neutrino interference experiments is pointed out.\n", "  This paper proposes a novel, simple and minimally invasive method for stroke\nvolume variation assessment using arterial blood pressure measurements. The\narterial blood pressure signal is reconstructed using a semi-classical signal\nanalysis method allowing the computation of a parameter, called the first\nsystolic invariant INVS1. We show that INVS1 is linearly related to stroke\nvolume. To validate this approach, a statistical comparaison between INVS1 and\nstroke volume measured with the PiCCO technique was performed during a 15-mn\nrecording in 21 mechanically ventilated patients in intensive care. In 94% of\nthe whole recordings, a strong correlation was estimated by cross-correlation\nanalysis (mean coefficient=0.9) and linear regression (mean coefficient=0.89).\nOnce the linear relation had been verified, a Bland-Altman test showed the very\ngood agreement between the two approaches and their interchangeability. For the\nremaining 6%, INVS1 and the PiCCO stroke volume were not correlated at all, and\nthis discrepancy, interpreted with the help of mean pressure, heart rate and\nperipheral vascular resistances, was in favor of INVS1.\n", "  We demonstrate how to explicitly calculate the QED path integral and\nassociated Green functions, exactly, in curved spacetime, with retention of the\nboundary terms, to infinite order, for any and all spacetime manifolds with\nsufficient symmetry to admit the application of Pontryagin duality as a form of\nharmonic analysis. In the process we show how gauge symmetry itself greatly\nfacilitates the ability to conduct harmonic analysis in curved spacetime and to\ndo exact calculations with Pontryagin duality. We also show how non-Abelian,\nYang-Mills gauge theories emerge naturally, if somewhat surprisingly, from this\nanalysis.\n", "  We study elementary excitations in superfluid helium-4 employing an approach\nbased on the spontaneous symmetry breaking. In particular, we calculate the\nroton energy gap at zero temperature $\\Delta (0)$. The relation that we have\nderived is $\\Delta (0) / k_B T_\\lambda = 4$. The theoretical value of $\\Delta\n(0)/k_B$ is 8.707 K, which is significantly close to the experimental value of\n8.712 K. The deviation between the theoretical and experimental values is less\nthan 0.1%.\n", "  A SASE FEL facility was first proposed in Feasibility Report of the TAC\n(Turkish Accelerator Center) project in 2000. Conceptual Design Report (CDR) of\nthe project was completed in 2005. Technical Design Report (TDR) studies of TAC\nwere started in 2006 in frame of an inter universities project with support of\nState Planning Organization (SPO) of Turkey. Main goal of the SASE FEL proposal\nis to cover VUV and soft X-rays region of the spectrum besides IR-FEL,\nBremsstrahlung and Synchrotron Radiation proposals of TAC. Up to now,\noptimization studies based on a special RF linac or an Energy Recovery Linac\n(ERL) for the SASE FEL facility, were completed. Today, ERLs provide a powerful\nbroad range of applications like: electron cooling devices, high average\nbrightness, high power FELs, short-pulse radiation sources and high luminosity\ncolliders. In this study, main parameters for two linac options and SASE FEL\nare given.\n", "  The TAC (Turkish Accelerator Center) IR FEL Oscillator facility, which has\nbeen supported by Turkish State Planning Organization (SPO) since 2006, will be\nbased on a 15-40 MeV electron linac accompanying two different undulators with\n2.5 cm and 9 cm periods in order to obtain IR FEL ranging between 2-250\nmicrons. The electron linac will consist of two sequenced modules, each housing\ntwo 9-cell superconducting TESLA cavities for cw operation. It is planned that\nthe TAC IR FEL facility will be completed in 2012 at Golbasi campus of Ankara\nUniversity. This facility will give an opportunity to the scientists and\nindustry to use FEL in research and development in Turkey and our region. In\nthis study, the results of optimization studies and present plans about\nconstruction process of the facility are presented.\n", "  Chaotic dynamical systems with two or more attractors lying on invariant\nsubspaces may, provided certain mathematical conditions are fulfilled, exhibit\nintermingled basins of attraction: Each basin is riddled with holes belonging\nto basins of the other attractors. In order to investigate the occurrence of\nsuch phenomenon in dynamical systems of ecological interest (two-species\ncompetition with extinction) we have characterized quantitatively the\nintermingled basins using periodic-orbit theory and scaling laws. The latter\nresults agree with a theoretical prediction from a stochastic model, and also\nwith an exact result for the scaling exponent we derived for the specific class\nof models investigated. We discuss the consequences of the scaling laws in\nterms of the predictability of a final state (extinction of either species) in\nan ecological experiment.\n", "  We investigate the evolution of open quantum systems in the presence of\ninitial correlations with an environment. Here the standard formalism of\ndescribing evolution by completely positive trace preserving (CPTP) quantum\noperations can fail and non-completely positive (non-CP) maps may be observed.\n  A new classification of correlations between a system and environment using\nquantum discord is explored. However, we find quantum discord is not a\nsymmetric quantity between exchange of systems and this leads to ambiguity in\nclassifications - states which are both quantum and classically correlated\ndepending on the order of the two systems.\n  State preparation in quantum process tomography is investigated with regard\nto non-CP maps. In SQPT the preparation procedure can influence the\ncomplete-positivity of the reconstructed quantum operation if our system is\ninitially correlated with an environment. We examine a recently proposed\npreparation procedures using projective measurements, and propose our own\nprotocol that uses a single measurement followed by unitary rotations. The\nformer can give rise to non-CP evolution while the later will always give rise\nto a CP map. State preparation in AAPT was found always to give rise to CP\nevolution.\n  We examine the effect of statistical noise in process tomography and find it\ncan result in the identification of a non-CP when the evolution should be CP.\nThe variance of the distribution for reconstructed processes is found to be\ninversely proportional to the number of copies of a state used to perform\ntomography. Finally, we detail an experiment using currently available linear\noptics QC devices to demonstrate non-CP maps arising in SQPT.\n", "  We use point contact Andreev reflection measurements to determine the spin\npolarization of the transport current in pulse laser deposited thin films of\nZnO with 1% Al and with and without 2%Mn. Only films with Mn are ferromagnetic\nand show spin polarization of the transport current of up to 55 $\\pm$ 0.5% at\n4.2 K, in sharp contrast to measurements of the nonmagnetic films without Mn\nwhere the polarization is consistent with zero. Our results imply strongly that\nferromagnetism in these Al doped ZnO films requires the presence of Mn.\n", "  The transverse and longitudinal Doppler effects of the sunbeam spectra are\nshown to result in the earth parameters such as the earth-self rotation and\nrevolution velocities, the earth orbit semi-major axis, the earth orbital\nangular momentum, the earth axial tilt, the earth orbit eccentricity, the local\nlatitude and the mass of the sun. The sunbeam global positioning scheme is\nrealized, including the earth orbital position.\n  PACS numbers: 91.10.Fc, 95.10.Km, 91.10.Da, 91.10.Jf.\n", "  Stimulated Raman interaction of a classically pumped single three-level\n$\\Lambda$-type atom in a resonator cavity featuring both radiative and unwanted\nlosses is studied. It is shown that in the regime of stimulated adiabatic Raman\npassage the excited outgoing wave packet of the cavity-assisted electromagnetic\nfield can be prepared in a one-photon Fock state with high efficiency. In this\nregime, the spatio-temporal shape of the wave packet does not depend on the\ninteraction shape of the pump field, provided that the interaction of the atom\nwith the pump is time-delayed with respect to the interaction of the atom with\nthe cavity-assisted field. Therefore, the scheme can be used to generate a\nsequence of identical radiation pulses each of almost one-photon Fock state. It\nis further shown that the spatio-temporal shape of the outgoing wave packet can\nbe manipulated by controlling the time of interaction between the atom and the\ncavity-assisted electromagnetic field.\n", "  We introduce a class of k-potential submanifolds in pseudo-Euclidean spaces\nand prove that for an arbitrary positive integer k and an arbitrary nonnegative\ninteger p, each N-dimensional Frobenius manifold can always be locally realized\nas an N-dimensional k-potential submanifold in ((k + 1) N + p)-dimensional\npseudo-Euclidean spaces of certain signatures. For k = 1 this construction was\nproposed by the present author in a previous paper (2006). The realization of\nconcrete Frobenius manifolds is reduced to solving a consistent linear system\nof second-order partial differential equations.\n", "  Local magnetization hysteresis is among the most extensively studied features\nof high-temperature superconductors (HTSC). The usual source of hysteresis in\nsuperconductors is bulk vortex pinning due to material defects. Two additional\nknown mechanisms of magnetic irreversibility are the Bean-Livingston surface\nbarrier and the geometrical barrier (GB). GB arises due to a competition\nbetween the line energy of a vortex penetrating into the sample and the Lorentz\nforce of Meissner currents which focuses vortices in the sample's center to\nform a dome-shaped vortex distribution. This work demonstrates that dc in-plane\nfield overcomes hysteresis mainly through the GB suppression in a region of\nphase diagram under consideration (high temperatures and low fields).\n", "  Analytical time-dependent functions describing the change of the\nconcentration of the solvent S(t) and the homeopathic active substance A(t)\nduring the decimal and centesimal dilution are derived. The function S(t) is a\nspecial case of the West-Brown-Enquist curve describing the ontogenic growth,\nhence the increase in concentration of the solvent during potentization\nresembles the growth of biological systems. It is proven that the macroscopic\nS(t) function is the ground state solution of the microscopic non-local\nHorodecki-Feinberg equation for the time-dependent Hulthen potential at the\ncritical screening. In consequence the potentization belongs to the class of\nquasi-quantum phenomena playing an important role both in the biological\nsystems and homeopathy. A comparison of the model proposed with recently\nperformed experiment on delayed luminescence of the homeopathic remedy will be\nalso made.\n", "  Study design Are there neuro-anatomical abnormalities associated with\nidiopathic scoliosis (IS)? Posterior Basicranium (PBA) reflects cerebellum\ngrowth and contains vestibular organs, two structures suspected to be involved\nin scoliosis. Objective The aim of this study was to compare posterior\nbasicranium asymmetry (PBA) in Idiopathic scoliosis (IS) and normal subjects.\n  Method: To measure the shape of PBA in 3D, we defined an intra-cranial frame\nof reference based on CNS and guided by embryology of the neural tube.\nMeasurements concerned three directions of space referred to a specific intra\ncranial referential. Data acquisition was performed with T2 MRI (G.E. Excite\n1.5T, mode Fiesta). We explored a scoliosis group of 76 women and 20 men with a\nmean age of 17, 2 and a control group of 26 women and 16 men, with a mean age\nof 27, 7.\n  Results: IS revealed a significant asymmetry of PBA (Pr>|t|<.0001) in 3\ndirections of space compared to the control group. This asymmetry was more\npronounced in antero-posterior (AP) and lateral direction, forming a torque of\nthe posterior base shape associated with identical cerebellar torque.\n", "  The role of dipolar interactions among Ni nanoparticles (NP) embedded in an\namorphous SiO2/C matrix with different concentrations has been studied\nperforming ac magnetic susceptibility Chi_ac measurements. For very diluted\nsamples, with Ni concentrations < 4 wt % Ni or very weak dipolar interactions,\nthe data are well described by the Neel-Arrhenius law. Increasing Ni\nconcentration to values up to 12.8 wt % Ni results in changes in the\nNeel-Arrhenius behavior, the dipolar interactions become important, and need to\nbe considered to describe the magnetic response of the NPs system. We have\nfound no evidence of a spin-glasslike behavior in our Ni NP systems even when\ndipolar interactions are clearly present.\n", "  We present in this Letter a free-energy approach to the dynamics of a fluid\nnear a nanostructured surface. The model accounts both for the static phase\nequilibrium in the vicinity of the surface (wetting angles, Cassie-Wenzel\ntransition) and the dynamical properties like liquid slippage at the boundary.\nThis method bridges the gap between phenomenological phase-field approaches and\nmore macroscopic lattice-Boltzmann models.\n", "  Electron transfer processes at molecule-semiconductor interfaces involve a\ncomplex mixture of thermionic, tunneling and hopping events. Traditionally\nthese processes have been modeled in a piece-meal fashion, relying on\nphenomenological treatments such as Simmons and Richardson equations that are\nnot vetted in atomistic systems and do not flow seamlessly into each other. We\npresent a unified modeling approach, based on the Non-equilibrium Greens\nfunction (NEGF) formalism that allows us to integrate diverse transport regimes\nand establish a comprehensive quantitative theory. By comparing our simulations\nwith experiments on a metal-molecule-semiconductor junction (varying molecular\nlengths ~1-3nm), we identify the role of molecular monolayers in tuning the\nsemiconductor band-bending, and thereby overall device conductivity. We find\nthat the principal role of molecules is to act as a voltage divider, altering\nthe Schottky barriers, thereby modulating current levels, voltage-asymmetries\nand crossover from Schottky to tunneling transport. While this provides an\nappealingly simple explanation for our observed experimental trends, the\ncalculated shifts in crossover voltages are insufficient to explain the\nexperiments quantitatively. Quantitative correspondence with experiments\nrequires invocation of an additional voltage divider arising from molecular\ndipoles that further tunes semiconductor band-bending. The extracted dipole\nmoments are rationalized using ab-initio calculations for each molecule,\nalong-with a dilution of packing fraction for the shortest molecular lengths.\nThe methodology described herein can be used to better understand and predict\ntransport characteristics of such junctions.\n", "  Expressing the Wigner distribution function in Dirac notation reveals its\nresemblance to a classical trajectory in phase space.\n", "  We measure the torque acting on a rod rotated perpendicular to its axis in a\ngranular bed, through which an upflow of gas is utilized to tune the\nhydrostatic loading between grains. At low rotation rates the torque is\nindependent of speed, but scales quadratically with rod-length and linearly\nwith depth; the proportionality approaches zero linearly as the upflow of gas\nis increased towards a critical value above which the grains are fluidized. At\nhigh rotation rates the torque exhibits quadratic rate- dependence and scales\nas the rod's length to the 4th power. The torque has no dependence on either\ndepth or airflow at these higher rates. A model used to describe the stopping\nforce experienced by a projectile impacting a granular bed can be shown to\npredict these behaviors for our system's geometry, indicating that the same\nmechanics dictate both steady-state and transient drag forces in granular\nsystems, regardless of geometry or material properties of the grains.\n", "  Utilizing data available from the Kentucky Geonet (KYGeonet.ky.gov) the\nfossil fuel mining locations created by the Kentucky Geological Survey\ngeo-locating oil and gas wells are mapped using ESRI ArcGIS in Kentucky single\nplain 1602 ft projection. This data was then exported into a spreadsheet\nshowing latitude and longitude for each point to be used for modeling at\ndifferent scales to determine the fractal dimension of the set. Following the\nporosity and diffusivity studies of Tarafdar and Roy1 we extract fractal\ndimensions of the fossil fuel mining locations and search for evidence of\nscaling laws for the set of deposits. The Levy index is used to determine a\nmatch to a statistical mechanically motivated generalized probability function\nfor the wells. This probability distribution corresponds to a solution of a\ndynamical anomalous diffusion equation of fractional order that describes the\nLevy paths which can be solved in the diffusion limit by the Fox H function\nansatz.\n", "  We present results of our pulsar population synthesis of normal pulsars from\nthe Galactic disk using our previously developed Monte-Carlo code. From our\nstudies of observed radio pulsars that have clearly identifiable core and cone\ncomponents, in which we fit the polarization sweep as well as the pulse\nprofiles in order to constrain the viewing geometry, we develop a model\ndescribing the luminosity and ratio of radio core-to-cone peak fluxes. In this\nmodel, short period pulsars are more cone-dominated. We explore models of\nneutron star evolution with and without magnetic field decay, and with\ndifferent initial period distributions. We present preliminary results\nincluding simulated population statistics that are compared with the observed\nradio pulsar population. The evolved neutron star populations resulting from\nthis simulation can be used to model distributions of gamma-ray pulsars for\ncomparison to Fermi results.\n", "  A new type of resonant light absorption by a small particle (nanocluster) is\nreported. The problem cannot be described within the commonly used dipole\nscattering approximation and should be studied with methods based upon the\nexact Mie solution. It is shown that the absorption cross-section has giant\nmaxima realized at small values of the imaginary part of the complex dielectric\npermittivity of the particle. The maxima are situated in the vicinity of the\nplasmon (polariton) resonances and correspond to the regions where the\ndissipative damping equals the radiative one. The case is similar to the\nrecently introduced anomalous scattering [PRL vol. 97, 263902 (2006)] and\nexhibits similar peculiarities.\n", "  We have measured the variation of the spontaneous emission rate with\npolarization for self-assembled single quantum dots in two-dimensional photonic\ncrystal membranes. We observe a maximum anisotropy factor of 6 between the\ndecay rates of the two bright exciton states. This large anisotropy is\nattributed to the substantially different projected local density of optical\nstates for differently oriented dipoles in the photonic crystal.\n", "  We demonstrate a technique for simultaneously measuring each component of the\nforce vectors and mobility tensor of a small collection of colloidal particles\nbased on observing a set of particle trajectories. For a few-body system of\nmicron-sized polymer beads in oil separated by several particle radii, we find\nthat the mobility tensor is well-described by a pairwise Stokeslet model. This\nstands in contrast to the electrostatic interactions, which were found to\ndeviate significantly from a pairwise model. The measurement technique\npresented here should be simple to extend to systems of heterogeneous,\nnon-spherical particles arranged in arbitrary 3D geometries.\n", "  There is described the design of the FODS hadron calorimeters, the procedure\nof the calibration and the results of the calorimeter study with electron and\npion beams.\n", "  The discovery of cosmic radio emission by Karl Jansky in the course of\nsearching for the source of interference to telephone communications and the\ninstrumental advances which followed, have led to a series of new paradigm\nchanging astronomical discoveries. These discoveries, which to a large extent\ndefine much of modern astrophysical research were the result of the right\npeople being in the right place at the right time using powerful new\ninstruments, which in many cases they had designed and built. They were not the\nresult of trying to test any particular theoretical model or trying to answer\npreviously posed questions, but they opened up whole new areas of exploration\nand discovery. Rather many important discoveries came from military or\ncommunications research; others while looking for something else; and yet\nothers from just looking. Traditionally, the designers of big telescopes\ninvariably did not predict what the telescopes would ultimately be known for.\nThe place in history of the next generation of telescopes will not likely be\nfound in the science case created to justify their construction, but in the\nunexpected new phenomena, new theories, and new ideas which will emerge from\nthese discoveries. It is important that those who are in a position to filter\nresearch proposals and plans not dismiss as butterfly collecting,\ninvestigations which explore new areas without having predefined the result\nthey are looking for. Progress must also allow for new discoveries, as well as\nfor the explanation of old discoveries. New telescopes need to be designed with\nthe flexibility to make new discoveries which will invariably raise new\nquestions and new problems.\n", "  The results of a comprehensive study on the YBa_2Cu_3O_{6.53} oxide subjected\nto \"mild\" hydration (exposure at small values of pH2O) by a special technique\nhave been reported. The material modified in this way acquires an interesting\nproperty; namely, in natural conditions it intensively absorbs large quantities\nof components (H2O and CO2) comprising the gas atmosphere. Arguments have been\nadduced that at least the water enters the crystal lattice of the\nyttrium-barium cuprate. This lattice is in the two-phase (tetragonal and\northorhombic) state: testing of the magnetic properties of the oxide has\nrevealed the presence of antiferromagnetic and diamagnetic regions in this\nmaterial.\n", "  The goal of the work was to study the role of GC alternative dimmers in the\nbinding of DNA with Ni (II) ions. The method of ultraviolet difference\nspectroscopy has been applied to investigate Ni (II) ions interactions with DNA\nextracted from Clostridium perfringens, Mice liver (C3HA line), Calf thymus,\nSalmon sperm, Herring sperm, E.coli, Micrococcus luteus and polynucleotides\nPoly (dA-dT)xPoly (dA-dT), Poly (dG)x Poly (dC), Poly (dG-dC)xPoly (dG-dC). It\nis shown that Ni (II) ions at outer-spherical binding with DNA double helix\nfrom the side of the major groove choose more stable dimmers 3^'-C-G-5^'\n  . . 5^'-G-C-3^' and get bound with N7 atoms of both guanines in dimmer\nforming G-G interstrand crosslink. It directly correlates to the process of\nforming point defects of Watson-Crick wrong pair type (creation of rare\nketo-enolic and amino-imino tautomeric forms) and depurinization.\n", "  In the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model with conserved R-parity, the\ndecays of the next-to-lightest neutralino into the lightest neutralino and two\nleptons are always involved in each supersymmetric particle decay chain. In\nthis thesis we calculate one-loop corrections to the two-body decays of the\nnext-to-lightest neutralino into a lepton and a slepton, which again decays\ninto another lepton and the lightest neutralino. We also investigate a scenario\nwhere the next-to-lightest neutralino can undergo three-body decays. Not only\nthe branching ratios of leptonic decay modes, but also the dilepton invariant\nmass distribution, are studied. Its endpoint is often used to reconstruct\nmass-differences of supersymmetric particles. At one-loop level the branching\nratios of these leptonic decays are increased significantly and the shape of\ndilepton invariant mass distribution is altered by the hard photon emission.\n", "  We study bi-Hamiltonian systems of hydrodynamic type with non-singular\n(semisimple) non-local bi-Hamiltonian structures and prove that such systems of\nhydrodynamic type are diagonalizable. Moreover, we prove that for an arbitrary\nnon-singular (semisimple) non-locally bi-Hamiltonian system of hydrodynamic\ntype, there exist local coordinates (Riemann invariants) such that all the\nrelated matrix differential-geometric objects, namely, the matrix V^i_j(u) of\nthis system of hydrodynamic type, the metrics g^{ij}_1(u) and g^{ij}_2(u) and\nthe affinors (w_{1, n})^i_j(u) and (w_{2,n})^i_j(u) of the non-singular\nnon-local bi-Hamiltonian structure of this system, are diagonal in these local\ncoordinates. The proof is a natural consequence of the general results of the\ntheory of compatible metrics and the theory of non-local bi-Hamiltonian\nstructures developed earlier by the present author.\n", "  When the Moon was formed it was much closer to the Earth than it is today. It\njust needed about 20 days then to go around the Earth. Now it takes the Moon\n29.5 days to make one revolution. In order to follow the conservation of\nangular momentum the Moon had to either move closer to the Earth or recede from\nEarth. The data from the Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment confirms it to be\nmoving away and the velocity of recession of the Moon have been found to be 3.8\ncm/year. This rate is not constant though. At present the Moon's orbit has a\nradius of 384,000km. But what is not yet known to all is that the orbital\nmotion of the moon is actually a spiral motion. The moon is spiralling out and\na very simple mathematical equation can describe the actual spiral motion of\nthe Moon. The generalisation of this differential equation is the basic aim of\nthis paper here.\n", "  In this article, we discuss metal-protein interactions in the Ag-lysozyme\ncomplex by spectroscopic measurements. The analysis of the variation in\nrelative intensities of SERS bands reveal the orientation and the change in\nconformation of the protein molecules on the Ag surface with time. The\ninteraction kinetics of metal-protein complexes has been analyzed over a period\nof three hours via both Raman and absorption measurements. Our analysis\nindicates that the Ag nanoparticles most likely interact with Trp-123 which is\nin close proximity to Phe-34 of the lysozyme molecule.\n", "  Motivated by subdiffusive motion of bio-molecules observed in living cells we\nstudy the stochastic properties of a non-Brownian particle whose motion is\ngoverned by either fractional Brownian motion or the fractional Langevin\nequation and restricted to a finite domain. We investigate by analytic\ncalculations and simulations how time-averaged observables (e.g., the time\naveraged mean squared displacement and displacement correlation) are affected\nby spatial confinement and dimensionality. In particular we study the degree of\nweak ergodicity breaking and scatter between different single trajectories for\nthis confined motion in the subdiffusive domain. The general trend is that\ndeviations from ergodicity are decreased with decreasing size of the movement\nvolume, and with increasing dimensionality. We define the displacement\ncorrelation function and find that this quantity shows distinct features for\nfractional Brownian motion, fractional Langevin equation, and continuous time\nsubdiffusion, such that it appears an efficient measure to distinguish these\ndifferent processes based on single particle trajectory data.\n", "  With references to recent observational results on the nebula IC59, we\napplied our previously developed Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code\nwhich is based on Radiative Driven Implosion (RDI) model, to investigate the\npossible formation mechanism for the observed morphological structures of\ndifferently shaped BRCs. The simulation results confirmed the existence of the\n4th type morphology of BRCs -- type M BRC. We are able to find the necessary\ncondition for the appearance of the type M BRC based on the fact that the\nsimulated physical properties of the cloud are consistent with observations on\nIC59. More importantly, the prospect of RDI triggered star formation by RDI\nmodel in all of the observed type M BRCs is ruthlessly eliminated.\n", "  We analyze results of data processing of observations of well-known object\ntitled SS433 with the VLBA during more than 10 years. Data have been processed\nwith the software project titled 'Astro Space Locator' (ASL for Windows). The\nMulti Frequency Synthesis (MFS) method has been used for reconstruction of\nradio maps at 18 and 6 centimeter wavelength ranges (L and C ranges). High\nquality images of SS433 for several epochs are presented. Evolution of its\nradio structure is demonstrated. Astrophysical parameters of object and their\nchanges in time are discussed. Any polarization phenomena are not taken into\naccount. We present results of processing of data of RR polarization for all\nthe observational sessions\n", "  Stars in globular clusters are generally believed to have all formed at the\nsame time, early in the Galaxy's history. 'Blue stragglers' are stars massive\nenough that they should have evolved into white dwarfs long ago. Two possible\nmechanisms have been proposed for their formation: mass transfer between binary\ncompanions and stellar mergers resulting from direct collisions between two\nstars. Recently, the binary explanation was claimed to be dominant. Here we\nreport that there are two distinct parallel sequences of blue stragglers in\nM30. This globular cluster is thought to have undergone 'core collapse', during\nwhich both the collision rate and the mass transfer activity in binary systems\nwould have been enhanced. We suggest that the two observed sequences arise from\nthe cluster core collapse, with the bluer population arising from direct\nstellar collisions and the redder one arising from the evolution of close\nbinaries that are probably still experiencing an active phase of mass transfer.\n", "  First solid state quantum computer was built using transmons (cooper pair\nboxes). The operation of the computer is limited because of using a number of\nthe rigit cooper boxes working with fixed frequency at temperatures of\nsuperconducting material. Here, we propose a novel architecture of quantum\ncomputer based on a flexible wire circuit of many coupled quantum nodes\ncontaining controlled atomic (molecular) ensembles. We demonstrate wide\nopportunities of the proposed computer. Firstly, we reveal a perfect storage of\nexternal photon qubits to multi-mode quantum memory node and demonstrate a\nreversible exchange of the qubits between any arbitrary nodes. We found optimal\nparameters of atoms in the circuit and self quantum modes for quantum\nprocessing. The predicted perfect storage has been observed experimentally for\nmicrowave radiation on the lithium phthalocyaninate molecule ensemble. Then\nalso, for the first time we show a realization of the efficient basic two-qubit\ngate with direct coupling of two arbitrary nodes by using appropriate atomic\nfrequency shifts in the circuit nodes. Proposed two-qubit gate runs with a\nspeed drastically accelerated proportionally to the number of atoms in the\nnode. The direct coupling and accelerated two-qubit gate can be realized for\nlarge number of the circuit nodes. Finally, we describe two and\nthree-dimensional scalable architectures that pave the road to construction of\nuniversal multi-qubit quantum computer operating at room temperatures.\n", "  We study the nonlinear driven response and sliding friction behavior of the\nphase-field-crystal (PFC) model with pinning including both thermal\nfluctuations and inertial effects. The model provides a continuous description\nof adsorbed layers on a substrate under the action of an external driving force\nat finite temperatures, allowing for both elastic and plastic deformations. We\nderive general stochastic dynamical equations for the particle and momentum\ndensities including both thermal fluctuations and inertial effects. The\nresulting coupled equations for the PFC model are studied numerically. At\nsufficiently low temperatures we find that the velocity response of an\ninitially pinned commensurate layer shows hysteresis with dynamical melting and\nfreezing transitions for increasing and decreasing applied forces at different\ncritical values. The main features of the nonlinear response in the PFC model\nare similar to the results obtained previously with molecular dynamics\nsimulations of particle models for adsorbed layers.\n", "  One of the main goals of the ATLAS detector at the LHC of CERN, a\nproton-proton collider with a nominal centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV, is to\nsearch for New Physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). A widely favoured BSM\ncandidate is Supersymmetry (SUSY), which postulates a superpartner for each\nStandard Model particle. The first part of this thesis describes a strategy for\nan early discovery of SUSY using the trilepton signature, with a focus on\ngravity-mediated SUSY breaking, mSUGRA. The discovery potential for SUSY for\nthe case where strongly interacting supersymmetric particles are very massive\nis critically investigated. A possible choice of triggers for L = 10-31cm-2s-1\nis suggested by optimising the event yield at intermediate and final selection\nstages. A novel method to measure the rate of leptons from heavy flavour decays\npassing isolation requirements by isolating tt events in data is outlined.\n  The task of the ATLAS silicon tracker is to track particles produced in\nproton-proton collisions in its centre, measuring their momenta and production\nvertices. The precise knowledge of the silicon tracker module positions and\ntheir orientation in space (alignment) down to some microns and fractions of a\nmiliradian in the critical coordinates is of vital importance for large parts\nof the ambitious ATLAS physics program. In the second part of the thesis, the\nalignment of the ATLAS silicon tracker using the Robust Alignment algorithm and\nparticle tracks is described. The algorithm is applied to align end-cap A of\nthe pixel detector using cosmic ray particle tracks recorded during its\non-surface commissioning in 2006. Finally, about 2M cosmic ray tracks collected\nby ATLAS in situ in autumn 2008 are utilised to provide a coherent alignment of\nthe entire silicon tracker with the Robust Alignment algorithm.\n", "  We study the pump current and noise properties in an adiabatically modulated\nmagnetic nanowire with double domain walls (DW). The modulation is brought\nabout by applying a slowly oscillating magnetic and electric fields with a\ncontrollable phase difference. The pumping mechanism resembles the case of the\nquantum dot pump with two-oscillating gates. The pump current, shot noise, and\nheat flow show peaks when the Fermi energy matches with the spin-split resonant\nlevels localized between the DWs. The peak height of the pump current is an\nindicator for the lifetime of the spin-split quasistationary states between the\nDWs. For sharp DWs, the energy absorption from the oscillating fields results\nin side-band formations observable in the pump current. The pump noise carries\ninformation on the correlation properties between the nonequilibrium electrons\nand the quasi-holes created by the oscillating scatterer. The ratio between the\npump shot noise and the heat flow serves as an indicator for quasi-particle\ncorrelation.\n", "  We present our first experimental determination of the magnetic noise of a\nsuperspinglass made of < 1 pico-liter frozen ferrofluid. The measurements were\nperformed with a local magnetic field sensor based on Hall microprobes operated\nwith the spinning current technique. The results obtained, though preliminary,\nqualitatively agree with the theoretical predictions of Fluctuation-Dissipation\ntheorem (FDT) violation [1].\n", "  In present work it is suggested the concept of continual multi-electrode\nsystem being realized on the elongated electrically conducting element immersed\ninto electrolyte. Conjugation of such kind of system with the point-contact\nstructure creates the unique electrode architecture and permits realizing of\nthe auto-oscillation process of electrochemical commutation at atomic scale.\nDuring this process the nanostructure is being realized in a form of point\ncontact at the place of the mutual touching of the dendrite top and\ncounter-electrode. The ability of point contacts to concentrate the electric\nfield in assemblage with the peculiar properties of elongated element causes\nunambiguously the localization of all the electrochemical transformations at\nthe dendrite top, where contact is forming.\n", "  A novel functional integral formulation of quantum mechanics for\nnon-Lagrangian systems is presented. The new approach, which we call \"stringy\nquantization,\" is based solely on classical equations of motion and is free of\nany ambiguity arising from Lagrangian and/or Hamiltonian formulation of the\ntheory. The functionality of the proposed method is demonstrated on several\nexamples. Special attention is paid to the stringy quantization of systems with\na general A-power friction force $-\\kappa[\\dot{q}]^A$. Results for $A = 1$ are\ncompared with those obtained in the approaches by Caldirola-Kanai, Bateman and\nKostin. Relations to the Caldeira-Leggett model and to the Feynman-Vernon\napproach are discussed as well.\n", "  An experimental investigation of the impact of sample inhomogeneity on\nmeasurements of the linear elongational viscosity of two low-density\npolyethelenes is presented. A novel method of in-situ measurements of the\ndiameter of samples under extension has recently been implemented to properly\naccount for the sample non-uniformities during elongation. Two types of low\ndensity polyethylenes (LDPE's) have been investigated: Lupolen 1840 D and LPDE\n1840 H. Whereas in the case of Lupolen 1840 H the Trouton relationship is\nverified, in the case of Lupolen 1840 D the deviations can be as large as 40%,\ndepending on the magnitude of the initial sample non-uniformity and the\nexperimental conditions. Based on real time visualization of the sample, these\ndeviations are associated with an inhomogeneous deformation of the specimen.\nDifferences in the homogeneity of deformation between the H and D samples are\nexplained by significantly different maximal retardation times. The\nexperimental investigation is complemented by a simplified theoretical\nestimation of the error induced by the sample inhomogeneity in the case of\nmeasurements of elongational viscosities in the linear range. A fair level of\nagreement is found with the experimentally measured error.\n", "  We provide a new analysis of the system of partial differential equations\ndescribing the radial and vertical equilibria of the plasma in accretion disks.\nIn particular, we show that the partial differential system can be separated\nonce a definite, oscillatory (or hyperbolic) form for the radial dependence of\nthe relevant physical quantities is assumed. The system is thus reduced to an\nordinary differential system in the vertical dimensionless coordinate. The\nresulting equations can be integrated analytically in the limit of small\nmagnetic pressure. We complete our analysis with a direct numerical integration\nof the more general case. The main result is that a ring-like density profile\n(i.e., radial oscillations in the mass density) can appear even in the limit of\nsmall magnetic pressure.\n", "  The volatile transition from quiescent laminar to strongly fluctuating\nturbulent dynamics in shear flows remains only poorly understood despite its\npractical importance and more than a century of intense research. The\ntheoretical understanding of the transition process has been complicated by the\nlack of a linear instability mechanism and additionally by a catastrophic\ncollapse of turbulence which can occur after extremely long lifetimes.\nTurbulence close to onset is investigated experimentally in three different\ngeometries: pipe, duct and channel flow. The reverse transition from turbulent\nto laminar flow is observed to be a general feature of shear flows. A critical\npoint is uncovered at slightly higher flow rates, where the nature of the flow\nchanges abruptly to the generic case of expanding turbulence. The critical\nexponent associated with this phase transition is found to be universal. This\nconfirms a conjecture made over 20 years ago based on an analogy between fluid\nturbulence and discrete models in statistical physics.\n", "  These TASI lectures consider low mass hidden sectors from Hidden Valleys,\nQuirks and Unparticles. We show how each corresponds to a different limit of\nthe same class of models: hidden sectors with non-abelian gauge groups with\nmass gaps well below a TeV that communicate to the Standard Model through weak\nscale suppressed higher dimension operators. We provide concrete examples of\nsuch models and discuss LHC signatures. Lastly we turn to discussing the\napplication of Hidden Valleys to dark matter sectors.\n", "  While existing mathematical descriptions can accurately account for phenomena\nat microscopic scales (e.g. molecular dynamics), these are often\nhigh-dimensional, stochastic and their applicability over macroscopic time\nscales of physical interest is computationally infeasible or impractical. In\ncomplex systems, with limited physical insight on the coherent behavior of\ntheir constituents, the only available information is data obtained from\nsimulations of the trajectories of huge numbers of degrees of freedom over\nmicroscopic time scales. This paper discusses a Bayesian approach to deriving\nprobabilistic coarse-grained models that simultaneously address the problems of\nidentifying appropriate reduced coordinates and the effective dynamics in this\nlower-dimensional representation. At the core of the models proposed lie\nsimple, low-dimensional dynamical systems which serve as the building blocks of\nthe global model. These approximate the latent, generating sources and\nparameterize the reduced-order dynamics. We discuss parallelizable, online\ninference and learning algorithms that employ Sequential Monte Carlo samplers\nand scale linearly with the dimensionality of the observed dynamics. We propose\na Bayesian adaptive time-integration scheme that utilizes probabilistic\npredictive estimates and enables rigorous concurrent s imulation over\nmacroscopic time scales. The data-driven perspective advocated assimilates\ncomputational and experimental data and thus can materialize data-model fusion.\nIt can deal with applications that lack a mathematical description and where\nonly observational data is available. Furthermore, it makes non-intrusive use\nof existing computational models.\n", "  Quiescent cosmology and the Weyl curvature hypothesis possess a mathematical\nframework, namely the definition of an Isotropic Singularity, but only for the\ninitial state of the universe. A complementary framework is necessary to also\nencode appropriate cosmological futures. In order to devise a new framework we\nanalyse the relation between regular conformal structures and (an)isotropy, the\nbehaviour and role of a monotonic conformal factor which is a function of\ncosmic time, as well as four example cosmologies for further guidance. Finally,\nwe present our new definitions of an Anisotropic Future Endless Universe and an\nAnisotropic Future Singularity which offer a promising realisation for the new\nframework. Their irregular, degenerate conformal structures differ\nsignificantly from those of the Isotropic Singularity. The combination of the\nthree definitions together could then provide the first complete formalisation\nof the quiescent cosmology concept. For completeness we also present the new\ndefinitions of an Isotropic Future Singularity and a Future Isotropic Universe.\nThe relation to other approaches, in particular to the somewhat dual dynamical\nsystems approach, and other asymptotic scenarios is briefly discussed.\n", "  The exclusive diffractive production of vector mesons and real photons in ep\ncollisions has been studied at HERA in a wide kinematic range. Here the most\nrecent experimental results are presented together with a Regge-type model and\nprojects for new diffractive studies at LHC.\n", "  We present the viability of obtaining the particle size and surface coverage\nin a monolayer of polystyrene particles adsorbed on a glass surface from\noptical coherent reflectance data around the critical angle in an internal\nreflection configuration. We have found that fitting a CSM to optical\nreflectivity curves in an internal reflection configuration around the critical\nangle with a dilute random monolayer of particles adsorbed on the surface can\nin fact provide the particle's radius and surface coverage once the particles\nare sufficiently large.\n", "  Nanoscale biosystems are widely used in numerous medical applications. The\napproaches for structure and function of the nanomachines that are available in\nthe cell (natural nanomachines) are discussed. Molecular simulation studies\nhave been extensively used to study the dynamics of many nanomachines including\nribosome. Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) serve as prototypes for biological channels\nsuch as Aquaporins (AQPs). Recently, extensive investigations have been\nperformed on the transport of biological nanosystems through CNTs. The results\nare utilized as a guide in building a nanomachinary such as nanosyringe for a\nneedle free drug delivery.\n", "  An ac photopyroelectric calorimeter has been used to simultaneously measure\nthe specific heat, thermal conductivity, and thermal diffusivity around the\nantiferromagnetic to paramagnetic phase transition in KMnF3. It has been found\nthat the critical exponent and the amplitude ratio of the thermal diffusivity\nare the same as those of the specific heat. Both values agree with the\npredictions of the three-dimensional Heisenberg model for isotropic magnets,\nalthough this transition is not only magnetic but also structural as well. The\nthermal conductivity shows a broad peak at the Neel temperature that could be\nrelated to a reduction of the phonon scattering by the spin fluctuation as the\ntransition temperature is approached.\n", "  The high-pressure behavior of the lattice elasticity of spodumene, LiAlSi2O6,\nwas studied by static compression in a diamond-anvil cell up to 9.3 GPa.\nInvestigations by means of single-crystal XRD and Raman spectroscopy within the\nhydrostatic limits of the pressure medium focus on the pressure ranges around\nsimilar to 3.2 and similar to 7.7 GPa, which have been reported previously to\ncomprise two independent structural phase transitions. While our measurements\nconfirm the well-established first-order C2/c-P2(1)/c transformation at 3.19\nGPa (with 1.2% volume discontinuity and a hysteresis between 0.02 and 0.06\nGPa), both unit-cell dimensions and the spectral changes observed in\nhigh-pressure Raman spectra give no evidence for structural changes related to\na second phase transition. Monoclinic lattice parameters and unit-cell volumes\nat in total 59 different pressure points have been used to re-calculate the\nlattice-related properties of spontaneous strain, volume strain, and the bulk\nmoduli as a function of pressure across the transition. A modified Landau free\nenergy expansion in terms of a one component order parameter has been developed\nand tested against these experimentally determined data. The Landau solution\nprovides a much better reproduction of the observed anomalies than any\nequation-of-state fit to data sets truncated below and above P (tr), thus\ngiving Landau parameters of K (0) = 138.3(2) GPa, K' = 7.46(5), lambda (V) =\n33.6(2) GPa, a = 0.486(3), b = -29.4(6) GPa and c = 551(11) GPa.\n", "  Spitzer space telescope spectroscopy reveal a new class of H2-luminous\ngalaxies with enhanced H2 line emission, but where star formation is strongly\nsuppressed. This is in sharp contrast with what is observed in standard star\nforming galaxies. These sources are all in active phases of galaxy evolution\n(galaxy interactions, AGN feedback, gas accretion in galaxy clusters, etc.).\nWhy is H2 present in violent phases of galaxy evolution? How is the H2 emission\npowered? Why is the H2 gas inefficient at forming stars? What can we learn from\nthese \"H2 galaxies\" about galaxy formation? This thesis addresses these\nquestions, and discuss the theoretical and observational perspectives of this\nwork (in particular Herschel and JWST).\n", "  In the eighth century BC something peculiar seems to happen on Sicily. The\narchaeological record starts to show the arrival of Greek material culture. By\nthe fifth century BC the island is effectively 'Hellenised' and ancient\nhistorians record the political and military action of poleis, Greek\ncity-states. Each polis has traditionally been seen as the offshoot of a city\nelsewhere. Genealogies of cities ultimately end in cities found in the cities\nof the Peloponnese and the Aegean. The 'Greek' identity of the Sicilian cities\nis part of a wider debate on the concept of Identity in the ancient world. This\npaper considers if there is a contribution archaeoastronomers can make to such\ndiscussions by considering the alignments of Greek temples. Greek religion was\nintimately related to notions of civic identity and what it meant to be\n'Greek'. I propose a method of studying small samples of temples, which\ncombines both alignment analysis and historical context. Therefore it may be\npossible that a study of the temples may yield useful information about\ncollective identities. However, as this method shows, the more ambiguous the\ncultural data the less certain any astronomical patterns may be.\n", "  Nanotechnology has already made indelible dents in the fields of\ncommunication, computation, electronics, photonics, gas sensors, diagnostic\ntechnologies, catalysis, drug delivery systems and imaging. In particular, ZnO\nnanostructures have attracted a lot of research interest due to their unique\nstructure- and size-dependent electrical, optical, and mechanical properties.\nZnO nanosystems are abundant with respect to a wide variety of morphologies\nwhose syntheses are critically dependent on several experimental parameters.\nCursory presentation of the immense potential of these tiny systems and the\nstate-of-the-art of the synthetic methodologies along with our initial research\non ZnO nanorods has been presented. ZnO nanorods in the size range 50-150nm\nhave been synthesized by solid-state route by heating zinc acetate with caustic\nsoda under specific growth conditions. X-ray diffraction pattern unequivocally\nestablishes a wurtzite structure. Scanning electron microscope images of ZnO\nnanorods display a random distribution of non-uniform size ranges. The\nmanipulation of ZnO nanosystems by fine tuning the critical band gap of this\nunique semiconductor by doping with divalent transition metal ions leading to\nnovel nanosystems to enhance the performance of the electronic devices is our\nextended area of research.\n", "  The complex interaction between transverse acoustic (TA) phonon, transverse\noptic (TO) phonon and polar nano-domains (PND) in the relaxor ferroelectric\nKTa1-xNbxO3 (KTN) is studied by means of high resolution diffuse and inelastic\nneutron scattering. The experimental results and a comparison with lead\nrelaxors, suggest a new scattering mechanism of the TA phonon by localized\nmodes in PNDs. A theoretical model is developed, which accurately predicts the\nevolution of the TA damping with temperature and wavevector. Such a mechanism\nsuggests the possible use of high frequency acoustic modes for the study of\nnanocomposite materials.\n", "  In conventional lasers, the optical cavity that confines the photons also\ndetermines essential characteristics of the lasing modes such as wavelength,\nemission pattern, ... In random lasers, which do not have mirrors or a\nwell-defined cavity, light is confined within the gain medium by means of\nmultiple scattering. The sharp peaks in the emission spectra of semiconductor\npowders, first observed in 1999, has therefore lead to an intense debate about\nthe nature of the lasing modes in these so-called lasers with resonant\nfeedback. In this paper, we review numerical and theoretical studies aimed at\nclarifying the nature of the lasing modes in disordered scattering systems with\ngain. We will discuss in particular the link between random laser modes near\nthreshold (TLM) and the resonances or quasi-bound (QB) states of the passive\nsystem without gain. For random lasers in the localized regime, QB states and\nthreshold lasing modes were found to be nearly identical within the scattering\nmedium. These studies were later extended to the case of more lossy systems\nsuch as random systems in the diffusive regime where differences between\nquasi-bound states and lasing modes were measured. Very recently, a theory able\nto treat lasers with arbitrarily complex and open cavities such as random\nlasers established that the TLM are better described in terms of the so-called\nconstant-flux states.\n", "  The Low Frequency Instrument (LFI) of the ESA Planck CMB mission is an array\nof 22 ultra sensitive pseudocorrelation radiometers working at 30, 44, and 70\nGHz. LFI has been calibrated and delivered for integration with the satellite\nto the European Space Agency on November 2006. The aim of Planck is to measure\nthe anisotropy and polarization of the Cosmic Background Radiation with a\nsensitivity and angular resolution never reached before over the full sky. LFI\nis intrinsically sensitive to polarization thanks to the use of Ortho-Mode\nTransducers (OMT) located between the feedhorns and the pseudo-correlation\nradiometers. The OMTs are microwave passive components that divide the incoming\nradiation into two linear orthogonal components. A set of 11 OMTs (2 at 30 GHz,\n3 at 44 GHz, and 6 at 70 GHz) were produced and tested. This work describes the\ndesign, development and performance of the eleven Flight Model OMTs of LFI. The\nfinal design was reached after several years of development. At first, Elegant\nBread Board OMTs were produced to investigate the manufacturing technology and\ndesign requirements. Then, a set of 3 Qualification Model (QM) OMTs were\ndesigned, manufactured and tested in order to freeze the design and the\nmanufacturing technology for the flight units. Finally, the Flight Models were\nproduced and tested. It is shown that all the OMT units have been accepted for\nflight and the electromagnetic performance is at least marginally compliant\nwith the requirements. Mechanically, the units passed all the thermoelastic\nqualification tests after a reworking necessary after the QM campaign.\n", "  Recent achievements in nuclear forces theory open new perspectives for the\nnext decade of low energy nuclear physics, bringing together people from very\ndifferent communities. Although many developments remain to be done, the\npossibility to directly use QCD to describe nuclear system is a major challenge\nthat is within reach. In this introduction to the 2009 International\nJoliot-Curie School (EJC2009), new trends in the strong nuclear interaction are\nsummarized starting from quarks and ending with finite or infinite nuclear\nsystems. At different energy scales, selected new concepts and ideas have been\ndiscussed in a rather simple way. Recent advances in the theory of nuclear\nforces, thanks to chiral perturbation and effective field theories, have led to\na new generation of strong nuclear interaction particularly suited to low\nenergy nuclear physics. The interesting aspects of new interactions compared to\nconventional forces are underlined. Recent achievements in ab initio theories\nthat directly start from the bare nucleon-nucleon interaction and their key\nrole to understand the three-body force are illustrated. Finally, future\nperspectives for standard nuclear physics theories, namely Shell Model and\nEnergy Density Functional, are discussed.\n", "  An urban road network of Le Mans in France is analyzed. Some topological\nproperties of network are investigated, such as degree distribution, clustering\ncoefficient, diameter, and characteristic path length. These results suggest\nthat our network is a \"small- world\" network with short average shortest path\nand large clustering coefficient. Furthermore, double power-law distribution is\nfound in degree distribution which is distinct from the single power-law and a\nnovel degree distribution function is also given. Some analysis on this\nfunction extend the comprehension of the origination of the double power-law\ndistribution widely dispersed in nature.\n", "  Controlled synthesis of nano materials is critical for the development of\nnanotechnologies concerned with respect to shape and size. Especially, ZnO\nnanosystems, such as wires, belts, needles and films can be easily formed by\neither physical or chemical approaches such as, Chemical Vapour Deposition,\nMetal Organic Chemical Vapour Deposition, Pulsed Laser Deposition, Molecular\nBeam Epitaxy, Sol Gel process, Thermal Annealing method and Solvothermal\nOxidation. ZnO has polar surfaces that help in the formation of a wide range of\nnanostructures such as needles,films rings, springs, bows and helices\n", "  The beta-decay of the 6He halo nucleus and the M1-transition processes of the\nexcited 6Li(0+) state into the alpha + d continuum are studied in a three-body\nmodel. The initial nuclear states are described as an alpha + 2N system in\nhyperspherical coordinates on a Lagrange mesh. The energy dependence and\nabsolute values of the beta-transition probability per time and energy units of\na recent experiment can be reproduced very well with an appropriate alpha + d\npotential. A total transition probability of 2.04E-6 s^(-1) is obtained in\nagreement with the experiment. Due to a strong cancellation of the internal and\nhalo components of the matrix elements, halo effects are shown to be very\nimportant. For the M1 transition process the halo structure of the excited\n6Li(0+) isobaric analog state is confirmed. The cancellation effects, however,\nare not so strong. The transition probability is strongly sensitive to the\ndescription of the alpha + d phase shifts. Charge symmetry is analyzed through\na comparison of the two processes. The present branching ratio Gamma(0^+ -->\nalpha + d)/Gamma(0^+ --> 1+) is of the order 1.0E-4, and is expected to be\nobservable in current experiments.\n", "  We present comparison of numerical simulations of propagation of MHD\nwaves,excited by subphotospheric perturbations, in two different (\"deep\" and\n\"shallow\") magnetostatic models of the sunspots. The \"deep\" sunspot model\ndistorts both the shape of the wavefront and its amplitude stronger than the\n\"shallow\" model. For both sunspot models, the surface gravity waves (f-mode)\nare affected by the sunspots stronger than the acoustic p-modes. The wave\namplitude inside the sunspot depends on the photospheric strength of the\nmagnetic field and the distance of the source from the sunspot axis. For the\nsource located at 9 Mm from the center of the sunspot, the wave amplitude\nincreases when the wavefront passes through the central part of the sunspot.\nFor the source distance of 12 Mm, the wave amplitude inside the sunspot is\nalways smaller than outside. For the same source distance from the sunspot\ncenter but for the models with different strength of the magnetic field, the\nwave amplitude inside the sunspot increases with the strength of the magnetic\nfield. The simulations show that unlike the case of the uniform inclined\nbackground magnetic field, the p- and f-mode waves are not spatially separated\ninside the sunspot where the magnetic field is strongly non-uniform. These\nproperties have to be taken into account for interpretation of observations of\nMHD waves traveling through sunspot regions.\n", "  A 52MHz Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) linear accelerator (linac) is\ndesigned to serve as an initial structure for the SSC-linac system (injector\ninto Separated Sector Cyclotron). The designed injection and output energy are\n3.5 keV/u and 143 keV/u, respectively. Beam dynamics study in RFQ was done\nusing 3-dimensional particle-in-cell code BEAMPATH [1]. Simulation results show\nthat this RFQ structure is characterized by stable value of beam transmission\nefficiency (at least 95%) for both zero-current mode and for space charge\ndominated regime. The beam accelerated in RFQ has good quality in both\ntransversal and longitudinal directions, and could be easily accepted by Drift\nTube Linac (DTL). Effects of vane errors and of the space charge on beam\nparameters are studied as well to define the engineering tolerance for RFQ vane\nmachining and alignment.\n", "  Paper has been withdrawn due to a critical error in the numerical evaluation\nof the capture fraction.\n", "  Successful implementation of California's Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS)\nmandating 33 percent renewable energy generation by 2020 requires inclusion of\na robust strategy to mitigate increased risk of energy deficits (blackouts) due\nto short time-scale (sub 1 hour) intermittencies in renewable energy sources.\nOf these RPS sources, wind energy has the fastest growth rate--over 25%\nyear-over-year. If these growth trends continue, wind energy could make up 15\npercent of California's energy portfolio by 2016 (wRPS15). However, the\nhour-to-hour variations in wind energy (speed) will create large hourly energy\ndeficits that require installation of other, more predictable, compensation\ngeneration capacity and infrastructure. Compensating for the energy deficits of\nwRPS15 could potentially cost tens of billions in additional dollar-expenditure\nfor fossil and / or nuclear generation capacity. There is a real possibility\nthat carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions will\nmiss the California Assembly Bill 32 (CA AB 32) target by a wide margin once\nthe wRPS15 compensation system is in place. This work presents a set of\nanalytics tools that show the impact of short-term intermittencies to help\npolicy makers understand and plan for wRPS15 integration. What are the right\npolicy choices for RPS that include wind energy?\n", "  We report the analysis of fluctuation conductivity (FLC) and pseudogap (D*)\nin Fe-based superconductor SmFeAsO0.85 with Tc = 55 K derived from resistivity\nexperiments. In the FLC analysis distinct 2D-3D (MT-AL) crossover typical for\ncuprates but followed by enhanced MT fluctuation contribution was found. Using\nthe crossover temperature To coherence length along c-axis Xc(0) was\ndetermined. Rather specific D*(T) dependence with two representative\ntemperatures followed by minimum at about 125 K was observed. Below Ts = 147 K,\ncorresponding to SDW ordering, D*(T) decreases linearly down to TAF = 133 K.\nThis last peculiarity can likely be attributed to antiferromagnetic (AF)\nordering in FeAs planes. It is believed that found behavior is strongly\nassociated with specific electronic configuration of the Fe-based compounds\n", "  Various methods of helioseismology are used to study the subsurface\nproperties of the sunspot in NOAA Active Region 9787. This sunspot was chosen\nbecause it is axisymmetric, shows little evolution during 20-28 January 2002,\nand was observed continuously by the MDI/SOHO instrument. (...) Wave travel\ntimes and mode frequencies are affected by the sunspot. In most cases, wave\npackets that propagate through the sunspot have reduced travel times. At short\ntravel distances, however, the sign of the travel-time shifts appears to depend\nsensitively on how the data are processed and, in particular, on filtering in\nfrequency-wavenumber space. We carry out two linear inversions for wave speed:\none using travel-times and phase-speed filters and the other one using mode\nfrequencies from ring analysis. These two inversions give subsurface wave-speed\nprofiles with opposite signs and different amplitudes. (...) From this study of\nAR9787, we conclude that we are currently unable to provide a unified\ndescription of the subsurface structure and dynamics of the sunspot.\n", "  In view of the implementation of beam-monitoring sensors for CERN's Large\nHadron Collider (LHC), and also in order to validate Thermoluminescence\nDetectors as a versatile tool to measure ionizing radiation doses in mixed\nfields at hadron colliders such as the LHC, chemical vapor deposition diamond\nsensors have been evaluated and calibrated at CERN's Proton Synchrotron\naccelerator. Special attention was paid to understanding whether\nlithiumfluoride thermoluminescence detectors are suitable as measuring devices\nin these radiation fields.\n", "  Lead isotope analysis is applied to Roman lead ingots to identify and\nrecognise the importance of those from the mines of Cartagena, and to define\nthe cluster characteristics of the Cartagena ore district on an isotopic map.\n", "  Biaxially textured LuNi2BC thin films with Tc up to 15.8 K and a residual\nresistivity ratio up to 15 have been prepared. The films were deposited on\nMgO(110) substrates using pulsed laser deposition from a stoichiometric target.\nVia the precise control of the deposition rate, a biaxial texture is favored\nwithin a broad range of the deposition temperature. The full epitaxial\nrelationship between the borocarbide film, the \\luo interface layer and the\nsubstrate is (110)[001]MgO II (110)[001]Lu2O3 II (001)[100]LuNi2B2C. A very\nsharp in--plane alignment of about 1\\textdegree and an out--of--plane order of\nabout 2.5\\textdegree was achieved in the \\luni layer. However, a systematic\nstudy using different deposition temperatures shows that the temperature is\ncrucial for phase formation and appealing superconducting properties. Applying\noptimized deposition conditions, critical temperatures of up to 15.8 K and\nsteep superconducting transitions of about 0.3 K are reproducibly obtained. We\nfurther analyzed the upper critical field Hc2 of one film deposited under\noptimized conditions. It was resistively measured along the [001] direction and\nfitted with a power law. The value of Hc2(0) = 9.82 T obtained from that fit is\nin very good agreement with single crystal data and the power exponent\ndescribing the positive curvature for small external magnetic fields of about\n0.19 indicates a relatively low intraband scattering in the films.\n", "  Scaling symmetries of the Euler-Lagrange equations are generally not\nvariational symmetries of the action and do not lead to conservation laws.\nNevertheless, by an extension of Noether's theorem, scaling symmetries lead to\nuseful {\\em nonconservation} laws, which still reduce the Euler-Lagrange\nequations to first order in terms of scale invariants. We illustrate scaling\nsymmetry dynamically and statically. Applied dynamically to systems of bodies\ninteracting via central forces, the nonconservation law is Lagrange's identity,\nleading to generalized virial laws. Applied to self-gravitating spheres in\nhydrostatic equilibrium, the nonconservation law leads to well-known properties\nof polytropes describing degenerate stars and chemically homogeneous\nnondegenerate stellar cores.\n", "  The resonant elements that grant metamaterials their unique properties have\nthe fundamental limitation of restricting their useable frequency bandwidth.\nThe development of frequency-agile metamaterials has helped to alleviate these\nbandwidth restrictions by allowing real-time tuning of the metamaterial\nfrequency response. We demonstrate electrically-controlled persistent frequency\ntuning of a metamaterial, allowing lasting modification of its response using a\ntransient stimulus. This work demonstrates a form of memory capacitance which\ninterfaces metamaterials with a class of devices known collectively as memory\ndevices.\n", "  The intended use of a magnetic material, from information storage to power\nconversion, depends crucially on its domain structure, traditionally crafted\nduring materials synthesis. By contrast, we show that an external magnetic\nfield applied transverse to the preferred magnetization of a model disordered\nuniaxial ferromagnet is an isothermal regulator of domain pinning. At elevated\ntemperatures, near the transition into the paramagnet, modest transverse fields\nincrease the pinning, stabilize the domain structure, and harden the magnet,\nuntil a point where the field induces quantum tunneling of the domain walls and\nsoftens the magnet. At low temperatures, tunneling completely dominates the\ndomain dynamics and provides an interpretation of the quantum phase transition\nin highly disordered magnets as a localization/delocalization transition for\ndomain walls. While the energy scales of the rare earth ferromagnet studied\nhere restrict the effects to cryogenic temperatures, the principles discovered\nare general and should be applicable to existing classes of highly anisotropic\nferromagnets with ordering at room temperature or above.\n", "  Based on the general thought that mechanics cannot be absolutely exact,\nsupported by pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments on the\nreversal of time in spin systems, we postulate existence of a probability which\ndo not follow from the Schroudinger equation, or X-probability. It is shown\nthat the X-probability allows explain irreversibility of evolution of\nmacrosystems, and also creates a basis for using probabilistic methods in\nstatistical mechanics and for deliverance from the mechanical determinism.\n", "  Modern intense ultrafast pulsed lasers generate an electric field of\nsufficient strength to permit tunnel ionization of the valence electrons in\natoms. This process is usually treated as a rapid succession of isolated\nevents, in which the states of the remaining electrons are neglected. Such\nelectronic interactions are predicted to be weak, the exception being\nrecollision excitation and ionization caused by linearly-polarized radiation.\nIn contrast, it has recently been suggested that intense field ionization may\nbe accompanied by a two-stage `shake-up' reaction. Here we report a unique\ncombination of experimental techniques that enables us to accurately measure\nthe tunnel ionization probability for argon exposed to 50 femtosecond laser\npulses. Most significantly for the current study, this measurement is\nindependent of the optical focal geometry, equivalent to a homogenous electric\nfield. Furthermore, circularly-polarized radiation negates recollision. The\npresent measurements indicate that tunnel ionization results in simultaneous\nexcitation of one or more remaining electrons through shake-up. From an atomic\nphysics standpoint, it may be possible to induce ionization from specific\nstates, and will influence the development of coherent attosecond XUV radiation\nsources. Such pulses have vital scientific and economic potential in areas such\nas high-resolution imaging of in-vivo cells and nanoscale XUV lithography.\n", "  Thanks to a novel modelling programme to detect anomalies in the membranous\nsemi circular canals (SSC) of idiopathic scoliosis (IS) we found severe\nanomalies mainly located in lateral SCC devoted to trunk rotation and lateral\ndeviations. We also found a specific communication between the lateral and\nposterior canal involving the utricular chamber which is also highly suspected\nin scoliosis. Key points: - Membranous semi circular canals (SCC) modelling\nbased on MRI revealed significant anomalies in IS patients compared to normal\nsubjects. - Frequent aplasias located in the lateral canal were found in IS. -\nWe also discovered a, never described, abnormal communication between lateral\nand posterior canal. - Lateral SCC is involved in trunk rotation and lateral\ndeviation: these movements are frequently abnormal in IS.

Here we extend our analyzes\nof quantum anticipation to general type quantum evolutions and spectral\nmeasures and prove that quantum evolutions possessing an embedded orthogonal\nevolution are characterized by positive joint spectral measure. Furthermore, we\ncategorize quantum evolution, assess anticipation strength and provide a\nframework of analytic tools and results, thus preparing for further\ninvestigation and experimental verification of anticipation in concrete\nphysical situations such as the H-atom, which we have found to exhibit\nanticipation.\n", "  We discuss an implementation of Quantum Zeno Dynamics in a Cavity Quantum\nElectrodynamics experiment. By performing repeated unitary operations on atoms\ncoupled to the field, we restrict the field evolution in chosen subspaces of\nthe total Hilbert space. This procedure leads to promising methods for\ntailoring non-classical states. We propose to realize `tweezers' picking a\ncoherent field at a point in phase space and moving it towards an arbitrary\nfinal position without affecting other non-overlapping coherent components.\nThese effects could be observed with a state-of-the-art apparatus.\n", "  We have developed a simulation system for nanoscale high-electron mobility\ntransistors, in which the self-consistent solution of Poisson and Schr\\\"odinger\nequations is obtained with the finite element method. We solve the exact set of\nnonlinear differential equations to obtain electron wave function, electric\npotential distribution, electron density, Fermi surface energy and current\ndensity distribution in the whole body of the device. For more precision, local\ndependence of carrier mobility on the electric field distribution is\nconsidered. We furthermore compare the simulation to a recent experimental\nmeasurement and observe perfect agreement. We also propose a graded channel\ndesign to improve the transconductance and thereby the threshold frequency of\nthe device.\n", "  Some non-linear generalizations of classical Radon tomography were recently\nintroduced by M. Asorey et al [Phys. Rev. A 77, 042115 (2008), where the\nstraight lines of the standard Radon map are replaced by quadratic curves\n(ellipses, hyperbolas, circles) or quadratic surfaces (ellipsoids,\nhyperboloids, spheres). We consider here the quantum version of this novel\nnon-linear approach and obtain, by systematic use of the Weyl map, a\ntomographic encoding approach to quantum states. Non-linear quantum tomograms\nadmit a simple formulation within the framework of the star-product\nquantization scheme and the reconstruction formulae of the density operators\nare explicitly given in a closed form, with an explicit construction of\nquantizers and dequantizers. The role of symmetry groups behind the generalized\ntomographic maps is analyzed in some detail. We also introduce new\ngeneralizations of the standard singular dequantizers of the symplectic\ntomographic schemes, where the Dirac delta-distributions of operator-valued\narguments are replaced by smooth window functions, giving rise to the new\nconcept of \"thick\" quantum tomography. Applications for quantum state\nmeasurements of photons and matter waves are discussed.\n", "  We analyze the quantum Zeno dynamics that takes place when a field stored in\na cavity undergoes frequent interactions with atoms. We show that repeated\nmeasurements or unitary operations performed on the atoms probing the field\nstate confine the evolution to tailored subspaces of the total Hilbert space.\nThis confinement leads to non-trivial field evolutions and to the generation of\ninteresting non-classical states, including mesoscopic field state\nsuperpositions. We elucidate the main features of the quantum Zeno mechanism in\nthe context of a state-of-the-art cavity quantum electrodynamics experiment. A\nplethora of effects is investigated, from state manipulations by phase space\ntweezers to nearly arbitrary state synthesis. We analyze in details the\npractical implementation of this dynamics and assess its robustness by\nnumerical simulations including realistic experimental imperfections. We\ncomment on the various perspectives opened by this proposal.\n", "  We prove that, in a class of spherically symmetric spacetimes exhibiting\nstable trapping of null geodesics, linear waves cannot (uniformly) decay faster\nthan logarithmically. When these linear waves are treated as a model for\nnonlinear perturbations, this slow decay is highly suggestive of nonlinear\ninstability. We also prove that, in a large class of asymptotically flat,\nspherically symmetric spacetimes, logarithmic decay actually holds as a uniform\nupper bound. In the presence of stable trapping, this result is therefore the\nbest one can obtain. In addition, we provide an application of these results to\nultracompact neutron stars, suggesting that all stars with r < 3M might be\nunstable.\n", "  First-order phase transitions, classical or quantum, subject to randomness\ncoupled to energy-like variables (bond randomness) can be rounded, resulting in\ncontinuous transitions (emergent criticality). We study perhaps the simplest\nsuch model, quantum three-color Ashkin-Teller model and show that the quantum\ncritical point in $(1+1)$ dimension is an unusual one, with activated scaling\nat the critical point and Griffiths-McCoy phase away from it. The behavior is\nsimilar to the transverse random field Ising model, even though the pure system\nhas a first-order transition in this case. We believe that this fact must be\nattended to when discussing quantum critical points in numerous physical\nsystems, which may be first-order transitions in disguise.\n", "  Aim of the paper is to obtain 2d analogue of the backreaction equation which\nwill be useful to study final state of quantum perturbed spherically symmetric\ncurved space times. Thus we take Einstein-massless-scalar $\\psi$ tensor gravity\nmodel described on class of spherically symmetric curved space times. We\nrewrite the action functional in 2d analogue in terms of dimensionless\ndilaton-matter field $(\\chi=\\Phi\\psi)$ where dilaton field $\\Phi$ is conformal\nfactor of 2-sphere. Then we seek renormalized expectation value of quantum\ndilaton-matter field stress tensor operator by applying Hadamard\nrennormalization prescription. Singularity of the Green function is assumed to\nbe has logarithmic form. Covariantly conservation condition on the renormalized\nquantum dilaton-matter stress tensor demands to input a variable cosmological\nparameter $\\lambda(x)$. Energy conditions (weak, strong and null) is studied on\nthe obtained renormalized stress tensor leading to dynamical equations for\n$\\lambda(x), \\Phi$ and quantum vacuum state $W_0(x)=<0|\\hat{\\chi}^2|0>_{ren}.$\nIn weak quantum field limits our obtained trace anomaly corresponds to one\nwhich obtained from zeta function regularization method. Setting null-like\napparent horizon equation $\\nabla_c\\Phi\\nabla^c\\Phi=0,$ our procedure predicts\nthat physically correct value of the parameter in the anomaly trace\n$\\frac{1}{24\\pi}\\{R-\\alpha\\frac{\\nabla_{c}\\nabla^{c}\\Phi}{\\Phi}+(\\alpha-6)\\frac{\\nabla_c\\Phi\\nabla^c\\Phi}{\\Phi^2}\n\\}$ should be $\\alpha=6.$ At last we solved the backreaction equation and\nobtained explicitly metric field solution in the slow varying limits of the\nquantum and dilaton fields which has black holes topology and its singularity\nis covered by apparent horizon hypersurface.\n", "  We revisit the subject of perturbatively quantizing the nonlinear sigma model\nin two dimensions from a rigorous, mathematical point of view. Our main\ncontribution is to make precise the cohomological problem of eliminating\npotential anomalies that may arise when trying to preserve symmetries under\nquantization. The symmetries we consider are twofold: (i) diffeomorphism\ncovariance for a general target manifold; (ii) a transitive group of isometries\nwhen the target manifold is a homogeneous space. We show that there are no\nanomalies in case (i) and that (ii) is also anomaly-free under additional\nassumptions on the target homogeneous space, in agreement with the work of\nFriedan. We carry out some explicit computations for the $O(N)$-model. Finally,\nwe show how a suitable notion of the renormalization group establishes the\nRicci flow as the one loop renormalization group flow of the nonlinear sigma\nmodel.\n", "  The phase problem can be considered as one of the cornerstones of quantum\nmechanics intimately connected to the detection process and the uncertainty\nrelation. The latter impose fundamental limits on the manifold phase\nreconstruction schemes invented to date in particular at small magnitudes of\nthe quantum wave. Here, we show that a rigorous solution of the Transport of\nIntensity Reconstruction (TIE) scheme in terms of a linear elliptic partial\ndifferential equation for the phase provides reconstructions even in the\npresence of wave zeros if particular boundary conditions (BCs) are given. We\nfurthermore discuss how partial coherence hampers phase reconstruction and show\nthat a modified version of the TIE reconstructs the curl-free current density\nat arbitrary (in-)coherence. This opens the way for a large variety of new\napplications in fields as diverse as astrophysics, geophysics, photonics,\nacoustics, and electron microscopy, where zeros in the respective wave field\nare a ubiquitous feature.\n", "  This paper presents a quantum version of the Monty Hall problem based upon\nthe quantum inferring acausal structures, which can be identified with\ngeneralization of Bayesian networks. Considered structures are expressed in\nformalism of quantum information theory, where density operators are identified\nwith quantum generalization of probability distributions. Conditional relations\nbetween quantum counterpart of random variables are described by quantum\nconditional operators. Presented quantum inferring structures are used to\nconstruct a model inspired by scenario of well-known Monty Hall game, where we\nshow the differences between classical and quantum Bayesian reasoning.\n", "  Current nanostructure fabrication by etching is usually limited to planar\nstructures as they are defined by a planar mask. The realisation of\nthree-dimensional (3D) nanostructures by etching requires technologies beyond\nplanar masks. We present a method to fabricate a 3D mask that allows to etch\nthree-dimensional monolithic nanostructures by using only CMOS-compatible\nprocesses. The mask is written in a hard-mask layer that is deposited on two\nadjacent inclined surfaces of a Si wafer. By projecting in single step two\ndifferent 2D patterns within one 3D mask on the two inclined surfaces, the\nmutual alignment between the patterns is ensured. Thereby after the mask\npattern is defined, the etching of deep pores in two oblique directions yields\na three-dimensional structure in Si. As a proof of concept we demonstrate 3D\nmask fabrication for three-dimensional diamond-like photonic band gap crystals\nin silicon. The fabricated crystals reveal a broad stop gap in optical\nreflectivity measurements. We propose how 3D nanostructures with five different\nBravais lattices can be realised, namely cubic, tetragonal, orthorhombic,\nmonoclinic, and hexagonal, and demonstrate a mask for a 3D hexagonal crystal.\nWe also demonstrate the mask for a diamond-structure crystal with a 3D array of\ncavities. In general, the 2D patterns for the different surfaces can be\ncompletely independent and still be in perfect mutual alignment. Indeed, we\nobserve an alignment accuracy of better than 3.0 nm between the 2D mask\npatterns on the inclined surfaces, which permits one to etch well-defined\nmonolithic 3D nanostructures.\n", "  Shortcomings of Dirac's constrained analysis in the context of fourth order\nPais-Uhlenbeck oscillator action and the appearance of badly affected\nphase-space Hamiltonian for a generalized fourth order oscillator action,\nfollowing Ostrogradski, Dirac and Horowitz's formalism, require a viable\ncanonical formulation. This is achieved only after fixing appropriate variables\nat the end points and taking care of the counter surface terms obtained from\nvariational principle. In the process a one-to-one correspondence between\ndifferent higher order theories has been established. On the other hand the\nissue of branched Hamiltonian appearing in the presence of velocities with\ndegree higher than two in the Lagrangian, has not been resolved uniquely as\nyet. However, often such terms appear with higher order theory, gravity in\nparticular. Here we show that canonical formulation of higher order theory\ntakes care of the issue elegantly.\n", "  Neutrino properties can be constrained by the detection of ultra-high energy\ncosmic neutrinos (UHECNs). By using the updated global fitting results of\nneutrino mixing parameters, we present predictions on the neutrino flavor\nratios at the Earth from three possibly astrophysical sources. Comparing with\nthe latest IceCube data, we find that the normal hierarchy (NH) and inverted\nhierarchy (IH) cases from the initial ratios\n$\\phi_{\\nu_e}^0:\\phi_{\\nu_{\\mu}}^0:\\phi_{\\nu_{\\tau}}^0=$1:2:0 and 0:1:0 are\ncompatible with the data in the standard neutrino oscillation scenario. We also\nexamine the neutrino flavor ratios in a neutrino decay scenario beyond the\nstandard model, and introduce the special case that two mass eigenstates of\nneutrinos, i.e., $\\nu_1$ and $\\nu_2$, are degenerated. We find that the IH case\nand the degenerate NH case from the 1:2:0 and 0:1:0 sources are still\npermissible with the IceCube data within the $3\\sigma$ error range. The general\nconstraints only rely on the neutrino mixing and oscillation framework are also\ndiscussed.\n", "  We investigate the shift current bulk photovoltaic response of materials\nclose to a band inversion topological phase transition. We find that the bulk\nphotocurrent reverses direction across the band inversion transition, and that\nits magnitude is enhanced in the vicinity of the phase transition. These\nresults are demonstrated with first principles DFT calculations of BiTeI and\nCsPbI$_3$ under hydrostatic pressure, and explained with an analytical model,\nsuggesting that this phenomenon remains robust across disparate material\nsystems.\n", "  We consider the number of quantum queries required to determine the\ncoefficients of a degree-d polynomial over GF(q). A lower bound shown\nindependently by Kane and Kutin and by Meyer and Pommersheim shows that d/2+1/2\nquantum queries are needed to solve this problem with bounded error, whereas an\nalgorithm of Boneh and Zhandry shows that d quantum queries are sufficient. We\nshow that the lower bound is achievable: d/2+1/2 quantum queries suffice to\ndetermine the polynomial with bounded error. Furthermore, we show that d/2+1\nqueries suffice to achieve probability approaching 1 for large q. These upper\nbounds improve results of Boneh and Zhandry on the insecurity of cryptographic\nprotocols against quantum attacks. We also show that our algorithm's success\nprobability as a function of the number of queries is precisely optimal.\nFurthermore, the algorithm can be implemented with gate complexity poly(log q)\nwith negligible decrease in the success probability. We end with a conjecture\nabout the quantum query complexity of multivariate polynomial interpolation.\n", "  The issue of realization of the transfer functions of Linear Quantum\nStochastic Systems (LQSSs) is of fundamental importance for the practical\napplications of such systems, especially as coherent controllers for other\nquantum systems. So far, most works that addressed this problem have used\ncascade realizations. In this work, a new method is proposed, where the\ntransfer function of a LQSS is realized by a series of a pre-processing linear\nstatic network, a reduced LQSS, and a post-processing linear static network.\nThe introduction of the pre- and post-processing static networks leaves an\nintermediate reduced LQSS with a simple input/output structure, that is\nrealized by a concatenation of simple cavities. A feedback connection of the\ncavities through a linear static network is used to produce the correct\ndynamics for the reduced system. The resulting realization provides a nice\nstructural picture of the system. The key mathematical tool that allows for the\nconstruction of this realization, is an SVD-like decomposition for doubled-up\nmatrices in Krein spaces. Illustrative examples are provided for the theory\ndeveloped.\n", "  The J\\\"uttner (covariant Boltzmann) distribution is provided for anisotropic\npressure (or temperature) tensors. Its manifestly covariant form follows from\nits scalar property.\n", "  In the present study, a series of planar poly(p-phenylene) (PPP) oligomers\nwith n phenyl rings (n = 1 - 20), designated as n-PP, are taken as finite-size\nmodels of the narrowest armchair graphene nanoribbons with hydrogen\npassivation. The singlet-triplet energy gap, vertical ionization potential,\nvertical electron affinity, fundamental gap, optical gap, and exciton binding\nenergy of n-PP are calculated using Kohn-Sham density functional theory and\ntime-dependent density functional theory with various exchange-correlation\ndensity functionals. The ground state of n-PP is shown to be singlet for all\nthe chain lengths studied. In contrast to the lowest singlet state (i.e., the\nground state), the lowest triplet state and the ground states of the cation and\nanion of n-PP are found to exhibit some multi-reference character. Overall, the\nelectronic and optical properties of n-PP obtained from the omegaB97 and\nomegaB97X functionals are in excellent agreement with the available\nexperimental data.\n", "  We develop a model for the redshift-space correlation function, valid for\nboth dark matter particles and halos on scales $>5\\,h^{-1}$Mpc. In its simplest\nformulation, the model requires the knowledge of the first three moments of the\nline-of-sight pairwise velocity distribution plus two well-defined\ndimensionless parameters. The model is obtained by extending the\nGaussian-Gaussianity prescription for the velocity distribution, developed in a\nprevious paper, to a more general concept allowing for local skewness, which is\nrequired to match simulations. We compare the model with the well known\nGaussian streaming model and the more recent Edgeworth streaming model. Using\nN-body simulations as a reference, we show that our model gives a precise\ndescription of the redshift-space clustering over a wider range of scales. We\ndo not discuss the theoretical prescription for the evaluation of the velocity\nmoments, leaving this topic to further investigation.\n", "  Automated photometric supernova classification has become an active area of\nresearch in recent years in light of current and upcoming imaging surveys such\nas the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, given\nthat spectroscopic confirmation of type for all supernovae discovered will be\nimpossible. Here, we develop a multi-faceted classification pipeline, combining\nexisting and new approaches. Our pipeline consists of two stages: extracting\ndescriptive features from the light curves and classification using a machine\nlearning algorithm. Our feature extraction methods vary from model-dependent\ntechniques, namely SALT2 fits, to more independent techniques fitting\nparametric models to curves, to a completely model-independent wavelet\napproach. We cover a range of representative machine learning algorithms,\nincluding naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, artificial\nneural networks and boosted decision trees (BDTs). We test the pipeline on\nsimulated multi-band DES light curves from the Supernova Photometric\nClassification Challenge. Using the commonly used area under the curve (AUC) of\nthe Receiver Operating Characteristic as a metric, we find that the SALT2 fits\nand the wavelet approach, with the BDTs algorithm, each achieves an AUC of\n0.98, where 1 represents perfect classification. We find that a representative\ntraining set is essential for good classification, whatever the feature set or\nalgorithm, with implications for spectroscopic follow-up. Importantly, we find\nthat by using either the SALT2 or the wavelet feature sets with a BDT\nalgorithm, accurate classification is possible purely from light curve data,\nwithout the need for any redshift information.\n", "  We present few types of integral transforms and integral representations that\nare very useful for extending to supergeometry many familiar concepts of\ndifferential geometry. Among them we discuss the construction of the super\nHodge dual, the integral representation of picture changing operators of string\ntheories and the construction of the super-Liouville form of a symplectic\nsupermanifold.\n", "  Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation has uncovered nonzero Berry curvature\nand bosonic edge states in hardcore-Bose-Hubbard model on the gapped honeycomb\nlattice. The competition between the chemical potential and staggered onsite\npotential leads to an interesting quantum phase diagram comprising superfluid\nphase, Mott insulator, and charge density wave insulator. In this paper, we\npresent a semiclassical perspective of this system by mapping to a spin-$1/2$\nquantum XY model. We give an explicit analytical origin of the quantum phase\ndiagram, the Berry curvatures, and the edge states using semiclassical\napproximations. We find very good agreements between the semiclassical analyses\nand the QMC results. Our results show that the topological properties of\nhardcore-Bose-Hubbard model are the same as those of magnon in the\ncorresponding quantum spin system. Our results are applicable to systems of\nultracold bosonic atoms trapped in honeycomb optical lattices.\n", "  For continuous Mott metal-insulator transitions in layered two dimensional\nsystems, we demonstrate the phenomenon of dimensional decoupling: the system\nbehaves as a three-dimensional metal in the Fermi liquid side but as a stack of\ndecoupled two-dimensional layers in the Mott insulator. We show that the\ndimensional decoupling happens at the Mott quantum critical point itself. We\nderive the temperature dependence of the interlayer electric conductivity in\nvarious crossover regimes near such a continuous Mott transition, and discuss\nexperimental implications.\n", "  Little Higgs Models are promising constructs to solve the hierarchy problem\naffecting the Higgs boson mass for generic new physics. However, their\npreservation of lepton universality forbids them to account for the\n$H\\to\\tau\\mu$ CMS hint and at the same time respect (as they do) the severe\nlimits on $H\\to\\mu e$ inherited from the non-observation of $\\mu\\to e\\gamma$.\nWe compute the predictions of the Simplest Little Higgs Model for the $H\\to\n\\ell\\ell'$ decays and conclude that the measurement of any of these decays at\nLHC (even with a much smaller rate than currently hinted) would, under\nreasonable assumptions, disfavor this model. This result is consistent with our\nearlier observation of very suppressed lepton flavor violating semileptonic tau\ndecays within this model.\n", "  The problem of longitudinal oscillations of an electric field and a charge\npolarization density in QED vacuum is considered. Within the framework of\nsemiclassical analysis, we calculate time-periodic solutions of bosonized\n(1+1)-dimensional QED (massive Schwinger model). Applying the Bohr--Sommerfeld\nquantization condition, we determine the mass spectrum of charge-zero bound\nstates (plasmons) which correspond in quantum theory to the found classical\nsolutions. We show that the existence of such plasmons does not contradict any\nfundamental physical laws and study qualitatively their excitation in\n(3+1)-dimensional real world.\n", "  We present a new framework for testing the isotropy of the Universe using\ncosmic microwave background data, building on the nested-sampling ANICOSMO\ncode. Uniquely, we are able to constrain the scalar, vector and tensor degrees\nof freedom alike; previous studies only considered the vector mode (linked to\nvorticity). We employ Bianchi type VII$_h$ cosmologies to model the anisotropic\nUniverse, from which other types may be obtained by taking suitable limits. In\na separate development, we improve the statistical analysis by including the\neffect of Bianchi power in the high-$\\ell$, as well as the low-$\\ell$,\nlikelihood. To understand the effect of all these changes, we apply our new\ntechniques to WMAP data. We find no evidence for anisotropy, constraining shear\nin the vector mode to $(\\sigma_V/H)_0 < 1.7 \\times 10^{-10}$ (95% CL). For the\nfirst time, we place limits on the tensor mode; unlike other modes, the tensor\nshear can grow from a near-isotropic early Universe. The limit on this type of\nshear is $(\\sigma_{T,\\rm reg}/H)_0 < 2.4 \\times 10^{-7}$ (95% CL).\n", "  Information technologies require entangling data stability with encryption\nfor a next generation of secure data storage. Current magnetic memories,\nranging from low-density stripes up to high-density hard drives, can ultimately\nbe detected using routinely available probes or manipulated by external\nmagnetic perturbations. Antiferromagnetic resistors feature unrivalled\nrobustness but the stable resistive states reported scarcely differ by more\nthan a fraction of a percent at room temperature. Here we show that the\nmetamagnetic (ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic) transition in intermetallic\nFe0.50Rh0.50 can be electrically controlled in a magnetoelectric\nheterostructure to reveal or cloak a given ferromagnetic state. From an aligned\nferromagnetic phase, magnetic states are frozen into the antiferromagnetic\nphase by the application of an electric field, thus eliminating the stray field\nand likewise making it insensitive to external magnetic field. Application of a\nreverse electric field reverts the antiferromagnetic state to the original\nferromagnetic state. Our work demonstrates the building blocks of a feasible,\nextremely stable, non-volatile, electrically addressable, low-energy\ndissipation, magnetoelectric multiferroic memory.\n", "  We discuss the conditions for an effective field theory (EFT) to give an\nadequate low-energy description of an underlying physics beyond the Standard\nModel (SM). Starting from the EFT where the SM is extended by dimension-6\noperators, experimental data can be used without further assumptions to measure\n(or set limits on) the EFT parameters. The interpretation of these results\nrequires instead a set of broad assumptions (e.g. power counting rules) on the\nUV dynamics. This allows one to establish, in a bottom-up approach, the\nvalidity range of the EFT description, and to assess the error associated with\nthe truncation of the EFT series. We give a practical prescription on how\nexperimental results could be reported, so that they admit a maximally broad\nrange of theoretical interpretations. Namely, the experimental constraints on\ndimension-6 operators should be reported as functions of the kinematic\nvariables that set the relevant energy scale of the studied process. This is\nespecially important for hadron collider experiments where collisions probe a\nwide range of energy scales.\n", "  We propose a model for the theoretical description of a weak-link Josephson\njunction, in which the weak link is spin-polarized due to proximity to a\nferromagnetic metal (S-(F|S)-S). Employing Usadel transport theory appropriate\nfor diffusive systems, we show that the weak link is described within the\nframework of Andreev circuit theory by an effective self-energy resulting from\nthe implementation of spin-dependent boundary conditions. This leads to a\nconsiderable simplification of the model, and allows for an efficient numerical\ntreatment. As an application of our model, we show numerical calculations of\nimportant physical observables such as the local density of states,\nproximity-induced minigaps, spin-magnetization, and the phase and\ntemperature-dependence of Josephson currents of the S-(F|S)-S system. We\ndiscuss multi-valued current-phase relationships at low temperatures as well as\ntheir crossover to sinusoidal form at high temperatures. Additionally, we\nnumerically treat (S-F-S) systems that exhibit a magnetic domain wall in the F\nregion and calculate the temperature- dependence of the critical currents.\n", "  Galaxies and their dark matter haloes are part of a complex network of mass\nstructures, collectively called the cosmic web. Using the tidal tensor\nprescription these structures can be classified into four cosmic environments:\nvoids, sheets, filaments and knots. As the cosmic web may influence the\nformation and evolution of dark matter haloes and the galaxies they host, we\naim to study the effect of these cosmic environments on the average mass of\ngalactic haloes. To this end we measure the galaxy-galaxy lensing profile of\n91,195 galaxies, within 0.039 < z < 0.263, from the spectroscopic Galaxy And\nMass Assembly (GAMA) survey, using ~100 square degrees of overlapping data from\nthe Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS). In each of the four cosmic environments we model\nthe contributions from group centrals, satellites and neighbouring groups to\nthe stacked galaxy-galaxy lensing profiles. After correcting the lens samples\nfor differences in the stellar mass distribution, we find no dependence of the\naverage halo mass of central galaxies on their cosmic environment. We do find a\nsignificant increase in the average contribution of neighbouring groups to the\nlensing profile in increasingly dense cosmic environments. We show, however,\nthat the observed effect can be entirely attributed to the galaxy density at\nmuch smaller scales (within 4 Mpc/h), which is correlated with the density of\nthe cosmic environments. Within our current uncertainties we find no direct\ndependence of galaxy halo mass on their cosmic environment.\n", "  We present a method to describe driven-dissipative multi-mode systems by\nconsidering a truncated hierarchy of equations for the correlation functions.\nWe consider two hierarchy truncation schemes with a global cutoff on the\ncorrelation order, which is the sum of the exponents of the operators involved\nin the correlation functions: a 'hard' cutoff corresponding to an expansion\naround the vacuum, which applies to a regime where the number of excitations\nper site is small; a 'soft' cutoff which corresponds to an expansion around\ncoherent states, which can be applied for large excitation numbers per site.\nThis approach is applied to describe the bunching-antibunching transition in\nthe driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard model for photonic systems. The results\nhave been successfully benchmarked by comparison with calculations based on the\ncorner-space renormalization method in 1D and 2D systems. The regime of\nvalidity and strengths of the present truncation methods are critically\ndiscussed.\n", "  We simulate the process of continuous homodyne detection of the radiative\nemission from a quantum system, and we investigate how a Bayesian analysis can\nbe employed to determine unknown parameters that govern the system evolution.\nMeasurement back-action quenches the system dynamics at all times and we show\nthat the ensuing transient evolution is more sensitive to system parameters\nthan the steady state of the system. The parameter sensitivity can be\nquantified by the Fisher information, and we investigate numerically and\nanalytically how the temporal noise correlations in the measurement signal\ncontribute to the ultimate sensitivity limit of homodyne detection.\n", "  We report the detection of a significant infrared variability of the nearest\ntidal disruption event (TDE) ASASSN-14li using Wide-field Infrared Survey\nExplorer} and newly released Near-Earth Object WISE Reactivation} data. In\ncomparison with the quiescent state, the infrared flux is brightened by 0.12\nand 0.16 magnitude in the W1 ($3.4\\mu$m) and W2 ($4.6\\mu$m) bands at 36 days\nafter the optical discovery (or $\\sim110$ days after the peak disruption date).\nThe flux excess is still detectable $\\sim170$ more days later. Assuming that\nthe flare-like infrared emission is from the dust around the black hole, its\nblackbody temperature is estimated to be $\\sim2.1\\times10^3$~K, slightly higher\nthan the dust sublimation temperature, indicating that the dust is likely\nlocated close to the dust sublimation radius. The equilibrium between the\nheating and radiation of the dust claims a bolometric luminosity of\n$\\sim10^{43}-10^{45}$~\\lum, comparable with the observed peak luminosity. This\nresult has for the first time confirmed the detection of infrared emission from\nthe dust echoes of TDEs.\n", "  We propose a simple model quantum network consisting of diamond-shaped\nplaquettes with deterministic distribution of magnetic and non-magnetic atoms\nin presence of a uniform external magnetic flux in each plaquette and predict\nthat such a simple model can be a prospective candidate for spin filter as well\nas flux driven spintronic switch. The orientations and the amplitudes of the\nsubstrate magnetic moments play a crucial role in the energy band engineering\nof the two spin channels which essentially gives us a control over the spin\ntransmission leading to a spin filtering effect. The externally tunable\nmagnetic flux plays an important role in inducing a switch on-switch off effect\nfor both the spin states indicating the behavior like a spintronic switch. Even\na correlated disorder configuration in the on-site potentials and in the\nmagnetic moments may lead to disorder-induced spin filtering phenomenon where\none of the spin channel gets entirely blocked leaving the other one\ntransmitting over the entire allowed energy regime. All these features are\nestablished by evaluating the density of states and the two terminal\ntransmission probabilities using the transfer-matrix formalism within a\ntight-binding framework. Experimental realization of our theoretical study may\nbe helpful in designing new spintronic devices.\n", "  We have implemented upgrades to the University of Wyoming's Red Buttes\nObservatory (RBO) to allow remote and autonomous operations using the 0.6 m\ntelescope. Detailed descriptions of hardware and software components provide\nsufficient information to guide upgrading similarly designed telescopes. We\nalso give a thorough description of the automated and remote operation modes\nwith intent to inform the construction of routines elsewhere. Because the\nupgrades were largely driven by the intent to perform exoplanet transit\nphotometry, we discuss how this science informed the automation process. A\nsample exoplanet transit observation serves to demonstrate RBO's capability to\nperform precision photometry. The successful upgrades have equipped a legacy\nobservatory for a new generation of automated and rapid-response observations.\n", "  We report complex PT-symmetric multi-soliton solutions to the Korteweg\nde-Vries equation that asymptotically contain one-soliton solutions, with each\nof them possessing the same amount of finite real energy. We demonstrate how\nthese solutions originate from degenerate energy solutions of the Schroedinger\nequation. Technically this is achieved by the application of Darboux-Crum\ntransformations involving Jordan states with suitable regularizing shifts.\nAlternatively they may be constructed from a limiting process within the\ncontext Hirota's direct method or on a nonlinear superposition obtained from\nmultiple Baecklund transformations. The proposed procedure is completely\ngeneric and also applicable to other types of nonlinear integrable systems.\n", "  We present a comprehensive study of the determination of the strong coupling\nfrom $\\tau$ decay, using the most recent release of the experimental ALEPH\ndata. We critically review all theoretical strategies used in previous works\nand put forward various novel approaches which allow to study complementary\naspects of the problem. We investigate the advantages and disadvantages of the\ndifferent methods, trying to uncover their potential hidden weaknesses and test\nthe stability of the obtained results under slight variations of the assumed\ninputs. We perform several determinations, using different methodologies, and\nfind a very consistent set of results. All determinations are in excellent\nagreement, and allow us to extract a very reliable value for\n$\\alpha_s(m_\\tau^2)$. The main uncertainty originates in the pure perturbative\nerror from unknown higher orders. Taking into account the systematic\ndifferences between the results obtained with the CIPT and FOPT prescriptions,\nwe find $\\alpha_{s}^{(n_f=3)}(m_\\tau^2) = 0.328 \\pm 0.013$ which implies\n$\\alpha_{s}^{(n_f=5)}(M_Z^{2}) = 0.1197\\pm 0.0015$.\n", "  Multi-configurational approaches yield universal wave function\nparameterizations that can qualitatively well describe electronic structures\nalong reaction pathways. For quantitative results, multi-reference perturbation\ntheory is required to capture dynamic electron correlation from the otherwise\nneglected virtual orbitals. Still, the overall accuracy suffers from the finite\nsize and choice of the active orbital space and peculiarities of the\nperturbation theory. Fortunately, the electronic wave functions at equilibrium\nstructures of reactants and products can often be well described by\nsingle-reference methods and hence are accessible to accurate coupled cluster\ncalculations. Here, we calculate the heterolytic double dissociation energy of\nfour 3d-metallocenes with the complete active space self-consistent field\nmethod and compare to highly accurate coupled cluster data. Our coupled cluster\ndata are well within the experimental error bars. This accuracy can also be\napproached by complete active space calculations with an orbital selection\nbased on information entropy measures. The entropy based active space selection\nis discussed in detail. We find a very subtle balance between static and\ndynamic electron correlation effects that emphasizes the need for algorithmic\nactive space selection and that differs significantly from restricted active\nspace results for identical active spaces reported in the literature.\n", "  In this article, we study the relation between wavefunction overlap and\nadiabatic continuity in gapped quantum systems. We show that for two band\ninsulators, a scalar function can be defined in the momentum space, which\ncharacterizes the wavefunction overlap between Bloch states in the two\ninsulators. If this overlap is nonzero for all momentum points in the Brillouin\nzone, these two insulators are adiabatically connected, i.e. we can deform one\ninsulator into the other smoothly without closing the band gap. In addition, we\nfurther prove that this adiabatic path preserves all the symmetries of the\ninsulators. The existence of such an adiabatic path implies that two insulators\nwith nonzero wavefunction overlap belong to the same topological phase. This\nrelation, between adiabatic continuity and wavefunction overlap, can be further\ngeneralized to correlated systems. The generalized relation cannot be applied\nto study generic many-body systems in the thermodynamic limit, because of the\northogonality catastrophe. However, for certain interacting systems (e.g.\nquantum Hall systems), the quantum wavefunction overlap can be utilized to\ndistinguish different quantum states. Experimental implications are also\ndiscussed.\n", "  We show that the use of shaped pulses improves the fidelity of a Rydberg\nblockade two-qubit entangling gate by several orders of magnitude compared to\nprevious protocols based on square pulses or optimal control pulses. Using\nanalytical Derivative Removal by Adiabatic Gate (DRAG) pulses that reduce\nexcitation of primary leakage states and an analytical method of finding the\noptimal Rydberg blockade we generate Bell states with a fidelity of $F>0.9999$\nin a 300 K environment for a gate time of only $50\\;{\\rm ns}$, which is an\norder of magnitude faster than previous protocols. These results establish the\npotential of neutral atom qubits with Rydberg blockade gates for scalable\nquantum computation.\n", "  Shaking a lattice system, by modulating the location of its sites\nperiodically in time, is a powerful method to create effective magnetic fields\nin engineered quantum systems, such as cold gases trapped in optical lattices.\nHowever, such schemes are typically associated with space-dependent effective\nmasses (tunneling amplitudes) and non-uniform flux patterns. In this work we\ninvestigate this phenomenon theoretically, by computing the effective\nHamiltonians and quasienergy spectra associated with several kinds of\nlattice-shaking protocols. A detailed comparison with a method based on moving\nlattices, which are added on top of a main static optical lattice, is provided.\nThis study allows the identification of novel shaking schemes, which\nsimultaneously provide uniform effective mass and magnetic flux, with direct\nimplications for cold-atom experiments and photonics.\n", "  Detailed quantum chemistry calculations within the multireference\nconfiguration interaction approximation with the Davidson correction (MRCI+Q)\nare presented using an aug-cc-pV6Z basis set, for the potential energy curves\nand transition dipole moments between low lying molecular states of singlet\nspin symmetry for the SiO molecule. The high quality molecular data are used to\nobtain radiative association cross sections and rate coefficients for\ncollisions between ground state Si and O atoms. Quantal calculations are\ncompared with semiclassical results. Using a quantum kinetic theory of\nradiative association in which quasibound levels are assumed to be in local\nthermodynamic equilibrium, we find that resonances play an important role in\nenhancing the rate coefficients at low temperatures by several orders of\nmagnitude from that predicted by standard quantum scattering formulations.\nThese new molecular formation rates may have important implications for\napplications in astrophysics.\n", "  Self-propelled particles can spontaneously form dense phases from a dilute\nsuspension in a process referred to as motility-induced phase separation. The\nproperties of the out-of-equilibrium structures that are formed are governed by\nthe specifics of the particle interactions and the strength of the activity.\nThus far, most studies into the formation of these structures have focused on\nspherical colloids, dumbbells, and rod-like particles endowed with various\ninteraction potentials. Only a few studies have examined the collective\nbehavior of more complex particle shapes. Here, we increase the geometric\ncomplexity and use Molecular Dynamics simulations to consider the structures\nformed by triangular self-propelled particles with surface roughness. These\ntriangles either move towards their apex or towards their base, i.e., they\npossess a polarity. We find that apex-directed triangles cluster more readily,\nmore stably, and have a smoother cluster interface than their base-directed\ncounterparts. A difference between the two polarities is in line with the\nresults of [H.H. Wensink, et al., Phys. Rev. E 89, 010302(R) (2014)], however,\nwe obtain the reversed result when it comes to clustering, namely that\napex-directed particles cluster more readily. We further show that reducing the\nsurface roughness negatively impacts the stability of the base-directed\nstructures, suggesting that their formation is in large part due to surface\nroughness. Our results lay a solid foundation for future experimental and\ncomputational studies into the effect of roughness on the collective dynamics\nof swimmers.\n", "  The spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in semiconductors is strongly influenced by\nstructural asymmetries, as prominently observed in bulk crystal structures that\nlack inversion symmetry. Here, we study an additional effect on the SOC: the\nasymmetry induced by the large interface area between a nanowire core and its\nsurrounding shell. Our experiments on purely wurtzite GaAs/AlGaAs core/shell\nnanowires demonstrate optical spin injection into a single free-standing\nnanowire and determine the effective electron g-factor of the hexagonal GaAs\nwurtzite phase. The spin relaxation is highly anisotropic in time-resolved\nmicro-photoluminescence measurements on single nanowires, showing a significant\nincrease of spin relaxation in external magnetic fields. This behavior is\ncounterintuitive compared to bulk wurtzite crystals. We present a model for the\nobserved electron spin dynamics highlighting the dominant role of the\ninterface-induced SOC in these core/shell nanowires. This enhanced SOC may\nrepresent an interesting tuning parameter for the implementation of\nspin-orbitronic concepts in semiconductor-based structures.\n", "  Searches for new resonances decaying into two photons in the ATLAS experiment\nat the CERN Large Hadron Collider are described. The analysis is based on\nproton--proton collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.2\nfb$^{-1}$ at $\\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV recorded in 2015. Two searches are performed,\none targeted at a spin-2 particle of mass larger than 500 GeV, using\nRandall--Sundrum graviton states as a benchmark model, and one optimized for a\nspin-0 particle of mass larger than 200 GeV. Varying both the mass and the\ndecay width, the most significant deviation from the background-only hypothesis\nis observed at a diphoton invariant mass around 750 GeV with local\nsignificances of 3.8 and 3.9 standard deviations in the searches optimized for\na spin-2 and spin-0 particle, respectively. The global significances are\nestimated to be 2.1 standard deviations for both analyses. The consistency\nbetween the data collected at 13 TeV and 8 TeV is also evaluated. Limits on the\nproduction cross section times branching ratio to two photons for the two\nresonance types are reported.\n", "  We consider the production of pairs of Standard Model Higgs bosons via gluon\nfusion. Until recently the full dependence on the top quark mass $M_t$ was not\nknown at next-to-leading order. For this reason we apply an approximation based\non the expansion for large top quark masses up to $\\mathcal{O}(1/M_t^{12})$. At\nnext-to-next-to-leading order we avoid the calculation of real corrections via\nthe soft-virtual approximation and obtain top quark mass corrections up to\n$\\mathcal{O}(1/M_t^4)$. We use our results to estimate the residual uncertainty\nof the total cross section due to a finite top quark mass to be\n$\\mathcal{O}(10\\%)$ at next-to-leading order and $\\mathcal{O}(5\\%)$ at\nnext-to-next-to-leading order.\n", "  We study the power spectra of f(R) inflation using a new technique in which\nthe norm-squared of the mode functions is evolved. Our technique results in\nexcellent analytic approximations for how the spectra depend upon the function\n$f(R)$. Although the spectra are numerically the same in the Jordan and\nEinstein frames for the same wave number $k$, they depend upon the geometries\nof these frames in quite different ways. For example, the power spectra in the\ntwo frames are different functions of the number of e-foldings until end of\ninflation. We discuss how future data on reheating can be used to distinguish\nf(R) inflation from scalar-driven inflation.\n", "  Searches for extra-terrestrial intelligence (SETI) using large survey data\noften look for possible signatures of astroengineering. We propose to search\nfor physically impossible effects caused by highly advanced technology, by\ncarrying out a search for disappearing galaxies and Milky Way stars. We select\n$\\sim$ 10 million objects from USNO-B1.0 with low proper motion ($\\mu$ $<$ 20\nmilli arcseconds / year) imaged on the sky in two epochs. We search for objects\nnot found at the expected positions in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) by\nvisually examining images of $\\sim$ 290 000 USNO-B1.0 objects with no\ncounterpart in the SDSS. We identify some spurious targets in the USNO-B1.0. We\nfind one candidate of interest for follow-up photometry, although it is very\nuncertain. If the candidate eventually is found, it defines the probability of\nobserving a disappearing-object event the last decade to less than one in one\nmillion in the given samples. Nevertheless, since the complete USNO-B1.0\ndataset is 100 times larger than any of our samples, we propose an easily\naccessible citizen science project in search of USNO-B1.0 objects which have\ndisappeared from the SDSS.\n", "  We present an efficient numerical approach for treating ballistic quantum\ntransport across devices described by tight binding (TB) Hamiltonians\ndesignated to systems with localized potential defects. The method is based on\nthe wave function matching approach, Lippmann-Schwinger equation (LEQ) and the\nscattering matrix formalism. We show that the number of matrix elements of the\nGreen's function to be evaluated for the unperturbed system can be essentially\nreduced by projection of the time reversed scattering wave functions on LEQ\nwhich radically improves the speed and lowers the memory consumption of the\ncalculations. Our approach can be applied to quantum devices of an arbitrary\ngeometry and any number of degrees of freedom or leads attached. We provide a\ncouple of examples of possible applications of the theory, including current\nequilibration at the p-n junction in graphene and scanning gate microscopy\nmapping of electron trajectories in the magnetic focusing experiment on a\ngraphene ribbon. Additionally, we provide a simple toy example of electron\ntransport through 1D wire with added onsite perturbation and obtain a simple\nformula for conductance showing that Green's function of the device can be\nobtained from the conductance versus impurity strength characteristics.\n", "  We examine the feasibility of strongly-coupled stimulated Brillouin\nscattering as a mechanism for the plasma-based amplification of sub-picosecond\npulses. In particular, we use fluid theory and particle-in-cell simulations to\ncompare the relative advantages of Raman and Brillouin amplification over a\nbroad range of achievable parameters.\n", "  We explore the supersymmetry invariance of a supergravity theory in the\npresence of a non-trivial boundary. The explicit construction of a bulk\nLagrangian based on an enlarged superalgebra, known as $AdS$-Lorentz, is\npresented. Using a geometric approach we show that the supersymmetric extension\nof a Gauss-Bonnet like gravity is required in order to restore the\nsupersymmetry invariance of the theory.\n", "  When a colloid is mixed with a depletant such as a non-adsorbing polymer, one\nobserves attractive effective interactions between the colloidal particles. If\nthese particles are anisotropic, analysis of these effective interactions is\nchallenging in general. We present a method for inference of approximate\n(coarse-grained) effective interaction potentials between such anisotropic\nparticles. Using the example of indented (lock-and-key) colloids, we show how\nnumerical solutions can be used to integrate out the (hard sphere) depletant,\nleading to a depletion potential that accurately characterises the effective\ninteractions. The accuracy of the method is based on matching of contributions\nto the second virial coefficient of the colloids. The simplest version of our\nmethod yields a piecewise-constant effective potential; we also show how this\nscheme can be generalised to other functional forms, where appropriate.\n", "  It is a well-known fact that helicity is a Lorentz-invariant for massless but\nnot for massive particles. Nevertheless, a satisfactory proof of this fact and\na detailed analysis on the relative orientation between spin and the momentum\nare not readily available. One such analysis was presented by Wigner where a\nformula for the angle between the spin and the momentum is derived for massive\nparticle states undergoing two successive boosts in orthogonal directions. In\nthis note, using the Wigner rotation, an alternative derivation is provided.\n", "  We present a new, high-resolution chronographic (age) map of the Milky Way's\nhalo, based on the inferred ages of ~130,000 field blue horizontal-branch (BHB)\nstars with photometry from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Our map exhibits a\nstrong central concentration of BHB stars with ages greater than 12 Gyr,\nextending up to ~15 kpc from the Galactic center (reaching close to the solar\nvicinity), and a decrease in the mean ages of field stars with distance by\n1-1.5 Gyr out to ~45-50 kpc, along with an apparent increase of the dispersion\nof stellar ages, and numerous known (and previously unknown) resolved\nover-densities and debris streams, including the Sagittarius Stream. These\nresults agree with expectations from modern LambdaCDM cosmological simulations,\nand support the existence of a dual (inner/outer) halo system, punctuated by\nthe presence of over-densities and debris streams that have not yet completely\nphase-space mixed.\n", "  In a topological insulator (TI), if its spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strength is\ngradually reduced, the TI eventually transforms into a trivial insulator beyond\na critical point of SOC, at which point the bulk gap closes: this is the\nstandard description of the topological phase transition (TPT). However, this\ndescription of TPT, driven solely by the SOC (or something equivalent) and\nfollowed by closing and reopening of the bulk band gap, is valid only for\ninfinite-size samples, and little is known how TPT occurs for finite-size\nsamples. Here, using both systematic transport measurements on\ninterface-engineered(Bi$_{1-x}$In$_x$)$_2$Se$_3$ thin films and theoretical\nsimulations (with animations in Supporting Information) we show that\ndescription of TPT in finite-size samples needs to be substantially modified\nfrom the conventional picture of TPT due to surface-state hybridization and\nbulk confinement effects. We also show that the finite-size TPT is composed of\ntwo separate transitions, topological-normal transition (TNT) and\nmetal-insulator transition (MIT) by providing a detailed phase diagram in the\ntwo-dimensional phase space of sample size and SOC strength.\n", "  Observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) have the potential for\nallowing the helioseismic study of the formation of hundreds of active regions,\nwhich would enable us to perform statistical analyses. Our goal is to collate a\nuniform data set of emerging active regions observed by the SDO/HMI instrument\nsuitable for helioseismic analysis up to seven days before emergence. We\nrestricted the sample to active regions that were visible in the continuum and\nemerged into quiet Sun largely avoiding pre-existing magnetic regions. As a\nreference data set we paired a control region (CR), with the same latitude and\ndistance from central meridian, with each emerging active region (EAR). We call\nthis data set, which is currently comprised of 105 emerging active regions\nobserved between May 2010 and November 2012, the SDO Helioseismic Emerging\nActive Region (SDO/HEAR) survey. To demonstrate the utility of a data set of a\nlarge number of emerging active regions, we measure the relative east-west\nvelocity of the leading and trailing polarities from the line-of-sight\nmagnetogram maps during the first day after emergence. The latitudinally\naveraged line-of-sight magnetic field of all the EARs shows that, on average,\nthe leading (trailing) polarity moves in a prograde (retrograde) direction with\na speed of 121 +/- 22 m/s (-70 +/- 13 m/s) relative to the Carrington rotation\nrate in the first day. However, relative to the differential rotation of the\nsurface plasma, the east-west velocity is symmetric, with a mean of 95 +/- 13\nm/s. The SDO/HEAR data set will not only be useful for helioseismic studies,\nbut will also be useful to study other features such as the surface magnetic\nfield evolution of a large sample of EARs.\n", "  We discuss a general setup which allows the study of the perturbation theory\nof an arbitrary, locally harmonic 1D quantum mechanical potential as well as\nits multi-variable (many-body) generalization. The latter may form a prototype\nfor regularized quantum field theory. We first generalize the method of\nBender-Wu, and derive exact recursion relations which allow the determination\nof the perturbative wave-function and energy corrections to an arbitrary order,\nat least in principle. For 1D systems, we implement these equations in an easy\nto use Mathematica package we call BenderWu. Our package enables quick\nhome-computer computation of high orders of perturbation theory (about 100\norders in 10-30 seconds, and 250 orders in 1-2h) and enables practical study of\na large class of problems in Quantum Mechanics. We have two hopes concerning\nthe BenderWu package. One is that due to resurgence, large amount of\nnon-perturbative information, such as non-perturbative energies and\nwave-functions (e.g. WKB wave functions), can in principle be extracted from\nthe perturbative data. We also hope that the package may be used as a teaching\ntool, providing an effective bridge between perturbation theory and\nnon-perturbative physics in textbooks. Finally, we show that for the\nmulti-variable case, the recursion relation acquires a geometric character, and\nhas a structure which allows easy parallelization to computer clusters.\n", "  In this work, we study the exact solution of Dirac equation in the\nhyper-spherical coordinate under influence of separable q-Deformed quantum\npotentials. The q-deformed hyperbolic Rosen-Morse potential is perturbed by\nq-deformed non-central trigonometric Scarf potentials, where whole of them can\nbe solved by using Asymptotic Iteration Method (AIM). This work is limited to\nspin symmetry case. The relativistic energy equation and orbital quantum number\nequation lD-1 have been obtained using Asymptotic Iteration Method. The upper\nradial wave function equations and angular wave function equations are also\nobtained by using this method. The relativistic energy levels are numerically\ncalculated using Mat Lab, the increase of radial quantum number n causes the\nincrease of bound state relativistic energy level both in dimension D = 5 and D\n= 3. The bound state relativistic energy level decreases with increasing of\nboth deformation parameter q and orbital quantum number nl.\n", "  The invariance of the Lagrangian under time translations and rotations in\nKepler's problem yields the conservation laws related to the energy and angular\nmomentum. Noether's theorem reveals that these same symmetries furnish\ngeneralized forms of the first integrals in a special nonconservative case,\nwhich approximates various physical models. The system is perturbed by a\nbiparametric acceleration with components along the tangential and normal\ndirections. A similarity transformation reduces the biparametric disturbance to\na simpler uniparametric forcing along the velocity vector. The solvability\nconditions of this new problem are discussed, and closed-form solutions for the\nintegrable cases are provided. Thanks to the conservation of a generalized\nenergy, the orbits are classified as elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic.\nKeplerian orbits appear naturally as particular solutions to the problem. After\ncharacterizing the orbits independently, a unified form of the solution is\nbuilt based on the Weierstrass elliptic functions. The new trajectories involve\nfundamental curves such as cardioids and logarithmic, sinusoidal, and Cotes'\nspirals. These orbits can represent the motion of particles perturbed by solar\nradiation pressure, of spacecraft with continuous thrust propulsion, and some\ninstances of Schwarzschild geodesics. Finally, the problem is connected with\nother known integrable systems in celestial mechanics.\n", "  Using as a testbed the recently proposed \"gravcat\" experimental scheme in\n[1], we compare the properties of gravitational cat states in three\ndescriptions: (1) canonical quantum theory (CQT) combined with the Newtonian\nlimit of GR, (2) objective collapse theories (OCTs) extended to the regime of\nsemiclassical Newtonian gravity, and (3) OCTs extended to incorporate quantized\nNewtonian gravity. For the CQT approach, we follow the treatment of Hu and\nAnastopoulos in [2]. For the OCTs, we consider the GRW, CSL, DP, and Karolyhazy\ntheories, based on the semiclassical approaches of Derakhshani [3] and\nTilloy-Diosi [4], respectively, and we consider the most straightforward\nextension of the aforementioned OCTs to the regime of quantized Newtonian\ngravity. We show that the gravitational cat scheme can, in principle,\nexperimentally discriminate the quantum jumps in gravitational cat states\npredicted by the CQT approach and the quantized-gravity OCTs (which we show\nmake effectively the same predictions as each other), from the predictions of\nthe semiclassical-gravitational OCTs. We also show that the GRW and Karolyhazy\nversions of semiclassical gravity (based on Derakhshani's approach) make\ndistinctly different predictions from the CSL and DP versions of semiclassical\ngravity (based either on Derakhshani's approach or the Tilloy-Diosi approach).\n", "  We investigate the accuracy of an approximate radiative transfer technique\nthat was first proposed by Kylafis & Bahcall (hereafter the KB approximation)\nand has been popular in modelling dusty late-type galaxies. We compare\nrealistic galaxy models calculated with the KB approximation with those of a\nthree-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative transfer code SKIRT. The SKIRT code\nfully takes into account of the contribution of multiple scattering whereas the\nKB approximation calculates only single scattered intensity and multiple\nscattering components are approximated. We find that the KB approximation gives\nfairly accurate results if optically thin, face-on galaxies are considered.\nHowever, for highly inclined ($i \\gtrsim 85^{\\circ}$) and/or optically thick\n(central face-on optical depth $\\gtrsim1$) galaxy models, the approximation can\ngive rise to substantial errors, sometimes, up to $\\gtrsim 40\\%$. Moreover, it\nis also found that the KB approximation is not always physical, sometimes\nproducing infinite intensities at lines of sight with high optical depth in\nedge-on galaxy models. There is no \"simple recipe\" to correct the errors of the\nKB approximation that is universally applicable to any galaxy models.\nTherefore, it is recommended that the full radiative transfer calculation be\nused, even though it's slower than the KB approximation.\n", "  Dalessandro et al. observed a similar distribution for blue straggler stars\nand main-sequence turn-off stars in the Galactic globular cluster NGC 6101, and\ninterpreted this feature as an indication that this cluster is not\nmass-segregated. Using direct N-body simulations, we find that a significant\namount of mass segregation is expected for a cluster with the mass, radius and\nage of NGC 6101. Therefore, the absence of mass segregation cannot be explained\nby the argument that the cluster is not yet dynamically evolved. By varying the\nretention fraction of stellar-mass black holes, we show that segregation is not\nobservable in clusters with a high black hole retention fraction (>50% after\nsupernova kicks and >50% after dynamical evolution). Yet all model clusters\nhave the same amount of mass segregation in terms of the decline of the mean\nmass of stars and remnants with distance to the centre. We also discuss how\nkinematics can be used to further constrain the presence of a stellar-mass\nblack hole population and distinguish it from the effect of an\nintermediate-mass black hole. Our results imply that the kick velocities of\nblack holes are lower than those of neutron stars. The large retention fraction\nduring its dynamical evolution can be explained if NGC 6101 formed with a large\ninitial radius in a Milky Way satellite.\n", "  Rapid and luminous flares of non-thermal radiation observed in blazars\nrequire an efficient mechanism of energy dissipation and particle acceleration\nin relativistic active galactic nuclei (AGN) jets. Particle acceleration in\nrelativistic magnetic reconnection is being actively studied by kinetic\nnumerical simulations. Relativistic reconnection produces hard power-law\nelectron energy distributions N(gamma) = N_0 gamma^(-p) exp(-gamma/gamma_max)\nwith index p -> 1 and exponential cut-off Lorentz factor gamma_max ~ sigma in\nthe limit of magnetization sigma = B^2/(4 pi w) >> 1 (where w is the\nrelativistic enthalpy density). Reconnection in electron-proton plasma can\nadditionally boost gamma_max by the mass ratio m_p/m_e. Hence, in order to\naccelerate particles to gamma_max ~ 10^6 in the case of BL Lacs, reconnection\nshould proceed in plasma of very high magnetization sigma_max >~ 10^3. On the\nother hand, moderate mean jet magnetization values are required for magnetic\nbulk acceleration of relativistic jets, sigma_mean ~ Gamma_j <~ 20 (where\nGamma_j is the jet bulk Lorentz factor). I propose that the systematic\ndependence of gamma_max on blazar luminosity class -- the blazar sequence --\nmay result from a systematic trend in sigma_max due to homogeneous loading of\nleptons by pair creation regulated by the energy density of high-energy\nexternal radiation fields. At the same time, relativistic AGN jets should be\nhighly inhomogeneous due to filamentary loading of protons, which should\ndetermine the value of sigma_mean roughly independently of the blazar class.\n", "  Various contenders for a complete theory of quantum gravity are at odds with\neach other. This is in particular seen in the ways they relate to information\nand black holes, and how to effectively treat quantization of the background\nspacetime. Modern perspectives on black hole evaporation suggest that quantum\ngravity effects in the near-horizon region can perturb the local geometry. The\napproaches differ, however, in the time scale on which one can expect these\neffects to become important. This panel session presents three points of view\non these problems, and considers the ultimate prospect of observational tests\nin the near future.\n", "  This paper is a contribution to a program to see symmetry breaking in a\nweakly interacting many Boson system on a three dimensional lattice at low\ntemperature. It is part of an analysis of the \"small field\" approximation to\nthe \"parabolic flow\" which exhibits the formation of a \"Mexican hat\" potential\nwell.

Here we prove the existence of and bounds on the background and critical\nfields that arise from the steepest descent attack that is at the core of our\nrenormalization group step anaylsis of these models.\n", "  Many quantum technologies are now reaching a high level of maturity and\ncontrol, and it is likely that the first demonstrations of suppression of\nnaturally occurring quantum noise using small topological error correcting\ncodes will soon be possible. In doing this it will be necessary to define clear\nachievable metrics to measure and compare the performance of real codes. Here\nwe consider the smallest examples of several families of topological codes:\nsurface codes, color codes, and the gauge color code, and determine the minimum\nrequirements to demonstrate error suppression. We use an exact decoder to\ncompare the performance of the codes under simple models of both physical error\nand measurement error, and determine regions of correctability in the physical\nparameters for each code.\n", "  We show that limit shapes for the stochastic 6-vertex model on a cylinder\nwith the uniform boundary state on one end are solutions to the Burger type\nequation. Solutions to these equations are studied for step initial conditions.\nWhen the circumference of the cylinder goes to infinity the solution\ncorresponding to critical initial densities coincides with the one found by\nBorodin, Corwin and Gorin.\n", "  Perfect cloning of a known set of states with arbitrary prior probabilities\nis possible if we allow the cloner to sometimes fail completely. In the optimal\ncase the probability of failure is at its minimum allowed by the laws of\nquantum mechanics. Here we show that it is possible to lower the failure rate\nbelow that of the perfect probabilistic cloner but the price to pay is that the\nclones are not perfect; the global fidelity is less than one. We determine the\noptimal fidelity of a cloner with a Fixed Failure Rate (FFR cloner) in the case\nof a pair of known states. Optimality is shown to be attainable by a\nmeasure-and-prepare protocol in the limit of infinitely many clones. The\noptimal protocol consists of discrimination with a fixed rate of inconclusive\noutcome followed by preparation of the appropriate clones. The convergence\nshows a symmetry-breaking second-order phase transition in the fidelity of the\napproximate infinite clones.\n", "  We present a brief qualitative overview of the current state of the problem\nof Hubble expansion at the sufficiently small scales (e.g., in planetary\nsystems or local intergalactic volume). The crucial drawbacks of the available\ntheoretical treatments are emphasized, and the possible ways to avoid them are\noutlined. Attention is drawn to a number of observable astronomical phenomena\nthat could be naturally explained by the local Hubble expansion.\n", "  In this work, we numerically consider the initial value problem for nonlinear\nSchr\\\"odinger (NLS) type models arising in the physics of ultracold boson\ngases, with generic Gaussian wavepacket initial data. The corresponding\nGaussian's width and, wherever relevant also its amplitude, serve as control\nparameters. First we explore the one-dimensional, standard NLS equation with\ngeneral power law nonlinearity, in which large amplitude excitations\nreminiscent of Peregrine solitons or regular solitons appear to form, as the\nwidth of the relevant Gaussian is varied. Furthermore, the variation of the\nnonlinearity exponent aims at a first glimpse of the interplay between rogue or\nsoliton formation and collapse features. The robustness of the main features to\nnoise in the initial data is also confirmed. To better connect our study with\nthe physics of atomic condensates, and explore the role of dimensionality\neffects, we also consider the nonpolynomial Schr\\\"odinger equation (NPSE), as\nwell as the full three-dimensional NLS equation, and examine the degree to\nwhich relevant considerations generalize.\n", "  A rather simple car driving simulator was created based on the available open\nsource engine TORCS and used to analyze the basic features of human behavior in\ncar driving within the car-following setups. Eight subjects with different\nskill in driving real cars participated in these experiments. They were\ninstructed to drive a virtual car without overtaking the lead car driven by\ncomputer at a fixed speed and not to lose sight of it. Moreover, these\nexperiments were conducted with four different speed including 60km/h, 80km/h,\n100km/h, and 120km/h. Based on the collected data the distribution of the\nheadway, velocity, acceleration, and jerk are constructed and compared with\navailable experimental data collected previously by the analysis of the real\ntraffic flow. A new model for car-following is proposed capture the found\nproperties. As the main results we draw a conclusion that the human behavior in\ncar driving should be categorized as a generalized intermittent control with\nnoise-driven activation of the active phase. Besides, we hypothesize that the\nextended phase space required for modeling human actions in car driving has to\ncomprise four phase variables, namely, the headway distance, the velocity of\ncar, its acceleration, and the car jerk, i.e., the time derivative of the car\nacceleration. This time, the time pattern of pedal pushing and the distribution\nof time derivative of pedal was utilized in addition to previous variables.\nMoreover, all subjects' driving data were categorized as some styles with their\nshapes.\n", "  Running is part of almost every sport, and requires a great amount of\nstamina, endurance, mental toughness and overall strength. At every step, the\nfoot experiences ground reaction forces necessary to support the motion of the\nbody. With the advancements in shoe technology, running shoes have grown in\npopularity among runners, as well as non-runners, because they reduce the risk\nof injuries from the impact felt by the foot. The purpose of this report is to\nanalyze the effect of running shoes on impact forces on the foot. This is\nachieved through the use of three force pads fixed at different locations on\nthe foot The force measured by each sensor is then used to estimate the\nvertical ground reaction force, using the sensors' calibrations equations .\nBased on the ground reaction force, the effective mass corresponding to the\nmomentum change occurring during the transient phase of the impact is\nestimated. The results show that running at 9 miles per hour without running\nshoes generates an effective mass of (14.9 +/- 4.8)% of the total body mass,\nwhile running at the same speed with running shoes generates an effective mass\nof (7.8 +/- 1.5 )% of the total body mass. The values highlight a significant\nreduction in the risk of pain or injuries accomplished by wearing running shoes\n", "  We investigate relations among tree-level off-shell currents in nonlinear\nsigma model. Under Cayley parametrization, we propose and prove a general\nrevised BCJ relation for even-point currents. Unlike the on-shell BCJ relation,\nthe off-shell one behaves quite differently from Yang-Mills theory although the\nalgebraic structure is the same. After performing the permutation summation in\nthe revised BCJ relation, the sum is non-vanishing, instead, it equals to the\nsum of sub-current products with the BCJ coefficients under a specific\nordering, which is presented by an explicit formula. Taking on-shell limit,\nthis identity is reduced to the on-shell BCJ relation, and thus provides the\nfull off-shell correspondence of tree-level BCJ relation in nonlinear sigma\nmodel.\n", "  We use an alternative approach to study the quantum phase transition in a\ncoupled cavity lattice at finite temperature. As an illustrative example, we\ninvestigate the behaviors of the trace distance and quantum phase transition in\na Jaynes-Cummings lattice at finite temperature. It is found that the trace\ndistance can be used to describe the critical point of the quantum phase\ntransition at finite low temperatures and the critical points are sensitive to\nthe atom-field interaction strength and the detuning factor. For\nnon-equilibrium states, we demonstrate that the time evolution of the trace\ndistance's maximum value is also a good indicator of the critical points.\nMoreover, we show that the scaling behavior of derivative of the trace distance\nat the critical points and the scaling rule are dependent on the external\nparameters of the Hamiltonian.\n", "  We use an alternative method to investigate the quantum criticality at zero\nand finite temperature using trace distance along with the density matrix\nrenormalization group. It is shown that the average correlation measured by the\ntrace distance between the system block and environment block in a DMRG sweep\nis able to detect the critical points of quantum phase transitions at finite\ntemperature. As illustrative examples, we study spin-1 XXZ chains with uniaxial\nsingle-ion-type anisotropy and the Heisenberg spin chain with staggered\ncoupling and external magnetic field. It is found that the trace distance shows\ndiscontinuity at the critical points of quantum phase transition and can be\nused as an indicator of QPTs.\n", "  This research highlight (originally published at\nhttp://www.ntu.edu.sg/ias/newsletters/Documents/APPN/APPNv5n2May2016-lowres.pdf)\nintroduces recent developments in Topological Insulators and Holography, and\nprovides an overview of how one can construct a holographic bulk topological\ninsulator from a boundary Chern insulator with small gap.\n", "  The realization of transfer functions of Linear Quantum Stochastic Systems\n(LQSSs) is an issue of fundamental importance for the practical applications of\nsuch systems, especially as coherent controllers for other quantum systems. In\nthis paper, we review two realization methods proposed by the authors in [1],\n[2], [3], [4]. The first one uses a cascade of a static linear quantum-optical\nnetwork and single-mode optical cavities, while the second uses a feedback\nnetwork of such cavities, along with static linear quantum-optical networks\nthat pre- and post-process the cavity network inputs and outputs.\n", "  Twelve seasons, from 2004 to 2015, of photometric monitoring of the\nintermediate polar FO Aqr are presented and are compared with previous\nobservations. The ambiguities in the cycle counting can be lifted and a new O-C\ndiagram, spanning 34 yr, is presented, along with new ephemerides.\n", "  Different experiments have confirmed that the $D_{s0}^{\\ast}(2317)$ and\n$D_{s1}(2460)$ mesons are very narrow states located, respectively, below the\n$DK$ and $D^{\\ast}K$ thresholds. This is markedly in contrast with the\nexpectations of naive quark models and heavy quark symmetry. We address the\nmass shifts of the $c\\bar{s}$ ground states with quantum numbers $J^{P}=0^{+}$\n($D_{s0}^{\\ast}(2317)$) and $J^{P}=1^{+}$ ($D_{s1}(2460)$) using a\nnonrelativistic constituent quark model in which quark-antiquark and\nmeson-meson degrees of freedom are incorporated. The quark model has been\napplied to a wide range of hadronic observables and thus the model parameters\nare completely constrained. We observe that the coupling of the $0^{+}$\n$(1^{+})$ meson sector to the $DK$ $(D^{\\ast}K)$ threshold is a key feature in\nlowering the masses of the corresponding $D_{s0}^{\\ast}(2317)$ and\n$D_{s1}(2460)$ states predicted by the naive quark model, but also in\ndescribing the $D_{s1}(2536)$ meson as the $1^{+}$ state of the\n$j_{q}^{P}=3/2^{+}$ doublet predicted by heavy quark symmetry and thus\nreproducing its strong decay properties. Two features of our formalism cannot\nbe address nowadays by other approaches: the coupling of the $D$-wave\n$D^{\\ast}K$ threshold in the $J^{P}=1^{+}$ $c\\bar{s}$ channel and the\ncomputation of the probabilities associated with different Fock components in\nthe physical state.\n", "  Rubitherm RT 27 is a paraffin-based phase-change material (PCM) in which a\nchange between a solid and liquid phase is used to store/release thermal\nenergy. Its enthalpy and heat capacity, as measured in a quasistatic regime by\nadiabatic scanning calorimetry, has a single distinct jump and peak,\nrespectively, at about 27.3 C. We present a microscopic development from which\nthe jump and peak can be accurately fitted and that could be analogously\napplied even to other PCMs. It enables us to determine the baseline and excess\npart of the heat capacity and thus the latent heat associated with the phase\nchange. It is shown to be about 84 % of the total enthalpy change that occurs\nwithin 5 C from the peak maximum position. The development is based on the\nobservation that PCMs often have polycrystalline structure, being composed of\nmany single-crystalline grains. The enthalpy and heat capacity measured in\nexperiments are therefore interpreted as superpositions of many contributions\nthat come from the individual grains.\n", "  In Phys. Rev. A 74, 030303 (2006), Yung showed that for a one-dimensional\nspin chain of length $N$ and maximum coupling strength $J_{\\max}$, the time\n$t_0$ for a quantum state to transfer from one end of the chain to another is\nbounded by $J_{\\max} t_0\\geq\\pi(N-1)/4$ (even $N$) and $J_{\\max}\nt_0\\geq\\pi\\sqrt{N^2-1}/4$ (odd $N$). The proof for even $N$ was elegant, but\nthe proof for odd $N$ was less so. This note provides a proof for the odd $N$\ncase that is simpler, and more in keeping with the proof for the even case.\n", "  The current study is a pioneering work in presenting the boundary layer\nequations for the two-dimensional flow and heat transfer of the Cross fluid\nover a linearly stretching sheet. The system of partial differential equations\nis turned down into highly non-linear ordinary differential equations by\napplying suitable similarity transformations. The stretching sheet solutions\nare presented via. a numerical technique namely the shooting method and graphs\nare constructed for the shear-thinning as well as shear-thickening regime. The\nimpact of the emerging parameters namely the power-law index , the local\nWeissenberg number and the Prandtl number on the velocity and temperature\nfields are investigated through graphs. Numerical values of the local skin\nfriction coefficient and the local Nusselt number are also presented in tabular\nform. For some limiting cases, comparisons with previously available results in\nthe literature are made and an excellent agreement is achieved.\n", "  Condensed matter systems are complex yet simple. Amidst their complexity, one\noften find order specified by not more than a few parameters. Key to such a\nreductionistic description is an appropriate choice of basis, two of which I\nshall describe in this thesis.\n  The first, an exact mapping known as the Wannier State Representation (WSR),\nprovides an exact Hilbert space correspondence between two intensely-studied\ntopological systems, the Fractional Quantum Hall (FQH) and Fractional Chern\nInsulator (FCI) systems. FQH states exist within the partially filled Landau\nlevels of interacting 2D electron gases under strong magnetic fields, where\nquasiparticles exhibit topologically nontrivial braiding statistics. FCI\nsystems, which are novel lattice realizations of FQH systems without orbital\nmagnetic field, are still not completely understood and will benefit from a\nbasis that explicitly connects them to the much better understood FQH systems.\n  The second basis mapping, the Exact Holographic Mapping (EHM), maps any\nlattice system to a holographic 'bulk' with an additional emergent dimension\nrepresenting energy scale. Devised in the spirit of the highly popular AdS-CFT\ncorrespondence, it attempts to understand the relationship between a given\nsystem and its equivalent dual geometry. In particular, we found excellent\ntheoretical agreement of certain dual geometries from EHM with those expected\nfrom the Ryu-Takanayagi formula relating the bulk geometry with entanglement\nentropy. Additionally, the EHM also proves useful in providing a link between\ndifferent topological quantities, such as relating the Chern number of the\nabovementioned Chern Insulators with the Axion angle of 3D topological\ninsulators.\n", "  Einstein established the theory of general relativity and the corresponding\nfield equation in 1915 and its vacuum solutions were obtained by Schwarzschild\nand Kerr for, respectively, static and rotating black holes, in 1916 and 1963,\nrespectively. They are, however, still playing an indispensable role, even\nafter 100 years of their original discovery, to explain high energy\nastrophysical phenomena. Application of the solutions of Einstein's equation to\nresolve astrophysical phenomena has formed an important branch, namely\nrelativistic astrophysics. I devote this article to enlightening some of the\ncurrent astrophysical problems based on general relativity. However, there seem\nto be some issues with regard to explaining certain astrophysical phenomena\nbased on Einstein's theory alone. I show that Einstein's theory and its\nmodified form, both are necessary to explain modern astrophysical processes, in\nparticular, those related to compact objects.\n", "  We study the extension of the Standard Model (SM) with a light dilaton in a\nfive dimensional warped model. In particular, we analyze the coupling of the\ndilaton with the SM matter fields, compare the model predictions with\nElectroweak Precisions Tests and find the corresponding bounds on the mass of\nthe lightest Kaluza-Klein modes. We also investigate the possibility that the\nHiggs-like resonance found at the LHC can be a dilaton. Finally, we show that\nour set-up can also provide an explanation of the anomalies recently observed\nin $B$-meson decays.\n", "  We measured the intrinsic hysteretic polarization in lossy improper and\nnanoferroelectric systems where the nonhysteretic polarization and leakage are\nlarge and the relaxation takes place over a broader time scale. We used\ndifferent measurement protocols such as standard single triangular voltage\npulse, a pulse train of PUND (Positive Up Negative Down), and an even more\ncomplicated pulse train of fourteen voltage pulses and compared the results\nobtained. We show that a protocol which sends a train of fourteen pulses is\nmore appropriate for extracting relaxed (i.e., time scale independent) and\nintrinsic remanent polarization for these samples. We also point out that it is\npossible to select and design an appropriate measurement protocol depending on\nthe magnitude of polarization and leakage of the system.\n", "  We report quantum interference effects in the electrical conductance of\nchemical vapor deposited graphene nanoconstrictions fabricated using feedback\ncontrolled electroburning. The observed multimode Fabry-Perot interferences can\nbe attributed to reflections at potential steps inside the channel. Sharp\nantiresonance features with a Fano line shape are observed. Theoretical\nmodeling reveals that these Fano resonances are due to localized states inside\nthe constriction, which couple to the delocalized states that also give rise to\nthe Fabry-Perot interference patterns. This study provides new insight into the\ninterplay between two fundamental forms of quantum interference in graphene\nnanoconstrictions.\n", "  The spin excitations from the nonmagnetic charge-ordered insulating state of\n$\\alpha$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$I$_3$ at ambient pressure have been investigated by\nprobing the static and low-frequency dynamic spin susceptibilities via\nsite-selective nuclear magnetic resonance at $^{13}$C sites. The site-dependent\nvalues of the shift and the spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1$ below the\ncharge-ordering transition temperature ($T_{CO} \\approx$ 135 K) demonstrate a\nspin density imbalance in the unit cell, in accord with the charge-density\nratio reported earlier. The shift and $1/T_1$ show activated temperature\ndependence with a static (shift) gap $\\Delta_S \\approx$ 47-52 meV and a dynamic\n($1/T_1$) gap $\\Delta_R \\approx$ 40 meV. The sizes of the gaps are well\ndescribed in terms of a localized spin model, where spin one-half\nantiferromagnetic dimer chains are weakly coupled with each other.\n", "  It is very important to forecast the future solar activity due to its effect\non our planet and near space. Here, we employ the new version of the sunspot\nnumber index (version 2) to analyse the relationship between the solar maximum\namplitude and max-max cycle length proposed by Du (2006). We show that the\ncorrelation between the parameters used by Du (2006) for the prediction of the\nsunspot number (amplitude of the cycle, Rm, and max-max cycle length for two\nsolar cycles before, Pmax-2) disappears when we use solar cycles prior to solar\ncycle 9. We conclude that the correlation between these parameters depends on\nthe time interval selected. Thus, the proposal of Du (2006) should definitively\nnot be considered for prediction purposes.\n", "  In this paper we present result of theoretical calculation of entanglement\nwithin a spin structure of Gd3N@C80 under the in uence of rectangular impulses.\nResearch is conducted using general spin Hamiltonian within SSNQ (spin system\nof N-qubits). Calculation of entanglement with variable impulse is performed\nusing the time-dependent Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with spin-spin\ncorrelation function. We show that long rectangular impulse (t=850ps) can be\nused for maintaining of entanglement value. This allows us to offer a new\nalgorithm which can be used to reduce the challenge of decoherence to logical\nscheme optimization.\n", "  In the book \"String Theory and the Scientific Method\", Richard Dawid\ndescribes a few of the many non-empirical arguments that motivate theoretical\nphysicists' confidence in a theory, taking string theory as case study. I argue\nthat excessive reliance on non-empirical evidence compromises the reliability\nof science, and that precisely the case of string theory well illustrates this\ndanger.\n", "  We discuss the process of deep-inelastic electron scattering (DIS) on the\npolarized deuteron with detection of a nucleon in the nuclear fragmentation\nregion (\"spectator tagging\"). We cover (a) the general structure of the\nsemi-inclusive DIS cross section on a spin-1 target; (b) the tagged structure\nfunctions in the impulse approximation, where deuteron structure is described\nby the $NN$ light-front wave function; (c) the extraction of free neutron\nstructure through on-shell extrapolation in the recoil proton momentum. As an\napplication we consider the extraction of the neutron spin structure function\n$g_{1n}$ through polarized electron scattering on the longitudinally polarized\ndeuteron with proton tagging and on-shell extrapolation. Such measurements\nwould be possible at an Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) with polarized deuteron\nbeams and forward proton detectors.\n", "  The formalism of Quantum Mechanics is derived from the application of\nBayesian probability theory to \"fragile\" systems, i.e. systems that are\nperturbed by the act of measurement. Complex Hilbert spaces, non-commuting\noperators and the trace rule for expectations all arise naturally from the use\nof linear algebra to solve integral equations involving classical probabilities\nover hidden variables. We comment on the case of non-local hidden variables,\nwhere violations of Bell's theorem can be produced, as well as the non-fragile\nlimit of the theory, where all measurements are commutative and the theory\nbecomes analogous to classical statistical mechanics.\n", "  Strong Coulomb repulsion and spin-orbit coupling are known to give rise to\nexotic physical phenomena in transition metal oxides. Initial attempts to\ninvestigate systems where both of these fundamental interactions are comparably\nstrong, such as 3d and 5d complex oxide superlattices, have revealed properties\nthat only slightly differ from the bulk ones of the constituent materials.\nHere, we observe that the interfacial coupling between the 3d antiferromagnetic\ninsulator SrMnO3 and the 5d paramagnetic metal SrIrO3 is enormously strong,\nyielding an anomalous Hall response as the result of charge transfer driven\ninterfacial ferromagnetism. These findings show that low dimensional spin-orbit\nentangled 3d-5d interfaces provide an avenue to uncover technologically\nrelevant physical phenomena unattainable in bulk materials.\n", "  Long wavelength acoustic phonons are normally weakly coupled to other\nvibrational modes in a crystalline system. This is particularly problematic in\nmolecular dynamics calculations where vibrations at the system size scale are\ntypically excited at initiation. The equilibration time for these vibrations\ndepends on the strength of coupling to other modes, so is typically very long.\nA very simple deterministic method which avoids the use of is presented which\nremoves this problem.\n", "  An extended first-principles molecular dynamics (FPMD) method based on\nKohn-Sham scheme is proposed to elevate the temperature limit of the FPMD\nmethod in the calculation of dense plasmas. The extended method treats the wave\nfunctions of high energy electrons as plane waves analytically, and thus\nexpands the application of the FPMD method to the region of hot dense plasmas\nwithout suffering from the formidable computational costs. In addition, the\nextended method inherits the high accuracy of the Kohn-Sham scheme and keeps\nthe information of elec- tronic structures. This gives an edge to the extended\nmethod in the calculation of the lowering of ionization potential, X-ray\nabsorption/emission spectra, opacity, and high-Z dense plasmas, which are of\nparticular interest to astrophysics, inertial confinement fusion engineering,\nand laboratory astrophysics.\n", "  The European School of High-Energy Physics is intended to give young\nphysicists an introduction to the theoretical aspects of recent advances in\nelementary particle physics. These proceedings contain lecture notes on the\nStandard Model of electroweak interactions, quantum chromodynamics, Higgs\nphysics, physics beyond the Standard Model, flavour physics, and practical\nstatistics for particle physicists.\n", "  We report our results on the adsorption of noble gases such as argon, krypton\nand xenon on a graphene sheet, using Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC)\nsimulations. We calculated the two-dimensional gas-liquid critical temperature\nfor each adsorbate, resulting in fair agreement with theoretical predictions\nand experimental values of gases on graphite. We determined the different\nphases of the monolayers and constructed the phase diagrams. We found\ntwo-dimensional incommensurate solid phases for krypton, argon and xenon, and a\ntwo-dimensional commensurate solid phase for krypton.\n", "  Cities are changing constantly. All urban systems face different conditions\nfrom day to day. Even when averaged regularities can be found, urban systems\nwill be more efficient if they can adapt to changes at the same speeds at which\nthese occur. Technology can assist humans in achieving this adaptation.\nInspired by cybernetics, we propose a description of cities as adaptive\nsystems. We identify three main components: information, algorithms, and\nagents, which we illustrate with current and future examples. The implications\nof adaptive cities are manifold, with direct impacts on mobility,\nsustainability, resilience, governance, and society. Still, the potential of\nadaptive cities will not depend so much on technology as on how we use it.\n", "  In flat spacetime, quantum fluctuations in dark matter, as described as a\nBose-Einstein condensate, are stable and display a relativistic Bogoliubov\ndispersion relation. In the weak gravitational field limit, both relativistic\nand nonrelativistic models self-gravitating dark matter suggest the formation\nof structures as the result of a dynamical (Jeans) instability. Here, we show\nthat in the presence of spontaneous symmetry breaking of the dark matter field,\nthe gravitational wave is damped for wave-lengths larger than the Jeans length.\nSuch energy is converted to the Bogoliubov modes of the BEC that in their turn\nbecome unstable and grow, leading to the formation of structures even in the\nabsence of expansion. Remarkably, this compensated attenuation/amplification\nmechanism is the signature of a discrete PT-symmetry-breaking of the system.\n", "  Optical fibre is drawn from a dual-head 3D printer fabricated preform made of\ntwo optically transparent plastics with a high index core (NA ~ 0.25, V > 60).\nThe asymmetry observed in the fibre arises from asymmetry in the 3D printing\nprocess. The highly multi-mode optical fibre has losses measured by cut-back as\nlow as {\\alpha} ~ 0.44 dB/cm in the near IR.\n", "  A structured optical fibre is drawn from a 3D-printed structured preform.\nPreforms containing a single ring of holes around the core are fabricated using\nfilament made from a modified butadiene polymer. More broadly, 3D printers\ncapable of processing soft glasses, silica and other materials are likely to\ncome on line in the not-so distant future. 3D printing of optical preforms\nsignals a new milestone in optical fibre manufacture.\n", "  A completely new strategy to calculate parton distribution functions on the\nlattice has recently been proposed. In this method, lattice calculable\nobservables, called quasi distributions, are related to normal distributions.\nThe quasi distributions are known to contain power-law UV divergences arise\nfrom a Wilson line in the non-local operator, while the normal distributions\nonly have logatithmic UV divergences. We propose possible method to subtract\nthe power divegence to make the matching of the quasi with the normal\ndistributions well-defined. We also demonstrate the matching of the quasi quark\ndistribution between continuum and lattice implementing the power divergence\nsubtraction. The matching calculations are carried out by one-loop\nperturbation.\n", "  The Mu2e Experiment at Fermilab will search for the coherent, neutrinoless\nconversion of muons into electrons in the field of an aluminium nucleus with an\nunprecedented sensitivity. Such a charged lepton flavor-violating reaction\nprobes new physics at a scale inaccessible with direct searches at either\npresent or planned high energy colliders. Moreover, the Mu2e experiment both\ncomplements and extends the current search for the {\\mu} $\\to$ e{\\gamma} decay\nat MEG and searches for new physics at the LHC. We will present the physics\nmotivation for Mu2e, the experimental setup and the current status of the\nexperiment.\n", "  In a recent paper [1304.6846], Racorean introduced a formal similarity of the\nBlack-Sholes stock pricing model with a Schr\\\"odinger equation. We use a\npreviously introduced method of a resonant transmission line for arbitrary 2nd\norder Sturm-Liouville problems to attack the same problem from a different\nperspective revealing some deep structures in the naturally associated\neigenvalue problem.\n", "  In this article, we argue that two distinct types of time should be taken\ninto account in relativistic physics: a geometric time, which emanates from the\nstructure of spacetime and its metrics, and a causal time, indicating the flow\nfrom the past to the future. A particularity of causal times is that its values\nhave no intrinsic meaning, as their evolution alone is meaningful. In the\ncontext of relativistic Lagrangian mechanics, causal times corresponds to\nadmissible parameterizations of paths, and we show that in order for a\nlangragian to not depend on any particular causal time (as its values have no\nintrinsic meaning), it has to be homogeneous in its velocity argument. We\nillustrate this property with the example of a free particle in a potential.\nThen, using a geometric Lagrangian (i.e. a parameterization independent\nLagrangian which is also manifestly covariant), we introduce the notion of\nageodesicity of a path which measures to what extent a path is far from being a\ngeodesic, and show how the notion can be used in the twin paradox to\ndifferentiate the paths followed by the two twins.\n", "  Mid-infrared (mid-IR) photo-detection has been recently growing in importance\nbecause of its multiple applications, including vibrational spectroscopy and\nthermal imaging. We propose and demonstrate a novel pyro-resistive\nphoto-detection platform that combines a ferroelectric substrate (a z-cut\nLiNbO3 crystal) and a graphene layer transferred on top of its surface with\nelectrical connections. Upon strong light absorption in the LiNbO3 substrate\nand the subsequent temperature increase, via the pyroelectric effect,\npolarization (bound) charges form at the crystal surface. These causes doping\ninto graphene which in turn changes its carrier density and conductivity. In\nthis way, by monitoring the graphene electrical resistance one can measure the\nincident optical power. . Detectivities of about 10^5 cm sqrt(Hz)/W in the 6 to\n10 microns wavelength region are demonstrated.We explain the underlying\nphysical mechanism of the pyro-resistive photo-detection and propose a model\nthat reproduces accurately the experimental results. We also show that up to\ntwo orders of magnitude larger detectivity can be achieved by optimising the\ngeometry and operating in vacuum, thus opening the path to a new class of\nmid-IR photo-detectors that can challenge classical HgCdTe devices, especially\nin real applications where cooling is to be avoided and low cost is crucial.\n", "  We have studied magnetodielectric and spin-lattice coupling in\nCoNb$_{2}$O$_{6}$ single crystals. Magnetostriction and magnetodielectric\nexperiments are performed at temperatures in and above antifferomagnetic phase\nof quasi 1D Ising spin chain CoNb$_{2}$O$_{6}$. Field induced magnetic\ntransitions are clearly reflected in magnetodielectric measurement as well as\nmagnetostriction measurement also. Two sharp anomalies are found around the\ncritical fields of antiferromagnetic to ferrimagnetic transition and\nferrimagnetic to saturated paramagnetic transition in both magnetodielectric\nand magnetostriction experiments. High field anomaly is more pronounced for\nmagnetodielectric response and magnetostriction also. So, in CoNb$_{2}$O$_{6}$,\nspins are strongly coupled with lattice as well as charges also.\n", "  The proposed Mitchell Institute Neutrino Experiment at Reactor (MINER)\nexperiment at the Nuclear Science Center at Texas A&M University will search\nfor coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering within close proximity (about\n2 meters) of a 1 MW TRIGA nuclear reactor core using low threshold, cryogenic\ngermanium and silicon detectors. Given the Standard Model cross section of the\nscattering process and the proposed experimental proximity to the reactor, as\nmany as 5 to 20 events/kg/day are expected. We discuss the status of\npreliminary measurements to characterize the main backgrounds for the proposed\nexperiment. Both in situ measurements at the experimental site and simulations\nusing the MCNP and GEANT4 codes are described. A strategy for monitoring\nbackgrounds during data taking is briefly discussed.\n", "  This article presents the status of the art of the T2K experiment and the\nmeasurements prospects for the incoming years. After a brief description of the\nexperiment, the most recent results will be illustrated. The observation of the\nelectron neutrino appearance in a muon neutrino beam and the new high-precision\nmeasurements of the mixing angle theta13 by the reactor experiments have led to\na re-evaluation of the expected sensitivity to the oscillation parameters,\nrelative to what was given in the original T2K proposal. For this reason the\nnew physics potential of T2K for 7.8 x 10**21 p.o.t. and for a data exposure 3\ntimes larger than it's expected to be reachable with accelerator and beam line\nupgrades in 2026 before the start of operation of the next generation of\nlong-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments will also be described in the\ntext. In particular the last challenging scenario opens the door to the\npossibility to obtain, under some conditions, a 3 sigma measurement excluding\nsin(deltaCP= 0.\n", "  Language change is a complex social phenomenon, revealing pathways of\ncommunication and sociocultural influence. But, while language change has long\nbeen a topic of study in sociolinguistics, traditional linguistic research\nmethods rely on circumstantial evidence, estimating the direction of change\nfrom differences between older and younger speakers. In this paper, we use a\ndata set of several million Twitter users to track language changes in\nprogress. First, we show that language change can be viewed as a form of social\ninfluence: we observe complex contagion for phonetic spellings and \"netspeak\"\nabbreviations (e.g., lol), but not for older dialect markers from spoken\nlanguage. Next, we test whether specific types of social network connections\nare more influential than others, using a parametric Hawkes process model. We\nfind that tie strength plays an important role: densely embedded social ties\nare significantly better conduits of linguistic influence. Geographic locality\nappears to play a more limited role: we find relatively little evidence to\nsupport the hypothesis that individuals are more influenced by geographically\nlocal social ties, even in their usage of geographical dialect markers.\n", "  We report the thickness dependence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI)\nand spin-orbit torques (SOTs) in Pt\\Co(t)\\AlOx, studied by current-induced\ndomain wall (DW) motion and second-harmonic experiments. From the DW motion\nstudy, a monotonous decay of the effective DMI strength with an increasing Co\nthickness is observed, in agreement with a DMI originating at the Pt\\Co\ninterface. The study of the ferromagnetic thickness dependence of spin-orbit\ntorques reveals a more complex behavior. The effective SOT-field driving the DW\nmotion is found to initially increase and then saturate with an increasing\nferromagnetic thickness, while the effective SOT-fields acting on a saturated\nmagnetic state exhibit a non-monotonic behavior with increasing Co-thickness.\nThe observed thickness dependence suggests the spin-Hall effect in Pt as the\nmain origin of the SOTs, with the measured SOT amplitudes resulting from the\ninterplay between the varying thickness and the transverse spin diffusion\nlength of the Co layer.\n", "  The granular Leidenfrost effect (B. Meerson et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 91},\n024301 (2003), P. Eshuis et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 95}, 258001 (2005)) is\nthe levitation of a mass of granular matter when a wall below the grains is\nvibrated giving rise to a hot granular gas below the cluster. We find by\nsimulation that for a range of parameters the system is bistable: the levitated\ncluster can occasionally break and give rise to two clusters and a hot granular\ngas above and below. We use techniques from the theory of rare events to\ncompute the mean transition time for breaking to occur. This requires the\nintroduction of a two-component reaction coordinate.\n", "  The antineutrinos of the neutron rich 8Li isotope is characterized by hard\nand good defined spectrum - averaged energy is 6.5 MeV and maximal - up to 13\nMeV. An intensive antineutrino source with such parameters can be unique\ninstrument for neutrino investigations and especially for search of sterile\nneutrinos. The 8Li can be produced by (n,gamma)-activation of 7Li isotope. The\nproposed scheme of the antineutrino source is based on the lithium blanket\naround the accelerator neutron producting target. We propose to use heavy water\nsolution of the lithium hydroxide instead of lithium in metallic state. Such\nsolution for lithium blanket substance ensure the large perspectives in real\nsteps for creation of this installation. An analyses of neutron fields in the\nblanket and distribution of 8Li creation allows to propose the next principal\nsteps in the construction of the lithium blanket. We propose to enclose the\nblanket volume isolating it's central part with more high 8Li production. This\nsolution allows to decrease the necessary mass of very pure 7Li isotope (with\nadmixture of 6Li - 0.0001) up to 120-130 kg (i.e., to decrease in ~ 150 times\ncompare to variant of lithium blanket in metallic state). The source become\nmore compact - the linear dimension is decreased in 2.5 times (up to 1.3 m) and\nthis is very essential for sterile neutrino search taking in mind the\nindication on difference ~1 eV2 between squared mass of sterile and active\nneutrinos.\n", "  We investigate the energy relaxation process produced by thermal baths at\nzero temperature acting on the boundary atoms of chains of classical anharmonic\noscillators. Time-dependent perturbation theory allows us to obtain an explicit\nsolution of the harmonic problem: even in such a simple system nontrivial\nfeatures emerge from the interplay of the different decay rates of Fourier\nmodes. In particular, a crossover from an exponential to an inverse-square-root\nlaw occurs on a time scale proportional to the system size $N$. A further\ncrossover back to an exponential law is observed only at much longer times (of\nthe order $N^3$). In the nonlinear chain, the relaxation process is initially\nequivalent to the harmonic case over a wide time span, as illustrated by\nsimulations of the $\\beta$ Fermi-Pasta-Ulam model. The distinctive feature is\nthat the second crossover is not observed due to the spontaneous appearance of\nbreathers, i.e. space-localized time-periodic solutions, that keep a finite\nresidual energy in the lattice. We discuss the mechanism yielding such\nsolutions and also explain why it crucially depends on the boundary conditions.\n", "  In recent years, political economists, financial economists, and other social\nscientists have introduced spin and lattice models into their theoretical tool\nkit. To this end, the modeling skills of hard scientists may be of assistance.\nThis lecture introduces examples of how these models are used. A simple\ndynamical model of how legal rules evolve and propagate in the courts is\ndescribed.\n", "  We study the B\\\"acklund symmetry for the Moyal Korteweg-de Vries (KdV)\nhierarchy based on the Kuperschmidt-Wilson Theorem associated with second\n  Gelfand-Dickey structure with respect to the Moyal bracket, which generalizes\nthe result of Adler for the ordinary KdV.\n", "  We show that for a class of dynamical systems, Hamiltonian with respect to\nthree distinct Poisson brackets (P_0, P_1, P_2), separation coordinates are\nprovided by the common roots of a set of bivariate polynomials. These\npolynomials, which generalise those considered by E. Sklyanin in his\nalgebro-geometric approach, are obtained from the knowledge of: (i) a common\nCasimir function for the two Poisson pencils (P_1 - \\lambda P_0) and (P_2 - \\mu\nP_0); (ii) a suitable set of vector fields, preserving P_0 but transversal to\nits symplectic leaves. The frameworks is applied to Lax equations with spectral\nparameter, for which not only it unifies the separation techniques of Sklyanin\nand of Magri, but also provides a more efficient ``inverse'' procedure not\ninvolving the extraction of roots.\n", "  We study the synchronization between left and right hemisphere rat EEG\nchannels by using various synchronization measures, namely non-linear\ninterdependences, phase-synchronizations, mutual information, cross-correlation\nand the coherence function. In passing we show a close relation between two\nrecently proposed phase synchronization measures and we extend the definition\nof one of them. In three typical examples we observe that except mutual\ninformation, all these measures give a useful quantification that is hard to be\nguessed beforehand from the raw data. Despite their differences, results are\nqualitatively the same. Therefore, we claim that the applied measures are\nvaluable for the study of synchronization in real data. Moreover, in the\nparticular case of EEG signals their use as complementary variables could be of\nclinical relevance.\n", "  We apply our recent formalism establishing new connections between the\ngeometry of moving space curves and soliton equations, to the nonlinear\n  Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation (NLS).\n  We show that any given solution of the NLS gets associated with three\ndistinct space curve evolutions. The tangent vector of the first of these\ncurves, the binormal vector of the second and the normal vector of the third,\nare shown to satisfy the integrable Landau-Lifshitz (LL) equation\n  ${\\bf S}_u = {\\bf S} \\times {\\bf S}_{ss}$, (${\\bf S}^2=1$). These connections\nenable us to find the three surfaces swept out by the moving curves associated\nwith the NLS. As an example, surfaces corresponding to a stationary envelope\nsoliton solution of the NLS are obtained.\n", "  The form factor $K(\\tau)$ is calculated analytically to the order $\\tau^3$ as\nwell as numerically for a rectangular billiard perturbed by a $\\delta$-like\nscatterer with an angle independent diffraction constant, $D$. The cases where\nthe scatterer is at the center and at a typical position in the billiard are\nstudied. The analytical calculations are performed in the semiclassical\napproximation combined with the geometrical theory of diffraction. Non diagonal\ncontributions are crucial and are therefore taken into account.\n  The numerical calculations are performed for a self adjoint extension of a\n$\\delta$ function potential.\n  We calculate the angle dependent diffraction constant for an arbitrary\nperturbing potential $U({\\bf r})$, that is large in a finite but small region\n(compared to the wavelength of the particles that in turn is small compared to\nthe size of the billiard). The relation to the idealized model of the\n$\\delta$-like scatterer is formulated. The angle dependent diffraction constant\nis used for the analytic calculation of the form factor to the order $\\tau^2$.\nIf the scatterer is at a typical position, the form factor is found to reduce\n(in this order) to the one found for angle independent diffraction. If the\nscatterer is at the center, the large degeneracy in the lengths of the orbits\ninvolved leads to an additional small contribution to the form factor,\nresulting of the angle dependence of the diffraction constant. The robustness\nof the results is discussed.\n", "  The main signature of chaos in a quantum system is provided by spectral\nstatistical analysis of the nearest neighbor spacing distribution and the\nspectral rigidity given by $\\Delta_3(L)$. It is shown that some standard\nunfolding procedures, like local unfolding and Gaussian broadening, lead to a\nspurious increase of the spectral rigidity that spoils the $\\Delta_3(L)$\nrelationship with the regular or chaotic motion of the system. This effect can\nalso be misinterpreted as Berry's saturation.\n", "  We present a method to construct a symplecticity preserving renormalization\ngroup map of a chain of weakly nonlinear symplectic maps and obtain a general\nreduced symplectic map describing its long-time behaviour. It is found that the\nmodulational instability in the reduced map triggers random wandering of orbits\naround some homoclinic-like manifolds, which is understood as the Bernoulli\nshifts.\n", "  We show how the Lie group analysis method can be used in order to obtain\nfirst integrals of any system of ordinary differential equations.\n  The method of reduction/increase of order developed by Nucci (J. Math. Phys.\n37, 1772-1775 (1996)) is essential. Noether's theorem is neither necessary nor\nconsidered. The most striking example we present is the relationship between\nLie group analysis and the famous first integral of the Kowalevski top.\n", "  This paper shows that the Camassa-Holm (CH) spectral problem yields two\ndifferent integrable hierarchies of nonlinear evolution equations (NLEEs), one\nis of negative order CH hierachy while the other one is of positive order CH\nhierarchy. The two CH hierarchies possess the zero curvature representations\nthrough solving a key matrix equation. We find that the well-known CH equation\nis included in the negative order CH hierarchy while a Dym type equation is\nincluded in the positive order CH hierarchy. Furthermore, under two constraint\nconditions between the eigenfunctions and the potentials, the CH spectral\nproblem is cast in: (enumerate) a new Neumann-like N-dimensional system when it\nis restricted into a symplectic submanifold of $\\R^{2N}$ which is proven to be\nintegrable by using the Dirac-Poisson bracket and the r-matrix process; and a\nnew Bargmann-like N-dimensional system when it is considered in the whole\n$\\R^{2N}$ which is proven to be integrable by using the standard Poisson\nbracket and the r-matrix process. (enumerate) In the paper, we present two\n$4\\times4$ instead of $N\\times N$ r-matrix structures. One is for the\nNeumann-like CH system (not the peaked CH system), while the other one is for\nthe Bargmann-like CH system. The whole CH hierarchy (both positive and negative\norder) is shown to have the parametric solution which obey the constraint\nrelation. In particular, the CH equation constrained to some symplectic\nsubmanifold, and the Dym type equation have the parametric solutions. Moreover,\nwe see that the kind of parametric solution of the CH equation is not gauge\nequivalent to the peakons. Solving the parametric representation of solution on\nthe symplectic submanifold gives a class of new algebro-geometric solution of\nthe CH equation.\n", "  We construct explicit multivortex solutions for the complex sine-Gordon\nequation (the Lund-Regge model) in two Euclidean dimensions. Unlike the\npreviously found (coaxial) multivortices, the new solutions comprise $n$ single\nvortices placed at arbitrary positions (but confined within a finite part of\nthe plane.) All multivortices, including the single vortex, have an infinite\nnumber of parameters. We also show that, in contrast to the coaxial complex\nsine-Gordon multivortices, the axially-symmetric solutions of the\nGinzburg-Landau model (the stationary Gross-Pitaevskii equation) {\\it do not}\nbelong to a broader family of noncoaxial multivortex configurations.\n", "  The sine-Gordon equation has hyperelliptic al function solutions over a\nhyperelliptic Jacobian for $y^2 = f(x)$ of arbitrary genus $g$. This article\ngives an extension of the sine-Gordon equation to that over subvarieties of the\nhyperelliptic Jacobian.\n  We also obtain the condition that the sine-Gordon equation in a proper\nsubvariety of the Jacobian is defined.\n", "  The notion of a Laplace ladder for a discrete analogue of the\n  Laplace equation is presented. The adjoint of the discrete Moutard equation\nand a discrete counterpart of the nonlinear form of Goursat equation are\nintroduced.\n", "  The work relates to a new way for analysis of one-dimensional stochastic\nsystems, based on consideration of its higher order difference structure. From\nthis point of view, the deterministic and random processes are analyzed. A new\nnumerical characteristic for one-dimensional stochastic systems is introduced.\nThe applications to single neuron models and neural networks are given.\n", "  Lax pairs with operator valued coefficients, which are explicitly connected\nby means of an additional condition, are considered. This condition is proved\nto be covariant with respect to the Darboux transformation of a general form.\nNonlinear equations arising from the compatibility condition of the Lax pairs\nin the matrix case include, in particular, Nahm equations, Volterra,\nBogoyavlenskii and Toda lattices. The examples of another one-, two- and\nmulti-field lattice equations are also presented.\n", "  Following the results and the general methodological framework of a\npreceeding paper (Models and Metaphors, part I, henceforth: MM), we develop\nsome results on the epistemological state of natural laws and ask for explicit\npossibilities of mediating the contexts of nature (in terms of the sciences)\nand aesthetics.\n", "  An attempt is given to formulate the extensions of the KP hierarchy by\nintroducing fractional order pseudo-differential operators. In the case of the\nextension with the half-order pseudo-differential operators, a system analogous\nto the supersymmetric extensions of the KP hierarchy is obtained. Unlike the\nsupersymmetric extensions, no Grassmannian variable appears in the hierarchy\nconsidered here. More general hierarchies constructed by the 1/N-th order\npseudo-differential operators, their integrability and the reduction procedure\nare also investigated. In addition to finding out the new extensions of the KP\nhierarchy, brief introduction to the Riemann-Liouville integral is provided to\nyield a candidate for the fractional order pseudo-differential operators.\n", "  We study the crossover of the quantum Loschmidt echo (or fidelity) from the\ngolden rule regime to the perturbation-independent exponential decay regime by\nusing the kicked top model. It is shown that the deviation of the\nperturbation-independent decay of the averaged fidelity from the Lyapunov decay\nresults from quantum fluctuations in individual fidelity, which are caused by\nthe coherence in the initial coherent states.\n  With an averaging procedure suppressing the quantum fluctuations effectively,\nthe perturbation-independent decay is found to be close to the Lyapunov decay.\n  We also show that the Fourier transform of the fidelity is determined\ndirectly by the initial state and the eigenstates of the Floquet operators of\nthe two classically chaotic systems concerned.\n  The absolute value part and the phase part of the Fourier transform of the\nfidelity are found to be divided into several correlated parts, which is a\nmanifestation of the coherence of the initial coherent state.\n  In the whole crossover region, some important properties of the fidelity,\nsuch as the exponent of its exponential decay and the short initial time within\nwhich the fidelity almost does not change, are found to be closely related to\nproperties of the central part of its Fourier transform.\n", "  We investigate the combined effect of rectification and nonlinear dynamics on\nthe behavior of several simple nonlinear circuits. We consider the classic\nResistor-Inductor-Diode (RLD) circuit driven by a low frequency source when an\noperational amplifier with negative feedback is added to the circuit. Radio\nfrequency signals are applied to the circuit, causing significant changes in\nthe onset of period-doubling and chaos. Measurements indicate that this effect\nis associated with a DC voltage induced by rectification of the RF signal in\nthe circuit. The combination of rectification and nonlinear circuit dynamics\nproduce qualitatively new behavior, which opens up a new channel of RF\ninterference in circuits.\n", "  We analyze a nonlinear discrete-time Cournot duopoly game, where players have\nheterogeneous expectations. Two types of players are considered: boundedly\nrational and naive expectations. In this study we show that the dynamics of the\nduopoly game with players whose beliefs are heterogeneous, may become\ncomplicated. The model gives more complex chaotic and unpredictable\ntrajectories as a consequence of increasing the speed of adjustment of\nboundedly rational player. The equilibrium points and local stability of the\nduopoly game are investigated. As some parameters of the model are varied, the\nstability of the Nash equilibrium point is lost and the complex (periodic or\nchaotic) behavior occurs. Numerical simulations is presented to show that\nplayers with heterogeneous beliefs make the duopoly game behaves chaotically.\nAlso we get the fractal dimension of the chaotic attractor of our map which is\nequivalent to the dimension of Henon map.\n", "  For Lax-pair isospectral deformations whose associated spectrum, for given\ninitial data, consists of the disjoint union of a finitely denumerable discrete\nspectrum (solitons) and a continuous spectrum (continuum), the matrix\nRiemann-Hilbert problem approach is used to derive the leading-order\nasymptotics as $| t | \\to \\infty$ $(x/t \\sim \\mathcal{O} (1))$ of solutions $(u\n= u(x,t))$ to the Cauchy problem for the defocusing non-linear Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequation (D${}_{f}$NLSE), $\\mi \\partial_{t}u + \\partial_{x}^{2}u - 2(| u |^{2}\n- 1) u = 0$, with finite-density initial data $u(x,0) =_{x \\to \\pm \\infty} \\exp\n(\\tfrac{\\mi (1 \\mp 1) \\theta}{2})(1 + o(1))$, $\\theta \\in [0,2\\pi)$. The\nD${}_{f}$NLSE dark soliton position shifts in the presence of the continuum are\nalso obtained.\n", "  We show that unlike the bright solitons, the parametrically driven kinks are\nimmune from instabilities for all dampings and forcing amplitudes; they can\nalso form stable bound states. In the undamped case, the two types of stable\nkinks and their complexes can travel with nonzero velocities.\n", "  The ability of the Smaller Alignment Index (SALI) to distinguish chaotic from\nordered motion, has been demonstrated recently in several\npublications.\\cite{Sk01,GRACM} Basically it is observed that in chaotic regions\nthe SALI goes to zero very rapidly, while it fluctuates around a nonzero value\nin ordered regions. In this paper, we make a first step forward explaining\nthese results by studying in detail the evolution of small deviations from\nregular orbits lying on the invariant tori of an {\\bf integrable} 2D\nHamiltonian system. We show that, in general, any two initial deviation vectors\nwill eventually fall on the ``tangent space'' of the torus, pointing in\ndifferent directions due to the different dynamics of the 2 integrals of\nmotion, which means that the SALI (or the smaller angle between these vectors)\nwill oscillate away from zero for all time.\n", "  The effect of direct processes on the statistical properties of deterministic\nscattering processes in a chaotic waveguide is examined. The single channel\nPoisson kernel describes well the distribution of S-matrix eigenphases when\nevaluated over an energy interval. When direct processes are transformed away,\nthe scattering processes exhibit universal random matrix behavior. The effect\nof chaos on scattering wavefunctions,eigenphases, and time delays is discussed.\n", "  The two-dimensional cubic nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLS) can be used as\na model of phenomena in physical systems ranging from waves on deep water to\npulses in optical fibers. In this paper, we establish that every\none-dimensional traveling wave solution of NLS with trivial phase is unstable\nwith respect to some infinitesimal perturbation with two-dimensional structure.\nIf the coefficients of the linear dispersion terms have the same sign then the\nonly unstable perturbations have transverse wavelength longer than a\nwell-defined cut-off. If the coefficients of the linear dispersion terms have\nopposite signs, then there is no such cut-off and as the wavelength decreases,\nthe maximum growth rate approaches a well-defined limit.\n", "  We consider a model for population dynamics such as for the evolution of\nbacterial colonies which is of the Fisher type but where the competitive\ninteraction among individuals is non-local, and show that spatial structures\nwith interesting features emerge. These features depend on the nature of the\ncompetitive interaction as well as on its range, specifically on the presence\nor absence of tails in, and the central curvature of, the influence function of\nthe interaction.\n", "  One of the main benchmarks in direct numerical simulations of\nthree-dimensional turbulence is the Kolmogorov 1941 prediction for third-order\nstructure functions with homogeneous and isotropic statistics in the\ninfinite-Reynolds number limit. Previous DNS techniques to obtain isotropic\nstatistics have relied on time-averaging structure functions in a few\ndirections over many eddy turnover times, using forcing schemes carefully\nconstructed to generate isotropic data. Motivated by recent theoretical work\nwhich removes isotropy requirements by spherically averaging structure\nfunctions over all directions, we will present results which supplement\nlong-time averaging by angle-averaging over up to 73 directions from a single\nflow snapshot. The directions are among those natural to a square computational\ngrid, and are weighted to approximate the spherical average. The averaging\nprocess is cheap, and for the\n  Kolmogorov 1941 4/5ths law, reasonable results can be obtained from a single\nsnapshot of data. This procedure may be used to investigate the isotropic\nstatistics of any quantity of interest.\n", "  In this paper, the familiar problems of free-fall motion and simple harmonic\nmotion (SHM) are combined. The novel composite system passes from regular to\nchaotic behavior for increasing values of energy $E$. This system is a suitable\nexample to introduce undergraduates to some of the concepts of dynamical chaos\ntheory.\n", "  A simplified differential reactor model that embodies the essential physics\ncontrolling PEM fuel cell (PEM-FC) dynamics is presented. A remarkable analogy\nexists between water management in the differential PEM-FC and energy balance\nin the classical exothermic stirred tank reactor. Water, the reaction product\nin the PEM-FC autocatalytically accelerates the reaction rate by enhancing\nproton transport through the PEM. Established analyses of heat autocatalyticity\nin a CSTR are modified to present water management autocatalyticity in a\nstirred tank reactor PEM-FC.\n", "  The equation of the density field of an assembly of macroscopic particles\nadvected by a hydrodynamic flow is derived from the microscopic description of\nthe system. This equation allows to recognize the role and the relative\nimportance of the different microscopic processes implicit in the model: the\ndriving of the external flow, the inertia of the particles, and the collisions\namong them.\n  The validity of the density description is confirmed by comparisons of\nnumerical studies of the continuum equation with Direct Simulation Monte Carlo\n(DSMC) simulations of hard disks advected by a chaotic flow. We show that the\ncollisions have two competing roles: a dispersing-like effect and a clustering\neffect (even for elastic collisions). An unexpected feature is also observed in\nthe system: the presence of collisions can reverse the effect of inertia, so\nthat grains with lower inertia are more clusterized.\n", "  We consider a dynamical system given by an area-preserving map on a\ntwo-dimensional phase plane and consider a one-dimensional line of initial\nconditions within this plane. We record the number of iterates it takes a\ntrajectory to escape from a bounded region of the plane as a function along the\nline of initial conditions, forming an ``escape-time plot''. For a chaotic\nsystem, this plot is in general not a smooth function, but rather has many\nsingularities at which the escape time is infinite; these singularities form a\ncomplicated fractal set. In this article we prove the existence of regular\nrepeated sequences, called ``epistrophes'', which occur at all levels of\nresolution within the escape-time plot. (The word ``epistrophe'' comes from\nrhetoric and means ``a repeated ending following a variable beginning''.) The\nepistrophes give the escape-time plot a certain self-similarity, called\n``epistrophic'' self-similarity, which need not imply either strict or\nasymptotic self-similarity.\n", "  In this article, we study the evolution of the strategies in a sort of\nweighted three cornered game, Glico Game. This game has three strategies in\neach agent and three parameters in the payoff matrix.\n  We divide the parameter region into 8 areas and explore its qualitative and\nquantitative properties of the evolution of strategies which include Haming\ndistance, correlation functions and the population sequence of each strategy.\nWhen the three payoff parameters take nearly values each other, the complex\npatterns mainly appear and as the difference of parameter values are enlarged,\nsome peculiar strategy trends to be dominant gradually. An interesting fact is\nthat the strongest strategy in the payoff do not necessarily dominate the\nlatice world. There are even the cases where the weakest strategy in the payof\ndominate. Generally many cases have some period much shoter than the dimension\nof the configuration space.\n", "  We consider a large $N$ limit of the Hitchin type integrable systems.\n  The first system is the elliptic rotator on $GL_N$ that corresponds to the\nHiggs bundle of degree one over an elliptic curve with a marked point. This\nsystem is gauge equivalent to the $N$-body elliptic Calogero-Moser system, that\nis derived from the Higgs bundle of degree zero over the same curve. The large\n$N$ limit of the former system is the integrable rotator on the group of the\nnon-commutative torus. Its classical limit leads to the integrable modification\nof 2d hydrodynamics on the two-dimensional torus. We also consider the elliptic\nCalogero-Moser system on the group of the non-commutative torus and consider\nthe systems that arise after the reduction to the loop group.\n", "  We study a free interface problem related to combustion of condensed matter\nand some non-equilibrium exothermal phase transitions. In spite of a variety of\nnon-trivial dynamical scenarios exhibited by the model the solutions are\nuniformly bounded and the interface velocity is a smooth function. The main\nresult of the paper establishes existence of a compact connected attractor for\nthe classical solutions of the problem. Numerical evidence leads to the\nconjecture that the fractal dimension of the attractor is finite.\n", "  We present various exact solutions of a discrete complex Ginzburg-Landau\n(CGL) equation on a plane lattice, which describe target patterns and spiral\npatterns and derive their stability criteria. We also obtain similar solutions\nto a system of van der Pol's oscillators.\n", "  We investigate the phenomenon of drag reduction in a viscoelastic fluid model\nof dilute polymer solutions. By means of direct numerical simulations of the\nthree-dimensional turbulent Kolmogorov flow we show that drag reduction takes\nplace above a critical Reynolds number $Re_c$. An explicit expression for the\ndependence of $Re_c$ on polymer elasticity and diffusivity is derived. The\nvalues of the drag coefficient obtained for different fluid parameters collapse\nonto a universal curve when plotted as a function of the rescaled Reynolds\nnumber $Re/Re_c$. The analysis of the momentum budget allows to gain some\ninsight on the physics of drag reduction, and suggests the existence of a\nmaximum drag reduction asymptote.\n", "  We represent the Fourier form of the dressing method, which is effective for\nconstruction of multidimensional integral-differential equations together with\ntheir solutions.\n  Example of integrable (but non-physical) expansion of Intermediate Long Wave\nequation in (2+1)-dimensions is considered.\n", "  The interaction of nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger (NLS) solitons with potential\nwells with variable shapes is investigated numerically. For fixed initial\nvelocities below the threshold for transmission, the outcome pattern as a\nfunction of the width of the potential yields periodically repeating regions of\ntrapping, transmission and reflection. The observed effects are explained by an\nexcitation and a following resonant deexcitation of amplitude (shape)\noscillations of the solitons at the boundaries of the well, associated with\nradiation modes.\n", "  We present an evaporation experiment in a single fluid layer. When latent\nheat associated to the evaporation is large enough, the heat flow through the\nfree surface of the layer generates temperature gradients that can destabilize\nthe conductive motionless state giving rise to convective cellular structures\nwithout any external heating. The sequence of convective patterns obtained here\nwithout heating, is similar to that obtained in B\\'enard-Marangoni convection.\nThis work present the sequence of spatial bifurcations as a function of the\nlayer depth. The transition between square to hexagonal pattern, known from\nnon-evaporative experiments, is obtained here with a similar change in\nwavelength.\n", "  A system of ODE's is used to approximate the dynamics of two delayed coupled\n  FitzHugh-Nagumo excitable units, and study the relevant bifurcations. It is\nshown that the Bautin bifurcation acts as the organizing center for the\ndynamics of ODE's for small time-lags.\n", "  In this paper fractional generalization of Liouville equation is considered.\nWe derive fractional analog of normalization condition for distribution\nfunction. Fractional generalization of the Liouvile equation for dissipative\nand Hamiltonian systems was derived from the fractional normalization\ncondition. This condition is considered considered as a normalization condition\nfor systems in fractional phase space. The interpretation of the fractional\nspace is discussed.\n", "  The LMC complexity, an indicator of complexity based on a probabilistic\ndescription, is revisited. A straightforward approach allows us to establish\nthe time evolution of this indicator in a near-equilibrium situation and gives\nus a new insight for interpreting the LMC complexity for a general non\nequilibrium system. Its relationship with the Renyi entropies is also\nexplained. One of the advantages of this indicator is that its calculation does\nnot require a considerable computational effort in many cases of physical and\nbiological interest.\n", "  A new family of nonlinear partial differential equations is presented. They\nrepresent a generalization of the hyperbolic Ernst equations for an\nEinstein-Mawxell-Weyl field in general relativity. A B\\\"acklund transformation\nfor the system of equations under consideration is given, and their direct\nrelation to the complete Boussinesq hierarchy of soliton equations is\nillustrated.\n", "  Drag reduction by polymers in turbulent wall-bounded flows exhibits universal\nand non-universal aspects. The universal maximal mean velocity profile was\nexplained in a recent theory. The saturation of this profile and the crossover\nback to the Newtonian plug are non-universal, depending on Reynolds number Re,\nconcentration of polymer $c_p$ and the degree of polymerization $N_p$. We\nexplain the mechanism of saturation stemming from the finiteness of\nextensibility of the polymers, predict its dependence on $c_p$ and $N$ in the\nlimit of small $c_p$ and large Re, and present the excellent comparison of our\npredictions to experiments on drag reduction by DNA.\n", "  Monthly averages of the sunspot number visible on the sun, observed from\n  1749, Zurich Observatory, and from 1848 other observatories, have been\nanalyzed. This time signal presents a frequency power spectra with a clear\n$1/f^\\alpha$ behavior with $\\alpha\\simeq 0.8 \\pm 0.2$. The well known cycle of\napproximately 11 years, clearly present in the spectrum, does not produce a\nsensible distortion of that behavior. The eventual characterization of the\nsunspot time series as a fractal is analyzed by means of the detrended\nfluctuation analysis. The jump size distribution of the signal is also studied.\n", "  A simulation of new product market penetration in a social environment is\nperformed, using a spintronic model, where each element of a 3D network\ninteracts with its first neighbors. Agents are assumed to be rational, with a\nperfect market foresight.\n  Unitary production cost decreases when consumption is increased. Simulations\nindicate that social interaction is the most important factor for new product\nmarket penetration as compared to the consumer readiness to pay a higher price.\nBesides the critical exponent of the nucleation of new consumers is computed,\nsigning a phase transition characterized by the build up of new consumers\nintermediate clusters and this critical exponent is compared to others\nbelonging to several critical phenomena.\n", "  Classical billiards constitute an important class of dynamical systems. They\nhave not only been in used in mathematical disciplines such as ergodic theory,\nbut their properties demonstrate fundamental physical phenomena that can be\nobserved in laboratory settings. This document provides instructions for a\nMatlab module that simulates classical billiard systems. It is intended to be\nused as both a research and teaching tool. At present, the program efficiently\nsimulates tables that are constructed entirely from line segments and\nelliptical arcs. It functions less reliably for tables with more complex\nboundary components. The program and documentation can be downloaded from\n\\textit{http://www.math.gatech.edu/$\\sim$mason/papers/}.\n", "  We derive the multi-field, micropolar-type continuum theory for the\ntwo-dimensional model of crystal having finite-size particles. Continuum\ntheories are usually valid for waves with wavelength much larger than the size\nof primitive cell of crystal. By comparison of the dispersion relations, it is\ndemonstrated that in contrast to the single-field continuum theory constructed\nin our previous paper the multi-field generalization is valid not only for long\nbut also for short waves. We show that the multi-field model can be used to\ndescribe spatially localized short- and long wavelength distortions. Short-wave\nexternal fields of forces and torques can be also naturally taken into account\nby the multi-field continuum theory.\n", "  We discuss the quasiclassical approximation for the equations of motions of a\nnonlinear chain of phonons and electrons having phonon mediated hopping.\nDescribing the phonons and electrons as even and odd grassmannian functions and\nusing the continuum limit we show that the equations of motions lead to a\nZakharov-like system for bosonic and fermionic fields. Localised and\nnonlocalised solutions are discussed using the Hirota bilinear formalism.\nNonlocalised solutions turn out to appear naturally for any choice of wave\nparameters. The bosonic localised solution has a fermionic dressing while the\nfermionic one is an oscillatory localised field. They appear only if some\nconstraints on the dispersion are imposed. In this case the density of fermions\nis a strongly localised travelling wave. Also it is shown that in the multiple\nscales approach the emergent equation is linear. Only for the resonant case we\nget a nonlinear fermionic Yajima-Oikawa system. Physical implications are\ndiscussed.\n", "  We have found a synchronization behavior between two identical chaotic\nsystems^M when their delay times are modulated by a common irregular signal. ^M\n  This phenomenon is demonstrated both in two identical chaotic maps whose\ndelay times are driven by a common^M chaotic or random signal and in two\nidentical chaotic oscillators whose delay times are driven by^M a signal of\nanother chaotic oscillator. We analyze the phenomenon by using^M the Lyapunov\nexponents and discuss it in relation with generalized synchronization.^M\n", "  Computational anatomy (CA) has introduced the idea of anatomical structures\nbeing transformed by geodesic deformations on groups of diffeomorphisms. Among\nthese geometric structures, landmarks and image outlines in CA are shown to be\nsingular solutions of a partial differential equation that is called the\ngeodesic EPDiff equation. A recently discovered momentum map for singular\nsolutions of EPDiff yields their canonical Hamiltonian formulation, which in\nturn provides a complete parameterization of the landmarks by their canonical\npositions and momenta. The momentum map provides an isomorphism between\nlandmarks (and outlines) for images and singular soliton solutions of the\nEPDiff equation. This isomorphism suggests a new dynamical paradigm for CA, as\nwell as new data representation.\n", "  We report observations of stable, localized, line-like structures in the\nspatially periodic pattern formed by nematic electroconvection, along which the\nphase of the pattern jumps by $\\pi$. With increasing electric voltage, these\nlines form a grid-like structure that goes over into a structure\nindistinguishable from the well known grid pattern. We present theoretical\narguments that suggest that the twisted cell geometry we are using is\nindirectly stabilizing the phase jump lines, and that the PJL lattice is caused\nby an interaction of phase jump lines and a zig-zag instability of the\nsurrounding pattern.\n", "  A generalization of the negative Camassa-Holm hierarchy to 2+1 dimensions is\npresented under the name CHH(2+1). Several hodograph transformations are\napplied in order to transform the hierarchy into a system of coupled CBS\n(Calogero-Bogoyavlenskii-Schiff) equations in 2+1 dimensions that pass the\nPainleve test. A non-isospectral Lax pair for CHH(2+1) is obtained through the\nabove mentioned relationship with the CBS spectral problem..\n", "  We present a method to determine the relative parameter mismatch in a\ncollection of nearly identical chaotic oscillators by measuring large\ndeviations from the synchronized state. We demonstrate our method with an\nensemble of slightly different circle maps. We discuss how to apply our method\nwhen there is noise, and show an example where the noise intensity is\ncomparable to the mismatch.\n", "  The runup of tsunami waves on the coasts of the barrow bays, channels and\nstraits is studied in the framework of the nonlinear shallow water theory.\nUsing the narrowness of the water channel, the one-dimensional equations are\napplied; they include the variable cross-section of channel. It is shown that\nthe analytical solutions can be obtained with use of the hodograph (Legendre)\ntransformation similar to the wave runup on the plane beach. As a result, the\nlinear wave equation is derived and all physical variables (water displacement,\nfluid velocity, coordinate and time) can be determined. The dynamics of the\nmoving shoreline (boundary of the flooding zone) is investigated in details. It\nis shown that all analytical formulas for the moving shoreline can be obtained\nexplicitly. Two examples of the incident wave shapes are analysed: sine wave\nand parabolic pulse. The last example demonstrates that even for approaching of\nthe crest only, the flooding can appear very quickly; then water will recede\nrelatively slowly, and then again quickly return to the initial state.\n", "  The origin of 1D spirals or antisymmetric 1D pulses is explaind so far on the\nbasis of multistability of spatially inhomogeneous and temporally oscillatory\nphases and so called nonvariational effects. Thus, coupled amplitude equations\nwhich are valid near a co-dimention 2 point and provides with the necessary\nmultistable environment are commonly in use in the numerical calculations to\ngenerate such structures. In the present work we analytically show that a\ncomplex Ginzburg-Landau type amplitude equation which is valid in the Hopf\nregion of phase space near an instability threshold admits solutions like\nantisymmetric pulses traveling in alternate directions from a core. The pulses\ncan have well defined spatial profile like Hermite polynomial of order unity on\nthe side of the direction of its motion. Thus, a pulse moving in the positive\ndirection of x-axis from near a core at origin will be a peak while that moving\nin the negative direction is a trough and a temporal oscillation of such\nstructures would give the impression of alternative peak and troughs are moving\nappart being generated from a common core.\n", "  A theoretical analysis of the subharmonic generation process in an acoustical\nresonator (interferometer) with plane walls is performed. It is shown that,\nwhen both the pumping wave and the generated subharmonic are detuned with\nrespect to the resonator modes, the fields can display complex temporal\nbehaviour such as self-pulsing and chaos. A discussion about the acoustical\nparameters required for the experimental observation of the phenomenon is\ngiven.\n", "  A dispersionless integrable system underlying 2+1-dimensional hyperCR\nEinstein--Weyl structures is obtained as a symmetry reduction of the\nanti--self--dual Yang--Mills equations with the gauge group Diff$(S^1)$. Two\nspecial classes of solutions are obtained from well known soliton equations by\nembedding SU(1,1) in ${Diff}(S^1)$.\n", "  We study the dynamics of moving discrete breathers in an interfaced piecewise\nDNA molecule.\n  This is a DNA chain in which all the base pairs are identical and there\nexists an interface such that the base pairs dipole moments at each side are\noriented in opposite directions.\n  The Hamiltonian of the Peyrard--Bishop model is augmented with a term that\nincludes the dipole--dipole coupling between base pairs. Numerical simulations\nshow the existence of two dynamical regimes. If the translational kinetic\nenergy of a moving breather launched towards the interface is below a critical\nvalue, it is trapped in a region around the interface collecting vibrational\nenergy. For an energy larger than the critical value, the breather is\ntransmitted and continues travelling along the double strand with lower\nvelocity. Reflection phenomena never occur.\n  The same study has been carried out when a single dipole is oriented in\nopposite direction to the other ones.\n  When moving breathers collide with the single inverted dipole, the same\neffects appear. These results emphasize the importance of this simple type of\nlocal inhomogeneity as it creates a mechanism for the trapping of energy.\n  Finally, the simulations show that, under favorable conditions, several\nlaunched moving breathers can be trapped successively at the interface region\nproducing an accumulation of vibrational energy. Moreover, an additional\ncolliding moving breather can produce a saturation of energy and a moving\nbreather with all the accumulated energy is transmitted to the chain.\n", "  The statistical geometry of dispersing Lagrangian clusters of four particles\n(tetrahedra) is studied by means of high-resolution direct numerical\nsimulations of three-dimensional homogeneous isotropic turbulence. We give the\nfirst evidence of a self-similar regime of shape dynamics characterized by\nalmost two-dimensional, strongly elongated geometries. The analysis of\nfour-point velocity-difference statistics and orientation shows that\ninertial-range eddies typically generate a straining field with a strong\nextensional component aligned with the elongation direction and weak\nextensional/compressional components in the orthogonal plane.\n", "  We present an alternative derivation of upper-bounds for the bulk modulus of\nboth two-dimensional and three-dimensional cellular materials. For\ntwo-dimensional materials, we recover exactly the expression of the\nHashin-Shtrikman (HS) upper-bound in the low-density limit, while for\nthree-dimensional materials we even improve the HS bound. Furthermore, we\nestablish necessary and sufficient conditions on the cellular structure for\nmaximizing the bulk modulus, for a given solid volume fraction. These\nconditions are found to be exactly those under which the electrical (or\nthermal) conductivity of the material reaches its maximal value as well. These\nresults provide a set of straightforward criteria allowing to address the\ndesign of optimized cellular materials, and shed light on recent studies of\nstructures with both maximal bulk modulus and maximal conductivity. Finally, we\ndiscuss the compatibility of the criteria presented here with the geometrical\nconstraints caused by minimization of surface energy in a real foam.\n", "  We determine all cases when there exists a meromorphic solution of the third\norder ODE describing traveling waves solutions of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky\nequation. It turns out that there are no other meromorphic solutions besides\nthose explicit solutions found by Kuramoto and Kudryashov. The general method\nused in this paper, based on Nevanlinna theory, is applicable to finding all\nmeromorphic solutions of a wide class of non-linear ODE.\n  Keywords: Kuramoto and Sivashinsky equation, meromorphic functions, elliptic\nfunctions, Nevanlinna theory.\n", "  We present a family of birational transformations in $ CP_2$ depending on\ntwo, or three, parameters which does not, generically, preserve meromorphic\ntwo-forms. With the introduction of the orbit of the critical set (vanishing\ncondition of the Jacobian), also called ``post-critical set'', we get some new\nstructures, some \"non-analytic\" two-form which reduce to meromorphic two-forms\nfor particular subvarieties in the parameter space. On these subvarieties, the\niterates of the critical set have a polynomial growth in the \\emph{degrees of\nthe parameters}, while one has an exponential growth out of these subspaces.\nThe analysis of our birational transformation in $ CP_2$ is first carried out\nusing Diller-Favre criterion in order to find the complexity reduction of the\nmapping. The integrable cases are found. The identification between the\ncomplexity growth and the topological entropy is, one more time, verified. We\nperform plots of the post-critical set, as well as calculations of Lyapunov\nexponents for many orbits, confirming that generically no meromorphic two-form\ncan be preserved for this mapping. These birational transformations in $ CP_2$,\nwhich, generically, do not preserve any meromorphic two-form, are extremely\nsimilar to other birational transformations we previously studied, which do\npreserve meromorphic two-forms. We note that these two sets of birational\ntransformations exhibit totally similar results as far as topological\ncomplexity is concerned, but drastically different results as far as a more\n``probabilistic'' approach of dynamical systems is concerned (Lyapunov\nexponents). With these examples we see that the existence of a preserved\nmeromorphic two-form explains most of the (numerical) discrepancy between the\ntopological and probabilistic approach of dynamical systems.\n", "  The dynamics of the localized region of the Lyapunov vector for the largest\nLyapunov exponent is discussed in quasi-one-dimensional hard-disk systems at\nlow density. We introduce a hopping rate to quantitatively describe the\nmovement of the localized region of this Lyapunov vector, and show that it is a\ndecreasing function of hopping distance, implying spatial correlation of the\nlocalized regions. This behavior is explained quantitatively by a brick\naccumulation model derived from hard-disk dynamics in the low density limit, in\nwhich hopping of the localized Lyapunov vector is represented as the movement\nof the highest brick position. We also give an analytical expression for the\nhopping rate, which is obtained us a sum of probability distributions for brick\nheight configurations between two separated highest brick sites. The results of\nthese simple models are in good agreement with the simulation results for\nhard-disk systems.\n", "  We study the Lyapunov exponents of a two-dimensional, random Lorentz gas at\nlow density. The positive Lyapunov exponent may be obtained either by a direct\nanalysis of the dynamics, or by the use of kinetic theory methods. To leading\norders in the density of scatterers it is of the form\n$A_{0}\\tilde{n}\\ln\\tilde{n}+B_{0}\\tilde{n}$, where $A_{0}$ and $B_{0}$ are\nknown constants and $\\tilde{n}$ is the number density of scatterers expressed\nin dimensionless units. In this paper, we find that through order\n$(\\tilde{n}^{2})$, the positive Lyapunov exponent is of the form\n$A_{0}\\tilde{n}\\ln\\tilde{n}+B_{0}\\tilde{n}+A_{1}\\tilde{n}^{2}\\ln\\tilde{n}\n+B_{1}\\tilde{n}^{2}$. Explicit numerical values of the new constants $A_{1}$\nand $B_{1}$ are obtained by means of a systematic analysis. This takes into\naccount, up to $O(\\tilde{n}^{2})$, the effects of {\\it all\\/} possible\ntrajectories in two versions of the model; in one version overlapping scatterer\nconfigurations are allowed and in the other they are not.\n", "  We present a detailed analysis of the solution of the focusing nonlinear\nSchr\\\"odinger equation with initial condition $\\psi(x,0)=N {\\rm sech}(x)$ in\nthe limit $N\\to\\infty$. We begin by presenting new and more accurate numerical\nreconstructions of the $N$-soliton by inverse scattering (numerical linear\nalgebra) for N=5, 10, 20, and 40. We then recast the inverse-scattering problem\nas a Riemann-Hilbert problem and provide a rigorous asymptotic analysis of this\nproblem in the large-N limit. For those $(x,t)$ where results have been\nobtained by other authors, we improve the error estimates from $O(N^{-1/3})$ to\n$O(N^{-1})$. We also analyze the Fourier power spectrum in this regime and\nrelate the results to the optical phenomenon of supercontinuum generation. We\nthen study the $N$-soliton for values of $(x,t)$ where analysis has not been\ncarried out before, and we uncover new phenomena. The main discovery of this\npaper is the mathematical mechanism for a secondary caustic (phase transition),\nwhich turns out to differ from the mechanism that generates the primary\ncaustic. The mechanism for the generation of the secondary caustic depends\nessentially on the discrete nature of the spectrum for the $N$-soliton, and\nmore significantly, cannot be recovered from an analysis of an ostensibly\nsimilar Riemann-Hilbert problem in the conditions of which a certain formal\ncontinuum limit is taken on an {\\em ad hoc} basis\n", "  We present a method for hierarchic categorization and taxonomy evolution\ndescription. We focus on the structure of epistemic communities (ECs), or\ngroups of agents sharing common knowledge concerns. Introducing a formal\nframework based on Galois lattices, we categorize ECs in an automated and\nhierarchically structured way and propose criteria for selecting the most\nrelevant epistemic communities - for instance, ECs gathering a certain\nproportion of agents and thus prototypical of major fields. This process\nproduces a manageable, insightful taxonomy of the community. Then, the\nlongitudinal study of these static pictures makes possible an historical\ndescription. In particular, we capture stylized facts such as field progress,\ndecline, specialization, interaction (merging or splitting), and paradigm\nemergence. The detection of such patterns in social networks could fruitfully\nbe applied to other contexts.\n", "  The relation between the Lyapunov modes (delocalized Lyapunov vectors) and\nthe momentum autocorrelation function is discussed in two-dimensional hard-disk\nsystems. We show numerical evidence that the smallest time-oscillating period\nof the Lyapunov modes is twice as long as the time-oscillating period of\nmomentum autocorrelation function for both square and rectangular\ntwo-dimensional systems with hard-wall boundary conditions.\n", "  Stationary bifurcations in several nonlinear models of fluid conveying pipes\nfixed at both ends are analyzed with the use of Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction and\nsingularity theory. Influence of gravitational force, curvature and vertical\nelastic support on various properties of bifurcating solutions are\ninvestigated. In particular the conditions for occurrence of supercritical and\nsubcritical bifurcations are presented for the models of Holmes, Thurman and\nMote, and Paidoussis.\n", "  Evolution depends on the possibility of successfully exploring fitness\nlandscapes via mutation and recombination. With these search procedures,\nexploration is difficult in \"rugged\" fitness landscapes, where small mutations\ncan drastically change functionalities in an organism. Random Boolean networks\n(RBNs), being general models, can be used to explore theories of how evolution\ncan take place in rugged landscapes; or even change the landscapes.\n  In this paper, we study the effect that redundant nodes have on the\nrobustness of RBNs. Using computer simulations, we have found that the addition\nof redundant nodes to RBNs increases their robustness. We conjecture that\nredundancy is a way of \"smoothening\" fitness landscapes. Therefore, redundancy\ncan facilitate evolutionary searches. However, too much redundancy could reduce\nthe rate of adaptation of an evolutionary process. Our results also provide\nsupporting evidence in favour of Kauffman's conjecture (Kauffman, 2000, p.195).\n", "  We investigate the effect of the phase difference of applied fields on the\ndynamics of mutually coupled Josephson junction.\n  The system desynchronizes for any value of applied phase difference and the\ndynamics even changes from chaotic to periodic motion for some values of\napplied phase difference. We report that by keeping the value of phase\ndifference as $\\pi$, the system continues to be in periodic motion for a wide\nrange of system parameter values which might be of great practical\napplications.\n", "  We show that the third-order difference equations proposed by Hirota,\n  Kimura and Yahagi are generated by a pair of second-order difference\nequations. In some cases, the pair of the second-order equations are equivalent\nto the Quispel-Robert-Thomson(QRT) system, but in the other cases, they are\nirrelevant to the QRT system. We also discuss an ultradiscretization of the\nequations.\n", "  We have applied the Melnikov criterion to examine a global homoclinic\nbifurcation and transition to chaos in a case of the Duffing system with\nnonlinear fractional damping and external excitation.\n  Using perturbation methods we have found a critical forcing amplitude above\nwhich the system may behave chaotically.\n  The results have been verified by numerical simulations using standard\nnonlinear tools as\n  Poincare maps and a Lyapunov exponent. Above the critical Melnikov amplitude\n$\\mu_c$, which is the sufficient condition of a global homoclinic bifurcation,\nwe have observed the region with a transient chaotic motion.\n", "  In this paper, we use Hirota's bilinear method to directly construct periodic\nwave solutions of nonlinear equations.\n  The asymptotic property of periodic wave solutions are analyzed. It is shown\nthat well-known soliton solutions can be reduced from the periodic wave\nsolutions.\n", "  We study stability and dynamics of the single cylindrically symmetric\nsolitary structures and dipolar solitonic molecules in spatially nonlocal\nmedia. The main properties of the solitons, vortex solitons, and dipolar\nsolitons are investigated analytically and numerically. The vortices and\nhigher-order solitons show the transverse symmetry-breaking azimuthal\ninstability below some critical power.\n  We find the threshold of the vortex soliton stabilization using the linear\nstability analysis and direct numerical simulations. The higher-order solitons,\nwhich have a central peak and one or more surrounding rings, are also\ndemonstrated to be stabilized in nonlocal nonlinear media. Using direct\nnumerical simulations, we find a class of radially asymmetric, dipole-like\nsolitons and show that, at sufficiently high power, these structures are\nstable.\n", "  We construct an elliptic generalization of the Schlesinger system (ESS) with\npositions of marked points on an elliptic curve and its modular parameter as\nindependent variables (the parameters in the moduli space of the complex\nstructure). ESS is a non-autonomous Hamiltonian system with pair-wise commuting\nHamiltonians. The system is bihamiltonian with respect to the linear and the\nquadratic Poisson brackets. The latter are the multi-color generalization of\nthe Sklyanin-Feigin-Odeskii classical algebras. We give the Lax form of the\nESS. The Lax matrix defines a connection of a flat bundle of degree one over\nthe elliptic curve with first order poles at the marked points.\n  The ESS is the monodromy independence condition on the complex structure for\nthe linear systems related to the flat bundle.\n  The case of four points for a special initial data is reduced to the\nPainlev{\\'e} VI equation in the form of the Zhukovsky-Volterra gyrostat,\nproposed in our previous paper.\n", "  In this paper we consider a class of semihamiltonian systems characterized by\nthe existence of a special conservation law.\n  The density and the current of this conservation law satisfy a second order\nsystem of PDEs which has a natural interpretation in the theory of flat\nbifferential ideals. The class of systems we consider contains important\nwell-known examples of semihamiltonian systems. Other examples, like genus 1\n  Whitham modulation equations for KdV, are related to this class by a\nreciprocal trasformation.\n", "  We propose a differential difference equation in ${\\mathcal R}^1\\times\n{\\mathcal Z}^2$ and study it by\n  Hirota's bilinear method. This equation has a singular continuum limit into a\nsystem which admits the reduction to the Davey-Stewartson equation. The\nsolutions of this discrete DS system are characterized by Casorati and Grammian\ndeterminants. Based on the bilinear form of this discrete DS system, we\nconstruct the bilinear B\\\"{a}cklund transformation which enables us to obtain\nits Lax pair.\n", "  By choosing a dynamical system with d different couplings, one can rearrange\na system based on the graph with given vertex dependent on the dynamical system\nelements. The relation between the dynamical elements (coupling) is replaced by\na relation between the vertexes. Based on the E_0 transverse projection\noperator. We addressed synchronization problem of an array of the linearly\ncoupled map lattices of identical discrete time systems.\n  The synchronization rate is determined by the second largest eigenvalue of\nthe transition probability matrix. Algebraic properties of the Bose-Mesner\nalgebra with an associated scheme with definite spectrum has been used in order\nto study the stability of the coupled map lattice. Associated schemes play a\nkey role and may lead to analytical methods in studying the stability of the\ndynamical systems. The relation between the coupling parameters and the chaotic\nregion is presented. It is shown that the feasible region is analytically\ndetermined by the number of couplings (i.e, by increasing the number of coupled\nmaps the feasible region is restricted). It is very easy to apply our criteria\nto the system being studied and they encompass a wide range of coupling schemes\nincluding most of the popularly used ones in the literature.\n", "  We apply random matrix theory to complex networks. We show that nearest\nneighbor spacing distribution of the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrices of\nvarious model networks, namely scale-free, small-world and random networks\nfollow universal Gaussian orthogonal ensemble statistics of random matrix\ntheory. Secondly we show an analogy between the onset of small-world behavior,\nquantified by the structural properties of networks, and the transition from\nPoisson to Gaussian orthogonal ensemble statistics, quantified by Brody\nparameter characterizing a spectral property. We also present our analysis for\na protein-protein interaction network in budding yeast.\n", "  In this paper we analyze the cycle-to-cycle variations of maximum pressure\n$p_{max}$ and peak pressure angle $\\alpha_{pmax}$ in a four-cylinder spark\nignition engine. We examine the experimental time series of $p_{max}$ and\n$\\alpha_{pmax}$ for three different spark advance angles. Using standard\nstatistical techniques such as return maps and histograms we show that\ndepending on the spark advance angle, there are significant differences in the\nfluctuations of $p_{max}$ and\n  $\\alpha_{pmax}$. We also calculate the multiscale entropy of the various time\nseries to estimate the effect of randomness in these fluctuations. Finally, we\nexplain how the information on both $p_{max}$ and $\\alpha_{pmax}$ can be used\nto develop optimal strategies for controlling the combustion process and\nimproving engine performance.\n", "  A measurement of direct photon production in 208Pb + 208Pb collisions at 158\nA GeV has been carried out in the CERN WA98 experiment. The invariant yield of\ndirect photons in central collisions is extracted as a function of transverse\nmomentum in the interval 0.5 < p_T < 4 GeV/c. A significant direct photon\nsignal, compared to statistical and systematical errors, is seen at p_T > 1.5\nGeV/c. The results constitute the first observation of direct photons in\nultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions which could be significant for diagnosis\nof quark gluon plasma formation.\n", "  The COSY-11 collaboration has measured the total cross section for the pp -->\npp eta-prime and pp --> pp eta reactions in the excess energy range from\n  Q = 1.5 MeV to Q = 23.6 MeV and from Q = 0.5 MeV to Q = 5.4 MeV,\nrespectively.\n  Measurements have been performed with the total luminosity of 73 nb^(-1) for\nthe pp --> pp eta reaction and 1360 nb^(-1) for the pp --> pp eta-prime one.\nRecent results are presented and discussed.\n", "  A summary of current interferometry data in relativistic heavy ions is\npresented. At sqrt{s}=17GeV a sudden increase in the pion source volume is\nobserved for central PbPb collisions.\n  This seems to imply that the pion phase density has reached a limit.\n  The source size of different particles decreases with mass when the\ntransverse velocity is held constant but increases with mass when the\ntransverse mass is held constant. The antiproton source radius is larger than\nthe proton source radius. So far no long lived source has been seen. The pion\nsource size varies slowly with rapidity but more rapidly with transverse mass\nimplying strong transverse flow. There is very slow increase of pion radii with\nsqrt{s}.\n", "  The yields and velocity distributions of heavy residues and fission fragments\nfrom the reaction of 20 MeV/nucleon 197Au + 90Zr have been measured using the\nMSU A1200 fragment separator. A bimodal distribution of residues is observed,\nwith one group, resulting from peripheral collisions, having fragment mass\nnumbers A=160-200, while the other group, resulting from ``hard'' collisions,\nhas A=120-160. This latter group of residues can be distinguished from fission\nfragments by their lower velocities. A model combining deep-inelastic transfer\nand incomplete fusion for the primary interaction stage and a statistical\nevaporation code for the deexcitation stage has been used to describe the\nproperties of the product distributions.\n", "  All existing \"positive\" results on two neutrino double beta decay in\ndifferent nuclei were analyzed. Using procedure recommended by Particle Data\nGroup weighted average values for half-lives of $^{48}$Ca, $^{76}$Ge,\n$^{82}$Se, $^{96}$Zr, $^{100}$Mo, $^{100}$Mo - $^{100}$Ru ($0^+_1$),\n$^{116}$Cd, $^{150}$Nd and $^{238}$U were obtained. Existing geochemical data\nwere analyzed and recommended values for half-lives of $^{128}$Te and\n$^{130}$Te are proposed. We recommend to use these results as most precise and\nreliable values for half-lives at this moment.\n", "  The $\\alpha$-decay rates for the nuclides $^{168,170,171,172,173,174,176}$Yb\nand $^{148,150,152,154}$Gd have been estimated from transmission probabilities\nin a systematic $\\alpha$-nucleus potential and from an improved fit to\n$\\alpha$-decay rates in the rare-earth mass region. Whereas ${\\alpha}$-decay of\n$^{152}$Gd in natural gadolinium is a severe obstacle for the use of gadolinium\nas a low-energy solar-neutrino detector, we show that\n  ${\\alpha}$-decay does not contribute significantly to the background in a\nytterbium detector. An extremely long ${\\alpha}$-decay lifetime of $^{168}$Yb\nis obtained from calculation, which may be close to the sensitivity limit in a\nlow-background solar neutrino detector.\n", "  Differential cross sections for Compton scattering from the deuteron were\nmeasured at MAX-lab for incident photon energies of 55 MeV and 66 MeV at\nnominal laboratory angles of $45^\\circ$, $125^\\circ$, and $135^\\circ$. Tagged\nphotons were scattered from liquid deuterium and detected in three NaI\nspectrometers. By comparing the data with theoretical calculations in the\nframework of a one-boson-exchange potential model, the sum and difference of\nthe isospin-averaged nucleon polarizabilities, $\\alpha_N + \\beta_N = 17.4 \\pm\n3.7$ and $\\alpha_N - \\beta_N = 6.4 \\pm 2.4$ (in units of $10^{-4}$ fm$^3$),\nhave been determined. By combining the latter with the global-averaged value\nfor $\\alpha_p - \\beta_p$ and using the predictions of the Baldin sum rule for\nthe sum of the nucleon polarizabilities, we have obtained values for the\nneutron electric and magnetic polarizabilities of $\\alpha_n= 8.8 \\pm\n2.4$(total) $\\pm 3.0$(model) and $\\beta_n = 6.5 \\mp 2.4$(total) $\\mp\n3.0$(model), respectively.\n", "  Some recent precision experiments in low energy muon physics are discussed.\nSpectroscopy on the muonium atom, the bound state of a positve muon and an\nelectron, has provided precise tests of standard theory and yielded most\nprecise values of important fundamental constants. A search for spontaneous\nmuonium to antimuonium conversion test lepton flavour conservation and yields\nmost stringent limits on parameters in several speculative models. The muon\nmagnetic anomaly may contain hints to new physics and is a relevant calibration\npoint for numerous models beyond standard theory. Since most precision\nexperiments are limited by the particle fluxes at present muon sources,\npossibilities in this field are shown which will emerge at upgraded present\nfacilities or new accelerator complexes under construction or planning. At such\nplaces novel techniques would be enabled.\n", "  At the Kernfysisch Versneller Instituut (KVI) in Groningen, NL, a new\nfacility (TRI$\\mu$P) is under development. It aims for producing, slowing down\nand trapping of radioactive isotopes in order to perform accurate measurements\non fundamental symmetries and interactions. A spectrum of radioactive nuclids\nwill be produced in direct, inverse kinematics of fragmentation reactions using\nheavy ion beams from the superconducting AGOR cyclotron. The research programme\npursued by the KVI group includes precision studies of nuclear $\\beta$-decays\nthrough $\\beta$--neutrino (recoil nucleus) momentum correlations in weak decays\nand searches for permanent electric dipole moments in heavy atomic systems.\nThis offers a large potential for discovering new physics or to limit\nparameters in models beyond standard theory significantly. The scientific\napproach chosen in TRI$\\mu$P can be regarded as complementary to such high\nenergy physics. The facility in Groningen will be open for use by the worldwide\ncommunity of scientists.\n", "  Due to their short life-time, flavour-neutral mesons cannot be utilized as\nfree secondary beams or targets, and therefore a study of their interaction\nwith nucleons is not possible via direct scattering experiments.\n  This interaction is, however, accessible via its influence on the energy\ndependence - and on the phase space distributions of the cross sections for\nreactions in which these mesons are produced.\n  In case of the p p --> p p eta reaction the experimentally determined\ndistributions of the differential cross sections close to the production\nthreshold cannot be described by taking into account the S-wave proton-proton\nand proton-eta interaction only. Here we show that the angular distributions\ndetermined at the COSY-11 facility reveal some evidence for P-wave admixture in\nthe proton-proton subsystem already at an excess energy as low as Q = 15.5 MeV.\n  We also present that one can estimate the relative strength of the\neta-nucleon and eta-prime-nucleon interactions by comparison of the eta and\neta-prime production yield.\n", "  The Crystal Ball Spectrometer is being used at Brookhaven National Laboratory\nin a series of experiments which study all neutral final states of pi-p and K-p\ninduced reactions. We report about the experimental setup and progress in\nobtaining new results for the radiative capture reactions pi-p-->gn and\nK-p-->gL,charge exchange pi-p-->pi0n,two pi0 production pi-p-->pi0pi0n, and eta\nproduction pi-p-->eta n reactions. Data have also been obtained on the decays\nof N*, Delta, Lambda, and Sigma resonances. Threshold eta production has been\nstudied in detail for both pi-p and K-p. Sequential resonance decays have been\ninvestigated bystudying the 2pi0 production mechanism both in the fundamental\ninteraction and in nuclei. In addition, we have used the etas produced near\nthreshold to make precision measurements searching in particular for rare and\nforbidden eta decays.\n", "  We have measured the nuclear transparency of the fundamental process $\\gamma$\nn $\\to \\pi^-$ p in $^4$He. These measurements were performed at Jefferson Lab\nin the photon energy range of 1.6 to 4.5 GeV and at $\\theta^{\\pi}_{cm}=\n70^\\circ$ and $90^\\circ$. These measurements are the first of their kind in the\nstudy of nuclear transparency in photoreactions. They also provide a benchmark\ntest of Glauber calculations based on traditional models of nuclear physics.\nThe transparency results suggest deviations from the traditional nuclear\nphysics picture. The momentum transfer dependence of the measured nuclear\ntransparency is consistent with Glauber calculations which include the quantum\nchromodynamics phenomenon of color transparency.\n", "  The 12B excitation energy spectrum has been obtained from coincidence\nmeasurements of the 9Be+7Li -> 2alpha+8Li reaction at E{0}=52 MeV.\n  The decay of the states at excitations between 10 and 16 Mev into alpha$+8Li\nhas been observed for the first time. Observed alpha-decay indicates possible\ncluster structure of the 12B excited states.\n  The influence of these states on the cross section of the astrophysically\nimportant 8Li(alpha,n)11B and 9Be+t reactions is discussed and the results are\ncompared with existing results.\n", "  A multisection liquid argon ionization detector was developed by the DBA\ncollaboration to study the double beta- decay of $^{100}$Mo. The experiment was\ncarried out in the Gran Sasso underground laboratory in Italy. The detector\ndesign and main characteristics are described. The $\\beta \\beta (2\\nu)$ decay\nof $^{100}$Mo was observed and its half-life measured: $T_{1/2}=[7.2 \\pm\n0.9(stat) \\pm 1.8(syst)] \\times 10^{18}$ yr. Limits on the 0$\\nu $ and 0$\\nu\n\\chi ^{0}$ modes of the decay were obtained: $T_{1/2}> 8.4(4.9) \\times 10^{21}$\nyr and $T_{1/2}> 4.1(3.2)\\times 10^{20}$ yr at 68% (90%) C.L., respectively. In\naddition the upper limits on the $^{42}$Ar content and $^{222}$Rn activity in\nliquid Ar were found to be $4.3 \\times 10^{-21}$ g/g and $1.2 \\times 10^{-3}$\nBq/kg, respectively.\n", "  Studies of meson production in nucleon-nucleon collisions at threshold are\ncharacterised by few degrees of freedom in a configuration of well defined\ninitial and final states with a transition governed by short range dynamics.\nEffects from low-energy scattering in the exit channel are inherent to the data\nand probe the interaction in baryon-meson and meson-meson systems otherwise\ndifficult to access.\n  From dedicated experiments at the present generation of cooler rings precise\ndata are becoming available on differential and eventually spin observables\nallowing detailed comparisons between complementary final states. To discuss\nphysics implications of generic and specific properties, recent experimental\nresults on meson production in proton-proton scattering obtained at CELSIUS and\nCOSY serve as a guideline.\n", "  The absolute strengths of the Ea=1175keV resonance in the 6Li(a,g)10B\nreaction and of the Ea=814 keV resonance in the 7Li(a,g)11B reaction have been\nmeasured to $\\omega\\gamma$=366+-38 meV and $\\omega\\gamma$=300+-32 meV,\nrespectively, in good agreement with previous values.\n  These resonances can be used to measure the absolute acceptance of the recoil\nseparator ERNA to a precision of about 10%.\n", "  There are two independent claims for the discovery of element 112: The claim\nby Hofmann et al. from 1996 and the older claim from 1971 by Marinov et al.\nThis Comment will not challenge the experimental results of Hofmann et al., but\nit will discuss one aspect of the claimed discovery of element 112 by Marinov\net al., as their experiment has never been reproduced in exactly the form in\nwhich the original experiment has been carried out. The reasons for this\ndeficiency may not be found in the field of science, but possibly in\nradioprotection restrictions for researchers who want to carry out such an\nexperiment. However, such is not a sufficient reason to exclude the original\nclaim from all considerations of the responsible international authorities, who\nhave to settle such priority questions. It may be in agreement with scientific\ntraditions, that when the responsible international committees do not feel to\nbe able to come to a positive decision on the \"1971\" claim, they could keep the\npriority problem unsettled for the time being.\n", "  The hadronic final state of central Pb+Pb collisions at 20, 30, 40, 80, and\n158 AGeV has been measured by the CERN NA49 collaboration. The mean transverse\nmass of pions and kaons at midrapidity stays nearly constant in this energy\nrange, whereas at lower energies, at the AGS, a steep increase with beam energy\nwas measured. Compared to p+p collisions as well as to model calculations,\nanomalies in the energy dependence of pion and kaon production at lower SPS\nenergies are observed. These findings can be explained, assuming that the\nenergy density reached in central A+A collisions at lower SPS energies is\nsufficient to force the hot and dense nuclear matter into a deconfined phase.\n", "  We describe the neutron polarimeter NPOL3 for the measurement of polarization\ntransfer observables $D_{ij}$ with a typical high resolution of $\\sim$300 keV\nat $T_n$ $\\simeq$ 200 MeV.\n  The NPOL3 system consists of three planes of neutron detectors.\n  The first two planes for neutron polarization analysis are made of 20 sets of\none-dimensional position-sensitive plastic scintillation counters with a size\nof 100 cm $\\times$ 10 cm $\\times$ 5 cm, and they cover the area of 100 $\\times$\n100 $\\mathrm{cm}^2$.\n  The last plane for detecting doubly scattered neutrons or recoiled protons is\nmade of the two-dimensional position-sensitive liquid scintillation counter\nwith a size of 100 cm $\\times$ 100 cm $\\times$ 10 cm.\n  The effective analyzing powers $A_{y;\\mathrm{eff}}$ and double scattering\nefficiencies $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{D.S.}}$ were measured by using the three kinds\nof polarized neutrons from the ${}^{2}{\\rm H}(\\vec{p},\\vec{n})pp$, ${}^{6}{\\rm\nLi}(\\vec{p},\\vec{n}){}^{6}{\\rm Be}(\\mathrm{g.s.})$, and ${}^{12}{\\rm\nC}(\\vec{p},\\vec{n}){}^{12}{\\rm N}(\\mathrm{g.s.})$ reactions at $T_p$ = 198 MeV.\n  The performance of NPOL3 defined as\n$\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{D.S.}}(A_{y;\\mathrm{eff}})^2$ are similar to that of the\nIndiana Neutron POLarimeter (INPOL) by taking into account for the counter\nconfiguration difference between these two neutron polarimeters.\n", "  The recent discovery of hindrance in heavy-ion induced fusion reactions at\nextreme sub-barrier energies represents a challenge for theoretical models.\nPreviously, it has been shown that in medium-heavy systems, the onset of fusion\nhindrance depends strongly on the \"stiffness\" of the nuclei in the entrance\nchannel. In this work, we explore its dependence on the total mass and the\n$Q$-value of the fusing systems and find that the fusion hindrance depends in a\nsystematic way on the entrance channel properties over a wide range of systems.\n", "  A method has been proposed for the determination of $\\gamma$ to $\\pi^0$ ratio\nin high energy pp and nucleus-nucleus collisions at large transverse momentum\n($p_T$). In photon measuring device, it is proposed that shower shape analysis\nis made to select only cases with wide showers.\n  These candidates come mostly from $\\pi^0$. Correlation is measured between\nthose photon candidates as trigger particles and associated charged particles\nabove selected $p_T$.\n  The ratio of yields of near and far angle correlation peaks for $\\pi^0$\nevents is compared with correlation peaks from other set of events where\ntrigger particle contains photons for direct-photon jets alongwith $\\pi^0$.\n  The comparative study in reduction of yield of near angle peak is used to\nextract photon fraction.\n", "  Two reactions, pp->ppX and pp->p\\pi^+X, are used to study the 1.47<M<1.68 GeV\nbaryonic mass range. Three different final states are considered in the\ninvariant masses: N^* or \\Delta^+, p\\pi^0, and p\\eta. The last two channels are\ndefined by software cuts applied to the missing mass of the first reaction.\nSeveral narrow structures are extracted with widths \\sigma(\\Gamma) varying\nbetween 3 and 9 MeV. Some structures are observed in one channel but not in\nothers. Such nonobservation may be due either to the spectrometer momenta\nlimits or to the physics (e.g. no such disintegration channel is allowed from\nthe narrow state considered).\n  We tentatively conclude that the broad Particle Data Group (PDG) baryonic\nresonances N(1520)D13, N(1535)S11, Delta(1600)P33, and N(1675)D15 are\ncollective states built from several narrow and weakly excited resonances, each\nhaving a (much) smaller width than the one reported by PDG.\n", "  We performed a coincidence measurement of two nucleons emitted from the\nnonmesonic weak decay (NMWD) of ^{5}_{\\Lambda}He formed via the\n^{6}Li(\\pi^+,K^+) reaction. The energies of two nucleons and the pair number\ndistributions in the opening angle between them were measured. In both np and\nnn pairs, we observed a clean back-to-back correlation coming from the two-body\ndecay of \\Lambda p --> n p and \\Lambda n --> n n, respectively. The ratio of\nthe nucleon pair numbers was N_{nn}/N_{np}=0.45 \\pm 0.11(stat)\\pm 0.03(syst) in\nthe kinematic region of cos(theta_{NN}) < -0.8. Since each decay mode was\nexclusively detected, the measured ratio should be close to the ratio of\n\\Gamma(\\Lambda p --> np)/\\Gamma(\\Lambda n --> nn).\n  The ratio is consistent with recent theoretical calculations based on the\nheavy meson/direct quark exchange picture.\n", "  The results on transverse mass spectra of Lambda hyperons produced in all\ninelastic p+p and p+pbar interactions in the energy range sqrts = 3.6-1800 GeV\nare compiled and analyzed. The energy dependence of the mean transverse mass\nand the inverse slope parameter of the spectra is presented and discussed.\nThese results should be used as a reference in the study of Lambda hyperon\nproduction in nuclear collisions.\n", "  We present the recent results from the STAR experiment on charged and neutral\nparticle measurements at the forward rapidity in d+Au collisions at\nsqrt{s_{NN}} = 200 GeV and Au+Au collisions at sqrt{s_{NN}} = 62.4 GeV. The\nnuclear modification factor for charged and neutral hadrons in d+Au collisions\nare presented. Measurements of Lambda and anti-Lambda production at forward\nrapidity and the variation of net baryon density as a function of collision\ncentrality are discussed. We have also studied the limiting fragmentation of\nphotons and charged particles in Au+Au collisions. The photons and charged\nparticles separately follow the energy independent limiting fragmentation\nbehaviour. However they have been observed to follow a different centrality\ndependence of limiting fragmentation.\n", "  Three precise measurements for elastic pd scattering at 135 MeV/A have been\nperformed with the three different experimental setups. The cross sections are\ndescribed well by the theoretical predictions based on modern nucleon-nucleon\nforces combined with three nucleon forces. Relativistic Faddeev calculations\nshow that relativistic effects are restricted to backward angles. This result\nsupports the two measurements recently reported by RIKEN and contradicts the\nKVI data.\n", "  The rapidity and centrality dependence of baryon to meson ratios in Au$+$Au,\nCu$+$Cu and p$+$p collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV at RHIC is presented.\nThe $\\bar{p}/\\pi^{-}$ ratios are founded to be independent of collision system\nat a fixed $<N_{part}>$ at mid- and forward rapidities.\n", "  This work presents a new possibility of registration of ionizing radiation by\nthe flowing gaseous radiochemical method (FGRM). The specified method uses the\nproperty of some solid crystalline lattice materials for a free emission of\nradioactive isotopes of inert gas atoms formed as a result of nuclear\nreactions. Generated in an ampoule of the detector, the radioactive inert gases\nare transported by a gas-carrier into the proportional gas counter of the\nflowing type, where the decay rate of the radioactive gas species is measured.\nThis quantity is unequivocally related to the flux of particles (neutrons,\nprotons, light and heavy ions) at the location of the ampoule. The method was\nused to monitor the neutron flux of the pulsed neutron target \"RADEX\" driven by\nthe linear proton accelerator of INR RAS. Further progress of the FGRM may give\nrise to possible applications in nuclear physics, astrophysics and medicine, in\nthe nondestructive control of fissionable materials, diagnostics of\nthermonuclear plasma, monitoring of fluxes and measurement of spectra of\nbombarding particles.\n", "  $J/\\psi$ measurements in $p+p$ and $d+Au$ collisions serve as crucial\nreferences to understand the $J/\\psi$ production in $Au+Au$ collisions at RHIC\nwhere quark gluon plasma (QGP) is expected to be formed. They also provide\nimportant clues to study various interesting phenomena such as the gluon\nshadowing and color glass condensate. We report the latest results from PHENIX\nexperiment on $J/\\psi$ production in $p+p$ and $d+Au$ collisions at forward,\nbackward and midrapidity.\n", "  Dihadron correlations at high transverse momentum in d+Au collisions at\nsqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV at midrapidity are measured by the PHENIX experiment at\nthe Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). From these correlations we extract\nseveral structural characteristics of jets; the root-mean-squared (RMS)\ntransverse momentum of fragmenting hadrons with respect to the jet\nsqrt(<j_T^2>), the mean sine-squared angle between the scattered partons\n<sin^2(phi_jj)>, and the number of particles produced within the dijet that are\nassociated with a high-p_T particle (dN/dx_E distributions). We observe that\nthe fragmentation characteristics of jets in d+Au collisions are very similar\nto those in p+p collisions and that there is also little dependence on the\ncentrality of the d+Au collision. This is consistent with the nuclear medium\nhaving little influence on the fragmentation process. Furthermore, there is no\nstatistically significant increase in the value of <sin^2(phi_jj)> from p+p to\nd+Au collisions. This constrains the amount of multiple scattering that partons\nundergo in the cold nuclear medium before and after a hard-collision.\n", "  A systematic investigation of the average multiplicities of light charged\nparticles and intermediate mass fragments emitted in peripheral and\nsemiperipheral collisions is presented as a function of the beam energy,\nviolence of the collision and mass of the system.\n  The data have been collected with the \"Fiasco\" setup in the reactions\n93Nb+93Nb at 17, 23, 30, 38AMeV and 116Sn+116Sn at 30, 38AMeV.\n  The midvelocity emission has been separated from the emission of the\nprojectile-like fragment. This last component appears to be compatible with an\nevaporation from an equilibrated source at normal density, as described by the\nstatistical code Gemini at the appropriate excitation energy.\n  On the contrary, the midvelocity emission presents remarkable differences for\nwhat concerns both the dependence of the multiplicities on the energy deposited\nin the midvelocity region and the isotopic composition of the emitted light\ncharged particles.\n", "  A systematic study of energy spectra for light particles emitted at\nmidrapidity from Au+Au collisions at E=0.25-1.15 A GeV reveals a significant\nnon-thermal component consistent with a collective radial flow. This component\nis evaluated as a function of bombarding energy and event centrality.\nComparisons to Quantum Molecular Dynamics (QMD) and Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck\n(BUU) models are made for different equations of state.\n", "  An isomer, with t1/2 = 35 +- 10 ns and J, Kpi = 14, 14+, has been observed in\nthe nucleus 176W using the reaction 150Nd(30Si,4n) at a beam energy of 133 MeV.\nThe isomer exhibits an unusual pattern of decay in which the _majority_ of the\nflux proceeds directly to states with <K>=0, bypassing available levels of\nintermediate K. This severe breakdown of normal K-selection rules in 176W is\ncompared with recent observations of K-violation in neighboring nuclei, within\nthe framework of proposed theoretical approaches. The available data on these\nK-violating decays seem to have a consistent explanation in models of K-mixing\nwhich include large-amplitude fluctuations of the nuclear shape.\n", "  We report on temperature measurements of nuclear systems formed in the Au+Au\ncollisions at incident energies of 50, 100, 150, 200 and 1000 A MeV. The target\nspectator matter was studied at the highest energy and the interacting zone\n(participants) at the lower ones.The temperature deduced from the isotope\nratios was compared with the one deduced via the excited states population. An\nunexpected disagreement was found between the two measurements.\n", "  A feedforward multilayered neural network has been trained to \"recognize\"\ntrue V0's in the presence of a large combinatoric background using simulated\ndata for 2 GeV/nucleon Ni + Cu interactions. The resulting neural network\nfilter has been applied to actual data from the EOS TPC experiment. An\nenhancement of signal to background over more traditional selection mechanisms\nhas been observed.\n", "  The strategy and techniques for analyzing anisotropic flow (directed,\nelliptic, etc.) in relativistic nuclear collisions are presented. The emphasis\nis on the use of the Fourier expansion of azimuthal distributions. We present\nformulae relevant for this approach, and in particular, show how the event\nmultiplicity enters into the event plane resolution. We also discuss the role\nof non-flow correlations and a method for introducing flow into a simulation.\n", "  A new result from searching for muonium to antimuonium conversion is reported\nwhich sets an upper limit on the coupling constant in an assumed $(V-A) \\times\n(V-A)$ type interaction of $G_{M\\bar{M}} \\leq 3\\cdot 10^{-3} G_F$ ~ (90% C.L.).\n  A particular Z_8 and a minimal 331 GUT model can be ruled out. Further new\nand stringent limits can be set for masses of bileptonic gauge bosons and\n$\\lambda$ parameters in R-parity breaking supersymmetric models.\n", "  A new experiment has been set up at the Paul Scherrer Institut to search for\nmuonium to antimuonium conversion. No event was found to fulfil the requested\nsignature which consists of the coincident detection of both constituents of\nthe antiatom in its decay. Assuming an effective (V-A)$\\times$(V-A) type\ninteraction an improved upper limit is established for the conversion\nprobability of ${\\rm P_{M\\bar{M}}} \\leq 8 \\cdot 10^{-9}$ (90%C.L.), which is\nalmost two orders of magnitude lower compared to previous results and provides\na sensitive test for theoretical extensions of the standard model.\n", "  Experiments on pion (Goldstone Boson) photoproduction from the nucleon tests\nthe ability to make QCD predictions at confinement scale energies. Experiments\nwith both polarized beams and targets have the potential sensitivity to\ndemonstrate the dynamic isospin breaking effects of the up and down quark mass\ndifference, whereas experiments on Compton scattering from the nucleon will\nincisively probe its chiral structure by measuring all of the spin dependent\namplitudes. These and other types of photo-induced measurements on nuclei could\nbe possible at BLAST with the addition of an almost-real photon tagging system\nand a forward low energy recoil ion hodoscope.\n", "  The study of spherical-deformed ground--state phase transitions in finite\nnuclei as a function of N and Z is hindered by the discrete values of the\nnucleon number. A resolution of the integer nucleon number problem, and\nevidence relating to phase transitions in finite nuclei, are discussed from the\nexperimental point of view and interpreted within the framework of the\ninteracting boson model.\n", "  Using a microscopic antikaon-nucleus optical potential recently developed by\nRamos and Oset (nucl-th/9906016, in print in Nuclear Physics A) from a chiral\nmodel, we calculate strong interaction shifts and widths for $K^-$ atoms. This\npurely theoretical potential gives an acceptable description of the measured\ndata ($\\chi^2/{\\rm num.data}= 3.8$), though it turns out to be less attractive\nthan what can be inferred from the existing kaon atomic data. We also use a\nmodified potential, obtained by adding to the latter theoretical one a s-wave\nterm which is fitted to known experimental kaonic data ($\\chi^2/{\\rm degree of\nfreedom}= 1.6$), to predict deeply bound $K^-$ atomic levels, not detected yet.\nThis improved potential predicts, in general, states even narrower than those\nrecently reported by Friedman and Gal. (Phys.Let.B459, 1999, 43). This\nreinforces the idea that these deeply atomic states can be detected and\nresolved by using suitable nuclear reactions. Besides, we also study $K^-$ and\n$\\bar K^0$ nuclear bound states and compute binding energies and widths, for\nboth species of antikaons, in $^{12}$C, $^{40}$Ca and $^{208}$Pb. Despite of\nrestricting our study only to potentials obtained from best fits to the known\nkaonic atom data, the dynamics of these nuclear bound states depend\ndramatically on the particular optical potential used.\n", "  The effective chiral theory of the in-medium NN interactions is considered.\n  The shallow bound states, which complicate the effective field theory\nanalysis in vacuum do not exist in matter. We show that the next-to-leading\norder terms in the chiral expansion of the effective Lagrangian can be\ninterpreted as corrections so that the expansion is systematic. The Low Energy\nEffective Constants of this Lagrangian are found to satisfy the concept of\nnaturalness. The potential energy per particle is calculated. The problems and\nchallenges in constructing the chiral theory of nuclear matter are outlined.\n", "  We discuss how dilepton production is related to chiral symmetry and its\nrestoration. We then analyse presently available data by the CERES\ncollaboration in this context. We find that the present data do not support any\nconclusions concerning the restoration of chiral symmetry. We finally provide a\nprediction for the dilepton spectrum for the just completed low energy (40 GeV)\nrun at the SPS.\n", "  Using a collective potential derived on the basis of the Generator Coordinate\nMethod with Skyrme interactions we obtain values for the compression modulus of\n40Ca which are in good agreement with a recently obtained experimental value.\nCalculated values for the compression modulus for 16O are also given. The\nprocedure involved in the derivation of the collective potential is briefly\nreviewed and discussed.\n", "  We describe the properties of quark matter at zero temperature and finite\nbaryon densities within microscopic Vlasov/molecular dynamics approaches. We\nuse an inter-quark Richardson's potential consistent with the indications of\nLattice QCD calculations. The color degrees of freedom are explicitly taken\ninto account.\n  We explicitly demonstrate that the Vlasov approach alone is insufficient in\nthe hadronization region. In order to overcome this problem we prepare the\ninitial condition for many events using molecular dynamics with frictional\ncooling and a Thomas-Fermi approximation to the Fermi motion.\n  These events are averaged and propagated in time using the Vlasov approach.\n  We find some evidence for a second order phase transition from nuclear to\nquark matter at high baryon densities. An order parameter suitable to describe\nthe phase transition is discussed. At low densities the quark condensate into\napproximately color white clusters (nucleon).\n", "  The method of lowest-order constrained variational, which predicts reasonably\nthe nuclear matter semi-empirical data is used to calculate the equation of\nstate of beta-stable matter at finite temperature. The Reid soft-core with and\nwithout the N-$\\Delta$ interactions which fits the N-N scattering data as well\nas the $UV_{14}$ potential plus the three-nucleon interaction are considered in\nthe nuclear many-body Hamiltonian. The electron and muon are treated\nrelativistically in the total Hamiltonian at given temperature, to make the\nfluid electrically neutral and stable against beta decay. The calculation is\nperformed for a wide range of baryon density and temperature which are of\ninterest in the astrophysics. The free energy, entropy, proton abundance, etc.\nof nuclear beta-stable matter are calculated.\n  It is shown that by increasing the temperature, the maximum proton abundance\nis pushed to the lower density while the maximum itself increases as we\nincrease the temperature. The proton fraction is not enough to see any\ngas-liquid phase transition. Finally we get an overall agreement with other\nmany-body techniques, which are available only at zero temperature.\n", "  The reaction $\\gamma+p\\to\\gamma'+p+\\pi^0$ has been suggested as a means to\ndeduce the $\\Delta^+$ magnetic moment. The cross section for this process is\nestimated in both the constituent quark model and an effective Lagrangian\nprocedure. The resulting total cross section is of the order 5-10 nb, which is\nat the limit of present experimental capabilities.\n", "  A dynamical model based on effective Lagrangians is proposed to describe the\nbremsstrahlung reaction $ \\pi N \\to \\pi N \\gamma$ at low energies. The\n$\\Delta(1232)$ degrees of freedom are incorporated in a way consistent with\nboth, electromagnetic gauge invariance and invariance under contact\ntransformations. The model also includes the initial and final state\nrescattering of hadrons via a T-matrix with off the momentum-shell effects. The\ndouble differential distribution of photons is computed for three different\nT-matrix models and the results are compared with the soft photon\napproximation, and with experimental data. The aim of this analysis is to test\nthe off-shell behaviour of the different T-matrices under consideration.\nFinally an alternative simpler dynamical model that incorporates the unstable\ncharacter of the isobar-$\\Delta(1232)$ through a complex mass, is presented. As\nwe will see it is suitable for the study of the magnetic moment of the\nresonance.\n", "  We study the competition between induced symmetry breaking (ISB),\n  Cooper pairing (superconductivity) and chiral condensation at finite\nnon-asymptotic density. Using a quantum mechanical model studied recently by\nIlieva and Thirring, we analyze the expectation value of the fermion number\ndensity $\\la a^*a\\ra$ in the presence of chemical potential and discuss\nrelevance of the ISB phenomenon in the model. By Bogoliubov transformation, we\nobtain the ground state energy and find that a phase with both superconducting\nand mean field gap is a true ground state. We also study the effective\npotentials of a two-dimensional field theory model for competitions between\n$\\la\\bar\\psi\\psi\\ra$, $\\la\\psi\\psi\\ra$ and $\\la\\psi^\\dagger\\psi\\ra$. We find\nthat in the regime $\\mu <\\mu_c$, where $\\mu_c$ is found to be around $0.4 m_F$\nwith $m_F$ being the renormalizaton point of chiral condensate, we have a\nchiral symmetry-breaking phase with almost zero fermion number density and in\nthe case of $\\mu >\\mu_c$ the system sits in the mixed phase characterized by\n  $\\la \\psi^\\dagger\\psi\\ra\\neq 0$ and $\\la \\psi\\psi\\ra\\neq 0$ as long as the\nrenormalization point, $M_0$, corresponding to a superconducting gap is not\nzero, $M_0\\neq 0$.\n", "  The differential cross sections and analyzing powers from the elastic\nscattering of 25 and 40 MeV protons from many nuclei have been studied.\nAnalyses have been made using a fully microscopic model of proton-nucleus\nscattering seeking to establish a means appropriate for use in analyses of\nradioactive beam scattering from hydrogen with ion energies 25A and 40A MeV.\n", "  We study the effect of a direct Giant Dipole Resonance ($GDR$) excitation in\nintermediate dinuclear systems with exotic shape and charge distributions\nformed in charge asymmetric fusion entrance channels. A related enhancement of\nthe $GDR$ gamma yield in the evaporation cascade of the fused nucleus is\nexpected. The dynamical origin of such $GDR$ extra strength will show up in a\ncharacteristic anisotropy of the dipole gamma-emission. A fully microscopic\nanalysis of the fusion dynamics is performed with quantitative predictions of\nthe $GDR$ photon yield based on a dynamics- statistics coupling model. In\nparticular we focus our attention on the energy and mass dependence of the\neffect.\n  We suggest a series of new experiments, in particular some optimal entrance\nchannel conditions. We stress the importance of using the new available\nradioactive beams.\n", "  A systematic expansion in opacity, $L/\\lambda$, is used to clarify the\nnon-linear behavior of induced gluon radiation in quark-gluon plasmas. The\ninclusive differential gluon distribution is calculated up to second order in\nopacity and compared to the zeroth order (factorization) limit. The opacity\nexpansion makes it possible to take finite kinematic constraints into account\nthat suppress jet quenching in nuclear collisions below RHIC ($\\sqrt{s}=200$\nAGeV) energies.\n", "  Rotational bands of $^{252, 253, 254}$No and the fission barriers of\n$^{254}$No at spin 0$\\hbar$ and 20$\\hbar$ are calculated with the\nHartree-Fock-Bogolyubov theory and the Lipkin-Nogami approximate particle\nnumber projection. The SLy4 Skyrme force is used in the particle-hole channel.\nA zero-range force with and without density-dependence is used in the\nparticle-particle channel. The experimental ground state deformation\n(${\\cal{Q}}_{20}$ = 32.8 b) is reproduced as well as the increase of the\ndynamical moment of inertia with frequency both for $^{252}$No and $^{254}$No.\n  The rotational band of $^{253}$No is also calculated. Fission barriers of\n$^{254}$No at spin 0$\\hbar$ and 20$\\hbar$ show the robustness of\nshell-corrections against rotation in these heavy nuclei.\n", "  Recent heavy ion experiments indicate modifications of the $\\rho-$meson mass\nin medium. In the CERES experiments $\\rho-$mesons are produced at $\\sim$ normal\nnuclear matter density, where hadrons are more appropriate constituents than\nquarks. A collective \"nuclear $\\rho$\", in which every nucleon is excited to the\nN(1520) state, with equal amplitude, enters in this description. At the higher\ndensities reached by future experiments constituent quarks become the\nappropriate variables. Here the $\\rho$ and $\\omega$ transition couplings to the\nnucleon resonances up to 1700 MeV, including the N(1520), are derived by means\nof the chiral quark model. The relevant coupling constants are expressed in\nterms of the corresponding vector coupling constants to nucleons. The quality\nof the model relations is tested by a calculation of the corresponding\npion-resonance coupling constants, which are known from the empirical pion\ndecay widths.\n", "  A proposal is made for reducing the solution of the N-particle\nLippmann-Schwinger equation to that of smaller sets of particles. This consists\nof first writing the N-particle equation in terms of all possible\n$N/2$-particle Lippmann-Schwinger equations. (If N is odd this needs a minor\nmodification.) The second step requires a decoupling of the resolvents for the\nfewer particle systems so that each can be solved separately. This\ngeneralization of the Faddeev approach deals only with connected kernels and\nthe homogeneous solution reproduces the N-particle Schr\\\"odinger equation. For\nfour particles the proposed method involves only a $3\\times3$ matrix whereas\nother approaches typically require the solution of at least a $7\\times7$ matrix\nequation.\n", "  A fully relativistic model for the description of exclusive (e,e'p) reactions\noff nuclear targets at high energies and momentum transfers is outlined. It is\nbased on the eikonal approximation for the ejectile scattering wave function\nand a relativistic mean-field approximation to the Walecka model. Results for\n^{12}C(e,e'p) and ^{16}O(e,e'p) differential cross sections and separated\nstructure functions are presented for four-momenta in the range 0.8 \\leq Q^{2}\n\\leq 20 (GeV/c)^{2}. The regions of applicability of the eikonal approximation\nare studied and observed to be confined to proton knockout in a relatively\nsmall cone about the momentum transfer. A simple criterium defining the\nboundaries of this cone is determined. The Q^2 dependence of the effect of\noff-shell ambiguities on the different (e,e'p) structure functions is\naddressed. At sufficiently high values of Q^2 their impact on the cross\nsections is illustrated to become practically negligible. It is pointed out\nthat for the whole range of Q^2 values studied here, the bulk of the\nrelativistic effects arising from the coupling between the lower components in\nthe wave functions, is manifesting itself in the longitudinal-transverse\ninterference term.\n", "  Recent experimental studies of the antiproton-deuteron system at low energies\nhave shown that the imaginary part of the antiproton-deuteron scattering length\nis smaller than the antiproton-proton one. Two- and three-body systems with\nstrong annihilation are investigated and a mechanism explaining this unexpected\nrelation between the imaginary parts of the scattering lengths is proposed.\n", "  Employing NEXUS, one of the most recent simulation programs for heavy ions\ncollisions, we investigate in detail the Hanbury-Twiss correlation function for\ncharged pions for reactions 158 GeV Pb+Pb. For this study we supplement the\nstandard simulation program by electromagnetic interactions. We find that the\nstring fragmentation introduces strong space-momentum correlations and the\nfreeze out times of the correlated pairs have a wide distribution. Both has a\nstrong influence on the apparent source radius determined from the measured\ncorrelation correlation function.An equally strong influence is observed for\nthe final state electromagnetic interaction.\n", "  The extended pairing plus $QQ$ interaction with the $J$-independent isoscalar\nproton-neutron force as an average monopole field, which has succeeded in\ndescribing collective yrast states of $N \\approx Z$ even-$A$ nuclei, is\nimproved.\n  The improvement is accomplished by adding small monopole terms\n  (relevant to spectroscopy) to the average monopole field\n  (indispensable to the binding energy). This modification extends the\napplicability of the interaction to nuclei with $N \\approx 28$ such as\n$^{48}$Ca, and moreover improves energy levels of noncollective states.\n  The modified interaction successfully describes not only even-$A$ but also\nodd-$A$ nuclei in the $f_{7/2}$ shell region.\n  Results of exact shell model calculations in the model space\n  ($f_{7/2}$, $p_{3/2}$, $p_{1/2}$) (its usefulness has been demonstrated\npreviously) are shown for $A$=47, 48, 49, 50 and 51 nuclei.\n", "  The pion production by sigma decay and its relation with chiral symmetry\nrestoration in a hot and dense matter are investigated in the framework of the\nNambu-Jona-Lasinio model. The decay rate for the process sigma -> 2pion to the\nlowest order in a 1/N_c expansion is calculated as a function of temperature T\nand chemical potential mu. The thermal and nonthermal enhancements of pions\ngenerated by the decay before and after the freeze-out present only in the\ncrossover region of the chiral symmetry transition. The strongest nonthermal\nenhancement is located in the vicinity of the endpoint of the first-order\ntransition.\n", "  Producing rare isotopes through statistical multifragmentation is\ninvestigated using the Mekjian method for exact solutions of the canonical\nensemble. Both the initial fragmentation and the the sequential decay are\nmodeled in such a way as to avoid Monte Carlo and thus provide yields for\narbitrarily scarce fragments. The importance of sequential decay, exact\nparticle-number conservation and the sensitivities to parameters such as\ndensity and temperature are explored. Recent measurements of isotope ratios\nfrom the fragmentation of different Sn isotopes are interpreted within this\npicture.\n", "  Final state hyperon-nucleon interaction in strangeness photoproduction of the\ndeuteron is investigated making use of the covariant reaction formalism and the\nP-matrix approach to the YN system. Remarkably simple analytical expression for\nthe amplitude is obtained. Pronounced effects due to final state interaction\nare predicted including the manifestation of the 2.13 GeV resonance.\n", "  We propose a method to introduce Fock term contributions in relativistic\nmodels of fermions coupled to mesons, including self-interactions for the\nmesonic fields. We show that effects on equilibrium properties and on the\ndynamical response of the fermionic system can be consistently accounted for.\nSome implications on equilibrium properties of asymmetric nuclear matter are\ndiscussed.\n", "  The finite duration of collisions appear as time-nonlocality in the kinetic\nequation. Analyzing the corresponding quantum kinetic equation for dense\ninteracting Fermi systems a delay differential equation is obtained which\ncombines time derivatives with finite time stepping known from the logistic\nmapping. The responsible delay time is explicitly calculated and discussed. As\na novel feature oscillations in the time evolution of the distribution function\nitself appear and bifurcations up to chaotic behavior can occur. The\ntemperature and density conditions are presented where such oscillations and\nbifurcations arise indicating an onset of phase transition.\n", "  The non-local scattering-in and -out integrals of the Enskog equation have\nreversed displacements of colliding particles reflecting that the -in and -out\nprocesses are conjugated by the space and time inversions. Generalisations of\nthe Enskog equation to Fermi liquid systems are hindered by a request of the\nparticle-hole symmetry which contradicts the reversed displacements. We resolve\nthis problem with the help of the optical theorem. It is found that space-time\nand particle-hole symmetry can only be fulfilled simultaneously for the\nBruckner-type of internal Pauli-blocking while the Feynman-Galitskii form\nallows only for particle-hole symmetry but not for space-time symmetry due to a\nstimulated emission of Bosons.\n", "  Recent developments on medium modifications of hadron properties in dense and\nhot hadronic matter are discussed. I will focus in particular on the behavior\nof spectral functions associated to collective scalar-isoscalar modes, kaons\nand vector mesons from ordinary nuclear matter to highly excited matter\nproduced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions from SIS to SPS energies. Various\ntheoretical approaches are presented in connection with the interpretation of\nexperimental data. Special emphasis will be put on the role of chiral dynamics\nand chiral symmetry restoration. I will discuss in particular to which extent\nthe broadening of the rho meson peak signals the onset of chiral symmetry\nrestoration.\n", "  We assess the combined effect of ground-state correlations, meson-exchange\nand isobar currents upon the cross sections for quasielastic (e,e'p) reactions\nfrom nuclei. Four-momenta in the range 0.1 \\leq Q^2 \\leq 1 GeV^2 are addressed.\nWe observe that for $Q^2$ values exceeding 0.2 GeV^2, quasielastic conditions\nand missing momenta below the Fermi momentum, the ground-state correlations and\ntwo-body currents do not dramatically alter the $(e,e'p)$ predictions as they\nare obtained in the impulse approximation. Moreover, deviations from the\nimpulse approximation exhibit a rather modest Q^2 dependence.\n", "  We study two-particle systems in a model quantum field theory, in which\nscalar particles and spinor particles interact via a mediating scalar field.\nThe Lagrangian of the model is reformulated by using covariant Green's\nfunctions to solve for the mediating field in terms of the particle fields.\nThis results in a Hamiltonian in which the mediating-field propagator appears\ndirectly in the interaction term. It is shown that exact two-particle\neigenstates of the Hamiltonian can be determined. The resulting relativistic\nfermion-boson equation is shown to have Dirac and Klein-Gordon one-particle\nlimits. Analytic solutions for the bound state energy spectrum are obtained for\nthe case of massless mediating fields.\n", "  The excitation spectrum of the nucleon with the spin 1/2 is examined by using\nthe Friedberg-Lee model containing the constituent quark and the scalar meson.\n  An appropriate way of quantization for the non-linear meson field is employed\nby taking account of the non-topological soliton existed in the classical\nlevel.\n  Our model space for the nucleon resonances includes the three-quark plus\none-meson state in addition to the pure three-quark state.\n  The excitation spectrum in this model space shows that the positive parity\nstate appears as the first excited state associated with the 0s-excitation of\nthe scalar meson.\n  The meson excitation also generates the additional negative parity state\napart from the well-known 0p-excitation of the quark.\n", "  Finding the eigenstates of the total Hamiltonian H or its diagonalization is\nthe important problem of quantum physics. However, in relativistic quantum\nfield theory (RQFT) its complete and exact solution is possible for a few\nsimple models only. Unitary transformations (UT's) considered in this survey do\nnot diagonalize H, but convert H into a form which enables us to find\napproximately some H eigenstates. During the last years there have appeared\nmany papers devoted to physical applications of such UT's. Our aim is to\npresent a systematic and self-sufficient exposition of the UT method. The two\ngeneral kinds of UT's are pointed out, distinct variations of each kind being\npossible. We consider in detail the problem of finding the simplest H\neigenstates for interacting mesons and nucleons using the so-called\n``clothing'' UT and Okubo's UT. These UT's allow us to suggest definite\napproaches to the problem of two-particle (deuteron-like) bound states in RQFT.\nThe approaches are shown to yield the same two-nucleon quasipotentials in the\nfirst nonvanishing approximation. We demonstrate how the particle mass\nrenormalization can be fulfilled in the framework of the ``clothing''\nprocedure. Besides the UT of the Hamiltonian we discuss the accompanying UT of\nthe Lorentz boost generators.\n", "  The features of the emissions of light particles ($LP$), charged particles\n($CP$), intermediate mass fragments ($IMF$) and the largest fragment ($MAX$)\nare investigated for $^{129}Xe$ as functions of temperature and \"freeze-out\"\ndensity in the frameworks of isospin dependent lattice gas model and classical\nmolecular dynamics model. Definite turning points for the slopes of average\nmultiplicity of $LP$, CP and $IMF$, and of the mean mass of the largest\nfragment ($A_{max}$) are shown around a liquid gas phase transition temperature\nand while the largest variances of the distributions of $LP$, $CP$, $IMF$, and\n$MAX$ appear there. It indicates that the cluster emission rate can be taken as\na probe of nuclear liquid gas phase transition and while the largest\nfluctuation is simultaneously accompanied at the point of the phase transition\nwithin lattice gas model and molecular dynamics model as the traditional\nthermodynamical theory requires when a phase transition occurs.\n", "  We discuss the physics underlying event-by-event fluctuations in relativistic\nheavy ion collisions. We will emphasize how the fluctuations of particle ratios\ncan be utilized to explore the properties of the matter created in these\ncollisions. In particular, we will argue that the fluctutions of the ratio of\npositively over negatively charged particles may serve as a unique signature\nfor the Quark Gluon Plasma.\n", "  The M1 transitions between low-lying T=1 and T=0 states in deformed odd-odd\nN=Z nuclei are analyzed in the frames of the rotor-plus-particle model. Using\nthe representation of an explicit coupling of angular momenta we show that\nstrong coupling of the quasideuteron configurations to the axially deformed\ncore results in a distribution of the total 0+ --> 1+ strength among a few\nlow-lying 1+ states. Simple analytical formulae for B(M1) values are derived.\nThe realization of the M1 sum rule for the low-lying 1+,T=0 states is\nindicated. The calculated B(M1) values are found to be in good agreement with\nexperimental data and reveal specific features of collectivity in odd-odd N=Z\nnuclei.\n", "  The properties of strange hadronic matter are studied in the context of the\nmodified quark-meson coupling model using two substantially different sets of\nhyperon-hyperon ($YY$) interactions. The first set is based on the Nijmegen\nhard core potential model D with slightly attractive $YY$ interactions. The\nsecond potential set is based on the recent SU(3) extension of the Nijmegen\nsoft-core potential NSC97 with strongly attractive $YY$ interactions which may\nallow for deeply bound hypernuclear matter. The results show that, for the\nfirst potential set, the $\\Sigma$ hyperon does not appear at all in the bulk at\nany baryon density and for all strangeness fractions. The binding energy curves\nof the resulting $N\\Lambda\\Xi$ system vary smoothly with density and the system\nis stable (or metastable if we include the weak force). However, the situation\nis drastically changed when using the second set where the $\\Sigma$ hyperons\nappear in the system at large baryon densities above a critical strangeness\nfraction. We find strange hadronic matter undergoes a first order phase\ntransition from a $N\\Lambda\\Xi$ system to a $N\\Sigma\\Xi$ for strangeness\nfractions $f_S>1.2$ and baryonic densities exceeding twice ordinary nuclear\nmatter density. Furthermore, it is found that the system built of $N\\Sigma\\Xi$\nis deeply bound. This phase transition affects significantly the equation of\nstate which becomes much softer and a substantial drop in energy density and\npressure are detected as the phase transition takes place.\n", "  Retardation effects from quark confinement on low-energy nucleon dynamics are\ninvestigated within the generalized quantum dynamics (GQD). It is shown that\nthe GQD provides an extension of Hamiltonian dynamics which can describe the\nevolution of systems of hadrons whose interaction is nonlocal in time due to\nquark-gluon retardation effects. This is illustrated by the example of the\ndynamics of nucleons with internal structure described by a constitute quark\nmodel. It is shown that quark-gluon retardation effects result in an anomalous\noff-shell behavior of the two-nucleon amplitudes, and in a lack of continuity\nof the evolution operator describing nucleon dynamics; for this reason\nlow-energy nucleon dynamics is not governed by the Schr{\\\"o}dinger equation.\nThis is shown to have substantial effects on the dynamics of many nucleon\nsystems. It is also shown that the GQD allows one to take into account\nretardation effects from quark confinement in describing the short-range part\nof the $NN$ interaction.\n  PACS number(s): 24.85.+p, 13.75.Cs, 21.30.-x\n", "  An unfactorized and relativistic framework for calculating A(e,e'p)\nobservables at typical JLAB energies is presented. Results of (e,e'p) model\ncalculations for the target nuclei ^{12}C and ^{16}O are presented and compared\nto data from SLAC and JLAB.\n", "  Nucleon recoil polarization in electromagnetic reactions with two-nucleon\nemission is discussed for both (${\\vec e},e'{\\vec N}N$) and\n  (${\\vec \\gamma},{\\vec N}N$). Numerical results are given for exclusive\ntwo-nucleon knockout reactions from $^{16}$O in a theoretical model where\nfinal-state interactions, one-body and two-body currents, and the effect of\ncorrelations in the initial pair wave function are included.\n", "  The isoscalar toroidal dipole strength distributions in spherical nuclei are\ncalculated in the framework of a fully consistent relativistic random phase\napproximation. It is suggested that the recently observed \"low-lying component\nof the isoscalar dipole mode\" might in fact correspond to the toroidal giant\ndipole resonance. Although predicted by several theoretical models, the\nexistence of toroidal resonances has not yet been confirmed in experiment. The\nstrong mixing between the toroidal resonance and the dipole compression mode\nmight help to explain the large discrepancy between theory and experiment on\nthe position of isoscalar giant dipole resonances.\n", "  The importance of studying matter at high $\\rho$ increases as more\nastrophysical data becomes available from recently launched spacecrafts. The\nimportance of high T studies derives from heavy ion data. In this paper we set\nup a formalism to study the nucleons and isobars with long and short range\npotentials non-pertubatively, bosonizing and expanding semi-classically the\nFeyman integrals up to one loop. We address the low density, finite T\nproblem=A0 first, the case relevant to heavy ion collisions, hoping to adresss\nthe high density case later. Interactions change the nucleon and isobar numbers\nat different $\\rho$ and T non-trivially.\n", "  The triaxial deformation in $^{10}$Be is investigated using a microscopic\n$\\alpha+\\alpha+n+n$ model. The states of two valence neutrons are classified\nbased on the molecular-orbit (MO) model, and the $\\pi$-orbit is introduced\nabout the axis connecting the two $\\alpha$-clusters for the description of the\nrotational bands. There appear two rotational bands comprised mainly of $K^\\pi\n= 0^+$ and $K^\\pi = 2^+$, respectively, at low excitation energy, where the two\nvalence neutrons occupy $K^\\pi = 3/2^-$ or $K^\\pi = 1/2^-$ orbits. The\ntriaxiality and the $K$-mixing are discussed in connection to the molecular\nstructure, particularly, to the spin-orbit splitting. The extent of the\ntriaxial deformation is evaluated in terms of the electro-magnetic transition\nmatrix elements (Davydov-Filippov model, Q-invariant model), and density\ndistribution in the intrinsic frame. The obtained values turned out to be\n$\\gamma = 15^o \\sim 20^o$.\n", "  We have studied equilibration with respect to isospin degree of freedom in\nfour 96 mass systems $^{96}Ru+^{96}Ru$, $^{96}Ru+^{96}Zr$,\n  $^{96}Zr+^{96}Ru$, $^{96}Zr+^{96}Zr$ at 100 AMeV and 400 AMeV with isospin\ndependent QMD.\n  We propose that the neutron-proton differential rapidity distribution is a\nsensitive probe to the degree of equilibration with respect to the isospin\ndegree of freedom. By analyzing the average $N/Z$ ratio of emitted nucleons,\nlight charged particles (LCP) and intermediate mass fragments (IMF), it is\nfound that there exist memory effect in multifragmentation process. The average\n$N/Z$ ratio of IMF reduces largely as beam energy increases from 100 AMeV to\n400 AMeV which may result from the change of the behavior of the isotope\ndistribution of IMF charges. The isotope distribution of IMF charges does also\nshow certain memory effect at 100 AMeV case but not at 400 AMeV case.\n", "  We study one-particle spectra and a two-particle correlation function in the\n  130 GeV/nucleon Au+Au collisions at RHIC by making use of a hydrodynamical\nmodel. We calculate the one-particle hadronic spectra and present the first\nanalysis of Bose-Einstein correlation functions based on the numerical solution\nof the hydrodynamical equations which takes both longitudinal and transverse\nexpansion into account appropriately. The hydrodynamical model provides\nexcellent agreement with the experimental data in the pseudorapidity and the\ntransverse momentum spectra of charged hadrons, the rapidity dependence of\nanti-proton to proton ratio, and almost consistent result for the pion\nBose-Einstein correlation functions. Our numerical solution with simple\nfreeze-out picture suggests the formation of the quark-gluon plasma with large\nvolume and low net-baryon density.\n", "  Coherent Compton scattering on light nuclei in the delta resonance region is\nstudied in the impulse approximation and is shown to be a sensitive probe of\nthe in-medium properties of the delta resonance. The elementary amplitude on a\nsingle nucleon is calculated from the unitary K-matrix approach developed\npreviously. Modifications of the properties of the delta resonance due to the\nnuclear medium are accounted for through the self-energy operator of the delta,\ncalculated from the one-pion loop. The dominant medium effects such as the\nPauli blocking, mean-field modification of the nucleon and delta masses, and\nparticle-hole excitations in the pion propagator are consistently included in\nnuclear matter.\n", "  The two nucleon emission process off ^3He induced by medium energy electrons\nhas been theoretically analyzed using realistic three-nucleon wave functions\nand taking the final state interaction into account.\n  Various kinematical conditions have been considered in order to clarify the\nquestion whether the effects of the final state interaction could be minimized\nby a proper choice of the kinematics.\n", "  The use of statistical fluctuations as probes of the microscopic dynamics of\nhot and dense hadronic matter is reviewed. Critical fluctuations near the\ncritical point of QCD matter are predicted to enhance fluctuations in pionic\nobservables. Chemical fluctuations, especially those of locally conserved\nquantum numbers, such as electric charge and baryon number, can probe the\nnature of the carriers of these quantum numbers in the dense medium.\n", "  We investigate properties of the symmetry term in the equation-of-state (EOS)\nof nuclear matter (NM) from the analysis of simulations of fragmentation events\nin intermediate energy heavy ion collisions.\n  For charge asymmetric systems a qualitative new feature in the liquid-gas\nphase transition is predicted: the onset of chemical instabilities with a\nmixture of isoscalar and isovector components. This leads to a separation into\na higher density (``liquid'') symmetric and a low density (``gas'')\nneutron-rich phase, the so-called neutron distillation effect. We analyse the\nsimulations with respect to the time evolution of the isospin dynamics, as well\nas with respect to the distribution and asymmetry of the final primary\nfragments. Qualitatively different effects arise in central collisions, with\nbulk fragmentation, and peripheral collisions with neck-fragmentation. The neck\nfragments produced in this type of process appear systematically more\nneutron-rich from a dynamical nucleon migration effect which is very sensitive\nto the symmetry term in regions just below normal density. In general the\nisospin dynamics plays an important role in all the steps of the reaction, from\nprompt nucleon emission to the sequential decay of the primary fragments. A\nfully microscopic description of the reaction dynamics including stochastic\nelements to treat fluctuations realistically is absolutely necessary in order\nto extract precise information on the fragmentation and the nuclear equation of\nstate. We have performed simulations for fragment production events in $n$-rich\n($^{124}Sn$) and $n$-poor ($^{112}Sn$) symmetric colliding systems.\n", "  The constituent quark model based on a hypercentral approach takes into\naccount three-body force effects and standard two-body potential contributions.\nThe quark potential contains a hypercentral interaction, to which a hyperfine\nterm is added. While the hypercentral potential supplies good values for the\ncentroid energies of the resonance multiplets and a realistic set of quark wave\nfunctions, the hyperfine splittings are sometimes not sufficient to account for\nthe observed masses.\n  In this work we have introduced an improved form of the hyperfine interaction\nand an isospin dependent quark potential. The resulting description of the\nbaryon spectrum is very good, also for the Roper resonance, specially thanks to\nthe flavour dependent interaction.\n", "  Various measures of charge fluctuations in heavy-ion collisions are\ndiscussed. Advantages of the Phi-measure are demonstrated and its relation to\nother fluctuation measures is established. To get the relation, Phi is\nexpressed through the moments of multiplicity distribution. We study how the\nmeasures act in the case of a `background' model which represents the classical\nhadron gas in equilibrium. The model assumes statistical particle production\nconstrained by charge conservation. It also takes into account both the effect\nof incomplete experimental apparatus acceptance and that of tracking\ninefficiency. The model is shown to approximately agree with the PHENIX and\npreliminary STAR data on the electric charge fluctuations. Finally,\n`background-free' measures are discussed.\n", "  The preliminary experimental data on $\\phi$ production in the reaction\nNi(1.93 AGeV) + Ni point to a puzzling high $\\phi$ yield which can not be\nreproduced with present transport codes. We survey the experimental situation\nand present prospects for dedicated measurements of the $\\phi$ multiplicities\nwith the $K^+ K^-$ and $e^+ e^-$ channels at HADES and FOPI.\n", "  Strangeness production in microscopic transport models for relativistic\nheavy-ion collisions from SIS to RHIC is reviewed: after a brief introduction\ninto elementary strangeness production processes, the main emphasis is put on\nstrangeness as indicator of the nuclear equation of state, the excitation\nfunction of the $K^+/\\pi^+$ ratio and strangeness as a deconfinement indicator.\n", "  We discuss the status of thermal model descriptions of particle ratios in\ncentral nucleus-nucleus collisions at ultra-relativistic energy. An alternative\nto the\n  ``Cleymans-Redlich'' interpretation of the freeze-out trajectory is given in\nterms of the total baryon density. Emphasis is placed on the relation between\nthe chemical equilibration parameters and the QCD phase boundary. Furthermore,\nwe trace the essential difference between thermal model analyses of data from\ncollisions between elementary particles and from heavy ion collisions as due to\na transition from local strangeness conservation to percolation of strangeness\nover large volumes, as occurs naturally in a deconfined medium.\n  We also discuss predictions of the thermal model for composite particle\nproduction.\n", "  A modified method for calculating the non-perturbative quark vacuum\ncondensates from the global color symmetry model is derived. Within this\napproach it is shown that the vacuum condensates are free of ultraviolet\ndivergence which is different from previous studies. As a special, the\ntwo-quark condensate and the mixed quark-gluon condensate are calculated. A\ncomparision with the results of the other nonperturbative QCD approaches is\ngiven.\n", "  Sequences of rotational resonances (rotational bands) and corresponding\nantiresonances are observed in ion collisions. In this paper we propose a\ndescription which combines collective and single-particle features of cluster\ncollisions. It is shown how rotational bands emerge in many-body dynamics, when\nthe degeneracies proper of the harmonic oscillator spectra are removed by\nadding interactions depending on the angular momentum. These interactions can\nbe properly introduced in connection with the exchange-forces and the\nantisymmetrization, and give rise to a class of non-local potentials whose\nspectral properties are analyzed in detail. In particular, we give a\nclassification of the singularities of the resolvent, which are associated with\nbound states and resonances. The latter are then studied using an appropriate\ntype of collective coordinates, and a hydrodynamical model of the trapping,\nresponsible for the resonances, is then proposed. Accordingly, we derive, from\nthe uncertainty principle, a spin-width of the unstable states which can be\nrelated to their angular lifetime.\n", "  Using an extended version of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model we build a simple\ndescription of the baryons as diquark-quark bound states. First, a description\nof the diquarks in a dense and hot medium is presented.\n  Then, we introduce the formalism for the baryons based on the Faddeev\nequation associated with the so-called `` static approximation'' which finally\ngives a Bethe-Salpeter equation in the diquarks-quarks channel. By identifying\nthe baryons with the bound states, we can obtain a description of their\nproperties. In particular, we obtain the right mass spectrum for the proton,\n$\\Lambda$, $\\Xi$, and $\\Sigma$ at T=0 and $\\mu=0$. We extend the formalism to\nfinite temperature and density to obtain a description of the mass change of\nthese baryons in the medium.\n", "  We derived analytic formulas of the effective S astrophysical S factor,S^eff\nfor a non-resonant reaction of charged particles using a Taylor expension of\nthe astrophysical S factor and a uniform approximation.The formulas will be\nable to generate generate more accurate approximation to S^eff than previous\nones.\n", "  The antikaon optical potential in hot and dense nuclear matter is studied\nwithin the framework of a coupled-channel self-consistent calculation taking,\nas bare meson-baryon interaction, the meson-exchange potential of the J\\\"ulich\ngroup. Typical conditions found in heavy-ion collisions at GSI are explored. As\nin the case of zero temperature, the angular momentum components larger than\nL=0 contribute significantly to the finite temperature antikaon optical\npotential at finite momentum. It is found that the particular treatment of the\nmedium effects has a strong influence on the behavior of the antikaon potential\nwith temperature. Our self-consistent model, in which antikaons and pions are\ndressed in the medium, gives a moderately temperature dependent antikaon\npotential which remains attractive at GSI temperatures, contrary to what one\nfinds if only nuclear Pauli blocking effects are included.\n", "  We study the perspectives of resonant and nonresonant charmed meson\nproduction in $\\bar{p} + A$ reactions within the Multiple Scattering Monte\nCarlo (MSMC) approach. We calculate the production of the resonances\n$\\Psi(3770), \\Psi(4040)$ and $\\Psi(4160)$ on various nuclei, their propagation\nand decay to $D, \\bar{D}, D^*, \\bar{D}^*, D_s, \\bar{D}_s$ in the medium and\nvacuum, respectively. The modifications of the open charm vector mesons in the\nnuclear medium are found to be rather moderate or even small such that dilepton\nspectroscopy will require an invariant mass resolution of a few MeV.\nFurthermore, the elastic and inelastic interactions of the open charm mesons in\nthe medium are taken into account, which can be related to $(u,d)$-, $s$- or\n$c$-quark exchange with nucleons. It is found that by studying the $D/\\bar{D}$\nratio for low momenta in the laboratory ($\\leq 2-2.2$ GeV/c) as a function of\ntarget mass $A$ stringent constraints on the $c$-quark exchange cross section\ncan be obtained. On the other hand, the ratios\n  $D^-_s/D^+_s$ as well as $D/D^-_s$ and $D/D^+_s$ at low momenta as a function\nof $A$ will permit to fix independently the strength of the $s$-quark exchange\nreaction in $D^-_s N$ scattering.\n", "  Following recent work in which events which may correspond to a bound\ntetraneutron ($^4$n) were observed, it is pointed out that from the theoretical\nperspective the two-body nucleon-nucleon force cannot by itself bind four\nneutrons, even if it can bind a dineutron.\n  A very strong phenomenological four-nucleon (4N) force is needed in order to\nbind the tetraneutron. Such a 4N force, if it existed, would bind $^4$He by\nabout 100 MeV. Alternative experiments such as ($^8$He,$^4$n) are proposed to\nsearch for the tetraneutron.\n", "  We study the fluctuation properties of $\\Delta T=0$ electromagnetic\ntransition intensities and electromagnetic moments in $A \\sim 60$ nuclei within\nthe framework of the interacting shell model, using a realistic effective\ninteraction for\n  $pf$-shell nuclei with a $^{56}$Ni core. The distributions of the transition\nintensities and of the electromagnetic moments are well described by the\nGaussian orthogonal ensemble of random matrices. In particular, the transition\nintensity distributions follow a Porter-Thomas distribution. When diagonal\nmatrix elements (i.e., moments) are included in the analysis of transition\nintensities, we find that the distributions remain Porter-Thomas except for the\nisoscalar $M1$. The latter deviation is explained in terms of the structure of\nthe isoscalar $M1$ operator.\n", "  Working within an exactly solvable 3 level model, we discuss am extension of\nthe\n  Random Phase Approximation (RPA) based on a boson formalism. A boson\nHamiltonian is defined via a mapping procedure and its expansion truncated at\nfour-boson terms. RPA-type equations are then constructed and solved\niteratively. The new solutions gain in stability with respect to the RPA ones.\nWe perform diagonalizations of the boson Hamiltonian in spaces containing up to\nfour-phonon components. Approximate spectra exhibit an improved quality with\nincreasing the size of these multiphonon spaces. Special attention is addressed\nto the problem of the anharmonicity of the spectrum.\n", "  Quadrupole excitations of neutron-rich nuclei are analyzed by using the\nlinear response method in the Quasiparticle Random Phase Approximation (QRPA).\nThe QRPA response is derived starting from the time-dependent\nHartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) equations. The residual interaction between the\nquasiparticles is determined consistently from the two-body force used in the\nHFB equations, and the continuum coupling is treated exactly.\n  Calculations are done for the neutron-rich oxygen isotopes. It is found that\npairing correlations affect the low-lying states, and that a full treatment of\nthe continuum can change the structure of the states in the giant resonance\nregion.\n", "  We discuss the physics underlying event-by-event fluctuations in relativistic\nheavy ion collisions. We will argue that the fluctuations of the ratio of\npositively over negatively charged particles may serve as a unique signature\nfor the Quark Gluon Plasma.\n", "  A simple functional form has been found that gives a good representation of\nthe total reaction cross sections for the scattering of protons from (15)\nnuclei spanning the mass range ${}^{9}$Be to ${}^{238}$U and for proton\nenergies ranging from 20 to 300 MeV.\n", "  Nuclear liquid drop model is revisited and an explicit introduction of the\nsurface-curvature terms is presented. The corresponding parameters of the\nextended classical energy formula are adjusted to the contemporarily known\nnuclear binding energies and fission barrier heights. Using 2766 binding\nenergies of nuclei with $Z\\geq 8$ and $N\\geq 8$ it is shown that the\nperformance of the new approach is improved by a factor of about 6, compared to\nthe previously published liquid drop model results, in terms of both the masses\n(new r.m.s. deviation $<\\delta M> = 0.698$ MeV) and the fission barriers (new\nr.m.s. deviation of the fission barriers of isotopes with $Z> 70$ is $<\\delta\nV_B> = 0.88$ MeV).\n  The role of the curvature terms and their effects on the description of the\nexperimental quantities are discussed in detail; for comparison the parameters\nof the more 'traditional' approaches are re-fitted taking into account the\nnuclear masses known today and the performances of several variants of the\nmodel are compared. The isospin dependence in the new description of the\nbarriers is in a good agreement with the extended Thomas-Fermi approach; it\nalso demonstrates a good qualitative agreement with the fission life-time\nsystematics tested on the long chain of Fermium isotopes known experimentally.\n  The new approach offers also a very high stability in terms of the\nextrapolation from the narrower range of nuclides to a more extended one - a\nproperty of particular interest for the contemporary exotic beam projects: the\ncorresponding properties are illustrated and discussed.\n", "  The inverse scattering problem for the relativistic three-dimensional\nequation $\\Bigl(2E_{\\bf p'}-2E_{\\bf p}\\Bigr)<{\\bf p'}|\\Psi_{\\bf p}>= -\\int\nV(t)d^3{\\bf p''}<{\\bf p''}|\\Psi_{\\bf p}>$ with $E_{\\bf p}=\\sqrt{m^2+{\\bf p}^2}$\nand $t=\\Bigl(E_{\\bf p'}-E_{\\bf p''}\\Bigr)^2 -\\Bigl({\\bf p'}-{\\bf p''}\\Bigr)^2$\nis considered. The field-theoretical potential $V(t)$ of this equation is\nconstructed in the framework of the old perturbation theory. It contains all\ncontributions of diagrams with intermediate off-mass shell particles. In\nparticular, this potential reproduces the OBE Bonn model of the $NN$ potential\nexactly.For the $\\pi N$ scattering it is generated by $\\sigma,\\rho,\n\\omega$-meson exchange diagrams. The inverse scattering problem is solved by\nreduction of these relativistic equations to the standard Schr\\\"odinger\nequations $\\Bigl(\\Delta_{\\bf r}+{\\bf k}^2\\Bigr)<{\\bf r}|\\phi_{\\bf p}>= - v({\\bf\nr})<{\\bf r}|\\phi_{\\bf k}>$ with $E_{\\bf p}={\\bf k}^2/2m+m$. The relation\nbetween the relativistic potential $V(t)$ and its nonrelativistic\nrepresentation $v({\\bf r})$ is obtained.\n", "  We discuss a fully relativistic Landau Fermi liquid theory based on the\nQuantum Hadro-Dynamics ($QHD$) effective field picture of Nuclear Matter\n  ({\\it NM}).\n  From the linearized kinetic equations we get the dispersion relations of the\npropagating collective modes. We focus our attention on the dynamical effects\nof the interplay between scalar and vector channel contributions. A beautiful\n``mirror'' structure in the form of the dynamical response in the\nisoscalar/isovector degree of freedom is revealed, with a complete parallelism\nin the role respectively played by the compressibility and the symmetry energy.\nAll that strongly supports the introduction of an explicit coupling to the\nscalar-isovector channel of the nucleon-nucleon interaction. In particular we\nstudy the influence of this coupling (to a $\\delta$-meson-like effective field)\non the collective response of asymmetric nuclear matter ($ANM$). Interesting\ncontributions are found on the propagation of isovector-like modes at normal\ndensity and on an expected smooth transition to isoscalar-like oscillations at\nhigh baryon density. Important ``chemical'' effects on the neutron-proton\nstructure of the mode are shown. For dilute $ANM$ we have the isospin\ndistillation mechanism of the unstable isoscalar-like oscillations, while at\nhigh baryon density we predict an almost pure neutron wave structure of the\npropagating sounds.\n", "  We study certain physical observables of isoscalar heavy baryons using\npotential models based on hadronic degrees of freedom. The goal is to compare\nthese results with those from an effective theory obtained in a combined heavy\nquark and large $N_{c}$ expansion and thereby test the convergence of the\neffective theory. We study the excitation energy of $\\Lambda_{b}$ and\nsemileptonic decay form factors. The models tend to confirm the usefulness of\nthe effective theory for most observables.\n", "  Large scale Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) calculations with the finite-range\n  Gogny force D1S have been performed in order to extract the corresponding\ntheoretical average mass dependence of the nuclear gap values. Good agreement\nwith experimental data from the three-point filter\n  $\\Delta^{(3)}$(N) with N odd has been found for both the neutron and proton\ngaps. The study confirms earlier findings [W. Satula,\n  J. Dobaczewski, and W. Nazarewicz, Phys. Rev. Lett. 81 3599 (1998)] that the\nmass dependence of the gap is much weaker than the so far accepted 12/$\\sqrtA$\nMeV law.\n", "  The final state interaction in DIS of leptons off a nucleus A, due to the\npropagation of the struck nucleon debris and its hadronization in the nuclear\nenvironment is considered. The effective cross section of such a partonic\nsystem with the nucleons of the medium and its time dependence are estimated on\nthe basis of a model which takes into account the production of hadrons due to\nthe breaking of the color string and to gluon radiation. It is shown that the\ndetails of the propagation of the partonic system in the nuclear environment\ncan be thoroughly investigated by the semi-inclusive process A(e,e'(A-1))X, in\nwhich the scattered lepton is detected in coincidence with the nucleus (A-1) in\nlow energy and momentum states. The rescattering of the struck nucleon debris\nwith the medium damps and distorts the momentum distributions of (A-1) in a way\nwhich is very sensitive to the details of effective cross section of the\ndebris.\n  The total cross section of the process on ^4He, ^16O, and ^40Ca, related to\nthe probability that after a target nucleon experiences a DIS process, the\nrecoiling (A-1) nucleus remains intact, is evaluated, and the distorted\nmomentum distribution of the recoiling (A-1) system is obtained. It is shown\nthat both quantities are very sensitive to the details of the early stage of\nhadronization of the nucleon debris in the nuclear medium.\n", "  We present a unitary correlation operator that explicitly induces into shell\nmodel type many-body states short ranged two-body correlations caused by the\nstrong repulsive core and the pronounced tensor part of the nucleon-nucleon\ninteraction. Alternatively an effective Hamiltonian can be defined by applying\nthis unitary correlator to the realistic nucleon-nucleon interaction.\n  The momentum space representation shows that realistic interactions which\ndiffer in their short range behaviour are mapped on the same correlated\nHamiltonian, indicating a successful provision for the correlations at high\nmomenta. Calculations for He4 using the one- and two-body part of the\ncorrelated Hamiltonian compare favorably with exact many-body methods. For\nheavier nuclei like O16 and Ca40 where exact many-body calculations are not\npossible we compare our results with other approximations. The correlated\nsingle-particle momentum distributions describe the occupation of states above\nthe Fermi momentum. The Unitary Correlation Operator Method (UCOM) can be used\nin mean-field and shell model configuration spaces that are not able to\ndescribe these repulsive and tensor correlations explicitly.\n", "  Based on the quark coalescence model for the parton-to-hadron phase\ntransition in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions, we relate the elliptic\nflow ($v_2$) of high $\\pt$ hadrons to that of high $\\pt$ quarks. For high $\\pt$\nhadrons produced from an isospin symmetric and quark-antiquark symmetric\npartonic matter, magnitudes of their elliptic flows follow a flavor ordering as\n$(v_{2,\\pi}=v_{2,N}) > (v_{2,\\Lambda}=v_{2,\\Sigma})\n  > v_{2,K} > v_{2,\\Xi} > (v_{2,\\phi}=v_{2,\\Omega})$ if strange quarks have a\nsmaller elliptic flow than light quarks. The elliptic flows of high $\\pt$\nhadrons further follow a simple quark counting rule if strange quarks and light\nquarks have same high $\\pt$ spectrum and coalescence probability.\n", "  For coherent photoproduction of phi and omega mesons from deuteron at forward\nangles, the isovector pi-exchange amplitude is strongly suppressed.\n  We show a possibility to study the non-diffractive channels associated with\nthe unnatural parity exchange in phi-photoproduction and with the baryon\nresonance excitations in omega-photoproduction by measuring the spin\nobservables.\n", "  We analyse the one dimensional quartic oscillator using the effective\noperator methodology of Lee and Suzuki. We reproduce known results for low\nlying energy eigenvalues.\n", "  Effective field theory requires all observables to be independent of the\nrepresentation used for the quantum field operators. It means that off-shell\nproperties of the interactions should not lead to any observable effects. We\nanalyse this issue in the context of many-body approaches to nuclear matter,\nwhere it should be possible to shift the contributions of lowest order in\npurely off-shell two-body interactions into three-body forces. We show that\nnone of the commonly used truncations of the two-body scattering amplitude such\nas the ladder, Brueckner-Hartree-Fock or parquet approximations respect this\nrequirement.\n", "  We evaluate the two pion decay of the Roper resonance in a model where\nexplicit re-scattering of the two final pions is accounted for by the use of\nunitarized chiral perturbation theory. Our model does not include an explicit\n  $\\epsilon$ or $\\sigma$ scalar-isoscalar meson decay mode, instead it\ngenerates it dynamically by means of the pion re-scattering. The two ways,\nexplicit or dynamically generated, of introducing this decay channel have very\ndifferent amplitudes.\n  Nevertheless, through interference with the other terms of the model we are\nable to reproduce the same phenomenology as models with explicit consideration\nof the $\\epsilon$ meson.\n", "  The nonmesonic weak decay of $\\Lambda$ hypernuclei using nonrelativistic\nnuclear matter is studied. As the basic building block we use the Polarization\nPropagator Method developed by Oset and Salcedo.\n  It is shown that the exact calculation of exchange terms is required. Using\nthe Local Density Approximation we evaluate the nonmesonic decay width for\n$^{12}_{\\Lambda}C$ and compare the result with a finite nucleus calculation,\nobtaining a qualitative agreement.\n", "  The C12+C12 fusion cross sections show resonant behavior down to the lowest\nenergies accessible so far in the laboratory. If this tendency continues into\nthe astrophysical energy range, the stellar C12+C12 reaction rates have to be\ncorrected for resonant screening effects, in addition to the conventional\nscreening corrections. We estimate the resonant screening effects in the weak\nelectron screening limit for hydrostatic burning and white dwarf environments.\n", "  This contribution is an attempt to assess what can be learned from the\nremarkable success of the statistical model in describing ratios of particle\nabundances in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions.\n", "  The data from the first measurement, performed at ANKE/COSY, of the\nunpolarized cross section of the reaction $pd\\to (pp)n$ in the kinematics of\nbackward elastic $pd\\to dp$ scattering at proton-beam energies between 0.6 and\n1.9 GeV are analyzed in a phenomenological approach. The $pd\\to (pp)n$ data and\nthe triplet cross section of the reaction $pd\\to (pn)p$, calculated from the\n$pd\\to dp$ data on the basis of the F\\\"aldt-Wilkin extrapolation, are used here\nto derive the ratio $\\zeta$ of the singlet production matrix element squared to\nthe triplet one. This ratio, defined in our earlier analysis of $pd\\to (pn)p$\ndata in a largely model-independent way, depends on the dynamics of the $pd$\ninteraction. We find here\n  $\\zeta\\approx 0.02$ and show that the smallness of this value may point\ntoward softness of the deuteron at short NN distances.\n", "  We formulate a new power-counting scheme for a chiral effective field theory\nof nucleons, pions, and Deltas. This extends chiral perturbation theory into\nthe Delta-resonance region. We calculate nucleon Compton scattering up to\nnext-to-leading order in this theory. The resultant description of existing\n$\\gamma$p cross section data is very good for photon energies up to about 300\nMeV. We also find reasonable numbers for the spin-independent polarizabilities\n$\\alpha_p$ and $\\beta_p$.\n", "  A microscopic formalism is developed that includes the coupling to two\nparticle-hole phonons in the particle-hole propagator by extending the dressed\nrandom phase approximation (DRPA) equation for a finite system.\n  The resulting formalism is applied to study the low-lying excitation spectrum\nof 16O.\n  It is observed that the coupling to two-phonon states at low energy generates\nexcited states with quantum numbers that cannot be obtained in the DRPA\napproach.\n  Nevertheless, the two-phonon states mix weakly with particle-hole\nconfigurations and participate only partially in the formation of the\nlowest-lying positive-parity excited states.\n  The stability of the present calculation is tested vs. the truncation of\nmodel space. It is demonstrated that when single-particle strength\nfragmentation is properly considered, the present formalism exhibits\nconvergence with respect to the chosen model space within the confines of the\nchosen approximation scheme.\n", "  We investigate the influence of new Jefferson Lab polarization-transfer data,\nCx and Cz, and recoil polarization, Py, measurements in multipole fits to the\nsingle-pion photoproduction database. Results are compared to those found with\nthe addition of a double-polarization quantity associated with the Gerasimov-\nDrell-Hearn sum rule.\n", "  The norm kernel of the generator-coordinate method is shown to be a symmetric\nkernel of an integral equation with eigenfunctions defined in the\nFock--Bargmann space and forming a complete set of orthonormalized states\n(classified with the use of SU(3) symmetry indices) satisfying the Pauli\nexclusion principle. This interpretation allows to develop a method which, even\nin the presence of the SU(3) degeneracy, provides for a consistent way to\nintroduce additional quantum numbers for the classification of the basis\nstates. In order to set the asymptotic boundary conditions for the expansion\ncoefficients of a wave function in the SU(3) basis, a complementary basis of\nfunctions with partial angular momenta as good quantum numbers is needed. Norm\nkernels of the binary systems 6He+p, 6He+n, 6He+4He, and 8He+4He are considered\nin detail.\n", "  A schematic model is presented that allows one to study the behavior of\ninteracting pseudo-Fermi matter locked in a thermostatic box. As a function of\nthe box volume and temperature, the matter is seen to show all of the familiar\ncharactersitics of a Van der Waals gas, which include the coexistence of two\nphases under certain circumstances and the presence of a critical point.\n", "  We discuss recent developments concerning the in-medium properties of hadrons\nin dense and hot matter. The theoretical approaches are discussed in connection\nwith the interpretation of experimental data from intermediate energy machines\nup to relativistic heavy ion collisions. Special emphasis is put on chiral\nrestoration and its interplay with the substructure of the nucleon.\n", "  The equation of state of spin and isospin polarized nuclear matter is\ndetermined in the framework of the Brueckner theory including three-body\nforces. The Landau parameters in the spin and spin-isospin sectors are derived\nas a function of the baryonic density. The results are compared with the\nGamow-Teller collective modes. The relevance of $G_0$ and $G_0'$ for neutron\nstars is shortly discussed, including the magnetic susceptibility and the\nneutron star cooling.\n", "  A reggeized model for \\eta and \\eta' photoproduction on the nucleon is\npresented. In this model, t-channel vector meson exchanges are described in\nterms of Regge trajectories to comply with the correct high energy behavior. We\ncompare this reggeized model with an isobar model (\\eta-MAID), where the\nt-channel exchanges are described by \\rho and \\omega poles. Both models contain\nthe same resonance contributions, and describe current \\gamma p \\to \\eta p data\nup to E_\\gamma^{lab} = 2 GeV quite well, but only the reggeized model can be\nsuccessfully extended to higher energies. For the \\gamma p \\to \\eta' p\nreaction, the reggeized model is found to be able to give a satisfactory\ndescription. For the differential cross section data from SAPHIR, we find that\nthe observed linear forward rise in cos(theta) near E_\\gamma^{lab} = 1.6 GeV\ncan be well described by the interference of an S11 resonance and the Regge\ntrajectory exchanges without any need for an additional P-wave resonance.\n", "  The impact of the short-range $N\\Delta$ interaction on the pion\nphotoproduction processes off the deuteron in the $\\Delta$-resonance region is\nstudied in the framework of recently proposed dressed-bag model. A common\ndressing procedure for bare three- and six-quark states is used to describe\nboth the pion decay widths of baryon resonances and the effective $NN$ (or\n  $N\\Delta$) interaction at short ranges related to the inner dressed-bag\nstates. It is shown that the effect of short-range $N\\Delta$ interaction for\nthe forward-angle $\\pi^\\mathrm{o}$ photoproduction off the deuteron cannot be\nneglected. The prospects for further development of the model to describe the\nshort-range $NN$ (or $N\\Delta$) correlations in the lightest nuclei are\ndiscussed.\n", "  The coupling of single-particle motion and of vibrations in $^{11}_4$Be\nproduces dressed neutrons which spend only a fraction of the time in pure\nsingle-particle states, and which weighting differently from the bare neutrons,\nlead to parity inversion. The interaction of the two least bound neutrons in\nthe ground state of $^{12}_4$Be mediated by the $v_{14}$ Argonne\nnucleon-nucleon potential and by the exchange of the phonon cloud, give rise to\na strongly correlated state, where the neutrons spend more than half of the\ntime in (s$^2$+d$^2$)-configurations, resulting in a breaking of the N=8 shell\nclosure.\n", "  Density fluctuations of expanding nuclear matter are studied within a\nmean-field model in which fluctuations are generated by an external stochastic\nfield. Fluctuations develop about a mean one-body phase-space density\ncorresponding to a hydrodinamic motion that describes a slow expansion of the\nsystem. A fluctuation-dissipation relation suitable for a uniformly expanding\nmedium is obtained and used to constrain the strength of the stochastic field.\nThe distribution of the liquid domains in the spinodal decomposition is\nderived. Comparison of the related distribution of the fragment size with\nexperimental data on the nuclear multifragmentation is quite satisfactory.\n", "  Heavy quark energy loss in a hot QCD plasma is computed taking into account\nthe competing effects due to suppression of zeroth order gluon radiation below\nthe plasma frequency and the enhancement of gluon radiation due to first order\nmedium induced Bremsstrahlung.\n  The results suggest a surprising degree of cancellation between the two\nmedium effects for charm quarks and provides a possible explanation for the\nnull effect observed by PHENIX in the prompt electron spectrum in Au+Au at\n$\\surd s=$ 130 AGeV.\n", "  We study the influence of proton-neutron (p-n) correlations on alpha-decay\nwidth. It is shown from the analysis of alpha Q values that the p-n\ncorrelations increase the penetration of the alpha particle through the Coulomb\nbarrier in the treatment following Gamow's formalism, and enlarges the total\nalpha-decay width significantly.\n  In particular, the isoscalar p-n interactions play an essential role in\nenlarging the alpha-decay width.\n  The so-called \"alpha-condensate\" in Z > 84 isotopes are related to the strong\np-n correlations.\n", "  A systematic study of isotope chains in the rare--earth region is presented.\nFor the chains (144-154)Nd, (146-160)Sm, (148-162)Gd, and (150-166)Dy, energy\nlevels, E2 transition rates, and two--neutron separation energies are described\nby using the most general (up to two--body terms) IBM Hamiltonian. For each\nisotope chain a general fit is performed in such a way that all parameters but\none are kept fixed to describe the whole chain. In this region nuclei evolve\nfrom spherical to deformed shapes and a method based on catastrophe theory, in\ncombination with a coherent state analysis to generate the IBM energy surfaces,\nis used to identify critical phase transition points.\n", "  In a recent paper L.G. Moretto et al [nucl-th/0208024] claim that the\nnegative heat capacities presented in our previously published paper\n\\cite{PRL2000} are \"artifacts\" coming from the use of periodic boundary\nconditions in the Lattice-Gas calculations. We stress in this comment that this\nclaim is wrong: in ref. \\cite{PRL2000} we did not use periodic boundary\nconditions and anyhow the boundary conditions are irrelevant for the\nstatistical ensemble used in \\cite{PRL2000}. The second claim of\n[nucl-th/0208024] is that, because of the Coulomb repulsion, systems \"with A>60\nshould present no anomalous negative heat capacities\". We show that this\nconclusion is contradicted by exact Lattice-gas simulations including Coulomb\nforces which present negative heat capacities even for A>200.\n", "  We present a unified description of the vector meson and dilepton production\nin elementary and in heavy ion reactions. The production of vector mesons\n($\\rho,\\omega$) is described via the excitation of nuclear resonances ($R$).\nThe theoretical framework is an extended vector meson dominance model (eVMD).\nThe treatment of the resonance decays $R\\longmapsto NV$ with arbitrary spin is\ncovariant and kinematically complete. The eVMD includes thereby excited vector\nmeson states in the transition form factors. This ensures correct asymptotics\nand provides a unified description of photonic and mesonic decays. The\nresonance model is successfully applied to the $\\omega$ production in $p+p$\nreactions. The same model is applied to the dilepton production in elementary\nreactions ($p+p, p+d$). Corresponding data are well reproduced. However, when\nthe model is applied to heavy ion reactions in the BEVALAC/SIS energy range the\nexperimental dilepton spectra measured by the DLS Collaboration are\nsignificantly underestimated at small invariant masses. As a possible solution\nof this problem the destruction of quantum interference in a dense medium is\ndiscussed. A decoherent emission through vector mesons decays enhances the\ncorresponding dilepton yield in heavy ion reactions. In the vicinity of the\n$\\rho/\\omega$-peak the reproduction of the data requires further a substantial\ncollisional broadening of the $\\rho$ and in particular of the $\\omega$ meson.\n", "  I review theory and phenomenology of\n  (K/2,K/2)*[(1/2,0)+(0,1/2)] states.\n  First I make the case that the observed nucleon and Delta (1232) excitations\n(up to Delta(1600)) are exhausted by unconstrained (K/2,K/2)*[(1/2,0)+(0,1/2)]\nstates with K=1,3, and 5, which originate from rotational and vibrational\nexcitations of an underlying quark--diquark configuration.\n  Second, I consider the simplest case of K=1 and show that the\n  \\gamma^\\mu\\psi_\\mu =0 constraint of the Rarita-Schwinger framework is a\nshort-hand of:\n  - 1/3 (1/m^2 W^2 +3/4)\\psi_\\mu = \\psi_\\mu, the covariant definition of the\nunique invariant subspace of the squared Pauli-Lubanski vector, W^2, that is a\nparity singlet and of highest spin-3/2 at rest.\n  I suggest to work in the 16 dimensional vector spinor space\n  \\Psi= A *\\psi rather than keeping Lorentz and spinor indices separated and\nshow that the above second order equation guarantees the covariant description\nof a has-been spin-3/2 states at rest without invoking further supplementary\nconditions.\n  In gauging the latter equation minimally and, in calculating the determinant,\none obtains a pathology-free energy-momentum dispersion relation, thus avoiding\nthe classical Velo-Zwanziger problem of imaginary energies in the presence of\nan external electromagnetic field.\n", "  In this contribution we discuss the physics of strange hadrons in low energy\n($\\simeq 1-2 \\rm AGeV$) heavy ion collision. In this energy range the relevant\nstrange particle are the kaons and anti-kaons. The most interesting aspect\nconcerning these particles are so called in-medium modifications. We will\nattempt to review the current status of understanding of these in medium\nmodifications. In addition we will briefly discuss other issues related with\nkaon production, such as the nuclear equation of state and chemical\nequilibrium.\n", "  The anomalous processes, \\gamma \\to 3 \\pi and \\gamma \\pi \\to \\pi\\pi, are\ninvestigated within the Dyson-Schwinger framework using the rainbow-ladder\napproximation. Calculations reveal that a complete set of ladder diagrams\nbeyond the impulse approximation are necessary to reproduce the fundamental\nlow-energy theorem for the anomalous form factor. Higher momentum calculations\nalso agree with the limited form factor data and exhibit the same resonance\nbehavior as the phenomenological vector meson dominance model.\n", "  We study, for the first time, the spatial extension of the\n  \"source\" that produces quark gluon plasma (QGP) in ultra relativistic heavy\nion collisions. The longitudinal dimension is studied as a function of time as\nthe system evolves. The source size is found to exhibit a novel non-classical\nfeature.\n", "  In the framework of the symplectic extension of the\n  Interacting Vector Boson Model (IVBM) a good description of the first excited\npositive and negative parity bands of the nuclei in the rare earth and the\nactinide region is achieved. The bands investigated in the model are extended\nto very high angular momenta as a result of their consideration as \"yrast\"\nbands with respect to the symplectic classification of the basis states. The\nanalysis of the eigenvalues of the model Hamiltonian reveals the presence of an\ninteraction between these bands. Due to this iteraction the Delta(L)=1\nstaggering effect between the energies of the states of two bands is also\nreproduced including the \"beat\" patterns.\n", "  We show that an unambiguous way of determining the universal limiting\nfragmentation region is to consider the derivative ($d^2n/d\\eta^2$) of the\npseudo-rapidity distribution per participant pair.\n  In addition, we find that the transition region between the fragmentation and\nthe central plateau regions exhibits a second kind of universal behavior that\nis only apparent in $d^2n/d\\eta^2$.\n  The $\\sqrts$ dependence of the height of the central plateau\n$(dn/d\\eta)_{\\eta=0}$ and the total charged particle multiplicity $n_{\\rm\ntotal}$ critically depend on the behavior of this universal transition curve.\n  Analyzing available RHIC data, we show that $(dn/d\\eta)_{\\eta=0}$ can be\nbounded by $\\ln^2 s$ and $n_{\\rm total}$ can be bounded by $\\ln^3 s$.\n  We also show that the deuteron-gold data from RHIC has the exactly same\nfeatures as the gold-gold data indicating that these universal behaviors are a\nfeature of the initial state parton-nucleus interactions and not a consequence\nof final state interactions.\n  Predictions for LHC energy are also given.\n", "  We consistently analyze two-pion correlation functions and three-pion\ncorrelation functions of 130$A$ GeV Au+Au collisions measured at RHIC, applying\nthree models of partially coherent pion sources. The effect of long-lived\nresonances on the chaoticity in the two-pion correlation function is estimated\non the basis of a statistical model. We find that the chaoticity extracted from\nthe three-pion correlation function is consistent with that extracted from the\ntwo-pion correlation function at vanishing relative momenta after the\nsubtraction of the contribution of the long-lived resonance decays.\n  All three models indicate that pions are emitted from the mixture of a\nchaotic source and coherent sources in the 130$A$ GeV Au+Au collisions.\n", "  A new kind of the relativistic three-body equations for the three fermion\nsystems are suggested. These equations are derived in the framework of the\nstandard field-theoretical $S$-matrix approach in the time-ordered three\ndimensional form. Therefore corresponding relativistic covariant equations are\nthree-dimensional from the beginning. The solutions of the considered equations\nsatisfy automatically the unitarity condition and for the leptons these\nequations are exactly gauge invariant even after the truncation over the\nmultiparticle ($n>3$) intermediate states. Moreover, the form of these\nthree-body equations does not depend on the choice of the model Lagrangian and\nit is the same for the formulations with and without quark degrees of freedom.\nThe effective potential of the suggested equations is defined by the vertex\nfunctions with two on-mass shell particles. It is emphasized that these INPUT\nvertex functions can be constructed from experimental data.\n  Special attention is given to the comparison with the three-body Faddeev\nequations. Unlike to these equations, the suggested three-body equation have\nthe form of the Lippmann-Schwinger-type equations with the connected potential.\nIn addition, the microscopical potential of the suggested equations contains\nthe contributions from the three-body forces and from the particle creation\n(annihilation) mechanism on the one external particles. The structure of the\nthree-body forces, appearing in the considered field-theoretical formulation,\nis analyzed.\n", "  Considering two-body integral equations we show how they can be dimensionally\nreduced by integrating exactly over the azimuthal angle of the intermediate\nmomentum. Numerical solution of the resulting equation is feasible without\nemploying a partial-wave expansion. We illustrate this procedure for the\nBethe-Salpeter equation for pion-nucleon scattering and give explicit details\nfor the one-nucleon-exchange term in the potential. Finally, we show how this\nmethod can be applied to pion photoproduction from the nucleon with $\\pi N$\nrescattering being treated so as to maintain unitarity to first order in the\nelectromagnetic coupling. The procedure for removing the azimuthal angle\ndependence becomes increasingly complex as the spin of the particles involved\nincreases.\n", "  It is proved that the potentials of the form $\\beta^{2n}$ (with $n$ being\ninteger) provide a ``bridge'' between the U(5) symmetry of the Bohr Hamiltonian\nwith a harmonic oscillator potential (occuring for $n=1$) and the E(5) model of\nIachello (Bohr Hamiltonian with an infinite well potential, materialized for\ninfinite $n$). Parameter-free (up to overall scale factors) predictions for\nspectra and B(E2) transition rates are given for the potentials $\\beta^4$,\n$\\beta^6$, $\\beta^8$, corresponding to $R_4=E(4)/E(2)$ ratios of 2.093, 2.135,\n2.157 respectively, compared to the $R_4$ ratios 2.000 of U(5) and 2.199 of\nE(5). Hints about nuclei showing this behaviour, as well as about potentials\n``bridging'' the E(5) symmetry with O(6) are briefly discussed. A note about\nthe appearance of Bessel functions in the framework of E(n) symmetries is given\nas a by-product.\n", "  The electromagnetic(EM) interactions between charged protons on the\ncorrelations of nucleons are discussed by introducing the Anderson-Higgs\nmechanism of broken U(1) EM symmetry into the relativistic nuclear theory with\na parametric photon mass. The non-saturating Coulomb force contribution is\nemphasized on the equation of state of nuclear matter with charge symmetry\nbreaking(CSB) at finite temperature and the breached $^1S_0$ pairing\ncorrelations of proton-proton and neutron-neutron. The universal properties\ngiven by an order parameter field with a non-zero vacuum expectation value\n(VEV) nearby phase transition are explored within the mean field theory(MFT)\nlevel. This mechanism can be extended to the charged or charge neutralized\nstrongly coupling multi-components system for the discussion of binding or\npairing issues.\n", "  We analyze the energy dependence for two types of parity-non-conserving\n  (PNC) asymmetries in the reaction $\\gamma D\\to np$ in the near-threshold\nregion. The first one is the asymmetry in reaction with circularly polarized\nphoton beam and unpolarized deuteron target. The second one corresponds to\nthose with an unpolarized photon beam and polarized target. We find that the\ntwo asymmetries have quite different energy dependence, and their shapes are\nsensitive to the PNC-meson exchange coupling constants.\n  The predictions for the future possible experiments to provide definite\nconstraints for the PNC-coupling constants are discussed.\n", "  The unusual structure of Li11, the first halo nucleus found, is analyzed by\nthe Preparata model of nuclear structure. By applying Coherent Nucleus Theory,\nwe obtain an interaction potential for the halo-neutrons that rightly\nreproduces the fundamental state of the system.\n", "  The spin-$\\ffh$ resonance effects are studied within the coupled channel\neffective Lagrangian model for baryon resonance analysis. We extend our\nprevious hadronic calculations to incorporate the $D_{15}$, $F_{15}$, $D_{35}$,\n$F_{35}$ states.\n  While the effect of the spin-$\\ffh$ resonances to the $\\eta N$, $K \\Lambda$,\nand $K \\Sigma$ reactions are small, the contribution to the $\\omega N$ is found\nto be important. The results for the 'conventional' and Pascalutsa-like\nspin-$\\ffh$ descriptions are discussed.\n\\PACS{{11.80.-m},{13.75.Gx},{14.20.Gk},{13.30.Gk}}\n", "  New generation of neutron decay experiments, which can be done with high\naccuracy at new Spallation Neutron Sources, are very important for solution of\ncurrent problems of fundamental physics and for tests of the Standard Model.\nThe open problems of theory related to these experiments and possible\napproaches to their solutions are discussed.\n", "  We discuss a relation between the\n  QCD thermodynamics obtained from a statistical analysis of particle\nproduction in heavy ion collisions at SPS and RHIC energies and recent LGT\nresults at finite chemical potential. We show that basic thermodynamic\nproperties obtained from the phenomenological statistical operator of a hadron\nresonance gas that describes particle yields in heavy ion collisions are\nconsistent with recent LGT results. We argue that for $T\\leq T_c$ the equation\nof state derived from\n  Monte--Carlo simulations of two quark--flavor QCD at finite chemical\npotential can be well described by a hadron resonance gas when using the same\nset of approximations as used in LGT calculations. We examine the influence of\na finite quark mass on the position of the deconfinement transition in\ntemperature and chemical potential plane.\n", "  In this talk I shall discuss some regularities of many-body systems in the\npresence of random interactions and regularities of a single-$j$ shell for the\n$J$ pairing interaction which works only when two particles are coupled to spin\n$J$. I shall first explain an empirical rule to predict the spin $I$ ground\nstate probability.\n  Then I shall present some interesting results of a single-$j$ shell under the\n$J$ pairing interaction. Last I shall discuss some preliminary results of\nbinding energies in the presence of random two-body interactions.\n", "  We present a detailed theoretical investigation of hadron attenuation in deep\ninelastic scattering (DIS) off complex nuclei in the kinematic regime of the\nHERMES experiment. The analysis is carried out in the framework of a\nprobabilistic coupled-channel transport model based on the\nBoltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (BUU) equation, which allows for a treatment of the\nfinal-state interactions (FSI) beyond simple absorption mechanisms.\nFurthermore, our event-by-event simulations account for the kinematic cuts of\nthe experiments as well as the geometrical acceptance of the detectors. We\ncalculate the multiplicity ratios of charged hadrons for various nuclear\ntargets relative to deuterium as a function of the photon energy nu, the hadron\nenergy fraction z_h=E_h/nu and the transverse momentum p_T. We also confront\nour model results on double-hadron attenuation with recent experimental data.\nSeparately, we compare the attenuation of identified hadrons (pi^\\pm, \\pi^0,\nK^\\pm, p and pbar) on Ne and Kr targets with the data from the HERMES\nCollaboration and make predictions for a Xe target. At the end we turn towards\nhadron attenuation on Cu nuclei at EMC energies. Our studies demonstrate that\n(pre-)hadronic final-state interactions play a dominant role in the kinematic\nregime of the HERMES experiment while our present approach overestimates the\nattenuation at EMC energies.\n", "  High-energy nuclear collisions produce quark-gluon plasmas that expand and\nhadronize. If the associated phase transition is of first order then the\nhadronization should proceed through a spinodal phase separation. We explore\nhere the possibility of identifying the associated clumping by analysis of\nsuitable N-particle momentum correlations.\n", "  We discuss the anthropic principle and its implications for our existence and\nthe physical laws which govern the universe. Several amazing coincidences which\nprovide conditions necessary for creation of life suggest that the \"laws of\nnature\" are not uniquely determined. The idea that our universe is only one\namong a multitude of universes with different physical laws, as predicted by\nthe theory of chaotic cosmic inflation, provides a logically simple, but\nspeculative resolution of the anthropic principle. An important insight of\nmodern quantum field theory is that the physical laws are not only determined\nby symmetry principles, but also by the nature of the vacuum state. Experiments\ninvolving collisions of relativistic heavy ions provide the clearest tests of\nthe hypothesis that properties of particles and forces can be modified by a\nchange in the vacuum state. We outline the goals of these experiments and\nbriefly review their current status.\n", "  Nucleon-nucleon (NN) phase shifts and the spectroscopy of $A \\le 6$ nuclei\nare successfully described by an inverse scattering potential that is separable\nwith oscillator form factors.\n", "  In this work we study the energy dependence of the $J/\\psi-K^*$ dissociation\ncross section, using a meson exchange model based on effective hadronic\nLagrangian that includes couplings between pseudoscalar and vector mesons. We\nalso consider anomalous parity terms.\n  Off-shell effects at the vertices were handled with QCD sum rule estimates\nfor the running coupling constants, and we compare the results with and without\nform factors. We also study the $J/\\psi-\\rho$ cross section with form factors.\nThe total $J/\\psi-K^*$ cross section was found to be $1.6 \\sim1.9$ mb for\n$4.2\\leq\\sqrt{s}\\leq5~\\GeV$.\n", "  The structure of the $N \\approx Z$ nuclei $^{66}$Ge and $^{68}$Ge is studied\nby the shell model on a spherical basis. The calculations with an extended\n$P+QQ$ Hamiltonian in the configuration space\n  ($2p_{3/2}$, $1f_{5/2}$, $2p_{1/2}$, $1g_{9/2}$) succeed in reproducing\nexperimental energy levels, moments of inertia and $Q$ moments in Ge isotopes.\nUsing the reliable wave functions, this paper investigates particle alignments\nand nuclear shapes in $^{66}$Ge and $^{68}$Ge.\n  It is shown that structural changes in the four sequences of the positive-\nand negative-parity yrast states with even $J$ and odd $J$ are caused by\nvarious types of particle alignments in the $g_{9/2}$ orbit.\n  The nuclear shape is investigated by calculating spectroscopic $Q$ moments of\nthe first and second $2^+$ states, and moreover the triaxiality is examined by\nthe constrained Hatree-Fock method.\n  The changes of the first band crossing and the nuclear deformation depending\non the neutron number are discussed.\n", "  We propose a fully quantum-mechanical method of treating four-body nuclear\nbreakup processes in scattering of a projectile consisting of three\nconstituents, by extending the continuum-discretized coupled-channels method.\nThe three-body continuum states of the projectile are discretized by\ndiagonalizing the internal\n  Hamiltonian of the projectile with the Gaussian basis functions. For\n  $^6$He+$^{12}$C scattering at 18 and 229.8 MeV, the validity of the method is\ntested by convergence of the elastic and breakup cross sections with respect to\nincreasing the number of the basis functions. Effects of the four-body breakup\nand the Borromean structure of $^6$He on the elastic and total reaction cross\nsections are discussed.\n", "  Feshbach resonances of trapped ultracold alkali atoms allow to vary the\natomic scattering length a. At very large values of a the system enters an\nuniversal strongly coupled regime in which its properties--the ground state\nenergy, pressure {\\it etc.}--become independent of a. We discuss transport\nproperties of such systems. In particular, the universality arguments imply\nthat the shear viscosity of ultracold Fermi atoms at the Feschbach resonance is\nproportional to the particle number density n, and the Plank constant \\hbar\n\\eta=\\hbar n \\alpha_\\eta, where \\alpha_\\eta is a universal constant. Using\nHeisenberg uncertainty principle and Einstein's relation between diffusion and\nviscosity we argue that the viscosity has the lower bound given by\n\\alpha_{\\eta} \\leq (6\\pi)^{-1}. We relate the damping of low-frequency density\noscillations of ultracold optically trapped ^{6}Li atoms to viscosity and find\nthat the value of the coefficient \\alpha_\\eta is about 0.3. We also show that\nsuch a small viscosity can not be explained by kinetic theory based on binary\nscattering. We conclude that the system of ultracold atoms near the Feshbach\nresonance is a near-ideal liquid.\n", "  Calculations of the one-hole spectral function of 16O for small missing\nenergies are reviewed.\n  The self-consistent Green's function approach is employed together with the\nFaddeev equations technique in order to study the coupling of both\nparticle-particle and particle-hole phonons to the single-particle motion. The\nresults indicate that the characteristics of hole fragmentation are related to\nthe low-lying states of 16O and an improvement of the description of this\nspectrum, beyond the random phase approximation, is required to understand the\nexperimental strength distribution.\n  A first calculation in this direction that accounts for two-phonon states is\ndiscussed.\n", "  The non-mesonic weak decay of polarized Lambda-hypernuclei is studied for the\nfirst time by taking into account, with a Monte Carlo intranuclear cascade\ncode, the nucleon final state interactions. A one-meson-exchange model is\nemployed to describe the Lambda N-> n N processes in a finite nucleus\nframework. The relationship between the intrinsic Lambda asymmetry parameter\na_\\Lambda and the asymmetry a^M_\\Lambda accessible in experiments is discussed.\nA strong dependence of a^M_\\Lambda on nucleon final state interactions and\ndetection threshold is obtained. Our results for a^M_\\Lambda are consistent\nwith ^{11}_\\Lambda B and ^{12}_\\Lambda C data but disagree with observations in\n^5_\\Lambda He.\n", "  Norm overlap kernels of the cranked Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov states are\nstudied in the context of angular momentum projection. In particular, the\ngeometrical distribution of nodal lines, i.e., one dimensional structures where\nthe overlap kernels possess null value, is investigated in the three\ndimensional space defined by the Euler angles. It is important to know the\ndistribution of these nodal lines when one attempts to determine the phase of\nnorm overlap kernels.\n", "  We study stability and structure of quark matters as a function of density in\na framework of molecular dynamics (MD). Using appropriate effective\ninteractions and the frictional cooling method, we search for the minimum\nenergy of the system. Transition from confined to deconfined phase is observed\nat densities of 2 -- 3$\\rho_0$, where $\\rho_0$ is the nuclear matter saturation\ndensity. The $uds$ matter becomes more stable than the charge-neutral $ud$\nmatter at 3$\\rho_0$, but the $udd$ matter is the most stable even at high\ndensity.\n", "  The observation of a granular structure in high-energy heavy-ion collisions\ncan be used as a signature for the quark-gluon plasma phase transition, if the\nphase transition is first order in nature. We propose methods to detect a\ngranular structure by the single-event intensity interferometry. We find that\nthe correlation function from a chaotic source of granular droplets exhibits\nlarge fluctuations, with maxima and minima at relative momenta which depend on\nthe relative coordinates of the droplet centers. The presence of this type of\nmaxima and minima of a single-event correlation function at many relative\nmomenta is a signature for a granular structure and a first-order QCD phase\ntransition. We further observe that the Fourier transform of the correlation\nfunction of a granular structure exhibits maxima at the relative spatial\ncoordinates of the droplet centers, which can provide another signature of the\ngranular structure.\n", "  The cross section of neutron-deuteron radiative capture $n d\\to {^3H}\\gamma$\nis calculated at energies relevant to Big-Bang nucleosynthesis ($ 20 \\leq E\n\\leq 200 $ Kev) with pionless Effective Field Theory. At these energies,\nmagnetic transition M1 gives the dominant contribution. The M1 amplitude is\ncalculated up to next-to-next-to leading order(N$^2$LO) with insertion of\nthree-body force. Results are in good agreement within few percent theoretical\nuncertainty in comparison with available calculated data below E=200 Kev.\n", "  The fission processes of $^{112}$Sn + $^{112}$Sn and $^{116}$Sn + $^{116}$Sn\nare simulated with the combination of the Langevin equation and the statistical\ndecay model. The masses of two fission fragments are given by assuming the\nprocess of symmetric fission or asymmetric fission by the Monte Carlo sampling\nwith the\n  Gaussian probability distribution. From the analysis to the isotopic/isotonic\nratios of the fission fragments from both reactions, the isoscaling behavior\nhas been observed and investigated in details. Isoscaling parameters $\\alpha$\nand $\\beta$ are extracted as a function of the charge number and neutron\nnumber, respectively, in different width of the sampling Gaussian probability\ndistribution. It seems that $\\alpha$ is sensitive to the width of fission\nprobability distribution of the mass asymmetrical parameter but $\\beta$ is not.\nBoth $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ drop with the increasing of beam energy and the\nreduced friction parameter.\n", "  We study the neutron and proton dynamical behavior along the fragmentation\npath in semi-peripheral collisions: 58Fe+58Fe (charge asymmetric, N/Z = 1.23)\nand 58Ni+58Ni (charge symmetric, N/Z = 1.07), at 47 AMeV. We observe that\nisospin dynamics processes take place also in the charge-symmetric system\n58Ni+58Ni, that may produce more asymmetric fragments. A neutron enrichment of\nthe neck fragments is observed, resulting from the interplay between\npre-equilibrium emission and the phenomenon of \"isospin-migration\". Both\neffects depend on the EoS (Equation of State) symmetry term. This point is\nillustrated by comparing the results obtained with two different choices of the\nsymmetry energy density dependence.\n  New correlation observables are suggested, to study the reaction mechanism\nand the isospin dynamics.\n", "  Feshbach's projection formalism in the particle-hole model space leads to a\nmicroscopic description of scattering in terms of the many-body self-energy. To\ninvestigate the feasibility of this approach, an optical potential for O-16 is\nconstructed starting from two previous calculations of the self-energy for this\nnucleus. The results reproduce the background phase shifts for positive parity\nwaves and the resonances beyond the mean field.\n  The latter can be computed microscopically for energies of astrophysical\ninterest using Green's function theory.\n", "  Collective flows in heavy-ion collisions from AGS ($(2-11)A$ GeV) to SPS\n($(40,158)A$ GeV) energies are investigated in a nonequilibrium transport model\nwith nuclear mean-field (MF). Sideward $<p_x>$, directed $v_1$, and elliptic\nflows $v_2$ are systematically studied with different assumptions on the\nnuclear equation of state (EOS). We find that momentum dependence in the\nnuclear MF is important for the understanding of the proton collective flows at\nAGS and SPS energies. Calculated results with momentum dependent MF\nqualitatively reproduce the experimental data of proton sideward, directed, and\nelliptic flows in a incident energy range of $(2-158)A$ GeV.\n", "  The specific heat of hot hadronic matter is related to particle production\nyields from experiments done at CERN/RHIC. The mass fluctuation of excited\nhadrons plays an important role. Connections of the specific heat, mean\nhadronic mass excited and its fluctuation with properties of baryon and\nelectric chemical potentials (value, slope and curvature) are also developed. A\npossible divergence of the specific heat as 1/(To-T)^2 is discussed. Some\nconnections with net charge fluctuations are noted.\n", "  We derive general explicit expressions for a shell-model calculation of the\nintrinsic asymmetry parameter, $a_\\Lambda$, in nonmesonic weak hypernuclear\ndecay. They include the effects of three-body kinematics in the final states of\nthe decay and correctly treat the contribution of transitions originating from\nsingle-proton states beyond the s-shell. The expressions are particularized to\nthe cases of $^5_\\Lambda$He and $^{12}_\\Lambda$C and used for the calculation\nof $a_\\Lambda$ in several one-meson-exchange models. Besides the strictly local\napproximation usually adopted for the transition potential, we also consider\nthe addition of the first-order nonlocality terms. We find values for\n$a_\\Lambda$ ranging from -0.62 to -0.24, in qualitative agreement with other\ntheoretical estimates but in contradiction with some recent experimental\ndeterminations.\n", "  We study the hydrodynamical expansion of a hot and baryon-dense quark fluid\ncoupled to classical real-time evolution of the long wavelength modes of the\nchiral field. Significant density inhomogeneities develop dynamically when the\ntransition to the symmetry-broken state occurs. We find that the amplitude of\nthe density inhomogeneities is larger for expansion trajectories crossing the\nline of first-order transitions than for crossovers, which could provide some\ninformation on the location of a critical point. A few possible experimental\nsignatures for inhomogeneous decoupling surfaces are mentioned briefly.\n", "  Charmonium productions in $p-p$ and $A-B$ collisions have been estimated\nwithin the ambit of colour evaporation model (CEM). The model parameters have\nbeen fixed by fitting the theoretical results with CDF data. The method is then\napplied to RHIC and LHC energies to obtain the transverse momentum\ndistributions of $J/\\psi$, $\\psi^{\\prime}$ and $\\chi_c$. Suppression due to\nDebye screening in a quark gluon plasma (QGP) is estimated at various\ncentrality cuts. The final $p_T$ distributions of various resonances are then\npredicted convoluting with the survival probability.\n", "  The triangular enhancement of the rapidity distribution of hadrons produced\nin p+A reactions relative to p+p is a leading order in A^{1/3}/log(s) violation\nof longitudinal boost invariance at high energies. In A+A reactions this leads\nto a trapezoidal enhancement of the local rapidity density of produced gluons.\nThe local rapidity gradient is proportional to the local participant number\nasymmetry, and leads to an effective rotation in the reaction plane. We propose\nthat three dimensional jet tomography, correlating the long range rapidity and\nazimuthal dependences of the nuclear modification factor,\nR_{AA}(\\eta,\\phi,p_\\perp; b>0), can be used to look for this intrinsic\nlongitudinal boost violating structure of $A+A$ collisions to image the\nproduced twisted strongly coupled quark gluon plasma (sQGP). In addition to\ndipole and elliptic azimuthal moments of R_{AA}, a significant high p_\\perp\noctupole moment is predicted away from midrapidity. The azimuthal angles of\nmaximal opacity and hence minima of R_{AA} are rotated away from the normal to\nthe reaction plane by an `Octupole Twist' angle, \\theta_3(\\eta), at forward\nrapidities.\n", "  We compute the polarized quark distribution function of a bound nucleon. The\nChiral Quark-Soliton model provides the quark and antiquark substructure of the\nnucleon embedded in nuclear matter. Nuclear effects cause significant\nmodifications to the polarized distributions including an enhancement of the\naxial coupling constant.\n", "  We evaluate strangeness produced in Au--Au interactions at\n  $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=200$ GeV, as function of reaction participant number $A$,\nand obtain the relative strange quark content at hadronization. Strange baryon\nand antibaryon rapidity density yields are studied, relative to, and as\nfunction of, participant number, and produced hadron yields.\n", "  Recently it was conjectured that the strongly attractive antikaon--nucleon\npotential can result in the formation of antikaon nuclear bound states. We\ndiscuss the formation of such states as possible residues in heavy ion\ncollisions. In this context, we calculate the excitation functions of single-\nand double-$K^-$ clusters in terms of the statistical thermal model. We show\nthat, if such objects indeed exist, then, in heavy ion collisions, the\nsingle-$K^-$ clusters are most abundantly produced at present SIS energies,\nwhile the double-$K^-$ clusters show a pronounced maximum yield in the energy\ndomain of the future accelerator at GSI. This is a direct consequence of: i)\nthe baryonic dominance in low energy heavy ion collisions and the large\nbaryonic content of the antikaonic bound states; ii) the strong energy\ndependence of strangeness production at low energies.\n  The production yields of double-strange clusters is compared with that of\ndouble strange baryons. It is shown that at SIS energy there is a linear\nscaling relation of the $\\Xi^-/K^+$ with $K^+/p$ yields ratio.\n", "  The isoscalar giant monopole resonance (ISGMR) and isovector giant dipole\nresonance (IVGDR) in finite nuclei are studied in the framework of a\nrelativistic transport approach. The kinetic equations are derived within an\neffective nucleon-meson field theory in the Relativistic Mean Field (RMF)\nscheme, even extended to density dependent vertices. Small amplitude\noscillations are analysed using the Relativistic Vlasov (RV) approach, i.e.\nneglecting nucleon collision terms. The time evolution of the isoscalar\nmonopole moment and isovector dipole moment and the corresponding Fourier power\nspectra are discussed. In the case of ^{208}Pb we study in detail the\ndependence of the monopole response on the effective mass and symmetry energy\nat saturation given by the used covariant effective interaction. We show that a\nreduced m^* and a larger a_4 can compensate the effect on the ISGMR energy\ncentroid of a much larger compressibility modulus K_{nm}. This result is\nimportant in order to overcome the conflicting determination of the nuclear\ncompressibility between non-relativistic and relativistic effective\ninteractions. For the symmetry energy dynamical effects, we carefully analyze\nthe influence of the inclusion of an effective isovector scalar channel,\n  \\delta-meson field, with constant and density dependent couplings. We show\nthe relevance of the $slope$ (or pressure) of the symmetry energy at saturation\non the ISGMR and IVGDR modes for neutron-rich systems. Density dependent\nvertices are not much affecting our conclusions. Following as a guidance some\nextended dispersion relations in nuclear matter, we see two main reasons for\nthat, the smoothness of the density dependences around saturation and the\npresence of compensation effects coming from rearrangement terms.\n", "  The charged current pion production induced by neutrinos in $^{12}{C}$,\n$^{16}{O}$ and $^{56}{Fe}$ nuclei has been studied. The calculations have been\ndone for the coherent as well as the incoherent processes assuming $\\Delta$\ndominance and take into account the effect of Pauli blocking, Fermi motion and\nthe renormalization of $\\Delta$ in the nuclear medium. The pion absorption\neffects have also been taken into account.\n", "  The suppression of high transverse momentum particles, recently discovered at\nRHIC, is commonly interpreted as due to parton energy loss. In high energy\nnuclear collisions, QCD jets would deposit a large fraction of their energy and\ninto the produced matter. The question of how this energy is degraded and\nwhether we can use this phenomenon to probe the properties of the produced\nmatter is now under active discussion. It has been proposed that if this\nmatter, which is now being referred to as a {\\em strongly coupled Quark-Gluon\nPlasma} (sQGP), may behave as a liquid with a very small viscosity.\n  In this case, a very specific collective excitation should be produced,\ncalled the ``conical flow'', similar e.g. to the sonic booms generated by the\nshock waves produced by supersonic planes. The RHIC experiments seem indeed to\nbe obtaining some indication that the production of particles emitted opposite\nto a high-$p_t$ jet may actually be peaked away from the quenched jet\ndirection, at an angle roughly consistent with the direction expected in case a\nshock wave is produced (i.e. orthogonal to the Mach cone). In this note we\nspeculate that for tagged heavy-quark jets one may observe a shrinkage of the\nMach cone at moderate $p_t$. The experimental observation of such an effect\nwould be a very good test for the validity of the whole picture currently\nemerging from the study of partonic matter in nuclear collisions.\n", "  We analyze single particle momentum spectra and interferometry radii in\ncentral Au+Au collisions at RHIC within a hydro-inspired parametrization\naccounting for continuous hadron emission through the whole lifetime of\nhydrodynamically expanding fireball. We found that a satisfactory description\nof the data is achieved for a physically reasonable set of parameters when the\nemission from non space-like sectors of the enclosed freeze-out hypersurface is\nfairly long: $ 9$ fm/c. This protracted surface emission is compensated in\noutward interferometry radii by positive $r_{out} - t$ correlations that are\nthe result of an intensive transverse expansion. The main features of the\nexperimental data are reproduced: in particular, the obtained ratio of the\noutward to sideward interferometry radii is less than unity and decreases with\nincreasing transverse momenta of pion pairs. The extracted value of the\ntemperature of emission from the surface of hydrodynamic tube approximately\ncoincides with one found at chemical freeze-out in RHIC Au+Au collisions.\n  A significant contribution of the surface emission to the spectra and to the\ncorrelation functions at relatively large transverse momenta should be taken\ninto account in advanced hydrodynamic models of ultrarelativistic\nnucleus-nucleus collisions.\n", "  The treatment of the $\\Delta$-current and its contribution in the exclusive\n$^{16}$O$(e,e'pp)^{14}$C and $^{16}$O$(\\gamma,pp)^{14}$C knockout reactions are\ninvestigated in combination with the effects of correlations.\n  Different parametrizations of the effective $\\Delta$-current and different\ntreatments of correlations in the two-nucleon overlap function are considered.\nThe results are presented and discussed for a suitable choice of kinematics. It\nis found that the investigation of different mutually supplementing kinematics\nis necessary to resolve the uncertainties in the theoretical ingredients and\nextract clear and unambiguous information on correlations.\n", "  Following a recent work, we present numerical results for total two-nucleon\neffective cross sections in isospin symmetric and asymmetric matter. The\npresent calculations include the additional effect of Pauli blocking of the\nfinal states.\n", "  Ground state properties of neutron rich even-even Be and C nuclei have been\ninvestigated using Relativistic Mean Field approach in co-ordinate space. The\npositions of the neutron drip line are correctly predicted for both the\nelements. The nucleus $^{14}$Be shows a two neutron halo but, contrary to\nexpectation, $^{22}$C does not exhibit any halo structure. In carbon nuclei,\nN=16 comes out as a new magic number. The single particle level ordering\nobserved in stable nuclei is found to be modified in neutron rich Be isotopes.\nElastic partial scattering cross sections for proton scattering in inverse\nkinematics have been calculated using the theoretically obtained densities for\nsome of the nuclei and compared with available experimental data. The total\ncross cross sections for elastic scattering have also been calculated for all\nthe nuclei studied showing a large increase for the halo nucleus $^{14}$Be. The\nnuclei have also been investigated for deformation. The nuclei $^{10}$Be and\n$^{16,18,20}$C are observed to be deformed in their ground state.\n", "  Within the dinuclear system (DNS) conception, instead of solving\nFokker-Planck Equation (FPE) analytically, the Master equation is solved\nnumerically to calculate the fusion probability of super-heavy nuclei, so that\nthe harmonic oscillator approximation to the potential energy of the DNS is\navoided. The relative motion concerning the energy, the angular momentum, and\nthe fragment deformation relaxations is explicitly treated to couple with the\ndiffusion process, so that the nucleon transition probabilities, which are\nderived microscopically, are time-dependent. Comparing with the analytical\nsolution of FPE, our results preserve more dynamical effects. The calculated\nevaporation residue cross sections for one-neutron emission channel of Pb-based\nreactions are basically in agreement with the known experimental data within\none order of magnitude.\n", "  New concept of intermediate- and short-range nuclear force proposed by the\nauthors a few years ago is discussed briefly. The general concept is based on\nan assumption on generation of the dressed dibaryon in intermediate state in\n$NN$ interaction. This new mechanism has been shown to lead not only to\nnumerous new predictions in hadronic physics but also should be responsible for\na large portion of nuclear binding energy and properties of nuclear\nwavefunctions at high momenta.\n", "  We show that the simultaneous measurement of yields and fluctuations is\ncapable of falsifying and constraining the statistical hadronization model. We\nshow how such a measurement can test for chemical non-equilibrium, and\ndistinguish between a high temperature chemically equilibrated freeze-out from\na supercooled freeze-out with an over-saturated phase space. We perform a fit,\nand show that both yields and fluctuations measured at RHIC 200 GeV can be\naccounted for within the second scenario, with both the light and strange quark\nphase space saturated significantly above detailed balance. We point to the\nsimultaneous fit of the $K/\\pi$ fluctuation and the $K^*/K^-$ ratio as evidence\nthat the effect of hadronic re-interactions after freeze-out is small.\n", "  It has been suggested recently ({\\it Phys. Rev. Lett.} 91, 232501 (2003))\nthat the widths of narrow proton resonances are related to neutron Asymptotic\nNormalization Coefficients (ANCs) of their bound mirror analogs because of\ncharge symmetry of nucleon-nucleon interactions.\n  This relation is approximated by a simple analytical formula which involves\nproton resonance energies, neutron separation energies, charges of residual\nnuclei and the range of their strong interaction with the last nucleon. In the\npresent paper, we perform microscopic-cluster model calculations for the ratio\nof proton widths to neutron ANCs squared in mirror states for several light\nnuclei. We compare them to predictions of the analytical formula and to\nestimates made within a single-particle potential model. A knowledge of this\nratio can be used to predict unknown proton widths for very narrow low-lying\nresonances in the neutron-deficient region of the $sd$- and $pf$-shells, which\nis important for understanding the nucleosynthesis in the $rp$-process.\n", "  We calculate the parity-nonconserving longitudinal asymmetry in the elastic\n$\\vec{p} p$ scattering at the energies where experimental data are available.\nIn addition to the standard one-meson exchange weak potential, the variation of\nthe strong-coupling constants and the non-standard effects such as form factors\nand $2 \\pi$-exchange description of the $\\rho$-exchange potential are taken\ninto account. With the extra effects, we investigate the compatibility of the\nexperimental data and the presently-known range of the vector-meson\nweak-coupling constants.\n", "  Recently a lot of evidence that there exists a critical end point (CEP) in\nthe QCD phase diagram has been accumulating. However, so far, no reliable\nequation of state with the CEP has been employed in hydrodynamical\ncalculations. In this article, we construct the equations of state with the CEP\non the basis of the universality hypothesis and show that the CEP acts as an\nattractor of isentropic trajectories. We also consider the time evolution in\nthe case with the CEP and discuss how the CEP affects the final state\nobservables.\n", "  Following a general form for the Schwinger boson representation of the\nsu(M+1) Lipkin model presented in the previous paper, three types of the\northogonal sets characterizing the su(3)-algebra are proposed. In these three,\nthird is presented in Appendix. The intrinsic state is specified by two quantum\nnumbers and two excited state generating operators play a central role.\n", "  On the basis of the Schwinger boson representation for the Lipkin model\ndeveloped in (I), the Holstein-Primakoff representation for the su(3)-algebra\nis presented. Including the symmetric case, the representation obtained in this\npaper contains all the cases.\n", "  On the basis of the Faddeev integral equations method and the Watson-\nFeshbach concept of the effective (optical) interaction potential, the first\nfully consistent three-body approach to the description of the penetration of a\ncharged particle through the Coulomb field of a two-particle bound complex\n(composed of one charged and one neutral particles) has been developed. A\ngeneral formalism has been elaborated and on its basis, to a first\napproximation in the Sommerfeld parameter, the influence of the nuclear\nstructure on the probability of the penetration of a charged particle (the\nmuon, the pion, the kaon and the proton) through the Gamow barrier of a\ntwo-fragment nucleus (the deuteron and the two lightest lambda hypernuclei,\nlambda hypertriton and lambda hyperhelium-5, has been calculated and studied.\n", "  We predict transverse and longitudinal momentum spectra and yields of\n$\\rho^0$ and $\\omega$ mesons reconstructed from hadron correlations in C+C\nreactions at 2~AGeV. The rapidity and $p_T$ distributions for reconstructable\n$\\rho^0$ mesons differs strongly from the primary distribution, while the\n$\\omega$'s distributions are only weakly modified. We discuss the temporal and\nspatial distributions of the particles emitted in the hadron channel. Finally,\nwe report on the mass shift of the $\\rho^0$ due to its coupling to the\n$N^*(1520)$, which is observable in both the di-lepton and $\\pi\\pi$ channel.\nOur calculations can be tested with the Hades experiment at GSI, Darmstadt.\n", "  A proper treatment of K-mixing is the key to understanding K-isomers. Here,\nwe present a method based on the projected shell model. This method differs\nfrom the usual description of multi-quasiparticle states by introducing a\ntransformation to the laboratory frame and a subsequent configuration mixing in\nthat frame. It allows a quantitative study on the degree of K-violation through\ndirect calculations of electromagnetic transitions.\n", "  Invariance of form factors under Lorentz boosts is a criterion often\nadvocated to determine whether their estimate in a RQM framework is reliable.\nIt is shown that verifying relations stemming from covariance properties under\nspace-time translations could be a more important criterion. Form factors\ncalculated in different approaches for a simple system are discussed with these\nvarious respects. An approximate method is shown to remove the main\ndiscrepancies related to a violation of the above relations.\n", "  We compare results of $2 \\to 1$ $k_t$-factorization approach with\nKwieci\\'nski unintegrated parton distributions and the standard collinear\nfactorization approach at RHIC and slightly smaller energies. Our approach\ncontains only one free parameter responsible for internal parton motion in\nnucleons. In contrast to recent works in the literature our $k_t$-factorization\napproach includes also quark degrees of freedom in addition to purely gluonic\nterms. Both mid and forward rapidity regions are considered. We discuss\nuncertainties due to fragmentation functions. In general, the\n$k_t$-factorization approach gives a better description of the $p_t \\sim$ 1 --\n4 GeV region both at mid and forward rapidity regions. Our approach leads to\nasymmetry in the production of $\\pi^+$ and $\\pi^-$, very similar to the one\nobserved very recently by the BRAHMS collaboration.\n", "  The onset of equilibration in nuclear collisions can lead to related trends\nin the centrality dependence of the average transverse momentum, pt\nfluctuations and net charge fluctuations. We extend the transport description\nof S. Gavin (Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 162301 (2004)) to include radial flow.\n", "  We use the statistical hadronization model (SHM) to describe hadron\nmultiplicity yields and fluctuations. We consider\n  200 GeV Au-Au collisions, and show that both event averaged yields of stable\nparticles and resonances, and event-by-event fluctuation of the $K/\\pi$ ratio\ncan be described within the SHM using the same set of thermal parameters,\nprovided that the phase space occupancy parameter value is significantly above\nchemical equilibrium, and the freeze-out temperature is $\\sim 140$ MeV. We\npresent predictions that allow to test the consistency of our results.\n", "  The isoscaling properties of the primary and final products are studied via\nisospin dependent quantum molecular dynamics\n  (IQMD) model and the followed sequential decay model GEMINI, respectively. It\nis found that the isoscaling parameters $\\alpha$ of both primary and final\nproducts keep no significant change for light fragments, but increases with the\nmass for intermediate and heavy products. The dynamical effects on isoscaling\nare exhibited by that $\\alpha$ value decreases a little with the evolution time\nof the system, and opposite trend for the heavy products. The secondary decay\neffects on isoscaling are reflected in the increasing of the $\\alpha$ value for\nthe final products which experiences secondary decay process.\n  Furthermore the density dependence of the symmetry energy has also been\nexplored, it is observed that in the low densities the symmetry energy\ncoefficient has the form of $C_{sym}(\\rho)\\sim C_{0}(\\rho/\\rho_{0})^{\\gamma}$,\nwhere $\\gamma = 0.7 \\sim 1.3$ for both primary and final products, but $C_{0}$\nhave different values for primary and final products. It is also suggested that\nit might be more reasonable to describe the density dependence of the symmetry\nenergy coefficient by the $C_{sym}(\\rho/\\rho_{0})\\approx\nC_{1}(\\rho/\\rho_{0})^{\\gamma_{soft}} + C_{2}(\\rho/\\rho_{0})^{\\gamma_{stiff}}$\nwith $\\gamma_{soft}\\leq 1$, $\\gamma_{stiff}\\geq 1$ and $C_{1}, C_{2}$ constant\nparameters.\n", "  We investigate two- and three-particle intensity correlation functions of\npions in relativistic heavy ion collisions for different colliding energies.\nBased on three models of particle production, we analyze the degree to which\nthe pion sources are chaotic in the SPS S+Pb, Pb+Pb and the RHIC Au+Au\ncollisions. The ``chaoticity'', $\\lambda$, of the two-particle correlation\nfunctions is corrected for long-lived resonance decays. The effect of the\npartial Coulomb correction is also examined. Although the partially coherent\nmodel gives a result which is consistent with that of STAR, the chaotic\nfraction does not exhibit clear multiplicity dependence if we take into account\nboth the corrected chaoticity and the weight factor of the three-pion\ncorrelation function.\n  The result of the partially-multicoherent model indicates an increasing\nnumber of coherent sources in higher multiplicity events.\n", "  The dimensionless universal coefficient $\\xi$ defines the ratio of the\nunitary fermions energy density to that for the ideal non-interacting ones in\nthe non-relativistic limit with T=0. The classical Thomson Problem is taken as\na nonperturbative quantum many-body arm to address the ground state energy\nincluding the low energy nonlinear quantum fluctuation/correlation effects.\nWith the relativistic Dirac continuum field theory formalism, the concise\nexpression for the energy density functional of the strongly interacting limit\nfermions at both finite temperature and density is obtained. Analytically, the\nuniversal factor is calculated to be $\\xi={4/9}$. The energy gap is\n$\\Delta=\\frac{{5}{18}{k_f^2}/(2m)$.\n", "  The influence of the boundary conditions used in the Wigner-Seitz (WS)\napproximation applied to the neutron star inner crust is examined. The\ngeneralized energy functional method which includes the neutron and proton\npairing correlations is used. Predictions of two versions of the boundary\nconditions are compared with each other. The uncertainties in the equilibrium\nconfiguration (Z,R_c) of the crust, where Z is the proton charge and R_c, the\nradius of the WS cell, correspond to variation of Z by 2 - 6 units and of R_c,\nby 1 - 2 fm. The effect of the boundary conditions is enhanced at increasing\ndensity. These uncertainties are smaller than the variation of Z and R_c coming\nfrom the pairing effects.\n  In the case of high densities, k_F greater than 1 1/fm, the most important\nuncertainty occurs in the value of the neutron gap. In the WS approximation, it\noriginates from the shell effect in the neutron single-particle spectrum which\nis rather pronounced in the case of larger k_F and, correspondingly, small R_c\nvalues, but it becomes negligible at lower density near the drip point. An\napproximate recipe to avoid this uncertainty is suggested.\n", "  The application of the nonperturbative renormalisation group approach to a\nsystem with two fermion species is studied. Assuming a simple ansatz for the\neffective action with effective bosons, describing pairing effects we derive a\nset of approximate flow equations for the effective coupling including boson\nand fermionic fluctuations. The case of two fermions with different masses but\ncoinciding Fermi surfaces is considered.\n  The phase transition to a phase with broken symmetry is found at a critical\nvalue of the running scale. The large mass difference is found to disfavour the\nformation of pairs.\n  The mean-field results are recovered if the effects of boson loops are\nomitted. While the boson fluctuation effects were found to be negligible for\nlarge values of $p_{F} a$ they become increasingly important with decreasing\n$p_{F} a$ thus making the mean field description less accurate.\n", "  Cold fermionic atoms are known to enter the universal strongly coupled regime\nas their scattering length $a$ gets large compared to the inter-particle\ndistances. Recent experimental data provide important critical parameters of\nsuch system. We argue that quarks may enter the same regime due to marginal\nbinding of diquarks, and if so one can use its universality in order to deduce\nsuch properties as the slope of the critical line of color superconductivity,\n  $dT_c/d\\mu$. We further discuss limitations on the critical temperature\nitself and conclude that it is limited by $T_c<70\\, MeV$.\n", "  We discuss optical potentials for the nuclear elastic scattering from a\nvariational viewpoint.\n  Density-dependence in the effective $N$-$N$ interaction leads to density\nrearrangement terms, in addition to the conventional folding term.\n  Effects of the rearrangement on the $N$-$A$ optical potential are illustrated\nin the nuclear-matter limit.\n  Closely relating to consistency with the saturation, the rearrangement\nappreciably improves the isoscalar optical potential depth over the previous\nfolding model calculations.\n  The rearrangement gives stronger effects as the density grows.\n  We also present rearrangement terms in the $A$-$A$ double-folding potential.\n  Since the rearrangement terms are relevant to the nuclear structure but\nshould be handled within the reaction model,\n  $N$-$N$ effective interactions applicable both to structure models and to the\nfolding model will be desired for unambiguous description of the nuclear\nelastic scattering.\n", "  Some recent developments in chiral dynamics of hadrons and hadrons in a\nmedium are presented. Unitary schemes based on chiral Lagrangians describe some\nhadronic states as being dynamically generated resonances.\n  We discuss how standard quantum many body techniques can be used to calculate\nthe properties of these dynamically generated and other hadrons in the nuclear\nmedium. We present some results for vector mesons ($\\rho$ and $\\phi$), scalar\nmesons ($\\sigma$, $\\kappa$, $a_0(980)$, $f_0(980)$), the $\\Lambda(1520)$ and\nfor the in-medium baryon-baryon interaction.\n", "  Analysis of the $nd\\to p(nn)$ reaction in a Gev-energy region is performed in\nthe framework based on the multiple-scattering theory for the few nucleon\nsystem. The special kinematic condition, when momentum transfer from neutron\nbeam to final proton closes to zero, is considered. The possibility to extract\nthe spin-flip term of the elementary $np\\to pn $ amplitude from nd-breakup\nprocess is investigated. The energy dependence of the ratio\n  $R=\\frac{d\\sigma_{nd}} {d\\Omega} / \\frac{d\\sigma_{np}}{d\\Omega}$ is obtained\ntaking account of the final state interaction two outgoing neutrons in $^1\nS_0$-state.\n", "  An exact calculation of the photodisintegration cross section of 3H, 3He and\n4He is performed using as interaction the correlated Argonne V18 potential,\nconstructed within the Unitary Correlation Operator Method (VUCOM).\n  Calculations are carried out using the\n  Lorentz Integral Transform method in conjunction with an hyperspherical\nharmonics basis expansion. A comparison with other realistic potentials and\nwith available experimental data is discussed. The VUCOM potential leads to a\nvery similar description of the cross section as the Argonne V18 interaction\nwith the inclusion of the Urbana IX three-body force for photon energies 45< w\n< 120 MeV, while larger differences are found close to threshold.\n", "  Pionic contributions to static nucleon properties are calculated in a chiral\nextension of the colour-dielectric model. The pion field and residual gluon\nfield are treated perturbatively. It is shown that with a simple choice for the\nenergy of the scalar confining field and in the chiral limit, the system of\nequations describing the bare soliton and the perturbative pion and gluon\nfields may be cast in a dimensionless, parameter free form for large glueball\nmass. This enables a formula for the masses of the nucleon and delta including\nleading order pionic and gluonic contributions and corrections for spurious\ncentre-of-mass motion, valid for a wide range of input parameters determining\nthe bare soliton solutions, to be derived. A further consequence of the scaling\nbehaviour is that pionic contributions to nucleon properties, calculated using\nthe methods of the cloudy bag model, are insensitive to the soliton parameters,\nonce the size of the soliton is fixed. The model results are very similar to\nthose of the cloudy bag model but the predicted masses are about 20\\% too\nlarge, and the pionic contributions to charge radii are underestimated.\n", "  Large discrepancies have been observed between measured Electromagnetic\nDissociation(ED) cross sections and the predictions of the semiclassical\nWeiz\\\"acker-Williams-Fermi(WWF) method. In this paper, the validity of the\nsemiclassical approximation is examined. The total cross section for\nelectromagnetic excitation of a nuclear target by a spinless projectile is\ncalculated in first Born approximation, neglecting recoil. The final result is\nexpressed in terms of correlation functions and convoluted densities in\nconfiguration space. The result agrees with the WWF approximation to leading\norder(unretarded electric dipole approximation), but the method allows an\nanalytic evaluation of the cutoff, which is determined by the details of the\nelectric dipole transition charge density. Using the Goldhaber-Teller model of\nthat density, and uniform charge densities for both projectile and target, the\ncutoff is determined for the total cross section in the nonrelativistic limit,\nand found to be smaller than values currently used for ED calculations. In\naddition, cross sections are calculated using a phenomenological momentum space\ncutoff designed to model final state interactions. For moderate projectile\nenergies, the calculated ED cross section is found to be smaller than the\nsemiclassical result, in qualitative agreement with experiment.\n", "  We demonstrate with soluble models how to employ the effective Hamiltonian\napproach of Lee and Suzuki to obtain all the exact eigenvalues of the full\nHamiltonian. We propose a new iteration scheme to obtain the effective\nHamiltonian and demonstrate its convergence properties.\n", "  (The systematics of photon absorption cross sections in nuclei and small\nmetal particles are examined as a function of the number of constituent\nfermions $A$. It is pointed out that the shell-structure-linked oscillations in\nthe full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the photoneutron cross section in\nnuclei, earlier recognized for $A > 63$, in fact persist down to the lightest\nnuclei. Averaging over the oscillations or focusing on the lower envelope of\nthe oscillating curve (magic nuclei), the FWHM is seen to generally decrease\nwith increasing $A$, consistent with $A^{-1/3}$, a dependence which was earlier\nknown to hold in metal particle systems. If the FWHMs are scaled by the\nrespective Fermi energies and the inverse radii by the Fermi wave vectors, the\ntwo data sets become comparable in magnitude. A schematic theoretical\ndescription of the systematics is presented.)\n", "  We present the first auxiliary field Monte Carlo calculations for a rare\nearth nucleus, Dy-170. A pairing plus quadrupole Hamiltonian is used to\ndemonstrate the physical properties that can be studied in this region. We\ncalculate various static observables for both uncranked and cranked systems and\nshow how the shape distribution evolves with temperature. We also introduce a\ndiscretization of the path integral that allows a more efficient Monte Carlo\nsampling.\n", "  The $\\alpha$--$\\alpha$ differential cross sections are analyzed in the\noptical model using a double--folded potential. With the knowledge of this\npotential bound and resonance--state properties of $\\alpha$--cluster states in\n$^{8}$Be and $^{12}$C as well as astrophysical S--factors of\n$^{4}$He($\\alpha$,$\\gamma$)$^{8}$Be and $^{8}$Be($\\alpha$,$\\gamma$)$^{12}$C are\ncalculated. $\\Gamma_{\\gamma}$--widths and B(E2)--values are deduced.\n", "  Dilepton production following radiative capture of a proton on a nuclear\ntarget is studied in the Impulse Approximation. The cross section is decomposed\nin terms of four time-like nuclear structure functions through a\nlongitudinal-transverse separation of the nuclear current. Using a simple PWIA\nmodel, cross sections and conversion factors are calculated for capture\nreactions p + n >> d + e^+ e^-, p + p >> 2He + e^+ e^- and p + 11B >> 12C + e^+\ne^- at proton energies of 100-200 MeV. The result is compared with a recent\nmeasurement of the conversion factor for p + 11B.\n", "  The cross section for semi-inclusive deep inelastic charged current neutrino\nscattering on hydrogen and deuterium in which a slow proton is observed in\ncoincidence with the muon is computed as a function of Bjorken x and light-cone\nmomentum of the detected proton. In the Impulse Approximation contributions\nfrom hadronization and (in case of the deuteron) the emission of a spectator\nnucleon are considered. In addition the probability for rescattering is\ncomputed. The results are compared to a recent analysis of the data from the\nWA25 (BEBC) experiment at CERN. (KVI-1024)\n", "  This report describes the transitions pion -> meson_1 + meson_2 and also pion\n-> multi-pion for high energy pions interacting with target nuclei (Z,A). The\nphysics interests are: A) Nuclear inelastic coherent diffraction cross sections\nfor pions, for studies of size fluctuations in the pion wave function. B)\nRadiative widths of excited meson states, for tests of vector dominance and\nquark models. C) Experimental determination of the pi- + rho -> pi- + gamma\ntotal reaction rate for gamma production above 0.7 GeV, needed for background\nstudies of quark-gluon plasma formation experiments. D) Investigation of the\ngamma ->3 pi vertex in pion pair production by a pion, for a significantly\nimproved test of the hypothesis of chiral anomalies. The physics interest and\nassociated bibliography are summarized here; with particular reference to the\n200-600 GeV beams available at FNAL and CERN. Complementary GEANT simulations\nand trigger studies are needed.\n", "  It is shown that the large $\\pi^{-}/\\pi^{+}$ ratio at low pion energies\nrecently observed in the reaction of Au+Au at $E_{beam}/A=1.0$ GeV at SIS/GSI\nis due to the strong Coulomb field of the reaction system.\n", "  Triple differential cross sections of pions in heavy ion collisions at 1\nGeV/nucl. are studied with the IQMD model. After discussing general properties\nof $\\Delta$ resonance and pion production we focus on azimuthal correlations:\nAt projectile- and target-rapidities we observe an anticorrelation in the\nin-plane transverse momentum between pions and protons. At c.m.-rapidity,\nhowever, we find that high $p_t$ pions are being preferentially emitted\nperpendicular to the event-plane. We investigate the causes of those\ncorrelations and their sensitivity on the density and momentum dependence of\nthe real and imaginary part of the nucleon and pion optical potential.\n", "  Study of the ground-state properties of Kr, Sr and Zr isotopes has been\nperformed in the framework of the relativistic mean field (RMF) theory using\nthe recently proposed relativistic parameter set NL-SH. It is shown that the\nRMF theory provides an unified and excellent description of the binding\nenergies, isotope shifts and deformation properties of nuclei over a large\nrange of isospin in the Z=40 region. It is observed that the RMF theory with\nthe force NL-SH is able to describe the anomalous kinks in isotope shifts in Kr\nand Sr nuclei, the problem which has hitherto remained unresolved. This is in\ncontrast with the density-dependent Skyrme Hartree-Fock approach which does not\nreproduce the behaviour of the isotope shifts about shell closure. On the Zr\nchain we predict that the isotope shifts exhibit a trend similar to that of the\nKr and Sr nuclei. The RMF theory also predicts shape coexistence in heavy Sr\nisotopes. Several dramatic shape transitions in the isotopic chains are shown\nto be a general feature of nuclei in this region. A comparison of the\nproperties with the available mass models shows that the results of the RMF\ntheory are generally in accord with the predictions of the finite-range droplet\nmodel.\n", "  The description of nuclear matter bulk properties in the framework of\nquark-based hadron models in curved unit cells is extended to finite\ntemperature. We discuss the analogy and interplay of density and temperature\neffects in this formulation and study, as an application, the temperature and\ndensity dependence of chiral vacuum properties in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL)\nmodel.\n", "  An elementary proof of the 3-body Efimov effect is provided in the case of a\nseparable 2-body potential which binds at zero energy a light particle to a\nheavy one. The proof proceeds by two steps, namely {\\it i)} a projection of the\nHamiltonian in a subspace and the observation that the projected Hamiltonian\ngenerates an arbitrarily large number of bound states, and {\\it ii)} a use of\nthe Hylleraas-Undheim theorem to recover the unprojected Hamiltonian. The\ndefinition of the projectors we use can include mean field distortions.\n", "  The quasielastic longitudinal electromagnetic response function R_L is\nstudied within the context of a model that extends our previous investigations\nof pionic correlations and currents. Four mesons are now employed (pion, rho,\nsigma and omega, via the Bonn potential) and the many-body dynamics are\nextended to the full random-phase approximation built upon a Hartree-Fock\nbasis. Wherever possible the Lorentz covariance of the problem is respected.\nThe first three energy-weighted moments of the reduced response are computed,\nnamely, the zeroth moment (Coulomb sum rule), the first moment (related to the\nposition of the quasielastic peak) and the second moment (related to the peak\nwidth or variance). We discuss how with a modest downward adjustment of the\nFermi momentum it is possible to obtain the expected zeroth and second moments;\nthis implies that the nuclear system has a lower density than that required\nwhen using the free relativistic Fermi gas and accordingly that the interaction\neffects are weaker than one might initially find.\n", "  The calculation of the spreading width of a compound nuclear reaction caused\nby a symmetry breaking $K$-body force acting in an $A$-body system ($K << A$,\nusually $K=2$) involves the determination of the local average square matrix\nelement in $A$-body space. This problem is reduced to finding the global mean\nsquare matrix element $v^2$ in $K$-body space. The result is a compact formula\nfor the spreading width which contains $v^2$ as an input. Our method is based\non the dilute gas approximation for excitons close to the Fermi edge. The\nrelative strength of the contributions of operators with different exciton rank\nas well as the connection between the energy dependence of the spreading width\nand the body rank of the underlying interaction are established.\n", "  We propose a model that provides a unified description of nuclear equation of\nstate and fragmentations. The equation of state is evaluated in Bragg-Williams\nas well as in Bethe-Peierls approximations and compared with that in the mean\nfield theory with Skyrme interactions. The model shows a liquid-gas type phase\ntransition. The nuclear fragment distributions are studied for different\ndensities at finite temperatures. Power law behavior for fragments is observed\nat critical point. The study of fragment distribution and the second moment\n$S_2$ shows that the thermal critical point coincides with the percolation\npoint at the critical density. High temperature behavior of the model shows\ncharacteristics of chemical equilibrium.\n", "  We develop here a simple yet versatile model for nuclear fragmentation in\nheavy ion collisions. The model allows us to calculate thermodynamic properties\nsuch as phase transitions as well as the distribution of fragments at\ndisassembly. In spite of its simplicity the model gives very good fit to recent\ndata taken at the Michigan National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory. The\nmodel is an extension of a lattice gas model which itself has strong overlaps\nwith percolation models which have been used in the past to compare with\nnuclear fragmentation data.\n", "  The strength of final state interaction (FSI) between struck proton and\nspectator neutron in $^2\\vec{H}(e,e'p)$ scattering depends on the alignment of\nthe deuteron. We study the resulting FSI effects in the tensor analyzing power\nin detail and find substantial FSI effects starting at still low missing\nmomentum $p_m \\gsim 0.9 fm^{-1}$. At larger $p_m \\gsim 1.5 fm^{-1}$, FSI\ncompletely dominates both missing momentum distribution and tensor analyzing\npower. We find that to a large extent FSI masks the sensitivity of the tensor\nanalyzing power to models of the deuteron wave function. For the transversely\npolarized deuterons the FSI induced forward-backward asymmetry of the missing\nmomentum distribution is shown to have a node at precisely the same value of\n$p_m$ as the PWIA missing momentum distribution. The position of this node is\nnot affected by FSI and can be a tool to distinguish experimentally between\ndifferent models for the deuteron wave function.\n", "  A brief review of antiproton--nucleus physics is presented. Some topics are\nrelated to early LEAR experiments, and others to more recent measurements or\nproposals. These include: exotic molecules, elastic and inelastic scattering,\n  deep annihilation, strangeness production, neutron--antineutron oscillations,\nhalo nuclei, antiproton production in nuclear reactions etc.\n", "  The Glauber approximation is used to calculate the contribution of nucleon\ncorrelations in high-energy $A(e,e'N)$ reactions. When the excitation energy of\nthe residual nucleus is small, the increase of the nuclear transparency due to\ncorrelations between the struck nucleon and the other nucleons is mostly\ncompensated by a decrease of the transparency due to the correlations between\nnon detected nucleons. We derive Glauber model predictions for nuclear\ntransparency for the differential cross section when nuclear shell level\nexcitations are measured. The role of correlations in color transparency is\nbriefly discussed.\n", "  A relativistic Faddeev model for the baryon octet is extended to treat the\nbaryon decuplet. We find that after determining the model parameters in the\nmesonic sector the masses of both nucleon and delta deviate by less than 5\\%\nfrom the experimental data and show only a very weak dependence on the\nconstituent quark mass.\n", "  To analyse ultrarelativistic nuclear interactions, usually either dynamical\nmodels like the string model are employed, or a thermal treatment based on\nhadrons or quarks is applied. String models encounter problems due to high\nstring densities, thermal approaches are too simplistic considering only\naverage distributions, ignoring fluctuations. We propose a completely new\napproach, providing a link between the two treatments, and avoiding their main\nshortcomings: based on the string model, connected regions of high energy\ndensity are identified for single events, such regions referred to as quark\nmatter droplets. Each individual droplet hadronizes instantaneously according\nto the available n-body phase space. Due to the huge number of possible hadron\nconfigurations, special Monte Carlo techniques have been developed to calculate\nthis disintegration.\n", "  A nonrigid rotor model is developed from the two-parameter quantum algebra\n$U_{qp}({\\rm u}_2)$. [This model presents the $U_{qp}({\\rm u}_2)$ symmetry and\nshall be referred to as the qp-rotor model.] A rotational energy formula as\nwell as a qp-deformation of E2 reduced transition probabilities are derived.\nThe qp-rotor model is applied (through fitting procedures) to twenty rotational\nbands of superdeformed nuclei in the $A \\sim 130$, 150 and 190 mass regions.\nSystematic comparisons between the qp-rotor model and the q-rotor model of\nRaychev, Roussev and Smirnov, on one hand, and a basic three-parameter model,\non the other hand, are performed on energy spectra, on dynamical moments of\ninertia and on B(E2) values. The physical signification of the deformation\nparameters q and p is discussed.\n", "  The pseudo-spin symmetry is reviewed. A mapping that produces the separation\nof the total angular momentum into pseudo-orbital and pseudo-spin degrees of\nfreedom is discussed, together with the analytic transformations that take us\nfrom the normal parity space to the eigenstates of a pseudo-oscillator with one\nquanta less. The many-particle version of the unitary transformation to the\npseudo-SU(3) space is established. As an example, these symmetries are used to\ndescribe the double beta decay phenomenon in heavy deformed nuclei.\n", "  We use QCD sum rules to obtain the weak parity-violating pion-nucleon\ncoupling constant $f_{\\pi NN}$. We find that $f_{\\pi NN}\\approx 3\\times\n10^{-8}$, up to an order of magnitude smaller than the ``best estimates\" based\non quark models. This result follows from the cancellation between perturbative\nand nonperturbative QCD processes not found in quark models, but explicit in\nthe QCD sum rule method. Our result is consistent with the experimental upper\nlimit found from $^{18}$F parity-violating measurements.\n", "  A quasipotential formalism for elastic scattering from relativistic bound\nstates is based on applying an instant constraint to both initial and final\nstates in the Breit frame. This formalism is advantageous for the analysis of\nelectromagnetic interactions because current conservation and four momentum\nconservation are realized within a three-dimensional formalism. Wave functions\nare required in a frame where the total momentum is nonzero, which means that\nthe usual partial wave analysis is inapplicable. In this work, the\nthree-dimensional equation is solved numerically, taking into account the\nrelevant symmetries. A dynamical boost of the interaction also is needed for\nthe instant formalism, which in general requires that the boosted interaction\nbe defined as the solution of a four-dimensional equation. For the case of a\nscalar separable interaction, this equation is solved and the Lorentz\ninvariance of the three-dimensional formulation using the boosted interaction\nis verified. For more realistic interactions, a simple approximation is used to\ncharacterize the boost of the interaction.\n", "  Non-relativistic reduction of the S-matrix for the quasifree electron\nscattering process $A\\left(~e, e'p~\\right)A-1$ is studied in order to\nunderstand the source of differences between non-relativistic and relativistic\nmodels. We perform an effective Pauli reduction on the relativistic expression\nfor the S-matrix in the one-photon exchange approximation. The reduction is\napplied to the nucleon current only; the electrons are treated fully\nrelativistically. An expansion of the amplitude results in a power series in\nthe nuclear potentials. The series is found to converge rapidly only if the\nnuclear potentials are included in the nuclear current operator. The results\ncan be cast in a form which reproduces the non-relativistic amplitudes in the\nlimit that the potentials are removed from the nuclear current operator. Large\ndifferences can be found between calculations which do and do not include the\nnuclear potentials in the different orders of the nuclear current operator. In\nthe high missing momentum region we find that the non-relativistic calculations\nwith potentials included in the nuclear current up to second order give results\nwhich are close to those of the fully relativistic calculation. This behavior\nis an indication of the importance of the medium modifications of the nuclear\ncurrents in this model, which are naturally built into the relativistic\ntreatment of the reaction.\n", "  All the orbital M1 excitations, at both low and high energies, obtained from\na rotationally invariant QRPA, represent the fragmented scissors mode. The\nhigh-energy M1 strength is almost purely orbital and resides in the region of\nthe isovector giant quadrupole resonance. In heavy deformed nuclei the\nhigh-energy scissors mode is strongly fragmented between 17 and 25 MeV (with\nuncertainties arising from the poor knowledge of the isovector potential). The\ncoherent scissors motion is hindered by the fragmentation and $B(M1) < 0.25 \\;\n\\mu^2_N$ for single transitions in this region. The $(e,e^{\\prime})$ cross\nsections for excitations above 17 MeV are one order of magnitude larger for E2\nthan for M1 excitations even at backward angles.\n", "  We numerically analyze recent high energy heavy-ion collision experiments\nbased on a hydrodynamical model with phase transition and discuss a systematic\nchange of initial state of QGP-fluid depending on colliding-nuclei's mass. In a\nprevious paper, we formulated a (3+1)-dimensional hydrodynamical model for\nquark-gluon plasma with phase transition and discussed numerically the\nspace-time evolution in detail. We here compare the numerical solution with the\nhadronic distributions given by CERN WA80 and NA35. Systematic analyses of the\nexperiments with various colliding nuclei enable us to discuss the dependences\nof the initial parameters of the hydrodynamical model on colliding nuclei's\nmass. Furthermore, extrapolating the present experiments, we derive the\npossible hadronic distributions for lead-lead 150GeV/A collision.\n", "  Chiral effective lagrangians may differ in their prediction of meson-nucleon\nscattering amplitudes off-meson-mass-shell, but must yield identical S-matrix\nelements. We argue that the effective meson mass in nuclear matter obtained\nfrom chiral effective lagrangians is also unique. Off-mass-shell amplitudes\nobtained using the PCAC choice of pion field must therefore not be viewed as\nfundamental constraints on the dynamics, the determination of the effective\nmeson mass in nuclear matter or the possible existence of meson condensates in\nthe ground state of nuclear matter. This hypothesis is borne out by a\ncalculation of the effective mass in two commonly employed formulations of\nchiral perturbation theory which yield different meson-nucleon scattering\namplitudes off-meson-mass-shell.\n", "  We consider the rate at which energy is emitted by neutrinos from the dense\ninterior of neutron stars containing a Bose condensate of pions or kaons. The\nrates obtained are larger, by a factor of 2, than those found earlier, and are\nconsistent with those found for the direct Urca processes.\n", "  It is shown that the threshold productions of $\\pi^0 pp$, $\\pi^+ np$ and\n$\\pi^+ d$ from $pp$ collisions can be consistently described by a model\nconsisting of a pion s-wave rescattering and $N\\bar N$ pair-terms of\nheavy-meson exchanges. The large difference between $\\sigma^{tot}\n(pp\\rightarrow\\pi ^+ d)$ and $\\sigma^{tot} (pp\\rightarrow\\pi ^+ np)$ is\nunderstood from the orthogonality of the deuteron and the $np$ scattering wave\nfunctions. In a calculation using the Paris potential to account for the\ninitial and final $NN$ interactions, it is found that the data can be best\nreproduced by using a soft $\\pi NN$ form factor with $\\Lambda_{\\pi} =650 $ MeV\nfor a monopole form. This is consistent with an earlier study of pion\nproduction in the $\\Delta$ excitation region.\n", "  The isospin dependence of the spin-orbit potential is investigated for an\neffective Skyrme-like energy functional suitable for density dependent\nHartree-Fock calculations. The magnitude of the isospin dependence is obtained\nfrom a fit to experimental data on finite spherical nuclei. It is found to be\nclose to that of relativistic Hartree models. Consequently, the anomalous kink\nin the isotope shifts of Pb nuclei is well reproduced.\n", "  We investigate the disappearance of collective flow in the reaction plane in\nheavy-ion collisions within a microscopic model (QMD). A systematic study of\nthe impact parameter dependence is performed for the system Ca+Ca. The balance\nenergy strongly increases with impact parameter. Momentum dependent\ninteractions reduce the balance energies for intermediate impact parameters\n$b\\approx4.5$ fm. Dynamical negative flow is not visible in the laboratory\nframe but does exist in the contact frame for the heavy system Au+Au. For\nsemi-peripheral collisions of Ca+Ca with $b\\approx6.5$ fm a new two-component\nflow is discussed. Azimuthal distributions exhibit strong collectiv flow\nsignals, even at the balance energy.\n", "  We analyze relativistic effects in transverse momentum using Quantum\nMolecular Dynamics [QMD] and its covariant extension Relativistic Quantum\nMolecular Dynamics [RQMD]. The strength of the relativistic effects is found to\nincrease with the bombarding energy and with an averaged impact parameter. The\nvariation in the intensity of the relativistic effects with variation in the\nmass of the colliding nuclei is not systematic. Furthermore, the hard EOS is\naffected drastically by the relativistic effects whereas the soft EOS is\naffected less. Our analysis shows that up to the bombarding energy of 1\nGeV/nucl., the influence of relativistic effects is small. Whereas at higher\nenergies, relativistic effects become naturally very important.\n", "  Non-equilibrium effects are studied using a full Lorentz-invariant formalism.\nOur analysis shows that in reactions considered here, no global or local\nequilibrium is reached. The heavier masses are found to be equilibrated more\nthan the lighter systems. The local temperature is extracted using hot Thomas\nFermi formalism generalized for the case of two interpenetrating pieces of\nnuclear matter. The temperature is found to vary linearly with bombarding\nenergy and impact parameter whereas it is nearly independent of the mass of the\ncolliding nuclei. This indicates that the study of temperature with medium size\nnuclei is also reliable. The maximum temperatures obtained in our approach are\nin a nice agreement with earlier calculations of other approaches. A simple\nparametrization of maximal temperature as a function of the bombarding energy\nis also given.\n", "  Heavy ion collisions at intermediate energies are studied by using a new RQMD\ncode, which is a covariant generalization of the QMD approach. We show that\nthis new implementation is able to produce the same results in the\nnonrelativistic limit (i.e. 50MeV/nucl.) as the non-covariant QMD. Such a\ncomparison is not available in the literature. At higher energies (i.e. 1.5\nGeV/nucl. and 2 GeV/nucl.) RQMD and QMD give different results in respect to\nthe time evolution of the phase space, for example for the directed transverse\nflow. These differences show that consequences of a covariant description of\nheavy ion reactions within the framework of RQMD are existing even at\nintermediate energies.\n", "  A charge-symmetry-breaking nucleon-nucleon force due to the up-down quark\nmass difference is evaluated in the quark cluster model. It is applied to the\nshell-model calculation for the isovector mass shifts of isospin multiplets and\nthe isospin-mixing matrix elements in 1s0d-shell nuclei. We find that the\ncontribution of the quark mass difference effect is large and agrees with\nexperiment. This contribution may explain the Okamoto-Nolen-Schiffer anomaly,\nalternatively to the meson-mixing contribution, which is recently predicted to\nbe reduced by the large off-shell correction.\n", "  In a recent paper by C. J. Horowitz (Phys. Rev. C {\\bf 48}, 2920 (1993)) a\nheavy meson exchange is incorporated into threshold NN --> d pi to enhance the\ngrossly underestimated cross section. However, that calculation uses an\nunjustified assumption on the initial and final momenta, which causes an\noverestimate of this effect by a factor of 3--4. I point out that the inclusion\nof the Delta(1232) isobar increases the cross section significantly even at\nthreshold.\n", "  The few available data for the reactions $\\gamma p \\rightarrow K^{0}\n\\Sigma^{+}$ and $\\gamma n \\rightarrow K^{+} \\Sigma^{-}$ are compared to models\ndeveloped for the processes $\\gamma p \\rightarrow K^{+} \\Sigma^{0}$ and $\\gamma\np \\rightarrow K^{+} \\Lambda$. It is found that some of these phenomenological\nmodels overpredict the measurements by up to a factor of 100. Fitting the data\nfor all of these reactions leads to drastically reduced Born coupling\nconstants.\n", "  The S-wave scattering length for eta-N elastic scattering is extracted from\nthe S-wave T-matrix in a three coupled channel, multiresonance unitary model.\nResults are compared with values already reported in literature which are\nobtained applying multichannel, but single resonance -- no background models. A\ndispersion among the previously published values of the real part of the S-wave\nscattering length is observed. We demonstrate that the reported spread\noriginates from the strong sensitivity of the scattering length upon the small\nvariation of the used input resonance parameters. In addition, we show that\neta-N scattering length value obtained in single resonance -- no background\nmodels significantly increases if background term is added in a unitary way. We\nquestion the reliability of previously reported values based only on the single\nresonance -- no background models, and demonstrate that the value of the eta-N\nS-wave scattering length obtained in this publication is much more realistic\nbecause of the multiresonance and unitary approach.\n", "  The weak decay as well as the strong nucleon coupling constants of the\nisoscalar axial vector meson $f_1 (1285)$ are estimated within the octet quark\nmodel. It is shown that the empirical value for the coupling of $\\overline{s}s$\nquarkonium to nucleons can be understood by attributing the $f_1(1285)$-nucleon\ncoupling to the $a_0\\pi N$ triangle diagram.\n", "  We investigate the use of elastic and inelastic scatterings with secondary\nbeams of radioactive nuclei as a mean to obtain information on ground state\nproperties and transition matrix elements to continuum states. An eikonal model\nis developed for this purpose by using the folding potential. In particular we\ndiscuss possible signatures of halo wavefunctions in elastic and inelastic\nscattering experiments.\n", "  The extraction of the photodissociation cross sections of $^8B$ from Coulomb\ndissociation experiments is investigated. A careful study is done on the\ncontributions of the E1, E2 and M1 multipolarities to the breakup. A comparison\nwith the data of a recent experiment is performed. It is shown that the\nextraction of the radiative capture cross sections $^7Be(p,\\ \\gamma)^8B$ which\nare relevant for the solar neutrino problem is not affected appreciably by\nCoulomb reacceleration. A non-perturbative model is used for the purpose.\nEmphasis is put on the perspectives for future experiments which are planned at\nthe University of Notre Dame, RIKEN (Japan), and GSI (Germany). An analysis of\nthe total yields of ``photon-point\" processes in inelastic electron scattering\nis also done.\n", "  Based on QCD-inspired models for multiple jets production, we developed a\nMonte Carlo program to study jet and the associated particle production in high\nenergy $pp$, $pA$ and $AA$ collisions. The physics behind the program which\nincludes multiple minijet production, soft excitation, nuclear shadowing of\nparton distribution functions and jet interaction in dense matter is briefly\ndiscussed. A detailed description of the program and instructions on how to use\nit are given.\n", "  Using multiple scattering theory the scattering lengths of $\\eta$ mesons on\nhelium nuclei are calculated and checked against final state $\\eta$\ninteractions from the $pd \\rightarrow \\eta ^3$He and $dd \\rightarrow \\eta ^4$He\nreactions. The existence of an $\\eta^4$He quasibound state is indicated.\n", "  Within the Matsubara formalism we derive expressions for the pion self-energy\nand the two-pion propagator in a hot pion gas. These quantities are used to\nselfconsistently calculate the in-medium $\\pi\\pi$ amplitude beyond the\nquasiparticle approximation (QPA). The results are shown to differ\nsignificantly from QPA-based calculations. We also examine the impact of chiral\nconstraints on the $\\pi\\pi$ interaction in a chirally improved version of the\nJ\\\"ulich $\\pi\\pi$ model.\n", "  Atomic experiments bring meaningful and valuable information on fundamental\nsymmetries. The hypothesis of a large ($\\sim 100$ eV) P-odd weak matrix element\nbetween single-particle states in heavy nuclei is inconsistent with the results\nof atomic PNC experiments. Upper limits on CP-violation obtained in atomic and\nmolecular spectroscopy are as informative as those established in neutron\nphysics. Very strict upper limits on T-odd, P-even interactions\n(nucleon-nucleon, electron-nucleon, electron-electron, and $\\beta$-decay) are\nderived from the same atomic and neutron experiments.\n", "  In heavy nuclei there is a parametrical suppression, $\\;\\sim A^{-1/3}\\;$, of\nT-odd, P-odd matrix elements as compared to T-even, P-odd ones.\n", "  We analize two reactions: the electroproduction at small x and the Drell-Yan\nproduction by protons on nuclei. We show that nuclear shadowing in\nelectroproduction is larger if the virtuality of inter- mediate hadrons is\nproperly taken into account. In the Drell-Yan production, initial state\ninteractions of fast partons are included. With this input, the excess pion\ncontribution improves the description of data for both reactions.\n", "  There exists experimental evidence that a dibaryon resonance d' with quantum\nnumbers J^P=0^-,T=0 and mass 2065 MeV could be the origin of the narrow peak in\nthe (\\pi^+ ,\\pi^- ) double charge exchange cross--sections on nuclei. We\ninvestigate the six--quark system with these quantum--numbers within the\nconstituent quark model, with linear confinement, effective one--gluon exchange\nat short range and chiral interactions between quarks (\\pi and \\sigma\nexchange). We classify all possible six quark states with J^P=0^-,T=0, and with\nN=1 and N=3 harmonic oscillator excitations, using different reduction chains.\nThe six--quark Hamiltonian is diagonalized in the basis including the unique\nN=1 state and the 10 most important states from the N=3 shell. We find, that\nwith most of the possible sets of parameters, the mass of such a \"dibaryon\"\nlies above the N(939)+N^\\ast(1535) threshold. The only possibility to describe\nthe supposed d'(2065) in the present context is to reduce the confinement\nstrength to very small values, however at the expense of describing the\nnegative parity resonances N^\\ast. We also analyze the J^P=0^-,T=2,N=1\nsix--quark state.\n", "  We recently introduced new methods to study ultrarelativistic nuclear\nscattering by providing a link between the string model approach and a thermal\ndescription. The string model is used to provide information about fluctuations\nin energy density. Regions of high energy density are considered to be quark\nmatter droplets and treated macroscopically. At SPS energies, we find mainly\nmedium size droplets --- with energies up to few tens of GeV. A key issue is\nthe microcanonical treatment of individual quark matter droplets. Each droplet\nhadronizes instantaneously according to the available n-body phase space. Due\nto the huge number of possible hadron configurations, special Monte Carlo\ntechniques have been developed to calculate this disintegration. We present\nresults concerning the production of strange particles from such a\nhadronization as compared to string decay.\n", "  Rotation-induced time-odd components in the nuclear mean field are analyzed\nusing the Hartree-Fock cranking approach with effective interactions SIII,\nSkM*, and SkP. Identical dynamical moments ${{\\cal J}^{(2)}}$ are obtained for\npairs of superdeformed bands $^{151}$Tb(2)--$^{152}$Dy(1) and\n$^{150}$Gd(2)--$^{151}$Tb(1). The corresponding relative alignments strongly\ndepend on which time-odd mean-field terms are taken into account in the\nHartree-Fock equations.\n", "  The energies of $^{3}H$, $^{3}He$, and $^{4}He$ ground states, the\n${\\frac{3}{2}}^{-}$ and ${\\frac{1}{2}}^{-}$ scattering states of $^{5}He$, the\nground states of $^{6}He$, $^{6}Li$, and $^{6}Be$ and the $3^{+}$ and $0^{+}$\nexcited states of $^{6}Li$ have been accurately calculated with the Green's\nfunction Monte Carlo method using realistic models of two- and three-nucleon\ninteractions. The splitting of the $A=3$ isospin $T=\\frac{1}{2}$ and $A=6$\nisospin $T=1$, $J^{\\pi} = 0^{+}$ multiplets is also studied. The observed\nenergies and radii are generally well reproduced, however, some definite\ndifferences between theory and experiment can be identified.\n", "  The separated isovector spin-longitudinal and spin-transverse responses from\na recent (p,n) quasifree experiment at 494 MeV are analyzed in a Glauber theory\nframework up to two-step contributions. Nuclear correlations are treated in the\ncontinuum random phase approximation, accounting for the spreading width of the\nparticle-hole states. A good description of the spin-longitudinal response is\nachieved, hinting at some evidence of pionic effects in the quasielastic\nregion. The spin-transverse response is underestimated and we show that\nmultistep contributions, while sizable, are not sufficient to provide an\nexplanation of the discrepancy.\n", "  Based on the Kaplan-Nelson Lagrangian, we investigate kaon condensation in\ndense neutron star matter allowing for the explicit presence of hyperons. Using\nvarious models we find that the condensate threshold is sensitive to the\nbehavior of the scalar density; the more rapidly it increases with baryon\ndensity, the lower is the threshold for condensation. The presence of hyperons,\nparticularly the $\\Sigma^-$, shifts the threshold for $K^-$ condensation to a\nhigher density. In the mean field approach, with hyperons, the condensate\namplitude grows sufficiently rapidly that the nucleon effective mass vanishes\nat a finite density and a satisfactory treatment of the thermodynamics cannot\nbe achieved. Thus, calculations of kaon-baryon interactions beyond the mean\nfield level appear to be necessary.\n", "  We investigate the relationship between the covariant and the\nthree-dimensional (equal-time) formulations of quantum kinetic theory. We show\nthat the three-dimensional approach can be obtained as the energy average of\nthe covariant formulation. We illustrate this statement in scalar and spinor\nQED. For scalar QED we derive Lorentz covariant transport and constraint\nequations directly from the Klein-Gordon equation rather than through the\npreviously used Feshbach-Villars representation. We then consider pair\nproduction in a spatially homogeneous but time-dependent electric field and\nshow that the pair density is derived much more easily via the energy averaging\nmethod than in the equal-time representation. Proceeding to spinor QED, we\nderive the covariant version of the equal-time equation derived by\nBialynicki-Birula et al. We show that it must be supplemented by another\nself-adjoint equation to obtain a complete description of the covariant spinor\nWigner operator. After spinor decomposition and energy average we study the\nclassical limit of the resulting three-dimensional kinetic equations. There are\nonly two independent spinor components in this limit, the mass density and the\nspin density, and we derive also their covariant equations of motion. We then\nshow that the equal-time kinetic equation provides a complete description only\nfor constant external electromagnetic fields, but is in general incomplete. It\nmust be supplemented by additional constraints which we derive explicitly from\nthe covariant formulation.\n", "  We review the accomplishments of nuclear theory during the past five years\nand identify the future challenges and research opportunities. [Final,\nsubstantially revised version of the nuclear theory white paper]\n", "  Some problems in nuclear astrophysics are discussed with emphasize on the\nones central to the field which were not solved over the last two decades,\nincluding Helium Burning in Massive stars (the 12C(a,g)16O reaction) and the 8B\nSolar Neutrino Flux Problem (the 7Be(p,g)8B reaction). We demonstrate that a\ngreat deal of progress was achieved by measuring the time reverse process(es):\nthe beta-delayed alpha-particle emission of 16N and the Coulomb dissociation of\n8B, using radioactive beams (of 16N and 8B). In this way an amplification of\nthe sought for cross section was achieved, allowing a measurement of the small\ncross section(s) of relevance for stellar (solar) process(es).\n", "  The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients of $SU(3)$ are useful in calculations\ninvolving baryons and mesons, as well as in calculations involving arbitrary\nnumbers of quarks. For the latter case, one needs the coupling constants\nbetween states of nonintegral hypercharges. The existing published tables are\ninsufficient for many such applications, and therefore we have compiled this\ncollection. This report supplies the isoscalar factors required to reconstruct\nthe Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for a large set of products of representations.\n", "  Nucleon correlations in the target and projectile nuclei are shown to reduce\nsignificantly the fluctuations in multiple nucleon-nucleon collisions, total\nmultiplicity and transverse energy in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, in\nparticular for heavy projectile and target. The interplay between cross-section\nfluctuations, from color transparency and opacity, and nuclear correlations is\ncalculated and found to be able to account for large fluctuations in transverse\nenergy spectra. Numerical implementation of correlations and cross-section\nfluctuations in Monte-Carlo codes is discussed.\n", "  In this report we will discuss properties of and models for nuclear\ntransitions in muonic molecules formed via collisions of muonic atoms of\nhydrogen isotopes with light nuclei like $L\\!i$ and $B\\!e$. Their importance\nfor nuclear astrophysics and nuclear physics at super low energies is\nemphasized.\n", "  We compute the cross section for the charged-current reaction ${}^{12}{\\rm\nC}(\\nu_{\\mu},\\mu^{-})$ near threshold using a relativistic mean-field\nformalism. A reduced value of the nucleon mass in the medium --- coupled to the\nfinite muon mass --- leads to a 30\\% reduction in the cross section relative to\na free Fermi-gas estimate. Isovector RPA correlations, which are strongly\nrepulsive at these momentum transfers, reduce the cross section by an\nadditional 15-30\\%. Hence, relativistic nuclear-structure effects can account\nfor the more than a factor-of-two reduction in the cross section recently\nreported by the LSND collaboration.\n", "  The 1/$N$ expansion solutions for the interacting boson model are extended to\nhigher orders using computer algebra. The analytic results are compared with\nthose obtained from an exact diagonalization of the Hamiltonian and are shown\nto be very accurate. The extended formulas for level energies and E2\ntransitions will be useful in the analysis of high-spin states in both normal\nand superdeformed nuclei.\n", "  We employ a relativistic quark bag picture, the chromo-dielectric soliton\nmodel, to discuss the quarks' symmetry structure and momentum distribution in\nthe $N$-$N$ system. Six-quark clusters are constructed in a constrained\nmean-field calculation. The corresponding Hamiltonian contains not only an\neffective interaction between the quarks and a scalar field, which is assumed\nto parameterize all non-perturbative effects due to the non-linearity of QCD,\nbut also quark-quark interactions mediated through one-gluon-exchange. We also\nevaluate the quark light-cone distribution functions, characterizing inclusive\ndeep-inelastic lepton scattering, for the nucleon as well as for the six-quark\nstructures. We find a competition between a softening of the quarks' momenta\nthrough the increase of the confinement volume, and a hardening via the\nadmixture of higher symmetry configurations due to the color-electrostatic\none-gluon-exchange. These findings suggest an unexpected absence of\nmany-nucleon, multi-quark effects, even though six-quark structures should\nrepresent a non-negligible part of the nuclear ground state.\n", "  We propose a method to extract nuclear charge distributions from elastic\nelectron scattering data based upon a mean field approach. The nuclear charge\ndistributions are generated by solving the Schroedinger equation with a\nmean-field potential expanded in terms of Hermite functions. The coefficients\nof the potential are changed in order to obtain the best fit with the cross\nsection data. Applications to the $^{12}C$, $^{16}O$ $^{40}Ca$ and $^{208}Pb$\nnuclei are presented.\n", "  The question whether mean field effects exist in heavy-ion collisions at AGS\nenergies is studied in the framework of A Relativistic Transport (ART) model.\nIt is found that in central collisions of Au+Au at $P_{beam}/A=$11.6 GeV/c a\nsimple, Skyrme-type nuclear mean field satisfying the causality requirement\nreduces the maximum baryon and energy densities reached in the cascade model by\nabout 30\\% and 40\\%, respectively. The mean field affects the inclusive, single\nparticle observables of various hadrons by at most 20\\%. We show, however, that\nthe mean field causes a factor of 2.5 increase in the strength of the baryon\ntransverse collective flow.\n", "  We review the status of a Fubini-Furlan-Rossetti sum rule for the\nphotoproduction of pions from nucleons, indicating how well this sum rule is\nsatisfied using a recent analysis of pion photoproduction data. Our results are\ndiscussed in light of a recent paper comparing the Gerasimov-Drell-Hearn and\nspin-dependent polarizability sum rules.\n", "  A general expression of the hard thermal loop gluon propagator is given for a\nvariety of abelian gauge fixing conditions (Coulomb gauge, axial gauge,\ncovariant gauge, temporal gauge ...) The current --- current interaction\nenergy, in particular the Coulomb energy, is shown to be independent of the\ngauge fixing condition (not only of the parameter).\n", "  Effective photon-photon luminosities are calculated for various realistic\nhadron collider scenarios. The main characteristics of photon-photon processes\nat relativistic heavy-ion colliders are established and compared to the\ncorresponding photon-photon luminosities at electron-positron and future Photon\nLinear Colliders (PLC). Higher order corrections as well as inelastic processes\nare discussed. It is concluded that feasible high luminosity Ca-Ca collisions\nat the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) are an interesting option for photon-photon\nphysics up to about 100 GeV photon-photon CM energy.\n", "  A precise variational solution to $N$=2--6-body problems is reported. The\ntrial wave functions are chosen to be combinations of correlated Gaussians,\nwhich facilitate a fully analytical calculation of the matrix elements. The\nnonlinear parameters of the trial function are selected by a stochastic method.\nFermionic and bosonic few-body systems are investigated for interactions of\ndifferent type. A comparison of the results with those available in the\nliterature shows that the method is both accurate and efficient.\n", "  The longitudinal and transverse structure functions are calculated for\ninclusive electron scattering from ${}^{12}$C and ${}^{40}$Ca in the\nquasielastic and dip region. The microscopic model presented here incorporates\ntwo-body currents derived from one-pion exchange and intermediate $\\Delta$\nexcitation. The reaction mechanism involves both one-nucleon and two-nucleon\nknockout processes. It is demonstrated that, even for quasielastic kinematics,\ntwo-body currents give a substantial contribution to the transverse structure\nfunction. Furthermore, the observed excess of transverse strength in the dip\nregion between the quasielastic and delta peak can be partially ascribed to\ndirect two-nucleon knockout following photoabsorption on a two-body current.\n", "  The momentum-space cut-off parameter $\\Lambda$ of hadronic vertex functions\nis studied in this paper. We use a composite model where we can measure the\ncontributions of intermediate particle propagations to $\\Lambda$. We show that\nin many cases a composite vertex function has a much smaller cut-off than its\nconstituent vertices, particularly when light constituents such as pions are\npresent in the intermediate state. This suggests that composite\nmeson-baryon-baryon vertex functions are rather soft, i.e., they have \\Lambda\nconsiderably less than 1 GeV. We discuss the origin of this softening of form\nfactors as well as the implications of our findings on the modeling of nuclear\nreactions.\n", "  The real part of the $K^{+}$ selfenergy for the interaction of the $K^{+}$\nwith the pion nuclear cloud is evaluated in lowest order of chiral perturbation\ntheory and is found to be exactly zero in symmetric nuclear matter. This\nremoves uncertainties in that quantity found in former phenomenological\nanalyses and is supported by present experimental data on $K^{+}$ nucleus\nscattering.\n", "  Diffusion coefficients are obtained from linear response functions and from\nthe quantal fluctuation dissipation theorem. They are compared with the results\nof both the theory of hydrodynamic fluctuations by Landau and Lifschitz as well\nas the Boltzmann-Langevin theory. Sum rules related to conservation laws for\ntotal particle number, momentum and energy are demonstrated to hold true for\nfluctuations and diffusion coefficients in the quantum case.\n", "  The driving terms in three-body theories of elastic and inelastic scattering\nof a charged particle off a bound state of two other charged particles contain\nthe fully off-shell two-body Coulomb T-matrix describing the intermediate-state\nCoulomb scattering of the projectile with each of the charged target particles.\nUp to now the latter is usually replaced by the Coulomb potential, either when\nusing the multiple-scattering approach or when solving three-body integral\nequations. General properties of the exact and the approximate on-shell driving\nterms are discussed, and the accuracy of this approximation is investigated\nnumerically, both for atomic and nuclear processes including bound-state\nexcitation, for energies below and above the corresponding three-body\ndissociation threshold, over the whole range of scattering angles.\n", "  We argue that, prior to the recent GALLEX $^{51}$Cr source experiment, the\nexcited state contributions to the $^{71}$Ga capture cross section for\n$^{51}$Cr and $^7$Be neutrinos were poorly constrained, despite forward-angle\n(p,n) measurements. We describe the origin of the uncertainties and estimate\ntheir extent. We explore the implications of the source experiment for solar\nneutrino capture in light of these uncertainties. A reanalysis of the $^7$Be\nand $^8$B flux constraints and MSW solutions of the solar neutrino puzzle is\npresented.\n", "  The effects of short-range correlations derived from a realistic\nmeson-exchange potential on the single-particle density matrix in finite nuclei\nare investigated by analyzing the one-body density in terms of the natural\norbits. Basic features of these natural orbits and their spectral distributions\nare discussed. For many observables it seems to be sufficient to approximate\nthe one-body density matrix in terms of those natural orbits, which exhibit the\nlargest occupation probabilities. For the investigation of the high-momentum\ncomponents in the single-particle density, however, it is important to take\ninto account natural orbits with small occupation probabilities, originating\nfrom the single-particle Green function at large negative energies.\n", "  We use multiple scattering theory to evaluate the $Q^{2}$ dependence\n  of the forward-backward asymmetry, $A_{z}$, of the missing momentum\ndistribution in quasielstic $A(e,e'p)$ scattering, which is expected to be\naffected by color transparency. The novel features of our analysis are a\nconsistent treatment of the structure of the ejectile state formed after\nabsorption of the virtual photon by the struck proton and a careful evaluation\nof the background asymmetry induced by the nonvanishing real part of the\nproton-nucleon scattering amplitude. We find that the absolute magnitude of\n$A_{z}$ is dominated by this background at the $Q^{2}$'s attainable at the\nContinuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility. However, the $Q^{2}$ dependence\nof the asymmetry is sensitive to the onset of color transparency, whose\nobservation in high statistics experiments appears to be feasible, particularly\nusing light targets such as $^{12}C$ or $^{16}O$.\n", "  A proof is given for the explicit representations which have been formulated\nin the author's previous work (nucl-th/9505028) for the Faddeev components of\nthree-body T-matrix continued analytically on unphysical sheets of the energy\nRiemann surface. Also, the analogous representations for analytical\ncontinuation of the three-body scattering matrices and resolvent are proved. An\nalgorithm to search for the three-body resonances on the base of the Faddeev\ndifferential equations is discussed.\n", "  In this paper, we present our study on the $\\eta$ photoproduction based on\nthe chiral quark model. We find that quark model provides a very good\ndescription of the $\\eta$ production with much less parameters, and the\nthreshold region is not a reliable source to determine the $\\eta NN$ coupling\nconstant due to its strong dependence on the properties of the resonance\n$S_{11}(1535)$. We suggest that the systematic data in $E_{lab}=1.2 \\sim 1.4$\nGeV region may help us to determine the $\\eta NN$ coupling constant more\nprecisely.\n  The structure of the resonance $S_{11}(1535)$ is discussed, we find that the\nrecent data from Mainz group bring the helicity amplitude much closer to the\nquark model prediction. However, more studies need to be done to understand the\nlarge $\\eta N$ branching ratio of the resonance $S_{11}(1535)$. Our results\nshow that the quark model is a very good approach to study the underlying\nstructure of baryon resonances from the meson photoproduction data.\n", "  The neutron direct radiative capture (DRC) process is investigated,\nhighlighting the role of incident p-wave neutrons. A set of calculations is\nshown for the 12-C(n,gamma) process at incoming neutron energies up to 500 keV,\na crucial region for astrophysics. The cross section for neutron capture\nleading to loosely bound s, p and d orbits of 13-C is well reproduced by the\nDRC model demonstrating the feasibility of using this reaction channel to study\nthe properties of nuclear wave functions on and outside the nuclear surface. A\nsensitivity analysis of the results on the neutron-nucleus interaction is\nperformed for incident s- as well as p-waves. It turned out that the DRC cross\nsection for p-wave neutrons is insensitive to this interaction, contrary to the\ncase of incident s-wave neutrons.\n  PACS number(s): 25.40Lw,21.10Gv,23.40.Hc\n", "  An analysis of all possible polarization observables for the case of vector\nmeson photoproduction from a nucleon target is presented. The question of which\nobservables are needed to determine completely the basic photoproduction\namplitudes and the relationships between spin observables are addressed.\n", "  The cross section for the reaction $dd\\rightarrow \\,^4\\!H\\!e\\,\\eta$ close to\nthreshold is estimated in a two-step model, similar to that which successfully\ndescribes near-threshold $pd\\rightarrow \\,^3\\!H\\!e\\,\\eta$ production. A\n$\\pi$-meson, created in a $dp\\rightarrow \\,^3\\!H\\!e\\,\\pi^o$ process on one\nnucleon in the target deuteron, is converted into an $\\eta$-meson by a\nsecondary $\\pi^o n \\to n\\,\\eta$ reaction on the other nucleon. The kinematics\nare such that both processes are nearly physical so that only small Fermi\nmomenta are required. The predictions of the model are in good agreement with\nrecent Saclay experimental data.\n  An analogous model, when applied to the near-threshold\n$n\\,^3\\!H\\!e\\rightarrow \\,^4\\!H\\!e\\,\\eta$ reaction, predicts a cross section of\na rather similar size, but experimental difficulties render this a doubtful\nmeans of studying the $\\eta\\, ^4\\!H\\!e$ interaction.\n", "  From the new Mainz data of eta photoproduction off protons\\cite{ref1} and\ndeuterons\\cite{ref2}, we can extract, via the effective Lagrangian approach\n(ELA)\\cite{ref3}, the electrostrong parameters $\\xi_{p}$ and $\\xi_{n}$ for the\nN$^*$(1535) excitation. These parameters are, in units of $10^{-4} MeV^{-1}$,\n$(2.20\\pm 0.15)$ and $(-1.86\\pm 0.20)$ respectively. They yield the ratio of\nthe helicity amplitudes for the excitation of N$^*$(1535) by photons off\nneutrons and protons to be $A^{n}_{1/2}/A^{p}_{1/2}=-0.84\\pm 0.15$, a quantity\nof fundamental importance in the baryon structure. Best estimates in the quark\nmodel are close to this ratio.\n", "  An extended version of the Zimanyi-Moskowski (ZM) model has been used to\ncalculate the temperature dependence of the hadronic masses. The calculation of\nmeson masses in the Random Phase Approximation (RPA) gives an increase in the\n$\\sigma$, $\\omega$ and $\\pi$ effective masses with temperature.\n", "  An analysis is performed of the liquid-gas phase transition of nuclear matter\nobtained from different versions of scalar derivate coupling suggested by\nZimanyi and Moszkowski (ZM) and the results are compared with those obtained\nfrom the Walecka model. We present the phase diagram for the models and one of\nthem, the ZM3 model, has the lowest critical temperature $T_c=13.6$ MeV with\nthe lowest critical density $\\rho_c=0.037$ f$m^{-3}$ and pressure $p_c=0.157$\nMeV f$m^{-3}$.\n  These results are in accord with recent observations from energetic heavy-ion\ncollisions, which suggest a small liquid-gas phase region.\n", "  The role of dynamics in spin observables for pseudoscalar meson\nphotoproduction is investigated using a density matrix approach in a multipole\ntruncated framework. Extraction of novel rules for $\\gamma p \\rightarrow \\pi^+\nn,~ K^+ \\Lambda$ and $\\eta p$ reactions based on resonance dominance, and on\nother broad and reasonable dynamical assumptions, are discussed. Observables\nthat are particularly sensitive to missing nucleonic resonances predicted by\nquark-based approaches, are singled out.\n", "  We present a microscopic study of halo nuclei, starting from the Paris and\nBonn potentials and employing a two-frequency shell model approach. It is found\nthat the core-polarization effect is dramatically suppressed in such nuclei.\nConsequently the effective interaction for halo nucleons is almost entirely\ngiven by the bare G-matrix alone, which presently can be evaluated with a high\ndegree of accuracy. The experimental pairing energies between the two halo\nneutrons in $^6$He and $^{11}$Li nuclei are satisfactorily reproduced by our\ncalculation. It is suggested that the fundamental nucleon-nucleon interaction\ncan be probed in a clearer and more direct way in halo nuclei than in ordinary\nnuclei.\n", "  We compare the recent CERES data on dielectron production in 200 GeV/u S+Au\ncollisions with the theoretical predictions due to pion annihilation in a\nthermal hadronization and a string fragmentation scenario. Both models yield\nsimilar results for the dilepton mass spectrum. A satisfactory description of\nthe experimental spectrum requires an in-medium reduction of the rho-mass and a\nfreeze-out temperature of about 150 MeV in the thermal model. We emphasize and\ndiscuss the influence of experimental acceptance and resolution corrections.\n", "  We discuss the stability of multiquark systems within the recent model of\nGlozman et al. where the chromomagnetic hyperfine interaction is replaced by\npseudoscalar-meson exchange. We find that such an interaction binds a heavy\ntetraquark system $QQ\\bar q\\bar q$ ($Q=c, b$ and $q=u, d)$ by $0.2-0.4$ GeV.\nThis is at variance with results of previous models where $cc\\bar q\\bar q$ is\nunstable.\n", "  Color transparency is the vanishing of initial and final state interactions,\npredicted by QCD to occur in high momentum transfer quasielastic nuclear\nreactions. For specific reactions involving nucleons, the initial and final\nstate interactions are expected to be dominated by exchanges of pions. We argue\nthat these interactions are also suppressed in high momentum transfer nuclear\nquasielastic reactions; this is ``chiral transparency\". We show that studies of\nthe $e ^3He \\to e'\\Delta^{++} nn$ reaction could reveal the influence of chiral\ntransparency.\n", "  We investigate the production of pions in heavy-ion collisions in the energy\nrange of $1$ - $2$ GeV/A. The dynamics of the nucleus-nucleus collisions is\ndescribed by a set of coupled transport equations of the\nBoltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck type for baryons and mesons. Besides the $N(938)$\nand the $\\Delta(1232)$ we also take into account nucleon resonances up to\nmasses of $1.9 GeV/c^2$ as well as $\\pi$-, $\\eta$- and $\\rho$-mesons. We study\nin detail the influence of the higher baryonic resonances and the\n$2\\pi$-production channels ($NN\\to NN \\pi\\pi$) on the pion spectra in\ncomparison to $\\pi^-$ data from $Ar + KCl$ collisions at $1.8$ GeV/A and\n$\\pi^0$-data for $Au+Au$ at 1.0 GeV/A. We, furthermore, present a detailed\ncomparison of differential pion angular distributions with the BEVALAC data for\nAr + KCl at 1.8 GeV/A. The general agreement obtained indicates that the\noverall reactions dynamics is well described by our novel transport approach.\n", "  The production of antiprotons in $pp$ collisions is investigated close to\nthreshold where experimental data about the total cross section are not\navailable. We analyze the latter reaction within the LUND string model for\ninclusive $\\bar{p}$ production and within the framework of a one-boson exchange\nmodel for the exclusive reaction $pp \\rightarrow ppp\\bar{p}$. The application\nof our new results to the analysis of subthreshold antiproton production in $d\n+ p$ and $d + d$ collisions shows cross sections that are much lower than\nexpected before. Nevertheless, the comparison of experimental $\\bar{p}$\ndifferential cross sections from $d +p$ and $d + d$ is expected to provide\nvaluable information about a nonnucleonic component in the deuteron\nwavefunction.\n", "  We have carried out a first calculation of $J/\\Psi$ production from nuclear\ncollisions within the covariant transport approach HSD, which has been very\nsuccessful in describing both hadronic and electromagnetic observables from\nheavy-ion collisions at intermediate and high energies. The production of\n$J/\\Psi$'s is based on the Lund string fragmentation model, while its\ninteractions with hadrons are included by conventional cascade-type two-body\ncollisions. Adopting 6 mb for the $J/\\Psi$-baryon cross sections and 3 mb for\nthe $J/\\Psi$-meson cross sections above the $D\\bar{D}$ threshold, we find that\ndata on $J/\\Psi$ suppression from both proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus\ncollisions (including Pb + Pb) can be explained without assuming the formation\nof a quark-gluon plasma in these collisions. Our microscopic studies thus\nconfirm the suggestion of Gavin et al. that $J/\\Psi$ suppression observed in\nnuclear collisions is largely due to absorption by comovers, i.e., the produced\nmesons.\n", "  We carry out a study of the study of the $Q \\cdot Q$ interaction in a model\nspace which consists of several nucleons in an open shell and all $2 \\hbar\n\\omega$ excitations. This interaction is $ -t (X_o/2) Q \\cdot Q$, where for t=1\nwe get the `accepted strength'. In the $0p$ space, the spectrum would scale\nwith $t$. In this space, the $2^+_1$ and $2^+_2$ states of $^{10}$Be are\ndegenerate, as are the [330] and [411] sets of $J=0^+, 1^+$ and $2^+$ triplets.\nWhen $2 \\hbar \\omega$ admixtures are included, the degeneracies are removed.\nFor $t \\geq 1.8$ we have new ground state and a new $2_1^+$ state. These are\nstates in which two particles are excited from the $0p$ to the $1s-0d$ shell.\nThere is no mixing of these 2p-2h states with the other states. For these 2p-2h\nstates the occupancy for 0s,0p,1s-0d and 1p-of are 4,4,2 and 0 respectively.\n", "  Measurements of $\\psi$ and $\\psi'$ production at the CERN SPS are compared to\npredictions based on a hadronic model of charmonium suppression. Detailed\ninformation is presented to facilitate comparison to other analyses.\nSensitivity of these conclusions to the model parameters is discussed.\n", "  Spontaneous-fission half-lives of the heaviest even-even nuclei are evaluated\nand compared with their alpha-decay mode. Calculations of spontaneous-fission\nhalf-lives are performed in the dynamical way with potential energy obtained by\nthe macroscopic-microscopic method and the inertia tensor obtained by the\ncranking approximation. The alpha-decay half-lives are calculated for the same\nregion of nuclei by use of the Viola and Seaborg formula. The ground-state\nproperties such as mean square radii and electric quadrupole moments are also\nstudied. From the analysis of spontaneous-fission half-life values it is found\nthat a peninsula of deformed metastable superheavy nuclei near Z=106 and N=162\nis separated from an island of the spherical superheavy, around the doubly\nmagic nucleus with Z=114 and N=184, by a trench in the vicinity of neutron\nnumber N=170.\n", "  We compute as a function of rapidity $y$ the baryon number carried by quarks\nand antiquarks with $p_T > p_0 \\approx$ 2 GeV produced in Pb+Pb collisions at\nTeV energies. The computation is carried out in lowest order QCD perturbation\ntheory using structure functions compatible with HERA results. At $p_0=2$ GeV\nthe initial gluon density is both transversally saturated and thermalised in\nthe sense that the energy/gluon equals to that of an ideal gas with the same\nenergy density. Even at these high energies the initial net baryon number\ndensity at $y=0$ at $\\tau=0.1$ fm will be more than the normal nuclear matter\ndensity but the baryon-to-entropy ratio is only $(B-\\bar B)/S\\sim 1/5000$.\nFurther evolution of the system is discussed and the final baryon-to-entropy\nratio is estimated.\n", "  It is shown that the representation transformations of multiquark wave\nfunctions between different coupling schemes are just the Racah coefficients of\nthe permutation group. The transformation coefficients between the flavor-spin\n(FS) and the color-spin (CS) schemes are obtained. As an example, the expansion\nof the physical bases in terms of symmetry bases in the CS scheme are given for\nthe interesting cases $YIJ = 201, 210, 000$.\n", "  Interferometry is discussed in terms of the representation of the source. In\nparticular, scale-invariant 1-d hydrodynamics is revisited, and extended to the\ncase of unequal transverse masses. It is argued that that kaon emission occurs\nover a short time interval. Exact results for models of two- and\nthree-dimensional flow are presented, which exhibit altered scaling laws. Such\nqualitative trends, together with other observables, are vital if one is to\ndraw conclusions about the source.\n", "  Two-body interactions of elementary particles are useful in particle and\nnuclear physics to describe qualitatively and quantitatively few- and many-body\nsystems. We are extending for this purpose the quantum inversion approach for\nsystems consisting of nucleons and mesons. From the wide range of\nexperimentally studied two-body systems we concentrate here on $\\pi N$,\n$\\pi\\pi$, $K^+N$, $K \\pi$ and $K\\bar{K}$. As input we require results of phase\nshift analyses. Quantum inversion Gelfand-Levitan and Marchenko single and\ncoupled channel algorithms are used for Schr\\\"odinger type wave equations in\npartial wave decomposition. The motivation of this study comes from our two\napproaches: to generate and investigate potentials directly from data by means\nof inversion and alternatively use linear and nonlinear boson exchange models.\nThe interesting results of inversion are coordinate space informations about\nradial ranges, strengths, long distance behaviors, resonance characteristics,\nthreshold effects, scattering lengths and bound state properties.\n", "  We present a chiral-invariant meson-baryon Lagrangian which describes the\ninteractions of the baryon octet with the lowest-mass meson nonets. The\nnonlinear realization of the chiral symmetry generates pair-meson interaction\nvertices. The corresponding pair-meson coupling constants can all be expressed\nin terms of the meson-nucleon-nucleon pseudovector, scalar, and vector coupling\nconstants, and their corresponding $F/(F+D)$ ratios, and for which empirical\nestimates are given. We show that it is possible to construct an NN potential\nof reasonable quality satisfying these theoretical and empirical constraints.\n", "  The total cross section for the pp to pp $\\pi^0$ reaction at energies close\nto threshold is calculated in a covariant one-boson-exchange model. The\namplitudes for the elementary BN to N$\\pi^0$ processes are taken to be the sum\nof s, u and t pole terms. The main contributions to the primary\nproductionamplitude is due to a sigma meson exchange. Both the scale and energy\ndependence of the cross section are perfectly reproduced.\n", "  The most consistently useful simple model for the study of odd deformed\nnuclei, the particle-rotor model (strong coupling limit of the core-particle\ncoupling model) has nevertheless been beset by a long-standing problem: It is\nnecessary in many cases to introduce an ad hoc parameter that reduces the size\nof the Coriolis interaction coupling the collective and single-particle\nmotions. Of the numerous suggestions put forward for the origin of this\nsupplementary interaction, none of those actually tested by calculations has\nbeen accepted as the solution of the problem. In this paper we seek a solution\nof the difficulty within the framework of a general formalism that starts from\nthe spherical shell model and is capable of treating an arbitrary linear\ncombination of multipole and pairing forces. With the restriction of the\ninteraction to the familiar sum of a quadrupole multipole force and a monopole\npairing force, we have previously studied a semi-microscopic version of the\nformalism whose framework is nevertheless more comprehensive than any\npreviously applied to the problem. We obtained solutions for low-lying bands of\nseveral strongly deformed odd rare earth nuclei and found good agreement with\nexperiment, except for an exaggerated staggering of levels for K=1/2 bands,\nwhich can be understood as a manifestation of the Coriolis attenuation problem.\nWe argue that within the formalism utilized, the only way to improve the\nphysics is to add interactions to the model Hamiltonian. We verify that by\nadding a magnetic dipole interaction of essentially fixed strength, we can fit\nthe K=1/2 bands without destroying the agreement with other bands. In addition\nwe show that our solution also fits 163Er, a classic test case of Coriolis\nattenuation that we had not previously studied.\n", "  In order to explore the consequences of the neutrino irradiation for the\nsupernova r-process nucleosynthesis, we calculate the rates of charged-current\nand neutral-current neutrino reactions on neutron-rich heavy nuclei, and\nestimate the average number of neutrons emitted in the resulting spallation.\nOur results suggest that charged-current $\\nu_e$ captures can be important in\nbreaking through the waiting-point nuclei at N=50 and 82, while still allowing\nthe formation of abundance peaks. Furthermore, after the r-process freezes out,\nthere appear to be distinctive neutral-current and charged-current\npostprocessing effects. A subtraction of the neutrino postprocessing effects\nfrom the observed solar r-process abundance distribution shows that two mass\nregions, A=124-126 and 183-187, are inordinately sensitive to neutrino\npostprocessing effects. This imposes very stringent bounds on the freeze-out\nradii and dynamic timescales governing the r-process. Moreover, we find that\nthe abundance patterns within these mass windows are entirely consistent with\nsynthesis by neutrino interactions. This provides a strong argument that the\nr-process must occur in the intense neutrino flux provided by a core-collapse\nsupernova.\n", "  We review the theory of hard exclusive scattering in Quantum Chromodynamics.\nAfter recalling the classical counting rules which describe the leading scale\ndependence of form factors and exclusive cross-sections at fixed angle, the\npedagogical example of the pion form factor is developped in some detail in\norder to show explicitely what factorization means in the QCD framework. The\npicture generalizes to many hard reactions which are at the heart of the ELFE\nproject. We briefly present the concepts of color transparency.\n", "  Helicity amplitudes for the $\\gamma^* N \\to \\Delta$ transition are calculated\nusing the cloudy bag model. A correction for center-of-mass motion is carried\nout using a modified Peierls-Thouless projection method. This reduces the\nmagnitude of the transition amplitudes at small momentum transfer and enhances\nthem at modest momentum transfers. Our calculation shows that the pion cloud\ncontributes substantially to the transition helicity amplitudes, with the final\nresult giving reasonable agreement with the corresponding experimental values.\n", "  We study the \\gamma^* N -> \\Delta transition amplitudes in a recoil corrected\ncloudy bag model approach. A modified Peierls-Thouless projection method is\nused to construct the Galilean invariant baryon states. The pionic contribution\nis found to be significant. The effect of the recoil correction is to reduce\nthe magnitude of the transition amplitudes at small momentum transfer and to\nenhance them at modest momentum transfers.\n", "  The production of low mass dileptons and soft photons from thermalized Quark\nGluon Plasma (QGP) and hadronic matter in relativistic heavy ion collisions is\nevaluated. A boost invariant longitudinal and cylindrically symmetric\ntransverse expansion of the systems created in central collision of lead nuclei\nat CERN SPS, BNL RHIC, and CERN LHC, and undergoing a first order phase\ntransition to hadronic matter is considered. A large production of low mass (M<\n0.3 GeV) dileptons, and soft photons (p_T< 0.4 GeV) is seen to emanate from the\nbremsstrahlung of quarks and pions. We find an increase by a factor of 2--4 in\nthe low mass dilepton and soft photon yield as we move from SPS to RHIC\nenergies, and an increase by an order of magnitude as we move from SPS to LHC\nenergies. Most of the soft radiations are found to originate from pion driven\nprocesses at SPS and RHIC energies, while at the LHC energies the quark and the\npion driven processes contribute by a similar amount. The study of the\ntransverse mass distribution is seen to provide interesting details of the\nevolution. We also find a unique universal behaviour for the ratio of M^2\nweighted transverse mass distribution for M= 0.1 GeV to that for M= 0.2 and 0.3\nGeV, as a function of M_T, for SPS, RHIC, and LHC energies, in the absence of\ntransverse expansion of the system. A deviation from this universal behaviour\nis seen as a clear indication of the flow.\n", "  A simple and model-independent method is described to derive neutron\nsingle-particle spectroscopic factors of bound s-wave states in $^{A+1}Z =\n^{A}Z \\otimes n$ nuclei from neutron scattering lengths. Spectroscopic factors\nfor the nuclei ^{13}C, ^{14}C, ^{16}N, ^{17}O, ^{19}O, ^{23}Ne, ^{37}Ar, and\n^{41}Ar are compared to results derived from transfer experiments using the\nwell-known DWBA analysis and to shell model calculations. The scattering length\nof ^{14}C is calculated from the ^{15}C_{g.s.} spectroscopic factor.\n", "  We give predictions for the partial wave amplitudes of pion photoproduction\nnear threshold by means of dispersion relations at fixed t. The free parameters\nof this approach are determined by a fit to experimental data in the energy\nrange 160 MeV $\\le E_{\\gamma} \\le$ 420 MeV. The observables near threshold are\nfound to be rather sensitive to the amplitudes in the resonance region, in\nparticular to the $\\Delta$ (1232) and $N^*$ (1440). We obtain a good agreement\nwith the existing threshold data for both charged and neutral pion production.\nOur predictions also agree well with the results of chiral perturbation theory,\nexcept for neutral pion production off the neutron.\n", "  Using the Gerasimov-Drell-Hearn sum rule and experimental total cross\nsections for photoproduction of $\\eta$, $K$ and $\\phi$ mesons on the proton, we\nobtain upper bounds for the contribution of strange quarks to the anomalous\nmagnetic moment of the proton, $|\\kappa_{s}| \\le 0.20 \\kappa_{p}$. The proposed\nexperiments to measure the spin-dependence of the absorption cross section are\nexpected to lower these bounds considerably. The existing data on $\\eta$\nproduction and phenomenological models for $K$ production agree with a negative\nsign for $\\kappa_{s}$.\n", "  An Extended Hauser-Feshbach Method (EHFM) is developed for light heavy-ion\nfusion reactions in order to provide a detailed analysis of all the possible\ndecay channels by including explicitly the fusion-fission phase-space in the\ndescription of the cascade chain. The mass-asymmetric fission component is\nconsidered as a complex-fragment binary-decay which can be treated in the same\nway as the light-particle evaporation from the compound nucleus in\nstatistical-model calculations. The method of the phase-space integrations for\nthe binary-decay is an extension of the usual Hauser-Feshbach formalism to be\napplied to the mass-symmetric fission part. The EHFM calculations include\nground-state binding energies and discrete levels in the low excitation-energy\nregions which are essential for an accurate evaluation of the phase-space\nintegrations of the complex-fragment emission (fission). In the present\ncalculations, EHFM is applied to the first-chance binary-decay by assuming that\nthe second-chance fission decay is negligible. In a similar manner to the\ndescription of the fusion-evaporation process, the usual cascade calculation of\nlight-particle emission from the highly excited complex fragments is applied.\nThis complete calculation is then defined as EHFM+CASCADE. Calculated\nquantities such as charge-, mass- and kinetic-energy distributions are compared\nwith inclusive and/or exclusive data for the $^{32}$S+$^{24}$Mg and\n$^{35}$Cl+$^{12}$C reactions which have been selected as typical examples.\nFinally, the missing charge distributions extracted from exclusive measurements\nare also successfully compared with the EHFM+CASCADE predictions.\n", "  Recently, deeply bound pionic states were found experimentally in (d,$^3$He)\nreactions on $^{208}$Pb. The observed spectrum showed an excellent agreement\nwith the DWIA calculation and the dominant peak was attributed to the pionic 2p\nstate contribution. We studied theoretically $^{206}$Pb(d,$^3$He) reactions\nwithin the same model, and found that it is very likely to observe the pionic\n1s state as an isolated peak in the $^{206}$Pb(d,$^3$He) reaction with feasible\nenergy resolution and statistics.\n", "  It is shown that data on pion and strangeness production in central\nnucleus-nucleus collisions are consistent with the hypothesis of a Quark Gluon\nPlasma formation between 15 A GeV/c (BNL AGS) and 160 A GeV/c (CERN SPS)\ncollision energies. The experimental results interpreted in the framework of a\nstatistical approach indicate that the effective number of degrees of freedom\nincreases by a factor of about 3 in the course of the phase transition and that\nthe plasma created at CERN SPS energy may have a temperature of about 280 MeV\n(energy density $\\approx$ 10 GeV/fm^3). Experimental studies of central Pb+Pb\ncollisions in the energy range 20-160 A GeV/c are urgently needed in order to\nlocalize the threshold energy, and study the properties of the QCD phase\ntransition.\n", "  The $\\eta-\\eta^{\\prime}$ mixture is discussed in the chiral bag model to\ncalculate the pseudoscalar octet-singlet mixing angle consistent with the\nexperimental data. The color anomaly is taken into account with the modified\nboundary conditions, which shows the relation between the $\\eta^{\\prime}$ mass\nand the gluon condensate inside the chiral bag. We show, however, that\n$\\eta-\\eta^{\\prime}$ mixing angle can follow the Cheshire Cat Principle, i.e.,\ninsensitivity to the bag radius.\n", "  The tensor analyzing power $T_{20}$ and the polarization transfer\ncoefficients $\\kappa_0 (= 3/2 K_y^y)$ and $K_{xz}^y$ are investigated for dp\nbackward elastic scattering by the invariant-amplitude method. Discrepancies\nbetween the conventional calculations and the experimental data on $T_{20}$ and\n$\\kappa_0$ at high and intermediate energies are mostly dissolved by including\nimaginary parts in the amplitudes. The quantity $K_{xz}^y$ is shown to be\nuseful in criticizing nuclear force assumptions.\n", "  Physical reason behind the mass-shift of vector mesons ($\\rho$, $\\omega$,\n$\\phi$) in nuclear matter is discussed in the Walecka model and in QCD sum\nrules. Using analytic formulas for the mass-shift valid at low densities, it is\nshown that the energy dependent part of the sels-energy (wave function\nrenomalization) in medium is a main source for the negative mass-shift, while\nthe energy independent part (the plasma frequency) has relatively a small\neffect. Future experiments in GSI ($\\pi^- + A \\to X + \\omega$ ) and KEK-PS ($p\n+ A \\to X + \\phi$ ) to detect the twin peak structure of vector mesons in\n$e^+e^-$ spectrum are reviewed. Also, it is proposed a new possible experiment\nusing a $S (strangeness) = 1$ vector meson $K^{*}(892)$ with its radiative\ndecay $K^{*+}(892) \\to K^+ + \\gamma$.\n", "  We study the radiation of thermal photons and dileptons likely to be produced\nin relativistic heavy ion collisions. We find that the thermal photon\nmultiplicity scales with the charged pion multiplicity as $dN_{ch}/dy)^\\alpha$\nwith $\\alpha\\sim 1.2$ for a transversely expanding system, contrary to the\ngeneral belief of a quadratic dependence. The scaling is shown to be valid,\nboth for real and virtual photons. The coefficient of proportionality at a\ngiven energy may help us identify the appropriate equation of state of hot\nhadronic matter produced in such collisions.\n", "  A wavepacket model for a system of free pions, which takes into account the\nfull permutation symmetry of the wavefunction and which is suitable for any\nphase space parametrization is developed. The properties of the resulting mixed\nensembles and the two-particle correlation function are discussed. A physical\ninterpretation of the chaoticity lambda as localizat of the pions in the source\nis presented.\n  Two techniques to generate test-particles, which satisfy the probability\ndensities of the wavepacket state, are studied:\n  1. A Monte Carlo procedure in momentum space based on the standard Metropolis\ntechnique.\n  2. A molecular dynamic procedure using Bohm's quantum theory of motion.\n  In order to reduce the numerical complexity, the separation of the\nwavefunction into momentum space clusters is discussed. In this context th\ninfluence of an unauthorized factorization of the state, i. e. the omissio of\ninterference terms, is investigated. It is shown that the correlation radius\nremains almost uneffected, but the chaoticity parameter decreases\nsubstantially. A similar effect is observed in systems with high multiplic\nwhere the omission of higher order corrections in the analysis of two-part\ncorrelations causes a reduction of the chaoticity and the radius.\n  The approximative treatment of the Coulomb interaction between pions and\nsource is investigated. The results suggest that Coulomb effects on the co\nradii are not symmetric for pion pairs of different charges. For negative the\nradius, integrated over the whole momentum spectrum, increases substan while\nfor positive pions the radius remains almost unchanged.\n", "  At forward angles, and bombarding energies E > 200 MeV, the (p,n) and (n,p)\nreactions are thought to be directly proportional to the Gamow-Teller\ntransition strengths in the nuclei. Assuming that this relationship also holds\nfor charge exchange induced by high-energy heavy ions, it would be very useful\nin studies with radioactive beams. Contrary to this expectation, we show that\nthe determination of Gamow-Teller and Fermi matrix elements from heavy-ion\ncharge-exchange at forward angles is very inaccurate.\n", "  Delays associated with elementary interaction processes are investigated. The\ncase of broad resonances is discussed in the context of reaction simulations.\n", "  The separation energies of neutrons and protons, binding energies, mean\nsquare charge radii, electric quadrupole moments and deformation parameters of\nthe proton and neutron distributions are evaluated for $\\beta$ stable even-even\nnuclei with $16 \\leq A \\leq 256$. We compare the theoretical estimates obtained\nwithin the Hartree-Fock plus BCS model with a few sets of Skyrme forces,\nrelativistic mean-field theory and frequently used Saxon-Woods and Nilsson\npotentials with experimental data.\n", "  We investigate the modification of the pion-cloud in the nuclear medium and\nits effect on the nuclear Drell-Yan process. The pion's in-medium self-energy\nis calculated in a self-consistent delta-hole model, with particle-hole\ncontribution also included. Both the imaginary and real part of the pion's and\ndelta's self-energy are taken into account and related through a dispersion\nrelation assuring causality. The resulting in-medium pion light-cone momentum\ndistribution shows only a slight enhancement compared to the one of the free\nnucleon. As a consequence the ratio of the cross-section for Drell-Yan\nscattering on nuclear matter and nucleonic target is close to unity in\nagreement with experiment.\n", "  Low energy scattering and bound state properties of the \\pi N, \\pi\\pi and\nK\\pi systems are studied as coupled channel problems using inversion potentials\nof phase shift data. In a first step we apply the potential model to explain\nrecent measurements of pionic hydrogen shift and width. Secondly, predictions\nof the model for pionium lifetime and shift confirm a well known and widely\nused effective range expression. Thirdly, as extension of this confirmation, we\npredict an unexpected medium effect of the pionium lifetime which shortens by\nseveral orders of magnitude. The \\sigma meson shows a narrow resonance\nstructure as a function of the medium modified mass with the implication of\nbeing essentially energy independent. Similarly, we see this medium resonance\neffect realized for the K\\pi system. To support our findings we present also\nresults for the \\rho meson and the \\Delta(1232) resonance.\n", "  To describe ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions we construct a three-fluid\nhydrodynamical model. In contrast to one-fluid hydrodynamics, it accounts for\nthe finite stopping power of nuclear matter, i.e. for nonequilibrium effects in\nthe early stage of the reaction. Within this model, we study baryon dynamics in\nthe BNL-AGS energy range. For the system Au+Au we find that kinetic equilibrium\nbetween projectile and target nucleons is established only after a time\n$t_{CM}^{eq}\\approx 5~fm/c\\simeq 2R_{Au}/\\gamma_{CM}$. Observables which are\nsensitive to the early stage of the collision (like e.g. nucleon flow)\ntherefore differ considerably from those calculated in the one-fluid model.\n", "  Disoriented chiral condensates or long wavelength pionic oscillations and\ntheir interaction with the thermal environment can be a significant source of\ndileptons. We calculate the yield of such dilepton production within the linear\nsigma model, both in a quantal mean-field treatment and in a semi-classical\napproximation. We then illustrate the basic features of the dilepton spectrum\nin a schematic model. We find that dilepton yield with invariant mass near and\nbelow $2m_{\\pi}$ due to the soft pion modes can be up to two orders of\nmagnitude larger than the corresponding equilibrium yield.\n", "  The coherent and incoherent channels of the neutrinoless muon to electron\nconversion in nuclei, $\\mu^- (A,Z) \\to e^- (A,Z)^*$, are studied throughout the\nperiodic table. The relevant nuclear matrix elements are computed by explicitly\nconstructing all possible final nuclear states in the context of the\nquasi-particle RPA. The obtained results are discussed in view of the existing\nat PSI and TRIUMF experimental data for $^{48}Ti$ and $^{208}Pb$ and compared\nwith results obtained by: (i) shell model sum-rule techniques (ii) nuclear\nmatter mapped into nuclei via a local density approximation and (iii) earlier\nsimilar calculations.\n", "  The hadronic properties of the pionium ion (Coulomb bound system of three\ncharged pions) are estimated using the results for the positronium ion\n$P{s}^{-}$. It turns out that the hadronic shift of the ground state energy and\nthe lifetime of the pionium ion are approximately the same as for pionium.\n", "  The mixing of the doorway components of a giant resonance (GR) due to the\ninteraction via common decay channels influences significantly the distribution\nof the multipole strength and the energy spectrum of the decay products of the\nGR. The concept of the partial widths of a GR becomes ambiguous when the mixing\nis strong. In this case, the partial widths determined in terms of the $K$- and\n$S$-matrices must be distinguished. The photoemission turns out to be most\nsensitive to the overlapping of the doorway states. At high excitation\nenergies, the interference between the doorway states leads to a restructuring\ntowards lower energies and apparent quenching of the dipole strength.\n", "  The semileptonic and leptonic decays of heavy mesons are studied as a\nphenomenological application and exploration of a heavy-quark limit of\nDyson-Schwinger equations. The single form factor, $\\xi(w)$, which\ncharacterises the semileptonic decay in this limit, is calculated and compares\nwell with recent experimental extractions. We obtain a lower bound of 1/3 on\nthe slope-parameter $\\rho^2 \\equiv -\\xi^\\prime(1)$, which, in calculations with\nrealistic input, is exceeded by a great deal: agreement with experimental data\nrequiring $\\rho^2 \\sim 1.2 - 1.6$. The flavour and momentum dependence of the\nlight-quark propagators has observable consequences.\n", "  Multifractal scaling analysis of nuclear giant resonance transition\nprobability distributions is performed within the approximation which takes\ninto account the one-particle-one-hole (1p-1h) and 2p-2h states. A new measure\nto determine the fractal dimensions of the spectra is introduced. It is found\nthat chaotic dynamics governing the decay leads to non-trivial multifractal\nscaling properties. Such a kind of scaling is absent in the case of regular\ndynamics. The degree of collectivity is another element which worsens the\nscaling.\n", "  The quark-meson coupling (QMC) model is examined using Georgi's ``naive\ndimensional analysis''. We argue that the QMC model is quite natural as an\neffective field theory for nuclei.\n", "  Simple states, such as isobaric analog states or giant resonances, embedded\ninto continuum are typical for mesoscopic many-body quantum systems. Due to the\ncoupling to compound states in the same energy range, a simple mode acquires a\ndamping width (\"internal\" dynamics). When studied experimentally with the aid\nof various reactions, such states reveal enhanced cross sections in specific\nchannels at corresponding resonance energies (\"external\" dynamics which include\ndirect decay of a simple mode and decays of intrinsic compound states through\ntheir own channels). We consider the interplay between internal and external\ndynamics using a general formalism of the effective nonhermitian hamiltonian\nand looking at the situation both from \"inside\" (strength functions and\nspreading widths) and from \"outside\" (S-matrix, cross sections and delay\ntimes). The restoration of isospin purity and disappearance of the collective\nstrength of giant resonances at high excitation energy are discussed as\nimportant particular manifestations of this complex interplay.\n", "  The importance of n-p radiative capture, utilizing polarized cold neutrons,\nas a means of measuring the weak pion coupling constant is reviewed. Parity\nconserving processes of the form k_gamma*[s_n,k_n] can contribute to the\ns_n*k_gamma photon asymmetry in any such experiment, if the apparatus is not\nperfectly symmetric. For an incident laboratory neutron energy of 0.003 eV a\nvalue of A^{PC}_{gamma}=0.67*10^{-8} is obtained for two different potential\nmodels (Argonne AV14 and Nijmegen Reid93). Serving as an extreme test case, the\nReid soft core potential yields 0.61*10^{-8}, close to the result of the\ncontemporary forces. Implications for extracting the weak pion coupling\nconstant and for monitoring the beam polarization are discussed.\n", "  Four-body distorted wave theory appropriate for nucleon-nucleus reactions\nleading to 3-body continuum excitations of two-neutron Borromean halo nuclei is\ndeveloped. The peculiarities of the halo bound state and 3-body continuum are\nfully taken into account by using the method of hyperspherical harmonics. The\nprocedure is applied for A=6 test-bench nuclei; thus we report detailed studies\nof inclusive cross sections for inelastic $^6$He(p,p')$^6$He$^*$ and\ncharge-exchange $^6$Li(n,p)$^6$He$^*$ reactions at nucleon energy 50 MeV. The\ntheoretical low-energy spectra exhibit two resonance-like structures. The first\n(narrow) is the excitation of the well-known $2^+$ three-body resonance. The\nsecond (broad) bump is a composition of overlapping soft modes of\nmultipolarities $1^-, 2^+, 1^+, 0^+$ whose relative weights depend on\ntransferred momentum and reaction type. Inelastic scattering is the most\nselective tool for studying the soft dipole excitation mode.\n", "  Exclusive and inclusive $(\\nu_\\mu, \\mu^-), (\\nu_e, e^-)$ cross-sections and\n$\\mu^-$-capture rates are calculated for ^{12}C and ^{16}O using the consistent\nrandom phase approximation (RPA) and pairing model. After a pairing correction\nis introduced to the RPA results the flux-averaged theoretical $(\\nu_\\mu,\n\\mu^-), (\\nu_e, e^-)$ cross-sections and $\\mu^-$-capture rates in $^{12}$C are\nin good agreement with experiment. In particular when one takes into account\nthe experimental error bars, the recently measured range of values for the\n$(\\nu_\\mu, \\mu^-)$ cross-section is in agreement with the present theoretical\nresults. Predictions of $(\\nu_\\mu, \\mu^-)$ and $(\\nu_e, e^-)$ cross-sections in\n^{16}O are also presented.\n", "  Pairing correlations in symmetric nuclear matter are studied within a\nrelativistic mean-field approximation based on a field theory of nucleons\ncoupled to neutral ($\\sigma$ and $\\omega$) and to charged ($\\varrho$) mesons.\nThe Hartree-Fock and the pairing fields are calculated in a self-consistent\nway. The energy gap is the result of a strong cancellation between the scalar\nand vector components of the pairing field. We find that the pair amplitude\nvanishes beyond a certain value of momentum of the paired nucleons. This fact\ndetermines an effective cutoff in the gap equation. The value of this cutoff\ngives an energy gap in agreement with the estimates of non relativistic\ncalculations.\n", "  We study the performance of some recent potential models suggested as\neffective interactions between constituent quarks. In particular, we address\nconstituent quark models for baryons with hybrid Q-Q interactions stemming from\none-gluon plus meson exchanges. Upon recalculating two of such models we find\nthem to fail in describing the N and \\Delta spectra. Our calculations are based\non accurate solutions of the three-quark systems in both a variational\nSchr\\\"odinger and a rigorous Faddeev approach. It is argued that hybrid {Q-Q}\ninteractions encounter difficulties in describing baryon spectra due to the\nspecific contributions from one-gluon and pion exchanges together. In contrast,\na chiral constituent quark model with a Q-Q interaction solely derived from\nGoldstone-boson exchange is capable of providing a unified description of both\nthe N and \\Delta spectra in good agreement with phenomenology.\n", "  This paper reviews the application of optical and UV laser radiation to\nseveral topics in low-energy nuclear physics. We consider the laser-induced\nnuclear anti-Stokes transitions, the laser-assisted and the laser-induced\ninternal conversion, and the Electron Bridge and Inverse Electron Bridge\nmechanisms as tools for deexciting and exciting of low-lying nuclear isomeric\nstates. A study of the anomalous, by low-lying, nuclear isomeric states (on an\nexample of the $^{229}$Th nucleus) is presented in detail.\n", "  An unified approach to the pseudo scalar meson ($\\pi, \\eta$, and $K$)\nphotoproduction off nucleons are presented. It begins with the low energy QCD\nLagrangian, and the resonances in the s- and u- channels are treated in the\nframework of the quark model\n  The duality hypothesis is imposed to limit the number of the t-channel\nexchanges. The CGLN amplitudes for each reaction are evaluated, which include\nboth proton and neutron targets. The important role by the S-wave resonances in\nthe second resonance region is discussed, it is particularly important for the\n$K, \\eta$ and $\\eta^\\prime$ photoproductions.\n", "  We derive relativistic three-dimensional integral equations describing the\ninteraction of the three-nucleon system with an external electromagnetic field.\nOur equations are unitary, gauge invariant, and they conserve charge. This has\nbeen achieved by applying the recently introduced gauging of equations method\nto the three-nucleon spectator equations where spectator nucleons are always on\nmass shell. As a result, the external photon is attached to all possible places\nin the strong interaction model, so that current and charge conservation are\nimplemented in the theoretically correct fashion. Explicit expressions are\ngiven for the three-nucleon bound state electromagnetic current, as well as the\ntransition currents for the scattering processes\n  \\gamma He3 -> NNN, Nd -> \\gamma Nd, and \\gamma He3 -> Nd. As a result, a\nunified covariant three-dimensional description of the NNN-\\gamma NNN system is\nachieved.\n", "  The present status of our understanding of low mass dilepton production in\nrelativistic heavy ion collisions is discussed. The focus of the discussion\nwill be the sensitivity of dilepton measurements to in medium changes of\nhadrons and the restoration of chiral symmetry. We will finally discuss how the\npresence of strong long wavelength pion modes, i.e. disoriented chiral\ncondensates can be seen in the dilepton spectrum.\n", "  This article is an attempt to a pedagogical introduction and review into the\nelementary concepts of chiral symmetry in nuclear physics. Effective chiral\nmodels such as the linear and nonlinear sigma model will be discussed as well\nas the essential ideas of chiral perturbation theory. Some applications to the\nphysics of ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions will be presented.\n", "  Describing fusion reactions between ^{16}O and ^{154}Dy and, between ^{16}O\nand ^{144}Sm by the $sd-$ and $sdf-$ interacting boson model, we show that\nheavy-ion fusion reactions are strongly affected by anharmonic properties of\nnuclear surface vibrations and nuclear shape, and thus provide a powerful\nmethod to study details of nuclear structure and dynamics.\n", "  The effects of higher order coupling of surface vibrations to the relative\nmotion on heavy-ion fusion reactions at near-barrier energies are investigated.\nThe coupled channels equations are solved to all orders, and also in the linear\nand the quadratic coupling approximations. It is shown that the shape of fusion\nbarrier distributions and the energy dependence of the average angular momentum\nof the compound nucleus can significantly change when the higher order\ncouplings are included. The role of octupole vibrational excitation of ^{16}O\nin the ^{16}O + ^{144}Sm fusion reaction is also discussed using the all order\ncoupled-channels equations.\n", "  A relativistic model for the quasifree photoproduction of eta meson from\ncomplex nuclei is developed. The interactions between fields are introduced\nthrough effective Lagrangians. Contributions from several nucleon resonances as\nwell as nucleon Born terms and vector meson exchange diagrams are included.\nNucleon and eta wavefunctions are solutions of Dirac and Klein-Gordon\nequations, respectively. Final state interactions of the outgoing particles are\nincluded via optical potentials. The effects of these interactions on the cross\nsections and photon asymmetries are studied and are found to be large.\nCalculations indicate that at energies near threshold the exclusive reaction\ntakes place mainly through formation of the S_{11}(1535) resonance. Comparisons\nwith the non-relativistic calculations show differences between the two\napproaches both for the cross sections and photon asymmetries. We give some\ndetailed predictions for the reaction observables for exclusive photoproduction\non ^{12}C, ^{16}O and ^{40}Ca.\n", "  We reply to the Comment of A.M. Sandorfi et al. [nucl-th/9707028] on the\nE2/M1 ratio from the Mainz photoproduction data, nucl-th/9707028 v2. We support\nour published result for the E2/M1 ratio of REM\n  = -(2.5 +- 0.2 +- 0.2)%.\n", "  We study the pionic decay of a possible dibaryon d' --> N N \\pi in the\nmicroscopic quark shell model. The initial d' dibaryon wave function (J^P=0^-,\nT=0) consists of one 1\\hbar\\omega six-quark shell-model s^5p[51]_X\nconfiguration. The most important final six-quark configurations s^6[6]_X,\ns^4p^2[42]_X and (s^4p^2-s^52s)[6]_X are properly projected onto the NN\nchannel. The final state NN interaction is investigated by means of two\nphase-equivalent - but off-shell different - potential models. We demonstrate\nthat the decay width \\Gamma_d' depends strongly on the short-range behavior of\nthe NN wave function. In addition, the width \\Gamma_d' is very sensitive to the\nmass and size of the d' dibaryon.\n  For dibaryon masses slightly above the experimentally suggested value\nM_d'=2.065 GeV, we obtain a pionic decay width of \\Gamma_d' = 0.18 - 0.32 MeV\nclose to the experimental value \\Gamma_d' = 0.5 MeV.\n", "  Resolution of discrete final states in the $^{16}$O(e,e$'$pp)$^{14}$C\nreaction may provide an interesting tool to discriminate between contributions\nfrom one- and two-body currents in this reaction. This is based on the\nobservation that the $0^+$ ground state and first $2^+$ state of $^{14}$C are\nreached predominantly by the removal of a $^1S_0$ pair from $^{16}$O in this\nreaction, whereas other states mostly arise by the removal of a $^3P$ pair.\nThis theoretical prediction has been supported recently by an analysis of the\npair momentum distribution of the experimental data. In this paper we present\nresults of reaction calculations performed in a direct knock-out framework\nwhere final-state interaction and one- and two-body currents are included. The\ntwo-nucleon overlap integrals are obtained from a calculation of the two-proton\nspectral function of $^{16}$O and include both long-range and short-range\ncorrelations. The kinematics chosen in the calculations is relevant for recent\nexperiments at NIKHEF and Mainz.\n", "  All measured Feynman x_f distributions of the ratio, R, of j_psi production\nin nuclei relative to production on protons fall off with x_f.\n  They show [2] that absorption of charmonium cannot be the only source of\nj_psi suppression and that energy loss of the constituents of the incident\nproton prior to the j_psi production, because of the exponential sqrt(s)\ndependence of the charmonium cross section, should not be neglected. Including\nthe effects of initial state energy loss we find that the latest measured\n  Pb-Pb j_psi cross sections do not provide any evidence for deconfinement.\n", "  Phi meson-baryon cross sections, estimated within a one-boson-exchange model,\nserve as input for a calculation of the collision rates in hot hadronic matter.\nWe find that the width of the \\phi meson is modified through collisions with\nbaryons by 1-10 MeV at 160 MeV temperature depending on the baryon fugacity.\nThermalization of the \\phi in high energy heavy ion collisions is discussed.\n", "  Introduction\n  Theory of electromagnetic excitation and dissociation (Inelastic scattering\nat high energies: one-photon exchange, semiclassical approach and Glauber\ntheory; Higher order electromagnetic effects, small xi-approximation)\n  Discussion of experimental results for nuclear structure\n  Coulomb dissociation as a tool to measure radiative capture processes\nrelevant to nuclear astrophysics\n  Antihydrogen production and electromagnetic processes at relativistic heavy\nion colliders\n  Conclusions\n", "  The equations of motion for a massive spin-3/2 Rarita-Schwinger field in a\nfinite-range, central, Lorentz scalar potential are developed. It is shown that\nthe resulting density may not be everywhere positive definite.\n", "  We discuss the effects of multi-phonon excitations on heavy-ion fusion\nreactions at energies near and below the Coulomb barrier, focusing especially\non the role of anharmonicities. We carry out a systematic study of those\neffects on the excitation function of the fusion cross section and on the\nfusion barrier distribution, by using the vibrational limit of the interacting\nboson model. We also analyze the recently measured high-precision data of the\n$^{16}$O + $^{148}$Sm fusion reaction with this model and discuss the\nanharmonic properties of the quadrupole as well as the octupole vibrations in\n$^{148}$Sm. Negative and positive static quadrupole moments are deduced for the\nfirst 2$^+$ and 3$^-$ states in $^{148}$Sm, respectively. It is shown that the\nfusion barrier distribution strongly depends on the sign of the quadrupole\nmoments, suggesting that subbarrier fusion reactions offer an alternative\nmethod to extract the static quadrupole moments of phonon states in spherical\nnuclei.\n", "  Low energy $\\pi^+$ emission in hypernuclear weak decays is studied in the\nsoft pion limit. It is found that the $\\pi^+$ decay amplitude is dominated by\nthe $\\Delta I=3/2$ part of nonmesonic weak decays according to the soft pion\ntheorem. The ratios, $R(\\pi^+/soft \\pi^-) $, for light hypernuclei are\nestimated in the direct quark mechanism, which predicts violation of the\n$\\Delta I=1/2$ rule, and found to be about 1/3 for $^4_{\\Lambda}He$.\n", "  We calculate the binding energy of two $\\Lambda$ hyperons bound to a nuclear\ncore within the relativistic mean field theory. The starting point is a\ntwo-body relativistic equation of the Breit type suggested by the RMFT, and\ncorrected for the two-particle interaction. We evaluate the 2 $\\Lambda$\ncorrelation energy and estimate the contribution of the $\\sigma^*$ and $\\Phi$\nmesons, acting solely between hyperons, to the bond energy\n  $\\Delta{B_{\\Lambda\\Lambda}}$ of $^6_{\\Lambda\\Lambda}He$,\n  $^{10}_{\\Lambda\\Lambda}Be$ and $^{13}_{\\Lambda\\Lambda}B$. Predictions of the\n$\\Delta{B_{\\Lambda\\Lambda}}$ A dependence are made for heavier\n$\\Lambda$-hypernuclei.\n", "  Disoriented chiral condensates are manifested as long wavelength pionic\noscillations and their interaction with the thermal environment can be a\nsignificant source of dileptons. We calculate the yield of such dilepton\nproduction within the linear sigma model and illustrate the basic features of\nthe dilepton spectrum in a schematic model. We find that the dilepton yield\nwith invariant mass near and below $2m_{\\pi}$ due to the soft pion modes can be\nup to two orders of magnitude larger than the corresponding equilibrium yield.\nWe conclude with a discussion on how this enhancement can be detected by\npresent dilepton experiments.\n", "  In a realistic application of the SPA + RPA theory for calculation of the\nnuclear level densities we find that quantal fluctuation corrections (RPA) are\nimportant even up to temperature $T = 2.0 MeV$. This leads to a good agreement\nbetween calculated numbers and the available experimental data for $^{104}Pd$\nand $^{114}Sn$, particularly the excitation energy ($E^*$) dependence.\nFurthermore, we also argue that $a=S^2/4E^*$ is the only correct definition of\nthe level density parameter in the present context which is also consistent\nwith the Bethe like level density formula.\n", "  We discuss the contributions of higher order terms in weak Hamiltonian to the\nstandard two-neutrino double beta decay. The formalism for the unique first\nforbidden transitions has been developed, and it is shown that they can alter\nthe two-electron energy spectrum. Yet, their effect is too small to screen the\ndetection of exotic neutrinoless double beta decays, which are candidates for\ntesting the physics beyond the standard model.\n", "  We calculate the baryon flow $< P_x/A(y) >$ in the energy range from .25 to\n$\\le 2.5 AGeV$ in a relativistic transport model for $Ni+Ni$ and $Au+Au$\ncollisions employing various models for the baryon self energies. We find that\nto describe the flow data of the FOPI Collaboration the strength of the vector\npotential has to be reduced at high relative momentum or at high density such\nthat the Schr\\\"odinger- equivalent potential at normal nuclear density\ndecreases above 1 GeV relative kinetic energy and approaches zero above 2 GeV.\n", "  We study inclusive nu_e and nu_mu cross sections in C-12 in a theory that\ntakes into account significant nuclear renormalization of strengths. Our\ncalculation is in excellent agreement with the measured inclusive muon capture\nrate and the flux-averaged nu_e cross section, but overestimates the\nflux-averaged nu_mu inclusive cross section. These reactions are of crucial\nrelevance to the issue of possible nu_mu to nu_e oscillations.We also calculate\nthe flux-averaged cross sections in C-13 and Al-27, which are found to be\nconsistent with the available experimental result.\n", "  Recently developed chiral effective field theory models provide excellent\ndescriptions of the bulk characteristics of finite nuclei, but have not been\ntested with other observables. In this work, densities from both relativistic\npoint-coupling models and mean-field meson models are used in the analysis of\nmeson-nucleus scattering at medium energies. Elastic scattering observables for\n790\n  MeV/$c$ $\\pi^{\\pm}$ on $^{208}$Pb are calculated in a relativistic impulse\napproximation, using the Kemmer-Duffin-Petiau formalism to calculate the\n$\\pi^{\\pm}$ nucleus optical potential.\n", "  Nucleon generalized polarizabilities are investigated within a relativistic\nframework, defining such quantities through a Lorentz covariant multipole\nexpansion of the amplitude for virtual Compton scattering. The key physical\ningredients in the calculation of the nucleon polarizabilities are the Lorentz\ninvariant reduced matrix elements of the electromagnetic transition current,\nwhich can be evaluated from off-energy-shell helicity amplitudes. The evolution\nof the proton paramagnetic polarizability, $\\beta_{para}(q)$, as a function of\nthe virtual-photon three-momentum transfer $ q,$ is explicitly evaluated within\na relativistic constituent quark model by adopting transition form factors\nobtained in the light-front formalism. The discussion is focussed on the role\nplayed by the effects due to the relativistic approach and to the transition\nform factors, derived within different models.\n", "  An exponential version of a deep nucleon-nucleon potential involving\nforbidden states and a tensor component is proposed. The parameters of\ninteraction are chosen by fitting the low-energy characteristics and phase\nshifts of np scattering at energies up to 500 MeV. Such potential have not node\nin D wave as against earlier proposed.\n", "  An enhancement of antiprotons produced in p+d reaction in comparison with\nones in p+p elementary reaction is investigated.\n  In the neighborhood of subthreshold energy the enhancement is caused by the\ndifference of available energies for antiproton production. The cross section\nin p+d reaction, on the other hand, becomes just twice of the one in elementary\np+p reaction at the incident energy far from the threshold energy when\nnon-nucleonic components in deuteron target are not considered.\n", "  We study the binary cold fission of $^{252}$Cf in the frame of a cluster\nmodel where the fragments are born to their respective ground states and\ninteract via a double-folded potential with deformation effects taken into\naccount up to multipolarity $\\lambda=4$. The preformation factors were\nneglected. In the case when the fragments are assumed to be spherical or with\nground state quadrupole deformation, the $Q$-value principle dictates the\noccurence of a narrow region around the double magic $^{132}$Sn, like in the\ncase of cluster radioactivity. When the hexadecupole deformation is turned on,\nan entire mass-region of cold fission in the range 138 - 156 for the heavy\nfragment arise, in agreement with the experimental observations.\n  This fact suggests that in the above mentioned mass-region, contrary to the\nusual cluster radioactivity where the daughter nucleus is always a\nneutron/proton (or both) closed shell or nearly closed shell spherical nucleus,\nthe clusterization mechanism seems to be strongly influenced by the\nhexadecupole deformations rather than the $Q$-value.\n", "  A new type of decay corresponding to the neutronless $^{10}$Be-accompanied\nfragmentation of $^{252}$Cf is studied. We employ a cluster model similar to\nthe model used for the description of cluster radioactivity.\n  No preformation factors were considered.\n  The ternary relative isotopic yields were calculated as the ratio of the\npenetrability of a given ternary fragmentation over the sum of penetrabilities\nof all possible ternary neutronless fragmentations. The corresponding barriers\nbetween the light and heavy fragment and between the $^{10}$Be cluster and the\ntwo heavier fragments were computed with the help of a double folding potential\ngenerated by M3Y-$NN$ effective interaction and realistic fragment ground state\ndeformations.\n  Also, we studied the influence of the fragment excitation energies on the\nyields, by including the level densities and the\n  $\\beta$-stretching of the fragments.\n  The new phenomenon could be experimentally observed by the triple gamma\ncoincidence technique between the fragments and $^{10}$Be.\n", "  The work deals with one of the topics of collective motion. In the frame of\nNuclear Fluid Dynamics, a model which portrays the nuclear matter as a quantum\nelastic body, the torus-like motions and their associated energies are computed\nusing the thirteen moment approximation. The spin-dependent collective\nexcitations, with toroidal electromagnetic structure, are studied by means of\nthe Generalized Goldhaber-Teller model, with emphasize on the 1$^{-}$ spin-flip\nmode and its excitation in spherical nuclei by inelastic electron scattering.\nWe discuss the importance of toroidal contributions in the inclusive electron\nscattering $(e, e')$ and exclusive coincidence electron scattering $(e,\ne'\\gamma)$. In order to extract the toroidal multipole, we use the\nbackscattering angles in the first mentioned reaction, and the separation of\nthe longitudinal/transverse interference in the second case. The introduction\nof a quantity which accounts for the deviations from the Siegert theorem, shows\nthe importance of toroidal quadrupole transitions at high-momentum transfer.\n", "  We calculate the asymptotic high-energy amplitude for electrons scattering at\none ion as well as at two colliding ions, respectively, by means of\nperturbation theory. We show that the interaction with one ion eikonalizes and\nthat the interaction with two ions causally decouples. We are able to put\nprevious results on perturbative grounds and propose further applications for\nthe obtained rules for interactions on the light cone. The formalism will be of\nuse for the calculation of Coulomb corrections to electron-positron pair\ncreation in heavy ion collisions. Finally we discuss the results and inherent\ndangers of the employed approximations.\n", "  The correct use of energy-dependent single-particle level (s.p.l.) densities\nwithin particle-hole state densities based on the equidistant spacing model\n(ESM) is analysed. First, an analytical expression is obtained following the\nconvolution of energy-dependent excited-particle and hole densities. Next, a\ncomparison is made with results of the ESM formula using average s.p.l.\ndensities for the excited particles and holes, respectively. The Fermi-gas\nmodel (FGM) s.p.l. densities calculated at the corresponding average excitation\nenergies are used in both cases. The analysis concerns also the density of\nparticle-hole bound states. The pairing correlations are taken into account\nwhile the comparison of various effects includes the exact correction for the\nPauli exclusion principle. Quantum-mechanical s.p.l. densities and the\ncontinuum effect can also match a corresponding FGM formula, suitable for use\nwithin the average energy-dependent partial state density in multistep reaction\nmodels.\n", "  The electromagnetic form factors of the trinucleons 3H and 3He are calculated\nwith wave functions obtained with the Argonne AV18 two-nucleon and Urbana IX\nthree-nucleon interactions. Full account is taken of the two-body currents\nrequired by current conservation with the AV18 interaction as well as those\nassociated with N-Delta transition currents and the currents of Delta resonance\ncomponents in the wave functions. Explicit three-nucleon current operators\nassociated with the two-pion exchange three-nucleon interaction arising from\nirreducible S-wave pion-nucleon scattering is constructed and shown to have\nvery little effect on the calculated magnetic form factors. The calculated\nmagnetic form factor of 3H, and charge form factors of both 3H and 3He are in\nsatisfactory agreement with the experimental data. However, the position of the\nzero in the magnetic form factor of 3He is slightly underpredicted.\n", "  We study the break-up of 8B in collisions with heavy-ions. The process is\ndescribed in terms of inelastic excitations leading to states in the continuum.\n  The effects of the nuclear and coulomb fields are included on the same\nfooting in the microscopic construction of the transition matrix elements. The\ninterplay between coulomb and nuclear excitation processes differs\nsignificantly from the situation encountered in reactions involving systems\nclose to the stability line. In particular, nuclear excitation is found to\nremain predominant at energies well below the coulomb barrier,\n", "  A self-consistent relativistic Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck equation for the\n$N^{*}$(1440) resonance is developed based on an effective Lagrangian of\nbaryons interacting through mesons.\n  The equation is consistent with that of nucleon's and delta's which we\nderived before. Thus, we obtain a set of coupled equations for the $N$,\n$\\Delta$ and $N^{*}$(1440) distribution functions.\n  All the $N^{*}$(1440)-relevant in-medium two-body scattering cross sections\nwithin the $N$, $\\Delta$ and $N^{*}$(1440) system are derived from the same\neffective Lagrangian in addition to the mean field and presented analytically.\nMedium effects on the cross sections are discussed.\n", "  Ground-state properties of neutron-rich $N \\approx 28$ nuclei are described\nin the framework of Relativistic Hartree Bogoliubov (RHB) theory. The model\nuses the NL3 effective interaction in the mean-field Lagrangian, and describes\npairing correlations by the pairing part of the finite range Gogny interaction\nD1S. Two-neutron separation energies and ground-state quadrupole deformations\nthat result from fully self-consistent RHB solutions, are compared with\navailable experimental data. The model predicts a strong suppression of the\nspherical N=28 shell gap for neutron-rich nuclei: the $1f7/2 \\to fp$ core\nbreaking results in deformed ground states. Shape coexistence is expected for\nneutron-rich Si, S and Ar isotopes.\n", "  A model calculation for pion production in nucleon-nucleon collisions is\npresented. Direct production, pion rescattering and contributions from pair\ndiagrams are taken into account. The amplitudes for the elementary processes\nare based on well established microscopic models of nucleon-nucleon and\npion-nucleon scattering. The $\\Delta (1232)$ is included explicitly and is\nfound to play an important role even at energies close to production threshold.\nA good overall agreement with existing data from the pion production threshold\nup to the Delta resonance region is achieved.\n", "  Differential (e,e'pp) measurements are presently recognized as a way of\nstudying short-range correlations in finite nuclei. The ($\\vec{e},e'\\vec{p}p$)\nand ($\\vec{e},e'\\vec{p}n$) differential cross section and polarization\nobservables are studied in a microscopic model that accounts for the\nshort-range correlations, outgoing-nucleon distortions, meson-exchange and\n$\\Delta$-isobar currents. It is pointed out that polarization observables\nrepresent an attractive alternative for absolute electronuclear two-nucleon\nknockout measurements. In the polarization transfer $P'_t$ for\n($\\vec{e},e'\\vec{p}p$), the effect of central short-range correlations is\npredicted to be large while at the same time the final-state interaction\neffects are small.\n", "  A new result of investigations of the hyperfine structure (hfs) anomaly in Be\nisotopes is presented. The hfs constant for $^{11}$Be is obtained by using the\ncore plus neutron type wave function: $ |2s_{1\\over 2}>+|1d_{5\\over2}\\times 2^+\n; {1/2}^{+}> $. A large hfs anomaly of $^{11}$Be is found, which is mainly due\nto a large radius of the halo single particle state.\n", "  A recent interpretation of the caloric curve based on the expansion of the\nabraded spectator nucleus is re-analysed in the framework of the Time-Dependent\nHartree-Fock (TDHF) evolution. It is shown that the TDHF dynamics is more\ncomplex than a single monopolar collective motion at moderate energy. The\ninclusion of other important collective degrees of freedom may lead to the\ndynamical creation of hollow structure. Then, low density regions could be\nlocally reached after a long time by the creation of these exotic density\nprofiles. In particular the systematic of the minimum density reached during\nthe expansion (the so-called turning points) appears to be different.\n", "  Thermodynamical variables and their time evolution are studied for central\nrelativistic heavy ion collisions from 10.7 to 160 AGeV in the microscopic\nUltrarelativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics model (UrQMD). The UrQMD model\nexhibits drastic deviations from equilibrium during the early high density\nphase of the collision. Local thermal and chemical equilibration of the\nhadronic matter seems to be established only at later stages of the quasi-\nisentropic expansion in the central reaction cell with volume 125 fm$^{3}$.\ndistributions at all collision energies for $t\\geq 10 fm/c$ with a unique\nBaryon energy spectra in this cell are approximately reproduced by Boltzmann\nrapidly dropping temperature. At these times the equation of state has a simple\nform: $P \\cong (0.12-0.15) \\epsilon$. At 160 AGeV the strong deviation from\nchemical equilibrium is found for mesons, especially for pions, even at the\nlate stage of the reaction. The final enhancement of pions is supported by\nexperimental data.\n", "  We study the production of $c \\bar{c}$ pairs and dimuons from hard collisions\nin nuclear reactions within the covariant transport approach HSD. Adopting 6 mb\nfor the $c \\bar{c}$-baryon cross section the data on $J/\\Psi$ suppression in p\n+ A reactions are reproduced in line with calculations based on the Glauber\nmodel. Furthermore, using $J/\\Psi$ absorption cross sections with mesons above\nthe $D\\bar{D}$ threshold in the order of 1.5 - 3 mb we find that all data on\n$J/\\Psi$ suppression from NA38/NA50 can be described without assuming the\nformation of a quark-gluon plasma. Alternatively, we also investigate an\n'early'-comover absorption scenario where the $c \\bar{c}$ pairs are dissociated\nin the color electric fields of neighboring strings. Again we find good\nagreement with the experimental data with an estimate for the string radius of\n$R_s \\approx 0.2-0.25 fm$.\n", "  A new Nilsson single-particle structure is proposed for neutron-rich nuclei\nnear $^{132}$Sn. In general, a large reduction in spin-orbit interaction is\nrequired and the neutron $N = 82$ gap persists in the new set of parameters.\nThe ground state deformations for several isotopic chains are studied with this\nset and compared with the results of the standard set and with measured ones.\nCollective bands in two even-even, neutron-rich nuclei are calculated using the\nProjected Shell Model with the new set of parameters and improved agreement\nwith existing data is found.\n", "  A method for incorporating the effect of the resonant continuum into\n  Hartree-Fock+BCS equations is proposed. The method is applied for the case of\na neutron-rich nucleus calculated with a Skyrme-type force plus a zero-range\npairing interaction and the results are compared with\n  Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculations. It is shown that the widths of resonant\nstates have an important effect on the pairing properties of nuclei close to\nthe drip line.\n", "  Within the framework of selfconsistent cranked Hartree-Fock- Bogoliubov\ntheory(one-dimensional) we predict second backbend in the yrast line of Os-182\nat $I \\approx 40 $, which is even sharper than the first one observed\nexperimentally at $I \\approx 14 $.\n  Around such a high spin the structure becomes multi-quasiparticle type, but\nthe main source of this strong discontinuity is a sudden large alignment of\ni_13/2 proton orbitals along the rotation axis followed soon by the alignment\nof j_15/2 neutron orbitals. This leads to drastic structural changes at such\nhigh spins. When experimentally confirmed, this will be observed for the first\ntime in this mass region, and will be at the highest spin so far.\n", "  The polarization degrees-of-freedom in electronuclear two-nucleon knockout\nreactions are discussed. Model calculations for the unpolarized\n$^{16}$O(e,e$'$pp) cross sections at ($\\mid \\vec{q} \\mid$,$\\omega$)=(210\nMeV,300 MeV/c) are compared to recently obtained data. Predictions for the\npolarization observables in electronuclear two-nucleon knockout are presented.\nIt is stressed that detailed studies of two-nucleon emission processes permit\nto constrain the contribution from two-nucleon mechanisms (like meson-exchange\nand isobar effects) to the single-nucleon knockout channel (e,e$'$p).\n", "  In front-form dynamics the current operator can be constructed from auxiliary\noperators, defined in a Breit frame where initial and final three-momenta of\nthe system are directed along the $z$ axis. Poincar\\'e covariance constraints\nreduce for auxiliary operators to the ones imposed only by kinematical\nrotations around the $z$ axis.\n  Elastic and transition form factors can be extracted without any ambiguity\nand in the elastic case the continuity equation is automatically satisfied,\nonce Poincar\\'e, ${\\cal P}$ and ${\\cal T}$ covariance, together with\nhermiticity, are imposed. Applications to deep inelastic structure functions in\nan exactly solvable model and to the calculation of the deuteron\nelectromagnetic form factors are presented.\n", "  A distinct isotopic effect in phi photoproduction at 2-5 GeV region is\nidentified by examining the production amplitudes due to Pomeron-exchange and\nmeson-exchange mechanisms. This effect is mainly caused by the pi-eta\ninterference constrained by SU(3) symmetry and the isotopic structure of the\ngamma NN coupling in the direct phi-radiation amplitude. It can be tested\nexperimentally by measuring differences in the polarization observables between\nthe gamma-p and gamma-n reactions.\n", "  It is demonstrated that radiative corrections increase tunneling probability\nof a charged particle.\n", "  An exact method for direct calculation of the Jost function and Jost\nsolutions for a repulsive singular potential is presented. Within this method\nthe Schrodinger equation is replaced by an equivalent system of linear\nfirst-order differential equations, which after complex rotation, can easily be\nsolved numerically. The Jost function can be obtained to any desired accuracy\nfor all complex momenta of physical interest, including the spectral points\ncorresponding to bound and resonant states. The method can also be used in the\ncomplex angular-momentum plane to calculate the Regge trajectories. The\neffectiveness of the method is demonstrated using the Lennard-Jones (12,6)\npotential. The spectral properties of the realistic inter-atomic He4-He4\npotentials HFDHE2 and HFD-B of Aziz and collaborators are also investigated.\n", "  The beta-decay of a tritium nucleus produces an entangled quantum system, a\nbeta electron, a helium nucleus, and an antineutrino. For finite collapse\ntimes, the post-collapse beta electron energy can originate from a range of\npre-collapse energies due to the uncertainty principle. Long collapse times\ngive negligible uncertainty, so the pre-collapse spectrum must approach that of\nisolated nuclei. We calculate the post-collapse electron spectrum which shows a\ncollapse-dependent pileup near the endpoint. Comparison with observation shows\nthat a collapse time of 1 x 10^-17 s explains the observed pileup. The collapse\nof the entangled quantum system must be triggered by the environment: most\nlikely an atomic (molecular) electron initially bound to the atomic (molecular)\ntritium source or perhaps ambient gas molecules. Coincidentally, the 40 eV\ntritium atom-helium ion energy level shift is unobservably small for times\nshorter than the system collapse time. We conclude that an atomic (molecular)\nelectron triggers the collapse once the 40 eV shift becomes detectible and the\nelectron detects the helium nucleus. Thus collapse may explain the tritium\nendpoint pileup.\n", "  The Landau-Migdal parameters for nucleon-nucleon (g'_NN) and nucleon-\\Delta\n(g'_N\\Delta) couplings are estimated from recent experimental data on the giant\nGamow-Teller state of 90Nb. The observed quenching of the GT strength by 10%\nprovides 0.16<g'_N\\Delta<0.23 for g'_\\Delta\\Delta <1.0, while the excitation\nenergy g'_NN\\sim 0.59. The critical density of pion condensations is much lower\nthan those previously discussed with the universality ansatz.\n", "  In this contribution we will discuss the production of low mass dileptons in\nSPS-energy heavy ion collisions. We briefly review the current theoretical\nsituation before we turn to the analysis of the recent data for Pb+Au. We also\nwill discuss the role of baryons as a source for dileptons.\n", "  The effect of meson and isobar degrees of freedom in A($\\vec{e},e'\\vec{p}$)\nand A(e,e'n) is studied for four-momentum transfers Q^2 in the range between\n0.2 and 0.8 (GeV/c)^2. The calculations are performed in a non-relativistic\nframework with explicit (N,\\Delta,\\pi) degrees-of-freedom. For the whole range\nof momentum transfers under investigation the relative effect of the\nmeson-exchange and isobar degrees of freedom is significant. At low missing\nmomenta and quasi-elastic conditions, a tendency to reduce the (e,e'p) and\n(e,e'n) differential cross sections is noticed. The greatest sensitivity is\nfound in the interference structure functions $W_{LT}$ and $W_{TT}$. The recoil\npolarization observables, on the other hand, are moderately affected by the\nmeson-exchange and $\\Delta$-isobar currents.\n", "  Single-particle overlap functions and spectroscopic factors are calculated on\nthe basis of the one-body density matrices (ODM) obtained for the nucleus\n$^{16}O$ employing different approaches to account for the effects of\ncorrelations. The calculations use the relationship between the overlap\nfunctions related to bound states of the (A-1)-particle system and the ODM for\nthe ground state of the A-particle system. The resulting bound-state overlap\nfunctions are compared and tested in the description of the experimental data\nfrom (p,d) reactions for which the shape of the overlap function is important.\n", "  We present the contributions of the non-linear chiral scalar field S to cross\nsections of $pp\\to d\\pi ^{+}, pp\\to pn\\pi ^{+}$ and $pp\\to pp\\pi ^0$ reactions\nat threshold. We compare our results with the meson $\\sigma$ contribution from\nthe $\\sigma$-linear model. We show that the chiral scalar field S is almost 5\ntimes bigger than the other contributions, which indicates that the two-pion\nexchange dynamics embebbed in the S field is the most important term for the\npion production at threshold.\n", "  We consider the Dirac equation for a finite-size neutron in an external\nelectric field. We explicitly incorporate Dirac-Pauli form factors into the\nDirac equation. After a non-relativistic reduction, the Darwin-Foldy term is\ncancelled by a contribution from the Dirac form factor, so that the only\ncoefficient of the external field charge density is $e/6 r^2_{En}$, i. e. the\nroot mean square radius associated with the electric Sachs form factor . Our\nresult is similar to a recent result of Isgur, and reconciles two apparently\nconflicting viewpoints about the use of the Dirac equation for the description\nof nucleons.\n", "  A method for solving the shell-model eigenproblem in a severely truncated\nspace, spanned by properly selected correlated states obtained by partitioning\nthe full configuration space, is proposed. The method describes in a\npractically exact way the low energy spectroscopic properties of nuclei, as\nexemplified in schematic models. The applicability of the method to heavy\nnuclei as well in contexts different from the nuclear shell model is stressed\n", "  Dynamical reaction theories are reviewed for synthesis of superheavy\nelements. Characteristic features of formation and surviving are discussed with\nreference to possible incident channels. Theoretical predictions are presented\non favorable incident channels and on optimum energies for synthesis of Z=114.\n", "  An extended pairing plus QQ force model, which has been shown to successfully\nexplain the nuclear binding energy and related quantities such as the symmetry\nenergy, is applied to study the alpha-like four-nucleon correlations in\n1f_{7/2} shell nuclei.\n  The double difference of binding energies, which displays a characteristic\nbehavior at $N \\approx Z$, is interpreted in terms of the alpha-like\ncorrelations. Important roles of proton-neutron interactions forming the\nalpha-like correlated structure are discussed.\n", "  We study global features of proton-neutron (p-n) interactions and symmetry\nenergy over a wide range of nuclei, using a schematic model interaction with\nfour forces proposed recently.\n  Calculations are performed by the BCS approximation in N,Z=20-50 and\nN,Z=50-82 regions. The experimental double differences of binding energies and\nsymmetry energy are reproduced quite well.\n  It is shown that the isoscalar p-n interactions with all J are indispensable\nfor explaining the binding energies of not only\n  $N\\approx Z$ but also N>Z nuclei in the A=40-160 region.\n", "  Exact expressions of the Pauli exclusion operator Q in the nuclear matter\ncalculation are presented in detail. Exact formulae are also given for the\ncalculations of the single-particle-potential energy and the binding energy per\nnucleon with the exact Q operator. Numerical calculations of the G matrix in\nthe lowest-order Brueckner theory are carried out to check the reliability of\nthe standard angle-average approximation for the\n  Q operator by employing the Bonn B and C NN potentials. It is observed that\nthe exact treatment of the operator Q brings about non-negligible and\nattractive contributions to the binding energy.\n", "  An intrinsic-state formalism for IBM-4 is presented. A basis of deformed\nbosons is introduced which allows the construction of a general trial wave\nfunction which has Wigner's spin-isospin SU(4) symmetry as a particular limit.\nIntrinsic-state calculations are compared with exact ones showing good\nagreement.\n", "  We carry out realistic coupled-channels calculations for\n  $^{11}$Be + $^{208}$Pb reaction in order to discuss the effects of break-up\nof the projectile nucleus on sub-barrier fusion.\n  We discretize in energy the particle continuum states, which are associated\nwith the break-up process, and construct the coupling form factors to these\nstates on a microscopic basis.\n  The incoming boundary condition is employed in solving coupled-channels\nequations, which enables us to define the flux for complete fusion inside the\nCoulomb barrier. It is shown that complete fusion cross sections are\nsignificantly enhanced due to the couplings to the continuum states compared\nwith the no coupling case at energies below the Coulomb barrier, while they are\nhindered at above barrier energies.\n", "  Extraction of spin observables from vector meson photoproduction on a nucleon\ntarget is described. Starting from density matrix elements in the vector\nmeson's rest frame, we transform to spin observables in the photon-nucleon c.m.\nframe.\n  Several constraints on the transformed density matrix and on the spin\nobservables follow from requiring that the angular distribution and the density\nmatrix be positive definite. A set of constraints that are required in order to\nextract meaningful spin observables from forthcoming data are enunciated.\n", "  Metz et al PRL (83), 1542 (1999) have presented evidence for supersymmetry in\natomic nuclei but their model Hamiltonian fails to distinguish between\nirreducible representations that occur with multiplicities greater than one.\nThis failure raises serious questions as to the validity of the evidence.\n", "  Motivated by the recent work on the calculation of the $\\pi NN$ coupling\nconstant using QCD sum rule beyond the chiral limit, we construct the\ncorresponding sum rules for the couplings, $\\eta NN$, $\\pi \\Xi\\Xi$, $\\eta\n\\Xi\\Xi$, $\\pi \\Sigma \\Sigma$ and $\\eta \\Sigma \\Sigma$. In constructing the\n$\\eta$-baryon sum rules, we use the second moment of the $\\eta$ wave function,\nwhich we obtain from the pion wave function after SU(3) rotation. In the SU(3)\nsymmetric limit, we can identify the term responsible for the $F/D$ ratio in\nthe OPE, which after the sum rule analysis gives $F/D\\sim 0.2$, a factor of 3\nsmaller than from other studies. We also present a qualitative analysis\nincluding the\n  SU(3) breaking terms.\n", "  To study collective motion, the extended pairing plus $QQ$ force model\nproposed recently is applied to $A$=46, 48 and 50 nuclei in the $fp$ shell\nregion.\n  Exact shell model calculations in the truncated model space\n  $(f_{7/2},p_{3/2},p_{1/2})$ prove the usefulness of the interaction.\n  The simple model with the pairing plus quadrupole pairing plus $QQ$ force and\n$J$-independent isoscalar proton-neutron force reproduces unexpectedly well\nobserved binding energies, energy levels of collective (yrast) states and\nreduced $E2$ transition probabilities in $^{46}$Ti, $^{46}$V, $^{48}$V,\n$^{48}$Cr, $^{50}$Cr and $^{50}$Mn.\n  The correspondence between theory and experiment is almost comparable to that\nattained by the full $fp$ shell model calculations with realistic effective\ninteractions. Some predictions are made for energy levels and variations of\n$B(E2)$ in the yrast bands, in these nuclei. Characteristics of the interaction\nare investigated by comparing with the realistic effective interactions.\n", "  Polarization observables for the A(e,e'NN) and A(\\gamma,NN) reactions are a\npowerful tool to study nucleon-nucleon correlations in the nuclear medium. In\nthis paper, model calculations for the ^{4}He(e,e'pp),\n^{16}O(\\vec{e},e'\\vec{p}p), ^{16}O(\\vec{e},e' \\vec{p}n) and\n^{12}C(\\vec{\\gamma},\\vec{p}N) reactions are presented. The sensitivity of the\ndifferential cross sections and polarization observables to central and\nspin-dependent nucleon-nucleon correlations is discussed.\n", "  Power counting is applied to relativistic mean-field energy functionals to\nestimate contributions to the energy from individual terms. New estimates for\nisovector, tensor, and gradient terms in finite nuclei are shown to be\nconsistent with direct, high-quality fits. The estimates establish a hierarchy\nof model parameters and identify how many parameters are well constrained by\nbulk nuclear observables. We conclude that four (possibly five) isoscalar,\nnon-gradient parameters, one gradient parameter, and one isovector parameter\nare well determined by the usual bulk nuclear observables.\n", "  We derive the equations for approximate particle number projection based on\nmean field wave functions with finite range density dependent forces. As an\napplication ground bands of even-A superdeformed nuclei in the A=150 and A=190\nregions are calculated with the Gogny force.\n  We discuss nuclear properties such as quadrupole moments, moments of inertia\nand quasiparticle spectra, among others, as a function of the angular momentum.\nWe obtain a good overall description.\n", "  The effect of central, tensor and spin-isospin nucleon-nucleon correlations\nupon semi-exclusive ^{16}O(e,e'p) reactions is studied for Q^2 and Bjorken x\nvalues in the range $0.2 \\lesssim Q^2 \\lesssim 1.1 (GeV/c)^2$ and 0.15\n$\\lesssim$ x $\\lesssim$ 2. The fully unfactorized calculations are performed in\na framework that accounts not only for the dynamical coupling of virtual\nphotons to correlated nucleon pairs but also for meson-exchange and\n$\\Delta_{33}$-isobar currents. Tensor correlations are observed to produce\nsubstantially larger amounts of semi-exclusive ^{16}O(e,e'p) strength than\ncentral correlations do and are predominantly manifest in the proton-neutron\nknockout channel. With the exception of the $x \\approx 2$ case, in all\nkinematical situations studied the meson-exchange and isobar currents are a\nstrong source of A(e,e'p) strength at deep missing energies. This feature gives\nthe A(e,e'p) strength at deep missing energies a pronounced transverse\ncharacter.\n", "  The Holstein-Primakoff mapping for pairs of bosons is extended in order to\naccommodate single boson mapping. The proposed extension allows a variety of\napplications and especially puts the formalism at finite temperature on firm\ngrounds. The new mapping is applied to the O(N+1) anharmonic oscillator with\nglobal symmetry broken down to O(N). It is explicitly demonstrated that\nN-Goldstone modes appear. This result generalizes the Holstein-Primakoff\nmapping for interacting boson as developed in ref.[1].\n", "  The effect of tensor nucleon-nucleon correlations upon exclusive and\nsemi-exclusive electronuclear reactions is studied. Differential cross sections\nfor the semi-exclusive ^{16}O(e,e'p) and exclusive ^{16}O(e,e'pn) processes are\ncomputed by explicitly evaluating the dynamical electromagnetic coupling to a\ntensor correlated nucleon pair. In both reaction channels the tensor\ncorrelations contribute in a very substantial way. Tensor correlations are\nfound to generate more electronuclear strength than central Jastrow\ncorrelations do.\n", "  In this paper the equation of state of hot neutron matter is calculated.\n  Involving the Oppenheimer-Volkov-Tolman equation global parameters of a\nneutron star at the finite temperature are obtained. The objective of our work\nwas to study the influence of the temperature on the main parameters of a\nneutron star.\n", "  We study how d+3He beckward elastic scattering is connected with momentum\ndistribution of the deuteron in 3He. With this aim th relativistic calculations\nin the framework of proton exchange is investigated. We also consider possible\nreaction mechanisms beyond the proton exchange\n", "  Zakharov-Shabat--Ablowitz-Kaup-Newel-Segur representation for\nStokes-anti-Stokes stimulated Raman scattering is proposed. Periodical waves,\nsolitons and self-similarity solutions are derived. Transient and bright\nthreshold solitons are discussed.\n", "  A classification of dynamical systems in terms of their variational\nproperties is reviewed. Within this classification, front propagation is\ndiscussed in a non-gradient relaxational potential flow. The model is motivated\nby transient pattern phenomena in nematics. A front propagating into an\nunstable homogenous state leaves behind an unstable periodic pattern, which\ndecays via a second front and a second periodic state. An interface between\nunstable periodic states is shown to be a source of propagating fronts in\nopposite directions.\n", "  We study the formation of spot patterns seen in a variety of bacterial\nspecies when the bacteria are subjected to oxidative stress due to hazardous\nbyproducts of respiration. Our approach consists of coupling the cell density\nfield to a chemoattractant concentration as well as to nutrient and waste\nfields. The latter serves as a triggering field for emission of\nchemoattractant. Important elements in the proposed model include the\npropagation of a front of motile bacteria radially outward form an initial\nsite, a Turing instability of the uniformly dense state and a reduction of\nmotility for cells sufficiently far behind the front. The wide variety of\npatterns seen in the experiments is explained as being due the variation of the\ndetails of the initiation of the chemoattractant emission as well as the\ntransition to a non-motile phase.\n", "  Motivated by the idea of developing a ``hydrodynamic'' description of\nspatiotemporal chaos, we have investigated the defect--defect correlation\nfunctions in the defect turbulence regime of the two--dimensional, anisotropic\ncomplex Ginzburg--Landau equation. We compare our results with the predictions\nof generic scale invariance. Using the topological nature of the defects, we\nprove that defect--defect correlations cannot decay as slowly as predicted by\ngeneric scale invariance. We also present results on the fluctuations of the\namplitude field $A$.\n", "  We study traffic congestion by analyzing a one dimensional traffic flow\nmodel. Developing an asymptotic method to investigate the long time behavior\nnear a critical point, we derive the modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation\nas the lowest order model. There are an infinite number of kink solitons to the\nmKdV equation, while it has been found by numerical simulations that the kink\npattern arising in traffic congestion is uniquely determined irrespective of\ninitial conditions. In order to resolve this selection problem, we consider\nhigher order corrections to the mKdV equation and find that there is a kink\nsoliton which can deform continuously with the perturbation represented by the\naddition of these corrections. With numerical confirmation, we show that this\ncontinuously deformable kink soliton characterizes traffic congestion. We also\ndiscuss the relationship between traffic congestion and slugging phenomenon in\ngranular flow.\n", "  We apply a multiple-time version of the reductive perturbation method to\nstudy long waves as governed by the shallow water wave model equation. As a\nconsequence of the requirement of a secularity-free perturbation theory, we\nshow that the well known N-soliton dynamics of the shallow water wave equation,\nin the particular case of $\\alpha=2 \\beta$, can be reduced to the N-soliton\nsolution that satisfies simultaneously all equations of the Korteweg-de Vries\nhierarchy.\n", "  We discuss a diffusively perturbed predator-prey system. Freedman and\nWolkowicz showed that the corresponding ODE can have a periodic solution that\nbifurcates from a homoclinic loop. When the diffusion coefficients are large,\nthis solution represents a stable, spatially homogeneous time-periodic solution\nof the PDE. We show that when the diffusion coefficients become small, the\nspatially homogeneous periodic solution becomes unstable and bifurcates into\nspatially nonhomogeneous periodic solutions.\n  The nature of the bifurcation is determined by the twistedness of an\nequilibrium/homoclinic bifurcation that occurs as the diffusion coefficients\ndecrease. In the nontwisted case two spatially nonhomogeneous simple periodic\nsolutions of equal period are generated, while in the twisted case a unique\nspatially nonhomogeneous double periodic solution is generated through\nperiod-doubling.\n  Key Words: Reaction-diffusion equations; predator-prey systems; homoclinic\nbifurcations; periodic solutions.\n", "  We performed an extensive numerical study of a two-dimensional\nreaction-diffusion system of the activator-inhibitor type in which domain\npatterns can form. We showed that both multidomain and labyrinthine patterns\nmay form spontaneously as a result of Turing instability. In the stable\nhomogeneous system with the fast inhibitor one can excite both localized and\nextended patterns by applying a localized stimulus. Depending on the parameters\nand the excitation level of the system stripes, spots, wriggled stripes, or\nlabyrinthine patterns form. The labyrinthine patterns may be both connected and\ndisconnected. In the the stable homogeneous system with the slow inhibitor one\ncan excite self-replicating spots, breathing patterns, autowaves and\nturbulence. The parameter regions in which different types of patterns are\nrealized are explained on the basis of the asymptotic theory of instabilities\nfor patterns with sharp interfaces developed by us in Phys. Rev. E. 53, 3101\n(1996). The dynamics of the patterns observed in our simulations is very\nsimilar to that of the patterns forming in the ferrocyanide-iodate-sulfite\nreaction.\n", "  We consider a diffusive Coupled Map Lattice (CML) for which the local map is\npiece-wise affine and has two stable fixed points. By introducing a\nspatio-temporal coding, we prove the one-to-one correspondence between the set\nof global orbits and the set of admissible codes. This relationship is applied\nto the study of the (uniform) fronts' dynamics. It is shown that, for any given\nvelocity in $[-1,1]$, there is a parameter set for which the fronts with that\nvelocity exist and their shape is unique. The dependence of the velocity of the\nfronts on the local map's discontinuity is proved to be a Devil's staircase.\nMoreover, the linear stability of the global orbits which do not reach the\ndiscontinuity follows directly from our simple map. For the fronts, this\nstatement is improved and as a consequence, the velocity of all the propagating\ninterfaces is computed for any parameter. The fronts are shown to be also\nnonlinearly stable under some restrictions on the parameters. Actually, these\nrestrictions follow from the co-existence of uniform fronts and non-uniformly\ntravelling fronts for strong coupling. Finally, these results are extended to\nsome $C^{\\infty}$ local maps.\n", "  We derive the exact equation of motion for a vortex in two- and three-\ndimensional non-relativistic systems governed by the Ginzburg-Landau equation\nwith complex coefficients. The velocity is given in terms of local gradients of\nthe magnitude and phase of the complex field and is exact also for arbitrarily\nsmall inter-vortex distances. The results for vortices in a superfluid or a\nsuperconductor are recovered.\n", "  A theoretical model for studying pattern formation in electroconvection is\nproposed in the form of a modified Swift-Hohenberg equation. A localized state\nis found in two dimension, in agreement with the experimentally observed\n``worm\" state. The corresponding one dimensional model is also studied, and a\nnovel stationary localized state due to nonadiabatic effect is found. The\nexistence of the 1D localized state is shown to be responsible for the\nformation of the two dimensional ``worm\" state in our model.\n", "  Streamers often constitute the first stage of dielectric breakdown in strong\nelectric fields: a nonlinear ionization wave transforms a non-ionized medium\ninto a weakly ionized nonequilibrium plasma. New understanding of this old\nphenomenon can be gained through modern concepts of (interfacial) pattern\nformation. As a first step towards an effective interface description, we\ndetermine the front width, solve the selection problem for planar fronts and\ncalculate their properties. Our results are in good agreement with many\nfeatures of recent three-dimensional numerical simulations.\n  In the present long paper, you find the physics of the model and the\ninterfacial approach further explained. As a first ingredient of this approach,\nwe here analyze planar fronts, their profile and velocity. We encounter a\nselection problem, recall some knowledge about such problems and apply it to\nplanar streamer fronts. We make analytical predictions on the selected front\nprofile and velocity and confirm them numerically.\n  (abbreviated abstract)\n", "  If a magnetic field normal to the surface of a magnetic fluid is increased\nbeyond a critical value a spontaneous deformation of the surface arises (normal\nfield instability). The instability is subcritical and leads to peaks of a\ncharacteristic shape. We investigate the neighborhood of this instability\nexperimentally under the influence of a temporal modulation of the magnetic\nfield. We use a small vessel, where only one peak arises. The modulation can\neither be stabilizing or destabilizing, depending on the frequency and\namplitude. We observe a cascade of odd-numbered response-periods up to period\n11, and also a domain of even-numbered periods. We propose a minimal model\ninvolving a cutoff-condition which captures the essence of the experimental\nobservations.\n  PACS: 47.20.-k, 47.20.Ky, 75.50.Mm\n  Keywords: magnetic fluid; nonlinear oscillator; subharmonic response; surface\ninstability;\n", "  We propose a phenomenological model for pattern formation in a vertically\nvibrated layer of granular material. This model exhibits a variety of stable\ncellular patterns including standing rolls and squares as well as localized\nobjects (oscillons and worms), similar to recent experimental\nobservations(Umbanhowar et al., 1996). The model is an amplitude equation for\nthe parametrical instability coupled to the mass conservation law. The\nstructure and dynamics of the solutions resemble closely the properties of\nlocalized and cellular patterns observed in the experiments.\n", "  The dynamics of curved vortex filaments is studied analytically and\nnumerically in the framework of a three-dimensional complex Ginzburg-Landau\nequation (CGLE). It is proved that a straight vortex line is unstable with\nrespect to spontaneous stretching and bending in a certain range of parameters\nof the CGLE, resulting in formation of persistent entangled vortex\nconfigurations. The analysis shows that the standard approach relating the\nvelocity of the filament with the local curvature, is insufficient to describe\nthe instability and self-generation of vorticity.\n", "  We present a phenomenological theory for spatiotemporal chaos (STC) in\nRayleigh-Benard convection, based on the generalized Swift-Hohenberg model. We\napply a random phase approximation to STC and conjecture a scaling form for the\nstructure factor $S(k)$ with respect to the correlation length $\\xi_2$. We\nhence obtain analytical results for the time-averaged convective current $J$\nand the time-averaged vorticity current $\\Omega$. We also define power-law\nbehaviors such as $J \\sim \\epsilon^\\mu$, $\\Omega \\sim \\epsilon^\\lambda$ and\n$\\xi_2 \\sim \\epsilon^{-\\nu}$, where $\\epsilon$ is the control parameter. We\nfind from our theory that $\\mu = 1$, $\\nu \\ge 1/2$ and $\\lambda = 2 \\mu + \\nu$\nfor phase turbulence and that $\\mu = 1$, $\\nu \\ge 1/2$ and $\\lambda = 2 \\mu + 2\n\\nu$ for spiral-defect chaos. These predictions, together with the scaling\nconjecture for $S(k)$, are confirmed by our numerical results. Finally we\nsuggest that Porod's law, $S(k) \\sim 1/\\xi_2 k^3$ for large $k$, might be valid\nin STC.\n", "  The response of spiral waves to external perturbations in a stable regime of\nthe two-dimensional complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGLE) is investigated. It\nis shown that the spiral core has a finite mobility and performs Brownian\nmotion when driven by white noise. Combined with simulation results, this\nsuggests that defect-free and quasi-frozen states in the noiseless CGLE are\nunstable against free vortex excitation at any non-zero noise strength.\n", "  We study a mechanism of pulse propagation failure in excitable media where\nstable traveling pulse solutions appear via a subcritical pitchfork\nbifurcation. The bifurcation plays a key role in that mechanism. Small\nperturbations, externally applied or from internal instabilities, may cause\npulse propagation failure (wave breakup) provided the system is close enough to\nthe bifurcation point. We derive relations showing how the pitchfork\nbifurcation is unfolded by weak curvature or advective field perturbations and\nuse them to demonstrate wave breakup. We suggest that the recent observations\nof wave breakup in the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction induced either by an\nelectric field or a transverse instability are manifestations of this\nmechanism.\n", "  The dynamics of curved vortex filaments is studied analytically and\nnumerically in the framework of a three-dimensional complex Ginzburg-Landau\nequation (CGLE). It is shown that a straight vortex line is unstable with\nrespect to spontaneous stretching and bending in a substantial range of\nparameters of the CGLE, resulting in formation of persistent entangled vortex\nconfigurations. The boundary of the three-dimensional instability in parameter\nspace is determined. Near the stability boundary, the supercritical saturation\nof the instability is found, resulting in the formation of stable helicoidal\nvortices.\n", "  The order parameter model based on parametric Ginzburg-Landau equation is\nused to describe high acceleration patterns in vibrated layer of granular\nmaterial. At large amplitude of driving both hexagons and interfaces emerge.\nTransverse instability leading to formation of ``decorated'' interfaces and\nlabyrinthine patterns, is found. Additional sub-harmonic forcing leads to\ncontrolled interface motion.\n", "  Motivated by the observation of localized circular excitations (`oscillons')\nin vertically vibrated granular layers (P.B. Umbanhowar, F. Melo and H.L.\nSwinney, Nature 382 (1996) 793), we numerically investigate an extension of a\nSwift-Hohenberg model that exhibits a subcritical transition to square\npatterns. For sufficient subcriticality, stable oscillon structures are found.\nThe localization mechanism is quite general and is due to non-adiabatic\neffects. Bound structures of oscillons of equal and opposite polarity are found\nwith bound states of like polarity being less robust. Much of the phenomena are\nconsistent with the experimental observations and suggest that oscillons are\nnot specific to patterns in granular media or to parametrically driven systems.\nExperimental tests are suggested that would determine whether this minimal\nframework is sufficient to describe the phenomena.\n", "  We discovered a new type of spiral wave solutions in reaction-diffusion\nsystems --- spike spiral wave, which significantly differs from spiral waves\nobserved in FitzHugh-Nagumo-type models. We present an asymptotic theory of\nthese waves in Gray-Scott model. We derive the kinematic relations describing\nthe shape of this spiral and find the dependence of its main parameters on the\ncontrol parameters. The theory does not rely on the specific features of\nGray-Scott model and thus is expected to be applicable to a broad range of\nreaction-diffusion systems.\n", "  We describe a physical mechanism for creating multi-soliton bound states\nwhere solitons are glued together by attraction between the beams they guide,\n`solitonic gluons'. We verify the concept of the solitonic gluons\nexperimentally, observing a suppression of the repulsion between dark solitons\ndue to an attractive force between bright guided beams.\n", "  We present experimental study of a topological excitation, {\\it interface},\nin a vertically vibrated layer of granular material. We show that these\ninterfaces, separating regions of granular material oscillation with opposite\nphases, can be shifted and controlled by a very small amount of an additional\nsubharmonic signal, mixed with the harmonic driving signal. The speed and the\ndirection of interface motion depends sensitively on the phase and the\namplitude of the subharmonic driving.\n", "  The emission of electromagnetic waves from a source within or near a\nnon-trivial medium (with or without boundaries, crystalline or amorphous, with\ninhomogeneities, absorption and so on) is sometimes studied using the\nreciprocity principle. This is a variation of the method of Green's functions.\nIf one is only interested in the asymptotic radiation fields the generality of\nthese methods may actually be a shortcoming: obtaining expressions valid for\nthe uninteresting near fields is not just a wasted effort but may be\nprohibitively difficult. In this work we obtain a modified form the reciprocity\nprinciple which gives the asymptotic radiation field directly. The method may\nbe used to obtain the radiation from a prescribed source, and also to study\nscattering problems. To illustrate the power of the method we study a few\npedagogical examples and then, as a more challenging application we tackle two\nrelated problems. We calculate the specular reflection of x rays by a rough\nsurface and by a smoothly graded surface taking polarization effects into\naccount. In conventional treatments of reflection x rays are treated as scalar\nwaves, polarization effects are neglected. This is a good approximation at\ngrazing incidence but becomes increasingly questionable for soft x rays and UV\nat higher incidence angles.\n  PACs: 61.10.Dp, 61.10.Kw, 03.50.De\n", "  The low-energy scattering of ortho positronium (Ps) by H, He, Ne, and Ar\natoms has been investigated in the coupled-channel framework by using a\nrecently proposed time-reversal-symmetric nonlocal electron-exchange model\npotential with a single parameter $C$. For H and He we use a three-Ps-state\ncoupled-channel model and for Ar and Ne we use a static-exchange model. The\nsensitivity of the results is studied with respect to the parameter $C$.\nPresent low-energy cross sections for He, Ne and Ar are in good agreement with\nexperiment.\n", "  Well-known to specialists but little-known to the wider audience is that\nNewtonian gravity can be understood as geodesic motion in space-time, where\ntime is absolute and space is Euclidean. Newtonian cosmology formulated by\nHeckmann agrees implicitly with Cartan's formulation of Newtonian mechanics as\ngeodesic motion in space-time, but does not unfold the underlying geometric\npicture. I present the transformation theory of Newtonian mechanics and gravity\ndeveloped by Cartan and Heckmann, and show via coordinate transformations that\nHeckmann's Newtonian cosmological model has a center, so that the cosmological\nprinciple cannot hold globally.\n  It is possible to confuse the relativity principle with a position of\nrelativism. Mach's principle has much to do with the latter and nothing to do\nwith the former. Both general relativity and nonlinear dynamics inform us that\nmost coordinate systems ae defined locally by differential equations that are\nglobally nonintegrable: global extensions of local coordinates usually do not\nexist. I explain how defining inertial frames locally by free fall\nshort-circuits Mach's philosophic objectios to Newtonian dynamics.\n", "  The order of high harmonics emitted by an atom in an intense laser field is\nlimited by the so-called cutoff frequency. Solving the time-dependent\nSchr\\\"odinger equation, we show that this frequency can be increased\nconsiderably by a parabolic confining potential, if the confinement parameters\nare suitably chosen.\n  Furthermore, due to confinement, the radiation intensity remains high\nthroughout the extended emission range. All features observed can be explained\nwith classical arguments.\n", "  One of the topical problems of contemporary physics is a possible variability\nof the fundamental constants. Here we consider possible variability of two\ndimensionless constants which are most important for calculation of atomic and\nmolecular spectra (in particular, the X-ray ones): the fine-structure constant\n\\alpha=e^2/\\hbar c and the proton-to-electron mass ratio \\mu=m_p/m_e. Values of\nthe physical constants in the early epochs are estimated directly from\nobservations of quasars - the most powerful sources of radiation, whose spectra\nwere formed when the Universe was several times younger than now. A critical\nanalysis of the available results leads to the conclusion that present-day data\ndo not reveal any statistically significant evidence for variations of the\nfundamental constants under study. The most reliable upper limits to possible\nvariation rates at the 95% confidence level, obtained in our work, read:\n  |\\dot\\alpha/\\alpha| < (1.4e-14)/yr,\n  |\\dot\\mu/\\mu| < (1.5e-14)/yr\n  on the average over the last ten billion years.\n", "  This is a graduate course on elementary quantum mechanics written for the\nbenefit of undergraduate and graduate students. It is the English version of\nphysics/0003106, which I did at the suggestion of several students from\ndifferent countries. The topics included refer to the postulates of quantum\nmechanics, one-dimensional barriers and wells, angular momentum and spin, WKB\nmethod, harmonic oscillator, hydrogen atom, quantum scattering, and partial\nwaves\n", "  We have studied the exchange-correlation hole and pair correlation function\nin the valence shell of the ground-state of the Si atom, using accurate\nSlater-Jastrow wavefunctions and the Variational Monte Carlo method. The\nexchange-correlation hole shows a number of interesting features caused by the\nopen shell structure of Si, including a marked transition from efficient to\npoor screening behavior as a test majority-spin electron is moved from the\ncenter of a valence 3p orbital onto the axis perpendicular to the occupied 3p\norbitals. This behavior results from the dramatic difference in the exchange\nhole in the two cases, which is partially compensated by a corresponding\nanisotropy in the correlation hole. In addition we observe an anisotropic\nchange in the spin density induced by Coulomb correlation, reducing the spatial\noverlap between the different spin-components of the density and contributing\nto the anisotropy of the correlation hole. In contrast to the longer range\nfeatures, we find that the \"on-top\" correlation hole is well described by\nlinear density functional theory, for a large range of local density and\nmagnetization.\n", "  Can a simple microscopic model of space and time demonstrate Special\nRelativity as the macroscopic (aggregate) behavior of an ensemble ? The\nquestion will be investigated in three parts. First, it is shown that the\nLorentz transformation formally stems from the First Relativity Postulate (FRP)\n{\\it alone} if space-time quantization is a fundamental law of physics which\nmust be included as part of the Postulate. An important corollary, however, is\nthat when measuring devices which carry the basic units of lengths and time\n(e.g. a clock ticking every time quantum) are `moving' uniformly, they appear\nto be measuring with larger units. Secondly, such an apparent increase in the\nsizes of the quanta can be attributed to extra fluctuations associated with\nmotion, which are precisely described in terms of a thermally agitated harmonic\noscillator by using a temperature parameter. This provides a stringent\nconstraint on the microscopic properties of flat space-time: it is an array of\nquantized oscillators. Thirdly, since the foregoing development would suggest\nthat the space-time array of an accelerated frame cannot be in thermal\nequilibrium, (i.e. it will have a distribution of temperatures), the approach\nis applied to the case of acceleration by the field of {\\it any} point object,\nwhich corresponds to a temperature `spike' in the array. It is shown that the\noutward transport of energy by phonon conduction implies an inverse-square law\nof force at low speeds, and the full Schwarzschild metric at high speeds. A\nprediction of the new theory is that when two inertial observers move too fast\nrelative to each other, or when fields are too strong, anharmonic corrections\nwill modify effects like time dilation, and will lead to asymmetries which\nimplies that the FRP may not be sustainable in this extreme limit.\n", "  We use recent results regarding the geometry of the U(3) bosonic algebraic\nmodel to motivate a hybrid algebraic-Schr\\\"odinger approach to the 2D\nFranck-Condon problem analogous to 1D approaches. This approach allows one to\nanalyze bent to linear Franck-Condon transitions of triatomic molecules as well\nas clarifies the angular momentum dependance of the Franck-Condon intensities.\n", "  The influence of an external electric field on the current in charged systems\nis investigated. The results from the classical hierarchy of density matrices\nare compared with the results from the quantum kinetic theory. The kinetic\ntheory yields a systematic treatment of the nonlinear current beyond linear\nresponse. To this end the dynamically screened and field-dependent\nLenard-Balescu equation is integrated analytically and the nonlinear relaxation\nfield is calculated. The classical linear response result known as Debye -\nOnsager relaxation effect is only obtained if asymmetric screening is assumed.\nConsidering the kinetic equation of one specie the other species have to be\nscreened dynamically while the screening with the same specie itself has to be\nperformed statically. Different other approximations are discussed and\ncompared.\n", "  This paper reviews recent research results in two-phase flow in porous media\nobtained by the authors.\n", "  In this first of two papers, strong limits on the accuracy of physical\ncomputation are established. First it is proven that there cannot be a physical\ncomputer C to which one can pose any and all computational tasks concerning the\nphysical universe. Next it is proven that no physical computer C can correctly\ncarry out any computational task in the subset of such tasks that can be posed\nto C. As a particular example, this means that there cannot be a physical\ncomputer that can, for any physical system external to that computer, take the\nspecification of that external system's state as input and then correctly\npredict its future state before that future state actually occurs. The results\nalso mean that there cannot exist an infallible, general-purpose observation\napparatus, and that there cannot be an infallible, general-purpose control\napparatus. These results do not rely on systems that are infinite, and/or\nnon-classical, and/or obey chaotic dynamics. They also hold even if one uses an\ninfinitely fast, infinitely dense computer, with computational powers greater\nthan that of a Turing Machine.\n", "  Exploiting stochastic path integral theory, we obtain \\emph{by simulation}\nsubstantial gains in efficiency for the computation of reaction rates in\none-dimensional, bistable, overdamped stochastic systems. Using a well-defined\nmeasure of efficiency, we compare implementations of ``Dynamic Importance\nSampling'' (DIMS) methods to unbiased simulation. The best DIMS algorithms are\nshown to increase efficiency by factors of approximately 20 for a $5 k_B T$\nbarrier height and 300 for $9 k_B T$, compared to unbiased simulation. The\ngains result from close emulation of natural (unbiased), instanton-like\ncrossing events with artificially decreased waiting times between events that\nare corrected for in rate calculations. The artificial crossing events are\ngenerated using the closed-form solution to the most probable crossing event\ndescribed by the Onsager-Machlup action. While the best biasing methods require\nthe second derivative of the potential (resulting from the ``Jacobian'' term in\nthe action, which is discussed at length), algorithms employing solely the\nfirst derivative do nearly as well. We discuss the importance of\none-dimensional models to larger systems, and suggest extensions to\nhigher-dimensional systems.\n", "  In order to make a case for or against a trend in the evolution of complexity\nin biological evolution, complexity needs to be both rigorously defined and\nmeasurable. A recent information-theoretic (but intuitively evident) definition\nidentifies genomic complexity with the amount of information a sequence stores\nabout its environment. We investigate the evolution of genomic complexity in\npopulations of digital organisms and monitor in detail the evolutionary\ntransitions that increase complexity. We show that because natural selection\nforces genomes to behave as a natural ``Maxwell Demon'', within a fixed\nenvironment genomic complexity is forced to increase.\n", "  The workshop `Astrophysical Dynamics 1999/2000' followed a homonymous\nadvanced research course, and both activities were organized by me. In this\nopening paper of the proceedings book, I describe them and document their\nstrong impact on the academic life of the local institutions. The advanced\nresearch course was open to graduate students, senior researchers, and\nmotivated under-graduate students with good background in physics and\nmathematics. The course covered several multi-disciplinary issues of modern\nresearch on astrophysical dynamics, and thus also of interest to physicists,\nmathematicians and engineers. The major topic was gas dynamics, viewed in\ncontext with stellar dynamics and plasma physics. The course was complemented\nby parallel seminars on hot topics given by experts in such fields, and open to\na wide scientific audience. In particular, I gave a friendly introduction to\nwavelets, which are becoming an increasingly powerful tool not only for\nprocessing signals and images but also for analysing fractals and turbulence,\nand which promise to have important applications to dynamical modelling of disc\ngalaxies. The workshop was open to a wide scientific audience. The workshop\nwith published proceedings book was, as a matter of fact, the innovative form\nof exam that I proposed for the advanced research course. The contributions\nwere refereed and their quality is high on average, exceptionally high in a few\ncases. The advanced research course and the workshop all together produced\ngreat enthusiasm in the students and welcomed the participation of a hundred\ndifferent people, which means an order of magnitude more than an average\ngraduate course at Chalmers University of Technology and G\\\"oteborg University.\n", "  Results are presented for simulations of electron-positron pair production in\nrelativistic heavy-ion collisions leading to electron capture and positron\nejection. We apply a two-center relativistic continuum distorted-wave model to\nrepresent the electron/positron dynamics during the collision process. The\nresults are compared with experimental cross-section data for ${\\rm La}^{57+}$\nand ${\\rm Au}^{79+}$ impact on Gold, Silver and Copper targets. The theory is\nin very good agreement with experiment, verifying the result that the process\nincreases in importance with both collision energy and target atomic number,\nand improves upon previous simulations of this process.\n", "  It is argued that properties of Democritus' atoms parallel those of volume\nforms in differential geometry. This kind of atoms has not \"size\" of finite\nmagnitude.\n  -----\n  Se arguye que las propiedades de los atomos de Democrito son paralelas a las\nde sus formas de volumen en geometria diferencial. Este tipo de atomos no tiene\ntamanno de magnitud finita.\n", "  We study coherent photoassociation, phenomena analogous to coherent optical\ntransients in few-level systems, which may take place in photoassociation of an\natomic Bose-Einstein condensate but not in a nondegenerate gas. We develop a\nsecond-quantized Hamiltonian to describe photoassociation, and apply the\nHamiltonian both in the momentum representation and in the position\nrepresentation (field theory). Solution of the two-mode problem including only\none mode each for the atomic and molecular condensates displays analogs of Rabi\noscillations and rapid adiabatic passage. A classical version of the field\ntheory for atoms and molecules is used to demonstrate that, in the presence of\nphotoassociating light, a joint-atom molecule is unstable against growth of\ndensity fluctuations. Experimental complications, including spontaneous\nemission and unwanted \"rogue\" photodissociation from a photoassociated molecule\nare analyzed. A two-color Raman scheme is studied as a method to set up an\neffective two-mode scheme with reduced spontaneous emission losses. We discuss\nphotoassociation rates and photoassociation Rabi frequencies for high-lying\nvibrational states in alkalis both on the basis of molecular-structure\ncalculations, and by comparing with an experiment [Wynar et al., Science 287,\n1016 (2000)].\n", "  A two level sampling method is applied to variational Monte Carlo (VMC) that\nsamples the one and two body parts of the wave function separately. The method\nis demonstrated on a single Li_2 molecule in free space and 32 H_2 molecules in\na periodic box. This simple modification increases the efficiency of a VMC\nsimulation by up to 72%.\n", "  We propose an experiment to measure the slow log(N) convergence to mean-field\ntheory (MFT) around a dynamical instability. Using a density matrix formalism,\nwe derive equations of motion which go beyond MFT and provide accurate\npredictions for the quantum break-time. The leading quantum corrections appear\nas decoherence of the reduced single-particle quantum state.\n", "  We show that Compton scattering can be used to cool TeV-scale muon beams, and\nwe derive analytical expressions for the equilibrium transverse angular spread,\nlongitudinal energy spread, and power requirements. We find that a factor of a\nfew thousand reduction in emittance is possible for a 3 TeV muon collider.\n", "  The symmetry of the problem of the apparent deficit in upward-going\natmospheric muon neutrinos reveals two possible, nonexclusive kinds of\nsolution: Nonlinearity in distance or nonlinearity in angle of observation.\n  Nonlinearity in distance leads to the most popular theory for the atmospheric\nproblem, neutrino flavor oscillations. If the observed deficit is caused by\noscillations and not, say, flavor-changing or other weak-force scattering,\nneutrinos must be massive. But, if flavor oscillations occur in vacuum, all\noscillating neutrinos must have exactly equal mass. Theories of oscillation in\nmatter such as the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) effect do not work in\nvacuum. This is the conceptual conflict of kinematics versus vacuum\noscillations. Flavor-changing oscillations like those of the\nCabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) quark theory become possible in vacuum if\nfreely propagating neutrinos may be associated with local substructure.\n  Nonlinearity in angle of observation leads to a simple prediction of an\nexcess of horizontal muon flavor. This and other angle-based effects should be\nobservable at Super-Kamiokande or other instruments which can measure\natmospheric flux by flavor.\n", "  The periodic swarming of bacteria is one of the simplest examples for pattern\nformation produced by the self-organized collective behavior of a large number\nof organisms. In the spectacular colonies of Proteus mirabilis (the most common\nspecies exhibiting this type of growth) a series of concentric rings are\ndeveloped as the bacteria multiply and swarm following a scenario periodically\nrepeating itself. We have developed a theoretical description for this process\nin order to get a deeper insight into some of the typical processes governing\nthe phenomena in systems of many interacting living units. All of our\ntheoretical results are in excellent quantitative agreement with the complete\nset of available observations.\n", "  We focus on various measures of the fluctuations of the sequence of intervals\nbetween beats of the human heart, and how such fluctuations can be used to\nassess the presence or likelihood of cardiovascular disease. We examine sixteen\nsuch measures and their suitability for correctly classifying heartbeat records\nof various lengths as normal or revealing the presence of cardiac dysfunction,\nparticularly congestive heart failure. Using receiver-operating-characteristic\nanalysis we demonstrate that scale-dependent measures prove substantially\nsuperior to scale-independent ones. The wavelet-transform standard deviation at\na scale near 32 heartbeat intervals, and its spectral counterpart near 1/32\ncycles/interval, turn out to provide reliable results using heartbeat records\njust minutes long. We further establish for all subjects that the human\nheartbeat has an underlying stochastic origin rather than arising from a\nchaotic attractor. Finally, we develop a mathematical point process that\nemulates the human heartbeat time series for both normal subjects and\nheart-failure patients.\n", "  The AIRIX facility is a high current linear accelerator (2-3.5kA) used for\nflash-radiography at the CEA of Moronvilliers France. The general background of\nthis study is the diagnosis and the predictive maintenance of AIRIX. We will\npresent a tool for fault diagnosis and monitoring based on pattern recognition\nusing artificial neural network. Parameters extracted from the signals recorded\non each shot are used to define a vector to be classified. The principal\ncomponent analysis permits us to select the most pertinent information and\nreduce the redundancy. A three layer Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network\nis used to classify the states of the accelerator. We initialize the network by\napplying an unsupervised fuzzy technique to the training base. This allows us\nto determine the number of clusters and real classes, which define the number\nof cells on the hidden and output layers of the network. The weights between\nthe hidden and the output layers, realising the non-convex union of the\nclusters, are determined by a least square method. Membership and ambiguity\nrejection enable the network to learn unknown failures, and to monitor\naccelerator operations to predict future failures. We will present the first\nresults obtained on the injector.\n", "  Results are reported from an experiment on RF pulsed heating of copper at\nSLAC. Damage in the form of cracks may be induced on the surface after the\napplication of many pulses of RF. The experiment consists of two circularly\ncylindrical cavities operated in the TE011 mode at a resonant frequency of\n11.424 GHz. Each cavity received 8.5 MW, 1.2 microsecond pulses at 60 Hz\ncorresponding to a calculated temperature rise of 120 K on the copper surface.\nAfter 5.5 x 10^7 pulses, the experiment was stopped and the copper surfaces\nwere examined. Damage is present on the area of the surface where the maximum\nheating occurred.\n", "  The UNILAC was improved for high current performance by replacing the Wideroe\nprestripper accelerator by an RFQ and an IH-type DTL. In addition, one of two\nion source terminals was equipped with high current sources of MUCIS- and\nMEVVA-type. Therefore, a redesign of the LEBT from the ion source to the RFQ\nentrance was necessary. The new LEBT was installed at the beginning of 1999.\nThe commissioning was carried mainly with a high intense argon beam. The\nachieved 17 emA Ar+ are 6 emA above the RFQ design intensity. The expected\nperformance of the new LEBT was achieved: full transmission for high current\nbeams, preservation of brilliance along the beam line, isotope separation for\nall elements, transverse phase space matching to the RFQ linac, and macropulse\nshaping. In particular, the high degree of space charge compensation was\nconfirmed.\n", "  A magnetic bunch compressor has been designed and is being commissioned for\nthe APS linac to provide higher peak current for the LEUTL FEL. Of primary\nconcern is control of emittance growth due to coherent synchrotron radiation\n(CSR). In addition, tolerances must be carefully evaluated in order to choose\nthe most stable operating conditions and ensure that the system can meet\noperational goals. The computer code ELEGANT was used to design the bunch\ncompressor, set tolerances, and simulate likely performance. This 6-D code\nincludes a fast, simple simulation of CSR effects as well as longitudinal and\ntransverse wakefields. It also is believed to be unique in allowing\noptimization of actual tracking results, such as bunch length, energy spread,\nand emittance. Automated setup and analysis of matching and tolerance\nsimulations allowed consideration of numerous configurations without excessive\neffort. This permitted choosing configurations that reduce sensitivity to\nerrors. Simulations indicate that emittance growth should be tolerable for up\nto 600 A peak current, for which the normalized emittance will increase from 5\nto about 6.8 pi-um. The simulations also provide predictions of emittance\nvariation with chicance parameters, which we hope to verify experimentally. *\nWork supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Basic\n  Energy Sciences, under Contract No. W-31-109-ENG-38.\n", "  A CW high power linear accelerator can only work with very low particles\nlosses and structure activation. At low energy, the RFQ is a very sensitive\nelement to losses. To design the RFQ, a good understanding of the beam dynamics\nis requested. Generally, the reference code PARMTEQM is enough to design the\naccelerator. TOUTATIS has been written with goals of cross-checking results and\nobtaining a more reliable dynamics. This paper relates the different numerical\nmethods used in the code. It is time-based, using multigrids methods and\nadaptive mesh for a fine description of the forces without being time\nconsuming.\n  The field is accurately calculated through a Poisson solver and the vanes are\nfully described, allowing to properly simulate the coupling gaps and RFQs\nextremities. Differences with PARMTEQM and LIDOS.RFQ are shown.\n", "  Effect of guiding magnetic field on evolution of stimulated emission is\nconsidered. It is shown that the transverse dynamics of electrons contributes\nto generation process and that contribution decreases with the magnetic field\ngrows. The equation of generation for stimulated radiation of electron beam\npassing over periodic medium in magnetic field of arbitrary value is derived.\nThe critical value of guiding field for which the transverse dynamics of\nelectron don't contribute to emission is determined. It is shown, that\ntransverse dynamics of electron modifies the boundary conditions. It follows\nfrom the derived generation equation that transverse dynamics yields to ~25%\nincrease of the increment magnitude in high gain regime. In the limit of small\nsignal the generation gain twice increases when transverse dynamics evolves.\nObtained results are valid for every FEL system, which use the mechanism of\nwaves slowing in the slow-wave structures for generation.\n", "  Electromagnetically induced absorption (EIA) was observed on a sample of $%\n^{85}Rb$ in a magneto-optical trap using low intensity cw copropagating pump\nand probe optical fields. At moderate trapping field intensity, the EIA\nspectrum is determined by the Zeeman effect produced on the atomic ground-state\nby the trapping quadrupolar magnetic field. The use of EIA spectroscopy for the\nmagnetic field mapping of cold atomic samples is illustrated.\n", "  Beams injected into a linear focusing channel typically have some degree of\nspace-charge nonuniformity. In general, injected particle distributions with\nsystematic charge nonuniformities are not equilibria of the focusing channel\nand launch a broad spectrum of collective modes. These modes can phase-mix and\nhave nonlinear wave-wave interactions which, at high space-charge intensities,\nresults in a relaxation to a more thermal-like distribution characterized by a\nuniform density profile. This thermalization can transfer self-field energy\nfrom the initial space-charge nonuniformity to the local particle temperature,\nthereby increasing beam phase space area (emittance growth). In this paper, we\nemploy a simple kinetic model of a continuous focusing channel and build on\nprevious work that applied system energy and charge conservation quantify\nemittance growth associated with the collective thermalization of an initial\nazimuthally symmetric, rms matched beam with a radial density profile that is\nhollowed or peaked. This emittance growth is shown to be surprisingly modest\neven for high beam intensities with significant radial structure in the initial\ndensity profile.\n", "  New optical arrangements with two single-mode input fibers and a fiber-optic\ncoupler are devised to measure the instantaneous velocity difference and local\nvelocity. The fibers and the coupler are polarization-preserving to guarantee a\nhigh signal-to-noise ratio. When the two input fibers are used to collect the\nscattered light with the same momentum transfer vector but from two spatially\nseparated regions in a flow, the obtained signals interfere when combined via\nthe fiber-optic coupler. The resultant light received by a photomultiplier tube\ncontains a cross-beat frequency proportional to the velocity difference between\nthe two measuring points. If the two input fibers are used to collect the\nscattered light from a common scattering region but with two different momentum\ntransfer vectors, the resultant light then contains a self-beat frequency\nproportional to the local velocity at the measuring point. The experiment shows\nthat both the cross-beat and self-beat signals are large and the standard laser\nDoppler signal processor can be used to measure the velocity difference and\nlocal velocity in real time. The new technique will have various applications\nin the general area of fluid dynamics.\n", "  We present linear response theories in the continuum capable of describing\nphotoionization spectra and dynamic polarizabilities of finite systems with no\nspatial symmetry. Our formulations are based on the time-dependent local\ndensity approximation with uniform grid representation in the three-dimensional\nCartesian coordinate. Effects of the continuum are taken into account either\nwith a Green's function method or with a complex absorbing potential in a\nreal-time method. The two methods are applied to a negatively charged cluster\nin the spherical jellium model and to some small molecules (silane, acetylene\nand ethylene).\n", "  It is proposed that cancer results from the breakdown of universal control\nmechanisms which developed in mutual association as part of the historical\nprocess that brought individual cells together into multi-cellular communities.\nBy systematically comparing the genomes of uni-celled with multi-celled\norganisms, one might be able to identify the most promising sites for\nintervention aimed at restoring the damaged control mechanisms and thereby\narresting the cancer.\n", "  On the base of multifractal theory of time and space (see\n\\cite{kob1}-\\cite{kob16}) in this paper shown presence in every space and time\nvolumes of real space and time fields a huge supply of energy . In the\nmultifractal Universe every space volume or time interval possesses by huge\namount of energy($\\sim10^{60}cm^{3}$) and we discuss the problem is it possible\nthis new for mankind sorts of energy to extract.\n  Contents: 1.

How Much Energy Space and Time Continually\nLose?\n", "  An exact correspondence is established between a $N$-body classical\ninteracting system and a $N-1$-body quantum system with respect to the\npartition function. The resulting quantum-potential is a $N-1$-body one.\nInversely the Kelbg potential is reproduced which describes quantum systems at\na quasi-classical level. The found correspondence between classical and quantum\nsystems allows also to approximate dense classical many body systems by lower\norder quantum perturbation theory replacing Planck's constant properly by\ntemperature and density dependent expressions. As an example the dynamical\nbehaviour of an one - component plasma is well reproduced concerning the\nformation of correlation energy after a disturbance utilising solely the\nanalytical quantum - Born result for dense degenerated Fermi systems. As a\npractical guide the quantum - Bruckner parameter $r_s$ has been replaced by the\nclassical plasma parameter $\\Gamma$ as $r_s\\approx0.3 \\Gamma^{3/2}$\n", "  Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods can very accurately compute ground state\nproperties of quantum systems. We applied these methods to a system of boson\nhard spheres to get exact, infinite system size results for the ground state at\nseveral densities.\n  Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) requires optimizing a parameterized wave\nfunction to find the minimum energy. We examine several techniques for\noptimizing VMC wave functions, focusing on the ability to optimize parameters\nappearing in the Slater determinant.\n  The kinds of problems that can be simulated with Monte Carlo methods are\nexpanded through the development of new algorithms for combining a QMC\nsimulation of the electrons with a classical Monte Carlo simulation for the\nnuclei, which we call Coupled Electronic-Ionic Monte Carlo (CEIMC). The new\nCEIMC method is applied to a system of molecular hydrogen at temperatures\nranging from 2800K to 4500K and densities from 0.25 to 0.46 g/cm**3.\n  The challenges in constructing an efficient CEIMC simulation center mostly\naround the noisy results generated from the QMC computations of the electronic\nenergy. The penalty method is a modification of the Metropolis method that can\ntolerate noise. An improved correlated sampling method, the two-sided energy\ndifference method, is also presented as a method for reducing the noise.\n", "  Numerical simulations are used to determine the influence of the non-local\nand local interactions on the intermittency corrections in the scaling\nproperties of 3D turbulence. We show that neglect of local interactions leads\nto an enhanced small-scale energy spectrum and to a significantly larger number\nof very intense vortices (tornadoes) and stronger intermittency. On the other\nhand, neglect of the non-local interactions results in even stronger\nsmall-scale spectrum but significantly weaker intermittency. Based on these\nobservations, a new model of turbulence is proposed, in which non-local\n(RDT-like) interactions couple large and small scale via a multiplicative\nprocess with additive noise and the local interactions are modeled by a\nturbulent viscosity. This model is used to derive a simple toy version of the\nLangevin equations for small-scale velocity increments. A Gaussian\napproximation for the large scale fields yields the Fokker-Planck equation for\nthe probability distribution function of the velocity increments.\n  Steady state solutions of this equation allows to qualitatively explain the\nanomalous corrections and the skewness generation along scale.\n", "  Some limit theorems are proven for the linear oscillator with random\ncoefficients. The asymptotic behaviour of the moments is studied in detail. The\ntechnique presented in this paper can be applied to general linear systems with\nnoise and is well suited for the investigation of stochastic beam dynamics in\naccelerators.\n", "  The physical nature of the photon mixing and photon echo processes is\ndiscussed on the basis of inequality of the forward and backward optical\ntransitions.\n", "  A new term describing interactions between charge and potentials may be added\nto the right hand side of the Einstein equations. In the proposed term an\nadditional tensor has been introduced containing a charge density, analogous to\nthe energy-momentum tensor containing a mass density. (The contribution of the\nelectromagnetic fields has not been considered in this work.) The metric\ncomponents in the new equations may contain charge and mass contributions. In\nthe special relativistic case a set of four vacuum Maxwell equations is\nobtained from the new equations containing a special relativistic charge\ndensity. A related result was recently found by Jefimenko from a special\nrelativistic transformation. Moreover, from the postulated equations the usual\nspecial relativistic electric energy and Lorentz force can be calculated, when\nthe approximated electromagnetic metric is used. In the non-relativistic case\nthe usual Maxwell equations with rest charge density are obtained. In the\npresence of a static gravitational field a set of four Maxwell equations is\nobtained applying in the general relativistic case. From these equations the\ngenerally accepted isotropic velocity of light can be deduced. In addition,\ncalculated generalized Maxwell equations show that vacuum permittivity and\npermeability may differ from unity value in the presence of a big charge Q or a\nbig mass M.\n", "  We theoretically examine photoassociation of a two-component Fermi degenerate\ngas, focusing on light-induced atom-atom interactions as a means to raise the\ncritical temperature of the BCS transition to a superfluid state. As it stands,\nphotoassociation-induced superfluidity is limited by spontaneous decay to\nexperimentally inconvenient light intensities [Mackie et al., Opt. Express 8,\n118 (2000)]. We therefore propose to use coherent control in photoassociation\nto a pair of molecular levels to cancel spontaneous emission, whereby the BCS\ntransition should occur within reach of current experimental techniques.\n", "  It is found that the ideal magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium of an axisymmetric\ngravitating magnetically confined plasma with incompressible flows is governed\nby a second-order elliptic differential equation for the poloidal magnetic flux\nfunction containing five flux functions coupled with a Poisson equation for the\ngravitation potential, and an algebraic relation for the pressure. This set of\nequations is amenable to analytic solutions. As an application, the\nmagnetic-dipole static axisymmetric equilibria with vanishing poloidal plasma\ncurrents derived recently by Krasheninnikov, Catto, and Hazeltine [Phys. Rev.\nLett. {\\bf 82}, 2689 (1999)] are extended to plasmas with finite poloidal\ncurrents, subject to gravitating forces from a massive body (a star or black\nhole) and inertial forces due to incompressible sheared flows. Explicit\nsolutions are obtained in two regimes: (a) in the low-energy regime\n$\\beta_0\\approx \\gamma_0\\approx \\delta_0 \\approx\\epsilon_0\\ll 1$, where\n$\\beta_0$, $\\gamma_0$, $\\delta_0$, and $\\epsilon_0$ are related to the thermal,\npoloidal-current, flow and gravitating energies normalized to the\npoloidal-magnetic-field energy, respectively, and (b) in the high-energy regime\n$\\beta_0\\approx \\gamma_0\\approx \\delta_0 \\approx\\epsilon_0\\gg 1$. It turns out\nthat in the high-energy regime all four forces, pressure-gradient,\ntoroidal-magnetic-field, inertial, and gravitating contribute equally to the\nformation of magnetic surfaces very extended and localized about the symmetry\nplane such that the resulting equilibria resemble the accretion disks in\nastrophysics.\n", "  We report experimental results for the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability between\ntwo immiscible fluids in parallel flow in a Hele-Shaw cell. We focus our\ninterest on the influence of the gap size between the walls on the instability\ncharacteristics. Experimental results show that the instability threshold, the\ncritical wavelength, the phase velocity and the spatial growth rate depend on\nthis gap size. These results are compared to both the previous two-dimensional\nanalysis of Gondret and Rabaud (1997) and the three-dimensional analysis\nrecently derived by Plourabou=E9 and Hinch (2001), showing that the agreement\nis still not complete especially when gap size increases.\n", "  Carnot established in 1824 that the efficiency of cyclic engines operating\nbetween a hot bath at absolute temperature $T_{hot}$ and a bath at a lower\ntemperature $T_{cold}$ cannot exceed $1-T_{cold}/T_{hot}$. We show that linear\noscillators alternately in contact with hot and cold baths obey this principle\nin the quantum as well as in the classical regime. The expression of the work\nperformed is derived from a simple prescription. Reversible and non-reversible\ncycles are illustrated. The paper begins with historical considerations and is\nessentially self-contained.\n", "  The hyperspherical harmonics (HH) provide a complete basis for the expansion\nof atomic wave functions, but even for two particles the number of harmonics\nfor a given order is not trivial and, as the number of electrons increases,\nthis degeneracy becomes absolutely prohibitive. We modify the method by\nselecting a subset of the basis that, we feel, will yield the physically most\nimportant part of the wave function, and test the idea on simple systems.\n  In a previous work (with M. Haftel) of the singlet ground and first excited\nstates of the helium atom we found that the error in the binding energy of the\nground state was of the order of 1 part in 10,000 and that it decreased for the\nfirst excited state.\n  We now have applied our method to the equivalent triplet states. We report on\nthis work, and our results, and hope to draw attention to the interesting\naccuracy that we obtain with the relatively simple wave functions of our\nformulation.\n", "  Photoabsorption cross sections of small sodium cluster cations (Na$_n^+$,\nn=3,5,7 and 9) were calculated at various temperatures with the time-dependent\nlocal-density-approximation (TDLDA) in conjunction with ab initio molecular\ndynamics simulations, yielding spectra that agree with measured ones without\nad-hoc line broadening or renormalization. Three thermal line-broadening\nmechanisms are revealed: (I) lifting of level degeneracies caused by\nsymmetry-breaking ionic motions, (II) oscillatory shifts of the entire spectrum\ncaused by breathing vibrations, and (III) cluster structural isomerizations.\n", "  We report new accurate mesasurements of the mobility of excess electrons in\nhigh density Helium gas in extended ranges of temperature $[(26\\leq T\\leq 77) K\n]$ and density $[ (0.05\\leq N\\leq 12.0) {atoms} \\cdot {nm}^{-3}]$ to ascertain\nthe effect of temperature on the formation and dynamics of localized electron\nstates. The main result of the experiment is that the formation of localized\nstates essentially depends on the relative balance of fluid dilation energy,\nrepulsive electron-atom interaction energy, and thermal energy. As a\nconsequence, the onset of localization depends on the medium disorder through\ngas temperature and density. It appears that the transition from delocalized to\nlocalized states shifts to larger densities as the temperature is increased.\nThis behavior can be understood in terms of a simple model of electron\nself-trapping in a spherically symmetric square well.\n", "  A New Mathematico-Physical and Information Theoretic Approach\n  Examination of the available hard core information to firm up the process of\nunification of quantum and gravitational physics leads to the conclusion that\nfor achieving this synthesis, major paradigm shifts are needed as also the\nanswering of `What is Time?' The object of this submission is to point out the\nmeans of achieving such a grand synthesis. Currently the main pillars\nsupporting the edifice of physics are: (i) The geometrical concepts of space-\ntime-gravitation, (ii) The dynamic concepts involving quantum of action, (iii)\nStatistical thermodynamic concepts, heat and entropy, (iv) Mathematical\nconcepts, tools and techniques serving both as a grand plan and the means of\ncalculation and last but not least v)Controlled observation, pertinent\nexperimentation as the final arbiter. In making major changes the author is\nfollowing Dirac's dictum \"....make changes without sacrificing the existing\nsuperstructure\". It is shown that time can be treated as a parameter rather\nthan an additional dimension. A new entity called \"Ekon\" having the properties\nof both space and momentum is introduced along with a space called\n\"Chalachala\". The requisite connection with Einstein's formulation and\nmathematical aperatus required have been formulated which is highly suited for\nthe purpose. The primacy of the Plancks quantum of action and its\nrepresentation geometrically as a twist is introduced. The practical and\nnumerical estimates have been made and applied to evaluation of the\ngravitational constant in a a seperate submission \"Estimations of gravitational\nconstant from CMBR data\".\n", "  We discuss harmonic generation in the case of laser field-dressed\nHamiltonians that are invariant under so-called dynamical symmetry operations.\nExamples for such systems are molecules which exhibit a discrete rotational\nsymmetry of order\n  N (e.g. benzene with N=6) interacting with a circularly polarized laser field\nand single atoms in a bichromatic field, with the two lasers having circular\npolarizations. Within a general group theory approach we study the harmonics\none obtains from the interaction of a laser pulse and a circular molecule. When\nthe system is in a pure field-dressed state the known selection rule kN \\pm 1,\nk=1,2,3, ... results. However, other lines are observed when recombinations\nwith states of a symmetry different from the initial one become important. This\nis the case for realistic laser pulses (i.e., with a finite duration). In\nparticular when the fundamental laser frequency (or one of its multiples) is\nresonant with a transition between field-dressed states. Numerical ab initio\nsimulations, confirming our analytical calculations and illustrating the power\nof the group theory approach, are presented.\n", "  New models of the Fock space sector corresponding to some fixed number of\nelectrons are introduced. These models originate from the representability\ntheory and their practical implementation may lead to essential reduction of\ndimensions of intermediate Configuration Interaction spaces. A certain\nzero-order theory that gives wave functions approximately equivalent to ones\nobtained by accounting all excitations from the Hartree-Fock reference state up\nto the q-th order is proposed. Simple numerical examples are given to\nillustrate the approach.\n", "  Volume Free Electron Laser (VFEL) was proposed in [1-4]. It can operate in\nthe wide spectral range from microwaves to X-rays. To simulate the processes\nwhich take place in VFEL the superradiance from a short electron pulse moving\nin a volume diffraction grating is studied in wavelength range ~4 mm. It is\nsupposed that Bragg condition for emitted photons is fulfilled and dynamical\ndiffraction takes place. The spectral-angular distributions for transmitted and\ndiffracted waves are derived. It is shown that the optimal geometry of\ndiffraction exists and is determined by the energy and transverse size of\nelectron beam.\n", "  The kinematics of the two-scale relativity theory (new relativity) is\nrevisited using a simplified approach. This approach allows us not only to\nderive the dispersion equation introduced earlier by Kowalski-Glikman, but to\nfind an additional dispersion relation, and, even more important, to provide a\nphysical basis for such relations. They are explained by the fact that in the\nobserver invariant two-scale relativity (new relativity) the Planck constant\ndoes nor remain constant anymore, but depends on the universal length scale.\nThis leads to the correct relation between energy and frequency at any scale.\n", "  We discuss the question as to how the magnetospheric energy source feeds the\nionospheric current system.\n  It is shown that a consistent application and further development of Kennel's\nideas makes it possible to successfully solve the magnetosphere-ionosphere\ncoupling problem in regard to the formation of auroral electrojets by steady\nvolume currents generated in the magnetosphere by the magnetospheric MHD\ngenerator in the case of a simple model which, nevertheless, retains the\nessential features of the reality. It is concluded that the whole of the\ncomplicated magnetospheric ''design'' only acts to redistribute, in space and\ntime, currents and energy fluxes which must be supplied by external sources to\nfeed the dissipative processes in the ionosphere.\n", "  In the past decade, the bunch lengths of electrons in accelerators have\ndecreased dramatically to the range of a few picoseconds\n\\cite{Uesaka94,Trotz97}. Measurement of the length as well as the longitudinal\nprofile of these short bunches have been a topic of research in a number of\ninstitutions \\cite{Uesaka97,Liu97,Hutchins00}. One of the techniques uses the\nelectric field induced by the passage of electrons in the vicinity of a\nbirefringent crystal to change its optical characteristics. Well-established\nelectro-optic techniques can then be used to measure the temporal\ncharacteristics of the electron bunch. In this paper we present a novel,\nnon-invasive, single-shot approach to improve the resolution to tens of\nfemtoseconds so that sub-millimeter bunch length can be measured.\n", "  The nuclear recoil correction to the bound-electron g factor in H-like atoms\nis calculated to first order in $m/M$ and to all orders in $\\alpha Z$. The\ncalculation is performed in the range Z=1-100. A large contribution of terms of\norder $(\\alpha Z)^5$ and higher is found. Even for hydrogen, the higher-order\ncorrection exceeds the $(\\alpha Z)^4$ term, while for uranium it is above the\nleading $(\\alpha Z)^2$ correction.\n", "  In 1995 a 9SDH-2 Pelletron from NEC was installed at IFUNAM (Instituto de\nFisica, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico). Two beam lines have been\noperational since then and two new lines have been built. In order to perform\nthe planned projects in this grown facility, an upgrading of the original\nmanual control system is required. The proposed new control system takes\nadvantage of the existing devices and incorporates the electronics needed for\nthe newer beam lines. The control software from NEC, has been modified to\naccommodate the larger requirements. It runs on the same dedicated computer but\nreceives commands from a new installed host. Both computers communicate through\na local network sharing the accelerator database. The new host computer also\nhandles all parameters related to the new lines. In the future, the old\ncomputer will be replaced in order to expand the possibilities of the system\nand use a friendlier graphical interface. In this work we present the changes\nmade to the control software, the new acquisition and control devices installed\nand the integration of the old and new systems. Finally, the beam control\nprocedure based on the analysis of the beam profile that is under development\nis also shown.\n", "  The Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) is an accelerator-based neutron source\nbeing built in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, by the U.S. Department of Energy. The SNS\nwill provide the most intense pulsed neutron beams in the world for scientific\nresearch and industrial development. The facility is scheduled for completion\nin 2006. The project is a collaboration between Lawrence Berkeley National Lab,\nArgonne National Lab, Los Alamos National Lab, Oak Ridge National Lab,\nBrookhaven National Lab, and Jefferson Lab. The Run Permit System (RPS) is a\nsoftware based system which has several key functions critical for safe\noperation of the machine. It coordinates machine mode and beam parameter\nchanges with the timing system, verifies the Machine Protection System (MPS)\nhardware configuration, and provides an interface for masking MPS hardware\ninputs when necessary. This paper will describe the primary functionality of\nthe Run Permit System and the interface between the Run Permit System, the\nMachine Protection System, and the timing system.\n", "  The Advanced Photon Source (APS) primary and backup injectors consist of two\nthermionic-cathode rf guns. These guns are being upgraded to provide improved\nperformance, to improve ease of maintenance, and to reduce downtime required\nfor repair or replacement of a failed injector. As part of the process, an\ninjector test stand is being prepared. This stand is effectively independent of\nthe APS linac and will allow for complete characterization and validation of an\ninjector prior to its installation into the APS linac.\n  A modular control system for the test stand has been developed using standard\nAPS control solutions with EPICS to deliver a flexible and comprehensive\ncontrol system. The modularity of the system will allow both future expansion\nof test stand functionality and evaluation of new control techniques and\nsolutions.\n", "  We propose a model that, accounting for the intrinsic non-linearity of the\nelectronic system, is able to rationalize steady-state electronic and\nvibrational spectra of polar chromophores in solution, as well as time-resolved\nexperiments.\n", "  Laser-plasma interferograms are currently analyzed by extracting the\nphase-shift map with FFT techniques (K.A.Nugent, Applied Optics {\\bf 18}, 3101\n(1985)). This methodology works well when interferograms are only marginally\naffected by noise and reduction of fringe visibility, but it can fail in\nproducing accurate phase-shifts maps when dealing with low-quality images.\n  In this paper we will present a novel procedure for the phase-shift map\ncomputation which makes an extensive use of the Ridge Extraction in the\nContinuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) framework. The CWT tool is {\\it flexible}\nbecause of the wide adaptability of the analyzing basis and it can be very {\\it\naccurate} because of the intrinsic noise reduction in the Ridge Extraction.\n  A comparative analysis of the accuracy performances of the new tool and the\nFFT-based one shows that the CWT-based tool phase maps are considerably less\nnoisy and it can better resolve local inhomogeneties.\n", "  The Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) timing and Real Time Data Link (RTDL)\nsystems are being designed and developed at Brookhaven National Laboratory\n(BNL), Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) and other SNS collaborating labs\n[1]. The VME-based SNS timing system is comprised of a phase locked loop (PLL)\nto generate a 120 Hz power line locked clock, a master timing system including\nup to 4 16-event input modules (V101) and a timing system encoder module\n(V123S), distribution system to all equipment locations, and a timing system\nreceiver module (V124S). The VME-based SNS RTDL system includes an encoder\nmodule (V105), up to 10 8-inputs modules (V206) and an RTDL receiver module.\nThe EPICS [2] software support for the timing and RTDL master VME boards has\nbeen developed at BNL while the software and hardware of the SNS utility module\nare undertaken at LANL. The software is currently under the beta test at the\nSNS collaborating labs. This paper describes the design and the implementation\nof the software.\n", "  We propose a simple cluster-based method with application to calculations of\nCompton profile anisotropies of ice. The convergence of the method is checked\nwith respect to Crystal95 results. Increasing both basis-set quality and\ncluster sizes results in a decrease of the magnitude of theoretical Compton\nanisotropies. The agreement with experimental data is therefore improved\ntowards previously calculated anisotropies. Moreover, analyzing directional\nautocorrelation functions shows an evidence for both anti-bonding and\npolarization effects.\n", "  In the last three years, the architecture of Frascati Tokamak Upgrade (FTU)\nexperimental database has undergone meaningful modifications, data and codes\nhave been moved from mainframe to UNIX platforms and AFS (Andrew File System)\nhas been adopted as distributed file system. Further improvement we have added\nregards data storage system; the choice of SAN (Storage Area Network) over\nFiber Channel, combined with power and flexibility of AFS, has made data\nmanagement over FTU very reliable. Performance tests have been done, showing\nbetter transfer rate than previous system, based on JBOD modules with SCSI\nconnection.\n", "  Imaginary- and real-time versions of an equation for the condensate density\nare presented which describe dynamics and decay of any spherical Bose-Einstein\ncondensate (BEC) within the mean field appraoch. We obtain quantized energies\nof collective finite amplitude radial oscillations and exact numerical\ninstanton solutions which describe quantum tunneling from both the metastable\nand radially excited states of the BEC of 7Li atoms. The mass parameter for the\nradial motion is found different from the gaussian value assumed hitherto, but\nthe effect of this difference on decay exponents is small. The collective\nbreathing states form slightly compressed harmonic spectrum, n=4 state lying\nlower than the second Bogolyubov (small amplitude) mode. The decay of these\nstates, if excited, may simulate a shorter than true lifetime of the metastable\nstate. By scaling arguments, results extend to other attractive BEC-s.\n", "  Lattice effects on the kink families of two models for one-dimensional\nnonlinear Klein-Gordon systems with double-well on-site potentials are\nconsidered. The analytical expression of the generalized Peierls-Nabarro\npinning potential is obtained and confronted with numerical simulations.\n", "  Transverse feedback systems for controlling the vertical coupled-bunch\ninstabilities in the positron and electron main rings are installed at DAFNE.\nThey started to be operative respectively from June and September 2000. For the\nhorizontal plane, similar systems have been installed in summer 2001 with less\nkicker power. Design specifications and the basic system concepts are\npresented. Real time bunch-by-bunch offset correction is implemented using\ndigital signal processors and dual-port RAM's. Fast analog to digital sampling\nis performed at the maximum bunch frequency (368 MHz). The system manages at\nfull speed a continuous flow of 8-bits data and it has the capability to invert\nthe sign or put to zero the output for any combination of bunches. A conversion\nfrom digital to analog produces the output correcting signal.\n", "  We investigate different correlation mechanisms for two-electron systems and\ncompare their respective effects on various electron distributions. The\nsimplicity of the wave functions used allows for the derivation of closed-form\nanalytical expressions for all electron distributions. Among other features, it\nis shown that angular and radial correlation mechanisms have opposite effects\non Compton profiles at small momenta.\n", "  New method for dissociation of diatomic molecule based on nonperiodic\nexcitation generated by energy-feedback control mechanism is proposed. The\nenergy-feedback control uses frequency-energy (FE) relation of the natural\noscillations to fulfill the resonance conditions at any time of excitation.\n  Efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated by the problem of\ndissociation of hydrogen fluoride (HF) molecule. It is shown that new method is\nmore efficient then methods based on constant frequency and linear chirping\nexcitation.\n", "  We return to the subject of stability of infinite time asymptotics of kinetic\nequations. We found a model which is simpler than those studied previously and\nwhich shows unstable behavior corresponding to our arguments to appear\nelsewhere, where, however, a relatively complicated problem was treated. Our\nsimplification to four levels interacting with surroundings enable us to\nproceed easily through all the way with just a pen and paper. We provide no\nnumerical modelling whose justification causes naturally difficulties to the\nreader. We draw also further consequences of the found instability, not only\nwith respect to higher order terms in kinetic equations but also concerning the\nvery philosophy of physical modelling. The latter point can give more\npractically oriented physicist even better motivation than mere speculations\nabout potential instabilities due to higher order terms in perturbation\ntreatments without concrete resolution of correct asymptotics.\n", "  We apply a recently introduced method for global optimization to determine\nthe ground state energy and configuration for model metallic clusters. The\nglobal minimum for a given N-atom cluster is found by following the damped\ndynamics of the N particle system on an evolving potential energy surface. In\nthis application, the time dependent interatomic potential interpolates\nadiabatically between the Lennard-Jones (LJ) and the Sutton-Chen (SC) forms.\nStarting with an ensemble of initial conditions corresponding to the ground\nstate configuration of the Lennard-Jones cluster, the system asymptotically\nreaches the ground state of the Sutton-Chen cluster. We describe the method and\npresent results for specific cluster size N=15, when the ground state symmetry\nof LJ$_N$ and SC$_N$ differ.\n", "  A novel nonlinear effect of anomalously deep penetration of an external radio\nfrequency electric field into a plasma is discribed. A self-consistent kinetic\ntreatment reveals a transition region between the sheath and the plasma.\nBecause of the electron velocity modulation in the sheath, bunches in the\nenergetic electron density are formed in the transition region adjusted to the\nsheath. The width of the region is of order $V_{T}/\\omega$, where V_{T} is the\nelectron thermal velocity, and $\\omega$ is frequency of the electric field. The\npresence of the electric field in the transition region results in a cooling of\nthe energetic electrons and an additional heating of the cold electrons in\ncomparison with the case when the transition region is neglected.\n", "  We calculate nuclear spin-dependent parity non-conserving $E1$-amplitudes for\noptical transition $6p_{1/2,F} -> 6p_{3/2,F'}$ and for hyperfine transition\n$6p_{1/2,F} -> 6p_{1/2,F'}$ in Tl. Experimental limit on the former amplitude\nplaced by Vetter et al. [PRL, 74, 2658 (1995)] corresponds to the anapole\nmoment constant $\\kappa_a = -0.26 \\pm 0.27$. Experiment on the hyperfine\ntransition can give direct measurement of the spin-dependent amplitude, because\nspin-independent amplitude turns to zero.\n", "  We offer simple solutions to three kinematic problems that occur in the\nfolding of proteins. We show how to construct suitably local elementary Monte\nCarlo moves, how to close a loop, and how to fold a loop without breaking the\nbond that closes it.\n", "  Excitation energies, oscillator strengths, and transition rates are\ncalculated for (5d2+5d6s+6s2)--(5d6p+5d5f+6s6p) electric dipole transitions in\nYb-like ions with nuclear charges Z ranging from 72 to 100. Relativistic\nmany-body perturbation theory (RMBPT), including the retarded Breit\ninteraction, is used to evaluate retarded E1 matrix elements in length and\nvelocity forms. The calculations start from a [Xe]4f14 core Dirac-Fock\npotential. First-order RMBPT is used to obtain intermediate coupling\ncoefficients, and second-order RMBPT is used to determine matrix elements. A\ndetailed discussion of the various contributions to energy levels and dipole\nmatrix elements is given for ytterbium like rhenium, Z=75. The resulting\ntransition energies are compared with experimental values and with results from\nother recent calculations. Trends of excitation energies, line strengths,\noscillator strengths, and transition rates as functions of nuclear charge Z are\nshown graphically for selected states and transitions.\n  These calculations are presented as a theoretical benchmark for comparison\nwith experiment and theory.\n", "  We investigate the possibility of optical current control through single\nmolecules which are weakly coupled to leads. A master equation approach for the\ntransport through a molecule is combined with a Floquet theory for the\ntime-dependent molecule. This yields an efficient numerical approach to the\nevaluation of the current through time-dependent nano-structures in the\npresence of a finite external voltage. We propose tunable optical current\nswitching in two- and three-terminal molecular electronic devices driven by\nproperly adjusted laser fields, i.e. a novel class of molecular transistors.\n", "  The spectrum of relativistic electron bunches with large energy dispersion is\nhardly obtainable with conventional magnetic spectrometers.\n  We present a novel spectroscopic concept, based on the analysis of the\nphotons generated by Thomson Scattering of a probe laser pulse inpinging with\narbitrary incidence angle onto the electron bunch.\n  The feasibility of a single-pulse spectrometer, using an energy-calibrated\nCCD device as detector, is investigated. Numerical simulations performed in\nconditions typical of a real experiment show the effectiveness and accuracy of\nthe new method.\n", "  A versatile semiclassical approximation for intense laser-atom processes is\npresented.\n  This uniform approximation is no more complicated than the frequently-used\nmulti-dimensional saddle-point approximation and far superior, since it applies\nfor all energies, both close to as well as away from classical cutoffs. In the\nlatter case, it reduces to the standard saddle-point approximation. The uniform\napproximation agrees accurately with numerical evaluations for potentials, for\nwhich these are feasible, and constitutes a practicable method of calculation\nin general. The method is applied to the calculation of high-order\nabove-threshold ionization spectra with various binding potentials: Coulomb,\nYukawa, and shell potentials which may model C$_{60}$ molecules or clusters.\nThe shell potentials generate high-order ATI spectra that are more structured\nand may feature an apparently higher cutoff.\n", "  On the standard microscopic model of friction we confirm the common belief\nthat the irreversible entropy production originates from the increase of\nShannon information. We reveal that the reversible microscopic dynamics would\ncontinuously violate the Gibbsian interchangeability of molecules. The\nspontaneous restoration of interchangeability constitutes the mechanism of\nirreversibility. This is the main suggestion of the Letter. We also point out\nthat the irreversible entropy can partially be rescued if the size of the\nmedium is finite. The rescueable entropy is found to be proportional to the\nsquare of the Fisher statistical (also called thermodynamic) distance.\n", "  A new state of the H$_2^+$ molecular ion with binding energy of\n1.09$\\times10^{-9}$ a.u. below the first dissociation limit is predicted, using\nhighly accurate numerical nonrelativistic quantum calculations. It is the first\nL=0 excited state, antisymmetric with respect to the exchange of the two\nprotons. It manifests itself as a huge p-H scattering length of $a=750\\pm 5$\nBohr radii.\n", "  Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) often appear in clusters along the\nlength of a chromosome. This is due to variation in local coalescent times\ncaused by,for example, selection or recombination. Here we investigate whether\nrecombination alone (within a neutral model) can cause statistically\nsignificant SNP clustering. We measure the extent of SNP clustering as the\nratio between the variance of SNPs found in bins of length $l$, and the mean\nnumber of SNPs in such bins, $\\sigma^2_l/\\mu_l$. For a uniform SNP distribution\n$\\sigma^2_l/\\mu_l=1$, for clustered SNPs $\\sigma^2_l/\\mu_l > 1$. Apart from the\nbin length, three length scales are important when accounting for SNP\nclustering: The mean distance between neighboring SNPs, $\\Delta$, the mean\nlength of chromosome segments with constant time to the most recent common\nancestor, $\\el$, and the total length of the chromosome, $L$. We show that SNP\nclustering is observed if $\\Delta < \\el \\ll L$. Moreover, if $l\\ll \\el \\ll L$,\nclustering becomes independent of the rate of recombination. We apply our\nresults to the analysis of SNP data sets from mice, and human chromosomes 6 and\nX. Of the three data sets investigated, the human X chromosome displays the\nmost significant deviation from neutrality.\n", "  If the small and large coupling behavior of a physical system can be computed\nperturbatively and expressed respectively as power series in a coupling\nparameter $g$ and $1/g$, a Pad\\'{e} approximant embracing the two series can\ninterpolate between these two limits and provide an accurate estimate of the\nsystem's behavior in the generally intractable intermediate coupling regime.\nThe methodology and validity of this approach are illustrated by considering\nseveral stationary state problems in quantum mechanics.\n", "  On the basis of a quantum-statistical approach to the electrical conductivity\nof nonideal plasmas we derive analytical results in the classical low-density\nregime, in the degenerate Born limit, and for the contribution of the\nDebye-Onsager relaxation effect. These explicit results are used to construct\nan improved interpolation formula of the electrical conductivity valid in a\nwide range of temperature and density which allows to compare with available\nexperimental data of nonideal plasmas.\n", "  The main purpose of this work is the investigation of the influence of\nelectron-positron-ion on the electrostatic wakefields that are driven by\nintense, short electromagnetic wave packets in a three component unmagnetized\nplasma. The equations that describes the driven electrostatic wakefield are\ngiven in the form of system of nonlinear differential equations. The solution\nof that system was carried out numerically and the results are displayed\ngraphically.\n", "  In this paper the results of Lyman alpha line shapes without the fine\nstructure in the electron impact approximation are rederived using a path\nintegral formalism. The method presented here is designed to provide a quantum\nformalism that will treat the ions and the electrons on the same physical\nbasis. This method has also the advantage of treating cases where the dynamical\neffects are present. We therefore, give an expression of the dipolar\nautocorrelation function taking into account the ion dynamics effects.\n", "  Most plasmas have a very thin sheath compared with the plasma dimension. This\nnecessitates separate calculations of the plasma and sheath. The Bohm criterion\nprovides the boundary condition for calculation of plasma profiles. To\ncalculate sheath properties a value of electric field at the plasma-sheath\ninterface has to be specified in addition to the Bohm criterion. The value of\nthe boundary electric field and robust procedure to approximately patch plasma\nand collisionless sheath with a very good accuracy are reported.\n", "  A self-consistent 1-D model was developed to study the effects of non-local\nelectron conductivity on power absorption and plasma density profiles in a\nplanar inductively coupled argon discharge at low pressures (< 10 mTorr). The\nmodel consisted of three modules: (1) an electron energy distribution function\n(EEDF) module to compute the non-Maxwellian EEDF, (2) a non-local electron\nkinetics module to predict the non-local electron conductivity, RF current,\nelectric field and power deposition profiles in the non-uniform plasma, and (3)\na heavy species transport module to solve for the ion density and velocity\nprofiles as well as the metastable density. Results using the non-local\nelectron conductivity model were compared with predictions of a local theory\n(Ohm's law), under otherwise identical conditions. The RF current, electric\nfield, and power deposition profiles were very different, especially at 1 mTorr\nfor which the effective electron mean free path was larger than the skin depth.\nHowever, the plasma density profiles were almost identical (within 10%) for the\nsame total power deposition in the plasma. This result suggests that, for\ncomputing plasma density profiles, a local conductivity model (Ohm's law), with\nmuch reduced computational expense, may be employed even in the non-local\nregime.\n", "  We discuss the experimental consequences of hypothetical time variations of\nthe fundamental constants. We emphasize that from a purely phenomenological\npoint of view, only dimensionless fundamental constants have significance. Two\nclasses of experiments are identified that give results that are essentially\nindependent of the values of all constants. Finally, we show that experiments\nthat are generally interpreted in terms of time variations of the dimensioned\ngravitional constant $G$ are better interpreted as giving limits on the\nvariation of the dimensionless constant $\\alpha_G=Gm_p^2/\\hbar c$.\n", "  It has been proposed that the adiabatic loading of a Bose-Einstein Condensate\n(BEC) into an optical lattice via the Mott-insulator transition can be used to\ninitialize a quantum computer [D. Jaksch, {\\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf\n81}, 3108 (1998)]. The loading of a BEC into the lattice without causing band\nexcitation is readily achievable; however, unless one switches on an optical\nlattice very slowly, the optical lattice causes a phase to accumulate across\nthe condensate. We show analytically and numerically that a cancellation of\nthis effect is possible by adjusting the harmonic trap force-constant of the\nmagnetic trap appropriately, thereby facilitating quick loading of an optical\nlattice for quantum computing purposes. A simple analytical theory is developed\nfor a non-stationary BEC in a harmonic trap.\n", "  The article presents results of preliminary study of solutions to recently\noffered basic thermodynamic equation for equilibrium in chemical systems with\nfocus on chaotic behavior. Classical part of that equation was investigated\nearlier in a series of papers. In this work a similarity between\none-dimensional logistic map and non-classical (chaotic) term of the equation\nwas discussed to introduce the problem. Results of this work allow us to\nevaluate the region where open equilibrium belongs to the basin of regular\nattractor and leads to trivial solutions with zero deviation from true\nthermodynamic equilibrium, and then to find first bifurcation threshold as a\nlimit of open equilibrium and a limit of the classical region as well. Features\nof the basic equation are discussed with regard to relative values of the\nchaotic and thermodynamic temperatures. Obtained results prompt us to consider\nthe basic equation of new theory to be the general equation of state of\nchemical systems.\n", "  Recent Feshbach-resonance experiments with 85Rb Bose-Einstein condensates\nhave led to a host of unexplained results: dramatic losses of condensate atoms\nfor an across-resonance sweep of the magnetic field, a collapsing condensate\nwith a burst of atoms emanating from the remnant condensate, increased losses\nfor decreasing interaction times--until very short times are reached, and\ncoherent oscillations between remnant and burst atoms. In particular, the\namplitude of the remnant-burst oscillations, and the corresponding missing\natoms, have prompted speculation as to the formation of a molecular condensate.\nUsing a minimal mean-field model, we find that rogue dissociation, molecular\ndissociation to noncondensate atom pairs, is qualitatively implicated as the\nphysical mechanism responsible for these observations, although very little\nmolecular condensate is formed. Refining the model provides excellent\nquantitative agreement with the experimental remnant-burst oscillations, and\nthe fraction of molecular condensate accounts almost entirely for the measured\natom loss.\n", "  The probability that an advantageous mutant rises to fixation in a viral\nquasispecies is investigated in the framework of multi-type branching\nprocesses. Whether fixation is possible depends on the overall growth rate of\nthe quasispecies that will form if invasion is successful, rather than on the\nindividual fitness of the invading mutant. The exact fixation probability can\nonly be calculated if the fitnesses of all potential members of the invading\nquasispecies are known. Quasispecies fixation has two important\ncharacteristics: First, a sequence with negative selection coefficient has a\npositive fixation probability as long as it has the potential to grow into a\nquasispecies with an overall growth rate that exceeds the one of the\nestablished quasispecies. Second, the fixation probabilities of sequences with\nidentical fitnesses can nevertheless vary over many orders of magnitudes. Two\napproximations for the probability of fixation are introduced. Both\napproximations require only partial knowledge about the potential members of\nthe invading quasispecies. The performance of these two approximations is\ncompared to the exact fixation probability on a network of RNA sequences with\nidentical secondary structure.\n", "  A special kind of quasi-homogeneity occurring in thermodynamic potentials of\nstandard thermodynamics is pointed out. Some formal consequences are also\ndiscussed.\n", "  We report on the experimental realization of an atom optical device, that\nallows scanning of an atomic beam. We used a time-modulated evanescent wave\nfield above a glass surface to diffract a continuous beam of metastable Neon\natoms at grazing incidence. The diffraction angles and efficiencies were\ncontrolled by the frequency and form of modulation, respectively. With an\noptimized shape, obtained from a numerical simulation, we were able to transfer\nmore than 50% of the atoms into the first order beam, which we were able to\nmove over a range of 8 mrad.\n", "  We analyze some aspects of the third law of thermodynamics. We first review\nboth the entropic version (N) and the unattainability version (U) and the\nrelation occurring between them. Then, we heuristically interpret (N) as a\ncontinuity boundary condition for thermodynamics at the boundary T=0 of the\nthermodynamic domain. On a rigorous mathematical footing, we discuss the third\nlaw both in Carath\\'eodory's approach and in Gibbs' one. Carath\\'eodory's\napproach is fundamental in order to understand the nature of the surface T=0.\nIn fact, in this approach, under suitable mathematical conditions, T=0 appears\nas a leaf of the foliation of the thermodynamic manifold associated with the\nnon-singular integrable Pfaffian form $\\delta Q_{rev}$. Being a leaf, it cannot\nintersect any other leaf $S=$ const. of the foliation. We show that (N) is\nequivalent to the requirement that T=0 is a leaf. In Gibbs' approach, the\npeculiar nature of T=0 appears to be less evident because the existence of the\nentropy is a postulate; nevertheless, it is still possible to conclude that the\nlowest value of the entropy has to belong to the boundary of the convex set\nwhere the function is defined.\n", "  It is now wellknown that Maxwell equations admit of wavelet-type solutions\nendowed with arbitrary group-velocities (0 < v_g < infinity). Some of them,\nwhich are rigidly moving and have been called localized solutions, attracted\nlarge attention. In particular, much work has been done with regard to the\nSuperluminal localized solutions (SLS), the most interesting of which resulted\nto be the \"X-shaped\" ones. The SLSs have been actually produced in a number of\nexperiments, always by suitable interference of ordinary-speed waves. In this\nnote we show, by contrast, that even a Superluminal charge creates an\nelectromagnetic X-shaped wave. Namely, on the basis of Maxwell equations, we\nare able to evaluate the field associated with a Superluminal charge (under the\napproximation of pointlikeness): and it results to constitute a very simple\nexample of true X-wave. [PACS nos.: 03.50.De; 03.30.+p; 41.20;Jb; 04.30.Db.\nKeywords: Special relativity; Maxwell equations; Superluminal waves; X-shaped\nwaves; Localized beams; Wave propagation; Superluminal charges].\n", "  We have designed low noise temperature sensing and control units with the\nobjective of using them for the fabrication of far infrared active cavity\nradiometers. The sensing unit, first characterized at 300K using industrial\nplatinium resistance thermometers, has a noise level of\n  25E-6 to 30E-6 Keff for a 3 hours measuring time and in a 1Hz bandwidth.\nUsing YBCO superconducting thermometers, the noise level goes down to 2.5E-6\nKeff, which is strongly limited by excess 1/f noise in the YBCO film at the\nsuperconducting transition. The sample holder used in the 90K experiments is\nbuilt with an auxiliary heating resistor, which enables an easy and accurate\nidentification of the electrothermal model, even in the closed loop operation.\nBased on a design previously published by NIST, we estimate from these\nexperimental results that the overall noise limitations of radiometers could be\nlowered by one order of magnitude.\n", "  This paper discusses some of the modal involvements of analytical mechanics.\nI first review the elementary aspects of the Lagrangian, Hamiltonian and\nHamilton-Jacobi approaches. I then discuss two modal involvements; both are\nrelated to David Lewis' work on modality, especially on counterfactuals.\n  The first is the way Hamilton-Jacobi theory uses ensembles, i.e. sets of\npossible initial conditions. The structure of this set of ensembles remains to\nbe explored by philosophers.\n  The second is the way the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian approaches' variational\nprinciples state the law of motion by mentioning contralegal dynamical\nevolutions. This threatens to contravene the principle that any actual truth,\nin particular an actual law, is made true by actual facts. Though this threat\ncan be avoided, at least for simple mechanical systems, it repays scrutiny; not\nleast because it leads to some open questions.\n", "  A self-consistent 1-D model was developed to study the effect of the electron\nenergy distribution function (EEDF) on power deposition and plasma density\nprofiles in a planar inductively coupled plasma (ICP) in the non-local regime\n(pressure < 10 mTorr). The model consisted of three modules: (1) an electron\nenergy distribution function (EEDF) module to compute the non-Maxwellian EEDF,\n(2) a non-local electron kinetics module to predict the non-local electron\nconductivity, RF current, electric field and power deposition profiles in the\nnon-uniform plasma, and (3) a heavy species transport module to solve for the\nion density and velocity profiles as well as the metastable density. Results\nusing the non-Maxwellian EEDF model were compared with predictions using a\nMaxwellian EEDF, under otherwise identical conditions. The RF electric field,\ncurrent, and power deposition profiles were different, especially at 1mTorr,\nfor which the electron effective mean free path was larger than the skin depth.\nThe plasma density predicted by the Maxwellian EEDF was up to 93% larger for\nthe conditions examined. Thus, the non-Maxwellian EEDF must be accounted for in\nmodeling ICPs at very low pressures.\n", "  We examine collective magnetoassociation of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC),\nfocusing on rapid adiabatic passage from atoms to molecules induced by a sweep\nof the magnetic field across a wide (>~ 10 G) Feshbach resonance in 85Rb. This\nproblem raises an interest because strong magnetoassociation is expected to\nfavor the creation of molecular-dissociated atom pairs over the formation of\nmolecular BEC [Javanainen and Mackie, Phys. Rev. Lett. 88, 090403 (2002)].\nNevertheless, the conversion to atom pairs is found to depend on the direction\nof the sweep, so that a system initially above threshold (open dissociation\nchannel) may in fact give near-complete conversion to molecules.\n", "  For low-pressure discharges, when the electron mean free path is larger or\ncomparable with the discharge length, the electron dynamics is essentially\nnonlocal. Moreover, the electron energy distribution function (EEDF) deviates\nconsiderably from a Maxwellian. Therefore, an accurate kinetic description of\nthe low-pressure discharges requires knowledge of the nonlocal conductivity\noperator and calculation of the nonMaxwellian EEDF. The previous treatments\nmade use of simplifying assumptions: a uniform density profile and a Maxwellian\nEEDF. In the present study a self-consistent system of equations for the\nkinetic description of nonlocal, nonuniform, nearly collisionless plasmas of\nlow-pressure discharges is derived. It consists of the nonlocal conductivity\noperator and the averaged kinetic equation for calculation of the nonMaxwellian\nEEDF. The importance of accounting for the nonuniform plasma density profile on\nboth the current density profile and the EEDF is demonstrated.\n", "  We report the development of a scalar quantization approach that helps build\ntables of decision and reconstruction levels for any probability density\nfunction (pdf). Several example pdf's are used for illustration:\n  Uniform, Gaussian, Laplace, one-sided Rayleigh, and Gamma (One sided and\ndouble-sided symmetrical). The main applications of the methodology are\nprincipally aimed at Multiresolution Image compression where generally the\nStretched Exponential pdf is encountered. Specialising to this important case,\nwe perform quantization and information entropy calculations from selected\nmedical MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) pictures of the human brain. The image\nhistograms are fitted to a Stretched exponential model and the corresponding\nentropies are compared.\n", "  The origin of the electromagnetic induced transparency (EIT) effect is\nexplained not as the vanish of atom-field interaction, but as the growing of\nstimulated emission process due to the efficient four- photon mixing, which\nallows the atom to return in the initial state. We point out the importance of\ncreation the new mathematical model for description the dynamics of optical\ntransitions, which should be based on the concept of the time invariance\nviolation in electromagnetic interactions.\n", "  We consider a particle represented by an anharmonic oscillator, coupled to an\nenvironment (a field) modeled by an ensemble of anharmonic oscillators, the\nwhole system being confined in a cavity of diameter $L$. Up to the first\nperturbative order in the quartic interaction (interaction parameter\n$\\lambda$), we use the formalism of {\\it dressed} states introduced in previous\npublications, to obtain for a large cavity explicit $\\lambda$-dependent\nformulas for the particle radiation process. These formulas are obtained in\nterms of the corresponding exact expressions for the linear case. We conclude\nfor the enhancement of the particle decay induced by the quartic interaction.\n", "  Using optical Ramsey interferometry, we precisely measure the laser-induced\nAC-stark shift on the $S_{1/2}$ -- $D_{5/2}$ \"quantum bit\" transition near 729\nnm in a single trapped $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ion. We cancel this shift using an\nadditional laser field. This technique is of particular importance for the\nimplementation of quantum information processing with cold trapped ions. As a\nsimple application we measure the atomic phase evolution during a $n \\times\n2\\pi$ rotation of the quantum bit.\n", "  Collective two-color photoassociation of a freely-interacting 87Rb\nBose-Einstein condensate is theoretically examined, focusing on stimulated\nRaman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) from an atomic to a stable molecular\ncondensate. In particular, Drummond et al. [Phys. Rev. A 65, 063619 (2002);\ncond-mat/0110578] have predicted that particle-particle interactions can limit\nthe efficiency of collective atom-molecule STIRAP, and that optimizing the\nlaser parameters can partially overcome this limitation. We suggest that the\nmolecular conversion efficiency can be further improved by treating the initial\ncondensate density as an optimization parameter.\n", "  The problem of determination of the maximum of second harmonic generation in\nthe potential well containing a rectangular barrier is considered. It is shown\nthat, in general, the problem of finding the ensemble of structures with\nequidistant first three levels has two types of solutions.\n  For the first type the second and third energy levels are located above a\nrectangular barrier, and for the second type the third level is located above\nthe barrier only. It is also shown, that generation corresponding to the second\ntype of solution always is less than generation for the first one. Taking into\naccount the effective mass changes the problem of finding the generation\nmaximum for a finite depth well is exactly solved.\n", "  We present a new method to extract distance and orientation dependent\npotentials between amino acid side chains using a database of protein\nstructures and the standard Boltzmann device. The importance of orientation\ndependent interactions is first established by computing orientational order\nparameters for proteins with alpha-helical and beta-sheet architecture.\nExtraction of the anisotropic interactions requires defining local reference\nframes for each amino acid that uniquely determine the coordinates of the\nneighboring residues. Using the local reference frames and histograms of the\nradial and angular correlation functions for a standard set of non-homologue\nprotein structures, we construct the anisotropic pair potentials. The\nperformance of the orientation dependent potentials was studied using a large\ndatabase of decoy proteins. The results demonstrate that the new distance and\norientation dependent residue-residue potentials present a significantly\nimproved ability to recognize native folds from a set of native and decoy\nprotein structures.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the effect of anomalous quantum correlations on\nthe light-induced frequency shift in the photoassociation spectrum of a\nBose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Anomalous quantum correlations arise because,\nalthough formed from a pair of zero-momentum condensate atoms, a condensate\nmolecule need not dissociate back to the BEC, but may just as well form a\nnoncondensate atom pair with equal and opposite momentum, i.e., due to rogue\nphotodissociation. The uncorrelated frequency shift of the photoassociation\nspectrum is to the red and linearly dependent on the laser intensity. In\ncontrast, anomalous correlations due to rogue dissociation lead to a\nblueshifted photoassociation spectrum. For sufficiently low light intensities,\nthe rogue blueshift is dominant and proportional to the squareroot of\nintensity.\n", "  A transverse multipole expansion is derived, including the longitudinal\ncomponents necessarily present in regions of varying magnetic field profile. It\ncan be used for exact numerical orbit following through the fringe field\nregions of magnets whose end designs introduce no extraneous components, {\\it\ni.e.} fields not required to be present by Maxwell's equations. Analytic\nevaluations of the deflections are obtained in various approximations. Mainly\nemphasized is a ``straight-line approximation'', in which particle orbits are\ntreated as straight lines through the fringe field regions. This approximation\nleads to a readily-evaluated figure of merit, the ratio of r.m.s. end\ndeflection to nominal body deflection, that can be used to determine whether or\nnot a fringe field can be neglected. Deflections in ``critical'' cases (e.g.\nnear intersection regions) are analysed in the same approximation.\n", "  Heat capacities of Na_N, N = 13, 20, 55, 135, 142, and 147, clusters have\nbeen investigated using a many-body Gupta potential and microcanonical\nmolecular dynamics simulations. Negative heat capacities around the cluster\nmelting-like transition have been obtained for N = 135, 142, and 147, but the\nsmaller clusters (N = 13, 20, and 55) do not show this peculiarity. By\nperforming a survey of the cluster potential energy landscape (PEL), it is\nfound that the width of the distribution function of the kinetic energy and the\nspread of the distribution of potential energy minima (isomers), are useful\nfeatures to determine the different behavior of the heat capacity as a function\nof the cluster size. The effect of the range of the interatomic forces is\nstudied by comparing the heat capacities of the Na_55 and Cd_55 clusters. It is\nshown that by decreasing the range of the many-body interaction, the\ndistribution of isomers characterizing the PEL is modified appropriately to\ngenerate a negative heat capacity in the Cd_55 cluster.\n", "  Conformal mapping has been applied mostly to harmonic functions, i.e.\nsolutions of Laplace's equation. In this paper, it is noted that some other\nequations are also conformally invariant and thus equally well suited for\nconformal mapping in two dimensions. In physics, these include steady states of\nvarious nonlinear diffusion equations, the advection-diffusion equations for\npotential flows, and the Nernst-Planck equations for bulk electrochemical\ntransport. Exact solutions for complicated geometries are obtained by conformal\nmapping to simple geometries in the usual way. Novel examples include nonlinear\nadvection-diffusion layers around absorbing objects and concentration\npolarizations in electrochemical cells. Although some of these results could be\nobtained by other methods, such as Boussinesq's streamline coordinates, the\npresent approach is based on a simple unifying principle of more general\napplicability. It reveals a basic geometrical equivalence of similarity\nsolutions for a broad class of transport processes and paves the way for new\napplications of conformal mapping, e.g. to non-Laplacian fractal growth.\n", "  Understanding functional associations among genes discovered in sequencing\nprojects is a key issue in post-genomic biology. However, reliable\ninterpretation of the protein interaction data has been difficult. In this\nwork, we show that if two proteins share significantly larger number of common\ninteraction partners than random, they have close functional associations.\nAnalysis of publicly available data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae reveals more\nthan 2800 reliable functional associations, 29% of which involve at least one\nunannotated protein. By further analyzing these associations, we derive\ntentative functions for 81 unannotated proteins with high certainty.\n", "  A heuristic but pedagogical derivation is given of an explicit formula which\naccurately reproduces the period of a simple pendulum even for large\namplitudes. The formula is compared with others in the literature.\n", "  Starting from the linear flow of homogeneous fluid, five modes are defined as\neigenvectors of the basic system of conservation laws.\n  Quasi-plane geometry is considered. Projectors that separate overall\nperturbation of the fluid into specific modes are calculated and applied to\nnonlinear flow. Dynamic equations for the interacting modes are obtained in the\nframes of the method. A particular case of streaming caused by acoustic pulse\nis considered, illustrations on temporal behavior of streaming velocity and\nstreamlines are presented.\n", "  We introduce a modified SPH approach that is based on discretising the\nparticle density instead of the mass density. This approach makes it possible\nto use SPH particles with very different masses to simulate multi-phase flows\nwith large differences in mass density between the phases. We test our\nformulation with a simple advection problem, with sound waves encountering a\ndensity discontinuity, and with shock tubes containing a contact discontinuity\nbetween air and Diesel oil. For all examined problems where particles have\ndifferent masses, the new formulation yields better results than standard SPH.\nThis is also the case for problems in which different spatial resolutions are\nneeded while the mass density does not change.\n", "  We theoretically examine the creation of a Fermi-degenerate gas of molecules\nvia a photoassociation or Feshbach resonance applied to a degenerate Bose-Fermi\nmixture of atoms. This problem raises an interest because, unlike bosons,\nfermions in general do not behave cooperatively, so that the collective\nconversion of, say, two million atoms into one million molecules is not to be\nexpected. Nevertheless, we find that the coupled Fermi system displays\ncollective Rabi-like oscillations and adiabatic passage between atoms and\nmolecules, thereby mimicking Bose-Einstein statistics. Cooperative association\nof a degenerate mixture of Bose and Fermi gases could therefore serve as a\nshortcut to a degenerate gas of Fermi molecules.\n", "  The density of states and other thermodynamic functions of helium\nnanodroplets are calculated for a microcanonical ensemble with both energy and\ntotal angular momentum treated as conserved quantum numbers. These functions\nallow angular momentum conserving evaporative cooling simulations.\n  As part of this project, a recursion relationship is derived for the\nreduction to irreducible representations of the n'th symmetric power of the\nirreducible representations of the rotation group. These give the distribution\nof total angular momentum states generated by putting multiple quanta into a\nripplon or phonon mode of the droplet, each of which is characterized by a\nangular momentum quantum number.\n", "  Numerical simulations are made for forced turbulence at a sequence of\nincreasing values of Reynolds number, R, keeping fixed a strongly stable,\nvolume-mean density stratification. At smaller values of R, the turbulent\nvelocity is mainly horizontal, and the momentum balance is approximately\ncyclostrophic and hydrostatic. This is a regime dominated by so-called pancake\nvortices, with only a weak excitation of internal gravity waves and large\nvalues of the local Richardson number, Ri, everywhere. At higher values of R\nthere are successive transitions to (a) overturning motions with local\nreversals in the density stratification and small or negative values of Ri; (b)\ngrowth of a horizontally uniform vertical shear flow component; and (c) growth\nof a large-scale vertical flow component. Throughout these transitions, pancake\nvortices continue to dominate the large-scale part of the turbulence, and the\ngravity wave component remains weak except at small scales.\n", "  Stripping cross sections in nitrogen have been calculated using the classical\ntrajectory approximation and the Born approximation of quantum mechanics for\nthe outer shell electrons of 3.2GeV I$^{-}$ and Cs$^{+}$ ions. A large\ndifference in cross section, up to a factor of six, calculated in quantum\nmechanics and classical mechanics, has been obtained. Because at such high\nvelocities the Born approximation is well validated, the classical trajectory\napproach fails to correctly predict the stripping cross sections at high\nenergies for electron orbitals with low ionization potential.\n", "  We establish the time averaged total force on a subwavelength sized particle\nin a time harmonic varying field. Our analysis is not restrictive about the\nspatial dependence of the incident field. We discuss the addition of the\nradiative reaction term in the polarizability in order to correctly deal with\nthe scattering force. As a consequence and illustration, we assess the degree\nof accuracy of several polarizability models previously established.\n", "  We theoretically investigate Raman photoassociation of a degenerate\nBose-Fermi mixture of atoms and the subsequent prospect for anomalous (Cooper)\npairing between atoms and molecules. Stable fermionic molecules are created via\nfree-bound-bound stimulated Raman adiabatic passage which, in contrast to\npurely bosonic systems, can occur in spite of collisions. With the leftover\natomic condensate to enhance intrafermion interactions, the superfluid\ntransition to atom-molecule Cooper pairs occurs at a temperature that is\nroughly an order of magnitude below what is currently feasible.\n", "  The use of virtual data for enhancing the collaboration between large groups\nof scientists is explored in several ways:\n  - by defining ``virtual'' parameter spaces which can be searched and shared\nin an organized way by a collaboration of scientists in the course of their\nanalysis;\n  - by providing a mechanism to log the provenance of results and the ability\nto trace them back to the various stages in the analysis of real or simulated\ndata;\n  - by creating ``check points'' in the course of an analysis to permit\ncollaborators to explore their own analysis branches by refining selections,\nimproving the signal to background ratio, varying the estimation of parameters,\netc.;\n  - by facilitating the audit of an analysis and the reproduction of its\nresults by a different group, or in a peer review context.\n  We describe a prototype for the analysis of data from the CMS experiment\nbased on the virtual data system Chimera and the object-oriented data analysis\nframework ROOT. The Chimera system is used to chain together several steps in\nthe analysis process including the Monte Carlo generation of data, the\nsimulation of detector response, the reconstruction of physics objects and\ntheir subsequent analysis, histogramming and visualization using the ROOT\nframework.\n", "  The radiation pressure exerted by incoherent light on diverse surfaces is\nexamined. The thermodynamic rule, first given by Carnot in 1824, describes the\nlimitation to the amount of free energy that can be obtained from a source of\nthermal energy, and he gave the compelling reason for this rule, that if more\nfree energy than he had prescribed could ever be extracted, then a heat pump\ncould use that free energy and re-create all the heat energy that had been\nconsumed. A perpetual motion machine could then be constructed. Now, 179 years\nlater, it is proposed to fly a spacecraft that is expected to gain velocity\nfrom the radiation pressure the sunlight is expected to exert on solar sails,\npanels of thin plastic sheets, mirror surfaced on the side facing the sun.\nHowever a detailed examination of this proposal shows it to be in direct\nconflict with Carnot's rule, and no such pressure can be expected. Either\nCarnot's accepted rule is in error, or the solar sail proposal will not work at\nall.\n", "  A PEM fuel cell was specially constructed to determine kinetics under\nconditions of well-defined gas phase composition and cell temperature. Steady\nstate multiplicity was discovered in the autohumidification PEM fuel cell,\nresulting from a balance between water production and water removal. Ignition\nwas observed in the PEM fuel cell for a critical water activity of about 0.1.\nIgnition is a consequence of the exponential increase of proton conductivity\nwith water activity, which creates an autocatalytic feedback between the water\nproduction and the proton conduction. The steady state current in the ignited\nstate decreases with increasing temperature between 50 to 105 deg C. At\ntemperatures greater than 70 deg C five steady states were observed in the PEM\nfuel cell. The steady state performance has been followed with variable load\nresistance and hysteresis loops have been mapped. The dynamics of transitions\nbetween steady states are slow about 10^3 to 10^4 s. These slow dynamics are\nsuggested to result from a coupling of mechanical and chemical properties of\nthe membrane electrode assembly due to swelling of the membrane with water\nabsorption.\n", "  Low frequency longitudinal wave instability in magnetized high correlation\ndusty plasmas is investigated. The dust charging relaxation is taken into\naccount. It is found that the instablity of wave is determined significantly by\nthe frequency of wave, the dust charging relaxation, the shear viscosity and\nviscoelastic relaxation time, the coupling parameter of high correlation of\ndust as well the strength of magnetic field.\n", "  A mechanism of memories, especially biological memories, is studied in terms\nof quantum fluids. Two-dimensional flows in central potentials\n$V_a(\\rho)=-a^2g_a\\rho^{2(a-1)}$ ($a\\not=0$ and $\\rho=\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$) have\nzero-energy eigenstates that degenerate infinitely for all $a$. It is shown\nthat stable standing waves constructed from the zero-energy flows are confined\nin various types of polygons which can be the minimum units of memory systems.\nVortex patterns awoken in the units by stimuli correspond to the memories of\nthe stimuli. This memory system is not a system for preserving memories as\nusual but that for awaking memories. The system has interesting properties;\n  (i) the absolute economy as for the energy consumption,\n  (ii) the infinite variety for a huge number of memories,\n  (iii) the perfect recovery of the system from any disturbances by stimuli,\nand\n  (iv) the large flexibility in the construction of the system.\n  A process for thinking is also proposed in terms of this memory system.\n", "  This paper outlines the benefits of computational steering for high\nperformance computing applications. Lattice-Boltzmann mesoscale fluid\nsimulations of binary and ternary amphiphilic fluids in two and three\ndimensions are used to illustrate the substantial improvements which\ncomputational steering offers in terms of resource efficiency and time to\ndiscover new physics. We discuss details of our current steering\nimplementations and describe their future outlook with the advent of\ncomputational grids.\n", "  Entropy and information provide natural measures of correlation among\nelements in a network. We construct here the information theoretic analog of\nconnected correlation functions: irreducible $N$--point correlation is measured\nby a decrease in entropy for the joint distribution of $N$ variables relative\nto the maximum entropy allowed by all the observed $N-1$ variable\ndistributions. We calculate the ``connected information'' terms for several\nexamples, and show that it also enables the decomposition of the information\nthat is carried by a population of elements about an outside source.\n", "  A theory of systems with long-range correlations based on the consideration\nof binary N-step Markov chains is developed. In the model, the conditional\nprobability that the i-th symbol in the chain equals zero (or unity) is a\nlinear function of the number of unities among the preceding N symbols. The\ncorrelation and distribution functions as well as the variance of number of\nsymbols in the words of arbitrary length L are obtained analytically and\nnumerically. A self-similarity of the studied stochastic process is revealed\nand the similarity group transformation of the chain parameters is presented.\nThe diffusion Fokker-Planck equation governing the distribution function of the\nL-words is explored. If the persistent correlations are not extremely strong,\nthe distribution function is shown to be the Gaussian with the variance being\nnonlinearly dependent on L. The applicability of the developed theory to the\ncoarse-grained written and DNA texts is discussed.\n", "  A new combined PIC-MCC approach is developed for accurate and fast simulation\nof a radio frequency discharge at low gas pressure and high density of plasma.\nTest calculations of transition between different modes of electron heating in\na ccrf discharge in helium and argon show a good agreement with experimental\ndata.\n  We demonstrate high efficiency of the combined PIC-MCC algorithm, especially\nfor the collisionless regime of electron heating.\n", "  This work is devoted to the theoretical study of the stability of two\nsuperposed horizontal liquid layers bounded by two solid planes and subjected\nto a horizontal temperature gradient.\n  The liquids are supposed to be immiscible with a nondeformable interface.\n  The forces acting on the system are buoyancy and interfacial tension. Four\ndifferent flow patterns and temperature profiles are found for the basic state.\nA linear perturbative analysis with respect to two and three dimensional\nperturbations reveals the existence of three kind of patterns. Depending on the\nrelative height of both liquids several situations are predicted: either wave\npropagation from cold to the hot regions, or waves propagating in the opposite\ndirection or still stationary longitudinal rolls. The behavior of three\ndifferent pairs of liquids which have been used in experiments on bilayers\nunder vertical gradient by other authors have been examined. The instability\nmechanisms are discussed and a qualitative interpretation of the different\nbehaviors exhibited by the system is provided. In some configurations it is\npossible to find a codimension-two point created by the interaction of two Hopf\nmodes with different frequencies and wavenumbers. These results suggest to\nconsider two liquid layers as an interesting prototype for the study of\npropagation and interaction of waves in the context of the B\\'enard-Marangoni\nproblem.\n", "  The Casimir force between metallic plates made of realistic materials is\nevaluated for distances in the nanometer range. A spectrum over real\nfrequencies is introduced and shows narrow peaks due to surface resonances\n(plasmon polaritons or phonon polaritons) that are coupled across the vacuum\ngap. We demonstrate that the Casimir force originates from the attraction\n(repulsion) due to the corresponding symmetric (antisymmetric) eigenmodes,\nrespectively. This picture is used to derive a simple analytical estimate of\nthe Casimir force at short distances. We recover the result known for Drude\nmetals without absorption and compute the correction for weakly absorbing\nmaterials.\n", "  We investigated students' use of Newton's second law in mechanics and\nelectromagnetism contexts by interviewing students in a two-semester\ncalculus-based physics course. We observed that students' responses are\nconsistent with three mental models. These models appeard in mechanics contexts\nand were transferred to electromagnetism contexts. We developed an inventory to\nhelp instructors identify these models and direct students towards the correct\none.\n", "  Although the auger-like 'swimming' motility of the African trypanosome was\ndescribed upon its discovery over one hundred years ago, the precise\nbiomechanical and biophysical properties of trypanosome flagellar motion has\nnot been elucidated. In this study, we describe five different modes of\nflagellar beat/wave patterns in African trypanosomes by microscopically\nexamining the flagellar movements of chemically tethered cells. The dynamic\nnature of the different beat/wave patterns suggests that flagellar motion in\nTrypanosoma brucei is a complex mixture of oscillating waves, rigid bends,\nhelical twists and non-linear waves. Interestingly, we have observed\nsoliton-like depression waves along the flagellar membrane, suggesting a\nnonlinear mechanism for the dynamics of this system. The physical model is\ninspired by the 2-dimensional elastic dynamics of a beam, and by taking into\naccount uniform distribution of molecular motors torque and nonlinear terms in\nthe curvature.\n", "  We numerically calculate the equivalent mode-field radius of the fundamental\nmode in a photonic crystal fiber (PCF) and show that this is a function of the\nV-parameter only and not the relative hole size. This dependency is similar to\nwhat is found for graded-index standard fibers and we furthermore show that the\nrelation for the PCF can be excellently approximated with the same general\nmathematical expression. This is to our knowledge the first semi-analytical\ndescription of the mode-field radius of a PCF.\n"]}
